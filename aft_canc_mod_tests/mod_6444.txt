A CT thorax showed multifocal parenchymal nodular opacifications.
There was a concern for a MDS transformation and BMB was done in house.
The final read was pending at the time of this note but was reported to be carcinoma of unknown primary.

Despite this, patient's blood pressure continued to decline.
On admission he was found to be febrile with and Cdiff stool toxin assay was positive so he was started on PO flagyl.
He was treated with bolused fluids and his pressures improved, he desatted to 88 on RA and was started on O2 and began satting well but remained tachycardic and continued to have labored respirations.
CXR demonstrated worsening of a left pleural effusion and ABG demonstrated mixed respiratory alkalosis and non-gap metabolic acidosis which we assessed as a combination of sepsis and diarrhea.
We had mild concern for PE but felt he was too unstable for CT scanner.
Abdominal XR showed no free air and was not concerning.
His CRP and ESR were severely elevated but this was felt to be related to his Cdiff colitis as above.
Hemolysis labs negative, reticulocyte index low, iron studies suggestive of anemia of chronic disease.
He was transfused RBC's and platelets with the threshold of plt >10 and Hct >21 to maintain perfusion and hemostasis.
During blood transfusion he spiked fevers likely related to his Cdiff or other underlying infectious processes and blood transfusions were held pending resolution of fevers.
#Elevated D-dimer: Pt with elevated D-Dimer on admission, possibly due to MDS vs. solid carcinoma activity.
During his trigger on [**10-7**] we had suspicion for possible PE but felt he was unstable for CT imaging.
