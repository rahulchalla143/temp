Patient denies any fever or chills, weight loss, night sweats, headache, shortness of breath, cough, bloating, dysuria, hematuria, jaundice.
Temperature of 98.0, pulse 53, blood pressure of 160/62, and breathing 12 times per minute, and 98% on room air.
Pulmonary:  Positive for right lower lobe crackles, otherwise were clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes were noted.
Rectal exam was guaiac positive, normal tone.
In preparation for possible surgical intervention, the patient was seen by Cardiology on [**5-4**], who had recommended an echocardiogram and starting of aspirin.
In the preoperative days following the admission, the patient had a chest x-ray, which revealed marked improvement in congestive heart failure with linear opacities towards the lung bases.
The patient underwent stress testing on [**5-4**], which revealed an EKG with evidence of a prior myocardial infarction.
On the following day, [**5-5**], the patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram, which revealed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, an ejection fraction of approximately 45%.
The colonoscopy revealed a high grade obstruction in the rectum that the scope was unable to pass through it.
To further evaluate the mass within the left rectum, the patient underwent a transrectal ultrasound, which revealed a rectal mass with an extension beyond the muscularis propria and therefore considered to be a T3 lesion.
There is also a single lymph node along the left lateral aspect of the rectum, which had a dimension of 2.8 mm.
Over the next couple of days, the patient continued to do well with no complaints and to complete her cardiac workup prior to surgery, the patient underwent a thallium stress test, which revealed a hypokinesis of the inferior wall that was moderate and reversible.
On the day of the patient's surgery, [**2198-5-8**], the patient underwent CAT scan to further delineate the extent of the mass.
The patient did require a Swan-Ganz catheter for continuous monitoring of the SvO2 and as the patient did require a dobutamine early in the case with a cardiac output dropping from 2.0 to 1.3.
From a cardiovascular standpoint, the patient's systolic blood pressure remained high in the 130s-180s, and was controlled with nitroglycerin drip.
During her stay in the PACU, the patient was slowly weaned off her nitroglycerin drip for a cuff pressure of less than 170.
By postoperative day #3, the patient was completely off her nitroglycerin drip and blood pressure was controlled with IV hydralazine.
From a cardiovascular standpoint, the blood pressure was well controlled on IV medications.
Colonic mucosal biopsies revealed no convincing features of malignancy are identified.
Highest node revealed fragment of fibrovascular and adipose tissue, no lymph nodal tissue identified.
Resection of rectosigmoid colon revealed adenocarcinoma.
Hydralazine 10 mg IV q6 prn systolic blood pressure greater than 150.
