LFTS trended down and an u/s of the liver was performed on pod 1 showing patent hepatic vasculature with appropriate waveforms and no biliary dilatation or collection seen.
A cxr was also done showing a small right pneumothorax.
A chest CT confirmed this.
PRBC and plt were given to keep hct greater than 30.
She continued to do well, but required O2 3-4 liters to keep sats in the 90-95 range.
The Chest tube remained in placed until [**6-10**] when non-bilious output decreased to less than 200ml.
Breath sounds remained clear with faint decrease in the right LLL.
A cxr showed a tiny right apical pneumothorax.
A repeat CXR was done on [**6-11**] showing near resolution of the pneumothorax.
JP output was noted to be bilious therefore on [**7-6**] an ERCP was performed demonstrating a biliary leak at the anastomosis.
A sphincterotomy was performed and a stent was placed successfully after a pancreatic duct stent was placed.
Amylase and lipase remained normal.
Dose was decreased to 1mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**7-12**] for a level of 15.2.
IV lasix 40mg had been given [**Hospital1 **] until day of discharge when this was stopped when her weight decreased to her admission weight.
Medications on Admission: Spironolactone 50 qd, Clotrimazole 10 5x a day, Boniva, Calcium Carbonate-Vit D3-Min, B12, Folic Acid  Discharge Medications: 1.
