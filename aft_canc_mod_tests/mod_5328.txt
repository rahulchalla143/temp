Sputum culture obtained at [**Hospital1 18**] with > 25 PMNs, culture with + MRSA.
Bronchoscopy noted purulent sputum in L lung which was suctioned.
Blood cultures with no growth to date at discharge.
UA, urine culture negative.
Hemoptysis/respiratory failure: Bronchoscopy performed on [**9-22**] revealed a tortuous and macerated trachea with significant tumor infiltration along the length of trachea extending into the right and left mainstem bronchi.
Serial hct were stable.
After the bronchoscopy with stent placement, his sedation began to be weaned.
His ABG on [**2197-9-22**] was 7.46/39/120 on AC 600 x 18, PEEP 8, FIO2 .60.
He remained intermittently guaiac positive on exam and would likely benefit from outpatient colonoscopy in the future.
Hypotension:  The patient was initially weaned off pressors; however, as his sedation requiremnt increased, his BP required more support and neo was re-started.
His BP also increased with fluid boluses.
Echocardiogram was performed on [**2197-9-20**]: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Dysphagia was biggest concern which improved s/p esophageal stent.
Speech and swallow evaluation revealed pt remained still too sedated to safely take solid and recommended starting him on small sips of clears.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: 0.25-1 injection Injection Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: Ten (10) mL PO BID (2 times a day).
