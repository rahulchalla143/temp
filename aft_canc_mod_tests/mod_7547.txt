[**2134-4-19**] Right foot xray:  No fracture or osteolysis involving the second digit.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2133-8-24**], LVH is now present.

His HCT on admission was 31 and he was transfused 1 unit PRBC.
His hematocrit remained stable throughout the remainder of his admission and he did not require any furhter transfusions.
He did not have colonoscopy or endoscopy during admission given that he had a troponin leak vs old NSTEMI and was felt to be at high risk for the procedure and his HCT was stable with no significant bleeding during his admission.
His troponin was elevated but his echocardiogram did not show any change compared with prior.
GI bleed also possible but less likely to be the cause of his syncope as HCT was relatively stable and >30.
4)Chronic systolic heart failure/CAD: He has significant h/o MI and cardiac disease with troponin elevation on admission which could be old NSTEMI vs. demand ischemia in setting of volume depletion and syncope given poor po intake.
He had an echocardiogram which did not show any significant change compared with prior, EF still 30%.
6)Metastatic prostate ca: s/p dose of Taxotere about 1 week ago, now with WBC trending down.
