OCTREOTIDE SCAN [**2102-4-17**]: No abnormal focus of tracer uptake at 4 hrs to suggest carcinoid.
Routine 24 hr and SPECT/CT images were not obtained secondary to patient clinical instability as above.
CXR [**4-20**] The ET tube tip is at the carina, just above the origin of the main bronchi and should be pulled back for approximately 2.5 cm.
TTE [**4-23**] The left atrium is normal in size.
The IVC is small, consistent with an RA pressure of <10mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-4-21**], the global left ventricular systolic function appears to have improved slightly, although this may in part be secondary to tachycardia (HR 119 currently, 63 on prior).
[**2102-4-29**] CT TORSO WITH CONTRAST: 1.
CXR [**2102-5-7**]: Mild pulmonary edema has improved since [**5-6**].
CT scanning should be helpful in evaluating these abnormalities.
An EKG showed a supraventricular tachycardia.
Cardiac enzymes were checked considering ST segment changes, and he ruled in for NSTEMI.
Imaging showed a diffuse multifocal pneumonia.
His antibiotics had already included vancomycin from a [**4-3**] blood culture of coag positive and negative staph, though per BMT recs these antibiotics were re-expanded to vancomycin and cefepime on [**4-27**] for fevers and hypotension.
A bronchoscopy with BAL was performed at that time for suspected pulmonary source of infection, demonstrating positive parainfluenza 3 though negative PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 11381**], bacterial cultures.
Multiple serum assays including adenovirus, CMV, EBV, HSV, HHV6 were negative.
A galactomanan was positive x2 but was felt to represent a false positive due to recent IVIG treatment.
He underwent CT torso on [**2102-4-29**] due to worsening fever and leukocytosis, showing significantly worse diffuse bilateral groundglass increased in extent and confluent from [**4-14**], thickening bronchial walls, more dense consolidation in the right upper lobe, and left upper lobe concerning for diffuse infection with bacterial superinfection on atypical process.
After failure to improve on vanco/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/voriconazole/acyclovir, he was started on ambisome for enhanced fungal coverage on [**5-2**], and fungal isolator cultures were sent which were negative.
Voriconazole was stopped, and vancomycin was discontinued in favor of linezolid at that time for a blood culture growing VRE from [**2102-4-28**].
Catheterization was not pursued.
TTE showed no valvular disease or WMA though the quality of the study was limited.
Renal team was consulted who recommended sodium bicarb infusions, also recommended renal ultrasound which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.
He was found to have an elevated chromogranin-A level 42, and was therefore sent for an octreodtide scan to rule out carcinoid which was negative.
