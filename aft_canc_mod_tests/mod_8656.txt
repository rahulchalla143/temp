VQ scan done showed approximately 80% ventilation perfusion from the left lung and approximately 12% ventilation perfusion performed by the right lung.
CT scan also showed that the mass had increased in size occupying the entire right lower lung with significant shift of the diaphragm and mediastinum.
Temperature was 97, heart rate 128, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 148/85, O2 saturation 96% on room air.
The chest revealed decreased breath sounds over the right lower lobe.
Cardiovascular examination revealed regular rate and rhythm.
LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit was 29, white blood cell count 8.8, PT 12, INR 1.0, PTT 30, sodium 139, potassium 4.0, chloride 103, CO2 22, BUN 10, creatinine 0.6, glucose 97.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm.
She was taken to the Recovery Room in stable condition having been extubated with an epidural catheter in place and bilateral chest tubes.
Of note, she had some postoperative elevation of her CKs to 1,011 which subsequently decreased.
Troponin was mildly elevated to 5.8 and decreased to 1.4.
However her EKG changes were suggestive of pericardial involvement and she was ruled out for myocardial infarction with the elevation in CKs and troponin thought to be secondary to intraoperative cardiac manipulation.
Of note she had some postoperative leukocytosis with white blood cell count to 27,000; however her white blood cell count continued to decrease over the next few days and was 12.6 on discharge.
