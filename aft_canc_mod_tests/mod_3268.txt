This is new compared to CT chest done only four days ago, and should be correlated directly with the symptomatic site.
Likely endplate fracture of T7; however, a mild wedge deformity was present on CT chest four days ago making if difficult to determine whether there is an acute component.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Anterior space likely represents a prominent fat pad (patient on high dose steroids; recent CT of chest/abdomen also confirms significant visceral fat around heart and organs).

He had a [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission for respiratory depression thought [**1-18**] medication sedation effect, and was called out to BMT on [**3-21**] after his pain Rx were adjusted and his sedation had improved.
His Abx were progressively stopped, and he remained afebrile.
He was empirically treated with Vanc/Aztreonam during that admission for a prolonged course, and his cultures were all unremarkable.
IgG level was checked and returned below 500.
PFTs were obtained during this admission and showed a mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect with a coexisting obstructive ventilatory defect and a moderate gas exchange defect.
# HCAP in setting of pulmonary GVHD: In an effort to elucidate an etiology for his hypoxia, a repeat chest CT was performed.
Blood gases showed significant improvement.
He was sent to the floor [**2148-3-30**] on an antimicrobial regimen which included vanc, [**Last Name (un) 2830**], voriconazole, bactrim, azithromycin.
These were progressively d/c'd, and the pt was weaned down to 0.5L NC and continued on azithromycin for infection prophylaxis and discharged to rehab.
An MRI of his spine was obtained which showed new fractures at T5 and T7.
He was sent for STAT MRI which showed a new epidural compression on T4/T5 with hyperdensity in that area, and new spinal cord signal change with edema.
Endocrine was consulted for assistance with management of severe osteopenia and recommended that we continue to give high dose vitamin D and calcium supplementation daily.
The heparin gtt was turned off and a stat CBC showed a 7 point Hct drop.
A CT of the Abdomen and Pelvis was obtained which showed left perinephric retroperitoneal hematoma.
The pt had anisocoria observed in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in setting of nebulizers, and had head CT which was negative.
Ophthalmology felt that the pt had significantly dry eyes and a decompensating exophoria - they recommended aggressive lub with artificial tear ointment [**Hospital1 **] and preservative free artificial tears q1h.
