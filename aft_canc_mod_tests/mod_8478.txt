CT BIOPSY Study Date of [**2147-10-10**] 11:25 AM:.
Successful CT-guided core biopsy of largest inferior right hepatic segment V mass.
Successful CT-guided core biopsy of large presumed right adrenal metastasis.
CT HEAD:There are multiple large supra- and infratentorial masses with a hyperdense rim and associated surrounding edema.
IMPRESSION: Multiple supra- and infratentorial masses with a hyperdense rim, which could represent enhancement, but underlying intralesional hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7306**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 805**] at 2:10 a.m. on [**2147-10-7**].
No viable cells are present for evaluation in the necrotic area.
He was emergently sent for IR embolization of the arteries, which appeared to be in the same region as the ones previously (Left upper lobe).
Given acute changes in his mental status we did an extensive workup for possible offending agents and infectious causes, as well as obtained a CT of his head, which showed large number of masses most consistent with metastatic disease.
A CT of his chest was performed and showed possible primary lung pathology as well as extensive metastatic disease in hte liver as well as adrenal glands.
Biopsies under CT guidance were obtained from liver and the adrenal gland.
