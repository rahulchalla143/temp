HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female with unclear history of prior CAD, with history of a mass encapsulating right middle lobe and right lower lobe bronchi with no liver metastasis, presumed to be a possible malignancy, unclear brain mets (though noncontrast head CT showed no hemorrhage or midline shift), who was initially transferred from an outside hospital for concerns of an aorta dissection.
Evaluation on the outside had revealed elevated CKs to around 2200 with troponin T at peak 24.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile, temperature 97.9, blood pressure in the systolic 110s/70s, actually in the 70s, heart rates in the 120s, respiratory of 20, on AC 600, saturating 100 percent.
LABORATORY DATA:  From [**2107-1-26**] show a CBC of 13.2, hematocrit 34.9, and platelets of 36,000.
Chemistries, sodium 144, potassium 3.6, chloride 109, bicarbonate 29.5, BUN 31, creatinine 0.8, glucose 129, lactate of 13.7, down to 6.3, coagulations 13.4, 28, 1.2; ALT 118, AST 319, alkaline phosphatase 131, total bilirubin 0.7, troponin is 8 down from 24.
Echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of 25% with global hypokinesis, 1 plus MR, mild aortic stenosis, negative for an effusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Review of systems: CAD; the patient was admitted from an outside hospital with elevated CK and troponin in the setting of rapid atrial fibrillation.
Her enzymes were trended down throughout her hospital course.
Subsequently, during her hospital course, the patient had Swan placed, which showed a RA pressure of 10, RV pressure of 30/7, PA pressure of 35/25, and a wedge of 15 with a cardiac index of 2.9, and SVR of 10.20.
CHF; the patient had an echocardiogram from admission showing an ejection fraction of only 25%, in the setting of presumed cardiac ischemia.
Her sputum was positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus.
Of note, blood cultures remained negative throughout her hospital course.
The etiology of the patient's masses presumed to be malignant of unclear etiology.
The patient did have a follow up head CT, which was negative for any intracranial malignancy, but did show diffuse mets throughout her skull.
Hematology; the patient's hematocrit was stable during the hospital course.
As mentioned above, she ultimately found to be grossly fluid overloaded secondary to massive amounts of fluid required to maintain her blood pressure.
