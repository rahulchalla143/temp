On POD1, he developed tachypnea, O2 desaturations into the 80s which responded to mask ventilation, and an ABG showing pH 7.27 and pCO2 67 (baseline is in the 50s, reportedly).
An abdominal x-ray [**7-9**] and follow-up CT scan of the abdomen [**7-10**] noted marked dilation of the small bowel with a transition point at the RLQ, c/w small bowel obstruction likely due to adhesion.
A follow-up CT abdomen on [**7-12**] found persistent diffuse small bowel dilation w/ transition point in the RLQ.
CT head [**7-3**] was performed given the concern for an intracranial process, as he hit his head during his fall, but this was unremarkable.
On POD1, his Hct trended down to 19.5, likely in the setting of post-op blood loss/equilibration, which resulted in him receiving 1U of packed RBCs.
# Diastolic heart failure: EF 65% in [**2147**] on [**Hospital1 18**] Echo.
CXR [**7-6**] and CT-A on [**7-6**] did not show evidence of pulmonary edema in the setting of respiratory failure.
His furosemide was held during the admission due to him not appearing volume overloaded on exam and intermittent Cr elevations.
# CKD: Baseline from PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**2151-5-13**] show BUN 27 and Cr 1.47.
His Cr was 1.53 on presentation to OSH on [**7-3**], and it remained stable through [**7-7**], when it was 1.6.
His furosemide was held given that his volume exam did not reveal that he was overloaded.
# Macrocytic anemia: His baseline hematocrit was known to be in the high 20s as of [**2151-5-13**].
On admission, Hct 27.1.
His Hct trended down to 19.5 on POD1, resulting in him receiving 1U packed RBCs since he reached his transfusion threshold of 21 in the post-op setting.
His HCT remained stable throughout the rest of his hospitalization.
