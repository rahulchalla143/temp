She has been seen periodically since discharge to follow her counts and transfused with platelets and RBC transfusions.
She began to feel better last evening, but this morning she reports a continued upset stomach with nausea and found her temperature to be 101.
Past Medical History: Onc Hx: 48 yo female w/ newly diagnosed AML, dx by BM biopsy on [**6-28**].
Her initial bone marrow was morphologically consistent with AML (type M4) with some monocytic differentiation and her cells were CD34, HLA-DR, CD11c, CD33, CD13, CD64, and CD117 positive and CD41, CD56, and glycophorin A negative.
On [**6-28**] she began 7+3 induction chemotherapy with three days of idarubicin 20 mg and seven days of cytarabine 170 mg. A day 14 bone marrow biopsy revealed no evidence of leukemia.
Patient's repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**7-30**] showed mildly hypercellular bone marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis.
Prior to her diagnosis, she was quite physically active bicycling and running.
Physical Exam: T 101.9 P 95 RR 26 BP 103/60 98% RA Gen: WDWN woman lying in bed in NAD HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, OP clear, MMM CV: RRR nl s1, s2, no m/g/r Lungs: CTAB, no w/r/r Abd: BS+, soft, NT, ND Ext: no c/c/e Pulses: 2+ radial bilaterally, warm LE Skin: no rashes Neuro: A&O, CN 2-12 intact, [**4-11**] UE and LE strength, no gross deficits to Light Touch, FNF and HKS WNL, tandem walk normal  Pertinent Results: ECHO: [**2176-12-12**]: Conclusions: 1.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are  normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2176-7-9**], there has been no significant change .
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF 50-60%).
The pulmonary artery  systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT Chest with contrast: [**2176-12-13**]: Numerous ground glass and solid nodules with upper lobe predominance with more confluent areas in the right apex.
CT Chest without contrast: [**2176-12-18**]: 1.
Improving ground-glass and solid nodules, which have a right upper lobe predominance.
CT Chest w/o contrast: [**2176-12-24**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Chest w/o contrast: [**2177-1-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Other causes such as parasitic or lymphoid infiltration are unlikely based on the imaging appearances.
Transbronchial biopsy may provide additional diagnostic value if these findings do not respond appropriately to treatment.
CT Chest with contrast: [**2177-1-6**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
A followup ultrasound is recommended in six weeks to assess for resolution.
CT Head with contrast: [**2177-1-6**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
Bronchial Washings [**2177-1-3**]: An abundant monomorphic population of intermediate sized mononuclear cells with folded nuclei, pale chromatin and variably prominent nucleoli, are suspicious for involvement by the patient's AML.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this bone marrow express immature antigens CD34, CD117, myeloid associated antigens CD33, CD11c, CD64 (dim), CD15 (dim), CD13 (dim), and lack the myeloid antigen CD14.
At this time, her WBC count started to climb exponentially rising to 57,000 and she began to develop DIC and leukostasis.
A repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**12-26**] showed residual clusters of blasts.
Tuberculosis was ruled out with sputum samples and a bronchoscopy, including a transbronchial biopsy, was negative for an infectious source.
The BAL from the bronchoscopy was suspicious for malignant cells, suggesting that the pulmonary process was due to her underlying leukemia.
Initially her WBC count began to decrease, although she continued to have peripheral blasts.
Eventually her WBC count and blast percentage began to rise again and at this point, combined with her poor respiratory status (see below), her care was transitioned towards comfort measures.
All studies, including multiple blood and urine cultures, induced sputum cultures, serologies, and bronchoscopy results were negative.
Later imaging revealed bilateral basilar infiltrates more suggestive of a bacterial infection.
Over the next several days, her wbc count began to rise and her CXR showed worsening bilateral infiltrates.
She was transferred back to the oncology floor on [**1-24**], her antibiotics were discontinued, a morphine drip was started and she passed away on [**2177-1-31**].
