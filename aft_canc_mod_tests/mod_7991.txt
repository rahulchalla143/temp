CXR [**4-13**]: The unilateral left lung intubation device is in place.
Multiple nodules are better appreciated on the cross-sectional imaging obtained on [**2119-4-6**].
CXR [**4-14**]: As compared to the prior study obtained at 8:42 p.m. on [**4-13**], [**2119**], there is minimal interval change on the current radiograph, but there is definitive interval increase in right pleural effusion and right lower lung opacity that might reflect aspiration or hemorrhage.
CXR [**4-15**]:  The patient was extubated.
Known left mass and multiple pulmonary nodules are redemonstrated, partially obscured by pulmonary edema and newly appeared bibasal areas of atelectasis and pleural effusion  [**4-16**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-15**], there is some improved level of inspiration with decrease in the bilateral opacifications.
CXR [**4-17**]: In comparison with the study of [**4-16**], there are slightly lower lung volumes, but otherwise little change.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2119-4-14**]):       3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2119-4-16**]):       10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED  [**4-17**] C dif screen: negative   Brief Hospital Course: 55 yo F w/ RCC (dx [**2118**]) with mets to lung and bone s/p L nephrectomy, XRT to R femur and tibia, cryodebridement and electrocautery ablation x2, IL-2 therapy c/b toxic encephalopathy and shock, who presented from OSH with hemoptysis s/p double lumen ET tube intubation for airway protection transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Flexible bronchoscopy on [**4-13**] showed complete obstruction to level of Left main bronchus, but no active bleeding, w/ some blood tinged fluid suctioned throughout the day.
IP performed rigid bronchoscopy on [**4-14**] which showed purulent secretions (though cultures would not grow anything back), LUL that was completely occluded.
She underwent debridment and electrocautery of LUL bronchus, which was opened, no active bleeding, but notable for old clots.
Her HCT remained overall stable 28 - 34.
However, an off label of a different study drug was suggested by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], to be started once patient is able to return home (will be mailed to her) .
Baseline Cr seems to range 1.2-1.5.
==== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # Will need close monitoring of blood pressures, given she was quite high in house, but prednisone will be coming off   Medications on Admission: ALBUTEROL SULFATE 90 mcg HFA Aerosol Inhaler - 2 HFA(s) inhaled every four (4) hours as needed for SOB, wheeze OXYCODONE - 5 mg Capsule - [**1-23**] Capsule(s) by mouth three times a day ACETAMINOPHEN -  (OTC) - 500 mg Tablet - [**1-23**] Tablet(s) by mouth DIPHENHYDRAMINE HCL -  (OTC) - 25 mg Capsule - Capsule(s) by mouth DOCUSATE SODIUM 100 mg prn FAMOTIDINE 10 mg Tablet prn   Discharge Medications: 1. amlodipine 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
You had high blood pressures during this admission.
You are being sent home on blood pressure medications.
Because your will taper the prednisone down over the next few days, we want to be careful that your blood pressure does not get too low.
Stop lisinopril and amlodipine (blood pressure meds) if the top number is less than 100.
You will need to see your PCP to [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] on blood pressure control.
