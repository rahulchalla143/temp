Chest X-Ray [**2167-2-28**]: IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
CT abd/pelvis [**2167-3-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
PET CT scan: [**2167-3-9**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Increased FDG uptake in several hilar lymph nodes, subcarinal lymph node and soft tissue at the left lung base near the mediastinum (difficult to tell if mediastinal lymph node or within the lung); concerning for focal [**Doctor Last Name **] transformation.
Also, due to diffuse anasarca and third spacing, the resolution on low-dose CT is particularly poor.
CXR [**2167-3-10**]: FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position.
The PICC line is difficult to identify on the native chest examination, however, a special contrast-enhanced copy conclusively demonstrates termination point close to the previously existing line as described.
Tissue immunophenotyping [**2167-3-3**]: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a Kappa light chain restricted monotypic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, consistent with patient's known chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma.
Clinical correlation and bone marrow biopsy study is recommended.
Tissue immunophenotyping [**2167-3-13**]: pending   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3012**] is a 69 y/o male with a history of ESRD on HD, CLL, DM2 c/b peripheral neuropathy, CAD and anemia (baseline 20-23) who presented with worsening shortness of breath and fatigue, transferred to MICU for hypotension, improved with aggressive IV hydration, then transferred to the floor where he was dialyzed and was evaluated for possible CLL/SLL conversion to lymphoma.
He was dialyzed as per schedule with additional ultrafiltration to help diurese the large fluid load he received due to hypotension.
His hematocrit should be checked every 3 days at rehab until it has stabilized.
# CLL/SLL: CT abdomen showed large intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy, initially concerning for [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] syndrome.
He subsequently received a PET CT which showed FDG avid uptake in hilar nodes but not intra-abdominally.
LDH remains normal, which suggests against conversion to lymphoma.
However, because hilar nodes were concerning on PET CT, he received bronchoscopy with hilar lymph biopsy [**2167-3-13**].
The pathology and immunophenotyping will be followed by hematology/oncology and the patient has follow up scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] to discuss results and initiate treatment should this be lymphoma.
# Hypertension: His blood pressure have been stable since IVF resuscitation.
The results of this biopsy are pending and you will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] for these results.
We made the following changes to your medications: - STOP lasix - STOP renagel (sevelamer) - STOP pioglitazone - STOP nebivolol - START metoprolol 50mg twice daily - CHANGE gabapentin to 200mg to be on hemodialysis days - START insulin sliding scale as directed - START heparin 5000 units subcutaneous injection 3 times daily, this can be stopped once you are able to walk regularly - START miralax 17g daily - START senna 8.6mg twice daily as needed for constipation - START dulcolax 5-10mg daily as needed for constipation .
