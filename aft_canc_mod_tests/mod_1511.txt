Imaging: [**2185-6-20**] MRI Head: Numerous infratentorial and supratentorial FLAIR hyperintense, ring-enhancing lesions with slow diffusion are new since [**2184-3-15**] MR exam and compatible with metastatic disease.
[**2185-6-22**] MRI Lumbar Spine: In comparison to [**2185-5-17**], MRI exam, focal signal abnormality of L5 vertebral body has significantly expanded and now involves the  entire vertebral body.
[**2185-6-30**] Chest X-ray: Comparison is made with prior study [**6-23**].
Right hilar fullness is noted, consistent with post-radiation changes known from prior chest CT from [**2185-5-17**].
[**2185-7-2**] MRI Head: Numerous ring-enhancing lesions are again noted in bilateral cerebral hemispheres and in the left cerebellum.
One of the lesions appear slightly larger than on the prior examination and there is increased edema surrounding this lesion and a lesion in the right frontal lobe.
Active Issues: # Streptococcus Anginosus Bacteremia: Positive cultures on [**2185-6-19**] and [**2185-6-20**].
Serial cultures since [**2185-6-21**] have been negative.
MRI on [**6-22**] showed epidural abscess centered around L5 which was the presumed source.
There is also concern that the brain lesions seen on [**2185-6-20**] MRI may be abscesses.
Culture of the abscess contents did not grow any organisms.
# Epidural Abscess: Discovered on MRI on [**6-22**] and was the suspected source of the patient's bacteremia.
A chest x-ray was obtained on [**6-30**] and showed collapse of his right upper lobe.
Interventional pulmonary was consulted and performed a bronchoscopy on [**7-1**] that revealed tumor obstruction which was not amenable to endobronchial stenting.
Ultrasound showed a DVT extending from the left common femoral vein to at least the popliteal vein and probably the left calf veins.
Patient's mental status improved as his sodium was corrected and his bacteremia treated with antibiotics.
The patient's sodium level stabilized and was normal on discharge.
CT head revealed an old ischemic infarct with has possible metastatic disease.
He received a head MRI which was initially suspicious for metastatic lesions, but in the setting of bacteremia were then thought to be abscesses or a combination of the two.
Inactive Problems: #HTN: His blood pressure was well controlled on his home lisinopril.
Medication Changes: -START IV Ceftriaxone for total of 4 weeks -START IV Metronidazole for total of 4 weeks -START Senna, Colace, Miralax for constipation -START Oxycontin, Dilaudid, Acetaminophen for pain -START Albuterol, Ipratropium nebulizers to help your breathing -START Lovenox for your blood clot -START Lorazepam for anxiety -START Salt Tabs for your low sodium levels 4.

You were then found to have an epidural abscess on MRI which was cleaned out by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28003**].
An MRI of your brain showed the possibity of abscesses in your brain.
Please make the following changes to your medications: -CONTINUE IV Ceftriaxone for total of 4 weeks (first dose on [**2185-6-23**]) -CONTINUE IV Metronidazole for total of 4 weeks (first dose on [**2185-6-23**]) -START Senna, Colace, Miralax for constipation -START Oxycontin, Dilaudid, Acetaminophen for pain -START Albuterol, Ipratropium nebulizers to help your breathing -START Lovenox for your blood clot -START Lorazepam for anxiety -START Salt Tabs for your low sodium levels  Resume your home medications as you were taking them prior to this admission.
