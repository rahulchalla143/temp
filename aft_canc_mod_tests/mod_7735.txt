Her weight has been fluctuating but no big weight loss recently.
Of note, patient recently presented to ED on [**2172-8-11**] with some RUE weaknesa and parethesia, and was found to have a WBC of 140K, and emergently leukopheresed, and was diagnosed with ALL.
In the ED, patient's initial vitals were: Afebrile, T98.2 BP 154/120 HR 138 RR 18 SPO297% on R/A.
She underwent CTA to rule out PE.
Her scan demonstrated large bilateral pleural effusions and a small pericardial effusion.
bedside US showed no tamponade, and small effusion.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

Tbili 1.7 (1.3 indirect and 0.4 direct) on admission, trended down to 1.0 on d/c.
LDH 273 on admit and 265 on d/c.
AlkP normal through admission Alb 3.7  CK MB was normal through admission [**7-12**] TropT slightly elevated at 0.09-0.11 then trended slightly more to 0.14-0.17, however not thought to be due to ACS  BNP 5007 on admission  PT: 14.1  PTT: 24.3  INR: 1.2 UA: neg  BCx negative x2  IMAGING: - CXR ([**2172-10-15**]) IMPRESSION: New interstitial edema and moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
- TTE [**2172-10-16**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-8-12**], global biventricular systolic dysfunction is new.
There are scattered noncalcified pulmonary nodules, which are new compared to the recent prior study of [**9-19**].
Short interval development since the prior study favors infectious/inflammatory etiology, progression of the disease less likely.
EKG on admission ([**2172-10-15**]): rate 127, sinus rhythm.
ECHO [**2172-10-16**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-8-12**], global biventricular systolic dysfunction is new.
EKG [**2172-10-16**] Sinus tachycardia with slowing of the rate compared to the previous tracing of [**2172-10-15**].
CXR [**2172-10-16**] FINDINGS: Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged from previous study.
ECHO  [**2172-10-20**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-10-16**], right ventricular cavity is slightly larger, although both RV and LV overall systolic function has improved.
CXR [**2172-10-21**] Lung volumes have improved, possibly because of deeper inspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: 36yo newly Dx'd ALL in [**8-13**], currently getting E2993 Tx, phase II day+26 admitted for SOB, orthopnea, n/v found to have heart failure with EF 15-20% with bilateral pleural effusions and small pericardial effusion, pancytopenic.
She was tachycardic and HTN, had a CTA without PE or dissection and had a TTE showing EF of 15-20%, global hypokinesis of LV, hypokinesis of free wall of RV, and small pericardial effusion.
The pt then had a repeat echo the day after she developed some acute CP (see below) which showed an improvement in her EF to 30%, improvement in systolic fxn of both ventricles, no increase in pericardial effusion.
By the time of discharge, the pt's vitals had stabilized and bp's were in the low 100's-110's and pulse 80's-90's, and her weight had decreased down to pre-admission weight.
The pt will be d/c'd on her current HF regimen and will need to be reassessed, including her heart failure meds and repeat echo in the future.
Chest pain--Pt c/o substernal pleuritic type pain on admission, and had one acute episode of SOB and substernal chest pain on the floor, pleuritic in nature, for which an EKG was obtained which was significant for small voltage QRS complexes in V3-V6 (no ST changes), a CXR was obtained which showed continued pleural effusions, and cardiac enzymes were drawn.
[**Name (NI) 94060**] pt had crackles on PE, was requiring O2 via NC, and had CXR showing pleural effusions.
All cultures were negative through admission.
Did receive 1U PRBC's through admission but Hct remained stable through rest of admission.
[**Name (NI) 94063**] pt was thrombocytopenic with plts 21 on admission and received 5U plts during admission, with minimal response.
Therefore, a lower platelet count was tolerated and aggressive transfusion was not pursued.
She had no clinical evidence of bleeding, her Hct remained stable, and her tachycardia trended down as her volume overload and heart failure resolved.
Pericardial effusion--There was some concern for a hemorrhagic pericarditis, with a small pericardial effusion seen on echo and her platelets being low and low voltage QRS complexes seen on an EKG once.
She received a follow up echo showing that the pericardial effusion had not increased in size.

Heart failure   Discharge Condition: By the time of discharge, the pt's volume overload was much improved, heart function had slightly improved as seen by heart ultrasound, had good oxygen saturation on room air and vital signs were stable, had been stabilized on a medicine regimen, and was medically clear for discharge.
You were stabilized in the intensive care unit and given medicines to draw off extra fluids from your body.
You had a repeat ultrasound of your heart which showed some improvement.
Please return to the hospital or to a health care provider if you experience fevers, chills, or night sweats, continued shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, swelling of your legs, chest pain, or any other concern.
Followup Instructions: Please follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4613**] on Monday [**2172-10-26**] at 2pm on [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] [**Location (un) 436**].
