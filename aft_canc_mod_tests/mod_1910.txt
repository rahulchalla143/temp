MICROBIOLOGY: Blood cultures from [**Date range (1) 30965**] NO GROWTH Abscess culture: NO GROWTH TO DATE .
<b>Radiologic Data: CXR [**8-6**]:  Mild-to-moderate CHF.
CXR [**8-6**]: There has been interval placement of a right subclavian central venous catheter with the tip in the SVC.
Cardiac Cath [**2167**]: 1.
Coronary angiography of this right-dominant system revealed no hemodynamically significant CAD.
Resting hemodynamic measurements revealed borderline elevation of the pulmonary artery systolic pressure at 30mmHg.
Left ventriculography revealed global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction estimated at 35%.
[**Year (4 digits) 113**] [**2171**] OSH: ejection fraction of 30% with inferior and apical hypoakinesis and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation .
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
LVEF 2.
TEE [**2174-8-9**]: Conclusions: No spontaneous [**Month/Day/Year 113**] contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
He also received a TTE and a TEE which showed no evidence of vegetation or abscess.
His old PICC line was removed and culture was sent.
His WBC count trended down from 12.9 - 7.
His OSH records were obtained on [**2174-8-9**], which showed that he had Staph hominis bacteremia and an [**Date Range **] report that raised the question of aortic valve endocarditis and AI.
The actual OCHO images were not able to be reviewed.
All blood cultures obtained were negative for growth.
EP was consulted; they feel that he does not need pacer wires changed at this time, however would consider changing the wires should he develop recurrent fevers or + blood cultures.
His initial troponin was 0.06.
CHF: [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed here showed an EF 30-35%: CXR on admission was consistent with CHF exacerbation, and his BNP was [**Numeric Identifier 30964**].
An ABG was normal.
CXR was without infiltrate.
His fevers resolved and he did not experience any more during admission.
Cultures remained negative, and his WBC trended down.
Cellulitis: The patient has a recent history of cellulitis of the L forearm, with a fluid collection that was previously drained and grew Enterobacter, for which he was treated with levofloxacin x 10 days.
His platelet count remained in the 50-60's.
Check follow up blood cultures 10 days after last dose of Vancomycin.
