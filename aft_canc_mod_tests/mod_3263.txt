As the day progressed, his temperature increase and he came to the ER.
On presentation to the ER, initial vitals were T 101, HR 104, RR 18 02 95% RA.
While in the ED, he became more hypoxic and required a NRB to keep sats above 93%.
He also became hypotensive to BPs of 80s/50s.
His BP was fluid responsive and the patient received a total of 3L.
CTA was done for pleuritic CP that showed a subsegmental PE, thus he was started on heparin gtt and given dilaudid for pain.
ROS: + photophobia, + bilateral chest pressure (chronic) hyperesthesia.
Chimerism testing showed them to be 100% donor. ]

UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The right PICC has been removed.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2144-11-23**] at 10:26:48 AM The left atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-6-8**], LV function appears hyperdynamic on the current study.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2144-11-25**] 5:10 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
Given the presence of pulmonary embolism in left lower lobe the worsening left lower lobe opacity might represent infarction as well as atelectasis or infection, determination based on the chest radiograph cannot be made.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2144-11-27**] 4:53 AM Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2144-11-26**].
[**2144-12-4**] CXR: FINDINGS: Comparison study [**12-3**], there is no interval change.
[**2144-12-7**] CT chest w/o contrast: 1.
Cultures were obtained.
Nasal swab was positive for RSV, sputum with gram positive cocci and yeast.
He is recommended to continue use of supplemental oxygen after discharge to maintain oxygen saturations greater than 94%.
On the day of discharge he was started on coumadin 2mg po and instructed to follow up in two days to have his INR monitored.
A RUQ ultrasound was performed to assess pt's chronic complaint of RUQ tenderness.
Ultrasound was without evidence of acute processes consistent with this pain.
Liver function tests were monitored throughout hospitalization.
An Echo was performed which showed hyperdynamic LVEF.
Start at 2L/minute oxygen via nasal cannula and titrate oxygen up to maintain oxygen saturations of greater than 94%.
Testosterone 5 mg/24 hr Patch 24 hr Sig: One (1) Patch 24 hr Transdermal DAILY (Daily).
You were found to have a blood clot in your left lung as well as an upper respiratory tract infection with a virus called RSV.
