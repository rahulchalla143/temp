Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2196-6-6**] 12:13 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
12 x 6 mm left occipital parenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage, unchanged compared to prior outside exam given differences in technique.
Facial fractures, partially imaged, better seen on outside hospital facial bone CT.  CT head [**2196-6-6**] 1.
13 x 8 mm left occipital hemorrhagic focus is most consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage, less likely intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and appears stable compared to the most recent prior study of 10 hours prior.
ECG [**2196-6-7**] Sinus rhythm.
CXR [**2196-6-7**] As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated.
The pre-existing post-surgical material after CABG and the pre-existing pleural calcifications are unchanged.
CXR [**2196-6-8**] Pulmonary vascular congestion is improving.
CXR [**2196-6-9**] No acute cardiopulmonary process.
CXR [**2196-6-12**] Compared to the prior exam, there has been a mild increase in the size of the heart with pulmonary vascular redistribution and volume loss at both bases.

On [**6-9**], patient was febrile to 102, cultures were sent and a CXR was ordered.
They recommended following his lab work and a speech and swallow exam   Serial chest X-rays showed fluid overload and he was diareses with Lasix.
