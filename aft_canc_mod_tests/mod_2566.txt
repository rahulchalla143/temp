[**2105-5-4**] - Cardiac Catheterization   History of Present Illness: Mr.[**Known lastname 284**] is a very nice 76 year-old gentleman with prior history of hypertension, s/p MI and coronary angioplasty in [**2091**].
A stress test was done for further evaluation.
HEENT - NC/AT, PERRLA, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear, Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Cardiac Perfusion [**2105-4-30**]: IMPRESSION: New small, fixed, moderate apical and distal septal defect correlating with reversible abnormality on the prior study but with normal LV cavity size and preserved ejection fraction of 63%.
Cardiac cath [**2105-5-4**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed diffuse three vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderately elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 20 mm Hg, LVEDP 26 mm Hg).
The systemic arterial blood pressure was mildly elevated (SBP 140 mm Hg).
The cardiac index was low-normal at 2.4 l/min/m2.
The systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were normal (1433 and 83 dynes-sec/cm5, respectively).
Left ventriculography demonstrated low-normal LV function (EF 50%) and moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation.
CXR PA/lat [**2105-5-4**]: IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Mild cardiomegaly is exaggerated by a pectus deformity.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Carotid series [**2105-5-5**]: Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
CT chest w/o contrast [**2105-5-5**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of recent infection, malignancy, or overhydration.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Interpretation assigned to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6506**] [**Name8 (MD) 6507**], MD, Interpreting physician    Brief Hospital Course: On [**2105-5-8**] Mr. [**Known lastname 284**] was taken to the operating room and underwent Coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 (left internal mammary artery grafted to the diagnal/saphenous vein grafted to the distal left anterior descending artery/obtuse marginal/ and PLB) with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**].
He was intubated and sedated, requiring Phenylephrine for blood pressure augmentation upon arrival to the CVICU.
With improved cognition and progression, POD# 4 Mr.[**Known lastname 284**] was transferred to the stepdown unit for further monitoring.
His coumadin will be managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a goal INR of 2.0.
Warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: Dose based on goal INR of 2.0 Tablet PO once a day: Dose for goal INR of 1.5-2.0.
Your goal INR is 1.5-2.0.
Please be seen within 48 hours following discharge from rehabilitation for PT/INR blood draw and further follow-up for coumadin management.
