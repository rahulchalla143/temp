PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial vital signs showed a temperature 98.4, blood pressure 112/74, pulse 60, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, stable oxygen saturation.
Head and neck examination revealed mild alopecia.
Cardiovascular examination revealed regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA:  Initial laboratories were notable for a white blood cell count of 0.8 with 80 percent neutrophils, 7 percent bands, 10 percent lymphocytes, 2 percent monocytes, hematocrit 31.5, platelet count 108,000, and ANC 180.
Cardiovascular - The patient had stable blood pressure on    admission but with her fever and neutropenia, she did have    an episode of lower systolic blood pressure into the 80s.
She had an echocardiogram at that time showing a normal    ejection fraction.
Her blood    pressure was subsequently stable with no further episodes    of hypotension.
Her counts were    slowly beginning to recover.
Her G-CSF was discontinued    [**2189-6-20**], for an ANC over 500.
Although    her initial chest x-ray findings were negative, she seemed    to develop increasing infiltrates and effusions.
She had a bronchoscopy done by    pulmonary.
Pain control - The patient had been on outpatient    OxyContin and her dose was lowered because of her tenuous    respiratory status.
