Again seen is evidence of post-surgical changes, consistent with posterior decompression and fusion, apparently unchanged since the prior examination and causing multiple metal artifacts, however, there is no evidence of abnormal signal within the thoracic spinal cord at T2 level.
The T2 vertebral body and associated retropulsed methyl methacrylate was better demonstrated on the CT scan from [**2182-7-15**] -- this area is obscured by overlying humerus.
Stabilization hardware extending from the lower cervical through upper/mid thoracic spine.
Please refer to [**2182-7-15**] CT scan for assessment of abnormalities of C2.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
MRI and X-ray imaging revealed evidence of pathological fracture at T2 vertebral body, causing at least 50% of spinal canal stenosis and spinal cord compression.
KUB done [**7-26**] showed dilated loops of bowel.
NGT was kept to low continuous suction.
On [**8-1**] her abdomen was less distended with bowels sounds, NG tube was taken off suction to allow for a diet and see if she tolerates small amounts of food.
