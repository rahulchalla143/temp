[**MD Number(1) 3795**]  HISTORY  OF  THE  PRESENT  ILLNESS:    This  is a 54-year-old gentleman,  who  was  recently  discharged  on  the  13th  of [**Month (only) **]  to  rehabilitation  with multiple medical problems, including  coronary  artery disease, status post [**Female First Name (un) 899**] in [**2115**], congestive  heart  failure with EF of 20% to 30%, status post pericardial  stripping,  prostatic mitral and tricuspid valve placement   in   [**Month (only) 205**],   [**2123**]   for   valve  dysfunction  and constriction  after radiation; ICD placement for nonsustained VT  and  low  ER  inducible  VT.
He had respiratory distress, which was felt to be multifactorial and  in part, due to MRSA pneumonia and CHF.
Hemodynamic monitoring  was  not  possible  secondary  to  the prosthetic tricuspid   valve.
His chest x-ray showed CHF versus ARDS.
He was sent to [**Hospital1 98139**] for further care.
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 76/43 left  arm; 97/44 right arm.
Pulse 80.
Saturation 94% on 100 FIO2.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory revealed the hematocrit of 23.4; platelets  453,000,  white  blood  cell  count of 9.8 with no bands;  sodium  134;  potassium 5.2; chloride 99; bicarbonate 26;  BUN  123;  creatinine  1.5;  glucose  116;  calcium 7.5; magnesium  3.4; phosphorus 5.6; albumin 2.5; INR 1.3; PTT 32; arterial  blood  gas  on  90%  with  FIO2  with  5-cm of PEEP revealed the pO2 of 7.36, pCO2 of 49, pO2 of 56.
Chest x-ray showed  diffuse  alveolar  filling  with  patchy interstitial markings.
The  last echocardiogram revealed an EF of 25 to 35%   with   normal   valve   function;  severe  global  left ventricular hypokinesis; mild right ventricular dilation.
Multiple blood  transfusions  were given to support hematocrit greater than  30.
He had an INR of 4.2.
The INR was brought down to 1.9, at which time  Heparin  was  started.
As  the  patient improved, he started on Coumadin with a target INR of [**4-4**].
Chest CT was performed on the [**11-19**]  to  help  characterize  the  degree  and  extent  of pulmonary  disease.
The CT was notable for consolidation and interstitial disease, which was central sparing the periphery consistent the primary pulmonary process.
Creatinine  ranged  from  1 to 3.
He is clearly sensitive to renal  perfusion  and systolic blood pressure and keeping the hematocrit  above  30  to  maintain good oncotic pressure for renal  perfusion  is necessary for good renal function.
His renal function was very sensitive to blood pressures below 70 to  80, causing acute renal failure with an ATN type picture.
He is now at 200 mcg a day and will need a TSH checked in the near future.,  ISSUE  #5:   Gastrointestinal.
Electrolytes were followed closely.
Potassium was repleted  as  needed, as well as magnesium.
