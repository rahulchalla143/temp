Lumbar puncture x 2  History of Present Illness: 75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple myeloma, presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s this AM in setting of multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR earlier in hospital course.
Concerning her tachycardia, patient had no known history of atrial fibrillation prior to this hospitalization, though has been having episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR starting on Friday [**2112-1-22**].
Unfortunately, there is no telemetry record of this event and no EKG was obtained.
Bone marrow on [**2111-11-30**] showed 60-70% involvement and a follow-up marrow shows 3-5% marrow involvement representing an excellent partial response.
her course in regards to her MM has been complicated by a febrile neutropenia with urine culture positive for VRE on [**2112-1-23**].
In [**11/2110**], she was noted to have further decrement of her hemoglobin down to 9.7.
Her CBC otherwise showed a white count of 4.3 and platelet count of 238,000.
At that time, her creatinine was between 1.3 and 1.4.
She was ultimately referred for further evaluation to hematology and was found to have an elevated immunoglobulin level with an IgG of 2638 and depression of the IgA at 16 and IgM of less than 4.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed which showed 50% infiltration with IgG kappa restricted plasma cells.
Skeletal survey showed osteopenia without evidence of focal lytic lesions and a kappa lambda ratio of free chain assay was 22.
This was complicated by escalation in her creatinine to 3.5.
The patient ultimately underwent a kidney biopsy that was suggestive of myeloma kidney with evidence of light chain cast nephropathy and tubular damage, some of which was felt to be subacute.

CT chest w/out Contrast [**2112-1-25**]: 1.
Upper extremity U/S [**2112-1-26**]: No evidence of DVT .
CT AB/PELVIS [**2112-1-30**] 1.
Clinical correltion with urine analysis and pancreatic enzymes is recommended.
MRI [**1-29**] Multiple small areas of elevated T2 signal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres and left temporal cortex.
If a gadolinium- enhanced examination is undertaken (provided there are no contraindications to its performance) the absence of contrast enhancement would favor infarction over infection.
MRI with gad [**2112-2-3**] No change since the study of [**2112-1-30**].
CT C/A/P with contrast [**2112-2-5**] 1.
TTE [**2112-2-18**] Left ventricular hypertrophy with small cavity size and hyperdynamic systolic function.

TTE showed mild atrial enlargement and small LV size, likely stiff and contributing to poor forward flow and volume overload.
Metoprolol 5 mg IV x 2 and loading the patient with Metoprolol 100 mg TID brought the patient's rate down, however, her periods of agitation caused her heart rate to increase to 150s again.
In terms of anticoagulation, cardiology felt that she would benefit from coumadin since her CHADS 2 score is 4, however, since the patient is a fall risk, she was not anticoagulated with coumadin.
**Will need periodic QTc monitoring while on amiodarone and haldol** .
Head CT was negative for bleed and follow up MRI's showed small vessel infarcts but no acute process or infectious process.
Another lumbar puncture showed no focus of infection.
An EEG showed toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
She underwent an LP and BAL.
CSF did not appear infected and HSV PCR was negative.
MRI did not show infectious process.
PCWP 14, CI 2, SVR 900, Sv02 50.
Her ANC recovered while in the hospital.
Fecal cultures and numerous C. diff tests were negative.
An EEG (test of your brain activity) showed that you were not having seizures.
