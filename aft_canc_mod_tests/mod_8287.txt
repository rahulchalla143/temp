To clarify the morphologic situation, notably for exclusion of a central malignancy, CT should be performed.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 76 152 86 388/416 21 36 50   Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo M with oxygen dependent COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus presenting with shortness of breath found to have large central mediastinal mass with airway effacement as per outside hospital radiology report.
Active Issues: # Squamous cell lung carcinoma:  Patient initially presented to outside hospital with hypoxia secondary to paratracheal mediastinal mass, which on pathology was poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
Most likely secondary to necrotic paratracheal mediastinal mass with airway effacement that was seen on CT from outside hospital.
Interventional pulmonary team consulted and rigid bronchoscopy done on [**2111-7-1**], along with biopsy of lung mass.
#HTN: Initially held home meds and blood pressure was managed with IV and PO meds.
