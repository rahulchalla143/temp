He went to his [**Hospital 6435**] clinic and had a CXR which was negative but was put on antibiotics and analgesics.
He remained well for a few weeks but then suffered 2 syncopal attacks on [**8-8**] and was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Hosputal that day.
At LGH, the patient was found to be neutropenic with 72% lymphocytes and a WBC of 0.5.
He was also anemic with a HCT of 17 and was transfused 2 units of PRBCs.
Further lab tests upon admission included a leukemia/lymphoma eval which yielded abundant myeloblasts with a probable diagnosis of AML.
At LGH, he had a negative CT scan of the head done for dizziness.
CT of the chest and abdomen was performed as part of the lymphoma workup with the following key findings:  1) R paratracheal mass (3.2cm)with BL pleural effusions.
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-16**] for further workup at the request of his wife.

AML: Leukemia/Lymphoma evaluation at outside hospital yielded probable AML.
Fever and neutropenia/ID: High fevers persisted, pt had multiple imaging studies including a CT Chest, Abd Pelvis that revealed multiple splenic and liver nodules and mediastinal LAD.
Pt was seen by ID and pulm (for RLL effusion and mediastinal LAD seen on CT scan).
They asked for several cultures including acid fast bacilli, legionella, etc.
Repeat thoracentesis failed to show further afb growth in culture, was also negative for CMV.
CT chest on [**9-5**] revealed stable nodules but new pericardial effusion.
Repeat AFB smears were neg x 3 and patient was taken off precautions.
Patient was started on Vanc empirically on [**9-17**] as blood cultures from [**9-15**] returned [**2-14**] gram + cocci=coag neg staph and those from [**9-17**].
On [**9-21**], patient underwent a TEE, which was negative for endocarditis, and a mediastinal LN biopsy, which was positive for afb on smear and culture.
Vanc was discontinued as the +blood cultures were thought to be likely contaminates.
[**9-26**], [**9-27**], [**9-29**] AFB smear neg x 3.
Patient underwent repeat thorax CT, which showed enlarging abdominal LN and an increasing number of splenic and liver lesions.
Patient underwent a repeat echo and chest x-ray which showed a small to moderate pleural effusion and a small decrease in the mediastinal LAD.
Cardiology: Patient developed AFib w/ rapid response to 180's, and unstable BP (SBP=90's) - therefore was transferred to the ICU on [**9-11**] where he underwent unsuccessful attempts at cardioversion x3.
An CXR showed an increased interstitial and alveolar infiltrate especially on the R side with positive air bronchograms on the R side.
An emergent ECHO showed no signs of cardiac tamponade.
Abxs were stopped as repeat CXR did not show any signs of infection and WBC was back to normal.
Patient was decreased to 200mg of daily amiodarone on [**10-2**], with monitoring of LFTs and TSH, which were normal.
Echo on [**10-3**] ECHO w/ EF=30%, global LV hypokinesis, and repeat on [**10-9**] shows small-moderate pleural effusion.
CT abd [**8-19**] showed 1.
MRI on [**8-25**] confirmed CT findings and showed potential renal involvement.
Follow-up CT on [**10-2**] showed an increased number of lesions in both liver and spleen (all < 1cm), still thought to be dissemintated TB.
Pulmonary nodules:  Observed on first CT (approx 3mm in size) - thought related to other CT findings at the time (necrotic LNs in mediastinum, liver pancreas and spleen lesions).
A repeat chest CT [**9-18**] showed increased size of pulm nodules 3mm->5mm.
A repeat CT on [**10-2**] showed no change.
Patient was monitored by glucose FS TID and covered with RISS and Lantus.
As it was a concern that his sugars would be difficult to control give his long term steroid use and change in food intake (from TPN to normal diet), the patient's blood glucose levels will be monitored closely when he returns for oncology follow-up.
CXR demonstrated pulmonary congestion, which was likely due to receiving a couple units of blood on the day prior.
Stayed in ICU w/ an uncomplicated hospital course, and was successfully extubated and transferred back to the floor on [**10-1**] where his oxygen saturation remained 98% on room air throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.
A calorie count on [**10-9**] per nutrition showed that patient was eating 1450 calories per day, and TPN was discontinued on [**10-10**].
As such, on [**9-22**] a mixing study was sent (elevated PT), vit K given - mixing study negative.
