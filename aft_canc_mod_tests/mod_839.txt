Pt was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 19970**]/07 for abdominal pain, fevers, and weight loss of 20 pounds in the last year, and in the work-up was found to have multiple enlarging lymph nodes on abdominal CT, the largest being a 1.6cm peri-portal LN.
His cough is non-productive and has been relatively stable over the last few weeks.
Coronary artery disease, status post 4 vessel CABG [**2129**]; -last stress (pyrimadole-MIBI) in [**2139**] with no anginal symptoms or EKG changes, no reversible defects -Echo in Sepetmber [**2143**] revealed LVEF>55% -Cardiac cath in [**2137-12-6**] revealed native 3-vessel disease, patent saphenous vein graft to third obtuse marginal, first diagonal, and right posterior descending artery, a patent left internal mammary artery with a distal left anterior descending artery occlusion.
Ulcerative colitis times 15 years; recent endoscopy showed gastritis in prepyloric region, colonoscopy was normal to the cecum.

Lymphadenopathy may be reactive, however, lymphoma cannot be excluded and a followup chest CT eight weeks after antibiotic therapy is recommended.
Bm Bx [**1-20**]: Morphologic features of a lymphoma, infectious process, or a myelodysplastic syndrome are not seen.
A lymph node biopsy, however, demonstrated focal infiltration by ALK-1 POSITIVE ANAPLASTIC LARGE T CELL (CD30+, CD4+, CD3+/-) LYMPHOMA.
CTA chest [**2144-1-22**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
However, followup chest CT after eight weeks of therapy is recommended to assess the improvement.
CXR [**1-22**]: FINDINGS: Compared with [**2144-1-19**], there is now diffuse increase in pulmonary vascular and interstitial markings bilaterally, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
ECHO [**1-22**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-1-9**], regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is now identified c/w ischemia.
CT Torso [**1-26**]:  .
Stable chest and abdominal lymph nodes  Ct chest [**2-3**]:  Extensive coalescing peribronchial infiltration succeeding ground glass abnormality over six days might represent organizing viral pneumonia, perhaps fibrotic.
Moderate left frontal subgaleal hematoma  [**2-27**] pelvic MRI IMPRESSION: 1.
Discharge labs:   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 63 yo male with a h/o Type II DM, CAD s/p 4v CABG [**2129**] and Ulcerative Colitis who p/w fever/chills/NS/weight loss and enlarging peri-portal lymph nodes on abdominal CT found to be positive for anaplastic T cell lymphoma hospital course c/b NSTEMI and heart failure as well as pneumonia.
The differential on admission included infectious vs neoplastic vs. inflammatory - constitutional symptoms and length of fevers point toward neoplastic, but admitted with evidence of PNA and gallstones, which are potential etiologies of infection.
A TEE was also done to rule out endocarditis which showed no evidence of vegetations.
In addition, blood cultures have all remained negative.
On [**1-17**] a bone marrow biopsy was done given anemia and lymphopenia.
Surgery was consulted on admission as a 1.6cm peri-portal LN was noted on CT and was the largest available for biopsy.
He was started on cipro and flagyl given PNA on chest CT and was shortly switched to Ceftriaxone and azithromycin given persistent fevers.
CTA was negative for PE, but showed a multilobar PNA.
Patient was 90% on NRB, with one set of cardiac enzymes negative, EKG with baseline ventricular ectopy.
He continued to have SOB and no improvement in his sats the following morning and was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency.
Second set of cardiac enzymes was positive for NSTEMI and he was started on heparin gtt.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his oxygenation improved rapidly with supplemental O2.
The last Ct chest looked better and antbiotics were stopped.
As the patient was ready to be transferred out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the final pathology returned from pathology and showed anaplastic lymphoma.
The patient did not have any fever after starting treatment making it very clear that his fevers were [**2-7**] lymphoma.
Upon transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], in the setting of SOB, cardiac enzymes were drawn and patient ruled in for an NSTEMI.
An ECHO was performed which showed worsened wall motion abnormalities and overall worsened pump function.
A follow-up echocardiogram revealed improvement in EF back up from 40% to 50%.
The patient's liver function tests were also elevated and lipitor was held.
Blood cultures were negative throughout.
Once back on the BMT service, a CXR was done which showed a worsening infection despite antibiotic treatment.
Out of concern that he was being inadequately treated Pulmonary was recalled for evaluation of hypoxia and worsening infiltrate.
A bronchoscopy was considered to obtain more tissue, however, as the patient had a recent NSTEMI, they felt that bronchoscopy would be a high risk procedure and would be of low yield.
They did not feel that he was a candidate for a sleep study in his present condition, however they recommended placing him on 2L O2 at night for presumptive sleep apnea.
Urine lytes difficult to interpret given heavy lasix doses.
In the end it was thought that pt had SIADH given the fact that his urine osm was 600-800.
His thyroid and cortisol levels were normal.
NPH 70U at breakfast and 30U at dinner 10.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL PO BID 13.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a work-up of your chronic fevers and were found to have anaplastic lymphoma and a pneumonia.
You should follow-up with cardiology as an outpatient and you will need a cardiac MRI as well.
You must have your blood drawn within 1 week for monitoring of your hematocrit, sodium, liver enzymes and bilirubin.
