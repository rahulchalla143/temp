The patient was feeling in his usual state of health until being incidentally found to have an elevated white blood cell count of greater than 60,000 on routine premarital blood work in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**], where the patient is a native.
He was admitted to a local [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 14285**] hospital for workup, including bone marrow biopsy which was also reviewed in Pathology at [**Hospital1 188**], and demonstrated 100% cellularity with left shifted granulocyte hyperplasia.
The patient arrived from [**Male First Name (un) 36290**] with his fiance and mother to complete pre-transplant evaluation.
The patient feels very well now, and review of systems is negative in detail.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination revealed pupils equal, round and reactive to light, nonicteric.
The neck examination revealed a supple neck with no jugular venous distention, no thyromegaly, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2 normal, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, with no rales, rhonchi or wheezes.
Neurological examination was nonfocal grossly.
The patient received the Cytoxan and TBI for a week prior to getting his transplant on [**2114-9-13**], upon which the patient's ANC and platelets and red blood cells diminished precipitously over the next few days.
The second spike, which was on [**9-19**], was covered with intravenous vancomycin, and the third fever spike, which occurred on [**9-20**], was covered with intravenous AmBisome.
The patient was given Peridex and continued on his anti-fungal regimen, however, this did not diminish the pain.
The nadir of the ANC decrease was a level of 10 on [**2114-9-19**].
The patient's count seemed to be trending upward on [**2114-9-21**], with a level of ANC of 60 and decrease in the patient's throat pain.
The patient required multiple blood transfusions to keep his hemoglobin above 8 and hematocrit above 25.
Additionally, the patient required one unit of platelets on [**2114-9-20**], as his platelet level dropped to 9.
He was transfused to keep his platelet count above 20, as he presented to the hospital with an elevated INR of 1.5, which was thought to be due to a vitamin K deficiency from his recent antibiotic course.
Therefore, we had a higher goal platelet level of 20, and the patient will be transfused accordingly, to keep his level above 20.
Infectious Disease:  The patient, as described above, was spiking fevers regularly after his ANC dropped below 100.
