CT scan performed on [**4-6**] during trauma work up revealed small subarachnoid hemorrhage of the head and also multiple L sided rib fractures ([**3-3**])associated with small left- sided pleural effusion and a small left-sided pneumothorax.
CT scan of the torso incidentally revealed multiple ring-enhancing liver lesions in all lobes of the liver.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from Heme/Onc was consulted as his CT scan results were consistent with carcinoid tumor.
Octreotide scan performed on [**2165-4-11**] showed multiple Octreotide-avid lesions in both hepatic lobes.
This was most likely to his initial fluid load on admission and decreased activity.
