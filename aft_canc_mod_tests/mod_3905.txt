The patient had gone to oncology clinic for scheduled chemo (CD40 inhibitor study drug), when found to have new right-sided chest/shoulder pain, hypoxia to high 80s/low 90s on RA, tachycardia to 120s, and hypotension to 83/58.
In the ED, the patient's initial vitals were afebrile, tachy to 120s, BP 89/60, HR 24, 96% on 4L.
CXR showed persistent right mid lung patchy opacity likely representing resolving pneumonia, with slightly enlarged right- sided pleural effusion.
CTA showed no PE but showed increased R effusion and ground glass opacity likely persistent resolving infection, LLL opacity increased from prior.
CT abd/pelvis without contrast showed no acute process.
Labs significant for lactate 3.1, WBC 16.3 with 12 bands and 64N, Cr 2.4, LDH 262, uric acid 8.2.
On transfer, vitals were T98.9, HR120-150, 103/74, 24-28, 98% on 3L.

------- IMAGING: CTA [**5-2**]: 1.
Mediastinal nodes are also stable, not pathologically enlarged  CT Chest and Neck [**5-17**]: IMPRESSION: No relevant change as compared to the previous examination.
TTE [**5-19**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-4-29**], right ventricle is larger and biventricular systolic function is lower.
CT abdomen and pelvis [**5-21**]: 1.
CT Chest [**2135-5-27**]: IMPRESSION: Mild interval decrease in right pleural fluid.
MRSA Pneumonia, sepsis:  Given the patient's hypoxia and right-sided pleuritic chest pain upon presentation, a CTA was done which failed to find a PE.
On [**5-21**], a CT abdomen was done to investigate diarrhea but ended up noting a loculated effusion at the lung base.
Recommend repeat chest CT in 2 weeks to trend size.
Given his persistent bandemia and recent antibiotics, a C. diff culture was sent and returned positive.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was within normal limits as was TSH.
A TTE was repeated and showed decreased LV and RV function.
CT head and neck were done without contrast to evaluate for progression of disease and did not show any obvious progression.
Patient to have repeat echocardiogram and will follow up with his primary oncologist further treatment.
# FTT, aspiration:  Has been on going since [**11/2134**], head imaging and LP at that time were unrevealing.
He was given swallowing exercises and continued to work with the speech therapy team on techniques to improve his swallowing and allow for eventual advancement of PO intake.
His repeat video swallow on [**2135-5-26**] showed slight improvement but continued aspiration.
