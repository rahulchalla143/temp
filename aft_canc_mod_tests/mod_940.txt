His repeat computer tomography at that time suggested possible enlargement of the nodule.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  He was afebrile at 97.8 degrees Fahrenheit, his pulse was 113, his blood pressure was 146/85, and he was otherwise saturating 97 percent on room air.
The lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally; although the breath sounds were distant.
PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  His preoperative hematocrit was 44.5.
Shortly after he was extubated, the patient became acutely tachycardic and somewhat hypotensive with a mean arterial pressure in the 50s and with a decreasing oxygen saturation.
Therefore, he was re-intubated and an echocardiogram was performed in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit to rule out any sort of cardiac dysfunction.
This showed an ejection fraction of greater than 50 percent.
His hematocrit was otherwise stable, and his chest tube output was normal.
Otherwise, in terms of his Intensive Care Unit stay, his Intensive Care Unit stay was prolonged secondary for a need for blood pressure support on Neo-Synephrine which was weaned, and the Neo-Synephrine was discontinued on postoperative day three.
His chest tubes came out on postoperative day two, and he had no evidence of a significant pneumothorax, and his chest x-ray otherwise looked fine.
He was discharged to home with his prior hematocrit prior to discharge being 33.
Otherwise, his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were 25 and 1.
His pathology was still pending at the time of discharge.
