Two #10 - #19 French [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains were placed in the hilum of the liver to bulb suction.
Bile cultures obtained at the time of surgery from the peritoneum showed GRAM STAIN (Final [**2187-12-2**]):       2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2187-12-6**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
Patient also had Vanco resistant Enterococcus recovered from Bile and fluid cultures on [**12-9**], Sensitive only to Linezolid.
Abdominal CT performed on [**12-6**] to assess status of continuing abdominal tenderness and distention showed interval decrease in the amount of ascites and no evidence of obstruction.
C Diff negative from [**2187-12-11**] Seen by OT/PT.
OT in agreement with team assessment of cognitive impairment, easy distractability and poor insight.
Liver enzymes started to trend down by post op day 3, however, they started to trend back up over the next week.
