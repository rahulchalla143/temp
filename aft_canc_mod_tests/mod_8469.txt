CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-10-1**]  CONCLUSION: Persistent, large mixed density gas and fluid collection presumably representing residual left cerebral hemispheric subdural hemorrhage.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-9-30**]  IMPRESSION: Compared to [**2142-9-28**], there has been no significant interval change of left subdural hematoma and drain in place.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-9-30**]  IMPRESSION: 1.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-9-28**]  IMPRESSION: Status post evacuation of a large left subdural hematoma, with postoperative changes, residual hemorrhage layering posteriorly.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-9-27**]  IMPRESSION: Massive left subdural hematoma as above resulting in approximately 19 mm of rightward midline shift and subfalcine herniation  Brief Hospital Course: 86M transferred from OSH on [**2142-9-27**] for L SDH evacuation and placement of L SDH drain.
Post-op CT showed: postoperative changes with a drain placement in the left-sided subdural hematoma.
Compared to the prior study, there is now some visualization of the sulci at the convexity indicating decreasing mass effect.
His neurologic exam slowly improved and he was following commands with weakness on right.
Head CT after drain removal: Compared to [**2142-9-28**], there has been no significant interval change of left subdural hematoma and drain in place.
Daily, he continued to improve neurologically, and he is being discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to rehab today neurologically improved with his vital signs and laboratory values within normal limits.
