TTE [**3-17**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
INTERPRETATION Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by a Non-Hodgkin lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
PATHOLOGY: SPECIMEN #1: RIGHT AXILLARY LYMPH NODE, EXCISIONAL BIOPSY (SLIDES LABELED S09-1787 FROM [**Hospital3 **], [**Location (un) **], MA; FROM PROCEDURE DATE [**2130-3-8**]) DIAGNOSIS: HODGKIN LYMPHOMA, NODULAR LYMPHOCYTE PREDOMINANT TYPE, SEE NOTE.
HCV VIRAL LOAD (Final [**2130-3-20**]):       HCV-RNA NOT DETECTED.
CMV Viral Load (Final [**2130-3-19**]):       CMV DNA not detected.
HBV Viral Load (Final [**2130-3-27**]):       HBV DNA not detected.
Review of path from OSH axillary LN biopsy was consisitent with nodular LP HL.
Bone marrow biospy was not consistent with bone marrow involvement.
Patient had a splenic biospy at the OSH which was reviewed by [**Hospital1 18**] pathology and found to contain granulomas which were concerning for infectious vs lymphoma-related process.
The patient clearly had significant pain related to his abdominal distention from his spleen which required low dose morphine SR with IR for breakthrough pain.
A bone marrow biopsy showed that your bone marrow was not involved.
You will however need more frequent monitoring of your blood counts and liver function.
