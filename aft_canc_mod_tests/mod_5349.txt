His fever workup performed in the hospital was unremarkable and has since resolved and he now returns for the planned procedure.

Right apical pleural thickening and fullness in the right paratracheal mediastinum are concerning for local tumor extension, but best evaluated by CT scanning.
The reader is refereed to the chest CT and chest x-ray reports for further descriptions regarding these findings.
For further description of these findings, the reader is referred to the chest CT and chest x-ray reports.
Two right-sided chest tubes with suspected small right apical pneumothorax unchanged.
Again seen is an elevated right hemidiaphragm and shift of the mediastinum to the right, with pleural fluid/thickening tracking along the right chest wall, right apex, and medial aspect of the upper right mediastinum.
Focal lucency and fluid level at the right lung apex is compatible with a small hydropneumothorax, unchanged.
MICROSCOPIC Histologic Type:  Large cell undifferentiated carcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted pre-operatively and underwent a pre-op chest x-ray and an MRI of the spine to assess cord invasion of the tumor.
The chest tubes were left in place on water seal and his subcutaneous emphysema and a small stable pneumothorax remained stable and eventually decreased somewhat.
He complained of moderately increasing right chest wall pain on POD4&5 and his pain medications were adjusted accordingly when chest x-rays revealed no underlying pathology.
He was noted to have a gradual development of a post-operative anemia and was transfused on POD2 for a HCT of 21.2.
The work-up was negative and he received the full 2 units at a later time without further complication.
Cultures taken at that time were also negative for an infectious source.
He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in 2weeks with a follow-up chest x-ray.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for constipation.
A chest x-ray should be done at that time.
