Admission Date:  [**2134-8-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-8-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-6-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**] Chief Complaint: Refractory Hypertension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy with biopsy   History of Present Illness: This is a 73 year-old female with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, migraine headaches, who was transferred from [**Hospital3 10377**] hospital for neurosurgical evaluation after a right parietal intracranial hemorrhage was noted on CT scan performed for evaluation of headache.
At [**Hospital1 18**], Preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] of repeat head CT demonstrated right parietal calcifications, with no cerebral oedema, mass effect, or midline shift.
In the ED, initial blood pressure was 205/85.
Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended conservative management, blood pressure control, and no need for seizure prophylaxis.
Tobacco: [**1-13**] pack daily x 50 years, still smoking ETOH: No use Illicts: No use  Family History: Father - died age 58 MI Brother - died age 58 MI Mother - died age 39 ??
Strength 5/5 in upper and lower extremities.
Pertinent Results: Admission Laboratories [**8-17**]: Notable for potassium of 2.5 and creatinine of 1.5.
ECG: Sinus rhythm at 70 bpm, normal axis, normal PR, QRS intervals.
Imaging: Head CT [**8-17**]: IMPRESSION: Three rounded foci, 1-2 mm in size within the right  frontoparietal region and a second focus in the left temporal lobe most likely represent calcium, possibly sequelae from prior infection or inflammation.
If clinically indicated, an MRI could be performed to further characterize this finding.
Air-fluid level within the left maxillary sinus may represent acute sinusitis.
Dedicated evaluation with chest CT is recommended.
Further evaluation with echocardiography is recommended.
_____ [**2134-8-19**] ECHO: normal biventricular systolic function _____ [**2134-8-19**]   Radiology CT CHEST W/CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1.
Due to marked blood pressure differential, MRI/A was obtained to rule out dissection, which ultimately diagnosed a RML lung mass.
Patient underwent bronchoscopy with biopsy confirming adenocarcinoma.
MRI head was obtained for staging purposes and to follow up ?calcifications noted on head ct, now with new diagnosis of lung cancer.
MRI showed possible leptomeningeal metastases.
RENAL ARTERY STENOSIS -Patient initially admitted with difficult to control blood pressure and evidence of atrophic kidney.
Her blood pressure was eventually controlled on 3 agents, however, due to impending nephrotoxic chemotherapy agents, and plan for long term anticoagulation, consideration was given to intervention on arterial stenosis this admit, while she was on a heparin drip.
Cardiology was consulted and evaluation and intervention was recommended, on both her stenosed/occluded subclavian arteries and bilateral renal arteries, to 1. provide better information of her true central pressures, since hypertensive urgency was her presenting complaint and 2. to attempt to maximize her renal preservation in the setting of probable nephrotoxic chemotherapy.
PULMONARY EMBOLISM - small segmental pulmonary embolism was identified on chest ct.
At time of discharge, she had an INR of 3.3, and was instructed to hold one dose, and restart at a lower dose of 3 mg daily.
CKD (III) -kidney function remained stable during admission, patient found to have renal artery stenosis as discussed above.
Please have your INR checked on Thursday or Friday.
After a repeat CT showed that you did not have an acute bleed in your brain, you were transferred to our intensive care unit for the treatment of high blood pressure, which was discovered in the emergency department.
Further evaluation by CT, MRI, and biopsy of the lung mass led to the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer that showed evidence of spread to other parts of your body.
This was completed without complications, and your blood pressure improved following the stenting of your arteries.
