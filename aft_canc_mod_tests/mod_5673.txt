Patient presented with a new LLL consolidation on CT despite recently completing treatment course of meropenem.
CT read as LLL PNA and continued LUL cavity.
He was evaluated by pulmonary and a bronchoscopy was performed on [**8-1**] which showed a large amount of secretions but no obstruction.
BAL was aspergillus ag positive and grew yeast, but serum aspergillus ag and beta glucan were negative.
Pt with supplemental O2 requirements [**8-11**] and CXR noted to have increase in LLL PNA.
CT abdomen showed possible progression of cancer which may indicated decreased response to tarceva.
He was transfused 2 units PRBCs on [**2107-8-9**] prior to going to OR for Hct of 20.
There were no signs of frank bleeding and Hct remained stable.
We will not pursue further workup in setting of hospice care.
Repeat CT abdomen/pelvis showed advancement of disease in liver and lytic components.
Hospice eval Please screen and admit to hospice.
