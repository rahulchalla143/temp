The patient was recently hospitalized for acute pancreatitis in [**9-/2118**] and during her admission her initial chest x-ray revealed evidence of a nodule on the right lung.
A follow up the CT scan showed evidence of diffuse bilateral ground-glass nodularity in both upper lobes and a larger confluent nodule in the right upper lobe with some more dense component and air bronchogram.
Repeat CT scan showed persistence of this 2x3cm nodule.
Follow-up PET/CT scan performed in [**11/2118**] showed nodularity of both upper lobes, however, the larger nodule on the right upper lobe was persistent and had a SUV level of 2.7.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM: Heart rate was 59, respiratory rate was 16, blood pressure 122/88, temperature 98, and oxygen saturation of 99% while breathing room air.

Lung, right middle lobe, wedge resection (G-L): -  Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (0.6 cm).
Lung Cancer Synopsis MACROSCOPIC Specimen Type:  Wedge resection.
CV: Postoperatively, cardiac enzymes were cycled and monitored, and echo was performed, showing LVEF 25% with global hypokinesis.
Her cardiac enzymes (troponin levels) continued to drop.
Repeat TTE on POD#2 revealed LVEF >55%, with intraop cardiac event thought to be a transient episode.
Heme/ID: Post-operatively, the patient was transfused 1U PRBC for Hct 27.7.
CBC was monitored daily.
