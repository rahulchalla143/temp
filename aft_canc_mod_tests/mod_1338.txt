CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2189-11-25**] 1.
Dilatation of the CBD and pancreatic duct, raising the possibility of distal obstruction at the ampullary level due to stone, stricture/stenosis, ampullary or pancreatic head mass.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2189-12-1**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Pathology Reports: AMPULLARY BIOPSY [**2189-11-25**] DIAGNOSIS: Ampullary body biopsy: Fragments of adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.
AMPULLARY BIOPSY [**2189-12-16**] DIAGNOSIS: Ampulla (major papilla), biopsy: 1.
Once his blood grew out gram negative and gram positive rods, the antibiotics were tappered to meropenem, cipro and vanc with renal dosing.
Repeat cxs were NGTD.
On the floor his blood pressure was noted to be increased and he was started on Metoprolol and Amlodipine for control.
LENIs were negative for DVT.
Calculated dead space was 76% with increased esophageal balloon pressure of [**1-18**].
HIT antibody was intially positive with optical density of 1.55.
All heparin products/coated-lines were removed.
EEG was unremarkable and patient's mental status subsequently improved.
# Ampullary Mass:  Patient had an ERCP and was found to have a large ampullary mass with pathology c/w adenoma.
A second ERCP with biopsy was performed, which also showed adenoma.
His SBP goal is 120-140 to allow for adequate renal perfusion.
If his SBP is persistently <120, he will need to discontinue his amlodipine.
