Imaging: [**2136-2-2**] CT AB/PELVIS: IMPRESSION: 1.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Rounded opacity at the right base is unchanged and is felt to correspond to the pleural-based mass seen on the recent CT study consistent with metastatic disease.
A right subclavian Port-A-Cath with its tip unchanged in the distal SVC.
More focal nodularity in the left mid lung is again seen but less well visualized than on the prior study of [**2136-2-2**].

BP was 70/palp in the field per EMS, and HR in 170s.
IV adenosine 6 mg was given in ED and SVT converted to sinus HR 90s, BP 96/60, and mental status immediately improved.
Non-contrast CT showed pericardial effusion, left pleural effusion, increased tumor burden, and stable left hydronephrosis.
Echo showed small pericardial effusion without tamponade.
Discussed with ERCP; they were inclined to do an ERCP to rule out cholangitis, especially given recent fevers and abdominal pain.
However, primary oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was opposed to any procedures since she is clinically improving, the ultrasound was negative, and the white count was coming down.
After discussion with Ms. [**Known lastname 9955**] and the family, ERCP/EUS was not done and she was discharged to rehab with frequent LFT checks because ALP and GGT continued to increase.
She was given carboplatin AUC5 and paclitaxel 175mg/m2 [**2136-2-6**] for the rapid rate of progression with tumor tracking down left ureter causing mild/moderate hydronephrosis.
CXR negative.
Cipro, metronidazole, and vancomycin stopped after 1st dose, then cipro/vanco restarted [**2136-2-5**] due to recurrent fever, but stopped again [**2136-2-6**].
Repeat CXR unchanged.
Retic count 3.3 with very high LDH.
Urine Na 62 (high), but she appeared hypovolemic and was orthostatic.
Cardiac ischemia (heart muscle damage) due to the initial rapid heart rate.
You were given a heart rhythm medication called adenosine and the heart rate and normal quickly became normal.
Cardiac enzymes were elevated suggesting strain on your heart when it was beating rapidly.
A CT scan showed marked progression of ovarian cancer, so you were restarted on chemotherapy.
Liver function tests became markedly abnormal.
An ultrasound of the liver and gallbladder showed no abnormalities other than gallstones, and did not show an infection or bile duct blockage.
After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], no further testing or procedures were done and the liver function tests will be followed closely.
You were also given a blood transfusion for anemia (low red blood cell count).
Your thyroid tests were significantly abnormal suggesting you were not taking your thyroid medication.
