In the ER he had a head CT that showed a posterior contusion.
He was seen by neurosurgery who recommended a repeat CT in [**1-20**] hours.
He was also noted to have a creatinine of 4.2 and sodium of 160.
WBC was noted to be 63.5 with 75 lymphs.
UA showed trace leuks, moderate blood, 6-10 wbcs and [**4-1**] epis.

Again as noted on the cervical spine CT of earlier today, there is an ill-defined sclerotic lesion in the posterior arch of C1, which could represent metastatic disease given the history of recently diagnosed prostate  MRI C-Spine The MR study confirms the findings on CT, namely multilevel cervical spondylosis extending from the C3-4 through C6-7 levels.
There is no definite sign for the presence of alignment abnormalities of the cervical spine, in [**Location (un) **] with the CT scan.
As was noted on CT as well, there is a heterogeneous T1 and to a lesser extent T2 signal pattern within the bone marrow, which could represent degenerative changes.
MRI head Small isointense T1 and hypointense T2 left tentorial lesion most consistent with a meningioma based on signal intensity values.
If a more definitive diagnosis is needed, a repeat limited MRI with axial T1, gradient echo and T2 images may be obtained in one week to assess for change in the appearance of the lesion,  that would typically be seen with a hemorrhage, but not a meningioma.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 81 YOM with CLL, prostate cancer s/p brachiotherapy, who was admitted with a head injury, hypernatremia, and renal failure .
CT neck showed some degenerative changes and question of small sclerotic lesion at C1, but no dislocation.
MRI of that area revealed some marrow hyperintensity and degenerative changes.
CT head showed a stable hyperdensity which proved to be a likely meningioma on MRI.
His Cr declined from 4.2 to 1.7 on discharge.
This should be restarted by his primary care physician once his creatinine has stabilized.
Given his h/o esophageal stricture and a speech and swallow evaluation mentioning gagging the gastroenterology service was consulted.
No LAD was seen on examIron studies did not reveal iron deficiency; Coombs test was negative; hemolysis labs were normal.
As above a CT scan mentioned sclerotic C1 lesion which was not apparent on MRI, however it did show some marrow hyperintensity.
