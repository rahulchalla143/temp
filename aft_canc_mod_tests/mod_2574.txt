A follow-up CAT scan of the chest in [**2166-3-26**] originally had shown a 6.5 cm left upper lobe mass and a 3.5 cm lobulated right upper lobe mass.
He consequently underwent fluoroscopic biopsy of the right-sided mass which showed adenocarcinoma.
Bronchial biopsy of the left upper lobe showed poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma with squamous differentiation.
Metastatic work-up of the head, bone, and abdomen was negative.
His laboratory studies remained relatively normal.
The follow-up imaging showed marked regression of his tumor.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 7.0, hematocrit 38, platelet count 351; BUN 17, creatinine 0.8, sodium 141, potassium 3.9, chloride 100, carbon dioxide 28; liver function tests within normal limits; FEV1 was 44% of the predicted value.
He was transfused with 2 U of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 23.6.
Chest x-ray obtained at that time, showed left lower lobe collapse/consolidation but appeared relatively unchanged.
His chest x-ray showed some interval improvement.
His hematocrit remained stable.
He was transfused again with one unit of red blood cells.
He continued to be afebrile with stable blood pressure and heart rate.
