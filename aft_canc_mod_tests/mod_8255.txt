Of note, patient was recently d/c'ed from [**Hospital1 2025**] on [**9-30**] after NSTEMI with trop to 0.25 complicated by cardiac catherization in which rotoblade became lodged in the left circumflex.
ECG at this time showed STDs in V1-V5, II, III, and aVF.
ECG showed ST depressions in V3-V6.
Labs and imaging significant for lactate 4.1, trop 0.65, glu 381 with gap 13, UA with trace ketones and large glucose, calcium 10.9, WBC 2.5, Hct 30.8, Plt 92, and INR 1.4.
CXR showed small bilateral effusions and some vascular fullness.
Vitals were 98.1, 80, 127/82, 12, and 97% on 2L.

Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance including tortuous aorta.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Based on [**2157**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in 1 year.
Based on [**2161**] ACCF/AHA Thoracic Aortic Guidelines, if not previously known or a change, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in 1 year; if previously known and stable, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**2-25**] years.

EKGs: 2-3mm ST depressions in V3-V6 on admission; these decreased to ~1mm ST depressions on discharge when patient was asymptomatic  Brief Hospital Course: 76M with extensive hx of CAD including multiple CABG with most recent cath on [**9-23**] c/b rotorblade impaction in the LCx presents to ED with chest pain, elevated troponin, and EKG changes.
We continued his home BB (Metop tartrate 50 [**Hospital1 **], which was eventually switched to metop succinate XL 100mg daily), [**Last Name (un) **] (Valsartan 20 daily), and statin (pravastatin 80mg, increased from home dose of 40mg daily).
On day of discharge, pt was without CP or SOB; he was breathing room air, had flat neck veins, trace ankle edema, and his lung sounds were clear.
# Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF:  No change in LVEF on repeat ECHO (40%).
CXR showed significant acute pulmonary edema which resolved over the next several days with diuresis.
Electrolytes were stable and wnl during the diuresis.
# DM2: Patient was on high doses of home insulin with blood sugar in 300s and glucose in his urine.
TRANSITIONAL - Will need to avoid prior chemotherapy regimen (he has appointment with Dr.[**Name (NI) 7517**] the day following discharge) - Will need to follow his blood sugar control with outpatient PCP and home [**Name9 (PRE) 269**] - Will send d/c summary to cardiologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 79852**] at [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 745**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 20468**] (he has an appointment with him in early [**Month (only) 359**]) - Patient is confirmed DNI/DNR  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
