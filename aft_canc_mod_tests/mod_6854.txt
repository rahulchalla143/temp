A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
This MRI was compared with her prior MRI and it was found that the abscess had increased in size and in mass effect/edema.
Her neurologic exam appeared improved compared to prior OMR notes.
She has a follow-up appointment with neurosurgery scheduled for [**2138-9-9**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and a CT brain as well on [**2138-9-9**].
She should have a follow-up brain MRI on [**8-25**] or [**8-26**] (this can be scheduled at [**Hospital 61392**] Center or at [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 327**]) - whichever is more convenient.
