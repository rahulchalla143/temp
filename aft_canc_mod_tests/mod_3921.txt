In the ED inital vitals were T 100.5, HR 100, BP 108/71, RR 20 and 100% on RA.
Labs were notable for WBC of 10.6 w/ 0% bands, h/h 9.3/28.3, AST/ALT 67*/100*, alkphos 275* T.bili, 4.4* Lipase of 93 and lactate of 1.1.
CXR showed white out of the RLL (ddx collapse, post obstruction pneumonia vs diaphragmatic collapse) w/ a superimposed right pleural effusion/pleural thickening.
CT torso demonstrated large low density metastases in the chest on the right w/ a 13cm x 11cm mass collapsing the right lower lobe and compressing the right atrium, shifting the mediastinum to the left.
On arrival to the ICU, VS were T 97.8 HR 90 BP 153/90 RR 20 satting 100% on 15L NRB.
Family History: Significant for diabetes in her mom  Physical Exam: Admission exam: VS: 97.8; 90; 153/90; 23; 100% on NRB GEN: A&O, NAD, accessory muscle usage HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes dry CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation left, no breath sounds on the right except in apex.

An opacity projects over the left mid lung zone.
MRI may be performed to further assess.
# Respiratory distress/lung metastasis: Patient presented with worsening dyspnea and cough, and was found on CXR and CT scan to have large occlusive mass on the right side, most likely metastatic disease from prior known sarcoma.
Thoracic surgery, IP, radiation-oncology and hematology-oncology all consulted and presented various treatment options, with surgery as the most likely definitive care.
