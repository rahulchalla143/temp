He had a left heart cath that found 3VD and had 3 BMS placed to LAD, 1 proximal and 2 to the mid LAD on [**2149-12-24**].
Trop T was elevated to 0.12 and EKG showed no ischemic changes.
He had a CTA showing no PE.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In our ED, initial vitals were T 96.2 HR 99 BP 105/73 RR14 SaO2 97%.
He was given vancomycin and zosyn, and blood cultures were sent.
On arrival to the floor his vitals were T 100.7, HR 114, BP 108/65, SaO2 99% on 2L.
He was given 1 liter NS, then given demerol for the rigors and his BP dropped to 90s.
His EKG showed some mild STE vs J point elevation changes in the anterior leads, cardiology felt it was not consistent with a instent thormbosis.
Physical Exam: On admission: VS: temp- T- 101.4 HR- 130 BP 106/60 RR-15 Sat- 99% 2 liters GENERAL: NAD.
TTE [**2149-12-23**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the anterior septum, inferior septum, anterior free wall, lateral wall, and apex.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-11-19**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is further reduced.
CARDIAC CATH [**2149-12-24**]: 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial pressure of 96/73 mmHg.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenoses.

Multiple bilateral sub-4 mm pulmonary nodules are better demonstrated on prior CT from [**2149-12-13**].
Pt has known lingular opacity seen on prior imaging last week, as well as OSH imaging that confirmed this finding that in the past was thought to be a Aspergillus infection, since the Ag was positive and B-glucan was present.
OSH CTA was negative for PE.
