Upon arrival patient was found to have an oxygen saturation in the 70s, was cyanotic, discovered on imaging to have a large right sided pleural effusion with white-out of the right hemithorax.
Patient also had a white blood cell count of 20.5 with 89 percent polys.
Subsequent CT of the chest showed complete obstruction of the right main stem bronchus with right effusion and total right lung collapse.
Patient also was severely hypercapnic on presentation with pCO2 of 85 and a pH of 7.2.
Patient also had endobronchial biopsies of this right main stem lesion.
Patient's oxygenation and ventilatory status were stabilized and he was transferred here for further evaluation and management and possible stenting procedure of his right main stem bronchus.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.6, blood pressure 105/62, heart rate 94, respirations 16, oxygen saturation 94 percent on 50 percent FIO2.
Vent was SIMV mode 500 cc, 12 breaths per minute, pedal volumes are about 350 cc, pressure support was 8, PEEP was 10, FIO2 50 percent.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  plethoric edematous face, anicteric, pupils equal, round, reactive to light.
LABORATORY DATA:  At the outside hospital - white count 11.9, hematocrit 32.5, platelets 358, 89 percent polys, 4 percent lymphocytes.
INR 0.9.
PTT 26.8.
Sodium 131, potassium 5.5, chloride 93, bicarbonate 33, BUN 16, creatinine 0.6, glucose 141, albumin 2.1, total protein 6.1, total bilirubin 0.6, direct bilirubin 0.1, alkaline phosphatase 97, ALT 34, AST 30, LDH 139.
CK peak was 95, 26 upon transfer.
CEA was 1.9.
Troponin I was initially 0.15 with a peak of 2.0 which decreased back down to 0.9 upon transfer.
Pleural fluid: glucose72, LDH 139, amylase 27, total protein 3.9, pH 8.0, hazy, white blood cell count [**Pager number **], red blood cells 3,850, 82 percent polys, 16 percent lymphocytes, 2 percent monocytes.
CT of the chest showed extremely large right sided pleural effusion with right lung collapse suspicious for underlying tumor, right chest tube in place, moderate size left pleural effusion with subsequent atelectasis, posterior left lung and lingula.
Chest x-ray shows significant change from prior films with large right pleural effusion opacifying entire right hemithorax.
Electrocardiogram showed diffusely low voltage, normal sinus rhythm at 65, flat T waves throughout, T waves in V1 through V3.
Pathology from right main stem endobronchial biopsy at [**Hospital3 **] came back positive for nonsmall cell lung cancer, poorly differentiated.
Cytology from 3 cc of pleural fluid came back negative for malignancy.
Endobronchial biopsy performed at [**Hospital1 **] - 3 cc of right effusion sent for cytology which was negative for malignancy.
Right main stem bronchial biopsy came back positive for nonsmall cell lung cancer, poorly differentiated.
2) Nonsmall cell lung cancer newly diagnosed, likely stage 4 as CT scan shows left adrenal fullness.
Head CT was negative.
Bone scan to be done [**12-12**] for full staging procedure.
Chest CT showed evidence of left adrenal fullness and superior vena cava syndrome with associated nonobstructing superior vena cava clot.
Pleurodesis planned for right lung [**12-12**].
Heparin drip started for evidence of clot in the superior vena cava and possible clot in the right atrium on CT scan.
He underwent catheterization prior to stenting procedure which revealed non-intervenable three vessel disease.
He continued to have several episodes of stable ventricular tachycardia and his potassium and magnesium were repleted aggressively.
Electrocardiogram upon transfer here showed new Q waves in leads 1 and AVL and cycle troponins were decreasing here.
