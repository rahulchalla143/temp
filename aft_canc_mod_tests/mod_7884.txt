Imaging/results: CXR [**2-8**]: LUL consolidation, mod pulm edema, R PICC .
RUQ US [**2-4**]: 1.
[**2-4**] CT Chest: 1.
Nonspecific soft tissue stranding in the left upper quadrant, new from prior study but difficult to assess without oral contrast.
Consider CT of the abdomen for more complete assessment, if warranted clinically.
[**2-2**] Echo: EF 55%, mod pulm HTN.
Pt initially did well first night, but then had rapidly worsened hypoxia am of [**2181-1-28**] with CT chest showing new multilobar consolidations.
Resp cultures grew MSSA and Abx changed to nafcillin to complete 3week course per ID (until [**2-18**] via R PICC).
Of note, during hospitalization, pt had some LFT elevation with US/CT showing sludge but no evidence of cholecystitis and this was likely [**1-29**] acute illness and possible TPN which he recieved for few days (improving by time of discharge).
Also developed Anemia 12-->8 w/o gross evidence of bleeding or hemolysis, s/p 1U prbc [**2-9**] with hgb stable 9s thereafter.
Some concern initially with persistant leukocytosis/fevers and CT with persistant L>>R pleural effusions concerning for parapneumonic effusions but white count finally down.
Leukocytosis: as above, 20s for several days, today down to 12, as above, concern for parapneumonic effusions but holding [**Female First Name (un) 576**] as above with repeat CXR in 1week.
Anemia and thrombocytosis: baseline hgb 12s, here 9-->7s s/p 1U prbc [**2-9**], now 9s.
No obvious bleeding or hemolysis but was acutely ill. -Fe studies will be unreliable since got blood t/f, hold supp since Fe load with transfusion -will need to be followed as outpt -as for thrombocytosis, likely reactive (anemia, illness) and post-splenectomy .
Please follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**3-6**] as scheduled so that she can make sure you are stable, you will need repeat Chest xray as well.
