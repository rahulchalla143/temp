He originally presented with neck pain and in [**4-12**] underwent direct laryngoscopy with a biopsy of a pyriform sinus mass diagnostic of SSC.
Labs were consistent with SIADH, with the acute exacerbation thought to be a consequence of his platinum based chemotherapy.
His sodium improved with 1L fluid restriction and NaCL tablets to 126 on discharge.
A lump developed in the area and he was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] and laryngoscopy demonstrated a post-cricoid hypopharyngeal lesion and was referred to have a CT scan of the neck.
The CT scan of the neck revealed an enhancing mass in the right pyriform sinus with extensive conglomerate adenopathy in the right level 2 and level 3 nodes.
Biopsy of the mass was positive for squamous cell carcinoma.
On [**2197-4-13**] he underwent direct laryngoscopy and biopsy of right pyriform sinus lesion and rigid esophagoscopy.
He had a biochemical recurrence in [**2194**], status post salvage radiation therapy and has since followed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with anundetectable PSA in [**2196-11-3**].

# Squamous cell carcinoma of right pyriform sinus: Pt was discharged on C2D2 of TPF (taxotere, cisplatin, 5-FU).
He received Taxotere 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on admission.
He received hypertonic saline while the chemo was administered and his sodium remained above 123.
Sodium was 127 on discharge and was never below 123.
He will continue a 1 liter fluid restriction and start Lasix 20mg PO to keep his sodium up at home.
You tolerated the chemotherapy well and your sodium levels remained at your baseline.
The following changes were made to your medication regimen: - Lasix was started to help keep your sodium level normal - Enalapril was decreased to 5mg twice a day.
