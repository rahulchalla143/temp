He appeared volume overloaded on exam and had an elevated BNP.
CXR with ?PNA/effusion.
He has been getting progressively weaker and his weight is increasing.
Went for weekly blood check this AM and HCT 27, but K 5.5 and Cr 2.5.
- PAF, not on coumadin - Echo [**2140**]: EF 60%, 1+MR, mod PA HTN - s/p CCY, Appy - BPH - PPD+ [**2131**], no treatment   Social History: The patient formerly lived in [**Country 532**] moved to approximately 10 years ago with his wife and family.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 95.5, BP 90/50, 72, 10, 95 % RA, Weight 151 lbs., GEN: Russian speaking elderly male, NAD, cachectic, ashen-colored skin HEENT: clear OP, dry MM.
Pertinent Results: CXR [**2142-10-26**]: Enlarging moderate left pleural effusion, stable right pleural effusion.
CXR [**2142-10-22**]: New bilateral small pleural effusions and mild fluid overload.
Echo [**2142-9-28**]: LVEF 35-40%.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2141-7-11**], left ventricular systolic function is now abnormal.

His creatinine did not improve during the course of his admission.
2) Systolic congestive heart failure: The patient was volume overloaded on exam (elevated JVP and LE edema, and effusion on CXR) and was therefore diuresed with IV lasix.
IVF boluses did help to keep bp up, but due to poor cardiac function and tendency toward 3rd-spacing fluids, this was not an effective measure for long-term pressure support.
Several episodes of desaturation into the high-80s prompted a repeat CXR which revealed worsening bilateral pleural effusions.
was evaluated by both cardiology and renal, and his poor cardiac function was felt to be due to multi-vessel coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy due to iron overload (from multiple transfusions for MDS).
