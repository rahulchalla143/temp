Correlation with clinical history and possible CT of the chest may be helpful in further evaluation.
CT chest/abd/pel [**2-15**]: 1.
TTE [**2-17**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-12-5**], no major change is evident.
Note: Recommend submission of additional fluid for cell   block preparation and additional studies .
Trichrome stain shows no increase in fibrosis.
Iron stain shows no stainable iron.
Pt presented with significant leukocytosis with WBC > 30K.
TTE showed no evidence of endocarditis and blood cultures promptly cleared after initiation of treatment.
# hyperbilirubinemia - The Liver consult service followed this patient during her time in-house, during which her workup included a liver MRI, which showed diffuse hepatitis with no nodules, a tap, which suggested hepatic ascites.
Cytology showed possible atypical cells that could have been worked up with more fluid (>1L) but there was not enough left to tap.
An IR-guided liver biopsy was performed, which demonstrated zone 3 necrosis consistent with a toxic hepatitis.
Her LFTs/bili were somewhat improved at discharge but still significantly elevated.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO once a day.
After discussion with our liver specialists, we conducted numerous tests, including an MRI and a paracentesis (sample of abdominal fluid).
These tests suggested your liver was severely inflamed but did not clearly show what the cause of the inflammation was.
A liver biopsy was performed.
The preliminary report from this biopsy shows no evidence of cancer.
The biopsy results suggests that the liver injury was from a toxic ingestion; we suspect an herbal medication you were taking may have caused this.
