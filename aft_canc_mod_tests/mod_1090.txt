EVENTS: [**2154-4-2**] = Patient became hypotensive w/SBP in 60-70s wtih some response to fluid boluses.
Has had approx 2.5Liters via 500cc boluses with his pressures holding in 90's and HR in 80s.
Patient's creatinine bumped to 2.3, and his urine output dropped.
EKG was unchanged, but cardiac enzymes were cycled and CK were mildly elevated.
Mid day it was reported that a temp of 100.6 had not been recorded on the vitals sheet.
A potential septic workup was initiated as a source of the hypotension w/ CXR (?
Blood and urine cultures sent and initiation of Zosyn and Vancomyocin empirically.
We increased his morphine to 2-4mg from 2mg, however [**Month/Day/Year 2449**] have been informed to give judisciously if signs of respiratory depression/somnolence.
BP 105, mentation okay, o2 sats stable on 3 liters at 94% (note has EF 30%).
Heparin drip started, cardiac enzymes cycled.
Patent LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM2.
Graft angiography revealed a patent LIMA->LAD and a patent SVG->OM2.
Final angiography revealed 30% residual stenosis, no dissection.
Echo ([**4-1**]) with EF 25% (see data) with mild pulm HTN and 1+MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] had been on toprol xl 200 daily, changed to metoprolol 50 po bid.
Daily weights, I/Os, and 2 gram Na diet were maintained He was approximately 3300cc negative after lasix and zaroxoyn (given during red cell infusion) and nitro gtt.
Discharge weight of 102 kg, 94% on 2L NC.
- Aspirin - metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **]  (titrate to HR of 80 or less) - plavix 75 daily - He was started on a statin and low-dose ACE-I.
-Will monitor CK on statin - No fevers x 48 hours at time of D/C.
- Blood cultures Negative to date.
Urine cultures NTD ___________________________________________________________ ## DYSPNEA: probably mostly related to decomp HF on top of underlying restrictive lung disease (home O2 baseline 3liters) and ?
Repeating BP usually with normal values.
His baseline SBP is in the 90s-100s.
On D/C BP was 100/60 with HR in the 80s-90s.
Echo w/o effusion, with EF 25%.
