His breathing improved with rest, but he contined to have DOE over the weekend.
A CTA showed a "large saddle embolus, involving all lobes, likely small L lower lobe infarct."
VS on transfer were HR 115s, SBP 130-140 and stable, and O2 sat of 92% on 2L.
In the ED inital vitals were, T 98.1 HR 120 BP 96/57 RR 16 O2 sat 95% 6L NC.
A bedside echo was done which was significant for RV strain, with RA dilatation.
His BP remained stable and he was admitted to the ICU.
?Chronic HCV - reported was found to have positive Ab but negative VL, no bx, no treatment.

CXR [**10-20**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process .
ECHO [**10-21**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Agitated saline contrast study is consistent with the presence of an intracardiac shunt (likely stretched patent formamen ovale or small atrial septal defect).
2.6 x 2.9 x 4.3 cm left hepatic lobe mass, equivocally seen on the single-phase reference CT examination from [**2104-10-20**].
An abdominal MR examination is recommended for further evaluation of this lesion.
MRI abdomen: IMPRESSION: 1.
5mm cyst in the tail of the pancreas, given the patient's age, recommend follow-up with repeat MRCP in 1 year.
Oxygen saturation remained mid 90s on 6L nasal cannula initially; he was weaned to 5L by time of transfer to floor.
EKG did not show evidence of right heart strain.
TTE showed normal EF >55%, mildly dilated right ventricle with normal free wall contractility, mildly dilated aortic root, as well as intracardiac shunt (likely patent formamen ovale or small atrial septal defect).
Hypercoagulability work-up was deferred for outpatient.
He remained on therapeutic lovenox till the morning of [**10-26**] as his INR was 2.0 on [**10-25**] and [**10-26**] it was 2.2 with a dose of 5mg coumadin.
He will be discharged on 5mg coumadin daily with planned anti-coagulation monitoring through his pcp's office.
He was not hypoxic at rest but with activity such as walking his saturation was in the mid 80s.
INR was elevated to 1.5 prior to initiation of coumadin, albumin was normal.
RUQ was obtained that showed ill defined hepatic lobe mass and coarse liver echotexture concerning for fatty infiltration or cirrhosis/fibrosis.
MRI of the liver was obtained to further evaluate that showed cirrhosis and hemangioma  #Pancreatic Tail Cyst: found incidentally on MRI of liver --recommended to have repeat MRCP in 1 year  #Incidentally found R adrenal nodule (7mm) found on MRI of liver --defer further workup to PCP as an outpatient  #Splenic infarct-Pt was found to have a small ASD vs. stretched PFO on echo.
He will need continued evaluation in the outpatient setting.
Work-up included RUQ ultrasound and liver MRI per above.
Platelet count remained stable despite heparin products making HIT unlikely.
Pt initially had random blood glucose of 235 and he was started on a sliding scale.
This was further evaluated with a hemoglobin A1c was 5.9.
Discharge Medications: 1. home oxygen therapy 2L NC with ambulation to keep saturation above 88% indication: hypoxia below 88% with ambulation (low of 84 with activity) 2. warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)).
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 18323**] fax [**Telephone/Fax (1) 18324**]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: acute saddle pulmonary embolus ETOH cirrhosis splenic infarct thrombocytopenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred from another hospital for continued evaluation and management of a large pulmonary embolus (blood clot).
You will need regular blood tests to monitor your INR (how thin your blood is) and the goal should be between 2 to 3.
Please call your doctor to arrange these blood tests and adjustment of your coumadin dose.
You would benefit from continued evaluation of a liver specialist as well.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1) Recommend repeat MRCP in one year to evaluate 5mm cyst found in tail of pancreas 2)management of anticoagulation 3)evaluation by hepatologist for possible cirrhosis and varices 4)evaluation by hematologist for possible hypercoag workup.
