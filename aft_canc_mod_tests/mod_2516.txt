He was recently noted to have a rise in his PSA to the 400 range, and a L-spine MRI on [**11-14**] showed multiple spine metastatic foci (no prior MRI L-spine for comparison, bone scan in [**6-/2168**] without clear spine metastases).

CXR (PA and lat) [**2-7**]: The cardiac silhouette, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal and stable.
Clot in the left greater saphenous vein.
A scrotal ultrasound was significant for no signs of torsion, normal doppler studies, and massive amounts of subcutaneous edema.
Although it was noted that his lower extremity and scrotal edema improved slightly after the repeat thrombectomy and tPA, it was agreed upon by the medical, oncologic, and radiology teams that a repeat IVC venogram with repeat thrombectomy and tPA would be performed to help evaluate IVC flow and to improve the pt's chances of post-procedure success.
The repeat venogram revealed good flow through the IVC from the prior thrombectomy and a repeat thrombectomy with tPA administration was performed.
However, a UA that was sent for culture studies did come back positive, and the patient was started on cipro.
A urine sediment showed many WBC and WBC casts and was thought to be consistent with AIN.
A renal US was negative for renal vein thrombosis as well as a MRI/MRA of the kidneys.
His electrolytes were within normal limits and a PCO2 was wnl as well.
LFTs and an ammonia level were wnl.
Cardiac enzymes remained negative and multiple EKGs were without ischemic changes.
A V/Q scan was performed that showed a low likelihood of PE.
You will need to take this daily and have your kidney function tests checked within 1 week of discharge.
