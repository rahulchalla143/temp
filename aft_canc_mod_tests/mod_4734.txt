Today roughly 15 hours into his stay at the rehab facility he was hypotensive to the 70's with a HR of 130's in AFIB.
He was taken to [**Hospital3 **] where he was given one dose of IV lopressor and cardioverted with return of blood pressures and resolution of his chest pain.
In our ED initial vitals were 98.7 64 98/52 14 100% 4L NC.
Labs were notable for a low glucose of 66, a troponin of .44, and a lacatate of 1.4.

SPECIATION AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING OF DAPTOMYCIN AND LINEZOLID          REQUESTED BY DR. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2482**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Daptomycin Sensitivity testing performed by Etest.
ECHO [**2178-1-6**] The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2177-11-3**], pericardial effusion is probably larger.
Short-term clinical and echocardiographic follow-up for stability of pericardial effusion is recommended.
Cardiac Cath [**2178-1-7**] 1.
CT Chest with Contrast [**2178-1-8**] 1.
Trans Esophageal Echo [**2178-1-12**] No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).

PENDING RESULTS Pericardial Fluid Cytology Pending Abdominal Fluid Cytology Pending Final Culture data from Blood, Urine, Pericardial Fluid and Abdominal Fluid not all finalized  Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE This is a 77 year old gentleman with complex medical issues, including recent hospitalization for medically managed cholecystitis, presenting with chest pain, found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and admitted to Medicine.
# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: Echo performed on admission demonstrated large circumferential pericardial effusion, no evidence of tamponade.
It was noted that his pericardial fluid changed in nature from serous to cloudy pink thick fluid.
Studies were consistent with an exudative effusion and culture grew vancomycin resistant enterococcus.
Furthermore, blood and urine cultures were negative throughout his hospital stay.
A TEE was negative for evidence of valvular vegetations.
Repeat imaging showed the effusion was resolved and the pericardial drain was removed.
Echocardiogram revealed an enlarged pericardial effusion (details above).
His blood pressure was supported with phenylephrine.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-Stim test was negative for adrenal insufficiency.
Additionally, albumin of 1.7 so likely has poor intravascular osmotic pressure.
Given his history of recent medically-managed cholecystitis, and known intra-abdominal fluid collections, a CT torso was obtained to investigate potential sources of infection.
Serial blood and urine cultures were negative.
His hypotension resolved, and he was weaned off phenylephrine prior to discharge.
Given our clinical concern for sepsis, a RUQ ultrasound was obtained and demonstrated a sludge-filled gallbladder and a small, unchanged fluid collection.
CT torso demonstrated stranding, concerning for acute cholecystitis.
Surgery was consulted and recommended HIDA scan given low suspicion on physical exam.
HIDA scan was positive and a percutaneous drain was attempted; however, the procedure was complicated by collapse of the gallbladder (inconsistent with acute cholecystitis) and development of a small hematoma.
A drain was placed in the abdominal fluid collection, which appeared to be an old hematoma.
Microbiology was sent and was negative for growth.
Culture of the catheter tip revealed no growth.
Hct trended down initially on admission and was stable around 20 at the time of discharge.
