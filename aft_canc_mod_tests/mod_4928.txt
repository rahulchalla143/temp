C DIFF NEGATIVE X 3 BLOOD CX [**2136-9-11**]: NO GROWTH URINE CX [**2136-9-10**]: CONTAMINATED.
COLON BX PATHOLOGY: PENDING .
CXR [**2136-9-10**]: PA AND LATERAL CHEST: Compared to [**2136-8-2**].
The left- sided single lumen chest port was noted to have an access needle in place underneath the transparent dressing.
(A DSA venogram was performed and recorded.)
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Airway patent to the segmental level.
Contrast-enhanced portion through the abdomen demonstrates a nodular liver with volume redistrubution with patchy perfusion of the peripheral aspect of the right lobe, and it is difficult to exclude an infiltrating lesion, especially in segment V/VI.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is circumferential mural thickening around the proximal sigmoid, concerning for primary colon cancer.
BONE WINDOWS: There are diffuse degenerative changes and evidence of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis involving the thoracic levels anteriorly, but no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
IMPRESSION: 1) 4-cm segment of circumferential wall thickening involving the proximal sigmoid colon, presumably corresponding to the concerning mass seen on colonoscopy.
3) Heterogeneous perfusion of the peripheral right lobe of the liver, most prominent in segment VI; difficult to exclude an infiltrating lesion; additionally there are several small hypoattenuating lesions in both lobes, too small to characterize; MRI is recommended for further characterization.
He will need continued PT but is non-weight bearing on the left lower extremity.
He had been transfused preop for hct 27, given history of bleeding with surgery but postop hct 26.
Patient was hypotensive to sbp 70s-80s requiring ICU admission for levophed to maintain MAP > 60.
Suspect component of anesthesia, pain med, and blood loss were all contributors.
His hematocrit slowly trended down on the floor with guaic positive stool and minimal bleeding on the bandage.
GI was consulted and did a colonoscopy in house which showed an erythematous, friable, protruding, malignant appearing circumferential mass with ulceration and contact bleeding in the mid sigmoid at 30 cm.
Surgery was consulted and recommended a CEA and CT scan.
CT torso shows no clear mets but possible liver lesions which will be assessed intraoperatively by biopsy or ultrasound if the patient wishes to pursue operative treatment.
Currently, pathology is pending.
Hematocrit will need to be rechecked in 2 days (29.2 prior to discharge).
EGD showed erythema, granularity, and congestion in the stomach body compatible with gastritis and gastric erosion with active oozing of blood.
IR study shows port is not in proper position and in a low flow vessel.
HIT antibody was negative and DIC panel unremarkable.
# Coagulopathy: INR also slightly elevated preop, as well as PTT.
# H/O ETOH abuse: Patient had no requirement for benzos on his CIWA scale.
This can be restarted if his creatinine is stable in 2 days.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 38864**] rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: colon mass, probable malignancy left foot chronic osteomyelitis s/p tibeocalcaneal fusion acute blood loss anemia port-a-cath failure history of type 2 diabetes history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation history of diastolic heart failure   Discharge Condition: good: pain controlled, afebrile, hematocrit stable   Discharge Instructions: Please monitor for temperature > 101, decreased mental status, bright red blood in the stool, diarrhea, or other concerning symptoms.
Phone: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4335**]  Please call to schedule follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] on the same day to discuss possible surgical options for your colon mass, which is likely cancer.
Phone: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 3378**]  Please follow-up with the surgeon that placed your port, to schedule a surgery to have that removed as it is not working and puts you at risk of developing a clot in your blood vessel.
