Assessment of alignment of the fragments is limited given only the AP projection.
Overall the appearance of the hardware in the proximal femurs is similar to scout image from CT [**2151-2-24**] and AP pelvis [**2146-9-16**].
[**8-23**] Femur AP and Lat (post-procedure): A series of 18 intraoperative radiographs of the left femur demonstrate ORIF in progress.
These findings are new as compared with tracing of [**2151-8-20**] .
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg.
Left  ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function  are normal (LVEF >55%) Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
[**8-25**]: L Femur X-ray: 1.
She has not had a stress test or prior work-up in the past.
This responded quickly to po metoprolol,she converted to normal sinus rhythm, and chest pain resolved, however she did experience a rise in cardiac enzymes so was started on IV heparin.
Her cardiac enzymes trended down and she subsequently remained chest pain free.
She underwent echocardiography subsequently, and had no wall motion abnormalities with a preserved ejection fraction.
BP on admission elevated to 200's which came down to 180's.
Did not receive further doses of nitroglycerin, and blood pressure was well-controlled with increased dose of beta-blocker.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed.
Left femur fracture 2.)
After the surgery you experience some chest pain and fast heart rate which may have represented a small heart attack.
An echocardiogram, or ultrasound of the heart after this event showed preserved contractile function.
