For HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS, PHYSICAL EXAMINATION on arrival to [**Hospital1 69**] and original laboratory evaluations, please refer to the note from Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from the [**2121-10-31**].
She had a clear mental status and her main complaints were abdominal pain status post exploratory laparotomy.
Her renal function was adequate with a creatinine of 0.9 and a uric acid of 5.7.
Kinetic studies performed on bone marrow aspiration material obtained at [**Hospital1 188**] showed an 8; 22 translocation involving the .....gene.
Laboratory results showed an elevated amylase and lipase level which continued to rise and was associated with increased abdominal pain.
By hospitalization day six, the blood amylase levels peaked at 486 and the blood lipid levels peaked at 558.
Gradually, the amylase and lipase blood levels dropped and the patient's abdominal pain subsided.
A repeat abdominal CT scan showed improvement in her status with a regulation of lymphoma and radiographic features of pancreatitis.
By that time, the pleural effusions that had accumulated in her chest cavity were quite sizable and on the right side calculated as greater than 2 liters.
A cytology revealed the presence of the lymphoma cells.
The patient tolerated the actual procedure well, however, shortly afterwards, she exhibited hypotension and had to be transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure support.
Her blood pressure normalized quickly, but unfortunately, at the same time, the pleural effusions reaccumulated within one day and had reached the original before thoracentesis size.
Original evaluation on the [**11-4**] revealed that the patient's left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%.
However, upon institution of chemotherapy her left ventricular ejection fraction dropped to less than 25% within five days.
The decline in her left ventricular function continued and on the [**2121-11-14**], her left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 20% with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis identified by echocardiogram.
Fortunately, her cardiovascular status improved during the next days with her left ventricular ejection fraction improving to approximately 30% on the [**2121-11-20**].
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] status post exploratory laparotomy, and at that time she was treated with Levofloxacin, Metronidazole and Cefepime because of her post surgical status and her high risk for bowel perforation because of her treatment for lymphoma that had infiltrated her colon.
However, blood cultures drawn on the [**2121-11-9**] revealed [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.
However, her fever persisted and growth of [**Female First Name (un) 564**] from serial blood cultures persisted as well.
That was done on the [**2121-11-14**], and the culture of the catheter tip grew [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans as well.
Subsequently, the patient exhibited fevers again, at which point the PICC line was removed and blood cultures that were drawn revealed again the presence of [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.
As of the time of this dictation, the patient's temperature has been within normal limits with the possible exception of a temperature of 100.1 F., on the morning of the [**2121-11-29**].
MENTAL STATUS:  The patient's mental status throughout her hospitalization fluctuated with altered mental status during the period when she was afebrile and she had positive blood cultures for [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
A radiographic imaging of her brain was negative for acute events.
Fortunately, her pain subsided with a very temporary support with morphine and her abdominal examination normalized.
Follow-up abdominal CT scan without intravenous contrast performed on the [**2121-11-14**], revealed no bowel dilatation and no bowel wall thickening which was interpreted as a favorable response of her lymphoma to chemotherapy.
A KUB performed at the bedside did not show evidence of obstruction.
The patient was suggested to have an abdominal CT scan which was not possible because the patient could not tolerate the p.o.
As of now, the patient has not had this CT scan of her abdomen and she has been managed supportively.
The patient has received an intrathecal administration of ARA-C.  CT scan of the abdomen following one cycle of her chemotherapy has demonstrated a favorable response to her chemotherapy; however, given the aggressive nature of her disease, it is expected that she is at a high risk of relapse unless she can continue further chemotherapy treatment, which at this point is not considered appropriate given her very poor performance status.
The patient has received so far several transfusions of packed red blood cells and platelets and has had bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as one intrathecal administration of ARA-C and a second lumbar puncture to evaluate her altered mental status which was negative for infection.
