In [**Name (NI) **], pt's SBP was initially stable in 128/52 but after a few hours, BP was noted to be 66/43 so pt started on dopa and L-subclav placed.
Pt's BP improved with 3L NS and dopa was weaned to lowest dose upon transfer to MICU.
Family History: non- contributory  Physical Exam: -VS: Temp 96.3, HR 80-100, SBP 120s->60s->110s on low-dose dopa, O2 Sat 95-98% on 2-3L NC.
CVP 11-12.

head CT: large sellar mass- no intercranial hemorrhage or infarct .
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed with marked hypokinesis of the RV apex.
Doubt that he had large AMI leading to cardiogenic shock given physical exam and flat CKs, although patient did have troponin elevation.
A head CT in the ED was negative for a bleed but notable for large sellar mass (which per daughter is known & old).
His temperature also decreased overnight on two occasions to 92-93 degrees.
He was weaned off oxygen and his blood pressured stabilized despite discontinuation of midodrine.
It was thought that given his cardiac function (an echo done on [**3-1**] showed depressed LV and RV function, hypokinesis) he could benefit from initiation of either a beta-blocker or ACE, however given his tenuous blood pressure, this was deferred for now.
His creatinine continued to improved to .8 from 1.6 at admission.
This was decreased to 5 units of Lantus as his blood sugars were much lower once the high dose steroids were stopped.
It is recommended that if his blood sugars increased, wait at least 48 hours before further increasing his Lantus dose to avoid precipitating hypoglycemia.
On the day prior to discharge, he became acutely hypoxic down to oxygen saturation of 88% on RA.
CXR and physical exam most suggestive of fluid overload and the patient had received IVF the day prior for lyte replacement and hypernatremia.
He responded well to IV lasix, with oxygen saturation improving to 96%.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
If your blood sugars are persistently high (i.e, >200) for over 48 hours, would recommend increasing your lantus dose.
