CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST ([**2195-1-24**]) 1.
CT abdomen showed that the left posterior drainage pigtail catheter was withdrawn such that the tip was in the posterior gluteus/subcutaneous tissues.
On reviewing his severe metabolic derangements, he was found to have severe hypomagnesemia (0.3) and hypocalcemia (4.8) which were the likely cause of confusion (metabolic encephalopathy), tremors and eye signs.
Given persistent tachycardia to 140s, his norepinephrine was changed to phenylephrine and was treated with IV diltiazem and latterly a diltiazem infusion.
Post-extubation on [**1-28**], his heart rate was still problem[**Name (NI) 115**] and he was converted from a diltiazem IV infusion to oral diltiazem and metoprolol.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline of chronic renal failure with a creatinine 1.4-1.6.
Creatinine improved and was 1.3 in discharge.
Left arm pain: Left upper extremity was negative for fracture, dislocation or osteolytic lesions on XR and UENI negative for DVT.
Per surgery, IR guided drainage of pelvic collection may provide a bridge to operative management and this occurred but when his drain fell out and was latterly removed, it was felt that no further intervention was needed at this time.
