Of note during the last admission, he was also found to have a large left pleural effusion on CT chest, but refused thoracentesis at that time.
An x-ray performed at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital showed a large plasmacytoma in the posterior chest wall.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation.
CT guided biopsy of the right posterior chest wall mass was consistent with a plasmacytoma.
Immunoperoxidase studies showed tumor CD-134 positive and containing monoclonal kappa and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin.
MIB staining showed a fraction of approximately 20%.
Bone marrow biopsy revealed 80% involvement with plasma cell myeloma.
Plasma cells represented 41% of the marrow cellularity.
Skeletal survey on [**2190-12-2**] showed no additional lytic lesions.
CT of the torso demonstrated a large mass in the right posterior mediastinum and hemithorax destroying the transverse process of the vertebral body of T3 and T4 and ribs at that level.
IgG at that time was 8703, an SPEP showed an abnormal band representing 58%, and beta 2 microglobulin was 3.4.
Mr. [**Known lastname 54249**] was initially treated with steroids and radiation therapy, which started on [**2190-12-3**].
He was admitted for further workup to rule out any neurologic developments.
Workup included an MRI, which showed only prominent ventricular sulci and an LP showing no changes consistent with infection.
Mr. [**Known lastname 54249**] had initial responses to the DVD chemotherapy, but then began showing a plateauing of his IgG level.
A CT scan obtained at that time showed that he had some enlargement of the neck mass.
As such, his regimen was then changed to pulse Cytoxan along with pulse Decadron therapy 40 mg times four days on and four days off.
He was then treated with radiation therapy to his neck following an MRI, which ruled him out for any spinal cord compression.
He showed a dramatic response to the [**Known lastname 4387**], most notably a drop in his IgG level to within normal range at 789 and his SPEP now representing 4% of the total protein.
His pericardial fluid was negative for malignantcells.
During this hospitalization, a CT scan on [**11-11**] revealed a a large prevertebral soft tissue mass with anterior displacement of the esophagus and trachea, 4 x 2.5 cm in greatest dimensions.
Images of the upper thorax demonstrated massive mediastinal adenopathy.
Although his presentation was certainly concerning for recurrent  MM, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 54250**] refused further evaluation including bronchoscopy and biospsy, but simply wanted to be treated with more [**Name13 (STitle) 4387**].

No change from the prior study of [**2191-2-9**].
This was concerning in the setting of his recent cardiac tamponade, a TTE was done which was notable for improvement in the recent pericardial effusion and no evidence of tamponade.
--On admission, a CT of the chest was done which was notable for a stable mediastinal mass, but an increasing left pleural effusion which was already cited as large on the last admission.
He was then able to maintain an oxygen saturation of 94-97% on 2 Liters (baseline on previous admission).
The preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] per pathology of the pleural fluid was positive for plasma cells.
An MRI was suggested, but the patient refused to have one done on the first hospital day.
TSH, B12 and LFTs were sent to evaluate for metabolic causes of asterixis, all of which were within normal limits.
The patient refused the MRI when he got there because of pain and anxiety despite the xanax.
During this time he was hemodynamically stable but exhibited no response to painful stimuli and no gag reflex.
A head CT was done which was negative for an acute bleed, mass or mass effect.
While the head MRI was negative for masses/lesions, the MRI of the spine was notable for diffuse bony and epidural tumor and cord compression, particularly at the C6 to T4 levels and from T6-7 to T9-10.
#Pain control - On the first few days of admission, the patient's pain was fairly well controlled with oxycontin 60 mg [**Hospital1 **], with occassional oxycodone for breakthrough.
Red urine was in the bag after irrigation so a sample was sent for cytology.
A follow up CT scan of his chest suggested an increase in the mediastianl mass despite the two doses of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the patient was maintained on best supportive measures.
