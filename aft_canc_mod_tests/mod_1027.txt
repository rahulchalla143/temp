On POD4 he was transfered out of the CSRU, was given one unit of packed red cells for a hematocrit that had drifted down to 20.
Post-transfusion hematocrit the next morning was 25, CXR after removal showed no pneumothorax on the L, and a stable pneumothorax on the R.  TF were advanced to goal.
A barium swallow study on POD4 demonstrated no leak of contrast into the mediastinum.
On POD5 his NGT was removed, he was started on sips, and his foley catheter was removed.
This was not changed because his TF were stopped the next day.
His R chest tube was removed since the output did not increase after starting clears and his JP drain was removed as well.
The post removal CXR showed a slightly larger pneumothorax on the R.  On POD7 he voided spontaneously, tolerated a regular diet, and the TF were stopped.
A repeat CXR showed that the R pneumothorax was stable.
