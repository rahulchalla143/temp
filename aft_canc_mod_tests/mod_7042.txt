The patient remained significantly acidemic with pH 7.1 and elevated CO2.
other potentials could be PE however seems early in course for this and has no hemodynamic or ECG evidence for PE.
- cycle cardiac enzymes: peaked at 0.04 - serial ABG: most recent 7.21/77/101 - Chest CT yesterday noted as above - NIPPV yesterday without signif improvement in PCo2.
- A-line for BP monitor and frequent ABG - CXR this am as above.
- serial ABG as above - CT head: negative - Mental status improved yesterday.
- UA, urine lytes showing likely pre-renal etiology with high osmol and low urine Na.
# CAD: no ischemic changes on EKG and negative enzymes x 2. however with new respiratory changes reasonable to re-cycle enzymes - cycle enzymes.
Peaked at 0.04 - repeat EKG - continue aspirin/plavix/statin .
- no further eval at this time.
