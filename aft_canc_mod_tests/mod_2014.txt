Colonoscopy was scheduled for [**7-30**] and patient prepped the night before.
The procedure was re-scheduled for [**10-8**] with plan for patient to be admitted the night before for bowel prep and ?2U blood transfusion.
Per report of the patient, he had a stool guaiac which was positive which prompted the colonoscopy.
12 lead EKG captured override pacing of monomorphic VT decompensating into ventricular fibrillation during the first episode.
During the second event, 12 lead EKG captured a PVC decompensating into VF.
His potassium and magnesium were low and were repleted.
Patient was seen by the EP team who increased his pacer settings to a rate of 80 and the patient was admitted to the CCU for further management.

NECK: Supple with JVP at clavicle sitting upright.
PULSES: Right: DP/PT dopplerable Left: DP/PT dopplerable  Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS: WBC 16.8  Hct 27.8  Hgb 9.3  Plts 269 PT 19.7  PTT 29.8  INR 1.8 Na 141  K 3.5  Cl 102  HCO3 26  BUN 37  Cr 1.5  Gluc 123 Trop-T 0.03 .

-Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2162-10-8**]):  The left atrium is moderately dilated.
LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to extensive apical akinesis, hypokinesis of the interventricular septum, and marked mechanical dyssynchrony (pacing vs left bundle branch block).
-Non-con Head CT ([**2162-10-15**]): No hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or evidence for acute vascular territorial infarction is present.
-CT ABD/PELVIS ([**2162-10-15**]): 1.
-CT CHEST ([**2162-10-15**]): 1.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy which may be reactive in this patient with chronic heart disease.
Followup examination is recommended in 12 months.
-ECHO TTE ([**2162-10-16**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-10-8**], left ventricular cavity size is smaller and and systolic function has improved of basal segments.
-TAGGED WBC SCAN [**2162-10-21**]: INTERPRETATION: Following the injection of autologous white blood cells labeled with In-111, images of the whole body were obtained at 24hours.
PROCEDURES: -COLONOSCOPY [**2162-10-26**]: Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.
Patient was seen by the EP team who increased his pacer settings to a rate of 80 and initially treated with iv lidocaine and transitioned to oral mexilitine.
Echocardiogram performed during this admission showed EF of 30% with regional wall motion abnormalities, right ventricular failure and LV hypertrophy.
Patient was unable to complete the study as he became acutely aggitated and the study canceled.
His hematocrit dropped during this admission to 26 from his baseline around 30.
He received 2 units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit bumped appropriately.
He received an EGD and colonoscopy while inpatient which showed gastritis and duodenitis as well as diverticulosis.
Iron studies were sent as well which showed him to be iron deficient with an iron level of 8.
H Pylori antibody and biopsy stain were pending at the the time of transfer.
# Leukocytosis- White count was elevated at the time of admission which was initially felt to reflect the ICD firing that precipitated admission.
A full infectious work up was conducted including negative head, chest, abdomen and pelvis cat scans, multiple negative blood and urine cultures, and a negative WBC scan.
C diff was negative on several occasions.
A blood smear, lead levels, SPEP/UPEP, and imaging were all normal, and no bone marrow biopsy was preformed.
A BCR-ABL gene mutation was pending at the time of transfer.
The patient's white cell count was elevated to 18K at the time of transfer.
The lisinopril and hydralazine can be restarted as tolerated by his blood pressure.
# Chronic kidney disease- Baseline creatinine appears to be ~1.4-1.5 and is 1.3 upon discharge.
# Transitional issues - pulm nodules 4mm on CT chest - needs f/u in 12 months - BCR-ABL test was pending at the time of transfer - H Pylori antibody and stain were pending at the time of transfer - patient will need lasix and lisinopril restarted as systolic pressures tolerate.
We did an EGD (camera down the throat) and colonoscopy (camera into the large bowel) which revealed an ulcer, some irritation in your stomach and small bowel, and diverticulosis.
You will need to have an echo done at your appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (cardiology) on [**2162-11-19**].
