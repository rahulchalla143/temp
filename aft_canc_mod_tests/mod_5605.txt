She then became hypotensive, bradycardic, and non-responsive with SBP 80's-90's, HR 35.
An MRI then demonstrated an irregular enhancing mass in the cerebellum, bifrontal lobes,left temporal lobe (largest region of abnormality) and right occipital lobe.
Pathology on biopsy was consistent with primary high grade B cell CNS lymphoma.

Her BP was stable around 90s-120s/50s-60s.
An EKG showed bradycardia w/o block.
Her morning Phenytoin level was 19.3 and Phenytoin was held since then.
Stat lytes, free Phenytoin, TFTs, LFTs and a head CT were ordered.
Head CT was without any catastrophic event.
However, imaging did not point towards this possibility either.
On [**9-26**], the patient was noted to have again a heart rate in the 30s.
Her BP was 143/59 and Temp of 97.
Dopamine drip was started on the onc floor and the pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring.
The patient did well, maintaining SBPs and UOP despite a HR in the 30s.
No further intervention was done and the patient remained asymptomatic despite bradycardia.
Her dilantin, BB and CCB were continued to be held.
CXR showed no signs of active pulmonary process.
Blood cx from [**9-16**] were negative.
Bcx from [**9-20**] and [**9-26**] were also negative as well as a Ucx from [**9-27**].
CNS lymphoma - Chemotherapy has been coordinated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**].
MRI of brain on [**9-11**] showed possible slight progression in left temporal lobe.
Rec was to pretreat with Diltiazem 60 mg [**Hospital1 **] to reduce effects of diastolic dysfxn, if pt is going to rechallenged with MTX again.
An ionized calcium was 1.47.
Vit D25OH was within the normal range.
It is suggested to get a sestamibi scan to evaluate for parathyroid adenoma/hyperplasia, as well as a DEXA scan since pt is on longstanding steroids.
Diastolic dysfunction - Pt is known to have diastolic dysfunction in the past.
B/o her bradycardic episode, BB and CCB were held since then.
It is recommended that her PCP is going to follow up and titrate up on the lisinopril dose if BP and renal functions allows.
