Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-11-20**] , the pericardial effusion appears similar.
TEE (Complete) Done [**2165-11-20**] at 2:45:56 The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
TTE (Complete) Done [**2165-11-13**] at 1:38:19 The left atrium is normal in size.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No echo evidence of tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-11-10**], the findings are similar.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2165-11-10**] at 5:55:22 PM The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
IMPRESSION: Small-moderate pericardial effusion as described above without 2D echo evidence of tamponade physiology.
Lung windows again reveal mild predominantly upper lobe centrilobular emphysema.
Although this examination is not tailored to evaluate abdominal organs, limited non-contrast evaluation of the upper abdomen is unremarkable.
Recommend continued attention to these findings on short term follow-up chest CT (ie 3- 4 months) to ensure no interval growth.
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2165-11-21**] 3:39 A small amount of layering fluid and mild mucosal thickening is noted in the right maxillary sinus with some mucosal thickening noted near the right ostiomeatal unit.
CT LOW EXT W/O C RIGHT	Study Date of [**2165-11-19**] 3:36 PM Moderate neuropathic changes involve the mid foot, with deformity and debris.
A metallic pin traverses the first interphalangeal joint, which is plantar flexed.
CT TORSO W/CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2165-11-19**] 3:36 PM  CHEST FINDINGS: Mild, bilateral centrilobular emphysema is unchanged.
There are scattered mediastinal lymph nodes, none of which meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Scattered inguinal lymph nodes are visualized, none of which meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There are no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions.IMPRESSION: 1.
CT LOW EXT W/O C RIGHT	Study Date of [**2165-11-11**] 11:38 AM LEFT FOOT: Patient has a long screw across the calcaneocuboid joint.
There is a very large ulcer within the inferior lateral aspect of the foot which measures 3.6 cm at its base and there is exposed bone involving the fifth proximal metatarsal and portion of the residual cuboid.
Although this exam was not optimized for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis, the imaged intra-abdominal organs are grossly unremarkable except to note a markedly distended stomach with fluid also noted within the distal esophagus.
CARDIAC PERFUSION PERSANTINE	Study Date of [**2165-11-18**] Left ventricular cavity size is normal.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 61%.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**] W & W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2165-11-13**] 7:35 PM FINDINGS: There is expansion of the thecal sac in the lumbosacral spine with posterior clumping of the cauda equina and nerve roots associated with a 5 mm T1 hyperintense lesion at the L5/S1 level, consistent with a lipoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 45 yo M, with h/o spina bifida and peripheral neuropathy with chronic R foot ulcer, recently diagnosed L-spine lipoma and immunosupressed on dexamethasone x 6 weeks transfered to the floor from the MICU with pericarditis, LLE cellulitis, RLE osteomyelitis and cellulitis, BCx growing group G Streptococcus and MSSA, HSV ulcers of the skin and OP, UTI with Klebsiella, paraspinal lipoma, on steroids to reduce spinal inflammation, and elevated LFTs.
# Sepsis/bacteremia (MSSA/GBS bacteremia, RLL osteomyelitis): Pt presented to ED with tachycardia, elevated bands, and GPC in initial blood culture in the setting of immunosuppression with steroids progressively worsening chronic R foot ulcer and bilateral leg cellulitis c/w sepsis.
Source confirmed as blood and wound cultures grew back group G Streptococcus and MSSA.
Urine was positive for Klebsiella which was treated with ceftriaxone.
Galactomannin, cryptococcal, and Legionella serologies were negative.
Multiple TTEs and a TEE showed no endocarditis but a pericardial effusion with no tamponade physiology.
Torso CT [**2165-11-19**] no occult abscesses or LAD with stable pericardial effusions.
Sinus CT showed ?mild sinusitis, but on effective ABx and asymptomatic.
Unclear if the ECG changes are [**2-23**] pericardial fibrosis as no recent baseline.
CEs were negative x 4 and ECG remained unchanged  .
Preliminary wound culture positive for group G Strep.
CT of foot with probable OM and gas in the soft tissue.
Wound cultures continued to grow group B Step and MSSA.
# L-spine Lipoma: MRI showed a lipoma with an element of inflammation with possible compression related to this lesion.
Pt has several small lung nodules which will need interval follow up in 3 to 6 months with a non-contrast chest CT.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Chest CT non-contrast Please obtain a non-contrast CT of your chest 3 months after discharge.
