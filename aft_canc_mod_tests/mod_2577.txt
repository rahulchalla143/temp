Blood cx were drawn and  CXR showed no infiltrate so he was sent home with the dx of a viral infection.

** Torso CT ** CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a 9 mm pretracheal lymph node and a 9 mm left axillary lymph node that are slightly increased in size compared to the prior study where they measured approximately 7 mm.
Lung windows demonstrate no areas of consolidation or pulmonary nodules.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is possible slight interval increase in size of the previously demonstrated mass at the mesenteric root measuring approximately 6.7 x 3.7 cm, previously 5.7 x 3.5 cm at this location on the prior scan of [**2157-1-24**].
The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, stomach, small bowel, and large bowel are unchanged.
There is a stable low attenuation focus in the interpolar region of the left kidney that is too small to characterize on CT scan.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The bladder, distal ureters, prostate gland, rectum, and sigmoid colon are unremarkable.
There are multiple small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes, the largest measuring 12 mm in the left groin, increased in size compared to the prior study where it measured approximately 7 cm in short axis diameter.
** liver, needle core biopsy ** -Mixed portal inflammation, including mononuclear cells, a small component of neutrophils and rare eosinophils with focal bile duct infiltration by lymphocytes and focal portal venulitis.
-Note: The biopsy shows features of graft vs. host disease, however, in the presence of neutrophilic infiltrate a concomitant infectious process cannot be excluded.
Transaminitis: Over hospital stay, pt's LFTs rose and peaked on HD #6 with an ALT of 820 and AST of 500.
Alk phos and bilirubin remained normal until HD #6 when they began to rise.
A u/s guided liver biopsy was done and was consistent with GVH but also showed neutrophilic infiltration concerning for infection.
Stains were negative for CMV and microorganisms.
Fever/malaise/cough: Before pt was started on steroids for presumed GVH, a torso CT was done to rule out infection.
Other than interval progression of disease, the CT was negative for infiltrates or source of infection.
Pt had fevers to 102 during the beginning of his hospital stay but all blood and urine cx were negative.
Dry Eyes: Pt was given artificial tears as well as sulfacetamide drops for relief.
