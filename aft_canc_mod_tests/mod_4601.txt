A CT scan of the spine was performed (since he has been historically unable to tolerate an MRI without sedation and intubation) which showed worsening of his T4/T5 compression fracture, expulsion of bony fragments into the spinal canal, and new compression of the cord at this level.
Upon arrival to the floor, there was concern that he had worsened hypoxia, and a CT angiogram was performed which showed no PE; it did however show bibasilar opacities consistent with aspiration (though he has never been febrile).
We started him on venlafaxine and dc'd his citalopram with hopes of addressing his baseline anxiety and he will be discharged with dose of 75mg with plans to increase to 150mg 2d after his discharge  A wound care consult was obtained for his prior neurosurgical wound and his decubitus ulcers.
Inspiration/expiration CXRs were obtained which showed good movement of his diaphragm.

# Cord compression- Neurosurg eval appreciated, unlikely to be a surgical candidate given low likely of regaining function.
- TLSO brace when OOB - Rad/Onc following; continue XRT, dexamethasone 4q6h - pain service following.
until XRT finished - 4mg dexamethasone q6h - fotmonthly pamidronate (history of hypercalcemia) yesterday - renal function has been good - plan to start prednisone/melphalan vs. IV cyclophosphamide on monday s/p last XRT treatment .
# COPD: CT angio neg for PE and ?basilar consolidation.
Per reports has emphysema and 2L O2 baseline requirement - Cont supplemental O2 at his baseline 2L - aspiration precautions - albuterol/ipratropium per outpatient regimen .
- started clonazepam as longer acting [**Doctor Last Name 360**] with ativan PRN.
- started effexor 37.5 for GAD/Dx.
