EEG [**2176-7-27**]: This is an abnormal continuous video EEG given the presence of brief subclinical electrographic seizures over the right greater than left frontal leads.
EEG [**2176-7-29**]: This is an abnormal continuous video EEG given the presence of burst of bilateral frontal and temporal generalized slowing.
MRI BRAIN [**2176-7-26**]: 1.
Further evaluation via consultation with Interventional Neuroradiology service has been recommended.
Expanded sella turcica, with an appearance suggestive of an "empty sella," a common variant, or possibly, arachnoid cyst of the suprasellar cistern.
CXR [**2176-7-26**]: Normal radiographic study of the chest.
CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM [**2176-7-29**]: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 13712**] underwent a diagnostic cerebral angiogram which was grossly normal, specifically with no evidence of a dural arteriovenous fistula.
MRI [**2176-7-31**]: 1.
Limited pre-operative study redemonstrating the 7 x 7 mm enhancing lesion in the right frontal region consistent with the previously-characterized cavernous angioma, unchanged in appearance since [**2176-7-26**].
HEAD CT [**2176-7-31**]: No evidence of postoperative hemorrhage.
HEAD CT [**2176-8-4**]: No evidence of interval hemorrhage from [**2176-7-31**].
HEAD CT [**2176-8-8**]: Expected evolution of postoperative bed in the right frontal lobe.
Post op course was complicated by continued headache, but repeat head CTs only showed expected post op changes and no hemorrhages.
# CV: She was continued on telemetry without events, and her lipid panel showed slightly elevated LDL, but given no other risk, she was recommended lifestyle changes for now.
# ID: Patient developed fevers during her post op period, and was started on IV vancomycin for a few days.
However, her blood cultures were negative and her fevers resolved, so vancomycin was stopped without further issues.
Hemolysis labs were checked and were negative, and her guaiac was also negative.
She was not transfused RBCs as her HCT remained in high 20s.
Her HCT improved to low 30s without any intervention.
Iron studies were done and did not show iron deficiency.
Information was obtained from Patient.
You will need a repeat CT of your head prior to your appointment.
