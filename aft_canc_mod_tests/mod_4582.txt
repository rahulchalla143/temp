She had CT scans of her head and torso, and she was found to have a 2.5 by 2.9  parietal/occiptial mass with vasogenic edema.
Bx at [**Hospital1 34**] [**6-/2176**] +NSCLC.
The lesion 7+cm, attached to post peripheral chest wall, and moved <6mm on 4D scan, volume was felt too large to treat quickly.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: # CHF (ef 40% on TTE [**8-26**], class III) # [**Month/Year (2) 2091**] - on dialysis # CAD s/p CABG [**75**] years ago c/b sternal wound infection # Extensive PVD # DVT - now on Coumadin indefinitely # Obesity # Hyperparathyroidism # Hypothyroidism # Anxiety # Type 2 DM # COPD # Benign Hypertension # Anemia (Hct baseline high 20s), also had a GI bleed back in [**2177**] requiring 12 units.

no fx - CT abd w/ contrast: no acute abdominal process.
- CT chest w/ contrast: 3.1 cm diameter partially calcified pleural based mass at the low posterior left lower lobe, at the site of previously dx lung cancer.
[**Hospital1 18**] IMAGING:  [**2177-7-12**] CT C-spine without contrast 1.
CXR PA and Lateral [**2177-7-12**]  1.
CT Head w/o contrast [**2177-7-12**] 3.1 x 2.7 cm right parieto-occipital mass with extensive neighboring edema and moderate neighboring mass effect but no evidence for herniation.
CT Head with contrast [**2177-7-13**] A 3.1 x 2.8 cm mass centered in the right parieto-occipital region with avid peripheral enhancement and extensive surrounding vasogenic edema compatible with metastatic disease given the history.
The left chest AICD is in place.
Overall, the appearance is similar compared to the study from five days ago.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  60 yo woman with PMHx of [**Month/Day (2) 2091**] (on HD), CABG, HTN, HL, DM2 and NSCLC who presented from an OSH after a CT head showed a new 2.5x2.9cm mass at the parietal-occipital lobe junction.
She had an ECHO done which showed focal wall motion abnormalities c/w prior cardiac event.
A corrected serum dilantin level was 4.8 on [**7-21**].
She remained neurologically stable post op and head CT revealed expected post op changes.
Her Foley was d/c'd and a CT with contrast was ordered to evaluate for residual tumor.
The patient was placed back in bed and the blood pressure resolved a systolic of 100.
#  Lung CA:  The patient had a CT torso obtained at OSH that showed stable disease in chest, with no disease in the abdomen.
As above, head CT showed new solitary brain lesion, likely metastatic.
We obtained a pre-operative Echo which showed focal wall motion abnormalities c/w prior cardiac event.
