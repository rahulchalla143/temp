She thinks patient has had recent weight loss Vitals in the ER: 97.2 76 128/60 16 99% RA.
He had CT head and C-spine showing no acute fracture.
He had a CXR showing known cavitary lung lesion.
Patient was originally admitted to OMED service, but while in the ED he converted from sinus rhythm to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Patient initially had HR in 160s.
He received 15 mg IV diltiazem and his blood pressure dropped to systolic BP of 80.
He reecived an additional 1L NS and his SBP improved to 110s.
Mr. [**Known lastname 14535**] has had multiple conversations with several pulmonary and oncology providers in the last several years recommending tissue biopsy and bone marrow biopsy; but he refused on multiple occasions.
Noted to have LAD in [**2172**]; at that time Heme-Onc was concerned for primary lung cancer versus a potential lymphoma, less likely melanoma, and recommended a bone marrow biopsy and a surgical biopsy, both of which Mr. [**Known lastname 14535**] declined.
On [**2176-8-14**] CXR left upper lobe lung nodule has grown to nearly 7 cm, abuts the anterior surface of the left hilus; he refused biopsy again so his pulmonologist obtained sputum sample.On [**2176-8-28**] sputum cytology revealed highly atypical squamous cells suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma.

Spine CT w/o Contrast ([**6-5**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR ([**6-5**]): FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate a previously 5.8 x 3.6 cm left upper lobe lung mass, now measuring 8.7 x 6.5 cm with interval cavitation and a new air-fluid level, which presumably represents a cavitated bronchogenic carcinoma with necrotic contents.
CXR ([**6-7**]): IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**6-5**]:  Slight increase in the heart size and heterogeneous opacification at the lung bases could be due to dependent edema, but raises more concern for pneumonia.
ECHO ([**6-6**]): There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Infectious work-up was negative.
Precipitant unclear, but possibly etiology includes chronic disease (pt with h/o HTN), pulmonary disease (patient with known COPD), irritation of left atria from left lung mass, and echo revealing mild LVH, mild MR and AS, so patient is good substrate.
ECHO with mild AS and small pericardial effusion without tamponade (likely malignancy related).
Given more fluids and BP fine although low once amio/dilt were stopped.
His blood pressures were within normal limits throughout his stay off the multi-drug hypertension regimen he was on at home.
The patient states he takes too many medications, does not want to take HTN medications, and his blood pressures were persistently in the 100s-140 range.
No evidence of fracture on CT c-spine.
#Cavitary Lung Mass most likely from squamous cell carcinoma - Pt with history of melanoma but the lung mass appears to be primary squamous cell lung carcinoma.
# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine increased to 1.9, up from most recent baseline of 1.2.
Creatinine improved with fluids.
The patient was briefly diuresed for his lower extremity edema which resulted in a rise in his creatinine from 1.4 to 1.6.
Subsequent diuresis was held with improvement of his creatinine to 1.3 at discharge.
Patient's BNP was 6600 and echo revealed mild LVH, MR, and AS, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Pt with excellent blood pressure control despite all medications being discontinued.
6) Notable labs on last check: Hct 30.1, BUN 29, Cr 1.3.
Your kidney function and blood pressures were initially low, but this improved with hydration.
The following changes were made to your medications: STOP Doxazosin STOP Clonidine STOP Nifedipine STOP Labetalol STOP Hydrochlorothiazide STOP Enalapril Decrease fentanyl to 25 mcg patch/hr Q 72 hours START Lidocaine patch for shoulder and hip pain START Ibuprofen 200-400 mg Q4-6h prn for pain START Oxycodone for pain START Bowel regimen with senna, colace, bisacodyl  Followup Instructions: Please have your rehab facility schedule an outpatient follow up appt with: Name: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] L.
