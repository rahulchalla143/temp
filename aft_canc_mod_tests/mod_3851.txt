There, a head computed tomography was performed which was reportedly normal.
A chest x-ray was done which was thought to be consistent with a pneumonia.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further workup of an acute stroke.
In the Emergency Department, the patient had a computed tomography angiogram positive for a pulmonary embolus.
Head computed tomography was repeated which showed a large apical mass.
According to the patient and his family, he had been feeling generally ill since [**Month (only) 956**] with cough, hemoptysis, congestion, nausea, and vomiting.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his girlfriend since [**2145**] ([**Name2 (NI) **]) who is also his health care proxy (telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 54972**]).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature of 100.5, his heart rate was 92, his blood pressure was 122/81, his respiratory rate was 30 to 40, and he was saturating 100% on 3 liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the extraocular movements were intact.
Jugular venous pressure could not be assessed.
Neurologic examination revealed 0/5 strength in the right upper extremity and right lower extremity.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had a white blood cell count of 14.7 (with 83% neutrophils and 12% lymphocytes), his hematocrit was 39, and his platelets were 133.
Chemistries were within normal limits with normal renal function.
His INR was 1.4.
Initial set of troponins with a creatine kinase of 184, troponin T of 1.05.
Liver function tests were within normal limits.
Arterial blood gas on mask ventilation showed 7.36/43/133.
Repeat arterial blood gas on 4 liters nasal cannula showed 7.35/42/73.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Lower extremity Doppler studies showed a deep venous thrombosis in the left popliteal vein.
A chest x-ray showed a right apical lung mass with extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with patchy left lower lobe atelectasis and increased interstitial markings diffusely, suggestive of lymphangitic spread.
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no atrial septal defect or patent foramen [**Last Name (LF) 43369**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, anterior space fat pad, no wall motion abnormalities.
A computed tomography of the head with contrast showed a subacute left frontal lobe infarction.
A computed tomography angiogram of the chest showed right lower lobe thrombus in the segmental branch and a 4.4-cm X 4.9-cm mass in the right apex of the lung, positive lymphadenopathy, and patchy opacification in the right upper lobe, with atelectasis in the left lower base, and a fatty liver.
A carotid ultrasound showed no stenosis of the bilateral carotids.
An x-ray of the orbit showed no metallic foreign bodies.
An electrocardiogram with sinus tachycardia at 120, with Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF.
A computerized axial tomography was also positive for a right upper lobe apical mass which was nonobstructive.
The patient will be taken for a bronchoscopy on [**2169-5-12**] for a biopsy of his right upper lobe apical mass.
He will be started on Coumadin and continued on heparin drip status post bronchoscopy until his INR is above 2 for greater than 48 hours, overlapping with heparin.
All sputum cultures grew moderate oropharyngeal flora.
A repeat head computed tomography showed normal evolution of his two ischemic strokes in the left frontal parasagittal area as well as the left occipital temporal area.
A transthoracic echocardiogram with bubble study was performed to assess for intracardiac shunt, and was negative for atrial septal defect or patent foramen [**Year (4 digits) 43369**].
Carotid ultrasounds were also performed to look for an embolic source of his strokes and were negative for stenoses.
A magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography could not be performed during this hospital stay secondary to the patient's agitation and inability to lay still for a long period of time.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient had evidence of demand ischemia with a peak creatine kinase of 184, MB of 20, and troponin T of 1.04.
Electrocardiogram showed old evidence of ischemia in the inferior leads.
His enzymes continued to trend down.
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of greater than 25% with no wall motion abnormalities.
His systolic blood pressure was kept between 140 to 160 while in house to maintain perfusion to the brain, and this should be continued for two weeks after his event.
The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37053**] where his beta blocker should be titrated up and an outpatient stress test will be considered.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable while in house.
His fingerstick blood glucoses were measured four times per day, and he was placed on an insulin sliding-scale.
His blood sugars remained in the middle 100 range.
His liver function tests were within normal limits as well as his amylase and lipase.
A computed tomography of the chest showed that there was a fatty liver, and this should be followed up as an outpatient.
Heparin drip per nomogram (with a goal partial thromboplastin time of 60 to 80).
