CXR [**2110-11-14**] IMPRESSION: Bilateral multiple nodular opacities, left side more than right, may reflect pre-existing nodular metastatic disease, better assessed on the CT torso study dated [**2110-10-24**] and if any of the opacities represent lung infection, is very difficult to determine based on the chest x-ray alone.
[**2110-11-6**] biopsy of pancreatic mass: POSIIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CT abd/pelvis/chest [**2110-10-24**] CHEST: The thyroid is unremarkable.
Occlusion of the splenic vein and the right anterior hepatic vein and left hepatic vein, likely secondary to tumor invasion or encasement.

[**11-14**] CHEST CT  Bilateral multiple nodular opacities, left side more than right, may reflect pre-existing nodular metastatic disease, better assessed on the CT torso study dated [**2110-10-24**] and if any of the opacities represent lung infection, is very difficult to determine based on the chest x-ray alone.
As the obstruction appeared to be lower down - two small lesions suspicious for metastasis had been seen in the lower pelvis on CT - flex sig was considered but pt was neutropenic and thrombocytopenic (see below) so no rectal manipulation was possible including enemas.
It was decided to order an MRI which was about to be performed when she became hypotensive, see below.
CT A/P  revealed diffuse colitis and enteritis on [**11-14**] with no signs of mesenteric ischemia.
Colonoscopy was contra-indicated in setting of neutropenia.
Stool cultures were sent which were negative.
Blood pressure found to be 70/30.
Despite these interventions her blood pressure crept down to mid - high 60s systolic even with aggressive fluid resuscitation and she developed tachycardia with HR up to 120s.
The patient's blood pressures improved modestly in the ICU to 80s-90s systolic.
Blood cultures from [**11-14**] were negative and [**11-19**] BC were pending at discharge.
Given treatment with neupogen and no fevers or new localizing source of infection, limited infectious work-up was undertaken, including blood and urine cultures, which were pending at discharge.
# Acute kidney injury: [**11-15**] urine lytes showed FENa 0.31%, consistent with prerenal etiology from patient's clinical picture of negligible PO intake and ongoing diarrheal losses.
