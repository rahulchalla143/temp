No significant change compared to the previous tracing except that the current ventricular response is more variable suggesting the combination of atrial fibrillation and flutter.
EKG [**2175-9-11**]: The rate is much slower with persistent flutter/fibrillation waves with a regular ventricular response suggesting conducted atrial fibrillation.
CXR [**2175-9-11**]: IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
CTA Chest [**2175-9-11**]: IMPRESSION: Pulmonary emboli involving the right middle and lower lobar as well as left lower lobar pulmonary arteries without evidence of right heart strain.
Atrial Flutter: Patient presented with palpitations and HR >150 prior to placement of adbominal catheterization.
PE: Bilateral PE was visualized on CTA, likely precipitated in setting of end-stage malignancy.
