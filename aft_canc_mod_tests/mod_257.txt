In the Emergency Room, hematocrit was found to be 17, blood pressure 74/30.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction [**11-7**] with catheterization showing 80% left anterior descending artery stenosis, stented.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, his physical examination was temperature 95.3, blood pressure 120/47, pulse 76, respiratory rate of 22, and sating 100% on room air.
Cardiovascular: regular, rate, and rhythm, 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at left lower sternal border.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 19.3, hematocrit 17, platelets 988.
His baseline hematocrit is between 33-37.
Differential was 92% neutrophils, 1 band, 1 lymphocyte, 5% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils.
His coags were PT 21.4, INR of 3.0, PTT 31.8.
Sodium 140, potassium 4.7, chloride 105, bicarb 22, BUN 69, creatinine 1.5, glucose 255.
Creatinine at baseline is 1.1-1.3.
Urinalysis showed trace blood, negative nitrate, trace protein, small bilirubin, [**3-10**] white blood cells, moderate bacteria, [**3-10**] squamous epithelial cells.
ALT was 22, AST 17, alkaline phosphatase 54, total bilirubin 0.4, amylase 37, lipase 35.
Chest x-ray showed left basilar PNA versus atelectasis.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute, left axis deviation, normal intervals, no ST changes.
A colonoscopy was performed the next day and it was negative.
EGD upper endoscopy revealed a nonbleeding 10 cm ulcer in the duodenum.
The patient had a Swallow evaluation which was negative.
Hematology/Oncology was consulted, who felt that his Hydroxyurea could be withheld until his hematocrit returned to 35.
Patient's white blood cell count was noted to trend up.
Gastrointestinal bleed status post endoscopy which revealed nonbleeding duodenal ulcer.
It was discussed with the primary care physician and Hematology/Oncology, who feels that the patient has been on Coumadin for six months for his deep venous thrombosis/PE, and there is no reason to continue the anticoagulation therapy further at this time.
The patient is to followup with his primary care physician in the next week at which time his BUN, creatinine can be rechecked along with his complete blood count to ensure that his hematocrit and white blood cell count remains stable.
