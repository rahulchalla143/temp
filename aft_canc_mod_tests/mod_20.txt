Cards was consulted and an echocardiogram revealed a pericardial fluid collection with tamponade.
Patient did have a rhythm on monitor so patient was diagnosed with PEA arrest.
A stat repeat ECHO was performed at that time and patient was found to have [**Male First Name (un) **] (systolic anterior motion), severe MR, and new wall motion abnormalities but no re-accumulation of pericardial effusion.
She is now being transferred to the MICU for further work-up and management.

Patient remained unresponsive after the PEA arrest and EEG was negative for seizure.
