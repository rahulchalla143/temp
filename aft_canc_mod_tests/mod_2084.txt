He underwent fine needle aspiration revealing melanoma versus carcinoma.
He began interferon in [**2175-2-4**], discontinued [**2175-11-6**] when biopsy of a sacral lesion noted on CT revealed melanoma.
He was followed with serial CTs with progressive L2 bony metastases noted on [**2176-11-6**].
Follow-up CTs revealed questionable right inguinal mass, questionable splenic lesion and an enlarging bony metastasis and L2 coupled with worsening back pain.
Follow-up CTs after cycle #2 revealed stable disease.
Follow-up CTs after cycle #4 revealed stable disease and 5 x 4-mm right lower lobe nodule of unclear significance.
Head CT in [**5-11**] with no evidence of metastatic disease.
Pertinent Results: wbc 11.0/hct 30.3/plt 197 Na 138/K 4.0/CL 102/Bicarb 26/BUN 24/Cr 1.1/Gluc 97 Ca 9.4/Mg 1.9/P 3.6 PT 13.1/PTT 24.9/INR 1.1  CT BRAIN AT ADMISSION: 1.
Initial CT of the head revealed a large left frontal hemorrhage and multiple foci of metastatic disease.
He was admitted to the neuro ICU with q1hr neuro checks, systolic blood pressure goal under 140, and started on IV Decadron 10mg q6hrs, with sliding scale insulin and proton pump inhibitor for prophylaxis.
An MRI was performed, and was read as follows: "FINDINGS: Multiple enhancing lesions are identified in the brain with an area of hemorrhage and enhancement in the left frontal lobe.
IMPRESSION: Left frontal lobe hemorrhage as seen on the CT of [**2177-9-18**] with an area of increased signal which could be secondary to enhancement.
For further workup, a chest xray was performed which showed: "Post-radiation fibrosis in right upper lobe with otherwise grossly clear lungs."
An EEG was abnormal as follows: "This is an abnormal portable study obtained in wakefulness progressing to drowsiness due to the presence of frequent slowing over the left anterior quadrant broadly, suggesting subcortical dysfunction in this region.
His clinical exam was monitored and showed improvment of word-finding and of his facial droop.
A repeat CT of the brain, performed on [**2177-9-21**] was stable.
His exam at discharge showed improvement of naming of both low and high frequency objects, and an improved but not resolved right hemiparesis of the face, as well as some very mild pronator drift.
Interleukin maintenance regimen; was to be admitted next week for cycle #2 2.
