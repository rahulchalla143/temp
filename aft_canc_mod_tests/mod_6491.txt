IMAGING: MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2154-9-12**] 5:23 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
CT TORSO W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2154-9-12**] 9:09 AM IMPRESSION: Massive mediastinal, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and intrapelvic lymphadenopathy, resulting in moderate obstruction of the left collecting system and likely compression of the left sciatic nerve.
Dampening of the Doppler waveforms of the left common femoral vein and augmentation indicative of more central occlusion/stenosis, in the setting of known massive retroperitoneal adenopathy as demonstrated on CT. 3.
Left groin lymphadenopathy as better characterized on concurrent CT from [**2154-9-12**].
[**9-14**] CT HEAD: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or major vascular territorial infarct.
MRI would be more sensitive for detecting intracranial malignancy, if clinically warranted.
[**9-19**] CT CHEST: 1.
Overall decrease in mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy compared to the CT torso performed one week prior.
PATHOLOGY: FISH evaluation for a BCL6 rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the LSI BCL6 Dual Color, Break Apart Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 3q27 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
FISH evaluation for a MYC rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the LSI MYC Dual Color Break Apart Rearrangement Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 8q24 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
FISH evaluation for an IGH-BCL2 rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the Vysis LSI IGH/BCL2 Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for IGH at 14q32 and BCL2 at 18q21 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
She also had a bone marrow biopsy which showed she did not have involvement of the bone marrow by lymphoma.
CT scans of the torso showed "massive" lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum and abdomen.
Her extremity dopplers were all negative for DVT and a CTA did not have evidence of a pulmonary embolus.
Her echocardiogram showed a normal ejection fraction.
After three days of aggressive diuresis (net negative 6-7L) she was able to maintain her saturations at >95% on room air.
However, a repeat CT at that time showed that her bilateral effusions were larger.
The pleural fluid showed ********** .
They did not feel further imaging would be helpful and recommended that we reinforce training for valsalva maneuvers to break the rhythm.
Calcium improved with IVF, intermittent IV lasix, and calcitonin.
She was treated with 7 days of ceftriaxone and 5 days of azithromycin, although her CT chest showed clear lung parenchyma with large bilateral effusions.
This resolved without treatment and blood cultures were negative.
She was fluid resusitated and her creatinine improved to 0.6 upon discharge.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please make sure that she stays on schedule for her chemotherapy cycles in the future.
