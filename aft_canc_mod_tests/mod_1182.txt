Past Medical History: - NSCLC IIIB (T2N2M0): Initially noted to have a right middle lobe lung nodule on chest x ray done for pneumonia in [**2173-4-19**] with subsequent chest CT on [**2173-5-8**] showing a 2.4 x 1.6 cm right middle lobe nodule as well as bibasilar infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (1.9 x 1.3 cm left paratracheal and 1.8 x 0.8 cm subcarinal).
Repeat chest CT on [**2173-7-28**] was interpreted as persistent right middle lobe nodule grossly unchanged to slightly larger in size with the mediastinum commented as stable.
On [**2174-5-2**] a repeat chest CT showed an increase in size to 4 x 2.3 cm of the spiculated nodule abutting the hemidiaphragm without mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Subsequent PET/CT on [**2174-5-5**] showed FDG-avid uptake in the nodule with peak SUV 7.3 as well as in a small right hilar lymph node with peak SUV 4.8 without other areas of abnormal uptake identified.
Underwent cervical mediastinoscopy and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage on [**2174-5-16**] with pathology positive for adenocarcinoma in level 7 lymph nodes (CK7 positive, CK20 and TTF negative).
Lymph nodes from levels 2R, 4L, and 4L were negative for malignancy.
