Pt EKG in EW showed STE in leads I, AVL, V2-V5.
Pt sent to cath which revealed right dominant, LMCA-mild distal taper; LAD - previous stent widely patent; Mid LAD 90% lesion involving proximal portion of the bifuracation with the D2, distal LAD diffusely diseased.
Pt hemodynamics revealed RA=8, RV=42/10, PAP=42/20(27), PCPW=21, LV=123/23, Ao=123/68(87) PAsat 55%, CI=3.

A 8 French XB 3.5 guide provided good support.
A PT [**Name (NI) 9165**] wire was  advanced to the the Diagonal and a Forte wire in the distal LAD without difficulty.
Final angiography revealed 10% residual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI III flow.
Final angiography revealed no resdiual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI III flow.
The patient left the lab chest pain free and in stable condition.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling pressures, pulmonaryy hypertension and a preserved cardiac output.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
Pt [**Name (NI) 30474**] and ACEI were held after her blood pressure became low.
2) Poor EF - Pt had echo after cath which revealed ejection fraction of 25-30%.
Pt was given fluids and Cre and urine output monitored.
