Admission Date:  [**2115-9-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2115-9-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2037-10-7**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICINE [**Company 191**]  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 96864**] is a 77-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and peripheral neuropathy recently admitted to the [**Hospital3 4527**] and found to have massive ascites and abdominal carcinomatosis on abdominal [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for gynecologic/oncology evaluation and possible surgical staging and debulking who was then subsequently transferred to the Medicine Service for a right deep venous thrombosis and management of this due to her allergy to heparin.
History of anemia with Guaiac positive stools at [**Hospital3 4527**] with an EGD and colonoscopy which were negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.6, blood pressure 142-176/60s-80s, pulse 80, respirations 20, oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.
HEENT:  The pupils were equally round and reactive to light and her extraocular muscles were intact.
She had 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally, and there was no erythema or evidence of venostasis changes.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, the CBC revealed a white count of 11.7 with a differential showing 76.4% neutrophils, 11% lymphocytes, and 8.8 monocytes.
Her hematocrit was 32.7 with an MCV of 89, platelets 366,000.
Coagulations revealed a PT of 13.8, PTT 22.9, and INR of 1.3.
She had an ALT of 13, AST of 16, LD 306, alkaline phosphatase 57, amylase 80, T bilirubin 0.3, lipase 36, albumin 3.4.
She had an EKG as well which showed sinus tachycardia with a right bundle branch block, and Q waves in the lateral limb leads.
All of this was unchanged from previous EKG compared to [**Hospital3 4527**].
Once she was medically managed and further discussions were begun, her family was very inconsistent and indecisive for plans and wishes for their mother.
Therefore, she was started on lepirudin and maintained on a lepirudin drip for a goal PTT of 60-80.
HIT antibody was not checked at this time.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 96864**] also has a history of anemia with iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Her hematocrit was monitored very closely.
She received 1 unit of packed red blood cells on [**2115-9-18**] for a hematocrit of 25.
Her hematocrit was stable after that point.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 96864**] has a history of hypertension and had good blood pressure control while admitted on her Captopril 50 mg t.i.d., and she was originally kept on her Atenolol 12.5 mg b.i.d., which was subsequently increased to 25 mg b.i.d.
with better control of her blood pressure.
She underwent cardiac preoperative evaluation while admission in case of possible surgical debulking and also to better convey risks and benefits to her family.
She underwent an echocardiogram which showed a mildly dilated left atrium, a normal left ventricular cavity, a normal ejection fraction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and mild aortic stenosis.
She also had a Persantine MIBI stress test which revealed no EKG changes, normal ejection fraction, and no reversible defect.
Her creatinine subsequently fell to 1.0.
She had urine cultures, blood cultures, and an attempt at sputum culture which was never obtained.
A U/A revealed signs of a urinary tract infection; however, urine culture times two came back as fecal contamination.
Initial blood cultures grew one out of four bottles positive for gram-positive cocci in chains from her PICC line site.
This was followed the second day with surveillance cultures which at the time of discharge had never grown anything and it was felt that this was probably secondary to contamination.
It was felt that she was very worried, anxious, and fearful of her diagnosis, as to be expected.
