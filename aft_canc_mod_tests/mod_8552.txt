FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):   Brief Hospital Course: 64 y/o F with h/o ESRD on HD, malignant hypertension, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter presenting with MSSA bacteremia c/b endocarditis and septic emboli to the brain and lung with incidental finding on CT scan of lumbar lytic lesion concerning for malignancy.
She was complaining of headaches with a nonfocal neuro exam and pain of her neck.
On MRI of her brain she was shown to have scattered embolic infarcts that were consistent with septic emboli.
She had a TEE which showed the same lesion of her valve and no abscess and no thrombus in her left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Laboratory [**Month/Day/Year 7941**] required frequency: [**Month/Day/Year 20515**] - CBC with diff - BMP - LFTs .
# Lytic lumbar lesion: On CT chest, a lytic lumbar lesion was noted.
Labs were significant for a normal IgG, IgM and elevated IgA (known IgA nephropathy).
On HD 12 patient had an ultrasound guided biopsy of a right enlarged supraclavicular lymph node.
Her INR levels were rising and this was felt to be due to interaction with her antibiotic regimen as she had no other signs of liver failure, or DIC.
She had an episode of asymptomatic bradycardia down into the 30s with a junctional rhythm which was nonresponsive to atropine.
After her TEE (which was negative for perivalvular abscess and other complications) and her rhythm, which converted back to afib in the low 100s, she was transferred back to the medical floor.
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from oncology will be following up on these labs and will inform PCP if further testing is necessary.
Contact #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 9714**] - Carvedilol and amiodarone were discontinued as patient had two episodes of bradycardia.
Patient should discuss restarting these medications with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] needs age appropriate cancer screening including mammogram and colonoscopy - continued treatment of MSSA bacteremia/endocarditis with cefazolin at HD.

Lytic lumbar lesion noted on CT scan .
You were found to have bacteria in the blood (bacteremia) and were placed on intravenous antibiotics.
You did not have any findings on exam of a stroke.
You had one other episode of this abnormal rhythm while inpatient and so the decision was made to discontinue the medications that can slow your heart rate (carvedilol and amiodarone).
Lastly, you had some findings on a CT scan of your chest which were concerning for cancer.
You were evaluated by the oncologists who sent several tests to evaluate for cancer which did not give a definitive diagnosis.
You had a biopsy of one of the enlarged lymph nodes.
The oncologist who saw you in the hospital, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], will be in touch with you and your primary care doctor regarding the results of these tests and further work-up that is necessary.
