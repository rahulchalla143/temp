LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).
CXR [**2169-11-21**]: UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Study is slightly limited due to patient motion.
IMPRESSION: Study is slightly limited due to patient motion.
RUQ Ultrasound [**2169-11-22**]: Dilatation of bile ducts, similar to that seen on recent MRI study performed 2 weeks ago.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification.
Partial pancreatogram was normal.
EKG [**11-21**]: Sinus rhythm.
EKG [**11-21**]: Sinus rhythm.
EKG [**11-22**]: Baseline artifact.
EKG [**11-23**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2169-7-27**] atrial fibrillation is new.
CXR [**11-28**]: Left PICC ends in the upper superior vena cava.
[**2169-11-21**] Blood Culture x 2.
Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2169-12-1**]):       ANAEROBIC GRAM POSITIVE ROD(S).
Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2169-11-23**]):       REPORTED BY PHONE TO DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] ON [**2169-11-23**] AT 0705.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory failure and septic shock.
Repeat CXR showed increased bilateral opacities suggesting pulmonary edema.
Heart failure was considered her BNP elevation and history of orthopnea, although she has no known heart failure and ECHO was not particularly concerning for CHF ([**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated, LVEF > 55%).
Viral DFA was negative, pneumonia was less likely in the absence of sputum and change in CXR.
Ischemia was considered given report of chest pain, although EKG negative and cardiac markers negative.
ABG showed good oxygenation and patient was switched to PSV 10/5 with FiO2 40%.
RSBI was 156 on [**11-29**], but given that she is an elderly female with baseline tachypnea and small TVs, extubation was attempted on [**11-29**] and was successful.
She was quickly weaned down to 2L NC with O2 sats 95-100%.
Of note, RSBI is not likely a good indication of this patients suitability for extubation given her baseline tachypnea and small TV and as she did very well s/p extubation with a pre-extubation RSBI of 156. .
Blood cultures showed G positive rods and Clostridium species (not perfringens) in anaerobic culture bottles, but have not yet been speciated.
Her rate remained in 100-120's, and rate control was initiated with metoprolol and diltiazem on [**11-29**].
Baseline creatinine 1.2-1.4. urine lytes: Fena: 0.2, FeUrea: 14.9%.
She was rescuscitated with D5 1/2 NS with 3 amps of bicarb followed by NS PRN to maintain CVP > 10.
A C. difficile study on [**11-27**] was negative, and her abdominal exam is benign.
