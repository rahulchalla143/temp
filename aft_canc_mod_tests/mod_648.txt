Patient underwent head CT which initially showed no pathology.
Underwent repeat LP to send off AFB, HSV PCR, VZV PCR- all of which were negative.
Neuro consulted and recommended STAT CT head, which was negative, as well as MRI.
MRI showed acute pontine infarct at the level of his leptomeningeal disease.
EBV PCR returned positive so LP was repeated for flow cytometry given concern for CNS lymphoma.
CXR showed new left consolidation with left retrocardiac opacity and increased left pleural effusion (concern for pneumonia, per radiology) so patient treated for VAP.
Repeat MRI showed new bilateral cerebellar infarcts.
CTA and cardiac enzymes were negative.
Last sodium value was 143.
INR also trended up.
Underwent RUQ- showed coarsened hepatic architecture with no focal solid mass identified.
Monitored LFT's- trended down over remainder of hospital course.
TB medications were resumed after remainder of work-up was negative without another bump in LFTs.
