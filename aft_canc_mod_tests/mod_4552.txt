She presented in severe respiratory distress with a room air saturation of 73% and subsequently was placed on BiPap.
Her WBC count was noted to be 19.3 (83%PMN) with a CXR showing patchy bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia.
Her vent was set to CMV Vt420, Rate20, PEEP12, Fi02100%.
Nevertheless there appear to be both widespread interstitial pulmonary abnormality as well as bibasilar consolidation, cardiomegaly, vascular engorgement and an indeterminate volume of pleural effusion.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
[**2108-5-24**] - CT head w/o contrast: No acute intracranial process, although this study is limited due to patient motion.
- CT chest/abd/pelvis: 1.
[**2108-5-29**] MR head w/o contrast: 1.
Correlation with endocrinologic labs could be helpful.
The apparent findings involving the gland on the prompting study were likely technical/artifactual in nature.

She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Her initial presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] was consistent with [**Doctor Last Name **]/ARDS with very poor oxygenation.
Sputum culture was negative.
She was weaned off norepinephrine and was able to maintain her BP with good urine output.
She developed acute renal failure from ATN with admission Creatinine of 0.6.
Her urine sediment showed muddy brown casts consistent with ATN.
Her urine output improved over time.
She was noted to have right eye ptosis and disconjugate gaze; MRI of the head was performed which did not show lesions to explain symptoms.
The MRI of the head showed high signal in pituitary likely hemorrhage vs. adenoma, 1 week later a dedicated MRI of the pituitary with contrast revealed no abnormalities and the radiologist thought the initial findings were most likely artifact.
She had elevated AST with normal ALT that was thought to be from alcoholism but repeat LFTs returned to [**Location 213**].
She suffered acute kidney injury from ATN with a peak creatinine of 2.2, this improved to 1.3 upon discharge.
She has proteinuria with a protein/creatinine ratio of 0.9 so when her creatinine reaches baseline or a new baseline the [**Last Name (un) **] would be indicated.
OT was consulted for cognitive evaluation and recommended outpatient occupational therapy.
