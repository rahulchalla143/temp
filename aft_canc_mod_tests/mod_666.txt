[**2205-1-20**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION: Essentially unremarkable chest CT without evidence for infection or metastatic disease.
MRI [**1-17**]: Large mass almost completely replacing the right lobe of liver with invasion of the right portal vein.
The imaging features are far more suggestive of tumor than abscess.
EKG [**2205-1-16**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2205-1-8**] atrial fibrillation is new.
EKG [**2205-1-17**]: Normal sinus rhythm.
CXR [**2205-1-16**]: FINDINGS: Midline sternotomy wires are unchanged.
[**1-17**]: RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: There is a large mass in the right lobe of the liver which is echogenic and does not demonstrate any detectable flow on Doppler images.
RUQ ultrasound showed a large mass which was further investigated with MRI.
After consultation with Oncology and Hepatology, a triple phase MRI was performed which confirmed the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
4) CHF - The patient was noted to have peripheral edema, which was thought to be secondary to fluid resuscitation.
No source of infection was found, and a chest x-ray and CT showed no signs of pneumonia.
