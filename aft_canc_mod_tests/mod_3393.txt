Admission Date:  [**2132-4-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-5-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-7-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 552**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea and hypoxia following resection of left renal mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L nephrectomy Bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: This is a 41 year old man with a PMH significant for Factor V Leiden mutation, who is now POD2 s/p resection of a left renal mass, who had episodes of oxygen desaturation on the floor and for whom a CT showed likely mucus plugging.
He originally presented with back pain and in the process of workup for this got an MRI which incidentally showed a 2 cm left renal mass.
A CT scan confirmed the presence of the mass.
At midnight [**Date range (1) 62333**], he had a trigger on the floor for hypoxia and fever, with temp 102.2 and O2 saturation of 87% on 3.5L NC.
An ABG at that time was 7.38/52/74 on 5L NC.
A PE protocol CT chest was ordered stat, and a provisional read showed "Small left pneumothorax... [and] obstructive atelecatsis of the left lower lobe and right middle and lower lobe due to fillings of the lower lobe bronchi, most likely mucous plug."
An EKG done around that time appears to show diffuse T-wave flattening compared to his earlier pre-op EKG but otherwise without diagnostic focal changes.
On the floor today, he continued to be febrile for much of the day, with Tmax of 102.8 at 1415; he continued to require oxygen support of 5L NC with 40% facemask for much of the day, with oxygen saturations in the mid 90s to this.

Obstruction of the bronchus intermedius and all segmental bronchi of the left lower lobe, likely due to mucus plugging, causing complete collapse of the middle lobe, right lower lobe, and almost all the left lower lobe.
Echo The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Hypoxia - [**12-31**] to multiple etiologies.
Hx of L renal mass sp partial nephrectomy - Urology following.
Hx of Factor V Leiden mutation and DVT - seen by heme preop and coumadin w goal INR of [**12-31**].5 4-6 weeks post op.
His INR was supratherapeutic in ICU, so coumadin was held and vitamin K given, Coumadin restarted at low dose.
INR on day of dc was 1.9.
Discussed w primary hematologist and dc on coumadin alone at 2mg MWF and 1mg T,T, Sat, [**Doctor First Name **] dose and INR check on monday .
Anemia - likely from post-op blood loss.remained stable throughout hospital stay around 30-31. .
Please follow up with them regarding INR checks and coumadin adjustment Please call your doctor right away or return to ED for fevers, chills, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of [**Last Name (LF) 1440**], [**First Name3 (LF) 691**] concerning signs of infection at the incision site, worsening diarrhea  Followup Instructions: 1.
