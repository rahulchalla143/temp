MRI prior to rescetion showed increase in size compared to [**Month (only) 404**].
CT torso [**2166-1-17**] significant for enlarged retroperitoenal and iliac LNs.
A head CT showed no hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
High-dose methotrexate delayed for iliac lymph node biopsy and bone marrow biopsy to exclude systemic lymphoma.
Pelvic LN biopsy done [**2166-3-3**], results pending, but early review showed abundance of lymphocytes, not appearing aggressive like CNS lesion.
- PENDING final pathology of pelvic LN and bone marrow.
Followed serum sodium [**Hospital1 **].
Followed sodium levels [**Hospital1 **].
Pathology showed this to be an aggressive lymphoma, so you were transferred to the Oncology service to start chemotherapy.
Before you were given chemotherapy, a pelvic lymph node biopsy was done because a CT scan had shown enlarged lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen.
A bone marrow biopsy was also done to complete staging.
High-dose methotrexate chemotherapy was given [**2166-3-5**] and you tolerated this well, but will need to take an additional day of sodium bicarbonate and leucovorin to help the kidneys continue excreting the chemotherapy.
You were also followed by Endocrinology for diabetes insipidus and SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone) causing high and low sodium levels.
This was treated with DDAVP and careful monitoring of sodium levels.
