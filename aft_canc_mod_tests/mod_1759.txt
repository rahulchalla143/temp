She also had CXR evidence of LLL pneumonia and had been discharged on levaquin, which she has taken.
- [**2100-7-13**]: Skin Bx 2: Atypical superficial and deep dermal lymphoid infiltrate containing CD30-positive cells and showing epidermotropism.
PCR analysis for the T-cell receptor gamma gene showed two sharp bands with a migration pattern suggestive of a clonal rearrangement.
- [**2100-8-24**]: [**Hospital **] clinic: WBC 10.6 with 57% Lymphocytes S?????
Due to her high count of circulating S?????
- [**2100-9-8**] CT scan: Infiltrating, hypo-enhancing lesion in the R. kidney (?infiltrating neoplasm vs pyelonephritis) compatible w/ lymphomatous involvement of the kidney but was not present on a follow-up scan on [**2101-1-21**].
- [**2101-1-10**]: Interferon alpha at 3M units 3x/wk given w/ with photopheresis every other week and PUVA.
- [**2101-1-26**]: Interferon alpha increased to 6Munits 3x/wk; PUVA was d/ced [**12-26**] side effects.
- [**2101-2-23**]: Interferon alpha decreased to 4.5Munits 3x/wk on [**2101-2-23**] b/c fatigued.
- [**2101-8-4**]: The patient presented for a follow-up evaluation with clear evidence of disease progression.
- [**2101-8-25**]: Mtx added to interferon alpha and bexarotene and the dose was up-titrated to 45mg weekly.
Biopsy showed cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with large cell transformation, involving the panniculus with an unusual angiocentric pattern.
- [**2102-2-9**] 3M units TIW Interferon alpha restarted - [**2102-3-9**]: Due to the observation that peripheral T-cells contained floret-like nuclei, immunophenotypic analysis was performed on peripheral blood, revealing findings consistent with involvement by patient's known T cell lymphoproliferative disorder as well as CD25 co-expression in a significant population of the neoplastic CD3+ lymphocytes, suggesting a diagnosis of HTLV-1 associated lymphoma.
PCR for HTLV-1 DNA was positive.
- [**2102-8-18**]: Evaluation in the [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital 3242**] clinic: good candidate for allo SCT.
- [**2102-9-26**]: CT scan: s/p 3 mo off therapy: stable to improved disease: lymph nodes in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, are stable to decreased in size since [**2102-7-28**], with no new pathologic LAD identified.
- [**2102-12-25**] Initiation of ONTAK therapy Cycle 1 [**2102-12-25**], Cycle 2 [**2103-1-15**], Cycle 3 [**2103-2-5**], Cycle 4 [**2103-2-26**], Cycle 5 [**2103-6-4**], Cycle 6 [**2103-7-2**] - [**2103-4-26**]: 2 weeks of total skin electron beam therapy at the [**Hospital3 2358**] under the care of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3403**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Therapy was held  [**2103-5-18**] through [**2103-5-24**] [**12-26**] fatigue.
