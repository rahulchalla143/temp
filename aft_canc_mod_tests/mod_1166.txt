She presented to [**Hospital3 17163**] where she reportedly coughed blood in ED with a stable Hct of 31.6 -> 32.9 and BP 110 near her baseline.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of her hematemesis vs hemoptysis.
Of note, the patient reportedly has had several GIB's in the past due to a Dieulafoy lesion including a recent episode in [**2158-6-7**] during which she was intubated with a hct 20 and 500cc bloody NGT output.
She had an EGD at [**Hospital3 17162**] at that time which showed a Dieulfoy lesion with active bleeding which was clipped x2, and she was discharged on PPI for chronic suppressive therapy.
She reports that since her discharge, she has experienced continued nausea but denies any abdominal pain or hematemesis.
In [**Hospital1 18**] the ED, initial VS: 98.0 70 96/62 16 97% 2L Nasal Cannula The patient was found to have mild abdominal discomfort and on rectal exam, had brown, guiac positive stool.
Her Hct was stable from the findings at [**Hospital3 17163**], and her BP's remained at her baseline in the 100's.
INR was 3.5.
NG lavage revealed flecks of blood which were guiac positive, and subsequently put out 200cc of bright red blood mixed with stomach contents.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient reported continued abdominal pain but denied nausea, hematemesis, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness.

She underwent an EGD which showed 4 cords of grade I esophageal non bleeding varices, large hernia with possible para-esophageal component, protruding 4 -5 mm polypoid lesion in the stomach body.
The polyp was not biopsied given the patient's elevated INR and she will need a repeat polypectomy.
Coagulopathy, s/p Mechanical Valves x3: Patient with aortic, mitral, tricuspid valves due to endocarditis, INR goal between 2.5-3.5 with current INR goal closer to 2.5 given GIB weighed against risk of thrombus given her three mechanical valves.
Her INR was not reversed.
She was bridged using IV Heparin once her coumadin was held, and her INR went subtherapeutic.
Her LFTs were trended daily, MELD scores were obtained.
An Echo was obtained which showed as above.

During your hospital stay you developed more shortness of breath and a chest xray showed a pleural effusion on the right side.
Because of this we got a transthoracic echocardiogram (ultrasound of your heart) which showed some changes in your mechanical heart valves.
You will follow-up with your cardiologist (see below) Because one of the antibiotics we gave you during your bleeding (to prevent an infection) increased your blood thinning from the coumadin, we stopped your coumadin, and we waited for your INR to trend down to the normal range of 2.5-3.5.
However it dropped too low and this required you to be put on a continuous Heparin IV drip to keep you anticoagulated while we waited for your INR to increase to 2.5.
You will need to have your INR checked after you leave on Friday [**2158-8-18**] by the visiting nurse  The following changes were made to your medications:   Followup Instructions: Name: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Location: [**Hospital 5503**] Medical Associates Address: [**Doctor Last Name 40418**], [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 40419**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 40420**] Appointment: Monday [**8-21**] at 3:45PM  Department: DIV.
