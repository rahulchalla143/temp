Admission Date:  [**2118-8-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2118-8-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2094-5-3**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 24-year-old male with past medical history significant for bilateral PE with bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusions in [**2118-6-3**] requiring extensive MICU stay and prolonged hospitalization.
Emergency Room evaluation done at that time revealed no new clot by CTA but revealed a right atrial abnormality.
Follow-up echo showed echo dense space intimately associated with either the pericardium or the pleural space.
Repeat echo 7 days later was done with stability in the patient's symptoms.
Echo at this time showed increased size of the right sided loculated pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the RV.
Chest x-ray showed increase in heart size.
EKG showed ST elevations in 2, 3, and AVF with PR depressions in 3 and a pulsus paradoxus of 10.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.0, heart rate 90-106, blood pressure 128/76, respirations 12, satting 99% on room air.
Respirations clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count 6.3, neutrophils 58, 0 bands, 33 lymphs, 7 monos, 2 eos, hematocrit of 34.1, platelet count 270,000, sodium 141, potassium 4.6, chloride 105, CO2 21, BUN 12, creatinine 0.9, glucose 93.
Chest x-ray as dictated in the HPI.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, left and right atrial abnormalities, 1-2 mm ST segment elevations in leads 2, 3, and F, PR depression in 2.
At the time of surgery, transesophageal echocardiogram was performed and showed abnormality in the right atrium consistent with perforation with overlying clots and fluid loculated on pericardial effusion.
He was taken to the operating room again on [**2118-8-11**] where the patient underwent median sternotomy with exploration of his cardiac anatomy.
His postoperative course was complicated by significant blood loss requiring a number of blood transfusions to maintain a hematocrit between 25 and 30.
At that time it was noted to have a large re-accumulation of fluid in his right hemithorax on chest x-ray as well as a small pneumothorax.
Drainage of 2 liters of bloody fluid was yielded.
Follow-up chest x-ray throughout the remainder of the hospital course showed resolution of the patient's pneumothorax and stability in a small right sided pleural effusion.
Follow-up CAT scan revealed abnormality consistent with tumor and postoperative changes along the right cardiac border with bilateral atelectasis.
Follow-up staging abdominal CT was performed during this hospitalization which revealed no evidence of metastases, showed a small right inguinal seroma.
Multiple cultures were obtained which remained negative.
The patient was placed briefly on Vancomycin and Ceftaz but after pan CT revealed no evidence of fluid collection or infectious etiology, these antibiotics were discontinued.
The patient required several blood transfusions, platelet transfusions, FFP and cryoprecipitates during his surgery and occasionally after to maintain hematocrit between 25-30.
Echocardiogram was performed on [**8-21**] to evaluate this pericardial friction rub which revealed no pericardial effusion, stable LV and RV function.
Pulmonary:  The patient had to rule out the possibility of DVT leading to PE secondary to concerns over his chest pain.
The patient's oxygen saturation was maintained between 94 and 95% on room air at the time of discharge.
Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  The patient was tolerating full diet on discharge.
Pathologic diagnosis revealed angiosarcoma of low grade type.
