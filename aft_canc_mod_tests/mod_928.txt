EMS had responded and she was brought to [**Hospital3 7362**] where repeat CT imaging was performed.
She has no brothers or sisters   Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: O: T: 98.0  BP: 114/73   HR: 69   R 18     O2Sats 99% RA  Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD, sleepy as pt just received narcotics for headache.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch  Coordination: dysmetria R>L  Exam on Discharge: Left craniectomy defect.
No dysphasia   Pertinent Results: CT Head w/o contrast obtained at the OSH shows a stable appearance of L SDH with MLS.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2117-11-7**]: Redemonstration of left subdural hematoma, which is stable in size from one day prior, without evidence for new hemorrhage.
MR IMAGING BRAIN W/WO CONTRAST [**2117-11-8**]: 1.
Left subdural hematoma with mass effect and midline shift of approximately 11 mm towards the right.
CT head [**11-9**] Expected post-surgical changes after left frontoparietal craniectomy.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The degree of rightward shift of the normally- midline structures is, in fact, stable or slightly improved from the MR study of [**11-8**], when it measured 11.5 mm.
CT head [**11-11**] 1.
Mass effect is also noted on the upper midbrain structures along with a component of cerebral edema.
Left-sided extra-axial fluid collection with blood products and overlying soft tissue fluid collection with blood products, with shift of the midline structures to the right side by 1 cm and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle, not significantly changed from the recent study of CT head of [**2117-11-14**], attention on close followup as clinically indicated.
While there is no significant change in size compared to the recent study of [**2117-11-8**], the left parasagittal meningioma has increased compared to the study of [**2110**].
Nonvisualization of the mid portion of the superior sagittal sinus, related to the invasion by the known left frontal parasagittal meningioma, as seen on the prior study as well.
Obliquie Chest X-ray [**2117-11-16**] Nodular opacity in the right mid lung that appears to be intrapulmonary.
CT head [**2117-11-17**] Little change from [**2117-11-14**].
A Dilantin bolus of 300 mg IV was also administered upon transfer.
Repeat CT head imaging was performed on [**2117-11-7**] showing redemonstration of a left subdural hematoma, which was stable in size from prior, without evidence for new hemorrhage.
Post -op CT showed less midline shift and expected post-op changes.
On [**11-11**], the patient had a repeat CT head which showed evidence of improving midline shift and her neurologic exam seemed to be steadily improving; the patient was more responsive and alert, following commands for favorably.
She passed a bedside speech/swallow evaluation and PO medications and a regular diet was initiated.
Her sodium level started increasing.
On [**11-15**] patient's speech improved and exam nonfocal.
EEG showed R central and temporal activity consistent with seizure activity and Keppra was increased to 1250 [**Hospital1 **].
On [**11-16**], her oblique chest x-ray was done.
It is recommended that you undergo CT imaging of the chest to evaluate this nodule as an outpatient.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
** You were found to have a pulmonary nodule on Chest X-ray during your hospitalization which was NOT causing any symptoms.
It is recommended that you undergo CT imaging of the chest as an outpatient to evaluate this incidental pulmonary nodule.
You will need a CT scan of the brain with contrast.
