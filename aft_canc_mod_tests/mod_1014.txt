brain imaging including MRI showed acute hemorrhagic lesion with contrast enhancement in the right frontal motor strip, common, small, more anterior one.
Pertinent Results: CT HEAD NONCONTRAST FINDINGS:  There is slight interval increase in the size of the right parietal lobe hyperdense mass compared with the prior CT examination, currently measuring 1.8 cm.
The other punctate right frontal metastasis seen in prior MR examination is not visualized.
Hyperdense right parietal lobe metastasis, which appears slightly larger when compared to the previous CT examination dated [**7-2**].
CT TORSO: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Small lymph nodes are noted in the right axilla as well as in the left axilla.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Two hypodense lesions in the left lobe of the liver are unchanged.
It is in retrospect identified on the prior study where it measured 0.7 x 0.8 cm.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The small bowel is unremarkable.
Previously, this node did not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Two of the liver metastases seen on the prior studies are decreased in size.
MRI HEAD: Again seen is a homogeneously enhancing mass involving the left parietal lobe which measures approximately 2.3 cm in size.
This is not significantly changed compared to the CT scan from [**2138-8-6**] but has increased since the MR from [**2138-7-11**].
MRI NECK: FINDINGS:  No prior studies are available for comparison.
CT HEAD [**2138-8-11**] COMPARISON:  [**2138-8-6**].
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2138-8-19**] 8:53 AM  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  Reason: evaluate postoperative tumor residual Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 61 year old man s/p craniotomy tumor resection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate postoperative tumor residual CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
COMPARISON: MRI of the brain of [**2138-8-16**], [**2138-8-15**] and [**2138-7-11**].
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted images of the brain were obtained before and after the uneventful intravenous administration of Magnevist.
MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: Postoperative changes are again seen in the right parietal region.
Edema within the right frontal, parietal, and temporal regions appear similar to the preoperative study.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
After 2 attempts at weaning, we decided he had failed a mannitol taper and a functional MRI was ordered to further assess if the patient is a candidate for surgical resection without too much compromise of his physical ability given that he is left handed.
