Brief Hospital Course: 64yoF with alcoholic cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, CHF EF of 40-45% on [**2-/2183**], DM presenting who presented to [**Hospital3 **] with palpitations and lightheadedness on [**1-18**] initially treated for possible PE with anticoagulation who was then found to have an gastric ulcer with down-trending hematocrit, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
She underwent a VQ scan which showed an indeterminate result and was started on anticoagulation.
She then was noted to have a downtrending HCT from 28 to 22.
Repeat VQ scan was negative and anticoagulation was stopped.
She underwent an EGD and was found to have a gastric ulcer, 1.5cm in body of the stomach with overlying clot that was washed as clear as possible, no distinct vessel noted, injected with epinephrine and completely cauterized.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
She is a Jehovana's Witness and refused blood transfusions.
She was aware of the risks of end organ ischemia and possibly death if her blood counts become critically low.
She then returned to the ICU for repeat EGD which showed the gastric ulcer with scant oozing.
Her HCT remained stable and she was able to tolerate diet.
She was found to have small effusion on exam and xray.
Cardiomyopathy/CHF: Patient has history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with lowest EF 17-20% in [**2181**], last TTE in [**2-22**] showed EF 45-50%, likely improved function after stopping alcohol use.
EGD on admission showed grade I nonbleeding varices.
