Head CT [**11-26**]: There is a 14 mm ovoid hyperdense focus in the left frontal lobe, consistent with hemorrhage at the site of the patient's known metastatic lesion.
The other small areas of FLAIR hyperintensity present on the current study were present previously and no underlying enhancing lesions are seen, most consistent with small vessel disease.
EEG [**11-27**]: ABNORMALITY #1: Sharp and slow wave complexes over the left anterior quadrant occurred during wakefulness with a frequency of 0.5-1 Hz.
An EEG showed L frontal spikes occuring approximately every 5 seconds.
As her exam improved she was transferred to the floor.
She had an MRI by cyberknife protocol on [**11-26**], which showed a new cerebellar lesion in addition to her frontal lesion.
Her radiation oncology, neurooncology, and neurosurgical teams were notified of this.
On discharge her exam was significant for a mild non-fluent aphasia as above and mild R sided UMN pattern weakness and R NLF flattening.
