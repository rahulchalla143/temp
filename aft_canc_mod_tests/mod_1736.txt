A diagnostic paracentesis in the RLQ was performed with minimal fluid taken off.
CT ab/pelvis showed increased intraabdominal ascites with increased nodularity in the omentum and peritoneum since recent ([**2124-10-9**]) scan.

Cursory examination of the abdomen reveals a significant interval decrease in the amount of ascites consistent with recent paracentesis.

Throughout this last hospitalization, the patient's WBC count rose from < 10 to the high 20s and once to >40 with lymphocytic predominance and many smudge cells.
CT did not reveal any liver masses.
MRI on [**10-25**], however showed that the direction of blood flow has been returned to [**Location 213**] without any intervention.
DEspite this, his LFTS remained elevated and his total bilirubin continued to rise.
Gram stain negative for organisms, however many lymphocytes were found in the fluid which could correlate with his CLL.
His SAAG >1, so ascites likely secondary to portal HTN +/- HBV reactivation +/- hepatic infiltration from CLL.
There were 895 WBC in the fluid and Albumin was 0.5. .
Patient had a MELD score of 28 which indicated that the patient had an extremely poor short term prognosis.
# Renal Failure: - From [**10-18**] - [**10-27**] patient's Cr rose from 0.7 -> 3.7 - Hepatorenal syndrome was considered to be high on the differential for this given [**Last Name (un) 8692**] liver failure.
Patient had decreasing urine output and renal service was asked to consult on how to improve urine output.
Hemolytic anemia- Will continue prednisone 5 mg qday.
Patient was transfused to stabilize Hct as necessary.
His electrolytes were repleted PRN.
In addition, she felt at this time that if his BP < 65/45, that he should be placed on pressors.
