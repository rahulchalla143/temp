Laminectomies T4, t6 4.
An MRI was performed on day of admission which reveals multiple spinal mets with significant collapse of the T5 vertebral body with epidural extension and marked canal narrowing with cord impingement at this level.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: -- On [**2117-7-22**], MRI revealed a 3.2 cm solid exophytic lesion arising from the lower pole of left kidney suspicious for clear cell renal cell carcinoma and a 1.6 cm solid lesion in the anterior left pole of the left kidney and a 2.4 cm lesion in the mid pole of the right kidney, both of which concerning for tumor cell carcinoma, papillary type.
Given its small size, he was recommended to have followup imaging ([**2117-7-22**] MRI at [**Hospital1 18**] compared to CT without contrast from  [**2117-4-2**]).
-- On [**2118-1-13**], he underwent repeat MRI, which showed no significant change and bilaterally no masses.
-- On [**2118-9-28**], he underwent repeat MRI, which revealed significant interval increase in the lower pole of the left kidney obstructing mass, now measuring 4.9 x 3 cm from 3.1 x 2.7 cm and development of nodules in the perinephric fat, consistent with extrarenal spread suspicious for clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and there were also two other lesions that were minimally increased in size.
Of note, the clear cell renal cell carcinoma shows no areas of signaling, no definitive sarcomatoid differentiation.
He was noted to have a low O2 and underwent a chest x-ray, which noted a 5 cm elliptical opacity in the left upper hemi collapse with apparent adjacent local destruction, new since [**18**]/[**2118**].
--On [**2119-4-17**], CT abdomen and pelvis revealed a 5.1 x 2.2 soft tissue density lesion with destruction of the third posterior lateral rib, fluid collection in the right partial nephrectomy bed with a seroma.
