Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
Evaluation of the hepatic arteries was also suboptimal due to patient difficulty breath-holding.
Colonoscopy report: Two 3mm sessile polyps of benign appearance were found in the sigmoid colon.
Impression: The exam of the esophagus was normal.
Capsule study pending  If clinical concern persists, repeat examination could be attempted.
Brief Hospital Course: Brief Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 19122**] is a 78F with PMH of cardiomyopathy (EF 45% per OSH records), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, questionable liver cirrhosis, recent ERCP [**2179-1-29**] with sphincterotomy given CBD, discharged on [**2179-1-31**], who was transferred for Hct drop and dark stools.
She was admitted to the ICU for EGD and monitoring.
EGD showed post-sphincterotomy bleed, which was injected with epi.
In discussion with her outpatient providers, we learned that she had been admitted to [**Hospital3 3765**] in [**2178**] with a hematocrit of 20 with guaiaic positive stool.
To evaluate this previous anemia she had an colonoscopy and capsule study.
Two benign appearing polyps were found during the colonoscopy, and these were sent for evaluation by pathology.
Hematocrit was 33.
Evaluation with hematology would be a next step.
She had a TTE and TEE that did not demonstrate vegetation on heart valve or on pacemaker lead.

Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital from [**Hospital1 4494**] for evaluation of bleeding.
You received blood, and your hematocrit is now 33.8, and you have not had any additional blood loss.
Subsequent blood cultures showed that the bacteria had been cleared from your blood with this treatment.
You were also seen by our gastroenterology team in evaluation of anemia (low blood count) that your doctors [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] were evaluating.
You had an endoscopy and colonoscopy that were not revealing, and a capsule study to look at your small intestine.
We are awaiting final results on the capsule study, but it appears not to show any source of blood loss.
Since your blood count has been stable for several days, please resume your lovenox and coumadin at home tonight.
