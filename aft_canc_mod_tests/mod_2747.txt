Additionally, it was noted that the patient had intraoperative bradycardia as well as ectopy, cardiac laboratories were sent and found to be within normal limits.
Her CKs were elevated postsurgically, but she had a normal MB fraction and troponin.
A review of her in's and out's on the first day of her hospital course showed that she received 5.2 liters in the OR, PACU, and floor, and put out 510 cc of urine output.
On postoperative day #1, urine culture was sent and later revealed Klebsiella that was pansensitive, for which she was started on levofloxacin.
An arterial blood gas was obtained revealing a pH of 7.31, pCO2 of 53, pO2 of 50, bicarb of 26, and base deficit of -1.
The chest x-ray revealed a right pleural effusion as well as a CHF-like pattern.
Based on this blood gas and the patient's deteriorating respiratory status, she was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring, she was given 20 mg of IV Lasix for diuresis, and she was put on a nonrebreather and found to be sating improved at 96%.
On postoperative day #2, repeat blood gas showed a pH of 7.33, pCO2 of 54, pO2 of 53, and a bicarb of 30 on 70% O2.
A search for the cause of her desaturations was made, and an echocardiogram was obtained revealing an abnormality of the septal motion and pattern of the right ventricle as well as mild left atrial dilatation, but was otherwise normal revealing normal left ventricular function with an EF greater than 55%.
A CT angiogram was performed that was negative for pulmonary embolus, however, was significant for opacification bilaterally of her lower lobes as well as right upper lobe consolidation that was consistent with a pneumonia.
On postoperative day three, she was noted to have several PAC's with ectopy on the monitor with an EKG revealing atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, as well as a left bundle branch block.
A cardiac consultation was obtained on the basis of her ectopy and their assessment revealed that her rhythm was consistent with episodes of atrial fibrillation with superimposed rate dependent left bundle branch block, with no evidence of ventricular tachycardia.
Patient was additionally transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 27.5 which improved to 30.8 status post transfusion.
That night, the patient spiked to a temperature of 101.0, however, a workup of blood cultures, urine cultures, and changing the central venous line was negative.
Her midline wound was found to be tender, hard, as well as mildly erythematous stretch of 2.5 cm.
On postoperative day #12, the patient was transferred to the floor after a chest x-ray revealed improved right upper lobe aeration and improving consolidation in the lower lobes, but significant for persistent bibasilar consolidations.
The patient will have her O2 saturations checked by visiting nurses and if found to be less than 88%, she will be placed on home O2 to be followed up by her primary care provider.
