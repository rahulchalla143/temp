Pathology Examination  Name Birthdate    Age     Sex Pathology #     [**Hospital1 18**] [**Known lastname 40120**],[**Known firstname **]       [**2124-10-29**]    58 Male      [**Numeric Identifier 40121**] [**Numeric Identifier 40122**] Report to:   DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Gross Description by:   DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
MARIAPPAN/ttl Previous biopsies:    [**Numeric Identifier 40123**]  BONE MARROW BIOPSY (1 JAR).
Lack of CD34 and HLA-DR [**Last Name (STitle) 40124**] to be consistent with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia.
A repeat BM biopsy showed remission and he will continue the ATRA for now and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] for plans of stage two of his treatment.
# Fevers: He initially was on Vancomycin and cefepime when first starting treatment due to a hx of fevers at home, but as his culture data was negative and he remained afebrile his antibiotics were discontinued.
He was cultured and his blood grew strep viridans.
He also had a headache the day he spiked and a CT was done showing what appeared to be brain abscesses.
He complained of some thigh pain and we did an ultrasound showing bilateral fluid collections.
His vanco was discontinued and his counts began to recover.
A repeat CT scan showed resolution of his PNA.
Serial repeat head CTs showed slow decrease in size of his abscesses.
And an MRI of his thigh showed retained small fluid collections bilaterally.
The plan is to complete 6 week course of the above antibiotics for his brain abscesses.
We will reimage his thighs with an MRI as an outpatient and depending on those results, he will either need surgical drainage or still prolonged course of abx.
CT head revealed small foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
On [**3-24**] follow-up Head CT revealed interval increase in hemorrhage but without appreciable midline shift or infarction.
The pt's neurologic exam remained stable.
A repeat head CT one month after a fall showed the brain abscesses that were discussed above.
He also required heparin and then lovenox for DVTs, and repeat head CTs while on these anticoaulants remained stable and without new bleeds.
MRI or the T/L-spine revealed no evidence of acute cord compression.
His blood pressures remained stable and he was started on metoprolol.
His high rates were 130s-140s; he contined to have afib on and off for about a week and then remained in NSR the week prior to discharge.
His metoprolol was titrated to 25 mg tid for good rate control.
Because of his new afib, though, we did ultrasounds and found him to have DVTs in R leg, R arm (because he was edematous and had pain around a new PICC line).
Repeat head CT showed no bleed.
He also had a VQ scan during these findings of DVT that showed low prob of PE.
You were found to have low blood counts and a bone marrow biospy showed that you have leukemia.
You also had some small areas of bleeding in your head that were stable based on repeat CT scans.
Followup Instructions: Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] on [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] 7 on Tuesday [**2183-5-13**] at 1:30 pm.
You will need a repeat MRI prior to seeing Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
