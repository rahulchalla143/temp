COMPARISON: CT scan dated [**2183-10-30**] and plain films dated [**2183-11-20**].
Multiplanar reformatted images were also obtained.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST The imaged portions of the lung bases are clear.
The superior mesenteric artery, celiac artery, and inferior mesenteric arteries all appear patent.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The bladder is unremarkable.
Further evaluation could be performed with a barium enema to assess for passage of contrast through this level.
KUB ------- Compared to CT torso of [**2183-10-30**].
There is diffuse distention of the large bowel to the level of the distal sigmoid colon, at which point there appears to be an abrupt cut off which corresponds to an area of serosal implant seen on the prior CT of [**2183-10-30**].

Chest Xray -------------- Admission [**2183-11-21**] Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2183-3-2**].
CT scan and KUB showed evidence of large bowel obstruction.
She was taken to the operating room on HD 1 where she underwent an exploratory laparotomy, abdominal colectomy, sigmoid mucous fistula and ileostomy,  transgastric gastrojejunostomy, tube placement and splenic flexure takedown.
Urine output was improved and she was afebrile.
Hct was stable at 29.6.
Blood glucose was evaluated and treated with RSSI.
At POD 3 an ECHO was performed which was WNL with LVEF>55%.
Blood pressure was elevated and continued to be controlled with IV metoprolol.
Blood pressure was elevated.
She was febrile to 101.4 Urinalysis was negative.
Urine and blood cultures were sent.
CXR was negative.
At POD 8 the ostomy output continued to be high at >4000cc.
Blood, urine and line tip cultures from POD5 were negative.
Ostomy output remained high at 1575cc but was certainly improved from initial post operative bowel function recovery.
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for htn: Please hold for SBP <110 and HR <65.
