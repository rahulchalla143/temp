BP on the field was 173/114.
She was sent to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital where a CT showed R MCA hemorrhage.
Past Medical History: Migraine, arthritis, osteoporosis, HTN - no meds last 6mo due to no insurance.
Toes neutral bilaterally   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the intensive care unit, her BP was kept strictly less than 130.
On HD1 she underwent a cerebral angiogram which showed: an approximately 7 x 5 mm aneurysm of the bifurcation of the right middle cerebral artery with an approximately 2 mm neck and multiple M2 segment branches arising from the aneurysm.
Postoperatively she underwent angiogram #2 and she was found to have an approximately 3 mm moderate focal stenosis of the distal M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery just proximal to the clip site.
A CT scan was performed on [**7-16**] and [**7-17**] showing slight interval increase in size of large right frontotemporal intraparenchymal hematoma with slightly more mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, new pneumocephalus underlying the right frontal and temporal lobes, with new preseptal emphysema.
Neurologically she had a poor exam for the bulk of the stay, with unresponsiveness and only with limited eye opening on repeated noxious stimulation.
On [**7-19**] a CT noted increased midlineshift (MLS) and perilesional edema, and there was a question of a rebleed.
Serial CTAs were done on a regular basis to assess for vasospasm on which was demonstrated on [**7-23**] ( mild, non-occlusive ACA's bilateral and L MCA) and she was started on HHH therapy, nimodipine was continued.
Subsequent Angiograms showed mild non-occlusive vasospasm seen involving the anterior cerebral arteries bilaterally, as well as the left middle cerebral artery, verapamil given.
Staples were removed from incision which was well healed.
