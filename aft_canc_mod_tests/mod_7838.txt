The ventricles and sulci are similar in configuration compared to the study one day ago.
Evaluation of the visualized lung apices is limited by patient's respiratory motion.
The findings were communicated to the primary team, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5586**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] shortly after the completion of the study at 6 p.m.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
[**2185-9-9**] Chest CT: COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, [**2185-9-7**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired through the chest before and after administration of 100 cc of Optiray intravenous contrast.
Sagittal, coronal, and oblique reformats were generated and reviewed.
FINDINGS: Study is extremely limited due to the presence of extensive streak artifacts due to the thoracic spine fixation hardware.
The study is not tailored for evaluation of the subdiaphragmatic organs.
Assessment of the sub-segmental arteries is limited due to extensive artifacts from spinal fixation hardware and pulmonary emboli cannot be excluded.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
