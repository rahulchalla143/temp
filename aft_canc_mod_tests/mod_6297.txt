URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):       GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
Exam for further evaluation per Neurosurgery REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval masses, bleed CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 axial and coronal images were obtained following gadolinium.
Following gadolinium, subtle adjacent enhancement is suspected on the medial aspect of the lesion, but the evaluation is limited secondary to motion artifacts.
A repeat post- gadolinium study is recommended for further assessment.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired before gadolinium.
Correlation was made with the patient's preoperative MRI of [**2158-12-22**].
Blood products are seen in the left cerebellar hemisphere with small amount of air from recent surgery.
Slightly more prominent ventricular system compared to the preoperative MRI of [**2158-12-22**].
Clinical correlation and a followup CT recommended.

COMPARISON: CT of the head [**2158-12-22**] and MRI of the brain [**2158-12-23**].
Pneumocephalus in the resection site is slightly decreased compared to the prior exam and there is a similar degree of mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
Subgaleal post- operative seroma, which has evolved since the prior study.

Non-contrast images and delayed images were obtained through the upper abdomen.
CT OF THE CHEST: A 13-mm hypoattenuating lesion within the right lobe of the thyroid is seen.
Heart size is within normal limits; however, there is extensive coronary artery calcification in the LAD, left circumflex, and RCA.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There are two 1-cm hypodensities within the right lobe of the liver which do not meet CT criteria for cysts and may represent cysts or hemangiomas.
CT OF THE PELVIS: Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis is noted.
Facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy create moderate canal stenosis at L4-5 and L5-S1.
CT torso showed no malignancy, however, findings as reported previously in note.
Post op CT showed Post-operative changes in the posterior fossa without evidence of hemorrhage, herniation or new mass effect.
