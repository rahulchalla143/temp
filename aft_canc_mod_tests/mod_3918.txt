However, pre-op evaluation revealed a decrease from his baseline HCT of 40 to 31.
Colonoscopy and EGD were performed and EGD/bx revealed an esophageal mass biopsied as poor to moderately differentiated SCC.
PET CT ruled out metastatic disease.
Here for pre operative angiographic evaluation which will determine whether surgery is feasible.
