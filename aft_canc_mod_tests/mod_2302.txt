Admission Date:  [**2125-4-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-5-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-10-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5037**] Chief Complaint: Seizure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Head CT Brain MRI Abdominal MRI Renal MRI/MRA EEG pMIBI Resection of abdominal mass  History of Present Illness: 57F with PMH significant for h/o T2DM, s/p renal transplant [**2122**] on immunosuppressants (Tacrolimus, prednisone and azathioprine), who presents to the ED with occipital headache x 2 weeks.
Initial BP was 250/80 in the ED -> was given 20mg labetolol which dropped her BP to the 160's.
Non-contrast head CT done before her seizure demonstrated possible low attenuation within the white matter of the left occipital lobe and within the right occipital lobe to a lesser extent.
A second noncontrast head CT was done after the episode that demonstrated no interval change.
An EEG was also done in the ED and showed showed slowing, no nonconvulsive status per neuro read.
She was last seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**4-3**], at which point her BP was noted to be 180/90, with repeat 160/80.
Several med changes were instituted at that time: Cellcept 500mg [**Hospital1 **] was switched to azathioprine 100mg qD, epogen decreased from 3 x per week to 2 x per week due to painful injections, Crestor restarted at 20mg qD, and Lasix started at 40mg PO qD for elevated BP.
Past Medical History: DM, last a1c 7.7 in [**2123**] ESRD (2o2 IDDM and HTN), s/p renal transplant [**2122**] on immunosuppressants, episode of allograft nephropathy documented by biopsy HTN b/l thoracotomy for spontaneous PTX, [**2110**] Hyperlipidemia   Social History: Pt was raised in the Phillipines, immigrated to the US in [**2096**].

Bone Scan [**2125-5-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
LVEF of 58% .
Abd US: IMPRESSION: Following extensive evaluation of the left upper quadrant heterogeneous mass, it is felt that it likely represents an exophytic hepatic lesion arising from segment II.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brain MRI: IMPRESSION: Findings on MRI of the brain is consistent with the clinical history of hypertensive encephalopathy, with edema visualized within the white matter of primarily the posterior portions of the brain.
MR angiography is within normal limits.
CT head: IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
If further evaluation is warranted, an MRI should be performed  Brief Hospital Course: 1) Hypertensive emergency/Seizure: Mrs. [**Known lastname 36061**] had brain MRI/A/V that was consistent with occipital lobe leukoencephalopathy [**2-22**] hypertension.
Her mental status and neurological exam quickly returned to baseline, and her BP meds were titrated for optimal BP control.
Her native kidney RA had evidence of atherosclerotic 50% lesion.
CXR demonstrated an interstitial process with some suggestion of cystic disease.
Pulmonary service was consulted, and a chest CT was done, which demonstrated diffuse thin-walled parencymal cysts which, in a female non-smoker, was thought to be most consistent with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, although there were features that were not consistent.
The CT also suggested an enlargement of Mrs.[**Known lastname 36063**] pulmonary arteries.
A TTE was done, which confirmed moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
PFTs were also done, demonstrating a mild obstructive pattern, which was similar to OSH PFTs from [**2123**], and significantly worse than OSH PFTs from [**2117**].
A dedicated MRI was done of the lesion, which confirmed thin-walled septa and hypoattenuating nodules within the mass, which was thought to be associated with the spleen.
A tagged rbc scan was done, which confirmed that the mass was not a splenule or hemangioma.
A f/u U/S done to verify splenic origin of the mass rather found that it seemed to be contiguous with segment II of her liver.
A pMIBI was done as part of a cardiac w/u, which demonstrated no evidence of ischemia.
Her creatinine increased, peaking at 4.5.
An renal MRI/A of her graft and native kidney demonstrated 50% RAS of her native RA, but no significant occlusion of her graft RA other than that induced by folding of the RA.
Sodium Citrate-Citric Acid 500-334 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO BID (2 times a day).
Oxygen 2L continuous O2 by nasal canula for oxygen saturation <88% on room air 14.
You will return to the hospital next Friday for the biopsy as the surgeons have discussed with you.
