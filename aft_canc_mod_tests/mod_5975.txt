Doctors at [**Name5 (PTitle) **] nursing home started her on Remeron.
Presumably for this reason she was referred for a cardiology evaluation (appt scheduled with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] [**7-25**].)
She also received 1mg IV ativan prior to CT head which was negative.
A CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions L>R and moderate pulmonary edema.
ECG was read as unchanged from prior tracing [**9-1**].
Troponin was .29, rising to 0.36.
BNP was >8000.
Patient admitted to medicine for further work-up of CHF.
ABG 7.44/73/32 on 4L.
SBP fell from baseline 140s to a low of 67.
She was given ~100 cc NS and SBP rose into the 80s.
CT for PE could not be done secondary to poor renal function.
Echocardiocardiogram was done to evaluate for signs of R heart strain, and indeed demonstrated severe RV dilatation and abnormal septal motion consistent with RV pressure/volume overload new compared to prior echo 10/[**2127**].
PA pressures could not be estimated.
The patient's urine output trailed off to ~15cc/h, her SBP remained in the 80s, and her mental status continued to be suboptimal.
[**Hospital 75195**] transfer to the CCU was initiated for workup of new RV dilatation, apparent R sided heart failure, further diuresis in the setting of borderline hypotension and preload dependence, and altered mental status.
(Per OMR)  Family History: Per daughter: Brother with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer in his 60s or 70s.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2128-9-19**] findings as outlined are now present.
ECHO [**2129-7-19**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Pulmonary pressures cannot be adequately assessed.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-9-20**], severe right ventircular dilation is now present.
CXR [**2129-7-19**]: AP chest compared to [**7-19**], 3:46 a.m., heterogeneous bibasilar opacification has worsened.
CXR [**2129-7-20**]: Opacification at the lung bases is improving and moderate cardiomegaly may have improved as well all pointing toward decreasing cardiac decompensation and improving pulmonary edema.
Leftward displacement of the trachea at the thoracic inlet points to a space occupying lesion such as a goiter, but requires evaluation since this is a new finding since [**2128-8-25**].
EKG [**2129-7-21**]: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2129-7-20**] ventricular ectopy is resolved.
CTA Chest [**2129-7-21**]: Dilatation of the right atrium, ventricle, and pulmonary artery with filling defect in the main pulmonary artery which extends into the left pulmonary arteries.
The case was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and a decision to anticoagulate and repeat the study at a later date was planned due to elevated creatinine.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo female with dementia (AAO x [**11-26**]), CAD s/p NSTEMI in [**1-2**], TIA in [**9-1**], hypothyroidism, stable meningioma p/w increased lethargy, weight gain, and LE edema, hypoxic to 94% 4L on presentation found to be in acute right sided diastolic failure secondary to pulmonary embolism.
LENIs negative and subsequent CTA equivocal (saddle-embolic v. mixing artifact w/ suboptimal study) but submassive-massive subacute PE most likely etiology of RV failure; LV failure may have been due to RV impingement of LV filling.
Lovenox was discontinued on [**7-25**] given supratherapeutic INR of 3.2, and warfarin held [**7-25**] and restarted at 2.5mg on [**2129-7-26**].
Pt's INR to be monitored at longterm nursing facility with goal INR [**12-28**].
Her ASA was decreased to 81mg daily given starting of warfarin.
It was postulated that RV dilatation have been impinging on LV filling and forward flow due to the septal wall motion abnormality observed.
She was transferred back to the floor after ~2.5L diuresis with stable BP and O2 sats 90-94% RA.
She did receive Mucomyst for her CTA chest, and all of her medications were renally dosed.
CT head negative; urine culture negative, and blood cultures with no growth; TFTs nl; electrolytes nl; BUN elevated but not frankly uremic level.
A speech and swallow consult was sought since patient has dementia and is at risk for aspiration.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
