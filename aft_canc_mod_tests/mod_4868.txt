HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had routine labs ordered as well as CT scan of the head and C-spine.
While the CT scan of the head and C-spine revealed no abnormalities.
Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 43,000.
Creatinine of 3.7.
INR of 1.7 and lactate of 5.7.
The emergency department ordered a renal ultrasound at this time to rule out an obstructive cause of anuria and a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with PO contrast were ordered.
While awaiting the report of the CT scan however, the patient became acutely hypoxic with oxygen saturations in the 80's and was emergently intubated.
The CT scan demonstrated thickened small bowel, and large amount of ascites (of note, the patient was severely hypoalbuminemic of uncertain etiology).
A repeat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast down to the rectum now revealed stable small bowel thickening but also thickening of the transverse colon, sigmoid and rectum.
Therefore a stat GI consult was obtained to perform a colonoscopy and evaluate the extent of colonic involvement.
The colonoscopy demonstrated an area of 15 to 20 cm of mucosal discoloration with more proximal mucosal edema and friability in the splenic flexure descending colon and sigmoid, consistent with ischemia.
The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy.
She continued to have a large fluid requirement to maintain adequate filling pressures, cardiac index and tissue perfusion by SGO2 and received over 15 liters of crystalloid during the first 24 hours of her admission.
Her abdominal compartment was emergently decompressed at the bed time with an almost immediate improvement in hemodynamics.
