Came to ED for evaluation of head lac and knee pain.
Got up to go to the bathroom and heart rate jumped to 200s.
SBP dropped from 140 to 80.
150mg amio and SBP now down to 75.
Pt converted to sinus rhythm 10 minutes later and BP came up to 126/53.
His HCT at the time of admission was 24.5, no other lab values were available for comparison.
Pt had a CT scan to rule out PE that was negative for clot but did show COPD and peripheral nodular consolidations.
He was also noted to have a temp of 101.3.
On arrival to the floor, vitals 97.9 68 120/75 20 98% on 2L.

CTA Chest - 1.
CT abd/pel - 1.
Knee XR - No traumatic injury identified in either knee.
CT Neck - 1.
In this setting, there is increased risk for ligamentous and cord injury, and MRI is more sensitive for these entities.
Please correlate with clinical exam and biochemical profile.
CT Head - 1.
The peak systolic velocities on the right are 53, 60, 69, 100, and 88 cm/sec for the proximal, mid, and distal ICA and CCA and ECA respectively.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
In the setting of heart rate of 160s drop SBP to 80.
After adenosine x2, dilt x2, cardioversion x2 and dig, pt converted to sinus and blood pressure responded.
He was transferred to the floor on neo which was promptly discontinued on arrival to the floor and the patient maintained his BP in the 120.
