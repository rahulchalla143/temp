At [**Hospital6 8283**] his hematocrit was 24, platelets [**2112**].
Last CBC taken at that hospital on [**2116-7-6**], revealed hematocrit of 31 and platelets of 101,000.
Peripheral blood smear revealed a single, normal appearing platelet without clumps or schistocytes.
Repeat labs confirmed hematocrit of 24 and platelets of [**2112**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 98.6, t-max 99.1, heart rate 104, blood pressure 143/67, 100 percent on 2 liters.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
EKG normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, first degree AV block, 3 with Q wave and inverted T wave.
Chest x-ray from [**Hospital3 **], AP and lateral, appeared within normal limits, no infiltrates, cardiomegaly or lymphadenopathy.
Labs on admission white count 10.8, hematocrit 23.7, platelets less than 5, MCV 103.
INR 1.2.
Creatinine 1.4.
Amylase and lipase were normal.
The patient had a bone marrow biopsy which showed the presence of sparse megakaryocytes which looked normal, but low in number.
CT scan showed a normal sized spleen with a small infarct.
The patient was initially transfused with a goal hematocrit of 25.
At this time he has not had a colonoscopy, but once his platelet count improves and he is discharged, he should be seen by gastroenterology in followup for further workup of his GI bleeding.
Once the Foley was changed and the counts were kept at a level above 50, the hematuria resolved and at the time of dictation he has had clear urine without red blood cells for five days.
At the time of dictation creatinine is in the normal range between 0.8 and 1.
