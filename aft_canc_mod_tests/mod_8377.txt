Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2198-8-3**] Conclusions Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to akinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex; and hypokinesis of the inferior septum and basal inferior free wall.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-1-18**], left ventricular contractile function is severely reduced.
MR 3D RENDERING W/POST PROCESSING ON INDEPENDENT WS Study Date of [**2198-8-3**] 4:23 AM FINDINGS: MRA OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The thoracic and upper abdominal aorta demonstrates a normal caliber and configuration throught.
MRI OF THE CHEST: There is no evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reconstructions and subtraction images were utilized for evaluation of the above findings (series 1204, 1205, and 1206).
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2198-8-4**] at 10:48:11 AM Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-8-3**], there has been minimal change.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 71796**] is a 63 yo F with a history of CLL diagnosed in [**2187**], and asthma, who presented with chest pain which started at 11pm the night before [**Date range (1) 41463**]; found to have T-wave inversions V3-V5 and ST elevations in I and aVR just under 1mm this AM w/second troponin was 0.21 so was takenn to cath where 2 drug eluting stents were placed in LAD.
She had echocardiograms on [**8-3**] and [**8-4**] that showed severely reduced LV function with EF of 20% on [**8-3**] with minimal improvement on [**8-4**] to EF of 30%.
Repeat ECHO is planned for ~6weeks time to assess if there has been any recover of cardiac function and improved EF to determin if ICD placement is necessary.
Calcium 500 With D 500 mg(1,250mg) -400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) 1,000 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR and Chem 7 on wednesday [**8-8**] and call results to Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9347**].
Your right groin site where the catheterization was done looks very good with only minimal bruising.
Start taking Metoprolol XL to lower your heart rate and help your heart recover from the heart attack.
Start taking Lisinopril to lower your blood pressure and help your heart recover from the heart attack.
Start taking Warfarin (coumadin) to prevent blood clots now that your heart function is weak.
You will have another echocardiogram in about 1 month and you may be able to stop the coumadin if your heart function has improved.
You will need to have blood tests in 6 weeks and 6 months to check your liver function (rare side effect).
