[**2134-6-25**] - Transthoracic Echo: Intravenous administration of echo contrast was used due to poor native endocardial border definition.
Estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2).
TDI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg.
Mild (1+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal with severe global hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
- LENIS RLE: Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of the right common femoral, femoral and popliteal veins.
- X ray, L spine and T spine: AP and lateral views of the thoracic and lumbar spine were reviewed.
This is new compared to the examination of [**2133-5-21**].
- Parathyroid scan with 21.1 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi: Following the intravenous injection of tracer, images of the neck including anterior, pinhole and marker views were obtained at 20 minutes and 2 hours.
This focus appears larger and more intense in comparison to the prior study from [**2129-11-25**].
CT images of the lungs show bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral patchy areas of atelectasis of the right lower lobe as well as of the left upper and lower lobes.
2- Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis of the right lower lobe and the left upper and lower lobes  [**2134-6-29**] - CT neck with contrast: The patient is status post left hemithyroidectomy.
Its CT characteristics are nonspecific.
10-mm lymph node between levels III and IV on the left, at the upper limit of normal size.
Ground glass opacities at the imaged lung apices, better assessed on the concurrent torso CT. - CT Torso with and without contrast: CT CHEST: There is a 1.5 x 2.5 cm enhancing mass superior and anterior to the residual right lobe of the thyroid gland compatible with known parathyroid adenoma.
CT PELVIS: There is a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.
PROCEDURES/INTERVENTIONS: [**2134-6-29**] - Right basilic vein approach- double lumen PICC placement under IR guidance  [**2134-6-30**] -CXR: FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an OG tube that extends well into the distal stomach.
CXR [**7-1**]: IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of lines and tubes.
PARATHYROID SCAN Study Date of [**2134-7-5**] RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA: 21.5 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi ([**2134-7-5**]); INTERPRETATION:  Following the intravenous injection of tracer, images of the neck including anterior, pinhole and marker views were obtained at 20 minutes and 2 hours.
SPECT/CT images were obtained after the 20 minute images.
Initial images show uptake in the right thyroid lobe.
Compared to the study of [**2134-6-28**], there has been a marked change.
She subsequently underwent further imaging with thyroid ultrasound and parathyroid scan which showed a large left parathyroid adenoma.
She subsequently underwent contrasted CT neck and torso to better characterize the tumor involvement.
Her previous left thyroidectomy and parathyroid adenoma resection operative reports and surgical pathology from [**Hospital3 **] were reviewed among her inpatient and outpatient endocrinologists, surgery, and radiology.
Postoperatively, pt was monitored with daily serum PTH measurements and q6--8hr serum calcium checks.
Calcium was downward trending and had dropped to 8.9 on discharge.
#Respiratory failure: After extubation from surgery, patient developed respiratory distress with O2 sat approaching 60% and hypotension with BP 80s/50s.
CXR did not show worsening pulmonary edema.
Exam consistent with right-sided failure at admission (JVD, LE edema) and repeat echocardiogram showed non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and EF = 25%.
However, her lasix was held on the day of the CT neck/torso for renal protection given the contrast load, and the rate of the fluid was decreased slightly to avoid acute exacerbation.
Her CT neck/torso revealed pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, and anasarca.
She was restarted on 40 mg PO Lasix and 6.25 mg PO carvedilol, but her blood pressure dropped to the 80's, likely secondary to aggressive diuresis.
Her baseline SBP was ranging 80's-100's.
Patient has a baseline creatinine of around 1.2.
Her creatinine was up to 1.8 on admission.
Lasix was held on the day of her CT neck/torso given contrast dye being a nephrotoxin.
Creatinine stable at 1.5 on discharge.
Her INR on admission was 1.1.
Patient was monitored on telemetry during hospital course.
She is discharged on her home anti-diabetic agents except for metformin given her kidney disease and Cr 1.5 on discharge.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -daily Ca and PTH for 5 days after discharge -fax results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital1 **] -follow up with surgery as directed -Full code -Coumadin restarted -> continued INR monitoring as outpt -home carvedilol 6.25 mg PO BID and furosemide 40 mg PO daily were discontinued due to borderline blood pressure (SBP 80's-90's) after aggressive diuresis, may need to restart  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Information was obtained from  PCP.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 10 mL IV PRN line flush PICC, non-heparin dependent: Flush with 10 mL Normal Saline daily and PRN per lumen.
Glucagon 1 mg IM Q15MIN:PRN hypoglycemia protocol 15.
Outpatient Lab Work Vancomycin: Please check Vancomycin trough level Mondfay [**7-12**], [**2133**].
The endocrine experts evaluated you and suggested further imaging which found a parathyroid adenoma.
You had a surgery to remove the adenoma and your blood levels were checked daily.
