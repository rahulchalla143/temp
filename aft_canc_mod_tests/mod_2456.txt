A CT angiography was the liver including two 2-cm masses in the medial segment of the left lobe, two small equivocal less than 5-mm lesions in the left lateral segment, an ablation adjacent to the falciform ligament (thought to represent focal fat), and six lesions in the right lobe of the liver including a less than 1-cm lesion near the dome of the liver.
On postoperative day five, an Infusaid pump study was undertaken.
The impression from this study was that there was a nonhomogeneous pattern of uptake in the liver with relatively increased activity at the dome of the liver with considerably decreased activity in the remaining portions.
On postoperative day nine, the patient underwent an ultrasound of the abdomen because of increasing output from his surgical drain.
The impression from this study was that the patency and appropriate flow was documented in the remaining hepatic and portal veins.
A repeat study was recommended for better re-evaluation of the main portal vein.
An ultrasound on postoperative day 10 indicated that there was excellent flow in all hepatic vessels.
