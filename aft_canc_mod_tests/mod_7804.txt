The patient's vital signs were normal in the Emergency Department.
His laboratories were notable for a hematocrit of 26.0, potassium 5.6, blood urea nitrogen 61, creatinine 1.5.
Chest x-ray showed a 7.0 centimeter lesion in the posterior right upper lobe, thought to be a rounded mass versus collapsed lung distal to an endobronchial lesion.
Head CT showed multiple small calcified ring enhancing lesions, with the differential diagnoses of metastases, syssarcosis or abscesses.
For the patient's lung and brain masses, the patient was started on intravenous Dilantin on the advice of neurology, and a chest CT was ordered.
With regards to his upper gastrointestinal bleed, his hematocrit dropped from 26.0 to 22.0 in the first night with occult blood positive stool.
Upper endoscopy showed superficial linear erosions in the lower third of the esophagus, mild nonerosive gastritis and duodenitis with no erosions or bleeding.
His hematocrit was stable since the evening of [**2134-1-24**].
The plan was to repeat the colonoscopy after his alcohol withdrawal had resolved.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed temperature 98.8, pulse 73, blood pressure 111/palpable.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - pink conjunctiva, no icterus, pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Cor - regular rate and rhythm with physiologic splitting of S2.
The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 7.6, hematocrit 32.1, platelets 259,000.
Prothrombin time 13.8, INR 1.3, partial thromboplastin time 30.1.
Sedimentation rate 55.
Sodium 140, potassium 3.9, chloride 107, bicarbonate 22, blood urea nitrogen 11, creatinine 0.8, glucose 114, ALT 10, AST 18, alkaline phosphatase 78, total bilirubin 0.6, albumin 3.0, calcium 8.0, phosphorus 3.4, magnesium 1.8.
CT of the brain with and without contrast revealed hyperdense edema in both temporal lobes.
Oncology - As already noted, the patient was noted to have right upper lobe endobronchial mass on chest x-ray concerning for carcinoma, especially given the findings of what appeared to be multiple brain metastases no head CT.  CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed a large right upper lobe mass, two liver lesions in the right lobe, pancreatic mass in the body of the pancreas, read as principal lung neoplasm, with metastatic foci.
Head CT from [**2134-1-26**], showed metastatic lesions in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, with moderate edema, minimal mass effect and some calcification.
The pathology on the bronchoscopy was consistent with nonsmall cell lung cancer.
There was general agreement that head radiation therapy would be the initial starting point for palliative treatment.
Head magnetic resonance scan on [**2134-1-31**], showed multiple foci of enhancement, edema in both cerebral hemispheres, posterior fossa consistent with metastatic disease, no hydrocephalus, mass shift, hemorrhage or left meningeal enhancement that might suggest meningitis.
Gastrointestinal bleed - The patient's hematocrit was noted to decrease from 30.7 to 27.5 on [**2134-1-31**].
However, the patient did not overtly pass any blood, and his hematocrit remained stable.
He received swallowing evaluation with nasogastric tube in place and was noted to be a silent aspirator.
However, once the nasogastric was removed, repeat video swallowing study revealed that he, in fact, was not aspirating.
