Of note, pt also states that he was diagnosed with a bacterial infection in his blood in [**2143**] and treated at [**Hospital1 2025**].
CT chest was performed at [**Hospital1 18**] after discharge for follow-up on [**2143-12-16**] that showed paraseptal/centrilobular emphysema (could not rule out neoplasm of left lower lobe), multiple pulmonary nodules.
Subsequent follow-up CT chest on [**2144-2-19**] showed decreased size of left lower lobe lesion and unchanged pulmonary nodules.
It was recommended that he undergo repeat CT chest one year later but this was never done.
Vitals prior to transfer were: 99.0, 86, 162/93, 16, 91% .

CXR showed b/l mid and lower lung ground glass opacities.
CTA chest showed emphysema and bilateral perihilar ground-glass opacities and bibasal consolidations likely reflect resolving pulmonary edema or multifocal lung infections.
Numerous labs were sent to further elucidate etiology of his multifocal pneumonia.
HIV antibody was negative, HIV viral load undetectable.
Urine legionella also negative.
Induced sputum was largely unremarkable (PCP negative, legionella negative, AFB negative).
He underwent bronchoscopy [**2145-11-4**] as he was not showing improvement on treatment for CAP (continued fevers, continued hypoxia requiring 2-3L oxygen).
However, bronchoscopy had to be prematurely aborted as pt had oxygen desaturation to 70s.
[**Month (only) 116**] need lung biopsy to elucidate etiology; malignancy is a possibility.
Of note, beta glucan in blood test returned positive; urine histoplasma was pending at time of discharge, fungal/AFB blood cultures were also pending, aspergillus and cryptococcal was negative.
By time of discharge, he was weaned to room air and ambulatory oxygen saturations remained in low 90s on room air.
He was discharged with outpatient pulmonary follow-up and will need repeat CT chest and PFTs prior to his next pulmonary visit.
#Hyponatremia: Pt with sodium of 126 on admission.
Pt appeared volume depleted on admission with urine electrolytes that were consistent with volume depletion.
He was then placed on fluid restriction with slow improvement in sodium levels to 132 by time of discharge.
He should have his electrolytes rechecked at his next PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 648**].
Per records, his blood culture at that time grew fusobacter thought to be from appendix, treated with antibiotics.
Incidental finding on cxr during that hospitalization showed a pulmonary nodule which was followed up by a CT chest in [**12/2143**] and [**2-/2144**] showing left lower lobe consolidation and multiple nodules.
Blood cultures during this hospital stay did not show any growth, though fungal/AFB blood cultures were still pending by time of discharge.
Medications on Admission: [**Year (4 digits) 39730**] 25mg daily Lisinopril 20mg daily (discontinued and switched to [**Year (4 digits) 39730**] due to cough)   Discharge Medications: 1. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
)(s)* Refills:*0* 3. losartan 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
A CT scan of your chest showed wide spread pneumonia and emphysema.
This procedure had to be prematurely aborted because your oxygen levels became low and you were admitted to the intensive care unit for one night for closer monitoring.
With antibiotics and nebulizers, your oxygen levels improved and your fevers resolved.
Please talk to your PCP about scheduling [**Name Initial (PRE) **] repeat CAT scan of your chest before this appointment.
Your PCP should also recheck your electrolytes because your sodium level was low during this hospital admission and because you were started on a new medication for your blood pressure.
Your liver enzymes were also elevated during this admission.
Several blood tests were sent but we did not have the final results before you were discharged.
The following changes were made to your medications: 1) START losartan 50mg once a day for your blood pressure 2) START omeprazole 20mg once a day for heartburn 3) START albuterol inhaler 2puffs every 4-6hours as needed for shortness of breath 4) STOP hydrochlorothiazide  Followup Instructions: Department: [**Hospital1 **] When: MONDAY [**2145-11-15**] at 8:30 AM With: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7476**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7477**] Building: [**State 7478**] ([**Location (un) 86**], MA) [**Location (un) 551**] Campus: OFF CAMPUS     Best Parking: None  You will need a chest CT scan prior to this appointment.
