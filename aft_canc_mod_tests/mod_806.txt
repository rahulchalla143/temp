Biopsy with 2.2 high grade ductal carcinoma with invasion.
Progessive brain mets noted [**10-1**] and underwent whole brain XRT [**10-31**] with some regression.
Routine follow up scan [**6-1**] with interval increase in brain mets.
Head CT with multiple areas of vasogenic edema concerning for mets with minimal mass effect, no midline shift, no signs of herniation, no hemorrhage.
Cellulits [**5-30**] 3.
Pertinent Results: wbc 4.3/hct 34.4/plt 186 Na 140/K 3.5/Cl 100/Bicarb 23/BUN 23/Cr 0.8/Gluc 136 U/a neg Tox neg Ca 9.4/Mg 1.9/Phos 4.0  CT head [**2152-8-7**]: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There are subtle soft tissue attenuation nodules, isodense to the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter, seen centered in these areas, best  seen on series 2, image 20 and series 2, image 19.
Followup MRI is recommended for confirmation.
PET scan [**2152-5-31**]: Multiple new hypermetabolic lesions in the bilateral posterior occipital lobes, midline infrathalamic region, and at least three regions in the left cerebellar hemisphere.
MRI Scan [**2152-3-28**]: Multiple metastases including left frontal ares, left posterior cerebellar.
EEG - [**2152-8-9**] - preliminary findings show no epileptiform activity, finalized report pending at the time of d/c.
Now with grimacing and localization on exam so less concern for persistent seizure activity.
CT head with multiple areas of vasogenic edema consistent with mets but no hemorrhage, midline shift, mass effect.
Her dilantin level remained therapeutic at 15.
An MRI study was deferred as the patient care was assumed by her primary oncologist in New [**Location (un) **].
