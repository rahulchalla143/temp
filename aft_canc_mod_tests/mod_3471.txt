In the ED, T 96.0, BP 98/57, HR 140.
EKG showed Aflutter in the 150s as well as possible coarse Afib.
A CXR was performed which was unremarkable as was a U/A.
However, labs were significant for a leukocytosis of 14,000 with a left shift including 11% bands.
A set of cardiac enzymes were drawn which were negative.
His exam was significant for dysarthria, left gaze nystagmus, and left hemiataxia at that time.
A CT showed right posterior limb capsule lesion consistent with cavernoma.
MRI showed extensive signal abnormality involving the left temporal lobe, left superior cerebellum, and left lateral mid brain.
Neuro-oncology was consulted and felt presentation and imaging was consistent with gliomatosis cerebri.

CXR [**9-4**]: 1.
CT head [**8-13**]: 1.
MRI Head [**7-19**]: 1) Extensive signal abnormality involving the left temporal lobe, left superior cerebellum, and left lateral mid brain.
Given the additional history provided of several months of ataxia and gait difficulties, differential considerations include a low-grade neoplasm (i.e.
Correlation with clinical presentation and comparison with the recent MRI performed at an outside hospital would be extremely helpful.
2) Right parietal white matter lesion, corresponding to the CT finding is consistent with a cavernoma.

[**2107-9-7**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2107-9-12**]):       A swab is not the optimal specimen collection to evaluate body       fluids.
Blood cultures from [**9-3**] grew out Corynebacterium species.
Abdominal XRay demonstrated free air and CT abdomen/pelvis on demonstrated extraluminal collection in LLQ w/dissection of air into retroperitoneum and small B/L pleural effusions.
Pt was taken to the OR for exploratory laparotomy where it was found that he had perforated sigmoid diverticulitis.
