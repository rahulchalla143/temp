She underwent a T3,2,1 decompression & instrumentation C5-t4 on [**2-26**].
The patient's hematocrit dropped from 37 to 25 and she was transferred back to the SICU where she received an additional 3 units of blood and 4 units of FFP.
GI was consulted and she underwent a tagged RBC scan on [**2165-3-2**] which showed no active bleeding.
The patient is undergoing a colonoscopy on [**2165-3-5**] with concern for a possible diverticular bleed or disease related to her metastatic lung cancer.
Her Hct has remained stable at 29-32 over 24 hours.
PET in [**1-20**]  showed an intensely FDG avid large left apical lung mass with destruction of the left T2 through T4 ribs and T2 through T4 vertebral bodies and/or posterior elements with extension of the mass into the spinal canal at the T3 level without definite evidence for spinal cord compression.
Negative Head MRI in [**1-20**] for metastatic disease.
* S/p right shoulder fracture s/p fall * LUL lung cancer recurrence in [**2162**]   Social History: The patient lives with her husband and 2 daughters.
Physical Exam: Tc -98.8 P=101 BP=180/79 (A-line in left upper extremity) BP range from 93-180 RR=22 99% O2 on 3 liters O2  Gen - NAD, AOX3, appears much older than stated age HEENT - NG tube in place, MMM, no JVD Heart - Increased rate, regular rhythm, Grade II/VI holosystolic murmur at LUSB Lungs - CTAB anteriorly Back - Staples in place cervical, thoracic spine Abdomen - Soft, NT, ND, no HS, + BS Ext - No C/C/E, SCD bilaterally, +2 d. pedis bilaterally   Pertinent Results: CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2165-3-3**] 2:59 PM  1.
GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2165-3-2**]  IMPRESSION: No evidence of active bleeding.
C-SPINE NON-TRAUMA [**1-18**] VIEWS  [**2165-3-1**] 2:05 PM  AP AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPHS OF THE CERVICAL AND THORACIC SPINE: Comparison is made to [**2165-2-28**].
CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2165-2-25**] 4:43 PM  IMPRESSION: Large left apical mass and paraspinal mass producing marked destructive changes of the first three thoracic vertebra with invasion of the spinal canal.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2165-2-25**] 4:42 PM  IMPRESSION: Large left apical calcified mass is again demonstrated and paraspinal mass with extensive destructive change of the upper thoracic spine with material present within the spinal canal that appears to surround the cord.
[**2165-3-2**] CXR : A single portable AP view is compared to a previous examination of [**2165-1-7**].
Colonoscopy [**2165-3-6**]: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid and descending colon Internal hemorrhoids Bleeding likely secondary to diverticulosis.
- The patient received a total of 6 units of blood during this hospitalization and her hematocrit has remained stable with no more significant bleeding with her last Hct being 28.
- Goal Hct >28.
Hypoxia - The patient had an O2 requirement of [**1-18**] liters in the ICU which was likely secondary to bilateral effusions after multiple blood products in ICU and malignancy as well.
- No echo on record.
# Hyponatremia - Urine lytes confirmed that the etiology of her hyponatremia is SIADH.
Her urine sodium was high at 157 and urine osmolality 187.
