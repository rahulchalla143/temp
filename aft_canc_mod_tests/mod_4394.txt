She was seen in clinic on [**10-7**] and had a CTA chest that showed no PE, increase in left effusion, trace right effusion, decreased bibasilar peribronchiolar opacities with slight increase in peripheral right upper lobe opacities and splenomegaly with incompletely visualized wedge shaped perfusion defect in spleen concerning for splenic infarct.
She underwent CT abdomen that showed severe splenomegaly with some low attenuation geographic regions that may suggest early splenic infarctions, Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with increased size of the left effusion since the examination earlier today.
There was a question on follow up CXR about chest tube position.
She underwent limited chest CT following this that demonstrated supra-diaphragmatic placement on the chest tube.
She continues to be tachypnic to the thirties with oxygen saturations in the low 90s on 5L face mask (mouth breather)(mid 80s on room air), using accessory muscles.
Blood pressures 90s systolic on floor.

IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON CULTURE # [**Numeric Identifier 85545**]          ([**2168-10-17**]).
imaging:  CXR [**2168-10-23**]: Interval removal of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.
Chest/abd/pelvis CT [**2168-10-19**]: 1.
EKG [**2168-10-18**]: Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats.
ECHO ([**2168-10-11**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-1-26**], the degree of MR seen is slightly less.
If indicated, a TEE would better exclude a small valve vegetation.
CTA ([**2168-10-7**]): 1.
Her CT scan revealed pan lobar consolidation of LUL/ LLL and patchy involvement in the RLL too with drainage of the pleural space with the chest tube.
Bronch [**2168-10-11**] showed very thick, purulent secretions, obtained samples.
Patient was continued on abx regimen since culture data nonspecific/pending (Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/voriconazole/levoflox/acyclovir ppx).
Pna and effusions improved dramatically around the 7th, but since the 9-10th, CXR shows worsening RLL process, likely infiltrate.
Patient was CT scanned which corroborated with infiltrate as opposed to edema and patient was bronch'ed on [**10-17**], minimal secretions noted, growing stenotrophomonas [**Last Name (un) 36**] to ceftaz (bactrim best but patient has sulfa allergy; resistant to levoflox).
CXR showed worsening R sided pleural effusion and she underwent therapeutic thoracentesis with placement of a pigtail catheter with drainage of >1L serosanguinous fluid, exudative which was removed [**11-1**].
She was started on Vancomycin at time of ICU transfer for possible worsening on chest CT of infectious process.
Sputum GS showed 3+ GPCs in pairs.
She was weaned to 3L NC with RR in 20s and was deemed stable for transfer back to floor on [**10-30**].
She became increasingly hypoxic relatively rapidly and Hct was noted to be falling.
Follow up chest imaging revealed a possible empyema vs complex loculated effusion with rind.
Baseline cr of 1.3-1.4, went as high as 3.3, with metabolic acidosis and electrolyte derrangements.
She became increasingly hypotensive during her last MICU course, requiring 2 pressors at maximal dosage.
After a discussion between the patient's husband and HCP and her outpatient [**Month/Day (2) 5564**], the decision was made to not escalate care further given overall prognosis.
Postmortem exam was declined by the family.
# Anemia: likely multifactorial, [**3-9**] to blood loss from low platelets, hemolysis, and anemia of chronic disease.
chest/abd CT from [**10-19**] found no evidence of bleeding.
Have been following Hcts [**Hospital1 **] and transfusing with goal of Hct>24.
