Initially chem 7 revealed glucose 843, K 5.3, creat 1.7 (from 1.0 on discharge), bicarb 6, WBC 18.2 with 90% polys, no bands.
Repeat chemistries showed gap 35, glucose 768.
CXR showed patchy opacification R > L although low lung volumes.
EKG unremarkable for ischemic changes but revealed peaked T waves.
CT Abn/Pelvis showed a small fluid collection in the subcutaneous tissues along the incision site c/w postoperative seroma, new compression deformities at the superior endplate of T11 and L1 compared to study on [**2181-1-9**].
CXR was negative so vancomycin was stopped and a decision to continue cefepime for 7 day course ([**Date range (3) 92936**]) was made.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
There are new compression deformities at the superior endplate of T11 and L1 compared to study on [**2181-1-9**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CULTURES: URINE CULTURE (Final [**2181-3-15**]): <10,000 organisms/ml.
C. difficile DNA amplification assay (Final [**2181-3-16**]): Negative for toxigenic C. difficile by the Illumigene DNA amplification assay.
[**2181-3-14**]  BLOOD CULTURE  Pending  Brief Hospital Course: 66 F DM2, recent subtotal gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma, p/w DKA & ARF.
She was found to have glucose levels in 800, bicarb of 6, AG 39, ketones in urine.
Also WBC was elevated at 18 and Cr was 1.7.
Abd CT showed a small fluid collection measuring 2.2cm AP x 2.3cm T x 8.8cm CC in the subcutaneous tissues along the incision site most likely representative of postoperative seroma - surgery felt this was not infected and not responsible for precipitating DKA.
CXR revealed bilateral low lung volumes with areas of atelectasis at the right lung base.
Subsequent CXR revealed no evidence of infection and so the abx regimen was switched simply to cipro.
Urine cx was negative.
CT abdomen negative for infection/inflammation.
Her nausea and vomiting is unchanged since her last hospitalization at which time an upper GI series showed no obstruction and KUB was normal.
Given persistent diarrhea, stool cultures were sent - C.diff was negative.
The leading thought was that this was partially attributed to a dumping syndrome - and she was made well aware of the need to take small/frequent meals and avoid high-fat, high-sugar meals and minimize large bolus intake at a time.
Her sugars were also under better control.
Creatinine 1.7 on presentation from 1.0 on discharge.
Calcium 600 + D(3) 1 po daily 17.
Lantus 100 unit/mL 10 units Subcutaneous qam 27.
