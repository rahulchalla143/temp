In the ED, the patient's VS were 97.3, 101, 130/83 satting 95%6L nc.
He underwent CTA to r/o PE, which was negative, but showed a dense LLL pna.
His labs were notable for a leukocytosis to 14,000 with 22 bands, a creatinine of 1.7, and a lactate of 3.5.
Cardiac enzymes were negative and EKG was without ischemic changes.
Telemetry monitoring showed a narrow complex tachycardia with p waves present that lasted for about 6 minutes.
His tachycardia broke with a valsalva maneuver and his heart rate returned to the 90s.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2171-3-14**] sinus tachycardia is new.
[**2188-10-11**] CXR - CONCLUSION: Dense pneumonic consolidation in the left lower lobe.
[**2188-10-11**] CTA chest - CONCLUSION: 1.
Up to 4 mm scattered pulmonary nodules in the right lower lobe should be followed up with a chest CT in six months if the patient is at high risk of cancer.
Otherwise, followup is recommended with a chest CT in 12 months.
[**2188-10-12**] RUQ ultrasound - IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2188-10-13**] TTE - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2184-6-21**], the findings are similar.
If the clinical suspicion for iron deposition in the heart is moderate or high, a cardiac MRI ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9559**]) is suggested to assess T2*.

A cold forceps biopsy was performed for histology at the gastro-esophageal junction.
A sputum sample was obtained on admission, however, it was not a satisfactory specimen for analysis.
The patient presented with acute renal failure with a creatinine elevated to 1.7.
On discharge Creatinine was 0.7 (at baseline).
# Cirrhosis:  The patient had evidence of cirrhosis on CT scan and a subsequent RUQ ultrasound study with an elevated INR and total bili.
Hepatitis B & C serologies were negative and the patient denied alcohol abuse.
# Thrombocytopenia - The patient has splenomegaly on CT scan.
His platelet count was monitored, and came up to 187 on discharge.
# Pulmonary nodules - discovered on CT scan.
He Should obtain a repeat CT scan in [**5-1**] months to evaluate for interval changes or resolution.
Followup Instructions: Your primary care doctor will need to evaluate  your pulmonary nodules with a CT scan, and also give you a hepatitis B vaccine.
