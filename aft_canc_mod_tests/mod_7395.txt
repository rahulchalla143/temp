He is admitted for a preoperative cardiac evaluation prior to orthopedic surgery.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Examination non-focal.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 7.5, hematocrit 40.4, platelets 122.
Coagulation studies normal.
Sodium 135, potassium 3.7, chloride 96, bicarbonate 29, BUN 28, creatinine 1.3, baseline 1.1 to 1.7.
Glucose 109.
TSH 6.0 and 1001.
Urinalysis was within normal limits.
Urine culture is pending.
Chest x-ray showed an enlarged left ventricle, tortuous aorta.
The hip showed no fracture of the proximal left femur.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 61 beats per minute, left axis deviation, left ventricular hypertrophy, normal intervals, Qs in V1 through V2 and no change compared with prior EKG of 05/99.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 4334**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] Medicine Service on [**2117-3-5**] for primary work-up and treatment of a left femur fracture status post a mechanical fall.
Left femur fracture and cardiovascular clearance:  Mr. [**Known lastname 4334**] was admitted to the Medicine Service for preoperative cardiac clearance for his left femur fracture surgery.
In addition, the patient had a Persantine thallium done which showed mild to moderate partially reversible perfusion defect in the inferior wall which is more apparent when compared to his prior study.
He has an improved left ventricular wall motion with an ejection fraction of approximately 52%.
He received two units of blood and his hematocrit responded appropriately.
The recommendations of the Orthopedic Team is to continue Coumadin for six months with a goal INR of 1.5 to 2.0 for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
Therefore, the patient has a past history of the same quality of secretions through his trachea, his vital signs were stable and his examination was unchanged at that time.
He was suctioned; however, then noted to have increasing oxygen requirement and his blood pressure dropped to approximately 70 to 80 systolic overnight.
He was given multiple fluid boluses without significant response of his blood pressure and required higher levels of oxygen and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
His blood pressure stabilized and he was transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit the following morning.
He had no symptoms of urinary tract infection and we will check a urinalysis and urine culture after he has completed the Vancomycin course.
Endocrine:  The patient has his TSH checked during this hospitalization that was high at 11.
