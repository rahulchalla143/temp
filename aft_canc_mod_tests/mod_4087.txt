This study was not diagnostic of SBP (there were roughly 60 PMNs per mL in the ascitic fluid), and the culture of the ascitic fluid was negative, but the patient was empirically treated for SBP nonetheless.
She was also treated with lactulose beginning on [**9-8**], as her serum ammonia level was drastically elevated (622).
There was also a question of a LLL pneumonia on CXR (which likely would have been treated by the ceftriaxone that was started for empiric treatment of her SBP) vs. ICU psychosis.
On [**9-19**] she had a third episode of UGIB and plans were then made for transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of possible TIPS placement.
She was subsequently loaded on phenytoin and treated with fosphenytoin after a head CT was found to be negative.

Mrs. [**Known lastname 10840**] was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU Service for TIPS evaluation in the setting variceal hematemesis and hypotension.
Her variceal bleeding as evidenced by EGD evaluation (showing clotted esophageal and not gastic varicies) did not explain her initial requirement for blood pressure support.
Further, blood and urine cultures along with an abdominal CT (to search for an occult abscess, perforated viscus or infectious process) were also unrevealing.
Although the initial chest radiograph did not show a pneumonia, subsequent films showed an infiltrate in the RLL.
An ACTH stimulation test was abnormal and thus, fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone were commenced for an idiopathic cortisol deficiency.
Of note, and echocardiogram was also unremarkable, as there was no sign of a pericardial effusion or depressed LVEF to explain her hypotension.
Over the next several days, her pressor therapy was weaned, her steroids were tapered, and her hematocrit stabilized.
She was seen by hepatology and interventional radiology at [**Hospital1 18**] and a TIPS procedure was pursued, after an EGD evaluation (as above).
She had no subsequent bleeding and her HCT was stable thereafter.
This was believed secondary to ETT trauma during intubation as ENT evaluation revealed laryngeal edema.
Diagnostic possibilities were alcoholic withdrawal and brain metastasis (see below).
A TIPS was placed and she was also started on Nadolol (once her blood pressure was stable) to allieviate her portal hypertension.
6) PNA: A right lower lobe pneumonia with an accompanying effusion was seen on CT initially.
Her sputum cultures were unrevealing.
Of note, initial DIC labs were unrevealing (Fibrinogen and FDP).
9) ARF: Although her creatinine was 3.0 on presentation, it trended down to within normal limits over her course, as her shock resolved.
A bronchoscopy was pursued and via brush biopsy, atypical cells concerning for NSCLC (Squamous Cell) were seen in the LLL.
A CT of her chest showed a LLL nodule.
The pulmonologist at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital who performed the bronchoscopy was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7631**] [[**Telephone/Fax (1) 57559**]; [**Telephone/Fax (1) 34841**]).
Followup Instructions: 1) Please see your primary doctor in the next 3-4 weeks ([**Last Name (LF) 57561**],[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1903**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 57562**]).
2) Please see your pulmonologist at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital in the next three to four weeks [Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7631**] [[**Telephone/Fax (1) 57559**]; [**Telephone/Fax (1) 34841**])] for further evaluation of the lung findings that were discovered during your hospital course at [**Hospital1 1562**].
