His last chemo bevacizumab was in [**2200-7-14**].
CXR showed likely a superimposed acute interstitial process on the baseline severe emphysema, could be atypical infection such as viral or fungal etiologies though edema in the setting of emphysema may also present in this manner.
CT head showed stable compared with priors, known mets remain CT occult, no acute process.
LP was performed,  CSF showed Protein 44, Glucose 39,  WBC  33 (Poly  1, Lymph  13, Mono 8 Eos 0, Mesothe 6 and Macroph 72), RBC 3.
Blood cultures and CSF culture were submitted.
Lactate was 2.2.
