Initial workup at [**Hospital3 **] revealed anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibodies, but no cancer found.
For the possibility of a myopathy, CK was checked and was normal at 17.
ESR was 62.
For the Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] Antibody positivity, a cancer workup was initiated.
A CT torso showed a 1.4 cm subcarinal node -> interventional pulm did a transbronchial bx on [**2144-2-24**], unfortunately the results were nondiagnostic.
Final pathology showed a poorly differentiated carcinoma with neuroendocrine features.
Her white count increased in 23 on the day of admission secondary to neupogen which had been started 2 days prior.
Gyn: CT torso also showed 2cm adenexal cyst.
Patient underwent a bronchoscopy as her trach needed changing (per admission CXR), and no bronchial masses were seen.
BAL cytology was negative for malignancy.
The CT torso also revealed a LLL infiltrate, likely her resolving pneumonia diagnosed at [**Hospital1 **] s/p antibiotics course.
Her creatinie remained stable throughout the hospital admission.
DVT in [**2143-11-25**]: admission INR was subtheraputic, but then became theraputic with several higher doses of coumadin.
Coumadin restarted on [**2144-2-28**], heparin gtt to be continued until INR is between [**2-27**].
When she reaches goal INR [**2-27**] can then stop the heparin.
