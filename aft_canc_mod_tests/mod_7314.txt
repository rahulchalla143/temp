This morning while walking outside, patient reported that she fell forward due to her R side weakness and her husband noticed that she was unable to understand him, he became concerned and took her to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for further evaluation.
While at OSH, head CT was done which revealed a L frontal lesion with significant edema.

CT Torso [**11-19**]:  1.
Uterine fibroids  CTA [**11-20**]: 1.
Approximately 2.4 x 2.8 x 2.8-cm parasagittal left frontal lobe mass with associated moderate surrounding vasogenic edema and sulcal effacement, as seen on CT and MRI.
[**11-21**] CT Head Post Op: Apparent resection of the left frontal lobe mass with pneumocephalus in the operative bed and along the left frontal cerebral convexity surface.
Certainly, upon review of the CT scan from the preceding day, there did not appear to be hyperdense components within the tumor resection bed, typically seen with acute hemorrhage.
Such an issue may require follow-up MR scans as the blood is resorbed, and which more than likely are scheduled to be performed, in view of the likelyneoplastic process having just been resected.
On [**11-19**], patient had CT torso which revealed no lesions.
Neuro onc and rad onc consults were placed and patient will go to OR on [**11-21**] for resection of L frontal mass.
On mornign rounds on [**11-22**] she was sedated from pain medication, which were then decreased in strength, and her RUE and RLE were plegic however her sensation was intact.
the MRI showed blood in the resection cavity and although her exam was stable she remained in the ICU.
She developed a UTI and was placed on Bactrim and a urine culture was sent and her foley discontinued.
On the morning of [**11-24**] her neurological exam remained unchanged and she was clinically/hemodynamically stable.
she continued to work with PT and a rehab screen was initiated.
You DO NOT need to have the levels drawn or followed.
