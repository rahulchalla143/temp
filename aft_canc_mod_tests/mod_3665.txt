Pt was noted to have a burst of SVT with HR in 160s which improved with carotid massage.
Pt intubated for hypercarbia and for fluid management concern as latest cxr revealed volume overload versus underlying pna(no fevers)  [**9-8**] - Pt self-extubated in AM, reintubated in CVICU, was hypotensive, femoral a-line and RIJ triple lumen placed.
Pt taken back to OR for ~5hr exploration as to acute decompensation, bronchoscopy unrevealing, on ex-lap multiple loculated abscesses found and drained, JPs left in place, anastomosis no leak.
postop hct 33 --> Midnight Hct 30, INR 1.5, lytes wnl, ABGs improving - last 7.54/34/110/30/+7.
[**9-9**]-off pressors, excellent urine output, transfused 1UPRBC, continues on TPN, started on lasix gtt to augment diuresis for possible closure, vanc trough appropriate  [**2162-9-10**]-Transfused 1 unit of PRBC's with goal of keeping patient above goal of 30.
Diuresed to goal of 100cc/hour of urinary output with a CVP greater than 10 and an SBP > 100.
[**9-12**] washout Monday with closure; diuresis augmented with lasix gtt and diamox, rate increased to blow off more co2, TPN concentrated, non contrast head and chest shot, negative 3+L over 24h  [**9-13**]-Pt to OR for attempted closure.
[**9-17**]- maintained negative, R chest tube removed by thoracic surgery [**9-18**] - Continue to make 1/2L negative, follow BUN/Cr, daily CXR [**9-19**]-started vanc--goals remain similar as yesteday.
Post-line CXR - small line near left heart border, rads resident read as possible pneumomediastinum, again line on repeat CXR.
[**9-21**]: Unable to take back to OR, will go back [**9-22**] for closure of negative pressure therapy, d/c'ed versed gtt in favor of intermittent ativan with minimal requirement of usage, TF off after MN/NPO p MN for OR [**9-22**].
[**9-24**] trach'ed, picc line in place, vac changed in OR, sedation weaned, resp weaning as much as possible [**9-25**] - On [**9-25**] the patient was noted to be febrile to 103 - though with a stable blood pressure, and he was pancultured for concern with sepsis.
That day he underwent a CT abd/chest with contrast that revealed leakage of contrast to anterior abdomen from transverse colon; no biliary  dilatation or gallbladder distension.
CT C/A/P w/ small perf transverse colon to anterior abdomen, kept NPO, TPN restarted.
[**10-6**] : Continued to tolerate PS20 throughout the day and night; lasix gtt held [**1-9**] to reduced effect and rising BUN/Cr over the course of the day; speciation of sputum culture from [**10-1**] shows bactrim resistance -> tobramycin added [**10-7**] - tobra d/c'ed, increasing cr, lasix gtt d/c'ed.
The patient also underwent a gastrograffin study that revealed free flow of contrast from the rectum to the distal transverse colon with drainage into the anterior abdominal wound via colocutaneous fistula without evidence for an obstructing lesion in the left colon.
