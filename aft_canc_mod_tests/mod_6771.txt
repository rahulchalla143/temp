History of Present Illness: 77 yo left-handed woman with a history of left breast cancer, s/p lumpectomy and radiation treatment, melanoma s/p excisional surgery who was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] today after having been found to have brain mass at [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital.
She presented to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital and was found to have a mass by CT head.

Further evaluation with MR is recommended.
MRI [**2109-3-9**]:  There is no evidence of acute infarct identified.
Following gadolinium a large extra-axial area of enhancement identified in the frontal lobe with a maximum thickness of approximately 2 cm.
CT torso [**2109-3-11**]:  Small, predominantly linear areas of thrombus are seen within the right-sided central pulmonary artery as well as subsegmental branches of the right lung and left lower lobe.
Evaluation of the lungs reveals multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules measuring up to 6 mm on right along the major fissure on image #32 of series 3 and 4 mm on the left along the major fissure on image #14 of series 3.
There is a questionable, smaller 7 x 6 mm right adrenal nodule seen on image #61 of series 3.
Small,  hypoattenuating foci is seen within the liver parenchyma on images #60 and #55 of series 3.
Evaluation of the osseous structures reveals diffuse, predominantly sclerotic lesions within the femurs, pelvis, visualized portions of the spine, as well as the ribs bilaterally.
Hypoattenuating areas seen within the liver parenchyma, which are too small to characterize.
DVT studies [**2109-3-11**]: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: Given the findings of the right-sided brain mass on CT imaging of the head, the patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service for further evaluation and management.
An MRI of the head showed a lesion that most likely represented metastatic disease and less likely a malignant meningioma or hemangiopericytoma.
Intravenous steroids were continued and Therefore, a CT torso was performed to investigate a primary source, and revealed diffuse metastatic bony disease, left axillary lymphadenopathy, multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, multiple small liver lesions, and a small chronic pulmonary embolism.
Lower extremity dopplers to investiagte the pulmonary embolism were negative, and options regarding possible treatment were considered.
Of note, a likely urinary tract infection was detected on urinalysis and she had a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin.
CT perfusion showed R MCA infarct.
CT [**2109-3-17**] showed Interval increase in vasogenic edema + mass effect R frontopari region.
On [**2109-3-21**] her neurological worsened exam with fixed pupils.
