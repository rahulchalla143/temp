He initially presented to [**Hospital6 **], where he was found to have atrial fibrillation and a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with a troponin I of 0.91 and a CK of 84.
While at [**Hospital6 **] he developed recurrent symptoms and was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further care.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial vital signs were temperature 99.4, blood pressure 78/48, heart rate 119, respiratory rate 20.
Neurological exam was limited due to his sedation.
Cardiac catheterization was performed on [**2179-7-14**].
An echocardiogram was performed on [**2179-7-15**].
A repeat echocardiogram was performed later that day that confirmed left ventricular systolic dysfunction and found no significant valvular dysfunction.
He again went for cardiac catheterization on [**2179-7-15**], during which he had percutaneous intervention of the left main coronary artery, the left anterior descending, the left circumflex and a diagonal branch.
A chest x-ray was performed on [**2179-7-15**] which showed pulmonary edema and an intra-aortic balloon pump.
Another echocardiogram was performed on [**2179-7-16**], which again showed severe systolic dysfunction, with no significant valvular disease.
On [**2179-7-21**] a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a left upper lobe mass invading the left superior pulmonary vein, left iliac bone metastasis and liver lesions, likely metastases, and borderline thickening of the gallbladder.
Cardiac catheterization showed severe 3 vessel disease.
A CT of the chest and abdomen was obtained for further evaluation and demonstrated metastatic cancer.
