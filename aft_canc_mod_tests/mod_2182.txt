He present to [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital **] Hospital, where EKG was consistent with an anterior myocardial infarction.
The left heart catheterization revealed the a patent left vein coronary artery, mild irregularities of the left circumflex artery.
Right heart catheterization revealed elevated filling pressures with a right atrial pressure of 21, pulmonary artery pressure of 47/20, and mean pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure of 26.
Melanoma in his right eye, prostate cancer, status post local XRT, left-sided chest pain status post extensive cardiac workup including multiple negative stress tests.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  On admission:  The patient was afebrile, pulse 50, blood pressure 116/56, with a mean of 76.
Respirations 16.
Oxygen saturation 90% on room air and 96% on four liters.
CHEST:  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally, anteriorly.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Examination revealed regular rate and rhythm with distant S1 and S2.
EXTREMITIES: Extremities were 2+ DP pulses and no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission performed at the outside hospital revealed a white count of 10.1 with the differential of 15 neutrophils, 17% lymphocytes, 12% monocytes, and 2% eosinophils.
Hematocrit was 45.9, platelet count 291,000, PT 12.7, INR 1.07, PTT 25.2.
Chem 7 revealed sodium of 140, potassium 4.1, chloride 105, bicarbonate 25, BUN 17, creatinine 1.0, and glucose 119.
CK was 52, and troponin I was less than 0.04.
AST was 23 and ALT was 20.
Chest x-ray, by report, showed mediastinal widening, but no CHF.
Transthoracic echocardiogram by report showed no evidence of aortic dissection.
The EKG at the outside hospital showed normal sinus rhythm at 63 beats per minute with 3 mm to [**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevation in leads V2 to V5 with 1 mm to [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevation in leads V5 through V6.
There was [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in leads 1 and AVL and there was T-wave inversion in lead [**Street Address(2) 42984**] depression.
We initiated statin therapy for an LDL of 107 and HDL that was low at 29.
Low-dose beta blocker was started and titrated up as the blood pressure allowed and this was ultimately left at Atenolol 25 mg p.o.q.d.
Echocardiogram was performed that showed a moderately-depressed ejection fraction of 35% to 40%.
In addition, the BUN and creatinine should be followed, as well as the potassium.
The urinalysis was positive and grew E coli.
Sensitivities were still pending at the time of discharge, however, he was initiated on Levofloxacin for an intended course of seven days.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient's hematocrit and platelet count remained stable.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35% to 40%.
