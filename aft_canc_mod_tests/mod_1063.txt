He was worked up with Oncology and was finally diagnosed with nonHodgkin's lymphoma, after an exploratory laparotomy.
He received a computerized tomography scan which "looked great" according to the patient's doctors and the patient's daughter states, it demonstrated the cancer had diminished.
He was scheduled for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography but syncopized the day it was scheduled and never underwent the procedure.
He was transferred to [**Hospital6 **] and there was found to have a hematocrit of 29 while being severely dehydrated.
He was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and a calcium up to 13.
The patient's high calcium was persistent despite Pamidronate treatment.
Multi-infarct dementia; 2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 100.9, heartrate 102, blood pressure 146/88, sating 94% on 2 liters.
Neutropenia - On admission the patient's white count was 1.7.
The patient had a history three days earlier of white count of 6.7.
The patient had 4 neutrophils, 4 bands, 52 lymphocytes and 24 monocytes and 16% myelocytes.
His ANC was 910 on [**2105-8-28**], 2910 on [**2105-8-30**] and 8720 on [**2105-9-1**].
The patient's neutropenia was felt to be drug-related due to its rapid decline and improvement.
His urine grew out Pseudomonas greater than 100,000 colonies as well as enterococcus.
The calcium on admission was 13.0 with an albumin of 2.7.
The calcium levels dropped gradually to a low of 9.2 on [**2105-9-4**] before they began to rise again.
His hematocrit dropped from 35.9 on admission to 29.5 on [**9-1**].
The gastroenterologist saw the patient and did an upper endoscopy which showed no defects.
The patient's hematocrit bumped appropriately to 36.3.
If the patient bleeds again, the team plans a tagged red blood cell scan with IR embolization since the bleed is believed to be in the jejunum.
TIBC was 177, Vitamin B12 1676, Folate 15.1, ferritin 766, PRF 136.
The patient's hematocrit is currently stable.
Magnetic resonance imaging scan was done which was negative and demonstrated only small vessel disease, unchanged from prior studies.
Nevertheless, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30442**], the patient's oncologist believes that a lumbar puncture would not be useful considering that there are no new neurological symptoms.
Deep vein thrombosis - The patient was not prophylaxed for deep vein thrombosis secondary to his history of bleed.
He was treated with D5/W 1.8 liters times two and his sodium normalized to a level of 140.
NHL - The patient had a computerized tomography scan prior to this admission which Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30442**], the patient's oncologist related to us was not concerning for worsening NHL.
Computerized tomography scan done here demonstrated a large dependent left pleural effusion with associated pathologic atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
Hematology/Oncology Consult Team saw the patient and discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30442**] with possibility of this computerized tomography scan looking the same or different from the prior.
Pleural chemistry included total protein 3.3, glucose 195 and LDH 335.
Blood uric acid level was 10.2, LDH was 388 on [**2105-8-29**] and 810 on [**2105-8-31**].
Acute renal insufficiency - The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.8.
The creatinine on admission is 2.2, considered likely prerenal secondary to dehydration.
The patient's creatinine is back to 1.7 to 1.8 at the time of this dictation.
The patient did not seem to demonstrate rapid ventricular response, heart rate has been between 70s and low 100s.
His blood sugars were particularly high when he was receiving D5/W for his hypernatremia.
DISPOSITION:  The patient's daughter, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], pager [**Telephone/Fax (1) 34694**], home [**Telephone/Fax (1) 34695**], voice mail [**Telephone/Fax (1) 34696**] is the patient's principal healthcare proxy.
Deep vein thrombosis 6.
