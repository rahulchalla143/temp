However, upon further discussions with the family (as patient's mental status changes prevented him from understanding/expressing his decisions about medical care) the patient's family and Intensive Care Unit/Hem/Onc teams decided that given poor prognosis and clinical circumstances the patient's goals would be more consistent with signs of further leukophoresis and further workup of medical condition were discontinued and the patient received 1 mg of Morphine for discomfort.
