CT scan showed 2-cm exophytic mass in L piriform sinus.
ENT performed laryngoscopy which showed left exophytic portion of mass clearly viewed on fiberoptic exam, while right and posterior portion appreciated as obliteration of right pyriform and post-cricoid space.

CT Pelvis ...
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2155-9-1**] The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2155-9-2**] The ET tube tip is impinging the left tracheal wall and should be repositioned, currently 4.5 cm above the carina.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2155-9-3**] The patient was extubated in the meantime interval.
FDG TUMOR IMAGING (PET-CT)  [**2155-9-4**] IMPRESSION:  1.
Persistent CT contrast in renal collecting system and bladder from examination three days prior suggesting delayed clearance.
The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette C.  CXR [**2155-9-9**] Moderate right pleural effusion has increased.
This examination claims to have been performed with the patient upright.
CXR [**2155-9-9**] FINDINGS:  Single AP view of the chest was obtained with the patient in semi-upright position.
Pulmonary congestion and pleural effusion is again seen, unchanged, left greater than right.
The PICC line has been adjusted since previous imaging and now is located with the tip 2 cm above the carina.
Followup imaging of the abdomen should be pursued to further evaluate the large bowel.
Abdominal X-ray [**2155-9-10**] FINDINGS:  Single frontal image of the abdomen shows some dilated small bowel loops with air and stool in the rectum and descending colon.
CXR [**2155-9-16**] FINDINGS:  Single frontal image of the chest demonstrates bibasilar densities, unchanged since previous imaging.
IMPRESSION:  Essentially unchanged chest radiograph with persistent bibasilar opacities and left pleural effusion.
Head CT [**2155-9-16**] FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, or mass effect.
CXR [**2155-9-22**] CHEST:  Comparison is made with prior chest x-ray of [**2155-9-16**].
These appearances could be due to an extending pneumonia, but some failure may also be present.
EEG [**2155-9-22**] CONTINUOUS EEG RECORDING: Began at 21:50 on the evening of [**9-22**] and continued through 7:00 a.m. the next morning.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
LUE Extremity Ultrasound [**2155-9-22**] The internal jugular vein, axillary, subclavian, brachial, basilic veins are patent.
Examination was a little limited by the presence of the patient's arm infection/weeping.
EEG [**2155-9-23**] CONTINUOUS EEG RECORDING: Began at 7:01 on the morning of [**9-23**] and continued through 15:48 afternoon.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
CT Neck [**2155-9-24**] FINDINGS:  The previously identified infiltrative mass in the postcricoid space is smaller than the [**2155-9-1**] study measuring 2.5 x 4.4 cm.
Recommend correlation with chest CT of same date  CT Chest [**2155-9-24**] FINDINGS:  The exam is severely limited by noise and streak artifact from the patient's left arm, immobile because of humeral neck fracture.
Specifically, evaluation of the left axilla, where prominent nodes were seen on the recent ultrasound, is limited by streak artifact.
This exam is not tailored to evaluate subdiaphragmatic structures.
This and respiratory motion interfere with evaluation of the lung parenchyma, but there appears to be some edema in the upper lobes.
Recent  PET CT showed evidence of left lower lobe pneumonia.
On the current exam left lower lobe consolidation is mostly attributable to collapse rather than infection.
ECHO [**2155-9-25**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
Serial clinical and echocardiographic evaluation is recommended.
Ultrasound Left Axilla [**2155-9-25**] Exam is limited due to patient mobility due to recent fracture of the left humerus.
In comparison with prior CT chest, note is made that a comminuted fracture of the left proximal humerus is present, and calcified structures were present in the soft tissues of upper left arm possibly corresponding to the above described structures.
CT or radiograph may be helpful to distinguish.
Echo [**2155-9-26**] Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-9-25**], the findings appear similar.
CXR [**2155-9-27**] FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**9-20**], the right subclavian PICC line extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
ECHO [**2155-9-29**] The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-9-26**], no change.
Bibasilar opacities , a combination of large effusions and adjacent consolidations are unchanged.
[**2155-10-8**] 4:55 AM # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 112387**] As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no change in severity and dimension of the known bilateral apical pneumothoraces.

CXR [**2155-10-9**]:  FINDINGS:  Patient is known with head and neck cancer with bilateral pleural effusions that are longstanding, moderate on the right side and small on the left side with biapical stable minimal pneumothorax.
Biopsy was taken of mass in OR and showed squamous cell carcinoma.
PEG placed [**2155-9-12**], and tube feeds were begun.
Exam was suggestive of upper airway compromise, and there was concern for obstruction secondary to tumor mass effect although acuity of decompensation would be unusual for mass progression.
The cause of his acute decompensation remains unclear but per ENT and repeat CT imaging after intubation, pt had significant edema and swelling of his soft palate and tonsils but there was no notable change in the size of his neck mass.
Patient had an easy cuff [**Last Name (LF) 3564**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was not given [**Last Name (un) **]/oids.
Pt had a sputum on [**10-8**] that showed gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters but cultures have not shown any growth to date.
Patient underwent PET CT which revealed large FDG avid hypopharyngeal mass inseparable from esophagus and causing significant narrowing of the airway.
He received cycle 1 of TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-FU) on [**2155-9-8**].
CT of neck and chest [**9-24**] showed significant improvement in disease burden and degree of airway narrowing.
CT of the chest on [**9-24**] showed large bilateral pleural effusions significantly increased from previous imaging, as well as small pericardial effusion.
Unclear etiology of effusions, concern for malignant disease, however thoracentesis done [**2155-9-27**] which removed 1.2L showed fluid that appeared transudative.
Echo done to evaluate for decreased EF, wall motion abnormalities found pericardial effusion causing significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
Serial echos were stable.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and decision was made for pericardial window, which was performed [**2155-9-29**].
Urine electrolytes showed FENa <1% but urine Na >40 and concentrated urine.
Patient started on ciprofloxacin for UTI, urine culture grew Klebsiella sp.
CXR later became c/w PNA and given history of aspiration, he was started on unasyn [**2155-9-2**].
Pt's pleural effusion and pericardial tissue but not pericardial effusion cultures from [**2155-9-29**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16437**].
Voriconazole sensitivities are still pending.
Tip culture has remained negative to date.
Pt had a sputum on [**10-8**] that showed gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters but cultures have not shown any growth to date.
EEG ordered, showed generalized slowing consistent with encephalopathy, no seizure activity.
# Hypertensive urgency: episode of HR 30's BP 220/110 after peripheral was flushed with Neo in it, Levo stopped, and BP trended down to 180's systolic and HR stable in the 50's.
TSH was WNL.
TSH found to be elevated on repeat testing in course of workup for hyponatremia and thyroid hormone supplementation was begun.
