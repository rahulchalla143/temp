He then was found to have a hematocrit drop from 30 to 20 with small blood in the ileostomy bag.
He was returned to the outside hospital, where the night prior to admission he was found to have 700 cc of frank blood and clots in his ostomy bag.
Blood pressure was in the 70's, heart rate in the 100's.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature of 100, heart rate of 102, blood pressure 113/60, respiratory rate on SIMV with a rate of 10, sating 100%.
General: Normocephalic, atraumatic, intubated, alert, and responsive nonverbally, moving all four limbs appropriately.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 17, hematocrit of 28.6, and platelets of 60.
Sodium of 142, potassium of 4.5, chloride 105, bicarb of 30, BUN 48, creatinine 0.9, glucose 121, albumin 2.7.
INR of 1.0.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, normal intervals, normal axis, no ST-T wave changes.
CHEST X-RAY:  Showed bibasilar atelectasis and a small pleural effusion, no pneumothorax.
An arterial blood gas on admission showed 7.47/47/50 on a FIO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 5.
Hematocrit was stable at 28.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy had already been done at an outside hospital, and decision was made not to repeat the study as it was negative.
As patient's hematocrit was stable, and the ileostomy site scope was normal, further intervention was deferred.
On sputum culture, he was found to have 4+ Strep pneumoniae, and where he had been on 25 PMNs, he was started on antibiotics for this.
It was switched to azithromycin and the patient recovered well late in the hospitalization with blood pressures stabilizing off pressors and becoming afebrile with a white blood cell count decreasing from a peak in the 30's to 6.7.
He also on CT scan, was found to have a large bilateral pleural effusions.
An ultrasound was performed and there was only a small left pleural effusion which was not tapped, however, the right pleural effusion was tapped which removed 600 cc of serosanguinous transudative effusion.
He was extubated uneventfully, and was maintained well on decreasing amounts of ventilation originally on BiPAP, and then switched to a face mask, and to 2 liters nasal cannula with goal oxygen saturations in the low 90%.
He did require multiple transfusions to maintain his hematocrit above 28 in the setting of congestive obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease.
His Allopurinol was held, it was an unclear indication, probable gout.
Renal:  The patient developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 2.3, and urine sediment with multiple white blood cells.
Ceftriaxone was discontinued and as pressures were normalized, the patient's creatinine and renal function improved, and urine output improved as well.
Heart rate was well controlled.
