Past Medical History: Oncologic History: The patient was first diagnosed with MM 4 years ago, at which point he underwent VDD chemotherapy and an autologous SCT in [**2148-7-14**].
The patient continued to be resistent to the regimen and his IgG increased to 5866 in [**11-20**].
It was decided that the patient should pursue an allogenic SCT, and a donor was found who had a [**8-23**] HLA match.

EKG on admission reviewed - sinus in 90s with occac pac, no st/tw changes .
CT head [**2-28**]: No acute intracranial pathology, specifically evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
CT head [**3-12**]: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or acute major territorial infarct.
CT head [**4-1**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
CT chest [**2-18**]:There is no pneumonia or pleural effusion.
CT chest [**2-28**]: 1.
CT chest [**3-19**]: 1.
CT chest [**4-1**]: Interval development of widespread patchy consolidation throughout the lung parenchyma is suggestive of pneumonia-possibly atypical given the clinical presentation.
CT abdomen and pelvis [**4-1**]: The liver appears grossly unremarkable.
Within the limitations of a non- contrast examination, there is no focal abnormality seen.
TTE [**3-5**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-2-28**], the findings are similar.
RUQ U/S [**3-22**]: 1.
EGD [**3-29**]: Clotted blood was noted in the antrum.
Subsequent examination revelaled a 3x5cm area of erythematous, nodular and friable mucosa with superficial oozing was noted.
MRI w and w/o contrast [**2153-4-19**]: There is no evidence of acute infarction.

MICRO: - Multiple blood cultures: all negative - Multiple fungal blood cultures:  all negative or no growth to date - Multiple urine cultures: all negative - Bronchoscopy: PCP negative, viral antigen negative, no growth on cultures - CMV Viral Load: [**2153-3-29**]: 632 copies/ml.
[**2153-4-9**]: 1,090 copies/ml [**2153-4-15**]: negative [**2153-4-16**]: negative [**2153-4-20**]: negative   Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo man with multiple myeloma admitted for allogeneic stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor with Antigen A mismatch to receive Bulsulfan (dose adjusted for goal of 900) and Cytoxan for conditioning with a complicated hospital course.
His diarrhea eventually resolved and his total bilirubin, while elevated, remained stable rangin 2.8-3.1 and he was continued on low dose steroids.
These resolved and his hematocrit remained stable.
Ultrasound revealed a complete occulsion of the left internal jugular vein.
On [**3-25**], the patient was found to have a large amount of bright red blood from his rectum as well as a hematocrit drop of >6 points with a limited submaximal response to transfusion.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for EGD and aggressive blood product support with goal platelet count >50K.
EGD was done on multiple occasions and revealed large clots resting on a highly friable mucosa.
His CMV viral load returned positive and he was started on ganciclovir.
Goal platelet count >50K was maintained once the patient returned from the ICU with continued need for frequent replacement of unclear reason.
Repeat CMV VL were negative twice (separated by 5 days), however, patient was continued on treatment level dosing given LP suggestive of viral meningitis.
The differential for his ATN included cylosporine vs micafungin (started for febrile neutropenia) vs vancomycin (started for febrile neutropenia).
Cyclosporine was held starting [**2-20**] but remained theraputic for nearly a week after discontinuation and was eventually restarted as described above.
Renal service was re-consulted later in the admission when his BUN remained persistently elevated, despite dramatic improvement in creatinine back to baseline of 1.1.
His urine output remained excellent.
For reasons not clear, after bronchoscopy his oxygen saturations dropped and he was transferred back to the ICU on [**4-10**].
With these treatments, his respiratory status improved; serial CXRs showed improvement in patchy opacities.
Multiple head CTs were done and failed to show change.
While some aspects of his exam such as attention and orientation were consistent with delirium (again, related to meds, uremia, long hospitalization), neuro exam was notable for left-sided neglect and peripheral visual field cuts.
Head CT was negative for acute process and MRI, although limited study due to motion artifact, did not show acute abnormality.
A repeat MRI after transfer back to the floor again was difficult to read given motion artifact but showed no diffusion abnormality or abnormal enhancement.
Ultrasound showed moderate ascites but no bladder pathology.
