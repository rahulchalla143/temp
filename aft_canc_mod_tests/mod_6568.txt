Repeat chest x-rays have shown stable bilateral paramediastinal fibrosis.
He presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], where oxygen saturation was 83%, and he was intubated.
CTA of the chest showed no pulmonary embolism, but revealed a large density involving the majority of the left upper lobe, likely representing pulmonary hemorrhage.
Hematocrit at that time was 45.5, with a WBC count of 20.8, and the patient was started on cefepime and vancomycin.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management, where his hemoptysis continued.
Initial bronchoscopy reportedly revealed a protruding lesion with intraluminal and extraluminal component in the left lower lobe, but there is no offical report of this, and no biopsies were taken.
Rigid bronchoscopy on [**2173-10-18**] showed slow oozing of bright red blood from the apical posterior segment of the left upper lobe and an enlarged subcarinal lymph node.
Biopsy of the left upper lobe revealed scant strips of benign respiratory epithelium and fibrinous exudate and clot with acute and chronic inflammation.

You were initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring and intubated for protection of your airway.
Biopsy of an adjacent lymph node was performed which was positive for non-small cell lung cancer.
Additional imaging of your belly, spine and brain where negative for metastasis.
Our team of GI doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] underwent both an upper endoscopy which visualized the upper part of your GI tract as well as a colonoscopy which visualized your lower GI tract.
The EGD was negative and the colonoscopy illustrated rectal ulcerations.
Biopsies were obtained which were consistent with rectal irritation/inflammation.
