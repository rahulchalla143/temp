CT head was unchanged.
CXR showed old ?
retrocardiac opacity seen on CXR on [**1-22**].
EKG with new LBBB but CE negative, felt to be result of NSTEMI from prior hospitalization.
Past Medical History: SDH, bilateral wrist fractures Trach/PEG for AMS Parietal Lobe infarct incidentally found on MRI [**1-/2128**] Pineal schwannoma, s/p radiation - [**2104**] S/p VP shunt placement - [**2104**] Angioplasty [**2111**] TIA [**2125**], [**2126**] Seizure disorder   Social History: From [**Country 11150**], staying with family here.
CK: 110  MB: 2  Trop-T: <0.01 .
ALT: 327 AP: 176 Tbili: 0.3 Alb: 2.7 AST: 255 [**Doctor First Name **]: 104 Lip: 171 .
Phenytoin: 0.7 .
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-1-9**], the regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is similar.
CT chest: New tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] nodular opacities within the lower lobes bilaterally, with more confluent areas of consolidation in the lower lobes, new from the prior study.
The mildly slow and disorganized background is suggestive of a mild encephalopathy.
On the left, the current exam shows mild ulnar positive variance, which is new and could reflect some interval impaction along the fracture site.
A flexible bronchoscope was first introduced through the tracheostomy tube and advanced all the way down into the airway.
Successful coagulation and cauterization achieved with the use of argon plasma coagulation.
Patient also had thick secretions day of discharge from trach but now no e/o PNA on imaging and cx from secretions was oral flora/contaminated.
His hyponatremia appearrs to be chronic, like [**1-13**] SIADH in the setting of old pineal meningioma and radiation.
Per discharge summary from previous admission, MS exam was 'lethargic but arousable'.
MRI obtained at last hospitalization with e/o small strokes but neurology didn't feel that they were the cause of his AMS.
Repeat imaging on this admission of CT head was stable (no herniation, intracranial bleed).
Likely [**1-13**] PNA given thick secretions, rhonchi on exam and CXR with ill-defined retrocardiac opactiy unchanged from CXR seen day prior to discharge.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for cholecystitis or biliary dilitation.
Abdominal exam remained benign and RUQ ultrasound negative per above.
Patient's hematocrit was trended and active type and screen was maintained.
Cardiac enzymes negative.
On first day of admission, abnormal telemetry was noted and 12 lead EKG showed new STE in inferior leads; cardiology was called.
Given normal CE (completely flat troponins) and questionable patient description of chest pain, they recommended holding on heparinizing patient and catheterization.
Twnety minute EEG was also performed which showed mild encephalopathy, right worse than left.
Levetiracetam 500 mg/5 mL Solution [**Hospital1 **]: Five Hundred (500) mg Intravenous Q12H (every 12 hours).
