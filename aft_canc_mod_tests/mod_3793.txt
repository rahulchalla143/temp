In the ED the patient was found to be afebrile, hypoxic with an O2 sat of 84% on 100% O2, and hypotensive with a BP of 83/60 and HR 92.
An EKG was performed which revealed a right bundle branch block and there was concern for anterioseptal ST-depression.
First set of troponins came back negative.
Initial chem7 revelaed a serum potassium of 6.4 on an non-hemolyzed specimen and he received insulin, sodium bicarbonate, calcium gluconate, dextrose and kaexylate.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic  function appears depressed.
Bubble study for shunt was performed Bubble study with cough was recorded  but not at rest or with valsalva.
Additionally, clinical exam, TTE, and CXR failed to reveal significant evidence of CHF, and CT-PA was negative for PE.
Physical exam and CXR findings appeared most consistent with an exacerbation of COPD, possibly compounded by underlying cardiac disease.
# A-Fib - chronic coumadin for anticoagulation, toprol for rate control; INR 1.3 at discharge, so returned to home-dose coumadin schedule (initially altered due to INR 4.5 on admission).
Pt instructed to f/u with PCP for INR check this week.
