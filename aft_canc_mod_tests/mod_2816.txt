She was started on steroids and T8-T12 spine radiation.
Her last Velcade infusion was 3 days prior to presentation.
On the day of presentation, she went to an Onc f/u appointment and her temp was 98.6, BP 102/69, HR 101.
EKG was not concerning for ischemia, and troponin was negative.
In the ED, initial VS were: T99.4, HR 120, BP 122/74, RR 18, POx 99% 2L NC.
Labs were notable for WBC 1.6 (ANC 1163), which on repeat was WBC 0.9 (ANC 715).
Cr was 3.3 which is baseline.
Troponin 0.2 and EKG with NSR, no concern for ischemia.
CXR suggested increased small b/l pleural effusions and old sternal/rib fractures.
Bedside FAST was negative (no pericardial effusion, normokinetic heart).
He triggered for SBP 80's after 2nd L NS.
After the 3rd L NS, she improvement to SBP 110s but still intermittently dropped to SBP 80's.
VS prior to transfer were T99.8, HR 106, BP 90/55, RR 13, POx 99% 2L NC.
