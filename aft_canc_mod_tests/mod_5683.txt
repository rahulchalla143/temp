CTA chest was done which was prelim negative but did demonstrate small pericardial effusion, small right pleural effusion, bilateral ill-defined lung opacities (Aspiration, edema, hemorrhage)and prominent lymph nodes in the axilla, mediastinum, and hilum.
The pt was 105, 124/69, 20, 100%on NRB and was sent to the floor.

Radiology: CXR ([**5-14**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Chest ([**5-14**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head ([**5-14**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process .
Cardiac Cath ([**5-15**]) 1.
Moderate LV and marked RV diastolic heart failure.
TTE ([**5-16**]): The left atrium is elongated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
CARDIAC MRI ([**5-16**]) 1.
Gadolinium contrast-enhanced CMR images demonstrating areas of hyperenhancement as described above.
Urgent ECHO showed severe symmetric LVH.
Cath was performed on [**5-15**], which showed no intraventricular gradient, PCW = 21, diffuse slow flow through coronaries c/w  microvascular dysfunction but without flow-limiting lesions, dilated heart, and systemic arterial hypotension with low mixed O2 sat c/w cardiogenic shock.
A formal Echo was obtained, which showed severe, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy -  amyloidosis or Fabry's disease.
A cardiac MRI was obtained, which showed mildly depressed LVEF at 38% and a pattern of gadolinium enhancement consistent with amyloidosis.
The patient had an ICD placed on [**5-17**].
Studies were sent to investigate the cause of the hypertrophy with the SPEP results showing monoclonal IgM lambda and trace free monoclonal Bence-[**Doctor Last Name **] lambda highly suggestive of myeloma.
Syncope was thought to be [**12-28**] arrhythmia as above.
# LAD: CT Chest performed on presentation showed mediastinal and axillary lymphadenopathy.
)(s)* Refills:*2* 4. metoprolol succinate 25 mg Tablet Extended Release 24 hr Sig: Three (3) Tablet Extended Release 24 hr PO DAILY (Daily).
You were found to have an enlarged heart and a biopsy was done on [**5-17**] to diagnose the reason for the heart thickening and enlargement.
An internal cardiac defibrillator (ICD) was placed as well so that you will get an internal shock if the ventricular tachycardia returns.
Start taking aspirin 81 mg daily to thin your blood and prevent blood clots 2.
Start taking metoprolol succinate daily to slow your heart rate and help it pump better 4.
