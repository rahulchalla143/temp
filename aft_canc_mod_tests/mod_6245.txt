Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation at outside hospital RIJ placement at OSH and replacement at [**Hospital1 18**] Lumbar Puncture NGT placement GJ tube placement  History of Present Illness: A 68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3, left tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures presenting to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital [**2113-11-30**] with new onset convulsive seizures.
Potassium on admission was 2.2, with magnesium 1.7 and other electrolytes within normal limits.
WBC count 8.8 on admission.
She had no history of head trauma and CT head x 2 showed multiple old ischemic changes but no new process.
MRI was not performed.
EEG x 3 showed persistent epileptiform activity in the left cerebral hemishere, however, unclear when the EEGs were performed relative to the convulsive seizures.
Infectious evaluation was negative as below.
Per her discharge summary, her dilantin has ranged 14-19 and her last phenobarbital level was 11.4.
WBC count peaked at 20.4 [**12-2**].
Chest x-ray after intubation showed a developing infiltrate at the right lung base, which improved on subsequent imaging.
Infectious evaluation including BAL at the time of intubation, urine, and blood cultures were negative at the time of discharge - she never underwent lumbar puncture.
A RIJ was placed [**12-2**], and due to her fevers, a LIJ was attempted but unsuccessful; the RIJ remains in place.

Echocardiogram: [**2113-12-8**]: The left atrium is elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The left basilar atelectasis seen on the previous study has resolved.
MRI [**2113-12-8**]: TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images were obtained before gadolinium.
Following gadolinium, MP-RAGE coronal images were obtained with sagittal and axial reformats.
The MP-RAGE post-gadolinium images are limited by motion.
FINDINGS: Images through the brain demonstrate mild-to-moderate brain atrophy and moderate changes of small vessel disease with a chronic cortical infarct in the left parietal lobe and chronic infarct in the right basal ganglia putaminal region.
The post-gadolinium images are limited by motion as described above.
Limited gadolinium images demonstrate no large area of enhancement.
OSH EEG x 3 have shown persistent epileptiform activity from a focus in the left cerebral hemisphere, without ability for continuous EEG monitoring ??????
She had no history of head trauma and CT head x 2 showed multiple old ischemic changes but no new process.
MRI was not performed at OSH.
EEG without seizure and phenobarbital was discontinued [**12-9**].
OSH BAL from admission grew only yeast, urine and blood cultures negative.
Chest x-ray on admission here with question retrocardiac opacity but excellent gas exchange and negative sputum.
Patient was guaiac negative and with ferritin of 1159 suggesting anemia of chronic disease.
TSH 1.9, Free T4 0.56 during this acute illness.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed.
You had a lumbar puncture to rule out infection in the brain.
You had bloot test and blood cultures done.
However, you were being treated with broad expectrum antibiotics and your blood test improved and you stopped having fevers.
You had an MRI of your brain that suggested a new small stroke.
