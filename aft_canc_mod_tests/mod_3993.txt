LABORATORY DATA:  [**2117-9-13**]:  WBC 5.8, hematocrit of 44.7, platelets 200, sodium 140, 4.2, 104, 27, BUN/creatinine 13 and 1.0.
Platelets 108.
ALT 40, AST 26, alk phos 64, serum bili 0.6, PT 12.9, PTT 22.7, INR 1.1.
Chest x-ray from [**9-13**]:  Lungs clear, no infiltrate.
Also the patient had a piggyback cadaveric liver transplant, portal vein to portal vein anastomosis, common hepatic artery to hepatic artery branch patch anastomosis, bile duct to bile duct, performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 816**].

On [**2117-9-15**], ALT was 697, AST 473, alk phos 56, total bili 0.5.
On [**2117-9-20**], ALT was 298, AST 74, alk phos 206, total bili 1.2.
Of note, when cardiology was consulted, troponins were obtained and on [**2117-9-15**], troponin was 0.025 and on [**2117-9-16**], troponin was 0.02, and on [**2117-9-16**] the troponin was less than 0.01, which would rule out patient having myocardial infarction.

MMS 500 q.i.d.
Also please instruct the patient that he should call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 30335**] if any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, inability to take medications, abdominal pain, jaundice, lethargy, lower extremity edema or any problems drinking or taking any foods by mouth.
