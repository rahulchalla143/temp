EGD [**2172-2-7**]: -Esophagus: Mucosa: Erythema was seen at the GE junction consistent with esophagitis.
# Iron deficiency anema/upper GI bleeding: Patient presented with symptomatic anemia and Hct 15.1, with guiac positive stool.
Her labs were suggestive of iron defiency anemia, with iron level 9 and ferritin 2.8, likely secondary to slow upper GI bleeding in setting of known recurrent gastric cancer.
Labs were not consistent with DIC or hemolysis.
She will need Hct checked 1-2 times per week, as she is likely to have chronic slow GI bleeding.
Next Hct check [**2172-2-11**].
Iron level was 9 and ferritin 2.8.
Transitional issues: -Patient's code status was FULL code this admission -Patient will need monitoring of Hct 1-2 times per week, as she will likely continue to have slow, ongoing blood loss.
Hct was 26.0 on [**2172-2-8**] here (day of discharge).

We checked your blood counts, and your red blood cell count was very low.
We checked your iron levels, and they were also low.
These medicines may help reduce the risk of further bleeding, however it is likely that you will continue to have blood loss.
You will need to have your blood counts checked fairly frequently after you leave the hospital (1-2 times per week).
Please take the lab slip we have given you (printed on prescription paper) and go to the lab to have your blood checked on Tuesday.
