At OSH, she required 4L NC to maintain oxygen saturation in mid-90s.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, HR 88, BP 100/palp, RR 16, O2Sat 98% 4L NC.
SBP dropped to 60s during one episode of hemoptysis, and improved to low 100s after 3L IVF NS.
Laboratory data significant for hematocrit 31.3 (31.1 at last discharge), chemistry panel within normal limits, lactate 1.1.
CXR 2V with numerous pulmonary nodules not changed from prior CT; no new consolidation or effusion; right chest portacath.
CTA chest was considered given risk for pulmonary embolism, but was not completed due to contrast allergy.
Decision was made for MRA chest in ED, but was not completed.
She in received total of 3L IVF in ED with SBP in 100s prior to transfer to OR.

A right chest metaport is stable in appearance with its tip at the cavoatrial junction.
[**3-23**]: COMPARISON: Prior study obtained the same day earlier at 12:10 p.m.:  No pneumothorax is demonstrated on the current study, and the findings are most likely related to a combination of healed fractures and pleural thickening.
Overall, there is slight improvement of the right basal aeration as compared to the studies obtained on [**3-20**] and [**3-19**].

Initially transferred to MICU following rigid bronch with photodynamic therapy and blood clot extraction in OR by interventional pulmonology.
RUL mass - Large endobronchial tumor obstructing the right upper lobe takeoff and protruding into the right bronchus intermedius found during rigid bronchoscopy on [**3-12**].
- IP visualized clot and extracted it, and also performed a partial resection and coagulation of the obstructive lesion with subsequent improvement in RLL aeration - The patient was observed in the MICU for 6 days without incident, was taken back for bronchoscopy on [**3-15**] and [**3-18**] for debridement and photodynamic therapy, see operative reports for details - During the last two procedures the [**Hospital1 **] was found to be patent, but the area behind the obstructing lesion was noted to be full of purulent secretions - These secretions were aspirated by the IP team, with concern for post obstructive pneumonia - Her oxygenation improved, and she was then transferred to the floor on [**3-18**] - She will be seen by the IP team in 2 weeks for follow up bronchoscopy, no further debridement took place during her admission  # Post obstructive pneumonia - She was started on a course of IV vanc/cefepime in the MICU, no culture data available from bronchoscopy - Completed an 8 day course of therapy on [**3-23**] - Consistency and frequency of purulent secretions improved over the course of her stay on the floor with no signs of recurrent or persistent pneumonia - Supportive therapies included albuterol and ipatropium nebs, guaifensin, chest PT, and frequent ambulation - On day of discharge, the patient was sat'ing in the high 90's on 2LNC at rest, with a desaturation to the high 80's off of oxygen while ambulating - Serial CXR's showed interval improvement in the aeration of the RLL, with persistent opacification of the RUL  #.
