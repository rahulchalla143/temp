It was noted that erythema on her leg had progressed to her hip, became indurated.
BCx were sent prior to broadening of ABx.
CT torso and leg were obtained, no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis was noted (see results).
Erythema, tenderness, and induration spread to level of axilla bilaterally and to most of trunk.
During this time, patient's blood pressure decreased from 148/98 to 81/49 HR increased from 110s to 120s.
She received 3 more L of NS and started on levophed gtt, with SBPs to 100s and MAPs > 60, SvcO2 was ~ 50, thus dobutatmine was also started as per sepsis protocol.
Given the fact that patient was being transferred to the trauma/burn unit, a fascial biopsy was deferred to the treating physician's at [**Hospital1 112**], as an incision at this time would compromise already impaired skin barried and would increase risk of further infection given likely a nonsterile transfer.
