She initially returned on [**4-7**] with ongoing low grade fevers and "pustular bloody drainage" from the lower border of her sternal wound.
As her wound cultures were performed while pt was on vanco, it was uncertain if any component of her sternal wound infection was due to a gram positive organism.
Her [**4-13**] Chest CT w/o contrast showed up to a 6mm dehiscence of the upper sternum with a small, gas-containing retrosternal collection.
A wound vac placed but no further debridement was performed at that time.
She was referred to the ED by the ID physicians for chest CT and evaluation by CT surgery.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
