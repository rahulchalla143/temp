In the ED, T 104.4, HR 122, BP 168/98, RR 16, 100% RA.
His ANC was 40.
CXR negative.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: DIAGNOSIS: Acute myeloid leukemia, myelomonocytic differentiation with inversion 16.
Laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell count of 57,000 with 30% others, hematocrit of 36.1, and platelet count of 54,000.
He underwent a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and pathology demonstrated acute myelogenous leukemia with myelomonocytic differentiation that was positive for the inversion 16 mutation.
He initiated therapy with standard 7+3 including Daunorubicin at 90 mg/m2 and cytarabine 100 mg/m2.
Cycle 2 ([**Date range (1) 27630**]) was uncomplicated, as was Cycle 3 (D1 was [**2128-1-26**]).

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly to moderately depressed (LVEF=40-45%) with mild global hypokinesis (and inferior near akinesis).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-10-15**], the LVEF/RVEF have decreased (c/w toxic/metabolic process).
[**2128-3-12**] CT Chest w/o con: Widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, infection and/or pulmonary hemorrhage.
Given the appearance of the chest CT performed concurrently with the most recent prior chest radiograph, I do not believe this is pulmonary edema and favor atypical pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage instead.
# Neutropenic fever: Upon admission, CXR and UA were both negative and the patient denied any URI, GI, or meningeal symptoms.
Rapid respiratory viral screen was negative so the oseltamivir was stopped.
He continued to experience fevers to 104 and desaturation to the low 90s, so voriconazole and levofloxacin were added.
Blood cultures returned positive for Strep viridans (4/4 bottles), so antibiotics were changed to vanc/meropenem/vori.
A TTE showed depressed LVEF and RVEF compared to a prior study in [**9-/2127**], c/w a toxic/metabolic process.
Due to an increasing O2 requirement, he was transferred to the ICU for close monitoring and oxygen through face mask.
CT chest showed a widespread pulmonary infiltrate suspicious for infection or pulmonary hemorrhage, as well as some component of pulmonary edema.
C. diff returned negative and the PO vanc was then stopped.
All fungal and viral cultures returned negative and all repeat blood cultures were negative.
Troponins were initially slightly elevated, but the CK-MBs were flat and he did not have any EKG changes.
