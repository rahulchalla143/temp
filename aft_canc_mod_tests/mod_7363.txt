He was monitored in the CCU, though no pericardiocentesis was performed given its small size, and follow-up ECHO revealed improvement in the effusion.
Therapeutic/diagnostic thoracentesis performed, showing transudative fluid, although flow cytometry of the fluid showed a minute population of lymphocytes c/w his known lymphoma.
EKG was stable compared to prior.
His exam was significant for JVD, diffuse crackles, 2+ lower extremity pitting edema from calves to dorsum of feet.
Bedside ECHO showed small pericardial effusion, circumferential without tamponade physiology.
CXR was felt to demonstrate worsening pulmonary congestion and R-sided pleural effusion.
Labs were significant for lactate 1.2, trop <0.01, BNP 4251 (unclear baseline).
Given the progression  of symptoms and counts a bone marrow biopsy was performed which demonstrated a monoclonal B cell population consistent with a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.

MICROBIOLOGY: [**2120-2-8**] Blood cultures x2: NGTD .
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2120-1-31**] there is no diagnostic change.
Rate 83, QTc 442. .
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Classic echocardiographic signs of tamponade are not seen, although echo evaluation of this physiology has a reduced sensitivity in presence of significant pulmonary hypertension.
[**2120-2-10**] CXR (PA/LAT): PA and lateral chest compared to [**1-30**] through [**2-9**]: Since [**2-9**], mild pulmonary edema has cleared.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo man h/o HTN, HL, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma s/p four weekly doses of Rituxan, recent admission for pericardial/pleural effusion who presents with dyspnea; CXR demonstrating volume overload and worsening R-sided effusion, no e/o of tamponade physiology on bedside ECHO.
Respiratory Distress: Etiology likely multifactorial, including worsening pulmonary congestion (known CHF w EF 45%) and R-sided pleural effusion (see below).
On presentation, did have moderate sized pericardial effusion but no evidence of tamponade on ECHO or measured pulsus (8).
Pulsus was 8, within normal limits.
Transudative on last diagnostic tap ([**1-25**]).
Cytology of pleural fluid revealed no malignant cells.
After aggressive diuresis, repeat chest x-ray showed improvement of pleural effusion.
At the time of discharge, the patient had human anti-chimeric and anti-murine antibodies sent out for testing to evaluate for allergy to rituxan.
Blood pressure was well-controlled after increase in captopril and diuresis.
# Human anti-murine antibody and human anti-chimeric antibody were sent-out at the time of discharge.
