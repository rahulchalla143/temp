[**2118-5-4**]   CHEST (PORTABLE AP): In comparison with the study of [**5-3**], little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
LINE PLACEMENT: AP single view of the chest has been obtained.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest (patient unable to cooperate with maneuvers).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Occlusion of the right mid M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery with watershed distribution infarcts in the white matter of the right MCA territory.

Note: Immunohistochemical stains show that cells stain positive for parathyroid hormone; cells are negative for TTF-1 and thyroglobulin.
#CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT: She presented with loss of speech, left facial droop and left upper extremity weakness and was found to have an embolic [**Doctor Last Name **] to R frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes in the right MCA distribution on imaging (CTA of head and neck showed M1 occlusion).
Her LDL was 52 and HBA1C was 5.2.
Trans-thoracic echocardiogram did not show evidence of embolic phenomenon (including no ASD/PFO and LVEF>55%).
Hypercoagulable work-up (Protein S Profile; Protein C Profile; Anti-Cardiolipin Antibody; Lupus Anticoagulant; Beta 2 Microglobulin; Factor V Leiden; Antithrombin functional; Prothrombin Mutation Analysis) was unrevealing and fibrinogen level was at the high end of normal.
She was also started on simvastatin for lipid control and antihypertensives as below for blood pressure control.
#HYPERCALCEMIA [**1-19**] PARATHRYOID ADENOMA:  She was found to have a calcium of 12 with a free calcium of 1.60 on admission.
Her PTH was 424.
CTA head/neck showed a 2.8 x 1.8cm left thyroid mass.
Parathyroid scan showed persistent uptake in the in the left mid-and inferior thyroid lobe and the anterior mediastinum (substernal) concerning for parathyroid tissue.
Fine needle aspiration of the mass revealed parathyroid tissue consistent with a parathyroid adenoma.
The pathology showed left parathyroid tissue consistent with adenoma and unremarkable lymph nodes.
Her electrolytes were followed closely post-operatively and there was no evidence of hungry bone syndrome.
Her calcium and parathyroid hormone normalized.
#PLEURITIC CHEST PAIN:  She reported intermittent pleuritic chest pain during the hospitalization.
CT chest was negative for PE.
EKG was unchanged and cardiac biomarkers negative.
#UTI:  Patient was found to have UTI with urine culture growing >100,000 colonies of coag negative staph on [**5-10**].
She was given a copy of all of the studies performed during this hospitalization on a CD disk as well as the reports.
There were no cultures or studies pending at discharge.
Yaz OCP 2. antidepressant NOS (need to clarify) 3.
6. calcium carbonate 200 mg calcium (500 mg) Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO BID (2 times a day).
A hypercoagulable state (increase risk of blood clots) was also considered.
You had a cardiac echocardiogram which demonstrated no cardioembolic source.
Since high levels of calcium is dangerous for your heart and increases your rate of getting a [**Name10 (NameIs) **], your parathyroid glands were removed by surgery and you were monitored for electrolyte abnormalities which were persistently normal.
