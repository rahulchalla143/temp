Admission Date:  [**2148-12-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-12-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-9-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: s/p VT arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization s/p MiniVision LAD stent Intubation R arterial line placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 29887**] is a 52 yo male with significant PMH significant for HTN, smoking, who collapsed and hit his head at work this afternoon.
He remained in a ventricular rhythm with a rate of 20, and then converted spontaneously to sinus rhythm.
The patient was given Ativan, Versed, and Nitro and a CT of the head was done which suggested subdural hematoma vs. meningioma.
EKG showed ST elevations in 1, aVL, V2-V6.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and closer monitoring.
Hemodynamic parameters as follows: CO 6.5, CI 3.3 and PCWP 23.

Relevant Imaging: 1)Cardiac Catheterization ([**2148-12-13**]): 1.
Pulmonary artery pressure wa 41/21 mmHg with a mean of 30 mmHg.
Cardiac index was perserved at 3.25 l/min/m2.
2)C,T,L-spine CT ([**2148-12-14**]): no evidence of fracture or malalignment.
The density values of the brain parenchyma are within normal limits and the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.
4)MRI/MRA Head ([**2148-12-16**]): Study is limited due to patient motion artifact.
2)Pump: The patient had an ECHO 2 days after PCI and VF arrest which showed an EF~ 30% with an akinetic apex.
Although the PCWP 23 on cardiac cath, the patient was diuresed during his hospitalization and was euvolemic on exam by time of discharge.
Given the akinetic apex found on echo and increased risk of clot formation, the patient was started on a heparin drip as a bridge to coumadin.
He was told to have his INR checked on Friday and have the results faxed to Dr.[**Name (NI) 5907**] office.
Head CT head showed a 5-mm hyperdense focus along anterior falx.
Neurosurgery was involved throughout and recommended follow-up in [**5-1**] weeks with an outpatient CT and appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
CT of the C- T- and L-spine ruled out fracture.
6)Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis was attributed to the recent STEMI.
UA and CXR were negative for UTI and PNA respectively.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check PT, PTT, INR please call in results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 5909**] fax ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 29889**].
Please have your coumadin level checked this Friday at his office.
