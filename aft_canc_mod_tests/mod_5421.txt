Colonoscopy showed large grade 3 internal hemorrhoids as the likely source of her bleed, also polyps in the ascending colon that were not removed as they were small and INR was 1.5.
At time of transfer to the floor, the patient had no new complaints: no abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills or any other concerns.
Her last blood BM was the previous day and her BM's on the day of transfer were normal.
On CTA of the patient's abdomen the week prior to admission, the liver showed some hepatic congestion most likely secondary to her right heart failure.
The general surgeons were concerned with this finding and requested a RUQ ultrasound to rule out hepatic pathology.
The RUQ US only showed a questionable septated fluid collection around the gallbladder which was found to be ascites fluid on a repeat abdominal CT scan.
