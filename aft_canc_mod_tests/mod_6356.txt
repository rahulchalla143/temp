Pathology [**2175-10-12**] Ilium/pelvis, right, biopsy: Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma present.
Marked right upper thoracic anterior chest wall uptake does not have an obvious CT correlate, though early rib/chest wall metastasis is a diagnostic consideration.
Difficult to exclude a skull metastasis in the setting of mild focal uptake.
[**2175-10-9**] CT pelvis: 1.
Diverticulosis [**2175-10-9**] CT chest: 1.
The patient presents with constipation and was found to have a Ca of 19.8.
PTH was normal at 21.
Vit D 25 OH was low at 10.
Initially patient was unable to take in adequate POs, secondary to her mucositis, to meet her fluid requirement and her Ca levels were difficult to control.
# Squamous cell carcinoma: Chest and pelvic CT was performed which was concerning for pulmonary nodules, extensive lymphadenopathy, and lytic lesions in the pelvis all concerning for metastatic malignancy.
A bone scan was performed which showed diffuse lytic lesions in pelvis, chest wall, femur, and possibly skull.
A bone biopsy was scheduled that showed squamous cell carcinoma in the iliac.
However, in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] her SBP rose to 200.
She appeared dry initially on exam and given her extreme hypercalcemia likely has prerenal ARF vs ATN from volume depletion.

Nevertheless, she was given significant amounts of IVF's and her kidney function returned to [**Location 213**] prior to discharge.
# Right posterior hip pain: The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Hip x-ray was negative, but CT showed lytic lesions in bone which may be the cause of her hip pain.

Her hematocrit slowly trended downward, without any evidence of hemolysis.

Please check CBC twice weekly.
