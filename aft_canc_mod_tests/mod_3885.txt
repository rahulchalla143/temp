Brief Hospital Course: Initially, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was hypotensive with SBP to 70 and tachycardic to 150s.
CXR, blood, and urine cultures were negative.
She was afebrile, but WBC count was still elevated, so she was continued on levofloxacin and flagyl.
A duplex ultrasound of the liver was performed on two occasions which failed to reveal clot.
* Eventually, her WBC count trended down so the antibiotics were stopped.
Her Hct remained stable and she was taking good PO's, so the IV protonix was changed to Nexium PO (her outpatient PPI).
