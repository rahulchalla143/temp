A preoperative evaluation showed no critical coronary disease and preserved ventricular function.
In the ED, he was found to be in DKA with a gap of 18.
His WBCs were 20 on CBC with a HCT of 30 (last HCT 33 on [**1-20**]).
CXR was unchanged from prior on [**1-20**].
A renal ultrasound was done and showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Renal transplant and CT [**Doctor First Name **] saw the pt in the ED.

[**2112-1-27**] ECHO Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-12-15**], no change.
His UA was also positive, though urine culture was negative.
Surveillance blood cultures cleared following initiation of anti-biotics.
The trigger for his DKA was thought to be his infection along with his non-compliance with insulin during the days prior to admission.
His blood sugars came under better control with this regimen.
Creatinine peaked at 3.2 and improved with fluid.
Pt is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of CT [**Doctor First Name **].
CK 258, CK-MB 3.
EKG unchanged.
BPH - Urinary Retention--post void residual of 215cc on discharge; pt refused foley & intermittant straight catheterization.
Osteoarthritis 10.
You will be taking NPH at home along with a humalog sliding scale and keep track of your blood sugar levels.
You should have your Sirolimus level checked along with a CBC (your platelet count has been elevated and should be followed up).
