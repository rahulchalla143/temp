IMAGING: CT Head ([**9-15**]): 1.
CT Sinus ([**9-24**]): 1.
The left ostiomeatal complex, and bilateral fronto-and spheno-ethmoidal recesses appear occluded.
These findings should be closely correlated with detailed oral examination (as performed by the Dental service).
CXR on admit:  Right perihilar consolidation, likely pneumonia.

The femoral line was d/c'ed and sent for culture which was negative.
C. diff cultures were negative X1.
Patient had a CT scan of the sinuses which showed extensive sinusitis as well as possible dental abscesses.
Her blood pressure was well controlled on these agents throughout her hospital stay.
