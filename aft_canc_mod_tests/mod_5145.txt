In the ED, VS Tmax 101.8, HR 111, BP 146/78, RR 16, 97%RA.
Laboratories significant for lactate 5.9, WBC 11.9.
The patient's temperature decreased and her lactate decreased to 3.5.
Chest CT was obtained to further evaluate possible infectious etiolgies and incidentally noted large bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Given altered mental status, head CT obtained, which is unchanged from prior.
The patient was initially noted to have SBP 80-90s but blood pressure improved with fluid boluses.
Biopsy was consistent with melanoma.
Her followup CT showed liver metastasis.
Her followup CT scan showed interval increase in size of the right liver mass as well as interval increase in size of multiple renal lesions and a new peritoneal or omental nodularity consistent with metastatic disease.
She subsequently underwent a staging MRI of the brain prior to initiation of the new treatment protocol.
The MRI on [**2134-6-6**] revealed a small focal areas of metastatic involvement in both temporal lobes and possibly in the left mamillary body.
Followup MRI revealed progression of one of her brain lesions.
A CT scan on [**2134-8-9**] showed a massive increase in the metastatic disease burden with metastasis to the liver, pancreas, and subcutaneous tissues and massive increase in the amount of intra-abdominal, intrapelvic lymphadenopathy as well as omental nodularity.

Echocardiogram showed no evidence of right heart strain as above.
The patient had a lumbar puncture performed to rule out recurrent leptomeningeal disease.
Cytology was preliminarily negative but the formal [**Location (un) 1131**] was pending on discharge.
CSF cultures remain negative at the time of discharge.
She has complaints of generalized weakness over the past several days, which per her sister, is a marked change.
While there is no definite finding on exam, it is unclear if these findings could be related to her cancer, the treatment, or metabolic derangements.
Lumbar puncture was performed to rule out leptomeningeal disease and the preliminary cytology was negative.
The patient's mask-like facies and shuffling gait were believed to be secondary to Parkinson's disease.
The patient's cell counts remained stable throughout hospitalization.
The patient's blood cultures were negative at the time of discharge.
Lumbar puncture was performed as above and cultures were negative at the time of discharge.
