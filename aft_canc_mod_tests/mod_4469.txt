Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably normal (LVEF>55%) (not fully assessed).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-10-28**], the severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced on the current study.
[**12-16**] ECHO (pre-procedure):The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**12-16**] ECHO (post procedure): .
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the pre-procedure intracardiac echo study of [**2196-12-16**], the transmitral gradient has decreased significantly, while severity of mitral regurgitation has slightly increased.
[**12-16**] Cardiac Cath:Percutaneous Balloon Valvuloplasty: was performed on the mitral valve by a transseptal approach with a maximum balloon diameter of 27 mm.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by a member of the nursing staff.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-12-16**], LV systolic function is not as vigorous today.
[**12-18**]: CXR Findings concerning for bibasal consolidations worrisome for infectious process.
Part of the consolidation might be due to superimposed interstitial pulmonary edema and reevaluation of the patient after diuresis is recommended.
Post-valvuloplasty ECHO showed mild rheumatic MS, moderate regurgitation.
Given his persistent atrial clot, his warfarin dose was increased and he will be discharged on this increased dose with a goal INR of 2.5-3.5.
He has cardiology f/u scheduled and should receive a repeat ECHO in 6 weeks.
He will need monitoring at an [**Hospital3 **] and will receive repeat INR 2 days after discharge.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: After valvuloplasty, his rate was poorly controlled with HR in the 100s.
He was treated with heparin bridge until therapeutic on warfarin, which was increased to 5 mg/day during the hospitalizaton for goal INR of 2.5-3.5.
INR was 2.5 on discharge.
Pt should f/u with INR check 2 days post discharge ([**12-23**]).
# PUMP: Admission ECHO showed normal EF of 50%.
Repeat ECHO showed EF of 35% after procedure, however there was some concern that this may be rate-related and not representative of his true EF.
ECG and cardiac enzymes were drawn at this time out of concern for possible ischemic event that may have caused worsening EF, however were not concerning for acute event.
Cdiff was negative, blood cxs negative x 2.
While there was concern for aspiration given his new pneumonia and trivial aspiration on video-assisted swallow, speech and swallow felt that this could be improved with teaching the patient proper swallowing techniques and recommended no dietary changes given his poor nutritional status.
# Anemia: Pts crit dropped during this admission from 31.9 to 23.2.
Guiac stools were negative, CT abd was checked out of concern for retroperitoneal bleed s/p cath, however no clear source of bleed was found.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: 2.5 Tablets PO DAILY (Daily).
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR, CHEM 7, CBC on Friday [**12-21**] 8.
You continue to have a blood clot in your left atrium and so your INR should remain between 2.5 and 3 until the clot resolves.
You will also need a repeat ECHO in 6 wks as the last echo done during this hospitalization showed that there may have been a decrease in your hearts pumping function.
This finding may, however, be a result of a fast heart rate during the exam as so, as above, should be repeated in 6 weeks.
