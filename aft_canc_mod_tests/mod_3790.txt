An abdominal CT scan performed in the ED incidentally noted a large pericardial effusion.
He was noted on exam to have elevated neck veins, tachycardia, and significant pulsus paradoxus.
Follow-up echocardiogram demonstrated EF >55%, with 1.5-2.2cm circumferential pericardial effusion with extesive stranding and likely loculation, and RV diastolic collapse.
Past Medical History: HIV diagnosed 1 year ago (patient requested blood test after former partner found to have gonorrhea; STD screen negative at the time, but found to have seroconverted).
