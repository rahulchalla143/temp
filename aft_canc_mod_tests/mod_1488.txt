He was transferred immediately to the Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation, and after a thorough work-up which included CT scan of the head which showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, it was felt that this was most likely secondary to cyclosporin toxicity along with the narcotics that the patient had been receiving.
The patient's renal status remained steady, and his creatinine remained around its baseline of 1.0, although while in the Intensive Care Unit, in the second week postoperatively, he did develop acute renal failure which was felt to be secondary to drug toxicity and intravascular volume depletion.
Prior to discharge,    his PT and INR had normalized.
The patient's wound    grew out E. coli.
His cyclosporin levels had been stabilized on a dose of 150 mg of cyclosporin [**Hospital1 **], along with CellCept 1 gram po bid, and 15 mg of prednisone once daily.
