Name: [**Known lastname 10283**], [**Known firstname **]         Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 10284**]  Admission Date:  [**2169-5-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2169-5-18**]  Date of Birth: [**2116-12-13**]       Sex: m  Service:  ADDENDUM:  The patient was going to continue having a further oncologic workup for his malignancy which would include a bone scan and a magnetic resonance imaging of the head.
The patient had the bone scan performed on [**2169-5-18**].
The magnetic resonance imaging of the head was attempted twice; however, due to the patient's Tourette syndrome, he was moving too much in the magnetic resonance imaging machine to get worthwhile images.
The option of intubating him in order to get the magnetic resonance imaging was discussed with the patient and his family; however, they felt this was not something which he would have wanted, so no magnetic resonance imaging will be done, and Oncology is aware of that.
He should restart his Coumadin when his INR is at 2 to 3, and it will be restarted at 2.5 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
