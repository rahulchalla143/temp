[**Last Name (STitle) **].
Lung, left lower lobe and chest wall: Squamous cell carcinoma, see synoptic report.
New margin, lateral chest wall: Skeletal muscle, no carcinoma seen.
Gross: Specimen submitted:   1.  central back soft tissue, lipoma,  2.  lateral chest wall margins,  3.  new lateral chest wall margins,  4.  left lower lobe and chest wall,  5.
The specimen is submitted in cassettes A-C.   Part 2 is additionally labeled "lateral chest wall margin" and consists of a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm fragment of soft tissue, which is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis.
Part 3 is additionally labeled "new lateral chest wall margin" and consists of a 2 x 2 x 1.5 cm portion of soft tissue, with a stitch indicating the new margin.
Frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is as follows:  "new lateral chest wall margin, negative for carcinoma."
The portion of the upper lobe measures 6 x 3 x 2 cm, the lower lobe measures 12 x 7 x 6 cm, the chest wall measures 14 x 9.5 x 2 cm.
The mass does not appear to involve the chest wall between ribs 4 and 5, however between ribs 5 and 6 it extends between the bones to the soft tissue.
H=vascular margin, I=stapled upper lobe margin, with adjacent nodule, J=hilar lymph nodes, K=soft tissue margin between ribs 5 and 6, L=soft tissue margin between 6 and 7, M=soft tissue margin between 6 and 7, N=soft tissue margin internal to rib 6, posteriorly on the pleural surface, O=tumor in relationship to normal lung and pleura, P=tumor with necrosis with relationship to vessels.
[**8-31**]: Patient had speech and swallow evaluation for c/o hoarseness.see report for detail.
