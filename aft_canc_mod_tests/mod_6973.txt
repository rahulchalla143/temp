While there he had a CT of his head, which showed a new 4x4 cm cystic lesion in the R parietal lobe.
He was given 10mg of Decadron, and arrangements were made to transfer him to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible surgical evaluation.
Inattentive, unable to name days of the week backwards.
On Discharge: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx   Pertinent Results: CT Head [**2126-11-19**]: IMPRESSION: Large cystic lesion centered within the right parietal lobe with surrounding edema and minimal shift of normally midline structures towards the left.
MRI Brain [**2126-11-19**]: IMPRESSION: Large right temporal lobe mass with solid and cystic components and moderate mass effect.
Head CT [**2126-11-20**] (Post-op): Expected post-operative changes, immediately status post right temporoparietal craniotomy and resection of intra-axial mass.
Torso CT [**2126-11-20**]: 1.
MRI Brain [**2126-11-22**] (Post-op): IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes with blood products at the surgical cavity.
Residual rim enhancement is seen at the anterior and medial margin of the surgical cavity.
He had post op MRI which showed stable post-op changes with some improvement to midline shift and mass effect.
A speech and swallow eval was done on [**11-21**] and [**11-22**] and soft/pureeds and thin liquids with supervision were recommended.
You will not need an MRI at that time.
You will also follow-up in 3 months with a MRI brain with and without contrast.
