CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Small amount of pericardial fluid is again seen.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: A tunneled dual chamber large bore dialysis catheter enters the right internal jugular vein and terminates in the right atrium.
IMPRESSION: Suspected stenosis of the right brachiocephalic vein immediately superior to the left brachiocephalic confluence, due to the indwelling catheter, less likely tumor compression as the SVC itself distends normally.
CXR [**7-4**]: There is no change in the known right upper lobe consolidation and atelectasis.
Most recent treatment with VP etoposide cycle 14 [**2141-6-23**] and Neulasta [**2141-6-24**].
CT venogram was initially concerning for extrensic compression of the SVC by her tumor but thrombus around the dialysis catheter could not be ruled.
To evaluate her blood vessels and the dialysis catheter, IR performed a venogram which showed no significant abnormalities, no stensosis, no thrombus and no extrensic compression.
CTA was neg for PE.
Review of her CT indicated that she had severe right upper lobe and lower lobe collapse secondary to bronchus compression.
