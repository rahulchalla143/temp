Per report, a chest xray at [**Hospital1 **] showed COPD, a left lower lobe infiltrate, and no evidence of CHF.
BNP was 1510.
He was given Lasix for diuresis and had an echo that showed his EF had decreased from 40 to 20%.
He has known renal insufficiency and his creatinine stabilized at the OSH at 1.7.

NECK: Supple with JVP of 10cm.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2117-7-2**] atrial tachy-arrhythmia is new with previous tracing showing sinus rhythm.
[**2123-9-23**] Transthoracic Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 10 %.
Prolonged presence of IV contrast in the right-sided circulation, resulting in suboptimal evaluation of CTA abdomen in the arterial phase.
CT head [**9-27**]: 1.
TEE [**9-28**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
MR/MRA head [**9-28**]: 1.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 20%with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, newly diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with lower extremity peripheral edema and oozing.
He was found to have significant evidence of volume overload on physical exam with a very elevated JVP and 4+ pitting edema to the level of the abdomen.
He had a transthoracic echo which showed biventricular systolic dysfunction and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%.
Imaging was not supportive of mesenteric ischemia or pulmonary embolism.
CT head, MRI head showed no evidence of a acute bleed.
Neurology was consulted and an EEG was performed.
Based on imaging and EEG, neurology felt that there was a poor but "not dismal" chance of neurologic recovery.
At 8:05 on [**10-2**] the patient spontaneously went asystolic, a thorough death confirmation exam was performed and the patient was declared deceased.
