CT Abdomen: 1) Thickening in left colon seen from the splenic flexure through the rectosigmoid.
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Again seen is a stent overlying the superior mediastinum.
Brief Hospital Course: Regarding her seizures/ HA, the patient was worked up for CNS infection vs mets(though outside head CT neg) vs stroke.
An MRI was obtained and showed multiple T2 hyperintensities in the parietal occipital region including involvement of the corpus callosum without enhancement or slow diffusion.
Intially it was though that the patient had a stroke given L sided weakness, but later in her course her neurological exam was normal and completely without deficits.
A lumbar puncture was negative, except elevated protein, about 400 RBCs.
She was continued on acyclovir for a question of HSV until her HSV PCR results returned and showed no evidence of HSV.
An EEG on [**6-26**] was abnormal but at that time the patient was on propofol.
It was decided that the level would be drawn again and followed up by her outpatient neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10653**].
The patient's EKG showed PR depressions diffusely consistent with myopericarditis of unknown etiology.
An echo down after the procedure showed EF 20% and diffuse severe akinesis with preservation of 2 cm of basal wall motion.
A new cardiomyopathy work up with TSH, Fe Studies, and viral cultures was negative.
Her CK was > [**2191**] which would be consistent with a seizure and was about 1000 at discharge.
An LP was nonrevealing and a UA was negative.
At discharge, her white count was at baseline in the low 20's.
A CXR showed mild vascular congestion  but her clinical exam showed no evidence of heart failure.
The abdominal CT was unrevealing.
The white count may be accounted for by splenectomy.
Her sugars were managed initially with Q 2 H fingersticks and Insulin sliding scale.
