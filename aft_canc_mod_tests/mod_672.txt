of note, his recent medical history is as follows: He had undergone catheterization in [**2115-5-5**], with two drug-eluting stents placed.
He had a chest x-ray done as per his primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 6**] abnormality was detected in the left upper lobe and a CT of the chest was done on [**2116-1-3**].
