Serial slices show that the tumor does appear to invade the muscularis propria and mesentery and is 1.5 cm deep.
The specimen is represented as follows:  A = the polyp which has been shaved from the mucosal surface, B-E = representative sections of tumor (full thickness), with B and D containing the deepest point of invasion, F = diverticula located 15 cm from the splenic flexure surgical margin, G = two additional representative diverticula, H = unremarkable bowel wall, I = possible lymph nodes at the inferior mesenteric pedicle, J = surgical margin at the splenic flexure, K = surgical margin at the rectosigmoid, L-T = lymph nodes.

However, oral contrast has not yet progressed to the colon, limiting evaluation.
If further evaluation is required, a delayed study of the pelvis only could be performed.

His Coumadin was held given concerns for GI bleeding, INR 1.4 on admission.
His rate was well controlled throughout admission and he was monitored on telemetry.
His ACE-i and metoprolol were held given GI bleed.
His levels were closely monitored throughout admission, and were repleted as necessary.

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ________________________________________________________________ Mr. [**Known lastname 88840**] care was transferred to the Acute Care team on [**2148-6-21**] when he was taken urgently to the OR for left hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis; biopsies were obtained of the mass in his sigmoid.
A CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis was done and no leak was identified.
Following the 3rd trigger event there was concern again for anastomosis leak and he underwent CT imaging of his abdomen which did not show any leaking; it did however show a possible stricture at the anastomosis.
A KUB with contrast was ordered to determine if the contrast went all the way through this area results revealed some passage of contrast and dilated loops of bowel representative of an ileus.
On [**6-30**] he was noted with a PLT drop down to 53 - his admission plts were 123.
His subcutaneous Heparin was stopped and a HIT panel was sent which came back positive.
The Argatroban drip was eventually stopped and he was given 5mg Coumadin; initial dose on [**7-4**] for several doses, his INR was 1.5 on [**7-8**].
Goal INR [**1-18**].
He was noted with hematuria on [**7-6**] requiring that a Foley be replaced for irrigation and monitoring purposes - this did resolve; his hematocrit remained stable with 30 being the last value on [**7-8**].
His hypotensive episodes did resolve and there were no more trigger events.
Cardiology was re-consulted and recommended Lasix 40 mg every other day; they further noted that his albumin was likely contributing to his edema as well.
The necessary CT scans were already done prior as part of his workup and it was requested to send a CEA as baseline.
