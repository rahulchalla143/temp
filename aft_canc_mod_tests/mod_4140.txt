CT Head [**2133-9-28**] Reason: BLOWN RT PUPIL, ?
PROCEDURE: CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast CT of the head was performed.
CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is global hypodensity of the brain parenchyma with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation, as well as diffuse effacement of the sulci and basilar CSF spaces.
There is no shift of the normally midline structures, or CT evidence of brain herniation.
Pt had borderline acceptable oxygenation and ventilation and required high levels of PEEP and FIO2 to maintain O2 sats.
He was noted to have a blown pupil and CT Head was done which showed diffuse brain edema, poor [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation, and new stroke.
RUQ ultrasound with Dopplers performed which excluded vascular causes of FHF.
Did not continue to bleed, so no EGD was done.
#  HIV - HAART held, as some meds may have contributed to hepatotoxicity.
Plan was for further workup by ENT, but this did not happen before death.
#  Acute renal failure - Pt with Cr 0.5 at OSH, presented to [**Hospital1 18**] at 1.3 here.
