Brief Hospital Course: MICU Course Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted to the MICU with a hemoperitoneum seen on CT scan on [**2121-10-4**].
He underwent embolization of the L hepatic artery at the bifurcation on [**2121-10-5**].
His retic count was 1.5 and coags were stable.
His hematocrit was checked every 4-6 hours for the next 48 hours and was stable.
A repeat CT scan was obtained on [**10-8**] to evaluate concern for rebleeding with a slight drop in HCT associated with abdominal pain and low SBPs 80s overnight.
CT did not show any further bleeding but did show a focal area of transmural inflammation on the hepatic flexure concerning for ischemia or infection.
We discussed the findings on CT with radiology who recommended repeating the scan the following day.
Repeat CT scan with mesenteric angiography was relatively unchanged from prior.
He was started on vancomycin as below for enterococcus blood cultures but did not have any other signs or symptoms of infection during the remainder of his hospital course with no fever and no elevated WBC.
Since his pain was mildly improved and the CT was not any worse compared with prior, we advanced his diet which he tolerated well and discontinued his antibiotics at discharge.
HCT was stable at time of discharge and repeat CTs did not show further bleeding.
# Enterococcus, MSSA, Corynebacterium blood cultures: Pt had positive blood cultures on [**10-8**] with multiple bugs.
He was empirically started on Vanc for GPC in blood cultures but this was discontinued at time of discharge since repeat blood cultures were all no growth and he did not have fever, elevated WBC, or localizing signs to suggest infection.
It was felt that positive blood cultures were most likely from contamination but he was instructed to return if he developed fever or worsening abdmonial pain.

An embolization was performed to stop the bleeding which was successful.
Since you had continued abdominal pain, we obtained a repeat CT scan of your abdomen which showed some inflammation around an area of your colon.
