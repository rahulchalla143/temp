Metastatic lesion is noted at the transverse process of T9 on the right and bone marrow infiltration with expansion at the T10 vertebral body on the right, causing right-sided neural foraminal narrowing.
ECG [**2151-9-16**]  9:13:30 AM Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-9-13**] the rate is faster, ventricular ectopy is absent and low limb lead QRS voltage is now seen.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-9-13**] multifocal atrial tachycardia is new and the ventricular rate has increased from approximately 75 to approximatley 115.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-9-17**] the rhythm appears to be more consistent with an atrial tachycardia rather than multfifocal atrial tachycardia.

ECG [**2151-9-18**]  9:45:50 PM Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate 116.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-9-17**] the cardiac rhythm is now irregular and consistent with atrial fibrillation.

Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
CXR [**2151-9-21**] FINDINGS: Interpretation of the study is limited due to motion artifacts.
In the recovery room, he had some tachycardia and cardiac enzymes were negative.
Post procedure Hct was stable at 29-30.
His HR was still elevated to 120s-140s.amiodarone therapy initiated, with 150 mg IV bolus and then 1 mg/min for 6 hours, then 0.5 mg/min for 18 hours.
Serial chest X-rays were satisfactory.
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution Sig: Four (4) mg Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for nausea.
