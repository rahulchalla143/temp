The patient was admitted to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab [**2166-3-31**] following an admission to [**Hospital1 882**] for left leg hematoma with INR 19 s/p fasciotomy [**2166-2-22**] which was c/b DVT in hematoma for which she was restarted on coumadin and underwent repeat surgery [**2166-3-24**].
Since discharge she had been doing well until this morning when noted to have 200cc bright red emesis with blood clots.
In the ED, she dropped her sat sto 84%, was put on high flow O2.
If her GIB does not resolve quickly, she wishes to have comfort the main goal of care, including discontinuation of HD and blood products.

There are no air bubbles in the collection or other specific CT signs to suggest superinfection though this cannot be excluded.

The patient had no repeat episodes of hematemsis throughout the hospital course and her Hct was stable.
The patient received a total of 2U of PRBCs ([**4-7**] and [**4-12**]) during her hospital course.
Subsequent imaging revealed evidence for volume overload and pulmonary edema.
After multiple days of qd hemodialysis, the patient's peripheral O2 saturation began to improve as did her blood gases.
Repeat chest film demonstrated persist pulmonary vascular congestion but no new infiltrates or consolidation.
ID - The patient was found to have + blood cultures from [**2166-4-10**], 4/4 bottles growing E. Coli.
Initial sensitivities revealed this was sensitive to Zosyn for which treatment was initiated.
Subsequent sensitivites revealed however only partial sensitivity to Zosyn for which Abx therapy was tailored to ceftriaxone, dosed with HD.
It was initially suspected in the ICU that this was a line related infection for which the patient's dialysis line was pulled on [**2166-4-11**] although tip culture never grew any bacteria.
Of note the patient had negative blood cultures on admission.
The patient subsequently had complete ID workup including repeat blood,urine, and sputum cultures.
The patient rapidly cleared her cultures with treatment and all surveillance cultures subsequently have been negative.
Urine cultures were unrevealing.
However, sputum cultures revealed moderate growth E. Coli which was thought more likely to represent colonizer than respiratory pathogen.
On admission the patient had a white count of 32.2 with peak at 50 on [**2166-4-20**].
The patient's elevated white count was initially attributed to her known MDS on admission although on discharge from most recent hospitalization on [**2166-1-10**] the patient had a white count of only 14.3.
Review of records from [**Hospital1 882**] revealed that hematoma aspiration cultures from the patient's second intervention on [**2166-3-24**] demonstrated negative gram stain and no growth on cultures.
A repeat CT of the LLE was performed that demonstrated two hematomas in the medial and anterior thigh, but imaging demonstrated no gas or destructive changes to suggest an active infectious process.
The patient's white count is currently slowly trending downward, most recently 28.5 from peak of 50, likely representing response to therapy with regards to C. Diff infection.
The patient's rate control medications were up titrated and she has now been continued throughout her course on Diltiazem 60mg qid as well as metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid with imperfect rate control with heart rate ranging 100-115.
The patient was maintained on a Heparin gtt with goal PTT of 60 throughout her hospital course.
Since placement of tunneled hemodialysis catheter, the patient has begun transition back to coumadin and should continue of Heparin gtt with gaol PTT 50-70 until a therapeutic INR is achieved.
The patient was given small boluses as needed and efforts were maintained to control heart rate as above.
As surveillance cultures had remained negative > 48 hours and the patient remained afebrile, her hemodialysis catheter was replaced on [**2166-4-24**].
Left Leg Hematoma - The patient was admitted with known prior left thigh hematoma s/p fasciotomy and evacuation at [**Hospital1 882**].
Inital hematoma occured in the setting of INR of 18.
However, on discharge from last hospitalization in [**2165-12-25**] the patient had a white count of 13K.
Heme pathology was asked to prepare a peripheral blood smear for review.
It was felt that there was no significant left shift or toxic granulations to suggest infection and that the elevated white count may be consistent with her underlying MPD, although the possibility that an uderlying infection could have caused demargination could not be ruled out.
As above, the patient's white count has most recently started to trend downward from peak value of 50 to most recently 28.5. .
Hypotension - Please note on transfer that patient at baseline has had persistent baseline hypotension with SBP rangin 80-100.
The patient remains afebrile, with all surveillance cultures negative and slowly resolving white count.
