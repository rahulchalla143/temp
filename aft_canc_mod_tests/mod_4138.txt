Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-10-20**],  no change.
HEAD CT AT PRESENTATION [**3-17**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Comparison with [**2186-10-20**] CT scan and [**2186-10-21**] MRI.
MRI: This study is compared with similar examination performed on [**2186-10-21**].
TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT scan.
[**3-19**] CTA: TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT was first performed and then, a CTA was performed with IV contrast.
Correlation is obtained with the prior MRI of [**2187-3-18**].
The non-contrast head CT [**Year (4 digits) 4059**] multiple hypodensities within the territory of the right middle cerebral artery territory brain cortex, consistent with early subacute infarcts.
EKG AT PRESENTATION" Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2186-10-25**] the rate has increased.

She was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where temp was 104.8 and SBP was in the 80s - it transiently increased with IVF then required many boluses IVF; patient was treated with vanco and flagyl, 4L IVF, LP was negative with neg cx (though no OP recorded, and only 4cc fluid sent) and she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]/[**Hospital Ward Name 516**] for further workup of what was thought at the time to be sepsis.
Initial head ct had been negative for new changes or infarcts but showed stable size of meningioma.
Further workup of septic source for fever/hypotension was negative, including negative blood cultures, negative TTE, and negative chest xray/UA.
CT of the brain had suggested bilateral watershed infarcts; MRI was consistent with this finding, though images reviewed by the stroke consult team suggested right watershed infarcts and tight  RCA, with ?L embolic infarct.
Blood pressure has been stable for  24 hours, and she is ready for transfer to the neurology service.
Sepsis workup was negative, including cx and TTE, and imaging was found to have R>L infarcts on head ct thought watershed from low  bp, versus embolic on one side.
She had imaging with L ICA occlusion/severe stenosis that was not present on MRI in [**2185**].
She was initially started on Aggrenox and switched to Plavix; she is now on plavix, aspirin, a statin, and on an ACE-I as her BP is more stable with stress-dose steroids.
She was continued on continue current meds from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]; lytes and dilantin level were monitored and were within goal range (dilantin level 16.4 on [**3-23**]), stroke workup was completed including Hba1c of 5.9, FLP pending.
