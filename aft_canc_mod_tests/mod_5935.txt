Imaging: Unilateral Rib with AP Chest ([**2195-12-21**]): There is a remote healed rib fracture of the lateral left tenth rib.
CT sinus ([**2195-12-8**]): There are innumerable lytic lesions in the imaged bones, which have increased in number and size since the previous studies.
CT spine: 1.
CT is not sensitive for intrathecal details.
If there is concern for radiculopathy, MRI is more sensitive for assessment of acute component of fractures or marrow edema.
MRI spine: 1.
Compression fracture involving the superior endplate of L1, new since the prior plain radiograph from [**2195-3-19**], but stable since [**2195-12-21**].
Xray of the rib was not revealing.
- Initially, CT thoracic spine was ordered.
Given the concerning read of compression fractures, MRI thoracic spine was urgently ordered and Radiation Oncology as well as Neurosurgery/Spine consulted.
# Hypertension: Stable, was continued on home HCTZ once blood pressures stable.
They were later all restarted but discontinued secondary to her blood pressures being well below goal SBP<160.
