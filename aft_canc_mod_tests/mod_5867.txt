[**2186-12-28**] Cardiac Cath  History of Present Illness: 62 year old male who is transferred from OSH for NSTEMI.
He had a positive troponin there and received Lovenox, Plavix, aspirin.
His chest pressure has resolved.
He is now being referred for cardiac catheterization for further evaluation.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45%).
Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated left-ventricular filling pressures with an LVEDP of 13 mmHg, and systemic arterial hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 155/78 mmHg.
[**2185-12-29**] CT ABD/CHEST: 1.
Ground-glass opacity involving most of the right upper lobe corresponding to the abnormality on radiograph is with other smaller foci as above is most likely related to pneumonia or pneumonitis(including aspiration).
Would recommend a repeat radiograph or CT after appropriate treatment in six weeks.
Small non-specific arterial enhancing foci within the right lobe are likely perfusional can be followed up with a repeat CT or MRI in 6 months.
Single right and [**2-2**] left hypervascular adrenal lesions.
These are most concerning for possibility of multifocal pheochromocytomas and correlation with serum markers is recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: 62yoM with HTN, DLP, DM presenting with symptomatic bradycardia in the 30's in the setting of third degree heart block with ventricular escape rhythm and presenting with NSTEMI whose hospital course included cardiac cath showing triple vessel disease requiring Cardiac surgery evaluation and subsequent CABG.
============= [**Hospital 662**] HOSPITAL COURSE: [**2185-12-28**] - [**2186-1-4**] ================ # Coronary Artery Disease/CAD: Patient presented with NSTEMI and had cardiac catherization on [**2185-12-28**] showing multivessel disease.
Patient was monitored on telemetry during his hospitalization.
# Adrenal nodules: As part of pre-op evaluation, cardiac surgery requested a CT abdomen given history of hepatitis C. On CT, adrenal nodules were found with specific concern for pheochromacytoma versus metastatic disease.
Serum and urine labs were sent showing......
Radiology recommended follow-up CT in 6 months.
# DM:  Patient's blood sugars were not controlled during admission with last A1c 9.8.
Endocrine recommended changing insulin regimen to..... with better control of blood sugars thereafter.
He was started on Warfarin and dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 2.5.
INR at discharge was subtherapeutic at 1.1, and arrangements have been made with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to monitor Warfarin as an outpatient.
At discharge, room air saturations were 100%.
Discharge creatinine was 1.1. .
White count peaked at 16K.
Over several days, the erythema and white count improved.
White count at discharge was 12.7K.
#HEME: Required PRBC's early postop to maintain hematocrit near 30%.
Discharge hematocrit was 29%.
