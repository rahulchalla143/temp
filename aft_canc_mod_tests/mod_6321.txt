Based on his initial arterial blood gas post-intubation, it was supsected that there was some degree of carbon dioxide retention secondary to his COPD, which may have contributed in the setting of an infection.
Potential sources of infection included pulmonary given that his CT appeared possibly consistent with an aspiration event, urinary given his recent instrumentation, or prostatitis.
A head CT was negative for an acute process.
During his ICU stay, an MRI was obtained that did not reveal any evidence for acute stroke, metastases, or focal findings.
An EEG was not consistent with seizure activity.
His electrolytes were within normal limits.
A toxicology screen was negative, and per his nursing home physician and records, he had not been on any narcotics or other new medications.
A lumbar puncture was attempted, however was unsuccessful, to evaluate for abnormal cytology.
His x-ray on [**2166-11-16**] was consistent with fluid overloaded state (he had previously appeared dry and had received some intravenous fluids), so diuresis was initiated.
Based on his chest x-ray and CT scan, patient was treated empirically for hospital-acquired pneumonia given his recent admission to [**Hospital3 **], with vancomcyin, zosyn, and azithromycin.
By time of discharge pt did not complain of SOB even though he continued to have rales on exam R>L.
