History of Present Illness: 38 y/o female with history of ALL, diagnosed [**9-23**], status post complete remission induced by five cycles of chemotherapy but with recent relapse by bone marrow biopsy [**2135-6-13**] status post admission for reinduction chemotherapy [**Date range (1) 18555**] who presented to the ED from home with epigastric pain and fevers.
In the ED her vitals with T 99.1 orally, HR 109, BP 128/87, RR 16, and satting 100% on RA.
CXR was without evidence for pneumonia.
No CT scan was performed.
As above, she had a recent relapse of her disease by bone marrow biopsy on [**2135-6-13**] and had re-induction chemotherapy on [**6-17**] with plans to undergo matched un-related allogeneic stem cell transplantation if a donor becomes available.

MICROBIOLOGY: [**6-30**]: [**11-19**] blood cultures positive for coag neg staphylococcus.
CT CHEST ([**2135-7-13**]): New bilateral pleural effusions are very tiny.
Dependent ground-glass opacity in both bases clears in inspiration and prone imaging and are due to air trapping.
This study was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation except to note clips in the upper abdomen.
RUQ ULTRASOUND ([**2135-7-7**]): The liver is diffusely echogenic.
PELVIC ULTRASOUND ([**2135-7-7**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Follow up or son[**Name (NI) 18556**] could be performed if desired, for further evaluation of the endometrium.
LUE ULTRASOUND [**7-6**]: No evidence of DVT involving the left upper extremity.
BONE MARROW BIOPSY [**7-6**]: DIAGNOSIS: Relapsed B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Compared to a previous M08-407, S08-[**Numeric Identifier 18557**], the current biopsy shows greater cellularity comprised mostly of blasts with similar morphology to those seen on the prior biopsy.
TTE [**7-19**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Bone marrow biopsy [**8-1**]: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and reveals a markedly hypercellular bone marrow (90% cellularity).
# Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia:  Because the infectious work-up was negative, we decided to perform bone marrow biopsy to assess for ALL disease recurrence.
The decision was made by her outpatient oncologist to pursue an allogenic bone marrow transplant, so screening for bone marrow transplantation was undertaken she had a TTE, PFTs and an HIV test.
# Neutropenic fever:  Granulocyte count was 18 on night of admission.
When she arrived on the floor there was no clear source of infection; CXR and urine culture were negative and physical exam was remarkable only for mild epigastric tenderness.
Blood cultures were drawn; one of four samples grew gram positive cocci so she was started on IV vancomycin.
Blood cultures remained negative on broad spectrum antibiotics but she continued to spike fevers overnight.
A CT of her chest showed no active disease, a CT of her sinuses showed no sinusitis, cultures were all negative and it was thought that the fevers were due to her ALL so a bone marrow biopsy was done on [**8-1**] which showed a packed marrow.
Approximately two weeks after clofarabine completion on [**8-16**], with an ANC of 0, the patient again developed fevers.
Chest and abdominal CT did not show any source.
Blood cultures grew vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.
CT chest was consistent with volume overload, and she was tentatively diuresed given pericardial effusion (below).
On [**8-18**], her tachypnea was worsening, and she was transferred to the ICU for further management.
She had had a MRI to evaluate a possible new nodule seen on abdominal US, however the MRI showed no liver pathology except for iron deposition.
An abdominal CT showed pancreatitis so she was made NPO and given aggressive IV hydration and dilaudid for pain control.
After 6 days when she was still experiencing significant pain, abdominal CT was done to evaluate for complications, and it was negative for abscess or necrosis.
Pelvic exam was negative for cervical motion tenderness.
Pelvic U/S showed possible endometrial polyp versus intrauterine clot, two uterine fibroids, and stable right hydrosalpinx versus ovarian cyst.
Her platelets and red cells were repleted as needed; platelets were transfused to keep levels greater than 30 to minimize menstrual blood loss.
Further work-up could be pursued as outpatient when her cell counts recover; however, her epigastric pain resolved during the hospital course.
# Pericardial effusion:  TTE showed pericardial effusion with diastolic collapse of the right ventricle consistent with tamponade physiology.
