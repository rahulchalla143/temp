[**2167-4-30**] LENIs: No evidence of clot in bilateral lower extremities with limited evaluation of the left sided calf veins.
However, bilateral high-resistance pattern of renal arterial waveforms, with no antegrade diastolic flow.
Brief Hospital Course: 77yo man with recent pancreatic mass seen on CT in [**2-23**], DM, CKD stage III, hypertension and CAD s/p stent who initially presented for an EUS with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was found to be hypoxic with an O2 sat of 88% on RA, now with omental studding on CT, likely malignant ascites, and acute renal failure.
# Ascites: Upon admission, his ascites was causing significant distention; bladder pressure was 21 upon admission.
Ascitic fluid was sent for cytology on [**2167-4-30**], which was positive for malignant cells.
# Acute on chronic renal failure / Hyperkalemia: Admitted with Cr of 7.4, from baseline of about 1.3-1.4.
[**Month (only) 116**] have also be from hypoperfusion due to increased intraabdominal pressure from ascites, although his urine output did not improve much after paracentesis.
There was no clear evidence obstruction on CT either.
His Cr worsened to 9.6 on [**2167-5-3**].
# Hypoxia: Differential included pulmonary embolism (he had elevated d-dimer to 3678 and did have one isolated event of bloody sputum recently and likely underlying pancreatic malignancy), but no evidence of right heart strain or hemodynamic effects, and V/Q scan was low probability.
