Her BP improved after IVF and platelet transfusion.
She was seen by Neuro-Oncology, who felt that the decline in her cell counts was due to temozolomide.
However, she remained afebrile throughout this hospitalization (>48h), cultures were negative, CXR showed no sign of pneumonia, and cefepime was discontinued on [**2147-9-8**].
Neuro-Oncology recommends continuing filgrastim until her total WBC count is >4000.
Would continue to monitor cell counts, with goal Hct 21 and goal Platelet count 10k.
