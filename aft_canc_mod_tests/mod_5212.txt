ONC HX: In [**2124-5-22**], he was diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma following a pathological fracture of his left femur.
His leg was stabilized at [**Hospital1 336**], and a biopsy of the left thigh mass was positive for clear cell carcinoma.
His postoperative course was complicated by a PE and treated with Lovenox.
A bone scan also revealed metastasis to the left distal femur and right acetabulum.
Subsequently, in a staging work-up, a torso CT also indicated two lung lesions, and a lesion in his right kidney.
Later that month, an MRI of the brain indicated a solitary enhancing mass in the right occipital lobe.
An MRI of the thoracic/lumbar spine indicated lesions in the sacrum and T5 vertebrae.
He had an MRI of his Lspine on [**2124-12-23**], which showed stable involvement of L3-L4 but increased involvement of the sacrum.
His MRI head showed unchanged size of the right occipital and left temporal lesions compared with the previous MRI.
Physical Exam: VS - T 97.6, BP 128/90, HR 75, RR 20, sats 95% on RA, 5'[**28**]", 170# Gen: WDWN middle aged male, cooperative and awake, in NAD.
Strength 5/5 in UE - triceps, biceps, adductors bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: AXR [**2125-1-29**]: Unremarkable abdominal radiograph with no evidence of free air.
Ultrasound [**2125-1-30**]: 1) Limited study especially in distal superficial femoral vein and greater saphenous vein, however, no evidence of DVT.
Please perform abdominal and pelvic CT for the assessment of compression of IVC which can be a cause of symptoms and the change in waveform.
CXR [**2125-1-31**]: No evidence of active cardiopulmonary process.
CTA chest/CT abd/pelvis [**2125-2-1**]: 1.
Tib/Fib XRay [**2125-2-7**]: The portion of the intramedullary rod within the distal femur is visualized with the two distal interlocking screws.
Ultrasound LLE [**2125-2-8**]: No DVT in the left lower extremity.
Head MRI [**2125-2-11**]: Interval decrease in enhancement and FLAIR signal abnormality of the right occipital lesion.
Spine MRI [**2125-2-11**]: PENDING .
CXR [**2125-2-13**]: A right-sided PICC line terminates in the distal portion of the superior vena cava.
CXR [**2125-2-13**]: Lateral aspect of the right lower chest is excluded from the examination.
CTA [**2125-2-13**]: 1.
CXR [**2125-2-19**] Lungs clear, no evidence of failure.
CXR [**2125-2-22**] New opacity in the right mid zone concerning for pneumonia.
MRI [**2125-2-25**] No evidence for metastatic disease seen involving the cervical spine.
CXR [**2125-2-25**] Bibasilar interstitial abnormality, more pronounced on the left, has developed since [**2-22**] could represent either an atypical pneumonia or a pulmonary drug or transfusion related reaction.
Ultrasound negative for DVT.
He had a CTA on [**2-1**] which was negative for PE, and a CT abd/pelvis also done at that time showed no clear source of the fever.
On [**2-7**] he noted calf pain: tib-fib film was negative for fracture/metastasis and ultrasound was negative again for DVT.
A multidisciplinary meeting was held on [**2-9**] (social work, case management, medicine, anesthesia, nursing all represented) to determine the plan; the patient was approached regarding the decision to pursue an intrathecal pump, which he had previously rejected.
On [**2-10**], Mr. [**Known lastname 67759**] noticed that his right foot was tremulous; a full neuro exam showed clonus and hyperreflexia in his right lower extremity, a new finding not documented previously.
Given the high enough suspicion for cord compression, an urgent MRI was obtained and high dose steroids were started.
The MRI was negative for cord compression and the MRI head showed improvement in his known temporal lesion.
Overnight [**Date range (1) 25388**], however, he had an episode of oxygen desaturation to mid-80's on NRB, and he was subsequently found to be hypotensive to the mid-70's systolic; he was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for better monitoring overnight.
On [**2125-2-22**], pt spiked a temperature of 102.9 and developed a new oxygen requirement.
CXR revealed new RML infiltrate.
On [**2125-2-25**], pt spiked a temperature to 103.2 with an oxygen requirement of 2L NC.
CXR was obtained which revealed possible atypical PNA.
[**Last Name (STitle) 67760**] or seek medical attention in the ED if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, weakness, inability to tolerate liquids, or any other concerning symptom.
