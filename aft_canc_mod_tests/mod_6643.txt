Blood cultures drawn and patient sent to the floor for further management.
High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (prostate biopsy [**2175-8-26**], no treatment [**2-6**] "no cancer") 3.
Eczema (severe) - no recent exacerbations 6. h/o C. difficile colitis (just completed PO Vanc course) 7.
In late [**2175-7-5**], he again felt febrile and repeat CT of the abdomen revealed new or increased adenopathy in the left internal and external iliac groups, the largest area being 24 mm.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he underwent a CT of the torso showing multiple abnormally enlarged lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum,extending to the left common and external iliac chains to the left inguinal ring, highly concerning for recurrent lymphoma.
Biopsy of a left iliac lymph node showed involvement by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
The MIB fraction was approximately 90%.
Prostate cancer - biopsy on [**2174-8-26**] revealed high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia - Renal cell carcinoma - diagnosed [**1-/2175**] after routine work-up  including CT scan; s/p nephrectomy (considered curative) .

No pathologically enlarged mediastinal, mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy that would be concerning for recurrence, with marked interval improvement of previously noted lymphadenopathy in retroperitoneum and left pelvic region as seen on CT from [**2175-8-14**].
Previously noted band of enhancing soft tissue in left nephrectomy bed on examinations from [**2175-8-14**] and [**2175-10-23**] is incompletely evaluated on this non-contrast examination with no gross enlargement.
Again previously seen lesion in the liver on CT of [**2175-8-14**] is not visualized on ultrasound.

[**2176-3-1**]: CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis: 1.
[**2176-3-12**]: CT chest/abd/pelvis: 1.
[**2176-3-19**]: Non-contrast chest CT: 1.
Correlation with chest CT of [**2176-3-19**] demonstrates widespread abnormalities which have apparently progressed.
[**2176-3-22**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1.
[**2176-3-23**] Portable CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral parenchymal opacities have further increased in extent and severity.
Febrile neutropenia: There was initially no clear source based on cultures or imaging.
Nasopharyngeal swab and culture were negative for viral infection, so the tamiflu was discontinued.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2-2**] did not show disease recurrence.
There was concern for hepatic candidiasis given increased alk phos but hepatic MRI was negative.
PET/CT on [**2-16**] showed a massive, FDG avid spleen (22cm up 4cm since [**2176-1-31**]) and some FDG-avid nodes, concerning for disease recurrence.
He required daily platelet and blood tranfusions, thought to be [**2-6**] to splenic consumption.
CT torso on [**2-29**] showed new subtle ground-glass opacities bilaterally, predominantly in the bases.
Blood, urine, stool, and mycolytic cultures continued to be negative.
Repeat CT's on [**3-19**] and [**3-22**] showed worsening intrapulmonary processes, reported as likely infectious.
Antibiotic coverage was broadened to include daptomycin, zosyn, voriconazole, levaquin, and bactrim.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy/bronchoalveolar lavage on [**3-21**] and repeat on [**2176-3-24**], both negative for organisms or PCP; bactrim was then discontinued on [**3-24**].
The only culture positive data was from his JP drain fluid, which grew enteroccoccus; ID felt this was more consistent with colonization than infection, but the patient was nonetheless continued on Daptomycin.
He was tranfused PRBCs and platelets to keep his HCt above 25 and his platelets above 10.
Sputum culture on [**3-25**] grew GNRs, likely respiratory flora, but given persistent fevers, ID recommended changing levofloxacin to gentamicin, and zosyn to meropenem.
CXR and CT chest were consistent with progression of the patient's underlying lymphoma, and although he continued to be treated for infectious source, B lymphoma symptoms were also considered as contributing to his fevers.
Despite this, his CXR continued to reveal new opacities.
Respiratory distress: As above, the patient had worsening opacities on chest films and CT scans, concerning for infection.
After his bronchoscopy on [**3-21**], the patient was breathing comfortably and satting well, intermittently wearing 1-2 liters by nasal cannula.
The following day, he was found to be tachypnic, and ABG revealed PO2 of 69.
ABG revealed O2 of ~100, while on the NRB.
Stat chest x-ray revealed worsening opacities.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
Bronchoscopy was performed which was negative x 2.
CT abd/pel showed small peri-pancreatic fluid accumulations.
Acute Renal Failure: His creatinine on admission was elevated from baseline creatinine.
He was given IVF in the emergency department and on the floor and his creatinine returned to baseline.
He was started on antibiotics on admission but after his infectious work-up was negative they were discontinued given concern for drug fever.
He had a BM biopsy on [**2176-3-5**] which showed diffuse involvement by his known lymphoma.
JP amylase was sent in the evening of POD#6; the JP was discontinued on POD#7 as the output and amylase level were low.
CT abdomen/pelvis was done which showed an fluid collection at the splenectomy site with an enhancing rim and there was concern for infection given his recent fevers.
This collection was drained by interventional radiology and gram stain and culture were negative to date.
