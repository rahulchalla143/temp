She was doing well until [**2124-6-5**] when an irregular lesion was found in her right lower lobe on CT scan.
Core needle biopsy revealed it to be bronchioalveolar type carcinoma.
On her scan at that time there was also two other areas of ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe raising the possibility of multifocal disease.
Pathology revealed a 3.5 cm well differentiated adenocarcinoma that was originally identified as a pT2 N0 Mx lesion, but within the same wedge, a 1-cm satellite nodule of adenocarcinoma peripheral to the dominant mass was identified and therefore she was deemed T4.
After this time she underwent surveillance CT scans and most recently had a PET scan in [**2126-7-7**] which revealed a new nodular abnormality with increased activity in the right lower lobe.

She remained hemodynamically stable, oxygen saturations were 100% on 3 Liters via nasal cannula and her electrolytes were repleted.
On POD #1 she was transfused with 1 unit PRBC for a Hct of 24.
On POD #2 she was followed by serial chest x-rays which remained stable.
On POD #3 she developed atrial fibrillation with a RVR of 130-140's.
The beta-blocker was increased, amiodarone drip was started and her electrolytes were repleted, and her cardiac enzymes were negative.
Her TSH was mildly elevated in the immediate postoperative state.
She was transfused with 1 unit of PRBC for a Hct of 23 to a Hct of 25.
On POD #5 she remained in atrial fibrillation, DOE and still requiring 02 at 4L via nasal cannula for a saturation of 96%.
An echocardiogram revealed mild LVH.
On POD #6 her heart rate was better controlled with PO/IV diltiazem, and lopressor.
Her blood pressure remained stable.
On POD #10 her heart rate increased and she was started on digoxin with better rate control.
Her digoxin level was 0.6.
She was transfused to a HCT of 30.
On POD #14 her heart rate increased her meds were adjusted to maintain a heart rate in the 100's.
She was continued on her coumadin with goal INR of 2.0-3.0.
Cardiology is planning to contact her on [**10-8**] for further instructions, regarding her coumadin levels and INR testing, as well as when to follow up for cardioversion.
On [**10-6**], the patient and her husband, the nursing staff, and the thoracic surgery team felt that it was appropriate to discharge her with close follow-up.
