ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2107-2-2**]):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED - Pleural Fluid ([**2-4**]):     Gram Stain with no PMNs and no organisms     Cultures NGTD - Sputum Cx ([**1-29**]): >25PMNs, <10 Epis     Rare commensal flora     Sparse yeast - Pleural fluid: Fluid Culture in Bottles (Final [**2107-2-10**]): NO GROWTH.
CXR (PA & LAT) [**2107-1-26**]: There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which may in part be due to volume loss, although underlying small subpulmonic pleural effusion may also be present.
CTA Chest [**2107-1-26**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: A right paratracheal lymph node measures 1.2 cm in short axis and is stable.
The most proximal portions of the liver and spleen that are depicted on this examination are unremarkable.
Subsegmental PE in an artery to the left lower lobe.
Left UE ultrasound [**2107-1-27**]: FINDINGS: Grayscale and color ultrasound examination was performed on the left upper extremity.
CXR (Pa & Lat) [**2107-2-1**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Enlarged cardiac silhouette consistent with known pericardial effusion.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
TTE [**1-29**], [**2-3**], [**2-4**] done for monitoring of pericardial effusion.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
PCXR [**2-5**]: One portable upright view.
Comparison with the previous study of [**2107-2-4**].
TTE [**2107-2-10**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 87457**] is a 44 year-old woman with metastatic lung CA, recurrent malignant pericardial effusion, recurrent DVT and PE s/p IVC, SVC and brachiocephalic filter placement who presented with cough and dyspnea for 1 week and was found to have CTA concerning for PE and pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
Overnight she was urgently taken to CT surgery for pericardial window with internal drainage.
Pt also received 1 unit PRBC on [**2-1**] as her Hct had drifted down to 22.4.
As a result, the pericardial tube was clamped on [**2-3**] and the patient was monitored overnight without significant change in vital signs or symptoms.
On [**2-5**], the pericardial drain was removed after ECHO confirmed that there was constrictive physiology but no hemodynamically significant effusion 36hrs after the tube had been clamped.
Oxygen saturation remained low 90s on room air and decreased to 88-89% with ambulation.
She was scheduled for outpatient cardiology follow-up with outpatient echocardiogram for monitoring.
She was found to have an anti-factor Xa level of >2.0 consistent with therapeutic levels.
This was confirmed by CXR Pa/Lat which also noted small anterior component to R apical pneumothorax.
This finding was monitored with daily PCXR and found to be stable over the next 6 days.
However, with intubation and line placement, iatrogenic PTX is on the differential.
# Infectious Disease: No cultures were positive during CCU stay.
Around time pt went to OR for pericardial window, she had developed a temperature of 100 and was slightly more tachycardic.
She will need an outpatient MRI head and C-spine for further [**Hospital1 2742**] of her horner syndrome.
She was scheduled for outpatient MRV to evaluate for access for future chemo sessions and will likely need chest port.
