Hip films/AP pelvix [**2153-6-20**]: There is again seen a very large expansile lesion within the left proximal femora: There is a cortical breakthrough along the more medial aspect in the region of the lesser trochanter.

He was placed on a furosemide drip but urine output was minimal due to acutre renal failure secondary to light chain nephrotoxicity.
Multiple myeloma: He initially presented with calcium of 15 and acute renal failure.
Skeletal survey showed diffuse lytic lesions.
He is touch down weight bearing on left lower extremity with full assist with left leg lift due to his high risk of femur fracture.
Presented to ICU with creatinine of 5 to 6, with evidence of fluid overload and worsening hyperkalemia.
Initially as still making urine and able to diuresis with Lasix, however the patient became progressively anuric, with his creatinine peaking at 9.9.
Repeat ECG showed resolultion of ST changes.
Follow up cardiac enzymes showed up trending troponins with elevated but steady CK-MB.
Echo showed EF 55%, mild symmetric LVF, 2+ mitral regurg, 2+ tricuspid regurg, but no focal wall abnormalities.
The study was done in the setting of gross fluid overload.
