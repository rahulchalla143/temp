Further evaluation by MRI if not contraindicated is recommended.
MRI HEAD [**3-10**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
A questionable focus in the left side of the medulla- unclear if this is real/artifact; if real- ?metastasis- attention on follow up study which should include Spin echo post-contrast sequences in 2 or 3 planes in addition to the MPRAGE sequence.
Dedicated MR angiogram can also be considered, to assess the intracranial vessels as well as the vessel supplying the tumor and exclude a more prominent vascular etiology if any.
CT Torso [**3-11**]: 1.
MRI HEAD [**3-13**]: 1.
Unchanged blood products layering around the resection bed,1 cm leftward shift of normally midline structures, also unchanged, and decrease of the pneumocephalus within the surgical cavity compared to the post-surgical CT from [**2178-3-12**].
A post operative head CT was done, revealing stable/expected post-operative changes.
MRI of the head was perfomed to evaluate surgical rescetion.
Her CT Torso also revealed several lesions within her liver.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
