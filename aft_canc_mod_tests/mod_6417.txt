She was taken to outside hospital where head CT suggested bilateraly posterior fossa hyperdensities.
Head CT from OSH was suspicious for mass lesions with effacement of fourth ventricle.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

COMPARISONS: MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**2149-4-22**], and outside hospital CT dated [**2149-4-21**].
FINDINGS: As noted on the prior CT and MRI performed prior to this examination, there are multiple masses seen best in the posterior fossa with surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
These masses were better evaluated on the MRI performed prior to the study.
There is a small focus of hemorrhage in the subependymal/ventricular system in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, which is increased in size since the outside hospital CT dated [**2149-4-21**] at 18:49, approximately 24 hours earlier.
This hemorrhage is not significantly changed in comparison to the MRI performed prior to this exam.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained through the head without and with intravenous contrast.
Multiple lesions within the posterior fossa are heterogeneous in signal intensity and enhancement characteristics which may reflect underlying necrosis or calcification.

Her initial head CT showed masses in her posterior fossa.
Several hours after admission, she became agitated, confused and had a repeat head CT which showed a new small hemorrhage in the left ventricle.
On [**2149-4-24**] the patient had a CT chest which showed a 3-cm right lower lobe mass lesion and extensive associated lymphadenopathy, which was likely primary lung CA.
She had a bone scan which showed no evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
The following day, she had been scheduled for a lung biopsy to evaluate her multiple lesions, however she then declined both the biopsy and radiation.
