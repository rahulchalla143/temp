A subsequent colonscopy on [**2155-2-28**] was unsatisfactory, and thus the patient was admitted to the wards for observation, where he exhibited a persistently downtrending Hct from [**Date range (1) 100834**] (42 -> 34.9 -> 33.8 -> 27.7) and expressed significant abdominal discomfort, dizziness and orthostatic hypotension.
Given these continuing symptoms and decreasing Hct, a technetium bleeding scan was performed on [**2155-3-3**] which revealed extravasation at hepatic flexure, and the patient was subsequently transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU.
On arrival to the MICU, the patients vitals were: T 98.5, HR 93, BP 135/62, RR 22, O2Sat 100 on 2L, 93-94 on RA.
