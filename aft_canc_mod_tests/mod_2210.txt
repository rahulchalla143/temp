The donor was noted to be an antigen B mismatch, noted to have an antigen mismatch as well as to B core positive hepatitis B.
Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate revealed full both morphological and cytogenetic evidence of disease relapse, noted at that to be 98% donor.
She did have a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate last week; the results are currently pending.
We did an MRI which was essentially negative.
Bilateral mastectomies were performed in [**2191-1-26**].
Family History: Sister with DM, no history of malignancy   Physical Exam: PE: Young asain woman in NAD VS: T 98.6 BP 120/65 HR 97 RR 18 97%RA HEENT: PERRL, OP clear Neck: No LAD Lungs: CTAB Cards: tachycardic, regular rhythm, 2/6 SEM at LUSB ABD: +BS, scaphoid, ND, tender to deep palpation mcburney's pt, no rebound, no guarding.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smears: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
The white blood cell count appears decreased.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation.
The predominant population consists of interstitial blasts greater than 70% of the marrow cellularity.
TTE [**1-10**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study images reviewed) of [**2192-6-27**], there is now a small pericardial effusion.
CT head [**1-24**]: 1.
CTA [**2193-2-3**]: No evidence of PE.
Echo [**2193-2-3**]: Moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with evidence of mildly increased pericardial pressures and global biventricular hypokinesis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-1-9**], the pericardial effusion is larger (previously very small) and global biventricular systolic dysfunction are now evident.
Serial evaluation is suggested.
Echo [**2193-2-8**]: The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
LV systolic function appears depressed.
Compared to the prior study dated [**2193-2-6**], there is no change.
She had an echo prior to starting treatment which showed normal LV function.
She has been pancytopenic and has required platelet and blood transfusions to keep her crit > 25 and plt > [**9-21**].
After MEC a bone marrow was performed which showed a hypocellular marrow with 85-90% blasts.
# Febrile Neutopenia: Granulocyte count of 110 on admission.
All culture data has been negative to date except for a urine cx with 10,000-100,000 proteus mirabilis microorganisms.
Repeat urine cultures have been negative.
The rash was still present but not getting worse.
On [**1-26**] gentamycin was stopped and meropenem was restarted to better cover gram negative bacteria as the patient was still spiking fevers.
On [**1-24**], the patient developed diarrhea and c dif cultures were sent and are pending.
In addition, head CT showed some opacification of ethmoid and frontal sinuses.
Fungal cx sent and is pending.
CMV viral loads sent weekly have been negative.
A repeat bone marrow biopsy was performed when the patient's counts showed no signs of recovery.
She was briefly switched to Aztreonam which also seemed to worsen the rash.
Dermatology saw the patient and a biopsy showed spongiotic changes which were thought to be more likely consistent with drug rash although GVHD could not be ruled out.
# Epistaxis- This occured in setting of plt count < 20 K. She was given plts to keep goal > 35,000 and afrin nasal spray.
A chest CT showed evidence of a pericardial effusion and TTE showing RA/RV collapse in diastole.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was monitored with serial echos which showed persistent evidence of tamponade physiology.
The fluid collection was not thought to be drainable given its posterior location.
Her echo continued to show evidence of worsening tamponade physiology.
