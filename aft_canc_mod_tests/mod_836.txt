An area of increased subtle density at the right lower lobe base appears slightly more prominent when compared to the recent scout radiographs of the chest CT of [**2115-3-29**], even given differences in technique.
Although comparison to the recent chest CT is difficult given differences in technique, an area of increased subtle opacity at the right lung base could potentially represent an early pneumonia.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2115-5-5**] 3:47 PM CT CHEST: MDCT imaging was performed from the thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen after the uneventful intravenous administration of contrast.
COMPARISON: Chest radiograph [**2115-5-5**], CT chest [**2115-3-29**].
CXR with e/o PNA with RUL and RLL infiltrates in addition to known masses, also with fever and cough with sputum production.
Started cefepime, vancomycin and levofoxacin and blood cx were drawn prior to starting abx.
A CT chest was done that showed worsening tumor, but no evidence of PE or clear infiltrate.
Blood and sputum cxs were negative.
