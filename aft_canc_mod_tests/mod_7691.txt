Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 125.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2165-3-18**] the rhythm has gone from atrial flutter to atrial fibrillation.
CXR [**2165-8-28**]: Compared to the prior chest radiograph, there is slightly improved aeration of the right hemithorax with a moderate loculated pleural effusion.
An SVC stent is in unchanged position.
TTE [**2165-8-29**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %).
CXR [**2165-8-29**]: Moderate right loculated hydropneumothorax is unchanged allowing for the difference in position of the patient.
His heart rate was controlled to his baseline HR of 120's and his hypotension did not improve.
Initial bedside echo did not reveal significant pericardial effusion but formal echo in the AM revealed a mild to moderate posterior pericardial effusion with evidence of RV diastolic collapse consistent with tamponade.
His HR improved to the 120's prior to discharge.
SIADH: He has a histroy of SIADH and sodium levels remained stable  #.

We did an ultrasound of your heart that showed fluid around the heart, which may have been contributing to your low blood pressure.
There is a chance that this fluid will continue to accumulate and may continue to make your blood pressure low.
The VNAs can check you blood pressure at home and decide if you should stop taking this medication altogether or go back up to your regular dose  Followup Instructions: Please keep your regularly scheduled appt Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]  Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: TUESDAY [**2165-9-10**] at 1:30 PM With: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD [**0-0-**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 24**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage
