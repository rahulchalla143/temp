INVASIVE PROCEDURES ON THIS ADMISSION:  Central venous monitoring and exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions and drainage.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer from an outside hospital with abdominal pain and small pockets of free air on CT scan.
She presented to an outside hospital with these complaints with CT scan that showed pockets of free air in the pelvis but a difficult to interpret CT in the setting of bilateral total hip replacement.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature was 97.6, heart rate 113, blood pressure 115/70, respiratory rate 24, and she was saturating 96% on 3 liters.
Her white blood cell count was 16,000, her hematocrit was 34, platelet count 210.
She had BUN and creatinine of 22, and 1.2.
Her potassium was 3.2.
She had an AST of 58 and total bilirubin of 2.5 and alkaline phosphatase of 162, amylase of 100 and albumin of 3.3.
A repeat CAT scan showed less free air than on previous CAT scan and a chest CT was suggestive of lung cancer with suggestion of metastases with replacement of her liver.
With broad-spectrum antibiotics and serial exams, her condition stabilized although her abdominal examination continued to worsen.
Repeat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on [**2188-1-27**], which showed worsening small bowel obstruction.
Given the CT findings and her increase in white blood cell count, risks and benefits of an operative procedure were discussed.
Therefore on [**2188-1-28**], the patient was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy with drainage of phlegmon and lysis of adhesions.
