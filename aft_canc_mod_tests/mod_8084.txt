Her GCS per EMS was 3, and on evaluating her, witnessed a systolic blood pressure drop to 89 with respiratory rate decrease.
A CT scan obtained at [**Hospital3 **] was negative for hemorrhage or acute process (comfirmed upon [**Hospital1 18**] review), but because she was intubated [**Hospital1 487**] reported inability to obtain a clear exam to warrant tPA administration.
However, given the shortcomings inherent with an intubated examination and her difficulty arousing from sedation, she went to CT/CTA/CTP, which showed a left MCA clot at the bifurcation and left MCA stroke with perfusion mismatch on imaging.

[**6-8**] MRA brain Resolution of occlusion of the left M1 segment of the left middle cerebral artery, with persistent diminished flow in its branches compared to the right.
EMS was called, and patient was intubated secondary to GCS = 3 and poor respiratory drive.
Initial OSH CT scan was negative for hemorrhage or acute process.
Per ED Evaluation of patient, right sided weakness and left gaze preference were evident when weaned from sedation.
Emergent CT/CTA performed revealing left MCA clot at bifurcation with perfusion mismatch consistent with territory stroke.
Initial NIHSS stroke scale was 11.
The patient was sedated with seroquel and propofol for a short course and was able to be successfully extubated on [**6-16**], at which point repeat neurologic evaluation revealed her to remain globally aphasic with minimal responsiveness to command, but showed increased strength in her right extremities.
Cardiac: The patient on admission was allowed to autoregulate blood pressure with anti-hypertensives prescribed on an as needed basis for more severe hypertension.
We did start lower doses of her home antihypertensives after the acute post-stroke period and titrated up for goal blood pressure less than 140.
Workup for this cerebrovascular event included a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed no atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale, and normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Due to the traumatic intubation, a transesophageal echocardiogram was deferred and a cardiac MR was obtained.
This was a poor study due to patient movement but it did not reveal any thrombus in the atrium or aorta.
Heme: The patient was noted to have anemia with hematocrit to the mid-low 20s so CT abdomen and pelvis was obtained to assess for source of bleed but none was noted.
The CT did note "Small hyperdense rounded lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney" which will need to be followed up.
A hematologic malignancy consult was placed which noted an unremarkable peripheral smear.
ID: A urine culture was obtained grew enterococcus requiring a course of Amoxicillin therapy.
Repeat urine cultures grew no further bacteria.
Her oxygen saturation remained stable and she remained afebrile despite elevated WBC counts.
Endocrine: The patient was covered with sliding scale insulin, and an HgB A1c was obtained measuring 5.6%.
PENDING Results: Repeat urine culture  Transition of care issues: Needs repeat CBC in [**1-5**] weeks to ensure downtrending platelets and WBCs  1.
