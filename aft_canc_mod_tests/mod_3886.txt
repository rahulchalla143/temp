At this time a kidney/ureter/bladder x-ray was performed that revealed significant right- and left-sided intraperitoneal free air.
The patient was then sent back to the [**Hospital1 190**] for further evaluation and treatment.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.8 F, heart rate 81 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 148/71, respiratory rate 18, 100 % on room air.
Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with some coarse breath sounds reported.
Distal pulses are 2+ with no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Thus, at this time the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation and treatment.
This 75-year-old female recently discharged with an aortic valve replacement and atrial septal defect repair was brought back into the hospital for further evaluation of persistent intraperitoneal free air status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement on [**2117-9-1**], nine days prior to this at readmission.
A CAT scan was performed at this time that revealed no extravasation, though this did not satisfy our curiosity in regard to the possibility of anterior leak of the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
The patient was noted to be stable, was afebrile, with a leukocyte count that was within normal limits and unchanged from 5 days previously.
The plan at this time was to do a water-soluble contrast study through this PEG tube and to assess the patient in the prone position for possible anterior leak.
The rest of her laboratories was within normal limits.
We placed her PEG tube to gravity at this time with the plan to have a prone study performed the following day, and to continue to hold tube feeds at this time.
In addition, Clostridium difficile toxin was sent off which came back negative.
On hospital day #4 the patient continued to progress well and was noted to be comfortable and did receive 1 unit of packed red blood cells at this time for a hematocrit of 25.6, noted to be down from 28 the previous day.
The patient then had a follow up portable abdominal x-ray on Tuesday, [**9-14**], hospital day #5, that continued to show persistent large amount of free intraperitoneal air.
Thus, throughout the hospital course there was, at no point, that we could locate a definitive leak of contrast due to the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
On hospital day #5 these tube feeds were resumed, indeed, and the patient tolerated them well and was slowly increased to her goal rate of 50 mL per hour of ProBalance with fiber.
The patient also had a study of the venous system in the left upper extremity that revealed thrombosis of the left subclavian vein.
The patient was to receive 1 more week of vancomycin for positive blood culture and yeast in sputum.
