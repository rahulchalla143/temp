The pleural fluid amylase was also elevated, to 3x the serum value.
The Gram stain was negative, and cultures are no growth to date.
His noncontrast chest CT showed a RLL rounded opacity with no air bronchograms but density consistent with lung parenchyma.
He underwent a bronchoscopy on [**9-18**] with mild secretions and no endobronchial lesions visualized, and a BAL was sent.
CT chest with contrast showed the RLL opacity was a large mass with significant surrounding lymphadenopathy and marked pleural tumor, with possible invasion into the chest wall.
His CT was reviewed by Radiology who stated there was no evidence of esophageal perforation.
He was maintained on an IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], and his HCT remained stable for the remainder of his course.
