In [**2117**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] started reporting symptoms of constipation and underwent colonoscopy on [**6-28**].
A colonoscopy done by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 111702**] found a circumferential nonbleeding mass of malignant appearance at the rectum causing near complete obstruction.
On admission the patient's heart rate was in the 70s.
The blood pressure 127/70.
His cardiac examination was significant for irregularly irregular heart rate, which is consistent with his past medical history of atrial fibrillation.
His lung examination was clear.
On digital rectal examination at approximately 3 cm deep a firm circumferential mass was palpated and examiner could not pass the digit beyond the mass.
The patient underwent a gastrograph and stoma study in which the flow of grafting was seen going to the rectum instead of into the proximal bowel.
Upon exploration of the abdomen the distal sigmoid was looping through the lower right quadrant confusing the anatomy.
