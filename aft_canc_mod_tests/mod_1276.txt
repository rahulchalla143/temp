CTA of the chest ruled out a PE but did show a possible narrowing of the previously stented left main bronchus concerning for endobronchial mass, LAD, or esophageal mass impinging on the airways.
She was evaluated by speech and swallow who recommended thin liquids and soft solids and suggested GI workup of esophageal dysfunction which was deferred to o/p workup.
BP 100/80.
Peri-intubation was hypotensive and receiving 3rd Liter NS now.
Creatinine is only 1, calcium corrected is 12 with known history of lymphoma.
Had abdominal pain prior to intubation and with lactate elevation they wanted to do abd CT but did not get to it.
In addition they wanted a chest CT to eval for PE and re-eval the esophagus and LAD seen previously but did not get to that either.
CXR read there pending.
BP was 108/80 on 7mcg/min levophed.
She was not completely sedated and with palpation of the abdomen had grimacing but did not answer questions or follow commands.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).
Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-4-2**], regional left ventricular systolic function is now normal and the severity of aortic regurgitation is reduced ?impact of lower systolic blood pressure).
She also underwent LENI's and a CTA torso that were both negative for thrombus.
During her stay she underwent a bronchoscopy for further evaluation of her airways and samples for culture.
CT scans were negative for ischemia and she was treatedly broadly with vancomycin and cefepime.
Despite the initial improvement in her lactate, it again began to rise and was not responsive to fluids, concerning for a type 2 lactic acidosis that was not reversible, which given her rising LDH was likely related to an underlying malignancy especially given her lymphadenopathy seen on CT and h/o diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
Simultaneously her LDH climbed to over 40,000 and her lactate rose to over 20.
The evening of [**2138-4-18**] after discussion with the family it was decided to make her DNR and not to escalate her care further, later that evening she passed away with her family at the bedside.
