Recent AFB smears have been negative but a recent culture has grown positive for Xanthamonas.
In the ED today, initial vitals were T99.8, HR 191 BP 91/65 RR25 O2 100% NRB (77%RA).
His BP remained low and levophed was started.
A CXR was concerning for RUL PNA and fluid overload.
Cardiology was consulted and performed a bedside ECHO which revealed a loculated effusion unchanged from prior ECHO on [**2172-2-20**].
CT scan revealednecrotic lymph nodes in the superior mediastinum and periportalregion, and multiple low attenuation lesions in the liver and spleen concerning for microabscesses from a disseminated infection.

RUQ ultrasound: Perihepatic ascites and gallbladder wall edema, which are without the presence of cholelithiasis or biliary dilatation, the question of third spacing or even hepatitis should be considered.
Echo [**2-24**]: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Estimation of ejection fraction is impossible due to limited images although LV function appears significantly more depressed than previously.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echo [**2-26**]: IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity size with mild global left ventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-2-20**], left ventricular systolic function is slightly improved (previously overestimated).
[**2172-2-29**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1.
Moderate ascites, increased compared to prior CT study from [**2168-8-7**].
[**3-1**]  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 63305**] is a 54 yo M with h/o AML s/p a matched related allo transplant on [**2171-1-8**] with busulfan and Cytoxan conditioning with complications of CMV viremia, GVHD, hemorrhagic cystitis, and disseminated TB with 2 recent admissions with pericardial effusion and tamponade, s/p window on [**2172-1-10**], admitted with respiratory failure and hypotension secondary to pneumococcal sepsis.
Liver biopsy performed on [**3-10**], demonstrating minimal portal triads but generally burned out liver (from GVHD).
