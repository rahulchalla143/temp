Had ventricular ectopy which prompted an echocardiogram which revealed severe AI, a dilated ascending aorta and severe cardiomyopathy.
A cardiac catheterization did not show any significant coronary disease.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Biventricular systolic function is improved on inotropic support.
LVEF = 35%.

She was transfused for anemia with packed red blood cells and hematocrit remained stable post transfusion.
She remained in a normal sinus rhythm and her renal function remained stable.
