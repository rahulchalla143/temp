As this is his usual presentation for seizures, he was given valium 5mg at 10:05am and another valium 5mg at 10:15am.
At [**Hospital3 **], the patient was initially tachycardic to HR150s, O2 sat 89-90% on 10 L humidified air via trach and continued to seize (right facial twitching, left deviated conjugate gaze).
Labs there were notable for a leukocytosis (WBC 13.6), and subtherapeutic phenytoin (11.3) and phenobarb (14.0).
Urine and blood cultures X2 were sent.
CXR showed LUL pneumonia and thus the patient also received nebs, zofran 4mg IV and Cefepime 400mg /Cipro ??
Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for continuity of care and further work-up of acute critical illness, the patient received Decadron 10mg IV (unclear rationale), Fentanyl 100mg IV and Vecuronium 8mg IV X3 for irregular respirations.
En route to [**Hospital1 18**] via Med Flight, the patient was persistently tachycardic although maintained his blood pressures (106/60).
He received Xopenex nebs, and O2 sats intermittently dropped to 70-85% on assist control with TV 550, RR16, PEEP 13, FiO2 100%.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS: T100.0, HR143, RR35, 96% on aforementioned [**Hospital1 **] settings.
CXR showed complete white out of left hemithorax with air bronchograms and concern for Auto-PEEP.
ABG 7.33/45/53/25.
His [**Hospital1 **] setting were adjusted but second CXR still appeared concerning.
Ultimately, with decrease of PEEP to 5, decreased TV 380 and RR increased to ~24, the patient started satting more stably in the 90s with ABG 7.39/37/247/23.
The patient's labs were notable for Lactate 4.2, leukocytosis to 15.6 with bandemia, troponin T 0.06 and low dilantin (7.0, target 13-20) and phenobarbital levels (10.5, target 20).
Urinalysis was negative for UTI.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia.
The patient also received tylenol 650mg PR X2 and lorazepam 2mg X1.
The patient underwent CT head, CT chest, VP shunt studies which were reportedly unconcerning/stable prior to transfer.

Hypoxia: The patient was profoundly hypoxic and intermittently difficult to ventilate with CXR and CT chest concerning for a significant pneumonia in his left lung on admission.
He underwent flexible bronchoscopy on the day after admission and purulent secretions were suctioned and sent for culture which eventually grew out 2 strains of Pseudomonas as above (1 of which was extensively resistant) and 1 strain of Proteus.
He was treated with a 14 day course of broad antibiotcs which were then narrowed to Cefepime.
Because he was improving clinically, it was decided to not treat the very resistant Pseudomonas, however on [**7-2**]-15 he was noted to have a new temp of 101, WBC count rose from normal to 16.
Sputum cultures were repeated and showed continued growth of the resistant pseudomonas with no resistance to Meropenem.
They continuous EEG monitoring showed the jerking movements were not related to seizure activity.
He will need a Dilantin level check 10 days after his Colistin is completed.
His goal Dilantin level is [**11-7**].
# Ossified Mass: When Mr. [**Known lastname 4882**] received a CT scan of his chest, abdomen, pelvis to evaluate for a lung abscess based on his new fevers prior to initiation of Colistin an ossified mass was noted in his hip.
CT head concerning for worsening subdural hematoma given presentation of status epilepticus; however NSurg felt that the small amt of bleeding was not clinically significant and unlikely to cause these symptoms.
Serial head CT showed improvement.
Medications on Admission: * Amantadine 100mg daily * Baclofen 5mg three times daily * Docusate 100mg twice daily * Fragmin/Dalteparin 5000 units daily * Levetiracetam 1500mg twice daily * Phenobarb 60mg twice daily * Phenytoin 250mg twice daily * Refresh lacrilube ointment in each eye twice daily * Ranitidine 150mg daily * Senna 8.6mg tablet twice daily * Metoprolol 25mg twice daily * Milk of Magnesia 30mL daily PRN constipation * Bisacodyl suppository 10mg daily PRN constipation * Acetaminophen 650mg every four hours PRN pain/fevers .

You will need to have your Dilantin level checked 10 days after you finish your Colistin treatment, your Dilantin level should be between 10 and 20.
