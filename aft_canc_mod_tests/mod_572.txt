Pelvic exam revealed an enlarged uterus.
An ultrasound at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2121-4-1**] revealed a uterus measuring 13.1 cm in largest diameter.
She recently underwent examination and D&C with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14727**] which showed multiple vaginal tumors.
A biopay of two of the vaginal lesions revealed squamous cell carcinoma.
Past Medical History: SVT x 2 Neg ECHO and EKG No CAD  Surgical HX: Laprascopic BSO [**2117**]  Social History: No smoking Drinks Occasionally  Family History: Significant for a mother who died of ovarian CA at age 48, sister diagnosed with a stage II ovarian cancer at age 52, and a paternal aunt who developed breast cancer in her 60s  Physical Exam: Gen: Well developed, well nourished HEENT: sclerae anicteric, lymph node survey is negative Lungs: clear to auscultation Heart: regulart without murmurs Breasts: without masses Abd: soft, nondistended.
Uterine tumor, biopsy (A-F):  Poorly differentiated carcinoma with extensive necrosis.
Lymph nodes, right obturator (U-W):  Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma present in four of five ([**3-12**]) lymph nodes and blood vessels.
Lymph node, peri-aortic (Z):  Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma present in one of one ([**12-8**]) lymph node.
Lymph nodes, left peri-aortic (BA-EA):  Twelve lymph nodes, no carcinoma seen (0/12).
Other mucosal sites are less likely, but not definitively excluded.
Additional immunostains are being performed (ER, PR, and CDX-2) for further characterization, the results of which will be reported in an addendum.
Sinus tachycardia, rate 117.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no pathologic mediastinal, axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Limited evaluation of the abdomen demonstrates a new small amount of perihepatic ascites.
The previously identified hepatic lesions are better seen on CT of [**2121-4-2**] due to differences in contrast timing.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST: There are filling defects of the basal segmental arteries of the left lower lobe indicative of pulmonary embolism.
Hepatic metastases better seen on CT [**2121-4-2**] due to differences in timing of contrast.

TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced axial CT imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with coronal and sagittal reformats was reviewed.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Again identified in the chest are two paraspinal lesions (1.7 and 2.4 cm) that are concerning for metastases.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Multiple hypodense lesions likely metastases are again identified in the liver.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Bladder appears normal.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is stable atelectasis and small pleural effusions at the lung bases.
There is contrast material in the colon which presumably represents contrast from the prior study as it exhibits higher density values than the small bowel.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The amount of pelvic ascites is approximately stable.
POD 12, thrombocytopenia was noted.
She also received RBC transfusions for a HCT of 24.
Her PTT and INR were monitored daily and Coumadin was dosed accordingly.
#CV POD 2 she had SVT at a rate of 190-205 and BP 150/100.
She continued to have tachycardic episode with HR >130bpm.
Her JP drain was pulled on POD 23/11 and a suture placed.
POD 7, she had + flatus and +BM and was tolerating fluids.
She spike a temp to 101.7 on POD 10.
Blood cultures later showed no growth.
A CT showed intraabdominal ascites and free air, but no evidence of a Pneumonia or pelvic abscess.
A surgery consult was obtained on [**2121-4-27**] for evaluation of free air and a small amount of oral contrast in peritoneum and question of an anastomotic leak.
She went to the OR for an Exploratory Laparotomy and loop colostomy to repair an anastomotic leak.
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) for 7 doses: Have INR checked by PCP and dose Coumadin accordingly.
