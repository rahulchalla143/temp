CXR [**7-9**]: The fundic balloon, previously inflated in standard position, has now been deflated.
CXR [**7-11**]: Since the prior study there has been slight interval improvement in pulmonary edema which is still present associated with bilateral large pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis.
ECHO [**7-15**]: Suboptimal image quality.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist  RUE Venous U/S [**2171-7-17**]: Nonocclusive thrombus in the right internal jugular [**Month/Day/Year 5703**].
CT Head [**2171-7-20**]: No acute intracranial process.
EGD positive for bleeding AVM x5, s/p ablation.
Pt underwent TIPS on [**2171-7-9**] and portal [**Date Range 5703**] thrombectomy also done for non-occlusive clot present.
Hct stabilized after TIPS and [**Last Name (un) **] removed the next day.
His Hct did not drop but he was given 1 unit PRBC to be safe.
U/S demonstrated non-occlusive thrombi of RIJ and cephalic [**Month/Day (2) 5703**].
Monitored for worsening of GIB for several days prior to discharge and hct remained stable.
Had diagnostic para at OSH which had high WBC count but not enough PMN to satisfy criteria for SBP.
WBC monitored throughout stay, and gradually trended down.
WBC of 9 on discharge.
Obtained echo to eval cardiac function in setting of effusions and it showed "Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Went into afib with RVR to 140s on [**7-11**] and became hypotensive to SBP 80s while in RVR.
This happened again on [**7-14**] (RVR to 150s + hypotension to SBP 80s).
ECHO on [**7-15**] demonstrated EF >60% .
Transitional Issues: #Be aware of VRE colonization #Needs [**Hospital1 **]-weekly monitoring of electrolytes and HCT to ensure stability #Continue lovenox.
