On [**Holiday **], the patient visited with his five grandchildren, aged 10, 9, 7, 2 and 1.
Labs showed him to be anemic with a Hgb of 7.1 and Hct of 21 and thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 13,000.
His white count was normal at 6.3 but he had 11% bands in his differential.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed and per OSH records pathology was consistent with acute leukemia, although no Heme/Path reports were sent.
Mr. [**Known lastname 89956**] was then transferred on [**2132-3-20**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
A repeat bone marrow biopsy was done on [**2132-3-21**], pathology was consistent with ALL.
Cytogenetics showed the presence of BCR-ABL gene rearrangement in 90/100 cells.
Blood cultures from that day returned with 2/4 bottles positive for MRSA.
His PICC was therefore pulled on [**3-31**] and the tip was sent for culture, which came back negative.
An echo showed no signs of vegetation, and a replacement PICC was placed after 48 hours of remaining afebrile.
Several days later he spiked fevers again and was noted to have infiltrates on CT suggestive of multi-focal pneumonia, a subsequent bronch with BAL demonstrated MRSA.
Repeat echo again did not show any evidence of vegetations.
Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 89957**] creatinine began to rise from a baseline of 0.7-0.9to a max of 2.4 on [**2132-4-15**].
This was felt to be secondary to an episode of relative hypotension coupled with toxic levels of vancomycin.
A bone marrow biopsy on day +23 of his treatment showed no evidence of leukemia and normal cytogenetics indicative of remission.
He was re-admitted on [**2132-5-5**] for fatigue, new cough, and a elevated white blood cell count of 14.0.
An LP with prophylactic IT methotrexate administration was also attempted during hospitalization but was unsuccessful.
An ultrasound showed gallbladder sludge without cholecystitis and an ERCP was performed revealing blocked common bile duct.
A sphincterotomy was performed with extraction of sludge, stone fragments, and a small amount of pus.His total bilirubin was elevated to 10.3 several days s/p ERCP with stenting.
A repeat ERCP and MRCP showed no residual biliary obstruction.
A liver biopsy was then performed which showed a mixed picture of GVHD infectious cholangitis.
He was started on steroids for GVHD and his total bili had decreased to 2.5 upondischarge on [**2132-10-26**].
In [**2132-11-1**], pulmonary nodules noted on CT scan, and aspergillus in sputum.

IMAGING: [**2133-2-3**]: NON-CONTRAST CT CHEST Large, longstanding goiter, predominantly left sided, still displaces the trachea to the right and narrows it minimally.
Also improved since the previous study are a 6-mm wide fluid filled cavity in the superior segment of the right lower lobe that was 8 mm in [**Month (only) **] and an 8-mm wide cavity in the right middle lobe that was at least 16 mm.
These appears similar to the opacities seen on the recent CT scan, and likely represent an atypical infection.
Multifocal pneumonia appears similar to recent CT scan and likely represents a viral or bacterial infection.
[**2133-2-13**] CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: Overall, there has been little change in comparison to prior study from [**2133-2-3**].
Right PICC tip remains in the superior cavoatrial junction.
The study is not tailored for evaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures.
[**2133-2-13**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or infarction.
IMPRESSION: Air-fluid levels in maxillary and sphenoid sinuses with nearly complete opacification of ethmoidal cells consistent with acute sinusitis.
[**2133-2-15**] MRI HEAD WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are no acute changes.
A previously noted foci of T2 hyperintensity in the subcortical white matter on the MRI of [**2132-12-27**] are much less apparent and only few remaining foci are seen, which are unchanged from the earlier MRI of [**2132-6-29**].
The examination now is unchanged compared to the examination of [**2132-6-29**].
[**2133-2-16**] BEDSIDE EEG: The background activity showed a symmetric [**6-7**] Hz theta rhythm which briefly improved up to 7 Hz at times.
There were frequent bifrontally predominant or independent, right more than left, frontocentral spike and wave epileptiform discharges with phase reversals at F4-C4 and C4.
Review of the continuous EEG showed frequent frontal discharges with a prolonged run of 1 Hz periodic discharges in the frontal region for 10 seconds, but no video was available for clinical correlation.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an average rate of 80 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of frequent epileptiform discharges in the bilateral frontal or right frontocentral regions which are briefly periodic, at times, for few seconds without clear clinical change seen on video.
The background showed generalized slowing in the theta frequency range indicative of mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy which is etiologically non- specific.
[**2133-2-17**] EEG WITH VIDEO: ROUTINE SAMPLING/CONTINOUS EEG: The background activity showed a symmetric 7 Hz theta rhythm.
There were frequent bifrontally predominant or independent, right more than left, frontocentral spike and wave epileptiform discharges with phase reversals at F4-C4 and C4.
Review of the continuous EEG showed frequent such discharges during the evening and night recording with two prolonged runs of 1 Hz periodic discharges for 15 seconds.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an average rate of 80 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of frequent epileptiform discharges in the bifrontal or right frontocentral region which were briefly periodic at 1-2 Hz, at times, for a few seconds without clear clinical correlate.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an average rate of 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of frequent epileptiform discharges in the bifrontal or right frontocentral region which were briefly periodic at times for few seconds.
The background showed generalized slowing in the theta frequency range indicative of mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy which is etiologically non-specific.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Febrile neutropenia secondary to RSV pneumonia: Patient's presentation, with overall malaise and upper respiratory symptoms were most consistent with a viral respiratory illness (most likely grandchildren were source of infection).
CT appearance was most consistent with atypical bacterial pneumonia vs. viral pneumonia.
RSV grew in nasopharyngeal swab culture from admission, and wasfloridly positive on BAL [**2-14**].
He will follow up in [**Hospital **] clinic, and he will also have a follow-up chest CT in [**5-8**] weeks with an appointment in Pulmonary Clinic afterwards.
Non-contrast CT head did not show any evidence of hemorrhage, edema or mass effect.
MRI head showed decreased subcortical T2 hyperenhancements when compared to prior, and no new abnormalities.
LP on [**2-17**] was not consistent with infection.
EEG confirmed abnormal activity in bilateral frontal lobes.
Work-up for infectious diarrhea was negative, and lactate was normal.
Stool volume and frequency lessened with increased doses of steroids.
Reticulocyte index was indicative of continued hypoproliferation.
At the time, blood pressure and FSBS were within normal range, with a high heart rate.
CBC with diff was monitored, and antimicrobial medications were continued.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Pulmonary team recommended that the patient have a follow up CT scan in [**5-8**] weeks, followed by re-evaluation in Pulmonary Clinic to ensure resolution of pneumonia.
# Per Neuro-Onocolgy, patient should have a follow-up MRI in two weeks.
