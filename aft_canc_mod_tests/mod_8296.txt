Brief Hospital Course: On [**2176-9-6**], 64M with NASH cirrhosis and hx of HCC s/p RFA [**9-/2175**] with MELD of 28 admitted for liver transplant.
Hepatic duplex demonstrated patent hepatic vasculature with appropriate flow and no ductal dilatation.
He was anuric with creatinine increase to 4.6.
CVVHD was started via left temporary IJ line.
CXR demonstrated opacity at the right lung base, potentially associated with moderate pleural effusion.
Cultures remained negative.
On [**9-18**], torso CT was done to evaluate elevated LFTs.
On [**9-16**], a thoracentesis was performed.
Fluid was sent for cytology, gram stain and culture.
Gram stain had 111 wbc and 29 polys.
Culture was negative.
Subsequent CXRs were notable for persistent RLL atelectasis.
Review of CT by radiologist felt that enlargement of cardiac silhouette was  likely  due to mediastinal fat deposition.
Urine output increased around postop day 21 (200cc) and further increased to 1700cc by postop day 25.
Medications on Admission: - GLIMEPIRIDE 1 mg PO bid - METFORMIN 1,000 mg PO bid - OMEPRAZOLE 20 mg PO daily - SIMVASTATIN 20 mg Tablet PO daily - AMLODIPINE 5 mg PO daily - ASPIRIN 81 mg PO daily - CALCIUM CARBONATE-VITAMIN D3 600 mg calcium (1,500 mg)-400 unit PO bid - OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS-VITAMIN E   Discharge Medications: 1.
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg PO BID Hold for HR < 60 or sBP < 100.
Labwork and urine output will help the transplant clinic decide when it is safe for the dialysis to stop.
Any medication changes must be cleared by the transplant clinic  Followup Instructions: Fresenius Dialysis [**10-4**] [**Street Address(2) 35594**] #1  [**Location (un) **], [**Numeric Identifier 2876**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 110957**] ++++Call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 110958**] Clinic Manager on Friday [**2176-10-4**] am to get appointment time (~3:45)++++  Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14955**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] Date/Time:[**2176-10-10**] 1:15 Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14955**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] Date/Time:[**2176-10-17**] 3:15 Provider: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14254**], [**Name12 (NameIs) 1046**] Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] Date/Time:[**2176-10-17**] 4:00    Completed by:[**2176-10-4**
