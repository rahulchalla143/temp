NCHCT obtained from ED revealed progressive cerebellar edema.
-[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19839**]-like disease.
initial examination showed evidence of cranial nerve involvement of 3, 4, and 6 as well as dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia of the right arm and gait difficulty with falling to the right.
MRI showed a right cerebellar mass.
A torso CT had been essentially negative.
Biopsy of the lesion on [**2133-2-21**] confirmed GBM grade IV/IV.

REPEAT CT [**2133-5-12**] Since the prior examination, a ventricular drainage catheter has been placed via the right frontal lobe, with its tip positioned at the level of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
This finding was present on the prior study as well.
Although the size of the rim-enhancing lesion has not significantly changed compared to the prior study of [**2133-5-7**], there is slight increase in edema, but the deformity of the fourth ventricle has remained unchanged.
CXR Mild atelectasis at the base of the left lung is new.
Post operative CT scan showed persistent significant mass effect in the posterior fossa.
However, MRI scan with contrast and DWI sequebces to assess for stroke was performed.
