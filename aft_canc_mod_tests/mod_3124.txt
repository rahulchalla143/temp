Admission Date:  [**2202-4-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2202-5-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-10-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 477**] Chief Complaint: Fevers and chills  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: TEE  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 79 yo M with a h/o of multiple myeloma along with multiple other medical problems including diabetes and severe cardiac disease including coronary artery disease and chronic ischemic heart disease with an ejection fraction of less than 25% along with chronic renal insufficiency p/w 1 week h/o "not feeling well" and 1 day h/o fevers/chills and cough.
The patient was found at rehab to have a temp to 104.3/BP 82/45 and decreased UOP.
In the ER, the patient wasd febrile to 104 with SBP in the 70's.
His lactate was 4.1 with WBC 6.1 with 6% bands.
A UA was negative and a CXR was clear.
Now on Procrit and pulse dose decadron- last pulse in [**Month (only) 216**].
CRI (recent Cr 2.6) Prostate cancer, status post radiation therapy.
Oncology History: Diagnosed with MM in [**12-29**] when he was noted to be mildly anemic with a hematocrit of 36.
Further workup with serum protein electrophoresis revealed a suppressed IgA and IgM with an elevated IgG of over 4 g consisting of monoclonal band.
He, at times, would have pulses of Decadron twice in [**7-/2200**] and then 1 pulse in [**1-/2201**] but these often led to exacerbation of his congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization.
He has been receiving Procrit for chronic anemia with periodic transfusions in order to maintain his hematocrit 28-30% due to his cardiac history.
During the admission, he was found to have new lytic lesions in the hip and back and was treated with radiation therapy to the hip and back area along with a pulse of Decadron.
His last treatment (until this week) for his myeloma was with a 3-day pulse of melphalan at 10 mg daily starting on [**2201-10-12**].
Family History: Father laryngeal cancer, depression and history of gynecologic cancer in two or more relatives, mother MI at 72y/o   Physical Exam: VS - T 103 (rectally), HR 74 BP 113/47 O2 93% 4L General - thin male, NAD HEENT - PERRL, dry mucous membranes Neck - supple, RIJ in place Chest - RRR +pacer device in place Lungs - bilateral crackles at bases Abdomen - soft, NT/ND Ext - [**1-29**]+ pitting edema b/l   Pertinent Results: REPORTS: .
[**2202-4-23**] CXR - Single portable AP chest radiograph is compared to [**2202-4-6**] and demonstrates no significant difference.
The cardiac silhouette is stable, and the mediastinal contours are stable.
If clinical suspicion is high, bone scan or MRI may be considered.
TTE [**2202-4-29**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to akinesis and fibrosis of the inferior and posterior walls, with at least mild hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Tissue velocity  imaging demonstrates an e' of <0.08m/s c/w an elevated left ventricular filling pressure (>12mmHg).
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2202-2-4**], no major change is evident.
TEE [**2202-5-4**]: Negative for vegetation (prelim) .

Sepsis: The patient was febrile to 104 on admission with SBP in the 70's.
A lactate was 4.1, 6% band, and requiring levophed for hypotension.
A CXR and U/A were unremarkable.
Hand X-rays were ordered to look for osteo (negative) and repeat urine and CXR were obtained (were negative).
A TTE did not show vegetation, and TEE also did not show vegetation (prelim read).
This was quickly weaned off a few hours after admission, cortstim test (56-->57) was unclear and difficult to interpret.
Repeat echo showed EF 20-30%, 3+ TR, 3+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]n seen.
The patient's chemotherapy/steroids were held because of the patients poor clinical status.
