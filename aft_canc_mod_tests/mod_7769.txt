LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-7-6**], the severity of aortic stenosis is slightly increased.
MRI/MRA Head FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
MRA OF THE HEAD:  The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2132-9-21**] 12:26 PM  CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: improvement of edema, etiology of hemoptysis.
Abnormal interstitial pattern on the current study is attributable to COPD.
ABG 7.35/48/52, lactate 1.8, tachypneic to 30's, SaO2 low 70's on NRB, BP 170/110, HR 80's.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
Sputum gram stain obtained after intubation demonstrated gram-positive cocci in clusters, and pt was started empirically on vancomycin for PNA.
Upon further review gram stain was read as gram positive cocci in pairs, not clusters.
# Worsening positional occipital headache/Gait Instability: Pt reported symptoms of lightheadedness on exam with positional change, although orthostatics negative in ED and on floor.
CT and MRI head were negative for acute pathology.
On exam she has peripheral neuropathy of both LE extremities.
Vit B12 is normal, TSH is elevated and free T4 is pending.
EKG did not show new ischemic changes and her cardiac enzymes were negative.
Echo obtained in MICU demonstrated new wall hypokinesis at the left and right ventricles, with depressed ejection fraction at 40-50%.
Her INR gradually came down and on presentation to the floor was at 2.7->1.8->1.5->1.3.
Her INR will need to be monitored daily with warfarin dosed accordingly to achieve therapeutic INR level of [**1-12**].
Her blood pressure recovered and she was placed back on valsartan the day before discharge.
Warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO 1mg M-F, 2mg [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **]: Can dose 1 or 2mg until INR is therapeutic [**1-12**].
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**12-11**] Sprays Nasal TID (3 times a day) for 7 days.
Goal INR is [**1-12**].
