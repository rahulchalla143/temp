Multiple imaging performed of patient's left neck/shoulder as he complained of significant pain in the area.
MRI of claviculomanubrial region was consistent with osteomyelitis and possible septic joint, however no fluid was available for aspiration.
Unfortunately the yield of bone biopsy in setting of antibiotics is quite low and since the pre-test probability is high for osteomyelitis in this patient, it was decided to treat presumptively for osteomyelitis.
Since heparin could be safely stopped, the patient had another colonoscopy which was terminated due to a poor prep.
His hematocrit was trended and was stable, requiring no blood transfusions.
He was taken back for a 4th and last colonoscopy the following day and all remaining polyps were removed.
He will need a repeat colonoscopy in one year.
Polyp pathology was pending at time of discharge.
TEE was performed and was negative for vegetations.
Imaging on presentation was consistent with significant muscle strain.
Patient's hematocrit was notably decreasing from 37 to 27 during hospitalization.
Heparin gtt was held and patient's hct stabilized in the upper 20s.
Outpatient Lab Work Every Monday while on antibiotics ([**7-11**], [**7-18**], [**7-25**], [**8-1**]): CBC/diff, BUN/Cr, ALT, AST, Alkaline Phosphatase, Total Bilirubin All laboratory results should be faxed to Infectious disease R.Ns.
You had a colonoscopy because this bacteria can commonly be in your large intestine.
You had another colonoscopy and your polyps were removed.
This may mean you are bleeding from the polyps that were removed in your colonoscopy*****  You will need a repeat colonoscopy in one year.
We monitored your blood levels closely as these were drifting down.
We stopped your blood thinner because you do not need this anymore and your blood levels remained stable.
Last dose: Thursday, [**8-4**] 5.
