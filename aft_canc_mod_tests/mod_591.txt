; Resp Cx grew out yeast (sparse growth)  RADIOLOGY: CT C-Spine ([**2194-10-27**]) -IMPRESSION: 1.
Minimal anterolisthesis of C4 over C5 and C7 over T1 and minimal retrolisthesis of C5 over C6 of indeterminate age, but could be degenerative.
CT Head ([**2194-10-27**]) - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
Hip X-Ray ([**2194-10-27**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
Wrist X-Ray ([**2194-10-28**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR ([**2194-10-29**]) - IMPRESSION: New left lower lobe atelectasis with pleural effusion could be due to aspiration.
CXR ([**2194-10-29**]; at time of MICU transfer) - As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
CXR ([**2194-11-3**]; at time of MICU callout) - IMPRESSION: Significant interval improvement in multifocal airspace opacities.
Echo ([**2194-10-30**]) - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).

CT head was without acute process.
Hip xray showed a right intertrochanteric-subtrochanteric fracture of the femur extending to the lesser trochanter with varus angulation.
While in the MICU, she had an echo which showed mild atrial stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary artery hypertension, and an EF of 75%.
Repeat CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
ABG on a non-breather was 7.34/34/170.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no other changes compared to priors.
CTA did not show evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Also, bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds showed no evidence of DVT.
# Anemia - On admission, the patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies notable for low iron and ferritin.
Her hematocrit was trended.
# Leukocytosis / Thrombocytosis - On [**2194-11-8**], as the patient was approaching discharge, she was noted to have rising white blood cell and platelet counts.
A urinalysis showed bacteriuria; however, two urine cultures grew out yeast alone.
Two stool cultures were negative for c.diff.
Blood cultures also were drawn and did not grow out anything by the time of discharge.
A chest x-ray did not show signs of infection.
LFT's showed elevated LDH and alkaline phosphatase, which could be consistent with her underlying malignancy.
This was discussed with the heme/onc fellow, and it was felt that that the patient's leukocytosis and thrombocytosis were consistent with an inflammatory state secondary to her recent PNA and UTI as well as her mailgnancy.
It was discussed with the patient's family that further work-up of this would include a bone marrow biopsy.
After the transition to PO metoprolol, the patient's blood pressure was better controlled.
# Of note, a speech and swallow evaluation on [**2194-11-4**] recommended nectar thick liquids and pureed foods, with the patient's meds being crushed in puree.
Repeat speech and swallow done on the day prior to discharge cleared the patient for a regular diet.
