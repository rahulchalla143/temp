A bone marrow biopsy on [**2127-6-26**] revealed a hypocellular bone marrow with 5-10 % cellularity and no evidence of leukemia or other marrow infiltration.
EBV IgM was positive at that time with a low titer of IgG.
A repeat bone marrow evaluation on [**7-29**] showed mildly hypocellular marrow with approximate cellularity of 30% and erythroid dominance.
She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] -  Upon discharge, her counts remained stable and her ANC has ranged from 300-500, platelets from 14-21,000, and hematocrit from 23.8-27.4 without transfusion support.
Rate: 20, O2 Saturation%: 100.

Antiplatelet antibody was positive while antigranulocyte antibody was negative.
Bone marrow biopsy was performed on [**8-14**] and was interpreted as myelodysplastic syndrome evolving to an acute erythroid leukemia.
A bone marrow biopsy performed on [**10-14**], which showed an ablated marrow, and the patient was consented for her bone marrow transplant.
Her methylprednisolone was weaned by 5mg qweek, and her mycophenolate was eventually titrated up to 100mg TID.
She was then found to be bacteremic on [**10-13**] blood cultures with coagulase negative staph, which is oxacillin-resistant, and sensitive to vancomycin.
All surveillance cultures are NGTD, as of [**10-14**].
The patient spiked again on [**10-21**] (Day -6), at that time her blood and urine were cultured and cefepime was restarted.
Her [**10-22**] cultures showed pan sensitive klebsiella.
Since this positive culture, her surveillance cultures have been negative for over 72 hours.
# Hyponatremia: The patient was noted to have a sodium on 127 on day -1.
At that time, fluid restriction to 1L was started, urine and urine electrolytes were obtained, which showed elevated urine sodium and and osmolality of 568.
After 24 hours of fluid restriction, her sodium normalized to 134.
# Mucositis: The patient began to experience symptoms of mucositis on day+1, including mouth pain, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Viral load was 12,600,000 in [**Month (only) **] [**2127**], then down to 2.27 million and after chemotherapy came up to 5 million.
Liver biospy was performed on [**8-27**], which showed grade 1, stage 1 Hepatology following, liver biopsied, which was consistent with chronic viral hepatitis, grade 1 inflammation, stage 1 fibrosis.
#Abnormal lung findings on CT:  CT chest showed presence of ground glass opacities in bilateral lobes c/w infectious etiology.
Galactomannan, b-d-glucan, crptococcal antigen, and histo antigen were all negative.
Pt had a bronchoscopy on [**8-28**], and BAL studies are negative to date.
In addition, she briefly developed a contact dermatitis under her breasts bilaterally secondary to the adhesive on EKG leads; hydrocortisone was prescribed to these areas only.
During her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay, her antihypertensives were held initially.
Her blood pressures were high in the SBP's 160's-190's, particulary when agitated or stimulated.
Her blood pressures subsequently normalized.
# Acute Renal Failure: Her creatinine began rising on [**11-20**] and steadily climbed during her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.
On further analysis, her urine electrolytes did not show a pre-renal etiology and urine eosinophils were negative.
Her creatinine peaked at 5.2 and then slowly began trending down.
Due to her ARF and volume overload that was thought to be contributing to her failure to wean from the vent, CVVH was started on [**12-6**] and continued through [**12-16**].
Her phosphate continued to increase to 9.0 on [**12-19**] and she was begun on aluminum hydroxide phosphate binder.
Upon transfer to the floor, her renal function improved steadily off of hemodialysis, and she consistently produced approx 2L urine daily.
Her CXR showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates concerning for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 16030**] PNA, pulmonary edema or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
A bronchoscopy was performed.
BAL did not reveal any WBC's, RBC's, bacterial culture, fungal culture, viral culture negative and Nocardia negative.
PCP was negative as well.
A chest CT showed significant improvement suggestive of either resolving infection or decreasing pulmonary edema.
Her chest X-ray then worsenened, and radiology was once again concerned about alveolar hemorrhage versus infection.
A repeat bronchoscopy was performed which showed gross purulent material on the ET tube but no blood.
Further cultures showed two colonies of pseudomonas, cefepime was switched to Zosyn and cipro was continued.
Sensitivities of the cultures showed that they only were mutually sensitive to meropenem, so her cipro and zosyn were discontinued and she was started on meropenem.
Ceftazidime was added on [**12-22**] for sputum culture results showing intermediate resistance to meropenem.
#CMV Viremia: CMV PCR from [**12-11**] detected viral load of 658. repeat CMV PCR on [**12-16**] detected over 9,000 copies.
#Coag neg Staph: patient had coag neg staph grow from tip culture on [**12-16**].
Given her changing creatinine clearance, her vancomycin levels were checked daily and vancomycin dosed accordingly.
She was treated with Cefepime and Cipro until the gram stain only showed oralpharyngeal flora.
However, WBC dropped to 1.5 on [**12-24**] and medications were examined for potential myelosuppression.
*[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course [**Date range (1) 16032**]*  50 y.o.
woman s/p 7+3, and s/p allogenic bone marrow transplant on [**10-29**], transferred to the MICU after tonic clonic seizure and hypoxic respiratory failure.
Underlying problem: PNA v. pulmonary hemorrorhage in setting of seizure with platelets of 17 v aspiration pneumonitis.
Bronchoscopy revealed numerous blood clots, likley old blood from tracheostomy placement.
Patient continued to be tachypneic with rates from 30-40, along with ABG showing relative hypercarbia and hypoxia despite vent changes.
This decision was made after discussion with her husband, the [**Name (NI) 153**] attending, and the [**Name (NI) **] attending.
CT did not show evidence of bleeding.
MRI c/w Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome.
Cultures were unrevealing.
Her blood presssure was maintained SBP's < 140 on lopressor.
Her meropenem and mycophelate were discontinued.
Bone marrow biopsy was not consistent with loss of graft, and she was continued on neupogen .
#CMV Viremia-Viremia detected from PCR, repeat PCR showing increased viremia.
CMV viral load [**12-22**] 2160 copies.
