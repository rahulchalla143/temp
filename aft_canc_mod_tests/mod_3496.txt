Cystoscopy with biopsy 3.
Upon admission his creatinine was noted to be 6.4 up from a baseline of 1.0.
A gastrograffin enema and a cystogram was done showing a large filling defect involving the bladder, but no frank fistula.
A biopsy has shown squamous cell carcinoma.

STUDIES ------- [**2196-12-19**] Renal ultrasound The right kidney measures 12.6 cm.
[**2196-12-21**] CT abdomen and pelvis Study is compared with outside ([**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital) _____ CT, dated [**12-15**], as well as interval renal [**Name (NI) 75758**], dated [**2196-12-19**].
Evaluation of the urinary tract, in particular, the bladder, is limited by the lack of intravenous contrast material.
There is no intramural hematoma or discrete peri-aortic fat-stranding to suggest "leak" limited evaluation of the _____.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior (inferolateral) walls.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
After re-evaluation of his obstruction, bilateral percutaneous nephrostomies were placed with very rapid resolution of his ARF to a serum creatinine at his baseline.
A number of electrolyte abnormalities developed during his post-obstruction diuresis, such as hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, which were corrected as needed.
Urology and Oncology consultation was obtained, and re-imaging by ultrasound and CT were done of the bladder mass.
Initial gram stains and studies demonstrated gram positive and gram negative bacteria and antibiotics were continued, and later tailored based on sensitivities.
Oncology then requested the pathology slides of his spine biopsy to compare to the pathology from the cystoscopy.
During his invasive studies, warfarin anticoagulation was held, with the plan to resume later; at the time of discharge this was being resumed at 10 mg daily with a heparin bridge, to be completed at the rehabilitation hospital.
Preliminary heparin dependent antibodies were positive, and confirmation serotonin release studies were negative.
The patient was restarted on warfarin anticoagulation with a goal INR [**2-13**], and covered with unfractionated heparin infusion on a weight based protocol with PTT monitoring.
Numerous studies done at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and direct cystoscopy by Urology here at [**Hospital1 18**] failed to demonstrate a fistula; however, the enteric organism leading to his urinary tract infection argued for a fistula.
A charcoal study was positive with the third urinary fraction (out of 4) positive; General surgery and Urology were consulted again, and it was determined that the patient was not a suitable surgical candidate for fistula repair.
C diff negative times 4 stool assays.
Potassium & Sodium Phosphates [**Telephone/Fax (3) 4228**] mg Powder in Packet Sig: One (1) Powder in Packet PO BID (2 times a day).
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution Sig: Four (4) mg Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed.
Heparin (Porcine) in D5W 100 unit/mL Parenteral Solution Sig: 1100 (1100) Units Intravenous once a day: 1100 units per hour continuous parenteral infusion; check PTT every 6 hours, adjust heparin dose according to sliding scale (included) until stable dose determined.
Heparin drip should be continued until INR has been therapeutic (between 2 and 3) for at least 48 hours.
