At [**Hospital1 498**], CXR showed right-sided volume loss, likely secondary to post-obstructive atelectasis from tumor, and bedside echo showed a "moderate pericardial effusion" without evidence of tamponade.

ECHO REPORTS: [**9-15**]: Large pericardial effusion with echocardiographic evidence of early tamponade.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of earlier on [**2158-9-15**], the pericardial effusion has been drained, with minimal residual effusion.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of earlier in the day on [**2158-9-17**], the findings are similar.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-9-21**], the findings are similar.
CT CHEST:1.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  # Pericardial effusion: pt found on CT chest to have pericardial effusion.
TTE showed evidence of tamponade physiology.
A pericardial [**Hospital3 19843**] was left in place for 2 days.
Repeat TTE showed resolution of effusion, and the [**Hospital3 19843**] was pulled after 2 days (on [**2158-9-17**]).
Troponins were negative x 2.
Effusion fluid was sent for culture and cytology; cultures were negative and cytology did not show renal cell carcinoma.
Echo on [**9-18**] did not show reaccumulation of fluid and she was transferred back to the OMED service.
Repeat echo on [**9-21**] showed small amount of fluid but no tamponade, so echo was again repeated on [**9-22**] and findings were stable.
Urine cultures came back negative.
