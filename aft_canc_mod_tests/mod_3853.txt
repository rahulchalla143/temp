Admission Date: [**2186-2-25**]        Discharge Date: [**2186-4-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-4-19**]        Sex:  M  Service:  MED   DATE OF EXPIRATION:  [**2186-4-1**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old male with past medical history of coronary artery disease, status post 4-vessel CABG in [**5-4**], status post pacemaker placement who was admitted for evaluation of elevated white blood cell count.
CBC there showed white blood cell count of approximately 128,000.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:  Vital signs - temperature 101.3 degrees, heart rate 86, blood pressure 119/63, and respiratory rate 20.
Head and neck exam had pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY, X-RAY, OTHER STUDIES:  Complete blood cell count on admission was 128,000 white blood cells, 32.8 hematocrit, platelets of 76.
Chemistry was remarkable for sodium 138, potassium 2.7, BUN 20, creatinine 1.3, and glucose 61.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Leukemia:  The patient underwent bone marrow biopsy, result consistent with acute myelogenous leukemia.
Notably, on admission, he had febrile neutropenia with an ANC less than 500.
He was supported with blood products including platelets and serial blood transfusions to keep platelet count greater than 10 and hematocrit greater than 25.
Additionally, towards the end of his hospital course, a peripheral smear started to reveal presence of immature cells.
CT scan of the chest at that time demonstrated right upper lobe ground glass opacities concerning for infection versus hemorrhage.
He underwent bronchoscopy on [**2186-3-7**] with grossly bloody lavage fluid concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
As part of the workup for his dyspnea, he also underwent echocardiogram, which showed a depression of his ejection fraction to 40 percent.
In light of this, repeat CT scan was performed on [**2186-3-20**], which demonstrated persistent bilateral diffuse interstitial opacities concerning for atypical versus fungal infection versus cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
He underwent repeat bronchoscopy on [**2186-3-21**] with cultures growing budding yeast, which was speciated as [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.
There was a concern whether he had some evidence of aspiration versus hospital acquired pneumonia as serial chest x-rays demonstrated left lower lobe and lingular opacities.
After transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he underwent a CT angiogram of the chest.
This was felt to be a limited study secondary to consolidation, atelectasis, and due to patient movement.
At this time, it was felt that the patient's prognosis was very poor given his increased need for hemodynamic support via pressors in his prolonged persistent hypoxia unresponsive to ventilation techniques, and broad spectrum antibiotics for possible pulmonary process.
As part of the workup for his dyspnea, cardiac components were evaluated as well.
Echocardiogram showed an EF of 40 percent with inferolateral hypokinesis and anteroseptal hypokinesis, which was a new finding.
As noted, in the management of his dyspnea, return of his white blood cell count was felt to result in some element of engraftment syndrome, which necessitated treatment with steroids.
An ultrasound was done to assess the hepatobiliary system and there was no evidence of hepatic involvement.
Evaluation of his parathyroid hormone found it to be markedly elevated.
Intravenous pressors, which were being used for hemodynamic support were slowly weaned.
