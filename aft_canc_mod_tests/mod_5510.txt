Although these findings could be explained by bilateral tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic phlegmon, malignancy cannot be excluded as the cause.
An MRI on [**2165-7-13**] showed a bilateral complex adnexal masses.

If there is clinical concern for bowel obstruction, CT is recommended  [**Date Range **] Report CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2165-7-16**] 5:10 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Distended small bowel loops with air-fluid levels indicating high-grade small-bowel obstruction with a transition point in the deep pelvis at the pelvic mass.
Heterogenous enhancement of the liver of uncertain clinical significance, a CT liver is advised to assess further.

[**Date Range **] Report CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2165-7-29**] 6:12 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Since prior exam from [**2165-7-16**], patient is status post total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy with significant reduction in tumor burden.
Multiple lesions within the liver, previously characterized to be of [**Year (4 digits) 68009**] etiology on MRI from [**2165-5-26**].
Her blood pressures normalized on POD#1 off of pressors.
Overnight, she developed tachycardia of unclear etiology and a CT chest was performed to rule out a pulmonary embolism, which was negative.
She also had bilateral ultrasounds of the lower extremities that was negative for DVTs.
Her postoperative course on the floor was notable for the following:  * Desaturation of oxygen The patient was noted to have an oxygen saturation of 88% on RA.
She had a chest xray performed, which was negative.
Another CT chest was performed to evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
A CT of the abdomen was performed on POD#11, given persistent ileus to assess for obstruction, which was negative.
* Hematology The patient started with a preoperative hematocrit of 33, and received two units of PRBC intraoperatively.
Her hematocrit was serially followed postoperatively until noted to be stable.
She had a renal ultrasound performed that was unremarkable.
Her urinanalysis and culture were without evidence for urinary tract infection.
The CT of the abdomen showed collection of fluid measuring up to 1 cm along the anterior abdominal wall incision site, which likely will resorb.
