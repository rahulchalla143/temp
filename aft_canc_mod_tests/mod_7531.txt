She was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Past Medical History: hypercholesterolemia, basal cell CA removal from Bilateral UE's, bilateral cataract surgery, colon adenoma s/p biopsy   Social History: She stopped smoking 35 years ago.
Pupils [**2-22**] and brisk  Pertinent Results: [**2-12**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Known extra-axial right sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] lesion, likely meningioma,  similar in appearance to the prior study.
[**2-18**] MRI: IMPRESSION: Limited post-contrast MRI images obtained for surgical localization of an extra-axial mass consistent with left sphenoid plane meningioma.
[**2-18**] CT head: Right-sided pneumocephalus with a small subdural hemorrhage causing leftward shift of the normally midline structures by 4 mm.
[**2-18**]: MRI Brain: Limited post-contrast MRI images obtained for surgical localization of an extra-axial mass consistent with left sphenoid plane meningioma.
[**2105-2-20**] ECHO The TEE probe could not be passed into the esophagus due to mental status, agitation, and marked hypertension in the setting of stroke and recent craniotomy.
[**2105-2-20**] CTA head and Neck 1.
[**2105-2-21**] CT head Evolving right MCA infarct, with right frontotemporal post-surgical changes.
[**2105-2-22**] CT head IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes of right frontal craniotomy, with residual trace extra-axial hemorrhage and evolving right MCA infarct resulting in continued 8 mm leftward shift, subfalcine herniation, and minimally increased crowding of the basal cisterns.
[**3-2**]: Echo No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
On [**2-14**] her dilantin level was 15.9 and she was noted to have right frontal seziures.
She was scheduled to have a cerebral angiogram with embolization on [**2-17**] with subsequent OR on [**2-18**] for resection of her meningioma.
She underwent a diagnostic cerebral angiogram on [**2-17**] which revealed severe narrowing of the right ICA & ACA due to tumor compression.
ACA and MCA territories were being filled from the left ICA/posterior circulation.
On [**2-18**] replacement of the NG tube was again attempted but CXR confirmed cioling in the distal esophagus.
Post op head CT revealed no hemorrhage.
MRI brain was requested.
On [**2-20**], patient exam remained unchanged.
Neuro stroke requested CTA head and neck as well as a HA1C, lipid panel, blood cxs, and TEE.
Her steriods were weaned and EEG was placed.
On [**2-21**] she had a CT showing evolving infarct and mild worsening of her MLS.
Mannitol was started with NA and Osm checks and CT [**2-22**] showed no change in infarct or MLS.
She continued in the ICU with EEG leads on and her exam remained stable on [**2-23**].
EEG was showing breakthrough seizures on [**2-23**] and Keppra was increased.
By [**2-25**] no further seizures were noted and EEG was discontinued.
On [**3-2**], a trans esophogeal echo was done which did not reveal any vegitations.
LENIS were negative for DVT  [**3-4**]: Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 39798**] was hypertensive episodes  and received both hydralazine and lisinopril.
[**3-5**]: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 39798**] was febrile overnight and blood cultures sent off.
[**3-6**]: On exam she was slightly brighter with improved eye opening  [**3-7**] patient was trialed off of vent on trach mask for 8 hours, was accepted to vented rehab at [**Hospital1 **] with plan for discharge on 4.17  [**3-8**] patient was again trialed on trach mask with good results.
Following this she was discharged to rehab in the afternoon  Medications on Admission: Keppra 1 [**Hospital1 **], Decadron 4mg q6, Dilantin 400mg q8, protonix 40 daily, simvastatin 40mg daily  Discharge Medications: 1. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever/pain.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 mL IV Q8H:PRN line flush Peripheral line: Flush with 3 mL Normal Saline every 8 hours and PRN.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 mL IV Q8H:PRN line flush Peripheral line: Flush with 3 mL Normal Saline every 8 hours and PRN.
Temperature greater than 101.5F for 24 hours ??????
