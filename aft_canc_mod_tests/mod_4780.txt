In the ED, he was found to have a pH 6.94/83/329, and lactate of 14.6, and HCT of 19.7, INR of 3.7, PLTs of 47.
A bedside echo was done by cardiology which was apparently unremarkable.
He was given 1gm epinephrine boluses 7 times, 2 amps of sodium bicarbonate, and was started on a levophed gtt, dopamine gtt, neosynephrine gtt, and epinephrine gtt, and he was given 3L of NS, and 1 unit of blood hanging.
His last set of vitals 130/90 HR 80s 100% on vent 15, FIO2 100%, PEEP 5, Rate of 20. .
His initial vitals were BP 107/40, HR 60.
Given the patient's advanced age, lactate of 14.6, pH of 6.94, tenous blood pressures despite 4 pressors, the MICU team has decided to not escalate care and deem his code status as DNR/DNI as CPR is not indicated.
