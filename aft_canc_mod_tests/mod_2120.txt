She had temperature of 104 and was hypotensive.
Blood cultures were drawn and grew out Gram-negative rods.
Chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 46**] showed right pneumonia.
Later the blood cultures were to reveal Pseudomonas.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On the day of admission, her vital signs at [**Hospital1 46**] revealed temperature 104, blood pressure 84/32 on Neo-Synephrine, breathing 25, 100 percent on AC 700, 14.5, FIO2 100 percent.
On arrival at [**Hospital6 649**], her temperature was 98, her blood pressure was 70/59, went up to 93/68, heart rate 110 on Levophed, Neo- Synephrine and Vasopressin.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values at [**Hospital3 3583**] presentation:  white count 3, hematocrit 27, platelets 134.
Chem-7:  sodium 136, potassium 3.9, chloride 103, bicarb 20, anion gap 13, BUN 24, creatinine 2.8.
At [**Hospital1 **] on [**2156-8-7**], the patient's bicarb was 11 with an anion gap of 27.
Platelets were 64, INR was 6, with picture being compatible with DIC.
PTT was 72.5, albumin 2.5, ALT 1719, AST 3421, compatible with shock liver.
LDH 4350.
Her total bilirubin was 2.5, troponin 0.25, MB CK 467, MB 10, consistent with a non-ST elevation MI.
Her calcium was 5.9.
All her lines were removed and peripheral IVs were placed.
Cultures were drawn.
After sterile blood cultures, she had replacement of a central line.
HYPOTHERMIA:  The patient had a temperature of the low 90s.
The patient had also oozing of blood from her mouth and from her lines and from other sites during her stay secondary to DIC.
She was supported with FFP, platelet transfusions and red blood cell transfusions.
She had greater than 20 each of platelet and red blood cell transfusions during the course of her stay in the FI CU.
OTHER EVENTS:  The patient had an intracranial bleed, hyperintensity, small, on CAT scan done to evaluate the lack of interaction that the patient had with the outside throughout her hospital stay.
She had atrial fibrillation during her episode, most likely in the context of volume overload and pressors.
She dropped her blood pressure to the 80s, receiving boluses of fluid that brought it back up to the mid-90s.
The patient was sent for a pulmonary CT to rule out pulmonary embolus that showed diffuse patchy severe air-space disease consistent with ARDS, pus, blood or capillary leak, with an PA:FIO2 ratio of less than 200.
Blood cultures were drawn on that day which eventually grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two out of four bottles.
