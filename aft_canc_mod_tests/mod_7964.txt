MRI C spine showed mets to C5-C7 causing moderate compression of cord.
VBG showed 7.44/47/47 w lactate 1.0.  Review of prior admit suggested that she became altered almost nightly until rx with BiPAP which successfully treated her sx.
Also considered PE (although CTA neg) and tamponade (although echo not c/w hd sig tamponade).
Her last hemoglobin A1c was 6.0 in 05/[**2104**].
Her last pulmonary function tests were in [**2096**].

MRI Brain prelim: Multiple intracranial metastases, many of which are leptomeningeal.
[**8-9**] MRI C-spine w/o contrast: (PRELIM): Metastatic disease involving C5-C7 vertebral bodies with vertebral collapse and retropulsion and epidural component causing moderate compression  on the cord.
TTE [**8-11**]: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-6-17**], the pericardial effusion is smaller.

Her blood pressure remained in the 130/60-70s so the lisinopril was not restarted.
Her cough improved and she remained afebrile for the duration of her admission.
At discharge she was complaining of dysuria and frequency, but was unable to provide a urine sample.
