There is a large left hilar mass, better appreciated on prior CT study.
A CTA showed a lung mass but no clear infiltrate and was negative for PE.
ECGs initially were without ischemic changes and troponins were negative.
He had a thoracentesis which showed an exudate, cytology pending at time of transfer.
He initially required Levophed for blood pressure but was able to be weaned off on [**2177-11-16**].
His rate was better controlled on transfer but occasionally required additional Metoprolol for HR>120s.
An ECG showed some T wave inversions compared to admission his cardiac enzymes were negative.
He had an echocardiogram which showed moderate pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.There was possible but not confirmed pericarditis causing his symptoms and ECG findings.
He developed neutropenia with an ANC of 540 on the day of transfer.
He was transfused 2 units PRBCs over his course in the ICU for a hematocrit of 23.9 on [**2177-11-14**].
