Admission Date:  [**2117-11-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2117-11-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2069-9-17**]     Sex:  F  Service:  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Status post operation on [**2117-11-19**] consisting of pelvic examination under anesthesia, supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, evaluation of the left ureter to confirm left ureteral patency.
This evaluation consisted of evaluation of the position of the ureter within the pelvis relative to the hysterectomy ties followed by pelvic ureteral 3 mm ureterotomy with antegrade left ureterogram and cystogram.
This evaluation confirmed patency of the left ureter.
Final pathologic evaluation of the surgical specimens is pending at the time of this dictation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] underwent a supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and evaluation of her left ureter to confirm left ureteral patency on [**2117-11-19**].
During the surgery she received 2 units of packed red blood cells for transfusion and her postoperative hematocrit was approximately 35%.
Because her preoperative Dilantin level was very low at less then 0.6 her Dilantin the week prior to surgery was increased from 100 mg po b.i.d.
The left ureter had a 3 mm intentional ureterotomy, which had been oversewn after the antegrade cystogram with 4-0 vicryl.
Because of that abrupt increase in the JP drain output right after removal of the Foley the Foley catheter was placed back into the bladder and the serosanguinous drainage from the JP drain as well as the urine were both sent for creatinine values.
On two separate occasions the serosanguinous output from the JP drain had a creatinine of .4 consistent with peritoneal fluid.
In contrast the simultaneous urine creatinine was greater then 30.
It was therefore felt that the output from the JP drain represented physiologic serosanguinous fluid.
Her preoperative dose was 100 mg po b.i.d.
