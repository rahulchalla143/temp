The brush biopsy of the right renal lesion was suspicious for transitional cell carcinoma.
Blood pressure is 175/79 and heart rate is 73.
Rectal exam showed normal tone.
Pre-operative laboratory work showed a hematocrit of 39.7 and a stress test showed no reversible ischemia and ejection fraction was 66%.
Postoperatively he was moved to Intensive Care Unit for better management of the fluid status and his blood pressure.
His creatinine stabilized at level of 2.1 to 2.4 from his baseline of 1.6.
Renal consult was obtained and the decreasing renal function was felt to be due to the transient hypoperfusion during the operation when his blood pressure was dropped to low 100's for approximately an hour.
On the evening when he transferred to the floor, he experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid rate of around 160 times per minute and there were associated ischemic changes seen in the EKG.
He required several doses of IV Lopressor and IV Diltiazem to slow down his heart rate and convert it back to sinus rhythm.
A cardiac enzyme was sent and chest x-ray was also obtained.
His heart rhythm converted to sinus rhythm a few hours after the IV Diltiazem instillation.
His laboratory studies including CBC and electrolytes remained unchanged until the day of discharge.
His creatinine level is 2.4 on the day of discharge.
Operative blood loss 2.
