Echocardiogram prior to chemotherapy showed LVEF 65% and was otherwise unremarkable.
On [**7-15**], repeat BM showed ablation of bone marrow with fibrosis.
1) Admitted with spiking fevers to 102, chest x-ray showed left lobe infiltrate concerning for developing pneumonia.
2) [**7-11**] d10 of MEC, spiked to 102 with tachycardia, tachypnea, SBP ~90s, started on vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**] and aggressive IVF.

Bronchoscopy was performed and patient empirically started on Voriconazole pending BAL galactomanin results.
Cef was changed to aztreonam and [**Last Name (un) 2830**] during the course of his rash, which progressed on both antibiotics.
Eventually he was placed on cipro/tobra for GNR coverage; his E.Coli cx from [**7-11**] was resistant to cipro and intermediate to tobra.
Repeat chest x-ray was suspicious for pneumonia vs. leukemic infiltrate vs. pulmonary edema, so his abx coverage was broadened to vancomycin, cefepime and levofloxacin and he was also given lasix.
CT chest was done and showed ground glass opacity suspicious for infection vs. inflammation.
# Knee pain: He complained of right knee pain on admission, exam showed small effusion and did not show signs of infection.
Given expected thrombocytopenia with chemotherapy, and the need for urgent central line placement, warfarin was held and INR reversed with FFP and Vitamin k.  Repeat CT abdomen showed resolution of portal vein thrombosis, so coumadin was not restarted on discharge.

You were transferred to ICU for a short time for monitoring of your oxygen levels while you were on supplemental oxygen.
Your bone marrow biopsy in the middle of chemotherapy showed no signs of malignant cells.
You will need a repeat bone marrow biopsy soon as your cell counts are recovering.
Dermatologists saw you and biopsied your rash, which showed allergic reaction to medications.
Your CT scan of your lung was concerning for fungal infection.
We also stopped your lasix because your blood pressures were on the lower side and you do not have significant edema.
