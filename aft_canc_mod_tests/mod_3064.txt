Repeat scans showed increased activity within the tumor and within the right hilar and right paratracheal lymph nodes.
This was quite concerning given that the induction chemoradiotherapy did not eradicate lymphatic involvement and that it is progressing rapidly.
Vital signs revealed his temperature was 98.6, his heart rate was 100, his blood pressure was 130/80, his respiratory rate was 18, and 98 percent on room air.
Weight was 163 pounds.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the extraocular movements were intact.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a rate and rhythm.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 10.1, his hematocrit was 33.9, and his platelets were 218.
Sodium was 137, blood urea nitrogen was 11, and his creatinine was 1.1.
His albumin was 3.7.
His calcium was 9.6.
The patient had an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram which showed multiple areas of hypokinesis with tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular dilatation, and an ejection fraction of 40 percent.
Postoperatively, the patient remained hypotensive with a blood pressure of 94/62 on a Neo-Synephrine drip.
Postoperatively, cardiac enzymes were drawn and the CK/MB fraction was found to range from 3 to 5 postoperatively with a troponin of 0.06.
The patient had blood, urine, and sputum cultures sent.
The blood and urine cultures ultimately came back negative, but the sputum culture later grew out methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
On postoperative day two, the patient's chest tube was removed but he continued to require Neo-Synephrine to maintain his blood pressure at 99/57.
His pulse remained high at 109, and his hematocrit slowly drifted down from a preoperative value of 37.8 to 25.9 on postoperative day three; at which point the patient received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
He was able to come off the Neo-Synephrine, and his blood pressure was maintained at 137/70.
Chest physical therapy was continued, and the patient was begun on Lopressor for his tachycardia.
On the day of discharge, the patient continued to have rhonchi on the left with a productive cough; however, his oxygen saturations were good at 97 percent on 2 liters with a respiratory rate of 20.
