A possible left temporal AVM was noted on MRI at that time, and he was scheduled for a CT angio later this month.
He also sustained a ground-level fall, and his wife took him to an outside hospital where a head CT revealed an intraventricular hemorrhage which involved the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], 4th, 3rd, and left lateral ventricles.
A CT angio at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed the hemorrhage is stable, and left mesial temporal flow voids suggestive of AVM is noted as well.

Head CT([**10-3**]): Status post left-sided central ventricular drain placement with slight interval improvement in dilatation involving the frontal horns bilaterally, otherwise unchanged examination.
Followup CT is recommended if clinically warranted.
Head CT([**10-9**]): CONCLUSION: No evidence of new hemorrhage.
Decrease in the volume of intraventricular hemorrhage since the study of [**2192-10-6**].
Head CT ([**10-15**]): IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in intraventricular hemorrhage.
Head CT ([**10-15**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Intraventricular hemorrhage, unchanged from 5:09 p.m., but decreased in extent from [**2192-10-9**].
