Note that color Doppler analysis was limited overall as the patient had severe difficulty with breath holding.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
COMPARISON: Chest CT dated [**2124-10-12**] and chest radiograph dated [**2128-3-10**].
Wedge compression fracture of an upper/mid thoracic vertebral body, age indeterminate.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2124-10-13**] the rhythm is now A-V sequentially paced and the rate has slowed.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Her baseline creatinine is 3 with subsequent elevation to 6.3 with BUN 141 on admission.
Renal US showed elevated renal parenchymal pressure.
MRI was going to be performed to rule out renal vein thrombosis, but the patient had a pacemaker.
Renal consultants suggested transfer to the CCU with placement of a SG catheter to assess volume status and possibly initiation HD or UF.
Labs were significant for negative ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], urine eosinophils and normal complement levels.
Work-up for myeloma was performed as described below.
In addition, her hepatitis panel was negative, and PPD was 0 mm of induration for outpatient dialysis screening purposes.
She received vein mapping during hospitalization for potential future placement of fistula access on non-dominant left arm, which should be spared from blood draws, blood pressure measurements, or other procedures.
Her SPEP at [**Hospital1 882**] on [**2128-2-23**] showed IgG [**2019**], free Kappa 160.74 (H), Free K/L ratio 8.82 (H), M-spike concentration of 1.42 g/dL.
Urine showing Bence-[**Doctor Last Name **] protein and faint monoclonal free kappa.
Her last bone marrow biopsy was in [**2115**].
Heme/Onc followed patient in house and recommended above tests in addition to a skeletal survey, which suggested multiple punctate lucencies in the calvarium concerning for myelomatous deposits.
A bone marrow biopsy was discussed with the patient who refused as she wanted to discuss this procedure with her primary care doctor.
Her labs showed stable anemia, no hypercalcemia.
#  Non-ischemic chronic systolic and diastolic cardiomyopathy (Last EF 20 %): She did not appear to have an acute on chronic heart failure exacerbation on admission.
Her mild hypervolemia may be secondary to renal failure.
As above, she had a PA catheter placed in the CCU, with values of mean RA 26, v-waves to 50mmHg, RVSP/RVEDP ~50/14 and PA pressures 50/22 on entry; Mean wedge 19mmHg; PA pressures increased to 60/28 after the procedure.
TTE showed mild symmetric LVH,  moderately dilated LV with severe global hypokinesis, diastolic dysfunction, dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with severe tricuspid regurgitation and likely pulmonary artery hypertension with evidence of pressure/volume overload and mild aortic and moderate aortic regurgitation.
Iron and B12 studies were suggestive of iron deficiency for which oral iron with anti-constipation regimen was started.
Abdominal US on [**3-5**] at [**Hospital1 882**] showing cholelithiasis with two gallstones within gallbladder neck.
