MRI would be more sensitive for evaluation of early metastases   Brief Hospital Course: In the ED, initally BP was 80's, breifly, improved with IVFs.
BP remained in the mid 90's to mid 110's.
On vascular exam, a pulsatile abdominal mass was appreciated, which prompted a CT scan of the abd/pelvis.
The CT w/o contrast showed omental caking, mesenteric LAD, no obvious masses.
Pt subsequently had CT abd/pelvis with IV which raised suspicion of mass in the tail of the pancreas along with carcinomatosis.
An MRI/MRA of the abdomen was done the next day which also demonstarted a 1.5 X2.5 cm mass in the tail of the pancreas with omental caking and carcinomatosis.
Pt had an angiogram [**7-25**] with 50% L CIA stenosis, distal AT/PT and peroneal occlusions with no foot vessels patent.
Her WBC count raised from 14K tro 24K but she remained afebrile and HD stable.
Hem/onc consultation recommended obtaining a definitive tissue diagnosis and discussion was had about possible CT guided biopsy of omental caking.
On [**7-27**] in the evening PM labs showed elevated potassium to 6.4 (with hemolysis) and her SBP<80 around this time.
Pt was also treated for hyperkalemia and had aggressive IV fluids but had refractory hypotension requiring continues IV bolus to maintain her Blood pressure.
Her O2 Sats were 93% on 3L.
Patients blood pressure was maintained with IV fluid boluses and did not requiered pressors.
Patient came out to the floor and underwent a CT scan guided biopsy.
