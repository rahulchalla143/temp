At PCPs office pt had EKG showing sinus bradycardia, and subtle nonspecific ST depressions V1-V4.
He received ASA 325mg pta, NTGx1 with drop in blood pressure to 80mmHg, resolved with IVF with SBP rising to 100mmHg.
EKG showed ST depressions and TWI in V1-V2 but w/o prominent R waves; however posterior leads were placed with elevations in V5, V6.

Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated severe 3 vessel CAD.
Arterial conduit angiography revealed a diffusely atretic LIMA-LAD graft, which was sub-selectively engaged.
Venous conduit angiography revealed a patent SVG-D graft.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided filling pressures with an LVEDP 27mmHg.
Systemic arterial pressure was elevated with a measured central aortic pressure of 159/77/108.
Left ventriculography revealed preserved LV ejection fraction.
Successful PTCA and stenting of occluded OMB with a 2.25x18mm  Integrity bare metal stent.
Atretic LIMA-LAD, patent SVG-D, occluded SVG-RPDA.
Posterior STEMI 6.
ECHO [**2165-3-20**]: The left atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Diastolic function could not be assessed.
Trops improved, pt becamse CP free but will need further followup for CAD - PCI vs CABG in one month.
The high LVEDP on TTE is most likely a result of diastolic dysfunction [**2-21**] to ischemic cardiomyopathy which hopefully should improve with revasularization.
Your EKG and cardiac enzymes confirmed that you were having a heart attack.
Do not miss [**First Name (Titles) 691**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4319**] or stop taking plavix and aspirin unless Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] says that it is OK. You had an echocardiogram of your heart which showed that the overall function of the heart was still strong.
MEDICATION CHANGES: - START aspirin 325 mg daily and plavix 75 mg daily to prevent the stent from clotting off and causing another heart attack.
- START metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily to slow your heart rate and holp your heart recover from the heart attack.
- START lisinopril 5 mg daily to lower your blood pressure and help your heart recover from the heart attack.
