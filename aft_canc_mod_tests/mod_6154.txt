Troponin was 0.02.
CT Head was negative.
CT Chest showed acute on chronic bilateral PE.

Recommend CT or MRI to further evaluate as needed.
CTA Chest ([**2185-3-10**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
Small pericardial effusion, increased from the prior exam and small perihepatic ascites, also slightly increased from the prior exam.
CT Head ([**2185-3-10**]) - IMPRESSION: No parenchymal edema.
CXR ([**2185-3-11**] - FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased.
The changes are consequent of the left lower lobe pulmonary embolism documented on a CT from [**2185-3-10**].
CXR ([**2185-3-20**]) - FINDINGS: Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
Within the periphery of the left upper lobe, there is an apparently new focal area of opacity, possibly due to superimposition of structures at the level of the third anterior rib, but attention to this area on followup films is suggested to exclude a developing pneumonia.
CXR ([**2185-3-20**]) - FINDINGS: New endotracheal tube terminates 6.5 cm above the carina.
Otherwise, no relevant changes since recent study of less than one hour earlier.
CXR PA and Lat ([**2185-3-24**]) - IMPRESSION: Slightly increased effusions.
TTE with signs of mild right heart strain.
He was discharged on a lovenox bridge while his coumadin dose was adjusted to get him to his goal INR range of [**1-26**].
# COPD exacerbation: Patient became increasingly wheezy on exam during the first 1-2 days of this hospitalization and was started on treatment for a COPD exacerbation.
CXR showed ?retrocardiac opacity.
CTA also showed left adrenal nodularity with CT or MRI follow-up recommended.
# CHF: TTE with EF 40% and right heart strain.
BNP elevated but no prior levels for comparison.
Minimal edema on exam and no [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 22116**] elevation however CXR appearing more fluid overloaded than prior.
# Atrial Fibrilation: Patient had intermittent irregular tachycardias that on repeat EKGs were felt to be most likely atrial fibrillation (although at some points felt to be multifocal atrial tachycardia).
# Acute renal failure: Originally presented with Cr 1.3 vs baseline 1.0 likely pre-renal [**1-25**] poor PO intake, resumed to baseline with fluids.
EKG showed some lateral T wave flattening felt most likely [**1-25**] lead placement.
Cardiac enzymes flat.
# Leukocytosis: CLL with baseline WBC 25-30.
Medications on Admission: # ALBUTEROL SULFATE [PROAIR HFA] - 90 mcg HFA Aerosol Q4-6H # ATENOLOL-CHLORTHALIDONE - 50 mg-25 mg Tablet daily # SPIRIVA 18 mcg capsule INH daily # PULMICORT unknown dose # ACETAMINOPHEN   Discharge Medications: 1.
Coumadin dose should be adjusted accordingly with a goal INR of [**1-26**].
Enoxaparin 80 mg/0.8 mL Syringe Sig: Seventy (70) mg Subcutaneous Q12H (every 12 hours): INR should be checked every three days and coumadin dose should be adjusted to keep pt in goal INR range of [**1-26**].
Outpatient Lab Work The patient should have his INR measured every 3 days.
His goal INR is [**1-26**].
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Nursing Home - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis - Pulmonary Embolism - Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease - Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia  Secondary Diagnosis - Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane) On 2 L of oxygen   Discharge Instructions: You presented to the emergency department after you had an echocardiogram with some abnormal findings.
You were found to have a blood clot in your lungs, which was treated with blood thinners.
CHANGES TO YOUR MEDICATION: - CONTINUE your albuterol (ProAir), Spiriva, and Pulmicort - STOP atenolol-chlorthalidone - START chlorthalidone 25 mg daily - START prednisone taper as directed - START coumadin 4 mg daily.
You will have your INR monitored and your coumadin level adjusted to keep you at your goal INR of [**1-26**].
- START lovenox 70 mg twice a day while your INR is below your goal range of [**1-26**] - START metoprolol tartrate 100 mg every 8 hours - START diltiazem 30 mg every 6 hours - START aspirin 81 mg daily - START cefepime/vancomycin for 6 more days, to complete an 14-day course ending on [**2185-4-2**] - We are also STARTING you on nystatin to help with your mouth pain  As above, your rehab facility should monitor your INR level and adjust your coumadin dose to keep you at your goal INR of [**1-26**].
Because your INR was below your goal of 2 on your day of discharge, you are being discharged on lovenox until your INR is within your goal range.
You also have the following follow-up appointments:  Department: PULMONARY FUNCTION LAB When: THURSDAY [**2185-4-7**] at 2:10 PM With: PULMONARY FUNCTION LAB [**Telephone/Fax (1) 609**] Building: [**Hospital6 29**] [**Location (un) **] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: PFT When: THURSDAY [**2185-4-7**] at 2:30 PM  Department: MEDICAL SPECIALTIES When: THURSDAY [**2185-4-7**] at 2:30 PM With: DR.
