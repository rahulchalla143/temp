She responded to one shock with restoration of NSR, BP and SA02 - BP 100's/70's, SaO2 96-99% on oxygen.
An ABG showed no acidemia.
Her lactate was high - likely lactate B due to malignancy, which may have accounted for her acid-base status.
Her CXR showed no new findings, no pneumothorax, no widened mediastinum, no dilated heart.
Her cardiac enzymes where flat.
An echo was performed to look for an arrthymogenic metastasis; although it was a poor study, no wall-motion abnormalities suggestive of a metastasis where found.
A PE was thought to be unlikely as she would have to have had a massive PE with RV dysfunction (not seen on EKG) and would not have recovered so quickly or had normal O2 saturations.
She received serial EKG's showing initially prolonging QTc 438 (prior to arrest)-458 (at arrest)-468 (next day) which then decreased to 448 on day of discharge.
Based on these findings, it was thought that ARQ 171 most likely caused Torsades and cardiac arrest.
