Briefly, the patient was initially symptomic with back pain in [**2131-3-29**], at which point a workup discovered compression fractures in her spine, which led to further imaging workup on [**4-23**] by CT that disocvered a 2 cm hyperdense soft tissue mass in the right hilar lymph nodes as well as lytic lesions int he spine.
The patient also had an MRI of the brain that showed a R cerebellar lesion with necrosis.
Patient was started on Lovenox after a CTA on [**2131-5-4**] showed PEs.
CTA was done which showed multiple clots, right lower lobe infarct, possibly developing peripheral left upper lobe infarct, tumor invasion of the SVC, tumor invasion of the mediastinum, left lower rib fracture, indeterminate chronicity, right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis, right sided heart strain.
