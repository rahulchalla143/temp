MRI BRAIN ([**2147-6-16**]): New left cerebellar enhancing mass measuring 2.7 x 2.3 x 2.3 cm with surrounding vasogenic edema and effacement of the fourth ventricle concerning for metastasis.
CT HEAD ([**2147-6-17**]): Left cerebellar mass, as seen on recent MR, without evidence for hydrocephalus or herniation.
CT HEAS ([**2147-6-22**]):  No change from [**2147-6-17**] in left cerebellar lesion with surrounding vasogenic edema and mild mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
CT Head ([**2147-6-28**]): Mass in the left medial cerebellum with interval decrease in Preliminary Reportposterior fossa mass effect, associated vasogenic edema, and distortion of the Preliminary Reportfourth ventricle.
Patient subsequently had an MRI of the brain which showed a large cerebellar lesion which is presumed to be metastasis from his SCLC.
He was noted to have right-sided weakness so MRI was performed.
MRI revealed new cerebellar mass, likely metastasis from his SCLC.
Neurosurgery was consulted and he was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] ICU where follow-up head CT showed no herniation, worse edema or hydrocephalus.
Repeat CT head on [**6-28**] done to assess for edema showed some improvement in mass effect and edema so his dexamethasone was tapered to 4mg q6 hours.
Patient's neurologic exam has remained stable with slight dysmetria on finger-nose test.
MRI brain showed cerebellar met as above.
