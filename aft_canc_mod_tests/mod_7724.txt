She was placed on a NRB and vitals were 98.4 92 131/46 24 100% 10L nrb.
A CXR showed a mass in the apical portion of the left lung, concern for CA.
She was tachypneic and had a systolic BP >200.
At 4:45, she was sent for a CTA which revealed complete collapse of the LUL with a central hypodensity concerning for mass vs. necrosis.
On transfer, VS were 155/77, 88, 22, 99% vent.
Physical Exam: Admission Exam: Vitals: 97 110/68 80 22 100% intubated, CVP 4 General: Intubated and sedated HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MM dry, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated Lungs: Rhoncorous breath sounds throughout, breath sounds on left may be transmitted sounds.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2138-7-11**] 10:38 AM  IMPRESSION:  Near resolved edema.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2138-7-4**] at 10:23:49 AM  Impression: moderate pericardial effusion; no chamber collapse but this may be absent despite the presence of high intrapericardial pressures when severe pulmonary hypertension is also present; apical hypokinesis of the left ventricle, with apical ballooning of the right ventricle (consider Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with right ventricular as well as left ventricular manifestation)  Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2138-7-3**]  10:32:14 AM   Sinus rhythm.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 94 142 86 338/397 56 -21 92    Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 10687**] was a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with no known previous medical history who presented with progressive shortness of breath, cough, and general malaise for a month, intubated for respiratory distress, found to have LUL lung mass (carcinoid vs small cell) and likely post-obstructive pneumonia on imaging.
She underwent bronchoscopy on [**7-4**] at which time she was noted to have significant external compression of LUL bronchus, after which bronchus opened up again to friable tissue.
Cytologic brushings returned positive for neuroendocrine tumor cells, most consistent with carcinoid tumor, though could not definitively rule out small cell, particularly based on bronchoscopy visualization.
Her blood pressures were intermittently low and requiring norepinephrine for support intermittently, though hypotension presumably partially secondary to sedation.
TTE showed EF of 40-45% with apical hypokinesis, and she was noted to have some pulmonary edema and pleural effusions and was diuresed as tolerated by blood pressures.
She was intermittently diuresed as blood pressure tolerated to optimize respiratory status prior to extubation.
Patient required norepinephrine to maintain blood pressures on presentation and was weaned off within two days.
TTE showed EF 40-45% and apical hypokinesis with apical ballooning, potentially Takasubos cardiomyopathy.
