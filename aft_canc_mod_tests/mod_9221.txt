TECHNIQUE: T1 and T2-weighted images of the brain, with and without the administration of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 932**].
COMPARISON: Comparison was made to the prior CT scan performed approximately 4 hours earlier on the same day.
FINDINGS: Note is made of hyperintense intensity in the sulci of the bilateral frontal and parietal areas, consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage given the finding on prior CT scan.
IMPRESSION: 1) Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage within the sulci, as well as bilateral thin subdural hematoma, somewhat more prominent on the left.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report (Revised)  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2113-4-7**] 7:20 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: S/P FALL ?BLEED  [**Hospital 5**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 51 year old man with h/o left maxillary tumor resection now s/p fall with head trauma and suspected seizure REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ?
FINDINGS: Study is limited secondary to excessive motion artifact.
His SBP has been in the 90-100's.
Neurology and neurosurgery were consulted; both recommended starting seizure prophalaxis and an MRI scan.
CT showed a SAH, and the MRI showed L parietal contusion, evidence of subarchnoid blood seen on CT, as well as a small subdural hemorrhage bifrontally.
Repeat CT scans of the head were stable without evidence of hemmorhage progression.
In addition, do to the patient's poor nutritional status, the patient agreed to have a PEG placed for GTube feedings to supplement his poor po intake.
