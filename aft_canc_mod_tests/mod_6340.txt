Given that he had recently been admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for similar symptoms, the rehab staff was concerned that he had again experience a syncopal episode, and sent him to [**Hospital1 **] ED for further evaluation.
While at [**Hospital1 **], the patient was found to tachycardic to the 120's, afebrile, with a BP of 96/64.
A head CT was unremarkable.
EKG showed non specific lateral T wave changes, as well a troponin level of 0.26, however, upon arrival there, the patient denied having any symptoms of chest discomfort earlier in the day.
His tachycardia improved to the 90's after receiving 2L of IVF.
In arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals: T- 98.5, BP 115's/70's, HR 110's, O2 99% RA.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt remained afebrile, with stable BP (135-94), RR 18, O2 97% RA, upon transfer to the floor.
He underwent a work up which included a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed colitis involving the distal portion of the transverse colon, descending colon, and proximal sigmoid colon.
The patient also underwent an EGD that was unremarkable, Sigmoidoscopy which confirmed pseudomembranous colitis, and an upper GI study which showed dysmotility in the lower third of esophagus, but no evidence of stricture or mass.
Shortly after discharge, the patient returned to the ED after being found by EMS to have altered mental status, junctional bradycardia with HR 20-30's, and hypotension with systolic BP's in the 80's.
The patient was observed on the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service, underwent a TTE which showed a normal LVEF, mild MR but otherwise no significant valvular abnormalities, and no overall interval change from previous TTE in [**2126-12-19**].
Troponins during that admission were mildy elevated, but were determined to be secondary to demand ischemia, with flat CKs as well.
A renal biopsy on [**2127-7-23**] confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Stage 4B), and a pericardial biopsy on [**2127-7-25**] also was consistent with large B-cell lymphoma.

Unilateral Extremity Ultrasound (L leg): IMPRESSION: Occlusive DVT involving the left common femoral vein and superficial femoral vein in its proximal and mid portions.
CT Scan: [**3-16**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Scan: [**3-21**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Scan [**2127-4-1**]: 1.
The transverse, descending, and sigmoid colonic wall is also thickened, although to a lesser degree.
Dilation of the left femoral vein compared to the right raising concern for a thrombus within the left femoral vein and would recommend further evaluation with ultrasound.
Echo [**2127-3-27**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-3-10**], the heart rate is much lower.

Bili 0.5   Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o M with hx of DLBCL who presents with second syncopal episode in one week, with continued elevated troponins and unclear etiology of syncope.
Hospital course by problem list:  # RUL PNA: On admission, patient with symptoms cough and shortness of breath, and noted to have thickened sputum production at [**Hospital **] hospital with portable CXR concerning for pneumonia.
Repeat PA and lat CXR here did not show a pneumonia and the zosyn was stopped after two days because he did not clinically appear infected.
His syncope was thought to be either secondary to vaso-vagal syncope associated with BMs or orthostasis.
His BP was 60s/30s, responsive to IVFs, HR btw 70s and 120s.
EKG showed new T wave inversions.
CCU Course: Pt did not have any further episodes of syncope or arrhythmia while monitored on telemetry on the cardiology floor.
No EP study was performed since pt did not have any further episodes despite having several BMs on the floor.
He was later found to have lymphoma involvement of the heart based on CT scan, which was likely the cause of the syncope.
However, recent CT abdomen showed evidence of new liver lesion concerning for disease recurrence.
Had CT guided liver biopsy on [**2127-2-26**].
The biopsy was positive and on workup of other disease, was found to have involvement in his heart, chest wall and retropharyngeal space.
No discrete hepatic lesions noted on CT abdomen on [**3-21**].
Last stool sample on [**2127-2-20**] negative for [**Name (NI) **], pt has been on PO vanc for positive stool culture on [**2-12**].
When he became neutropenic, his diarrhea started to be more severe and he had abdominal cramping and a positive c.diff again on [**2127-3-12**].
Diarrhea has slowed down dramatically and C. difficile toxin assay was negative x3 on discharge.
Lovenox was held for liver biopsy and repeat B leni's showed no further DVT, so it was decided to not continue lovenox.
An ultrasound showed extensive clot in the subclavian and axillary veins.
He has had intermittent atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic stability, blood pressures in the 100s-110s systolic.
Surveillence blood cultures were drawn and were negative on [**2127-4-11**] and [**2127-4-12**].
TTE showed no evidence of endocarditis.
# Back pain- Patient complained of chronic backpain and had decreased rectal tone on exam so L-S MRI ordered but pt refused.
L-S plain films showed no evidence of fracture, no evidence of lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Pt should be monitored on telemetry for atrial fibrillation.
Pt should have CBC checked daily for the next 7-10 days or until stable.
Transfusion parameters are as follows: HCT< 25, transfuse 1 unit PRBCs HCT< 21, transfsue 2 untis PRBCs Platelets <50, transfuse 1 bag platlets, recheck in 1 hour This patient should have platlets maintained over 50 while on Lovenox.
His magnesium and potassium levels should be checked every day and given repletion on the follow scale: Mg < 2.0, give 2gm IV Magnesium Mg < 1.4, give 4gm IV Magnesium K < 4.0, give 40meq Potassium (PO or IV) K < 3.6, give 60meq Potassium (PO or IV) K < 3.2, give 80meq Potassium (PO or IV) 4.
Neupogen: The patient was started on Neupogen on [**2127-4-24**] in anticipation of WBC count dropping due to ESHAP.
His WBC was 9.1 with ANC of 8918 on [**2127-4-25**] (after 1 dose).
He should have his WBC and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) checked on [**2127-4-26**].
