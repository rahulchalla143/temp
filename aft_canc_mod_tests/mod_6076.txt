Lipase found to be 1100, admitted, made NPO, treated conservatively for presumed pancreatitis * 7 days ago, several episodes of bilious emesis that stopped 6 days ago; also had dizziness and syncope * over the past 3 days, has been febrile to Tmax of 103F * yesterday, asked Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to facilitate transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]; arrived in ED.
Eventually, he underwent a CT scan which showed a large splenic lesion concerning for bleed.
A repeat Hct showed a drop from 32.3 -> 27.2.
His oxygen requirements decreased slowly and eventually he was weaned off supplemental O2.
Serial CXRs were done to evaluate the left pleural effusion.
Because the patient went down to IR for an abdominal drainage procedure, they also performed a thoracocentesis, effectively draining 500 cc of straw colored fluid.
Post-procedure CXR shows a small loculated PTX and the CT was placed on wall suction.
Eventually his CT had little drainage, was placed on water seal and eventually discontinued.
He continues to maintain his saturation in the mid-90's on RA.
GI: After arriving to the ED, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with p.o.
and IV contrast showed a large hypodense mass within the spleen with blood tracking posterior to the spleen and into the pelvis.
His creatinine was stable.
The only positive blood culture was on [**2159-5-8**] 1/2 bottles for STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
Further blood cultures/surveillence cultures were negative.
Cultures intraop as well as from the abdominal drains grew out HAEMOPHILUS SPECIES NOT INFLUENZAE (HEAVY GROWTH, repeat culture shows sparse growth), [**Female First Name (un) **] ALBICANS (SPARSE GROWTH), and LACTOBACILLUS SPECIES (RARE GROWTH).
Urine culture showed no growth multiple times.
Because the drain outputs did not appear to increase after food, we surmised that the pancreatic fistula had healed to an extent, and we removed one of the JP drains.
