CTA showed a large mass in the right upper lobe abutting the pulmonary artery and compressing a bronchus leading to post obstructive collapse of the lower part of the RUL.

Surveillance blood culture 2.
Check stool Cdiff toxin 4.
If a second culture becomes positive would check TTE (echo) given splinter hemorrhages 5.
Treat for at least 14 days IV to cover bacteremia and post-obstructive pneumonia, which may need prolonged course depending on whether the RUL mass is shrinks with XRT.
**FINAL REPORT [**2142-11-9**]** CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2142-11-9**]): Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2142-11-9**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
Surveillance blood cultures on [**9-17**] & [**11-9**] are all negative to date  DISCHARGE LABS: [**2142-11-10**] 08:00AM BLOOD WBC-7.1 RBC-4.14* Hgb-12.7* Hct-36.2* MCV-88 MCH-30.7 MCHC-35.1* RDW-13.8 Plt Ct-141* [**2142-11-10**] 08:00AM BLOOD Glucose-91 UreaN-12 Creat-0.5 Na-139 K-4.4 Cl-99 HCO3-33* AnGap-11 [**2142-11-9**] 07:00AM BLOOD Calcium-8.5 Phos-3.5 Mg-2.1  Brief Hospital Course: 50 yo with progressive metastatic lung cancer, s/p recent whole brain XRT and left hip [**Hospital 39480**] transfered from [**Doctor Last Name 62565**] Hospital for interventional pulmonary evaluation of hemoptysis and fever/hypotension to MICU.
CTA showed a RUL mass abutting pulmonary artery with compression of bronchus and post-obstructive pneumonia.
Bronchoscopy [**11-5**] showed edematous RUL mucosa without a source of bleeding.
Blood cultures from OSH grew pan-sensitive Pseudomonas.
Abx were changed from levofloxacin/metronidazole to ampicillin/sulbactam/cipro and fnially to pip/tazo and cipro since [**11-6**] x14d course per ID recs, finishing [**2142-11-19**].
He will likely need a repeat bronchoscopy 4 weeks following completion of radiation therapy.
