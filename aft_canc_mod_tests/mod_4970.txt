MICRO: Blood cultures 5/14, [**4-8**], [**4-10**], [**4-15**] - negative Urine Culture [**4-8**], [**4-14**] - negative Sputum Culture [**4-8**] x 2 - negative .
CT HEAD: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or large vascular territorial infarction.
Chest CT is recommended.
Multilevel degenerative changes throughout the cervical and thoracic spine, with partial ankylosis of C3 to C5 with bulky anterior osteophytes.
Rounded T1 hyperintense, T2 hypointense lesion within T6 and T2 hypointense lesions within the right T7 (with posterior extension), may represent metastases.
Elevated creatinine levels precluded the use of gadolinium.
COMMENT: Please note that the present study contained imaging only as far distally as T9, as the patient was unable to continue the procedure at this time.
MRI HEAD:  Non-enhanced study with: 1.
Diffusely and uniformly T1-hypointense regional bone marrow signal, as on the recent MR examinations of the spine; this likely relates to the apparently known underlying myelodysplastic syndrome .
MRI Lumbar: Findings of concern for metastatic neoplastic disease involving the visualized lower thoracic and lumbar spine, with additional findings as noted above.
CXR [**2175-4-14**]: All these support lines and tubes have now been removed.
Cardiac size is at the upper limits of normal.
CXR [**2175-4-16**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the mid lobe opacity is unchanged.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
MRI r/o abcess (no contrast given creatinine of 2.7), but showed metastatic disease to the spine.
So far cultures have been negative including blood and urine.
CXR has been unchanged.
VS have been stable not suggesting SIRS.
Patient again spiked a fever to 101 after his bronchosopy, and was noted to be confused an mildly hypoxic to 91 on RA.
A CXR showed evidence of RLL infiltrate, so he was treated with 7 days of PO levofloxacin.
CT scan images from OSH were obtained and reviewed and nodules only seem to be amenable to open lung biopsy or CT-guided biopsy.
Repeat CT torso showed interval increase in the size of his lung nodules as well as interval increase in the size of a mediastinal lymph node.
MRI of the head without any metastasis.
A CT torso was performed, which was less suggestive of spinal metastasis.
A bone scan was performed which suggested widespread bony metastatic disease.
Creatinine trended down to his baseline.
alk phos at baseline (300s-400s last week).
He received neupogen twice with subsequent increases in his WBC count from 1.5 to 7.8.
Patient received PRBC to maintain a HCt of over 25.
Omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 **] 3.
Oxycodone 5-10mg q4 13.
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).
An MRI of your back did not show any signs of infection.
Further imaging with CT and bone scan showed lung nodules, and lesions in your bones suspicious for cancer.
A bronchoscopy was performed to take a biopsy of a lymph noed in your mediastinum (chest).
A CXR was suspicious for pneumonia, so you were treated with antibiotics.
Your lung lymph node biopsy is pending and your oncologist (cancer doctor) should follow up the results of this with you.
Appointment: Wednesday, [**4-19**], 9:30am  You have an appointment on [**2175-4-21**] at [**Location (un) 2274**]-[**Location (un) **] at 2:30 pm.
