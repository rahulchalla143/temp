The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
[**2112-10-17**] Portable AP CXR: Indwelling devices remain in standard position.
[**2112-10-18**] ABD/PELVIC CT W/O CONTRAST: 1.
Resolution of the retroperitoneal gas/fluid collections and no retroperitoneal abscess.
Diverticulosis 7.
The more superior fluid collection may have been present on the prior CT of the abdomen and pelvis.

These findings were verbally discussed at the time of the study with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
Tip of the catheter is not definitely visualized, repeat PA and lateral radiographs are recommended to assess position of the PICC.
The remainder of the examination is unchanged, with stable cardiomediastinal silhouette, right basal atelectasis and low lung volumes.

At the time of admission, ECG revealed afib with PACs successfully treated with Metoprolol 5mg IV Q6Hours PRN, which also controlled hypertension.
On [**2112-11-5**], the patient experienced [**11-5**] abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting,he was made NPO and tubefeeds were stopped, he was triggered for a sustained heart rate in 130s, an EKG revealed Afib with RVR.
He received 1 unit PRBCs for a HCT of 22 and IV fluid rescusitation with good effect.
A CTA Abdomen on [**2112-11-7**] demonstrated patent mesenteric vasculature without evidence of embolic filling defects, and extensive atherosclerotic disease is present, though without evidence of critical stenoses.
On [**2112-11-11**], the patient underwent ultrasound-guided puncture of left brachial artery, second-order catheterization of superior mesenteric artery, abdominal aortogram, selective superior mesenteric arteriogram showing 70-80% stenosis of SMA, and primary stenting of superior mesenteric artery for stenoses for chronic mesenteric ischemia, which went well without complication.
Early chest x-rays in late [**Month (only) **] revealed a moderate left effusion as well as a small right pleural effusion.
Over the hospital course, these resolved with later CXR only revealing changes consistent with atelectasis.
Abdminal/pelvic CT revealed portal venous gas and extensive small bowel pneumatosis features consistent with bowel ischemia.
The patient was emergently brought to the Operating Room, where he underwent exploratory laparotomy, which was negative, lysis of adhesions, right retroperitoneal drain removal, intra-abdominal drain placement, and subcutaneous drain placement (see Operative Note).
Initial BUN/Creatinine was 98/4.5, respectively.
At this time, separate continuous VAC dressing systems with black granufoam to a target pressure of 125mmHg were placed at both of these extensive I&D sites.
Peritoneal fluid culture revealed polymicrobial gut flora with gram negative rods and anaerobes.
Other cultures from the thigh and flank abscesses revealed only sparse growth of mixed bacterial types.
Vancomycin trough levels and renal functions were monitored closely during the admission, and IV Zosyn and Vancomycin dosages adjusted accordingly.
ENDOCRINE: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout his stay; sliding scale insulin was administered accordingly, particularly when the patient received TPN.
HEMATOLOGY: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely.
By discharge, his hematocrit was greater than 31.
