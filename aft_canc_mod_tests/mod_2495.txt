The bleeding scan there revealed bleeding of the hepatic flexure making this largely a large bowel bleed.
An angiogram was performed which revealed no bleeding and, therefore, he had no embolization.
The patient had a sigmoidoscopy with no sources localized.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON TRANSFER TO THE MEDICAL FLOOR: Vital signs:  Temperature 98.4, heart rate 78, blood pressure 150/80, respiratory rate 20, saturating 93 on 2 liters.
LABORATORY DATA ON TRANSFER TO THE MEDICAL FLOOR:  White count 6.6, hematocrit 25.2, platelets 139,000.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  A consultation with the GI Service was obtained and given that there was no bleeding seen on angiography their recommendations were to proceed with colonoscopy.
This was done and the colonoscopy revealed multiple diverticuli but no evidence of active GI bleed.
We, therefore, obtained an upper GI, small bowel follow through which was completely unremarkable.
His hematocrit in the meantime has stabilized even though he required a couple of additional units of packed red blood cells.
His 02 saturations on 2 liters was 93 and 94% and without oxygen would drop to 90-91.
Upon ambulation, however, his sats dropped to 84 and, therefore, the patient is being discharged on home oxygen.
Of note, platelets dropped from a baseline of about 350 to 115 upon admission and then to as low as 99.
