CT scan of chest/abdomen/pelvis in [**12-16**] showed severe emphysema and a left upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
Repeat Ct scans in [**7-17**] revealed a large abdominal mass in the head of the pancreas measuring 4.4x5.6 cm.
PET scan in [**8-16**] showed abnormal uptake in both the lung nodule and abdominal mass.A biopsy was attempted via EUS but pathology c/w necrosis and glandular cells only.
Patient was scheduled for a CT guided biopsy for next week, however, she was seen today at the clinic clinic by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and found to be jaundiced with lab work significant for a T.Bil of 7.

Per ERCP note, a large infiltrating mass was discovered in the wall of the duodenum and the ampulla could not be reached for evaluation of the biliary tree.
IMPRESSION: Single fluoroscopic spot image showing degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine, residual oral contrast, and atelectatic lung bases.
Further ERCP images were not completed due to obstruction by a duodenal mass.
[**2183-10-19**] Chest CTA:FINDINGS: Comparison to a prior CT torso dated [**2183-10-14**] and initial CT from another institution dated [**2182-4-19**].
The left upper lobe 10 x 6 mm solid lesion has enlarged since initial imaging dated [**2182-4-19**], but is stable since [**2183-8-4**].
Compression fractures of T8 and T11, extensive bridging osteophytosis and kyphosis at the level of T8 are unchanged since a CT dated [**2183-1-1**].
The study is not tailored for evaluation of the upper abdomen, only to confirm a large porta hepatis low-attenuation lesion, new left-sided biliary pigtail catheter without pneumobilia, new small volume ascites in the left subphrenic space (400B, image 33), uniformly thickened adrenal glands stable since [**2183-10-14**], stable left renal pelvis dilatation and a mild sliding hiatus hernia.
[**2183-10-21**] Head CT without contrast: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction.
[**2183-10-21**] Portable Chest: AP chest compared to [**10-21**] and chest CTA [**2183-10-19**]: Emphysema is severe.
[**2183-10-26**] Portable CXR for NGT Placement: NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
[**2183-10-26**] Portable Abdomen: Comparison is made with prior study performed five hours earlier.
Patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.
The peel-away sheath was removed and the retainingballoon was inflated with 7 cc of saline mixed with small amount of contrast.
IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided placement of a 16-French MIC gastrojejunostomy tube with the tip of the jejunostomy port terminating distal to the ligament of Treitz.
The catheter needs to be changed every three months and a followup arrangement will be made.
CT could be used to further evaluate  [**2183-11-4**]: T bili 0.9, AST/ALT 22/28, ALP 194.
[**2183-11-5**]: WBC 12.2, Hb 10.8, HCT 36.8, PLT 501, Na 143, K 4.9, Cl 105, CO2 35, BUN 18, creat 0.5, glucose 99, Ca 8.5.
Repeat biopsy of the abdominal mass was done at time of ERCP on [**2183-10-14**] and results returned [**2183-10-15**] showed poorly differentiated carcinoma most consistent with colonic primary site.
# Obstructive jaundice: Pt underwent an attempted ERCP [**2183-10-14**] for decompression but cannulation of the ampulla was unseccessgul due to tumor mass.
A CTA was negative for PE, but showed marked emphysema.
A head CT without contrast was negative for an acute process.
ABG showed marked hypercarbia.
Radiation oncology consult was obtained to consider several fractions of radiation to the duodenal tumor mass in an effort to slow her blood loss.
Plain film of the abdomen revealed multiple air fluid levels consistant with a small bowel obstruction and thought to be secondary to the patient's known tumor mass.
Late on the evening of [**2183-10-31**], the patient developed abdominal distension and right upper quadrant pain, a repeat abdominal film again showed multiple air fluid levels consistant with small bowel obstruction despite little output from when the patient's venting G tube was placed to suction.
Her symptoms improved, but repeat KUB showed worsening SBO.
Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate 4 mg/mL Solution Sig: One (1) mL Injection Q12H (every 12 hours).
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for Nausea.

Biopsy of the tumor revealed recurrent metastatic colon cancer.
