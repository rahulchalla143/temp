He had a recent stress test, in which he exercised for 4 minutes and 6 seconds on a standard [**Doctor First Name **] protocol to a heart rate of 124, achieving peak MET of 3.8.
He presented to [**Hospital3 7571**]with VS: P117, BP 115/67, O2 sat 98%.
EKG showed ST elevations in leads I, AVL, V4-V6.
Ck was 81, trop I was 1.05 (0-0.09).
HCT was 27.7.
Hemodynamics were significant for PCW of 37, CI of 2.06, and PA sat of 38%, which improved to 87% after initiation of balloon pump.
Past Medical History: - COPD (on no inhalers) - HTN - dyslipidemia - CAD s/p LAD DES in [**2132**] for NSTEMI and midLAD and RPDA BMS in   [**3-/2138**] for STEMI.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: VS: T 97.5, BP 100/58, HR 96, RR 18, O2 100% on NRB, Gen: Middle aged male in NAD, resp or otherwise.

Resting hemodynamic measurment demonstrated elevated filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 37 mmHG and mean RA of 19 mmHG.
The mean PAP was elevated at 42 mmHG.
Final angiography demonstrated  improved flow throughout the left anterior descending artery along with restoration of flow to the distal RCA via the a large collateral from the LAD (See PTCA comments).
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2138-8-18**] at 12:22:47 PM      FINAL  The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-3-19**], the anterior septal and anterior wall akinesis and apical dyskinesis are new.

# CAD s/p STEMI: Cardiac catheterization demonstrated restenosis in one of the LAD stents and mechanistically placing another stent would obviate possible CABG.
Cardiac enzymes peaked with a CK of 209 and trop of 6.91.
A beta blocker and ace inhibitor were initiated once blood pressure stabilized.
A post catheterization ECHO showed a LVEF of 25% to 30% with moderate hypokinesis of the mid inferior, inferolateral and apical segments.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR on Monday [**2138-8-25**].
Warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] will follow your coumadin level and decide on the dose.

New medicines: Lisinopril- this medication is for your blood pressure and to help protect your heart after a heart attack.
The goal INR is [**2-2**].
