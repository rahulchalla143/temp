She was tranferred to an outside hospital where a head CT was performed with demonstrated a right parietooccipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with 17mm shift leftward subfalcine herniation and right-sided uncal herniation.

CT HEAD [**2146-10-24**] A large focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the right occipital and parietal lobes is redemonstrated.
The included paranasal sinuses are notable for retained secretions seen in the sphenoid sinus, new from the comparison study.
On exam pupils were asymetric, though slighlty reactive; brain stem reflexes were preserved; she moved her left side less than right.
Exam was notable for left sided visual field deficit on confrontation, pronator drift on the left, and an inability for eyes to cross midline to the left.
On [**10-24**] she was noted to again be somnolent, difficult to arouse, her dexamethasone was re-increased, a head CT was re-checked which showed no increased or new bleeding.
Her current exam can be found in the physical exam section of this document.
Repeat blood cultures were obtained and had no growth by the time of discharge.
