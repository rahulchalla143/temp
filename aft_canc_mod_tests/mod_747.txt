EGD biopsy of submucosal duodenal mass: nondiagnostic  CT-guided bx: nondiagnostic, blood only  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 19314**] is a 76 year-old female with metastatic breast cancer treated with Femara and Megace, with known duodenal and liver masses, who presented with abdominal pain/bloating, and CT showed increased size of duodenal mass with hemorrhagic appearance.
EGD was undertaken to perform biopsy of the submucosal duodenal mass, which was nondiagnostic.
We then performed CT-guided biopsy of the mass, the result of which was pending when the patient was discharged but has since returned nondiagnostic and blood only.
Ms. [**Known lastname 19323**] hematocrit was stable throughout her hospital stay.
She was found to have increasing edema and shortness of breath responsive to lasix with oxygen saturations in the low 90s on room air.
Towards the end of her stay her subjective dyspnea did not correlate to any decrease in oxygen saturation and her ambulatory sat was consistently 94%.
Urine culture was pending at the time of discharge but has since returned consistent with contamination.
