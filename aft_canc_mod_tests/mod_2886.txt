CXR showed bilateral infiltrates with left effusion and wbcc of 23.
Sputum cx showed rare normal flora and yeast, repeat stain showed rare gram positive rods.
On [**11-11**] after intubation and sedation w/propofol, bp had to be supported with neo, abx zosyn and vanomycin were added with steroids.

Lymph node biopsy from the OSH was read as polyclonal T cell proliferation consistent with reactive lymphadenopathy.
He underwent bronchoscopy 3 times, which showed no infection, cytology negative.
Bacterial, AFB cultures negative, stain for PCP and AFB were also negative.
He had CT scan of his abdomen, chest, and pelvis, which showed diffuse lymphadenopathy but of only modestly enlarged size and not typical of lymphoma, chest wall hypodensities of unknown etiology, abdominal wall hypodensities c/w hematoma, and a small right adrenal hyperdensity.
Echocardiogram showed increased pulmonary artery pressure and a lesion in the PA that was confirmed by CT.  PA-gram was done to rule out an evolving PE; it was negative.
Cardiac output as determined by mixed venous O2 saturation was found to be adequate, suggesting his hypotension was due more to distributive physiology than cardiogenic shock, despite his obvious right sided failure due to pulmonary artery hypertension.
Lymphadenopathy:  biopsy from [**2126-10-21**] at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital showed reactive nodes of polyclonal T cell morphology.
RPR was nonreactive, HIV negative, HTLV pending.
