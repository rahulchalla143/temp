Usual exercise tolerance is approximately 100 meters; now he is only able to walk 50 meters.
Reports weight is approximately 140 pounds, only 1 to 2 pound weight gain over his normal dry weight.
CHF with an EF of 30 percent to 40 percent from echocardiogram in [**2102**] and 1 plus AR.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 92.3 degrees p.o., 93.5 degrees axillary, on repeat 94.8 degrees axillary; blood pressure 130/80, heart rate 50, respirations 16; saturation 87 percent on room air, 98 percent on 2 liters.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values significant for a hematocrit of 31.3, a creatinine of 3.6, and an INR of 3.5.
Coumadin was given for an INR goal of 2.5 to 3.5, though he was supratherapeutic on admission and it was initially held.
On [**2104-6-29**], the patient was found by the ninth floor to be in rapid atrial tachycardia with a heart rate of 120s, initially thought to be atrial fibrillation.
The patient also had a 6/10 chest pain, which was nonradiating and was reported to be different from his anginal pain.
The patient's blood pressure was 90/60.
His blood pressure decreased to systolic 80s and high 70s.
The patient was without chest pain until his transfer to the CCU when he did experience chest pain, which was nonradiating with any minimal exertion.
On transfer, this was able to be weaned off and the chest pain was thought to be related to the patient's fast rate.
His INR was maintained at 2.5 to 3.5, though he was supratherapeutic at one time.
The patient's creatinine hovered around the 3s during his entire admission.
The patient's INR was supratherapeutic during much of his admission.
A CT without contrast showed a rectus sheath hematoma and this was thought to be the site of the patient's blood loss.
The area was monitored and the patient's hematocrit remained stable for the rest of his hospital course and on discharge was 31.7, which was his baseline.
