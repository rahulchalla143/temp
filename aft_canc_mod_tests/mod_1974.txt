Due to her h/o nephrolithiasis, a CT urogram was done on [**8-11**] which showed non-obstructing stones and a bulky heterogenous uterus consistent with fibroids.
Pelvic ultrasound on [**10-16**] showed a large complex vascular left adnexal mass.
GYN HISTORY: Last Pap smear and mammogram were both recently normal.
Bimanual and rectovaginal examination revealed that the cervix was small and displaced anteriorly.
Bimanual examination revealed that the mass seemed to be contiguous with the mass in the left upper quadrant.

Chest X-ray [**11-6**]: COMPARISON: [**2177-10-28**].
CTA Chest [**11-6**]: REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    R/o PE IMPRESSION: 1.
Pelvic mass, biopsy (A-G):  Poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with papillary serous carcinoma.
Pelvic tumor, resection (C-G):  Papillary serous carcinoma.
Cecum (AJ-AK):  No malignancy identified.
Abdominal wall (AV-AX):  Papillary serous carcinoma.
She had an exploratory laparotomy, SCH/BSO, small bowel resection and re-anastimosis, and sigmoid rection with colostomy.
A CTA was performed which showed a right upper lobe PE.
She was given Coumadin 5 mg PO QHS and her INR was monitored daily.
INR was supra-therapeutic at 4.7 on [**11-12**].
Coumadin was held that night, and INR was 3.7 on [**11-13**].
Since she was stable for discharge at that time, she was discharged home with plans to have her INR monitored by [**Month/Year (2) 269**] and her Coumadin adjusted by her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
*) Blood loss anemia: Her starting hct was 33, and EBL was 1000cc.
She received 1 U PRBC intra-op and another 2 U PRBC on [**11-7**].
Her hct was stable at 26-27 for many days prior to discharge.
Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia and her cardiac enzymes were cycled for 3 sets and found to be normal.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw INR every morning and report results to patient's primary Care: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 35275**]  - Office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 35276**]  - Pager [**Telephone/Fax (1) 35277**] (#[**Numeric Identifier 35278**])  - Cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 35279**] 4.
You will need your INR checked every day and your Coumadin dose will be adjusted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 35275**].
