His urine legionella was neative so the levofloxacin was discontinued.
His fever, tachycardia and elevated WBC count resolved.
He was not able to produce a sputum sample so he was continued on vanc/zosyn for a planned 7 day course, started [**4-30**], completed [**5-6**].
The patient had repeat AP and Lat CXR to evaluate for pna, which showed LLL pna, but this is consistent with prior known pna and felt to likely represent no new process.
After a video swallow study he was started on nectar thick liquids and full solids.
#Anemia: He presented with a hematocrit >40 but decreased to 32.9.
Hemolysis labs were negative and his stools were guaiac negative.
His HCT stayed stable around 33 and was felt to be likely related to draws from his PICC not being adequately flushed and phlebotomy.
#[**Last Name (un) **]: His creatinine was 0.6 on admission then increased to 1.5. Review of prior records showed that his baseline is actually closer to 0.9.
His Cr trended to 1.1 at time of discharge.
