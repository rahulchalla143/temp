Cross-sectional imaging suggested invasion of the left atrium making her T4 and stage III-B.
She was deemed inoperable based on the imaging at an outside institution.
We reevaluated her with cardiac MR imaging and felt that if the tumor was confined to the atrium and did not involve the ventricle or the mitral annulus that we could consider a high- risk resection with left atrial reconstruction.
Past Medical History: HTN, ^chol, SCC lung carcinoma, s/p mediastinoscopy ([**Hospital1 112**])  Pertinent Results: ECHO [**2174-6-3**] IMPRESSION: Large extracardiac mass invading through the left atrial wall with possible involvement of the basal inferolateral left ventricle.
CXR [**2174-6-8**] CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: Comparison is made to five days earlier.
The following surgical procedure was performed: Bronchoscopy, Exploratory sternotomy with biopsy of anterior  mediastinal lymph node, drainage of pleural and pericardial effusions and subtotal pericardiectomy.
Her oxygen requirement decreased but ambukatory saturations were 87% and therefore she was maintained on 2 liters nasal prongs at time of discharge.
