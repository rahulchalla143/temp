ATRIAL FIBRILLATION/CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE With this shortness of breath and a.fib, and concern for his cardiac well-being and hemodynamic stability, he was admitted on the [**2187-6-27**].
Cardiac enzymes were negative and TSH and T4 were within normal limits.
He was transferred from the ED to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU on the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] for rate control and cardiac monitoring.
He got an echocardiogram; in summary it showed global wall motion abnormality and reduced ejection fraction of 30-35%.
He remained short of breath and had an 02 sat of 98% on 4L.
His heart rates remained above 100 at this time.
He was also given lasix as aggressively as his often-low blood pressures would tolerate.
His rates and his clinical well-being both improved with this.
Because his pressures were often low we began holding diuresis during this same period, d/c'ing the standing furosemide and following ins and outs and daily weights with a goal of running approximately even.
Chest x-rays showed steady improvement in pulmonary edema.
His thyroid function tests were normal and we detected no clear signs of ongoing infection.
As his cell counts rose, we increased his hydroxyurea dose to 500 mg daily from an every other day schedule, and his white blood cell count declined accordingly; he was discharged on this regimen, and instructed to follow up further as an outpatient.
LOCULATED EFFUSION X-ray and CT showed a loculated effusion on the right with fluid extending into the major fissure.
It shrunk on CXR over the course of the admission.
