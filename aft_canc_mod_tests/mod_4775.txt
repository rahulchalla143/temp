For confirmation of stent positioning, a repeat limited CT of the upper abdomen immediately following the administration of water soluble oral contrast could be considered.
Swallow study confirms that the previously described fluid- and gas-containing collection in the center of this mass communicates with the esophagus and stomach.
Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and large liver masses redemonstrated.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 52-year-old gentleman with newly diagnosed metastatic esophageal CA who presented from home with a hematocrit drop of 10 points over the last 6 days.
On admission, hct was at its nadir of 16.8 likely in the setting of a slow bleed from his GI tract.
Stool was weakly guiac positive which made a brisk bleed unlikely.
He received a total of 9 units of pRBCs until his hematocrit stabilized in the low to mid 30s.
EGD and CT abdomen were both consistent with a large, necrotic mass that was metastatic to the liver.
An ultrasound showed evidence of thrombus and the PICC was removed.
