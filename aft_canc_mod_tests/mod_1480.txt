She was admitted for presurgery catheterization which showed elevated pulmonary artery pressures.
She was subsequently transferred to the CCU for Swan-Ganz monitoring, diuresis to decrease PA pressures prior to MVR surgery.
Echocardiogram at that time revealed mild to moderate mitral stenosis, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with good left ventricular function.
Stress test with nuclear imaging showed mild to moderate reversible anterolateral perfusion defects.
Catheterization in [**2189-9-13**] showed increase PA pressures.
The patient was admitted today for a mitral valve replacement, preoperative catheterization which demonstrated severely elevated PA pressures, with an elevated PA systolic of 115 and wedge of 39 to 40; decreased mitral valve area to 0.8.
Swan was placed with a RA pressure of 6, PA pressure systolic 89 and diastolic 38.
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25.
[**2192-9-12**] echo shows 3+ mitral regurgitation; severe pulmonary hypertension; mean gradient of 22, peak 38; MV area of 1.1 cm squared; ejection fraction of 60% with left ventricular hypertrophy.
Potassium chloride equivalent of supplements 10 meq p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Heart rate of 73; blood pressure of 119/56; 99% on two liters nasal cannula.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  JVP about 5 cm above the costal margin.
Carotids 2+ with no bruits.
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count of 10.4; hematocrit of 38.9; platelets 317.
Sodium of 145; potassium of 3.2; chloride 109; bicarbonate 23; BUN 17; creatinine 0.7; glucose 99; ALT 16; AST 19; alkaline phosphatase 107.
Arterial blood gases prior to oxygen was 7.44/36/51.
Amylase was 44.
Total bilirubin was 1.0.
Electrocardiogram on [**2192-12-26**] shows normal sinus rhythm.
Catheterization from [**2193-1-31**], final report:  Right atrium 9; RV 114/13; [**MD Number(3) 32836**]/45 with a mean PAP of 68.
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 32.
Cardiac output of 4.0.
Cardiac index of 1.9.
SBR of 20 and 20.
Coronary catheterization otherwise was with clean coronaries except for obtuse marginal one which showed 20% mid vessel stenosis but otherwise, no evidence of thrombosis in the coronary arteries.
Echocardiogram:  ([**2192-9-17**])  Normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 50%; left ventricular hypertrophy; severe calcified mitral stenosis with gradient of 22; MHEA area of 1.1 cm squared.
Estimated PA systolic of 80.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 62 year old female with extensive tobacco history and rheumatic heart disease with severe mitral stenosis, valve area of 0.8 and 3 to 4+ mitral regurgitation.
Elevated filling pressures of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 35 with a PA mean of 70.
The patient had minimal to no coronary artery disease on catheterization on [**1-31**] prior to admission.
She was started on a trial of Lasix and Nipride with a goal PA systolic of 60 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure goal of 15.
Ultimately, her pulmonary artery pressures were less than 60 and her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure did decrease to below 15.
Her creatinine bumped to 1.5.
twice a day and her urine output was continued to be monitored.
On transfer to the [**Hospital1 **] for out of the unit, the patient remained having high oxygen saturations of 98 to 99% on six liters nasal cannula and her oxygen can continue to be weaned down as an outpatient.
She has maintained good oxygen saturations and her arterial blood gases were improved prior to transfer from the floor.
She has maintained good oxygen saturations and her arterial blood gases were improved prior to transfer from the floor.
Other gastrointestinal issues included a routine abdominal ultrasound that was performed for preoperative evaluation prior to her mitral valve replacement to rule out liver disease.
On this incidental ultrasound, two liver lesions were seen, which was questionable for a malignancy versus hemangioma.
A magnetic resonance scan was recommended for further evaluation of this.
The magnetic resonance scan showed two focal lesions in the liver, 30 by 25 by 25 mm and one that was 10 mm that was consistent with hemangiomas.
Renal:  On abdominal ultrasound, as mentioned above, there was a further magnetic resonance scan of the abdomen to further work-up questionable liver mass found on abdominal ultrasound.
She will most likely need a nephrectomy, partial versus total, as well as an outpatient flexible cystoscopy.
and should be monitored with Coumadin levels and INR checks as an outpatient.
The patient's hematocrit also remained stable in the low 30's and she should continue to monitor her hematocrit as an outpatient.
A repeat urinalysis on [**2-11**] did not show any signs of active infection with no leukoesterase, 0 to 2 white cells and a negative urine culture.
Blood cultures also did not show any growth to date related to those temperature spikes.
However, a sputum culture did grow out 25 polymorphonucleocytes and appeared thick, yellow and purulent.
A respiratory culture still has shown no growth to date.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was maintained on a low sodium diet and was continued to monitor daily weights and input and output.
Hold for systolic blood pressure of less than 90.
Phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 277**] of urology within one month of discharge to further evaluate the left kidney mass and decide on further treatment options.
