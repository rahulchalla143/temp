Mild cardiomegaly, signs of mild fluid overload.
CXR ([**8-28**]): Severe cardiomegaly and enlarged main and left pulmonary arteries are unchanged.
CXR ([**8-29**]): A single lead right chest wall pacemaker is seen with the tip terminating in the right ventricle.
A small nodular opacity in the left upper lung on correlation with chest CT dated [**2191-7-25**] represents lung nodule and in view of history is concerning for metastasis.
CXR ([**8-29**]): Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and hugely dilated main and left pulmonary arteries are longstanding.
The extent and nature of bibasilar consolidative abnormalities are better displayed by the concurrent chest CTA reported separately showing left lower lobe atelectasis and a large right lower lobe pneumonia.
Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead is in standard placement.
ECHO ([**8-30**]): The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Evaluation of another known nodule in the right lower lobe which was limited due to right lower lobe consolidation.
Primary oncologist was notified and further work-up and treatment options were deferred to outpatient.
However head imaging should be completed prior to starting warfarin to rule out mets to brain .
Urine and blood cultures are pending on discharge.
# Acute Renal Failure: Pt had Cr to 1.3, which was in setting of diuresis.
Follow up culture data with microbiology [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4645**] 3.
Recheck electrolytes in 1 week and redose medications accordingly 4.
Obtain head imaging prior to starting coumadin 5.
A bronchoscopy was completed which showed a mass in your airway and thus you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
You were also started on an anticoagulant to help prevent blood clots.
