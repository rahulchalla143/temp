In [**2143-3-12**], he was noted to have a PAC/PRA ratio of 776 (aldosterone 46, renin <0.06); a transtubular K gradient was 8.36 at that time.
He also has undergone imaging which showed a 13mm myolipoma in the right adrenal in [**2140**] and [**2142**], but no adenoma.
At that time it appears he underwent a secondary hypertension work-up with a PAC/PRA of 80 (16/0.2), VNA 1.7, serum metanephrine and normetanephrine of 282 and 608 respectively.
He was subsequently followed by CT surgery with serial CT scans.
His initial post-op showed a 17 mm myolipoma in the right adrenal gland and a type B dissection extending from SCL to internal/external iliacs.
Subsequent scans on [**2143-11-28**], [**2143-12-25**], [**2144-3-25**], [**2144-4-15**] have shown no change in the appearance of the right adrenal mass but have shown new left renal and left renal wedge infarcts.
His most recent scan shows a stable lipoma (-70 houndsfield units).

CN II-XII intact Strength: [**4-14**] upper and lower bilaterally Sensation: decreased sensation to light touch in R lateral thigh and foot, but pinprick intact bilaterally  Pertinent Results: Imaging: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2144-4-13**]): FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or vascular territorial infarction.
CXR PORTABLE ([**2144-4-13**]): IMPRESSION: Stable cardiomegaly and prominence of the aortic arch, unchanged compared to prior study of [**2143-11-27**].
Although there is no change in the mediastinal contours, complications related to prior aortic dissection and repair cannot be excluded and a CT of the chest should be obtained if there is clinical concern for such complications.
[**4-15**] CT ABD: CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a right adrenal lesion measuring 1.8 cm x 1.7 cm, which is predominantly fatty in attenuation, with internal Hounsfield units of approximately -70 [**Doctor Last Name **].
# Malignant hypertension: He presented with a systolic blood pressure in excess of 200 with accompanying lethargy.
This was switched to oral labetalol, HCTZ-triamterene, clonidine patch, lisinopril, and hydralazine; meds were than adjusted to target a systolic blood pressure of 130-150, which has been recommended by the vascular surgery service.
He has achieved target blood pressure on this regimen, with stable electrolytes for the last two days.
If BP meds are to be readjusted, consideration could be given to decreasing the frequency of the labetalol from tid to [**Hospital1 **] dosing to simplify his regimen.
Aldosterone and renin levels were sent, although the utility of these tests is questionable given that he was on spironolactone at the time the labs were drawn.
He will continue on eplerenone for the time being, and will follow-up in endocrine clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] in early [**Month (only) **].
# Type B aortic dissection: On CT scan, there was evidence of aortic dissection, with dissection flap extending into the left renal artery, and probable areas of left renal infarct.
Vascular service deferred surgical intervention, and felt that blood pressure control with target SBP 130-150 was the preferred treatment.
