On arrival to the emergency room her VS were T 99.5 BP 103/46, HR 84, 97% on RA (with no episodes of hypoxia).
However, her BP dropped several times to the 80s which is well below her baseline and she received close to 6L of IVFs while there as well as central line placement, though never on pressors.
