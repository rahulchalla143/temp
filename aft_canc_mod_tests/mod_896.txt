Blood pressure was 75-85 systolic.
A chest x-ray showed increased pleural effusion.
The patient denied fever, chest pain, orthopnea (sleeps on one pillow), and peripheral edema.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history revealed atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion on Sotalol, last echocardiogram in 1/00 showed an ejection fraction greater than 55% and normal systolic function; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an FEV1/FVC of 68%; atrial septal defect status post repair in [**2155**]; and small cell carcinoma status post radiation and Cisplatin.
A transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2158-11-25**] showed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, mild right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension.
A MIBI in [**2159-11-26**] showed mild partial reversible defect in the vascular portion of the inferior wall.
She was afebrile with blood pressure of 112/90, pulse 84, saturation 91% on 4 liters nasal cannula and 80% on room air.
On head and neck examination, the fundi showed sharp discs.
The chest showed coarse breath sounds bilaterally with wheezing and crackles bibasilarly.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 11, hematocrit 35, platelets 277,000, MCV 97.
Differential revealed neutrophils 40, bands 43, lymphocytes 6, metamyelocytes 5, occasional Dohle bodies.
SMA-7 showed sodium 129, potassium 4.9, chloride 94, bicarbonate 28, BUN 34, creatinine 2.8, glucose 122, CK 46.
EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at 84-86.
Axis was 90.
Troponin was less than 0.03.
INR was 4.3, PTT 44.
Laboratory workup was also concerning for acute renal failure and hyponatremia.
Cardiovascular:  Electrocardiogram was concerning for anterior subendocardial ischemia; however this was unchanged from previously.
The final [**Location (un) 1131**] on the EKG showed worsening T wave inversions in leads III and aVF.
An outpatient stress test was not recommended because of her clinical presentation.
The patient received pulse dose of steroids with Solu-Medrol 80 mg intravenously t.i.d.
Rule out pulmonary embolus:  The PE test probability for pulmonary embolus was low to moderate given her risk factors.
LENIs were checked on hospital day #2 and were negative for clots.
She was already in part anticoagulated for her atrial fibrillation and she came in with an INR of 4.5.
A FENA was checked and this was 0.1% which concurred with prerenal failure.
Urine electrolytes were checked and revealed a FENA of 0.1%.
Cortisol was sent and was falsely elevated due to her already being on steroids.
The cortisol level was 53.
Urine osmolalities and urine electrolytes were also checked and free water was restricted.
TSH was normal.
All blood cultures remained negative and urine cultures as well.
Followup bands obtained in the hospital revealed a band level of 8 on admission and then 0 on hospital day #2.
