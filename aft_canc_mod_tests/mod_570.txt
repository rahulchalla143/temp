GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
See Conclusions for post-bypass data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of medications).
Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Regional and global left ventricular systolic function are normal.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Interpretation assigned to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 168**], MD, Interpreting physician         Brief Hospital Course: He was admitted to cardiology.

His [**Month/Day (4) 4532**] was dc'd and he was started on heparin.
Bladder scan post void showed 1 liter residual and foley was reinserted.
