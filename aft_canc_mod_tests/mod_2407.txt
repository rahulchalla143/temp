Re-exploration of liver transplant with washout liver biopsy and Vicryl mesh closure of abdominal wall [**12-2**] 1.
Peripancreatic and pancreatic debridement, evacuation of hematoma and temporary abdominal closure.
She was taken back to the operating room for a Vicryl mesh closure of the abdomen and liverbiopsy that demonstrated some mild central lobular necrosis.
She underwent followup Doppler ultrasound that demonstrated patent vessels to the liver and, because she required a portal vein jump graft to the SMV to re-establish portal vein inflow, we placed her on heparin after she completed her abdominal closure.
She underwent endoscopy that demonstrated some blood and old blood in the stomach but no active bleeding or ulcer.
Based upon our concern that the diverticulum may, in fact, have been a small ulcer, she underwent a CT scan of the abdomen which demonstrated a contrast extravasation and periduodenal air.
Heart rate is regular without rub, murmur, or gallop.
Pertinent Results: Ct Scan 1/5/6 1) Extraluminal hyperdense material in the right upper quadrant posteriorly (superior peripancreatic and inferolateral peripancreatic) area most likely due to extraluminal oral contrast from proximal small bowel or duodenum.
