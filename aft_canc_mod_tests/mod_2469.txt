The diagnosis was originally made by CT scan in [**2188-9-25**].
CT scan revealed a 6-cm right renal mass without any evidence of adenopathy.
A metastatic workup was subsequently performed revealing a questionable pulmonary nodule.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Past surgical history included rotator cuff surgery, osteotomies of both feet, abdominoplasty with mesh hernia repair in [**2185**], two repairs for stress incontinence performed in [**2164**] after a partial hysterectomy; and, again, a revision in [**2174**].
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 28 and 0.8, respectively.
Alkaline phosphatase was 9.3.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  CT scan of the chest revealed three small nodules in the right, one in the left.
Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 6.1-cm mass anterior to the right kidney, possible multilocular cystic kidney.
Bone scan and brain scan were without evidence of metastatic disease.
In the Postanesthesia Care Unit, the patient had several apneic episodes and arterial blood gas had a pH of 7.24.
Her arterial blood gas had improved, and reflected both good gas exchange and oxygenation.
