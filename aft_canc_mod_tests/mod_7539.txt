They felt it appropriate to take Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the OR where the subdural bleed was drained; subsequent pathology demonstrated clotted blood.
He was kept in the neurosurgical ICU for two days where he did well with no post-operative complications and was then sent back to the bone marrow unit for further care.
Per the neurosurgery team, his goal for platelets was around 50 for three weeks; at the time of discharge, he will require an additional week of platelets at this level, usually achievable by giving two bags of platelets each morning, checking a post transfusion count 30-60 minutes thereafter.
He will follow-up with his hematologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**], for his AML in one week and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**], a neurosurgeon, in two weeks (he will get a repeat CT scan at that time).
His WBC at [**Hospital1 18**] ranged between 12 and 28, generally around 14.
His goal hematocrit was over 25, and he generally required one unit of packed RBC's every three to four days.
He was also covered with a routine regular insulin sliding scale for excessively high values (usually starting at 2 units of regular insulin for a glucose of 150-200, and going up by two units of insulin for every 50mg/dl of blood glucose increase).
His blood and urine cultures were negative.
Clinically and radiographically, his most likely source was pulmonary, although the chest x-ray did not demonstrate an obvious pneumonia.
