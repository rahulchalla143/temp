She stateed that she was prescribed several pills by her kidney doctor, but this morning the "white pill" did not help.
While there, the patient was noted to be in ARF with Cr of 2.5.
She was also noted to have leukocytosis with WBC of 11.9 and 82% PMNs.
CT abdomen was performed and was notable for ascites and diffuse nodular changes in peritoneal cavity and on omentum suggesting carcinomatosis.
Left kideny had 1.5 mm lower pole and 5.5 exophytic cyst as well as 1mm nonobtracting calculus.
CT of lungs was significant for collapsed left lung with left chest cavity filled with fluid, significant compression and collapse of the right lower lobe with large right pleural effusion.
She was also noted to be hypotensive with BP of 80/50 after CT scan and was bolused with fluids.
The patient was started on Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam for presumed sepsis and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
In the emergency department, initial vitals were HR 67 BP 79/60 RR 23 and O2 sat: 97% on 3L NC.
15 minutes later BP decreased further to SBP of 68 and Levophed was given.
Troponins 0.04 x 1.
On transfer, vitals were T98.0 HR 72 BP 101/68 RR 30 93% 3L.

[**2117-10-3**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with CAD s/p CABG in [**2096**] and [**Hospital 41538**] transfered from [**Hospital1 **] for hypotension, renal failure and cancer work-up found to have metastatic cancer likely primary ovarian.
Pericardial effusion was unlikely given low voltage EKG and no JVD, no effusion on CT chest.
Furthermore, TTE was performed which showed no pericardial effusion.
IVF boluses were given as necessary to keep blood pressure up, however excessive IV boluses were avoided in order to prevent reaccumulation of fluid.
Blood cultures from [**Hospital1 18**] as well as [**Hospital1 **] were negative.
CT of the chest was performed and revealed large left pleural effusion, with near complete collapse and consolidation of the left lung.
At the time of transfer from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient's respiratory status had improved and she was breathing comfortably and satting >95% on 3-4L NC.
On the floor the chest tube drainage decreased and the chest tube was removed.
Repeat xray showed no interval worsening of the pleural effusions and patient remained stable saturing at >95% on 2-3L of oxygen by NC.
* Oliguric renal failure: On admission, the patient was noted to have Creatinine of 2.9, with bland sediment and minimal urine output.
There was no evidence of hydronephrosis or vascular impairment on CT. Urine lytes were consistent with a pre-renal cause of ARF.
IV fluids and pressors were given as needed to keep MAP > 65.
CT scan performed here confirmed carcinomatosis and also revealed an ill-defined lesion within the left lower pelvis, in the expected location of the uterus and adnexa, with calcifications.
An US of patient's right upper extremity showed a clot in the superficial basilic vein (unlikely to account for these symptoms).
A literature search was done and it was found that approximately 2.7% of individuals with ovarian cancer develop cutaneous manifestations, which can include Raynauds.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**11-27**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed for nasal dryness.
A chest tube was used to drain the fluid from your lungs and was removed after a few days.
We did an ultrasound of your arm that showed a small clot in a superficial vein, this is very unlikely to be the cause of your symptoms.
Should you develop shortness of breath we recommend that you contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4149**] to discuss following up with the lung doctors about [**Name5 (PTitle) 20483**] a chest radiograph and perhaps a more permanent catheter.
