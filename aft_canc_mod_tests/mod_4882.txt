She was taken to [**Hospital6 **] where a CT head showed a R frontal mass with midline shift.
An MRI head showed Poorly enhancing 48 x 43 x 49 cm mass in the right frontal be with associated mass effect and subfalcine and right uncal herniation and extension of parenchymal edema into the right temporal lobe.

Pertinent Results: CT CHEST, ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [**2173-5-19**] 1.
Functional MRI [**2173-5-20**]: IMPRESSION: Functional MRI of the brain, demonstrating the expected activation areas during the movement of the hands, feet, and tongue with activation areas adjacent to the mass lesion during the movement of the tongue.
CT head Post-Op Post right frontotemporal craniotomy and right frontotemporal lesion resection with post-surgical changes in the vicinity.
MRI Abdomen 1.
MRI Brain 1.
Anterior-inferior margin of the resection site demonstrates a region of slow diffusion, new from the pre-operative study and not accounted for by the marginal hemorrhage seen on susceptibility sequence; this is concerning for post-surgical cytotoxic edema in the adjacent parenchyma.
Head CT revealed a R frontal lesion and patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical evaluation.
A CT torso was done which showed low-attenuation lesion with thin rim calcification seen in the greater omentum and subcapsular region of segment VI liver and fibroid in the uterus, no other metastasis.
MRI head showed a poorly enhancing 4.8x4.3x4.9 R frontal mass with mass effect.
She had a WAND study on [**5-23**].
Her exam remained intact.
A post-op Head CT showed expected post-operative changes.
on [**5-26**] She underwent MRi scan which showed expected post-operative changes as well and she was transferred to the floor.
She also underwent MRI of her Liver for workup of liver lesion.
