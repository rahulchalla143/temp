The initial plan had been to have IR replace the nephrostomy tube tonight, however when her labs returned this was put off.
Her labs were notable for a white count of 33.7, Na of 114, K of 6.4, lactate of 3.8, and a BUN of 35.
Her EKG was NSR at 97bpm, no peaked T-waves or PR prolongation, poor R wave progression.
A repeat K after treatment was 5.4 and her sodium was 116.
VS on transfer were: 106, 104/74, 10, 100% on RA.
CT demonstrated "marked abnormal distention of the endometrial cavity measuring up to 6.5 cm" which was filled with high-density fluid.
- [**2102-12-11**]: Endometrial biopsy demonstrated adenocarcinoma, endometroid type, grade I.
- [**2103-1-17**]: CA-125 elevated at 113 - [**2103-1-23**]: Went to the operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**] for a planned hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and staging procedure for presumed endometrial adenocarcinoma.
Intraoperatively, she  underwent rigid proctoscopy which showed no evidence of intralumenal tumor.
Peritoneal washings were negative for malignant cells.
Surprisingly, the pathology from this operation  revealed the primary source of her cancer to actually be the appendix with a 1.5 cm histologic grade II primary lesion invading through the muscularis propria and into the subserosa/mesoappendix (pT3).
PET CT confirmed FDG-avidity of multiple peritoneal/pelvic implants and several liver masses.
- [**2-/2104**]: Underwent evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12982**] at [**Hospital1 336**] for hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).

#) Hyponatremia: Etiology not completely clear based on her urine lytes or serum osms, likely has a component of hypovolemic hyponatremic, while on exam she appeared total body volume up, her JVD was flat and her MM dry.
Her urine lytes show a low urine sodium and high osms, consistent with hypovolemic hyponatremia, however she does not appear as sodium avid on labs as one would expect, this could be due to a degree of [**Last Name (un) **] as her Cr is up to 0.8 from her baseline of 0.2-0.3.
#) Hyperkalemia: potassium was 6.4 on admission with no EKG changes, improved to 5.4 after calcium gluconate, insulin and D50, possibly related to worsening renal function.
Patient was monitored on telemetry and did not develop any arrhythmias.
Does have right basilar opacity, but chest x-ray appears largely unchanged from [**8-30**].
Urine and blood cultures had no growth to date.
#) [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr up to 0.8 from 0.2 to 0.3 as a recent baseline, given her hypovolemia on exam was likely pre-renal, however may also be partially due to an obstructive picture given dislodged urostomy tube on the right and the left is not draining.
