On review of systems, the patient denied recent fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, N/V/D, constipation, abdominal pain, BRBPR, hematuria, dysuria, arthralgias, or myalgias.
A V/Q scan was performed, as was a CT of the torso.
MRI showed cerebellar and pituitary lesions, which were felt to be metastasis from her breast primary.
Repeat MRI on [**2113-3-13**] showed substantial but incomplete regression of cerebellar and pituitary metastases with leptomeningeal enhancement.
Metastatic breast cancer first diagnosed in [**2101**] status post R mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation, auto [**Year (4 digits) 500**] marrow transplant in [**2104**], metastatic to [**Last Name (LF) 500**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], liver, and lungs.
Status post TRAM flap 4.
Back: No spinal or CVA tenderness, no Grey-[**Doctor Last Name **] sign bilaterally Extremities: Trace pitting edema of LE bilaterally, 2+ radial, DP and PT pulses b/l.

V/Q scan [**2113-4-5**]: Matched abnormalities at the right lung base are compatible with the chest X-ray findings.
CXR [**2113-4-5**]: 1.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2113-4-10**]: 1) No evidence of functional bowel obstruction or perforation.
Echo [**2113-4-10**]: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
RUQ US [**2113-4-11**]: No evidence for cholecystitis, or intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
CXR [**2113-4-12**]: Unchanged appearance of the chest with extensive predominantly basilar opacities with probable bilateral pleural effusions.
In addition, the patient was hypoxemic with oxygen sats to 89% on room air.
A V/Q scan was performed and was indeterminate.
CT of the torso showed progression of metastatic disease in liver, RP, and abdomen.
She was given 2 units pRBCs for HCT 20.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
At 9pm, patient noted to have SBP 60-80's.
She was given 2 L IVF (NS) boluses and sent to MICU for further care.
MICU course ([**4-10**] - [**4-11**]): Blood cultures 4/17 and [**4-10**] returned + for G+ cocci (6/6 bottles).
Urine culture with mixed flora.
When the cultures returned with G+ cocci Zosyn was discontinued.
CXR did not show new infiltrate.
CT abd/pelvis were done and did not confirm obstruction.
