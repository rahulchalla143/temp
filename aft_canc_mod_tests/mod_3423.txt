Zosyn and Levaquin were stopped and she was continued on Vancomycin for 2 weeks since sputum cultures grew MRSA.
Her oxygen saturations improved with antibiotics and agressive diuresis.
All imaging studies, including CT scan abdomen/pelvis, were negative for acute pathology that could explain her symptoms.
Lactate was normal and guiac negative suggestive of mesenteric ischemia being unlikely.
GI was consulted and they recommended a repeat CT abdomen/pelvis which was unchanged.
No further imaging or studies were recommended.
Her INR on the day of discharge was 1.5  5)Hypertension: Patient presented with SBP in 200's on admission but quickly returned to baseline.
Her electrolytes were wnl and her B12 and folate were also normal.
She received XRT in [**Month (only) 404**] and was supposed to undergo a repeat MRI of her C-spine.
Further work-up will be deferred to as an outpatient.
She will likely need MRI c-spine as an outpatient at [**Hospital1 2025**].
