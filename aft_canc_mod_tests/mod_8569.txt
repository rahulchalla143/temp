In addition, a PFT was performed in [**Month (only) **] [**2141**] disclosing FEV1 of 133% of predicted and a diffusion capacity of 82% of predicted.
The mediastinoscopy was negative for carcinoma.
Osteoarthritis 11.
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.

By [**6-14**], the patient had rate stabilized at around 110-120 and her pressures was around 109/47.
The patient remained within the target aPTT and PTT ranges and so therapy continued.
The patient was informed and agreed to the mandatory scheduled INR checks in the coumadin clinics.
Outpatient Lab Work [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) **]--please check INR twice a week.
Goal INR is between 2 and 3.
