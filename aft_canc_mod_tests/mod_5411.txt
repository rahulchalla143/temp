Admission Date:  [**2114-11-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-11-19**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: fall, convulsions  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation and mechanical ventilation EEG lumbar puncture attempted  History of Present Illness: 82 year-old right-handed woman with a history of prior stroke and dementia who presented with alteration in consciousness.
As this persisted, her daughters took her to an OSH for evaluation this morning.
She was found to have a temperature of 99.6F and initial BP was 161/60mmHg.
Labs were notable for an INR 2.5, and were otherwise normal except for BUN of 29.
She underwent CT of the head which revealed small right subdural hematoma (8 to 9mm).
Funduscopic exam was technically limited as pt resisted eye opening, but revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
Corneal reflex and nasal tickle present bilaterally.
Gag reflex intact.

[**11-8**]:  CT head without contrast: A cavum septum pellucidum et vergae is present and is a normal variant.
IMPRESSION: This study is unchanged from previous.
[**11-5**]: PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The ET tube tip is positioned within the mid to lower trachea, approximately 2 cm above the carina.
EEG [**11-6**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of frequent epileptiform sharp and slow wave discharges seen over the left parietal temporal aregion and due to right temporal sharp and slow wave discharges seen independently and less frequently.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
[**11-12**] Cspine CT with contrast: 0.9 x 0.7 cm left extradural mass with displacement and mild indentation on the cord at C2-3 level.
[**11-13**] Cspine CT without contrast: Small extradural mass at the level of the C2-3 vertebrae.
[**11-14**] Chest/Abdomen/Pelvic CT: 1.
These sharp waves were frequent on the left side early in the recording.
Brief Hospital Course: 82yo woman with a history of stroke and dementia who presented with alteration in consciousness, exam notable for severe encephalopathy, intact brainstem reflexes, and bilateral lower extremity hyperreflexia with clonus.
While the fever is unlikely secondary to a meningitis, lumbar puncture was unsuccessful and so she was treated empirically with ampicillin, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone for a fourteen day course.
EEG was performed and showed bilateral frequent epileptiform sharp and slow wave discharges over the left parietal temporal region and right temporal region (less commonly), but no seizures.
She had a repeat head CT, which was stable.
An EEG was obtained, which was abnormal.
The right sided weakness could be explained by the old left MCA stroke; however, her left side was weak as well.
A cervical spine CT was obtained, which showed a calcified mass at C2/C3 thought likely to be due to a hematoma.
A repeat EEG was  2)  CV:  Her blood pressure medications were titrated to maintain normal BPs.
On a CXR on [**11-14**] because of some symptoms of respiratory distress, there were concerns that there was a pericardial effusion; therefore, an echo was obtained which was showed no pericardial effusion and good EF.
Patient had low grade temperatures and CXR was hazy; therefore, Flagyl was started for possible aspiration pneumonia.
Her Ampicillin, Vancomycin, and Ceftriaxone were dicontinued on [**11-16**].
As part of their recommendations, a torso CT was obtained, which was negative.
