The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography recently, but a stent was unable to be placed.
A computed tomography was performed which demonstrated a head of the pancreas mass with dilated intrahepatic duct along with vascular involvement of the gastroduodenal artery and superior mesenteric vein.
He presented for exploratory laparotomy with possible pancreatic mass resection.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  His hematocrit was 43.2.
His INR was 1.2.
Creatinine was 1.6.
Aspartate aminotransferase was 51, his alanine-aminotransferase was 89, his alkaline phosphatase was 395, and his total bilirubin was 12.5.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission, the patient was taken to the operating room where an exploratory laparotomy was performed.
Adhesiolysis was therefore performed along with a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, and open cholecystectomy, an open pancreatic biopsy, and a gastrojejunostomy.
The patient's hematocrit was stable at 35.8 at this time.
A computed tomography scan was performed on postoperative day ten which did not demonstrate any intra-abdominal pathology.
A fever workup was done including a chest x-ray and blood cultures.
However, a postmortem examination was declined.
