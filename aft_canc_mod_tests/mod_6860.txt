Repeat radiography with PA and left lateral projections is recommended for further evaluation.
[**2198-5-7**] CT Head with & without contrast: 1.
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal and axial T1, and axial T2, FLAIR, gradient echo, and diffusion-weighted imaging was performed through the brain.
Axial T1 and multiplanar MP-RAGE imaging was repeated following the administration of intravenous gadolinium contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Slight T1 hyperintensity in the left base on pre-contrast imaging is also unchanged, and again this demonstrates no enhancement.
CNS lymphoma appears to be relatively controlled and CT/MR scan does not show progressive disease.
Meningitis was ruled out by negative lumbar pucnture.
EEG showed some sharp activities in the left frontal lobe of the EEG, leading to an increase in Keppra 1000 mg IV TID.
Repeat urinalysis, urine culture, and blood culture were negative to date.
Plastics was consulted and aside from the patient's antibiotics she was initially on for UTI, she was treated with right hand elevation on [**12-26**] pillows at all times and a splint, which was ultimately discontinued due to slight decrease in perfusion of her extremity and weak pulse.
MRI did not show any recurrence.
We followed albumin levels which improved but seemed to plateau around 2.1.
Poor Urine Output:  Initially the patient had decreased UOP with slightly elevated creatinine, however, this improved and was adequate for the last few days before [**Date Range **].
We transfused 2 units of platelets throughout her admission to maintain Plts > 20.
On [**2198-5-8**] her HCT was 30, then during her admission it stabilized around 27, with occasional nadirs to 25.
Her platelet count was greater than 200 on [**Date Range **], and HIT antibody was negative.
