Increased mass effect with compression of the adjacent right lateral ventricle with leftward shift has increased since prior study (MRI [**2102-10-2**]).
CT head [**2102-11-23**]: Technically limited study by patient motion, with no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Echocardiogram [**2102-11-21**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler or rest saline injection.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
CXR [**2102-11-17**]: (upon admission):  Interval increase in the degree of the bilateral consolidations within the upper lobes and appearance of new consolidation in the right mid-lung concerning for progression of the pneumonia.
CXR [**2102-11-22**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase of the pre-existing opacities at the left lung base.
Motion artifacts, decreased image quality.
[**2102-11-27**] CT Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis: CT THORAX: The patient is intubated with the endotracheal tube lying approximately 20 mm above the carina.
CT PELVIS: Rectal temperature probe noted within the rectum.
Some high-attenuation material is noted in the right lateral wall of the bladder (series 2, image 118), most likely representing intravesical hemorrhage from catheterization.
CT PELVIS: Rectal temperature probe noted within the rectum.
Some high-attenuation material is noted in the right lateral wall of the bladder (series 2, image 118), most likely representing intravesical hemorrhage from catheterization.
CT OSSEOUS SKELETON: No osseous destructive lesion.
[**2102-11-30**] CXR: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the nasogastric tube extends to the distal antrum.

(1) PEA Arrest [**2102-11-23**]:  Flail chest resulted from CPR, pt continues to occasionally complain of pleuritic left sided chest pain.
His Beta-Glucan was overwhelmingly positive at 500, which was very suggestive of PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 15255**], physical and CT and CXR findings were also very suggestive of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], no definitive diagnosis could be made at the time of admission.
The patient's respiratory status remained tenuous during the first 5 days of his admission, but then it began to improve with his treatment and he is currently on NC 4L with an oxygen saturation of 100%.
Very shortly after extubation, patient had a witnessed aspiration of vomitus with initial ABG showing hypoxemia pH 7.49 pCO2 37 pO2 74 HCO3 29 but with improved O2Sat with face mask and repeat ABG shows pH 7.51 pCO2 39 pO2 91 HCO3 32.
(3) Delirium:  The patient had an episode of delirium on [**2102-11-22**] that resolved the following morning.
(4) Subsegmental Pulmonary Embolism:  [**Hospital1 18**] radiology says clot is stable (initially found to have a subsegmental PE on CTA done to rule out causes of hypoxia).
Hematocrit started to trend down, but remains stable on day of discharge.
C. difficile toxin tests were negative 3 times.
Gene probe amplification was negative for TB so was taken off of respiratory precautions.
TB culture from negative from state laboratory.
His sodium remained stable with free water restriction.
TTP and DIC labs were negative.
Platelet count 112 at time of discharge.
Bactrim was not discontinued and rash now significantly improved, likely secondary to artic sun cooling, it began after use of the cooling pads and has since resolved with no changes in medications.
Improving, not significantly noticable on exam currently.
He is improving, but not significantly noticable on examination currently.
You a lung infection on chest xray and were treated with anitbiotics.
You also had a MRI of your brain and the preliminary report showed that the tumor is unchanged, but it is more dense.
