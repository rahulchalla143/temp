IMAGING: CXR ([**2155-10-3**]) Subtle nodules in the left mid and right lower lung, for which non-emergent CT may be obtained to further assess.
CXR [**2155-10-8**]: Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has not recurred.
His blood pressures remained stable during his stay in the ICU and he did not require pressors at any time.
His BP averaged around 120/60 upon transfer to the oncologic service.
Viral cultures were sent which were negative.
He was started in empiric Vancomycin and Zosyn in the ICU and surveillance cultures were sent.
These antibiotics were continued on the OMED service until admission blood cultures grew out E. coli, pansensitive except to cipro.
Repeat CXR was neg for pneumonia.
RUQ u/s was neg for biliary pathology (originally a concern due to stent).
He was discharged when his ANC was over 500.
A panorex film was obtained.
# Anemia: Patients hematocrit was noted to be down from 33.5 to 27.6.
Hemolysis labs did not reveal evidence of hemolysis.
His Hct stabilized after the transfusion and no further intervention was required.
# CXR nodules: Patient was noted to have nodules on CXR.
The patient may require a CT of the chest for further work up.
His BP stabilized in the ICU and he became hypertensive again on the OMED floor, so he was restarted on his beta blocker, though started metoprolol instead of atenolol in the setting of renal failure.
Your white blood cell count was also low, which is a side effect of your chemotherapy.
You were given antibiotics and your white blood cell count came up on its own.
