HIV, last CD4 count [**2109-9-25**], was 151 with a viral load     of 423.
Echocardiogram in [**2-6**], showed some mitral regurgitation, 6.
Initially, the chest x-ray may have shown left pneumonia for which he was treated with ten days of Levofloxacin 250 mg per day.
CT on [**2109-10-8**], showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus but did show increased pulmonary nodules with a ground glass appearance.
Mepron 750 mg/5 cc given as 5 cc twice a day.
Potassium 40 meq once daily.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On examination, the patient was afebrile at 98.4, blood pressure 106/72, respiratory rate 28, pulse 120.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination -  He had moist mucous membranes.
Jugular venous pressure to the angle of the jaw.
Cardiovascular examination - harsh III/VI systolic ejection murmur at the base and left sternal border.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8,7, platelet count 157,000.
Neutrophils 75%.
CT of the chest on [**2109-10-8**], showed multiple pulmonary nodules, associated ground glass opacities, new lung nodules at the bases compared to [**2109-7-30**], minor scarring at the right apex.
He was ruled out for tuberculosis and multiple induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage from his bronchoscopy sent for cytology and bacterial and fungal viral infection.
Essentially, his bronchoalveolar lavage had negative cytology for malignant cells.
Three sets of acid fast bacilli and cultures were negative.
His sputum culture only grew sparse growth of yeast.
Fungal cultures were negative.
Urine culture times two negative.
Blood cultures and fungal cultures no growth to date.
The patient obtained a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 50% and akinesis of the apex and paradoxical motion of the interventricular septum.
Because all his laboratories were essentially negative for an infectious disease workup, the patient was scheduled for a VATS procedure and a Transesophageal Echocardiogram while under general anesthesia.
His last arterial blood gas on [**2109-10-18**], was pH 7.35/57/85.
The Transesophageal Echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, left atrial dilatation, 2+ aortic regurgitation, no mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and no pericardial effusion, and a prosthetic mitral valve.
Hepatitis C. 4.
