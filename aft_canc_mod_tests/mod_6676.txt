[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/mtd    SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: Rectum and Sigmoid, Omentum, Spleen, Distal Portion of Pancrease, Portion of Colon, Anastomotic Donut.
Hematocrits were monitored Q 4 hours.
CMV to PSV at MN - [**10-20**].
[**2156-10-25**] the foley catheter was removed and the patient failed to void, was noted to be incontinent with a bladder scan of 450cc and the foley catheter was reinserted.
Also [**2156-10-25**] JP amylases: LUQ 16,195; LLQ: [**2109**] and this was attributed to be a small pancreatic leak.
The patient was noted to be tachycardic to the, EKG showed sinus tachycardia and was treated with intravenous Lopressor.
Chest Xray showed bibasilar atelectasis which was unchanged from [**2156-10-22**].
The patient was monitored closely, chest PT was preformed which improved respiratory function.
[**2156-10-26**] CT torso showed bilateral atelectasis, mod L pl effusion, no e/o pancreatitis/pancreatic fluid collection and small collection in the pelvis as well as a dilated stomach.
The patient's intraoperative pathology was back on [**2156-10-26**] and showed  T3,N0 - 0/14 lymph nodes.
On [**2156-10-28**] the patient attempted to be weaned of oxygen however oxygenation saturation remained in the 80's and the patient was 90-93% on 3L of oxygen.
A chest xray was obtained which showed decreasing atelectasis and pleural effusions as well as a large gastric bubble.
On [**2156-10-28**] ABG showed metabolic alkalosis, and his EKG was unchanged.
On [**2156-10-29**] Started Ceftazamide to cover possible respiratory source with the intention of if WBC was stable [**10-30**] antibiotics would be discontinued.
On [**2156-10-29**] heart rate was improved to the 90s, and O2 saturation was 100% on 3L.
An additional clamp trial was preformed which was 200 cc.
On [**2156-11-1**] the patient did not have any nausea or vomiting or abdominal distension, drain output was down.
Elevated amylase/lipase; pancreatic edema on CT [**2156-11-3**] started on Zosyn, Flomax and flow max for some urinary incontinence.
[**2156-11-4**] the patient complained of urinary incontinence upon standing a urinalysis was sent and was clean, the patient was consulted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and reassured that this would improved.
Because of continued leukocytosis a serial CT scans were preformed which showed peripancreatic and perirectal collections.
Vancomycin troughs were monitored closely, and prior to discontinuation, the Vancomycin Trough was elevated and caused a slight increase in the patient's creatinine which improved with hydration.
The patient's white blood cell count dramatically improved after IR drainage.
If you notice these symptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room for evaluation if these symptoms are severe.
