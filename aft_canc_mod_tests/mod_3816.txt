Extensive hilar, mediastinal, axillary, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, essentially unchanged from [**2143-12-27**], exam.
A large number of retroperitoneal, mesenteric, pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes are present, many which are mildly enlarged by CT criteria.
CTA [**2144-1-20**] 1.
5-mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule for which a six-month followup chest CT is advised.
CXR [**2144-1-22**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2143-12-30**] through [**1-20**]: Elevation of the lung bases is probably due to component of small pleural effusions and basal atelectasis.
RUQ U/S [**2144-1-27**] 1.
SKIN PUNCH BIOPSY LEFT CHEST [**2144-2-9**] Dermal vascular proliferation consistent with Kaposi's sarcoma (see note).
HBV Viral Load (Final [**2144-2-20**]): HBV DNA not detected.
Bone marrow and lymph node biopsies confirmed that he has plasmablastic lymphoma in the setting of HHV-8(+) Castleman's Disease.
He was treated with 1 cycle of modified R-[**Hospital1 **] (steroids, Rituximab, Bortezomib, Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide, and Doxorubicin): [**2144-1-24**]: started Dexamethasone 20mg PO daily (decreased to 10mg PO daily) [**2144-1-31**]: Rituximab 710 mg IV (375 mg/m2) [**2144-2-8**]: Rituximab 710 mg IV (375 mg/m2) [**2144-2-10**]: Bortezomib 2.4mg IV (1.3 mg/m2) [**2144-2-13**]: Cyclophosphamide 1340 mg IV (750 mg/m2), Doxorubicin 4 mg IV (2.5 mg/m2), Vincristine 0.4 mg IV (0.2 mg/m2), changed from Dexamethasone to PredniSONE 100 mg PO [**2144-2-14**]: Doxorubicin 4 mg IV (2.5 mg/m2), Vincristine 0.4 mg IV (0.2 mg/m2), PredniSONE 100 mg PO [**2144-2-15**]: no chemo [**2144-2-16**]: no chemo [**2144-2-17**]: Doxorubicin 8 mg IV (5 mg/m2), Vincristine 0.4 mg IV (0.2 mg/m2), PredniSONE 100 mg PO [**2144-2-18**]: Doxorubicin 8 mg IV (5 mg/m2), Vincristine 0.4 mg IV (0.2 mg/m2), PredniSONE 100 mg PO He tolerated the chemotherapy well without significant side effects.
He was on Allopurinol and TLS labs were monitored.
He will follow up with his Oncology team on the day after discharge for monitoring, count check, transfusion, and Neupogen teaching.
His HIV VL on [**2144-12-23**] was 80,000 copies/ml, and on  [**2144-1-31**] it was 341,000 copies/ml.
HIV VL on [**2144-2-17**] was  321 copies/ml.
HBV VL from [**2-4**], [**2-11**], and [**2-18**] undetectable.
CT scan showed edematous gallbladder but ultrasound without gallstones.
His platelets decreased from the 330's down to 40-50 twice during this admission: once in the ICU.
Bone marrow biopsy did not show overt infiltration.
Iron 9 and ferritin 2553 suggests anemia of chronic inflammation, which is consistent with his overall clinical picture.
Blood, urine, sputum, and respiratory viral cultures were all negative.
Once it became clear that the patient's fevers were not of an infectious cause, all antimicrobials (except for Ganciclovir and prophylactic Dapsone) were discontinued on [**2143-1-31**].
Bronch was performed which revealed purulent secretions; BAL culture eventually returned negative.
CTA was negative for PE.
Patient was found to had small-moderate pleural effusions on CT chest and chest radiographs suggestive of possible volume overload.
He was started on CVVH for a few days, which helped him to remain euvolemic.
WBC peaked at 30 on [**2144-1-29**].
Infectious workup had been negative (see above).
He will be started on Neupogen as an outpatient and will follow-up for count checks after discharge.
The insult was likely secondary to a combination of contrast-induced nephropathy, ATN, and possibly an element of tumor lysis syndrome or Ig-related nephropathy as well (SPEP and UPEP were not consistent with this, however).
