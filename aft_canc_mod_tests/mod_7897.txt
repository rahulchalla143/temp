2 stones were extracted successfully using a balloon catheter(sphincterotomy, stone extraction) Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum  CT Chest ([**2189-11-2**]) - 1.
The patient's nurse, [**Doctor First Name **], was notified of the need for repositioning at 2:30 p.m. on [**2189-11-1**] and informed me that the tube has already been repositioned and a followup chest film has been ordered.
CT Head ([**2189-11-2**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2189-11-4**] CT chest: 1.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
On HOD #1, the patient's Tbili climbed to 2.5 and her LFTs continued to rise.
She was intubated for her ERCP with plans to transfer the patient intubated to the ICU after.
CTA was performed that did not show pulmonary embolus.
CXR showed atelectasis and low lung volumes.
She should get formal PFT testing as well as a sleep study as we suspect she may have a diagnosis of OSA or obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
On presentation here, CXR showed opacification of the LUL.
A CT revealed a large fluid collection in the pleural space believed to be CSF.
Pleural effusion was drained; pleural fluid cultures did not grow organisms.
Seizure D/o - Continued home depakote, diazepam, and risperidone.
This may be restarted at rehab if BP is elevated and electrolytes/kidney function are stable.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Follow-up Chest CT recommended after clinical improvement   - Chest CT [**2189-11-2**] showed ill-defined nodular appearing area in LLL which could be part of consolidation/atelectasis process, but requires attention in followup to exclude malignancy - Follow-up dermoid cyst seen on OSH imaging, persistent menstrual bleeding - Pt will see outpatient pulmonary clinic for PFTs and possible sleep study - Pt will see outpatient surgery for discussion of future cholecystectomy  Medications on Admission: - Omeprazole 20mg PO daily - Levothyroxine 50mcg PO daily - ASA 81mg PO daily - Lisinopril 5mg PO daily - MVI - Simvastatin 20mg PO daily - Depakote DR 1000mg PO BID - Os-Cal 500mg PO daily - Diazepam 5mg PO TID - Tylenol 650mg PO TID PRN Pain - Depakote 250mg PO QHS - Risperidone 0.25mg PO QHS - Vit D 50,000 units qWeekly (sunday) - Senna PRN constipation - Bisacodyl PRN constipation - Lactulose 20gm PO Q8 PRN constipation - Percocet 5/325 q6 hours PRN pain - Albuterol inhaler  Discharge Medications: 1. levothyroxine 50 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

You were scheduled to see a surgeon in the next few weeks to discuss removal of your gallbladder  You had to stay in the ICU for a while because your oxygen levels were low and needed a breathing tube.
Your oxygen saturation improved but were on the lower end of normal.
You were scheduled to see a pulmonary doctor for further evaluation as outpatient (see appointments below).
