Blood cultures were sent and a U/A was not concerning for infection.
We also sent off galactomannan antigen and beta-D-glucan labs initially as part of her neutropenic fever workup which were negative.
Looking through OMR her baseline blood pressures are sbp of 90s-100s.
An a-line was obtained which showed higher BP than what was being recorded by the blood pressure cuff.
Her cuff and a-line pressures correlated after fluid resuscitation and the a-line was discontinued.
Most likely this current episode of neutropenia is due to the fact that Neulasta was not given during this cycle of chemo per pt's request, however due to the rapid rise in her WBC count myelosuppression from sepsis was also a possibility.
