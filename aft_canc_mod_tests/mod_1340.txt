The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-12-15**], left ventricular systolic function is now much worse.
CXRAY [**2105-12-28**]:  In comparison with the study of [**12-20**], there is continued relatively low lung volumes.
CT OF HEAD W/ CONTRAST ON [**2105-12-28**]:  FINDINGS: There is a stable area of right occipital encephalomalacia, with ex vacuo dilatation of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
An aortobifemoral graft is present, with contrast opacifying both limbs.
A rim-calcified, nonenhancing 1.6 x 1.1 cm collection posterior to the proximal left iliac artery likely represents a thrombosed pseudoaneurysm.
These were incompletely imaged on the most recent examination, but appear decreased in size from CT on [**2106-1-10**].
The collection surrounding the proximal limb is located in the right infrainguinal region (2:136) and measures 6.1 x 2.8 cm, previously 6.1 x 3.7 cm.
No evidence of intra-abdominal extension; if follow-up imaging is desired, please selectively image the right thigh.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist  [**2106-2-1**]:  INDICATION: Status post PICC placement, assess position.
COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from [**2106-1-29**].
Unchanged right mid-lower lung opacities and improved left mid-lower lung opacities, may be secondary to pulmonary edema and/or pneumonia.
Recommend followup imaging to distinguish between these entities.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-12-29**], the findings are similar.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended.

Pertinent images:  #CXRAY [**2106-1-4**]: In comparison with the study of [**1-1**], there is little overall change.
this study is not optimized for evaluation of the vessels, however, no new vessel occlusion is identified.
The post-gadolinium images are unremarkable.
Ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are otherwise significant for symmetric, age-related prominence.
Patient underwent TEE on [**12-16**] which showed a small vegetation on his aortic valve consistent with endocarditis.
His blood cultures were persistently negative and either culture negative endocarditis or fungal source was suspected.
Numerous serologies including mycoplasma, brucella, bartonella, Q-fever and chlamydia were sent and which are negative to date.
Fungal workup included beta glucan and galactomannan serologies and fungal cultures were are negative.
There has been no positive culture data during this hospitalization, except for two universal PCR's done on [**12-14**] vitreous fluid and [**12-25**] groin pus - Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated both times.
The biopsy showed acute necrotizing vasculitis and dermal abscess formation and noted "Although an immune-mediated vasculitis may be present, the dermal abscess formation is concerning for an infectious process."
This fluid was sent for gram stain which showed numerous polys but no microorgansims.
MRI of the shoulder was poor quality but found supraspinatous rotator cuff tear.
Rheum recommends consideration of AC joint tap to rule out infection; ortho has deferred on this and does not feel exam is c/w infxn.
Review of peripheral smear showed modest dysplastic changes but not blasts concerning for transformation to leukemia.
The LAD was 100% occluded in the mid vessel.
Arterial conduit angiography revealed the LIMA to LAD to be widely  patent.
Venous conduit angiography revealed the SVG-RCA and SVG-OM to be widely patent and without change.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normotension 118/56 mmHg.
Final angiogram showed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection and normal flow in the distal vessel.
Other Cardiac: Elevated Troponins/Cardiac ischemia: Pt has significant hx of CAD with  coronary angioplasty and stenting [**2103**], CABG (LIMA to LAD, SVG to diagonal, SVG to OM, sequential.
On [**12-25**] in the setting of being hypotensive in the PACU after his I&D, he had troponins checked which were elevated.
His troponins peaked at 0.88 on [**12-30**] and his CK/MB peaked at 353/39 on [**12-26**].
EKG remains unchanged from prior.
His repeat Echo on [**12-29**] showed significant worsening LVF with EF decreasing from 50% to 30%.
He went for cardiac cath on [**12-31**] which showed 100% mid LAD occlusion, Lcx hazy thrombus in stent restenosis.
# DM: His blood sugars were initially elevated but improved with sliding scale Humalog and evening Lantus.
Pt blood sugars stable on DC  # [**Month/Year (2) **] Brief: Incision and drainage of right groin abscess, radical debridement of right groin and sartorius muscle flap closure of groin wound [**12-25**] and Debridement and drainage of groin; removal of distal end of aortobifemoral graft and replacement with rifampin-soaked 8-mm interposition Dacron graft segment, complete removal of femoropopliteal graft, and oversewing of popliteal artery on [**1-7**].
# Hyponatremia: Most likely secondary to hypovolemia given patient's history of very poor PO intake, dry MM, NS bolus 500cc x 1, Maintanaince fluids, Urine lytes.
On Dc creatinine is stable  # Pain management: Stopped all narcotics this AM given that pt has AMS likely due to delusion- with hallucinations and inattention which per family seems worse after receiving pain meds, continue to close monitor MS and pain management, Cont on tylenol PRN, Lidocaine patch  # Altered Mental Status: Pt alert and oriented x person.
He had head CT on [**12-28**] and head MRI on [**12-30**] that showed no acute process or changes when compared to prior MRI done on [**12-20**].
endocarditis and arterial graft infection, so ID recommended MRI of head for evaluation of septic emboli.
The post-gadolinium images are unremarkable.
Ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are otherwise significant for symmetric, age-related prominence.
#Thrombocytopenia/Coags:  Pt was on hep drip which started on [**12-25**] and had decrease in platelets which have trended down over the last several days.
