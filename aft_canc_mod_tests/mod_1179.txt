One hour later the patient was talking on the phone and had another episode of nausea followed by vomiting of brownish material with blood clots.
He then came to the Emergency Department where he was found to have a hematocrit of 32 and INR of 1.3.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  The patient was afebrile, with a heart rate of 68, blood pressure 130/76, respirations 18, oxygen saturation 100% on room air.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Normal S1 and split S2.
Extremities:  The patient had peripheral pulses that were 2+ with mild pedal edema.
LABORATORY DATA:  Initial studies indicated a white blood cell count of 11.6, hematocrit 32.1, platelet count 270, with a differential significant for 90% polys, 8% lymphocytes; CHEM7 was remarkable only for a glucose of 286; INR 1.3; ALT 126, AST 162, alkaline phosphatase 331, total bilirubin 1.9.
Chest x-ray indicated no pneumonia or effusions.
Electrocardiogram indicated normal sinus rhythm at 64 with right bundle branch block, a prolonged QTC at 493 msec.
On hospital day #2, the patient's hematocrit was stable, and his liver function tests were trending down.
He received an upper endoscopy which indicated a normal esophagus, clotted blood in the stomach, and erythema and congestion of the duodenal mucosa with contact bleeding.
The patient was transfused 2 U of packed red blood cells with a pretransfusion hematocrit of 29.6 and a posttransfusion hematocrit of 30.0; although this was thought to be an inappropriate response to a transfusion, his hematocrit remained stable, and no further transfusions were attempted at that time.
A repeat upper endoscopy was performed which indicated red blood in the area of the papilla consistent with hemobilia.
The patient was also noted to develop atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and rate in the 150s.
The patient was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for monitoring overnight.
He remained hemodynamically stable, and his hematocrit remained stable.
Blood cultures returned positive for gram-negative rods in 2 out of 2 bottles.
The patient's posttransfusion hematocrit remained stable at 30 for the remainder of his hospital stay.
At the time of discharge, the patient remained in atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of approximately 100.
