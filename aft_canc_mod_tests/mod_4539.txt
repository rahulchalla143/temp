ECHO [**2106-10-14**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
CT Chest [**2106-10-13**] here is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Extensive adenopathy in the superior mediastinum, bilateral axillae, anterior mediastinum, tracheobronchial stations and the para-aortic space are again present: the largest right hilar node measures 18 x 26 mm compared to 13 x 21 mm on the prior study (3:46).
Conversely enlarged axillary and periaortic lymph nodes have decreased in size: A right axillary node measures 20 x 24 mm (2:20) compared to 22 x 32 mm on the prior study, the largest paraaortic posterior mediastinal node now measures 41 x 42 mm compared to 41 x 45 mm on the prior study (2:45).
The study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, only to confirm extensive para-aortic and retroperitoneal soft tissue masses which are incompletely visualized and stable perinephiric fat stranding.
Blood cultures and Urine cultures were negtaive.
Culture data showed sensitivity to cipro and cefipime, however patient is allergic to fluroquinolones.
#: MICU course: On HD 4, he developed a fib with RVR and hypotension to SBP 70, he was transfered to the MICU where he was treated with fluid resussication and rate controlled with amiodarone and digoxin, he converted to sinus rhythm and both were discontinued and metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] was started.
CTA chest was performed which was negative for PE, ECHO showed borderline hypokenetic RV and normal LV systolic function.
On admission his neutrophil count was 790 and he received one dose of neuopgen to correct this.
