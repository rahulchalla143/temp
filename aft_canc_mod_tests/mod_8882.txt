A more focal MRI was repeated to rule out optic nerve infiltration of metastatic cancer cells as a cause of the patient's papilledema.
The patient was transferred to the ICU for bur hole evacuation of her subdural hematoma and placement of a subdural drain to permit lumbar puncture by Neuro-Oncology.
Lumbar puncture was done and cytology was negative for malignant cells so there was no need for an Ommaya shunt.
The neurological examination is stable.
FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to have her blood drawn on Friday to check her blood count and to return on Monday for a follow-up visit to be scheduled by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
