CTA showed pooling of extravasated blood in the cecum, extensive diverticulosis, and no evidence of aorto-enteric fistula.
She underwent emergent angiography that did not reveal the source of bleed.
Second angiogram did not reveal source of bleed.
The patient underwent EGD that did not show evidence of upper GIB.
Colonoscopy revealed no bleeding to cecum but could not pass the scope into the terminal ileum.
The frequency of her bleeding then decreased and her hematocrit remained stable, so she was transferred from the MICU to the floor.
She did not have any bleeding, and her hematocrit remained stable without transfusions.
She preferred not to stay in the hospital until her elective surgery, and there was no medical reason to keep her as she had been stable with no further bleeding or hematocrit drop, and was tolerating a regular diet well.
Anesthesia was contact[**Name (NI) **] for pre-operative work-up, the appropriate labs and studies were identified, and the patient signed the consent form.
Her SBPs were stable in the 110 range for the 3 days on the floor, so she was sent home off of these medications.
# After her surgery, pt will need her anti-hypertensives restarted if indicated.
You had a colonoscopy that showed diverticulosis which you had been diagnosed with previously, and a polyp (a small protrusion of bowel that can sometimes turn into cancer).
Your blood counts were monitored closely, and were stable prior to discharge.
You should stop these three medications because your blood pressure was normal without them, and we do not want to put you at risk for bleeding again before your surgery.
