MRI AND MRA BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST, [**2166-5-10**]  HISTORY: Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Sagittal and axial short TR, short TE spin echo imaging were performed through the brain.
After administration of gadolinium intravenous contrast, axial gradient echo, FLAIR, long TR, long TE fast spin echo, diffusion, short TR, short TE spin echo, and sagittal MP-RAGE imaging were performed.
Comparison to a head CT of [**2166-5-10**].
FINDINGS: The extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage demonstrated on the CT scans is less apparent on the MR, but is seen as areas of hyperintensity in the sulci on the FLAIR images.
The FLAIR images also reveal small bilateral subdural fluid collections whose signal intensities suggest hematomas.
The MRA examination demonstrates no vascular abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: NEURO: Pt was admitted to ICU foloowing discovery of SAH on CT scan.
Her VS and neuro status were monitored closely.
On her day of admission [**2166-5-10**] she underwent a CTA and angiogram of the brain.
Her exam remained stable during the entire hosp stay.
