is a 87 y/o with a history of Dementia, thrombocytosis on hydroxyurea, TIA, seizure, and gout, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED from NH with hypoxia of 84% RA --> 97% 15L after being noted by nursing staff to be gurgling as well as nasal congestion and drainage early in the morning.
Pt was given combivent nebs at the NH and at the time was noted to be afebrile with temp of 98F, P 100, RR 20, BP 136/68.
On arrival to ER pt was found to have TMax 102.2, Tachy to 120's, SBP 130's, and initially 100% on non-rebreather.
Pt was able to be weaned down to a 50% FM (98%), and HR improved to 100's after 1L IV fluids.
CXR: showed a possible LLL pna, and a chest CTA was negative for PE, but did show a L sided consolidation.
Pt recieved Levaquin, Cefepime, Vanco while in the ED and arrived to the MICU satting 96% on 5L NC.

Calcification of the coronary arteries and aorta.
<br> [**2197-7-17**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST CONCLUSIONS: 1.
Age-related diffuse cerebral atrophy and ventricular enlargement, stable since [**2196-7-6**].
Overall, if clinical concern is high for acute ischemic disease, an MRI evaluation of the brain would be helpful.
<br> [**2197-7-17**] CXR IMPRESSION: Left retrocardiac alveolar opacity associated with left small pleural effusion is new, consistent with pneumonia or aspiration.
<br> [**2197-7-25**] CXR FINDINGS: The enteric tube reaches the stomach.

CTA with L lower lobe consolidation correlates with CXR at presentation.
Initial sputum gram staining showed two morphologies of gram negative rods; however, there were never postive sputum cultures or blood cultures.
He required less and less suctioning and was able to mount a good cough in response to chest physiotherapy.
<br> HYPOXIA: Pt initially 84% on RA at [**Hospital1 1501**] and weaned from 100% NRB to 50% FM to 3L NC with O2 sats in mid 90's.
As the patient's peripheral WBC count was rising at this time, this was postulated as a contributor.
CTA negative for PE, and tachycardia could be related to fevers, leukocytosis and underlying infection.
EKG consistent with sinus tachycardia in the MICU.
B12, folic acid, and TSH were all measured upon admission and found to be within normal limites.
A head CT on [**2197-7-17**] showed multiple lacunar infarcts and diffuse cerebral atrophy.
A rectal exam was performed on [**7-28**] to check for evidence of fecal impaction and the exam bore out that the patient had adequate rectal tone and there was only liquid stool in the rectal vault.
He was ruled out for c. diff by three negative fecal c. diff toxin studies on [**9-19**], and [**8-1**].
He did have a urine dipstick positive for WBCs as well as a urine culture positive for greater than 10^5 colonies of [**Last Name (LF) 23087**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was treated with a three-day course of fluconazole prior to discharge.
<br> ELEVATED LFTs: Elevated transaminases, alk phos and LDH on admission of unclear etiology given normal [**Name (NI) 5283**] u/s with no evidence of cholecystitis.
AST > ALT, though patient with no known history of heaty EtOH use.
<br> THROMBOCYTOSIS: Platelet count 310 on admission, consistent with previous platelet counts.
