Not all of the information is available from Dr[**Name (NI) 13339**] original assessment, which apparently stretches back to early [**2157**], but as early as [**2162**] she had WBC 27 with marked lymphocytic predominance.
WBC peaked at 40, and it was sometime around [**2167**] that she began her Russian self treatment program, which remarkably has decreased her WBC to normal with no toxic side effects per the documentation from Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**].

IMAGING CXR UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is top normal.
Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.
CXR was not felt to be consistent with PNA and therefore antibiotics were discontinued once cultures were negative x 48 hrs.
Her CLL was also considered as a possible source of fever however her smear was not consistent with active disease.

TSH was normal.
Blood cx showed no growth at the time of transfer.
Differential: ITP (can be seen in CLL), viral infection, DIC (PTT INR fine, less likely), B12/folate deficiency, HIV.
