She was brought to the Emergency Room by her daughter where EKG showed ??????
Initial CPK was 400, troponin 0.5.
She was given Aspirin, Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg sublingual which caused her systolic blood pressure to drop from 100 to 89.
Her blood pressure responded to one liter normal saline.
Systolic blood pressure again went to the mid 80's with mean arterial pressure of 60 which again responded to normal saline 1 liter.
Chest x-ray showed deviated trachea and mild CHF.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Coronary artery disease, status post inferior MI in 9/00, cath in 9/00 showed 100% proximal RCA lesion, left main with 20% lesion, proximal LAD with 80% lesion, LAD 90% lesion, D1 80% lesion, D2 90% lesion, proximal left circumflex 100% lesion, OM1 70% lesion with cardiac output of three liters.
8) Congestive heart failure with EF of 30-40%.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 11.2, hematocrit 37, platelet count 108,000, INR 0.9, PTT 23.3, Chem 7 shows sodium 146, potassium 5.4, chloride 107, CO2 25, BUN 42, creatinine 1.2, sugar 154, CK 413, troponin 0.5.
Chest x-ray showed deviated trachea with mild failure.
EKG with pain showed normal sinus rhythm with rate of 82, normal axis and intervals, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in lead 3, ??????
mm ST elevation in AVF, lead 2 and 1-[**Street Address(2) 12501**] elevation in V1 and V2.
Pain free EKG showed improved ST elevations in leads 3, AVF, decreased ST depressions in lead 1, AVL, decreased ST elevations in V1 and V2.
Echocardiogram from [**7-/2191**] showed mild LAE, mild focal septal hypertrophy, LV depression with inferior hypokinesis, posterior akinesis and lateral hypokinesis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vitals afebrile, heart rate 70-80, normal sinus, respiratory rate 20, satting 99% on two liters, blood pressure 100/70.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PT and DP pulses 2+.
She was ruled out for an MI with three consecutive cardiac enzymes which showed decreasing CPK but no significant troponin leak.
She underwent echocardiogram that morning which showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with overall left ventricular systolic function mildly depressed and posterior hypokinesis present.
EF was 45-55%.
Overall LV function appeared to be improved from previous report.
Cholesterol panel was also checked the morning of admission which showed the following:  Total cholesterol 288, triglycerides 120, HDL 61 and LDL 203.
Her blood pressure responded well to IV fluid boluses as evidenced in the Emergency Room.
Echocardiogram showed improved EF.
Her systolic blood pressure was well maintained and ACE inhibitor was added on [**2192-9-20**].
On the night of admission she was started on stress dose Hydrocortisone 60 mg IV tid, and on the following day her systolic blood pressure was stabilized and she was decreased to 20 mg po q d of Prednisone.
