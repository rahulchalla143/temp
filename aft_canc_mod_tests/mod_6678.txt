FS was 126 .
FSBS on arrival was 7, with repeat confirmed at 4.
Patient was given D50 x 2 amps with repeat FSBS at 165.
EKG showed sinus bradycardia and lateral T wave flattening/inversion, but no STEMI.
Bedside trauma u/s revealed no tamponade, no free fluid in the abdomen.
A portable CXR was done to confirm ETT placement.
CT head was unremarkable.
CT torso revealed a lung mass, left pleural effusion, no PE, no PTX; likely liver metastases.
His left hepatic lobe was hypoenhancing compared with the right lobe, suggestive of occlusive left portal venous thrombosis.

Pathology was consistent with non-small cell carcinoma with CK7 positive, compatible with several primary sites including pulmonary, pancreatic, and upper GI with morphologic features not typical for a lung primary   [**Hospital **] hospice since [**2-/2176**] but has remained full code -Gout -Diverticulosis -PUD -H. pylori infection -Hypertension -Anemia -Cardiac arrhythmia -Erectile dysfunction -Knee surgery  Social History: The patient began smoking at age 19 and averaged two packs per day subsequently.

Rotation of C1 on C2, which may be positional, but clinical correlation is advised.
CTA and ct a/p [**7-11**] 1.
Findings compatible with CT hypoperfusion complex, including hyperenhancement of the bowel wall, adrenal glands, and kidneys.
Ruled out other diagnoses as follows: No acute intracerebral process on head CT. CT chest/abdomen revealed only disseminated metastasis involving the L perihilar region and liver.
Pt may have had element of altered mental status from infection (aspiration pneumonia vs intrabdominal process), but WBC count was only minimally elevated and he was afebrile, asymptomatic, and responsive on IV fluids with dextrose.
In addition, low muscle glyogen stores and a portal venous thrombus noted on CT likely further impair pt's ability to maintain BS via gluconeogenesis and glycogen mobilization.
pH on admission labs was 7.39, so unlikely to be severely hypercarbic.
# PV thrombus: Noted on CT scan.
Elevated BUN and creatinine of 1.0 in cachectic patient likely indicates reduced GFR.
# Metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma: CT torso now with likely involvement of liver, lung, pancreas, and chest wall.
