Workup revealed a left frontal mass.
The patient underwent biopsy of this mass for tissue diagnosis.
Pathology analysis revealed gemiscytic astrocytoma (WHO II) without oligo component.
[**4-25**] MRI Brain (post op):IMPRESSION: Status post resection of left temporal and posterior frontal mass.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**5-1**] Ct Head: Stable appearance of the left parietal lobe resection bed, with minimal post-surgical blood products and surrounding frontoparietal edema.
LABS: [**2194-4-25**] 07:42PM   GLUCOSE-157 UREA N-10 CREAT-0.9 SODIUM-141 POTASSIUM-3.4 CHLORIDE-105 TOTAL CO2-22 ANION GAP-17 [**2194-4-25**] 07:42PM   WBC-16.5* RBC-4.60 HGB-14.2 HCT-39.3* MCV-85 MCH-31.0 MCHC-36.3* RDW-12.9 [**2194-4-25**] 07:42PM   PLT COUNT-190 [**2194-4-26**] INR - 1.1 [**2194-5-1**] PT - 14.4  PTT- 55.9 INR - 1.2 [**2194-5-2**] PT - 15.2  PTT- 81.1 INR - 1.3 [**2194-5-3**] PT - 30.5  PTT- 83.6 INR - 3.0 [**2194-5-4**] PT - 34.5  PTT- 30.0 INR - 3.5 [**2194-5-5**] PT - 31.7  PTT- 31.4 INR - 3.2 [**2194-5-6**] PT - 36.0  PTT- 32.6 INR - 3.7 [**2194-5-7**] PT - 33.7  PTT- 32.5 INR - 3.3   Brief Hospital Course: Patient presented electively for a left sided craniotomy for resection of mass on [**2194-4-25**].
A CT was performed immediately which showed no hemorrhage or obvious infarct.
An MRI was performed that night which demonstrated no evidence of CVA.
CTA revealed multiple PEs in all segmental arteries.
He was started on a heparin gtt with a bolus of 3000 units and then 1800 units/hr for a goal PTT of 60-100.
A head CT was done to evaluate for hemorrhage before heparin was initiated and showed stable postop findings.
Echocardiogram and EKG were ordered to evaluate for further clots and abnormalities, results as decribed in Pertinent Results section.
Lower extremity dopplers were negative for DVT.
On [**5-1**] he continued on the heparin gtt with close monitoring of PTT and was trasitioned to Coumadin.
Heparin gtt was stopped on [**5-3**] when his INR reached 3.0.
Coumadin was held on [**5-4**] for an INR of 3.5 and resumed on [**5-5**] at a dose of 2.5mg QHS.
His Coumadin was held again on [**5-6**] for an INR of 3.7 and [**5-7**] for an INR of 3.3.
?You will not need an MRI of the brain.
