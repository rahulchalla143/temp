IMAGING DATA: CT chest ([**2121-12-13**]) IMPRESSION: 1.
MR head ([**2121-12-13**]) CONCLUSION: Left hemispheric cortical enhancing lesion with extensive surrounding edema and likely necrosis.
CYTOLOGY [**2121-12-15**] LYMP NODE BX POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with metastatic non-small cell carcinoma.
PATHOLOGY [**2121-12-15**]: DIAGNOSIS: Lung, right lower lobe, endobronchial biopsy (A): Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with areas suspicious for vascular invasion.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2121-12-15**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Large right lower lobe mass is better evaluated on previous chest CT. 3.
Functional MRI [**2121-12-16**]: Impression: 1.
Functional MRI demonstrates no cortical activation surrounding the left parietal lesion after foot, tongue or hand movements.
CT HEAD W/ CONTRAST [**2121-12-19**]: IMPRESSION: Satisfactory postoperative appearance with a small amount of hemorrhage in the operative bed.
MRI HEAD [**12-19**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Attention on followup exam should to be paid to this area after the resolution of acute postoperative changes.

He was found to have lung and brain lesions and underwent a lung biopsy which showed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
He tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the ICU for Q1 hour neuro checks and systolic blood pressure control less than 140.
Postoperative head CT demonstrated mild left frontal pneumocephalus, no hemorrhage oe mass effect.
On [**2121-12-19**] POD 1 he underwent MRI brain which demonstrated good resection of the mass and was negative for stroke.
His diet and activity were advanced and his blood pressure goal was liberalized to less than 160.
His wound was clean, dry and intact with dissolvable sutures in place.
Patient will need his stitches removed POD#10 on [**12-27**].
Previous blood cx's negative.
His calcium levels were monitored and were below normal at the time of discharge.
Microcytic anemia - Patient initially anemic to 25.2 with MCV in the low 70's.
Iron studies were performed, appears to be consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of the mass in your lung and brain.
