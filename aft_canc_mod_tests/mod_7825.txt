The patient states that she first experienced clinical manifestations of her liver disease in [**2129**] following her total colectomy.
A biopsy performed at that time revealed cirrhosis with extensive canalicular cholestasis.
Liver disease was well controlled until after her colectomy in [**2129**], when her bilirubin began to rise.
Following her discharge, she has experienced episodes of severe fatigue and mild dyspnea on exertion.
Today, she presented to liver clinic for transplantation evaluation and complained of non-productive cough x 5 days, SOB, ongoing fatigue.
Labs on arrival were notable for WBC of 21.6.
While on the floor, maroon stool was noted in her colostomy bag and hematocrit was found to be 17.9, therefore transfusion was started and she was transferred to the ICU for urgent EGD.

GIB: On admission, the patient was found to be hypotensive to SBP in the 70's with a hematocrit of 17.9.
She underwent ultrasound that showed peristomal varices.
With stabilization of her hematocrit, the patient was transferred back to the medical floor.
