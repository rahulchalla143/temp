The patient underwent abdominal ultrasound and CT to workup his abdominal discomfort.
He was referred for cardiac catheterization as part of preoperative surgical clearance.

Limited resting hemodynamics reveal elevated left sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 20 mmHg.
The central aortic pressure was 153/85 mmHg.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
No significant valvular disease seen [**2108-8-2**] Chest CT Scan: In the left lobe of the thyroid, a 2.5 cm nodule is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery including left main lesion - see result section for further details.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and further preoperative evaluation was performed.
This was highlighted by an echocardiogram, chest CT scan and carotid ultrasound - see result section for additional details.
The echocardiogram showed only mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function, mild diastolic LV dysfunction, and no significant valvular disease.
Chest CT scan revealed a thyroid nodule and right upper lobe nodule, but there was no evidence of lesions suspicious for metastasis.
His lantus dose was increased to 45 units at bedtime in response to elevated blood sugars and an admission Hemoglobin A1C of 8.1.
