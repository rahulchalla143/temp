3 PM pale, diaphoretic BP 60/palp.
Referred to the ED from outpatient chemotherapy session due to shortness of breath, chest pain, low O2 sats, tachycardia and hypotension.
In the ED her vital signs were: T 100.9, HR 140s, BP 99/58, RR 20, O2 sat 98% on 2L NC.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia with ?
Chest CAT scan showed left lower lobe collapse and mediastinal enlargement encroaching on the left mainstem bronchus.
Chemo as stated below with worsening mets as apparent by CT scan, last carboplatin [**8-19**].
Chest CT showed left lower lobe collapse and mediastinal enlargement encroaching on the left mainstem bronchus.
Left pneumonectomy was performed and pathology demonstrated a 6 x 5.5-cm adenoid cystic carcinoma.
A CT scan in [**2105-2-23**] showed no evidence of recurrence and a bronchoscopy at that time was unremarkable.
On [**2106-8-5**] follow up CT scan showed increased soft tissue throughout in the pneumonectomy cavity, especially in the apex and medially adjacent to the descending aorta.
Ms. [**Known lastname 14502**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a biopsy of the pleural thickening ([**2106-10-13**]).
Pathology showed adenocarcinoma in fibrous tissue.
The pathology was compared to her primary resection from [**3-/2103**] and felt to be consistent with her primary tumor.
Repeat CT after therapy showed recurrent adenoid cystic carcinoma of the trachea, now involving the lungs, pleura, and liver.
Spinal MRI was negative, but brachial plexus MRI showed tumor in the left paraspinal region from T2-T5.
CT torso from [**2109-9-19**] showed progression in the liver and kidney, and she was started on gemcitabine on [**2109-10-8**].
-low-dose Taxotere in [**11-28**] -four cycles of cisplatin and Adriamycin from [**10-28**] to [**12-30**] with initial radiographic improvement, but a CT scan in [**9-29**] revealed progression in the lungs and liver.
-Two cycles of carboplatin and Taxol were given ([**9-29**]) with stabilization of her liver lesions but continued progression in the left lung - four cycles of dose-reduced cisplatin and Navelbine ([**Date range (1) 31896**]) - Gemcitabine ([**2109-10-8**]); limited by progressive myelosuppresion - Carboplatin in [**7-/2110**] .

Studies: CXR ([**8-26**]):Changes from prior left-sided pneumonectomy with calcification along the remaining cystic cavity within the left hemithorax is unchanged when compared to [**2110-4-1**].
CTA CHEST ([**8-26**]): No filling defects in the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism.
There has been interval development of multiple patchy alveolar opacities throughout most of the right upper and lower lobe, most consistent with appearance of pneumonia.
Limited evaluation of upper abdominal organs demonstrates incompletely imaged hepatic lesions.
MRI Head [**2110-8-29**]: MPRESSION: 1.
Video Swallow Study [**2110-8-29**]: FINDINGS:  The oral phase demonstrated mildly impaired bolus formation and bolus control.
The barium pill was held up at the level of the distal esophagus.
#) Shortness of breath: Findings on imaging studies demonstrating abnormalities in right upper and lower lobes are most suspicious for community acquired pneumonia.
Initially there was no history aspiration, as she had nausea with no vomiting after chemotherapy, however speech and swallow studies demonstrated aspiration, so she was also treated for an aspiration pneumonia.
Patient was not currently not neutropenic, though CT scan with possible spreading of metastasis.
#) Hypotension: Initially there was concern for sepsis, however, the patient's blood pressure stabilized in response to fluid boluses.
- It was felt that the patient's baseline blood pressure was on the lower side, with systolic in the mid 80s to low 100's, and she was mentating well without any evidence of end organ damage.
Her INR remained elevated during much of her stay, and her Coumadin was initially restarted, however held due to high levels, likely due to concurrent antibiotic use.
- At her follow up appointment just after discharge, her INR was to be re-checked, and Coumadin re-started as necessary.
Her EKG demonstrated ST segment changes, however her cardiac enzymes were followed and remained within normal limits.
Her increased heart rate was likely in part due to infection, further complicated by component of hypovolemia, and reflexive given hypotension.
Follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for evaluation and possible placement of a stent to help was in process of being set up at time of discharge, and the gastroenterology service was to contact the patient.
It was thought that these were all due to a pneumonia that was seen on the CT scan.
You were given antibiotics and intravenous fluids to treat the infection and replete your fluids to improve your blood pressure.
Your blood pressure remained stable, and your fevers resolved.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**9-3**] at 12:30 pm.
You will need to have your INR (Coumadin level) checked on Wednesday [**2110-9-3**].
