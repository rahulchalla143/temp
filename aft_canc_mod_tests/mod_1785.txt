Found to have worse anemia with Hct 23.9 and troponin leak (0.2).
Chest pressure resolved in ED with O2 and blood transfusion of 1 unit.
BP 120/70, P 76 regular.
O2 sat 100% on 2L.
Neck supple, JVP 5-6cm.
Pertinent Results: [**2188-9-26**] Cardiac Catheterization 1.
Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system  revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressures (28 mmHg) but normal early diastolic pressures (8 mmHg) consistent with diastolic dysfunction.
[**2188-9-29**] ECHO Prebypass: 1.The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
