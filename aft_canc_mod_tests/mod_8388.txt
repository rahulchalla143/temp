Admission Date:  [**2115-5-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-5-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2062-3-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L thoracentesis x2  History of Present Illness: 53 y/o F h/o HIV (no HAART [**4-6**] CD4 490, VL > 100K), Stage IV NSCLC presented to the ED with SOB x10 days with progressive DOE, orthopnea and cough productive of occasional sputum.
In the ED patient had CXR and CTA that demonstrated no PE, but significant progression of disease with enlarging r-hilar mass extending to the subcarinal area with lymphadenopathy and metastases.
Thoracentesis performed on [**5-22**] w/ removal of 1.4L of fluid from chest and again [**5-26**] removing 1200cc of bloody fluid w/o complication.
CXR looks a bit better.
Gave nebs and MSo4, ativan 1mg.
EKG unchanged.
PMH # HIV ([**2115-3-20**]: CD4 471, VL >100,000) - No HAART - No h/o OI # Asthma # Anemia # Depression   Social History: # Personal: Lives with boyfriend # Tobacco: No current.
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: # VS T 98.1 BP 115/80 HR 113 RR 22 O2 99%4L .
Ext: No edema, WWP Neuro: CN II-XII grossly intact  Pertinent Results: # CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2115-5-20**] 10:21 PM 1.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2115-5-21**] 10:55 AM Status post thoracocentesis with decrease in left pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
# MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2115-5-21**] 10:04 AM 1.
Marrow signal from the cervical spine is unusual with loss of normal signal on T1, this is a nonspecific finding and may represent skeletal metastases and a bone scan would be helpful for further evaluation.
# TTE [**2115-5-21**] at 12:47:29 PM The left atrium is elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-4-10**], the pericardial effusion around the right atrium is better seen.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2115-5-22**] 8:53 AM: Interval reaccumulation of left pleural effusion.
# BONE SCAN  [**2115-5-22**]: No evidence of osseous metastases; bladder uptake obscurs the central pelvis.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2115-5-24**] 11:38 AM Large left pleural effusion has increased since [**5-22**], producing more rightward mediastinal shift, secondary atelectasis in both the left lower lung and the central right lung.
# CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2115-5-25**] 11:24 PM 1.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-5-21**], the amount of pericardial effusion has increased.
Patient had repeat thoracentesis x2 on the floor as per HPI and later pleurodesis after the effusions recurred.
Hypoxia post-pleurodesis thought [**3-2**] to disease progression vs. adverse reaction to talc used on pleurodesis.
- [**5-22**]: Rad onc consult pending for question whole brain XRT - [**5-23**]: Holding XRT pending chest treatment.
# Anemia: Hct 29.
