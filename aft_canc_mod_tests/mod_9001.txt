Brain mets discovered on MRI in [**2187-3-13**] - underwent whole brain cranial irradiation in [**2187-3-13**].

Marked short-interval progression of metastatic disease with increase in both size and number of numerous both supra- and infratentorial masses, many of which demonstrate internal hemorrhage.
The patient showed no signs of seizure and her neuro examination improved.
Of note, she underwent a spinal tap on [**2187-8-14**], which was positive for malignant cells, consistent with metastatic carcinoma.
Repeat CT at HD 2 showed no more midline shift.
She is not a candidate for CyberKnife treatment for her progressive brain metastases given the abundance of mets on MRI on [**2187-8-29**].
Her muscle strengths are [**6-14**] at all muscle groups, except for right deltoid at 4/5 and proximal lower extremities at 4/5.
Sensory examination is intact to touch and proprioception.
Coordination examination does not reveal dysmetria.
She was empirically started on vancomycin/cefepime initially, but after cultures were negative x 3 days in the CSF (with negative gram stain), these antibiotics were stopped.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - follow up pending CSF cultures, pending blood cultures (all have been no growth to date at time of discharge) - will need physical therapy and occupational therapy - will need cisplatin chemotherapy on [**2187-9-13**], with removal of PICC line pending decision regarding continuation or discontinuation of chemotherapy - will need continued intrathecal chemotherapy per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] - ongoing discussions regarding code status.
