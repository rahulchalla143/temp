He has also noticed that his blood pressure, which is baseline systolic was 80 systolic today.
Baseline exercise tolerance is ~1 block and unchanged recently.
In the ED, initialy VS: BP 60/44, O2 90% RA in triage, but first set of VS in core BP 121/101, RR 19, HR 72, T 98.3.
CXR did not demonstrate any significant change from prior.
Exam was without localizing features apart from an elevated JVP.
Urine and blood cultures were sent.
Bedside echo demonstrated global hypokinesis, thought to be similar to prior.
EKG showed ST depressions in v3-v6 and new QW in II, new from prior.
Labs were notable for trop elevated above baseline but no CK elevation.
VS prior to transfer (on .09 of norepinephrine): HR 78, BP 104/85, 20, 97% 4L, CVP 26 .
