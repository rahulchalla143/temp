Twenty minutes later the patient had a grand tonic-clonic seizure in the transport vehicle and the patient's blood glucose was reported at 207 at the time.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 99.3 F.  Blood pressure 120/80.
Pulse 78.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  He had periorbital hematomas.
On motor exam the patient had 4/5 strength throughout the upper and lower extremities in a symmetric fashion with normal tone and bulk without adventitious movements.
LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count baseline anemia with a normal MCV, presumably due to chronic disease, hematocrit was over 12/35 on admission and [**8-16**] on discharge.
The patient's blood pressure remained stable throughout the entire neurologic admission.
Dip stick urinalysis on admission showed large blood but no evidence of any urinary tract infection.
CPK enzymes were negative times three sets.
Dilantin level was 7.7 and 9.2 checked while patient was receiving Dilantin in the Trauma Surgery Intensive Care Unit.
Imaging studies were performed during this admission.
Initial CT showed hemispheric bilateral chronic collections which at that time were supposed to be either subdural hematomas or hygromas, magnetic resonance scan later during the admission confirmed they were hygromas and not subdermal hematomas.
CT abdomen and pelvis performed on admission showed no traumatic organ injury or intra-abdominal hematoma.
CT of the orbit showed a nasal bone fracture with air fluid levels within the maxillary sinuses, no other fractures identified.
The patient had magnetic resonance scan of head on [**2185-9-23**] showing no acute definite evidence of acute brain ischemia and questionable hemorrhagic elements within the left side subdural fluid collection.
Multivariate regression analysis showed moderate stenosis involving the precavernous portion of the right internal carotid artery with presenting atherosclerotic disease.
A repeat head CT on [**9-24**] showed stable appearance of bilateral subdural fluid collections with higher attenuation of left cerebral collection than right.
The patient was scheduled to have magnetic resonance scan with contrast and susceptibility imaging during this admission but refused as he was anxious during the initial magnetic resonance scan and promised to follow-up as an outpatient after getting open magnetic resonance scan with primary care physician and neurology clinic.
The etiology of the patient's seizures were unresolved at the time of discharge as they could be due to bilateral subdural hydroma collection or possible metastatic melanoma involving cerebrum.
The patient was informed that it would be to his advantage to have magnetic resonance scan with contrast and susceptibility imaging while he was an inpatient, but due to his anxiety during the first magnetic resonance scan the patient refused this test on three occasions and promised to have test preformed as outpatient with appropriate follow-up.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2048**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was called and informed about the patient's admission.
The patient was also given a prescription to obtain outpatient head magnetic resonance scan in open setting so that the patient does not become anxious during this admission and refused closed myocardial infarction.
The patient also given the number to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of [**Hospital 878**] Clinic in about four weeks to review magnetic resonance scan findings and ascertain etiology of seizures.
Electroencephalogram performed on [**2185-9-23**] showed abnormal electroencephalograms in awake and drowsy states consistent with encephalopathy but no focal epileptiform discharges.
