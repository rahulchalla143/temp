There is apparent asymmetry in the distance between the odontoid and the lateral masses of C1 which may be due to rotatory subluxation versus positional and can be imaged further as per clinical need.
Head CT [**11-10**]: 18-mm left subdural hematoma with mass effect and midline shift towards the right of approximately 11 mm.
CT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis [**11-10**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Filling defect within the right portal vein, which could represent non- occlusive thrombus and would recommend ultrasound evaluation to further evaluate.
Head CT [**11-10**](post-surgery): IMPRESSION: 1.
LENIS [**11-17**]:IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombosis of the right common femoral vein.
Head CT [**11-11**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Continued attention on followup studies is recommended.
[**2128-11-23**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Final Report  IMPRESSION:  1.
EEG [**2128-12-2**]  IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the right fronto-central slowing and due to the relatively monotonous mildly slow background throughout.
Head CT [**12-15**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Head CT [**12-17**] IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in size of fluid collection, with decrease in mass effect upon left frontal hemisphere.

On exam he was extensor posturing and had significant anisicoria.
He was placed on dilantin for sz prophylaxis and later transitioned to Keppra as his serum levels were difficult to keep in the therapeutic range.
Social work eval revealed that he is known to the [**Hospital1 18**] system.
It was noted that the pt had an alcohol like odor on his breath on admission - he was placed on a CIWA scale.
Inital eval revealed that 1.
His hematocrit did drop during the hospitalization and the surgical ICU determined that this was enamia of chronic disease.
His serial exams showed some improvement, he was localizing with his right upper extremity, there was also some spontaneous movement on the right side.
Post operatvie CT scan was stable.
A temp spike to 102.1 occurred on [**11-14**] and fever workup was initiated - it revealed that he had citrobacter in the sputum and treated with cipro for this.
Urine and blood cultures at that time were negative.
Serial CXR's for the right apical pneumothorax showed spontaneous resolution of this-he did not require a chest tube.
Guardianship was obtained by the court [**2128-12-10**] and trach and PEG were performed at the bedside that day.
His neuro exam showed that he followed commands at times on the right upper and bilat lower extremities.
On [**12-17**] pt developed a subgaleal collection on L side of head which was subsequently drained 4 times and head wrap most recently on [**12-27**] with improvement.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast for this appointment.
