In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his Bcx grew MRSA and his port was d/c and replaced w/ PIV.
He received an LP which was normal other than demonstrating plasma cells in the CSF.
He was transfered back to the unit [**1-20**] hemodynamic instability.
Onc Hx: Pt presented in [**2173-5-19**] for evaluation of diffuse bone pain, at which time he was noted to have an increased BUN, creatinine, and was hypercalcemic.
Bone marrow bx was done on [**6-9**], showing extensive involvement by plasma cell myeloma with 80-90% cellularity.
Multiple Myeloma: dx [**5-23**], treated w/ velcade; c/b pancytopenia 3. hx of invasive aspergillosis dx in [**7-/2173**], on ongoing TIW ambisome treatment 4. baseline creatinine since diagnosis 1.8-2.3 5.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**10-17**]: No mass effect or hemorrhage.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**10-18**]: 1) Multiple new diffuse nodular opacities, with a dominant right upper lobe cavitary lesion.
TTE [**10-19**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

Pt was then found to be altered with a normal BP after fluid resuscitation so an LP was done which demonstrated plasma cells in the CSF.
His initial blood cx grew out MRSA and he was started on vancomycin/cefepime and his line was removed.
His LP and urine did not show signs of infection.
He was given ambisome for CT findings demonstrating likely worsening invasive aspergillosis and acyclovir for a history of disseminated zoster.
After the LP showed CNS involvement of his plasma cell leukemia, the patient was made CMO.
His antibiotics and steroids were stopped and further cultures/temperatures were not taken.
His CBC was followed and he was transfused prn until he was made cmo.
