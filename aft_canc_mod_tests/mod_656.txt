At [**Location (un) 620**], initial sats were 88% on FiO2 35% but improved post trach suction.
He had a CT scan which revealed a temporal lobe mass and 1 cm midline shift.
In the ED, vitals were T 98.5 HR 105 143/98 R [**9-20**] 99% 10L on trach.
He was evaluated by the neurosurgical service for evaluation of his right temporal lobe mass and midline shift, and the patient declined further neurological surgery.
Family History: nf  Physical Exam: VS: T 97.3 HR 102 142/94 RR 15 94% FiO2 35% GENERAL: Lying flat, NAD, responsive to verbal commands HEENT: Swollen right side of face, right eye swollen shut NECK: Trach in place CHEST: Crackles anteriorly ABDOMEN: +J tube site with dark, pururlent drainage NEURO: Right pupil 4mm and nonreactive.
CT head 3.6 x 3.5 mass in right middle cranial fossa with external vasogenic edema.
ECG Sinus tachycardia to 101, q-waves in II, III, aVF, TWI in V1-V2 .
[**2155-7-10**] 2:05 am SPUTUM Site: ENDOTRACHEAL GRAM STAIN (Final [**2155-7-10**]): >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
3+ (5-10 per 1000X FIELD): GRAM NEGATIVE DIPLOCOCCI.
2+ (1-5 per 1000X FIELD): GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
Summary: Mets secondary to temporal lobe mass, unclear duration as no prior CT to compare.
CXR showed left patchy opacities and effusion that were new.
Patient was started on Vancomycin 1g QD and Zosyn 4.5 q8h.
Hypoxic episodes recurred at higher frequency and by HD# 10 patient required 100% FiO2 for oxygen saturations > 90%.
By end of HD#11, patient had increasing frequency of respiratory distress episodes and decreasing saturations (70 - 80%) despite suctioning and nebulizer treatments nearly q2hrs.
No evidence of acute bowel pathology on CT scan from [**7-10**] or KUB.
Pain was controlled with IV morphine, 4-8mg q2h and fentalyl patch, 100 mcg.
# Exacerbation of anemia - HCT fluctuating 26 - 32 over past week, now at 26 x2d.
# Hyponatremia - 133, Urine osm > 200, patient euvolemic.
Patient would still receive D5NS for nutritional support (per HCP) and receive blood transfusions if HCT < 21, but final decisions regarding this management and further interventions would be deferred to the medical team should the harm of treatment outweigh the benefits, these treatments will be discontinued.
