A recent echocardiogram in [**Month (only) **] revealed severe MR with a flail posterior leaflet.
He was admitted to the VA and underwent a TEE which was stopped due to NSVT vs. SVT.
Cardiac catheterization  in [**2162-1-17**] confirmed 4+ MR. Angiography revealed a 70% lesion in the circumflex and a 50% lesion in the LAD.
Physical Exam: Vitals: BP 160-180/ 80, HR 45-50 GEN: WDWN gentleman in NAD SKIN: Warm, dry, multiple nevi and small lipomas HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, Anicteric sclera, mild cataracts, OP benign NECK: Supple, no JVD LUNGS: Clear, mild kyphosis ABD: Benign, obese.

Given his history of SVT and Maze procedure, Amiodarone was resumed.
His systolic BP at the time of neurologic event was in the 90's to low 100's.
A stat head CT scan and MRI/MRA were obtained and the neurology service was consulted.
Head MR found no evidence of acute infarction or abnormalities except slightly diminished flow signal within the right Sylvian middle cerebral artery branches compared to the left side,  while CT scan showed no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Carotid noninvasive studies found no evidence of significant carotid stenoses and showed appropriate antegrade flow in the vertebral arteries.
Based on the above studies, the neurology service suspected a TIA secondary to decreased cerebral perfusion.
Warfarin was dosed daily for a goal INR between 2.0 - 2.5.
At discharge, his BP was 117/55 with a HR of 84.
His oxygen sat was 98% on room air and his chest x-ray showed small bilateral pleural effusions.
He will eventually need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient for diagnostic EP study in the near future.
