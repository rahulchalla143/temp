Laminectomy, L1, L2.
[**2107-12-12**] -PICC placement   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 78 yoM with h/o DM2, HTN, CKD (Cr was 2.4 on [**2107-11-26**] on last admission), CAD s/p MI on [**2107-11-26**], who presents with 3 days of lumbar back pain and F/C/rigors.
At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], C/T/L spine MRI was concerning for epidural abscess though it was a poor quality film as they did not use gadolinium given CRI.
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] called to report he was growing GPC in [**3-19**] blood culture bottles from [**12-2**].
He subsequently underwent an ECHO with limited views which revealed hypokinesis of the distal septum, apex and distal anterior and inferior walls with an EF of 45% and no prior ECHO for comparison.
Initial TnT was 0.1 and rose to 1.3 prior to transfer.
CK rose to 250 with MB 18.

TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2107-11-28**](@WXVA): Nl RV.
EF 55%.
TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2107-11-26**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
[**2107-12-3**] MRI C/T/L SPINE w/o CONTRAST (prelim read):  At L1-2, there is moderate spinal stenosis seen secondary to disc and facet degenerative changes.
Calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 44%.
[**12-6**] ECHO TEE: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**12-7**] CT Head: 1.
[**12-9**] LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler evaluation of left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, and basilic veins demonstrate normal compressibility, flow, response to augmentation wherever applicable.

Vancomycin trough: 24.5   Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old male with sig vascular risk factors, admitted with suspected spontaneous epidural abscess and cauda equina syndrome.
MRI on admission did not demonstrate epidural abscess, though it was concerning for epidural lipomatosis, per ortho spine.
The patient underwent a laminectomy of T12-L3 on [**12-4**] for spinal canal stenosis.
His Vancomycin was renally dosed, and troughs were checked daily.
Repeat urine culture was negative.
Patient had evidence of delirium, so given negative repeat urine culture ciprofloxacin was stopped after a 3 day antibiotic course and patient was monitored.
Cardiac enzymes showed troponin leak and p-MIBI showed normal myocardial perfusion.
Troponin leak was felt to be both demand in setting infection, due to increasing renal failure and perhaps resolving enzymes from STEMI.
Urine lytes were sent and revealed allergic interstitial nephritis due to eosinophils and FeNa 1.5%.
LUE U/S demonstrated nearly occlusive left cephalic vein thrombosis but no evidence of DVT.
CT head showed no acute event.
ANEMIA of CHRONIC DISEASE: HCT 32 on admission.
Patient HCT was lower post surgery at HCT 24-27.
Slight drift downward attributed to poor nutrition with delirium and blood draws.
Iron and B12, Folate studies revealed anemia of chronic disease.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: Seventeen (17) grams PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Luckily, your kidney function returned to its baseline when this medication was stopped and replaced with vancomycin.
