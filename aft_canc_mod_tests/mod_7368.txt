On careful followup, she has been found to have a slowly-growing, spiculated, noncalcified, solid right upper lobe mass.

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**8-28**] and prior films since [**2110-8-25**]:  There has been no change since [**8-27**].
Considerable consolidation is still present at both lung bases, small-to-moderate right and left pleural effusions are stable and there is no pneumothorax.
The persistent abnormality in the lower lungs has been attributed to asymmetric edema, but the chronicity now begins to suggest pulmonary hemorrhage, less likely pneumonia because both areas were atelectatic when larger pleural effusions were present.

Pt tolerated procedure well and transferred to PACU in stable condition, Ct x2 to sx.
PACU course complicated by brief administration of phenylephrine gtt and transfusion PRBC x2 for HCT 25.
Pt transitioned to lovenox and to coumadin (POD#6) w/ goal INR [**3-6**].
INR elevated w/ amiodarone, therefore coumadin held, and INR corrected w/ FFP daily x3 days.
