In the ED, the patient's vitals were: BP 130/52 (102-122/31-66) HR 118 (102-115) RR 26 O2 Sat 100% on NRB.
He was noted to be anemic with a hct of 18 (Baseline 26-30), but was guaiac negative.
BNP was elevated at 7882.
Iron studies and hemolysis labs were ordered per renal recs.
CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema.
On ROS, pt denies weight changes, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain.
Diabetes x25 years 2. hypertension 3. cholesterolemia 4. myocardial infarction in [**2104**] 5. severe osteoarthritis effecting the hips, shoulders, knees 6. spinal stenosis bothering his back 7. chronic kidney disease s/p living related renal transplant in  [**9-/2105**] with a graft from his wife 8. peripheral vascular disease s/p bilateral lower extremity revascularizations and bilateral toe amputations.
Diastolic Heart Dysfunction: Echo [**1-3**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Klebsiella bacteremia, UTI and sepsis [**2-3**]   Social History: Smoked cigarettes until [**2083**].
Physical Exam: Vitals: BP 136/37 HR 95 RR 26 Sat 100% NRB-->ABG: 7.41/37/112 GEN: obese caucasian male sitting at 60 degrees in bed with respiratory accessory muscle use and paradoxical abdominal wall movements with breathing HEENT: pupils constricted, conjunctivae anicteric/noninjected but pale, MMM NECK: JVP at mandible with +HJR CV: distant heart sounds, regular rhythm, no m/r/g LUNGS: rales at bilateral lung bases R>L, poor air movement AB: soft, nontender, mildly distended and protuberant, paradoxical abdominal wall movements with breathing EXTREM: 2+ pitting edema in BL LE up to the knees, BL toe amputations (all 10 toes amputated), 1+ radial pulses bilaterally SKIN: chronic venous insufficiency changes in the BL LE NEURO: alert and oriented, moving all 4 extremities   Pertinent Results: Studies: [**2112-3-21**] EKG: EKG: sinus tachnycardia, nl axis, TWI and 1mm ST depressions in V5-6, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in V2, TWI in lateral and inferior leads-->all old from [**1-3**] .
Evaluation of the apices are limited by head positioning.
[**2112-3-24**] CXR:  Compared to prior studies from [**3-22**] and 28th, there has been interval improvement in now mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-1-27**], tissue Doppler analysis was included in the current study with evidence of elevated LV filling pressure.
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon 2.
BNP was 7000 on admission.
There were no signs of PNA clinically, and serial CXR showed improvement of pulmonary edema.
He was initially admitted to the ICU and required a NRB to keep his oxygen saturation greater than 90%.
He had an ECHO which showed grade II diastolic dysfunction and a LVEF of >60%.
He was given metoprolol with a goal HR in the 60s and SBP in the 120s.
His respiratory status improved markedly with diuresis and cardiac rate control and he will be discharged to rehab maintaining oxygen saturations on room air.
#Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: His baseline creatinine is 1.9 to 2.9, with a recent trend upward from 1.9 (max 3.6 during this hospitalization).
Per renal recommendations his immunosuppression meds were originally decreased as his sirolimus level was 9 on admission (goal [**5-2**] as he is 7 years out from transplant).
His renal function continued to improve during his stay with continued diuresis and PRBC transfusions and creatinine on discharge was 1.7.
#Anemia: His HCT was 18 on admission from a previous baseline of 26-30.
EGD and colonoscopy were performed which did not reveal a source of bleed.
His reticulocyte count was appropriately elevated, making marrow suppression unlikely.
Iron studies revealed significantly low iron and he was repleted with IV iron.
A serum TTG was sent to rule out celiac disease.
Hemolysis labs were not suggestive of active hemolysis.
His hematocrit should be followed at rehab.
He should follow up as scheduled with hematology and iron studies should be rechecked in [**2-28**] weeks.
Hematocrit on discharge was 29.3. .
# UTI: Urine cultures on admission grew Klebsiella sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
A recent urine culture grwe enterococcus sensitive to vanco, ampicillin (pt.
Vancomycin levels should be followed at rehab to ensure therapeutic levels.
Cardiac enzymes were felt to be secondary to tachycardia in the setting of severe anemia.
