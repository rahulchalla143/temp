Compared to the previous tracing the rate has slowed slightly.
[**2199-3-14**]  GI Bleeding study IMPRESSION: 1) No active bleeding within the bowel.
Colonoscopy, bleeding scan, CT scan of abdomen and EGD did not reveal bleeding lesion though EGD showed varices that appeared to have bleed sometime recently.
Hct was fairly stable after receiving 9 units of PRBCs and 3 Units FFP, though the patient did get one more unit of PRBCs after transfer to the medical floor for hct<28.
He will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] on an outpatient basis and will need his hct followed closely after discharge.
Cont Vit K 5 mg SC X 3 days, gave FFP x 3 while in unit to correct INR to <1.4.
It was felt unlikely to be from infection as his WBC count was normal, he had no fever, his UA was negative, his CXR clear, blood cx without growth.
Will need further w/u as outpatient once clinically stabilized.
If you develop bleeding from your mouth or rectum, dark stools, lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, go to the nearest Emergency Room for evaluation.
