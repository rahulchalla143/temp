Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] y/o full code male, resident of [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, with mechanical aortic valve secondary to Listeria endocarditis (on coumadin), Coombs positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia (warm autoantibody, on prednisone), CAD s/p NSTEMI [**7-11**], CKD stage III, chronic CHF (likely diastolic with EF 50%), and history of GIB, who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with weakness and was noted to have a hematocrit of 19 and melena on guaiac exam.
Chronic anemia with baseline Hct 25-30 secondary to warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (on prednisone, managed by heme/onc), stage III CKD, and myelodysplasia.
Acute hematocrit drop to Hct 16 was initially suspected to be from UGIB vs. LGIB given melena on guaiac exam (especially considering his history of esophageal erosions/gastritis/lymphangiectasias).
He received an upper GI endoscopy that did not reveal an active source of bleeding, a non-bleeding duodenal polyp and a small hiatal hernia were found.
Likely result of demand ischemia given acute drop in Hct, there were no ST/T changes on EKG and although his troponin level was mildly elevated on discharge, it trended down and his pain resolved with oxygen improvement of his anemia.
Goal INR 2.5-3.5.
He was found to have INR 5.9 on admission, coumadin was held and he received 5mg PO vitamin K in the ED with reversal of his INR to 2.2 in the setting of a potential GI bleed.
Due to this rapid reversal, there was suspicion that the initial INR was a laboratory error.
He will continue on heparin drip until INR is at goal 2.5-3.5.
Resolved and creatinine returned to baseline with improvement in his hematocrit and volume status.
[**Name (NI) **] will be discharged to [**Hospital1 100**] Home MACU where he will continue on heparin drip and his INR should be checked daily.
A CBC should be checked in 1 week to ensure his anemia and thrombocytopenia is stable.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 66590**], You came to the hospital because you were anemic (your blood counts were much lower than normal) and we suspected possible bleeding from your gastrointestinal tract.
You had an upper endoscopy which did not show any source of bleeding.
We are restarting your coumadin and once your INR is at goal, the heparin will be stopped.
