There is also soft tissue swelling with fluid collection in the soft tissues overlying the left frontal and the parietal bones (series 6, image 21) along with blood products.
Interval development of an area of decreased diffusion surrounding the blood products, which may relate to infarction/ischemic changes in the parenchyma.
While there is no significant abnormal enhancement to suggest an obvious residual tumor, followup evaluation can be considered to assess residual tumor, after resolution of the post-surgical changes.
