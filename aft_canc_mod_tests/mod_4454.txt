The white blood cell count appears increased.
Platelet count appears decreased; large forms are seen; giant forms are not present.
Differential count shows 1% neutrophils, 2% monocytes, 15% lymphocytes, 80% blast, 2% myelocytes.
Differential shows: 60% Blasts, 1% Promyelocytes, 3% Myelocytes, 6% Bands/Neutrophils, 1% Plasma cells, 12% Lymphocytes, 17% Erythroid.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation.
A small non-paratrabecular lymphoid aggregate comprised of small lymphocytes is present and accounts for less than 5% of the marrow cellularity.
[**2199-4-24**] FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING  The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR, Glycophorin A, Kappa, lambda; and CD antigens 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11c, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 33, 34, 41, 45, 56, 64, 71, 117.
They express immature antigens CD34, HLA-DR (subset; 56%) along with myeloid associated antigens CD33, CD117, CD11c (subset, dim) and CD71.
They lack other B and T cell associated antigens, are CD10 (cALLa) negative and are negative for CD13, CD14, CD15, CD56, CD64,  and Glycophorin A.
CT CHEST [**2199-5-24**]  There is airspace consolidation seen within the left lower lobe, is concerning for newly developed pneumonia.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
A large subset of these cells is immunoreactive for myeloperoxidase.
The white blood cell count appears markedly decreased.
Differential count shows  4% monocytes,   96% lymphocytes.
Erythroid precursors are increased and show megaloblastoid maturation.
Myeloid precursors appear decreased and show left-shifted maturation.
Differential (300 cells) shows:  1% Blasts,  2% Promyelocytes, 15% Myelocytes, 7% Metamyelocytes, 2% Bands/Neutrophils, 5% Plasma cells,  8% Lymphocytes, 56% Erythroid.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of a 1.3 cm core biopsy of trabecular bone with a variable cellularity ranging from 5-20%, overall 10%.
Bone marrow biopsy was consistent with an acute myeloid leukemia with normal cytogenetics so she was treated initially with Hydroxyurea and then with [**Doctor First Name **]/Ara-C 7+3.
A bone marrow biopsy on day 14 and day 28 demonstrated a clean bone marrow.
# Bilateral LL PNA: On admission, the patient was febrile and a CXR demonstrated a left lower lobe pneumonia, so she was placed on Cefepime & Vancomycin.
The ankle continued to be tender so an  MRI was obtained that demonstrated no hemoarthrosis, only edema and some mild tenosynovitis.
With elevation and multipodus boots, the ankle improved and the patient regained full range of motion and ability to ambulate.
Her Vancomycin infusion rate was decreased, but on day 9, the erythema progressed and she also developed a new pink papular rash along her thighs, neck, chest, behind her ears, and along her hairline.
Her rash resolved and her acral erythema faded and began to peel.
# Hyperphosphatemia: Patient was noted to have an isolated rising serum Phosphate that peaked at 6.2 on day 22.
A work-up  demonstrated a normal GGT, suggesting a bony source of Alkaline Phosphatase, but a serum Calcium was normal and the patient had a normal PTH level.
As the patient's Ca x Ph product was greater than 55, she was also started on Sevelamer on day 22 with an improvement in her serum phosphate.
Calcium 500 + D 500 mg(1,250mg) -400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
