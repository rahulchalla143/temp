Peribronchial consolidation which has developed since the prior examination are consistent with aspiration, predominantly involving the right middle lobe and the right lower lobe, but also with atelectasis at the left lower lobe.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2136-1-9**]):       4+   (>10 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary):       KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE.
* PLEURAL EFFUSIONs:  Patient had on previous admission had known bilateral pleural effusions, R>L, and had undergone thoracentesis with removal of 2L of fluid from the right pleural space consistent with an exudate which was thought at the time to be secondary to parapneumonic effusion as the patient was still being treated for MRSA/Klebsiella pneumonia.
Initially, patient underwent bedside thoracentesis, which was successful, but was only able to remove ~1.3L, secondary to loculation of the effusion.
Serosanguinous fluid, although consistent with exudative effusion was sterile.
A second attempt made under ultrasound guidance was only able to obtain 250cc of fluid, and radiologists commented upon loculations noted in the effusion, and repeat CT chest revealed continued massive pleural effusion despite initial thoracentesis.
Thoracic surgery consultants then placed a chest tube, which drained an additional 1.2 liters, yielding an additional ~2L after two administrations of intrathoracic tissue plasminogen activator.
Patient also underwent pleural biopsy which was unrevealing for a source of continued effusions.
* LACTIC ACIDOSIS/HYPOTENSION:  At the time of admission, patient's systolic blood pressure was approximately 100, which was significantly lower than his baseline, which normally required anti-hypertensives for control.
Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy, with decreased filling, as well as possible decreased filling secondary to increased intrathoracic pressure due to the large left pleural effusion.
Consistent with this, following placement of chest tube and blood transfusion, patient's blood pressures improved dramatically (to SBP 130's), lactate dropped below 1, and creatinine improved, suggesting that pleural effusion was impairing appropriate cardiac output.
* ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Serum creatinine at the time of admission was 2.2, which rose to a peak of 2.5 within the same day.
Indeed, patient's creatinine improved dramatically (1.9->1.6) following placement of chest tube and administration of blood.
This responded well to fluid boluses and blood transfusion as expected.
* ABDOMINAL ABSCESS: An air-fluid level was noted on multiple chest xrays at the time of admission, but was initially thought to be due to dilated loop of bowel on the right upper quadrant.
However, oral contrast CT did not opacify the air/fluid level, and patient underwent ultrasound guided drainage.
Ultimately, however, cultures grew out Klebsiella and vancomycin resistant Enterococci, and patient was treated with meropenem and linezolid with good effect.
Cultures remained clear throughout rest of hospital course.
