CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are several, subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes.
A small pericardial effusion is relatively unchanged in size compared to the examination four days prior.
A moderate- to large-sized hiatal hernia is also again noted.

Tagged RBC study also did not show site of bleed.
Platelets remain above 50 after many platelent transufsions.
She continued to receive prbc's nearly every other day to maintain a stable hematocrit, and she received HLA matched platelets on nearly a daily basis to maintain her platelet count over 50. .
Daily blood cultures were negative.
CT chest/Abdomen/Pelvis on [**9-24**] did not reveal a source of fevers.
CT Pelvis revealed fat stranding and questionable external iliac [**Last Name (un) **] thrombus, followup MRI showed fat stranding but no thrombus.
The patient desaturated on [**9-28**] to 78%, and CT chest showed extensive infiltrates.
Thought initially to be due to fluid overload in setting of increased platelet and prbc transfusions, and CT on [**9-24**] showing bibasilar atelectasis.
CT chest showed extensive infiltrates.
The patient's O2 saturation ranged from 89-94%, and appeared to improve with lasix administration.
Her neutrophil count slowly increased over a period of four days from 40 to 170, she remained afebrile, but her oxygenation did not improve.
