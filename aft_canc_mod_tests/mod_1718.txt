CT scan at OSH ([**Hospital1 **])demonstrated 12 x 9 cm mass, read as c/w dermoid.
Review of CT scan at [**Hospital1 18**] also demonstrated small umblical hernia w/ possible incarcerated bowel.
Under observation, pt became hypotenisve to SBP of 60, not responsive to hydration alone.
Her abdominal exam remained unchanged.
Cultures returned positive for Methicilin Sensitive Staph Aureus.
Her SICU admission was complicated by oliguria with a creatinine of 1.2 and edema, which subsequently resolved after several doses of lasix, ileus requiring prolonged NG tube placement and multiple chest X-rays to evaluate for pulmonary status.
There was concern for prolonged prothrombin time, which prompted a curb-side consult to hematology, who thought it was as a result of IV antibiotics resulting in clearing of Gut flora and subsequent vitamin K deficiency.
In addition, patient was tried to wean off oxygen and experienced a desaturation to 86% prompting a CTA, which revealed bilateral pulmonary embolisms.
Ms [**Known lastname 4553**] was discharged on post-operative day 11 to her home with VNA services twice a day in good condition, tolerating a regular diet, voiding independently, ambulating with assist but with oxygen requirement of 1L and albuterol nebulizer treatments.
Discharge Instructions: Ms [**Known lastname 4553**], you were admitted and underwent an exploratory laparatomy/ Left salpingoophorectomy of an infected dermoid cyst, herniorrhaphy, vulvar biopsy, omental biopsy and cystoscopy.
