Echo [**2106-6-17**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokiesis of the interventricular septum.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-6-2**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is increased.
Cardiac Cath [**2106-6-15**]: COMMENTS:     1.
Limited hemodynamics revealed systemic hypertension with pressures of 191/64 with HR 60 in sinus.
Successful PTCA and stnting of the RLADwith a 3.00 Cypher DES.
The final angiogram demonstrated no residual stenosis with no angiographic evidence of dissection, embolization or perforation with TIMI III flow in the distal vessel.
The cath showed a right dom.
CXR showed CHF and she was diuresed and her volume status and creatinine improved to her baseline.
She is not on a statin as a part of her outpatient regimen and it is notable that last her LDL was 65 on [**2104-12-26**].
Her symptoms of chest pain remained inactive during the hospital stay.
The recommended only slight dose adjustments in the hydrea when the creatinine bumped after the clinical decompensation noted above.
