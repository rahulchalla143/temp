During workup last admission, CXR was abnormal with bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates.
High resolution CT showed tree in [**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance in lower lobes consistant with infectious process.
Echo showed normal EF.
He had [**Name Initial (PRE) 1570**]'s checked on [**2168-4-26**], which showed FEV1 of 0.95 L. Last bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed a hypocellular marrow with a cellularity of less than 10%.
He is being admitted for further workup and possibly open lung biopsy.
weight loss, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.
He was found to have pancytopenia with a Hct of 15.
The bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed karyotype 47,XYY, and no evidence by FISH of the prior mentioned cytogenetic abnormalities.
A recent bone marrow biopsy revealed mildly hypocellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and no evidence of ALL, but cytogenetic testing revealed aneuploidy of chromosome 4 in 12% of cells.
He was admitted on [**2167-8-28**] and began repeat induction with the ECOG-2993 protocol including Daunarubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone, and L-Asparaginase with intrathecal methotrexate on day 10.
The viral testing was negative.
Given that he was scheduled to undergo an allogeneic transplant with Cytoxan and TBI conditioning, he did undergo a liver biopsy to assess the degree of fibrosis as well as inflammation prior to proceeding with transplant.
The liver biopsy showed moderate microvascular steatosis with mild bile duct injury and occasional apoptotic hepatocytes, consistent with drug injury.
However, given that his ALT was still at 200, the transplant planned for [**10-8**] was delayed until [**2167-10-29**] to try and reduce the risk of VOD.
Bone marrow bx from [**10-1**] showed markedly hypocellular marrow with early recovering trilineage hemopoesis, no residual ALL identified.
PHYSICAL EXAM: GEN: well appearing male not in respiratory distress T 98.4 HR 102 BP 118/80 RR 18 Sat 94% RA HEENT: PERRL, sclera anicteric, evidence of mucosal GVHD NECK: no cervical LAD CHEST: lungs with decreased breath sounds aat bases, better at apecies, bronchial throughout.
CT SCAN: 1.
A/P: 19 y/o M day 176 s/p ablative MUD allogenic transplant with a recent admission for SOB, now presenting with persistent symptoms for workup.
He was admitted recently for new onset DOE, workup up with bronchospopy which was negative for infectious cause, and discharged, on azithromycin for atypical PNA and atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis, with room air saturation in the mid 90's with ambulation.

CT SCAN: 1.
Tip of the left chest tube located high within the lung apex.
CXR [**5-16**]: Moderate left pneumothorax with interval increase in size since recent radiograph of one day earlier.
CTA chest 4/1:1.
[**5-13**] echo: normal chamber sizes and wall thicknesses, elevated PA systolic pressure to 36-42.
EF 65-70% .
Lung, left upper lobe, wedge biopsy (A - D): a.
Lung tissue with patchy chronic interstitial pneumonitis with accumulation of intra-alveolar macrophages.
Lung tissue with patchy organizing and focally acute pneumonitis, with accumulation of intra-alveolar macrophages.
galactomannan negative .
Last bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed a hypocellular marrow with a cellularity of less than 10%.
The lung biopsy was not pathognomonic but was consistent with GVHD of the lung, which was the presumed diagnosis.
He was started on treatment for broad infectious coverage (vanco, cefepime, levofloxacin, pentamidine later changed to atovaquone, voriconazole), including Pneumocystis pneumonia treatment, but had no improvement and in fact CXR showed progression of infiltrates, particularly on the right side.
His tachypnea continued to progress but ABGs showed that the patient was not tiring for three days of respiratory rate of 40s-50s for most of the day.
