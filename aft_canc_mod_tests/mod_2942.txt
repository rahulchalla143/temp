At the [**Hospital3 20284**] Center the pt's head CT revealed a large right putaminal hemorrhage extending posteriorly and inferiorly in the right posterior midbrain with blood in the third ventricle.
The patient was given phosphenytoin 1500mg, Ativan 2mg, Pancuronium, zofran and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Pertinent Results: Labs: Trop-T: <0.01 BUN 11, Cr 0.6 CK: 132  MB: 3 [**Doctor First Name **]: 131  MCV 98 WBC 12.4, hgb 14.7, hct 45, Platelets 134  PT: 14.1  PTT: 31.3  INR: 1.2  At OSH: UA postive for RBC's, 3+ protein.
PTT 28, INR 1.2  EKG (from OSH)- NSR with left atrial enlargement, RBBB.
<br>  Imaging: Head CT [**2121-4-4**]: FINDINGS: There is acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia measuring roughly 4 x 3 cm, which extends inferiorly into the right pons and mid brain.
<br> Head CT [**2121-4-5**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Since prior examination, there has been no significant change in the hemorrhage within the right globus pallidus extending into the midbrain.
A 5 mm vague hyperdensity is seen within the inferior brainstem (series 2, image 4), which was retrospectively present on prior exam and may represent tiny focus of blood.
<br> CXR [**2121-4-4**]: FINDINGS: Single portable supine chest radiograph is reviewed without comparison.
<br> CXR [**2121-4-6**]: SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: The nasogastric tube has been removed and Dobbhoff tube placed with tip terminating in similar location within the proximal stomach.
<br> KUB [**2121-4-9**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of ileus or obstruction <br>  CT TORSO [**2121-4-14**]: FINDINGS: The lung volumes are low.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The free fluid tracks down into the pelvis.
<br> PERITONEAL FLUID [**2121-4-15**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
<br> ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND [**2121-4-16**]: This study was done portably in the intensive care unit.
Color flow and pulse Doppler assessment was performed.
The imaged portion of the portal vein included only the right portal vein, but not the left or main portal, which were obscured or impossible to access.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 59501**] was admitted to the Neuro ICU for close monitoring and blood pressure management after diagnosis of his putamenal hemorrhage in the ED.
His blood pressure was controlled with a nicardipine gtt initially.
To improve his intracranial pressure, he was hyperventilated and treated with mannitol; his head elevation was maintained greater than 30 degrees.
Mr. [**Known lastname 59501**] was monitored with a repeat CT scan after 6 hours, which showed no change in the hemorrhage and only minimal increase in the hydrocephalus.
To investigate the cause of this ascites, a CT torso was performed (lungs were evaluated for possible pneumonia, which was not seen).
The CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed massive ascites with one large liver mass and several smaller liver nodules, consistent with a primary hepatocellular carcinoma.
The day after this CT, he underwent paracentesis for diagnostic and therapeutic measures.
His creatinine climbed as high as 2.3.
