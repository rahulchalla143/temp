CT head demonstrated a right 7mm occipital density concerning for meningioma vs. extra-axial hemorrhage.
Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin  Discharge exam unchanged from admission.
AVSS NAD symmetric chest rise MAE no focal or diffuse neuro deficits extrems wwp  Pertinent Results: CT head [**2179-8-2**] 9 mm hyperdense focus along right parieto-occipital convexity; suspect this is a small meningioma, but difficult to exclude small extra-axial hemorrhage; MR may be useful to confirm  MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**2179-8-4**] 1.
MR imaging was performed to evaluate the right temporo-parietal abormality on CT imaging.
The MRI showed 9-mm dual-based lesions arising from the right occipital convexity, adjacent to the right transverse sinus without evidence of invasion.
A formal neuro-radiology read elicited a differential diagnosis favoring meningioma, but lymphoma, sarcoid and cavernous hemangioma of the sinus could not be excluded as well.
The patient's exam was unchanged on [**2179-8-4**] and social work was consulted given the circumstances of the patient's injuries.
