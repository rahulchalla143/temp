Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
[**3-22**] CT C-spine: There is a large infiltrating paraspinal mass extending at least from the C3 level through T2, and may extend even more inferiorly.
It would be extremely helpful to have prior studies for comparison.
The possibility of superinfection in an immunocompromised patient cannot be determined on this noncontrast CT and should be correlated clinically.
Given the history of malignancy, these can be followed with CT in three months.
[**3-29**] right upper extremity ultrasound: UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLER: No prior studies are available for comparison.
[**3-29**] CT head: IMPRESSION: 1) No acute hemorrhage, mass effect, or cerebral edema.
MRI with gadolinium is suggested to evaluate for other lesions when the patient is stable.
On discharge, wbcc 2.3, hct 27, plt 37. .
C spine CT showed large infiltrating paraspinal mass from C3 to T2 and left skull base soft tissue mass.
CT sinus showed sinus opacification: fungal infx vs. tumor.
Fungal swab pending RUE U/S showed thrombophlebitis, but no DVT.
Morphine pca was started for pain control and a CT cspine was done due to increased pain requirements.
CT showed increased size of right paraspinal mass and base of skull lesion.
On [**3-29**], pt p/w episode of sudden transient nausea, dry heaves, face twitching, eyes rolling to side which initially resolved on it's own within minutes.
Pt had stat head CT which showed new 3mm right temporal lobe mass, but no change in L clivopetrous region.
Continuing to taper steroids on discharge (last decreased on [**3-24**]) and blood sugars remained elevated.
