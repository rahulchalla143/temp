HIDA can be performed for further evaluation if clinically warranted.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**10-23**]: 1.
Abd X-Ray [**10-23**]: FINDINGS: Left nephrostomy tube is present.
The core biopsy shows extensive areas of grade 3 reticulin fibrosis.
An immunohistochemical stain for CD34 highlights a focal area with increased interstitial blasts within the extensively fibrotic background, which likely represents minimal residual disease.
Compared to the previous biopsy, the current biopsy shows a marked reduction in cellularity.
Peripheral Blood Smears: Red blood cells show hypochromasia and anisopoikilocytosis with rare microcytes, red cell fragments and dacrocytes.
The white blood cell count appears markedly decreased.
A limited 25 cell differential shows   100% lymphocytes.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is fragmented, but adequate for evaluation.
The CD34 stain highlights scattered interstitial mononuclear cells within the fibrotic areas overall comprising ~10% of marrow cellularity (the remaining being lymphocytes and plasma cells).
Special Stains: Iron stain is inadequate for evaluation due to lack of spicules.
Reticulin stain shows extensive Grade 3 reticulin fibrosis.
Trichrome stain does not show any collagen fibrosis.
[**2114-11-15**] Antegrade Nephrostogram:IMPRESSION: Persistent narrowing of the distal left ureter, probably from the extrinsic compression, unchanged from the study from one month ago   Brief Hospital Course: #) AML.
She also developed diarrhea (C. diff and other stool cultures negative and symptomatically treated with immodium).
On discharge, she is to follow-up with her outpatient oncologist for a repeat bone marrow bx and further discussion of additional chemotherapy/mini transplant.
#) Abdominal pain: Patient was admitted with complaints of mild abdominal discomfort.
She was given lorazepam 1g IV for anxiety and sent for CT abd/pelvis without contrast.
She was given a 1L NS bolus with transient improvement of her blood pressure to 95/50s.
Abd CT revealed ascites and edema of the small and large bowel.
Once her blood pressure stabilized and she was aggressively diuresed.
#) Hypotension: In the setting of severe abdominal pain, she was found to have SBP in 80's, which responded well to fluid boluses.
Blood cx subsequently grew out Lactobacillus X3.
Ertapenam as QD antibiotic was discussed, but as there was no literature to support its efficacy against lactobacillus, she was discharged with VNA services to help administer her IV meropenam.
She had a antegrade nephrostogram, which revealed essentially unchanged partial obstruction of left ureter with only minimal and slow flow.
Medications on Admission: Ciprofloxacin 250mg [**Hospital1 **] Ritalin 20mg QD Citalopram 20mg QD Loratadine 20mg QD Beclonase [**Hospital1 **] Fluconazole 200mg QD Acyclovir 400mg [**Hospital1 **] Protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] Sudafed 30 mg QD Potassium 20mEq powder Fluconazole QD Prednisone 40mg (increased on Friday)  Discharge Medications: 1.
