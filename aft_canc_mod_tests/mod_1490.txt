Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis is helpful to assess for underlying infection.
ECHO [**2116-2-4**]: Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-12-25**], mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are more severe and pulmonary pressures are higher.
C.CATH Study Date of [**2116-2-11**] COMMENTS: 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three vessel coronary disease.
Venous conduit arteriography revealed widely patent SVG-LAD and SVG-OM1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed an RASP of 11 mm Hg, RVEDP of 18 mm Hg, PASP of 43 mm Hg, and PCWP of 21 mm Hg.
The cardiac output was 4.0 and the index 2.3.
CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)  [**2116-2-12**] 3:14 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-2**], there is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in this patient who has undergone a previous CABG procedure with intact sternal sutures.

He was Iron deficient by labs and given the concern for GI bleed, though stool guaiac was documented as negative, he was taken to colonoscopy and EGD, which showed no source of bleed.
Please see operative report for surgical details Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
