A lumbar spine MRI at [**Hospital3 2568**] revealed a mass in his L1 vertebral body thought to be either malignant or a hemagioma.
A subsequent PET CT on [**2191-4-22**] showed an FDG-avid mass within his T6 vertebral body causing a pathologic fracture and concern for cord compression; the L1lesions showed mild FDG-avidity.
With this finding, he was referred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where an MRI of his thoracic spine (described below) confirmed the T6 mass and showed it impinging on the spinal cord with associated edema of the cord.
Below this level, intact to pinprick, light touch but without 2 point discrimination.
Exam upon discharge [**5-8**]: T10 sensory level, motor intact   Pertinent Results: MRI T-spine [**2191-4-28**] Mass lesion of T6 which causes collapse of the vertebral body and which extends into the right anterolateral paravertebral soft tissues and posteriorly into the posterior elements and the central canal causing compression and edema of the spinal cord.
CT Torso [**2191-4-28**]: 1.
A radioisotope bone scan may be considered for further assessment of the skeleton.
ECHO [**2191-5-4**]: Suboptimal image quality.
CTA chest [**2191-5-4**]: 1)No pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, or aneurysm.
L spine C-rays [**2191-5-6**]: Two views of the lumbar spine demonstrate five non-rib-bearing lumbar-type vertebral bodies.
CXR [**2191-5-6**]: The heart size is normal.
There is minimal left apical pneumothorax that may retrospectively be seen on the prior study restricted to the very left apex.
He underwent a number of tests to including a MRI which showed a lesion of the T6 vertebral body which causes collapse of the vertebra and which extends into the anterolateral paravertebral soft tissues and posteriorly into the posterior elements and the central canal.
A CT of chest of negative was negative for any pulmonary involvement.
An oncology consult recommended biopsy and a number of lab tests.
They performed a CTA which was negative for PE, he did have a loculated effusion which contains air in the left lower lobe overlying the thoracotomy site with a small Left sided pneumothorax and partial left lower lobe collapse.
Follow up CXR on [**5-5**] saw improvement of XRay.
On [**5-8**] his HCT was 29.
EKG ordered for irregular heart rate.
