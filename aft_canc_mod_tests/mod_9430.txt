Spine and Rad onc were consulted and felt the images were stable from [**9-4**].
Of note patient not on his beta blocker for one week, and 3 units PRBC's given, though chest x-ray with no strong evidence of failure.
Coronary artery disease with a positive stress test in [**2127**] and a negative stress test in [**2135**].
EF was 60-70% in [**1-5**].
PSA ~73 at that time.
He had repeat shots in 4 and [**6-3**] and in [**7-/2138**], he had an undetectable PSA.
He did not f/u until [**6-4**], when his PSA was 3.2.
PSA on [**2139-9-3**] was 0.4.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 1.2-1.5  8.
On [**2139-7-16**], CT Lspine showed expansion  and further destruction of L3 lytic lesion with soft tissue extension on the left side.
MRI on [**2139-8-21**] was notable for metastasis to L3 vertebral body with compression and left paraspinal mass with 75% narrowing of the spinal canal at L3 level due to retropulsion and epidural mass.

Images- CT head [**9-14**]- No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect .
There is no  definite change from prior study .
CXR portable [**9-22**]- A small radiopaque band is seen just above the left costophrenic angle, likely representing focal atelectasis.
CT L-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2139-9-27**] 8:16 PM soft tissue mass at the L3 level with associated osseous destruction of the L3 vertebral body.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2139-9-27**] 8:16 PM 1.
While this is possibly degenerative, the kyphosis appears more prominent in comparison to the prior C-spine radiographs from [**2135-12-19**], and an underlying ligamentous injury is not excluded.
Clinical correlation is recommended, and further evaluation with an MRI could be obtained if indicated.
CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2139-9-27**] 8:16 PM 1.

Nodular opacity projecting over the left lung base is not evident on the chest radiograph of [**2139-10-1**].
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2139-10-4**] 3:20 PM Limited study secondary to patient motion.
L-SPINE (AP & LAT)  [**2139-10-5**] 10:43 AM 1.
Pt had fall on [**9-27**] with no evidence of bleed on CT head.
MRI/MRA  stroke protocol to be performed negative for acute bleed or stroke pathology.

Urine OSM's suggestive of SIADH, but pt appeared hypovolemic on admission with very poor PO intake.
