ECHO ([**5-10**]): Right atrium moderately dilated.
Pre-Operative Chest radiograph ([**5-10**]): 1.
Large hiatal hernia (stable)  Sestamibi Stress Test ([**5-11**]): No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes.
Cardiac perfusion ([**5-11**]): Fixed, moderate sized apical defect.
LVEF 36 %.
Carotid series ([**5-12**]): Based on peak systolic velocities, there is less than a 60% stenosis within the right internal carotid artery.
CTA neck ([**5-13**]): 54% stenosis of the proximal left internal carotid artery.
Abdominal radiograph ([**5-21**]) Probable ileus.
Chest radiograph ([**5-23**]): RUL infiltration with air bronchograms consistent with PNA.
Abdominal radiograph ([**5-25**]) normal abdominal bowel gas pattern.
Renal Ultrasound ([**5-26**])  Atrophic kidneys without evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
Chest Radiograph ([**5-27**]): progression of right upper lobe nodular opacities.
Worsening multifocal pneumonia, new at the left base  CT Abdomen & Pelvis (Oral and Intravenous contrast) ([**5-30**]): 1)No evidence of small bowel obstruction.
A large hiatal hernia was noted on the prior radiograph dated [**2169-4-8**].
Her hospital course is as follows:  Cardiovascular: Ms. [**Known lastname 67214**] cardiac work-up was significant for evidence of an old infarct (history of myocardial infarction x2) and a stress test revealing partially reversible defects in the inferior and lateral wall, possible sequelae of prior myocardial infarction with an ejection fraction of 36%.
A CTA neck showed 54% stenosis in the right internal carotid artery.
Repeat EKGs (pre-operative and post-operative) performed while inpatient showed no acute changes and were consistent with changes from prior infarcts.
During her stay, Ms. [**Known lastname 67214**] blood pressures were labile and difficult to control especially while NPO (see below).
Pulmonary: A chest radiograph taken on [**2174-5-23**] was consistent with a right upper lobe pneumonia.
Patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn, which was re-dosed to Vancomycin 1g every 24 hours and Zosyn 2.25 every 6 hours after a rising creatinine level was noted.
On transfer, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was maintaining good oxygen saturations on nasal canula and was slowly weaned to room air.
A repeat abdominal radiograph on [**5-25**] showed resolution of ileus.
A CT scan of her abdomen showed no evidence of a small bowel obstruction.
A foley catheter remained in place to monitor her urine output closely which was removed on post-operative day#14.
Her prophylactic heparin was temporarily held for evaluation of this possible GI bleed but was resumed on post op day 2.
Initially Ms. [**Known lastname 67214**] hematocrit was stable but a downward trend was noted on post op day 8 (31 -> 27.9-> 26).
Her vitals & urine output remained stable and repeat trending of her hematocrit was stable and showed minimal further decline.
Her hematocrit on day of discharge was 25.6.
Ms. [**Known lastname 67214**] stools were tested for occult blood on a daily basis and were negative throughout her stay.
An EGD was recommended for further evaluation but was decided against as Ms. [**Known lastname 67214**] respiratory status was sub-optimal and she reported that she would be unable to tolerate the procedure.
Post-operatively, blood sugars were difficult to control in the setting of an ileus and NPO status.
Renal: During her hospital stay, Ms. [**Known lastname **] developed acute on chronic renal insufficiency with a peak creatinine of 1.8 (baseline approximately 1.4).
The etiology of this acute kidney injury was thought to be secondary to the initiation of vancomycin/zosyn, IV contrast received for CT abdomen, as well as over-correction of positive volume.
A renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction.
Her creatinine trended down upon completion of antibiotics and better intake of PO fluids.
(Peak sodium of 150, normalized to 140 on day of discharge).
Gyn Oncology: Based on her final pathology results, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was diagnosed with stage 1B endometroid adenocarcinoma.
Prophylactic management included subcutaneous Heparin (temporarily held during evaluation of possible upper GI bleed), TEDs, and ambulation with physical therapy.
