Her vent on admit was C-PAP 40% FIO2, PEEP of 5, PS30, respiratory firing at 28 to 32.
Her last arterial blood gas on [**2131-6-17**] was 7.40/87/53/97% saturation on 40% FIO2.
Her [**Hospital1 **] course was as follows:  Pulmonary:  The patient was unable to tolerate weaning from a pressure support of 30 with attempts to decrease by 2 cm q. three to four days.
Her systolic blood pressures ranged from the 90s to the 100s.
Her EKG showed no changes.
She had a junctional rhythm in [**2131-2-16**].
Cardiomyopathy which has left her with an ejection fraction of 20%.
On examination she was awake, alert and pleasant.
LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 17.1, hematocrit 38.6, 453 platelets, differential of the white count showed 87% polys, no bands, 6 lymphocytes.
Sodium 126, potassium 4.8, 71 chloride, 35 bicarbonate, 41 BUN, 0.5 creatinine, 94 glucose.
On [**5-29**], she had a cortisol that was 13.4 at 07:00 a.m., 40.9 at 10:00 a.m.
Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 118 with a left axis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 37 year old woman with multiple pulmonary problems including a history of a left pneumonectomy, cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%; chronic hypercapnia, who was admitted for a wean from her ventilator.
[**Known firstname 1356**] had a tracheostomy revision on [**2131-7-2**], and was found to have a posterior tracheal ulcer that was very early a TE fistula.
She had a temperature tracheostomy (6 F ETT via stoma) and was changed finally to a permanent tracheostomy on [**2131-7-12**].
A recent bronchoscopy has shown that her ulcer has healed.
CARDIAC:  [**Known firstname 1356**] has a history of biventricular congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy which brings her ejection fraction to 20%.
[**Known firstname 30613**] resting pulse rate ranges from 100 to 120 in sinus tachycardia and any decrease from or increase from this resting heart rate sends her into respiratory distress and decompensation.
Her dry weight is about 115 to 120 pounds.
Her weight had increased to 124 over the past week and her Lasix dose was increased from 60 p.o.
Her Zaroxolyn was kept at 2.5 mg twice a day.
[**Known firstname 1356**] is very sensitive to large fluctuations in her potassium, which is volatile on diuretics, and given her constipation.
Her junctional bradycardia was quickly resolved with calcium gluconate, insulin, glucose, bicarbonate, nebulizers and Kayexalate.
After the calcium carbonate was given, her heart rhythm returned back to her baseline sinus tachycardia.
For these reasons, it is important to keep her potassium from 3.0 to 4.5.
She should have a digoxin level checked prior to being discharged.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  As stated above, the patient has a volatile potassium level.
Her dry weight is 115 to 120 pounds and she requires daily weights.
She has a large dead space and a Vv/Vt ratio of 0.8.
These had exacerbated her constipation, which resulted in potasium levels up to 7.9 and junctional bradycardic rhythm that sent her into respiratory distress.
She then started to have an increasing white blood count and her inhaled Tobramycin was restarted and she was eventually levelled off on a TIW regimen three times a week for this inhaled Tobramycin.
DISPOSITION:   Her disposition will be first to CC7 Floor where her potassium levels and diuresis will be maintained and hopefully titrated to keep her at her goal weight of 115 to 120 pounds and keep her potassium levels between 3.0 and 4.5.
She will have home [**Hospital6 407**] to monitor her potassium levels and to care for her G-tube and she will have respiratory therapy, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy also perhaps at home.
