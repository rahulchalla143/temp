MICROBIOLOGIC DATA: [**2155-4-9**] MRSA screen - pending .
IMAGING STUDIES: [**2155-4-8**] CT HEAD AND NECK W/ & W/O CONTRAST - No focal enhancing lesion to suggest metastasis, although contrast-enhanced MRI would be more sensitive for small metastatic lesions.
Further assessment could be performed by MRI, if warranted and feasible.

[**2155-4-9**] 2D-ECHO - pending   Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: [**Age over 90 **]F with PMH significant for hypertension and hypothyroidism who presented with nasal congestion, post-nasal drip and serous otitis media found to have large nasopharyngeal mass (now s/p nasal endoscopy with biopsy and bilaterally myringotomy and tube placement) biopsy-proven lymphoma who was referred to the ED for further evaluation and management with stable oxygen saturations and no clinical evidence of airway obstruction.
The patient presented with newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal lymphoma referred from home by her ENT surgeon (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3878**] given the mass burden of her tumor and her symptoms of left facial and ear pain.
After discussion with Hematology-Oncology, we continued steroids, discharged her home with clinic follow-up after a staging CT and 2D-Echo performed prior to discharge.
At the time of discharge, the patient had a 2D-echocardiogram and CT abdomen pending.
Your oxygen levels remained stable, you were treated with oral steroids and had imaging to further stage your malignancy.
