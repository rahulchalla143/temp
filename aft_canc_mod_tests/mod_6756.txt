The prenatal history includes mother was a 46- year-old female with prenatal labs significant for blood type A+, antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, and GBS unknown.
Apgar scores for this patient at birth were 7 and 8.
Birth weight of this patient was 1480 g, which was the 75th percentile.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:  The patient's weight at discharge on [**2145-3-16**], was 3015 g. The most recent length was on [**1-13**] and was 47.5 cm.
The head circumference on [**2145-3-14**], was 34.5 cm.
Lung exam was significant for clear lungs bilaterally with good aeration.
The abdominal exam was significant for normal bowel sounds.
The GU exam was significant for bilateral descended testicles and a circumcised penis.
This patients neurologic exam was significant for a normal Moro and suck reflex.
A soft systolic     murmur was noted in late [**Month (only) 956**].
An echocardiogram was     done on [**2145-2-8**], and showed no significant patent     ductus arteriosis.
This patient also had a cardiac MRI performed on [**2145-3-11**].
This cardiac MRI was performed because, as will be     described soon, the infant was diagnosed with multiple     liver hemangiomas.
A cardiac MRI was done to evaluate     the function and flow through the heart.
The cardiac MRI     was also performed to evaluate for evidence of congestive     heart failure related to potential high output failure     from the liver hemangiomas.
It was noted during this     cardiac MRI that there were normal biventricular size and     global systolic function.
Again this study was done at a baseline.
A KUB was performed     that showed no free air.
The belly and GU exam also     revealed scrotal swelling.
The patient was then sent to     [**Hospital3 1810**] [**Location (un) 86**] for evaluation of a potential     incarcerated hernia.
His hematocrit prior to the transfusion was     27.2.
A post-transfusion hematocrit was not obtained.
A head ultrasound on [**1-19**]     was normal.
Head ultrasound on [**1-29**] showed mild     asymmetry with the lateral ventricles in the left     greater than the right.
The most recent head ultrasound     performed on [**2145-3-12**], prior to discharge, revealed     a small left-sided germinal matrix hemorrhage.
The systolic blood pressures     occassionally were in the high 90s and low 100s.
A     work-up was performed for this.
Urine     electrolytes were normal.
On the day of discharge, the     patient's blood pressure was 80/40 with a mean arterial     pressure of 56.
We talked with the renal     fellow on-call prior to discharge, and this person agreed     that baby [**Name (NI) 76583**] could be followed clinically with     blood pressure checks in the outpatient pediatric office     given that his systolic blood pressures were not     consistently elevated.
This patient did have a liver MRI which     further documented the size and function of the liver     masses.
Flow studies were performed on     [**2145-3-11**], at [**Hospital3 1810**] [**Location (un) 86**].
10.GU: This patient also had a circumcision performed on     [**2145-3-3**].
11.Sensory: A hearing screen was performed prior to     discharge and the patient passed.
First exam was on [**2-10**] which showed     immature retina in zone 2, follow- up in 2 weeks.
The     follow-up exam on [**3-2**] revealed immature retina in     zone 3.
Most recent glucose was 104 on [**2145-3-15**].
This patient did have a car seat screen and passed prior     to discharge.
Newborn screening: This patient had multiple newborn     screens sent during his hospitalization - [**2145-1-14**], [**2145-1-20**],     [**2145-2-20**], and [**2145-3-14**].
The last three studies were all within     normal limits.
Nephrology consultation is recommended if persistently high blood pressures were to develop.
