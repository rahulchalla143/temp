He reports that he was in clinic on [**4-16**] for blood transfusion and was noted to have slight elevation in temperature to ~100.
During this treatment course his WBC, HCT, and PLTs have been noted to be decreasing to WBC of 1.5, HCT of 24.8, and PLT of 28 in clinic today.
In the ED, initial temp 101.8 and systolic BP in the 120s; however, blood pressure began to drop despite 4L of fluid boluses.
Blood culture obtained.
No EKG was performed in the ED.
Review of sytems: (+) fever, recent weight loss (-) chills, night sweats, headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea, or congestion.
Imaging studies performed at [**Hospital6 2561**] demonstrated metastatic bone lesions in the left acetabulum and an L1 laminar lesion with mass effect on the thecal sac, but no primary mass was seen within the abdomen/pelvis.
A bone scan on [**2147-5-5**] showed activity in the left acetabulum, right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**], L1 vertebra, and left ribs.
Of note, a cervical spine MRI and brain MRI performed in [**2146**] had demonstrated degenerative changes and spondylosis but no metastatic disease.
On [**2147-5-18**], a biopsy of right iliac bony lesion demonstrated plasmacytoma.
By immunohistochemistry, the plasma cells were CD138 positive, kappa restricted by immunoglobulin light chain staining (confirmed by in-situ hybridization for immunoglobulin light chains).
Lambda stain was essentially negative.
An SPEP performed on [**5-29**] demonstrated monoclonal IgA kappa, with quantitative Ig levels showing IgG 829, IgA 1899, IgM 122.
A beta2 microglobulin level was 3.7.
A bone marrow biopsy performed on [**5-30**] showed a mildly hypercellular bone marrow for age with trilineage hematopoiesis and an atypical plasma cell infiltrate consistent with involvement by plasma cell myeloma.
- Diagnosed with a colon mass by screening colonoscopy in [**2143**] - Status post right colectomy with 0/22 LN involved.
Polymyalgia rheumatica, treated in [**2140**] with prednisone.

The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-1-4**], the detected pulmonary artery systolic pressure (RA pressure + TR gradient) has increased.

Contaminated blood product was considered, but less likely (see below).
Never had definitive evidence of UTI (U/A negative but no urine culture sent) but did get 3 days of Ciprofloxacin.
Irradiated, leuko-reduced blood products he received in clinic were cultured by the blood bank, but showed no source organism.
He was eventually transferred to the floor once his blood pressures were stable.
Plain films showed no evidence of multiple myeloma or acute fracture.
