After receiving 15.5 units of blood, patient suddenly developed chills, rigors, and a temperature of 99F.
His symptoms resolved and he was transferred to the ICU for further monitoring; he was transferred back to the medicine floor within 24 hours.
Pathology investigation was most consistent with a febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction.
Following RBC exchange, patient's parasitemia percentage remained stable at 0.8% for the remainder of his hospitalization.
Although leukocytosis persisted until discharge, the level remained stable and was most likely attributed to a reaction to steriods or an inflammatory response to RBC exchange.
Simultaneously, the patient's liver enzymes continued to trend upwards to a maximum ALT 150 and AST 104.
