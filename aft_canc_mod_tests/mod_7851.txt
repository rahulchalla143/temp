CXR was read as normal.
She presented to [**Hospital6 33**] with these complaints and CBC showed thrombocytopenia to 15 as well as lymphocytosis.
There was initially concern for ITP or rickettsial infection, but peripheral blood was sent for flow cytometry, which reportedly showed lymphoblasts.

They lack T-associated antigens (CD3, CD5, CD2, CD7, CD4, CD8) and are negative for myeloid associated antigens CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD117, CD11c, CD41, CD56, CD64 and Glycophorin A.  CD45 bright lymphocytes comprise 24% of total analyzed events.
Note: The morphologic findings on this core biopsy specimen combined with concurrent flow cytometry findings on peripheral blood (S11-33319M) are consistent with the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B-ALL).
Erythrocytes appear mildly decreased in number, are normochromic with rare dacryocytes, echinocytes, fragments,  microcytes and nucleated red blood cells noted.
The white blood cell count appears mildly increased.
A majority of circulating cells are variably sized, with moderately condensed to open chromatin, prominent nuclei, round to slightly irregular nuclear contours, scant amounts of basophilic cytoplasm and occasional coarse granules.
Platelet count appears significantly decreased.
Differential shows 12% neutrophils, 20% lymphocytes, 68% Blasts.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
A cardiac CT scan or MRI is recommended for further imaging of this abnormality.
CT chest [**8-16**]: IMPRESSION:  1.
No CT evidence of an extrinsic compression on the atrium/right ventricle.
A cardiac CT scan or MRI is recommended for further imaging of this abnormality.

Activated AT and fibrinogen levels were monitored and remained within normal limits.
Patient's neutrophil count dropped with therapy but recovered.
She was discharged on day 20 of the protocol having regained her cell counts to a granulocyte count of 1205.
CT showed potential area of leukemic infiltrate in the right mediastinum.
Transitions in Care: Patient was given a follow-up appointment 2 days post-discharge for IV chemotherapy and blood work, and given an appointment on [**2131-9-14**] for further chemo and BM biopsy.
