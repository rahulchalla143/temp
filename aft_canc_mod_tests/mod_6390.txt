CXR ([**6-3**]): PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged, with prominent left mediastinal fat pad.
MICRO: Blood cx [**6-3**]: NGTD Urine cx [**6-3**]: >100K lactobacillus Legionella Ag [**6-4**]: negative Sputum: viral neg  Bone Marrow Biopsy pending  Brief Hospital Course: 40 yo female with metastatic NSCLC on dexamethasone for brain mets, and recent admission for PE returned with febrile neutropenia.
BP settled in 95-105 systolic.
The suddent onset could be compatible with influenza, however her urine cx showed >100K lactobacillus which is likely cotamination.
Her CXR showed no evidence of infection.
Once her counts rose with an ANC > 500 these were stopped and she was started on cefpodoxime to complete a 7-day course.
Patient's bactrim was stopped on [**5-18**] and her counts were found to be depressed on the next lab check she had after starting the bactrim.
She underwent a bone marrow biopsy [**6-4**] and these results were pending at the time of discharged.
By time of discharge her ANC had rose to 1216 and WBC was 1.9.
# Anemia: Hct was 19.5 on admission, though no obvious signs of bleeding.
Though there was abnormalities on her differential, there was otherwise no obvious sign of hemolysis.
Iron studies showed anemia of chronic disease and vitamin B12 and folate have recently been normal.
A topiramate level was sent on [**6-7**] and was pending at time of discharge.
# EKG with inf/lateral TWI: Admission EKG showed TWI, but she had no clinical evidence of ischemia.
An echo was without evidence of wall motion abnormalities.
# Recent PE: Patient was recently diagnosed with bilateral PEs on [**5-23**] and is on lovenox.
# CODE: FULL CODE   Medications on Admission: Lovenox 90mg [**Hospital1 **] Dexamethasone 1mg daily Erlotinib 100mg daily Neurontin 300mg TID Levetiracetam 500mg [**Hospital1 **] Ibuprofen prn Tylenol prn  Discharge Medications: 1.
