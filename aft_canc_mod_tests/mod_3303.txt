He had a CT scan after this which showed a 1.5 cm gastrohepatic lymph node.
On [**2143-8-28**] he underwent an upper endoscopy on which they saw distal esophageal narrowing.
The biopsy showed moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
After this he underwent endoscopic ultrasound, however, they were unable to pass the ultrasound probe beyond the stricture.
He had liver lesions noted on a CT scan [**2145-1-16**].
He had these biopsied on [**2145-1-27**] and the pathology came back as consistent with metastasis from esophageal cancer.

CXR [**6-3**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increasing opacity at the left lung base, combined with a newly appeared blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, presumably due to effusion.
CT chest [**6-4**]: 1.
Further evaluation with dedicated CT enterography of the abdomen and pelvis may be obtained for further evaluation.
TTE [**6-8**]: No vegetations seen (suboptimal-quality study).
RUE U/S [**6-8**]: DVT involving the right distal brachial vein, as well as the cephalic vein.
CXR [**6-9**]: Compared to [**6-3**], there is more opacification in the left lower lobe, which could be worsening atelectasis or pneumonia particularly due to recent aspiration.
MICRO [**6-1**] blood cx: Strep Pneumoniae  Brief Hospital Course: 1.
Cultures were sent and he was started on empiric cefepime.
Imaging suggested a LLL pneumonia, and blood cultures grew GPC, for which vancomycin was added.
TTE showed no vegetations.
No further blood cultures were positive, and his antibiotics were eventually narrowed to ceftriaxone alone for a 14 day course, starting at the resolution of neutropenia.
Acute renal failure: Despite normal creatinine at 1.0, this essentially doubled from low baseline of 0.4-0.7 and BUN/creatinine 36.
Early in the admission, he had some hematochezia, so was transfused plts to keep his count over 30,000.
Stool studies were negative.
CT abdomen showed some bowel edema, but no diverticulitis.
A CT chest done a few days later noted some transverse colitis, although he was asymptomatic.
His hematocrit was stable prior to discharge.
He also had an elevated INR that was likely nutritional, and improved with vitamin K.

We also started enoxaparin (Lovenox), a blood thinner, due to a blood clot found in your arm veins.
