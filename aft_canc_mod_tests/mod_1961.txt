Computerized axial tomography scan of her head as well as an magnetic resonance imaging scan performed in [**Month (only) 216**] showed a 3 cm left frontal and a left parietal metastases.
A computerized axial tomography scan of the chest performed on [**2140-7-27**] showed a mass in the left lower lobe.
Following further workup there was no evidence of further metastatic disease and given the patient's young age, the Oncology Division as well as the Thoracic Surgery staff felt that the patient's survival may benefit from surgical resection of the lung mass.
An emergent computerized axial tomography scan of her head was obtained which revealed a large area of hemorrhage in the right temporal and parietal region.
A Neurosurgery consultation was requested and the patient was emergently taken to the Operating Room for evacuation of the hematoma.
The patient was on Dilantin and Decadron as well as the Nitroprusside drip for blood pressure control.
The bronchoscopy revealed that her left lower lobectomy stump site was intact with no bleeding.
A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and specimens were sent for cultures.
The site was immediately dressed appropriately and a chest x-ray performed which revealed no evidence of pneumothorax.
Following the removal of the chest tubes, the patient had a chest x-ray which revealed a significant pneumothorax.
However, the patient did not cooperate much with the examination and it was believed that she could tolerate thin liquids and pureed foods under strict supervision while upright.
Her white count had been stable in the 14 to 15 range during the four days prior to discharge but on [**2-23**], her white count had dropped to 10.3.
