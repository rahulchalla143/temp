EGD done this morning: Gastritis in the stomach.
If pt bleeds briskly, pt might need bleeding scan or CTA and embolization.

Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  Bilateral lower extremity duplexes:  1.
Hip X-ray [**6-13**]: 1.
The fracture lines are still visible.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**6-14**]): The imaged lung bases are clear with minimal bibasilar atelectasis without focal nodularity, pleural or pericardial effusion.
The pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable with scattered hypodensities in the spleen also too small to characterize but likely cysts or hemangiomata.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Bladder, uterus and rectum are unremarkable.
Lateral plate and screw fixation is seen of right distal femoral fracture without hardware or cement related complication.
Fracture lines are still evident without callus formation and slight displacement of small fracture fragments is noted.
Her Hct was 31 on her presentation to the ED, which had fallen from her baseline Hct of 40.
A suspicious diverticulum was clipped and the bleeding stopped.
Following colonoscopy, HCT remained stable and the patient was transferred to the medical floor.
The patient was transfused 3 additional units PRBCs and underwent angiogram to elucidate the source of bleeding.
Her CXR shows pleural edema/effusion.
Her oxygen saturation improved upon receiving 5mg IV torsemide.
Patient should have electrolytes checked on [**6-22**].
If creatinine still stable at 1.8, torsemide should be increased to home dose of 50 mg PO daily.
Given recent catheterization there was concern for pseudoaneuysm at site of R. femoral catheterization or RP bleed given R. hip pain.
CT hip/pelvis showed no evidence of bleed.
Pain was treated symptomatically wtih Tramadol.
Urine culture returned negative.
Her ARF was likely [**12-21**] pre-renal in context of blood loss.
However, she had a second episode of acute on chronic kidney disease after her angiogram for the second GI bleed.
The patient should have a follow-up creatinine drawn on [**6-22**].
# Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate was in 50's on admission due to delayed atenolol metabolism in the setting of acute kidney failure.
She underwent bilateral lower extremity duplexes that showed right lower extremity DVT and left superficial femoral thrombosis.
Her arm became enlarged, but her distal pulses were intact.
Patient should have electrolytes checked on [**6-22**].
If creatinine still stable at 1.8, torsemide should be increased to home dose of 50 mg PO daily.
Calcium 600 + D(3) 600 mg(1,500mg) -400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Americare at Home Inc  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary:  Lower GI Bleed, Deep Vein thrombosis, Clostridium difficle Secondary:  DM2, CKD (chronic kidney disease) stage 4, chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You also received plasma transfusions to correct your INR from coumadin use.
You were started on a heparin drip for the blood clots, but unfortunately, your GI bleed returned.
We stopped the heparin drip, and your bleeding continued.
We did not find a concerning source for your pain, either on hip x-ray or CT scan of your hip.
