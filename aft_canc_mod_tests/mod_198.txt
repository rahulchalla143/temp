Cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel CAD with mild LV systolic dysfunction (LAD 70% ostial stenosis, RCA Mid 90% stenosis, OM 70% proximal lesion).
After his return the patient saw his cardiologist who performed and nuclear stress test which showed inducible ischemia with minmal activity in LAD/RCA distribution.

Mild (1+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Conclusions Pre-procedure: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
Biventricular systolic function was preserved and similar to pre-procedure.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) primarily secondary to postoperative septal dyssynchrony.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-3-5**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is reduced.
He had known 3vessel coronary artery disease and had a cardiac catheterization on [**2157-1-17**] at an outside facility.
He tolerated the operation well, following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
He was cleared for discharge to home on POD 7 per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] with VNA services and follow up wound check on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 on Friday [**2157-3-18**].
