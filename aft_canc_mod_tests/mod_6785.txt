After a few hours at rehab, she experienced RVR with HR 170s, RR 40s; was reportedly hypotensive but alert and responsive.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], her SBP was initially in the 80s with HR in the 100s.
SBP then dropped to the 70s as she went into RVR with HR 170s.
Torso CT again showed large pleural effusions with large R lung base mass invading liver.
Head CT was unremarkable.
Vascular surgery was consulted and deemed the leg wound ok. Cardiology performed bedside echo that showed no RV strain.
By the time of transfer to the MICU, her HR 90, BP 110/palp.
Wound cultures grew MRSA, and she was discharged to home to a nursing home with TMP/SMX.
CT showed a large right lung base mass invading the liver, concerning for recurrence of lung cancer.
An MRI of her brain was performed, which was negative for acute pathology, including metastatic disease or stroke.
With increased PO intake, her urine output then reportedly improved to 100 cc over 6 hours.
On [**5-2**], the patient had a brief episode of afib with HR in the 160s that broke with metoprolol.
Her rhythm returned to sinus until discharge on [**2170-5-3**].
