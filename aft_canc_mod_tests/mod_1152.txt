CT torso: CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: The pulmonary arteries appear patent to the subsegmental levels.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Liver hypodensities are unchanged.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is seen within a decompressed bladder.
Compared to the prior radiograph, there may be increased opacification within the mid lung fields bilaterally, and underlying infection cannot be completely excluded.
