At Rehab, she was noted to be in afib RVR 140s with HR 120-150, SBP 100-115/40-50, 20, 97 room air.
On readmission, she was given a bolus of 150mg IV amiodarone given with minimal response (rate in 120s, SBP 90).
Cardiac U/S showed pericardial fluid.
She was given Cipro and fluconazole in the ED, and then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring and further management of low BP and Afib/RVR.
An echo showed pericardial effusion with no evidence of tamponade.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2144-6-22**] for evaluation of abdomenal distention in the setting of recent dx of pericardial effusion and iron def anemia.
CT on admission showed pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade.
Pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] produced 510mL of serosanguinous fluid with predominantly lymphocytes, a few mesothelial cells and blood but no malignant cells.
Given these findings a full malignancy work-up was done.
CT torso ([**2144-7-6**]) showed diffuse lymphadenopathy, diffuse colonic thickening and incresing abdominal distention which was thought to be functional by both radiology and GI, and was relieved by rectal tube.
FNA biopsy of a left axillary lymph node on [**2144-6-30**] was non diagnostic.
Excisional LN biopsy of a L supraclavicular LN showed classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Her labs at that time showed WBC 12.6 with 98% PMN and 2% Ly, Hb 8.3, HCT 28.1, PLT 472K, ESR 107 and Albumin 3.0.
CTA chest was negative for PE but did reveal a mass compressing SVC.
On [**2144-7-24**] she became more somnolent with ABG showing PCO2 of 81.
A thoracocentesis drained 1.6L of fluid which showed "many small lymphocytes and scattered reactive mesothelial cells."
The fluid culture and Gram stain were sterile.
- Xfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**7-25**] for AFib with RVR and hypotension with pulse 160s and SBP to 80s.
Her BP stabilized while in sinus.
Her pulsus was recorded as 4 but she did have pulmonary congestion and distended neck veins.
An echo was obtained which showed RV and RA collapse w tamponade physiology.
- On [**2144-8-24**], cardiac surgery was urgently consulted following the echo that revealed significant pericardial effusion and right ventricular collapse.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY - Nodular sclerosing hodgkin's disease s/p ICE - h/o pericardial effusion s/p drainage; path/cytology inconclusive - h/o paroxysmal a-fib w/ RVR s/p pericardiocentesis; no anticoagulation 2/2 blood pericardial effusion - Mental retardation of unknown etiology.
- DJD - Bilateral knock knees (talus valgus, pes planus).
Pulses: Right: DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: DP 2+ PT 2+ Neuro: CN II-XII grossly intact, moving all 4 ext spontaneously, follows commands.

She was not hemodynamically unstable, but her atrial fibrillation was quite difficult to control and her rate didn't decrease despite multiple doses of IV metoprolol.
After extubation for improved respiratory status, patient was restarted on her low dose metoprolol with hold parameters for heart rate and blood pressure.
Late in her hospital stay, while stable, an EKG demonstrated a long QT interval >500.
CT chest was obtained and showed new left upper lobe infiltrate as well as large pleural effusions bilaterally.
In the weeks prior to discharge, Ms. [**Known lastname 78644**] oxygen saturation remained 92-95% on room air, and she was apparently comfortable.
Repeat chest xray showed persistent bilateral pleural effusions that were stable.
Pt has also had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] and pericardial window on [**2143-7-25**] as above.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course #1: On arrival to the ICU, pt was in acute respiratory distress with sats in 70s.
ETT was placed successfully, no issues with hypotension.
Exacerbating her pulmonary pathology was fluid overload, and a goal of 1-2L negative/day was set to relieve the pulmonary edema complicating her clinical status.
The patient tolerated this well however within a short time after being reintubated her blood pressure dropped and she spiked a fever.
The patient was pan-cultured; her blood cultures remained negative, her sputum grew out yeast as did her urine.
She was maintained on her prophylactic antibiotics and broad coverage while her cultures were pending.
Her heart rate was also found to be quite labile, ranging from 40-140s within one day's time, while maintaining stable blood pressures and remaining asymptomatic.
She was retarted on metoprolol PO once her blood pressure could tolerate.
Patient was initially on shovel mask and face mask and with thoracentesis, agressive chest PT was able to be transitioned back to 2L NC which was her baseline on previous [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] discharge.
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO four times a day: Please hold for SBP <100, HR <50.
Diltiazem HCl 90 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QID (4 times a day): Please hold for SBP <100, HR <50.
