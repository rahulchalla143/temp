Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-1-7**] QRS voltage is decreased, bradycardia is present.
Radiology Report CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2151-9-1**] 4:06 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
TTE Done [**2151-9-2**] at 9:36:56 AM IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular size and function.
Radiology Report LUNG SCAN Study Date of [**2151-9-3**] IMPRESSION: Low likelihood ration for recent pulmonary embolism.
VQ scan was obtained which showed no evidence of PE and no evidence of tamponade on echo.
Acute Renal Failure: The patient had chronic kidney disease due to hypertension, with a baseline creatinine of 1.5-2 since [**6-15**].
Urine studies gave evidence of ATN with muddy brown casts.
Renal ultrasound demonstrated left sided hydronephrosis and this was ultimately felt to be due to a left sided pelvic mass.
The last creatinine was documented as 1.7 .
Repeat urine cultures were negative.
Blood smear showed toxic granulations, but only evidence of infection was UTI.
CT ABD/pelvis (w/o contrast) did not show evidence of inflammation/abscess.
Pain Control/Goals of care/End of Life:  The patient had extensive bony metastases from her cervical cancer and she had an established pain control regimen as an outpatient.
However, this was discontinued on admission most likely due to concerns for her blood pressure.
The pain and palliative care service was consulted for assistance managing the balance between mental clarity, pain control and blood pressure.
