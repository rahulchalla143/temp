Hematology/oncology - The patient presented with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia by bone marrow biopsy done prior to admission.
Subsequent day fourteen bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of leukemia suggesting successful induction therapy.
On [**2110-1-6**], she was noted to have direct antibody test positivity.
On [**2110-1-17**], bone marrow biopsy was done by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**] to assess the patient's response to chemotherapy course.
The pathology results did show no evidence of leukemia.
Her fevers markedly increased despite change in medication and her Aztreanam was changed to Meropenem for gram positive gram negative anaerobic coverage in addition to Vancomycin and AmBisome.
A CAT scan of the chest done on that day did reveal a right lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
Recommendations for viral antigen testing were made.
In addition to their initial recommendation for CT of the torso, they recommended altering her antibiotic course to include Vancomycin, Aztreonam and Flagyl.
All cultures during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay were unrevealing of a bacterial infectious cause to her fevers.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was started with a neutropenic diet and nutrition consultation was obtained.
Her electrolytes were monitored closely and repleted aggressively.
She was noted to have transaminase elevation up to mid 300s for AST and ALT between [**2110-1-4**], and [**2110-1-12**].
Hepatitis CMV and EBV serology testing were unrevealing.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound on [**2110-1-13**], showed a heterogeneous liver of nonspecific appearance.
Stool studies did not support this diagnosis, however, and the patient was continued on Flagyl and then discharged on a course of Vancomycin p.o.
On [**2110-1-8**], the consultation service made further recommendations for Clobetasol for seven to ten days for ongoing rash and for Hydrocortisone 2.5% for the face, ears and other sensitive areas.
Bronchoalveolar lavage was done during the patient's Intensive Care Unit stay.
On [**2110-1-10**], she was extubated without complication and she remained on three liters for several days and was slowly improved to adequate saturation in room air by [**2110-1-16**].
Cardiovascular - An echocardiogram of the heart was done on [**2110-1-8**], which showed an ejection fraction of greater than 75% and left ventricular systolic function was hyperdynamic, 1+ mitral regurgitation was observed, 1 to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation was observed, pulmonary artery systolic hypertension was noted, and a small pericardial effusion was seen.
RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP:  The patient was advised to keep her follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] on Tuesday, [**2110-1-21**], at 2:00 p.m. to discuss any medication changes and to discuss biopsy results.
