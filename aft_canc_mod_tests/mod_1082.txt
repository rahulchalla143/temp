LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 13.5, hematocrit 38.5, platelets 118, 70% neutrophils, 22% lymphocytes.
Sodium 125, potassium 3.2, chloride 90, HCO3 22, BUN 36, creatinine 1.6, glucose 113.
EKG with left bundle branch block.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs with temperature at 95.9 F.; 66; 100/47; 10; 100% on two liters.
The patient came from the Operating Room with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain routed to the left scrotum and a second [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain to the right pelvis.
Postoperatively, the patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation and an EKG showed T waves in V2 and V3, lead III and lead AVF.
Postoperatively, the patient had three sets of cardiac enzymes and ruled out for a myocardial infarction; however, the patient continued in ventricular fibrillation.
His potassium continued to drop periodically, being 3.4 on postoperative day two, for which he was repleted.
His BUN was 25 and his creatinine was 1.1.
A Cardiology consultation was obtained and they found that the atrial fibrillation and left bundle branch block were new on this admission.
They suggested an increase in beta blockers and a TSH level and Coumadin with a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0 when safe.
The patient's TSH came back at 6.1 and the patient was therefore started on oral Levothyroxine.
An echocardiogram was also obtained which showed an left ventricular ejection fraction of 25 to 30% with hypo and akinesis of several walls, suggestive of coronary artery disease.
On postoperative day five the patient had a benign abdominal examination and reported flatus.
On postoperative day five, the patient was transferred to the Cardiac Service for further work-up of his ischemic cardiomyopathy.
