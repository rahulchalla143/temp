She then had a chest CT scan which showed multiple pleural based nodules with a large left pleural effusion and numerous bony lytic lesions.
She also had a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis which showed additional bony lesions.
She underwent repeat thoracentesis with 100 cc of bloody exudative fluid removed.
The patient underwent a left sided pleurodesis which she initially tolerated well.
She underwent a biopsy of her left anterior chest wall which was sent for pathological analysis and showed an undifferentiated carcinoma.
The patient was given Narcan with improvement in her blood gas.
The patient's blood gas was consistent with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
A repeat chest x-ray did show reaccumulation of her pleural effusions.
On [**4-14**], the patient complained of increasing subjective dyspnea although her saturations remained stable and she had no evidence of hypoxia or hypercarbia on her blood gases.
Chest x-ray did show interval increases in her pleural effusions.
The subsequent blood gases showed no abnormality.
Should her mental status deteriorate, it is recommended that a head CT scan be obtained to look for central nervous system metastases, in which case she might benefit from palliative steroids.
However, her calcium again trended up and she was given pamidronate 60 mg intravenously times one on [**3-16**].
Her calcium normalized after this and it is recommended that her serum calcium levels be monitored and she be observed for any evidence of hypocalcemia.
Her blood pressure quickly normalized and she was weaned off the dopamine drip.
She was stable for several days and in fact hypertensive, however, on the evening of [**3-16**], the patient acutely dropped her blood pressure and had to be placed on a Dopamine drip.
An ultrasound was obtained which was negative for any deep venous thrombosis.
HYPERNATREMIA:  The patient was hypernatremic to a serum sodium of 146 on [**3-17**], thought to be hypovolemic with free water deficit.
However, in the setting of her pleural effusions and respiratory distress, the decision was made to monitor her sodium for now.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient admitted in a state of malnutrition.
Her electrolytes were followed and repleted as needed.
