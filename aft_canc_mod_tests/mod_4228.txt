Her temp was 100.5 and given her cough she was thought to have a bacterial infection and was given augmentin 10 day course, and 4 day course of prednisone 40mg daily.
Of note in [**2168**] atenolol was attempted to be reduced to 37.5 and amlodipine was added at 2.5mg.
This caused her to have symptoms of lightheadedness and a holter revealed runs of A-tach (question flutter).
In the ED initial vital signs were:  96.2 148 104/80 18 90% 2L L.  Her exam was significant for tachycardia.
A chest X-ray showed "Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement with mild right basilar atelectasis".
A CT of the abdomen showed diffuse colitis.
Her abdominal exam was benign so surgery was not consulted.
On transfer vital signs were: 97.4 128 112/90 20 99Ra 18:45 VS 97.4 R -138-112/90-20-99% RA.
Last ETT in 6/94: non-diagnostic.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Anterolisthesis of L3 over L4 and L4 over L5.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 82 year old female with multiple medical problems including CAD, AS, [**Name (NI) 17584**] who presents with diarrhea in the setting of antibiotics for a UTI and found to be dehydrated and tachycardic.
On CT in ED patient was found to have pan-colitis and had elevated lactate of 5.7.
# Diarrhea: In ED patient had CT consistent showing pan colitis, which was thought secondary antibiotic associated diarrhea vs inflammatory vs ischemic.
C diff negative x3.
Review of CT abd shows tapering of intra-abdominal vessels with atherosclerotic disease concerning for chronic ischemia, supported by guaiac + stool.
Lactate on admission was 5.7, which improved throughout ICU course.
Although pt had c. diff negative x3, c. diff PCR was sent given high suspicion.
No regional dysfunction to suggest recent ACS and negative cardiac enzymes.
Echo in [**5-27**] showed mild c.LVH with EF 55-60%, [**Doctor Last Name **] and mild RVE, mild-mod AS with peak/mean grad 24/13 and [**Location (un) 109**] 0.8 cm2, mod MR, mod-severe TR with stable pulm art HTN (PAp=46).
# Parainfluenza: Sputum cx positive for parainfluenza consistent with recent upper respiratory symptoms.
Following ECHO, ARF thought possibly [**12-20**] to poor forward flow - started diuresis with lasix IV boluses.
# Supratherapeutic INR: INR was supratherapeutic on admission which places patient at risk for bleeding.
Patient receive PO and IV vitamin K.  INR trended down to 2.6 and coumadin was restarted at low dose of 0.5 mg daily (given that patient is on amiodarone and antibiotics).
CT prelim with some fluid and compressed GB.
# Large B cell lymphoma: Dx [**2161**]: Rx local XRT; [**2-19**]: 2 x [**Hospital1 **], 4 x Rit/CHOP chemo.
PET+ for pulmonary nodules, stable on chest CT in [**2-23**].
Repeat chest/ab CT in [**6-25**] shows stable pulm nodules, stable L.adrenal adenoma, diverticulosis, and B.renal cysts.
However, CT R.LE shows ?increase in nodularity c/to CT [**11-25**].
Rpt CT chest/ abdomen in [**6-26**] stable.
# Chronic diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure: Echocardiogram showed depressed LVEF of 25% to 30%.
Viral hepatitis serologies was negative Hepatitis A (for IgM), B, and C serologies.
# Asymptomatic funguria: Patient had multiple negative urine culture and one culture positive for yeast.
We found that you had parainfluenza as well as inflammation of the colon (colitis) which was causing the diarrhea.
Your liver enzymes were rising but got better prior to discharge.
MEDICATIONS: ADDED: - Aspirin 325 mg by mouth daily - Furosemide 20 mg by mouth daily - Metoprolol succinate 75 mg by mouth daily CHANGED: - Warfarin 0.5 mg daily REMOVED: - Augmentin 875-125 mg - Atenolol 50 mg daily - Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg daily  Followup Instructions: Please have your Coumadin level checked and dose adjusted 1 day after discharge.
