CT PELVIS ORTHO W/O C  [**2195-2-10**] CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a complex fracture line extending through the intertrochanteric region of the right femur.
There is mild joint space narrowing in the right hip with osteophyte formation, much less than on the left.
Moderate, non-specific, arthropathy of the left hip.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a complex fracture line extending through the intertrochanteric region of the right femur.
There is mild joint space narrowing in the right hip with osteophyte formation, much less than on the left.
ECG [**2195-2-11**] Sinus rhythm.
CT pelvis/abdomen [**2-24**]: COMPARISONS: No prior CTs are available on PACs for comparison purposes.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are calcified pleural plaques at the lung bases consistent with prior asbestos exposure.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Normal-appearing contrast-filled appendix was visualized.
[**2-28**] CT abd/pelvis: TECHNIQUE: MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis without administration of IV contrast.
This study was compared with [**2195-2-24**] CT scan.
This study is limited by lack of IV contrast; hypodensities can be seen in the liver, which probably correspond to the innumerable low-density lesions seen on previous CT scan.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Sigmoid diverticula without diverticulitis.
Differential wall enhancement cannot be assessed on this non IV contrast study.

The patient encountered difficulty weaning, and a trach was discussed with his family/ HCP, would decided to pursue trach placement, which was done by thoracics on [**3-5**].
In addition, he was kept in negative fluid balance on a daily basis, as this seemed to improve his respiratory function although his CXR did not show overt CHF.
He was eventually weaned to a trach collar, which he tolerated well.
His suctioning frequency also decreased, and he was fitted for a valve by speech therapy, with intentions to undergo a swallow study.
# Anemia/Transient Melena: The patient was anemic, iron studies suggested anemia of chronic disease, possibly secondary to known malignancy.
His hematocrit was monitored on a daily basis, and he was transfused intermittently for HCT <21.
They recommended continuing on the PPI [**Hospital1 **], and monitoring his hct [**Hospital1 **]; with the thought that his melena was most likely secondary to blood loss from the PEG procedure.
The patient's hct continued to trend down, and he underwent an EGD and colonoscopy on [**3-11**] which showed an ulcerated, erythematous lesion in the proximal ascending colon.
This was thought to be the explanation for his melena, and a biopsy was taken, with a differential diagnosis including ischemic colitis vs. Crohn's disease vs. neoplasm.
The biopsy was still pending at the time of discharge.
It was thought that the patient's hematocrit should be monitored every 48 hours, or more frequently if melena develops.
He should continue on the PPI and follow-up with GI on an outpatient, elective basis for a repeat endoscopy/ EUS to evaluate the nodule seen in the stomach- as this may be possible GIST.
He underwent an abdominal CT to evaluate for any pathology, this revealed: 1.
The abdominal CT was repeated a few days later, and showed slight improvement of previous findings, and still no signs of obstruction.
Creatinine bumped up as high as >2.0.
With hydration, creatinine returned to baseline 0.9. .
Contact was maintained with his urologist, particularly after his abdominal CT showed liver metastasis.
A PSA, CEA, and AFP were sent, all of which returned normal.
