ECG ([**11-24**]): Sinus rhythm.
CXR ([**11-24**]): No acute intrathoracic process.
If metastatic disease is a concern, then a CT is recommended for further evaluation.
Left Breast Core Needle Biopsy Pathology ([**11-25**]): Invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3 with necrosis, measuring at least 1.1 cm in this limited sample.
MRI of C- and T-Spine ([**11-25**]): Bony metastasis in T4, T5 and T6 vertebral bodies as well as in T10 vertebra.
CT of Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis With and Without Contrast ([**11-26**]): 1.
ECG ([**11-27**]): Normal sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2100-11-24**] no diagnostic interval change.
CXR ([**11-27**]): Cardiac size is top normal.
The mediastinum is slightly widened due to lymphadenopathy, better seen in prior CT performed a day earlier.
CXR ([**11-29**]): Interval decrease in right-sided pulmonary edema with residual small right pleural effusion.
Tissue biopsy ([**12-2**]): From spinal stabilization procedure ( with orthopedic spine surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] ), tissue specimen sent from L4-L5 disc, L4-L5 disc, L2-L3 DISC, L3-4 disc .
Tissue biopsy ([**12-3**]): From spinal mass debulking procedure ( with orthopedic spine surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**].
CXR ([**12-3**]): Patient intubated, status post surgery.
CXR ([**12-4**]): Exam to evaluate ETT placement, interval change since admission.
The remainder of the examination is unchanged without an acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Urine culture ([**12-7**]): Repeat urine culture after 9 days on Ciprofloxacin for complicated UTI, culture shows no growth.

Patient's last mammogram was seven years ago with little contact with the medical community in the interim.
Examination revealed a large necrotic left breast mass with left axillary lymphadenopathy, a large midline lumbar mass and some proximal lower extremity weakness, left greater than right, but no other significant neurological deficits.
Spine MRI revealed bony metastasis in T4, T5 and T6 vertebral bodies as well as in T10 vertebra but no pathologic fracture, epidural mass or spinal cord compression.
CT torso revealed diffusely metastatic disease involving the liver and lungs, thoracic spine metastases as reported in the MRI findings, as well as multiple other osseous metastases including a large soft tissue mass involving the posterior elements of L2 to L5 and greater than 50% effacement of the spinal canal.
A left breast core needle biopsy revealed a grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma that was ER/PR +.
Blood cultures were taken and were negative.
Repeat UA and urine culture were negative.
A repeat urinalysis was performed and showed no evidence of active infection so no further antibiotics were given.
Normal saline was started at 250 cc/hr to maintain a urine output of 100-150 cc/hr.
Lasix were given when the patient subsequently developed hypoxia with CXR evidence of pulmonary edema.
Anemia: Hematocrit on admission was 35.9 with an unknown baseline.
Reticulocyte count 2.2 with reticulocyte index of 0.95, indicating an [**Last Name 88383**] problem consistent with her inflammatory state.
DIC labs indicated no DIC with a fibrinogen of 485 and FDP of 0-10.
Calculated TIBC was 229, ferritin was 879, and transferrin was 176, all consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
After hypercalcemia levels were corrected, patient was passing gas, but still not moving bowels.
CT scan of abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of compressive obstruction.
