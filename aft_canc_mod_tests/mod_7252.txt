She still had CP on arrival to ED and was taken to cath lab directly after head CT neg for bleed or mass effect with concern for mets.
Cath with normal coronaries except 40%ostial LCX, elevated right and left heart pressures and low cardiac output, thought to have pericarditis.
A head CT was neg for bleed or mass effect but with concern for metastatic disease.
She was taken to cath lab for concern about MI, had no flow limiting lesions (40%ostial LCX), evidence of left heart diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary HTN with increased right sided filling pressures.
Also had a TTE ([**2109-6-28**]) that showed normal regional left ventricular wall motion, hyperdynamic LV (EF>75%), and a small pericardial effusion that was stable on repeat TTE ([**2109-6-30**]).
Also of note, the patient developed cough productive of copious yellow sputum, and given her immunosuppression from chemotherapy as well as the CTA findings, was started on Ceftaz/Flagyl and diuresed with Lasix.

Pericardial fluid sent grew yeast.
Her blood was also positive enterococcus faecium and she was started on vancomycin.
CT chest showed loculated effusions that were not amenable for throacentesis.
The posivtive pressure helped to open collapsed L lung.
She had a bronchoscopy on [**7-9**], with no frank obstruction, extrinsic compression of L lower bronchus.
SHe was transfused for hematocrits less than 27.
Her HIT antibody was negative.
7) CV: Rhythm - She was in intermittent atrial flutter, initially treated with diltiazem but that was discontinued when she became septic.
8) Metabolic acidosis: Non anion gap, likely ARF from ATN and RTA given + urine anion gap.
