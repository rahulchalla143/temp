Limited evaluation of the known left lower lobe lung cancer with new nodules in the right upper and lower lobes that could represent metastatic disease versus infection.
CXR [**2167-2-8**] Left lower lobe consolidation is again noted slightly more prominent on todays study compared to [**2167-2-5**], but markedly improved since initial presentation on [**1-30**], [**2166**].

The patient was evaluated in the emergency room and blood, sputum, and urine cultures were sent.
Admission CXR revealed a LLL pneumonia that was treated as hospital acquired with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin; because she was admitted from a rehab facility.
Her antibiosis was narrowed to Vancomycin / Levofloxacin on [**2167-2-3**] based on her MRSA positive sputum culture from [**2167-1-30**].
#) MRSA Pneumonia and Sepsis: Admission CXR revealed a LLL pneumonia that was treated as hospital acquired with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin; because she was admitted from a rehab facility.
Antibiotics were narrowed to Vancomycin / Levofloxacin on [**2167-2-3**] based on sputum culture results that returned positive for MRSA obtained on admission [**2167-1-30**].
The patient's WBC count was 31.8 on admission [**2167-1-30**] and normalized gradually.
WBC count did start to trend up on [**2167-2-7**] and repeat fever work-up including f/u cxrs were done to evaluate for the development of an effusion or abscess and these were none revealing.Wbc trending down on discharge adn elevated wbc count likely due to prednisone.Pt completed a 10 day course of levofloxacin on [**2167-2-10**] and will complete a 14 day course of vancomycin on [**2167-2-13**].
A head CT without contrast was obtained for further work up and was negative on [**2167-1-30**].
On further review and scrutiny of past medical records, it was determined that the patient's facial palsey is long standing of years duration.
A chest CT was obtained and was negative for SVC syndrome.
Continued management per her outpatient physicians.Pt will need a f/u chest CT scan in [**2-25**] weeks to assure resolution of left lower infiltration.
