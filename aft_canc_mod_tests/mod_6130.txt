# Respiratory failure - Per the pulmonary team, the patient was intubated for airway protection in preparation for her bronchoscopy and stent removal, new stent could not be placed [**12-22**] anatomy.
Her oxygen saturations dropped precipitously and pt became bradycardic and then asystolic.
Pt was initially placed on zosyn, cipro, vancomycin and fluconazole and cultures sent from BAL and [**Date Range **].
Gram stain of BAL and also a sputum culture from 2 days later all showed GNRs and so vancomycin was discontinued and pt maintainted on zosyn, cipro, micafungin.
All cell counts were trended until she became CMO.
