At OSH ED, non-contrast head CT showed right frontal mass.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, vitals are 98.7 178/82 60 20 97% 2L NC.
Throughout exam he had several episodes of reaching out for objects with his right hand, then was unsure what he was reaching for.
For cancer screening history, he states his most recent colonoscopy was 2 years ago, and was normal.
Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: +past-pointing on finger nose finger bilaterally (L>R), +ataxia with rapid alternating movements and heel to shin bilaterally (L>R)  Gait not tested.
Pertinent Results: MRI Brain [**2155-9-6**]: FINDINGS:  There is a focal lesion with heterogeneous enhancement, solid enhancing and non-enhancing components, in the right frontal lobe superiorly (series 14, image 21), which may represent either a single lesion or two adjacent lesions with mild surrounding edema and FLAIR hyperintense signal.
Though there is some degree of slow diffusion within these lesions and cortical involvement, the enhancement pattern does not resemble the usual subacute infarcts.
[**2155-9-6**] CT Torso: 1.
If further investigation is desired, MRI without contrast or a CT with washout protocol may be obtained.
Brief Hospital Course: 77M who presented to the ER with new neurological findings, a head CT showed a right frontal brain mass.
On morning labs his uric acid was high at 8.5, a LDH was also sent as onc workup.
On [**9-6**], he underwent a MRI brain.
The MRI showed right frontal and temporal lesions that were concerning for metastatic lesions vs lymphoma.
A CT torso was also performed which showed a small lung and adrenal nodules.
A dilantin level was drawn and was 11.7, no load was given and plan to repeat the level in the AM.
On exam, it was noted there was some bruising and the patient c/o groin pain, a pelvic and femur xray were done and showed no significant abnormality.
Acetaminophen 325-650 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain 6.
?You will need an MRI of the brain with/without gadolinium contrast.
If you are required to have a MRI, you may also require a blood test to measure your BUN and Cr within 30 days of your MRI.
