At that time a 2.5 cm rt cervical lymph node was palpated and fiberoptic laryngoscopy showed a 1.5 cm rt base of tongue mass.
A CT and biopsy were recommended.
Eventually, in [**4-2**] he had the neck CT scan which showed a mass in teh rt oropharynx, rt cervical mass , bilateral LAD and compression of the rt internal jugular vein.Pt again did not show -up for f/u.
ENT evaluated the pt and performed a laryngoscopy and biopsy of mass.

Recent study reports: [**2166-8-10**]:portable CXR: bilateral atelectasis, no infiltrate.
[**2166-8-4**] CT chest [**Hospital1 2025**] : There is some patchy groundglass opacity in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.
Limited contrast-enhanced views of the upper abdomen show no abnormality within the visualized liver, spleen, pancreas, or kidneys.
[**2166-8-4**] CT NECK from [**Hospital1 2025**]: There is a large peripherally enhancing irregular right tongue base mass with internal air and low density material likely representing necrosis and secretions which extends across midline into the left tongue.
Path:[**2166-8-7**] SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: Right base of tongue biopsy, RIGHT Base of Tongue Biopsy #2.
Note: Immunohistochemical staining shows that the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin cocktail, CK5/6, p63, and p16, and are negative for chromogranin, synaptophysin, NSE, and LCA.
[**2166-8-10**] CT of neck :1.
[**2166-8-10**] CT chest:1.
Known cervical lymphadenopathy is better assessed on accompanying CT of the neck.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-6-6**], regional wall motion abnormalities are no longer appreciated.
Alt 24 Ast 21 AP  43 TB  0.2   Brief Hospital Course: 62 yo man with new diagnosis of SCC of the oropharynx Stage IVB s/p tracheotomy transferred from [**Hospital1 2025**] for further management.
Admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for initial management and subsequently transferred to the floor to start his chemotherapy with TPF which he tolerated well [docetaxel 75 mg/m2 day1 , cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day1, and continuous infusion 5FU 1000mg/m2 per day days [**11-26**]].
SCC (HPV study pending).
Protocol reviewed with pt, chemothrapy to include docetaxel day1 , cisplatin day1 and continuous 5fu infusion days [**11-26**].
-Will need dental eval in preparation for xrt in the future-after completion of induction chemo.
Cardiac echo with Nl LVEF and improvement in wall motion abnormalities seen after MI.
Sputum cx, urine cx and blood cxs all negative.
You tolerated your chemotherapy well and will need a neulasta shot when you get to [**Hospital6 **].
