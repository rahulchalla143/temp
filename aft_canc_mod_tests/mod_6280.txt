IMAGING STUDIES: [**2158-1-21**] 2D-ECHO - The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The echo findings are suggestive but not diagnostic of pericardial constriction.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-12-22**], the patient is now in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
[**2158-1-21**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Decreased left lower lobe opacity is consistent with decreased atelectasis and pleural effusion.
[**2158-1-22**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST - Stable bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions with significantly increased left lobar collapse and increased surrounding ground-glass opacities representing microatelectasis versus superimposed infectious process.
However CT Chest revealed more chronic inflammatory changes as opposed to active infectious changes.
ECHO did not show any concern structural abn, very small stable pericadial effusion.
Will need serial thoracentesis for comfort prn SOB.
# ANEMIA, DECREASED HEMATOCRIT - His cell counts have been decreased in the setting of his underlying malignancy, but following his thoracentesis there was a 6 point drop in his hematocrit without CT chest evidence of hemothorax.
His hemolysis labs were reassuring.
Patient did not have any BM to guaiac and rectal exam was not done given his neutropenia.
His post-transfusion hematocrit was stable.
Digoxin level was within normal limites this admission and we continued this medication.
# HISTORY OF NEUTROPENIC FEVER - Patient presented with a temperature of 102.0 at home for which he took Tylenol.
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], urine and sputum cultures were unrevealing.
He receives packed red [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] cells and platelet transfusions as an outpatient, his last being on [**2158-1-19**].
# Hyponatremia - Patient developed hyponatremia to 128, urine lytes obtained and more consistent with hypovolemia with Na <10.
TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: 1. f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on Sunday, [**1-29**] - will monitor counts and transfuse as needed.
Home O2 Home Oxygen 2L via nasal cannula, with ambulation only, pulse dose for portability (for ambulatory sats 86% on RA, 95% on 2L) RA sat at rest 92% dx: cardiomyopathy with pleural effusions  15.
