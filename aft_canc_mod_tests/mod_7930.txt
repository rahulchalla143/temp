Brief Hospital Course: 55 yo F with no significant past medical history who presents from OSH for further evaluation with elevated LFTs and concern for acute hepatitis.
Hepatitis: Patient initially presented from OSH for further evaluation and treatment after found to have elevated AST and ALT into the 1000.
She had an extensive workup to evaluate the cause of the acute process however most tests were negative (please review results section).
However, patient was found to have hepatitis surface Ag positive and core IgG positive with negative viral load for hepatitis B making her a chronic carrier.
She had a liver biopsy showing massive necrosis.
She underwent evaluation for liver transplantation and was successfully listed.
During her hospital course her tbili, INR continued to trend up.
Blood cultures remained negative since [**8-17**].
Patient was periodically transfused to maintain HCT > 25. .
Active urine sediment with WBC casts c/w AIN.
Urine lytes c/w prerenal etiology (given lack of po intake) vs hepatorenal.
The following summarizes the remainder of her hospital course:  CT head on [**2128-8-30**] showed no intracranial abnormality.
She underwent infectious work-up and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically.
While the bolt was in place, her coagulopathy was corrected with transfusions of FFP, platelets, and cryoglobulin as needed to maintain an INR <2.0, Plts >75, Hct >25 and Fibrinogen >100.
ICP was maintained below 20 with sedation, hypertonic saline, mannitol, hyperventilation, paralysis, and hypothermia, though she had intermittent increases of ICPs to >25.
At this time, neurological exam remained poor, as at the most she grimaced to painful stimuli.
CT head, MR head, and EEG showed no acute intracranial abnormality, aside from hepatic encephalopathy, to explain her poor mentation.
On [**2128-9-16**], she became febrile, and her WBC count increased abruptly, raising concern of infection.
Suspicion for infection was high, although surveillance cultures up to this time had shown no significant evidence of infection.
At approximately 12:30 AM, [**9-18**], her oxygen saturation gradually declined.
