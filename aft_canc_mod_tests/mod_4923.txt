Initial labs confirmed likelihood of DIC, probably [**12-27**] sepsis.
She was started on empiric vancomycin and meropenem for PNA coverage, with the intention of d/c'ing vanc if no GPC on blood or sputum cultures in 48h.
She was kept on respiratory precautions due to h/o TB exposure, and sputum cultures were ordered to r/o active pulmonary TB, given history.
In the context of recent stroke, it was decided to avoid heparin until imaging of the brain could be done, and the neurology service consulted.
In the morning, a repeat head CT was done, which revealed several large areas of hypoattenuation consistent with subacute stroke.
From the OSH head CT reports, which described small areas of old CVAs, this was thought to possible represent a progression with possible new or evolving infarcts.
An echocardiogram and carotid ultrasounds were also ordered, given thromboembolic possibilities, and she was kept on ASA 325mg qD.
Her other medications were d/c'ed, blood draws and radiology tests were d/c'ed, and Ms. [**Known lastname 65506**] was placed on a morphine drip.
