He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**] on [**1-16**], where he was also noted to have some L sided weakness, and was sent for an MRI to evaluate for metastatic disease, which as noted below showed no new changes.

CXR [**1-22**]: Patchy opacities most prominent in the right lower lobe, worrisome for pneumonia.
CT spine [**1-23**]: Progression of the lytic osseous and epidural metastases, with progressed malalignment.
CTA [**1-23**]: 1) Right lower and right middle lobe air space consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
Bone scan [**1-23**]:  1) No abnormal uptake in the left upper extremity.
# pneumonia: Patient had altered MS and low grade fevers [**1-22**] and CXR performed which suggested pna.
CTA negative for PE but did confirm significant pneumonia.
His pain was initially difficult to control, but was ultimately dramatically improved when he was changed to a dilaudid PCA--he did not have relief from fentanyl patch, likely b/c of soft tissue wasting and future efforts at long acting medications should be PO.
Neurosurgery team asked to eval this pt on [**2153-1-23**]  and was transferred to our service for spinal deformity which was noted on upper level of images (CT chest) to r/o PE.
CT of cervical thoracic spine was obtained and results of T1 collapse noted.
A CT scan of the spine was obtained in traction and good reduction of the deformity was noted.
The total EBL was 7.5 liters with the pt being given 22 units of PRBC's.
His postoperative  head CT and spine CT's were stable.
