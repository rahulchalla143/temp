The suspicion is for bone marrow involvement of his T cell lymphoma, but this has not been [**Location (un) **] out on bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry.
He presented to clinic today for platelet infusion, and his vitals were the following: T101.3 BP 92/62 Pulse 120/min.
He was given Tylenol, 1L of NS over 2 hours, and blood cultures were obtained from peripheral site and PICC line.
Also sent UA, urine cultures, and will have chest xray.
Further investigation led to biopsy of small bowel and the diagnosis of T cell lymphoma was made.
Transaminitis:  From [**Date range (1) 45746**] (peak AST 198, ALT 247, alk phos 1062, negative HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV, CMV, toxo, VZV, HSV1, HSV2).
Liver bx revealed non-specific inflammation consistent with acute hepatitis.

In retrospect,this right adrenal lesion was seen on the prior CT scans dating back to [**2118-12-12**].
Additionally, there has been interval development of new foci of abnormally increased FDG activity within the osseous structures including the right 1st rib, anterolateral portion of the right 2nd rib, posterior right 8th rib, posterior aspect of the right 10th rib, the left scapula, medial aspect of the left clavicle, and the T7 and L4 vertebral bodies.
PET scans showed activity in multiple sites including the axial skeleton, lungs, and bilateral adrenal glands.
He continued to spike high fevers and had several episodes of hypotension, confusion, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia which were felt to be related to adrenal insufficiency from either lymphomatous infiltration of his adrenals of CMV adrenalitis.
His cultures were persitently negative with the exception of a single bottle positive for coag negative staph felt to be a contaminant.
CMV viral titiers also remained negative on at least 3 occasions and were checked weekly.
Biopsy of a right chest lesion demonstrated anaplastic transformation of his T cell lymphoma with markers similar to those in his prior bone marrows.
CT abdomen demonstrated free air in the peritoneum and focal thickenings in several areas of his small bowel.
In consultation with surgery, it was felt that exploratory laparotomy would have a near fatal outcome.
