Pulmonary prospective:   On [**10-5**], the patient went for a suction thrombectomy by Interventional Radiology.
An IVC filter was placed at that time as well and a left pulmonary artery stent was also placed.
A CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis subsequently showed that there was no tumor, but did show multiple PE's, right greater than left, acute on subacute pulmonary emboli.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy which was unrevealing.
BAL cultures subsequently did not grow out anything.
Also, on the 12th, a chest x-ray revealed a left lower lobe infiltrate.
On [**10-16**], the patient underwent a trial of nitric oxide without any change in her cardiac output or urine output or her pulmonary vascular resistance.
All showed approximately the same thing, an ejection fraction of greater than 60% with a hyperdynamic LV and RV that showed abnormal septal motion consistent with volume or pressure overload and [**Last Name (un) **] sign on admission, all pointing to an acute pulmonary process.
On [**10-9**], when the patient was intubated, the patient became hypotensive and required Levophed at low doses to maintain her blood pressure.
The patient was maxed out on all three pressors on those and fluids, so blood pressure rose to approximately 90/40.
The objective was to maximize cardiac output and urine output.
The Swan numbers were consistent with right heart failure with ventricular interdependence.
Urine output also rose in this time.
On [**10-24**], the patient had a drop in her blood pressure and had crackles on pulmonary exam.
On the 28th, the Swan was discontinued as the pressors were discontinued and cardiac output continued to rise.
On admission, the patient was transfused units to keep her hematocrit greater than 27.
Of note, the hematologic work-up for hypercoagulability was limited because the patient was on heparin and antithrombin therapy for most of her stay up to this point.
From an Infectious Disease point of view, on [**10-9**], the chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe infiltrate.
At that time, ceftriaxone and Zithromax were started and cultures were sent.
On [**10-11**], the patient had a positive urine culture for Citrobacter pansensitive and therapy was not adjusted.
The cultures revealed yeast in the sputum and urine.
Blood cultures throughout this time were negative.
Of note, throughout this time, numerous line changes were made with the TIPS sent for culture and nothing every grew out on them.
Also of note, upwards of 12 blood cultures including isolator bottles were sent and no cultures were ever positive.
Renal:  The patient had decreased urine output starting on [**10-11**], the day she became hypotensive and required three pressors to maintain her blood pressure.
On [**10-15**], urine electrolytes were consistent with prerenal and examining the urine revealed no casts.
Thus, the belief of the team was that her low urine output was prerenal.
On [**10-17**], after being weaned off the pressors and maintaining a stable blood pressure on her own, her urine output increased and was quite good over subsequent days.
Endocrine:  On [**10-12**], a random cortisol level was 29, an appropriate response to the current IC stress.
