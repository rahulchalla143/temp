The patient was found to have a hematocrit of 7.9.
The patient was transfused 4 units of blood as her hematocrit rose to 21.8.
She was found to have normal INR and no evidence of coagulopathy.
Heart rate 82, blood pressure 161/79, respiratory rate 27, 97 percent on 30 percent face mask.
RESPIRATORY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory tests on admission showed white blood cell count 11.4, hematocrit 21.8, platelet count 259, sodium 141, potassium 3.5, chloride 104, CO2 22.
BUN 88, creatinine 7.3, glucose 152.
AST 15, ALT 4, alkaline phosphatase 49, total bilirubin 0.7.
PT 13.7, PTT 29.5, INR 1.2.
Chest x-ray was within normal limits.
CT of the chest on admission showed enlarged heart.
The patient received 4 units of blood on admission with appropriate rise in hematocrit to 35.6.
The patient made by end of hospital day 2, 1.7 liters of urine, however her creatinine did not significantly improve.
The patient had vaginal ultrasound  which showed calcified fibroid, thickened endometrium and small blood in the pelvis.
CT of the abdomen showed small focus of fluid and no obvious mass and questionable fibroid in the uterus.
Vaginal examination showed no evidence of acute bleeders.
Throughout the hospital course the patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells on the first day of admission, otherwise her hematocrit was relatively well during her length of stay.
As her volume status increased her hematocrit shifted down, and at discharge home, her hematocrit was 31.4.
RENAL FAILURE - The patient's creatinine was significantly higher than her last recorded creatinine on follow up over a year ago.
The patient was restarted on her home dose cyclosporin on hospital day 5 and her C2 levels were monitored.
She underwent ultrasound of the transplanted kidney which showed no evidence of hydro and relatively good flow to the transplanted kidney.
The patient eventually underwent biopsy of her transplanted kidney because of lack of improvement in her serum creatinine.
Biopsy showed evidence of chronic rejection of kidney.
She was discharged with creatinine of 5.2.
