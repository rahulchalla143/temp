At [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital the patient had a CBC, which showed pancytopenia.
Further workup included a bone marrow biopsy, which showed large numbers of blasts cells.
Chest x-ray at the outside hospital showed possibility of infiltrates so the patient was started on Rocephin.
CBC on admission at the outside hospital showed a white blood cell count of 700 and a hematocrit of 24.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs temperature 102.1.
Pulse 112.
Respiratory rate 16.
Blood pressure 112/60.
Head examination normocephalic, atraumatic.
Abdominal examination soft, nontender, nondistended.
Distal pulses 1+ bilaterally.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  CBC shows a white blood cell count of 1.3, hematocrit 34.8, platelets 39.
Differential on the white count 31% neutrophils, 2% bands, 47% lymphocytes, 2% atypical cells.
INR was 1.3.
Liver function tests were within normal limits.
Her hematocrit was fairly stable and though her platelets were low she did not require any platelet transfusions.
Infectious disease:  The patient was febrile on admission as well as neutropenic, therefore she was started on Cefepime 2 grams q 8 for gram negative bacteria coverage.
The patient also had a chest CT done to evaluate for infectious etiology.
The CT showed patchy infiltrates suggestive of the possibility of pneumonia as well as some emphysematous changes.
The patient had blood cultures and urine cultures taken during the admission, which were negative.
An electrocardiogram was done, which showed atrial fibrillation.
Vital signs showed hypotension.
She was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Her vital signs stabilized and the following day she was electrically cardioverted from atrial fibrillation into a normal sinus rhythm.
At this time she was asymptomatic and her blood pressure and other vital signs were stable.
Her heart rate ranged from 100 to 130.
On this her electrocardiograms showed a QTC interval within normal limits and she was maintained on this dose.
In addition, while in the Intensive Care Unit the patient had an echocardiogram, which showed a moderate pericardial effusion.
A repeat echocardiogram was done two days after the initial one, which showed that the pericardial effusion had been reduced in size and was now small.
