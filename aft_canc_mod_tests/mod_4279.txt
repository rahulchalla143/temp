His wife called the clinic for concern that the patient has had shortness of breath, new oxygen requirement, fatigue and weakness, and with temperature of 101.6 3 days PTA.
In clinic, he was noted for a decreased oxygen saturation to 88-90% on room air which improved to 95% on oxygen at 2-3 liters via NP.
Followup PET scan for his R-CHOP showed no evidence for lymphoma.
He subsequently was admitted in [**1-/2168**] for workup of his right lower extremity weakness as the concern was for CNS involvement or a cord compression.
He was evaluated by additional MRIs and lumbar puncture, which did not show any evidence for malignancy, although noted the same question atypical hemangioma in the lumbar spine area.
On [**2168-2-17**], his CSF cytology did show evidence for malignant cells.
MRI also demonstrated increased uptake in the sacral plexus with evidence of possible right lumbosacral plexopathy.
At the end of [**8-/2168**], it was felt that Mr. [**Known lastname **] had shown some progression of his systemic disease as his last CT had shown some evidence of bony erosion and he was having some increasing lower extremity weakness.
Unfortunately, in [**10/2168**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted due to blurry vision that had progressed over the past month.
He noted a decreased visual acuity and unfortunately a head MRI showed a new 1.5 cm suprasellar mass likely representing progression of his CNS disease.

beta-glucan 139, galactomannan negative .
pheripheral blood smear with blast forms (flow cytometry pending) .
Chest CT In the four days since the previous CT chest, there has been collapse/consolidation of the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe.
CT OF ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There has been interval placement of an IVC filter.
Brief Hospital Course: A 69-year-old gentleman with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with CNS involvement undergoing XRT, PCP ([**2168-7-28**]), DVT s/p IVC filter placement, was admitted for hypoxia, shortness of breath, fever, fatigue found to have pneumonia, leukemic transformation of his lymphoma, and septic shock.
All cultures were negative so ID and Pulmonary were consulted.
A broncho-alveolar lavage was performed and was negative for PCP by DFA and grew only OP flora.
He was transferred to the medical ICU where he was emergently intubated when he began to desaturate on 100% oxygen and went into an SVT with HR 180.
