Follow up tibial MRI showed increased enhancement while PET scan  was stable in that area.
Outpatient head MRI on [**2164-10-18**] showed a large right frontal heterogeneously enhancing mass suggestive of a metastasis.
on [**2164-10-18**], and the pathology was metastatic melanoma.
She later had  more Cyberknife radiosurgery procedure to a left parietal brain metastasis on [**2165-9-27**] to 2,000 cGy at 78% isodose line.
- One month F/U brain MRI was stable.
PET scan on [**2166-5-19**] revealed increased FDG avidity in the right tibia and in the posterior stomach felt c/w recurrent disease.
- status post EGD with biopsy on [**2167-7-16**] showing melanoma, and - received PD-1 antibody treatment from [**2168-1-27**] to [**2168-4-20**].

Left sided exam likely secondary to neglect as patient verbalizes knowledge she is moving right when asked to move left.
Pertinent Results: MRI Brain [**6-22**] 1.
MRI Brain [**2168-7-7**] No significant changes are identified since the most recent examination, unchanged left frontal heterogeneous enhancing lesion, similar pattern of enhancement surrounding the right frontal surgical cavity with ex vacuo dilatation of the ventricular frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].

Expected postoperative findings of pneumocephalus, a small amount of blood products, and cytotoxic edema is present.
On [**7-9**], the patient was started on iron for a hematocrit of 24.
**) The following day, her hematocrit decreased to 23 and she was transfused 2 units of pRBCs.
He post transfusion hematocrit was 31%.
