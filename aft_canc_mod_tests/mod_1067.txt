Incision Clean, Dry, and Intact   Pertinent Results: CT Abdomen with contrast [**2180-4-5**]: 1.
Age-indeterminate L3 and L4 compression fractures.
Follow-up and further evaluation for cause of lymaphdenopathy should be obtained if endoscopy is negative and no other source identified.
Recommend dedicated chest CT for further evaluation.
Six-month followup CT should also be performed to assess stability, given patient's smoking history.
Recommend ultrasound or MRI for further characterization.
MRI Brain [**2180-4-6**]: Numerous enhancing masses throughout the supra- and infratentorial compartments, without subependymal or leptomeningeal enhancement.
The findings most likely represent multiple metastatic lesions, likely mucinous adenocarcinoma from a gastrointestinal primary site, given the MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 34702**], as well as the findings on the body CT scan.
CT Chest with contrast [**2180-4-6**]: 1.
As recommended in prior CT abdomen, MR could be performed.
This can be evaluated either with physical exam or endoscopy.
Regional gastrohepatic lymphadenopathy associated with esophageal wall thickening as mentioned in prior CT should be evaluated.
Ultrasound of the liver [**2180-4-6**]: 1.
No liver lesion to correlate with hypodensity seen on CT scan identified.
Multiple subacute compression fractures throughout the visualized thoracolumbar spine, corresponding to the findings on the prompting CT scan.
MRI Brain [**4-14**]: 1.
There has been interval evolution of the lesions, with increased necrosis and more conspicuous rim enhancement on the present study compared to the prior study of [**4-6**], several new lesions compared to the prior study of [**2180-4-6**].
Complete sMR tudy is recommended to assess betetr the interval change/progression.

Additional work up from the OSH included a CT of the chest/abdomen that revealed a hypodensity in the liver and a chronic L2 compression fractures.
He was hyponatremic upon admission and was admitted to the ICU for Q1 hour neuro checks and q4 hr sodium checks.
His neurologic examination was notable only for mild dysmetria on his right upper extremity.
The patient was placed on hypertonic saline for the first night and was switched to salt tablets on [**4-6**] when his Na was 130.
A brain MRI was required for the work up but the patient could not tolerate the study due to severe claustrophobia.
The MRI revealed multiple brain lesions.
MRI of the lumbar spine was negative for any metastasis.
Additionally, he had a liver ultrasound to further evaluate a hypodensity seen on CT scan.
The ultrasound was negative for any concerning lesions.
Medications on Admission: ASA 325mg, Diova 160mg QD, Lopressor 50mg [**Hospital1 **], Vitoran 1080 QD   Discharge Medications: 1.
Be sure you notify your Primary care Doctor regarding the pulmonary nodule that was found on your Chest CT.  You should have a repeat CT of your lungs in 3 months.
Also, you should have a repeat check of your sodium level next week with your PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] should stay on a strict 1.2L fluid restriction until you see him/her.
