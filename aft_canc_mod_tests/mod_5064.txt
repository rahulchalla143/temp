His SOB continued to worsen so he presented to clinic on [**3-29**].
His sx were so severe that even mild activity, such as changing clothes, was exhausting.
In clinic, vitals were notable for an oxygen saturation 97%-100%, HR 109, T 99 and he appeared distressed.
A TTE was obtained which showed cardiac tamponade so he was taken for drainage.
Opening pressure was 10, after drainage was negative.
post-drain echo did not show fluid but showed hyperdynamic septum.
Pt was transferred to the CCU for monitoring s/p drainage and felt well.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Cardiac Cath ([**2117-3-29**]): COMMENTS: 1.
Pericardial location confirmed using by echo using agitated saline.
Initial pericardial pressure of 8 mmHg.
Post pericardial pressure of 0 mmHg.
ECHO ([**2117-3-29**]): Pre-tap: Pericardicentesis catheter was confirmed to be in the pericardial space with injection of agitated saline (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]).
CXR ([**2117-3-29**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infiltrates on single portable chest view.
Recommend completion to PA and lateral chest view whenever situation permits.
ECHO ([**2117-3-30**]): The left ventricular cavity is small.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-3-29**], the patient is more tachycardic, with smaller ventricular cavity.
CXR ([**2117-3-30**]): IMPRESSION: Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette possibly related to pericardial effusion in the absence of significant pulmonary congestion.
Confirmation echocardiogram is recommended.
Compared to tracing #2 T wave changes are slightly more marked, suggest clinical correlation.
CT Chest [**2117-4-2**] 1.
ECHO [**2117-4-2**] Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
RENAL US [**2117-4-1**] 1.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this peripheral blood/bone marrow express immature antigens CD34, HLA-DR, CD117, myeloid associated antigens CD33, CD13, CD15, CD11C (dim), CD71.
[**2117-4-8**] Chest CT without contrast: 1.
[**2117-4-9**] TTE The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-4-1**] and [**2117-4-2**], the effusion appears echodense and decreased in size.
PAS, tissue gram, and AFB stains are negative for microorganisms.
CXR [**2117-4-16**] There is again seen consolidation in the right upper lobe consistent with pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course: 74M with MDS transformed to AML, complicated clinical course including multifocal pneumonia in the setting of neutropenia.
A discussion with the family regarding the very limited expected benefit and likely harm of ongoing chemotherapy resulted in the decision to transfer to a more comfort-based approach, in which no more chemotherapy, the patient was made DNR/DNI but antibiotics were continued.
# Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia seen on CT chest and subsequent CXRs are consistent with progression of disease.
He was evaluated for TB with induced sputums, which were negative.
A TTE was obtained which showed cardiac tamponade so he was taken for drainage.
Opening pressure was 10, after drainage was negative.
post-drain echo did not show fluid but showed hyperdynamic septum.
Interval (post-drain) echocardiograms showed no reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space.
On HD5, his pericardial fluid culture was positive for p.acnes.
Allergy recommended a desensititization protocol, which was not used.
