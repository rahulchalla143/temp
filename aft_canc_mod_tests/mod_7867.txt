Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**2102**] TAH/BSO showed stage IIB ovarian Ca adjuvant treatment with six cycles of carboplatin and Taxol - [**2113-12-7**] had mammogram that showed a poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma, 8 mm in largest diameter, without LVI.
Imaging showed right axillary, subpectoral, and deep cervical lymph node involvement.
Pathology from the right breast demonstrated LCIS, chemotherapy changes, and no evidence of residual IDC.
- genetic testing negative for BRCA-1 and 2 mutations.
Blood work at the hospital demonstrated a CBC that was notable for white blood cell count of 19, hematocrit 23, and a platelet count of 12.
White blood cell count differential was notable for 11% blasts.
She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where she  underwent bone marrow biopsy on [**2115-6-7**], with findings consistent with AML with monocytic differentiation.
Bone marrow biopsy performed on day +14 and day +24 showed residual blasts in the marrow, and she was treated with one cycle of HiDAC.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2115-7-16**], showed no evidence of blasts.
An L-spine MRI on [**2116-7-31**], demonstrated a new enhancing L2  spinous process mass with associated soft tissue component and no spinal canal involvement.
On [**2116-8-17**], she underwent bone marrow biopsy, which demonstrated a mildly hypocellular marrow with no evidence of AML.
On [**2116-8-25**], she underwent an FNA of this newly identified left spinous process mass.
-Bone marrow biopsy last week ([**9-/2116**]) was positive for AML.

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-8-29**], a pericardial effusion is no longer seen.
Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.
Right apical opacity is unchanged since the prior examination dating back to [**2116-7-3**] and reflects a focal area of consolidation seen back on [**2115-10-20**] radiograph and most likely represents a residua of the cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
[**2116-10-24**] CT abdomen/pelvis: 1.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-10-2**], the severity of mitral regurgitation and estimated PA systolic pressure are increased.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo F with h/o breast CA and subsequent development of AML s/p allo HSCT (on [**2115-10-4**]) found to have a relapse of her AML with positive BM biopsy and chloroma of the L2 spine, admitted for C1 of MEC (started [**2116-10-3**]).
# Relapsed AML: [**2116-9-29**] BM biopsy showed HYPERCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE NECROSIS AND EVIDENCE OF RELAPSED ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA.
Baseline Echo on admission WNL, with EF>70%.
Patient required several transfusions of PRBCs and platelets during admission.
She had a repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**2116-11-11**] (day 40) which showed no evidence of her leukemia (3% blasts).
Her counts continued to trend up, and ANC was 650 on the day of discharge (day 44 after MEC).
CXR on [**10-3**] clear except for focal area of consolidation in right apice, thought to be residua of cryptogenic PNA from previous admission.
Urine culture negative.
Blood cultures negative from [**10-3**], [**10-5**].
[**10-15**] and [**10-16**] blood clutures negative.
Patient again began having fevers on [**10-17**] without localizing symptoms, with 1 out of 2 blood cultures growing enterococcus galinerum, sensitive to daptomycin.
Daily blood cultures were negative.
Patient developed fever to 103.5F, [**10-22**] Blood culture grew E Coli while on atreonam and ciproflozacin.
The E coli in her blood cultures was found to be sensitive only to gentamicin and zosyn, so she was started on these two antibiotics.
Multiple surveillance cultures were drawn and had no growth.
Etiology thought to be due to E coli found on blood cx on [**10-22**] and [**10-23**], likely from gut translocation.
CDiff antigen was negative and no blood cx returned positive since [**10-23**].
RUQ US showed a "coarse liver", non-specific but could signify liver disease/inflammation.
4. white petrolatum-mineral oil 56.8-42.5 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.
Your white blood cell counts increased slowly but surely, and a repeat bone marrow biopsy showed no leukemia cells.
