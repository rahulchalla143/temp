Aerobic and anaerobic BCx from [**6-22**] grew out [**3-18**] GNR enterobacter cloacae(pan sensitive) and UCx w/ GNR and enterobacter.
Admitted to ICU after repeat episode of AF RVR (130-150) w/ BP 90's, 90% 2L, placed on 100% NRB w/ spo2 hi 90's; following 1L bolus--> SBP 100's.
Hct 20.8 (from 25 in AM) w/ new HA--> NCHCT w/o evidence of ICH.
CVL placed, then removed ~2wks later secondary to persistant fevers and a concern for it as a source of infection Abx start dates:  1.
ID:  Febrile neutropenia     A.Urosepsis with +[**Last Name (un) **] and +Blood cultures for enterobacter now negative x many days.
Labs showed elevated d-dimer at 2257, but also elevated haptoglobin at 396, fibrinonogen 430, suggesting generalized inflammation without DIC.
Sputum and repeat chest CT's did not offer putative etiology.
Required non-rebreather for a number of days in ICU, but eventually weaned to 8 L nasal canulae and over the course of 2 weeks, to room air; his oxygen saturation at discharge was 95% on RA.
A TTE on [**7-3**] showed no valvular lesions.
An abdominal CT to assess for hepatic infection was normal.
Repeat chest CTs have shown no change in the pulmonary nodules, but resolving effusion and resolving lymphadenopathy.
Induced sputum with gram stain showed heavy growth of oropharyngeal flora, (-)prelim nocardia cx, (-)PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], (-)prelim fungal cx, (-)fungal KOH prep.
C.Folliculitis: Derm biopsy of follicular plaque on back.
An ultrasound exam was negative, and the regional infection was considered by the medical and infectious disease teams to be well sequested.
Heme-Onc:  MDS w/ pancytopenia (hct 26-28 baseline) increased blasts on BMbx [**12-17**] (none in periphery) On danazol, aransep, desyrel (ferritin >[**2176**]); receiving prbc qowk, plt transfusions intermittently in last several months.
Received transfusions to keep HCT >25 and plts >10 (>50 if bleeding).
RUQ U/S and Abdominal CT without liver lesions/obstruction.
Now on caspofungin with liver enzymes trending down towards normal.
A fib with RVR: likely [**1-15**] bactermia (ruled out for MI, nl TSH), resolved after dilt 20 IV x 2, then dilt po 30 qid.
Dilt d/c on [**6-27**] and on low dose metoprolol.
