[**2177-9-5**] Exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, hand-sewn 2 layer side to side ileotranverse colostomy.
[**2177-9-19**] Exploratory laparotomy, LOA, drainage and washout of abdomen, diverting loop ileostomy 3.
She was started on a beta blocker and her heart rate improved.
Due to her persistent tachycardia a CTA of her chest was obtained, which revealed no pulmonary embolus.
This decline along with a substantial leukocytosis prompted a CT scan on [**9-15**] which revealed a large abdominal fluid collection surrounding the anastomotic site.
CT guided drainage of this collection was performed.
A repeat CT scan was obtained on [**9-16**] and showed two smaller intra-abdominal fluid collections that were percutaneously drained.
A repeat CT scan on [**9-18**] showed a new LLQ fluid collection which was percutaneously drained with a pigtail catheter and the current RUQ drain was exchanged.
Her clinical condition failed to improve so on [**9-19**] she returned to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy, diverting ileostomy and penrose placement around the anastamotic site.
A CT scan showed a large hematoma compressing both ureters and causing hydronephrosis.
Genitourinary: On [**9-18**] her serum creatinine rose to 1.5 and she was bolused with IVF for low urine output.
A repeat CT scan showed a large pelvic hematoma which was compressing the ureters and causing hydronephrosis.
Her initial leukocytosis was attributed to sepsis, which resolved with antibiotics and drainage of abscess collections.
Vancomycin was added on [**9-15**] when a peri-anastomotic collection was found.
With her impressive leukocytosis, multiple stool samples were sent for C.diff, which all were negative.
A 10 day course of Vancomycin was complete for coag negative staph isolated from a blood culture.
-Try to maintain ostomy output between 500mL to 1500mL per day.
-If Ostomy output >1 liter, take 4mg of Imodium, repeat 2mg with each episode of loose stool.
