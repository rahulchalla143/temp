[**2200-12-31**] CT head non-contrast: IMPRESSION: Small 5-mm focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia.
[**2200-12-31**] EKG (my read): NSR, LAD, 1st degree AV block, incompletely widened QRS comlex, ST elevation in V3; ST segment w/ abnl morphology in V2 and V3 w/o elevation.
Overall this EKG shows interval reducation of the ST elevations of the V2-V4 leads.
Renal/Abdominal Ultrasound: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2200-6-19**], there has been no significant change.
CXR [**1-6**]:COMPARISON: Chest radiograph dated [**2201-1-4**].
The bibasilar opacities are slightly decreased compared to the chest x-ray dated [**2201-1-4**].
Upon Discharge/Interval Data: WBC 6.9 Hb 11.6 Hct 31.6 Plts  92 Ca: 7.9 Mg: 1.7 P: 3.0   Brief Hospital Course: Dr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 yo gentleman with critical aortic stenosis, chronic renal failure admitted with mental status changes in the setting of uremia and hypertensive emergency.
ED course: Patient received Lopressor IV 5mg x 4 and Hydralazine 10mg IV x 1 to control BP down to 130-150.
CT head showed a bleed in the basal ganglia.
A renal consult was obtained for creatinine of 9, increased from 4.
The patient was admitted to the ICU for close BP monitoring and electrolyte monitoring in the setting of uremic metabolic acidosis and intracranial hemorrhage.
In the MICU: Patient was admitted to MICU with neurology consult recommendations to keep MAPS <130 with SBP <140, goal achieved with IV hydralazine which was then changed to Metoprolol IV.
Repeat echo showed no significant change from prior.
Nutrition eval recommended Dobhoff tube feedings.
Repeat CXR on [**2201-1-6**] showed partial resolution of PNA and therefore the patient was continued on Levofloxacin to complete a 10 days course.
In terms of other work up for the patient's altered mental status, B12 and TSH were measured which showed elevated B12 and TSH/T4 wnl.
Patient then had a Hct drop from 32->27 and required 2 units pRBC with improvement to 34.
His Hct is currently stable at 31.6 and there is minimal oozing from line sites.
Of not a DIC workup was negative and there was no evidence of hemolysis.
Blood pressure came under good control with HD and all antihypertensive medications where discontinued.
Blood pressure should be managed with dialysis alone.
Patient with worsening renal failure over several months, now presenting with uremic symptoms, started on hemodialysis during this admission with improvement in blood pressure and Bun/Cr.
His blood pressures have been controlled with HD since patient has tight aortic stenosis (as above).
Found on CT head upon admission when patient presented with elevated blood pressure.
CT showed a 5mm area w/ surrounding edema w/o shift or hydrocephalus.
Repeat CT was consistent with evolution without any further extension of bleeding.
Neurosurgical evaluation did not feel that the patient required any operative intervention.
Blood pressure was managed with HD as mentioned above.
Anion gap closed with hemodialysis and ultrafiltration x 2. .
Hct 22 on presentation requiring one unit of pRBCs initially.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease with normal Iron level.
Last EGD was negative in [**6-5**].
Questionable retrocardiac opacity on CXR prior to admission, also with history of upper respiratory symptoms that resolved prior to admission.
Repeat CXR showed partial resolution of this opacity and as such he was continued on this 10 day course of antibiotics.
Patient with hyponatremia Na 128 on admission.
He is discharged with a sodium of 142. .
EKG consistent with old MI, age indeterminate though at least as old as [**2200-9-1**].
Cardiac enzymes were as follows: CK 933->910->922; CK-MB 42->39->35; MB Index 4.5->4.3->3.8; TnT 0.25->0.24->0.24.
Troponins on prior admission were 0.27 in [**9-5**].10 in [**6-5**] likely secondary to CRI, ?demand ischemia.
Repeat EKGs showed no change.
Discovered during syncope workup in [**6-5**].
Repeat EKG was unchanged.
Trace left sided CN 6 palsy on examination in hospital.
Electrolytes were monitored and replaced as needed.
