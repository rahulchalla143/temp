History of Present Illness: Pt is a 68 yo M with very complicated hx including diastolic CHF, probable CAD, s/p pacer for CHB, PE ([**2125**]), htn, dyslipidemia, tracheal stenosis s/p multiple T-tubes, dilations, stents, COPD, OSA, h/o pneumothorax, AAA s/p repair and s/p graft infection, axillary DVT, h/o seizure disorder, adrenal insufficiency on prednisone, h/o pseudomonas sepsis, h/o ARDS, h/o MRSA bronchitis, h/o c.diff, GIB, gout, balanitis, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and depression who presents today with hx of multiple falls over the past few weeks and en route for an outpatient head CT was noted to have decreased BP in the 90s and slurred speech.
He was enroute to have a repeat head CT today and in the ambulance was noted to have a slight decrease in BP to the 90's and ?slurred speech (which he states is not slurred, just his mouth is very dry).
In the AM of [**2127-10-14**], the patient was noted to have a SBP around 80, and was given a 500cc fluid bolus.
His O2 saturation dropped and his SBP went from 80s to 50-60 range.
He was then started on levophed 0.04 with good response and SBP into the 100-110s.
He was given a head CT and torso CT (negative) and admitted to the CCU.
Presumed Coronary artery disease with last evaluation [**2-3**] (negative P-MIBI) 2.

MIBI: Normal Persantine MIBI study with a left ventricular ejection fraction calculated to be 52%.
CT head: No evidence of acute mass effect, hemorrhage or territorial infarction.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: A large bleb in the right lung is unchanged.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There is poor vascular enhancement by IV contrast, which may be due to the patient's cardiac status.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There are calcifications within the iliac vessels, without evidence of an extravasation.
An EKG was performed which revealed no changes from previous.
Cardiac troponins were drawn and were shown to be flat.
Because the patient has a history of CAD s/p PCI in [**2-/2127**], a Persantine MIBI scan was performed to assess for restenosis.
Repeat EKG again showed no change, and repeated serial troponins were negative.
However, in the AM on [**10-13**] the patient experienced an episode of unresponsiveness with BP falling into the 60s systolic.
The BP responded to Levophed at 0.04 with SBP rising to 100-110.
It has been at least partially attributed to his narcotics regimen, however, Narcan was administered during his hypotension with no resolution of his signs.
LLL lung nodule:  A nodule has been noted in a previous CT scan of the chest which was going to be followed up as an outpatient for CT-guided biopsy.
The procedure has been rescheduled for [**2127-10-22**], and the patient was instructed not to take his Plavix or Aspirin 325 for 5 days prior to the procedure.
He has had 2 outpatient CT head with no abnormalities seen.
His CXR was consistent with mild volume overload, but he had no exacerbation of his CHF during his stay.
Per the PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient typically requires around 600mg-800mg divided TID to maintain phenytoin levels between [**11-20**].
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Dx: Chest pain Hypotension Leg weakness   Discharge Condition: Stable, tolerating PO and ambulating with assistance.
You have an appointment for a CT-guided lung biopsy on [**2127-10-22**] at 9:30 AM on the [**Location (un) 470**] of the [**Hospital Unit Name 1825**] on the [**Hospital Ward Name **] of [**Hospital1 18**].
