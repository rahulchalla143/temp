A single periampullary diverticulum with small opening was found at the major papilla.
The intrahepatic cholangiogram was normal with no filling defects.
CTA at OSH found questionable evidence of aortic dissection in 3 areas and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
On further review of CT scan after admission it was determined that the patient had stable endovascular ulcerations and not an aortic dissection.
On further investigation of abdominal pain the patient was found to have elevated LFT's and bilirubin and was found to have suggestion of cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis on MRCP.

COMPARISON: CT from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital dated [**2185-10-17**].
Right upper quadrant ultrasound from [**2185-10-17**].
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the abdomen were obtained on 1.5 Tesla magnet including dynamic 3D imaging obtained prior to, during, and after the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadolinium-DTPA.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations along with subtraction images were generated on an independent workstation.
MRI OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Gallbladder is distended and filled with innumerable small gallstones.
The extent of gallbladder distention is unchanged compared to the recent CT and ultrasound, however, circumferential gallbladder wall edema appears markedly increased in the interval.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations were essential in providing multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
Six-month followup MRCP is recommended to evaluate for stability of this finding.
[**2185-10-20**] Echocardiogram: Conclusions:  EF 50% The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 yo M who was admitted to the vascular surgery service on [**2185-10-17**] with epigastric pain and concern for aortic dissection on CT scan at OSH.
On further review of CT scan after admission it was determined that the patient had stable endovascular ulcerations and not an aortic dissection.
In addition his LFT's continued to improve and were essentially normal prior to discharge with AST 23 ALT 68.
2)Endovascular ulcerations of abdominal aorta - initially admitted from OSH with concern for aortic dissection however after further review of CT scan it was determined that he had stable endovascular ulcerations not requiring surgery.
He should follow up with vascular surgery and have repeat CT scan in 6 months.
His blood pressure was controlled in the ICU and he was discharged on lisinopril 10mg daily, toprol xl 100mg daily and doxazosin2mg [**Hospital1 **].
Hct remained stable since with no recurrent episodes of bleeding throughout the rest of his admission.
This medication was held throughout admission due to elvated liver enzymes in the setting of choledocholithiasis.
Abdominal Aorta Dissection - 3 focal areas of ulceration 2.
Followup Instructions: Call Vascular Surgery  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]/[**Doctor Last Name **] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2395**] to schedule follow up and CT scan in 1 month.
