Emergent echo showed no tamponade, but decreased cardiac function likely cardiogenic shock.
Hct was checked and 25 (5 pt drop).
CXR was negative for PTX.
He was hypothermic and had a lactate of 10.
His ABGs were monitored and vent settings optimized.
Past Medical History: CAD, CABG in [**2139**] Multiple stents [**2150**]-[**2154**] PVD renal and peripheral stents TURP Bilateral hernia repair Carotid stenosis less than 60% on right ICA,  Less than 40% left ICA on [**2155-11-28**] Pneumonia/bronchitis [**2157**] Memory problems [**Name (NI) **] of hearing, cannot hear in left ear at all, hearing aide right ear   Social History: -unable to obtain  Family History: -unable to obtain  Physical Exam: VS: 94, 80 (V paced), 112/40, 20, 92% GENERAL: intubated, not responding to verbal, tactile, noxious stimuli HEENT: Atraumatic, PER @ 7 mm, non-reactive (hx of b/l cataract [**Doctor First Name **]) CARDIAC: RRR (paced) unable to appreciate any murmurs, + [**Hospital1 1516**] pads LUNGS: diffuse rales ABDOMEN: soft, unable to appreciate BS over IABP EXTREMITIES: no edema, unable to palpate or doppler pulses   Pertinent Results: TTE [**2159-1-10**] Poor image quality.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %).
EEG [**2159-1-10**] IMPRESSION: This long-term EEG showed an encephalopathic background throughout.
EEG [**2159-1-11**] IMPRESSION: This long-term EEG showed an encephalopathic background throughout.
EEG [**2159-1-12**] This EEG telemetry with video showed a low voltage mildly slow background throughout, without any evidence of seizures or epileptiform discharges.
EEG [**2159-1-21**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry showed a markedly encephalopathic background throughout.
EEG [**2159-1-22**] This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2159-1-12**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2159-1-23**] IMPRESSION: 1.
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND [**2159-1-16**] 1.
ABDOMINAL XRAY [**2159-1-16**] Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of obstruction .
CXR [**2159-1-16**] Persistent bilateral pneumonia, or resuscitation-related lung contusion.
CXR [**2159-1-9**] The patient is intubated, the tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 2 cm above the carina.
CXR [**2159-1-23**] Endotracheal tube is in standard placement.
While the patient never appeared to recover completely after inital cardiogenic shock, his neurological exam notably deteriorated after second arrest.
After extensive neurologic work-up and medical management, the patient's family ultimately decided to make the patient comfotable.
Cardiac biomarkers were not consistent with acute MI.
An emergent echocardiogram was negative for tamponade and revealed severely depressed cardiac function.
TTE revealed EF 30%, right ventricular cavity dilation and depressed free wall contractility, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate PA systolic HTN.
His pressures improved and the IABP was discontinued.
A repeat Hct revealed a 5 point drop.
He was given a total of 3 units of PRBC, and serial Hcts were monitored.
IR was consulted for possible angio embolization, who recommended CTA chest and aortogram which were deferred given the patient was not stable.
His neurologic exam continued to improve.
A non contrast head CT was consistent with extensive subcortical white matter disease, unclear how much secondary to prior ischemia versus current event.
After second arrest and re-intubation a repeat EEG demonstrated again slow low voltage background, with additional bursts of additional slowing indicative of widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
Off sedation for several days, his exam was notable for intact brainstem reflexes and purposeful movements of his extremities.
A repeat non contrast head CT was unchanged.
However, in the setting of eye exam and inability to respond to commands several days off sedation there was significant concern for brainstem injury not visualized on CT. .
Cardiac biomarkers show mildly elevated trop, but flat CK and CKMB making an ischemic event unlikely.
Last echo with EF of 35%, echo performed during cath showed severely depressed global function.
A repeat echo demonstrated an EF of 30%, right ventricular cavity dilation and depressed free wall contractility, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate PA systolic HTN.
His pressures improved and the IABP was discontinued.
# RHYTHM: Underlying rhythm is Atrial Fibrillation and Complete Heart Block with evidence of ventricular pacing.
The QRS complexes on EKG are not consistent with BiVentricular pacing.
He was monitored on telemetry.
# CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Creatinine on presentation was 2.4 with unclear baseline.
The patient likely experienced insult to his kidneys during hypotension; however, his creatinine remained relatively stable at 2.0 in the setting of intial diuresis and then second arrest.
