He was following commands, but more confused that his baseline, which is A+Ox3.
, In the ED, the patient was taken for CT head and CXR, and was noted to be non-responsive after the imaging studies.
The CXR that was done pre-arrest showed bilateral plerual effusions and interstitial edema.
A bedside echo showed no RV strain.
Only exam finding before code was mild abdominal pain.
Vital signs on transfer pulse 59 BP 137/51 RR 18 100%/RA.

CT head w/o contrast [**2113-6-4**]: 1.
CXR (portable AP) [**2113-6-4**]: 1.
The pt arrived to the MICU intubated and on blood pressure support.
Patient's FAST exam was negative in the ER and blood cultures on admission were positive which suggests septic shock as possible cause of asystole.
However, the EEG showed epileptiform activity and keppra was started.
# Hypotension: Vital signs were normal on initial presentation but he became hypotensive requiring Levophed for blood pressure support s/p arrest.
His hypotension could be related to cardiac stunning in setting of recent arrest but was more likely related to underlying sepsis.
Echo was orderd in the ICU which showed focal regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
The patient continued to require norepinephrine for blood pressure support.
With acute renal failure and poor urine output, and hypervolemia on exam, the patient was transitioned to low dose dopamine gtt with lasix boluses on [**2113-6-8**], which improved his blood pressures and his creatinine 1.8 --> 1.7 with good urine output (100cc/hr X2-3 hours with each bolus).
CT head was non-focal, and MRI after arrest without signs of hypoxic brain injury.
His underlying toxic-metabolic encephalopathy is likely contributing as well.
Neurology followed and recommended continuing EEG with somatosensory potential evaluation from [**6-4**] and [**6-7**] respectively.
He was broadly covered with vanc/zosyn, and urine culture was sent.
