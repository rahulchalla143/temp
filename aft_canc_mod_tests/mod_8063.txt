[**5-9**] HISTORY: Respiratory distress.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-19**] through [**4-21**]: Right lung base is elevated yet heart, mediastinum is shifted to the right indicating that whatever pleural effusion is present is offset by a greater volume of right middle and lower lobe collapse.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 M w/ recent admission for painless jaundice s/p [**Month (only) **] with sphincterotomy and biliary stent c/b hypoxia requiring intubation, admitted with septic shock; source unclear, but differential diagnostic considerations included pneumonia, infectious diarrhea, or less likely cholangitis.
Blood cultures grew out methicillin-resistant staph aureus on hospital day two, and pt continued on vancomycin.
Cortisol levels responded appropriately to ACTH stimulation and so steroids were not used.
An autopsy was requested, specifically to evaluate the nature and extent of the patient's incompletely diagnosed biliary tract malignancy.
