This LP showed no evidence of infection.
He was receiving treatment from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 3278**], including gamma-knife in [**2163-3-10**], and had multiple similar admissions in [**Month (only) **] and [**Month (only) 205**] for confusion that improved with pulse dexamethasone.
He unfortunately failed to followup, and his FSG were 300+ at home.
On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he had a glucose of 432 and an anion gap of 30.
FSG were still intermittently into the 300-400 range, and glargine was uptitrated as needed.

UA was not suggestive of UTI.
ALT was notable to be 49 otherwise normal LFT.

Torso CT revealed lung nodules.
On [**2162-3-22**], he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] a CT-guided liver biopsy confirming melanoma.
F/U brain MRI in early [**Month (only) 216**] showed several new small brain lesions without associated edema.
F/U brain MRI revealed resolution of the largest CNS lesion with growth in some smaller lesions felt to be ipilimumab effect.
Torso CT revealed continued improvement in systemic disease.
Torso CT was stable.
Family History: no history of melanoma   Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM  98.1, HR 111, BP 135/80, RR 13, Sat 97%RA.
DISCHARGE EXAM 99.1  118-130/74-82 89-97 16 98/RA BG 190 dinner, 199 HS, 95 AM GENERAL: NAD, cushingoid appearance with moon fascies CARDIAC: RRR S1/S2, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs LUNG: crackles at the right base ABDOMEN: nondistended, +BS, nontender in all quadrants EXTREMITIES: moving all extremities well, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, no obvious deformities SKIN: distal vitiligo  Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS  [**2163-8-14**] 02:00PM BLOOD WBC-10.6 RBC-4.03* Hgb-12.8* Hct-35.3* MCV-88 MCH-31.7 MCHC-36.2* RDW-15.6* Plt Ct-273# [**2163-8-14**] 02:00PM BLOOD Glucose-432* UreaN-31* Creat-0.5 Na-133 K-4.0 Cl-96 HCO3-7* AnGap-34* [**2163-8-14**] 02:00PM BLOOD ALT-49* AST-14 AlkPhos-62 TotBili-0.7 [**2163-8-14**] 05:18PM BLOOD Calcium-8.3* Phos-1.6*# Mg-1.8 [**2163-8-14**] 02:33PM BLOOD Lactate-2.1*  IMAGING CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2163-8-14**]) FINDINGS: Multiple supratentorial hyperdense lesions are again demonstrated, compatible with metastatic disease and are largely unchanged since CT exam of [**2163-8-1**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
MRI BRACHIAL PLEXUS ([**2163-8-15**]) 1.
The known brain metastases were incompletely imaged at this time.
Evaluation of cervical nerve roots would be better assessed on the cervical MRI performed [**2163-8-3**].
CXR ([**2163-8-14**]) 1.
Consider repeat CXR to confirm.
CXR ([**2163-8-16**]) Small to moderate right pleural effusion is new, accompanying a large region of interstitial infiltration in the right lower lung, and growing heterogeneous opacification of the left suprahilar lung.
Sensory NCS of the right lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve was normal.
Sensory NCS of the left lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve demonstrated decreased response amplitude and normal conduction velocity.
THYROID ULTRASOUND [**2163-8-18**] FINDINGS:  The right thyroid lobe measures 1.5 x 1.9 x 4.5 cm and contains a well-circumscribed, avascular, hypoechoic nodule measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm in the middle portion of the thyroid lobe.
No lymphadenopathy in the neck  CXR [**2163-8-19**] IMPRESSION:  Improving right pleural effusion.
CT Chest [**2163-8-20**] IMPRESSION: 1.
He was started on D51/2NS and electrolytes were monitored Q6H and replaced as needed.
# IDDM: His sugars were initally difficult to control in the ICU.
On the floor, blood sugars remained labile, and patient had several AM episodes of hypoglycemia.
Could be [**2-10**] progressing metastatic disease (as shown on MRI [**2163-8-3**]) vs. metabolic due to uncontrolled diabetes.
No malignant cells were seen on LP [**8-5**] and MRI C spine revealed no malignant leptomeningeal disease.
A finding of right arm weakness prompted MRI of the brachial plexi which were neurologically unremarkable, but reflected a worsening burden of pulmonary metastases.
His CXR at that time reflected a possible multilobar pneumonia which was broadly covered as HCAP with vancomycin and cefepime.
Chest CT on [**8-20**] showed diffuse ground glass and solid nodular opacities with more confluent opacity at the right lung base, with 2 lesions with central cavitation.
Blood cultures were repeatedly negative, so septic emboli felt to be less likely.
Infectious disease was consulted and initial fungal studies were sent.
Additional workup, including serial AFB sputum cultures to rule out TB were recommended.
MRI of brachial plexus and CT of chest showed probable progression of metastatic burden in lungs.
Transition issues: - recheck TFTs [**2163-8-25**] and adjust dose of thyroid hormone - Beta glucan, galactomannan, cryptococcal antigen, legionella antigen - sputum culture (including AFB) not done as inpatient; mycobacterial infection cannot be decisively ruled out  Medications on Admission: 1.
Sodium Chloride 1 gm PO THREE TIMES A DAY (stopped given lower extremity swelling) 5.
A chest CT [**2163-8-19**] showed new lung lesions.
Fungal lab studies were sent.
We discussed that work-up of these lesions was not yet complete, and that further workup would include sputum testing to rule out tuberculosis.
