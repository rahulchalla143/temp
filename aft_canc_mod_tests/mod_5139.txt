At the OSH she recieved one unit of platelets for a platelet count of 10.
Hematocrit was 26.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
Her temperature was noted to be 100.6.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] her vital signs were stable.
Her SBPs trended down to the upper 80s and she was transfused an additional unit of PRBCs for possible bleed (hematocrit was around 29 at that time and had risen appropriately).
She was also transfused platelets to keep her platelet count >50.
She was started on cipro/flagyl to cover for posisble diverticulitis seen on CT abdomen.
She was also noted to be slightly hypoxic with O2 saturations 92% off O2.
Her CXR was clear and it did not appear she had an infection.
Stress MIBI [**9-6**] showed moderate inferolateral reversible defect.
