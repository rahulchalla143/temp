REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for constipation, positive for hearing loss, which is chronic, positive for taking good po, positive for bilateral knee pain, which is also chronic and positive for a 12 pound weight loss over the past year, which was not intentional.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs temperature 97.3.
Pulse 99.
Blood pressure 183/76.
Respiratory rate 16.
HEENT examination no nystagmus.
Cardiovascular examination regular rate and rhythm.
Lungs clear to auscultation with occasional wheezes and crackles.
Neurological examination cranial nerves II through XII intact.
Sensation and light touch intact bilaterally.
Reflexes 2+ patella, bicipital bilaterally.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 5.6, hematocrit 33.9, sodium 139, potassium 3.6, chloride 106, bicarbonate 24, BUN 12, creatinine 0.7, glucose 119, LDH 865, which was hemolyzed.
PTT 55.9, INR 1.7.
ALT 30, AST 129, which changed to 47 with a nonhemolyzed specimen.
Albumin 4.2 amylase 107, lipase 45.
Urinalysis was essentially negative.
Chest x-ray flattening of hemidiaphragm, positive atelectasis, positive opacity in left lower lobe nodule.
Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 96 beats per minute, first degree AV block, left axis deviation, which is new, right bundle branch block, which is old, no acute ST or T wave changes.
Head CT on [**10-31**] showed positive calcified density in right ethmoid sinus with unclear etiology.
Neurological examination unremarkable.
Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and was admitted and placed on telemetry and monitored with serial CKs and troponin.
The patient's troponins trended down over the next several days.
She underwent an echocardiogram the following day, which showed inferior hypokinesis consistent with an inferior myocardial infarction.
Further imaging was done with MR [**Last Name (Titles) 9868**], which further delineated the mass and showed that it was more consistent with a tumor.
After much discussion it was decided that if no further surgical workup was to be planned and no further chemotherapy would be planned the patient was to continue on Tamoxifen and would be offered radiation therapy with the understanding that this may not be a tumor, however, the benefits of palliating her symptoms would out weigh her chances of getting morbidity from the radiation itself.
A workup was done with a mixing study, which revealed lupus anticoagulant as the etiology of her coagulopathy and for this reason she will not be continued on any sort of anticoagulation.
The patient went to the Intensive Care Unit for a day to monitor her for further bleeding, however, her hematocrit and hemodynamics were stable and she was not transfused and not endoscoped as she had just suffered an myocardial infarction.
