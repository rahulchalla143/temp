CXR [**10-22**].
Upon discharge her BP ranged from SBP 120-130s directly after dialysis to SBP 140-180 on non-dialysis days.
When she did exceed SBP > 200, or DBP > 120, she was given hydralazine 5mg IV with appropriate effect.
A temporary line was briefly used and then a new tunneled catheter was placed once surveillance cultures returned negative.
It was not clear if her headache was due to hypertension or if she was having a migraine.
Throughout her course, her HA occurred nearly daily and had no clear association with her blood pressure.
Parathyroid scan on [**2116-10-2**] showed anterior mediastinal parathyroid adenoma.
The day of the proposed operation, however, her blood pressure was so poorly controlled that anesthesiology thought it unsafe to proceed with surgery.
She was recommended to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26030**] as an outpatient with an appropriate anesthesiology pre-operative evaluation given the severity of her hypertension.
She was continued on coumadin in the hospital with her INR within goal range of [**2-8**].
Also instructed INR monitoring during HD.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR at each Hemodialysis visit and forward information to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 29653**] Z [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 40070**] so that he may adjust her coumadin dosing.
Your blood pressure was controlled by increasing your medications and your headache was controlled with agressive pain relief.
Follow-up with your [**Hospital 197**] Clinic 3-5 days post-discharge for a INR check and dose adjustment.
