MEDICAL DECISION MAKING EKG [**2151-7-2**] shows sinus tach.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Post-procedure ECHO performed on [**2151-7-2**] at 6:08:27 demonstrated: In single view, there is only a small pericardial effusion.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2151-7-2**] demonstrated: systolic arterial HTN, mild pulsus paradoxus, hemodynamics c/w low pressure tamponade, with some equalization of RA and pericardial pressure.
Bedside echo showing minimal pericardial fluid.
OTHER TESTING: CT chest [**2151-6-24**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Further evaluation for bony metastases could be performed with a bone scan.
CXR [**2151-7-2**]:IMPRESSION: 1.

Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and low lung volumes.
The patient presented with a pericardial effusion seen on Chest CT [**6-24**].
Pt was feeling weak and dyspneic and an echocardiogram on [**2151-7-2**] revealed low pressure tamponade physiology.
Cultures from pericardial fluid were positive for staph and enterococcus and vancomycin and levofloxacin were started.
Her ABGs showed respiratory acidosis with high CO2 retention.
