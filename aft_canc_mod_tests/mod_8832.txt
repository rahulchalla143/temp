CXR - IMPRESSION: Multifocal lung opacities, the larger one is located in the left upper lobe.
Cerebral Angiogram:  Prelim - flow through right vertebral and basilar, normal.
Patient was admitted to Neurology service for further evaluation and treatment.
1) Neuro:  He underwent a CT head revealing no new pathology and EEG revealing mild encephalopathy.
He underwent an MRI/a of the brain which showed a low flow at R vertebral and basilar, no infarction in the brainstem and the old L parietal/temporal infarct with chronic WMD.
An urgent cerebral angiogram revealed full flow in R vertebral and basilar arteries.
Echocardiogram showed no evidence of an embolus.
Given hx of exposure to two doses of celexa an having taken Ginko Biloba as a supplement, along with fluctuating examination of increased LE tone, hyperreflexia and intermittent clonus > UE, a dx of serotonin syndrom was considered, however, the exam was fluctuating and patient also had an underlying PNA, which were felt to be the better explanations for his symptoms, including possible temporary basilar insufficiency, leading to b/l pontine symptoms (in addition patient had disconjugate eye movements in vertical and horizontal directions)  On [**2134-11-7**] the patient began to be much more responsive and beagn to follow simple midline and appendicular commands.
His neurologic exam on day of transfer was also significant for residual right-sided hemiparesis from his prior stroke.
His hematocrit was noted to be dropping.
A CT scan was ordered and the patient was found to have had a large left sided RP bleed.
The patient continued to lose blood over the next 3 days requiring 2U of PRBC x 3.
Repeat abdominal CT done on [**2134-11-22**] showed that the retroperitoneal hematoma.
TTE showed LAD, EF 50-55% with mild dilatation and mild aortic root dilatation with 2+MR, 3+ severe TR, and significant PR.
ROMI was completed, with peak troponin of 0.05, felt to be due to renal failure and w/o ekg correlate.
Creatinine peaked at 2.4 and noted to have granular casts on microscopic exam suggesting ATN.
In addition his abdominal pressure was increased also contributing to renal dysfunction.
At time of discharge, creatinine was 1.4 and BUN was 23.
WBC count peaked at 16K.
LP showed 4 wBCs and 5 RBCs, w/o growth, predominantly mono/lymphs.
He was noted to have an LUL infiltrate on CXR and was treated for HAP as above, then narrowed to coverage for MSSA.
UCx and BCx were negative.
Neuro exam is significant for mild dysarthria, motor weakness throughout (R>L), and has right pronator drift.
