However, if there is high concern for a marrow replacing lesion, an MRI or perhaps bone scan would be helpful.

He had insufficient urine output so renal was consulted, a temporary HD line was placed, and he was started on dialysis.
He had known mediastinal lymphadenopathy and known adnocarcinoma of unkown primary (see oncology section below) so he was scheduled for a CT head and torso to evaluate his malignancy.
The study was performed on [**2115-5-22**] and afterward he was noted to be apneic.
CT revealed a left psoas bleed with extension into the thigh.
A biopsy of an RP lymph node revealed adenocarcinoma, but unclear primary.
After discussion with oncology, the plan was to perform a thoracentesis and send the pleural fluid for cytology, and to try and obtain another tissue biopsy for further diagnostic information.
He was continued on calcitriol, calcium carbonate, sevelamer, nephrocaps, and vitamin D. .
