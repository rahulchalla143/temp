The patient recently was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] hospital from [**2147-6-9**] to [**2147-6-13**] for an elective excisional biopsy of diffuse lymphadenopathy, most prominent in her left groin.
Based on limited records, her creatinine was 0.9 at that time.
Today, at the [**Hospital1 1501**] her labs were checked and she was found to have a K of 7.8 and a creatinine of 9.9.
The patient herself reports that she feels that her urine output has been decreasing lately along with some increased generalized edema.
On labs, her K was 8.6 and her creatinine was 10.6.
A left lower extremity ultrasound was negative for clot.
Other notable labs include a uric acid level of 10.1 and a phosphate of 6.7.
Her K after the above interventions dropped to 6.3, and given an EKG that did not show evidence of cardiac toxicity, dialysis was not initiated.

A future study is recommended in [**3-17**] weeks to try to attempt reconversion of the right-sided nephrostomy tube to a nephroureteral stent and to try to further characterize the filling defect seen in the right renal pelvis, which could be an air bubble.
[**2147-7-18**] 11:23 AM # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103898**]   RENAL U.S.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended to assess aortic valve morphology.
[**2147-7-19**] Radiology MRI PELVIS W/O & W/CONT 1.
An 1.8-cm lymph in the left common iliac chain has similar characteristics, and also is concerning for a suppurative lymph node.
Edema and swelling of the left iliacus and obturator internus muscles is suggesting of an ongoing inflammatory or infectious process.
[**2147-7-24**] Radiology MR THIGH W&W/O CONTRAST 1.
Fluid tracks along the superficial fascia, but this is unlikely to represent fasciitis given the lack of fascial enhancement.
[**2147-7-27**] Radiology CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION:  No findings to suggest pulmonary infection with unchanged prominent lymph nodes as above.
[**2147-8-21**] Antegradge nephrogram IMPRESSION: 1.
Left antegrade nephrostogram demonstrated brisk passage of contrast through the left ureter into the urinary bladder.
Right antegrade nephrostogram did not demonstrate hydroureteronephrosis.

# Follicular Lymphoma: Final pathology showed follicular lymphoma, follicular growth pattern, cytological grade 1 of 3.
Pt had an excisional biopsy of R upper extremity subcutaneous nodule by general surgery on [**2147-7-25**], but these only showed organizing hematoma, perhaps from prior drug use.
[**2147-8-12**] CT abdomen showed interval improvement in retroperitoneal masses and improvement of bilateral hydronephrosis.
# Acute renal failure/obstructive uropathy: Pt presented in profound obstructive renal failure with Cr 10.6 and potassium 8.6.
Pt had little urine output from L nephro-ureteral stent (~250mL over 16 hrs) but plentiful urine output from R nephrostomy (~2.4L over 16 hrs).
Repeat renal ultrasound showed complete resolution of L hydronephrosis and almost complete resolution of R hydronephrosis.
Patient with good UOP and creatinine of 1.1 at time of discharge  # UTI.
Iron studies suggestive of anemia of chronic disease.
HCT 26.8 on discharge.
