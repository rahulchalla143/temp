History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 805**] is a 60 year old female with a history of neurofibromatosis, COPD on 2L home O2, systolic HF 40-45%, PE, adrenal insufficiency due to chronic steroids, who was transferred to the MICU from the ED for management of dyspnea and evaluation of high lactate.
Initial vitals in the ED were T 97.7 HR 80 BP 126/72 RR 24 Sat 100% 4L Nasal Cannula.
Her lactate trended from 3.2 to 4.0 while in the ED, but was down to 2.8 by tranfer.
The morphine was administered for chest pain that occurred at some point in the ED, first set of troponins were negative and EKG was unremarkable.
She had a recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2172-4-15**] to [**2172-4-17**] for evaluation of chest pain and presyncope, which were thought to be non-cardiac in origin -- COPD vs musculoskeletal.
Congestive heart failure with LVEF 30% 3.
Pulmonary embolism [**2158**] 5.
Neurofibromatosis Type 1 6.
Malignant nerve sheath tumor (s/p removal from left anterior chest wall [**6-18**] and radiation [**2172**]) 7.
C. diff colitis [**1-/2172**], recurred [**3-/2172**]   Social History: Ms. [**Known lastname 805**] lives with her boyfriend in a trailer in [**Name (NI) 3146**], MA.
EXTREMITIES: Mild, non-pitting upper and lower extremity edema Skin: Flesh-colored, 0.5-1 cm nodules over entire body (consistent with known NF-1), ecchymoses over sites of trauma and injections on all 4 limbs.

CXR [**2172-5-1**]: In comparison with study of [**4-30**], there has been placement of a right IJ catheter that extends to the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.
CXR [**2172-5-1**]: In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the questioned opacification at the right base is less prominent and may merely represented fortuitous overlap of normal pulmonary vessels.
LENI [**2172-5-1**]: 1.
Slightly dampened respiratory variation within the left venous system, however, this is likely due to compression from the patient's pannus which was asymmetrically positioned overlying the left groin.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 year-old female with a history of COPD on 2L home O2 (with multiple recent admissions for COPD exacerbation), neurofibromatosis, systolic HF with EF 40-45%, PE, history of adrenal insufficiency due to chronic steroids, initially transferred to the MICU for management of dyspnea and elevated serum lactate, transferred to floor without intubation and O2 sat 96-98% prior to discharge with normalized lactate.
#) COPD exacerbation: Patient presented from home [**2172-4-29**] with dyspnea with O2 sat 100% on 4L and tight, non-radiating chest pain.
Her last outpatient PFTs on [**2172-4-27**] with FEV1/FVC of 66% and FEV1 of 41% predicted with DLCO 27%, indicating moderate to severe disease.
Final urine cultures returned as E. coli resistant to Levofloxacin, so patient was started on 5-day course of Nitrofurantoin (until [**2172-5-10**]).
Upon presentation, ABG was not acidotic with pH 7.49 and pCO2 36. .
On discharge, SBP 105; not orthostatic by vitals nor symptomatic and Hct stable.
Myocardial infarction was ruled out with no EKG changes and negative cardiac enzymes x3.
Repeat EKGs at time of pain showed no change from baseline.
#) Congestive heart failure with LVEF 40-45%.
Creatinine upon admission was elevated to 1.6 but at time of discharge was 0.8.
Physical exam was notable for positive right knee medial joint line tenderness without swelling, erythema, or effusion.

You were taken to the intensive care unit for close monitoring, and then you were brought to the medicine service.
You had several episodes of chest tightness with shortness of breath, which we evaluated with imaging of your chest (chest x-ray), and heart (EKG and telemetry), which were negative for heart attack.
You also had imaging of your legs to look for [**Hospital **] clots (LENI), which was negative as well.
On the last two days of your hospital stay, your [**Hospital **] pressure was lower running, so we held your [**Hospital **] pressure medications (Metoprolol and Lisinopril) when you left the hospital.
To monitor your heart condition, please weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
