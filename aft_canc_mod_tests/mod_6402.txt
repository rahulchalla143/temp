Evaluation of the opthamic veins is limited on the present study.
This can be performed with CT Venogram.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2186-7-19**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been interval left frontal craniotomy.
Post-surgical changes underlying the left retro-orbital region, with pneumocephalus and a thin rim of hyperdense material consistent with blood products.
Orbits are incompletely assessed on this study, though the degree of mass effect upon the left extraocular muscles and globe appears reduced compared to MRI performed one day prior.
After initial evaluation in the Emergency room he was admitted to the neurosurgical service for further workup and treatment.
An MRI of the brain and orbits revealed a 2.8 x 2.7 x 2.1-cm lesion within the left retroorbital space and middle cranial fossa, adjacent soft tissues, laterally and into infratemporal fossa, and preseptal soft tissues, with osseous destruction invovling sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] and intraorbital extension causing mass effect upon the rectus muscles, optic nerve and globe.
Interop cultures and tissue pathology suspicious for old abscess; final microbiology cultures and tissue pathology is pending at this time.
On [**7-28**] sutures were removed and skeletal survery showed no additional tumor sites.
His DVT is being controlled with coumadin, upper extremity doppler scan showed improvement of clot in SVC and stable right basilic clot.
He will also follow up with neurosurgery in 4 weeks with a CT scan.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain with contrast prior to your follow up appointment.
FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-27**] DAYS TO HAVE BLOOD DRAWN for your anticoagulation therapy for your upper extremity blood clot.
The goal INR is INR [**2-28**].
