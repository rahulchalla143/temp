On arrival in the ED she had a temp of 100.4, HR 140, nml BP, RR 28, O2sat 91% on RA.
CTA showed PE and heparin gtt was started.
Thus, she was changed to Taxotere and received 3 cycles but then developed a rash on her hands and feet, neuropathy, and increased SOB so this was stopped.
Last BM yesterday which was nml.
Family History: thalasemia, G6-PD defciency, breast ca in aunt at age 60, father died of lung ca, no CAD/DM  Physical Exam: VS: 99.2, HR 127, BP 138/71, RR 44 (19-40), O2sat 95% on 2L NC, wt 60.7kg.
HEAD CT: 1.
ECHO [**3-27**]: 1.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
[**3-24**] PORTABLE AP CHEST: There is near complete opacification of the left lower lobe and probably a combination of effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis.
Heart size cannot be assessed.
CTA [**3-26**] 1.
pCXR [**3-28**] There is continued large loculated left pleural effusion with near total opacification of the left lung.
CT surgery was consulted and subsequently the patient underwent a VATS with removal of a large clot (coagulated blood from hemothorax), lysis of adhesions and placement of a chest tube and a Pleurex catheter.
Pt was to have an INR check the Monday after discharge.
Narrowing of L main bronchus: A Chest CT on admission revealed a LUL collapse with concern of left main bronchus compression.
The pt then underwent a flexible bronchoscopy which showed a near total collapse of the left main stem bronchus with passive exhalation (extrinsic) and complete collapse of left upper lobe bronchus which the IP team thought that was due to extrinsic compression of the bronchi by the pleural effusion.
ECHO dense pericardial effusion: The pt was noted to have a small, loculated (mostly anterior and medial) pericardial effusion.
NSCLC: In [**8-23**] the pt presented with cough x 1 month.
A CXR at the time showed a left upper lung mass.
A bronchoscopy showed adenocarcinoma that was felt to be unresectable as it was invading the mediastinum.
