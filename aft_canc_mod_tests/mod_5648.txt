CXR was difficult to read but was not suggestive of any infectious process and he was not put on antibiotics.
He was restarted on lasix at his home dose (80mg PO BID) as well as his lisinopril (30mg PO QD) on [**7-31**] after Creatinine came down to 1.3, but lasix/lisinopril/diamox were again held on [**8-1**] when his creatinine came back up to 1.5.
Creatinine was back at 1.1 on [**8-2**] and he was given Lasix 80mg PO X1 dose; his second dose of lasix and his lisinopril were held again with plans to restart on [**8-3**] if his creatinine had stabilized at 1.1 or lower.
Repeat creatinine on [**7-31**] was down to 1.3, and he was restarted on lasix and lisinopril.
However creatinine on [**8-1**] was back up to 1.5 and his lasix/lisinopril were again held.
Creatinine was 1.1 on [**8-2**] and he was given one lasix dose of 80mg PO; lisinopril was held.
h/o PE ([**1-/2185**]): Patient was on coumadin 15mg QD at admission and this was continued.
The goal INR was [**2-11**].
Repeat INR on [**7-31**] AM was 2.2 and he was put back on his home regimin of 15mg QHS.
INR on [**8-1**] was 2.5 and he was continued at 15mg QHS now that his INR was now back in the therapeutic range.
INR on [**8-2**] was 2.9 and coumadin at 15mg QHS was continued.
Please check INR daily and adjust dose of coumadin.
Please have your Creatinine (kidney function) checked and discuss with your primary care physician how to manage your lasix and lisinopril (whether they should be restarted) Please have your INR (blood thickness) checked and discuss your coumadin dose with your primary care physician.
