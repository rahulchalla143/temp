There was initial concern that she was somewhat somnolent so she was given narcan 0.4mg x 1 with some improvement in her MS.  She refused to undergo a head CT and the ER physicians felt she understood the risk of her refusal.
She had a CXR that was read as improved mild pulmonary vascular congestion, no focal consolidation or infiltrate.
Her EKG was A.flutter at 73, consistent with prior.
Labs were notable for a PCO2 of 56, [**Known lastname **] count of 4.1, which is down from 6.1 two days ago, lactate of 2.2.
Her current weight is 257lbs and weight on discharge was recorded to be 263.5lbs.
ROS: see hpi She denied any associated n/v/d, abdominal pain, chest pain, palpitations, HA, changes in her vision.
She says that her cough is the same as it has been since her recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2206-8-20**] with a presumed viral URI.

Microbiology: blood cultures ([**8-24**]):  [**1-14**] bottle coag neg staph [**8-26**] cultures no growth.
Imaging: CXR ([**8-24**]):  UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is continued moderate cardiomegaly.
Lung volumes remain low.
CXR ([**8-25**]):  FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**8-24**], there is continued mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Head CT [**8-25**]: FINDINGS: Again noted is encephalomalacia in the left cerebellum (image 3:3) and right occipital lobe (image 3:8), unchanged.
Her cough is unchanged from a recent admission and she is afebrile, with no leukocytosis or CXR findings that would support a pneumonia as the cause of her dyspnea.
Her current weight is 257lbs, which is 6lbs less than her recent discharge weight ([**8-20**]) which also makes a component of HF and volume overload less likely.
#) CAD: Given her acute presentation, cardiac enzymes were sent and negative.
Head CT was re-ordered as the patient does not remember the events prior to admission, results showed no acute changes.
Your evaluation did not show any signs of pneumonia or new [**Last Name **] problem.
