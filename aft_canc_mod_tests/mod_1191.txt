He completed his chemotherapy and radiation therapy on [**2135-3-24**], and was scheduled to have a followup CT scan on the date of preoperative testing.
As part of his evaluation for metastatic disease, he underwent a CT scan of the chest and abdomen on [**2134-12-31**].
He had no evidence of pulmonary metastasis, however, his liver demonstrated a 6 cm low density mass in the inferior segment of the right lobe of the liver that corresponded to increased uptake on PET scan.
On [**1-20**] a percutaneous CT guided liver biopsy was obtained that was interpreted as hepatocellular carcinoma.
His weight has been stable on tube feedings.
q.d., pravastatin, Hytrin, Ambien 5 mg p.o.

Pulses were 3 plus to 4 plus.
Cardiac exam was normal S1, S2, no S3, S4, murmurs, rubs or gallops, regular rate and rhythm.
Abdominal exam was benign, no hepatosplenomegaly, no masses, no tenderness.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies on admission included hemoglobin 11.4, hematocrit 34.5, white count 5.7, platelets 251.
INR 1.1.
Sodium 142, potassium 4.7, chloride 103, bicarb 29, BUN 28, creatinine 0.8.

Glucose 97.
His weight was stable on tube feeds.
He also had a 6 cm mass in the inferior right lobe of the liver and underwent a triphasic CT scan on [**4-16**] at that visit.
He has a lesion in segment 6 of the liver measuring 5.7 x 4.9 cm which was relatively unchanged from the CT scan in [**Month (only) 404**].
Chest CT demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary metastasis.
Preoperative labs were white count 5.8, hematocrit 33.3, platelet count 197.

PT 12.5, PTT 24.8, INR 1.
Urine output was 260 with 600 estimated blood loss.
Two units of packed red blood cells were given for hematocrit of 26.5.
Cultures were drawn.
Urine culture was no growth on [**6-9**].
JP gram stain showed no PMNs or microorganisms.
Fluid culture was coag positive staph, [**Doctor First Name **] bacterium rare growth.
On [**6-10**] blood cultures grew coag positive staph over three bottles and [**6-11**] and [**6-14**] blood cultures continued to be pending.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was done on postoperative day 10 which showed elongated left atrium, right atrium was moderately dilated, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with left ventricular cavity size normal, overall left ventricular systolic function was low normal with an ejection fraction of 50 to 55 percent.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
