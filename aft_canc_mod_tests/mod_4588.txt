No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch bilaterally.
MRI shows this mass to be containing subacute hemorrhage.
CT angiography in correlation with cerebral angiography demonstrates early venous filling adjacent to the left vertebral artery in relation with the posterior arch of C1 indicating a fistula.
However, cervical spine MRI with gadolinium can help for further assessment.
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at the time of interpretation of this study on [**2126-11-10**] at 10 a.m.  Cerebral Angiogram [**2126-11-10**]: Possible AVM from the left vertebral artery with possible cavernoma.
C/T-spine MRI [**2126-11-11**]: Unremarkable MRI scan.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 83717**] is a 35 yo male with a 3 week history of equilibrium problems; an outside MRI showed a right cerebellar mass vs. bleed.
On [**11-10**] an cerebral angiogram was performed which showed a possible AV fistula from the left vertebral artery.
On [**11-11**] a MRI of the C and T spine was performed which was unremarkable.
The mass was sent to pathology but the results are pending at the time of discharge.
The procedure went well and the patient was in the ICU overnight for Q 1 hour neuro checks and for blood pressure control.
He was discharged to home on [**2126-11-16**] with a plan to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to review the pathology in 2 weeks.
You will not an MRI as this was done while you were in the hospital.
