It was discussed that his last CT chest shows an increased right pleural effusion and that this could be the likely etiology of the increased work of breathing and oxygen requirement.
Labs at the OSH were notable for PTT 30, INR 1.3, BNP 201.
WBC 13.6, HCT 41.9, Trop < 0.01, AST 50, ALT 114.
Vitals were recorded as: T 98.3 ?????
?F, HR 111, RR 23, BP 143/86, O2 saturation 95% on 3L NC.
Physical exam was significant for wheezing, crackles, RLL decreased BS.
A chest x-ray was done, which showed moderated R sided pleural effusion and bilateral interstitial abnormalities.
CTA on [**6-7**] for DOE was negative for PE and CT torso on [**6-26**] showed infiltrative multifocal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the lung appears slightly worse with now increased septal thickening and pleural scalloping concerning for pleural involvement as well as increased right pleural effusion since the CTA.
Pathology of the RUL cellblock showed the same thing.
An ABG was obtained, which showed 7.42/40/75/27.
Past Oncologic History: - [**3-/2128**]: Noted progressive rectal discomfort.
- [**2128-4-28**]: Underwent CT scan due to worsening rectal pain.
He was put on a course of oral antibiotics and scheduled for a colonoscopy (he had never had a prior colonoscopy).
- [**2128-5-7**]: Underwent diagnostic colonoscopy with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; a digital rectal exam prior to the procedure revealed a  "hard rectal mass" and, on colonoscopy, he was found to have "a  frond-like villous nonobstructing large mass" within the distal  rectum that was partially circumferential.
A biopsy was taken, pathology of which demonstrated high-grade invasive adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell features.
- [**2128-5-13**]: Underwent an endoscopic ultrasound with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 41573**].
- 10/26/1: Began cycle 1 of adjuvant chemotherapy with modified  FOLFOX6; completed sixth/final cycle [**2129-5-3**] - [**2129-9-27**]: CT Torso done to evaluate elevated CEA revealed new retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, two ground-glass opacities in the right upper and lower lobes of the lungs, and a new 8 mm lesion at the dome of the liver, all consistent with recurrent/metastatic disease.
- [**2129-10-31**]: Began cycle 1 of palliative FOLFIRI and bevacizumab;  completed 6 cycles prior to disease progression (confirmed by transbronchial biopsy of a worsening infiltrative lesion in the  right upper lobe of the lung on [**2130-4-24**]) - [**2130-5-8**]: Began cycle 1 day 1 of palliative weekly irinotecan (120 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycle) and cetuximab (250 mg/m2 weekly after 400 mg/m2 loading dose on cycle 1 day 1)  - [**2130-6-21**]: Began palliative radiation to L4 vertebral metastasis  (20 Gy given over five 4 Gy treatments); chemo held during treatment  Social History: (per OMR) He lives in [**Location 47**] with his wife,[**Name (NI) **]; they have 3 grown children.

ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2130-7-9**]):    NO GROWTH.

IMAGING [**2130-7-3**] CHEST (PA & LAT): There are opacities throughout both lung fields some of which are more confluent in the right upper lobe.
Findings have worsened significantly since the chest radiograph from [**2130-4-6**], however, is stable compared to the most recent CT scan from [**2130-6-27**].
[**2130-7-3**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There are again seen airspace opacities throughout both lung fields more confluent within the right middle lobe at the site of known metastatic disease.
[**2130-7-3**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY: No pulmonary embolus.
[**2130-7-3**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities more confluent in the right upper lobe consistent with known metastatic disease.
[**2130-7-4**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**4-24**] through [**7-3**]:  Moderately-severe pulmonary edema which was present on [**7-3**], at 1:18 a.m. has improved, but there are now greater areas of consolidation in both lungs, partially in the upper lobe on the right and in several regions of the left lung, all an indication of progressive multifocal pneumonia.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 year old man with a history of recurrent/metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma who presents with one week of worsening shortness of breath  # hypoxic respiratory failure - Likely multifactorial and contribued to by fluid overload, increasing right-sided pleural effusion, progression of GGOs and lymphangitic spread of adenocarcinoma, as well as possibility of infection.
Additionally, repeat chest CT scan r/o PE but showed significant progression of GGOs and mets.
Initial sputum culture showed gram positive rods on gram stain, but no significant organisms other than commensal respiratory flora grew out.
Furthermore, pleural fluid showed no organisms.
Urine legionella was negative.
Bronchoscopy was considered and was ultimately decided that this would not be beneficial.
However, CT chest done this admission showed two enhancing liver lesions.
# Transaminitis - Previous records report that it is presumably due to hepatotoxicity from his external beam radiation, but could also be due to his chemotherapy.
However, given that this CT chest showed two enhancing liver lesions, liver mets are also of concern.
Hepatitis serologies were recently checked, which showed immunization to hep B and neg for hep C.  # Altered Mental status: The patient developed marked confusion in the setting of recieving ativan, in addition to the initiation of steroids.
