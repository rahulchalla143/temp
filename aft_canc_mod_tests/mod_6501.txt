CXR [**2164-1-1**]: FINDINGS: No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen on this single frontal view.
CT abdomen [**2164-1-2**]: ABDOMEN: Included views of the lung bases demonstrate an ill-defined 5-mm ground-glass opacity at the right base (2:4), new since the [**2163-10-31**] CT examination.
Non-contrast-enhanced images of the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are normal.
PELVIS: The uterus, urinary bladder, rectum, and intrapelvic loops of small and large bowel are normal.
Interval near-resolution of a left lower quadrant mesenteric mass.
CT chest [**2164-1-3**]: The central lymph nodes in the mediastinum are not enlarged, although a 9 mm wide lower paraesophageal node, 2:23 was substantially smaller on the [**2163-11-28**] PET scan.
Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2164-1-4**])- The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) secondary to ventricular interaction.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-1-4**], biventricular systolic function is improved and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation is reduced.
UA unremarkable, urine culture negative.
Urine legionella negative.
Sputum negative for PCP.
Stool sent for culture given diarrhea; c.diff negative x 2.
CT scan of chest showed diffuse ground glass opacification on right with small consolidative lesions bilaterally with new left hilar adenopathy, thought to be most consistent with a viral process.
Viral studies including adenovirus PCR and viral sputum culture were negative.
Repeat echo was normal indicating changes were likely due to sepsis.
She was supported with transfusion of PRBCs and platelets to keep Hct<24 and plt<20.
Mid-treatment PET (on [**2163-11-28**]) showed near complete resolution of the mesenteric mass with minimal residual non FDG avid soft tissue in the region.
