Chest CT showed central bronchial wall thickening, consistent with small airway disease.
Antibiotics were broadened to meropenem but again cultures were negative.
Also received a course of acyclovir and pentaminidine nebulizer as HSV and PCP prophylaxis, respectively.
He did have positive beta-glucan and galactomannan labs but these were difficult to interpret as pt was on zosyn at the time, which can make these labs falsely positive.
CXR was concernign for aspiration, and the patient's antibiotic coverage was broadened to include meorpenem.
Repletion with D5 1/2 NS with 20 mEq KCl and 20 mEq HCO3- was begun at 100 cc/hour to make up for his diarrheal losses.
Given presentation with large-volume liquid stools and cultures negative for shigella, campylobacter, yersinia, and c diff toxin, he was started on stress-dose solumedrol 60mg [**Hospital1 **], made NPO and TPN was initiated for bowel rest.
CT scan of the abdomen showed submucosal fat-deposition and/or edema involving a long segment of mid-to-distal small bowel and ascending colon, consistent with graft-versus-host disease.
He was on allupurinol, hydroxyurea and ursodiol during his first ICU stay but these were held per [**Hospital Unit Name 3242**] recommendations upon his second ICU admission.
Urine lytes suggested a pre-renal state [**3-13**] profuse diarrhea.
A urine sediment also showed crystals on the urine which were concerning given that the patient was on acyclovir for HSV prophylaxis.
His creatinine gradually rose to 3.8, with no improvement despite fluid resuscitation and TPN.
Early during admission, given his thrombocytopenia, he had a head CT to evaluation for intracranial bleed but this was not seen.
The patient's rate was mostly sinus tachycardia, but would intermittently convert to atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.
And given recent history of cdiff and copious diarrhea, PO vancomycin and IV flagyl started as empiric therapy for severe C diff and continued after stool cultures negative x3.
Acyclovir had to be stopped in the setting of ARF with urine showing crystals.
ANCs steadily rose throughout his first ICU stay; during the second ICU admission labs showed an elevated white count without neutropenia.
Patient had a transfusion threshold of >10.
Red cell transfusion threshold 25.
