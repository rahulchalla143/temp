His blood pressure began to drop at this point with a systolic of 70.
During intubation the patients pulse was lost and his BP dropped to less than 50.
CPR was initiated and a code was called.
In the ensuing hours the patient regained vital signs on and off requiring CPR, multiple pressors to maintain his blood pressure, and even a few shocks from the defibrillator.
An echo was done during this time which showed hardly any ventricular filling on either side of the heart.
His Hct also appeared to be dropping.
At that point he had a blood pressure and pulse and was not requiring CPR.
