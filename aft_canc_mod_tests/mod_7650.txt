9-mm left adrenal nodule, not fully evaluated on this examination due to its small size and partial volume averaging effect, but could represent an adenoma.

CT TORSO [**2168-3-10**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2168-3-12**]: FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate some linear atelectasis on the frontal view not visualized on the lateral, blunting of the CP angles that could be due to a small amount of pleural thickening or small effusion.
Bone scan [**2168-3-18**]: Single focus of tracer uptake in the thoracic spine corresponding to T7 mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion seen on recent CT likely represents osseous metastasis.

She underwent CT guided biopsy of the omentum on [**2168-3-11**].
Biopsy was without evidence of lymphoma or metastases.
CXR was negative for pneumonia.
Blood and bile culture from [**3-12**] isolated vanco sensitive Enterococcus faecium.
On [**3-13**], cholangiogram was done noting complete occlusion of the proximal CBD adjacent to the confluence of the right and left biliary ducts.
She spiked a temperature to 101 post procedure.
Repeat blood cultures were negative.
Urine culture isolated <10,000 colonies of yeast.
Urine culture from [**3-13**] isolated highly resistant E.coli sensitive to [**Last Name (un) 2830**], gent and cefepime.
On [**3-15**], cholangiogram was performed and an internal-external drain was placed into the left biliary system.
On [**3-15**], a bone scan was performed to assess for metastases.
A single focus of tracer uptake in the thoracic spine was noted corresponding to T7 mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion seen on CT was concerning for osseous metastasis.
MRI to T spine demonstrated Focal T1 hypo intense non enhancing lesion involving the T7 vertebral body with adjacent area of intrinsic T1 hyperintensity likely representing a bone island with adjacent hemangioma.
Neuro-intervention felt this was not consistent with a met and a biopsy was deferred.
On [**3-22**], a cholangiogram was done to obtain brushings as attempt to biopsy under repeat liver US did not demonstrate any liver mass adjacent to the stone-filled gallbladder or elsewhere in the liver.
Biliary brushings from cholangiogram  demonstrated atypical glandular/ductal epithelial cells.
A liver duplex US was done to evaluate CT finding from [**3-21**] of new thrombosis of the right portal vein.
INR was 1.3 on [**3-25**].
CXR confirmed right PICC catheter tip projects over cavoatrial junction.
Duration will depend on surgical/oncologic plan, which has not yet been determined.
Of note, surveillance blood cultures prior to [**3-21**] and [**3-22**] were finalized as negative.
Blood cultures from [**3-21**] and [**3-22**] were negative to date at time of discharge.
Weight was 71.9 on [**3-25**].
Admission weight was 71.5kg.
Weekly labs will be required and [**3-11**] time per week INR checks as she is currently on Lovenox and Coumadin.
