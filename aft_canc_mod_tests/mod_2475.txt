The patient had a repeat chest CT in [**2150-12-8**] to reassess his lung disease.
Social History: no EtOH, tobacco, drugs    Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: BP 100/60, pulsus of 20, hr 110, sats 93% on 3l, 98 GENERAL: pleasant, well-appearing man in no acute distress.
ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended with normal bowel sounds and without hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.
Pertinent Results: CT [**2152-4-2**]: 1.
Prominent cardiac silhouette, more so than on [**2151-7-23**], though similar to [**2152-3-29**].
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
[**2152-4-5**] Chest CT: 1.
[**2152-4-22**] CT Chest: 1.
[**2152-4-25**] Echo: EF >55%, Preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-4-14**], no pericardial effusion is identified on the current study.
Upon admission, a CXR showed worsening infiltrates most concerning for a superimposed bacterial infection.
A bronchoscopy was performed which showed persistent influenza A despite 2 weeks of Tamiflu therapy.
A CTA showed no evidence of PE but a multifocal pneumonia with progression of multifocal consolidations involving both lower lobes, right middle lobe, lingula and to a lesser extent, the right upper lobe.
Additionally, the patient's immunosuppression was increased while in the MICU for question of BOOP but the appearance of his CT seemed more consistent with multifocal pneumonia and not BOOP so his steroids were tapered back to his home dose.
His oxygen saturation slowly improved and he was transferred back to the BMT floor.
The bronchoscopy showed that the influenza DFA from the bronch was still positive for Influenza A.
A repeat influenza DFA was sent and was negative for influenza.
The final viral culture is NGTD and will be monitored for 30 days for evidence of growth of influenza.
#Pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology: On admission, the patient was found to have a moderate pericardial effusion on CT scan.
A pulsus was found to be elevated and an echo showed evidence of early tamponade physiology.
Serial repeat echos showed no evidence of recurrent effusion or tamponade physiology.
He was given IV diltiazem which slowed his rate, and then restarted on PO Dilt.
Cardiology saw the patient and recommended switching the patient to a long acting Diltiazem which the patient tolerated well.
The patient's platelets were > 200 upon admission and trended down slowly during this admission.
He will be seen 2 days after discharge for a count check.
During his MICU course, his steroids were increased slightly for concern of BOOP but this was tapered back to his home dose after no improvement was seen and his pulmonary process appeared to be consistent with consolidative pneumonia, not BOOP.
#Hypertension: The patient had difficult to control blood pressures during this admission.
His blood pressures had to be taken in the lower extremity because of RUE DVT and left arm PICC line.
His ankle blood pressures seemed to correlate fairly well with his upper extremity pressures.
His SBPs ranged from 150-190s and his Metoprolol was titrated up for goal SBP 140s.
#CRI: stable, monitor .
