On the floor, the patient was initially comfortable, but developed a repeat of his chest discomfort corresponding to a rate at 130.

EKG: Multiple EKGs include: NSR at 74, atrial flutter at 121, and sinus arrythmia with PVCs  Brief Hospital Course: 1) Atrial Flutter with rapid rate: The patient's rate was initially tachycardic with a rate in the 130s associated with continued discomfort that did not initially respond to 10mg of Metoprolol IV.
His tachycardia improved after a therapeutic paracentesis was performed, but returned shortly thereafter.
2) Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain improved slightly with therapeutic paracentesis but eventually required high doses of dilaudid for pain control.
Improved with heart rate control with metoprolol and transition to morphine PCA.
4) HCV Cirrhosis/HCC complicated by ascites, PVT(and smv thrombosis) with hyperbilirubinemia:  Initially therapeutic paracentesis was performed, with ascites negative for SBP.
