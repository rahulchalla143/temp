Initially in the ED, she was febrile to 102.3 and was tachycardic to 128, with BP 106/52.
CXR showed b/l pleural effusions, but no definite infiltrate.
UA was negative for infection.
Stool was sent for C. diff.
BP continued to remain tenuous with SBP in 80s, tachy up to 140s, despite 3 L NS at that point.
Neo was weaned off around 1pm, with BPs high 90s-100s/50s, HR 80s, satting 100 % on 3L.
They recommended CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which showed pleural effusions but no consolidation and no abdominal process.
Echocardiogram was performed which ruled out pericardial effusion.
Of note, she has had several recent evaluations for fevers: - [**2195-12-10**]: T 101.7, eval at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**], BCx and UCx negative, sent home without abx.
- [**2195-12-18**]: chest tightness, CXR with b/l pl effusions, treated with cipro 500mg [**Hospital1 **] given baseline ureteral obstruction and concern for predisposition to UTI - [**2195-12-19**]: ongoing fevers, admitted for febrile neutropenia.
In [**2191**], she had excisional biopsy of a rapidly enlarging submental mass that showed small lymphocytic lymphoma without evidence of transformation.
Biopsies were obtained showing "palisading granulomatous dermatitis" c/w "granuloma annulare or annular elastocytic granuloma."
Torso CT scan [**2195-11-26**] showed extensive thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic lymphadenopathy consistent with progression of her known lymphoma; left ureteral obstruction by a retroperitoneal lymphomatous mass with hydronephrosis of the left kidney; massive retroperitoneal adenopathy encasing the aorta and part of the IVC; and multiple pulmonary nodules, the majority of which were unchanged from the prior study of 10/00, with at least two new pulmonary nodules up to 7 mm in diameter.

ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2196-1-25**]):    NO GROWTH.
COMPARISON: Multiple CT chest and torsos, most recent dating [**2196-1-1**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired images were obtained through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after the uneventful administration of 130 cc of IV Optiray contrast.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is extensive axillary, mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy, unchanged since [**2196-1-1**].
The aorta and IVC are still partially encased by the mass, similar to [**2195-11-26**].
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are large bilateral inguinal and pelvic lymph nodes measuring up to 2.4 cm in short axis, the largest inguinal lymph node measuring 1.9 cm in short axis on the left.
She was pan-cultured and a c. diff was obtained as the patient had reported loose stools prior to admission.
The patient had no evidence of colitis on CT scan and no PNA on CXR.
Prior to her transfer to the floor the patient had a left thoracentesis with removal of 1300cc of fluid (culture negative).
She was ambulating at the time of discharge on RA with saturations of 98%.
CLL: the patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] next week for further evaluation and continued treatment.
