Upon arrival in the ED, patient was found to be short of breath, with an 02 sat of 50-60% on room air.
A CXR was done, which showed a significantly larger pleural effusion.

A CT scan on [**12-25**] showed extensive disease (though slightly diminished from prior) with large right-sided tumor and metastatic spread to liver.
Pertinent Results: CXR [**1-13**] Portable: Increased now large right effusion.
Right upper lobe mass,increased in size from [**2141-7-19**], but likely similar to CT [**2141-12-25**] .
NCHCT [**1-13**]: 1.
CTA chest [**1-13**]: 1.
Multiple foci of air within the right pleural cavity admixed with associated pleural effusion, mildly increased since the prior study which may be due to necrosis but raises the possibility of a bronchopleural fistula.
CT Head [**1-16**] 1.
Other possibilities include infection, cardiac cause, or pulmonary embolus (though ruled out with CTA).
The patient continued to have an oxygen requirement following admission, and underwent an IR-guided thoracentesis after CT chest showed a loculated right-sided pleural effusion.
IP performed rigid bronchoscopy on [**1-17**] which was consistent with postobstructive pneumonia.
Patient underwent repeat bronchoscopy on [**1-18**] with additional removal of purulent material.
The patient received IVF initially during her hospital course, and calcium was monitored.
The plan is for further evaluation of her cytology, with the possibility of further systemic treatment.
