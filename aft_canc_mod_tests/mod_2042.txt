About one month prior to her admission, the patient was noted to have fevers, chills, night sweats, fatigue and weight loss, with a workup which showed leukocytosis of 25,000, with 58% blasts and flow cytometry consistent with AML M4.
At the outside hospital, the patient was noted to have blurry vision in her right eye, and was found to have fixed and dilated right pupil and changing mental status, and an MRI of the brain showed a 2 cm hemorrhage in the mid-brain and frontal lobe, and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**].
Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status despite stable CT scans 4.
Lesions in her spleen seen on MRI of the abdomen and CT of the abdomen 6.
Difficult to control electrolytes  On hospital day five, the patient was transferred to the Bone Marrow Transplant team.
At this point, she had had her platelet counts increasing to 274, and had a stable head CT and improving mental status.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to Bone Marrow Transplant service, temperature 98.2, pulse 76, respirations 18, blood pressure 154/90.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Bilateral ptosis, right pupil fixed, 3 to 4 mm, left pupil minimally reactive.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
DATA:  White count 0.9, hemoglobin 10.9, hematocrit 31.1, platelets 274.
PT 13.6, PTT 30.3, INR 1.3.
Granulocytes count 190.
Potassium 4, magnesium 1.9.
Her hematocrit also came up and was stable in the high 30s and 39 on the day of discharge.
Her coagulation studies were stable.
In terms of her AML, she did have a bone marrow biopsy on [**11-25**], and this reportedly has shown her to be in remission.
Her follow-up CT scan done while on the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit after the patient slipped while getting out of bed did show an improvement in the blood collection in her brain.
This occurred in the setting of her having some mild urinary incontinence and a post-void residual of 2300 cc and bilateral hydronephrosis on abdominal CT.  A Foley was placed in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, and this remained in until the patient self-discontinued the Foley.
Initially, the neurogenic bladder was thought secondary to most likely her CNS lesions, although on MRI of the spine, she did show a C5 through C7 T2 hyperintensity in a poor quality study.
These were initially seen on CT and ultrasound of [**11-20**], and were further evaluated in MRI of the abdomen.
They also recommended a CT of the chest to rule out any source of aspergillosis.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Her potassium and magnesium were difficult to replete, most likely secondary to her AmBisome therapy.
She was placed on a potassium and magnesium sliding scale and her levels were kept in the normal range after this.
She did pass a speech and swallow study on admission to the Intensive Care Unit, and had no trouble eating during her stay with us.
She did have an echocardiogram after this event.
This showed normal atrium, left ventricle was borderline dilated, overall left ventricular systolic function was greater than 55%.
This study was done on [**11-22**].
Neurogenic bladder, resolved at time of discharge 6.
