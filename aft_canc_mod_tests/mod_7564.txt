On repeat exam- L VF remains intact, but abnormal on R. III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements appear restricted with laterally on both eyes- ?
Extensive vasogenic edema involving the left parietal and temporal lobe with significant mass effect, midline shift of about 15 mm and subfalcine herniation.
CT Torso [**2188-4-16**] 1.
No evidence of occlusion, stenosis, or an aneurysm noted on the CTA examination in the arteries of anterior or posterior circulation.
[**2188-4-21**] fMRI Successful functional MRI of the brain demonstrates the expected activation motor areas.
[**2188-4-26**] CT head Expected postoperative changes status post craniotomy for left parietotemporal lesion.
[**4-29**] Chest Xray: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung parenchyma has increased transparency.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the neurosurgery service for further workup of his L parietal mass.
A CT torso revealed a large lung mass and an adrenal mass.
An MRI head showed a single mass with extensive edema that is not proportionate to the size of the lesion.
A lung biopsy was scheduled and performed on [**4-18**].
His lung biopsy results showed Poorly differentiated carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma.
A functional MRI and CTA was performed on [**4-21**] for surgical planning.
CT showed minimal hemorrhage.
MRI was done on [**4-27**], This showed residual tumor.
Head CT showed post surgical changes with minimal pneumocephalus.
A repeat MRI postop on [**4-29**] demonstrated decreased tumor burden.
?You will not need an MRI of the brain.
