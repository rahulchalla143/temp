LINE PLACEMENT  [**2159-12-10**] 5:23 PM  CHEST PORT.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2158-11-25**] and [**2159-10-17**]:  Chronic interstitial pulmonary disease accounts for the bulk of pulmonary abnormalities, but there is slight increase in opacification in the left lower lobe, which could represent pneumonia or aspiration and an increase in the background density of the lungs, which may be a function of differing radiologic technique or mild pulmonary edema.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-10**], the patient has taken a much poorer inspiration.
On POD1, the pt was transferred to the floor, where he remained hemodynamically stable with good urine output from the ileostomy, which appeared well vascularized and pink in color.
By POD1, the pt was weaned to room air while maintaining a saturation of 96%.
His INR rose from 1.4 to 1.7 on POD2 then down to 1.4 again on POD5.
After the INR dropped sufficiently, the epidural was pulled without complication, and the pt was discharged home on POD5.
