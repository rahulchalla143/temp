In the cath lab Right heart cath was performed with the following pressures: RA 26 ; RV 63/25 ; PCWP 46 ; PA 66/44/54 with hemodynamic measurements revealing a CO of 4.26 and CI 1.96 on pressors.
The patient had an emergent echo that revealed EF 25%, 3+ MR, [**12-17**]+ TR, with apical hypokinesis/akinesis.
Left heart Cath revealed the following on arteriography: (225 dye) Left Main: 70% at origin, 90% distal LAD: 90% at origin, Mid 100%, Left Cx: 80% at origin, long 95% mid RCA: 70% mid lesion, PDA 90% , posterolateral 70% .
Repeat Right cath pressures after intervention revealed CO of 6.21 with CI of 2.91 on Pump and 10 Dopamine.
Of note, the patient had 800cc urine output at the end of the case without diuresis   Past Medical History: Hypercholesterolemia Hypertension Acid reflux disease Peptic ulcer disease Hypothyroidism Diverticulosis   Social History: (per OMR) Pt lives alone.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Vitals: T-96.5 BP: 105/54, HR - 94, CVP - 12 PA: 53/27/38 .

Hemodynamics: HR 130, sinus w/ LBBB CO/CI (fick) 4.3/1.96 SVR 1136 PVR 149 .
Initial resting hemodynamics revealed severe cardiogenic shock with elevation of right and left sided pressures (RA mean 26 and PCWP mean 46mmHG).
The cardiac index was low at 1.96 despite pressors.
Initial PH was 7.09 with metabolic and respiratory acidosis.
Initial blood pressure was 100/80.
Intra aortic was placed with improvement of augmented pressures to 121/53 and cardiac index to 2.91.
Echo was performed during the case showing EF about 25% with  moderately severe mitral regurgitation and akinesis in LAD territory.
ECHO [**2193-2-8**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
CXR [**2193-2-8**]: 1.
CXR [**2193-2-9**]: The endotracheal tube is at the level of the aortic knob and unchanged.
Left-sided nasogastric tube, which is below the gastroesophageal junction.
CXR [**2193-2-10**]: The Swan-Ganz catheter entering from a femoral approach has been pulled back and the tip is now in the RA.
Successful placement of an IABP, and successful PCI of the LMCA into the LAD were performed.
Cardiac enzymes were elevated with CK peak 1215, MB 124, Trop 4.68, but EKG was unchanged.
(2) Pump: ECHO revealed EF 25% with 3+MR.
Because of signs of sepsis, the IABP and PA catheter were removed, and an IJ line was used for CVP monitoring, which was kept around 12.
Resp Failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for resp failure, presumed [**1-17**] to CHF and 3+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] maintained good oxygenation and ventilation, patient had a difficult time being weaned from the vent.
Heme: Hct decreased from baseline of 30 to 28 -> 24 -> 28, and received several units RBC to maintain Hct >28.
Platelets were stable at around 100.
Patient was HIT negative, DIC and hemolysis labs were negative.
ARF: Baseline Cr for patient was 1.1, and Cr was up to 1.4.
Etiology was likely multifactorial, due to prerenal state, ATN and contrast nephropathy contributing.
Sputum culture was negative, but showed 3+ GPC.
# Death: On [**2193-2-14**] at 8 PM, the patient's HCP, son [**Name (NI) 892**] [**Name (NI) 24222**], and his sister, wished to make the patient [**Name (NI) 3225**] and withdraw care.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who spoke with the family regarding withdrawal of care.
The HCP agreed to withdraw care, morphine gtt was started, and patient passed in comfort surrounded by family.
