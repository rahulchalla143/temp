The histology and the chest CT finding of multiple pulmonary nodules are consistent with a lung primary, although metastases to lung and brain from another primary cannot be excluded.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **], where CT head showed cerebellar mass, and he was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-19**] for further workup.
At [**Hospital1 18**], he had CT body performed, which showed multiple lesions in the lungs, liver, kidney, bone (though the lesions in the liver, kidney, bone cannot definitely be attributed to cancer).
Mass pathology showed metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma with prominent neuroendocrine features, most likely from a lung primary.
On [**9-1**], he deveoped fever to 102.4, tachycardic to 130s, hypoxemic to 91% sat on 70% shovel mask, SBP 120/60, and lethargy and confusion per his daughters.
On discharge, the pt was in good condition for transfer to rehab, and had O2 sat of 96% on 2L.
Hct was stable on this admission, no transfusion was necessary.
