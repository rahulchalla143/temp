Correlation with CT exam from the outside hospital, which by report was performed at the OSH.
[**2131-3-15**] CXR FINDINGS: Multifocal pneumonia including dense right lower lobe consolidation with abscess has not really changed much since [**2131-3-13**].
Tracheostomy tube is in standard position  [**2131-3-12**] CT chest IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2131-2-26**] Cardiac echo The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
His gram stains showed GNRs, GPRs and budding yeast.
CT chest concerning for necrotizing pneumonia on right in setting of suspected persistent esophageal leak, possible fistula.
EGD revealed a defect along the right wall of the esophagus at approximately 35cm.
BAL gram stain showing 2+ GPR, 2+ GNR; culture pending.
VL<20, CD4>400, OSH blood:GPRs, GPCs, cultures pending.
Re-consider on [**2-27**].
OSH blood cultures reported as: 1 bottle NGTD and 1 bottle w/ diptheria and coag negative staph, suspicious for contaminants.
EKG w/ QTc 412.
Esophagram study with no extrav of contrast.
Tolerated CPAP overnight from 4pm - 2am, then tachy.
-[**3-1**]: Given Hct of 24 and MAPs < 65 requiring levophed 0.08, transfused 1uPRBC.
-[**3-2**]: Fever to 102.4; blood cultures sent.
CDiff toxin x2 negative; 3rd pending.
-[**3-3**]: bronched, BAL sent; placed on CMV afterwards due to resp distress w/ goal to wean back to CPAP in am, propofol added for intermittent hypertension/tachycardia -[**3-4**]: ID consulted and agreed with current antibiotics/antifungal although they believe that definitive treatment is right pneumonectomy but patient is not a good candidate surgically; Thoracic surgery decided to do bedside trach on [**3-5**]; consents obtained; throughout the day patient would intermittently become agitated/tachypneic resulting in mild desaturation so fentanyl gtt was added to his sedation regimen -[**3-5**]: Bedside bronch and trach, CT chest, TFs resumed, HLIV, weaned levophed; febrile 102.1 - cx sent; -[**3-6**]: R PICC placed; to IR [**3-7**] for drainage of right lung abscess; spiked fever overnight, no new cultures drawn -[**3-7**]: IP did not find a safe spot for US guided drainage- would need CT guided drainage, fever to 101.7, not cultured -[**3-8**]: went to CT-guided drainage although very little was drained ~20ml, sent for cultures; patient tolerated procedure well; per ID consult: sent for B-glucan and Aspergillus Galactomannan Antigen -[**3-9**]: d/c'd fent/prop gtt; started oxycodone, ativan, morphine breakthrough; C. diff sent, loperamide d/c'd - [**3-10**]: weaned peep to 10; - [**3-11**]: afebrile, spent the entire day on trach collar - stable, ambulated with PT/OT, sat in chair - [**3-12**]: afebrile, PT/OT OOB to chair, ID rec'd CT chest and Bld cx x 3, continue current abtx and drainage per thoracic.
CT chest showed abscess relatively unchanged since [**3-5**] - [**3-14**]: Stayed on trach collar.
- [**3-15**]: c/o trouble breathing/swallowing in the afternoon, CXR unchanged, thoracic performed bronchoscopy, thick mucus cleaned out, but otherwise clear airways, able to clear secretions well.
A speech and swallow study was done on [**2131-3-20**] for placement of a PMV (as he had a cuffless trach tube in place).
He eventually spiked to 102 and his WBC was 28K.
Cipro was added to his antibiotic therapy and a chest xray showed some increased opacities in the RUL and LLL.
Please see the page 1 referral for lab tests which need to be done weekly and reported to the [**Hospital **] Clinic.
The Nutrition service currently recommends changeing his tube feedings to 2 cal HN at 40/hr now that his potassium is in the 4.0 range.
His renal function repains stable with a BUN/creat of 15/0.9.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 10 mL IV PRN line flush PICC, non-heparin dependent: Flush with 10 mL Normal Saline daily and PRN per lumen.
