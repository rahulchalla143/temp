CTA Chest ([**8-14**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Sub-5-mm non-calcified lung nodules, not seen on prior study dated [**7-3**], [**2115**], likely infectious in nature.
However, in view of patient's history of lymphoma, a repeat study after appropriate treatment is recommended to document resolution.
CT Mandible/Sinus ([**8-18**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
In the ICU, he was found to have multilobar consolidations (and absent PE) on CXR and CT, and empiric treamtent for pneumonia was begun with vancomycin and meropenem.
With this evidence and blood cultures positive for Klebsiella, his right subclavian Hickman was removed on [**8-16**].
CT scan on [**2115-5-8**] continued to show response to his transplant.
There is a long-term plan to repeat CT scans of the torso and sinus CT on [**2115-8-28**] after he completes his antibiotics for his pneumonia.
While his prednisone is tapered we will need to keep a closer eye on his blood sugars.
