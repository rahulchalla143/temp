He was briefly intubated in the MICU but was able to wean off ventilation and maintained his oxygen saturations on room air for several days before discharge.
He was fluid resuscitated and his blood pressure returned to [**Location 213**].
He had diabetic teaching and voiced good understanding of how to do insulin and check blood sugars at home.
Troponins were positive at 0.4 and he underwent an exercise stress test with imaging (MIBI) which showed normal ejection fraction and cardiac perfusion.
His saturation had been maintained at 100% on room air for several days before discharge.
His sputum grew methicillin-resistant staph aureus.
The urine electrolytes were consistent with pre-renal dehydration, and he was given IV resuscitation with good response.
Creatinine improved initially to from 4.5 to 1.5 but then increased again to 2.2 after his vancomycin trough was elevated at 38.
He had an EGD in house which showed gastritis and esophagitis.
- Please recheck his creatinine on [**2132-2-25**], fax results to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6808**].
- Please set him up with outpatient GI follow-up to have a repeat EGD and ensure that his symptoms are resolved.

Outpatient Lab Work Please check serum creatinine on [**2133-2-20**].
The gastroenterologists did an endoscopy and found some inflammation in your esophagus and stomach.
We did a stress test that showed that your heart function is normal.
