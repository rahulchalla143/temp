Her NGT output gradually decreased and her bowel function slowly returned; the NGT was clamped on post-operative days #14-15, with a low residual output, and was removed on post-operative day #16.
On admission to the ICU she had a white blood cell count of 2,000 and tachycardia, meeting criteria for SIRS.
She was also given 2 units of FFP to reverse coagulopathy and transfused with PRBC due to intra-operative blood loss and a hematocrit that drifted down in the post-operative period.
All cultures (urine, blood) negative, and chest imaging was negative for pneumonia.
Stool was sent for C. difficile, which was negative, and her symptoms were overall stable on discharge with 3-4 loose stools per day.
*) Cardiovascular She was initially tachycardic up to the 120's after surgery, which was attributed to her fevers and general state of inflammation post-operatively.
Her heart rate gradually normalized to the 80-90's.
On post-operative day #22, as this persisted, an ECG and CTA chest were performed.
The ECG was unremarkable and unchanged from prior, and CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism.
Her oxygen saturation was good, and her heart rate was stable at 90-low 100's on discharge.
The oxygen was weaned off and she afterwards maintained excellent oxygen saturation on room air.
On CTA chest performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, 2mm tiny pulmonary nodules consistent with prior granulomatous disease were noted incidentally.
Thyroid function tests were checked at the suggestion of Neurology, who felt that thyroid function could be affecting her seizure activity.
TSH was initially elevated, with normal free T4.
Labs were re-checked 1 week later and her TSH had normalized, with normal free T4 and T3, so her usual dose of levothyroxine was maintained and transitioned back to oral dosing when she was able to tolerate oral intake.
Her vital signs were normal, and a CT of the head was negative for acute injury.
