Patient reported that he felt weak, and had a "heavy load on his shoulders."
In the Emergency Room, his vital signs were found to be blood pressure of 111/55, pulse of 59.
His blood pressures dropped to the 100s and he was given 1 liter of normal saline with good blood pressure response.
A nasogastric lavage returned evidence of blood and MICU evaluation was consulted, and the patient was admitted to the MICU.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of [**8-31**] with 30-40%.
CRF:  Creatinine 1.7-1.8.
Alprazolam 0.5 q6 prn.
Magnesium oxide 400 q day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature is 98.5, blood pressure 111/55, pulse is 59, respiratory rate 13, and sating 95% on room air.
Jugular venous pressure at 10 cm.
Rectal examination was guaiac positive per the Emergency Room.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit of 18.6, white count 8.4, platelets 20.
Also on admission the patient had a CT scan of his chest and abdomen.
The patient's anemia was stable at the time of discharge.
His discharge hematocrit was 33.7.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed on the patient which revealed myelodysplastic syndrome.
On discharge, the platelet count was 165.
The patient was found to have MDS on bone marrow biopsy with a question of MDS and ITP.
Once the patient's hematocrit and platelet counts were stable, he underwent an endoscopy to evaluate his upper GI bleed.
Colonoscopy was considered while in-house, however, it was deemed that the sight of GI bleeding in the stomach and duodenum was sufficient to account for the patient's blood loss.
Patient's hematocrit was again stable for 48 hours prior to discharge.
An electrocardiogram obtained at that time revealed ST segment depressions to 3 mm which has increased over the baseline of 1 mm for this patient.
Serial enzymes were also checked at that time, and the patient ruled in for myocardial infarction.
The patient was transfused to maintain a hematocrit greater than 30 to prevent further episodes.
Congestive heart failure:  Patient with a history of congestive heart failure and mild volume overload on examination on admission.
The patient remained with good oxygen saturations while in-house, and on examination the patient's lungs remained clear.
A chest x-ray was obtained two days prior to discharge, which showed no evidence of congestive heart failure.
Starting the prednisone 80 mg q day, the patient had significant increase in his daily fingersticks with blood sugars in the 250s.
The patient's oral hypoglycemics were once again restarted, and the patient was still covered with a regular insulin-sliding scale.
Hyperparathyroidism:  The patient was appropriately replaced for his decreased thyroid function and Synthroid was continued.
Chronic renal insufficiency:  Patient's creatinine was slightly increased on admission with a creatinine of 2.0 throughout his admission.
With the administration of packed red blood cells for the hypovolemia, his creatinine had returned to baseline.
Examination was followed throughout the hospital course.
Patient with stable hematocrit and platelet count over 48 hours prior to discharge.
There were outpatient laboratories given to the patient so this could be done with home VNA.
