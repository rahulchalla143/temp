Normal IVC diameter (<=2.1cm) with >50% decrease with sniff (estimated RA pressure (0-5 mmHg).
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
To futher characterize the possible tricuspid valve vegetation a transesophageal echocardiogram may be considered.

Following irrigation and debridement of the area, skin flaps were elevated using [**Last Name (un) 4161**] electrocautery over this area of 20 cm2 and Penrose drain was also placed.
Sponge and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.
Empiric antiobiotic therapy with vancomycin was started, but when wound cultures grew pansensitive acinetobacter patient was switched Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid per ID.
Reimplantation of PPM was performed on [**7-20**] and wound revision and drainage of former pacer pocket was performed [**7-22**].
Blood Cx from [**7-16**] and [**7-17**] were negative, culture from temporary pacer lead extracted [**7-20**] was negative, and blood cultures from [**7-22**] were pending with no growth at discharge.
INR was therapeutic on admission at 2.6.
Upon discharge her INR remained at 1.3 and decision was made to increase coumadin to 5 mg.
Patient is to follow up INR after discharge and have results faxed to her cardiologist.
TTE on [**7-22**] showed preserved LVEF with mild LVH.
Triscupid Regurgitation: TTE on [**7-22**] showed a small, independently moving echodense structure measuring on the posterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve concerning for possible vegetation vs a torn chordae.
Patient's Na dropped from [**7-15**] to [**7-18**] hitting a nadir of 129 on [**7-16**].
Urine osms were low and was suspected to be due to dehydration.
Blood counts stable during admission.
OUTSTANDING LABS 1.
Blood Cx from [**7-22**] still pending with no growth to date.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES -F/U INR as outpatient.
Outpatient Lab Work Please obtain INR before [**2134-7-28**] and send results to: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 89148**] 8. cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) 50 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Please note the following changes to your medications, and follow up with the appointments we have scheduled for you.
CHANGES TO YOUR MEDICATIONS START Ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily through [**2134-8-12**] START Aspirin 81mg daily START Metoprolol succinate 25mg daily DECREASE Coumadin to 5mg daily due to interaction with antibiotic and we are requesting that you follow up to measure your INR within 3 days of discharge.
