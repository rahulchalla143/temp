CT scan from St. [**Doctor Last Name 15000**] [**2153-8-9**] showed compressed L lower lobe, probably causing a R to L shunt leading to hypoxemia.
Based on CT scan on [**2153-8-6**], subcutaneous emphysema is prominent in anterior and posterior thorax which is likely contributing to hypoxemia and remarkably low P:F ratio.
IP and thoracic teams were contact[**Name (NI) **] and flexible/rigid bronchoscopy was performed on [**2153-8-15**] which revealed minimal wall injury to distal trachea; no fistula found.
On transfer O2 sat was 99-100% on CMV, FiO2 50%, tidal volume 450 mL, PEEP 5, respiratory rate 16.
Further workup for eosinophilia was deferred.
An ultrasound was done on [**8-15**] which showed no venous thrombosis.
Hct remained stable no transfusions were required.
Olanzapine, scheduled, was on active pre-admission medication list, and this was changed to PRN agitation.
Lorazepam was held as well due to sedation, as patient was on fentanyl and midazolam drips during admission.
Information was obtained from  per hospital transfer note.

Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital from St. [**Hospital 15000**] Hospital because your tracheostomy was not functioning well and there were concering findings on the CT scan of the lungs.
Our interventional pulmonary team did a rigid bronchoscopy to look at the airways and determined there were no structural problems in your airways, but that the tracheostomy tube was out of place.
