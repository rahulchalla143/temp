A surveillance CT scan was performed on POD4 which was negative for metastasis but did demonstrated incidentally a thrombosed L ovarian vein as well as occlusion of the left limb of her aortobifem graft.
She was transferred to the ICU and a CTA chest was performed to r/o PE and also LE dopplers were performed to evaluate the patency of her aortobifem graft.
CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but her doppler study demonstrated no flow through either common femoral artery.
Laboratory tests revealed that the patient was HIT- and her cardiac enzymes peaked on POD8/1 with a troponin of 0.20.
Patient was extubated on POD [**8-10**] and was supported with intermittent diuresis and close monitoring.
continued to improve and on POD [**10-12**] her INR was therapeutic and the argatroban gtt was discontinued.
experienced 'heartburn' for which the floor nurse got an EKG that showed similar findings as were noted on previous EKGs done during this admission.
