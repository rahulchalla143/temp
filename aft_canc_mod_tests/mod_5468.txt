TRACING #1    Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 59 0 136 470/468 0 -56 117  CT head on admission: IMPRESSION: 29 x 21 mm hyperattenuated rounded focus in the right posterior fossa.
CT head [**10-16**]: IMPRESSION:  1.
However, followup study is recommended with CTA or contrast CT for further characterization.
CXR [**10-16**] FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2109-3-26**], there is persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural effusions and elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
IMPRESSION: Little overall change  EEG [**10-17**] - Preliminary - mild encephalopathy, no epileptiform discharges.
On admission her neurological examination was significant for a right facial droop and dysarthria, and this progressed to RUE weakness in UMN distribution on morning after day of admission, along with hypophonic speech, motor aphasia but intact comprehension.
Inintial Head CT was consistent with a meningioma (mass arising from dura), which did not match her neurological exam findings.
She was admitted to neurology service and was treated with IVF, her BP medications were held and blood pressure was allowed to autoregulate.
She underwent a repeat head CT which confirmed the findings of a meningioma and also revealed a L posterior IC/thalamus hypodensity, most likely consistent with an  acute stroke.
She underwent EEG to evaluate for encephalopathy which showed mild encephalopathy without epileptiform activity/evidence of NCSE.
EKG was not concerning for ischemia and CXR was consistent w/ CHF, likely an acute on chronic dCHF exacerbation  She was maintained on home dose of lasix and provided with IV boluses.
Urine lytes are shown above, Uosm was 400.
She will require aspriation precautions and a repeat S&S evaluation.
