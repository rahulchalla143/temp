ECG revealed new atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response @ ~140 beats per minute, as well as an incomplete RBBB and inferolateral STD.
Labs were notable for WBC 11.6 w/left shift and no bands, lactate 1.6, troponin <0.01, BNP 608, and negative U/A.
Blood and urine cultures were sent and the patient received vancomycin and cefepime.
CT head was negative.
Preliminary read of CTA/CT abdomen and pelvis showed no pulmonary embolism or acute process in the chest, but possible very early diverticulitis involving the mid-to-distal descending colon, as well as evidence of chronic inflammatory bowel disease involving the right hemi-colon.
Repeat ECG showed sinus rhythm with rSr' in V1 and resolution the ST depressions.
She was able to be weaned down to 2L NC and blood pressure and heart rate remained stable.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were 97.5, 79, 101/59, 14, 93%RA.
Past Medical History: - Stage I invasive lobular breast cancer s/p left lumpectomy [**2166-7-1**] with re-excision [**2166-7-22**]; started cycle 1 of chemotherapy with Taxotere/Cytoxan [**8-13**], received Neulasta [**8-15**] - Asthma - Meralgia paresthetica - Depression - Hypercholesterolemia - H/o alcohol dependence - Umbilical hernia - Colonic adenoma - Bilateral bunions - ?Restless legs syndrome   Social History: Patient quit smoking cigarettes [**2141-12-17**].
Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL General: Alert, oriented, appears uncomfortable HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry MM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi Abdomen: soft, endorses tenderness in bilateral lower quadrants & epigastrum -- not particularly exacerbated by palpation, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly, no rebound or guarding GU: foley Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, bunions bilaterally Neuro: CNII-XII intact, no focal abnormalities  Pertinent Results: [**8-16**] CT CHEST ABDOMEN: TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were acquired through the chest without administration of intravenous contrast material.
Rapid axial images were then acquired through the abdomen and pelvis in the portal venous phase.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CT HEAD [**8-16**] FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute large vascular territorial infarction.
Mild prominence of the ventricles and sulci is consistent with age-related involutional change.There is focal hypodensity in the corona radiata bilaterally( left > right) which could represent small vessel ischemic disease but consider MRI for further evaluation .
There is focal hypodensity in the corona radiata bilaterally , left greater than right which could represent small vessel ischemic disease but consider MRI for further evaluation .

Troponins were cycled, which were negative.
To work up her atrial fibrillation, she was ruled out, TSH was checked (normal), and echocardiogram performed.
The Echocardiogram revealed nl EF (55-60%) with mod [**Last Name (un) **] and mild LAE, no LV motion abnormality.
# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with a leukocytosis with left-shift; read of CT abdomen, in conjunction with crampy abdominal pain, was suggestive of possible acute on chronic colitis.
However, given evidence of new onset abdominal pain with white count, inflammatory findings on CT scan, patient was covered empirically for GI flora with cipro/flagyl.
Head CT on admission revealed no evidence of bleed.
After hydration, your rhythm normalized and your pressure returned to [**Location 213**].
A surface echocardiogram was performed and showed a normal ejection fraction (pumping function) for the heart.
Also, abdominal CT revealed mild colitis/diverticulitis on the left side.
Head CT showed no evidence of bleed.
