Imaging was obtained by PCP recently showing multiple bony lesions.
He was given 10mg PO vitamin K. CXR showed large left sided pleural effusion suspicious for lung mass.
Bedside cardiac echo shows no pericardial effusion but large left pleural effusion.
Given a 500cc bolus for SBP 79.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2122-12-29**]):       1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):  Urine ([**12-29**]): NGTD  Preliminary cytology:  Pleural fluid adenocarcinoma cells, pending more detailed analysis.
STUDIES: ECG ([**2122-12-28**]): Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
CXR ([**12-28**]): Large left pleural effusion with left upper lobe collapse and left central adenopathy.
ECHO ([**12-29**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
CT Abd/Pelvis ([**12-29**]): 1.
CXR ([**12-29**]): In comparison with the study of [**11-27**], the degree of opacification in the left hemithorax has increased.
CXR ([**12-29**]): Right basal atelectasis has nearly cleared and small right pleural effusion is stable.
Because of rightward patient rotation, it is hard to say whether there has been interval rightward mediastinal shift, but I believe there has been, suggesting an increase in the volume of the already large left pleural effusion that nearly completely collapses the left lung, and obscures extensive intrathoracic malignancy as seen on the torso CT earlier today.
CXR ([**12-30**]): A modest decrease in the large left pleural effusion is reflected in a slight increase in the small region of apical lung aeration and return of the trachea to the midline.
CXR ([**12-31**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
MRI Head w/ and w/out contrast([**12-31**]) IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Chest w/ contrast ([**1-3**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**1-6**] Upright portable view of the chest demonstrates left lower lobe consolidation.
SBP in the 120s.
