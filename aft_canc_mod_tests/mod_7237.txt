# GI Bleeding: EGD performed on [**8-29**] showed old blood in stomach with fresh blood in duodenum but no source of bleeding.
Serial Hcts were checked, showing a slow GIB.
Hct was maintained at >28 for cardiac ischemia.
His baseline hematocrit was 30, attributed to CML and gleevec therapy.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease, with normal B12 and folate.
INR was unremarkable at 1.3, likely from nutrition.
For cardiac ischemia, goal Hct would be >28.
# Elevated INR: INR on admission was 4.9, was brought down to <1.5 for EGD.
Repeat ECHO showed unchanged LV function but worsening mitral regurgitation.
He was euvolemic on exam throughout admission.
