Compared to the previous tracing of [**2106-10-13**] the findings are similar.
The left lower lobe opacity is slightly more extensive than on the previous examination and is today accompanied by a small left pleural effusion.
Microbiology studies were as above; sputum grew pseudomonas and aspergillus.
IP was consulted for possible u/s guided thoracentesis of left pleural effusion but were unable to locate a big enough pocket of fluid.
Blood pressures were initially stable but the patient eventually developed likely septic shock, and became vasopressor dependent.
His hypogammaglobulinemia was demonstrated with low IgG, IgM, and IgA levels.
On [**1-22**], after further discussions with the family, the decision was made to transition the patient's care to comfort measures only.
