On POD 4 he was transfused 2 more units of PRBC's for continued low Hct, to which he responded appropiately.
Cr from the JP drain was checked and found to be 1.2.
BP was in the high 80s to 90s systolic, with 4L of O2.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilat, no carotid bruits were heard, no new heart murmurs.
DP pulses were 2+ bilat.
Patient was put on oxygen, IV fluids were restarted, and EKG was ordered, labs were sent.
EKGs showed ST depressions in the lateral leads and ST elevation in Avf that resolved after 30 min.
The patient wsa noted to be hypotensive to 90s (baseline 140s-150s), tachycardic (high 90s/low 100s) and hypoxic 90-95% on 4 L (previously no O2 requirement).
He had bil LE US that as per team report was negative w/ the plan for VQ scan today given that he has hx of CKD w/ elevated creatine and recent dye load from cath lab.
Repeated EKG showed sinus with occ PAC in the 80s.
On POD 4 he was transfused 2 more units of PRBC's for continued low Hct, to which he responded appropiately.
Cr from the JP drain was checked and found to be 1.2.
BP was in the high 80s to 90s systolic.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilat, no carotid bruits were heard, no new heart murmurs.
DP pulses were 2+ bilat.
Patient was put on oxygen, IV fluids were restarted, and EKG was ordered, labs were drawn including chemistries, coags, cbc, type and cross, troponin.
Serial EKG were collected.
On [**7-5**], patient had a troponin bump, and had a CTA which showed multiple lobar, segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli.
Echo showed a dilated and hypokinetic RV consistent with a medium-large PE.
Venous duplex showed DVT of BL posterior tibial veins, of which the left may be chronic.
- Talk to Urology re: Lovenox -> wait until Cr settles out (contrast x2 for cath and CTA) - Pm Hct drop: will get hemolysis labs, fibrinogen, coags, retic with am labs -> having some hematuria in Foley and urostomy bag but no clots [**7-6**] - Got a PICC - F/u cath report - Needs ICU consent - Urology: NTD, monitor for clots if + and obstructive, call urology - Transfused 2 units overnight after having melena (200cc) and gross hematuria -> decreased to PTT goal 50-60, rechecking labs at 10am: hct 29.
HDS - 1700 Labs: PTT 66.9 --> changed gtt to 850, Hct 27 --> 26 continues to be HD - GI consulted: NGL recommended against, think it's the anastamotic site - f/u HIT ab - ?RML and LUL opacity on CXR -> f/u CT read (resolved on today's CXR) -- on review of CT looks like pleural plaques [**7-7**]: - Okay to be out of bed with assist and close monitoring - PT consult in - + orthostatics: lying down 137/66, Sitting 113/55 - F/u with urology about stent removal, and recs are to hold off for now, will continue to reassess - thrombocytopenia-?
about IVC filter - Vascular study - by the end of the week - IV access PICC and 2 IVs - GI: they talked with him and he doesn't want any more procedures, just watch him for now [**7-8**] - Urology: call out to their service; sign out recs for vascular study; needs repeat echo in [**3-19**] wks - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts - HIT is negative  [**Date range (1) 69428**]: Mr. [**Known lastname 43526**] returned to the general urology floor where the remainder of his hospital course was unremarkable.
