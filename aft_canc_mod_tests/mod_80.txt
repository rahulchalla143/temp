DIAGNOSIS: CARDIAC MUSCLE AND FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE WITH FIBRIN DEPOSITION AND GRANULATION TISSUE REACTION.
By immunohistochemistry, tumor cells are pan reactive with CD45 and in addition, immunoreactive for CD20 and PAX-5, with co-expression of CD30, MUM1, and BCL-6.
The tumor cells are negative for cytokeratin cocktail (which stains the fibroblasts), synaptophysin, S-100, and TdT.
B cells comprise 1% of lymphoid-gated events, (<1% of total events), and do not express aberrant antigens.
INTERPRETATION Nonspecific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
The white blood cell count is normal.
Biopsy Slides: The core biopsy material is adequate for evaluation.
It consists of a 1.1 cm core biopsy of trabecular marrow with a cellularity of 70%.
IMAGING  2-D ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-9-19**]: The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%).
Right ventricular free wall infiltration cannot be excluded, especially in light of the thickened, hypocontractile appearance.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Consider cardiac MRI to better assess the possibility of right ventricular free wall infiltration  READ BY: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD  ECHOCARDIOGRAM POST-PERICARDIAL WINDOW: [**2120-9-21**] IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-9-19**], the previously seen pericardial fluid is no longer present.
READ BY: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-9-23**] Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-9-21**], the septal bounce has resolved.
[**2120-9-30**] Echo Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 45 year f with past medical history of hypothyroidisim presenting with diaphoresis, presyncope, and severe DOE and found to have an anterior medialstinal mass  consistnet with Primary Mediastinal Large B- Cell Lymphoma on pathology, transfered from CCU after pericardial window and resolution of tamponade to BMT service for intiation of R-[**Hospital1 **]  #Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma- The patient presneted with dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain.
A CT chest done as part of her evaluation was notable for a anterior mediastinal mass.
Biopsy of the pericardium and mediastinal mass was positve for B-cell lymphoma.
The patient was found to be in afib with RVR ( Hrs 130s-150s) on telemetry ( confirmed by EKG).
Two hours after inital episode the patient was satiing 91 on 2L, was normotensive with HR 80.
An echo was done the next morning, significant for an LVEF > 55%.
She was evaluated by cardiology who did not recommend long term anticogualtion for her afib, and to rate control with nodal agents if recurred.
Gram stain of fluid and tissue negative for organisms, 2+ polys and 0 polys, respectively.
Pericardial drain was pulled on [**9-21**] and f/u echo showed resolution of pericardial effusion.
She was monitored with serial echos during her hospital course which did not show reaccumulation of the pericardial effusion.
A UA and Urine Cx were sent which grew Proteus.
Information was obtained from Patient.
You were found to have a  cancer in your chest ( Primary Mediastinal large b cell lymphoma) and a blood clot in your lungs ( Pulmonary Embolism).
You were started on blood thiners to treat your blood clot ( Lovenox also known as enoxaparin) which you will continue to take on discharge.
