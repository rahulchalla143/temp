Chest pressure is without any radiation or associated nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.
A chest x-ray was done which showed a left pneumothorax.
Hypertension; transthoracic echocardiogram from [**2163-11-14**] showed a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 60%, diastolic dysfunction.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient had a temperature of 98.9, blood pressure 140/80, pulse 78, respiratory rate 20 and oxygen saturation 96% on four liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Moist mucous membranes, pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 4.4, hematocrit 36.8, platelet count 210,000, sodium 140, potassium 4.5, chloride 103, bicarbonate 30, BUN 16, creatinine 1, glucose 104, calcium 8.2, phosphorous 4.2, magnesium 2, CK 75, troponin less than 0.3.
RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Chest x-ray:  Large left sided pneumothorax with minimal right tracheal shift.
Several days later, the patient was still noted to have an air leak even though his chest x-ray showed signs of improvement in terms of his pneumothorax.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed normal left ventricular size and function, however, it was a limited study.
There was also concern that the patient was having increased secretions and mucus plugging, for which he received regular standing chest physical therapy.
Given the patient's poor pulmonary reserve, repeat pleurodesis was thought to be unwise.
Renal:  The patient was noted to have an increase in his creatinine up 1.4.
Eventually, once the Lasix was stopped, the patient's creatinine came down to 1.2.
