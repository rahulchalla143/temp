An emergent chest tube and left subclavian line were placed on [**3-12**] after discovery of the pneumothorax (likely the result of CVL attempt on [**3-11**]).
Multifocal hepatocellular cancer diagnosed in [**10-18**] on imaging which revealed two enhancing lesions within the liver: one in high dome of segment VII and the second was lateral to the bifurcation of the right portal vein.
MRI [**2-/2101**] revealed four dominant arterially enhancing lesions with progression of at least one lesion.
Underwent chemoembolization in [**2101-4-11**] and RFA [**4-19**].

Micro Data: Urine culture ([**3-20**]): ENTEROCOCCUS SP.
Blood cultures ([**3-20**]): [**1-13**] COAG NEGATIVE STAPH Blood cultures ([**Date range (1) 41174**]): NEGATIVE x5 Catheter tip culture ([**3-21**]): NEGATIVE .
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast ([**3-21**]): 1.
Patchy right upper lobe opacities and bilateral nodular densities are as previously seen.
A CT of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done to evaluate for progression of the hepatocellular cancer.
As expected by the elevated AFP, the CT showed extension of the liver cancer to involve the capsule and diaphragm.
Follow-up chest x-rays after chest tube removal showed stable bilateral pleural effusions.
Cultures from the pleural fluid (presumed to be draining from the peritoneal cavity) grew out vancomycin-resistent enterococcus.
Meanwhile, urine cultures taken on the same day grew out VRE as well.
Blood cultures were negative, with one positive coag negative staph culture likely representing a contaminant.
Initially, while the urine and pleural fluid cultures were still pending sensitivities, he was kept on ceftriaxone for UTI and presumptive SBP.
When the culture data returned, he was started on Daptomycin.
The fluid culture was negative.
On exam there was no focal tenderness or jaw malalignment to suggest bone metastases or fracture.
Oropharyngeal exam was remarkable for the absence of teeth (he has dentures).
