RADIOLOGISTS: The exam was read by doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 15785**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 380**].
TECHNIQUE: Extracranial evaluation of bilateral carotids was performed with B-mode, color and spectral Doppler modes in ultrasound.
FINDINGS: On the right, peak systolic velocities are 65, 100, and 75 cm/sec in the internal, common, and external carotid arteries, respectively.
The right ICA to CCA ratio is 0.65.
Post-operatively he was transferred to the ICU intubated, NPO, intravenous hydration, JP drain, gastrostomy to straight drainage, foley catheter, nasogastric tube; he was hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit of 35, and received intravenous beta-blockade for optimal cardio protection.
On POD 1, he was extubated and was oxygenating well on nasal cannula; he developed atrial fibrillation which converted to sinus rhythm with increased beta-blockade.
On POD 4, he was transferred to an in-patient nursing unit, his foley catheter and nasogastric tube were removed; he remained afebrile with good pain control with Morphine Sulfate.
On POD 6, he [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] a Gastrografin swallow study which was negative for a leak, his diet was advanced, and he had +flatus.
