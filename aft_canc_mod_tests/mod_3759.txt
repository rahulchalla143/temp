Her exam was significant for a left frontal echymosis and some swelling around her left orbit.
Laboratory studies were notable for WBC 12.3, Plt 644, Na 129, troponin 5.1, CK 3319.
A head CT revealed right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was febrile to 103 with BP 89/57.
Pt received Tylenol 1300mg, vancomycin 1g IVx1, levofloxacin 500mg IVx1, flagyl 500mg IVx1, norepinephrine, and dexamethasone.
Used to smoke about 1/2ppd x most of her life - > 45 years, quit 3-4 years ago.

CT C spine: no acute fracture .
Micro: BlCx x 2 negative .
Bronchial Washings, [**2177-3-6**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Pulmonary macrophages and rare bronchial cells.
CXR, [**2177-3-6**]: No evidence of pneumothorax status post transbronchial biopsy.
Echo [**2177-3-6**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are  normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and posterior (inferolateral) walls.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis, [**2177-3-7**]: 1.
Partially occlusive intraluminal filling defects inferiorly from the right upper lobe nodule as well as separate left lower lobe fourth order branch filling defect is better visualized on CTA of [**2177-3-3**], but likely still present.
[**2177-3-12**] Stereotactic brain biopsy, +6 mm (smear #15 only): Reactive brain, numerous cells with small, pyknotic nucleus and red cytoplasm, and single, microscopic, poorly-preserved fragment of atypical cells, suggestive of metastatic carcinoma.
The remaining tissue is either air dried, necrotic and partially mineralized, or contains blood with frequent nucleated red blood cells.
Nucleated red blood cells are abnormal and make the diagnosis of carcinoma suspect, especially given to poor preservation of the small cluster of suggestive cells.
A bone marrow biopsy to determine the cause of the nucleated red cells may be warranted.

She was started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and it was titrated according to serum levels with adjustment for a low albumin.
Sterotactic brain biopsy was performed which demonstrated metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma, histologically similar to the tumor in the patient's subsequent liver biopsy.
A CT chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed a large superficial lesion in the liver which was amenable to biopsy by ultrasound and demonstrated metastatic small cell carcinoma.
The patient's HR and O2 saturation were monitored closely during this hospitalization.
Her troponins were found to trend downward (0.45 -> 0.24 -> 0.18 in the setting of negative CK-MBs; CK was elevated most likely secondary to patient's fall and being immobilized for a period of time).
Echocardiogram showed evidence of posterior inferior wall motion abnormalities, raising concern for possible NSTEMI.
# EtOH dependence: The patient was placed on the CIWA scale with ativan as needed upon admission to the MICU.
This study has been ordered at [**Hospital1 18**].
You should call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 327**] to make an appointment for the study to be done.
Please check albumin and dilantin level check every Monday and Thursday.
Please check fingerstick blood glucose QID while on dexamethasone.
