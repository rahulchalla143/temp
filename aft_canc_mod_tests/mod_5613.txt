(1) Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:  Chest X-ray findings are consistent with decompensated CHF likely precipitated by hypertensive urgency/emergency (SBP was documented at 240 mmHg at OSH); could also consider parapneumonic effusion with ARDS.
Sputum, blood cultures, urine legionella were sent and showed and were negative up until the time of discharge.
A renal ultrasound was performed which did not reveal stenosis.
There was some discussion about an angiogram to rule out renal artery stenosis, but this was not done due to recent elevation in Cr to 1.3 with initiation of Lasix.
You came for further evaluation of shortness of breath.
Further evaluation showed that you had an episode of decompensated heart failure most likely due to greatly increased blood pressure.
The following changes have been made to your medications:  We INCREASED your labetalol dose to better control your blood pressure We STARTED lasix to better control your heart failure.
