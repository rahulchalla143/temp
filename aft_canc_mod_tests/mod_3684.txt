# CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2137-8-18**] 2:14 PM IMPRESSION: Multiple fractures as described above involving both orbits, the right temporal bone, and the sphenoid bone with several fracture clefts extending intracranially as described above.
# CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2137-8-18**] 2:14 PM IMPRESSION: Since approximately 13 hours prior, there is increase in extent of subarachnoid hemorrhages.
Lateral chest radiograph is technically nondiagnostic due to low lung volumes and respiratory motion.
[**2137-8-28**] Head CT FINDINGS: Since the prior study, there has been evolution of both the right frontal epidural hemorrhage, which is less evident than on the prior study, adjacent to the nondisplaced right frontal and temporal bone fracture.
Please refer to the CT of the sinus study done on [**8-18**] for full details regarding multiple fractures.
