Red blood cells were [**Pager number **].
Total protein of 2.8, albumin of 1.6, LDH of 750, glucose of 233, and pH of 7.59.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray at the outside hospital reportedly revealed (on [**2144-2-27**]) almost complete opacity of the left hemithorax with some right opacification.
Ultrasound performed on [**2144-2-27**] (at the outside hospital) reportedly revealed massive dilatation of the common bile duct (3.5 cm), with dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct.
Also, the patient was mildly tachycardic with oxygen saturations to 88% on room air.
On [**2144-3-4**], the patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
Also noted on the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was antral gastritis.
The patient was maintained on intravenous antibiotics for approximately 24 hours post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
The patient's diet was successfully advanced, and she was tolerating food well by approximately 36 hours post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain collected approximately 300 cc of serosanguineous fluid on the day before discharge.
