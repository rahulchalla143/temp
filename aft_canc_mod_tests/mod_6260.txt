The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
[**2199-4-28**] URINE CULTURE (Final [**2199-4-30**]): ESCHERICHIA COLI.
The left kidney has some surrounding nonspecific perinephric stranding, and an ill-defined area of decreased attenuation at the lower pole, which may represent a small infarct or focal pyelonephritis.
There is diffuse bony demineralization and degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine with slight anterolisthesis of L2 on 3 and slight retrolisthesis of L4 on 5, as well as L5 on S1.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY: Thoracic aorta maintains normal course and caliber with conventional arterial arch anatomy.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2199-5-2**] There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-4-26**], left ventricular function has improved.
VENOUS DUP EXT UNI (MAP/DVT) LEFT  [**2199-5-6**] 10:51 AM FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed in the left lower extremity veins as well as the left groin arterial vessels.

Recommendations were to transfuse to Hct >30, trend cardiac enzymes, and obtain an echo to evaluate wall motion.
On HD 1, his echo demonstrated mild symmetric LVH with mild global hypokinesis (LVEF 40-45%), borderline low CI (2-2.5), moderate MR, moderate to severe TR, and moderate to severe pulm HTN.
Cardiac enzymes trended down.
Echo was repeated on HD 7, and demonstrated improved LVEF (>55%), normal LV size & wall motion, and no masses/thrombi.
He underwent upper endoscopy on HD 1, which was normal to the 3rd portion of the duodenum.
On HD 5, he underwent small bowel enteroscopy, which was normal to the jejunum.
Colonoscopy performed on POD 8/PPD 3 demonstrated several benign appearing sessile polyps.
Cr was 1.2 on discharge.
It was restarted on POD 7/PPD 2 with goal PTT 40-60.
Ultrasound was negative for DVT and pseudoaneurysm.
At the time of discharge, patient was afebrile with stable vital signs, had palpable L pedal pulses, was tolerating regular diet, and was cleared by PT for d/c home with home PT & RN services (which he had prior to his hospital stay).
Temperature greater than 101.5F for 24 hours ??????
