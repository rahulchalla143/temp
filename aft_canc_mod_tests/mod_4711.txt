Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately to severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %) with infeior, lateral, anterior and apical hypokinesis to akinesis.
Persantine Stress Test [**2185-1-12**] IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or additional ST segment changes from baseline.
Nuclear Imaging Status Post Persantine Stress Test [**2185-1-12**] The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue, breast, and left arm attenuation.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 29% with an EDV of 203 ml.
Knee X-ray [**1-10**]: FINDINGS: Overlying knee brace obscures the bony detail of the knee.

UCX- yeast BCX- negative x2   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 68990**] is a 78 yo female with a PMH significant for CAD s/p PCI, HTN, HLD, COPD, recent right knee replacement complicated by septic joint, bilateral DVT s/p IVC filter transferred from OSH for management of hemoptysis and respiratory failure.
TTE showed worsening systolic function with new EF of 25-30% (from baseline of 40%).
Upon transfer to the floors, did not require further diuresis as physical exam was nt consistent with HF, no sob.
No further thoracic imaging was done to look for PE as patient was to receive systemic anticoagulation regardless for B/L DVT's.
BNP 50k, MB flat.
She had a TTE which showed an overall left ventricular systolic function which was moderately to severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %) with infeior, lateral, anterior and apical hypokinesis to akinesis (which is worse then her baseline EF of 40%).
Stress was negative for EKG changes/anginal symptoms, and MIBI showed irreversible defect in the PAD/LCx distribution.

It is a heart attack which occurs without changes seen on an EKG, but is detected by blood tests which tell your medical team that your heart muscle has been affected.
You also had a radionucleotide test to look at the tissue and function of your heart.
The results of these two tests informed your physicains that having a repeat catherization of the vessels of your heart would NOT be beneficial at this time.
Interventional pulmonology would like you to be seen for a repeat procedure within 30 days.
