ED CXR [**2135-11-4**]:There are large bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis and obscuration of the lung bases.
Heart size cannot be assessed.
MICU CXR [**2135-11-5**]: Again noted is a small to moderate-sized left pleural effusion, which is not significantly changed since the previous exam.
CTA [**2135-11-7**] on suspicion of PE: negative Upper and Lower Extremity US for DVT: negative 3.
EKG Results [**2135-11-5**]: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and ventricular premature beats.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2135-11-5**] no significant change 5.
ECHO [**2135-11-8**] The left and right atrium are markedly dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the  severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[Intrinsic right  ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of  tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2135-10-27**], the findings are similar.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] F with PMH diastolic CHF, PAF, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], SIADH who returns 2 days post discharge for failure to thrive/ hypotension/ AFib with RVR at rehab.
Cardiology: Cardiology suggested rate control with diltiazem as monotherapy as long as possible.
Heart rate was not adquately controled with diltiazem on Friday [**2135-11-10**] the patient and her family elected to have an atrial sinus ablation with a pacemaker placement.
