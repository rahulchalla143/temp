He was seen in clinic the afternoon of [**1-4**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and noted to have oxygen saturation in the mid-80% range in room air.
Oxygen saturation was 88% in room air and 95% on 6 liters of oxygen.
Computer tomography scan of the chest noted multiple small pulmonary emboli.
Patient was felt to be safe for anticoagulation as CT of the head was negative and there was no history of bright red blood per rectum or melena.
In [**2117**] received experimental protocol with lavage of T53 virus.
Temperature 97.7, blood pressure 133/79, heart rate 95, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 88% in room air to 95% on 6 liters nasal cannula.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 1.0, hematocrit 38.2, platelets 315, MCV 96.
Differential 84 neutrophils, 9 lymphocytes, 4 monocytes, 1 eosinophil.
PT 12.8, INR 1.1, PTT 24.1.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 105, CO2 26, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 105.
ALT 20, AST 28, alkaline phosphatase 97, LDH 355, total bilirubin 0.6, albumin 3.5.
Urinalysis amber, hazy, specific gravity 1.025, 5 red cells, 2 white cells, no bacteria, less than 1 epithelial cell.
Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 85 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, no Q waves, no ST segment or T wave changes as compared with [**2122-12-21**].
Chest x-ray showed worsening bilateral opacities compared with [**2121-3-6**] with increased tumor burden.
Computer tomography angiogram protocol of the chest showed five to six small pulmonary emboli in third order branches of the left lung.
Computer tomography of the head showed no mass lesions.
However, he continued to be profoundly hypoxic with oxygen saturation in the 80s on nonrebreather oxygen face mask whenever off noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.
Options were discussed with the patient and his wife, [**Name (NI) **], and all agreed to try thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator in order to attempt to improve perfusion of the pulmonary capillary bed.
