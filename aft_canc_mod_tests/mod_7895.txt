His stay was complicated by hematuria (had CBI per Urology and was d/c'd to rehab with no foley), so his Warfarin had been held on discharge.
Also had [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD (baseline Cr is 2.5, bumped to 4.8 likely from CIN, was down to 2.8 upon discharge).
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.0 77 122/64 24 99% 2L Nasal Cannula.
Labs notable for WBC 17.2 (86.7%N, no bands), Hct 29 (which is baseline), Cr 2.7 (baseline 2.5), INR 2.6.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation per report, although this EKG is not in the chart.
CXR with bibasilar opacities and pulmonary edema that is significantly worse when compared to [**4-23**].
His systolic BP has been ~100 so lasix gtt has been on and off.

[**2187-5-16**] urine cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Degenerated urothelial cells, neutrophils and many red blood   cells.
CXR PA&LAT [**2187-5-14**]: Findings suggesting moderate pulmonary edema.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2187-5-14**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Urine cytology and further assessment with either ultrasound or direct urological evaluation should be considered.
CXR [**2187-5-19**]: FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from [**2187-5-14**].
CXR [**2187-5-23**]: FINDINGS:  A single portable chest radiograph is limitted by low lung volumes and mild rotation.
The right hemidiaphragm is excluded from view on these images which limits evaluation for free intraperitoneal air.
[**2187-6-5**] RUQ ULTRASOUND: FINDINGS:  Note is made that only a partial ultrasound exam was performed as the patient refused to complete the examination.
Only a partial exam was performed as the patient refused to complete.
Most recent TTE from previous admission in [**3-/2187**] showed EF 30-35%, likely due to critical AS (see below).
He was started on IV lasix gtt, however diuresis was difficult due to his low blood pressure and his preload dependence from AS.
His urine output declined and on HD#6 he was transferred to CCU for initiation of CVVH for volume removal (see below).
He did well and returned to [**Location 52753**] on CVVH with removal of 10L of fluid.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt has stage IV CKD with most recent creatinine on discharge 2.5.
His creatinine gradually increased from 2.7 on admission to 4.7 and BUN 110-120.
His urine output declined and he began to demonstrate signs and symptoms of uremia with nausea/vomiting, AMS and asterixis.
His urine output did not improve and he was transferred to the CCU for placement of temporary dialysis line and CVVH.
He did well and returned to [**Location 52753**] on CVVH with removal of 10L of fluid.
He did tolerate intermittent HD with blood pressures in the 70s/40s but he was mentating.
There had been discussions with renal and transplant surgery about transitioning to peritoneal dialysis which might be gentler on the patient's blood pressure.
His HITT antibody was positive at an optical density which suggested to hematology consultant that he did indeed have HITT.
There was a serotonin release assay sent to confirm this diagnosis which was pending when he expired.
When he continued to have rising leukocytosis on this regimen a repeat set of cultures was sent on all body fluids and his urine grew VRE (see below).
He was narrowed again to PO vancomycin 125 po q6 hours to complete a 14 day course following completion of 7 days of tigecycline 50 mg q12h for VRE in the urine.
# Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE): His urine culture did grow VRE on two occasions.
Infectious work up revealed C.diff infection and colonization of urine with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (cultures positive but UA without pyuria indicating asymptomatic colonization).
Nonetheless, his white count continued to rise even after clinical resolution of C.diff and with empiric treatment of VRE.
Felt most likely due to CML since his hydroxyurea was recently discontinued due to renal failure and thrombocytopenia.
He had CT abdomen/pelvis in the ED which showed question of focal density in the bladder lumen, which is most likely clot but raises concern for malignant lesion.
Urine cytology was negative for malignant cells.
INR was therapeutic on admission but warfarin was held for much of the admission while awaiting decisions on the aortic valve proceudres and for placement of dialysis catheters.
He was maintained on heparin IV during this time with PTT 60-100.
# Hypertension (HTN): Systolic blood pressures during admission were ranging from 70s-90s even on intermittent HD.
# Hyperlipidemia (HLD): Continued Simvastatin # Diabetes mellitus, type 2 (DMT2): Diet controlled.
# GERD: Continued home Omeprazole # Hyperparathyroidism: Continued Calcitriol # Gout: Allopurinol held due to acute on chronic renal failure.
