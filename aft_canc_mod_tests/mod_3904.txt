IMAGING: [**10-5**] CT T/A/P: CT OF THE THORAX.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The liver enhances homogeneously with the exception of a 5 x 7 mm hypoattenuating and hypoenhancing lesion in segment VII of the right lobe (2:47) which is unchanged with respect to prior study.
The right kidney shows no focal lesions while the left kidney shows two tiny hypoenhancing lesions (2:63) that are unchanged with respect to [**2156-9-14**].
Some prominent paraaortic lymph nodes are noted; however, these nodes are not enlarged by CT size criteria.
[**10-6**] HRCT CHEST: Despite attempts to achieve both inspiratory and expiratory imaging, most of the imaging appears to have occured during expiration.
Bibasilar atelectasis and atelectasis adjacent to bilateral heart borders is present.
In this young patient, there remains residual thymic tissue (5:17) measuring 4.6 x 2.7 cm, decreased compared to a study from [**2156-7-9**].
Although not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, limited views of the upper abdomen appear within normal limits.
Predominantly expiratory study causing airtrapping, which is somewhat more pronounced on the full expiratory study.
[**10-8**] CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS: COMPARISON: CT of the torso [**2156-10-5**].
TECHNIQUE: Helical images were acquired of the abdomen and pelvis following the administration of oral and intravenous contrast.
Paraaortic lymphadenopathy is again noted, which is not enlarged by CT size criteria.
[**10-12**] MRI HEAD: COMPARISON: MRI head without and with contrast dated [**2156-9-3**], [**2156-7-9**], and [**2156-1-16**].
Sagittal MP-RAGE and axial T1-weighted images were obtained after administration of contrast with axial and coronal reconstructions.
The ventricles, cortical sulci, and extra-axial CSF spaces appear normal.
Resolution of the suprasellar mass, which was noted in the previous study.
[**10-12**] MRI LUMBAR SPINE AND PELVIS: COMPARISON STUDY: None.
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, T2, STIR and axial T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained of the lumbar spine prior to administration of contrast.
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images were obtained of the lumbar spine after administration of contrast.
MICRO: [**2156-10-13**] 1:00 pm STOOL     CONSISTENCY: NOT APPLICABLE       UNABLE TO ADD ON C.DFFICILE TOXIN AND VIRAL CULTURE (SENT IN       BACTERIAL TRANSPORT MEDIUM).
CYCLOSPORA STAIN (Final [**2156-10-14**]):    NO CYCLOSPORA SEEN.
FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2156-10-15**]):    NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA FOUND.
CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2156-10-15**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
[**10-7**] CMV VIRAL LOAD SERUM NEGATIVE .
10/13 L ILIAC BIOPSY    GRAM STAIN (Final [**2156-10-14**]):       1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
His intense left hip pain continued and he had an MRI which showed that he had diffuse marrow involvement by lymphoma.
There was no cause identiied by the CT abdomen and pelvis, he received an MRI lumbar/sacral spine which showed diffuse marrow involvement by lymphoma.
Acute abdominal series did not show megacolon or free air but repeat CT abdomen [**10-12**] did show worsening pancolitis compared to [**10-8**] despite treatment with po vancomycin, IV metronidazole, and tigecycline.
The infectious disease team was consulted to assist with possible other causes of leukocytosis and pancolitis since his C. diff toxin and PCR was negative.
His CMV viral load was negative.
His stool cultures were negative for all pathogens.
He underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy which showed nodules which may have been consistent with pseudomembranous colitis, however, the biopsies are still pending.
CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # HIV: Last CD4 count 60 on [**9-19**] due to poor compliance with his medications.
Although this can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea if he were in an adrenal crisis, he also had signs of acute infectious colitis on the CT scan and leukocytosis.
