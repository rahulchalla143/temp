Chronic renal insufficiency with a bowel sounds creatinine of 1.5 to 2.2.
Left hydronephrosis/hydroureter on CT scan in [**2110-1-3**].
Congestive heart failure, status post transthoracic echocardiogram showing moderate left atrial enlargement, mild right atrial enlargement, left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed the patient was intubated and responded to voice and command, nodded "yes" to abdominal discomfort.
Vital signs revealed a temperature of 98, heart rate was 87, and N blood pressure was 112/39, A blood pressure was 106/49.
Neck examination revealed right internal jugular triple lumen was in place.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, distant first heart sound and second heart sound.
Chest examination revealed rhonchorous upper airway sounds bilaterally.
Ventilation pressures revealed respiratory 9, SaO2 was 100%, OP, A-C 8 X 600, FIO2 was 0.5, positive end-expiratory pressure was 5.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION: Laboratory values revealed a white blood cell count of 9.2, hematocrit was 29.7, platelets were 401.
Sodium was 135, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 92, bicarbonate was 29, blood urea nitrogen was 68, creatinine was 1.8, blood glucose was 114.
PT was 12.8, PTT was 30.2.
A chest x-ray preoperatively showed cardiomegaly with no evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure, status post coronary artery bypass graft and pacemaker, with an ejection fraction of 20%.
Her admission transfusion hematocrit was 28.1.
The patient's blood pressures remained stable during her initial hospital stay; however, on postoperative day seven, the patient was noted to have a decrease in blood pressure.
However, her heart rate was maintained.
The patient's blood pressure was stabilized with fluid boluses, but secondary to her increased abdominal girth and rebuilding of ascites, the patient was also diuresed with 5% albumin boluses.
The patient remained afebrile, but due to the concern of sepsis and her blood pressure dropping to 70s/30s to 40s, the patient was empirically started on Unasyn intravenously, and blood and urine cultures were drawn.
The patient's hematocrit was drawn and noted to be stable at 36.3.
At this time, there was no indication that the patient was breathing intraperitoneally, as her urine output was maintained adequate.
For the remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, her blood pressures were maintained with fluid and oral intake.
A Foley catheter had been placed to monitor urine output.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  After the patient's hypertension episode on postoperative day three, the patient was noted to have blood cultures that were gram-negative rod positive.
The patient had been on Unasyn, but secondary to the findings and the fact that the patient had a white blood cell count of 11.7 (with neutrophils of 67, 20 bands, 5 lymphocytes, 7 monocytes, and 0 eosinophils), the patient's antibiotics were switched from Unasyn to Zosyn and Flagyl.
The patient also had urine cultures that were positive for enterococci.
Subsequent complete blood count noted that the patient's bands had gone down to 2, but intravenous antibiotics were continued until the patient's discharge date.
Throughout the remainder of the patient's stay, she was maintained on maintenance fluids, and her electrolytes were checked on a regular basis.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction; percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft; left ventricular ejection fraction of 36%.
(hold for a systolic blood pressure of less than 110).
