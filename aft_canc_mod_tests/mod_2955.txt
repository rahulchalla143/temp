She stated that her abdomen yesterday was not as distended as usual.
She felt that the right side of her chest was tender to palpation and that it was difficult to take in a deep breath.
The patient arrived to [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room on the morning of admission when she had a chest x-ray showing a large right sided pleural effusion.
Her initial vital signs in the Emergency Room were temperature 99, blood pressure 104/30, heart rate 125, respiratory rate 21, oxygen saturation 95% on 6 liters nasal cannula.
A pleurocentesis was performed in the Emergency Room, yielding 1000 cc of bloody fluid, with a post procedure chest x-ray showing decreased size in the effusion and no pneumothorax.
Her blood pressure was undetectable, whereas on arrival to the floor her blood pressure is 110/62.
An arterial blood gas performed prior to intubation with dagging was pH 7.22, PCO2 54, oxygen saturation PAO2 465.
A neo-synephrine drip was started with an increase in her blood pressure to systolic in the 70s.
An echocardiogram done at the bedside prior to transfer to the unit showed right ventricular dilatation with mild to moderate right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.
An arterial blood gas done after intubation on assist control with tidal volume 400, respiratory rate of 20, FIO2 of 100% was pH 7.38, PCO2 33, PAO2 410.
A hematocrit done on the arterial blood gas was 18, with a repeat CBC showing a hematocrit of 14 with an INR of 1.3.
Her anemia was thought to be secondary to her hemothorax given the increased effusion on her chest x-ray and recent intervention.
During the initial part of her Intensive Care Unit stay she received a total of 10 units of packed red blood cells, 11 liters of intravenous normal saline.
On her laboratory examinations she was noted to be slightly more coagulopathic with her INR rising from 1.3 to 1.9, PTT increasing from 27 to 35 and fibrinogen of 93 with a D-dimer greater than [**2196**].
A repeat arterial blood gas after resuscitation with fluid and blood products was pH 6.96, PCO2 68, PO2 124.
Her ventilator settings were changed to increase her respiratory rate to 34 to allow increased ventilation after which her arterial blood gas improved to a pH of 7.1, PCO2 of 37, PO2 of 194.
Her blood pressure then improved to systolics between 120 and 140.
Her peak inspiratory pressures increased to 50 with a plateau pressure of 40 and auto PEEP of 12.
A bronchoscopy was performed on the day of transfer to the MICU showing some degree of airway edema, erythematous and hemorrhagic mucosa.
Her systolic blood pressure subsequently increased to 200.
Her sedation was subsequently increased along with her paralytics with a slight decrease in her blood pressure and peak inspiratory pressures.
Lasix 20 mg intravenous was given after which the patient diuresed 1 liter and her peak inspiratory pressures decreased to 35 to 40 and her systolic blood pressure decreased to high 90s.
In [**2200-3-1**] a PET scan showed metastasis to the lung, sternum, left humerus, three lumbar vertebra, left proximal femur, liver and nodal metastasis.
A chest CT performed in [**2200-3-1**] showed a region in the right hilum with associated adenopathy.
On [**2200-3-19**] bronchoscopy with biopsy revealed malignant melanoma.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT: Temperature 98.
Blood pressure 111/85.
Heart rate 110.
Respiratory rate 24.
Oxygen saturation 100% on AC with tidal volume of 400, respiratory rate of 20, PEEP of 5, FIO2 of 100%.
Head and neck examination pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Cardiac examination normal S1 and S2.
Neurological examination full range of motion in all four extremities.
LABORATORY EXAMINATIONS ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 4, hematocrit 29.4, platelets 82, sodium 127, potassium 4.1, chloride 94, bicarbonate 23, BUN 12, creatinine 0.4, glucose 110.
PT 14.1, PTT 27.1, INR 1.3, calcium 7.4, magnesium 1.5, phosphorus 1.8, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 61, ALT 95, AST 160, LD 1220, alkaline phosphatase 556, amylase 16, lipase 16, pleural fluid with 325 white blood cells, 737,500 red blood cells, 65% polys, 3% bands, 21% lymphocytes, 4.1 protein, glucose 52 and LD 805.
Gram stain of pleural fluid without any polys or microorganisms.
Fluid culture pending.
Arterial blood gas on the above ventilator settings were pH 7.22, PCO2 54, O2 465.
IMAGING:  Chest x-ray on transfer to the Intensive Care Unit showing interval enlargement of right pleural effusion with only a small amount of residual aerated right lung.
Electrocardiogram showing sinus tachycardia at 120 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals, T wave flattening in 3, AVL and V2.
A repeat chest x-ray showed increased size of her pleural effusion after her tap, a 14 point drop in her hematocrit.
The patient had intermittent episodes of hypotension with systolic blood pressures into the 70s, which responded well to intravenous fluid boluses.
On increasing her PEEP to 25 her systolic blood pressure dropped into the 60s.
The patient was not sent down for a CT angiogram to evaluate for a pulmonary embolism as she was deemed to be too unstable to go to the CT scanner.
The patient was finally tried on pressure support of 15 with a PEEP of 5 and failed.
Her vital signs rapidly deteriorated over the next one to two minutes.
A respiratory therapist was unable to ventilate the patient.
Renal:  The patient had stable renal function with good urine output throughout her Intensive Care Unit stay.
She subsequently had decreased white blood cell count suggestive of sepsis versus dilutional secondary to massive fluid resuscitation.
An abdominal ultrasound was done, which showed no ascites.
It was decided to not further broaden her antibiotic coverage and to follow surveillance culture results and treat accordingly.
An initial KUB showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern.
She could not be sent for an abdominal CT as she was thought to be too unstable.
The decrease in her white blood cell count was also thought to be secondary to sepsis versus dilutional.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable after initial resuscitation with blood products.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to assess hemodynamics revealing increased pulmonary artery pressures to 50/30, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22, with a cardiac output of 6 and cardiac index of 3 and SVR of 665 indicating that the patient was retaining sufficient fluid in her intravascular space, but was still demonstrating ............ physiology secondary to a systemic inflammatory response.
She initially had a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis, which was likely dilutional.
She was also hypocalcemic initially secondary to massive resuscitation with blood products.
Her electrolytes were repleted as needed.
