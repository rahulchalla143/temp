Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**5-3**] percutaneous drain placement  History of Present Illness: Following admission to an outside hospital, he was extensively fluid resuscitated, intubated due to respiratory distress, required vasopressor support, transfused 2 units of RBC for a Hct of 21.1, started on TPN and started on IV antibiotics Invanz and flagyl.
Past Medical History: Ulcerative colitis, osteoporosis, polyps, depression  Social History: non-contributory   Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: On admission T 98.5  HR 73  BP 96/59  RR 14  on CMV 0.4  500x12(5) Peep 5 sats 100% on vaso 2.4, propofol 20 Gen - intubated, sedated, ETT, OGT in place Card - RRR Pulm - Coarse bilaterally Abd - soft, mild distention, hypoactive bowel sounds, non tender Abdominal wound - healing, clean base, no surrounding erythema.
Therefore, a contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained prior to the procedure with administration of 130 cc of Optiray.
Using CT fluoroscopy for guidance, an 8 French catheter was placed into the pelvis into the largest fluid pocket utilizing Seldinger technique via the left transabdominal approach.
A sample was sent for culture and stain.
Fluid sample sent for culture and stain.
[**5-8**] CT Fluoroscopy was used to guide insertion of a 19-gauge guiding needle via the transabdominal approach.
However, CT fluoroscopy images obtained during the procedure to confirm location of the guiding needle demonstrated significant rapid shift of fluid within the pelvis with only minimal amount of fluid remaining in the initially targeted left lower quadrant pocket.
Therefore, percutaneous drainage of this free flowing fluid was deemed unsafe and therefore was not performed.
[**5-9**] COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen and pelvis [**2185-5-8**].
As before, note is made of a gap in the suture line of ileal pouch that measures approximately 11 mm on axial images and 3 cm on the coronal images (series 4, image 33).

[**5-3**] pressors weaned off, a CT abdomen was performed which demonstrated moderate amount of fluid in the abdomen and pelvis, without definite loculated components or focal abscesses.
[**5-8**] - repeat CT scan abdomen demonstrating increase in the amount of intraperitoneal fluid and prominent peritoneal enhancement not not ammenable to drainage.
[**5-9**] - repeat CT scan showing no significant interval change in the amount of intraperitoneal fluid.
[**5-13**] - caspofungin discontinued, started on fluconazole  [**5-15**] Repeat CT scan demonstrating marked decrease in abdominal fluid collection.

Monitoring Ostomy Output / Prevention of Dehydration: *Keep well hydrated.
*Try to maintain ostomy output between 500mL to 1000mL per day.
