His pertinent past surgical history leading up to the current hospitalization is as follows: - [**6-/2196**]: Diagnosed with and underwent resection for hemangiopericytoma of L frontal lobe - [**2196-9-29**]: Craniolasty with synthetic bone graft c/b MRSA, removal of graft, 6 week course of vancomycin - [**6-/2197**]: tumor recurrence near anterior falx -> cyberknife - [**8-/2197**]/[**2198**]: Scalp expanders -> removal of expanders - [**9-/2198**]: Cranioplasty & found to have tumor recurrence in posterior fossa with 4th ventrical obstruction -> External Ventricular Drain placed and removed, treated with Vanc/Ceftriaxone - [**10/2198**]: Discharged on no antibiotics to rehab - [**2198-11-28**]: Discharged home from rehab - [**2198-12-4**]: Seen by plastics with no post-op problems .

In the ED, initial vitals were: T 100.4, HR 98, BP 118/89, RR 16, SaO2 98% RA.
Neurosurgery recommended Head CT which showed frontal subgaleal soft tissue edema without underlying fluid collection or abscess; neurosurgery recommended discharge home with follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

BC [**12-11**] showed 1 out of 4 coag -ve staph.
MRI on [**12-14**] ruled out seeding to the CNS but did demonstrate increased fluid.
This was sent for culture and grew GPCs and budding yeast.
Post op head CT was stable.
On POD#2 he was cleared for transfer to the step down unit after a repeat Head CT remained stable.
On POD#3 his INR began to increase again for unknown cause (no anticoagulation, LFT's WNL) therefore he was given 1x dose of Vit K due to his recent surgery.
The pus was sent for culture and grew GPCs and budding yeast.
An MRI scan on [**12-14**] ruled out CNS seeding but did show an increased collection.
Cultures were again sent from the operating room.
He was followed by the infectious disease team and as the cultures grew it was revealed that his infection was MRSA.
ID decided that a 6wk course of vanco/ceftaz/flagyl would be necessary ([**12-16**] - [**1-26**]).
# CXR Consolidation: Admitted with a resolving chronic cough in the setting of a recent history of HA-PNA and possible RLL infiltrate on CXR concerning for aspiration.
On [**12-20**] he underwent video swallow which showed that he had silent aspiration with thin barium but was good with nectar thick.
