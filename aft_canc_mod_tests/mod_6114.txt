She was in remission until this month when she had a restaging CT scan because of an elevated creatinine.
Biopsy showed recurrence of her grade 3b follicular cell lymphoma.
She has since been found to have a rising LDH and hypercalcemia, and decided with her local oncologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 20676**] [**Name (STitle) 31966**], to enter into a study protocol #DF 09-111, "Safety and Efficacy study of Ofatumumab in combination with ICE or DHAP Chemotherapy in Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive Lymphoma Prior to Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation."
Biopsy of a left inguinal node showed grade 3b follicular lymphoma with a MIB of 50-60%, and she was treated with 6 cycles of R-CHOP completing therapy in [**2179-3-18**].
PET scan was negative at the completion of chemotherapy and her most recent prior CT scan was done in [**10/2179**] and also was negative for disease relapse.
However, in early [**2180-5-17**], she underwent restaging CT done without contrast because of an elevated creatinine and she was found to have a large right pelvic sidewall mass (6.5 x 3.1 cm) causing obstruction of her ureter causing right hydronephrosis.
She underwent ultrasound-guided biopsy again of a left inguinal lymph node, which again showed a grade 3 follicular lymphoma.
Her LDH and calcium had been within normal limits at previous oncologist visit, and she was sent here for further evaluation and consideration of autologous stem cell transplant.
Her father is deceased at age 77 from a brain tumor.
