He underwent colonoscopy which showed intussusception and fungating cecal mass with biopsies showing invasive adenoCa.
Pre-surgery he was given cardiac clearance after having a stress test that showed only inferior scarring and an ECHO with EF of 50%.
A TTE was read as reduced LVEF to 25%, with mid/distal anterior wall akinesis, and inferior wall akinesis/scarring.
LV apex documented as akinetic as well with mild impairment of the RV iwth free wall hypokinesis.
He was started on aspirin 325 mg and heparin gtt on [**6-25**] following the echo results.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of presumed peri-operative MI.

CXR [**2107-6-27**]: FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new right internal jugular vein catheter.
CARDIAC CATH [**6-29**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Selective arterial conduit angiography demonstrated a patent LIMA to LAD graft.
Left heart catheterization revealed a severely elevated LVEDP of 28 mmHg.
There was normal systemic arterial blood pressure with a central aortic blood pressure of 101/55 mmHg.
Right heart catheterization revealed severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
The mean RA pressure was moderately elevated at 14 mmHg, and the RVEDP was severely elevated at 18 mmHg.
There was moderate pulmonary hypertension with a PA pressure of 47/22 mmHg and a mean PA pressure of 32 mmHg.
The cardiac output and index were normal at 5.2 L/min and 2.7 L/min/m2.
Selective renal angiography demonstrated patent bilateral renal arteries  FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.

He underwent cardiac cath with no interventions, thought to have a autolysed thrombosis from heparin gtt > 48 hours before cath.
Prior to surgery his EF was 45% by echo and then after the surgery he was hypotensive and developed new focal wall motion abnormalities with depressed EF to 25%, concerning for new ischemia.
His Troponin peaked at OSH at 2.5 and he was transferred here for evaluation via cath of his coronaries.
Cardiac cath showed chronic disease with occluded RCA, LAD 60% occluded but prior stent patent, and Left circumflex 80% occluded.
# Systolic congestive heart failure: patient has history of decreased EF however his preop TTE showed EF of 50% and postop showed EF of 25% with focal wall motion abnormality concerning for ischemic heart failure due to MI perioperatively.
Weight at discharge is 80.1 kg.
#Liver cirrhosis:  He had a CT abdomen at the OSH for staging which showed nodular liver and the intraoperative report noted a nodular, cirrhotic liver.
His LFTs were normal, platelets were greater than 200, and INR was 1.4.
Albumin was 3.2  Social work was consulted to help with his alcohol abuse and he should have further work-up and follow-up for chronic cirrhosis.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - New diagnosis of cirrhosis need outpatient FU - Has f/u appt with surgeon on [**7-12**], wife has appt details.
