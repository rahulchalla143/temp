Evaluation of the lung parenchyma demonstrates marked thickening of the interlobular septae with ground glass change identified within the superior segments of the right lower lobe (series 2, image 21), distal segment of the right middle lobe (series 2, image 25) and within the superior segment of the lingula (series 2, image 31).
This is actually unchanged when compared to chest radiograph from [**2137-10-24**].
Evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates pneumobilia within the left lobe of the liver with surgical clips identified in the gallbladder fossa, and plastic stent is noted in a decompressed CBD.
CT OSSEOUS SKELETON: Evaluation of the bony skeleton shows multilevel degenerative changes in the dorsal spine with relative osteopenia of the bony skeleton without osseous destructive lesion.
RUQ U/S [**2137-10-29**]:FINDINGS: There are no focal hepatic lesions.
There is no evidence of common bile duct stones, however evaluation with ultrasound is limited.
The right kidney measures 9.6 cm, the left kidney measures 10.1 cm.
CXR [**2137-10-28**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-24**], there is some decrease in the opacification in the right mid and lower lung zones, most likely representing some decreasing atelectasis in a patient with improved degree of inspiration.
Pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal at this time.
# Tachypnea with hypoxia: likely [**2-26**] to fluid overload based on CXR which showed vascular congestion and diffuse bilateral opacities and exam with anterior crackles/wheezing and abdominal rounding; also may be due to underlying PNA however it was difficult see definite opacity in LUL described at OSH due to volume overloaded on initial examination.
DX: BNP 6219, CE negative x 1, Sputum Cx contaminated, urine legionella antigen is negative.
O2 sats after walking did decrease to 88% and patient is discharged with 2 lit O2 per NC as needed for activity.A CTA was done and there was no evidence a pulmonary embolus.
Repeat ruq u/s prior to duscharge showed that th eCBD was patent and no evidence of obstruction.
Repeat ERCP planned for [**2137-11-28**].
A low lactose and low residue diet is recommeded , repeat stool cultures should be done if diarhhea persists.
#Thrombocytosis: Plt count was in normal range until two days prior to discharge.

Evaluation prior to admission your oxygen saturation did go dowm after activity and therefore we are prescribing oxygen for you to use as needed.Most likely you will not be needing the oxygen for a long time.
You should have labs drawn to check a cbc to follow plt count and electrolytes to asses any need for potassium supplements and renal function.
