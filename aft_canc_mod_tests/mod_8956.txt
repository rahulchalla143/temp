CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST [**2171-4-18**]: 1.
Correlation with labs and continued followup recommended.
Although no clear stones are identified, evaluation is severely limited due to the lack of intravenous contrast.
A dedicated CT with IV contrast is recommended for further characterization, when possible.
He presented with serum BUN/Cr of 222/43, hyperkalemia to 7.8 with EKG changes, and GAP acidosis of 28 poorly responsive to IV insulin/dextrose and bicarbonate drip.
Foley was placed initially at OSH with initiation of bleeding and patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Initial Renal/GU U/S showed moderate bilateral hydronephrosis with a large amount of echogenic material within the bladder consistent with hemorrhage.
Repeat U/S showed persistent left-sided mild hydronephrosis with improvement of right-sided hydronephrosis.
He was continued on dialysis for multiple sessions with gradual improvement in his creatinine and uremia.
His left tube continued to drain a substantial amount of urine daily, although the right tube averaged 150-200cc per day, which was felt to reflect decreased renal function on that side.
His creatinine should be monitored weekly and was 1.9 at the time of discharge.
His PSA was elevated to about 300 and bone scan showed multiple sites of metastases to bone.
The patient had a CT scan performed on [**4-18**] which showed an enlarged prostate.
ECG inferior Q-waves c/w with prior infarction and troponins were elevated, but difficult to interpret in the setting of renal failure.
Following dialysis, his pressures returned to the 140-160 range systolically and he was ultimately started on labetalol for blood pressure control.
CT head was initially unremarkable.
Stat CT head and neurology consult was obtained which showed new right occipital high attenuation likely representing intraparenchymal hemorrhage as well as left posterior occipital subdural hematoma.
MRI showed multiple watershed vs embolic infarcts.
He was started on CTX and vancomycin [**5-2**] for UTI given he had low grade fever, poor mental status, WBC with a few bands and positive UA (difficult to interpret given low UOP).
All cultures negative returned negative and antibiotics were stopped after 48 hours.
His platelets and hematocrit did not fully recover.
He was transfused multiple units of blood intermittently for anemia and should have a CBC checked weekly after discharge.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Weekly monitoring of chem10, CBC - Needs outpatient oncology f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for prostate cancer - Needs radiation oncology f/u for possible radiation of left shoulder - Neurology f/u given recent acute strokes - Needs urology f/u for his percutaneous nephrostomy tubes, will need to be changed at some point per urology recommendations - Needs at least daily PT for new embolic strokes  Medications on Admission: Medications: None   Discharge Medications: 1. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
The Urology team did a cystoscopy to look in your bladder and found that the prostate was bleeding.
You had tubes placed in both of your kidneys to help drain the urine and you soon did not need dialysis anymore.
Because of the way your prostate looked on the cystoscopy and certain lab tests (elevated PSA), you were diagnosed with prostate cancer that showed spread to the bone, that was seen on the bone scan.
