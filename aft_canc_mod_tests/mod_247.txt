Because of the pain, she underwent a CT of abd and pelvis on [**2158-10-4**], which found that dramatic increase in overall tumor burden and  metastatic disease at T11/T12 results in focal spinal instability with a invasion of the spinal canal with nearly 50% canal narrowing and greater than 50% vertebral body involvement.
[**2156-7-14**]: CT torso (done because of elevated alk phos) showed 1.5 and 0.6 cm left upper lobe nodules.
[**2156-8-26**]: Left upper lobectomy showed two foci of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
[**2157-5-4**]: MRI of T/L spine with disease at T10, T11 vertebral bodies, soft tissues T10-T12, and L3 body.
CT-guided biopsy consistent with renal cell carcinoma.
[**2158-2-7**]: MRI L-spine with T11 disease with persistent mass effect on thecal sac but no significant cord compression, and T9 and T10 disease, all likely unchanged.
[**2158-2-13**]: CT torso with interval marked progression of innumerable pulmonary mets since [**2157-8-2**].
CT torso showed osseous mets in spine and left ribs, with interva lincrease in size in soft tissue component at T11 encasing thecal sac, invading cord, and invading more than 50% of the spinal canal.
[**2158-4-19**]: C1D1 08-184 (avastin/temsirolimus) [**2158-6-7**]: CT torso with significant decrease in size of bilateral pulmonary lesions and stable osseous disease with decrease in soft tissue mass at T11 - [**Date range (3) 10263**]: admitted for PNA, mental status changes, found to have frontal CVA, taken off study - [**2158-8-9**] CT TORSO: stable disease  Other Past Med Hx: - Hypertension - Breast Cancer s/p resection - gout  Social History: She lives with her 3 sons who assist with her medical care.

Final MRI read in and shows cord compression.
neuro exam stable.
[**2158-10-8**] MRI T- and L-spine:1.
There is increase in the amount of compression of the vertebra as compared to the prior study, with increased epidural soft tissue and increased spinal canal stenosis.
MRI and skeletal survey were ordered and pt was found to have cord compression near T11-T12.
Pt was satisfied with regimen of neurontin and oxycontin standing, with oxycodone for breakthrough and dilaudid for refractory pain.
Hct was near baseline and remained stable.
