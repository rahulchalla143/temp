A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device is in place in a similar configuration.
Chest CT: Ground glass opacities likely areas of hemorrhage.
INR was not reversed as overt bleeding had abated on admission to unit, and he had remained HD stable.
## Mild hemoptysis: CT chest was performed and was notable for diffuse ground glass opacities.
In discussion with the patient, his family, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] it was felt that further evaluation with bronchoscopy would be unlikely to therapeutically benefit patient and so this was deferred.
However, since INR was still vastly subtherapeutic, he was discharged home with Lovenox bridge until he has a therapeutic INR 3-3.5.
He is scheduled to have his INR drawn on [**2132-2-21**], which was confirmed with the [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital3 **].
