She had a temperature maximum and temperature currently of 97.8 degrees.
Blood pressure was 142/100.
Respirations 30s, sating 100 percent on a nonrebreather mask but 91 percent on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination showed dry mucous membranes and unable to visualize posterior discs.
Cardiac examination is tachycardiac, no evidence of any murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities, show 2 plus lower extremity edema.
LABORATORY RESULTS ON PRESENTATION:  Sodium 135, potassium 8.8, chloride 100, carbon dioxide 23, BUN 10, creatinine 0.5, glucose 92, white blood cell count 14.4, hematocrit 26.9, platelets 720, lactate 1.2, liver function tests pending at the time of admission.
Within two hours of presentation to the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient became tachypneic and arterial blood gases showed increasing difficulty with oxygenation.
Bronchoscopy performed soon thereafter likewise showed good placement of her endotracheal tube.
Aspiration showed a large amount of purulent, sometimes bloody material within the lung parenchyma.
This initial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation evaluation took place on [**2188-11-13**].
Human immunodeficiency virus tests as well as critical stem tests had all come back negative.
Bedside echocardiogram showed evidence of a large pericardial effusion.
Initial intraoperative pathology showed pathology consistent with neuroendocrine carcinoma, again highly unusual for a woman of this age and this presentation.
A chest x-ray showed a gradually improving lung field, although the starting point from this was complete whiteout of both fields.
A single sputum culture did show Streptococcus pneumonia.
She likewise underwent daily bronchoscopy and several mucous plugs and purulent material was removed from her lungs.
Over the next two to three hours, the patient required increasing pressure support, maxing out Levophed, epinephrine, Natrecor, Neo-Synephrine and ventilator settings, none of which were to maintain a blood pressure compatible with life.
Likewise pH dropped consistently to 7.1 despite several cycles of bicarbonate.
