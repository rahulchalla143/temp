On this study the tip of the endotracheal tube is near the right main stem bronchus however on radiographs from subsequent days, the tip of the endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned.
[**2109-1-10**]: CT Abdomen and Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Multifocal nodular opacities throughout the bilateral lung fields, near- complete consolidation of the bilateral lower lobes and small bilateral pleural effusions.
[**2109-1-14**]: CT Torso IMPRESSION: 1.
CT evidence of necrotizing pancreatitis as previously described.
Although the study was not specifically tailored to assess the enhancement of the pancreas, decreased areas of enhancement in the head and body are again evident.
[**2109-1-14**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

2) Vasodilatory Shock: The patient was not hypotensive on his initial presentation to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] but over his first night in the unit developed severe hypotension with persistently low CVP's so that over his first two nights in the unit he required >15 L of NS and then LR in order to aim for a goal CVP of 15 and a MAP of >60.
Surgery strongly recommended avoiding the pressors in the setting of known pancreatitis and these were never required except for briefly on the night of [**2109-1-15**] when he received norepinephrine briefly in order to get enough blood pressure to allow furosemide bolusing.
His hypotension resolved and he required no further fluid boluses after [**2109-1-15**].
Numerous blood and urine cultures remained negative but the patient did have growth of E. coli *2 in his sputum.
5) Pancreatitis: CT scan on [**2109-1-10**] showed necrotizing pancreatitis.
The patient had a repeat scan on [**2109-1-14**] to rule out subdiaphragmatic abscess as he had persistent hiccups on the ventilator; this showed no interval change.
Surveillance cultures to date had no growth.
