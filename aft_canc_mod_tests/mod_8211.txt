She was emperically covered with vancomycin and zosyn but all cultures were negative and she was narrowed to augmentin to cover for post-obstructive PNA, however re-started back on vanc/zosyn when she decompensated after a further bronch procedure.
TTE showed no evidence of tamponade, but showed a trivial pericardial effusion.
Patient was weaned off pheylephrine, midodrine, and fludrocortisone and her BP has been stable on the floor.
#) Dyspnea/Respiratory failure (hypercarbic and hypoxemic): Thought to be likely multifactorial in etiology, in setting of lung cancer, obstructive lesion, RUL collapse, pleural effusion, possible post-obstructive pneumonia, and ?
