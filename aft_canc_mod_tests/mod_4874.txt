Labs were notable for WBC of 0.5, Cr of 2 (Bl 1.8), and significant transaminitis (AST 1266, ALT 643, AlkP 333, LDH 1235, T bili 1.5).
Lipase was 3360.
CT A/P revealed findings concerning for gallstone pancreatitis with 16mm distal CBD dilation.
Blood cultures were obtained.

[**5-14**] CT A/P: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
This could reflect secondary inflammatory changes from pancreatitis, though clinical correlation is suggested and HIDA scan could be performed for further clarification if indicated.
He also preseted with a lipase of 3360 and findings on CT suggestive of gallstone etiology (1.6 cm CBD dilation, distended gallbladder, and new transaminitis).
Advanced Endoscopy was consulted and an ERCP with sphincterotomy was performed on [**5-15**] and plastic stent was placed wo complication.
RUQ U/S showed no gallstones so surgery decided they would not place a decompressiont tube, and already decided he wasn't a surgical candidate for CCY.
Lipase was downtrending from 3360 to 123 from [**5-14**] to [**5-18**].
His BCx on [**5-14**] returned positive for ENTEROBACTER AEROGENES, that was acutely cipro sensitive.
We trended his LFTs, which improved post-procedure, and held his Simvastatin during the hospitalization and also at discharge as pt's life expectancy is 6 months and the benefit of simvastatin is over the course of many years.
No prior echo was available.
He has no s/sx of bleeding on exam throughout this admission, so we continued him on a PPI.
You were treated with an ERCP during which a biliary stent was placed, and your symtoms improved.
