She went to OSH ([**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **]), where Hct was found to be 13.3 (baseline 34), trop I 0.31 (thought to be due to demand ischemia).
Vitals at OSH were reportedly stable with HR 95 and BP 105/43.
GI and cardiology were consulted, large-bore IV access x 3 obtained, and blood was sent for crossmatch.
HCT was 23.3.
Vitals stable here.
BP 120s/53.

Thyroid nodule in the left lobe should be correlated with prior imaging or further evaluated with routine thyroid ultrasound.
Endoscopy Colonoscopy Findings:	 Protruding Lesions	A broad-based 5 cm mass with overlying exudate was found in the cecum.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology.
Brief Hospital Course: 66F with PMH of COPD and DM presented with GI bleed and chest pain, found to have HCT of 13 out OSH.
ACTIVE #  Gastroinstestinal Bleed: The patient was admitted to the MICU from outside hospital with a HCT of 13.
Her HCT was 31 and she remained hemodynamically stable.
An EGD was performed which was unremarkable for a cause of her GI bleed.
She was prepped for colonoscopy and transfused another unit of PRBCs to maintain her HCT greater than 30.
Colonoscopy performed the next day revealed hemorrhoids and a 5cm mass in the cecum concerning for malignancy.
Her HCT was stable at ~30 and she remained hemodynamically stable during the remainder of her stay with no evidence of GI bleed.
Her EKG demonstrated ST depression in the lateral leads which improved with administration of PRBCs, which were felt to be due to demand ischemia.
Her HCT was maintained at > 28 in the setting of her troponin leak and symptoms.
She was started on metoprolol that was uptitrated to 25 [**Hospital1 **] to a goal heart rate of 60.
She will need cardiology evaluation after surgery with stress testing and possible catheterization is performed.
Losartan was restarted prior to discharge and the patient was instructed to restart her HCTZ only after consulting with her PCP for blood pressure check.
She underwent pre-operative pulmonary evaluation prior to discharge.

A colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) were performed.
EGD showed no cause for your bleeding.
However, the colonoscopy showed a 5 centimeter mass in the right side of your colon as well as hemorrhoids, both of which were likely to have contributed to your bleeding.
We still do not have the pathology results from the biopsy taken from the colon mass.
