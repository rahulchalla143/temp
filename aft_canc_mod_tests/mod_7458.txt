TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were acquired from the thoracic inlet to the symphysis pubis following oral and intravenous contrast.
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is an enlarged lymph node seen in the left axilla measuring 1.6 x 2.3 x 3.3 cm.
There are multiple tiny paraaortic lymph nodes seen, none of which meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, rectum and prostate are unremarkable in appearance.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Within the surgical bed, there are blood products which are intrinsically T1 hyperintense limiting evaluation for residual enhancing mass.
The surrounding edema is slightly increased compared with the prior study with minimal surrounding mass effect.
TECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain was performed utilizing sagittal and axial T1, axial T2, axial gradient, axial FLAIR and diffusion with ADC map sequences without intravenous contrast.
After the administration of intravenous contrast, axial T1 and sagittal MP-RAGE sequences were performed with coronal and axial MP-RAGE reconstructions.
Due to the hemorrhage within the surgical site, which is intrinsically T1 hyperintense, evaluation of residual enhancing mass in this region is limited.
Within the surgical bed, there are blood products which are intrinsically T1 hyperintense limiting evaluation for residual enhancing mass.
The surrounding edema is slightly increased compared with the prior study with minimal surrounding mass effect.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
He reports that he had a normal colonoscopy a few years ago and recently underwent a skin biopsy of neck lesion that was reportedly normal or basal cell.
He was initially taken to an OSH where head CT showed L frontal lesion with significant surrounding edema hence he was transferred here for further care after being loaded with Dilantin.
He was initially admitted to neurology service where MRI of head with and without contrast showed an enhancing 1.2cm solitary lesion in the L frontal lobe most concerning for melanoma.
CT torso also showed large L axillary lymph node which was biopsied per interventional radiology on [**2-1**].
He also underwent EEG during this admission which was normal as well.
On [**2-5**], on examination patient had RUE weakness 4/5, but was full strenght otherwise, he was alert and oriented to self and place and expressive aphasia persists.
