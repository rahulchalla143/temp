[**Month/Day/Year **] stress test to determine his functional capacity, d/t cardiologist concerned if his Parkinson's could be masking symptoms of aortic stenosis.
No EKG changes, but after 46 seconds his BP dropped from 110/70 to 98/70 and the test was stopped.
Echo did reveal severe aortic stenosis with a bicuspid valve.
Referred for cardiac cath to further evaluate.

Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 8 mm Hg and a mean PCWP of 10 mm Hg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.33 l/min/m2.
There was a severe aortic stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 45.89 mm Hg and a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.62 cm2.
Peripheral angiography demonstrated no right iliac disease.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Aortic graft noted in ascending aorta.
Remaining exam unchanged [**2162-3-4**] UE U/S: Grayscale and Doppler images of the left IJ, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins were performed.

Cardiac cath revealed severe aortic stenosis along with 2 vessel coronary artery disease and a dilated ascending aorta.
[**Date Range **] all pre-operative testing and was brought to the operating room on [**2162-3-3**].
Aorta Replacement, and Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 2.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
All left arm peripheral IV's and arterial line were removed, vascular surgery was consulted and an upper extremity ultrasound was performed.
Ultrasound was negative for DVT.
