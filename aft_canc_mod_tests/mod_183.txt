A computerized axial tomography scan showed a large area of edema in her central right posterior fossae likely representing a neoplasm; most likely metastasis from her lung cancer.
She was admitted for further workup of this new brain tumor.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed her temperature was 99.4, her blood pressure was 115/44, her heart rate was 96, respiratory rate was 24, and oxygen saturation was 100 percent on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Reflexes were 1 plus in her upper extremities and knees.
Sensory examination was intact to light touch/joint position/cold.
LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 8.9, her hematocrit was 35.4, and platelets were 416.
Sodium was 140.
Potassium was 4.2.
Creatine kinase was 328.
Prothrombin time was 13.1.
Calcium was 9.4.
Troponin was less than 0.01.
RADIOLOGY:  Again, a head computer tomography showed a 1.5-cm x 2-cm mass in the left cerebellum with surrounding and compression of the fourth and fifth ventricles.
Her neurologic signs were monitored every one hour.
A head computer tomography done postoperatively showed postoperative changes, but no active bleed.
Her vital signs were within normal limits.
She had a magnetic resonance imaging of her head that showed postoperative changes.
On the evening of [**10-30**], Ms. [**Known lastname 8631**] was transferred to the Neurology stepdown unit where she was monitored closely with every one hour neurologic and vital signs checks.
On [**10-27**], she had a computerized axial tomography scan which showed postoperative changes with slight improvement of her hydrocephalus.
On [**10-29**], she underwent a magnetic resonance imaging which showed a reduction in mass effect as a consequence of the resection of the cluster right cerebellar metastatic lesions; however, other supratentorial metastatic lesions were noted.
Regular insulin sliding scale as needed (to cover her    blood sugars while taking Decadron).
