HOSPITAL COURSE #pleural effusions/dyspnea - reaccumulation of pleural fluid in setting of known portal vein thrombosis with recurrent transudative ascites and pleural effusions.
We attempted to do an intraabdominal tracer study to prove hepatic hydrothorax, however the tracer was unintentionally injected into the bowel without any clinical consequences.
Renal, cardiac and liver disease were ruled out.
Finally MRI of the abdomen was done which showed a suspicious soft tissue mass in the resection bed.
Cardiology, interventional pulmonary and liver were all consulted, who all agreed that her orthostasis was due to severe hypovolemia, so she was uptitrated to max dose florinef, salt tabs and midodrine.
Still pt appears dry on exam and history c/w volume depletion (recent diarrhea and limited mobility/access to PO intake).
Her creatinine stabilized.
She also had large volumes of diarrhea due to her pancreatic enzyme deficiency s/p whipple.
#portal vein thrombosis - likely [**2-8**] hypercoagulability from malignancy.
Liver was consulted who felt that she should not have portal hypertension without cirrhosis, however her cirrhosis workup was negative and she has known Grade II esophageal varices.
Transitional Issues - Please continue to drain 500-1500cc of fluid from the pleurex catheter as needed for comfort.
