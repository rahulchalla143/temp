# Stage IV lung CA: On presentation, Mr. [**Known lastname 28145**] had an apical mass expanding, adrenal mass on CTA suspicious for metastasis and radicular symptoms in right arm likely [**1-3**] nerve compression but per Pain Clinic.
An MRI of the Spine revealed metastatic tumor cord compression at C7 to T3 with significant stenosis at T2.
The pneumonia was believed to be aspiration vs. CAP and sputum culture failed to identify a pathogen.
A PE was ruled out w/ CTA.
And a Bubble study and Echo did not further identifying cause of hypoxia.
Bx in [**2193**] -chronic viral hepatitis C with grade 2 inflammation and stage 2 fibrosis.
