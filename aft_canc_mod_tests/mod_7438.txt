She underwent an MRI (head), which was negative for recurrence.
She subsequently saw a neuromuscular neurologist for evaluation of persistent weakness, and was noted to have decreased power in the right leg with decreased sensation in the left leg, with no accurate sensory level.
An MRI of the C-spine and L-spine in addition to an XR of the thoracic spine were obtained.
The cervical spine MR [**First Name (Titles) 654**] [**Last Name (Titles) 104941**] and canal narrowing, but no cord impingement.
Past Medical History: thyroidectomy for cancer [**2183-8-29**]; uterine and transverse colon polypectomy for adenoma [**2183**]; basal cell carcinoma nasal bridge and left lower lip [**2188**]; GERD, hypothyroidism, hypertension.
While there is anterior displacement of the cord, the appearance of the cord is significantly improved compared to the preoperative study when it was significantly compressed.
Consider close followup to assess stability/progression and evaluation for any residual tumor.
Urine Culture [**4-3**] proteus mirabilis Urine Culture [**4-9**] pending at time of discharge       Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 104942**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] Neurosurgery on [**4-3**] for a conventional angiogram to assess vasculature surrounding her T7-8 lesion.
The angiogram showed no large feeders of the thoracic lesion and she was prepared for resection on [**4-4**].
She underwent a Cervical and Thoracic spine MRI on [**4-5**] which showed multiple ares of degenerative chnages without cord impingement and post-operative chnages.
Her Foley was removed on [**4-8**] and urinalysis was ordered as her urine was cloudy.
