CT Head: Moderate left maxillary sinus disease, but no acute intracranial process.
MRI is more sensitive for acute ischemia.

There was no evidence of intracranial pathology on CT Head.
An LP was not pursued given his low platelets and elevated INR from his underlying liver disease.
Lactulose and rifaximin were continued - this will be very important to take at the extended care facility to prevent confusion and a repeat of the events that led to this admission.
His CBC remained stable and there was low concern for ongoing bleeding into the hip .
