She was evaluated by the [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital **] clinic for SOB for which she describes that she has been on 2L of O2 since her recent discharge.
Labs in the ED were notable for K of 2.9, Cr 0.7, Cl 87, and HCO3 42.
She underwent thoracentesis of left pleural effusion in the ED of 1600mL revealing protein of 2.7, LDH 93 and glucose of 101 with 560 WBCs and 185 RBCs.
Vitals on transfer were T:96.9 HR:98 BP:140/66 RR:20 100% on BiPAP.
CT biopsy revealed small cell lung CA.
XRT [**1-3**] and chemotherapy on [**12-31**] and [**1-6**].

Pt required temporary MICU stay for BIPAP but was quickly weaned and satting well on 2-3L NC.
At this point s/p chemotherapy pt's counts began to nadir and her platelets were 28 so the pleurex placement was deferred.
Her lung exam had improved and the pleurex placement was deferred.
Pt diagnosed [**2184-12-27**] at [**Hospital3 **] hospital, thought to have pneumonia originally.
Pt will need CT scans for staging.
ANC was 50 from [**2185-1-16**]- [**2185-1-18**].
Cefepime  #Anorexia - Pt had c/o dysphagia, yeast found in sputum likely thrush and she was started on fluc for oral candidiasis.
#mucositis - in setting neutropenia pt developed severe mucositis and extremely decreased PO intake, see anorexia above.
Electrolytes were monitored and repleted prn.
[**Female First Name (un) 564**] on sputum culture and thought to be candidal esophagitis.
