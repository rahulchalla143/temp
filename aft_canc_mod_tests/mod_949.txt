Brief Hospital Course: 47 year old hx of NSCLC, progressing despite XRT and chemo, admitted in [**7-7**] for SBO, s/p lysis of adhesion with exploratory laparotomy.
He underwent bronchoscopy on [**7-8**] which showed normal airways, copious mucous in the LUL.
Received 2x plasma and 1x red cell transfusions [**7-8**].
The platelet count came back up after heparin was stopped suggesting direct toxic effect of heparin and not an aoutimmune-mediated effect.
Patient has positive sputum cultures for aspergillus but inconsistent CT and unlikely in the setting of only steroid induced immunosuppresion.
No need for diuresis right now as no signs of CHF and recent ECHO with good LV function.
Labs were checked regularly and electrolytes were repleted as needed.
