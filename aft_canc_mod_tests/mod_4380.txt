He reports having the same pain in past (see discharge summary [**2127-6-27**]) with extensive workup and no etiology found.
CT chest/abd with contrast done, no significant new findings.
CT torso showed an 8.9 x 8.4 cm mass in the upper pole of his right kidney with tumor thrombus extending into the right renal vein, IVC, and right iliac/femoral veins.
Core needle biopsy of  his left supraclavicular lymph node, demonstrated papillary carcinoma, consistent with metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma.
- [**2126-4-7**]: Follow up CT demonstrated interval increase in his retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, increase of the right adrenal mass and presence of his extensive tumor thrombus throughout the right renal vein and inferior IVC up to the confluence of the hepatitic veins.
- [**2126-4-29**]: Began cycle 1 of bevacizumab and temsirolimus per phase II protocol 08-184 - [**2126-6-21**]: Hospitalized with vomiting and pleuritic chest pain.
CT scan ruled out acute PE, showed overall stable disease and decreased size of the supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Bevacizumab was held due to ongoing anticoagulation.
- [**2126-8-19**] a CT scan torso performed after cycle #4 showed mixed behavior with overall decreased right renal mass bulk but stable and slight increased periaortic, retrocrural, mesenteric, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
- [**2126-12-10**] CT TORSO showed stable disease.

CTA CHEST / ABD /PELVIS [**8-27**]: 1.
ECHO [**8-29**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CXR [**9-1**]: INDICATION: Right-sided pleuritic chest pain.
These consolidations have also been documented on a CT examination from [**2127-8-27**].
CXR [**9-2**]: FINDINGS: Compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right-sided chest tube.
CXR [**9-3**]: Interval development of minimal pneumothorax on the right side since [**2127-9-2**].
CXR [**9-4**]: Interval development of minimal pneumothorax on the right side since [**2127-9-2**].
CXR [**9-5**]: Interval removal of a right pleural catheter with placement of a chest tube with its tip at the apex of the lung.
Left subclavian Port-A-Cath remains in place with its tip in the distal SVC.
CXR [**9-6**]: 1.
There continues to be a right apical pneumothorax which appears larger than on the previous study from 5:12 a.m.
CXR [**9-7**]: Right apical chest tube remains in place.
# R chest/RUQ pain: On admission, CT abd/chest showed no acute pathology apart from continued large tumor burden on right side.
He was noted to have had a similar presentation in [**Month (only) 116**], at which time etiology was not elucidated: no PE, negative cardiac enzymes and EKG, bedside swallow eval negative, bone scan negative, bronchoscopy [**2127-6-26**] was unremarkable, no organisms on gram-stain.
Given CT findings, current presentation was thought to be either chemo induced pneumonitis (with steroid benefit), or a possible infectious process in the lungs.
It was felt that the CT findings were consistent with his oncologic process, and that given his significant evaluation during the previous admission for the same complaints, that it appears safe to initiate a trial of steroids.
52 year old male with metastatic RCC, PTX [**3-12**] cavitary lung lesion s/p chest tube, transferred to the ICU with worsening tachypnea and O2 says, pleuritic chest/abd pain and new right lung infiltrates on CXR.
CXR also showed new right middle and lower lobe infiltrates w/known cavitating R lung lesion (per prior CT), which likely contributed to his increased O2 requirement, as they have not been treated up to this point.
BAL fluid and pleural fluid were collected during the procedure and sent for culture and studies - they eventually grew coag+ staph.
His O2 Sats remained stable, PTX improved, and he looked clinically improved.
However, over the next two days the patient developed an increasing O2 requirement to maximum high-flow oxygen, and serial CXRs showed worsening loculated empyema, with thick purulent drainage from the chest tube.
Transient fluid-responsive hypotension and decreased urine output were thought to be manifestations of sepsis secondary to the complicated pulmonary infection.
As patient was unable to take much PO, heceived maintenance IVF + boluses as needed for SBP <85.
Home dose warfarin 5 mg daily on Mo/We/Fr/Sa, 7.5 mg daily on Tu/Th/[**Doctor First Name **], recently restarted this hospitalization; this was held and, in addition, he received 2U FFP to reverse INR 3.9 prior to placement of chest tube and PICC line.
The acute rise in his creatinine are likely pre-renal secondary to decreased intake from pain, but could also be ATN [**3-12**] hypotension or post-renal.
Urine output was low.
Labs showed hyponatremia with low urinary sodium, suggesting dehydration.
Monitored exam for effusion.
# Abdominal pain: Exam worsened early in admission, but we suspected that pleuritic pain was responsible.
Exam without rebound, only mild guarding.
