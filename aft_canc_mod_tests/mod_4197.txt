Hypodensities in the left basal ganglia are compatible with prior lacunar infarcts.
The abdominal aorta and its major branches are patent, with mild atherosclerotic calcification.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The sigmoid colon demonstrates scattered diverticulosis, without diverticulitis.
Liver U/S FINDINGS: Grayscale, color, and pulse Doppler evaluation of the liver was performed.
The imaging features are compatible with a hemangioma.
Limited evaluation of the pancreas.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1274**] is an 84 year old male with PMH significant for diabetes and hyperlipidemia that presents to the ED from an OSH after a syncopal episode, found to be in complete heart block, s/p asystolic arrest x3 currently intubated in the CCU.
# Asystolic arrest/Complete heart block: Upon arrival to the scene in the field (minor MVA), it is documented that his rhythm showed NSR with occassional PVCs and a rate of 92.
On admission to the OSH, he was believed to have been in Mobitz type 2 or type 3 heart block with a rate in the 30s.
He was mentating fine with normal BP and HR in the 30-40s while in our ED.
He had an echo done on [**9-25**] that showed regional left ventricular dysfunction that was consistent with CAD.
# MVA: Pt in MVA on day of admission, trauma work-up was done in the ED, where he his only complaint was of back pain that was new from the accident.
His imaging studies showed a fracture in L1.
