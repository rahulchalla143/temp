CXR on admission demonstrated trace left pleural effusion, but no pneumonia.
On discharge, patient remained afebrile with WBC count trending down and with O2 sats in high 90s on room air.
Chest X-ray showed fluid around the lung on the left side, but no definite pneumonia.
Lab tests on your blood showed that you were dehydrated.
The lab tests showing dehydration also improved after receiving the IV fluids.
Because your breathing improved so quickly and your chest X-ray did not show anything concerning for pneumonia, you will not need to continue antibiotics after discharge.
