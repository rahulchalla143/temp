Human immunodeficiency virus positive times 15 years (on highly active antiretroviral therapy).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed the patient's temperature was 97, heart rate was 129, blood pressure was 147/84, respiratory rate was 18, oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Pulmonary examination revealed clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed the patient was tachycardic, but regular.
Upper extremity pulses were 2+ and symmetric.
Mental status examination revealed the patient was fully alert and oriented.
Cranial nerve examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light at 3 mm.
The remainder of cranial nerve examination was unremarkable.
Deep tendon reflexes were symmetric but absent at the ankles bilaterally.
Sensory examination revealed decrease to soft tissue and pinprick up to the T6 level.
Finger-to-nose and rapid alternating movements were intact.
The magnetic resonance imaging showed degenerative joint disease at the L5-S1 level.
Otherwise, the patient's cervical and lumbar spine were unremarkable.
The Oncology staff recommended further staging including a gallium scan, computed tomography scan of the torso, bowel movement, and lumbar puncture.
A lumbar puncture was performed showing 1 white blood cells, 3 red blood cells, protein of 29, glucose of 69, LDH of 12.
Differential showed 30% polys, 62% lymphocytes, 10% monocytes; otherwise unremarkable.
The patient's hematocrit on [**2-22**] was 24.5; and on [**2-23**] had fallen to 17.9.
The patient received an additional transfusion to keep his hematocrit greater than 30% and was started on high-dose proton pump inhibitor.
An arteriogram of the superior mesenteric artery, superior mesenteric artery, and three jejunal branches, celiac and internal mammary artery inferior mesenteric artery were without evidence of active bleeding.
The patient's hematocrit did not bump appropriately to the packed red blood cell infusion.
However, the patient's hematocrit continued to tend downward from a post procedure hematocrit of 28 to a hematocrit of 21 with large bloody bowel movements.
The patient was taken back for a tagged red blood cell scan which showed an active bleed in the jejunal branch.
The patient's hematocrit still continued to trend downward and inappropriately bump.
The patient received a computed tomography scan of the abdomen.
Impression revealed (1) free intraperitoneal fluid and (2) small bilateral pleural effusions.
At this point, General Surgery took the patient to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy with jejunal resection and primary anastomosis.
A 6-cm portion of the jejunum showed no discrete raised lesions, although several small mucosal ulceration specimens were sent to Pathology.
The patient was transfused an additional 2 units of packed red blood cells postoperatively, and his serial hematocrit levels for the remainder of hospital course remained stable.
Left ventricular ejection fraction was greater than 55%.
Pathology of intestinal segment showed multiple fossae mucosal hemorrhage and necrosis with erosions.
His hematocrit levels remained stable.
The patient was sent for an emergent magnetic resonance imaging which showed no significant change from the interval.
The magnetic resonance imaging was reviewed by Neurosurgery and was without evidence of any recurrent or residual epidural tumor.
Hepatitis C. 7.
