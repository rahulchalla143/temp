The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
[**2142-3-10**] CTA head/neck IMPRESSION:  Mild plaquing at bilateral carotid bifurcations in the neck.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Rapid increase in size of the pseudoaneurysm noted arising from the arch of  the aorta, today measuring 4.6 x 5.4 x 4.5 cm, previously 3.8 x 3.5 x 3.1 cm  n [**2141-3-7**] on OSH CT.  2.
[**2142-3-11**] Intra-op TEE: Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The remaining exam is unchanged.
[**2142-3-30**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION: Minimal decrease in size in an air- and fluid-containing thick-walled paramediastinal space at the site of prior pseudoaneurysm, this is as before inseparable from the aortic graft and concerning for infection with abscess formation.Right pneumonia, minimally improved.

COMPARISON: Comparison is made to CT chest performed [**2142-3-30**].
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the pelvic outlet.
Prominent lymph nodes are identified in the left paratracheal space; however, these do not meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement (2:23, 601B:28).
Overall, collection is stable in size compared to prior study measuring 4.2 x 2.3 cm compared to 4.2 x 2.4 cm on the prior study.
The infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measures 3.2 x 3.1 in transverse diameter, stable compared to [**2142-3-10**], CT torso.
Likely postoperative fluid collection given negative prior biopsy and culture though cannot exclude superimposed infectious process.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Chest CT [**2142-4-8**] Final Report INDICATION: 65-year-old male status post aortic repair and tracheostomy, now with desaturations.
TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images through the chest were acquired before and after administration of intravenous contrast.
The left para-aortic fluid and air collection contains more air compared to prior and is similar in size measuring 4.3 x 2.1 cm.
This study is not optimized for evaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Bronchocoscopy revealed copious secretions on the left.
Bronchoscopy yielded very thick secretions and blood clots from the right lower lobe.
Diarrhea continued and numerous cultures were sent for C Diff toxin, which were all negative.
