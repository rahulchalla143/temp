He demonstrated wheezes on chest exam with poor pair movement consistent with an obstructive etiology.
He had negative cardiac enzymes x 3, and no evidence of fluid overload on CXR.
The patient showed improved ABG on ventilator, with a blood gas that was believed to be consistent with his baseline of CO2 retention.
Invectious etiology, and more specifically viral cause, was believed to be the inciting factor to his COPD exacerbation.
CXR showed no frank infiltrates, sputum Cx showed no growth, and the patient was DFA negative.
Patient began to show evidence of fluid overload on exam and CXR, and was diuresed with resolution.
