Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Metastatic jejunal adenoCA HTN DM2 HLD  ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - Early [**2189**]: Began experiencing vague abdominal discomfort, bloating, intermittent nausea/vomiting, and weight loss from poor PO intake.
- [**2189-3-21**]: Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for SBO after MR enterography revealed dilatation of the proximal small bowel with a transition point in the mid-jejunum.
- [**2189-3-22**]:  Underwent exploratory laparotomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Pathology revealed a 2.7 cm x 2.1 cm x 1.1 cm poorly-differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis propria into the subserosa (pT3).
One of the lymph nodes demonstrated focal extracapsular extension of the tumor.
KRAS G12V mutation confirmed; IHC for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 were intact; Microsatellite stable (MSS).
- [**2188-4-29**]: Began cycle 1 of modified FOLFOX6, however CEA noted to be quickly rising so no further treatment was given at the time.
PET CT showed questionable increased uptake in portal lymph node.
- [**2189-6-9**]: Underwent repeat laparotomy to evaluate rising CEA for possible wide excision of small bowel mesentery.

CT Head ([**2190-5-16**]): No acute intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
CT Chest ([**2190-5-16**]):  IMPRESSION: Extensive pulmonary emboli involving all lobes with a saddle embolus across the main PA with signs of right heart [**Year (4 digits) 16089**].
ECHO [**2190-5-17**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
ECHO [**2190-5-18**]: The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-5-17**], the right ventricular overload is now improved although the right ventricle is still hypokinetic.
