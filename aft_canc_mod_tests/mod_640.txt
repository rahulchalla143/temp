Her tox screen on admission was positive for opiates, cocaine, benzos, and marijuana.
The likely cause of her hypotension was septic shock; imaging showed a multifocal pneumonia.
The patient has been weaned to Pressure Support with an FiO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 5.
Head CT demonstrated a left tempral gyrus contusion/shear injury of 7mm, representing a likely old concussion.
Other contributors may include a recent hypernatremia (to 153), which is thought to be secondary to decreased free water.
CT of chest and abdomen showed multifocal pneumonia, cholelithiasis with stones in CBD and near cystic duct.
The patient's total bili is 2.8 and has been trending upward.
b. ARF: Creatinine has normalized now.
c. Cirrhosis: INR and PTT up.

IMAGING / STUDIES: From [**Hospital1 2025**]: [**2125-2-6**] CT chest: Multifocal areas of consolidation, including inferior portion of RUL, the RML, and both LLs consistent with massive aspiration or multifocal pneumonia.
[**2125-2-6**] CT abd/pelvis: Cholelithiasis and stones in the cystic duct.
[**2-7**] CT head: Punctate 7-mm hyperdense focus within the left middle temporal gyrus concerning for contusion or shear injury.
# CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ([**2125-2-9**] at 2:30 PM): FINDINGS: The heart is normal in size.
Although the study was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, images of the upper abdomen demonstrate new intra-abdominal ascites and stable splenomegaly.
Hepatic echotexture suggestive of hepatitis 3.
# TTE ([**2125-2-13**] at 10:11:42 AM): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
# MRCP ([**2125-2-14**] at 8:49 PM): FINDINGS: There is large ascites, markedly increased from the prior CT and ultrasound studies, which slightly degrades image quality.
Upper abdominal lymphadenopathy, including retroperitoneal, is also redemonstrated and unchanged.
Noted only on the localizer images are a Foley, rectal tube and right hip prosthesis.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations provided multiple perspectives for this examination (689).
Large ascites, markedly increased from recent CT and ultrasound studies.
# MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ([**2125-2-15**] at 3:25 PM): FINDINGS: The study is limited due to patient motion-related artifacts.
On the axial FLAIR sequence, evaluation for focal lesions is limited due to artifacts.
The ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are mildly prominent, likely related to mild volume loss.
Mucosal thickening, fluid/both, diffusely in the mastoid air cells, left more than right, to correlate with clinical examination.
# Neurophysiology Report EMG Study ([**2125-2-16**]): FINDINGS: Left median motor nerve conduction study showed moderately prolonged distal latency and severely reduced distal response amplitude.
Left ulnar motor nerve conduction study showed normal distal latency, severely reduced response amplitudes, and normal conduction velocities.
Left deep peroneal motor nerve conduction study showed moderately-to-severely prolonged distal latency, severely reduced response amplitudes, and normal conduction velocities.
Left tibial motor nerve conduction study showed normal distal latency and mildly reduced response amplitude.
Left radial sensory nerve conduction study was normal.
Left sural sensory nerve conduction study was normal.
EMG of the left biceps and abductor pollicis brevis showed no motor unit activity and moderate active denervation.
EMG of the left tibialis anterior, gastrocenemius, and vastus lateralis showed no motor unit activity.
In addition, the poor activation observed on needle electromyography is suggestive of superimposed central dysfunction.
# MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST ([**2125-2-16**] at 10:24 PM): FINDINGS: From C2-3 to T3-4 level, there is no evidence of abnormal signal within the vertebral bodies and discs to indicate discitis or osteomyelitis.
IMPRESSION: Cervical spine MRI obtained without contrast demonstrates no evidence of intraspinal or paravertebral fluid collection or abscess.
# MRV HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2125-2-16**] at 10:17 PM): FINDINGS: The MRV of the head demonstrates normal flow in the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses best visualized on the source images.
The review of the previous MRI of the brain demonstrates no evidence of filling defect on post-gadolinium images.
MCRP [**2125-3-4**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
EEG [**2125-3-6**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of a poorly organized mixed theta and delta frequency background which represents a moderate to severe encephalopathy.
Mini-BAL respiratory cultures colected on [**2125-2-11**] grew Stenotrophomonas, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
She was started on Bactrim IV and later switched to an equivalent Bactrim PO dose for coverage of the Stenotrophomonas, which was found to be Bactrim sensitive.
Her liver function continued to deteriorate (see below) and so liver recommended starting vancomycin and zosyn [**2125-3-7**] in the setting of her continued deterioration from a hepatic stand point, which was done.
She had speech and swallow come to evaluate her, was tried on a passe-muir valve and did very well, was able to have a full conversation.
However, her mental status became significantly worse in the setting of liver failure, and her O2 sats began to drop.
# Liver failure: Patient has a history of hepatitis C, and recent abdominal imaging showed ascites, splenomegaly, and varices suggesting significant portal hypertension.
Her anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely also due to cirrhosis and hypersplenism.
Her AST and ALT continued to elevate until [**3-2**], when AST reached began to finally trend down after a peak on 665 on [**3-1**], and ALT reached a peak on [**3-3**] of 432.
As pt's TBili continued to trend up to a high of 15.2 the day she passed away, and her INR continued to trend up to 7.2 on [**3-7**] (after which she was given FFP and vitamin K), it was felt that her transaminase peak reflected her liver burning out and her synthetic function was continuing to worsen and lag behind.
Therefore, we controlled her pain with 5mg oxycodone Q4H PRN and continued to monitor her amylase and lipase, which peaked on [**3-7**], and then trended down.
MRI spine was unconcerning.
Her CK was noted to be very elevated on [**2-27**] to 1827, and then trended down afterwards.
MRI head was unrevealing.
EEG showed "abnormal continuous EEG due to the presence of a disorganized [**5-29**] Hz theta rhythm background with absence of normal sleep architecture.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Her creatinine was 1.5 on admission with a FENa of 0.44% suggestive of pre-renal failure.
Her creatinine improved to 1.0 with hydration and BP support.
She remained edematous and had a bump in her creatinine from 1.0 to 1.3 to 1.7, peaking on [**2125-2-22**].
Her creatinine subsequently improved back to 1.0 after several days and remained stable afterwards despite aggressive diuresis with lasix.
