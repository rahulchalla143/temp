Since that time he has continued to diurese slowly with lasix IV, with slow improvement in his CHF on exam and CXR.
He has remained stable, with SBP 90-115 and O2 sats 95-98% on 2L.
He was seen by the electrophysiology service, who recommend VT ablation, followed by placement of a biventricular pacer, at some point in the near future after his acute issues have resolved (especially his current infections).
Troponins were briefly elevated to 0.14 immediately after his MICU course, but this was felt to be due to severe CHF and his concurrent renal insufficiency at that time.
2) Respiratory - His saturations have remained stable during his stay.
On [**8-3**] he developed fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress (RR 40), and on transfer to the MICU was felt to have a pneumonia on CXR (presumed due to aspiration).
He has since had no respiratory distress, and his lung exam and O2 sats have improved to the high 90s on 2L.
HIT antibodies were subsequently negative x2, his platelets have recovered to >150, and he resumed a heparin drip for anticoagulation for Afib when he returned to the floor after the MICU on [**8-8**].
Since his return to the floor, his INR has slowly fallen to 1.3, and his PTT has returned to therapeutic levels on a heparin drip.
All blood cultures have been negative during his stay, except one bottle growing coag-negative staph (felt to be a contaminant).
Urine culture is negative as of [**8-13**].
C. diff assay was negative on [**8-13**].
He had a head CT during a period of acute confusion that showed no acute changes, mass effect, or bleed.
Ammonia, B12, and folate levels were normal at discharge.
)prophylaxis - protonix, heparin  10.
Please check PTT q 6h until heparin dose is completely stable with goal 60-80.
Please check INR on [**8-19**], goal 2.0-3.0.
Please check potassium level on [**8-18**].
