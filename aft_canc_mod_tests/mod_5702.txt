Regarding her fevers, temperatures reported to be in the 101 region intermittingly for about last 2 weeks.

The patient was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation .
An ECHO was performed which failed to show evidence of heart failure (EF 55%), but did confirm trivial pericardial effussion as well as possible small PFO.

A few microbubbles are seen in the left heart very late after intravenous injection c/w transpulmonic passage (small PFO cannot be fully excluded, but less likely).
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[**8-19**] BILATERAL LENIS: Grayscale, color, and pulse Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] imaging was performed of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, peroneal and posterior tibial veins.
[**8-23**] CT NECK, THORAX, ABDOMEN, PELVIS: CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There are multiple bilateral supraclavicular nodes, the largest on the left, measuring 16 x 16 mm (3:10).
CT ABDOMEN: The liver is normal in appearance without focal liver lesion.
CT PELVIS: There is apparent thickening of the cecal tip, which is of doubtful significance (3:105).
CT torso showed likely lymphangitic spread rather than pneumonia.
EGFR testing was never sent per decision of initial oncology evaluation team and the fact that there was not enough tissue in the initial cell block.
# Possible Healthcare Associated Pneumonia:  Upon admission, patient had a CT scan from the outside hospital which was concerning for multifocal, bilateral pneumonia.
However, after repeat CT and the discovery of adenocarcinoma in the pleural fluid, the thought was that this may actually be lymphangitic spread of adenocarcinoma.
A video swallow was performed to rule out aspiration as a cause of pneumonia.
Sputum, pleural fluid, and blood cultures as well as respiratory viral panels have been negative.
# Hypoxia: Her saturations remained chronically 90-93% on 6L nasal cannula and 100% by facemask during the first parts of her admission.
Furosemide IV helps some, however, she does not have much room in her blood pressure to titrate this and it is not proven to be effective in malignancy.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management of ongoing hypoxia with oncology and interventional pulmonology following.
Initial thoracentesis performed [**8-19**] removed 1200 ml fluid, however, effusions reaccumulated quickly.
# Borderline hypotension and tachycardia: During admission, she was persistently with systolic blood pressures 90s-100s.
# Osteoporosis: Continued Vitamin D and calcium supplementation.
No masses seen on CT neck to explain source of adenocarcinoma.
