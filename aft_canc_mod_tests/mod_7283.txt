There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Her hospital course as follows by problems:  Partial SBO: Presented with obstructive symptoms and evidence of narrowing of a 12-15 cm segment of the ileum on CT and MRE.
Given history of UC, she was started on empiric IV Solu-Medrol as the patient was not amenable to endoscopic evaluation with sampling of this area.
Single balloon retrospective enteroscopy was planned for tissue biopsy for diagnosis; however, the patient was unable to tolerate PO for prep and was sent for surgical management.
She was taken to the operating room on [**2162-8-20**] for exploratory laparoscopy with lap assisted small bowel resection.
Her TSH  was normal and LENI's were negative.
Further dropped to SBP 60 with beta blockade and was transferred to the MICU.
Once her blood pressures stabilize this should be restarted.
Her Lopressor was increased to 50mg tid and her heart rates have ranged in the 90's.
Anticoagulation was recommended by Cardiology once able to take po's but the decision was made to have her follow up with her PCP after discharge from rehab for further evaluation of initiating this.
Hypoxia: Known right sided heart failure on nocturnal O2 that was exacerbated by volume resuscitation .During her hospital stay she required continuous oxygen therapy to maintain her saturations >93%  Anemia: She was followed by Hematology during her stay who recommended  B12 and iron supplementation once taking po's.
Post transfusion hematocrit was 27.6 and on day of discharge it was 26.3.
Right sided heart failure: Diuretics and antihypertensives were held initially given hypotension.
Her home dose Lasix was restarted and her electrolytes followed closely and repleted as needed.
Serial EKG's were followed and she was continued on an aspirin, beta blocker and statin.
TraMADOL (Ultram) 50 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain 10.
Fluticasone-Salmeterol Diskus (100/50) 1 INH IH [**Hospital1 **] 12.
OxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  5-10 mg PO Q3H:PRN pain 21.
Biopsies of the intestinal tissue were taken at the time and you were found to have a tumor that will need further evalution by the Hematology/Oncology doctors.
