On Wed she went to see her new PCP,  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 92442**] [**Name (STitle) 92443**], due to change insurance coverage, who obtained a CXR at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] which showed RML infiltrate and she was started on moxifloxin.
She denies having any fever or chills at the time and her cough seems to be improving on tessalon pearls and guaifenasine-codeine.
Her SOB has been stable at home for the last several days until today when she was off the oxygen for ~ 2hours while travelling to see her doctor.

BUN of 7/creat of 0.4.
Her D.dimer of 0.8 (normal range of 0-0.49), so she had a CTA earlier in the day which showed no PE but a lung tumor pressing on right bronchial and pulmonary artery (prelim report).
Her O2 sats remained in the low 90s on 4L N/C.
Baseline SOB on home O2 at 2L N/c, + non-productive cough which is improving over the last few days with meds.
A core biopsy was nondiagnostic.
[**2170-4-28**] she had an excisional biopsy performed.
There was DCIS as well but the margins were negative for both invasive and in-situ cancer.
A single sentinel LN was identified and this was positive for a metastases measuring 4 mm.
-[**6-1**] She had a completion axillary dissection which showed that 12 additional axillary LN were negative.
Her initial O2 sat was 77% on RA.
She had a Chest CT on [**2178-1-9**] which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
An MRI of the abdomen on [**2178-1-13**] showed bilateral adrenal adenoma and focal fatty infiltration of the medial segment of the left lobe of the liver adjacent to the falciform ligament.
-[**2178-1-30**] She had a repeat chest CT at [**Location (un) 2274**]: IMPRESSION: Significant improved aeration throughout all lung zones.
The cancer was positive for CK7, EMA and CEA and negative for ER, mammoglobin, CK 20, CD 10, S100, TTF-1, vimentin, RCC, PAX 8 andp63.
Differential dx was either lung or breast cancer by morphology -[**2178-11-13**] CT scan of the head was negative.
Chest CT showed extensive mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy.
Abdomen/pelvic CT showed no liver metastases.
Prior CT scans showed a 2.4 cm right adrenal nodule and this was without change.
There are several SQ nodules: there is a 3.1 cm cavity containing an air-fluid level a the site of the biopsy (this area was included in the chest CT from [**2-7**] and was new).

Her OSH CTA was reviewed by the Pulmonary attending and felt more consistent with tumor burden causing lung collapse and compression.
CTA from the OSH, preliminarily, remains negative for pulmonary emboli.
