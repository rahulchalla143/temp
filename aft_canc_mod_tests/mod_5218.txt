During her initial presentation in [**State 1727**] in [**7-21**] her WBC was 19k, she had blood culture from the [**7-21**] and from [**7-22**] that grew clostritium.
She was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and concern for sepsis.
She remained afebrile and her vitals remained stable with SBP in 110s-120s/50s-60s, HR in 60s.
She also had increase in INR from 1.6->2.2.
Her lactate was elevated and this was thought to possibly be due to hypovolemia and dehydration, since it had been trending down with IV fluids.
Last + blood culture was on [**8-26**] prior to starting antibiotics.
However given that pt had metastatic colon cancer to liver and peritoneum pt could have GN infection.
