CT Head w/o contrast ([**2187-10-24**]) 1.
MRI Brain ([**2187-10-25**]) There are multiple masses located in the brain that have characteristics consistent with multiple hemorrhagic metastases.
There was concern that hypertension might exacerbate the intracranial bleeding, and thus her SBP was tightly controlled to maintain SBP <160.
She will undergo a series of 10 radiation treatments in total.
Her dilantin has been uptitrated to therapeutic serum levels at a dose of 200 mg twice daily.
Her Keppra should be increased from the current dose of 750 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 750 mg QAM and 1000 mg QPM (on [**11-1**]).
Although she arrived at the hospital on anticoagulation with a therapeutic INR of 2.2, there was significant concern that her anticoagulation would worsen the brain parenchymal bleeding.
We sent for an amylase that came back at 844.
Hydralazine was used as needed to keep her SBP <160.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or T > 100.4.
