A CT scan revealed a large intra-abdominal mass with CT-guided biopsy on [**2127-4-4**] confirming a high-grade peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
By immunohistochemistry, the cells were strongly immunoreactive for CD45 and expressed pan T-cell markers of CD3, CD5, and CD2,  but are negative for CD7.
Unfortunately, this was complicated by readmission due to fever and she was noted for positive blood cultures with streptococcus pneumoniae  bacteremia.
CT scan of the chest on [**2127-5-12**] with notable for  ill-defined nodules in the bronchioles and lower lobes as well as bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli with possible tricuspid  valve vegetation.
Subsequent TTE on [**2127-5-13**] confirmed a large  1.7 cm long x 0.7 cm wide mobile echogenic mass on the tricuspid  valve.
