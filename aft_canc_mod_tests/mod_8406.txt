[**5-12**] CTA head- 1)  Large left middle cerebral artery territory infarct, with occlusion of the left internal carotid artery from just above the carotid bifurcation to and throughout the left middle cerebral artery.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Repeat CT scan on [**5-13**] showed evolving left MCA infarct, small vessel disease and chronic left parietoccipital infarct.
CTA revealed a distal left ICA thrombus that extended in the M1 segment of the left MCA.
Her exam did not improve after tPA and she remained unresponsive with with flacid right hemiparesis.
Per daughter the patient had been on coumadin in the past and repeat TTE revealed an apical aneurysm with telemetry no revealing any atrial fibrillation.
