Labs were notable for hematocrit of 26.5 (up from 22.5 at [**Hospital3 26615**] prior to the blood transfusion), with INR 1.1 and normal platelets.
White count was 5.9 with 14% bandemia.
The patient was bolused with 2L of intravenous saline for systolic blood pressure in the 80s.
Vitals at time of admission were BP 83/47, RR 24, HR 83, saturation 98% RA.

CXR ([**2161-12-6**]): Small bilateral pleural effusions with moderate cardiomegaly.
# Sepsis: The patient presented with hypotension, fevers, and a bandemia of 14%, lactate of 2.4 and acute renal failure which were all consistent with sepis.
White count bumped from 5.9 to 20.2 the day of admission.
A CXR was performed that did not show a pneumonia.
Blood and urine cultures were performed.
Intravenous fluids were provided to maintain a MAP > 60 mm Hg.
Vancomycin and Zosyn were started empirically for broad coverage initially while blood and urine cultures were awaiting return.
As cultures remained negative throughout the hospitalization, her antibiotics were discontinued on [**2161-12-8**].
Hematocrits were monitored closely with a transfusion goal of maintaining her hematocrit of 25 and she was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells on [**2161-12-8**].
# Metastatic Ovarian Cancer: Patient had known metastatic ovarian cancer with spread to the bladder and bilateral ureters, as described on imaging from [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital.
As well, her metoprolol and nitrate were held due to her hypotension at time of admission.
