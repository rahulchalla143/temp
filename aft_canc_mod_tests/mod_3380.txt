In the ED his inital vitals signs were T 103.6 HR 147 BP 133/76 RR 20 O2 100%RA.
Blood and urine cultures were collected.
Orthopedics was consulted who recommended CT pelvis that showed replacement of normal gluteal musculature with tumor with some evidence of necrosis but no abscess.
[**4-12**] Blood culture bottles returned positive within 24h for Group A strep, and antibiotics were changed to Ceftriaxone 2g IV q24h.
Seen by ortho in [**1-/2136**] given persistent pain; x-ray and AP and lateral views of the femur revealed a radiolucent lesion in the left proximal femur with cortical scalloping, no evidence of fracture.
An MRI of the whole femur revealed a marrow  replacing process which extended from the femoral neck, but not crossing the old physeal scar down to the junction of the middle and distal thirds of the femur.
At the time of his evaluation, he also had a chest CT done that revealed a right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
He underwent a CT-guided biopsy of the femur that did reveal chondrosarcoma.
In [**11/2136**], he went on to have wedge resections of his pulmonary metastases.
He had a CT-guided biopsy done here, which confirmed chondrosarcoma in [**3-16**].

CXR [**2137-4-28**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process .
Pelvic CT [**2137-4-29**]: Markedly abnormal appearance of the left gluteal musculature, similar in size and extent to PET CT of [**2137-4-12**].
Echocardiogram [**2137-4-30**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Chest CTA [**2137-5-2**]: The pulmonary arteries opacify thoroughly without evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Respiratory motion limits the evaluation of pulmonary parenchyma slightly, however, in the presence of previously resected nodules there are postoperative changes, and a new focal nodular opacity in the left lower lobe measuring 7 mm (6, 88), which was not present on prior study.
Within the right lobe of the liver near the dome, there appears to be an hyperechoic ill-defined area measuring approximately 3.9 x 1.8 x 1.7 cm.
A linear hyperechoic structure is identified extending beyond the margin of the liver and this suggests that this entire lesion may be artifactual and secondary to suture line seen at the right lung base.
The right kidney measures 11.8 cm and the left kidney measures 10.1 cm.
# Group A Strep bacteremia: with multiple bottles of group A strep.
Surveillance blood cultures were to be drawn after the end of the antibiotic.
a CTA of the chest was negative for PE.
His TSH was 5.2. .
A RUQ ultrasound showed no biliary obstruction.
After the discontinuation of ceftriaxone and initiation of penicillin once blood culture sensitivity came back, his LFTs trended down again.
