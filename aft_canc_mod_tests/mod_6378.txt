Initial labs were hct 24 and platelet 14.
He was disoriented for two hours afterward according to his family, and a head CT was performed after insistence from his [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] her report.
His platelets were 42.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In the ED initial vital signs were 98.6 98 126/63 19 98%ra.
Neurosurgery was consulted and a repeat head CT demonstrated mild progression of his SDH.
His exam was notable for word finding difficulties but he was otherwise non-localizing neurologically.
Exam was positive for maroon stool in rectum and labs demonstrated hct 22; he was transfused two units of PRBC and GI was notified.
He also had pelvis plain films and CT c-spine that were negative for fracture by prelim.

Imaging: [**7-27**] CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST No fracture.
[**7-27**] CT Head w/o contrast Small bilateral acute subdural hematomas, left greater than right, measuring up to 3 mm in maximum thickness.
[**7-29**] CT Head w/o contrast Increased size of bilateral subdural hematomas, specifically with increase in the hyperdense components, reflecting acute hemorrhage.
[**2136-8-1**]: CT head w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: No appreciable interval change in the size of subdural hematomas, without evidence of new hemorrhage.

CT head demonstrated small bilateral SDH and he was evaluated by neursurgery who recommended supportive care and platelet goal >80.
There was no evidence of GI bleeding while on the floor, though he did require intermittent plt and blood transfusions to maintain goals set by neurosurgery.
Serial CT scans showed relative stability of SDH and fever curve trended down though pt remained delirious.
