Hct was 33 on discharge now back to 27.
EKG with old RBBB, but clear new lateral ST depressions and ST elevation in III.
First set of cardiac enzymes were CK 333 MB 11.8 TnT 1.13.
Patient presented hypotensive to low 80s, but now 95-100 with fluid; HR 90s.
Is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In the ED, the patient remained with stable blood pressures, dropping only as low as 102 systolic.
His initial vitals were 98.7 102/70 20 96%4L.
An EKG was rechecked which confirmed the initial findings, and another troponin was 1.12.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: O: Vital signs: 96.9/96.1, 108/60 (96-115/50-71), 85 (80-92), 18, 96%RA I/O: 1240/1350 +BM Tele: PVCs GEN: Resting quietly in bed, pleasant.
JVP appears mildly elevated, unchaged at 8-10cm.
Radial pulses symmetric and 2+.
PULM: URI congestion, but moving air in both lung fields, clear to auscultation.

Echo demonstrated EF of 25-30% with severe global LV hypokinesis.
His BP remained SBP 90-110.
He developed volume overload from blood transfusions and volume resuscitation for his hypotension at admission and was gently diuresed.
Hematocrit was 37.4 to OSH initially, underwent an EGD and a colonoscopy.
Colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis and incidental tiny polyp, otherwise, it was normal with no evidence of active colitis or bleeding.
He then underwent an EGD which revealed Barrett's esophagus, but no evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
His hematocrit drifted down to a nadir of 28 during his stay at the OSH and was stable at 33 prior to discharge.
Upon this presentation, with a HCT of 27 and active cardiac ischemia he was transfused 2 units of blood and subsequetly maintained stable blood counts.
# HTN - Systolic blood pressure after the MI ranged 90-110s.
Appeared vol overloaded on exam based on peripheral edema, elevated JVP, and cephalization/ small pleural effusions from CXR on [**5-27**].
Urine electrolytes showed he is salt avid (FeNa = 0.1%); likely hypervolemic hyponatremia from CHF and possibly SIADH from stress of hospitalization.
Fluid restriction to 1.5L/day.
Weight upon discharge 77 KG.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a heart attack and low blood pressures.
