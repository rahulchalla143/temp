PLEURAL FLUID CYTOLOGY: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
ECHO ([**10-24**]): The left atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-10-17**], a septal "bounce" is seen on the current study.
CT chest s contrast: 1.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and left sided filling pressures, with equalization of RA, RV, PCWP, and pericardial pressures (RA mean 19 mm Hg, RVEDP 21 mm Hg, PCWP mean 22 mm Hg, and pericardial pressure 20 mm Hg).
The cardiac index was normal (2.7 l/min/m2).
CXR ([**10-23**]): IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-11**] through 26:  Right lung is clear.
Had an echo and CTA which showed a left pleural effusion & a small pericardial effusion w/ possible diastolic dysfunction.
CT of chest shows worsening pleural effusion and pericardial effusion, etiology unknown.
TTE showed evidence of tamponade w/ RV diastolic collapse.
- Repeat TTE in [**4-1**] weeks to reassess pericardial fluid.
Since INR 4.3 on discharge, temporarily holding.
Note that since patient is on amiodarone will likely need less dose of warfarin to reach therapeutic INR -- titrate to INR 2.0 - 3.0.
- Note that patient's discharge meds do not presently include warfarin because her INR was supratherapeutic on day of discharge.
# CAD: No signs of ischemia on EKG or CEZ.
TSH pending today to assess now amiodarone load complete.
