She had a head CT, which showed right lateral CP angle mass measuring about 4.8 x 4.7 cm.
An MRI confirmed this mass also.

The imaging findings are most consistent with a large meningioma.
A contrast-enhanced MRI could provide further information, including the patency of the adjacent sigmoid sinus.
MRI head [**2124-4-10**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with a prior examination, again on the right side of the posterior fossa, there is a large apparently extra-axial mass lesion, measuring approximately 5.0 x 4.5 cm in transverse dimensions x 4.5 x 4.5 cm in the coronal MP-RAGE projection.
The orbits, the paranasal sinuses, and the mastoid air cells appear within normal limits.
CT Torso [**4-13**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST, FINDINGS: No pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are appreciated.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, FINDINGS: The patient is status post cholecystectomy.
The kidneys, adrenal glands, spleen, pancreas, and visualized loops of large and small bowel appear normal.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST, FINDINGS: The visualized loops of large and small bowel appear normal.
EKG [**4-13**]: Normal sinus rhythm, rate 71.
Intervals	Axes Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T 71	160	110	386/405	47	22	48  MRI [**4-15**]: FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the patient has undergone resection of right-sided posterior fossa meningioma.
Blood products are seen with a large surgical cavity in the region.
Postoperative changes in the posterior fossa with blood products, air, and surrounding edema unchanged with a downward position of the cerebellar tonsils as before.
Further evaluation with the MRV is recommended.
CTA/V of Head [**4-16**]: CTV OF THE BRAIN WITH CONTRAST HISTORY: Suspected venous sinus thrombosis right transverse sinus.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the ICU for Q 1 hour neuro checks due to the large size of the posterior fossa mass and due to the mass effect on the 4th ventricle.
Her neuro exam was stable without any focal deficit.
She was given arrangements to follow up with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**4-18**] for continued monitoring of her blood sugars while the dosing is tapered.
