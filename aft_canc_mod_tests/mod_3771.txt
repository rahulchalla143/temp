Following surgery her creatinine began to rise (7.0).
On [**1-4**], she became acutely hypotensive, vitals at the time were: T 99.4, BP 72/48, HR 95, 02sat 90 on 2L with low UOP 5-10cc/hr.
She had some response to a fluid bolus with sBP to the 90's.
Her initial ABG was 7.21/48/73.
She required 4U PRBC for post-op hct drop, which urology has been following.
Surgical pathology from nephrectomy consistent with oncocytoma with atypical features (extensive invasion into fat).
obese, tenderness surrounding surgical sites, soft, hypoactive bs EXT: warm, non-edematous, 2+ distal pulses NEURO: slightly confused,awake and oriented x 3   Pertinent Results: CTA [**1-4**] - IMPRESSION: 1.
Limited study but no main or lobar pulmonary embolus.
Given the history of malignancy this is concerning for metastasis and further evaluation with PET-CT can be performed.
EKG - [**1-4**] - Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats.
Although no obvious bony or soft parenchymal metastatic disease is identified, direct correlation with PET scan would help for better assessment if clinically indicated.

The patient was initially admitted to the urology service for the nephrectomy and mass removal but was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after her creatinine/ renal failure worsened in the post-operative setting.
Renal mass: Pathology returned as oncocytoma with atypical features.
OSH PET scan reportedly showed some brain enhancement.
Also, CTA demonstrated R apical nodular apical opacity concerning for metastatic disease.
An MRI was obtained of the head to eval for previously mentioned PET lesions however no focal lesions were seen on our study here.
Additionally, the nodules seen on CT scan will need to be reevaluated in [**2-26**] months.
You were found to have nodules on your chest CT scan and will require a follow up CT in [**2-26**] months.
You will have hemodialysis at FMC-[**Hospital3 **], located on [**Street Address(2) 75588**], [**Location (un) 3610**], MA ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 33711**]).
