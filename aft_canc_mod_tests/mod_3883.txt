WBC: 0.1 HCT: 27 (baseline low 30s) PLT: 23 (down from baseline) N:13 Band:13 L:38 M:25 E:0 Bas:13 .
PT: 12.9  PTT: 29.1  INR: 1.1  [**2118-7-11**] ECHO: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Small pericardial effusion without echo evidence of tamponade.
[**2118-7-15**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-7-11**], the pericardial effusion is slightly larger.
There is still no clear-cut echo evidence of tamponade.
CT CHEST [**2118-7-22**]: 1.
Interval progression of the large mediastinal mass has considerably increased in size since the previous examination of [**2118-3-21**].
CT Neck [**2118-7-29**]: Larynx appears obliterated on the axial scan due to adduction of left vocal cord.
Bone Marrow Biopsy [**2118-7-24**]: Final Results Pending   Brief Hospital Course: 1)Febrile Neutropenia: Pt admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia.
Blood cultures from admission were positive for 4/4 bottles pansensitive pseudomonas, with most likely source being gut translocation versus labial eschar/cellulitis.
A Chest CT scan on [**7-22**] did not show a significant change compared to her Chest CT on [**2118-6-28**] indicating that her lymphoma was resistant to the RICE she received.
A Neck CT on [**7-29**] showed approx 90% compression of her esophagus by her mediastinal mass.
Her troponin peaked at 0.23, and her CK and CKMB remained normal.
She had and echocardiogram [**7-11**] which showed moderate hypokinesis of the anterior and septal walls that was new compared with prior from [**2118-3-9**].
She was evaluated by cardiology who did not feel that diagnostic cath was indicated in the setting of her recent chemo.
They advised medical management with atorvastatin, beta-blockade as tolerated by her blood pressure.
A translabial U/S on [**2118-7-11**] showed no evidence of abscess or fluid collection.
Abd/Pelvic CT on [**7-15**] also did not show an evidence of abscess or fluid collection.
Ulcers should continue to be monitored for continued resolution.
6) Electrolyte Repletion: Patient was continued on Potassium and Magnesium replacement which were determined based on her needs as an inpatient.
She is scheduled to have her labs drawn on [**2118-8-1**] at 7 [**Hospital 1826**] Clinic and her dosages of these electrolytes should be adjusted accordingly.

We monitored your blood cell counts closely during you hospital stay since you were neutropenic upon admission.
Your blood counts have risen and you are no longer neutropenic.
You were started on the following new medications; 1) Metoprolol: This medication helps to control heart rate and will help protect your heart muscle.
