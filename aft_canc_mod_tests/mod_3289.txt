Admission Date:  [**2171-1-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-1-9**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**] Chief Complaint: Hematochezia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonoscopy x 2 ([**2171-1-2**] and [**2171-1-4**]) EGD ([**2171-1-2**]) Angiogram   History of Present Illness: 85 y/o female with PMH significant for HTN, hypercholesterolemia, MCA CVA in [**1-/2170**], and two past GI bleeds (most recent was hematochezia during hospitalization for CVA) admitted from nursing home after passing approximately half a cup of blood from her rectum.
Colonosocpy at this time was notable for diverticulosis but no acute bleeding.
A tagged red cell scan showed the source of bleeding to be the hepatic flexure of her colon.
Pt was followed up in [**Hospital **] clinic on [**2170-4-10**] at which time it was felt that she was doing well and a repeat colonoscopy was not indicated.
A GI consult was obtained on admission.
Her Hct on admission was 35.9.
A tagged red blood cell scan was also obtained which showed no active areas of bleeding.
On the morning of [**1-2**], an EGD was done which showed a Schatzki's ring at the GE junction but no bleeding.
A colonoscopy was significant for dark red blood in the rectum, sigmoid colon, and descending colon.
Another tagged red blood cell scan was then obtained which showed bleeding at the hepatic flexure felt to be coming from the right colic or middle colic artery.
However, subsequent angio was negative so no embolization was preformed.
Colonoscopy today ([**1-4**]) was normal.
H/O GI bleeds in [**2168**] and as above 2.
S/P MCA CVA on [**2171-1-28**]- Since this time, pt has suffered from residual aphasia and left hemiparesis.

Blood culture [**1-7**] neg x2 --- Femoral vascular U/S [**2171-1-4**]:No evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula in the right inguinal region.
Recommendations: Consider dilation if patient experiences dysphagia --- Tagged RBC scan [**2171-1-2**]:Active gastrointestinal bleeding localized to the hepatic flexure   Brief Hospital Course: 1.GI: The pt seen by GI in ED.
She received a unit of PRBCs and was lightheaded, so she had a tagged RBC scan which did not show source of bleeding.
In the unit, she had an EGD which did not show bleeding, and a colonoscopy which showed blood in sigmoid and descending colon along with diverticuli.
A repeat tagged RBC scan showed source at hepatic flexure(same as previous bleed in [**Month (only) 404**]), but a follow-up angio did not reveal a source, so no embolization was performed.
Repeat colonoscopy two days later showed multipls diverticuli throughout colon, but no active bleeding.
At this point, pt transferred to floor where her Hct was checked twice daily.
Her BP was always stable.
HTN: Her BP was elevated with SBP 170 when she came out of the unit.
At this time, her prn pain med was decreased and her xanax qhs was restarted.
5.h/o UTIs: Initial UA and Ucx were negative.
Please call your neurologist, Dr [**First Name (STitle) **], at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1690**], to schedule an appointment for stroke follow-up and pain control follow-up in [**4-5**] weeks.
