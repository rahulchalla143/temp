Given its relatively rapid increase in size since [**2130**], findings are concerning for malignancy, and further evaluation is recommended.
CT L-SPINE W/ CONTRAST  [**2137-2-23**] 9:43 AM The study is somewhat limited due to patient positioning and motion.
A portion of this mass extends superiorly, filling the spinal canal and causing smooth remodeling and expansion of the spinal canal, posterior to L1.

Lumbar Mass - suspicious for malignancy as there is a large interval increase from prior imaging in [**11/2132**] at which point dural ectasia was called @ L2.
Neurosurgery was consulted and further imaging with MRI was suggested, although patinet would not tolerate this exam, thus it was not obtained.
It was thought that the patient is not currently an optimal surgical candidate and that the MRI and further work-up could be done as an outpatient.
Obstipation - patient with large colonic fecal obstruction.
She remained hemodynamically stable in this regard and her Hct can be followed as an outpatient.
Her INR will need to be checked often to ensure that her levels are inbetween [**2-23**].
Stage IV Decubitus ulcerations - Patient with polymicrobial wounds growing out MRSA.
Of note, it was found that she had air in her R thigh, found on CT abdomen.
Patient had an agressive bowel regimen and follow-up scans revealed no active SBO.
