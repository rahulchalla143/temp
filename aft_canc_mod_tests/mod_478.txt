HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 13916**] is a 78-year-old woman with a history of plasmacytoma of her left anterior third rib, status post radiation therapy one year prior, who underwent a bone marrow biopsy on [**2127-8-3**] which demonstrated increased plasma cells.
She was also noted to have a creatinine of 2.6 from her baseline value of 0.5 to 0.8 and was admitted for further treatment with plasmapheresis to hopefully prevent further kidney damage.
Of note, the patient had a recent non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2127-5-24**] at [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital with positive enzymes and electrocardiogram changes in the inferior and lateral leads.
Post infarction, she had a stress test which reportedly showed no reversible ischemia.
A transthoracic echocardiogram at that time confirmed an ejection fraction of 55% to 60%.
Congestive heart failure (with an echocardiogram demonstrating an ejection fraction of 55% to 60%); presumed diastolic dysfunction.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed temperature was 97.6, heart rate was 60, blood pressure was 122/50, respiratory rate was 24, and oxygen saturation was 97% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed left eye with corneal transplant.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Pulmonary examination revealed crackles at the left base.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
Skin examination revealed no rashes.
Neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented times three.
Sensory and motor examinations were grossly within normal limits.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 8.2, hematocrit was 31.6, and platelets were 311.
Sodium was 140, potassium was 3.8, chloride was 110, bicarbonate was 16, blood urea nitrogen was 60, creatinine was 2.4, and blood glucose was 98.
Urine protein to creatine was 5.3.
Creatinine clearance was 18.
Albumin was 3.8.
Calcium was 9.4 and phosphate was 5.4.
Prothrombin time was 13.1, INR was 1.2, and partial thromboplastin time was 21.9.
The patient underwent plasmapheresis on [**10-9**].
Cardiac enzymes demonstrated a creatine kinase of 158 and a troponin of                               DR.[**Last Name (STitle) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] 12-AAN   Dictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7485**]  MEDQUIST36  D:  [**2128-6-28**]  14:22 T:  [**2128-7-1**]  11:56 JOB#:  [**Job Number 13917**]
