She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2166-11-22**], for further management of what was felt to be a post-obstructive pneumonia.
Also status post pleural biopsy done in [**2166-10-9**], which was positive for adenocarcinoma.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature was 97.9, heart rate 16, blood pressure 99/50, respiratory rate 20.
Her chest examination revealed scattered rhonchi.
Her heart examination was regular, with normal S1 and a physiologically split S2, no S3 or S4, and a soft systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border.
LABORATORY DATA:   Significant for a white count of 21.8, hematocrit of 32.2, and platelet count of 306.
Her laboratories were otherwise remarkable for an arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.40, a PCO2 of 53, and a PO2 of 87.
Chest x-ray showed normal heart size, bilateral pleural effusions, right perihilar mass, patchy infiltrates.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 108 beats per minute, with left axis deviation, low limb voltages, and no ischemic changes.
Lung cancer:  The patient has Stage IV lung cancer with pleural metastases diagnosed by biopsy on [**2166-11-7**], which revealed adenocarcinoma.
On [**11-24**], she underwent bronchoscopy which revealed near-total tumor obstruction of the right upper lobe and right middle lobe, and on CT was found to have partial collapse of the right middle lobe and right upper lobe.
Pericardial effusions:  The patient had an echocardiogram performed on [**11-25**], which revealed small pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology.
She had negative blood cultures and a negative urinalysis, suggesting that this was most likely not sepsis.
However, the patient on admission had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed, which revealed a systemic vascular resistance of 1121 on dopamine, right atrial pressure of 10, right ventricular pressure of 30/10, a PA pressure of 30/20, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12.
A CT scan of the brain was performed to rule out brain metastases, and this scan was negative.
Dopamine 0-20 mcg/kg/minute titrate to mean arterial pressure greater than 60 3.
