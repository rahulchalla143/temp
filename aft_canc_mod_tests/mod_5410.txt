Small pulmonary nodules measuring up to 6 mm should be followed up with a chest CT in 12 months if the patient is a nonsmoker and has no risk of malignancy.
Otherwise, followup CT at 6 months is recommended.
E coli grew only from left nephrostomy tube during this admission, not right, though no definite stones seen on final read of CT abdomen/pelvis.
Her urine culture grew pan-sensitive e. coli, so antibiotics were narrowed to oral ciprofloxacin on transfer to floor, and she will continue on ciprofloxacin for a total course of antibiotics of 2 weeks, last dose [**2194-11-26**].
[**Month/Day/Year **] cultures drawn after starting antibiotics remained negative.
There was question of non-obstructive stones seen on CT in left renal pelvis, but final report shows no definite stones.
She will be discharged on warfarin 3mg daily, next INR to be checked at PCP office [**Name9 (PRE) 2974**] [**11-21**].
TSH on admission was 0.29, which is difficult to interpret in acute illness but should be rechecked as outpatient to ensure proper suppression.
