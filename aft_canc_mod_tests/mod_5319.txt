Brain stem biopsy pathology result is significant for infiltrative astrocytoma.
In house repeat CT of the chest significant for left lower lobe, consolidative opacity, with central area of necrosis, an air-fluid level, and low-attenuation material.
Attempt to obtain images from [**Hospital **] hospital regarding pulmonary lesions for comparison, [**Name (NI) 653**] with MEdical records to sent ua CD images.
Medicine and interventional pulmonary services recommended continue antibiotics, and follow up with chest CT with and with out contrast in 4 weeks in pulmonary clinic.
In the mean time [**Name (NI) 653**] with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] at the [**Hospital **] hospital regarding tranfering him over to VA regarding his known pulmonary process, and colon carcinoma for further work up which he was agreed with the transfer.
