History of Present Illness: This is a 55 yo M with a 30 pack year history of tobacco smoking who was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-31**] for endobronchial mechanical debridement of newly-diagnosed NSCLC, which was obstructing the right mainstem bronchus.
Subsequent CXR showed RML consolidation and was concerning for pneumonia.
He presented to the ED, and CT chest on [**8-30**] showed a large hilar mass 4.2cm x 6cm invading and partially occluding R mainstem bronchus and tracheal carina, with metastases to the trachea.
Bronchoscopy and biopsy was performed on [**8-31**] that confirmed non-small cell lung ca.
CXR on [**8-31**] showed a small right apical pneumothorax, at most 10%, and complete occlusion of right mainstem bronchus since [**8-30**].

CXR PA and lateral [**2119-9-1**]: The current study demonstrates right mediastinal shift in combination with abrupt termination of the right main bronchus as well as irregularity in tracheal column.
Comparison with outside studies as well as cross-sectional imaging is highly recommended.
CT chest with contrast [**2119-9-2**]: 1.
MRI head with and without contrast [**2119-9-3**]: 1.
# Non small-cell lung cancer: The patient was diagnosed at an outside hospital and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ridid bronchoscopy and endobronchial debridement of the tumor, which was obstructing the right mainstem bronchus.
The debridement was complicated by perforation of the bronchus intermedius and pneumothorax, which was treated with a chest tube.
A bone scan and head MRI were done for staging purposes and were notable for a focus of increased uptake in the right manubrium, concerning for metastasis.
The patient will need repeat bronchoscopy and chest x-ray at the time of his pulmonology follow-up.
# Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated with a rigid bronch for mechanical debridement of his airway and attempted placement of Y stent.
Chest tube was placed, and the patient was transferred to the ICU.
His hematocrit remained stable.
# Chest wall pain: The patient's chest wall pain, related to the procedures that he underwent, including the chest tube, was treated with oxycodone.
# Normocytic anemia: Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
# Pending labs at time of discharge: There is a pending blood culture from [**2119-9-2**].
All other culture has shown no growth.
MH# [**Telephone/Fax (5) 87252**].

Upper GI bleeding   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had no further bleeding and your blood counts remained stable.
