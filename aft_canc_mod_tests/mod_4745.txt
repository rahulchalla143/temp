Acute Renal Failure: Patient's creatinine on discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] was .8 on [**2179-1-24**].
Upon admission, his creatinine was elevated to 4.3.
His creatinine steadily improved with IVF and treatment of his infections.
For further evaluation of his acute renal failure, he had a renal ultrasound which revealed hydronephrosis; however, follow-up imaging with CTU revealed that he actually had only a peri-pelvic cyst that could cause the false appearance of hydronephrosis on ultrasound.

His sodium remained within normal limits, and stable [**Date range (1) 8946**].
