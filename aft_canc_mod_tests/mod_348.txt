Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Portable TEE (Complete) Done [**2148-10-31**] IMPRESSION: No left atrial/appendage thrombus.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT LEFT Study Date of [**2148-11-1**] FINDINGS: Please note, the study is somewhat limited due to patient's inability to Valsalva.
Grayscale and Doppler evaluation of the left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins was performed.
ECG Study Date of [**2148-11-2**] Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2148-11-1**] sinus rhythm has appeared.
CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2148-11-2**] IMPRESSION: 1)Multiple subcutaneous nodules with larger necrotic masses in the right axilla and further nodules in the left perinephric region are highly suspicious for metastases, possible melanoma.
Biopsy of the right axillary lymph node is recommended.
During the admission, he was cardioverted several times without success, loaded on amiodarone, and also administered an esmolol gtt during periods of refractory tachycardia, which did not help improve his rate but did make him hypotensive.
# [**Location (un) 5668**] cell tumor: Mr [**Known lastname 10113**] had multiple concerning nodules on exam and by CT which were biopsied and showed [**Location (un) 5668**] cell carcinoma.
CT scan and MRI of the head was performed and multiple intracranial metastasis were found with a possible intraparenchial bleed in the cerebellum.
CT head was obtained on [**11-4**] and showed no acute intracranial proccess, no bleed, but did showed extra-axial lesions which were concerning for meningiomas vs. metastiatic cancer.
# Hyperlipidemia: Cholesterol not well controlled according to last lipid panel measured in [**11-24**].
Chol: 295, LDL: 192, HDL: 79, TG: 120.
# LE edema: LE doppler performed early in the admission out of concern for DVT unequal edema of the LEs, however studies were negative and the LE edema was attributed to his heart failure and he was treated with diuresis.
