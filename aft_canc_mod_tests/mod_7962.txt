CXR [**2127-11-18**]: Interval near-total opacification of the left hemithorax, likely secondary to pleural effusion and soft tissue density, perhaps secondary to the patient's history of metastatic disease.
FDG-avid lymph nodes in AP window (SUV 11.9), left internal mammary (SUV 9.3), left & right hila (SUV 8.2, 7.6), pre-cardiac (SUV 6.7) and likely para-aortic (SUV 8.0) at the level of the upper pole to the left kidney.
PFT's [**2127-9-18**]: Results are consistent with a restrictive ventilatory defect.
