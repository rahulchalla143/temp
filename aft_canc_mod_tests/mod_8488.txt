Possible mucus plugging in distal left-sided bronchi; although underlying obstructive bronchial/ peribronchial mass is not excluded and follow-up study is suggested.
Echo ([**10-27**]): The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated .
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-10-24**], the effusion is slightly/minimally larger but without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
Immunotyping of pleural fluid ([**10-30**]): Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
Echo ([**11-8**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-10-28**], no major change is evident.
Pelvic U/S ([**11-8**]): IMPRESSION: 3.1 cm adnexal simple cyst, slightly increased in size from the prior CT, but with no other concerning features.
Chest xray ([**11-11**]): IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to chest radiographs since [**10-29**], most recently [**11-7**]:  Small residual left pleural effusion change.
A talc pleurodiesis was performed and the patient's pain was controlled with Dilaudid at first and then oxycodone thereafter.
Her chest tubes were removed and a chest xray confirmed full expansion of the left lung with an unchanged pleural effusion.
Her final chest xray shows left lower lobe atelectasis.
Analysis of the pleural fluid showed the absence of malignant cells in cytology, no bacteria/viral/acid fast bacteria on repeat cultures, and flow cytometry showed no cells concerning for lymphoma.
The pleural effusions might be due to exacerbation of her diastolic heart failure, though on prior admissions, the effusion did not appear to be a transudate.
Lastly, A CT of the abdomen from [**2117**] showed a cyst in the lower abdomen.
A pelvic U/S was done to further characterize the cyst and it was noted to be a simple cyst and not concerning for malignancy.
#Septic shock:  The patient was initially hypotensive and the differential included septic shock vs. cardiogenic shock.
A bedside echo in the ED did not find evidence of tamponade, so the patient most likely had septic shock with the source of infection being pulmonary.
Her blood pressure responded to intravenous fluids boluses.
A reticulocyte count showed an appropriate reponse to her anemia.
After repeated blood draws, the patient's hematocrit steadily dropped to 21.8.
On discharge, her hematocrit was 28.9. .
With continued diuresis and the addition of lisinopril for BP management, the patient developed acute renal failure again.
Her creatinine on discharge was 1.4. .
A urine culture revealed pan-senstive Pseudomonas 10,000-100,000 colonies.
Since the patient remained in a sinus arrhythmia (not in atrial fibrillation on telemetry) throughout hospitalization, it was felt the risks of Coumadin outweighed the benefits, therefore, she will not continue on Coumadin.
A TTE showed an effusion without hemodynamic compromise, therefore, it was treated medically.
A repeat echocardiograms showed a reduced effusion.
Her sodium remained in normal range during her time on the floors, so she will not be continued on salt tablets on discharge.
She will have a blood draw later in the week to check her sodium.
On discharge, her sodium was 133. .
An ultrasound ruled out a deep venous thrombosis.

Multiple tests were done including analysis of the fluid which did not show any obvious cancer or signs of infection causing the effusion.
