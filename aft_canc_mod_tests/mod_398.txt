Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus; Blood in the stomach; Ulcer in the pre-pylorus (thermal therapy); Ulcers in the duodenum ; Recommendations: serial hematocrits EGD in [**9-17**] weeks; [**Hospital1 **] proton pump inhibitor; Repeat EGD if acutely rebleeds .

Tacrolimus level was followed daily and dosed accordingly.
ECG changes resolved without any elevation on serial cardiac enzymes.
Likely will need an outpatient stress prior to any surgical interventions for further investigation/treatment of his anal mass.
