In OSH [**Name (NI) **], pt unresponsive (VS unknown), noted to be in respiratory distress with a sat of 77%.
Labs were significant for wbc 22k, Hct 10, K 6.0, Bicarb 10, INR 10 (felt secondary to coumadin in combination with antibitotics and amiodarone).
Pulmonary was consulted and performed a bronchoscopy, which revealed complete occlusion of the left mainstem bronchus, as well as secretions and mucus plugs in the right lung, which were cleaned out and sent for culture.
For his ongoing fevers, vancomycin and zosyn were continued for presumed post-obstructive pneumonia.
Stool cultures were positive for C. diff, so he was also started on PO Flagyl.
Apparently, the patient also had 1/2 blood cultures positive for VRE; however, this was believed to be a contaminent so linezolid was not started.
On admission to the ICU, he was hypotensive with SBP in the mid-80's.
Bronchoscopy was performed which revealed 95% occlusion of the left mainstem bronchus by extrinsic tumor.
Past Medical History: - Left lung squamous cell carcinoma: diagnosed in [**2184-10-15**]; s/p stenting to the left mainstem bronchus because of occulsion, as well as radiation therapy.
