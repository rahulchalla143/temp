There has been worsening of the area of consolidation with air-fluid levels within the right upper lobe.
CT chest 11/12:1.
Evaluation for torsion is limited but the configuration of the collapsed right middle lobe appears similar to the prior examination where there was not evidence for torsion.
CXR 11/13:2 right chest tubes in place.
Left lung clear CXR [**11-23**]: Unchanged appearance of the mild right apical hydropneumothorax CXR [**11-24**]: Moderate volume right apical pneumothorax is unchanged.
CXR [**11-26**]: 1.
CXR [**2172-11-30**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-28**], the right chest tube has been removed.
Non-con chest CT was suspicious for empyema.
The next day he went to OR for redo thoracotomy, RML lobectomy and washout, received 2500 IVF and 2 u PRBC.
He had stridors initially that resolved with albuterol but +crackles and a CXR consistent with fluid overload- IVF were then stopped.
On POD 1, neo weaned off at 3 AM, then turned back on at 5:30 AM to support BP, O2 sats were at high 90s-100 on 50% face tent.
One chest tube was removed and cxr showed no pneumothorax.
On POD 3 sputum cultures were growing out e.coli and the Tobramycin was dc'd after discussion w/ ID given improvement on CXR and no pseudomonas in cultures.
Chest tube #3 was pulled on this day and cxr showed no pneumothorax.
Also, his creatinine bumped up to 1.5 (concern for med toxicity).
Repeat CXR shows no acute changes and it was likely a mucous plug.
His POD 5 cxr was greatly improved, pain control better, and he was transferred to the floor.
On POD 7, his final chest tube was removed and cxr showed no pneumothorax.
When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications- ms contin and oxycodone  CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
BP needed to be maintained occasionally as described above.
Pulmonary: The patient was eventually stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
