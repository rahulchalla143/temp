While most of the systemic metastasis responded to CTLA4, the right frontal mass increased in size from [**2193-1-8**] MRI (4 x 2.8 x 3 cm) to the [**2193-3-2**] MRI (5.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm).
All the lesions were excised and pathology revealed incompletely excised metastatic melanoma.
He additionally underwent a CT scan of the torso on [**2192-8-15**] which revealed lung, liver, soft tissue, bone, and adrenal metastasis.
On [**2192-8-23**], he underwent a CT scan of the brain that showed three lesions, two 15 mm lesions in the right and left frontal lobes with associated edema, but no evidence of shift and a third lesion in the right frontoparietal lobe.
Family History: His father had melanoma with extensive disease on his nose which required essentially entire excision of his nose and then he believes he developed metastatic disease.

Following gadolinium there is no evidence of a definite area of residual enhancement identified in the right frontal region.
This lesion was also not visualized on the MRI of [**2193-3-6**] and [**2193-3-2**].
CT Head [**2193-3-7**]: FINDINGS: Multiple postoperative changes are notable in the brain including osseous defects consistent with right frontal craniotomy.
There is adjacent right frontal hypodensity, indicating edema, which was present on preoperative studies.
