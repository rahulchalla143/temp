An MR is recommended to further characterize this mass.
Evaluation of post-contrast images demonstrate enhancement of the [**Doctor First Name 500**] adjacent to the mass suggesting that this mass is infiltrating the [**Doctor First Name 500**] locally.
Symptoms and examination remained stable.
Post operative CT scan showed there has been massive progression of intracranial mass effect with approximately 12 mm of subfalcine herniation with obliteration of most sulci bilaterally.
Post Operative MRI showed:  No evidence of residual neoplasm on post-gadolinium sequences, though evaluation in the immediate postoperative period is limited due to intrinsic T1 hyperintense blood product and a follow up MRI at a later date, as clinically indicated, would improve sensitivity.
On [**4-12**] she was transferred to the floor and the results of her biopsy showed ANAPLASTIC (MALIGNANT) MENINGIOMA.WHO ([**2148**]) grade 3.
