Bone with marrow fibrosis compatible with chronic osteomyelitis  OTHER RESULTS ============== Chest Radiograph [**2146-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
EKG [**2146-4-10**]: Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2146-3-8**] heart rate is significantly increased.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis [**2146-4-11**]: IMPRESSION: No CT evidence to explain recurrent bacteremia.
Transthoracic Echocardiogam [**2146-4-13**]: IMPRESSION:Prior (stable) antero-apical myocardial infarction with mild to moderately depressed LVEF.
Right Upper Extremity Ultrasound [**2146-4-13**]: IMPRESSION: No right upper extremity DVT.
1) Bacteremia/Sepsis: Patient was clearly septic at presentation with hypotension requiring norepinehprine on the night of admission and positive blood cultures for MRSA.
Outside hospital blood cultures revealed MRSA, pan-sensitive klebsiella, and two kinds of streptococcus.
In order to rule out other sources of infection the patient had a CT abdomen and pelvis on recommendation on the infectious disease consult team, which showed no clear etiology of bacteremia though this was a suboptimal study due to the lack of IV contrast.
Surveillance cultures were persistently negative except for one set on [**2146-4-13**], which showed S. aureus raising concern for a persistent source of infection.
Pathology on bone specimens revealed changes consistent with chronic osteomyelitis.
He was transfused in the hospital to maintaine Hct >25 and Plt >50 (prior to surgery) and Hct >25 thereafter.
# CAD/CHF: Patient has a historical diagnosis of chronic systolic CHF with EF of approximately 40%.
Prostate exam was performed as part of an infectious work up and revealed no tenderness and UA's were persistently benign.

It was then evident that you had not cleared the infection as your blood continued to grow the bacteria, and this was thought to be due to your pacemaker wires.
