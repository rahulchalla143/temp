She had a temperature to 103 following cultures.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 99.4, with maximum temperature of 103, blood pressure 112/69, heart rate 118 to 140, 97 percent on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: pupils equal, round, reactive to light, extraocular movements intact.
Clear to auscultation otherwise.
LABORATORY:  Urinalysis was cloudy with moderate leukocytes, large blood, positive nitrate and 30 protein, greater than 50 WBCs, many bacteria, rare yeast, epis 2.
Sodium 130, potassium 4.6, chloride 96, bicarb 27, BUN 25, creatinine 1.2, glucose 96, calcium 8.3, magnesium 2, phos 3, white count 6.3,, hematocrit of 30.7, platelets of 319, INR of 1.3.
Chest x-ray is stable, cardiomegaly, no congestive heart failure, no infiltrate.
Urine cultures and blood cultures are pending.
Patient had a hematocrit drop from 30 to 25, at which point she was transferred to the medical Intensive Care Unit for monitoring.
Following that patient's rate was maintained between the 80s and 100.
Blood was also noted in the nephrostomy tube.
Based on the hypotension and the concern for retroperitoneal bleed, patient was transferred to the Funard Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.
Once she remained hemodynamically stable with her blood pressures ranging in the high 80s to low 90s patient received a CT of the abdomen to evaluate the level of retroperitoneal bleed.
She was transfused to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 30 due to her history of coronary artery disease and an inferior myocardial infarction.
To further evaluate the stent, the patient underwent a nephrostogram, which showed patency of the stent, though continued clot which they felt was dissolving and the cause of the dark blood in the nephrostomy tube.
Since patient continued to have blood in the tube, on [**8-2**] interventional radiology performed an angiogram to evaluate for active bleeding.
Patient's hematocrit was monitored following this procedure, she was again transfused to keep her hematocrit greater than 30.
Once her hematocrit was determined to be stable the patient was deemed safe to discharge from the Interventional Radiology standpoint.
They requested that she follow up approximately one week post discharge for a repeat nephrogram and an intended internalization of the nephrostomy.
Of note, while the patient was here, initial urinalysis was positive for E. Coli which she was treated for a full course of ciprofloxacin for ten days.
Follow up urinalysis showed no bacteria but did have 10,000 to 100,000 yeast, though she was treated with Diflucan.
Patient remained anemic during this stay but goal hematocrit remained greater than 30 in the setting of her coronary artery disease.
With the hematocrit stable patient was deemed safe to discharge.
Her hypothyroidism was not an active issue and she was maintained on her Synthroid.
Patient continued to be noted to be orthostatic while she was here, but since she had a history it was determined that her baseline blood pressure was in the low 90s, and she would occasionally drop to the 80s, but she continued to mentate and felt fine.
Her electrolytes remained stable, and she was continued on a cardiac diet except for the times that she was n.p.o.
