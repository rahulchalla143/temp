Her work-up in the hospital included normal shunt series, normal VP tap (but protein 60) and unremarkable LP.
Work-up further revealed bilateral hilar infiltrates on CXR, with preserved saturation at presentation.
Subsequent imaging included CT chest which showed bilateral ground glass opacities with upper lobe predominance.
Sputum culture was negative.
Pulmonary was consulted, and bronchoscopy performed on [**2129-8-4**] showed thin secretions, but was otherwise largely underwhelming.
A BAL grew no organisms, and rapid viral screen was negative.
Repeat imaging studies also showed progression of infiltrates, and concern was raised over possible PCP (last inhaled Pentamidine dose [**2129-7-14**]).
ABG on floor on shovel mask 70% 7.28/31/71.
Presented c cholecystitis, found to have WBC 56k with 50% blasts and plts 20.
Marrow biopsy at [**Hospital1 18**] showed AML.
She had initial cytogenetic abnormality of inversion-16 which also had resolved.
- [**2127-11-10**] repeat marrow showed a markedly hypercellular marrow with no blast clusters and CD34+ blasts comprising less than 3% of the cellularity.
- [**2127-12-4**] started Consolidation with four cycles of HIDAC - [**2127**]: bone marrow biopsy later shows relapsed acute leukemia.
Base of skull XRT and intrathecal chemotherapy through an ommaya reservoir ([**2129-1-7**]) placed during her admission - [**Date range (1) 57171**]: continued on q2week Depo ARA-C, also with withdrawing immunosuppression.
Endocarditis in [**2125**] 3.
MI [**2125**] 4.
AVR [**2125**] 5.
MVR [**2125**] 6.
Hepatitis C: HCV Ab positive [**2-/2128**], VL [**4-9**] 22,100,000, liver biopsy in [**2-7**] with stage 1-2 fibrosis and bile duct damage likely [**1-6**] hep C but cannot exclude GVHD 8.
Physical Exam: VITALS: Afebrile, BP 108/66, HR 100-110s, RR 24, Sat 92% on NRB.
JVP difficult to assess secondary to respiratory distress.
Pertinent Results: Laboratory results: [**2129-8-1**] 11:40AM   UREA N-13 CREAT-0.6 SODIUM-133 POTASSIUM-4.9 CHLORIDE-102 TOTAL CO2-22 ANION GAP-14 [**2129-8-1**] 11:40AM   WBC-6.4# RBC-3.73* HGB-12.7 HCT-38.5 MCV-103* MCH-34.0* MCHC-33.1 RDW-16.7* [**2129-8-1**] 11:40AM   NEUTS-66.7 LYMPHS-25.9 MONOS-4.9 EOS-1.9 BASOS-0.5 [**2129-8-1**] 11:40AM   CALCIUM-8.7 PHOSPHATE-2.1* MAGNESIUM-1.9 URIC ACID-2.6 [**2129-8-1**] 11:40AM   ALT(SGPT)-45* AST(SGOT)-93* LD(LDH)-236 CK(CPK)-20* ALK PHOS-352* TOT BILI-3.8* DIR BILI-2.5* INDIR BIL-1.3 [**2129-8-1**] 03:36PM   LACTATE-1.3  RELEVANT IMAGING DATA: [**2129-8-3**] CT CHEST W/O: Multiple focal areas of ground-glass opacity in both lungs and peribronchial infiltration are more prominent in the upper lobes, and confluent in the left apex.
[**2129-8-7**] CT CHEST W/O: Worsening diffuse bilateral patchy ground glass opacities with an upper lobe predominance.
[**2129-8-9**] CXR portable: The previously described extensive bilateral parenchymal densities are again identified.
No nidus of infection was found and all culture data was negative.
Abdominal paracentesis showed blasts in her abdomen suggesting reoccurence of her cancer.
Thought to be secondary an underlying infection, but all culture data was negative.
She initially required Levophed to maintain her urine output and blood pressure but Dopamine was added in hope to wean the Levophed down.
CT scan of the abdomen was done and did not suggest an obstruction.
She required multiple platelet transfusions to keep her platelet level above 30.
5) FEN: Ct with TPN.
