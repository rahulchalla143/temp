Vascular surgery recommended transition to argoatrtoban for concern that his INR was falsely elevated from liver disease.

Per family recent INR has been 1.9.
However given un-reliability of INR in current setting severe illness and the large size of the clot, vascular recommended argatroban for treatment acutely.
Current thought based on CT is that patient has a pancretic head mass with mets to liver.
