[**2114-5-28**] cardiac catheterization with stenting of RCA   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 77625**] was involved in a motor vehicle accident [**2-20**] and on a CT scan an incidental 3-cm lesion involving the left lobe of the segment 4B was found.
He had further workup including a chest CT which demonstrated 2 small lung nodules.
He was seen by thoracic surgery and underwent a flexible bronchoscopy with biopsy and cervical mediastinoscopy which was unremarkable.
A PET scan showed + right upper lobe nodule.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The RCA had a 99% mid vessel stenosis and an aneuysm of the ostium which was present at baseline.
Resting hemodynamics revealed nromal systemic blood pressure.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-4-4**], the focal wall motion abnormalities and right ventricular findings are new.
On POD 1 ([**5-25**]) his chest tubes were placed to water seal, the epidural was continued and he was stable for transfer to the floor.
EKG showed new Afib and Lopressor was given with no change.
ABG showed decreased PaO2.
CXR demonstrated increased left lung opacity.
Cardiac enzymes revealed increased troponins with new ischemia on EKG.
Lower extremity US which were negative for DVT and a bronchoscopy which was clear.
A stat head CT was done which showed no evidence of acute intracranial pathology.
Two units of PRBC were transfused for a hct of 25.8.
Neuro exam improved.
CXR showed Asymmetrical interstitial edema affecting the left lung to a greater degree than the right.
The CT was d/c'd without incident.
CXR on [**6-3**] showed persistent right-sided moderate-to-large pneumothorax, unchanged and left-sided effusion and left basilar atelectasis persisted.
Breath sounds were diminished on the left.
Vital signs and labs were stable.
