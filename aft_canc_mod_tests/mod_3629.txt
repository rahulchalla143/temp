His hospital course by problem is as follows:  Neuro: His CTA showed Total occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, marked stenosis at the right common carotid artery bifurcation and occlusion of the proximal right vertebral artery.
His perfusion studies showed a prolonged mean transit time consistent with left middle cerebral arterial territory ischemia.
He continued to have BRBPR and after discussion anticoagulation was stopped and he was started on Aggrenox (no sxs of angina)  His blood pressure was target at SBP 120-180.
Keep SBP <220 and DBP <110 and MAP < 130.
His A1c was 6.3 and his LDL was 48.
His LDL should be maintained less than 70 over the long term.
A TTE was negative for a PFO and his repeat Carotid dopplers showed 80 to 99% stenosis of the R ICA and complete occlusion of the L ICA.
Vascular surgery was consulted and recommended a CEA in [**5-18**] week.
After a colonoscopy for his GI bleeding he was started on a heparin drip with a goal PTT maintained between 50 and 70.
He remained hemodynamically stable and his Hct was also stable.
He therefore had the procedure on [**2-24**] which showed radiation proctitis, multiple AVM's, as well as a clot which was cauterized.
GI did not feel repeat colonoscopy would be of value.
There were polyps noted on his colonoscopy, and he will require a repeat colonoscopy for purposes of polypectomy in a few months as arranged by his PCP.
His lisinopril was re-started at a low dose prior to discharge.
Fe studies were consistent with Iron deficiency as well as chronic disease.
His retic count was normal.
The joint was noted to be warm, edematous with marked tenderness to palpation in the absence of trauma or infection.
Followup Instructions: Please see your primary care doctor (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) next week, you should have a repeat hematocrit checked and discuss your treatment for gout.
You will need a follow up colonscopy in [**5-18**] months (off aggrenox 1 week prior) for removal of polyps noted on your colonoscopy performed here in the hospital.
With Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]  Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 44**]  Date/Time:[**2149-3-24**] 4:00    Please call Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (vascular surgery) for a follow up appointment in four weeks to plan a carotid endarterectomy.
