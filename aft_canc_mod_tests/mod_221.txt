MICRO/PATH: Blood Culture x 2 sets [**2182-4-29**]: NGTD Urine Culture [**2182-4-29**]: NO GROWTH MRSA SCREEN [**2182-4-29**]: Pending .
CT Head Non-Con [**2182-4-29**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
If clinical concern for intracranial mass is high, MRI is more sensitive for detecting metatatic disease; non-contrast CT has limited sensitivity but there is no evidence for mass effect or edema.
CT Torso with IV Contrast [**2182-4-29**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
# Stage IV Adenocarcinoma of the Lung: Patient had recent hx of weight loss, SOB, voice hoarseness and a CT with left perihilar mass with compression of adjacent pulmonary artery and bronchi, bilateral lung nodules with LAD and what appears to be diffuse liver metastases.
On admission, no tissue diagnosis was available but pleural fluid cytology from outpatient thoracentesis returned as adenocarcinoma.
He underwent a CTA chest which was negative for pulmonary embolism or significant pleural effusion.
# Acute Renal Failure, Hyperkalemia: Patient had a Cr of 2.5 on admission up from unknown prior baseline and initial K of 6.8 in the ED with prominent peaked t-waves on EKG as well as an arterial pH of 6.84.
His hyperkalemia was felt to be the result of acidsosis causing extracellular shifts, renal failure causing decreased excretion, and tumor lysis syndrome causing increased production.
# Severe Lactic Acidosis: On admission his arterial pH was 6.84, GAP of 38, and lacate of 14.9.
# Tumor Lysis Syndrome: On admission he had a Cr 2.5, Uric acid 21.1, K 6.8, Phos 10.7, Calcium 9.4, LDH 5600+.
He had been having issues with gouty attacks which were new for him and likely the initial stages of his TLS.
TLS is very atypical for a solid malignancy so concern was raised for possible lymphoma although review of his blood smear and final report on his pleural fluid as positive for adenocarcinoma removed this suspicion.
# Concern for Sepsis, Source Unknown: Patient was admitted with a white count to 59K with 10% bands, tachycardia, tachypnea, and borderline pressures in the ED that were fluid responsive.
Positive UA with negative urine cultures, pending blood cultures, and possible obstructive liver enzyme profile (although could be [**Last Name (un) 7245**] malignancy related).
# Fulminant Liver Failure/DIC: Patient was admitted with Tbili 11.4, INR 3.3, ALT 500+, AST 1300, Alk phos 2800.
