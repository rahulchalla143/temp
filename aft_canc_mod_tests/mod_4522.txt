Labs were significant for WBC 1.3 with 88% blasts, platelets 17, and elevated LFTs.
CXR showed irregular density in the superior aspect of the RLL, increased compared to prior, concerning for worsening infectious process.
BP was in the 80's after 2L IVF and right IJ CVL was placed.
Shock ultrasound showed a trace pericardial effusion.
CVP was measured to be 12.
BP now 93/56 and close to being maxed out on neo.

[**8-7**] CT chest/abd/pelvis: 1.
Lumbar spine and left hip DJD.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Septic Shock/Neutropenic Fever: The patient had positive blood cultures with E. coli as well as VRE.
He required multiple pressors to maintain his blood pressure.
On admission he had a WBC count of 1.3 w ANC of 0 and 90% blasts, but throughout the course of his stay and progression of his infection his WBC count rose to 20 w 98% blasts.
Abnormal LFTs: Elevated bili to 2.3 with alk phos of 537.
Repeat abdominal imaging was considered, however he never was stable enough to leave the floor for the study.
