During the current workup a right retrograde pyelogram revealed a large right renal pelvic tumor.
This was confirmed on a subsequent CT scan.
With the exception of a transient mild episode of acute renal failure with a creatinine bump to 1.9 on postoperative day two the patient's postoperative course was relatively unremarkable.
The transient decrease in urine output was responsive to fluid boluses and by the day of discharge the patient's creatinine was continuing to trend down to his preoperative baseline.
