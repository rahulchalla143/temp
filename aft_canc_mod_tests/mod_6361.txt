EGD was done showing some clots in the stomach but no active bleeding.
She [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] repeat endoscopy which showed a small separtion in one portion of the esophagastric anatomosis with oozing.
She then [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] exploratory laparotomy on [**11-11**] where a tear in the capusle of the spleen was found, but was not able to be repaired given concerns with disrupting the anastomosis.
She then [**Month/Day (4) 1834**] an arteriogram showing a 6mm splnic pseudoaneurysm.
On [**11-20**], she [**Month/Day (4) 1834**] CT chest, which only showed moderate pleural effusions.
During this time a CT abdomen, demonstrated perforation of the GE junction by the NG tube.
Gastrografin swallow on [**2113-11-23**] showed a contained anastomotic leak to the left of the remaining stomach measuring approx 6x3cm.
She then developed respiratory distress with respiratory rates in 40's, no documented hypoxia.
She was transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on AC 500x 14, FI02 50%, PEEP 5.
An echocardiogram performed revealed an EF 40%, severe diastolic dysfunction, moderate mitral regurgitation, akinesis of the septum and hypokinesis of the inferior wall which could suggest recent MI.

This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..    FLUID CULTURE       GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
[**2113-12-8**] C Diff Toxin: Negative  Studies:  CT abdomen w/ contrast [**2113-11-28**]: 1.
Chest radiograph is recommended for further work-up.
CT Chest [**11-20**]: no PE, bilateral moderal pleural effusion L>R  CXR (Portable AP) [**2113-11-24**]: New esophageal stent.
CXR (Portable AP) [**2113-11-25**]: The esophageal stent, right-sided IJ venous catheter and endotracheal tube are unchanged since stable in position.
EGD [**2113-11-24**]: A large defect was seen at the esophagogastric anastamosis.
ref 1673 Lot [**Numeric Identifier 83544**] (stent placement) Post surgical gastric anatomy was noted.
EKG [**Hospital1 2436**] [**11-6**]: sinus tachy at 106, left axis, deep TWI in V2-V3, TWF in V4-V6, I, AVL, ?
q waves in III, AVF, no ST elevations or depressions EKG [**Hospital1 18**]: TWI in V2-V6  ECHO [**11-27**]: IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
The patient [**Date Range 1834**] transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2113-11-27**] to evaluate why she developed pulmonary edema.
TTE showed Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
Hypokinesis and akinesis seen on Echocardiogram suggested recent MI.
Serial cardiac enzymes were checked and had been negative.
Her rhythm was noted to be VT/VF and a single shock was administered with return of pulse and blood pressure.
She was breathing spontaneuously but her respirations were felt to be feeble and she was intubated for airway protection following femoral line placement and administration of etomidate and succynylcholine.
An ABG at the time showed 7.50/42/128.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia with premature beats and stable TWIs in the anterior precodial leads.
Access was obtained, she became hypotensive and hematocrit steadily dropped from 33.5-> 24.1->19.8 so she was transfused 5 units pRBCs, 1 unit FFP, 1 bag platelets repeat HCT 33.
CT Abdomen revealed large hematoma of spleen.
Tagged RBC scan was done showing active bleed of the spleen.
Increasing creatinine was also thought to be secondary to contrast dye needed for CT.  [**Hospital Unit Name 13533**] [**Date range (3) 83548**]:  Sputum culture grew MRSA, but patient was already being treated with vancomycin.
Repeat CT abdomen and pelvis revealed a large left-sided pleural effusion with collapse of the left lower lobe, small right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, stable  splenic JP drain and infrasplenic fluid collection/hematoma, percutaneous J-tube without evidence of intestinal obstruction and no definitive abscesses.
Right upper extremity ultrasound was performed and was negative for DVT.
