Per [**Hospital1 2025**] d/c summary, pt had done well and his MS had improved since his d/c from [**Hospital1 18**], such that he was conversant w/ family.
CXR revealed patchy air space opacities c/w multifocal pna.

Pt was intubated at [**Hospital1 2025**] for his asp pna, extubated 36h later, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Several [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim tests during this admission showed the patient's adrenal function to be intact.
Patient was evaluated for nonconvulsive seizure disorder by EEG, with prior study [**2145-12-28**] showing subcortical dysfunction but not clear evid of sz activity, first study on this admission [**2146-1-19**] showing cortical and subcortical dysfunction, no clear evid of sz.
A second EEG from this admit on [**1-26**] showed paroxysmal semi-rhythmic epileptiform activity over both frontal regions.
A final EEG during this admit on [**2146-2-3**] showed an area of cortical hypersynchrony likely to be a focus of sz activity, though no such sz activity was observed during the study.
2) Aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis: the patient had at least two likely aspiration events, one prior to his admission to [**Hospital1 2025**] when he was found at [**Hospital1 **] with tube feeds all over his clothing, and a second witnessed event during bronchoscopy at [**Hospital1 2025**].
Pt had completed 28d course of clinda/primaquine and PCP smear was negative at [**Hospital1 2025**].
Initial series of CXRs showed stable diffuse patchy opacification of the right lung.
3) DVT- neg CTA and LENI's here during previous admission; Fragmin started at [**Hospital1 2025**] was dc'd on admission and pt maintained on prophylactic dose heparin.
Then patient's LLE was noted to be swollen on [**2146-1-23**], so LENIs were done that showed b/l DVTs in superficial and common femoral veins.
If his hct stabilizes in the future and he can be re-EGD, anticoagulation might be indicated.
4) Astrocytoma - repeat CT scan [**2146-1-26**] showed a large mass in R temporal lobe extending into R frontal lobe.
No significant change since prior study [**2145-12-29**] with regard to the mass effect on R lateral ventricle; no evid of brainstem compression.
He then began to have melena, external bleeding from his PEG/J site and received transfusions of 5 U PRBC without adequate HCT increase.
EGD showed bleeding around the PEG/J and a string associated with a clot and fresh blood in the duodenum.
Following the procedure, the patient had an IVC filter placed as he has had a DVT and given his bleeding, anticoagulation was not an option.
