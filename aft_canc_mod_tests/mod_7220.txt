CXR was consistent with CHF (BNP [**Numeric Identifier 100467**] range).
CT chest showed stable thyromegaly.
Urine culture/blood cultures showed no growth for many days, and the final results are pending (the patient refused further testing with subsequent fevers).

Ct chest [**5-22**]: 1.
The evaluation for underlying interstitial lung disease is not possible due to superimposed CHF.

It was thought that her CHF was precipitated by fever and atrial fibrillation.
Patients blood and urine cultures were unrevealing.
Transaminitis and cholestasis: Patient showed evidence of a transaminitis upon admission which stabilized, although her bilirubin continued to trend upwards to the low 6 range.
Hepatology also felt that her hepatitis serologies were not consistent with active viral hepatitis.
Her statin was held, and the recommendation was made to the patient that this medication not be restarted.
Thyroid mass: Patient had a stable appearing enlarged thyroid on chest/neck CT with associated lymphadenopathy from [**2113-5-22**].
