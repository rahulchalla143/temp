Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 33344**] is an 81 year old male with PMHx significant for PE (on coumadin), afib, dialated cardiomyopathy (LVEF 55%), valvular heart disease who presents to the ED with GIB in the setting of supratherapeutic INR (22).
He had a brief stay in the MICU until his HCT was stable and then transferred to the medical floor.
## Anemia - He presented with a HCT of 12.5 and confusion for some time per his family and melana.
Given the melana, this was thought to most likely be a upper GI bleed secondary to supratheraputic INR (22 on admission).
His INR was reversed with vitamin K and 4 units of FFP.
An EGD was performed which showed only mild gastritis and no active bleeding.
A colonoscopy showed moderate diverticulosis but also no signs of active bleeding.
His HCT remained stable over several days.
His vital signs were stable.
A head CT was done and a neurology consult was obtained.
The CT scan showed a left superior cerebellar stroke which they felt was subacute.
He was sent for a head CT and CTA which showed a patent cerbellar vasculature, but persistent cerbellar stroke.
## CHF - He had a LVEF of 55% on last echo in [**2110**].
It was restarted briefly once his HCT was stable, but held again given his stroke.
The Ciprofloxacin was discontinued and his WBC trended back up.
This was likely a pre-renal azotemia and resolved with volume expansion with IVF and blood products.
## H/O of PE - Patient with history of PE in [**12-7**] however CTA [**9-8**] did not show any PE.
He was stable on room air throughout admission once his HCT was stabilized.
