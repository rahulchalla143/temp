PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 26.2, her hematocrit was 34.8, and her platelet count was  510.
Differential with neutrophils of 90 percent, bands of 4 percent, lymphocytes of 4 percent, and monocytes of 2 percent.
Her prothrombin time was 19, her partial thromboplastin time was 33.9, and her INR was 2.4.
Her fibrinogen was 343.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 13.
Sodium was 146, potassium was 4.3, chloride was 110, bicarbonate was 24, blood urea nitrogen was 49, creatinine was 1.3, and her blood glucose was 125.
Her calcium was 8.6, her magnesium was 1.9, and her phosphate was 2.7.
Thyroid stimulating hormone was 2.
High- density lipoprotein was 23, her low-density lipoprotein was 58, and her triglycerides were 182.
Her C-reactive protein was 2.47.
Urine culture was consistent with yeast.
Urinalysis was negative.
Further data throughout her admission revealed Gram stain of wound culture obtained on [**2158-6-12**] revealed there were no microorganisms with only 2 plus polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
Aerobic culture was no growth.
Wound culture from [**6-12**]; again, Gram stain was significant 1 plus polymorphonuclear neutrophils and no microorganisms.
Wound culture with no growth.
Aerobic culture with no growth.
Blood cultures from [**2158-6-10**] were no growth.
Blood cultures from [**6-7**] were no growth.
The patient's peak creatine kinase was 54, and her troponin was 0.43.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUES-SYSTEMS:  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed, and her central venous pressure transduced at 20 with a pulmonary artery pressure of 66/32.
The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2158-6-8**] which revealed long axis dimension at 5.9, a four chamber length of 6.4, ejection fraction of 20 percent, a TR gradient of 38 to 42, E:A ratio of 1.3, left atrium that was moderately dilated, right atrium that was moderately dilated, and moderate symmetric LVH.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2158-6-9**] which revealed the following.
Coronary angiography of a right-dominant system revealed moderate two vessel disease.
Resting hemodynamic measurements demonstrated elevated right heart filling pressures.
The right ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 19 mmHg.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension was noted with pulmonary artery pressure of 16/14 mmHg with a calculated peripheral vascular distance of 363 dynes seconds per cm5, and mildly elevated left heart filling pressures, with a mean capillary wedge pressure of 15 mmHg, and a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 14 mmHg.
Left ventriculography revealed severe regional systolic ventricular dysfunction.
The left foot views revealed that there was a hallux valgus deformity.
Infectious Disease also stated that should an aortic valve replacement be necessitated prior to six weeks of intravenous antibiotics, at least two weeks of intravenous antibiotics are recommended and that the ptient should have surveillance blood cultures after this date, and if the patient's blood cultures are negative that the patient could then proceed with aortic valve replacement should it be necessitated before six weeks of antibiotics could be completed.
As stated above, the patient's wound cultures were negative with no growth final.
PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient also underwent magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography of her lower extremities to assess for peripheral vascular disease and to see if she could possibly be a candidate for stenting.
She had a magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography performed on [**2158-6-9**] which revealed the following.
In the left leg, there was a surgical clip in the proximal superficial femoral artery which obscured evaluation of a very focal region of this area.
Her urine was sent, and urine culture was negative.
Her electrolytes were followed and repleted as needed.
Her liver function tests at the [**Hospital1 69**] were within normal limits except a mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase at 130.
It was requested that the outside facility follow her liver function tests while the patient was on oxacillin for right osteomyelitis.
