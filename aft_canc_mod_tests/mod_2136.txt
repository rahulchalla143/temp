Study medication was recently dc'd as ECHO on [**2194-10-20**] showed mildly dilated LA and mod dilated LV (6.1 cm), severe LV hypokinesis with an EF of 15-20% -- patient had dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology, without evidence of effusion.
A CT scan on [**11-28**] on Mr. [**Known lastname **] revealed a pericardial effusion, and an ECHO that day revealed moderate circumferential pericardial effusion (up to 2 cm) with poor EF.
Repeat ECHo on [**12-1**] showed no significant change -- pericardial effusion with large fibrin deposits and masses on the surface of the heart c/w extracardiac metastatic disease,a dn there were no clear echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Metastatic renal cell CA (s/p L nephrectomy [**2181**], metastatic disease detected [**2192**] including R kidney disease) 2.
JVP ~8 cm.

CARDIAC CATH [**12-2**] 1.
THe LMCA, LAD, LCX, and RCA were all without angiographically significant disease.
Resting hemodynamcis demonstrated mildly elevated left sided filling pressures, mean PCWP=13 mmHg, with mildly depressed systemic systolic and diastolic pressures.
Right atrial pressures were significantly elevated with mean RA=19 mmHg, but without loss of the y-descent.
Pericardiocentesis was performed with initial pericardial pressure of 10 mmHg.
After removal of 1080cc of straw colored pericardial fluid, the pericardial pressure fell to 0 mmHg and the mean RA fell to 11 mmHg.
Pericardiocentesis of 1L serosanguinous fluid.
POST-PROCEDURE ECHO Conclusions: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-12-1**], the pericardial effusion is gone.
REPEAT ECHO on day of discharge Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
Compared to the prior study dated (tape reviewed) there is probably no change.
Patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory after earlier CT Scan and ECHO showed evidence of moderate/large pericardial effusion.
In the cath lab, pericardiocentesis was performed with initial pericardial pressure of 10 mmHg.
After removal of 1080cc of straw colored pericardial fluid, the pericardial pressure fell to 0 mmHg and the mean RA fell to 11 mmHg.
Repeat ECHo on day of discharge confirmed no pericardial fluid collection.
B. Coronary angiography showed no evidence of flow limiting lesions or coronary artery disease.
C. Per ECHO [**10-20**], patient with dilated cardiomyopathy and reduced EF 15-20%.
TSH 11, FT4 WNL.
Iron studies without evidence of hemochromatosis.
Outpatient work-up had already been initiated, and continued work-up was deferred to patient's cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] D. Blood Pressure: Patient's blood pressures were asymptomatically in 80s post-procedure while in the CCU.
Creatinine remained stable at 1.2-1.3. .
