(1) Aphasia:  CT head with edema, possibly small punctate foci of hemorrhage in surgical bed, but edema unchanged from prior MRI 2 days ago.
His symptoms were thought to be most consistent with post-ictal aphasia after a seizure than due to edema or stroke.
(2) Glioblastoma Multiforme:  CT head was stable.
His blood pressure was initially controlled with labetalol 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] which was uptitrated to 200 mg [**Hospital1 **].
His blood pressure control stabilized prior to floor transfer.
Your CT head showed no evidence of a stroke but your blood pressures were initially elevated in the emergency room.
