Patient was continued on Lasix and had serial rising BNPs from 723 on [**9-8**] to 1163 on [**9-11**].
On admission initial ABG 7.29/77/237 during Nebulizer treatment, next ABG 7.28/78/163, normal Lactate.
CAD - s/p cath [**2128-7-30**]:stenting of the RCA with 3 overlapping cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]  -[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] [**2128-8-11**]: rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the LAD/LCX.
CHF - EF >55% 2+MR perivalvular, RV dysfunction, moderate pulmonary HTN 4.
MDS 7.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: Temp 98.8 BP 112/60 Pulse 60 Resp 34 O2 sat 98% on 4LNC Gen - Elderly male in moderate respiratory distress.
2+ DP pulses bilaterally Neuro - Confused, not oriented but responsive.
Skin - No rash   Pertinent Results: ECHO ([**2128-9-13**]):Conclusions: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2128-7-22**], there has been no significant change.
PERSANTINE MIBI  [**2128-10-13**] IMPRESSION: A moderate to severe, fixed perfusion defect of the inferior and inferolateral myocardial walls and apex.
Compared to the previous scan, the previously reversible perfusion defect in this region is now fixed and the apical perfusion defect has become more severe.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right-dominant circulation with three-vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mild pulmonary hypertension (39/16 mmHg), minimally elevated filling pressures (mean RA 6 mmHg, mean PCWP 12 mmHg), and a preserved cardiac index of 2.9 L/min/m2.
These represent marked improvement since prior hemodynamic assessment in [**7-28**], although current study was performed with patient receiving intravenous dopamine and nesiritide.
He was in decompensated CHF on exam and we started treatment with Natrecor, Lasix, and dopamine drips.
Pt then underwent right and left heart cath to determine precise fluid status which showed PCWP of 12 and left cath showing 3 vessel dz.
Also, pt's creatinine ranged from ~1.3-2.2, most recently 1.9 at discharge.
# CAD - Upon admission he had a troponin of 0.02, it was likely due to subendocardial ischemia from increased demand.
BP ranged from 90's-100's.
BP meds were held for BP less than 100.
Restarted Carvedilol after dopamine stopped and BP back up to baseline.
While he was in the hospital we continued his iron and folate therapy.
He received 2 transfusions during the hospital stay for HCT <28.
Hemolysis panel was again positive with high LDH, low haptoglobin, however with normal bilirubin.
The echo does not show any change in the perivalvular leakage of the mitral valve, and it was unlcear why his anemia has progressed.
His Hct was as low as 21 and required multiple transfusion to keep the Hct>30.
After getting the increased EPO dose, pt 's Hct remained stable at 30-34 with increased retic count.
IV iron was held since pt was able to hold his Hct without it.
# Rhythm  - He has chronic afib s/p VVI pacer [**2128-8-12**].
Blood cultures were checked to rule out endocarditis and were all negative.
He needs to have his INR 2.5-3.5 for the mechanical valve.
Pt's INR was therapeutic at Coumadin 13 mg qd.
He should have INR periodically checked until INR stable at therapeutic level.
He got a stat head CT to evaluate for possible bleed or stroke which was normal.
Blood cultures and Urine cultures were sent with concern of a infectious etiology.
All sedating meds were held given the history of recent sedation for colonoscopy immediately prior to change in MS.  His ABG indicated hypercarbia which could be causing his change in MS.  His oxygen was decreased and he was maintained at an O2 sat between 92-94%.
# Ileus - Upon initial evaluation he was seen to have enlarged bowel loops on abdominal x-ray.
Heparin gtt was stopped when INR therapeutic.
