Her cranial nerves are unremarkable, and her motor exam is nonfocal.

CT Head w/o contrast ([**2125-8-31**]): Expected postoperative changes with small amount of blood within surgical resection cavity and along left cerebral hemisphere.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] w/ and w/o contrast ([**2125-9-1**]): Postoperative changes are seen in the left temporal region with blood products and air in the surgical cavity.
CT Head w/o contrast ([**2125-9-2**]): 1.
CT Head [**2125-9-3**]: In comparison with the prior examination, again there is evidence of pneumoencephalus and similar pattern of hemorrhage with edema producing effacement of the left ambient cistern.
The orbits, the mastoid air cells, and the visualized aspects of the paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable.
Low- attenuation areas are again demonstrated as well as hemorrhagic foci adjacent to the left ambient cistern apparently unchanged since the prior study and suggesting edema and ischemic changes, please correlate clinically.
CT Head [**2125-9-6**]: FINDINGS: There is again no significant interval change.
Despite her excellent clinical course, post-operative MRI revealed swelling of the tumor resection site -- causing a right-[**Hospital1 **] midline shift.
Subsequent serial CT revealed gradual resolution of the swelling.
- You need to have a non-contrast CT scan of the brain prior to the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic appointment.
