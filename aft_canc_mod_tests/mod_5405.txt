Compared to the previous tracing of [**2115-12-25**] no significant change.
Intervals	Axes Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T 77	152	86	[**Telephone/Fax (2) 70523**]	  Imaging: Head CT [**1-23**]: IMPRESSION: Interval increase in size of patient's known left cerebellar hemorrhagic mass with surrounding vasogenic edema.
An MRI is recommended for further evaluation.
CT C-Spine [**1-23**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Further imaging on a non-emergent basis may be obtained as deemed clinically necessary.
MRI Head [**1-24**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CTA Head [**1-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
If there is no history of trauma, bone scan may be beneficial to exclude osseous metastases.
MRI Head [**2-3**](post-op): IMPRESSION: Status post left occipital craniotomy.
Blood products identified in the surgical bed.
Followup MRI is recommended to demonstrate any further change or stability in the pattern of enhancement in the surgical area.
Head CT [**2-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Bilateral Knee images [**2-4**]: IMPRESSION: No acute fracture detected on either side.
RUQ Ultrasound [**2-5**]: IMPRESSION: Limited study but with normal portal and hepatic veins.
He underwent MRI which revealed progression of the previously seen lesion.
CTA/V of the head was performed which demonstrated no evidence of venous sinus thrombosis.
On [**2-1**], post-operative MRI was performed and he was subsequently extubated.
MRI revealed a gross total resection of the lesion.
On [**2-2**], his coagulation studies were found to be slightly elevated.
Repeat speach and swallow study was perfomed, but due to agitation, and complaince, they were not able to complete their examination.
However routine CBC evaluation revealed a white blood count of 40, which had doubled in 24hrs.
All work up were negative including a stool specimen for C. diff.
His peripheral IV infiltrated and he had no access.
His heart rate temporarily decreased from 140 to 120s but that only lasted a short time.
While his blood pressure had subsequently stabilized, he subsequently suffered ARDS with progressive worsening of his ventilation status.
Because of volume overload, he was started on CVVH for ARF.
