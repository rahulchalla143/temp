Imaging TTE [**9-24**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CXR [**9-24**]: FINDINGS:  ET tube to be 6.5 cm  above the carina; retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis.
CXR [**9-26**]: post-extubation FINDINGS: bilateral atelectasis that is unchanged in extent.
CTA chest [**9-24**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Recommend correlation with prior exams once available and short-term followup if prior exams are not available.
He was reliant on pressors overnight but was weaned successfully and was maintaining good blood pressures within the next post-operative day.
An intra-operative ECHO at the time showed no pericardial effusion, embolus or other significant abnormality; EF was preserved at 75%.
A CT-angiogram of the chest also did not show any acute changes, including that of pulmonary embolus or other etiology to explain his intraoperative hypotension.
As noted earlier, his ECHO demonstrated no clear etiology to his hypotension.
The patient was placed back on his metoprolol and while on the floor the subsequent few days, was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint with a HR in the 80s-90s and SBP within normal range.
His vital signs were routinely monitored via telemetry.
Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
As cited, his chest CT-angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolus.
He was extubated POD#1, and maintained good oxygen saturations on nasal cannula in the upper 90's as well as without additional O2 requirement upon discharge.
His vital signs were monitored routinely.
His sugars normalized to the mid 100s prior to discharge on both lantus and sliding scale insulin.
Medications on Admission: - Glipizide, Metformin, Omeprazole, Lopressor, 5-FU.
You initially had lower blood pressures than your normal pressures, which required some higher-level care and medications, but these were managed well.
If you notice these symptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room for evaluation if these symptoms are severe.
