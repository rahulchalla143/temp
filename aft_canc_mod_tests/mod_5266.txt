# GI bleed: The patient was noted to have a hematocrit drop from  32 to 17.4 in the setting of supratherapeutic INR of 6.1.
He had recent admission for HCT drop and upper endoscopy which showed a non-bleeding duodenal polyp and a small hiatal hernia.
The EGD showed a small hernia but was otherwise normal with no identifiable source of bleeding.
A capsule endoscopy was then performed and the results were not available at the time of discharge (plan to be read week of [**12-31**]).
He remained hemodynamically stable with stable blood count on serial hematocrits (HCT of 27 morning of discharge).
At discharge, heart rate noted to be regular with sinus rhythm on EKG.
# Possible Bacteremia - blood cultures on [**12-24**], drawn in setting of temp to 100.6, with one out of four bottles positive for Gram + rods and Gram + cocci.
Surveillance cultures are negative to date.
He did have a + troponin at the last admission.
His EKG was unremarkable and his troponin plateaued at 0.07.
# Aortic mechanical valve:  Noted to have supratherapeutic INR of 6.1 on admission (normally his goal INR is 2.5-3.5).
He was given 4 units of FFp, but no vitamin K. INR trended down and was 1.2 at discharge.
He was started on heparin drip after hematocrit stabalized and INR subtherapeutic.
He will need to be on heparin bridge until INR therepeutic (goal 2.5-3.5).

The gastroenterologists evaluated you and did an EGD (upper endoscopy) which showed a small hernia but was otherwise normal.
You undewerwent a video capsule study and will follow up with gastroenterology as an outpatient for the results.
Your blood counts remained stable and there was no further evidence of active gastrointestinal bleeding.
You were given a medication called metoprolol to control your heart rate from going too fast.
Blood cultures grew bacteria, for which we started antibiotics.
We have made the following changes to your medications: - START taking heparin until your coumadin level is therapeutic - START taking vancomycin for bacteria in the blood - START TAKING metoprolol succinate for heart rate - STOP TAKING carvedilol - STOP TAKING bactrim    Followup Instructions: Department: HEMATOLOGY/BMT When: TUESDAY [**2160-1-1**] at 1:30 PM With: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3919**], RNC [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3241**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) **] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: HEMATOLOGY/BMT When: TUESDAY [**2160-1-1**] at 1:30 PM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7779**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3241**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) **] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Please call your gastoenterology physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
