A CXR was obtained and demonstrated a retrocardiac density; additional workup revealed left pleural effusion and prominent mediastinal lymphadenopathy, as well as a 14x12x6cm left retroperitoneal mass, which was displacing the left kidney and spleen.
A CT-guided biopsy was performed on [**2102-11-15**], which revealed only fat necrosis and inflammation.
Subsequent evaluation at the [**Company 2860**] culminated in Mr. [**Known lastname 349**] being scheduled for a left nephrectomy, splenectomy, and possible colon resection in addition to removal of the tumor on [**2103-1-2**].
Repeat CT-guided core biopsy on [**2103-1-4**] was again nondiagnostic.
He presented on [**5-9**] for pre-operative evaluation and optimization of his cardiac and pulmonary status prior to resection of his retroperitoneal mass with lymph node biopsy.
Pertinent Results: Echo [**2103-5-10**]:  IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with moderate global systolic dysfunction.

Echocardiogram was performed for baseline evaluation, and demonstrated an EF of 40%, and moderate tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, as well as significant systolic pumonary hypertension.
A bowel prep was performed the night before surgery, and informed consent was obtained.
He also received 3u FFP post-operatively for an INR of 1.7.
On POD1, [**5-12**], echocardiogram revealed a LVEF of 20%, and he was started on dobutamine with improvement in his EF.
Urine output continued to be stable around 20cc/h, with an expected rise in his creatinine to 2.8.
He was succesfully extubated, with oxygen saturation levels stable on 4L NC.
Creatinine trended upward to 2.9, but urine output remained stable.
He was evaluated by electrophysiology, and as his pacemaker was now pacing 90% of the time, the pacing rate was increased to 60 bpm.
On [**5-19**], an abdominal ultrasound was obtained to evaluate for reaccumulation of ascitic fluid, given the large amount drained intraoperatively.
His PTT was still elevated at 54.1, likely due to his significantly reduced renal function with a creatinine stable at 2.6. .
Upon return to the floor, the drain was left to gravity drainage, with a subsequent 10 liters of milky output by midnight.
His creatinine was stable at 2.6.
On [**5-23**], the abdominal drain was allowed to drain 4 liters with significantly less output via his abdominal incision.
