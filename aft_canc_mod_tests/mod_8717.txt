A post-operative chest x-ray revealed a small L apical pneumothorax which was not unexpected given that the pleura had been breached during surgery.
Subsequent x-rays confirmed that the pneumothorax was stable, and on POD#3, it was found to have decreased in size.
On post-operative day (POD)#0-1, serial cardiac enzymes and ECGs were obtained.
A chest x-ray obtained after the removal of the chest tube showed no change in size of the previously noted pneumothorax.
A swallow evaluation revealed no signs of aspiration, and the patient's hoarseness resolved fully on POD#3.
