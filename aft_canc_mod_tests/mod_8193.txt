A CXR showed RUL consolidation which was interpreted as possible pulmonary contusion.

Incidentally he was found to have a pulmonary nodule and a CT was reccomended.

U/S and MRI was performed to assess Liver and pancreatic lesions and it was felt, with conjunction of IP and IR that biopsing the lung would be the best route.
Patient went for bronchial lung biopsy on [**7-18**] wihtout complications.
An abdominal MRI revealed multiple liver masses believed to be benign cysts and others that are hemangiomas.
After lung biopsy and pending results, it will need to be determined whether to biopsy the pancreas since the tail of the pancreas is more likely to be a primary than metastatic.
# Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has non-ischemic idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 15%; it is still unknown as to primary etiology.
# Anemia: The patient's admission hematocrit was 44.0 and his discharge hematocrit was 35.8.
His nadir was 29.5 on [**2168-7-13**].
Transitional issues: # Outpatient oncologic workup: He will follow up with outpatient oncology at the VA for a body PET-CT, brain MRI, PFTs, and spirometry with DLCO (this will be set up with the patient's cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 77893**].
Transitional issues: Follow up on anemia as his Hct dropped during the hospital course but rebounded at discharge.
Recommend check CBC once to ensure it has normalized.
The masses were better characterized on MRI and it was felt that biopsy of the lung was the best method for tissue diagnosis.
A biopsy was taken Monday [**7-18**] by an interventional pulmonlogist.
Followup Instructions: Please make an appointment with your cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 112517**], by calling ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 112518**] and paging [**Numeric Identifier 112519**].
