When he was hospitalized for allogeneic transplant in this [**Month (only) 116**], his hospital course was complicated by fever, with positive blood cultures with Staph, coag(-)from his hickman.
His immune suppression is FK-506 and CellCept.
In ED,VS T 100.6, BP 145/88, HR 135, RR 20, O2 sat 100% on RA.
Bone marrow biopsy showed ~ 40% plasma cells and the presence of a hypogammaglobulinemia.
He was also found to be mildly anemic with hematocrit of between 35 and 40.
His beta-2 microglobulin was 2.3.
Noted for disease progression on BM bx in [**2133**] and was treated on the multiple myeloma/dendritic cell vaccine trial in [**7-/2134**] and taken off study due to progression of disease.
Noted for disease progression/persistence with bone marrow aspirate and biopsy revealing approximately 80% plasma cells.
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy from [**2136-12-24**]: Normocellular erythroid dominant marrow with persistent involvement by patient's known plasma cell myeloma.
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy from [**2137-3-18**] shows a normocellular erythroid dominant bone marrow with trilineage ematopoiesis with persistent involvement by known plasma cell myeloma.
Vague history of cancer on father's side Mother: COPD  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 99 HR 99, BP 128/80 RR 20 98%RA Gen: well nourished comfortable man in NAD HEENT: anicteric eyes, OP clear with no lesions, no cervical or axillary [**Doctor First Name **] Chest: CTA b/l Heart: RRR no m/r/g Abdomen: soft, NT, ND +BS Extr:no edema 2+DPs Skin: no lesions Neuro: A+Ox3 CNs intact.
An LP was performed and was WNL.
Peripheral smear was notable for blasts and plasma cells, and a bone marrow biopsy was performed which showed involvement by lambda-restricted plasma cell dyscrasia, [**Last Name (un) **] immunoreactive, worrisome for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and hypercellular bone marrow.
Chimer studies showed the presence of both cord blood lines as well as the patient's own cells.
Colonoscopy was benign.
Pt's hematocrit trended down as the frequency of melanotic stools increased.
It is possible - and even likely, that there was a combination of contrast nephropathy, MM, pre-renal, hepato-renal, and possibly even direct involvement by BK, EBV, or PTLD.
He was placed on CVVH which he tolerated better, and effectively removed the extra fluid volume and helped to reverse his metabolic acidosis.
Acute Hepatitis: Biopsy showed diffuse involvement by large B cells consistent with PTLD.
Liver enzymes continued to rise and pt became very thrombocytopenic/coagulopathic.
Pt showed signs of low-grade bleeding.
Spleen was also enlarged by CT and U/S.
Increasing O2 demand and respiratory failure: Pt had increasing O2 demand in the context of bilateral infiltrates on CT and diffuse infiltrates.
Bronchoscopy showed lambda restricted B cells believed to be consistent with pulmonary involvement by PTLD.
