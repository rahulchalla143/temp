Pathology from pleural fluid returned positive for B cell lymphoma.
The pathology of supraclavicular node biopsy which was done as an outpatient prior to admission also was consistent with B cell lymphoma.
One day prior to transport, the patient had worsening shortness of breath and was ruled out for a pulmonary embolism for CT angio.
She also had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed normal cardiac function.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.9, heart rate 92, blood pressure 108/63, respirations 28, oxygen saturation 98% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
Extremities:  No edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally, 2+ radial pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White cell count 13.3, hematocrit 35.7, platelets 273,000.
PT 15, INR 1.5.
Sodium 133, potassium 4.5, chloride 95, bicarbonate 23, BUN 43, creatinine 1.4.
ALT 40, AST 28, LDH 75, alkaline phosphatase 64, amylase 26, lipase 14, total bilirubin 1.2, CK 25, albumin 2.8, troponin less than 0.01.
Uric acid 15.
Cyclosporin level 270.
White cell count 1,215, 40 red blood cells, no polys, 4 lymphs, total protein 2.0, glucose 107, LD 341.
ABG drawn on 4 liters of nasal cannula returned at 7.38, 42, and 37.
Echocardiogram done in [**2129-10-22**] was normal.
A CT of the chest was done on [**2131-10-20**] which showed massive axillary, mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy, with bilateral pleural effusions and collapse of posterior left lower lobe.
CTA was done on [**2131-10-21**] and showed no pulmonary embolism.
LYMPHOMA:  Diagnosed by chest CT confirmed by supraclavicular node biopsy and malignant cells and pleural effusion tap, large B cell lymphoma was positive for EBV virus, Burkitt's type with 100% cells dividing.
Tumor lysis laboratories were followed every six hours.
The urine output was maintained at 80-100 cc per hour.
On day number four post chemotherapy, [**2131-10-28**], a CT of the chest was obtained to evaluate for the interval change.
All lymph nodes have decreased in size in general.
During the course of her ICU stay on [**2131-10-26**], another attempt was made at therapeutic thoracentesis; however despite large pleural effusions bilaterally on the chest x-ray only 10-15 cc of fluid were obtained.
Follow-up CT done on [**2131-10-29**] showed growing large pleural effusions as well as persisting multiple lymph nodes, described above.
Her other positive cultures included urine and sputum yeast speciated as [**Female First Name (un) 564**] on [**2131-11-4**].
GASTROINTESTINAL/FLUIDS ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  As above, the patient developed abdominal pain with KUB consistent with ileus on [**2131-10-28**].
This was followed by abdominal CT scan which showed dilated sigmoid colon and significant thickening of the jejunum.
The last echocardiogram was done on [**2131-10-31**] and showed hyperdynamic left ventricular function with mild outflow obstruction and mild pulmonary artery hypertension, both new compared with a previous study.
The patient's creatinine remained stable for the first seven days; however, subsequently, it started rising in the setting of some tumor lysis, multiorgan failure, multiple nephrotoxic medications, and likely renal hyperperfusion.
She received blood transfusions to maintain hematocrit above 28.
Her INR remained elevated despite vitamin K administration.
Laboratory data was consistent with chronic diffuse intravascular coagulation.
