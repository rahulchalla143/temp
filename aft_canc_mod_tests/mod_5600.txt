In the Emergency Department the patient was found to have a temperature of 100, pulse 114, blood pressure 163/92, respiratory rate 18, saturating 96% on room air.
She had a chest x-ray that was significant for compression of the right lower lobe bronchus and multiple diffuse pulmonary nodules.
She had a KUB which showed no evidence of small bowel obstruction.
She also had an abdominal CT which was significant for a subacute liver hematoma which was 6 x 10 cm in size.
The patient also had a chest CT which showed multiple pulmonary nodules and a small right-sided pleural effusion.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Weight 199.2 pounds, temperature 99.8, pulse 112, blood pressure 138/76, respiratory rate 28, pulse oximetry 95% on room air.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, poor respiratory effort.
LABORATORY DATA:  At the time of admission her white blood cell count was 20, hematocrit 30 (down from 42 in [**2102-2-11**]), platelet count 291, MCV 85, sodium 119, potassium 4.5, chloride 81, bicarbonate 21, BUN 15, creatinine 0.7, glucose 139, urine osmolality 544, urine sodium less than 10.
Differential on the white blood cell count showed neutrophils 89%, lymphocytes 6.8%, monocytes 4.4%, eosinophils 0.1%.
Abdominal CT, chest CT as noted in history of present illness.
Hyponatremia:  Patient with a history of psychogenic polydipsia in the past, however given that her urine osmolalities are high, question of syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone secondary to pulmonary metastases, however low urine sodium also points to potential prerenal or intravascular volume etiology.
The patient was asymptomatic and seemed to maintain a sodium between 125 and 135.
The patient had her urine sodium and osmolality checked on multiple occasions and her urine sodium was usually low and urine osmolalities were usually high.
Shortness of breath:  The patient was intermittently treated with oxygen via nasal cannula and maintained oxygen saturations greater than 92% during her hospital course.
The patient initially had a bronchoscopy by the interventional pulmonary service, however the biopsy results showed scant fragment sof bronchial mucosa and alveolated parenchyma without evidence of malignancy.
However this biopsy seemed to be insufficient for diagnosis.
The patient was seen by the CT surgery service and eventually had a video-assisted thoracoscopic procedure with drainage of a right hydropneumothorax, pleurodesis, pulmonary biopsy and two chest tubes that were placed.
The patient had her chest tubes pulled on [**2102-3-25**] and chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumothorax or residual fluid.
Preliminary results of the pulmonary biopsy revealed a carcinoma that was likely not pulmonary in etiology and it was likely metastatic from her ovarian cancer.
Pneumonia:  On the patient's initial chest x-ray and chest CT the patient had a question of a right lower lobe collapse versus consolidation.
Her pleural fluid Gram stain and culture were also negative.
She had a benign abdominal examination with only minimal amounts of right upper and right lower quadrant tenderness.
The patient had a repeat abdominal CT on [**2102-3-15**] which showed that the patient was actively bleeding from her hematoma into her peritoneum.
However, subsequent blood cultures remained negative that were drawn from the Port-a-Cath and the patient was treated with intravenous vancomycin.
Gradually increasing white blood cell count:  The patient initially had a gradual decrease in her white blood cell count on the azithromycin, however her white blood cell count started to rise and was 22 on [**3-16**], gradually increasing to a maximum of 45 on [**2102-3-23**].
She did have one stool for C. difficile which was sent subsequent to the initiation of antibiotics, which was negative for C. difficile.
However given that the patient had improvement in the white blood cell count on Flagyl, however was concomitantly on Zosyn, it is unclear which antibiotic was contributing to her decreasing white blood cell count and the decision was made with consultation of the infectious disease service, to continue full courses of both the Zosyn and the Flagyl.
for several days and on fluid restriction, the patient had an elevated creatinine of 1.6, was found to be prerenal.
As the patient was intravascularly volume depleted the patient was treated with intravenous fluid hydration and eventually her creatinine improved to 1.0 which is her baseline.
If pulmonary biopsy result returned as ovarian carcinoma plans for outpatient chemotherapy with carboplatin would be initiated.
If pulmonary biopsy revealed secondary primary metastatic cancer the patient would likely be made comfort care.
Preliminary biopsy results returned as ovarian carcinoma.
