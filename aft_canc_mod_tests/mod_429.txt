In ED, afebrile, BP 107/70, HR 102, RR 16, 95% RA  although he reportedly had labile HR in the ED, ranging from 80s to 140s as well as O2 desaturation requiring 4L of NC.
He was found to have ARF with a Cr of 1.7 (from BL 1.0), and BUN in 50s.
Hct was 30 at his baseline.
In the MICU, he was made NPO and started on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] and repeat Hct had dropped to 24.7 so he received 2 unit of PRBCs with post-transfusion Hct of 27.
Repeat Hct his afternoon again down to 25.7 with repeat 25.
Cr peaked at 2.5 and repeat this afternoon 2.4.
He has remained hemodynamically stable with normal blood pressure and no tachycardia.

Family History: [**Name (NI) 12237**] HTN [**Name (NI) 12238**] "oxygen problems" ([**Name2 (NI) 1818**]) Daughter- lung cancer  Physical Exam: T: 97.4 BP: 125/52 HR: 86 RR: 19 O2 98% RA Gen: Pleasant, cachectic male, chronically ill appearing, NAD HEENT: Pale conjunctiva.
# Coffee ground emesis: Patient had initial Hct drop although he had no recurrent hematemesis.
He underwent upper endoscopy which revealed an ulcer at the GE junction with clot but no evidence of active bleeding.
His Hct remained stable after 4 units of PRBCs.
A CTU was obtained which showed nonspecific bladder wall thickening but was otherwise unremarkable.
Initially concern for obstructive pathology given clots and hematuria but renal u/s showed only unlateral hydronephrosis.
Thought to be most likely pre-renal ARF due to acute GI bleed which resolved to IVF and blood transfusions.
He had a CTU performed which showed renal cysts without other abnormality.
Given known GU pathology, would make this most likely source although U/A was unrevealing and urine cultures were negative.
CXR without obvious infiltrate although known lung nodule could predispose to pneumonia or superinfection.
WBC count trended down and he received a 7 day course of cipro.
# COPD: no spirometry in our system but severe emphysema on CT chest 10/[**2188**].
