[**2100-11-14**] - MRI head without contrast IMPRESSION: 1.
- HIDA Gallbladder scan IMPRESSION: Cholestasis with poor excretion of radiotracer into the biliary tree.
[**2100-11-23**] - CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast IMPRESSION: 1.
3.3 cc x 2.4 trv x 2.6 ap CM lesion in the right thyroid gland which was described on CT [**2100-11-11**], but new since [**9-4**].
- CT guided drainage of right-sided perianastomotic fluid collection Impression: 1.
Successful placement of an 8-French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] pigtail catheter within the fluid collection.
Colorectal surgery evaluated patient for possible infection of the fluid collection and sent a swab that was done around the fluid collection, and it was unable to be probed through.
The bronchoscopy and BAL was unrevealing except for possible CMV, but it was thought to be non-specific given his transplant status.
Hence, had further MRI imaging of the head to rule out intracranial process and neurology consult.
Patient was on Digoxin and Metoprolol - discontinued when heart rates dropped to the 30s.
MRI C-spine without findings of cord compression.
