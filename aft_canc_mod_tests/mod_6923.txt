Head CT [**5-29**]: Left subdural hematoma involving the entire left convexity and left middle cranial fossa, with subfalcine herniation to the right of [**2-2**] mm.
B/L LENIs [**5-29**]: neg PCXR [**5-29**]: Clear lungs.
CT C-spine [**5-30**]: Severe degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
Anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 is likely secondary to degenerative changes .
EEG [**6-1**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of  bursts of sharp slowing and delta frequency slowing over the entire left hemisphere and increased voltage gradient over the left hemisphere throughout the recording.
MRI [**6-2**]: No acute infarcts.
Carotids [**6-2**]: No evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis in the carotid arteries bilaterally.
KUB [**6-4**]: 1.
ECHO [**6-4**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
CTA [**6-5**]: 1.
Head CT [**6-6**]: No change since the prior examination in the size of the small left subdural collection, status post evacuation of a subdural hematoma.
Head CT [**6-9**]: Stable appearance of a small left subdural collection status post evacuation of a subdural hematoma.
Due to his significant pronator drift and cofounding MS which could impaired his exam he was consented for a left sided craniotomy for subdural evacuation.
A head CT postoperatively showed subdural removed with air in the space.
On POD#1 he was found to have right sided weakness and a repeat head CT showed some reaccumulation of blood in the subdural space he was transferred to the neurological floor.
On POD#2 he was found to have garbled speech and significant right sided hemi-paresis, he was brought for an emergent head CT which showed stable amount of blood.
An MRI done was of poor quality but did not show stroke.
An EKG showed normal sinus rhythm.
A chest Xray was done and showed right infrahilar mass that on a followup CT was shown to be insignificant stable findings from previous studies.
An EEG was done and showed no epileptiform focus.
His vital signs remained stable.
On POD#3 the neuro exam improved in the morning to a&ox3, but again fluctuated to disoriented and aphasic aphasic during the day.
His temperature spiked to 101.7 and he had a fever workup that was negative for a source of infection.
He had caroted duplex studies that showed no significant stenosis.
An echo showed no cardiac abnormalities.
A chest CT report came back that suggested a possibility of PE, although motion artifact limited the study.
On POD#4 his neuro exam again improved and stayed stable during the day.
On POD#5 His neuro exam and vitals remained stable.
KUB was ordered to assess bowel obstruction which showed a 12cm dilated cecum and dilated loops of large bowel.
CTA showed multiple subsegmental pulmonary emboli.
His neuro exam and vitals remained stable.
POD#7 head CT unchanged from prior.
POD#8 repeat KUB improved and rectal tube was removed.
POD#9 continued coumadin, INR was still subtherapeutic.
Repeat head CT was unchaged.
POD#11 am INR 3.1, patient discharged to rehab.
Plan to continued to hold warfarin and follow INR downtrend.
Likely resume on pm [**6-11**] with goal INR 2.0 (lower end of therapuetic range).

Please have your INR check at least twice weekly with GOAL INR 2.0.
Watch incision for redness, drainage, bleeding, swelling or fever greater than 101.5  Followup Instructions: Follow up in 6 weeks with a head CT and appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 106639**] [**Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital 4695**] clinic.
