His dermatologist, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7493**], D.O., removed it on [**2150-5-8**] and it showed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10834**] level III melanoma.
He then underwent a wide excision on [**2150-6-5**] and the pathology specimen reportedly has clean margins.
He was well until [**2154-8-10**] when he experienced mid-frontal squeezing headaches with an intensity of [**2155-3-13**].
A head CT showed a mass in the left frotnal brain.
This was followed up with a gadolinium-enhanced head MRI on [**2154-9-17**] at [**State **] Center that showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left frontal brain involving the dura.
He underwent cyberknife but followup imaging revealed persistent metastasis.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: Pre-op:  Temperature is 98.0 F.  Heart rate is 80.
Respiratory rate is 16.
Blood pressure is 126/76.
Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythms.
His muscle strengths are [**5-13**] at all muscle groups.
His reflexes are 2- bilaterally.
His ankle jerks are 2-.
Sensory examination is intact to touch and proprioception.
Coordination examination does not reveal appendicular dysmetria or truncal ataxia.
Pertinent Results: [**2156-1-23**] MRA brain  [**2156-1-23**]: Head CT 1.
Unchanged degree of leftward midline shift secondary to vasogenic edema compared to the preoperative MR.  [**2156-1-24**]: CT torso 1.
[**2156-1-24**] MRI brain Status post left cranioplasty and metastatic resection on the left frontal lobe with decrease in the amount of air with persistent fluid level consistent with CSF and hematocrit.
CT head showed post-op chnages and persistent edema.
MRI was also performed, demonstrating resection of mass.
CT torso ruled out other metastatic lesions.
You will need a CT scan of the brain with / without contrast.
