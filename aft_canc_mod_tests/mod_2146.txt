Further incubation showed contamination with mixed skin/genital flora.
Urine Legionella Ag: Negative  Blood Cx [**2117-2-9**], [**2117-2-12**], [**2117-2-13**], [**2117-2-14**] all negative.
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2117-2-22**], [**2117-2-24**]): FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
STUDIES: [**2117-2-9**] Portable CXR - 1.
[**2117-2-9**] ECG - NSR at ~125 bpm, normal axis, RBBB, unchanged from prior.
ECHO [**2117-2-16**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
CT CHEST HIGH RES W/O CONTRAST [**2117-2-16**]: IMPRESSION: Findings likely represent hypersensitivity pneumonitis or pulmonary edema.
CXR AP [**2117-2-16**]: Heart size is normal.
CT chest high res revealed diffuse ground glass opacities most c/w hypersensitivity pneumonititis.
An echo with bubble study also revealed a patent foramen ovale.
CT chest high res revealed diffuse ground glass opacities most c/w hypersensitivity pneumonititis.
An echo with bubble study also revealed a patent foramen ovale.
Tele captured possible SVT during these paroxysmal tachycardia, and 12-lead EKG confirmed AVNRT.
# Urinary tract infection: Patient's urine culture grew out pan-sensitive Klebsiella and Enterococcus.
