GIB: Given negative NG lavage, guiaic positive reddish brown stools on rectal, likely lower GI bleed; however, may also be oozing from upper GI tract given supratherapeutic INR of 4.3.
On [**2138-11-17**] the pt went for EGD/colonoscopy which showed diverticuloses in colon and two polyps which were removed with pathology as above.
The prep was considered limited and GI recommended a repeat colonoscopy for further evaluation as well as a capsule endoscopy to evaluate the small bowel in the near future.
Pain was only an occasional complaint during admission and was relieved with small amts of narcotics, lidocaine patches, and Tylenol.
A level was measured at 0.8.
Rate was also controlled with Propanolol which was added back when her Hct was stable and it was clear she was not bleeding.
Her INR was 4.3 on admission and 1.2 by discharge.
We stopped her Coumadin in the setting of bleed, she has high CHADS2 and will likely need to be restarted soon, but with the understanding that she has now had at least 2 falls.
She had a GI bleed and her Hct was stable on d/c, please check a Hct and make sure it is steady.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after a fall in which you injured your knees.
During your evaluation you were noted to have a drop in your blood level and were also noted to have blood coming from your GI tract.
The bowel prep was poor and your GI tract was not properly visualized, however your colon was seen to have diverticuli and also several polyps were removed.
The GI doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 2985**] a repeat colonoscopy with a better prep was warranted in the future.
You will need to follow up with your primary care physician (PCP) to asssess your blood pressure and whether you need to restart these meds.
Your insulin regimen was also made less aggressive as it was seen that your blood sugars were occasionally too low.
You should continue to monitor your blood sugars and follow up with your PCP to evaluate your sugars--they may need to be increased or decreased accordingly.
