The NG tube, epidural catheter, and the foley were removed on POD#3.
She continued to feel abdominal discomfort the following day and she required fluid boluses for blood pressure control on the night of POD#[**7-16**].
She then began to develop abdominal pain, with a CT scan on the morning of [**9-26**] that demonstrated that she was leaking on the basis of a presumed enteric dehiscence from either the pancreatic, biliary or duodenojejunostomy anastomoses.
Cycled cardiac enzymes at that time were negative and an echo performed later was unchanged from previous reports with a normal LVEF.
A head CT revealed bilateral effacement of the occipital sulci.
MRI showed bilateral occipital signal abnormalities consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.
An MRA as well as bilateral carotid ultrasound showed no pathology.
