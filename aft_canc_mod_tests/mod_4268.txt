Imaging: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2136-12-19**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2136-12-19**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT LOW EXT W/O C LEFT Study Date of [**2136-12-19**] 1.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of [**2136-12-20**] IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
FEMUR (AP & LAT) LEFT Study Date of [**2136-12-20**] Five images obtained during fluoroscopy of the open reduction internal fixation of the distal femoral fracture were reviewed.
The study demonstrates the sequential process of open reduction internal fixation.
The fixation plate and the screw devices appears to be unremarkable.
FOOT AP,LAT & OBL LEFT Study Date of [**2136-12-25**] 1.
ECHO Study Date [**2136-12-25**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
ECHO was suboptimal but did not show systolic dysfunction.
She is currently touch down weight bearing on the left lower extremity.
# LLL effusion:  Seen on CXR [**12-23**].
A video study showed that she was retaining food in her esophagus.
An endoscopy was performed which did not show a reason for this problem.
Timolol Maleate 0.25 % Drops Sig: [**1-27**]  Ophthalmic [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day).
Her heart rate was below 100.
We performed an endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy.
This is to control your blood pressure and heart rate.
It is very important to take this because it helps to prevent the formation of blood clots.
If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, severe nausea, vomiting, new redness, increased swelling, pain, drainage, have a temperature >101, or have any symptoms that you are concerned about, please call your doctor or go to the emergency room for evaluation.
