Was seen in clinic today in routine follow up where VS were wnl- at that time  BP 100/58 mmHg Pulse 71 Temp 97.4 ?????
In OSH ED, alert and hemodynamicaly stable w/ VS: T 97.0, BP 105/46, HR 53, RR 16, O2 sat 99% on RA.
Labs were notable for hyponatremia to 128, hyperkalemia to 6.4, creatinine of 4.5 and bicarb of 18.
Lipase was 105.
He underwent CT head and C spine- negative for acute bleed, but showed concern for fracture at T1 involving R pedicle.
His forehead laceration was cleaned and repaired w/ sutures and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 96.5 BP 110/57 HR 66 RR 18 O2 sat 94% on RA.
Fast exam negative, no pericardial effusion on bedside ultrasound.
UCx, and blood culture were sent.
He underwent pan CT scan of head, C-spine, and torso which in prelim showed no fractures, but some fluid/stranding at the pancreas.
Surgery was consulted who remarked that CT abd findings were unlikely to be related to trauma,  and that the pt may have some pancreatitis- they recommended repeat CT Abd w/ PO contrast.
Pt was admitted to MICU7 for further management- VS on transfer were: HR 67 BP 119/63 RR 16 O2 sat 100% on 500 x 16 PEEP 5 FIO2 50%.

Urine legionella antigen [**3-3**]: negative Stool [**3-3**]: negative for C. diff Stool [**3-4**]: negative for C. diff  IMAGING: [**3-2**] CT head: No acute intracranial process or fractures.
[**3-2**] CT C-spine: 1.
[**3-2**] CT torso: 1.
Peripancreatic fluid - could be related to pancreatic injury or acute pancreatitis.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
[**3-3**] CT abd/pelvis w/oral contrast: 1.
Was initially concern for T1 fracture based on OSH imaging, though imaging at [**Hospital1 18**] did not show evidence of a fracture.
Received 2L NS with BP response and was put on levophed.
BP improved quickly and he came off pressors within hours.
UCx and BCx were negative (though in setting of recent outpatient antibiotics).
Sputum Cx revealed GN rods, but CXR revealed no e/o infective process.
Other causes of shock, such as cardiogenic shock, deemed less likely in the setting of normal LV function on echo and negative cardiac enzymes.
History of poor PO intake suggested possible hypovolemic status, but there was no evidence suggesting large volume loss on imaging studies or lab tests.
Temperature improved quickly with antibiotic therapy and Bair hugger.
Repeat CXR [**3-6**] did not show any edema, bilateral effusions had improved, and atalectasis had improved.
Should have repeat CXR in several weeks to confirm that there are not any persistent abnormalities.
Neuro exam was non focal.
CT head negative for any acute pathology.
Urine chemistry and clinical history was most consistent with ischemic ATN superimposed upon his CKD.
C diff testing was negative x2.
Abdominal exam was benign.
#  ANEMIA: He presented with a Hct that 6 points lower than his recent Hct on [**2-27**].
Baseline Hct appears to be 29-30.
Has had extensive w/u including negative EGD and colonoscopy outpatient.
Hct was trended daily and ranged 23-27 on the floor.
# PERIPANCREATIC FLUID COLLECTION ON CT: There were CT findings concerning for pancreatitis, but there was no clinical correlation.
Should have repeat TFTs in outpatient setting once acute issues resolve.
He would likely benefit from re-initiation of Flomax if BP remains stable at rehab.

While you were in the emergency department, your temperature and blood pressure dropped suddenly and you became unresponsive.
You needed a breathing tube to help protect your airway, and fluids and medications to help raise your blood pressure.
