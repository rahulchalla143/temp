On [**2197-7-20**], MRI of the abdomen showed hypovascular masses in both kidneys and spleen of various sizes consistent with lymphoma.
A CT-guided biopsy of the spleen on [**2197-7-21**] was nondiagnostic.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2197-7-26**], which showed extensive necrosis with focal involvement by high-grade B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type.
FISH translocation was notable for c-Myc and Bcl-2 indicating a "double hit" lymphoma characterized by a Burkitt's-like lymphoma.
Follow up CT imaging on [**2197-8-5**] showed stable lymphomatous lesions in the kidney, spleen, and abdominal nodes.

A CT of the chest showed bilateral lower lobe opacities, right greater than left, concerning for infection and he was treated with a course of Levaquin.
He [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] CT of the chest for further evaluation, which showed multiple filling defects within the segmental and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe arteries compatible with pulmonary emboli.
-- FDG tumor imaging on [**2197-10-19**] showed no evidence for lymphoma with slight interval decrease in size in bilateral pulmonary infarcts.
Bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence  for lymphoma and no cytogenetic abnormalities, particularly no c-Myc or Bcl2 translocation.
-- Repeat PET imaging on [**2197-12-19**] showed new focal mild FDG-avidities in the mediastinal region.
-- Repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**2197-12-20**] showed no evidence for lymphoma with some dyspoiesis noted.
Repeat CT of the torso on [**2198-1-3**] showed left pelvic soft tissue and expansion of the left piriformis muscle corresponding to the regions of FDG avidity for [**2197-12-19**] scan.
Pulmonary embolism, fondaparinux on hold due to thrombocytopenia #.
Polymyalgia rheumatica diagnosed in [**2197**] and managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], although further treatment on hold while getting treatment for lymphoma and unclear if his symptoms were related to lymphoma and not PMR.

Also during your hospitalization, you needed blood and platelet transfusions because all of your blood counts are low.
Because your white blood cell count is low, you should call a physician for any symptoms of infection, especially a fever.
