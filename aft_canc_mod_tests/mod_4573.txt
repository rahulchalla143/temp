Her hematocrit was then stable and she was discharged home on [**9-5**] with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 702**].
As an out-patient she had a CT scan which revealed a pelvic mass likely originating from her uterus and extending above her umbilicus.
The scan also suggested fistula with the bowel, right hydronephrosis, and question of invasion of the IVC.
Her last Pap was 20+ years ago.
2+ PT pulses bilaterally.

Comparison is made with a similar preceding examination obtained the day before ([**2128-10-27**]).
Review is also extended to the portable chest examination of [**2128-10-26**].
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-10-1**], left and right ventricular systolic dysfunction are new (?Takotsubo or multivessel CAD) and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are now seen.
Most recent CXR [**11-1**]: HISTORY: PICC placement.
MICROBIOLOGY: All culture date, in [**2128-9-29**], including urine, blood, RPR, Cdiff, were all negative.

INR trend: Hovering at 1.3 for past 3 days.
She underwent exploratory laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, rectosigmoid resection with end colostomy, ileocecectomy with primary side-to-side functional end-to-end anastomosis, pelvic washout, and placement of bilateral ureteral stents.
TTE showed new Takotsubo's syndrome (severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the left ventricle).
She also had a couple of episodes of NSVT on [**10-28**], asymptomatic with BP stable, thought to be due to PICC placement, so it was repositioned.
A 12 lead EKG showed no acute ischemic changes, but did show a prolonged QTc.
An Echo was done and was concerning for Takusobos cardiomyopathy.
Electrolytes were checked regularly and repleted.
Serial EKGs were done to monitor QT.
She had several runs of non-sustained Vtach and was found to have a deep position of the PICC which was pulled back.
A CXR concerning for volume overload vs possible PNA.
Her incision was then closed in the OR [**10-21**] with Prolene and staples.
*) Advanced uterine cancer: pathology was consistent with grade 3 stage IVB endometriod endometrial CA.
On extubation she was minimally responsive and a head CT was done which showed no acute intracranial process.
She had a head MRI which was negative.
She had a full workup and no infectious, iatrogenic, or metabolic abnormalities were identified.
Post-operatively all blood and urine cultures were negative.
Her Creatinine trended up postoperatively to a max of 1.5 and then trended back to her baseline of 0.8-0.9.
She has stable anemia, with Hct of 23.3.
Cardiac - will need ECHO next week, and cardiology follow up in [**Month (only) **].
Oncology - she is scheduled for follow up with her oncologist on [**11-12**], and with her surgeon on [**11-15**].
Echocardiogram (ultrasound of your heart) showed new congestive heart failure, likely secondary to the cardiac arrest.
You have been treated with medications to help your heart and prevent formation of blood clots, and you were given medicine to help remove the fluid that accumulated in your body after aggressive resuscitative efforts.
