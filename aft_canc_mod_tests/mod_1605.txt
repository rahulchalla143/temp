An ultrasound is suggested for further evaluation.
[**2125-1-20**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US: Targeted grayscale and color evaluation of the gallbladder was performed.
Evaluation for a snographic [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign was limited as the patient had received pain medication prior to this study.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2125-1-21**] for evaluation of severe abdominal pain.
Admission CXR revealed chronic interstitial lung disease without definite change.
Abdominal CT showed a distended gallbladder with surrounding pericholecystic fat stranding is concerning for acute cholecystitis.
Abdominal Ultrasound findings consistent with acute cholecystitis.
It was found that his (R)UQ abdominal process was compromising his respiratory function, and despite qualify surgery as high risk, it was felt there was not a non-surgical alternative.
On [**2125-1-24**], the patient began experiencing increased dyspnea requiring increased oxygen demand from his home baseline of 4.5 liters by nasal prong to maintain oxygen saturation at 92-93%.
PFTs were performed on [**2125-1-24**].
A Chest CT was ordered, which showed new diffuse ground-glass opacity, superimposed upon worsened background interstitial lung abnormality, most consistent with progression of UIP, less likely superimposed pulmonary edema.
He was triggered for a respiratory rate of 43-44.
