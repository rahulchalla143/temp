Ms [**Known lastname 8285**] CBC was monitored closely following HiDAC chemotherapy secondary to her significant bleeding risks from thrombocytopenia as evidenced in the past.
The patient was maintained with a platelet count greater than 30 requiring multiple transfusions with cross matched and HLA matched platelets.
The following day her white cell counts were notable for a recovery first of the monocytes lineage.
At the time of this dictation the patient's white blood cell count was 4.1 with 0% neutrophils, 40% lymphocytes, 57% monocytes.

Infectious disease:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] remained on AmBisome for the multiple rounded lesions within the spleen which were not significantly changed on repeat MRI examination on [**2154-12-4**].
During her neutropenic period Infectious Disease was consulted regarding the usefulness of a repeat scan while the patient was afebrile.
It was felt that the utility of this scan would not significantly change therapy and the original plan to re-evaluate after the completion of AmBisome therapy was followed up.
Nasal washings were obtained and a preliminary read was negative for RSV, influenza A and B, and anti-virus, and Parainfluenza.
Blood cultures, urine culture, chest x-ray were performed on [**2154-12-26**] during the febrile episode, and all studies did not reveal a source for her infection.
