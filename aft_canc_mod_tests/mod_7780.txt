She underwent ex-laparotomy in [**2140**] with a resection of her terminal ilium which pathology revealed as carcinoid tumor.
She underwent a negative GI workup with her outpatient gastroenterologist.
An abdominal CT in [**9-/2148**] showed a 2cm solitary liver lesion suspicious for a met, and it enhanced on an octreotide scan in [**10/2148**] that otherwise showed no other metastatic burden.
Biopsy around that time showed metastatic carcinoid.
Post-procedure, she was noted to have increasingly labile blood pressures with a peak of 240/160.
On transfer to the ICU, her initial vital signs were: T 96.3 BP142/54  P64  RR19  Sat96/4LNC.
Core biopsy [**8-/2145**] demonstrated grade I, ER and PR positive, HER-2 negative invasive ductal carcinoma.
Reexcision for close margins showed no evidence of residual cancer.
-  Hx of lung nodules followed with imaging which  resolved on chest CT [**2148-8-28**].
[**2137-12-21**] CT showed a 1.2 cm partially solid nodule in the right lower lobe, stable compared to CT [**2147-6-7**].
CT [**2148-2-26**] showed a 6 mm right lower lobe nodule diminished in size and c/w with inflammation.
CT [**2148-9-25**] showed a new 2 cm solitary liver enhancing lesion suspicious for metastasis (CT [**2-13**] to r/o aortic aneurysm normal by report).
Octreotide scan at the time demonstrated only the hepatic lesion and biopsy of the liver lesion [**2148-10-8**], demonstrated metastatic carcinoid.
Admission on [**2141-1-12**], for which the patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy with laparotomy and resection of 60 cm of her ileum in the setting of recurrent partial small bowel obstruction.
Pathology from the above laparotomy confirmed carcinoid tumor in the ileum.
The proximal and distal resected margins were negative for tumor, [**4-12**] lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoid tumor.
Biopsies were obtained including a biopsy of the rectosigmoid [**Year (4 digits) 499**] that was consistent with a hyperplastic polyp.
On [**2147-2-13**], the patient underwent a biopsy of a hep positive right lower lobe lesion under CT guidance.
Multinucleated giant cells as well as benign appearing epithelial cells and macrophages were present.
Overall, there were changes in lung function compared to the previous study performed on [**2148-4-23**].
On [**2148-10-9**], the patient underwent a left liver fine needle aspirate that was notable for tumor cells consistent with carcinoid tumor.
On [**2148-10-23**], the patient underwent an octreotide scan that was notable for a small focus of increased tracer uptake in the anterior aspect of the left liver lobe.
- Abdominal hernia repair [**2142**] after exploratory laparotomy.

Imaging/diagnostics: - CT abdomen: 1.
No interval change to two additional small hypoattenuating subcentimeter hepatic lesions within segment VII and segment VII/VIII dating back to [**9-25**] [**2147**] CT exam.
Her BP has since corrected to the normal range.
She received a CT head on [**2149-5-8**] which was negative for acute hemorrhage.

Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 8071**], you were admitted to the [**Hospital1 827**] because your blood pressure was very high and you needed supplemental oxygen after your radio-frequency ablation.
Your blood pressure improved and you no longer needed oxygen prior to discharge.
