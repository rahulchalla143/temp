Fluid balance in the MICU was -240 cc net.
Hematocrit was noted to drop between the ED and MICU, but the patient has not yet stooled, nor has guaiac been performed.
In the MICU her blood pressure has been around 100 systolic.

BNP elevated at [**Numeric Identifier 890**] from 4800 in [**2120-11-22**].
TSH and B12 were checked: TSH was 5.0 suggesting the need for likely supplemental thyroxine.
This may require further outpatient work-up or the addition of levothyroxine if T4 is found to be low.
CT is not adequate for evaluation of the various components of the arousal system.
The result was 9.7 and the typical therapeutic range is [**9-10**] for an adult, but this level is likely appropriate for an elderly patient.
Supratherapeutic INR and Atrial Fibrillation   Continue outpatient medications: Amiodarone.
Allow INR to drift down.
This will need to be restarted when her INR is less than 3.0 and likely at a dose of about 5 mg per day (she was on 6 mg previously).
Hematuria has been a chronic problem and may warrant further work-up at the discretion of her PCP.
