Hct was reportedly 28 with INR 1.3.
She desatted to the high 80's on NC with SBP 90-100's.
Labs were notable for an initial Hct of 11.4 with repeat of 22.5 (without intervention).
INR 1.4, Creat 0.5, WBC 6.4.

Diffuse ground-glass opacity, stable since [**2195-5-1**], but new since [**2195-3-10**], may represent diffuse drug reaction, atypical pneumonia or edema.
# CP/SOB: Patient had 3 episodes this admission of CP and SOB, which after much investigation (including CTA which showed no new process) was determined to be atrial fibrillation likely causing some pain with demand ischemia (but negative cardiac enzymes x3) and also severe GERD from esophagitis noted on CTA.
This was especially true as she continued to be febrile after 48hrs on antibiotics.
Moderate right sided pleural effusion noted on CT scan could represent an empyema, however, this has been noted on prior CT scans making this less likely.
She was broadened to vanc + cefepime (day 1= [**5-3**]) given patient's exposure history and poor pulmonary reserve to cover for Pseudomonas and MRSA.
UCx and urine legionella were negative.
Sputum Cx had commensal resp flora.
Iron studies suggested anemia of chronic disease with significantly elevated ferritin.
She may need further transfusions in the future.
HCT at dispo is 26.8. .
