Pt udernwent CT for evaluation of mass recently which demonstrated mod-large pericardial effusion ant.
Echo confirmed presence of pericardial effusion, ?RV deformation.
Pericardiocentesis - 400cc cerosanguinous drainage from pericardial sac uncomplicated procedure.

Cath [**10-29**] Resting preprocedure hemodynamics revealed equalization of pressures between the RA (RA mean pressure 11mmHG) and the pericardium (12mmHg) consistent with tamponade physiology.
The Cardiac output was 3.24L/min with an index of 2.12L/min/m2.
Successful drainage of 400cc serosanguinous fluid from pericardial space.
Post intervention RA pressure was 8mmHg and pericardial pressure was 2mmHg.
Post procedure cardiac output was 4.36L/min with an index of 2.84L/min/m2.
Echo [**10-29**] post procedure 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with  paradoxical septal motion.
Echo [**2177-10-31**] Conclusions: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study of [**2177-10-30**], the anterior echogenic space is  more prominent/larger - but the views are not directly comparable and may be related to technical factors.
[]Cardiac: Ischemia - no history of CAD, not on any meds outpt aside from lipitor, continued lipitor inhouse.
Repeat echo the following day revealed that pt continued to have mild hypokinesis however not clear if this due to the views vs. pt being tachycardic.
Patient should have repeat echo in 1 week time to evaulate this further.
DDx for pleural effusion is wide however given the cell count with numerous RBC, this is likely hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.
8 percent according to the latest study in Chest [**2171**] [**Month (only) **];116(6):1564-9. .
- Repeat Echo in 1 week to see progression of the effusion.
Calcium + D 600-200 mg-unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
We did see that your heart does not seem to pump blood optimally on the echocardiogram you had performed.
You will need to have another echocardiogram in one week to reassess your heart.
