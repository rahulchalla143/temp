Cardiac biomarkers were checked and noted to be elevated, with a Trop T of 4.9, CK normal, EKG normal.
Cards was consulted, and she underwent a stress test that was negative.
No HIT antibody testing in discharge paperwork.
Of note, she had an MRI in [**11/2108**] for same concern, which was negative for metastases.
She triggered on arrival to the floor here at [**Hospital1 18**] for HTN to 200/100 HR 110.
EKG unchanged.
-- [**10/2103**] Chest x-ray demonstrated a density in the left mid lung, which was confirmed by a chest CT. -- [**11/2103**] chest CT revealing a 1.8-cm left upper lobe spiculated mass with pleural extension consistent with a malignant neoplasm.
-- [**2103-12-7**] staging with PET CT showing increased activity in the left upper lobe nodule.
Brain MRI at the time of diagnosis was negative.
-- [**2-/2104**] She was treated postoperatively with one cycle of paclitaxel and carboplatin, but was hospitalized post infusion on [**2104-2-22**] with chest pain, which was a ST elevation MI.
She underwent emergent catheterization with a 60% LAD stenosis for which she got a Cypher drug-eluting stent.
She did not receive further paclitaxel chemotherapy, but was started on a regimen of cisplatin and vinorelbine, which she received a single cycle on [**2104-3-26**], which was complicated by a MRSA UTI as well as a decrement in her creatinine clearance to 57 mL/min down from over 100.
-- She did not continue to follow with her oncologist, but got periodic CT scans via her surgeon and PCP.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**2107-5-2**] CT with no evidence of recurrence, although a small nodule is noted in the left lower lobe measuring 3 mm, which had not been reliably demonstrated on the prior study.
She underwent an EGD with gastritis and gastric emptying study consistent with gastroparesis.
-- [**2108-10-25**] CT which confirmed a new soft tissue abnormality in the left mediastinum starting just distal to the aortic arch associated with abnormal density surrounding the left main bronchus posteriorly and small lymph nodes in the left hilum suspicious for lung cancer recurrence.
She also underwent on [**2108-10-25**] an MRI of her L-spine, which was stopped for pain, but did not show metastatic involvement.
-- [**2108-10-26**], she underwent a bronchoscopy with EBUS, which showed a station 4L lymph node positive for malignant cells consistent with nonsmall cell cancer.
The left main stem bronchus biopsy was only notable for bronchial mucosa and a level 7 node was negative.
-- [**2108-11-7**] PET CT on [**2108-11-7**], which confirmed a PET avid paratracheal soft tissue density with an SUV of 6.7; a left hilar mass along the left main stem bronchus, which was also PET avid at SUV of 4.9; and a non PET-avid 6-mm right hilar lymph node; and 3-mm right lower lobe subpleural nodule.
-- [**2108-12-1**] Chest CT with slight interval increase in adenopathy, no new findings.

It was decided to defer a repeat upper GI series to the outpatient setting.
Repeat CT 24hr later was stable.
Patient was evaluated by neuro-onc (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 60181**] who felt that LP and MRI head should be repeated 1mo after discharge.
