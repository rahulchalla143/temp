Evaluation of the paranasal sinuses is somewhat limited by motion artifact.
Chest X ray [**2121-2-11**]: IMPRESSION: Limited study.
Chest X ray [**2121-2-13**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
BNP was elevated (33,274) and thus she was aggressively diuresed for goal 1L negative daily and eventually weaned to nasal canula.
Subsequent chest X-rays began to clear and follow-up BNP was around 22,000.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and remained flat at 0.03-0.05.
She was transferred to the cardiology floor and remained stable from a respiratory standopoint with oxygen saturations in the high 90s% on room air.
# Atrial fibrillation: Heart rate noted to be elevated to 100s on night of admission.
Digoxin level was obtained and was elevated at 2.5.
Electrolytes were trended daily and creatinine remained stable around 2.5 before eventually trending back down to her baseline.
Creatinine was 1.6 on discharge.
Enzymes were cycled and remained flat (0.04, 0.03).
Urine culture was negative.
A second urine culture was checked and results were pending at the time of discharge.
Creatinine and electrolytes were trended daily.
Dilantin level checked and found to be within normal limits.
