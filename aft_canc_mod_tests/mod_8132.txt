His sodium improved to 121 at the time of transfer to the floor after being fluid restricted to 1.5L and given 40 IV lasix.
His sodium steadily climbed to the mid and high 120s, but on resumption of his home PO furosemide, his sodium declined from the high to mid 120s.
He responded very well to this and his sodium increased promptly.
Of note, multiple urine electrolyte studies were used to guide diuresis and the patient was never terribly sodium avid, even with extensive diuresis.
He underwent a diagnostic paracentesis which was obtained and was a bloody tap.
The patient received further workup while at [**Hospital1 18**].
An ultrasound of his liver was done with subsequent biopsy of an identified mass.
Cytology showed malignant cells consistent with a poorly differeniated carcinoma.
A core biopsy taken from the same nodule was consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Serum CA-19-9 was 1246 and CEA was 8.1.
#CHF- he has a history of paroxysmal afib with a known LBBB and EF of 20%.
INACTIVE ISSUES: #Anemia- his baseline HCT is 31 and this is where he was on admission and no further workup was pursued.
#Diabetes- patient is on large doses of lantus at home 42U qhs, and his blood sugars while in the MICU were low without his home dose of glargine so he was continued on a sliding scale.
His blood sugars were well controlled while in house.
Information was obtained from Patient.
