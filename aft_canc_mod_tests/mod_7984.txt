CT scan at the OSH showed edema surrounding the known mass in her brain and [**Last Name (un) **] midline shift.
Brain MRI was performed and showed a 3.3 cm x 2.9 cm x 2.5 cm right temporoparietal mass with cystic and ring-enhancing features.
Biopsy on [**2138-3-24**] showed metastatic adenocarcinoma.

Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS: [**2138-11-2**] 10:00AM BLOOD WBC-12.2* RBC-3.99* Hgb-12.9 Hct-38.3 MCV-96 MCH-32.3* MCHC-33.6 RDW-12.9 Plt Ct-359 [**2138-11-2**] 10:00AM BLOOD PT-12.1 PTT-19.7* INR(PT)-1.0 [**2138-11-2**] 10:00AM BLOOD UreaN-16 Creat-0.8  DISCHARGE LABS: [**2138-11-5**] 06:05AM BLOOD WBC-9.5 RBC-4.01* Hgb-12.9 Hct-39.4 MCV-98 MCH-32.2* MCHC-32.7 RDW-13.5 Plt Ct-359 [**2138-11-5**] 06:05AM BLOOD Glucose-102* UreaN-16 Creat-0.7 Na-138 K-4.2 Cl-105 HCO3-25 AnGap-12  IMAGING: MRI HEAD IMPRESSION: Mild increase in size of the right temporal lobe lesion with worsening surrounding FLAIR hyperintensity may suggest tumor recurrence; however, possibility of radiation necrosis cannot be completely excluded.
MR perfusion and MR spectroscopy are recommended for further evaluation.
(2) Brain Mass: On most recent MRI, the lesion measures 3.6 cm x 3 cm compared to 3.2 cm x 2.8 cm in the axial plane on the previous scan from [**2138-8-28**].
Previous biopsy of the site showed metastatic adenocarcinoma, staining positive for CK7, CK20, CDX2, and focal weakly positive for CEA.
(3) Cancer of Unknown Origin: Patient recently had a breast MRI on [**10-25**] that showed a 7.5mm right breast abnormality.
Radiologist recommended diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound, and MRI-guided breast biopsy.
Patient had attempted biospy recently; however, the biopsy was not successful.
Patient was scheduled to undergo breast biopsy as an outpatient, but the patient was hospitalized.
On day of discharge, patient's white count was within normal limits.
(6) Transition of Care: - Ultrasound-guided breast biopsy on an outpatient basis at a later date.
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] after a generalized seizure at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital and a CT scan showed brain edema (swelling) around the known mass in your brain.
