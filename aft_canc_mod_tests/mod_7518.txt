STUDIES: ======== CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2167-4-23**] 10:06 PM  CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  Reason: please evaluate for interval change in size of bleeding with Field of view: 42  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 55 year old man with multiple myeloma day + 98 from cord blood transplant now with evidence of intraperitoneal hemorrhage s/p hepatic biopsy.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please evaluate for interval change in size of bleeding with CT Abd/Pelvis without contrast CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: Acute Renal Failure  CLINICAL INDICATION: Intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
TECHNIQUE: 0.625 mm helically-acquired images are obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis without intravenous contrast.
FINDINGS: Direct comparison is made to prior examination dated [**2167-4-23**] at 3:25 a.m. Areas of interstitial septal thickening are identified at the lung bases.
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS ON [**2167-4-23**]  CLINICAL HISTORY: Multiple myeloma and prior stem cell transplantation, recently performed transjugular liver biopsy, now with acute onset of abdominal pain and question of intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast helical acquisition of CT images performed from the lung bases through the ischial tuberosities.
Comparison was made to prior CT of [**2167-3-15**].
FINDINGS: Respiratory motion artifact limits evaluation of the parenchyma.
ABDOMEN: Non-contrast evaluation of the abdomen reveals a slightly hyperdense liver and spleen compatible with hemosiderosis.
Fluid tracks along the right paracolic gutter as well as extending to a perisplenic location, none of which was present on prior examination.
Non-contrast evaluation of the pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys is unremarkable.
Evaluation for myelomatous involvement would be more thorough by MRI if there is clinical concern for progression.
Moderate amount of intraperitoneal fluid, particularly in a perisplenic location with slightly increased density, not seen on prior study and is suggestive of intraperitoneal hemorrhage from recent transjugular liver biopsy.
[**Numeric Identifier 93053**]  GI BIOPSIES (2 JARS).
GMS stain is negative for fungi, with a satisfactory control.
CMV immunostain is negative for viral inclusions, with a satisfactory control.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] were notified of the preliminary diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] on [**2167-4-23**].
[**2167-4-21**] MRI ABDOMEN W/O & W/CONTRAST  Reason: Please evaluate for evidence of infection vs GVHD Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 55 year old man with MM day +96 s/p cord transplant now with rising LFTs, bilirubin 3.7.
COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis [**2167-3-15**].
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the abdomen were obtained on a 1.5 Tesla magnet utilizing a breath-hold independent technique including dynamic sequential images obtained prior to, during, and after the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadolinium-DTPA (17 cc).
MRI OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Study is limited due to the patient's inability to hold his breath.
Diffuse dropout in signal on the T1 in-phase images compared to the out-of-phase images within the liver and spleen are compatible with hemosiderosis.
Multiple compression fractures are again demonstrated within the lumbar spine, unchanged from the prior CT from [**2167-2-3**].

Previous biopsies:    [**Numeric Identifier 93053**]  GI BIOPSIES (2 JARS).
The white blood cell count appears decreased.
Platelet count appears decreased; rare large forms are seen.
Differential count shows 81% neutrophils/bands, 5% monocytes, 11% lymphocytes, 3% eosinophils.
Differential (300 cells) shows <1% Blasts,  1% Promyelocytes, 8% Myelocytes, 5% Metamyelocytes, 16% Bands/Neutrophils, 2% Plasma cells, 2% Lymphocytes, 66% Erythroid.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The biopsy material is suboptimal for evaluation and consists of a fragmented core measuring up to 0.7 cm in length and is comprised of periosteum, hypocellular subcortical bone, and a small amount of detached marrow.
Reason for referral: This patient was referred by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1790**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1789**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for evaluation of GI bleeding.
Repeat EGD or enteroscopy   Brief Hospital Course: HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Pt was transferred to the ICU in the setting of hypoxia s/p cord blood transplant.
Sputum cultures grew group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus and pt was started on cefepime, which was later broadened to include ciprofloxacin and vancomycin given pt's persistent fevers.
PE workup was completed and found negative.
Blood bank was consulted and anti-platelet Ab as well as HLA-Ab workup was submitted.
Delays possibly caused by acute illness post transplant given his multifocal pneumonia and his renal failure requiring hemodialysis for a period of time as well as his CMV viremia up to 1100 copies which became undetectable after initiation of treatment with ganciclovir.
With this antiviral switch, it was noted that his ANC started to decrease slowly.
His chimerism demonstrated engraftment with 195/200 XX chromosome, representing cells from donor.
Eventually when renal function improved, he was restarted on tacrolimus for a goal level of [**6-10**].
GI was consulted, and he had an EGD/colonoscopy twice while hospitalized that showed gastritis and duodenitis.
Small bowel enteroscopy demonstrated segmental continuous erythema, friability and congestion of the mucosa with contact bleeding in the second part of the duodenum.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology and viral cultures at the duodenum CMV and EBV stains were negative, and no findings were shown on pathology that were consistent with GVHD.
The patient underwent capsule endoscopy which demonstrated several sites of ctive bleeding in the stomach, duodenum, and proximal small bowel.
Given his progressive worsening of liver function and elevation of transaminases despite increase in immunosuppression, he underwent liver biopsy on [**4-22**].
Following the procedure the patient dropped his HCT and was found to have a intraperitoneal hemorrhage related to his liver biopsy site.
The patient was monitored and HCT remained stable.
He then was found to have a VL on [**4-25**] of 862 and was restarted on ganciclovir.
Repeat Chest CT imaging revealed much improvement in his pneumonia.
The patient also developed Capnocytophaga (gram negative rod) on a blood culture drawn early in his course ([**1-19**]).
All repeat blood cultures have been negative.
The patient was continued on cefepime for this for 7 days after ANC > 500.
He spiked low grade temps to 99 and repeat CT chest on [**4-13**] demonstrated ronchovascular thickening of LLL.
He was started on empiric levaquin after CXR on [**4-23**] demonstrated question of RLL infiltrate.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient had acute renal failure with creatinine elevation from 1.0 to 2.6 on day 0.
Eventually his creatinine had come down close to his baseline and he was not requiring hemodialysis.
In [**2167-3-6**], his creatinine slowly started to increase from 1.2 to 2.0.
His Cr improved and remained stable at 1.6-1.8 after discontinuation of tacrolimus and foscarnet.
Chimerism study demonstrated no evidence of persistent chimerism as cause for hemolysis.
HYPERTENSION: Pt was started on labetalol and nifedipine while in the hospital, and these medications were titrated to control his blood pressure.
He had a trial of CRRT which he was unable to tolerate secondary to hypotension.
