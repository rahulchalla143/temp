She came to the Emergency Department because of weakness and was found to have an oxygen saturation down to the 70s, which responded to supplemental oxygen and nebulizers.
A chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe consolidation.
Her blood pressure was decreased down to the 70s/40s.
She received a fluid bolus of 500 mL which increased her blood pressure up to the mid 90s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was afebrile, heart rate was 110, blood pressure was 110/48, respiratory rate was 24, and pulse oximetry was 100% on 6 liters via nasal cannula and 100% on nonrebreather mask.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Pulmonary examination revealed no wheezes.
Cardiovascular examination revealed normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.
Extremity examination revealed no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
Neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented times three.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory studies revealed white blood cell count was 6.1 (with 84% neutrophils and 13 bands), hematocrit was 42.2, and platelets were 368, and mean cell volume was 89.
Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 134, potassium was 3.9, chloride was 94, bicarbonate was 21, blood urea nitrogen was 56, creatinine was 2.1 (baseline is 0.6), and blood glucose was 108.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone was 2.2.
A urine culture was sent.
A blood culture was sent.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at about 125 beats per minute and normal axis.
INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  This is a 58-year-old white female with a history of hypothyroidism and asthma coming in with a history of fever, cough, hypoxia, hypertension, and a chest x-ray with evidence of pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and treatment.
Her pulse was 95.
Respiratory rate was 25.
Blood pressure was 117/51.
Oxygen saturation was 98% on 2 liters via nasal cannula.
PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures eventually revealed 4/4 bottles positive for streptococcal pneumonia sensitive to penicillin.
While she did have a left lower lobe pneumonia, a follow-up chest x-ray several days later revealed right-sided infiltrates in the upper and medial lung zones and a small right-sided effusion as well.
CARINAL MASS ISSUES:  Upon transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the floor, the patient underwent a chest computerized axial tomography to further evaluate her effusion and pneumonia.
On this chest computerized axial tomography scan with contrast, a large intraluminal lesion was seen in the lower trachea carina and proximal main stem bronchi which was continuous with precarinal lymph node.
The patient underwent a bronchoscopy the next day; at which point the carinal mass was biopsied and received debulking using a laser.
The biopsy pathology was revealing for adenocystic carcinoma.
The patient underwent a staging evaluation at this point with first a magnetic resonance imaging of the head which revealed no evidence of metastatic.
The patient then underwent a computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis which were also negative for metastatic disease.
The patient underwent a bilateral lower extremity Doppler examination which was negative for deep venous thrombosis and also a computed tomography angiogram of the chest which was negative for any pulmonary embolism.
The computed tomography of the chest also revealed an increase in the size of the pericardial effusion which they called moderate-to-large in size.
The patient had a follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram which showed no evidence of a decrease in ventricular function, a normal valve, and a small pericardial effusion which did not significantly impair hemodynamics.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  A pericardial effusion as evaluated by the transthoracic echocardiogram described in the last paragraph (in Pulmonary paragraph).
The patient's heart rate and blood pressure were stable at all times throughout the hospital course.
The patient was evaluated by Interventional Pulmonology, Hematology/Oncology, and Thoracic Surgery teams who deemed the patient should be followed as an outpatient for further eventual surgery with radiation to the field.
The patient was eventually to undergo a staging mediastinoscopy as well.
