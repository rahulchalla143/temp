An empty bottle of [**Hospital3 20746**] was found by the bed, pt reported only taking the prescribed amount.
Her labs were notable for a polycythemia with Hct of 60.9, lactate 3.4, BUN 37, Cr 1.1, LDH 756, Ca [**86**].3.
CXR showed LLL infiltrate, bullous disease.
CTA showed small LLL PNA, 2.1cm left lung nodule, no PE, extensive bullous disease.

CXR ([**6-9**]): Bullous emphysema with left lower lobe pneumonia.
A repeat PA and lateral view of the chest is recommended to further evaluate the right basilar lucency which most likely represents a large bulla.
This may be further assessed on a repeat AP view of the chest.
CTA Chest ([**6-9**]): 1.
Recommend comparison with prior imaging of the chest if available, and in its absence, this finding needs clinical correlation for possible malignancy and close 3 month followup.
MICROBIOLOGY [**6-9**] blood cultures x2, no growth to date [**6-9**] urine culture, negative     urine legionella, negative [**6-9**] rapid resp viral antigen test, negative [**6-11**], [**6-12**] stool C. dif negative  [**2185-6-9**] 9:58 pm SPUTUM      Source: Endotracheal.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2185-6-10**]):       >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):       SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
CTA showed LLL infiltrate but no PE.
Serial ABGs showed adequate oxygenation with slight hypercarbia, likely due to underlying COPD.
Sputum, urine and blood cultures were negative.
Sputum culture grew sparse Strep pneumo, which was covered by the antibiotics.
Her LDH also remained elevated throughout hospitalization.
#Elevated HCT On admission, the HCT was >60, and stabilzed to 50 at the time of discharge with IVF.
Her C. dif stool antigen was negative x2.
#Elevated LDH The LDH level was elevated on admission and continued to be elevated on discharge (LDH 403).
