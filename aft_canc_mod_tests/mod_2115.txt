An ABG was 7.28/45/65.
CV: Tachy, S1+, S2+, +systplic murmur, III/VI.
Pertinent Results: CYTOGENETICS: FISH evaluation for a BCR-ABL rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the Vysis LSI BCR/ABL Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for BCR at 22q11.2 and ABL at 9q34, and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
BONE MARROW BIOPSY: FISH evaluation for a BCR-ABL rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the Vysis LSI BCR/ABL Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for BCR at 22q11.2 and ABL at 9q34, and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
FOOT X-RAY: 1.
Area of relative lucency and cortical ill definition at the medial aspect of the left fifth metatarsal head may represent an area of cortical destruction due to osteomyelitis, although the appearance is nonspecific.
PATHOLOGY BONE BIOPSY 5th METATARSAL HEAD: Bone, right fifth metatarsal head (A):Regenerative bone and fibrous tissue with focal acute inflammation, consistent with ulcer bed; no acute osteomyelitis seen.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS/CHEST ([**2177-5-30**]): 1.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**6-17**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
IMPRESSION: Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-5-30**], no obvious change but the technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes definitive comparison.
LABS AT THE TIME [**2177-6-25**]: WBC 5.5 HB 8.5 HCT 25.0 PLT 100 Na 138 K 4.0 Cl 99 CO2 30 BUN 35 Creat 2.4 Ca 9.6 Mg 1.6 Phos 2.1 HBsAg Negative HBsAb Borderline HBcAb Negative PPD negative MRSA swab positive  Brief Hospital Course: MICU COURSE [**Date range (3) 47033**] .
He was initially admitted to the floor and found to have a white [**Date range (3) **] cell count of 280,000.
Also received significant hydration in setting of uric acid of 14 and systemic chemotherapy.
WBC was 280K.
Peripheral [**Month/Day (2) **] was bcr-abl positive.
Bone marrow biopsy was not adeuate for further cytogenetics but was also bcr-abl positive, consistent with accelerated CML, and he was continued on above treatment.
His white cell count decreased to normal range.
In consultation with the  hematology oncology service, gleevac was stopped as his WBC normalized and his hematocrit and platelet count were low.
However, his urine output trailed off and his creatinine worsened.
# Osteomyelitis:  Diagnosed as OSH several days prior to transfer with culture growing MRSA, VRE, and multiply resistant Proteus.
Podiatry was consulted and took a bone swab which grew out nothing.
CBC, LFTs, CK, BUN/CREA should be checked weekly and sent to infectious disease.
Developed acute [**Month/Day/Year **] loss anemia with melanotic stool and hct drop to 19.
HCT on discharge was 25.0. .
He should have INR checked daily until therapeutic.
Once INR is 2.0-3.0, please d/c the Heparin SC.
Echo showed normal EF though had poor windows.
# Ileus: Imaging showed no SBO.
When platelets > 150, or if WBC rise restart Gleevec at 100mg every other day.
Check INR daily until range is 2.0-3.0, then drop dose to 4mg daily.
The results of these labs should be faxed to the infectious disease clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**] attention: Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 47034**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Month/Day/Year **]: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day).
Heparin (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution [**Month/Day/Year **]: One (1) injection Injection TID (3 times a day): please discontinue once INR >2.
Bone marrow biopsy was suggestive of chronic myelogenous leukemia.
Your [**Month/Day/Year **] count normalized and you will follow up with the hematology oncology team for further management.
You should have your CBC, Chem-10 checked weekly with the results faxed to attn: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6023**].
While on Daptomycin and cefepime, you should have weekly labs to include CK, LFTs, Chem-10, and CBC.
The results of these labs should be faxed to the infectious disease clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**] attention: Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 47034**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
