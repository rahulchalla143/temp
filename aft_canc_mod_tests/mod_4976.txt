Eval cerebral vessels EXAM: MRI of the brain and MRA of the head and neck.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with left internal carotid artery occlusion and right ICA stenosis, for further evaluation to exclude stroke and also to evaluate the cerebral blood vessels.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained.
MRA OF THE NECK:  The neck MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in the right vertebral artery.
The evaluation of the right carotid stenosis on the post- gadolinium MRA is limited secondary to venous contamination.
The evaluation of the left vertebral artery on source images demonstrate flow signal in a markedly narrowed left vertebral artery in the proximal portion.
INTERPRETATION: Image Protocol: Gated SPECT Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 69%.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  UGI SGL CONTRAST W/ KUB  [**2173-6-7**] 9:18 AM  UGI SGL CONTRAST W/ KUB  Reason: Please do thin barium study by injecting contrast via NGT, a  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 72 year old man with duod./ampullary mass s/p resection and reanast.
The patient had a duodenal resection, so the purpose of the study is to eval.
After instillation of approximately 100 cc of Gastrografin through the nasogastric tube, spot fluoroscopic images were obtained, which showed the contrast collecting first in the stomach and then promptly emptying into the duodenal sweep.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: concern for abcess/leak.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis was performed through the administration of Gastrografin oral contrast and Optiray intravenous contrast.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with associated atelectasis at the lung bases.
CT OF THE PELVIS: A Foley catheter is seen within the bladder, and there is nondependent air in the bladder lumen.
A sample was sent for microbiology.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: Compare to CT Abdomen on [**6-10**] to make sure that everything h Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 72 year old man POD 7 s/p transduodenal ampullectomy and CCY with fevers, hypotension REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Compare to CT Abdomen on [**6-10**] to make sure that everything has imprvoved CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast.
COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis [**2173-6-13**].
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases show right lower lobe atelectasis with a moderate-sized right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion.
The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are normal in appearance.
The stomach and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable in appearance.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, seminal vesicles, prostate, distal ureters, and bladder are normal in appearance.
Interval decreased in size of this collection from the prior scan of [**2173-6-13**].
Initial aspiration yielded 10-15 cc of serous fluid samples, of which have been sent for microbiological culture, Gram stain, and amylase.
CT-GUIDED MANIPULATION OF EXISTING PIGTAIL CATHETER  The non-contrast CT scan confirms the existing pigtail catheter in good position along the lateral aspect of the right lobe of the liver.
NON-CONTRAST CT SCAN OF THE ABDOMEN:  Minimal right basal pleural effusion, consolidation in the posteromedial aspect of the right lower lobe.
Successful placement of 10-French pigtail catheter into the loculated right posterior perihepatic fluid collection,  2.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: Lung exam worsened.
Crackles in lungs increased in lungs [**Hospital1 **]  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 72 year old man with ampullary mass REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Lung exam worsened.
Moderate right pleural effusion, increased since the post-thoracentesis radiograph of [**2173-6-17**], but similar to the pre-thoracentesis radiograph.
