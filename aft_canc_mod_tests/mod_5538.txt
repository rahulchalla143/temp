History of Present Illness: The patient is a 53 y/o woman with AML who is s/p 7+3 and HiDAC consolidation on [**2143-1-3**], who presents today to clinic with a low platelet count (6) and petechiae on her chest, abdomen, arms, which has developed over the past 2 days.
A CBC showed thrombocytopenia and blasts.
On [**2142-9-26**], a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration revealed acute myelogenous leukemia with monocytic differentiation.
The blasts and promonocytes comprised 65% of the marrow cellularity.
Flow cytometry of the marrow was positive for CD34, HLA-DR, CD13, CD33, CD7D1, CD117, CD4, CD15, CD54, and CD2.
Her cytogenetics were consistent with inversion 16.
Her day 14 bone marrow biopsy showed an empty bone marrow and her day 28 marrow showed her to be in remission with normal trilineage hematopoesis.
Her antiplatelet antibodies were positive.
- Pulmonary sarcoid diagnosed in [**2122**] by mediastinal biopsy, and resolved with 1-2 years of prednisone therapy - Hx of bilateral thrombosis in the greater saphenous veins in the groin, thigh and calf, with IVC filter placement in [**12-3**] - Bilateral hip replacements in [**2134**] and [**2137**] secondary to osteoarthritis - Spinal fusion at age 14 - Appendectomy as a child   Social History: She works as a librarian at [**Hospital1 8**] Public Library.

Microbiology: Blood cultures from [**1-20**], [**1-21**], [**1-23**], [**1-25**], [**1-27**] no growth.
Urine cultures from [**1-20**], [**1-21**], [**1-25**] no growth Sputum culture from [**1-22**] negative for Pneumocystis [**1-27**] C. diff negative.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 69580**] is a 53 y/o woman with AML who is s/p 7+3 and 2nd cycle of HiDAC consolidation on a [**1-3**] admission, who presents w/ platelets of 6 and petechiae.
ABG initially 7.42/104/52 lactate 1.2.
A CTA was done which was negative for PE, but suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
A CXR on [**1-23**] was concerning for LLL PNA.
That evening she spiked a temperature, blood cultures were resent.
CXR was done the following day and on [**1-26**], vanco and meropenem were started in light of a worsening CXR and increased O2 requirement.
A CT chest was performed on [**1-27**] which showed worsening left lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia, chronic partial collapse of the left upper lobe and of the lateral right middle lobe, new small left pleural effusion and stable right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
They recommended bronchoscopy, however felt that if the patient's oxygen saturation improved and she remained afebrile, the bronchoscopy could be deferred.
On [**1-29**], O2 sat on RA 91%.
She was able to ambulate around the unit and maintain O2 saturation in the 90s on 1L.
She received 2 bags HLA matched platelets (1st bag given when plt 6, second bag given b/c plts due to outdate).
White count and platelets continued to improve over the admission.
Hematocrit on d/c was stable.
Stool sent for C. diff which was negative.
Meperidine (PF) 50 mg/mL Syringe Sig: One (1)  Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed.
This was treated with IVIG and your platelet count and white blood cell count have risen appropriately.
You will need a CBC at that time.
