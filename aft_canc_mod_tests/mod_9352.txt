Additional Imaging: [**2119-12-28**] Chest/ABD/PELVIC CT: CT TORSO: Helical imaging was performed from the lung bases through the pubic symphysis without IV contrast.
Subsequently, helical imaging was again performed from the thoracic inlet through the pubic symphysis after uneventful administration of intravenous contrast.
COMPARISON: CT torso from [**2119-12-17**].
CT CHEST: There remain bibasilar confluent opacities, slightly more pronounced on the left.
