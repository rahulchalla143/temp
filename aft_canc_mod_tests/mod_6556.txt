She had a CT/CTA head, which was negative, and subsequent MRI showed a small area of [**Hospital1 **] but no major bleed.
She was given Lasix 10 mg IV x1 and Morphine, and EKG showed new ST depressions in V4-V6.
Cycled enzymes at that time were positive: CK: 1132 MB: 29 MBI: 2.6 Trop-T: 0.90. .

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
MRI brain [**2199-2-9**]:  IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct or enhancing brain lesion.
Brain atrophy noted  [**2199-2-8**]:  CT ANGIOGRAPHY HEAD:  CT angiography of the head demonstrates exuberant calcification and diffuse atherosclerotic disease involving the left distal vertebral artery in the V4 segment.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrate diffuse atherosclerotic disease involving the left common carotid artery in the neck with irregularity of the arterial margin.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates exuberant calcification and diffuse atherosclerotic disease involving the distal left vertebral artery.
CT C-spine: [**2199-2-8**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
MR is more sensitive than CT for evaluation of the spinal cord.

She had a CT/CTA head, which was negative, and subsequent MRI showed a small area of [**Hospital1 **] but no major bleed.
[**2-10**] patient without complaints, VS notable for SBP range: 160-197/90-100s, HRs: 90-100s, On [**2-11**] at approximately 5 am,  she became acutely dyspneic.
She was given Lasix 10 mg IV x1 and Morphine, and EKG showed new ST depressions in V4-V6.
Subsequent cardiac work up included catheterization to reveal patent LIMA to LAD and vein grafts to the OM and RCA and right heart pressures were normal.
Aortic stenosis  was present with valve area of 0.8-1cm squared, moderate MR. She was referred for redo sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.
On [**2-19**] she went to the Operating Room where she underwent redo sternotomy/ Aortic valve replacement with a size 21-mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]- [**Doctor Last Name **] Magna tissue valve with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **].
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
