The chest pressure is not exertional, it is not new, and is presumably secondary to the large retrosternal plasmacytoma.
In the Emergency Department, his systolic blood pressure was in the high 80s/low 90s.
Multiple myeloma and chest wall plasmacytoma diagnosed in [**Country 5881**] in [**2117-11-5**] where it was initially treated in [**2119-8-6**] with .................... and prednisone.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 100.3; other vital signs were stable.
General appearance revealed a well-appearing and well-nourished male in no apparent distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equally round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Jugular venous distention of 9 cm.
Pulmonary examination revealed no crackles.
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Rectal examination was guaiac-negative.
Extremity examination revealed no edema.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  His complete blood count on admission showed white blood cell count was 4, hematocrit was 30.6, and an elevated neutrophil and band count.
His urinalysis was sent and remained essentially normal.
His electrolytes were within normal.
He had an endoscopy with biopsies performed by the Gastroenterology Service.
The second esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed hyperplasia and mild regeneration of the gastric pit.
The third biopsy was performed with ultrasound guidance which was not available at the time of discharge; however, it suggested fungal elements with possible lymphocytes consistent with plasmacytoma.
This thrombolytic lesion appeared to impinge on the ulnar nerve (according to a computed tomography scan which was performed).
As well, the patient had some radial and medial nerve damage; according to an electromyogram which was performed while he was in house.
This possibly suggested a brachial plexus nerve route injury, and a magnetic resonance imaging was attempted.
Anesthesia was consulted, and the patient was to return on [**2120-2-15**] for a magnetic resonance imaging of the neck and left arm under anesthesia.
The patient was also to follow up for his magnetic resonance imaging on [**2120-2-15**].
