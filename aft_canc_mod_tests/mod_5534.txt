A pelvic ultrasound was completed to the vaginal bleeding that was noted it showed:      PELVIC ULTRASOUND: Transabdominal evaluation of the pelvis was performed.
Transvaginal examination was not attempted as the patient was unable to give consent secondary to mental status change.
A follow up MRI showed: The present study shows high T1 signal, apparently blood products, within the left frontal metastatic tumor resection bed.
Some of these could be vessels, but they do appear somewhat more prominent than was seen on the prior study of [**2187-12-7**].
There is pachymeningeal enhancement subjacent to the craniotomy defect, a finding which can simply be due to the surgery itself.
The edema associated with both lesions is re-demonstrated, as are the numerous punctate areas of elevated FLAIR signal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, probably representing chronic small vessel infarcts.
The present study shows susceptibility within the left cerebellar metastasis, raising the question of interval hemorrhage compared to the prior susceptibility scan of [**11-14**], [**2187**] (more recent intervening MR studies did not have a susceptibility sequence).
L cerebellar met was already treated with SRS about 10 days ago.
