Posterior arthrodesis T10 to L3.
The patient was diagnosed with lung cancer in [**2113-11-18**] on work-up for back pain.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had wedge resection [**2114-1-18**] foloowed by XRT/chemo, which ended [**2114-6-8**].
Biopsy was negative at that time for metastatic disease.
Imaging at [**Hospital1 18**] is suspicious for metastatic disease to T10, T11 and L1 on MRI.

| AMPICILLIN------------   <=2 S NITROFURANTOIN--------  <=16 S TETRACYCLINE----------  =>16 R VANCOMYCIN------------   <=1 S   Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old female with PMhx of Lung Cancer, (s/p right upper lobectomy, middle lobe wedge resection, 4 cycles chemo + adjuvent radiation) with lower back and right hip pain since [**6-26**] (s/p kyphoplasty) transferred from OSH for evaluation and management of lower back pain and possible metastases to the spinal column at L1.
Noted on MRI's in early [**Month (only) 205**], the marrow signal from L1 and possibly from T11 were suspicious for metastasis, however biopsy in [**Month (only) 205**] at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was negative.
MRI and CT spine at [**Hospital1 18**] confirmed L1 and T11 lesions.
Due to concern that this was metastatic lung cancer, Heme/Onc and Rad-onc were consulted, as was palliative care.
On post-op day 4, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent a second procedure for posterior arthrodesis T10 to L3, segmental instrumentation T10 to L3 with pedicle and hook constructs, and application of allograft and demineralized bone matrix.
Post-op CT did not point to any specific pathology consistent with her pain distribution but the right psoas muscle had a fluid collection that could be consistent with post-op inflammation or infection.
LS spine was re-imaged by CT to evaluate that spinal implants were still in place.
Ultimately, an MRI T- and L-spine with contrast were done to rule in/out infection.
MRI showed no infection of the psoas, but instead tumor infiltrating the psoas as well as into the epidural space with ventral cord compression.
After admission to [**Hospital1 18**], the results of OSH's biopsy of pt's Left Iliac Crest indicated adenocarcinoma consistent with primary lung.
MRI TL spine showed tumor infiltrating the psoas as well as into the epidural space with ventral cord compression.
Due to the tachycardia and fever, bilateral LENI's were done, which were negative for DVT.
At this time hematocrit was also noted to be dropping and the patient was acting confused and becoming delerius.
Out of concern for acute hemorrhage, CT head, abdomen, pelvis and chest (PE protocol) were ordered.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn, which were negative.
CTA chest showed subsegmental PE bilaterally.
At that time, all blood and urine cultures to date were negative.
Additionally, CXR had no acute changes and CT spine showed right paraspinal mass and not psoas infection.
MRI TL-spine was doen and showed no infection, but instead rapidly progressive tumor.
INR returned to [**Location 213**] within 48 hours and was normal on discharge.
Hematocrit was followed daily to monitor for worsening anemia.
Hemolysis labs were normal.
All imaging throughout admission was negative for acute hemorrhage.
Pathologic compression fracture of L1 with significant spinal stenosis.
Pulmonary Embolism 4.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred from and outside hospital for further evaluation and management of your lower back and right hip pain.
