Compared to the previous tracing of [**2139-5-27**] the rate has increased, atrial ectopy has appeared and there is ST segment depression in leads I, II, aVL and V3-V6 consistent with inferolateral ischemic process.

Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2138-5-6**], left ventricular systolic function is now depressed.
[**2140-2-16**] ECG 1:30 pm: Sinus rhythm with marked slowing of the rate as compared with prior tracing of [**2140-2-15**].

WBC 10.4, Hct 27.1, Plt 352.
Repeat echo on [**2-17**] revealed a new decreased EF of 40% as well as a mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis likely [**1-30**] NSTEMI.
His I/O were initially negative and then were even on the floor.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: His baseline creatinine is around 1.3-1.5.
At admission, creatinine was 2.1.
His creatinine eventually returned to baseline and ACEI was restarted and his creatinine and 'lytes remained stable thereafter.
His iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
# HTN: continued BB and then later re-started ace-I when creatinine normalized.
His BP was well-controlled on the regimen.
