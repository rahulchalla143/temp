Hypodensity within the left cerebral peduncle, likely corresponds to signal abnormality noted on MRI from [**2172-3-16**].
If clinically indicated, MR perfusion and Spectroscopy imaging could be performed.
CTX ([**2172-4-20**]): Increase in the right pleural effusion and/or adjacent atelectasis.
Astrocytoma: The CT of his demonstrated increasing midline shift along with increasing edema likely accounting for the majority of his symptoms.
The patient was taken to the trauma ICU overnight for close monitoring of his neuro status and blood pressure.
A repeat CT showed "interval decompression and improvement in the amount of mass effect, midline shift, subfalcine herniation, and effacement of the left suprasellar and ambient cisterns" and the patient remained without headache or nausea/vomiting.
His speach aphasic and his right-sided weakness was stable to mildly improved.
Lung cancer: Was status-post lobectomry.
