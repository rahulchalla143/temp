On his CT chest, a left lung base consolidation was seen that was consistent with aspiration pneumonia or pneumonia.
Neurosurgery saw the patient in the ED and recommended repeat head CT which showed stable subdural hematoma.
Per outpt records, the plan was to continue lifelong anticoagulation as his previous pulmonary embolism was thought to be related to his metastatic protate cancer.
After discussion with patient's primary oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his coumadin will continue to be held at the time of discharge and further anticoagulation will be addressed as an outpatient.

BP now stable, altered mental status is cleared.
