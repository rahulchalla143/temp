MRI repeat([**9-21**]): 1) Unchanged appearance of rim enhancing mass within the right cerebral hemisphere resulting in a large amount of vasogenic edema with leftward shift of the mid-line by approximately 1.5 cm.
Chest CT ([**9-25**]): 1) Interval progression of metastatic disease with increase in size of left lower lobe pulmonary masses, interval development of new bilateral adrenal masses, and new 5 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
CT of the abdomen can be performed for further evalutation.
Head CT [**11-4**]: There are multiple masses in the brain parenchyma with associated surrounding vasogenic edema, most pronounced in both cerebral hemispheres.
This included a L facial droop, slurred speech, weak L shoulder, almost totally plegic L upper extremity, weak LLE, position sense and light touch impaired in L arm, leg spared.
As a result, his mannitol was titrated up ,and when this didn't improve matters, his decadron was increased to 10 mg IV q6h.
A repeat MRI was obtained which showed no cahnge in the edema or midline shift.
He then began to turn around, and his symptoms on exam began to slowly improve.
His exam was essentially stable for the next few days as his medicines were titrated down.
A head CT was performed which was ultimately read as worsening edema and possible herniation, but was initially ambiguous.
He was closely monitored and had stable vitals with an O2 saturation in the high 90s.
Blood cultures were negative and he was started on Levofloxacin, Flagyl, and Vancomycin.
An LP was done which was negative.
Blood cultures and urine cultures remained negative.
His aggitation increased and he was treated with round the clock Haldol.
A repeat head CT showed increased edema and increased midline shift.
At that time he had blood cultures with one set of corynebacterium and one set positive for coagulase negative staph.
He will now be discharged to a [**Hospital1 1501**] for further monitoring and treatment.
His albumin was normal, so free dilantin levels were not checked.
However, he had a low grade fever and a CXR followed by chest CT were obtained.
