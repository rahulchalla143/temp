CXR was obtained.Patient was given Levaquin 750mg IV x1, 1000mL of NS.
Blood pressures were stable until 2 days prior associated with weakness, nausea, poor PO intake, confusion.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: BP: 114/94 P: 82 R: 20 O2: 91% Manually BP repeat 84/40 General: Generally tremulous, Alert, oriented to place, time and self with some coaching, mentions [**Hospital3 **], no acute distress; HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry mucous membranes, oropharynx clear  Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Kyphosis.

Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-8-23**], pulmonary artery pressures are lower.
[**10-9**] lung scan: Match chest X-ray, perfusion, and ventilation in the right lower lobe, triple match, has an indeterminate likelihood ratio for pulmonary embolism.
[**10-9**] CT head without contrast: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect or obvious major acute infarct.
Limited study due to portable technique.

There was some concern for PE but pt had negative LENI, V/Q scan  which was indeterminate, echo with normal RV, and pt thought to be low pre-test likelihood for PE.
Echo with normal RV, hyperdynamic EF, but elevated LV filling pressure.
Flu was ruled out with negative DFA.
By time of call out, pt's bp was in low 100's - 120's and pt was asymptomatic.
BP was 156/70 on the floor.
Compazine and Neurontin are still being held, but can be restarted as an outpatient with close monitoring of Cr.
Acute on Chronic Renal failure: The patient's Cr was elevated to 2.8 on admission with a baseline of 1.1-1.2, still elevated based on her size, weight and age.
FeUrea was 0.02% consistent with pre-renal etiology.
Pt was fluid resuscitated and Cr trended down to 1.7, closer to her baseline by time of call out from MICU.
Hct slightly down from admission 32.4 --> 27.1 with iron deficiency and labs more consistent with chronic disease.
HCT remained stable and was 28.2 on discharge.
QTc 438.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**11-24**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed for congestion.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis -Pneumonia -Hypotension -Acute renal failure -Altered mental status  Secondary Diagnosis -Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure -Anemia   Discharge Condition: Blood pressure stable, mental status at baseline, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were treated in the hospital for pneumonia.
These can be restarted as an outpatient if your blood pressure is elevated.
DISCONTINUE Amiodarone - your heart is now in a regular rhythm, so you do not need to continue taking this medication.
