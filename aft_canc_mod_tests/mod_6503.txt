History of Present Illness: 79 year old male with known severe mitral regurgitation, moderate mitral valve prolapse and progressive shortness of breath referred for cardiac catheterization and surgery.

Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided filling pressures with v waves to 25mm Hg.
Atelectasis at the left base is slightly worse.
[**2166-1-14**] ECHO PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The [**Location (un) **] transvalvular gradient is approximately 7 mm Hg with the valve area approximately 2.3 cm2.
Biventricular systolic function is preserved and similar to pre-bypass function.
Brief Hospital Course: Presented for cardiac catheterization as preoperative workup and was admitted post procedure.
He completed preoperative evaluation and on hospital day two he was brought to the operating room for coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve replacement surgery.
