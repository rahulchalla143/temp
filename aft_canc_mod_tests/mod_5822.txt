These episodes reverted spontaneously within ~30seconds before any treatments or EKGs could be initiated Her exam was notable for RUQ tenderness.
Her Tbili was at baseline, her lactate was 1.7, and she did not have a leukocytosis.
Urinalysis was negative, blood and urine cultures were sent.
A RUQ ultrasound showed expected pneumobilia with pancreatic ductal dilation.
A CT abdomen and pelvis showed proper stent placement with biliarly ductal dilation, and incidental cecal thickening.
ERCP fellow was made aware of the admission and recommended an ERCP tomorrow.
Chronic systolic and diastolic CHF 7.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2185-11-6**]): 1.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND ([**2185-11-6**]): 1.
TTE ([**2185-11-10**]): The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2).
CHEST RADIOGRAPH ([**2185-11-9**]): In comparison with the study of [**11-6**], there has been placement of a right subclavian PICC line that extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
Blood cultures ([**12-1**] set) grew out GNR within first 24 hours.
Sensitivities revealed E coli sensitive to only Zosyn; further antibiotic sensitivities are pending.
On readmission to medicine floor, antibiotic regimen was changed to meropenem given identification of E coli as an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producer.
For remainder of hospital course heart rate well-maintained with metoprolol and diltiazem PO.
