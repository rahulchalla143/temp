Application of negative pressure dressing (20 sq cm).
At rehab her HCT was 28.8 on [**1-13**].5 on [**1-14**].6 on [**1-18**], and 27.8 on [**1-19**].
At [**Hospital3 **] patient was tachycardiac to 140, had systolic blood pressure of 130.
Her HCT was 25.5 at [**Hospital3 4107**].
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], BP was 118/61, HR 132.
HCT was 25.
Exam was notable for large blood clots per rectum.
Throughout ED course HR ranged 120s - 160s (a. fib) and systolic blood pressure ranged 110s - 130s.
Vitals on transfer are 136 131/56 23 99% 2L.
Tobacco: [**1-8**] cig/day x 30 years, quit many years ago.
Neuro: CNII-XII intact   Pertinent Results: TTE [**1-23**]: Cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation with an uncontrolled ventricular rate.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
LV function appears depressed due to uncontrolled ventricular rate (the left ventricular ejection fraction during beats following a normal diastolic filling period is normal).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-5-2**], the pericardial effusion is smaller.
Tagged RBC Scan [**1-23**]: Hemorrhage beginning at 8 minutes.
Based on her progressive decline, and likely irreversibility of her multiple conditions, family meeting was held with the pt's son on [**2140-2-3**] with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 636**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29286**] present.
Patient had a history of diverticular disease and known hemorrhoidal disease as well as a lower GIB in [**2139-7-6**] requiring a total of 18 units pRBCs.
Patient underwent tagged RBC scan which identified the source of the bleeding as the sigmoid colon but no bleeding was seen on subsequent IR imaging so no interventions were performed.
She had no further episodes of acute bleeding during her stay and her hematocrits remained stable .
CT head was negative, and VBG did not reveal significant hypercapnia.
After initial bleed subsided, she was restarted on her home beta-blocker and her rates were well-controlled for some time.
on [**4-8**], her tachycardia to 140s became more persistent, and pt required frequent bolus doses of IV metoprolol to keep her HR below 130s.
Her creatinine worsened with both volume resuscitation and diuresis.
Urine lytes were consistent with intravascular volume depletion.
TTE during this admission showed severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], and likely depressed systolic function, which was difficult to quantify, given rapid heart rate.
She was gently diuresed as her blood pressures would tolerate.
# Leukocytosis: Patient with known MDS and baseline WBC ranging between 10 - 20,000.
Leukocytosis was attributed to patient's many sources of infection including ongoing C.diff, UTI, and hip infection.
Her troponin was slightly elevated from baseline (0.05) but CK and CK MB remained flat and serial enzymes showed downtrending troponin.
