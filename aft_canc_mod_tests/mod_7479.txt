She first noticed the onset of symptoms in [**Month (only) **] or [**Month (only) 1096**] and then was alerted by a friend to her increasing jaundice, which prompted medical evaluation.
At [**Hospital3 3583**], her labs were as follows: total bilirubin 28, Alk phos 338, ALT 128 prior to arrival.
She underwent an ultrasound and a CT with contrast and was found to have a 2.4 x 1.8 cm mass with a cystic structre in the head of the pancreas, distended and thickened gallbladder, intrahepatic (1.9 cm)and pancreatic duct (1.2 cm).
She underwent ERCP which revealed a single irregular stricture of malignant appearance that was 2 cm long at the lower third of the common bile duct.
A limited pancreatogram revealed a stricture of the main duct at the head.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification.
Cytology samples were obtained for histology which returned positive for adenocarcinoma.
From her OSH scan report, she had no involvement of the mesenteric vessels and no evidence of metastatic disease, although there is periportal lymphadenopathy.

Given down-trending platelets, HIT panel was sent and returned positive on POD5, and the patient was begun on a bivalirudin drip per hematology recommendations.
On POD6 TF were initiated via NGT, her foley was removed, and sputum cultures revealed GNR for which she was begun on vancomycin/ciprofloxacin/flagyl.
