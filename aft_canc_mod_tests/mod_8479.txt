The patient was found to have an NSTEMI (OSH Trop 0.37 from 0.02 a week ago) and ARF (Cr 2.2 from 1.6).
He was given ASA; however, given that he had a mediastinoscopy on [**3-7**] he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for thoracics eval prior to starting a heparin gtt.
In our ED, initial HR 81, BP 119/60 with O2 sat of 95% on 4L.
EKG notable for new ST depressions in V5-V6.
Cardiac enzymes positive (Trop 0.46, CK: 123 MB: 10 MBI: 8.1).
CXR with mild overload, grossly unchanged from prior.
At ~3am a blood transfusion was begun.

Micro: [**3-20**] Urine and blood NGTD [**3-22**] Sputum NGTD .
CXR [**3-18**]: IMPRESSION: Multifocal airspace opacity superimposed on a background of chronic interstitial lung disease, with recurrent pleural effusions.
TTE [**3-19**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %) with global hypokinesis and thinned, akinetic basal inferior and infero-lateral segments.
CT chest [**3-21**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis with EF 15-20%, and chest xray showed mild pulmonary edema with moderate pleural effusions.
His acute hypoxia partly coincides with receiving IVF for possible cardiac catheterization and blood transfusion on the morning of transfer.
Initial differential included CHF, PE, PNA, and lymphagitic spread of tumor, all coinciding with underlying COPD.
Given initial concern for PE, CT angiogram and LENIs were considered, however given patient's renal insufficiency, it was decided that he should not receive IV contrast.
In addition, after his ECHO showed dramatically low EF with pulmonary edema on imaging, suspicion for PE decreased and LENIs were not obtained.
Despite successful diuresis, the patient continued to require high-flow facemask O2, and thus Chest CT was obtained.
Chest CT showed severe emphysema and evidence of CHF.
For his CHF with EF 15-20%, he will need close cardiology follow up with Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3733**] to be arranged on Monday after discharge.
