CT of his abdomen revealed a large right kidney mass.
Staging workup was otherwise negative.
Chest CT in [**2136-2-13**] revealed large lung nodules consistent with renal cell metastases.
Patient was evaluated here for high-dose IL-2 treatment program and found to meet eligibility criteria.
Vital signs:  98.6, 76, 18, 113/68, and O2 saturation 98% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.
ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  WBC 5.0, hematocrit 29.3, platelet count 332,000.
BUN 19, creatinine 1.2, sodium 142, potassium 4.1, chloride 105, CO2 30.
ALT 26, AST 13, CPK 60, alkaline phosphatase 75, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 3.4, calcium 8.4, phosphorus 5.1, magnesium 2.0, uric acid 6.
Admission weight was noted to be 83.8 kg and he was dosed with IL-2 600,000 IU/kg equaling 50.3 mIU IV q.8h.
for 14 planned doses, [**11-27**] scheduled doses with dose #11 held due to hypotension and doses 13 and 14 held related to mild neurotoxicity and severe constitutional side-effects.
He was eventually weaned from his pressors on day 11, but was noted to have a CPK of 475 at that time.
CK MB and troponin values were also elevated.
Cardiology felt his rhythm strip was from artifact rather than true ventricular tachycardia.
Echocardiogram revealed mild aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation with a left ventricular ejection fraction slightly decreased at 50-55%.
Cardiac enzymes continued to trend downward and he remained without any arrhythmia on telemetry.
He was planned for an outpatient stress test to further evaluate cardiac function.
His hemoglobin and hematocrit on [**2136-3-21**] were 9.4 and 28.9 respectively, and he was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells to help support his blood pressure.
He had a mild thrombocytopenia with a minimum platelet count of 72,000 thought related to IL-2, which had improved to 98,000 on the day of discharge and developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of 4.3 on [**3-24**], improved to 1.5 on [**3-24**]; mild transaminitis with an ALT of 46 and an AST of 63 on [**2136-3-24**] again improved before discharge.
He had a mild renal insufficiency with a peak creatinine of 1.8 improved to 1.1 on the day of discharge.
He will have an outpatient thallium stress test performed prior to his next planned week of IL-2 therapy.
