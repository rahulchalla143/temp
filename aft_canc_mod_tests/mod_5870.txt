The patient called her primary care physician who scheduled [**Name Initial (PRE) **] lower extremity venous duplex at [**Hospital1 190**] which showed bilateral deep venous thromboses.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.9 F.; blood pressure 85/47; pulse 110; respiratory rate 20; O2 saturation on room air 97%.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or rhonchi, breath sounds normal.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 17.6, hemoglobin 10.7, hematocrit 33.7, platelets 99.
Sodium 129, potassium 4.7, chloride 93, bicarbonate 24, BUN 39, creatinine 1.6 with baseline 0.4 to 0.7; glucose 403 (corrected sodium 133).
Coags with PT 30, PTT 150, INR 6.
Repeat coags with PT 24, PTT 47.6, INR 3.8.
Given the high index of suspicion for pulmonary embolism in the setting of metastatic cancer, it was decided to order a CT angiogram to evaluate the possibility of pulmonary emboli.
Subsequent CT showed significant filling defects in the pulmonary circulation representing massive bilateral pulmonary emboli.
She was in sinus tachycardia with heart rate in the low 100s with no ectopy seen at the time.
Her blood pressure continued to be in the low 80s and respiratory rate between 12 and 16 breaths per minute.
Her pulses remained Dopplerable and palpable.
Her O2 saturation remained in the high 90s on two liters of nasal cannula; lungs remained clear.
Intravenous fluids were continued as needed to maintain blood pressure.
The patient was preload dependent and needed boluses to maintain her blood pressure.
The patient was provided with intravenous fluids in the form of normal saline through boluses and normal infusion, however, urine output did not respond appropriately.
Urinalysis was sent which results were consistent with a urinary tract infection.
Of note, her urinalysis showed nitrites, leukocyte esterase, 6 to 10 red blood cells, 21 to 50 white blood cells, many bacteria, 11 to 20 transitional epithelial cells.
She was subsequently started on Levaquin for therapy at 500 mg q. day by mouth, however, urine output remained minimal.
A fractional excretion of sodium determined the patient to be prerenal indicating a need for further hydration.
During the course of her hospital stay, the patient's blood glucose remained within normal limits using Glyburide and insulin sliding scale.
Her electrolytes were noted to be low, specifically magnesium and potassium.
These electrolytes were subsequently replaced with normal values and filling.
