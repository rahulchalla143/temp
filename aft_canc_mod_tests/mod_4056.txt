Head CT there with pontine hemorrhage.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
On initial arrival, heart rate 70-80s and sinus, BP 138/90, oxygen 93/RA and 98%/2L.
Repeat head CT showed interval worsening in the size of her bleed, from 8-12 mm.
While in ED, she went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response; Diltiazem 20mg IV resulted in rate control.
On several occasions, her oxygen saturation drooped into the 80s.
Physical Exam: Tm: 99.0  Tc: 98.4  BP: 97/69 (97-150/66-87)  HR: 78 (76-140s) Vent AC 600x12 ([**11-14**]) with FiO2 0.40 Gen: WD/WN, sitting up in bed comfortably, NAD.
Sensation: Decreased to light touch over left hemibody.
Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right     1 1 1  0  0 Left      1 1 1  0  0  Grasp reflex absent.
Pertinent Results: [**2114-9-17**] 12:20PM   WBC-8.1 RBC-4.15* HGB-12.1 HCT-35.0* MCV-84 MCH-29.1 MCHC-34.5 RDW-14.1 [**2114-9-17**] 12:20PM   NEUTS-74.4* LYMPHS-21.2 MONOS-3.5 EOS-0.5 BASOS-0.5 [**2114-9-17**] 12:20PM   PLT COUNT-258 [**2114-9-17**] 12:20PM   PT-18.9* PTT-29.3 INR(PT)-2.2 [**2114-9-17**] 12:20PM   GLUCOSE-107* UREA N-15 CREAT-0.6 SODIUM-141 POTASSIUM-3.9 CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-32* ANION GAP-12 [**2114-9-17**] 12:20PM   CALCIUM-9.1 PHOSPHATE-3.5 MAGNESIUM-1.9  ----- CT head w/o contrast [**2114-9-17**]: A rounded hyperdensity is again noted in the right pontomedullary junction.
----- MRI head w/o contrast and MRA head [**2114-9-17**]: Multiplanar T1 and T2W images of the brain was obtained.
Correlation is made to the CT examination dated [**2114-9-17**].
As seen on the CT examination, there is a small 1 cm lesion of increased T2 signal along the right pontomedullary junction which demonstrates magnetic susceptibility on gradient echo images suggestive of a small cavernoma or a calcified lesion due to the increased density seen on the CT exam and magnetic susceptibility.
Additional evaluation of the brain with Gadolinium enhanced MRI in both axial and coronal planes would be recommended.
The exam is insensitive to detect tiny aneurysms less than 3 mm in diameter.
----- CT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis [**2114-9-20**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular and prevascular regions, the largest is in the left supravicular region measuring approximately 12 x 19 mm.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, ureters, and small/large bowel loops are unremarkable.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The uterus, adnexa, sigmoid colon, rectum, distal ureters, and urinary bladder are unremarkable.
----- MRI head with and without contrast [**2114-9-22**]: Since the previous MRI study there is now evidence of subacute hemorrhage with increased T1 and decreased T2 signal identified in the right side of the pontomedullary junction.
A second area of increased T2 signal with subtle enhancement is identified in the left middle cerebral peduncle which is unchanged from the previous study.
Neuro checks were performed every hour.
Goal systolic blood pressure was <130.
Repeat MRI with gadolinium to assess for underlying mass demonstrated enhancement of hemorrhagic mass and second enhancing lesion in cerebellum.
Chest XRay showed opacification of right hemithorax and mediastinal shift.
Chest CT demonstrated multiple enlarged lymph nodes, collapsed right lung and left sided pleural based density concerning for malignancy.
TSH was within normal limits.
Sputum culture showed S. Aurea.
Urine culture had gram positive bacteria.
Potassium KCL   Discharge Medications: 1.
