The patient was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in [**2183-7-21**] and underwent a radiofrequency ablation of the nodule in [**2183-9-20**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 95.8, his heart rate was 81, his blood pressure was 126/80, his respiratory rate was 20, and 95% on room air.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Respiratory examination clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal examination revealed the abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Femoral, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibialis pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram preoperatively revealed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 78 without any ST segment changes.
A chest x-ray was clear without any acute cardiopulmonary process.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 4.8, his hematocrit was 42, and his platelets were 174.
Sodium was 139, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 105, bicarbonate was 26, blood urea nitrogen was 12, creatinine was 0.8, and his blood glucose was 102.
Calcium was 9.6, his phosphate was 4.6, and his magnesium was 1.
Aspartate aminotransferase was 36, alanine-aminotransferase was 44, alkaline phosphatase was 79, and his total bilirubin was 1.3.
Prothrombin time was 13.8, his partial thromboplastin time was 31.8, with an INR of 1.3.
The patient's aspartate aminotransferase and alanine-aminotransferase levels were elevated postoperatively, which was expected.
Because the patient's INR was 2 postoperatively, the patient was given 2 units of fresh frozen plasma and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate.
The patient's liver function tests numbers were appropriately coming down, and during this time the patient was prophylactically covered with two days of Unasyn.
The patient received intravenous ganciclovir, and the patient was continued on anti hepatitis B surface antigen/antibody which was started intraoperatively.
On each of the days the patient received the medications, the patient's tidal levels were 450.
The patient underwent an ultrasound of the liver on postoperative day one which showed normal arterial and venous phase as well as patent ......... portal vein.
Because of the elevations in the total bilirubin which peaked at 40.2, on postoperative day four the patient underwent an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the liver which did not show any evidence of acute cellular rejection.
The patient also underwent a repeat Duplex ultrasound of the liver which showed a patent arterial and venous supply to the liver with normal resistive indices.
The patient also underwent tube cholangiogram which showed good common bile duct anastomosis without any biliary leak and without any evidence of obstruction or stricture.
By then, the patient's total bilirubin was trending downward, and by postoperative day nine the patient's total bilirubin came down to 3.4 with a decrease in the aspartate aminotransferase, alanine-aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels as well.
Laboratory values on discharge were a white blood cell count of 6.7, a hematocrit of 35.5, and platelets of 221.
Sodium was 132, potassium was 4.3, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 23, blood urea nitrogen was 16, creatinine was 0.9, and his blood glucose was 108.
Calcium was 8.2, his magnesium was 1.7, and phosphate was 4.3.
Aspartate aminotransferase was 176, his alanine-aminotransferase was 460, his alkaline phosphatase was 57, and his total bilirubin was 3.4.
The patient was to have his laboratories drawn every Monday and Thursday morning for complete blood count, Chemistry-10, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and cyclosporin level drawn exactly two hours after a.m. Neoral dose.
