Initial Hct was 35.7.
An NG lavage was performed with 250 cc NS with yellow bilious return.
In the unit he underwent tagged RBC scan which showed bleeding in LLQ, however angio was negative.
He received 3 units of PRBC and hct remained stable thereafter.

hct 26 -> 28 ->30.6 ([**9-15**] 7PM) INR 1.9 Tagged RBC scan [**9-14**] - Gastrointestinal bleeding in left lower quadrant .
Angio [**9-14**] - IMPRESSION: 1.
Right transfemoral approach 5-French vascular sheath left in place due to patient's anticoagulated status .
Tagged RBC scan [**9-16**] - INTERPRETATION:  Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and delayed images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were obtained.
A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.
Blood flow images show prompt flow of tracer through the aorta and iliac arteries.
Delayed blood pool images show no evidence of bleeding within the GI tract.
#GI bleed: The patient had several episodes of bright red blood per rectum during his admission, and although his Hct did drop slightly, it remained stable at 28 and the patient was asymptomatic.
Initial tagged RBC scan with LLQ bleeding, however angio was negative.
He had more episodes of BRBPR after having a negative angio, so he had a repeat tagged RBC scan that was negative [**9-16**].
IR did not feel repeat angio was indicated given the negative tagged red cell scan.
Therefore, GI did colonoscopy and EGD and patient had subsequent virtual [**Last Name (un) **] secondary to poor prep (unable to visualize the cecum) which were negative for active bleeding but demonstrated severe diverticulosis.
We restarted heparin gtt secondary to MVR and afib, under very tight control with goal PTT between 40-80 and began to re-bridge to coumadin on [**9-17**].
He received 1unit of pRBC's and his Hct bumped appropriately over 30, where it remained stable until discharge.
# NSVT - On [**9-17**], the patient experienced a 15 run of VT. His electrolytes were normal, last echo [**11-29**] with EF 40%.
We restarted coumadin on [**9-17**] and he was sent home with INR of 3.5 (goal 2.5-3.5).
#CHF: Stable, restarted Lasix at 20 mg po qday to be changed per PCP as an outpatient.
Please have your INR checked on [**9-29**].
