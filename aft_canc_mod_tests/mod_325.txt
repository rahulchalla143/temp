Limb ataxia 0 8.

Dysarthria 1 11.
Extinction 0  NIHSS Total 8  Head CT performed at 10:02AM without obvious signs acute bleed.
Labs INR 1.1, Cr 1.6 (b/l 1.5) and FS 110.
Given seizure history, patient was taken for stat MRI which was suggestive of restricted diffusion in the left pons, limited T2 scan due to movemennt.
In [**11-23**], patient presented to ED with R UMN facial and dysarthria, MRA was performed which was negative for clot.
W/u also included an EEG and toxic infectious w/u which was negative.

MRI [**7-13**]: Focus of increased signal on diffusion images in the upper pons on the left side could be due to acute infarct or T2 shine-through.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
MRI showed a left pontine stroke.
Followup CT showed no hemorrhage.
EEG showed no focal epileptiform discharges.
An echo showed new aortic regurgitation concerning for endocarditis, thought to perhaps explain his mental status.
However, subsequent TEE showed no vegetation and blood cultures were negative.
LP was attempted at the bedside but was unsuccessful; it was later performed under fluoroscopic guidance, which revealed bony abnormalities around the L3-L4 interspace.
CSF was not consistent with meningitis; several viral PCR studies were pending at the time of discharge.
Routine work-up revealed an LDL > 200, and so he was started on a statin.
CTA to look for stenosis or embolic source showed no clear etiology.
