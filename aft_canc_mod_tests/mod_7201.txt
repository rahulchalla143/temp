Temperature is 100.4.
ADMISSION LABORATORY:  Hematocrit of 25.2, platelet count 51,000 after transfusion, which originally was 5000.
Glucose 105.
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates.
MRI showed some enhancement over the right side of the brain.
A lumbar puncture was performed and there was a question of meningitis for which he was treated with Acyclovir, Vanco, Clindamycin and Ceftriaxone.
However, his platelet count still became a significant problem.
A very long conversation was again had with the patient and his family about options and it was thought that perhaps the only way for the patient to have a reasonable life was to have a splenectomy, which may decrease the patient's requirement for platelet transfusion.
Therefore on [**2126-3-1**] the patient underwent a splenectomy, which was uncomplicated.
