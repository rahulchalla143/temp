Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with three vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal right sided pressures (mean RA 7 mmHg), severely elevated pulmonary (mean PA 45 mmHg), and mildly elevated left sided pressures (LVEDP 15 mmHg) with no gradient upon movement of the catheter from the ventricle back to the aorta and a normal cardiac index (4.8 l/min/m2).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls.
Patient underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting of his LCX which was uncomplicated.
He was diuresed with Lasix drip and Diuril to which he was able to put out significant amounts of urine (up to 2 liters over 24 hours).
He had significant improvement in his respiratory status within 24 hours with improvement in pulmonary edema on chest x-ray and was satting 95 % on RA by discharge.
Renal: On admission creatinine was 10.3 indicative of ARF on CRF likely secondary to myeloma.
His creatinine was 4.5 at discharge.
Free calcium levels ranged from 1.19-1.30.
Medications on Admission: Hydralazine 20 mg [**Hospital1 **] Postassium Cl ER Micro 20 meq QD Toprol-XL 200 mg p.o.
These can be added back by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] as your blood pressure dictates.
