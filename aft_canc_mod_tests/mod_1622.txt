He was admitted to the Medicine service on [**5-1**] for work-up of his weakness.
Blood cultures x 2 were performed on both days.
On [**5-3**] blood cultures from [**5-2**] were reported to be growing gram-negative rods in [**3-16**] bottles and he was started on ciprofloxacin & metronidazole.
On the morning of [**5-4**], he became hypotensive to 90/doppler with HR 102-104 (previously SBP's 100-120, HR 60-80), and was transferred to the MICU for management of GNR sepsis.
He reports decreased appetite for several months and recent "projectile" diarrhea from his ostomy which he attributes to a recent dose of magnesium citrate.
Bone marrow biopsy done on [**2152-10-30**] was notable for a marrow cellularity of 28-30%, interstitial infiltrate of plasma cells occurring singly and in clusters.
By CD138 immunohistochemical staining, plasma cells were 5-10% of marrow cellularity.

MRI SPINE [**2153-5-2**]: 1.
Multilevel degenerative changes are stable compared to the studies performed earlier this year.
MRI Head [**5-2**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process, intracranial mass or obvious osseous destruction in the visualized calvarium.
CT abd/pelvis [**5-4**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**5-4**]: IMPRESSION: Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis.
A RUQ u/s showed gallbladder wall edema, cholelithiasis, CT abdomen showed gallbladder edema, suggestive of cholecystitis.
He was double covered for gram negatives (plus additional gram positive and anaerobic coverage) initially; this was narrowed to cipro/flagyl once speciation completed.
Surveillance cultures remained negative (last positive culture [**5-2**]).
Stool culture negative.
MRI spine as above.
He had EMG showing complex abnormalities including moderate, chronic, generalized, sensorimotor polyneuropathy that is predominantly axonal with evidence for a superimposed moderate, chronic and ongoing, L2-4 polyradiculopathy on the right.
Stool cultures and C.diff were negative.
Please fax results to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7306**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 28907**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 28908**].
We also did further workup of your weakness.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have temperature greater than 100.3, lightheadedness, headache, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, or any new symptom that you are concerned about.
We are planning for you to have a lumbar puncture by our radiologists on Wednesday or Thursday ([**5-16**] or 5th).
Please have your INR checked on [**Month (only) 766**].
