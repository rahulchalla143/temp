Biopsy confirmed this lesion to be a hepatocellular carcinoma for which he underwent radiofrequency ablation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Preoperatively, the patient's temperature was 99.2, heart rate 72, blood pressure 118/62, respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation 99% in room air.
Pulmonary examination revealed lungs that were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Abdominal examination was soft, nontender, nondistended, no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly.
Rectal examination was guaiac negative with normal tone.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was 2.9, hematocrit 41.1, platelet count 77,000.
Sodium was 142, potassium 4.0, chloride 107, bicarbonate 23, blood urea nitrogen 9, creatinine 0.8.
Prothrombin time was 13.0, partial thromboplastin time was 33.0 and INR was 1.2.
ALT was 115, AST was 107, alkaline phosphatase was 140, total bilirubin was 1.1 with a direct bilirubin of 0.5.
Calcium was 8.7, magnesium 1.6, phosphate 3.5.
Urinalysis was negative.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 77 beats per minute, no ST changes.
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates and no evidence for congestive heart failure.
Cardiac workup included echocardiogram from [**2170-4-9**], which showed an ejection fraction of 60 to 65%, normal valves.
Stress test from [**2170-4-9**], showed no ischemia.
Tissue typing samples were sent to [**Hospital6 15291**].
At the postoperative check, the white blood cell count was 6.0, hematocrit 35.8, platelet count 85,000.
Total bilirubin was 1.4, ALT 254, AST 615, and alkaline phosphatase was 69.
One unit of platelets was administered for a platelet count of 84,000 the evening following the operation.
On postoperative day one, the patient was extubated and his hematocrit remained stable.
Total bilirubin was noted to be elevated to 3.2 from 1.4 the previous day and was thought to be likely secondary to preservation injury.
Total bilirubin increased to 3.5, and an ultrasound of the allograft liver was performed with no evidence of thrombus.
However, there was evidence of hemostatic material and blood products present in [**Location (un) 6813**] pouch.
On postoperative day four, a decreased hematocrit was noted down to 18.7 from 27.5 previously.
On postoperative day five from the original operation, postoperative day one from the second, the patient was extubated and he was given two units of packed red blood cells and four units of platelets for a hematocrit of 28.6 and a platelet count of 54,000, respectively.
An ultrasound of the liver was obtained which showed normal flow and there was simple fluid found in [**Location (un) 6813**] pouch which was not consistent with hematoma.
On postoperative day seven, a duplex ultrasound of the liver was obtained which showed normal flow.
