Tumor lysis labs were monitored without significant findings.
Likely due to tumor infiltration, white thrombi +/- HSV pneumonia vs. pneumonitis (see below).
Chest x-ray after extubation suggests aspiration pneumonia.
The patient had blood, urine, CSF cultures without growth to date.
The patient had multiple CT scans and MRI's without signs of pathology.
HSV, HHV-6, EBV, [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] and BK virus PCR's were sent.
CT head revealed an occipital hypodensity.
MR brain suggested diffuse bilateral occipital lobe haziness of unclear significance.
FENA of .4% c/w pre-renal etiology in the setting of new-onset CHF.
Urine eos negative.
Her Cr trended downwards and was 1.6 at time of discharge.
EF 30% on echo [**2146-4-13**], new onset.
Repeat echo on [**2146-4-21**] revealed a normalized EF and beta blocker was discontinued.
Repeat ECHO was consistent with depressed EF.
The patient developed a marked transaminitis at the time of transfer out of the intensive care unit with AST and ALT to >200.
She underwent an MRI of the liver revealing no signs of hepatosplenic candidiasis or other pathology.
The patient's hepatitis serologies revealed prior Hep A infection, negative Hep C and past immunization for Hep B. HIV serology was negative.
The patient's amylase/lipase were trended and normalized by time of discharge.
Her low bp was felt possibly secondary to early sepsis, however cortisol testing revealed very low cortisol levels (0.8).
The patient had HSV swabs sent and were positive for the virus.
Blood sugars normalized after she came off TPN and was able to take in sufficient PO.
All antidopaminergic agents, including haldol and zyprexa were held.
Review of the limited EEG obtained revealed encephalitis pattern without apparent seizure activity.
EEG monitoring closer to discharge was unchanged.
