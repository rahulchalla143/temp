Her systolic BP had a nadir in the 60s for about 15 minutes and a MAP in the 40s, she had been tachycardic up to 150 during this time.

Tissue Pathology ([**2102-10-5**]) of uterine fibroid: Pending  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 31 yo F w/ a h/o significant uterine fibroids, presented for elective multiple myomectomy for extensive fibroid removal on [**10-5**], complicated by large intra-operative blood loss requiring massive transfusion protocol.
Massive transfusion protocol was begun, and patient received 11 units PRBCs, 8 units of FFP, and 2 units of platelets.
Urine output during this 6 hour operation was 850cc.
Patient was monitored for signs of rebleeding, with serial hematocrits and coags.
An active type and screen was maintained.
Patient required 1 unit PRBCs on [**2102-10-6**] for an acute hct drop from 30 to 25.6, which responded appropriately to 28.8.
Serial hematocrits and coags were measured q6h and remained stable.
Initial CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Patient was initially placed on assist control with 450 tidal volume X 16 RR with a PEEP of 5 and Fi)2 of 40%.
An ABG was obtained post extubation and was within normal limits.
Given the patient also had sinus tachycardia, we obtained a CTA chest to rule out pulmonary embolism and this study showed no evidence of PE.
Urine and blood cultures were sent.
CXR was unremarkable.
UA was neg for infection.
Cultures are negative to date.
Pt could benefit from an ECHO later as an outpatient to investigate this finding further.
