Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Although IV contrast usage would likely be difficult in this patient with renal failure, but a CT scan or MRI suggested for delineating anatomy in the upper abdomen.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: Her blood pressure stabilized and her mental status improved, allowing transfer to the floor in stable condition [**8-17**] 9 PM.
Echo [**8-17**] showed normal LVEF >55% with normal LV size and no significant valvular disease (some aortic valve leaflet thickening).
1) SOB: On further eval of CXR, pt believed to have increased opacity in LLL.
Blood cultures were no growth.
Pt had lateral ST changes in ED but cardiac enzymes remained negative, so believed from strain.
Pt's hematocrit was around 26.
Renal ultrasound showed bilateral renal cysts, no evidence of obstruction or hydro.
Also will hold doxazosin as blood pressure well controlled.
Deep shave biopsy done; can follow up as outpatient.
