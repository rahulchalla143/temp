On review of CT scan after colonoscopy, there was a concern for ventral hernia possibly causing paroxysmal attacks of abdominal pain.

Imaging: CXR ([**12-1**]): PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Cardiac silhouette size is normal.
CT abdomen and pelvis ([**12-1**]): FINDINGS: CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There is dependent bibasilar atelectasis.
The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
A heterogeneous mass in the interpolar region of the right kidney is again noted, measuring 3.4 x 3.4 cm (601B:49) as seen on recent CT of the abdomen and pelvis.
CT OF THE PELVIS: A 6-cm segment of terminal ileum with mural edema, mucosal hyperenhancement, surrounding fat stranding and mild luminal narrowing is present, which appears similar when compared to the prior study.
Other areas of small bowel wall thickening seen on the prior CT from [**11-23**], [**2157**] are not present on the current exam.
Terminal ileitis and focal colitis, not significantly changed from the prior CT from [**2158-11-24**] now causing upstream small-bowel obstruction.
Again, urological consultation is recommended, and an MRI can be obtained for further evaluation.
KUB ([**12-3**]): There is diffuse distention of small bowel loops measuring up to 4.2 cm.
IMPRESSION: stable small bowel obstruction compared to prior CT from [**12-1**].
MR Enterography ([**12-6**]): FINDINGS: There is a small bowel obstruction with dilated loops of small bowel measuring up to 3.5 cm, little changed in extent since the prior CT from [**2158-12-1**].
The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, left kidney, both adrenal glands are unremarkable.
The rectum and sigmoid colon, demonstrating diverticulosis, are decompressed.
Brief Hospital Course: 82F with h/o HTN, HLD, chronic 2yr h/o paroxysmal abdominal pain of unclear etiology p/w recurrent abdominal pain and CT evidence of SBO.
# Bowel Obstruction:  The patient on admission had CT evidence of obstruction with recent nausea and vomiting, current burping, and no recent flatus.
Her abdominal exam was benign with some mild distension.
An NGT was placed for abdominal decompression.
MR Enterography performed for diagnostic purposes [**12-6**] revealed continued obstruction due to persistent cecal inflammation.
# Ileitis and enterocolitis:  Recent workup was concerning for ventral hernia, chronic mesenteric ischemia, inflammatory bowel disease, infectious colitis, and malignancy.
There was no clear evidence by imaging or prior colonoscopy as to the etiology of this finding.
Blood and urine cultures were unrevealing.
Likely due to contrast load from CT [**11-24**].
Transitional Issues: - Continue follow-up of renal mass with Urology as outpatient (appt with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] - Continue follow-up with Gastroenterology (appt in early [**Month (only) **]) - Blood and urine cultures pending  Following above hospital course, surgical consultation was obtained [**12-8**] for [**Month/Year (2) **] of terminal ileal stricture/small bowel obstruction demonstrated both clinically and on MR enterography.
Right IJ CVL and radial a-line were placed for improved access.
TTE postop demonstrated hypovolemia and goal directed resuscitation was pursued.
Vital signs were routinely monitored.
The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
[**12-9**] urine output improved and subsequently creatinine returned to [**Month/Year (2) 5348**].
[**12-11**] patient received boluses of crystalloid/ colloid in conjunction with lasix to support urine output with good effect.
They recommended several tests to continue the workup of your abdominal pain, including an MR enterography of the small bowel.
