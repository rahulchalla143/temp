CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no hemorrhage, mass, mass effect, edema, or shift of normally midline structures.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci with increased bifrontal CSF space are suggestive of age-related parenchymal atrophy.
Chest XRAY  FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is reviewed without comparison.
Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal, with left ventricular prominence, which could suggest underlying hypertension.
CT is recommended for further evaluation to exclude underlying mass.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2112-4-19**] at 10:33:19 AM Conclusions: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended to evaluate mitral valve morphology.
IMPRESSION: severe mitral regurgitation secondary to (probable) partial flail leaflet  RENAL U.S.  [**2112-4-20**] 1:29 PM  FINDINGS: The left kidney measures 10.4 cm and the right kidney measures 11.5 cm.
This is slightly increased in size when compared to the prior study of [**2104**], when it measured 2.8 cm.
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2112-4-20**] 11:04 AM  FINDINGS: Oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed today in collaboration with speech and language pathology.
- Head and c-spine ct negative, urine culture negative for UTI.
Echo done which showed severe MR.  Lasix currently on hold.
He was gently hydrated daily and Cr decreased to baseline of 1.5.
Creatinine on discharge 1.4.
Video barium swallow evaluation showed large Zenker's Diverticulum that collects and fills with po throughout po trials and eventually results in aspiration due to backflow of po into the pharynx.
He had a new finding on cxr that was pna vs pneumonitis s/p barium swallow.
Family and GI decided against EGD given he was hemodynamically stable and HCT stabilized after blood.
Discharge HCT 30.1.
Last colonoscopy [**2104**] with adenoma polyp removed and repeat suggested in three years, family reports it was not done.
Systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure - Echo shows severe 4+ mitral regurgitation with prolapsed leaflet.
- Goal weight is 163 lbs per cardiology records.
Home dose is 40mg alternating with 20 mg. - Keep K >4.0 and Mg >2.0.
Urinary retention - Foley catheter was inserted during ICU stay.
Bladder scan showed 700mL and foley was placed for 800mL urine.
He has a history of BPH and had a TURP in [**2094**].
Furosemide 20mg alt with 40mg daily 4.
Namenda 10mg [**Hospital1 **] 5. levocarnitine 2 caps twice daily 6.
Followup Instructions: Appointment scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] [**2112-5-4**] at 4:15pm for evaluation of the zenker's divertivulum.
