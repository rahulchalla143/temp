He went to his PCP 1 week ago for further w/u which included bloodwork and plain film radiography, neither of which were revealing.

IMAGING: [**2197-12-27**] ABD/PELVIC CT W/O CONTRAST: 1.
[**2198-1-3**] ABD/PELVIC CT W/CONTRAST: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient admitted with abdominal pain and underwent an abdominal CT showing high grade large bowel obstruction with markedly dilated right colon, as well as in the transverse colon up to the sigmoid flexure.
A CVL was placed and vancomycin and zosyn started for the intraperitoneal perforation.
On [**12-29**], blood cultures came back positive for GPR bacteremia, which later speciated into coryneform bacilli, clostridium species, as well as b. fragilis.
The vancomycin was discontinued on [**1-2**] and the zosyn is to be continued until [**2198-1-10**].
On [**2198-1-2**] - Hct was noted to be 21.7, transfused with 2 units of packed cells.
On [**1-3**], a CT of the abdomen was obtained due to the patient's overall picture and increasing WBC count.
This showed a large fluid collection which was then drained by IR on [**1-4**] with return of thin yellow fluid, with a creatinine of 1.0.
The drain continued to drain yellow fluid and the cultures were negative for any growth.
For this, he received a PICC line on [**2198-1-8**] and his CVL was subsequently removed.
He has follow up scheduled with both Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Oncology with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as his pathology came back as T4N0 adenocarcinoma of the colon.
