He underwent an ultrasound guided biopsy of his anterior mediastinal mass on [**7-23**].
Given elevated AFP (4093 on [**7-23**]) and biopsy of undifferentiated carcinoma, patient was treated for germ cell tumor with neoadjuvant cisplatin and etoposide from [**Date range (1) 73635**].

Given the apparent negative head CT scan of [**10-8**], it is possible that the hemorrhagic contents may not be acute or, less likely, that they might have developed in the relatively short interval between the two scans.
[**2171-10-23**]: Head MRI MPRESSION:  Since [**2171-10-12**], increase in size of right parietal leptomeningeal metastasis as well as the right frontal and left superior parietal metastases.
IMPRESSION:  Marked interval progression in size of all metastatic lesions since MRI of [**2171-10-23**].

Vancomycin, cefepime, tobramycin and flagyl were all re-started.
A tissue biopsy was obtained during tracheostomy.
L Spine MRI showed no metastases in the spine.
An LP on [**2171-10-18**] was negative for malignant cells.
A repeat Brain MRI showed an increase in size of brain metastases in just one week.
A CT scan done revealed edema and hemorrhage of known masses in the right parietal lobe.
A stat head CT was completed at that time, and neurosurgery evaluated the patient.
The patient's platelet count was monitored closely and he was transfused for a goal of 100 to avoid further bleeding.
Creatinine had increased from 0.4 to 1.0 on [**10-10**].
Renal sono showed renal parenchemal disease, but no hydrophrosis.
Urine eos are negative.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient developed thrombocytopenia after his chemotherapy, and was transfused frequently to keep his platelet count around 100, to avoid any further bleeding from his brain metastases.
On the morning of [**11-18**], the patient's condition had further deteriorated, and the decision was made to initiate a morphine drip.
