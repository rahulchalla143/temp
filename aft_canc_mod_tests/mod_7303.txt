CT head [**2114-10-14**] IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
CXR 's [**10-14**]: The marked interval changes are predominantly focused within the left lower lung with patchy opacity and air bronchograms and associated pleural effusion.
[**10-21**]:Accounting for technical and positional differences, there is no significant interval change.
EKG's [**10-14**]: Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response.
[**10-18**]:Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, average about 120 beats per minute.
Compared with previous tracing of [**2114-10-18**] ventricular response is somewhat faster.
Compared with previous tracing of [**2114-10-18**] QRS axis is more leftward.
Echocardiography [**10-19**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular EF is preserved (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-8-3**] the degree of mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension detected have increased.
If clinically indicated, a repat study after better rate/rhtyhm control may better define regional LV systolic function.
Cultures: Blood Cultures: negative UCx: >100,000 enterococcus sensitive to Vancomycin Legionella Urinary Antigen: negative UA: no WBC, no nitrites, no RBC's   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 30984**] is an 84 year-old with atrial fibrillation, COPD, metastatic colon cancer to liver and recurrent right pleural effusions who initially presented on [**10-14**] with altered mental status and was admitted to the hospital wards.
At the time of admission, he was noted to be hyperkalemic (K = 7) with a ABG showing 7.38/53/84 on 5 liter with bicarb >50 on Chem 7.
He was noted to have mycoclonus on exam consistent with hypercarbia and elevated bicarbonate.
He was also briefly started on Theophylline to increase his respiratory drive and to decrease his serum Co2 and bicarbonate levels.
An echo was obtained to evaluate heart function and found an EF >55% but severe MR which may have contributed to pulmonary edema.
In addition, it was noted that his CXR showed relatively little pleural effusion on the right side of his chest and a significant amount of pleural effusion on his left side.
Given his respiratory distress and severe hypercarbia, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation was offered although the patient's underlying lung disease or respiratory distress were unlikely to resolve.
Inititally, his HCT remained stable from 27-30.
On readmission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his INR climbed from 3.2->5.6->14.6->5.6.
He was initially typed and screened for transfusion, given vitamin K and given IVF as his blood pressure began decreasing and his mental status worsened.
His respiratory status did not permit EGD or colonoscopy without intubation.
All anti-hypertensives and atrial fibrillation rate controlling medications were held due to low blood pressures.
Afib with RVR: While on the hospital wards, he was noted to be in afib with RVR with HR 130's and SBP 100's.
An EKG showed afib with depressions in V4-V6 as complared to old.
Cardiac enzymes were then found to be negative.
# Enterococcal UTI: UA was bland but Urine Culture grew enteroccocus.
A speech/swallow evaluation showed no "overt" aspiration but could not rule out silent aspiration.
Radiologic speach and swallow evaluation could not be obtained given the pt's respiratory status.
Based on clinical exam while drinking, he most likely had silent aspiration and was at risk for aspiration pneumonitis/ PNA.
Fluticasone-Salmeterol 500-50 mcg/(1) [**Hospital1 **] 7.
