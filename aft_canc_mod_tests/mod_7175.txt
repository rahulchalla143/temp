Admission Date:  [**2141-12-2**]       Discharge Date: [**2142-1-1**]   Service: MICU  The patient is an 82-year-old female with multiple medical problems who presented initially on [**2141-12-2**] with complaints of short of breath, fatigue and low fever.
Repeat x-ray at the time showed an unchanged left lower lobe process verses atelectasis.
She also had a chest CT which showed no evidence of a pulmonary embolus and confirmed the left lower lobe infiltrate.
Over the following two weeks in the hospital the patient had a significantly elevated white blood count that rose from 32,000 to a peak of 113,000 on [**12-13**] with declining mental status and increased dyspnea and fatigue.
CT of the head was done and a repeat CTA was done on [**2141-12-13**] which was negative for an acute process of a pulmonary embolus.
The patient was sating 98 to 100% on four liters nasal cannula with stable vital signs including a blood pressure of 152/96, heart rate of 110, sinus tachycardia and respiratory rate in the 40's.
Had a pO2 from an arterial blood gases done on the day prior to obtundation showed 52 mm of mercury with a pulse oximetry of 98%  The patient was hemodynamically stable, she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for elective intubation secondary to respiratory distress and a change in mental status.
The patient's baseline white count is between 30 and 60,000 with increased lymphocytes.
She had a transthoracic echo done in [**3-20**] which showed an ejection fraction of greater than 55% with no focal wall motion abnormalities.
LABORATORY:  On admission to the Intensive Care Unit on [**2141-12-14**] included white count of 83,000, hematocrit 33.5, platelets 268 with an MCV of 115.
She had a PTT of 35, INR 1.8, prothrombin times 16, uric acid 3.2, sodium 137, potassium 3.6, chloride 108, bicarbonate 24, BUN 28, creatinine 0.7, glucose 152.
Calcium 8.2, magnesium 1.9, alk phos 2.5, uric acid of 3.2.
An ALT of 9, AST 22 and alk phos of 104.
LDH of 189.
An arterial blood gases done on [**2141-12-13**] was 7.48, 29, 53, and 4 liters nasal cannula.
Microbiology blood cultures times two on [**2141-12-14**] are pending.
Stool from [**12-8**] showed positive C. diff.
Sputum from [**12-4**] showed moderate yeast, positive E. coli, acid fast bacilli negative times three.
Urine culture from [**2141-12-4**] showed 10 to 100,000.
Imaging:  A chest x-ray from [**12-13**].
Chest x-ray shows persistent left lower lobe atelectasis and consolidation.
A CTA on the same day shows no pulmonary embolism.
It was a limited evaluation of the subsegmental arteries.
Head CT done on [**2141-12-13**] showed no hemorrhage or acute process and a CT of the abdomen on [**12-7**] showed no acute process, stable cyst in the right upper quadrant and right pelvis.
At this point an EMG was obtained to asses for patient weakness and the study was an abnormal study, the electrophysiologic findings most consistent with a moderately severe generalized myopathic process with active denervation.
The patient had a lumbar puncture done with the full cytometry revealing central nervous system involvement of her peripheral lymphoma.
Subsequent stool samples have not revealed this.
The patient was also seen to have both yeast in her urine and sputum and was treated with several day course of Fluconazole.
During the course of her hospital stay the patient had an echocardiogram which was done on [**2141-12-6**].
At that time she had an ejection fraction of 70% with some mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal systolic function.
A repeat electrocardiogram showed new Q-waves in the anterior and inferior leads.
A repeat echo which was done on [**2141-12-25**] revealed a markedly depressed ejection fraction of 20 to 30% The echo now also shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy in addition to a severely depressed left ventricular systolic function confirming a large anterior inferior infarction.
Her fingersticks should be checked four time a day and she should be covered according to the sliding scale.
The central nervous system tap revealed evidence of leukemic meningitis.
An EEG was also done which showed generalized swelling of the background along with bursts of generalized delta swelling overlying that consistent with a toxic, metabolic encephalopathy.
Her mental status improved over the course of her Intensive Care Unit stay to the point where she was able to follow commands and shake her head yes and no to questions.
She had a tracheostomy done on [**2141-12-29**].
Please follow her potassium levels every other day to ensure that her potassium levels are within the normal limits.
