Cx were drawn and given hx of recent line bacteremia(no + blood cx) which was empirically treated at [**Hospital1 2177**] w Vanc which finished on [**9-25**], pt was started empirically on IV Vanc.
CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis and PET scan had been negative for metastatic disease.
Pt had pre-op stress test on [**10-6**] which was negative.
On [**10-12**], the pt was taken to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy and extensive lysis of adhesions, choledochojejunostomy, en bloc resection of involved small bowel, abdominal wall and mass of tumor with primary jejunoileal anastomosis, and veritas patch closure of abdominal wall defect.
He was made NPO and was scheduled to have a CT scan to rule out a leak.
While being prepped for a CT scan, the pt was found to be unresponsive with agonal breathing and decrease in oxygen saturations.
The pt had a head CT which was negative for stroke or hemorrhage.
An abd CT scan showed thrombosis in the superior mesenteric artery and the right common iliac artery, unchanged since [**2139-9-29**], post-surgical changes following small bowel resection, and prominent small and large bowel loops consistent with ileus.
A chest CTA was negative for PE.
His Hct was discovered to be 17.5 and the pt was transfused for this.
It was not replaced as a cholangiography performed on [**10-28**] did not show bile leak.
His VAC was changed 2-3 days as needed.
His fistula continued to put out green colored fluid throughout his entire admission requiring frequent dressing changes.
Blood and urine cultures were taken which were negative.
A CXR was performed which suggested bilateral effusions versus atelectasis.
A limited venogram was obtained which revealed stenosis of the right subclavian and right IJ vein and low flow distally, suggestive of a possible brachieocephalic vein stenosis/SVC syndrome.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] agreed upon this only if further access could be done before the right line was discontinued.
When the patient went down for the venogram, imaging of his chest and abdomen was performed as well.
His chest CT reveals moderate sized bilateral effusions.
Body CT was consulted for thoracocentesis of these collections.
On [**11-20**], before the patient was to go to IR and body CT for such procedures, he received 2 units of PRBCs (Hct of 19) and 1 bag of platelets (plt=50).
Body CT was able to take off approximately 1 liter of fluid from his lungs which they sent for cytology and culture which were negative.
They sent the old tip for culture which was negative.
A MR venogram was obtained which showed thrombosis of left SV, IJ, right IJ, right BC, stenosis of superior SVC, and persistent b/l pleural effusions.
On [**11-26**], the patient was taken to IR and a SVC venoplasty was performed.
Ultrasound of lungs did not reveal any drainable fluid.
CXR noted LLL effusion which has been persistent.
He continues to have RR in low 20's, O2 sats >95%.
