She was also found to be hypotensive to the 90s and a Hct was found to be 26.
A non-contrast CT torso was attained and demonstrated a 20cm low attenuation mass with possible areas of bleeding, a small amount of perihepatic fluid, and ?new bibasilar atelectasis.
She was therefore given levofloxacin, solumedrol, and 1 unit of blood, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for hepatology management, hemodynamic monitoring, and possible IR procedure for hemostasis.
On arrival, her VS were 98.8 100/62 120 22 93%4L (on home O2 at baseline).
Our Radiology department assessed his OSH scans and provided the read described above.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: General Appearance: Overweight / Obese  Eyes / Conjunctiva: PERRL  Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic  Lymphatic: Cervical WNL, Supraclavicular WNL  Cardiovascular: (S1: Normal), (S2: Normal)  Peripheral Vascular: (Right radial pulse: Present), (Left radial pulse: Present), (Right DP pulse: Present), (Left DP pulse: Not assessed)  Respiratory / Chest: (Expansion: Symmetric), (Percussion: Resonant : ), (Breath Sounds: Diminished: )  Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, Bowel sounds present, Obese  Extremities: Right: 1+, Left: 1+  Skin:  Warm  Neurologic: Follows simple commands, Responds to: Verbal stimuli, Movement: Not assessed, Tone: Not assessed, Very sedated and moving slowly, appears encephalopathic   Pertinent Results: cxr [**3-12**]: Bibasilar atelectasis, however, no evidence of CHF exacerbation.
ct abd: Suggestion of lipomatous deposition in the interatrial septum of the heart.
Based on the characteristics, giant hemangioma is favored, but this remains incompletely characterized on this non-contrast study.
Further evaluation with multiphasic CT or MRI is recommended as allowed by the patient's renal function.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
She diuresed greater than two liters over her first 18 hours in the hospital and this, along with improved rate control in the setting of her probable diastolic dysfunction, significantly improved her subjective dyspnea and O2 requirement so that she was having reasonable O2 sats of 92-97 on 2 L by NC.
After falling asleep in a chair on her second night in the hospital she was extremely difficult to arouse the following morning with ABG showing a worsening of her chronic respiratory acidosis.
A. fib with RVR: Was in SVT on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and ventricular rate slowed with metoprolol 5mg IV x 1 and diltiazem 10mg IV x 2.
Eventually, she was placed on a diltiazem drip for improved rate control which led to improvement in her chest discomfort and dyspnea.
These incidents of pain were atypical, there were no EKG changes, and cardiac enzymes remained flat.
Her Cr was 2.4 at presentation and improved over her hospital course to 1.3 on the day of discharge.
They deferred pelvic exam as there was no further bleeding noted and her Hct remained stable.
