Further workup revealed on abdominal computed tomography three liver lesions.
Preliminary culture results indicated a gram-negative growth.
The patient was admitted for further workup of these liver lesions and management of them.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical examination, vital signs revealed temperature was 98.7 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure was 108/70, heart rate was 96, respiratory rate was 20, and she was saturating at 97% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed sclerae were anicteric.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient was alert and oriented times three; a nonfocal examination.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data revealed white blood cell count was 4 and hematocrit was 31.1.
CEA was 1.8.
Blood urea nitrogen was 17 and creatinine was 1.
AST was 17, ALT was 26, alkaline phosphatase was 121, and total bilirubin was 0.4.
The patient underwent a hepatic angiogram on [**2131-5-1**] which showed a focal near occlusion of the hepatic proper artery, a complete occlusion of the hepatic artery at the same level after attempted crossing with a guide wire.
A repeat biopsy indicated chronic inflammatory change.
A repeat ultrasound showed normal blood flow to the liver, so it was decided to take the patient to the operating room for a right hemicolectomy for management of her cecal cancer.
Her antibiotic regimen at that point was vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for her history of Enterobacter cultured from her initial biopsy upon admission.
A repeat computerized axial tomography of the abdomen postoperatively showed a new area of irregular hypodensity within the liver.
The pathology of the colon cancer indicated a mucinous and signet-ring cell carcinoma, high-grade, poorly differentiated to under differentiated with invasion to the muscularis propria and to the subserosa, and [**5-26**] positive lymph nodes.
Given her new diagnosis of end-stage III-C T3 N2 M0 by TNM staging, Oncology recommended adjuvant chemotherapy of the cecal carcinoma with a chemotherapy combination of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin.
Status post exploratory laparotomy with hepatic artery anastomotic repair.
