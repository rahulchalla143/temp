Post-Resection MRI of Head: FINDINGS: There is a new left suboccipital craniectomy.
There are small bilateral subdural collections along the convexities, falx, and the tentorium, as seen on the preceding CT scan.
Head CT [**3-4**]: FINDINGS: There is little change, s/p left suboccipital craniectomy, with minimal to no decrease in blood products within the surgical bed.
Post-operatively she was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and managment of her external ventricular drain.
Her post-operative examination was essentially intact with the exception of right lateral gaze nystagmus.
Post-resection MRI was performed on [**3-2**].
On [**3-2**], postoperative labs revealed a low platelet count of 83.
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia studies were sent(returning negative result), and platelets were transfused.
