Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis - complicated by small left apical pneumothorax.
History of Present Illness: 76 F with HTN, severe AS, Afib, hypothyroidism, right-sided pleural effusion and bilateral adnexal cystic structures found on CT ([**4-/2198**]) who is transfered back to the floor from MICU after thoracentesis.
In regards to her abdominal pain, the patient stated that it was different from abdominal bloating in past.
[**Doctor Last Name **] waves on her ekg, acidemic with PH of 7.1 and a lactate exceeding measurable limit; Given her abd pain, acidemia, and lactic acidosis, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible mesenteric ischemia.
Labs notable for pH 7.31, lactate 3.2, WBC 16.4 w/ 89.9% N, INR 16.5, PTT 115, ALT 607, AST 1187, AP 144, Na 127, Cr 2.2 (unknown baseline), CE negative.
Urine, blood, and stool for c diff were negative.
CXR demonstrated b/l effusions, bibasilar opacities.
Past Medical History: -AFib -severe aortic stenosis (ao valve area 1.0) -HTN -GERD -rising CA-125 and persistent bilateral adnexal cystic structures - seen by OB/GYN recently -> CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which was performed at [**Location (un) 5164**] on [**2198-5-16**].
Per GYN note, recommended further eval of R sided pleural effusion w/ thoracentesis -> per pt, had fluid aspirated and was fine -Fallopian tube polyp -thyroid nodules -tonsillectomy -D+C -cholesterol embolus to her eye -peripheral neuropathy -degenerative joint disease -bilateral pleural effusions over the past 3-4 months, apparently s/p thoracentesis at OSH, reportedly negative for malignancy.
NECK: No thyroid nodules, JVP 10cm, no bruits.
