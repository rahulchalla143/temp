He had had a hospital course that was complicated by Staph abscesses requiring drainage and MRSA, positive blood culture, as well as small bilateral pleural effusion felt to represent foci infected with MRSA.
Vancomycin 1 gram IV q.d., dose only for a trough level less than 20.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following: Temperature on admission was 98.7, pulse 72, blood pressure 110/70, pulsus paradoxus 16.
JVD was to the ankles.
LUNGS:   Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values on admission revealed the following:  White count of 36.6, hematocrit 29.0, MCV 92.
Differential on the white count was 67 neutrophils, 14 bands, 2 lymphs, 8 monos, 3 atypical cells, 4 metamyelocytes, and myelocytes.
Coagulations studies revealed the following: 13.9, 25.5, and 1.3 with a platelet count of 63.
SMA 7: 132, 3.8, 121, 17, 1.8, glucose of 121, albumin 2.6, globulin 8.9, calcium 8.9, phosphatase 3.3, magnesium 1.4, troponin less than .3, CK 29, ALT 167, AST 89, LDH 251, alkaline phosphatase 649, total bilirubin 0.4 and 0.2 direct, GTT 614.
Urinalysis showed a large amount of blood, pH 6, leukocyte Estrace positive, no nitrites, 49 reds, 3 whites, no bacteria, less than 1 squamous epithelial cell.
Urine sodium was 43, urine creatinine 95.
Blood culture pending.
EKG:  Sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute, normal axis, diffuse flattening of the T waves especially in the lateral leads, Q wave in lead three and lateral ST flattening, now new compared to old EKG of [**2180-6-5**].
Chest CT, without contrast, showed a new large pericardial effusion.
Lung demonstrated bilateral parenchymal marginal opacities without cavitation, no changed compared with the prior examination and concerning foci for infection.
CT of the abdomen showed no focal masses within the liver and no intrahepatic biliary ductal dictation.
Spleen, pancreas, jejunum, and kidneys were unchanged and unremarkable.
CT of the pelvis was unremarkable.
Hematocrit was 6%, LDH 400, albumin 2.4, with improvement in the patient's blood pressure and symptoms in terms of pain and the blood pressure which had gone down to about systolic of 100 to 110.
Pericardial fluid cytology was negative and cultures showed no growth.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit following the pericardial centesis to permit additional drainage from the pericardium with additional 450 cc.
The drain was discontinued on [**6-16**] after the drainage rate was down to 3 cc per hour.
In addition, the patient was found as mentioned on CT to have an increased fluid collection in the right psoas muscle with accompanying leukemoid reaction with increased white cells.
As the patient remained in the hospital, the white cell count increased from that noted on admission to, what would be found by the day of discharge, at 120 white cells; 50 cc of fluid was removed by interventional radiology.
A pericardial window was not determined to be necessary at the time.
The patient had transient hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s overnight, remaining symptomatic, responding to a 500 cc fluid bolus times one.
Aspirate was attempted, however, no cells could be removed so that an iliac bone marrow biopsy and aspirate was done and evaluated under the microscope by Drs.
Home hospice also included Lorazepam 0.5 to 2 mg q.4h.p.r.n.
