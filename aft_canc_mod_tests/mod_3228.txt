His course was complicated by a bout of hepatitis in [**2118-4-19**] which was felt to be chemical in etiology and led to weight loss, sprue exacerbation and relapse.
His liver biopsy performed on [**2118-4-28**] revealed numerous apoptotic hepatocytes, multiple small foci of sinusoidal mononuclear inflammation and enlarged Kupffer cells consistent with acute hepatitis.
Further investigation led to biopsy of small bowel and the diagnosis of T cell lymphoma was made.
Transaminitis:  From [**Date range (1) 45746**] (peak AST 198, ALT 247, alk phos 1062, negative HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV, CMV, toxo, VZV, HSV1, HSV2).
Liver bx revealed non-specific inflammation consistent with acute hepatitis.
Physical Exam: On admission: Temperature 97.9, HR 80, RR 20, BP 86-98/50-64.
1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally, 2+ peripheral pulses otherwise.
Reflexes 2+ throughout.
Pertinent Results: Pertinent laboratory results on admssion include WBC-9.3 (differential NEUTS-87, BANDS-0, LYMPHS-6*, MONOS-6, EOS-0, BASOS-0, ATYPS-0, METAS-0, MYELOS-1*), HGB-11.1, HCT-33.7, PLT COUNT-521.
Chemistry reveals GLUCOSE-104 UREA N-14 CREAT-0.4* SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-4.6 CHLORIDE-107 TOTAL CO2-23.
Urinalysis negative  [**2118-5-31**] CMV IgG and IgM negative   Brief Hospital Course: His hospital course will be reviewed by problems:  1) Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma: He received Ara-C and Etoposide (day -6 to -3) and melphalan (day -2) as part of the BEAM protocol, followed by a rest day.

Ambisome was added on [**7-10**] secondary to a finding of pulmonary nodules on CT scan, however pulmonary did not feel these were significant, and ambisome was d/c'ed on [**7-16**] since the patient was not neutopenic.
His temperature reached a peak to 104.6 on [**2118-7-10**].
CT chest on [**2118-7-10**] revealed multiple small non-specific nodules, felt by pulmonary to be non-significant.
CT abdomen and pelvis negative on [**2118-7-10**].
All cultures negative thus far except for a single bottle positive for Corynebacterium on [**2118-6-30**] felt to be a contaminant.
An MRI of the liver done on [**2118-7-13**] was negative for hepatic candidiasis.
Stool cultures were negative.
3) GI: On [**2118-7-8**], Mr. [**Known lastname 45745**] had a Hct drop from 27 to 21 with frankly guaiac positive stools.

An EGD was performed on [**2118-7-12**], which revealed ulceration in D3 consistent with an area of ulcerative duodenitis without active bleeding.
His Hct has remained stable since transfer, without further melena.
Followup Instructions: Return to the unit tomorrow [**7-21**] for repeat blood work and to be seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**].
