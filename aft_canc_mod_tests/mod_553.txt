Past Medical History: - RIGHT MEDIAL THIGH WOUND: Developed after developing severe cellulitis in late [**2153**] and underwent a biopsy of the area [**2153-11-22**].
Measurement of wound was 8 x 0.5cm.
- ANEMIA, iron deficiency - Paroxysmal ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, not on AC due to multiple RP bleeds - CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, Diastolic, ef >70%.

[**2154-10-8**] CXR (portable) IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**10-7**]: There is greater consolidation at the right lung base today, which could be atelectasis worsening in the setting of persistent moderate right pleural effusion or worsening pneumonia.
[**2154-10-10**] CT Abd/Pelvis (with contrast) IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2154-10-15**] CT Abd/Pelvis (non-contrast) IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2154-10-15**] CT Abd/Pelvis (non-contrast) IMPRESSION: 1.
Stable intra-abdominal and pelvic hemoperitoneum, overall unchanged since CT from 9 hours prior.
[**2154-10-17**] CT Chest (non-contrast) IMPRESSION: 1.
Status of the effusion can be monitored with serial radiographs if clinically relevant.
These findings should be reassessed in [**3-19**] weeks (or per continuing surveillance plans for intraabdominal malignancy) with a contrast CT study.
[**2154-10-20**] CT AP  IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo w/GIST, diastolic CHF, Afib presents with dyspnea on exertion and chest pain, found to have dropping Hgb likely source was hemoperitoneum and hemothorax .
CT abd/pelvis to look for recurrent RP bleed, was delayed due to [**Last Name (un) **] as the study required contrast.
On hosptial day 3 pt had CT scan which showed hemoperitoneum without any active bleeding.
Repeat non-contrast CT's showed relatively stable hemoperitoneum, but did suggest expanding pleural effusion, suggesting potential blood loss into the thorax.
Her case was discussed with IR and they could not see a localized source of bleeding on the CT scans and suggested a tagged RBC scan to further eval for bleeding.
CT scan however, showed significantly larger right-sided pleural effusion.
The effusion was consistent with exudative effusion and hemothorax, as it had a Hct of 39.
Urine lytes c/w pre-renal etiology, Foley catheter placement and abdominal imaging ruled out post-renal obstruction.
CT abdomen was obtained which showed mild interval increase of bleeding in the peritoneum cavity and diffuse omental and peritoneal metastases.
Her hematocrit came down to 23 and she was transfused 1 unit of pRBC on [**10-20**] with appropriate bump in hematocrit to 26.1 post-transfusion.
Her urine output decreased and was bolused with 500cc but without much response.
Her urine output continues to be 10-20 cc/hr.
Her symptoms were agressviely managed and support was offered to the family.
Information was obtained from PatientwebOMR.
