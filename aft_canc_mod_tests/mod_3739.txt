Awoke at nursing home at 3am with chest pressure ([**4-22**] and left sided).
Cardiac enzymes showed CK 339, MB 12.2, MBI 3.5, Trop I 30 and EKG revealed STE V2-5 with Q waves.
In the ED, vitals showed T 97.7, BP 80/61, HR 75, RR 21, 91% on six liters NC.
Physical Exam: vitals - T 96.6, BP 88/62, HR 67, 02 sat 92% on 6 liters.

EKG #1 ([**2179-4-9**] at 20:50) showed afib with rate of 70; left axis; biphasic TW in V2-V4; ST-elevations in V2-V5 with Q-waves in V2-V4.
EF 35-40% No definite apical thrombus seen.
Chest CT [**2179-4-14**]: 1.
Comparison to outside studies would be helpful as well as dedicated contrast- enhanced study if the patient's renal function permits.
[**2179-4-16**] pleural fluid cytology: Pleural fluid: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**2179-4-20**] pleural fluid: Pleural fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
STEMI/Coronary artery disease: Presented with chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes which were consistent with an ST-elevation MI.
A head CT was obtained to evaluate for brain mets and after this returned negative, a heparin gtt was started.
An echo was obtained on HD2 which showed an EF of 35-40% and regional LV wall motion abnormalities which included: mid anteroseptal - akinetic; anterior apex - akinetic; septal apex- akinetic; inferior apex - akinetic; lateral apex - akinetic; apex - dyskinetic.
Acute renal failure: Baseline SCr of ~1.2 and a presenting Scr of 1.4.
His Cr trended back to baseline and remained stable.
Oncology felt that the patient was too frail and deconditioned to undergo chemo/xrt and the plan was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3551**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8631**] at [**Hospital1 **] as outpatient to discuss possible palliative chemo vs. hospice.
While at [**Hospital1 18**] a repeat non-contrast chest CT was performed that showed b/l pleural effusions and a likely R endobronchial tumor with post- obstructive collapse of the right middle and lower lobes in addition to hilar and mediastinal LAD.
Records from OSH remarked that the patient had uptake in his pelvis so a pelvic xray was obtained to look for possible mets.
During his hospital stay the patient had a significant oxygen requirement with O2 sats 88-96% on 6L NC and 15L high flow oxygen.
Chest xrays and CT demonstrated a large R pleural effusion with RML and RLL collapse.
The patient required 6 liters of oxygen to keep sats above 90 (which was stable from pre-admission).
