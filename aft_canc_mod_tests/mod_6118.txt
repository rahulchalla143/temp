A preoperative colonoscopy demonstrated an ulcerated mass in the mid transverse [**Month/Year (2) 499**].
Her preoperative liver function tests were significant only for mild elevation of her transaminases.
Her CEA was 4.5.
A preoperative CT scan of the torso demonstrated no evidence of metastasis.

[**3-5**] Torso CT scan: no PE, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, s/p transverse colectomy, with apparently intact anastomotic site and no large fluid collection around anastomotic site, increasing pneumoperitoneum, no evidence of obstruction or breakdown at the anastomotic site.
[**3-15**] CT Abd/Pelvis: Rectal contrast was fills long Hartmann pouch, suboptimally filling the apical region.
[**3-19**] CT Thorax: Moderate size simple bliateral effusions with associated compressive atelectasis, slightly decreased from prior.
[**3-21**] CT Abd: Contrast filling the Hartmann's pouch, without definite evidence of extraluminal contrast, however, persistent air and stranding, unchanged from prior study is still noted.
On POD#1 noted to have hct drop from 25 to 20, requiring 4uPRBCs on POD#1 to POD#2.
Patient had increasing O2 requirement, cxr showed edema, no diuresis was done.
On POD#3 (day of transfer to ICU), respiratory distress worsened with increasing O2 requirements to nc and face mask to keep sats >95%.
A CT of torso performed, (-) for PE, (+) pneumoperitoneum without limitated extravasation of contrast, thought likely small performation that had sealed off.
Vital signs prior to transfer: t99 (was 101.1 1hr prior to transfer), 105, 120s/70, rr24, 98% 8L, access 2pIVs.
Hypoxemic respiratory failure- started POD#2, with hypoxia on NC.
Pt shows moderate pleural effusions that were not present on the CT scan on [**2-22**].
TRALI syndrome also a possiblity, which has been known to occur upto 6 hours after blood transfusion.
- O2 on NC/facemask - check serial ABGs - BNP and Echo .
?s BP dropped to 80/60.
- vanco/zosyn - serial lactates - serial abd exams .

Line sent for culture - Surgery opened surgical site and drained some purulent material.
?s ABG prior to this (in am) was 7.46 / 43/ 96 / 32, and the new abg at 5pm was similar 7.45 / 37 / 81 / 27 ??????
?s Fi02 was increased from 40 to 70% and started back on AC Vt 450, fio2 70, peep 8, RR 32.
- new CXR showed no new infiltrates and was unchanged.
- LENI was negative - blood cx sent, more tylenol given - Pt was to get 25g albumin, but surgery decided to give 2 u PRBC instead, hct stable at 25 at the time.
agreed to adding Flagyl 500 IV q8, and surgery contd to want to r/o PE - bladder pressure 19 - stable - Pt became hypotensive to sbp 70s, map 40s, and gave 1L bolus, w/ 1unit PRBC being transfused during that time.
?s map stabalized > 65 lactate came down to 3.8, pt went to CT -> CTA neg prelim read.
- Pt stayed stable until 4am, fever of 103.5, new blood cx sent.

Surgery wanted pt on Precedex - later that day around 1pm surgery decided to extubate pt.
Pt's tolerated extuabtion for 45min, then pt's 02 sat began to drop -> 90%, cpap and neb did not help -> reintubated and put on AC.
