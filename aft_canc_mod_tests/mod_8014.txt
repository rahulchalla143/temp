IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pulmonary consolidation, appearing more confluent compared to last film, however, similar to appearance to [**8-22**] film acquired at 05:28 hours, which is likely secondary to a combination of multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
COMPARISON: CT scan from [**2169-8-7**].
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis with coronal and sagittal reformatted images.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are bilateral consolidative opacities at the lung bases.
There is limited evaluation of bowel without oral or IV contrast, however, there is no evidence of bowel dilatation.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: Post-surgical changes are seen within the pelvis, including clips and bladder resection.

CXR DOES NOT SHOW WORSENED PULMONARY     Final Report  RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:    5.0 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m MAA;    40.0 mCi Tc-99m DTPA Aerosol; HISTORY: 75 year old man post cystectomy with persistent hypoxia and tachypnea.
INTERPRETATION:  Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate  considerable central airway deposition of tracer and several areas of reduced tracer deposition within the parenchyma of both lungs.
Perfusion images in the same 8 views show relatively preserved perfusion throughout the parenchyma of both lungs (compared to the ventilation images).
Given the chest radiograph appearance, the above findings are consistent with an intermediate probability of pulmonary embolism.
Central deposition of tracer on the ventilation study is suggestive of an airway turbulence.
Given the chest X-ray findings, pulmonary embolism cannot be ruled out; however, there are no findings which a particularly suggestive of that diagnosis.

He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-14**], [**2169**] for his procedure.
In the operating room, the total estimated blood loss was 3500cc.
His INR at this point was 1.2.
His chest film on [**8-15**] read as: "Heart is mildly enlarged.
On [**8-16**], a chest film was read as: "There is a left lower lobe retrocardiac atelectasis with large consolidation.
He had a sputum culture which was also negative.
His [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drainage continued to be high, and hence, a JP creatinine level and a Urine creatinine level was sought in order to rule-out a urine leak within the abdomen.
The levels were repeated 3 times in the next 6 days, and on all three occassions, it was determined that a urine leak was not present.
A chst film was read as: "An ET tube is seen with the tip in the mid trachea.
He also had a urine culture today, for febrile episodes during the day, which was negative.

He also had episodes of chest pain - a 12-lead EKG was done which did not show any abnormalities.
He also spiked a temperature of 101.5, and was pancultured.
He had a video surveillance study to assess his risk for gastric aspiration, and it was determined he would require a thickened diet due to some risk of aspiration.
After starting administration, he had an allergic reaction to the product and his blood pressure elevated and his temperature went up to 103.
