Pt was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED from [**Hospital 15332**], where, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the pt was found to be bradycardic to 40's, and unobtainable BP on the day of admission.
In the ED, initial vs were: P 100 BP 60's systolic, 100% NRB.
CXR showed evidence of left effusion, infectious versus malignant.

She was fluid hydrated to CVP 8-12 and started on norepinephrine to MAP >65.
Blood cultures were no growth to date at time of call out of ICU.
She had a recent chest fiml that showed left consolidation with effusion so she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
However, she also had a recent PET scan with mediastinal LN involvement malignancy was also considered.
She underwent a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis that demonstrated exudative physiology.
Initial results were not consistent with infection with culture and cytology was negative for malignant cells.
Repeat thoracentesis showed a similarly exudative physiology.
# Anion-gap acidosis: Pt initially had an anion gap of 21, with a delta-delta of [**10-11**] which suggests a metabolic alkalosis as well.
The acidosis and her anion gap closed with normalization of her lactate with fluid resuscitation.
# Hypertension: Her anti-hypertensives were held in the setting of hypotension.
