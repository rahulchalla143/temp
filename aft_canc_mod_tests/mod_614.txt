Imaging revealed a left parietal bleed and suggested an underlying mass, likely high-grade glioma.
CT torso did not reveal other neoplasms.
EEG was normal but the patient was started on keppra for seizure prophylaxis given his risk for seizures with the bleed and mass.
Functional MRI was done for [**Numeric Identifier **]-operative planning given concern that the lesion could be near the language area, but suggested it was infact more near the region of the right foot and possibly the tongue.
His physical exam during hopsital course was assesed frequently and it did show gradual but definitive improvement.
At DC, the neuro exam was notable for conduction aphasia but no other motor sensory deficits.
