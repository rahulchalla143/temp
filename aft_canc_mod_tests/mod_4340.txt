Upper endoscopy showed patent stent as above.
The patient will return in [**4-18**] weeks for repeat bronchoscopy to assess stent position.
Iron studies were not able to be performed prior to blood transfusion.
The patient was transfused one unit packed red blood cells prior to transfer from the OSH and was transfused one unit during this hospitalization two days prior to discharge.
The patient's hematocrit bumped appropriately and remained stable.
