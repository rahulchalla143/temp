On day number 14, status post transplant, the patient became increasingly tachypneic and hypoxemic and a chest x-ray revealed pulmonary edema.
A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed which revealed clear, slightly pink fluid.
The patient received two echocardiograms which were negative for evidence of heart failure.
His cell counts of all three lineages continued to increase to levels of white count 6.4, hematocrit 30.4, and platelet count 90,000 on the day prior to discharge.
On day number 13 status post transplant, the cefepime and metronidazole were discontinued as the patient's blood cultures and nasopharyngeal swabs did not demonstrate any evidence of infection.
On day number 14, aztreonam was initiated as the patient had a chest x-ray demonstrating interstitial infiltrates.
BAL washings were negative for bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
The patient had further negative blood and urine cultures and had a Clostridium difficile toxin which returned negative.
RENAL:  As of day number 11, the patient had sustained an increase in his creatinine to 1.6.
The differential diagnosis in this rise was felt to include third spacing of fluids causing intravascular volume depletion (the patient had a FEna of less than 1%), as well as an adverse reaction to liposomal amphotericin B.
The patient's creatinine reached a maximal value of 1.8, and then proceeded to correct after the patient began diuresing.
