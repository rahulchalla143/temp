She then re-presented with pain in her sternum and a bone scan at that time showed spread to the sternal bones.
Currently she is believed to have mets involving subcutaneous tissue, thyroid, lymph nodes, skin, pleura, bone, liver, and possibly the central nervous system.

She then represented with pain in her sternum and a bone scan at that time showed spread to the sternal bones.
Per her recent scans, CT of her head has been negative as recently as [**2104-6-30**].
CT of chest and abdomen show pleural thickening on the left, stable left pleural effusion, bilateral lung nodules, as well as several liver lesions and involvement of many vertebral bones and the right SI joint with metastatic foci.
She had a bone scan on [**2104-6-9**] that showed uptake in her sternum, bilateral ribs, C-spine and iliac bone.
CT scan [**4-23**]: CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  The appearance of the chest is not significantly different from [**2104-6-10**].
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Innumerable liver metastases are not significantly different [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**2104-6-10**].
The pancreas, spleen, adrenals, kidneys are unchanged, with multiple likely simple cysts in both kidneys.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid, and remainder of the colon is mostly collapsed, but normal-appearing.

CHEST (PA & LAT)	Study Date of [**2107-12-3**]: IMPRESSION: Relatively stable x-ray again demonstrating left pleural effusion with left base opacity, likely atelectasis.
An underlying consolidation from pneumonia is difficult to entirely exclude but is less likely.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2107-12-3**]: IMPRESSION: Single focus of hypoattenuation in the left superior frontal cortex of the superior frontal lobe as described above corresponds to the metastatic lesion noted on the MR [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**2105-4-24**].
Direction comparison size is not possible due to technique related differences.
RENAL U.S.	Study Date of [**2107-12-3**]: IMPRESSION: Limited study due to suboptimal visualization of the renal parenchyma most significantly affecting the right side.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2107-12-5**]: IMPRESSION: Limited study due to lack of intravenous contrast, which was not administered due to patient's renal failure.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2107-12-6**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-3**], there is little overall change.

Fe Urea was 20.8% and FeNa was 0.5% with urine Na of 14.
Head CT showed no concerning changes.
However, MRI showed interval development of multiple cerebral and cerebellar masses highly suspicious for worsening metastatic disease.
