His oxygenation on room air was normal and his breathing was comfortable.
Repeat CT scan showed no evidence of pneumonia.

It is possible that the elevation in liver function tests was due to fluconazole, therefore, the patient's dose was decreased to 200 q.d.
His total bilirubin on discharge from this hospital was 1.3.
(the patient's dose was decreased due to elevated cyclosporin levels drawn the day of discharge).
