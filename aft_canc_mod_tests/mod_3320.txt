Stools last week guaiac negative and remained so in the ER.
In the ED he had a benign abdominal exam, was seen by surgery who ordered CT abd/pelvis which confirmed LAD, cannot r/o infection in necrotic tissue as compared to PET scan done yesterday, radiology was less concerned for infection, of note this did show a RLL pneumonia.

Past Medical History: NSCLC metastatic to subclavian lymph nodes in [**Month (only) **] 2008chemo/XRT  Atrial fibrillation PVD  ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Had a right hilar mass on preoperative chest x-ray performed in anticipation of peripheral bypass surgery.
He was then referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in pulmonology and underwent PET/CT on [**2194-1-7**] which showed a 5.5 cm x 3.7 cm right infrahilar mass with spiculated borders as well as adenopathy in the mediastinal and subclavicular right lymph nodes.
Brain MRI on [**2194-1-16**] was negative for metastases.
Strength 5/5 in upper and lower extremities.
Pertinent Results: Imaging: CT abd/pelvis showed worsenin right basilat process c/w post obs pneumonia.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.

Final Report INDICATION: 68-year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, atrial fibrillation and PVD, now with progressive abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained and reviewed.
Right adrenal myelolipoma, and left adrenal gland are unchanged.
Multiple enlarged gastrohepatic, periaortic, retroperitoneal, and right iliac chain lymph nodes are unchanged from previous study.
CT PELVIS: Pelvic loops of large and small bowel, and genitourinary structures are unchanged.
The dosages of his outpatient beta-blocker were increased significantly to keep his heart rate under 120.
Once the patient's heart rate was stable he was transferred to the oncology service, where he was kept on telemetry and remained stable.
Abdominal pain: His abdominal pain and distension was felt to be due necrotic lymph nodes seen on CT scan, consistent with rapid progression of his malignancy.
RLL pneumonia: Seen incidentally on CT scan, postobstrucitive given the location in relation to the tumor.
Sputum cultures remained negative.
This was felt likely secondary to his lack of sleep while in the hospital, however causes such as pain medications and possible worsening of malignancy with metastatis were considered.
Infectious work-up was negative, and the patient had been on levofloxacin and completed a full course for pneumonia.
An MRI of the brain was ordered for the day after discharge, as the patient refused to have one done while in the hospital, to rule out malignant metastasis.
