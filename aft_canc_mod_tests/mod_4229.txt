GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 3 iv injections of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline, at rest, with cough and post-Valsalva maneuver.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= XX %).
Pt was at the hospital about a month ago with similar symptoms (diarrhea, afib w/ RVR, and UTI), but C. difficile studies were negative at that time.

Pt also with longstanding hx of afib and is supratherapeutic on coumadin with INR 6.7.
On these medications, her heart rate was well controlled, in the 80s-90s with stable blood pressures.
For her supratherapeutic INR, 4 mg of Vitamin K was used initially, which brought her INR down to 2.6.
Her next INR was slightly subtherapeutic, and on [**5-14**] she recieved a dose of her home level of coumadin.
She had a renal ultrasound that showed no hydronephrosis.
While in the ICU, her creatinine improved from 1.4 on admission to 1.1.
