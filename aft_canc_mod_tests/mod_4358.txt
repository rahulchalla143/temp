The donor would be able to collect stem cells, but we could not guarantee a backup bone marrow should her stem cell collections not be adequate, so the decision was made to cryo-preserve the stem cells and Mrs.[**Known lastname 87521**] admission was delayed until today.

A viral exanthem cannot be excluded, however, the follicular dyskeratosis would be unusual.
The concurrent cytospin slides are negative for involvement by an acute leukemia.
Red blood cell extravasation and pigment incontinence are noted.
IMAGING: [**2128-1-16**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis w/o con: 1.
[**2128-1-29**] CT Head w/o con: 1.
[**2128-1-30**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis w/o con: 1.
Limited study without IV or oral contrast.
[**2128-2-11**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis w/ con: 1.
No evidence of infection on this CT scan.
[**2128-2-17**] CT Head w/o con: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
[**2128-2-18**] MRI Head w/o con: Multiple scattered foci of FLAIR hyperintensity involving predominantly cortical [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter of the bilateral hemispheres, some of which demonstrate slow diffusion without significant mass effect or hemorrhage.
These may represent changes related to encephalitis, encephalopathy, inflammatory/infectious etiology, subacute infarcts, less likely neoplastic involvement or related to medications used.
Evaluation of these findings is somewhat limited without intravenous contrast.
Gram negative rods grew from her blood on that same day.
She was given a total of 17 liters of fluid overnight as well as 4 units of PRBCs and maximum BP support with 4 pressors maxed out (neo, levo, vasopressin, and epinephrine) and despite these measures her pressures remained in the 60s-80s systolic.
She reached a peak absolute blast count of XXXXX.
A bone marrow biopsy on [**4-1**] was consistent with relapsed leukemia (chimerism showed increase to 45% recipient, 55% donor) so the tacrolimus was tapered and then stopped.
Her blast count continued to rise.
# HHV-6 viral encephalitis: Patient was noted to have altered mental status, and HHV-6 PCR returned at >1,000,000 on [**2-16**] with CSF also positive for HHV-6.
However, peripheral blood from [**3-8**] revealed 15,230 copies of HHV-6 DNA.
Infectious disease was consulted and her antibiotics were changed multiple times and included aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole IV, vancomycin IV and PO, and micafungin.
However, a repeat skin biopsy on [**3-16**] was again suggestive of GVHD vs. a drug reaction.
She later developed vesicles on her palms and soles and a biopsy on [**3-22**] was suggestive of GVHD with a superimposed viral infection, likely [**Location (un) **] virus.
Her skin worsened again, so tacrolimus and prednisone were weaned out of concern for worsening viral infection, perhaps [**3-10**] [**Location (un) **] or HHV-6.
CT spine was unremarkable.
An ADAMTS-13 evaluation was sent, which was normal.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Believed to be multifactorial, including the Foscarnet, Zosyn, Vancomycin, TTP-HUS, and BK virus detected in the urine.
Nifedipine was added and the cyclosporine was discontinued, and her BP was well controlled.
Eventually her nifedipine was able to be stopped and blood pressure was well controlled prior to discharge.
# Diarrhea: Patient had ongoing diarrhea throughout this admission, though repeated stool cultures including C.diff were all negative.
