He was transferred from [**Hospital3 29818**] for possible ERCP after having an elevated TBili and RUQ ultrasound showing borderline intrahepatic biliary dilation and borderline CBD dilation 6 cm.
The pain was constant, worsened with palpation or head movement, and not exertional.
On exam in the ED, it was localized to the SCM muscles and thought to be muscle spasm.
His neck pain improved, and he was about to be discharged, but he became hypotensive with SBP down to 66/34.
He was found to be guaiac positive and his Hct was down about 6 points from his prior admission.
Labs showed creatinine 1.5, Hct 27.3, and D-dimer 906.
He had a V/Q scan on [**2129-7-27**] which was negative.
He was transfused a total of 3 units PRBCs with his Hct remaining at 34-35 afterwards.
His blood pressure was labile and would drop to the 80s-90s systolic at night.
Labs on [**2129-7-29**] showed ALT 51, AST 33, ALK 75, TBili 4.4, DBili 3.4, and INR 1.7 not on coumadin.
Subsequent abdominal US on [**7-29**] showed borderline intrahepatic biliary dilation and CBD dilation 6.5 mm.
Abdominal CT on [**2129-7-30**] showed stranding and inflammatory changes adjacent to the pancreatic head.
MRCP was not possible due to his ICD.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and possible ERCP.
Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: Vitals: T 97.7, BP 122/83, HR 102, RR 19, SpO2 100% on RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, pleasant HEENT: Sclera anicteric, no conjunctival injection, EOMI, PERRL, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, full ROM, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Regular tachycardia, soft S1 and S2.
DP pulses 1+ bilaterally.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2129-8-5**] IMPRESSION:  1.
Indistinct lobulated appearance of the pancreatic head may represent focal pancreatitis (correlate with labs), differential diagnosis includes cystic neoplasm such as IPMN ; correlation with prior imaging is recommended and MR may be considered if further work-up is indicated.
However, comparison with prior studies would be helpful to deternime stability.
Liver biopsy pathology: 1.
[**Country 7018**] red stain for amyloid is negative.
CT abdomen showed inflammatory changes adjacent to the pancreatic head as well as abnormal wall-thickening of the ascending and proximal transverse colon which may reflect colitis.
CT scan showed "Indistinct lobulated appearance of the pancreatic head may represent focal pancreatitis (correlate with labs), differential diagnosis includes cystic neoplasm such as IPMN ; correlation with prior imaging is recommended and MR may be considered if further work-up is indicated."
ERCP at [**Hospital1 18**] showed a biliary stricture in the lower third of the CBD concerning for malignancy.
After stent placement, his bilirubin (total and direct) continued to rise.
Repeat ERCP/EUS on [**8-3**] showed a patent stent and no evidence of pancreatic mass or chronic pancreatitis.
MTX was held given his acute liver dysfunction; this may be restarted PRN as an outpatient.
A CT abdomen was performed, which did not show any evidence of recurrence of his lymphoma, and did not reveal an etiology of his liver dysfunction.
Repeat ERCP is scheduled for later this month for stent removal.
The liver service was consulted and patient underwent transjugular liver biopsy on [**8-10**].
The results of the biopsy were discussed with the ERCP team as well as the liver service.
# GI Bleeding: His Hct was reportedly 27.3 on presentation to OSH with guaiac positive stool.
Because of his NSTEMI /demand ischemia with Troponin leak, he was transfused PRBCs for a goal Hct >30 and remained stable during the remainder of his stay at the outside hospital.
His Hct on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] was 34.7 without evidence of frank bleeding.
He will need repeat outpatient EGD at some point to re-assess esophagitis.
He will also need an outpatient colonoscopy to evaluate his anemia with guaic positive stool.
His hematocrit again drifted down to 25 and he received 1 unit of packed red blood cells during his stay at [**Hospital1 18**].
His hematocrit remained stable after this transfusion.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn and stool was sent to C. Diff.
The cause of his coagulopathy is unclear, but the lack of response to Vitamin K suggests a synthetic defect in the liver or an acquired condition such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or factor inhibitor.
Ultimately, his INR did normalize and was normal at the time of discharge.
Subsequent ABG showed partial compensation.
His serum bicarb gradually improved and stabilized and was within normal limits at the time of discharge.
Patient was monitored on telemetry and his troponin was trended and found to decrease.
His BP continued to be labile, however, with BP dropping to the 80s-90s at night.
His BP continued to be labile, dropping to the 60s systolic while sleeping, but increasing back to the 110s when awakened.
BPs were closely monitored through the day, and he maintain SBPs 110s, with MAPs ranging from 70-90.
His AM cortisol level was normal and TTE showed an EF of 50-55% (though has diastolic dysfunction).
Ultimately, his blood pressure stabilized, however, and he tolerated continued beta blockade as well as diuretics (see below).
# Atrial Fibrillation:  He was in sinus rhythm on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] with rate ~100 bpm.
This was likely multifactorial--he appeared to have low oncotic pressure (albumin low of 2.2) and received large amounts of IV fluids due to his low blood pressure, he also has a history of right sided heart failure.
As his blood pressure gradually stabilized, he was carefully started on low dose Lasix with good diuresis.
Renal function should also be closely monitored with his diuresis.
You also had a rapid heart rate with atrial fibrillation, this was likely due to being ill.
They went back a looked a second time to make sure this remained open since your bilirubin was going up and it remained open.
At the outside hospital you had a decrease in your red blood cell count and were found to have microscopic blood in the stool.
You should have a colonoscopy and repeat upper endoscopy as an outpatient.
You underwent a liver biopsy, which showed cholestatic injury, likely due to the stricture mentioned above, perhaps with a contribution of a drug injury.
It is VERY IMPORTANT to keep this appointment for stent removal, endoscopic ultrasound, and brushings to check for cancer.
You had a lot of swelling of your legs and left arm and this was likely from all the fluids you received when your blood pressure was low.
