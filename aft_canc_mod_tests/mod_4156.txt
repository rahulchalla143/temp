Transfusion History: Three non-reactive transfusion at [**Hospital1 18**] (unit from [**2182-9-29**] was [**Doctor Last Name **]-negative) One non-reactive plasma transfusion  DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a new  diagnosis of Anti-K antibody.
ECHO  - Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The basal inferolateral wall contracts best and the inferior wall is not well seen (LVEF = 20-25 %).
Compared with the prior study of [**2182-3-28**], regional left ventricular systolic function is more depressed (distal septum/anterior walls and apex c/w interim distal LAD territory ischemia.
Video swallow - IMPRESSION:  Laryngeal penetration and aspiration with thin liquid consistency not responsive to chin tuck maneuver.
Please note that a barium swallow was subsequently attempted, however, the patient was too dyspneic to allow the procedure to be performed  CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
CTA chest - IMPRESSION: 1.
PET- CT may be of benefit to help exclude neoplasm.
Apparent CXR left mid lung pulmonary nodules likely secondary to intervening foci of more normal parenchyma coalescing due to architectural distortion by emphysema.
Non contrast head CT was attempted and pt was unable to lie flat due to respiratory distress and anxiety.
Pt was placed on a non-rebreather and sats were between 73-90%, coarse breath sounds noted throughout lung fields, pt was diaphoretic, somnolent and having trouble clearing secretions.
IN MICU, he was intubated on [**2182-9-27**] and sputum cx subsequently grew MRSA and pseudomonas.
refer to video swallow and the swallow evaluation as above.
His INR normalized after receiving PO and SC Vitamin K 10mg.
# Right sided chest pain:  Has worsening pleuritic right sided chest pain, CT showed fracture with adjacent pleural reaction and adjacent periosteal reaction.
Bone biopsy was done and results as above.
