While in the Emergency Department, the patient's systolic blood pressure dropped to the 80s and this was accompanied by lightheadedness and left sided chest pain.
The patient's blood pressure improved with hydration.
Regarding the patient's chest pain, the patient has an extensive history of coronary artery disease and is followed for this by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (see below for more detail).
An electrocardiogram in the Emergency Department showed ST depressions in V2 through V5, as well as T-wave inversions in leads 1, AVL and V1 through V6.
Electrocardiogram findings also resolved with repeat electrocardiogram taken in the Intensive Care Unit.
C.  Last echocardiogram prior to current admission (performed [**2114-1-29**]):  The study was of relatively poor quality and revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% to 40%.
Dyskinesis of the basal inferior and mid inferior segments was noted, as was hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral and mid inferolateral portions.
Right ventricular size and function was normal.
LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  A CBC revealed a white count of 1.0 with the following differential:  40 segs, 4 bands, 50 lymphocytes, 6 monocytes.
Granulocyte count was 590.
The patient's hemoglobin was 12.5 and his hematocrit was 36.2.
His platelet count was 43.
A chem-7 revealed sodium of 137, potassium of 4.0, chloride of 99, bicarbonate of 22.
BUN of 32 and creatinine of 1.2 with a glucose of 118.
The patient's initial CK was 33 with a troponin of 3.
Subsequent CKs were 82 and then 67.
Subsequent troponins were 2.7 and 6.4.
A urinalysis revealed no red blood cells, no white blood cells, no bacteria and no epithelials.
IMAGING:  An AP and lateral chest x-ray obtained on [**8-20**] revealed heart size stable.
Pulmonary vasculature was within normal limits.
Electrocardiogram in the Emergency Department:  Sinus tachycardia at 100 beats per minute, axis 0, intervals normal with T-wave inversions in leads 1, AVL, V2 through V6.
Compared with prior study from [**2114-6-30**], T-wave inversions and ST depressions are new.
Electrocardiogram in the MICU:  Sinus tachycardia at 100 beats per minute, axis 0, intervals normal.
Resolution as above, no change compared with prior electrocardiogram from [**2114-6-30**].
OTHER LABS AND IMAGING OF NOTE FOR THIS CURRENT ADMISSION: Transthoracic echocardiogram:  As will be discussed below, the patient received a TTE on [**2114-8-24**] for evaluation of his heart function following non Q-wave myocardial infarction as well as for evaluation of possible endocarditis in the setting of fevers and neutropenia.
There was no evidence of endocarditis found; left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated at 55%.
Right ventricular function and wall thickness were normal; 3+ mitral regurgitation was noted.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy:  As will also be noted below, the patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy on or about [**8-24**] for evaluation of possible esophagitis, again in the setting of neutropenia and fevers, as well as a history of odynophagia.
The esophagogastroduodenoscopy was negative for esophagitis.
CT scan of the sinuses, [**2114-8-27**], revealed no evidence of acute sinus disease.
The patient's overall post myocardial infarction cardiac function was assessed with the transthoracic echocardiogram.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Shortly after transfer from the MICU to the medicine floor on [**2114-8-22**], the patient spiked  temperature to 103.4??????
As noted above, the patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram for evaluation of endocarditis; this study was negative for endocarditis.
The patient also underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy for evaluation of possible esophagitis in the setting of neutropenia and odynophagia; this study was likewise negative.
Furthermore, cultures were taken of the patient's blood, urine and stools.
The patient continued to have intermittent fevers with a T-max on [**8-25**] of 102.0??????
; subsequently, his temperature curve dwindled such that his T-max on [**8-27**] was 100.0??????.
Thereafter, the patient remained afebrile for a time until, on [**8-30**], he was noted to have a temperature of 100.9??????.
At this point, as with the remainder of the patient's hospitalization, no clear source for a fever was found, however it was felt on [**8-30**] that his resurgence of temperature was most likely due to possible cellulitis and/or intravenous site infection.
Subsequent blood cultures were negative and the ceftazidime was discontinued.
The patient was transfused several units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization; this was fully consistent with his periodic requirement for red blood cell transfusion related to the above noted condition.
RHEUMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The rheumatology service was consulted for evaluation of the patient's Wegener's granulomatosis.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient's electrolytes remained stable overall throughout his course.
On the day of discharge, his vital signs were stable and he was afebrile with a temperature of 98.1??????.
His intravenous cellulitis revealed some continued palpable cords with decreased erythema and tenderness.
