He was given cefepime and 1L NS with subsequent bp 78/32, hr 60, 96% 2L.
After 2L NS bolus 89/33, hr 59 t98.4.
)and urine cultures obtained.
A CXR revealed a new RUL infiltrate, and he was treated with vancomycin and cefipime, and blood and urine cultures were done.
Past Medical History: CML/ALL dx [**2172**], palliative care, last peripheral flow [**2174-7-12**] showed AML mixed with some CLL, consistent with BM biopsy on [**2174-5-31**].

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2173-11-22**], tricuspid regurgitation is now more prominent and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
CXR [**2174-11-2**]: IMPRESSION: Resolution of left lower lobe consolidation.
CXR [**2174-10-20**] FINDINGS: Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
He soon had a stable blood pressure s/p 4L NS.
He had a RML infiltrate and basal infiltrates consistent with bacterial pneumonia.
Blood cultures were positive once for lactobacillus and sputum gram stain showed 4+ gram negative rods, but no clear pathogen was identified.
A CXR showed interval resolution in the pneumonia on [**2174-11-1**].
He was known to be transfusion dependent and required approximately 6 blood transfusions during admission and was maintained on epogen.
He required approximately 10 units of platelets to keep his platelets above 20-30.
3) Petechial rash/LE edema - The patient had very low platelet counts and was maintained above platalet count of 10.
The edema was thought secondary to low albumin of 2.1 as his echo was normal.
His tranfusion threshold was increased to 20-30 and he was given some lasix to help diurese the extra fluid, which helped somewhat but increased his creatinine slightly so was discontinued at discharge.
4) SIADH - The patient had a sodium level of 129 at admission and a low of 126.
