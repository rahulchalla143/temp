An electrocardiogram showed 3 to [**Street Address(2) 5366**] elevations in inferior leads with a right sided ST elevation in V4.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 132/86.
Heart rate 72.
Respiratory rate 18.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Electrocardiogram ST elevations 3 mm in lead 2, 3.5 mm in lead 3, 3 mm in lead AVF, ST depressions 1.5 mm AVL, right sided leads ST elevation in lead V4, 1 mm and 2 to 3 mm in 2, 3 and AVF.
ST elevation myocardial infarction: The patient was taken directly to catheterization where he was noted to have complex diffuse mid right coronary artery lesion, which was stented.
An echocardiogram was performed that revealed mild left ventricular depression with severe HK in the basal inferior wall, EF of 45 to 55%, right ventricle was moderately dilated with severe global right ventricle HK, depressed RV function, 1+ mitral regurgitation.
It was felt that the patient's RV function would likely return he would therefore need a follow up echocardiogram to assess for that in the future.
MAJOR PROCEDURE:  Cardiac catheterization status post a stent to the right coronary artery.
