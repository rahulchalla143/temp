She also has had diffuse abdominal pain consistent with her prior flares of pain as well as her typical diffuse headache.
Upon arrival to the ED, she was afebrile, BP 240/184, HR 109, RR 16, Sat 99% on room air.
A head CT showed no acute abnormality (including hemorrhage) and an abdominal CT showed some possible mild colitis, though it is unclear if this is due to her recent peritoneal dialysis.

Malignant hypertension - Baseline BPs 180's - 120's - History of hypertensive crisis with seizures - History of two intraparenchymal hemorrhages that were thought due to the posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome, associated with LE paresis in [**2140**] that resolved 4.

CT HEAD [**2141-12-8**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
If further evaluation is required MR can be obtained.
CT Abdomin/Pelvis [**2141-12-8**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**12-11**] IMPRESSION: Small left pleural effusion.
Hypertensive urgency: The patient was initially maintained on a labetalol drip and hydralazine iv prn until oral anti-hypertensives lowered her blood pressure.
Initially her blood pressure over-corrected to SBPs in the 80s (patient was asymptomatic).
On [**12-11**] the patient's SBP dropped to the 80's and due to her pain medications she was extremely lethargic, but arousable.
The patient's pressures responded and additional narcotics were held due to her mental status.
The patient's blood pressures continued to be labile and her clonidine patch was increased to 0.3mg/24hr and her hydralazine was titrated back to 100mg daily.
The patient did require IV hydralazine prn for control of her blood pressures initially, but was stablized back on her home regimen.
An inpatient sleep study was performed overnight on [**12-13**] and the patient was sent home on BiPAP for OSA.
A CT scan was performed that showed bowel wall changes that are likely secondary to recent peritoneal dialysis and unrelated to pain.
The patient also had diarrhea, but stool studies were negative.
She will have her INR checked at HD.
She was guaiac negative and hemolysis labs were negative.
Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) 50,000 unit Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO once a month.
You were initially admitted to the ICU and your blood pressure was controlled.
You had a sleep study in the hospital which showed that you had sleep apnea.
