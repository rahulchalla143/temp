ECG at the OSH was concerning for STEMI, with diffuse ST-segment elevations, most prominant in I, II, aVL, V3-6, and ST-segment depression in aVR.
Bedside echo showed hypokinesis with EF 55% and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
Patient was administered Rocephin and Flagyl at the OSH due to noted WBC count of 20K.
Of note, labs from OSH also found K 4.5, BUN 79, Cr 2.9.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
In the ED, initial vital signs were T 97.6, P 74, BP 120/60, R 16, Sat 95% RA.
ECG was significant for similar ST abnormalities, and patient complained of [**11-17**] chest pain.
Labs were significant for WBC 23K with 90% neutrophils, 3% bands.
Chemistry labs were hemolyzed.
One set of blood cultures were sent.
Labs also showed AST 197, ALT 95, Alk Phos 662, total bilirubin 27.1, albumin 2.2.
Troponin was 0.24.
Patient was taken to catheterization due to concern for STEMI.
RHC was performed and showed mean RA 12 mmHg, RVEDP of 15 mmHg, PCW mean of 20 mmHg; CO 3.2 l/min and CI 2.1 l/min/m2.
ABG performed in the lab showed 7.30/33/174/17 with lactate 5.8.
