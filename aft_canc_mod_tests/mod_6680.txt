She had a cystography in the ED at [**Hospital 47**] hospital which according to her records was normal.
She had a cystoscopy attempt which failed due to patient intolerance.
She then had an MRI done on [**2157-6-7**] showing a 10 x 11.5 x 13cm midline heterogenous mass with fluid components and irregularly shaped peripheral nodules occupying much of the lower third of the pelvis.
She had another cystoscopy today [**2157-6-8**] where multiple trigonal polyps were noted, biopsied and fulgurated.

Imaging: CXR [**6-13**]: PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: Anterior mediastinal wires are intact.
CXR [**6-15**]: CHEST RADIOGRAPH PORTABLE AP VIEW: Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 6.8 cm above the carina and advancing 3 cm is recommended.
Final internal length is 49 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC.
CXR [**6-20**]: PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to [**2157-6-15**] and [**2157-6-13**].
She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**] who agreed that surgical evaluation was necessary for evaluation of the tumor, however, not necessary in an urgent manner given that the patient was otherwise so stable.
The urine culture from the outside hospital was negative so the Bactrim was stopped.
An initial urine culture at [**Hospital1 **] was also negative.
The patient was started on oxybutinin 5mg [**Hospital1 **] for bladder spasms which were intermittent.
The full operative note is available in the medical record, and was notable for finding that the pelvic mass was in fact an enlarged tumor-filled uterus.
The patient had a cystoscopy intraop, demonstrating normal bladder mucosa and bilateral ureteral jets seen; proctoscopy to 25 cm also revealed normal findings.
The culture returned with 3+ GPCs, and this was switched to vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin.
Her Hct post-op drifted down to 23 and she was transfused 2 units PRBCs, with return to 30.
Prior to her call-out to the floor, the vanc and zosyn were stopped and the levofloxacin was continued.
Her Hct was carefully watched, and her heparin was eventually restarted by [**6-19**].
A CXR was overall stable with no evidence of consolidation.
Her BPs began to creep up and she was restarted on the metoprolol and norvasc on [**6-20**].
A UA was negative and a culture was pending on discharge.
8. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): Hold for BP <100/60 or HR <60.
