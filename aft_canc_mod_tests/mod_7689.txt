Her blood pressure has been lower since [**Month (only) 958**] in the 100s-110s systolic at her PCP's office since then (may be lower at home).
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vital signs were 97.2 95 77/45 31 100% 12L on a non-rebreather.
Her tongue was noted to be normal in appearance, but the patient was having problems [**Name (NI) 19788**] and her legs were noted to be swollen and tight.
For systolic blood pressures in the 70s, she was 250 cc NS bolus, with response to 93/46.
She was then started on dobutamine drip, with improvement of blood pressure to 132/86.
After improvement of her blood pressure, she was noted to be [**Name (NI) 19788**] better.
Labs were notable for proBNP [**Numeric Identifier 90258**] pg/mL, troponin 0.15, Hct 24.3 (from baseline 26), Cr 2.5 (from baseline 1.63), albumin 2.9, and UA with moderate leukocytes and few bacteria.
Initial EKG was a poor study with tachycardia, and subsequent EKG showed NSR @ [**Street Address(2) 90259**] elevations or depressions.
Chest x-ray showed mild interstitial edema and a right-sided pleural effusion.
VS on transfer were: 98.4 95 24 108/56 (on dobutamine 6mcg/kg/min) 95% 3L.
Her initial vital signs were 96.8 113/59 131 27 91% 4L.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - systolic/diastolic CHF, EF 25%: started metolazone (Zaroxlyn) with administrations on [**2162-10-15**] and [**2162-11-9**].
PET scan [**4-22**] showed diffuse central lobular emphysema, an 11 x 6 mm spiculated right upper lobe opacity which was FDG-avid, an SUV max of 2.2, a 7 mm nodule in the left upper lobe, more inferiorly in the left upper lobe, 6 mm nodule also demonstrating FDG avidity, a spiculated opacity in the left upper lobe, also another nodule in the right middle lobe and in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.
- COPD/emphysema: severe, with PFTs in [**3-/2162**] FVC 61% predicted, FEV1 47% predicted, FEV1/FVC 69% predicted.
- current tobacco use - anemia: secondary to B12 deficiency, baseline Hct 26 - chronic kidney disease: baseline Cr 1.63 - peripheral vascular disease - MGUS - proteinuria - osteoporosis - glaucoma - recently complete 10-day course of metronidazole for diarrhea   Social History: She has 3 children, 2 sons and 1 daughter.
