Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2149-4-10**] 5:39 PM FINDINGS: The patient has undergone right temporal craniotomy with post- surgical changes, including a small amount of pneumocephalus, at the operative site extending superiorly and layering over the right frontal convexity.
5-mm rounded focus of hyperdensity in the right parietal operculum which may represent hemorrhage within an enhancing lesion seen within this region on MR study performed earlier the same date.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2149-4-10**] 6:57 AM MRI of the brain according to the WAND protocol.
Axial, coronal, and sagittal post-gadolinium imaging was obtained with axial MP-RAGE sequence.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2149-4-11**] 7:20 PM CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with status post surgery, rule out residual lesion.
Blood products and postsurgical changes are seen in this region.
On POD #1 she had a bedside swallowing evaluation which they recommended thick liquid/ground consistency solids with 1:1 supervision.
On POD 1 she also had a repeat MRI of the head to look for residual tumor which did show some residual enhancement.
Also due to her continued dysarthria it was decided that the decadron would be not be tapered to 2 mg po BID but instead stay at 3 mg PO TID.
