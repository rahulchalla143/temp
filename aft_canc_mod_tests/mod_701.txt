Chest CT [**11-28**] 1.
Abd/pelvic CT [**11-29**]:  No evidence of Retroperitoneal bleed.
Pelvic ultrasound and transvaginal:  Nabothian cyst, simple fluid in pelvis, small amount .
ECHO [**11-28**]  The left atrium is normal in size.
Brief Hospital Course:   # Pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis: CT Chest significant for bilateral PEs.
Her ECHO did not show evidence of right heart strain, and she had only a short period of hypotension which responded to fluids.
Her Hct dropped on the day of initiation of heparin, but workup did not reveal a GI bleed or a retroperitoneal bleed.
Her hematocrit was subsequently stable.
She should have a daily INR and an overlap of 48 hours with lovenox after her INR is > 2. .
She will require age appropriate cancer screening, including endoscopy, colonoscopy, and mammogram, as well as a hypercoaguable workup after 6 months on coumadin.
She had a TTG pending at the time of discharge, and will follow up with GI for further evaluation.
# Acute anemia, as well as anemia of chronic disease: Her initial Hct was 29.7 which dropped to 24.8 while in ED.
On repeat Hct is 21.8.
Her anemia workup revealed an anemia of chronic disease.
She received 2 units of blood, and her final Hct was 30.8.
Her laboratory values showed an extremely high ferritin, with low TIBC and transferrin, likely consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
ABG showed this as a chronic respiratory alkalosis, with metabolic compensation and lower bicarbonate.
# Acute renal failure:  She was admitted with acute dehydration and renal failure with creatinine 1.1.
With hydration, her creatinine returned to baseline, and is 0.6 at the time of discharge.
TSH 0.22 and T4 3.8 indicating she is hypothyroid.
# Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia:  She was admitted with electrolyte abnormalities, which were repleted.
Lovenox 60 mg/0.6 mL Syringe [**Month/Day (4) **]: Sixty (60) mg Subcutaneous twice a day: Until INR > 2 for 2 days.
Malnutrition   Discharge Condition: Stable, satting well on room air, blood pressure stable.
Return to the emergency room with worsening shortness of breath, swelling in your legs, chest pain, blood in your stool or black stool.
