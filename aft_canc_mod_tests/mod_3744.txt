fossa craniotomy/cranioplasty [**2166-3-22**]:Left posterior fossa exploration for hemorrhage/EVD [**2166-3-27**]: Replacement EVD drain at bedside [**2166-3-30**]: PEG placed   History of Present Illness: 69-year-old right-handed woman, with left facial spasms since [**2163**], who is here in the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic for an evalaution of her enlarging left cerebellopontine angle meningioma.
She had a gadolinium-enhanced head MRI on [**2164-2-17**] at [**Hospital 3278**] Medical Center that showed a left cerebellopontine angle mass abutting the exiting zone of the left 7th and 8th nerves.
Her head MRI was repeated on [**2165-11-5**] and it showed slight enlargement.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: Physical Examination: Temperature is 98.0 F. Her blood pressure is 140/72.
Heart rate is 64.
Respiratory rate is 20.
HEENT examination is unremarkable.
Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythms.
Funduscopic examination reveals sharp disks margins bilaterally.
Her muscle strengths are [**5-28**] at all muscle groups.
Her reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally.
Sensory examination is intact to touch and proprioception.
Coordination examination does not reveal dysmetria.
CT HEAD [**2166-3-20**]: There is no evidence of immediate post-surgical intracranial hemorrhage.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are aerated.
Recommend dedicated cervical spine MRI for further evaluation.
CT HEAD [**2166-3-22**] FINDINGS: There is interval placement of an intraventricular drain with right transfrontal approach and the tip terminating near the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
CT HEAD [**2166-3-22**] As compared to most recent prior study, craniotomy and post-surgical changes in the left posterior fossa, with mildly decreased air and fluid collection with stable small amount of hemorrhage and maybe hyperdense post-surgical material.
Imaged mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are grossly unremarkable.
NCHCT [**3-27**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
NCHCT [**3-27**]: IMPRESSION: Moderate degree of new intracranial hemorrhage tracking along the catheter tract after catheter removal, with extension into the ventricular system, distending the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, and tracking into the third and fourth ventricles.
NCHCT [**3-28**]: Stable appearance of hemorrhagic tract of prior catheter with extension into lateral ventricles and third and fourth ventricles.
MRI HEAD [**4-2**]: FINDINGS: When compared to the most recent head CT, there has been no significant change in the volume of intracranial hemorrhage, with the majority of residual hemorrhage remaining within the occipital horns bilaterally.
ECHO [**4-4**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There is no pericardial effusion CT TORSO [**4-4**]: 1.
2.5 x 1.8 cm thyroid nodule seen within the right lobe for which, if no previous evaluation has been performed elsewhere, a thyroid ultrasound is recommended on nonurgent basis.
CT HEAD [**4-6**]: Perhaps minimal increase in size of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles.
Other numerous abnormalities appear relatively stable in extent, compared to the CT scan of the head two days ago.

Her blood pressure was maintained less than 140, she was started on steroid [**Last Name (LF) 15123**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] MRI was done on post op day 1 which showed good resection of the tumor.
Her mental status was stable, and on [**3-26**] at 1500 a NCHCT was done to evaluate her clamping trial.
Head CT showed stable ventricular size and a stable neurologic examination and in the afternoon of [**3-27**], her EVD drain was removed.
This revealed extension of intraventricular hemorrage and blood along the EVD track.
Given her deterioration and CT scan, the EVD was replaced.
After the drain was replaced, her examination markedly improved.
TPA 1mg [**Hospital1 **] was given over three days to ensure ongoing patency of the tubing, as well as to facilitate thrombus degredation.
On [**3-31**] the patient was extubated and her neuro exam remained stable.
She was found to be severly hyponatremic on [**4-1**], with a Na level of 125 and serum osm of 274.
3% HTS @ 30cc/hr was started, with close monitoring of her labs.
However, on [**4-4**], after the HTS was discontinued, her NA again dropped to 128 and it was restarted in conjunction with sodium tablets.
Her SQH was stopped on [**4-3**] and EVD drain was removed in the morning of [**4-4**].
Head CT was performed afterward; revealing stable intracranial hemorrhage-without new bleeding.
CT torso, LENIS, and CSF were performed/sent.
Infectious disease was also consulted to guide antibiotic coverage, and identfication of febrile source was her sputum (Gram - rods).
Her sodium count remained from 135-145 with Na Tabs Q6.
Her neurological exam improved slightly, as she was more alert, attentive, and followed simple commands.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: [**1-25**]  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for prn constipation.
Sodium Chloride 1 gram Tablet Sig: Six (6) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for hyponatremia: Hold for Na > 145.
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for NAUSEA.
Hydralazine 20 mg/mL Solution Sig: One (1)  Injection Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for SBP > 160.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
