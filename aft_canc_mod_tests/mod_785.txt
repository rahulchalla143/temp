+chronic LE edema, which has worsened over the last 2 weeks.
In the ED, initial VS were Tc 98.3, BP 142/77 (baseline SBP's 90's), HR 102, RR 26, SaO2 high 80's/RA -> 98%/NRB.
Stat CXR demonstrated a left-sided apical PTX, confirmed by CT of the chest.
EKG was notable for low-voltage, however bedside echo done in the ED did not show a pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology.
Another CXR demonstrated a new right-sided PTX compared to the previous CXR taken 4-5 hours ago.
Both CT surgery and IP were consulted and bilateral chest tubes were placed in the ED by CT surgery.

[**12-25**] EKG - Low voltage, lower compared to prior EKG [**10-1**].
[**12-25**] CXR #1 - FINDINGS:  There is a new left-sided pneumothorax seen in the left upper lobe compared to the previous examinations.
[**12-25**] CXR # 2 - There is essentially no change in the left-sided pneumothorax.
Since the previous chest x-ray, there is a new linear opacity in the right hemithorax of unclear etiology.
[**12-30**]: CXR  Interval decrease in right pneumothorax is demonstrated, which is almost invisible on the current study.
[**1-4**]: CXR   In comparison with the study of [**1-1**], there is no significant change.
[**1-7**]: CXR  Interval development of a moderate-sized right hydropneumothorax.

Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the ascending colon and descending colon.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was intubated upon arrival to the MICU and had a BAL performed which showed no evidence of PCP or bacterial infection.
Her antibiotics were discontinued on [**12-28**] after her BAL cultures returned negative.
She had her L chest tube removed on [**12-28**] and her R chest tube removed on [**12-29**].
A chest X-ray was obtained and showed a R hydropneumothorax.
Pleural cultures was negative for bacterial or fungal infection.
She did initially improve with chest tube in place and had a talc pleurodesis performed on [**1-10**].
She was treated for presumed sepsis in the setting of hypotension with the antibiotics noted above which were discontinued without obvious source of infection.
She had an ECHO performed which showed preserved systolic function and evidence of diastolic dysfunction and elevated filling pressures as previously documented and likely secondary to her cardiac amyloid or her history of poorly controlled hypertension.
# CKD on HD - on HD T/Th/Sa, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**].
Hemolysis labs were negative.
Her Hct remained stable for the remainder of her MICU course following transfusion until [**1-23**].
Her hematocrit dropped 4 points and she received 2 units of blood.
Once stabilized in the ICU she underwent CTA which showed no evidence of PE.
She will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] one day after discharge for INR monitoring.
# HTN - Her anti-hypertensives were held due to relative hypotension .

Repeated chest X-rays showed that your lungs had expanded back to normal.
Because of diarrhea you had samples tested for infection - which were negative.
You had a colonoscopy that showed an increased number of blood vessels in part of your colon but no obvious source of bleeding.
