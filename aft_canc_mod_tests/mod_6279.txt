The patient previously had maxillary sinus disease on prior sinus CT. if further evaluation of sinuses is clinically indicated, consider a repeat sinus CT. [**2157-8-30**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-8-1**], the pericardial effusion is now larger and there is now right ventricular diastolic collapse.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-8-30**], no change.
[**2157-9-4**] CXR: AP chest compared to [**6-27**] through [**7-30**]: Moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which enlarged between [**6-13**] and [**7-27**] is unchanged subsequently.
Mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement are essentially unchanged since [**Month (only) **], and edema is minimal, if any, difficult to distinguish from relatively symmetric infrahilar opacification which could also be due to mild-to-moderate atelectasis.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-9-2**], the effusion is slightly larger and there is slightly more pronounced diastolic inversion of the right atrium.
The PAS, GMS, and tissue Gram stains are negative for microorganisms.
Culture growing enterococcus  [**2157-9-2**] Bone marrow biopsy: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by persistent involvement by patient's known acute leukemia.
As reported previously, the blasts express myeloid markers (CD117, CD13) along with B-marker CD19, as well as CD7.
Compared to the previous biopsy (S11-36436R, M11-540 dated [**2157-7-21**]), the current marrow shows a significant increase in both overall cellularity and blast count.
[**9-2**] BM biopsy showed extensive disease.
Derm biopsy of left shin showed chronic changes, and culture grew out enterococcus (likely seeded from [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] derm).
[**2157-8-30**] echo showed no signs of endocarditis.
Repeat [**Month/Day/Year **] culture on [**10-11**] negative.
Biopsy site of left shin healing well, still with erythema.
Fusarium sensitivities are >4 for Ambisome, >16 for Vori.
CXR WNL, electrolytes repleted, trops neg X2.
Repeat echo [**9-2**] showed persistent effusion without signs of tamponade.
Repeat [**9-9**] echo unchanged, with elevated pulmonary artery pressures (therefore, RV pressures are likely high, even if no RV collapse/frank tamponade).
He tolerated the procedure well, with inital output around 500-700 cc and he was transferred to the CCU.
Analysis of fluid revealed transudate with reactive inflammatory cells; cx (including mycobacteria and fungi) and cytology were negative.
Repeat TTE on [**2157-9-27**] showed persistence of small effusion.
Pleural fluid analysis showed transudate with reactive inflammatory cells; bacterial/mycobacterial/fungal cultures and cytology negative.
On [**10-18**], CXR showed slightly improved R atalectasis, stable L pleural effusion.
# RV STRAIN ON TTE: After the pericardial drain was place and then later pulled, echocardiogram showed new significant RV strain and volume overload.
Negative LENIs and VQ scan (performed in lieu of CTA [**12-22**] rising creatinine and thrombocytopenia).
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: While in the CCU, the patient developed acute renal failure, with creatinine trending up to 2.1 in the context of spiking a fever.
STAT head CT showed no acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or skull fracture but was notable for left frontal subgaleal hematoma.
Follow up head CT one week later revealed resolving left frontal subgaleal hematoma.
MR showed no evidence of enhancing soft tissues or fluid collection.
Mass does not appear infected and was only monitored on admission.
You were found to have a bacteria (called Enterococcus) growing in your [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and on skin biopsy and so you were treated with an antibiotic called daptomycin.
You got several imaging studies of your heart because we were worried about the fluid around it.
Finally, you had a repeat bone marrow biopsy that showed persistent leukemia.
