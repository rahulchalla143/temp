Followup imaging is recommended.
Review of images on bone windows does not show any suspicious bony lesions.
Followup imaging is recommended.
MRI Cervical, Thoracic, and Lumbar Spine FINDINGS:  There is normal lordotic curvature of the cervical and lumbar as well as kyphotic curvature of the thoracic spine.
Mild degenerative changes involving the cervical and lumbar spine as detailed above.
CT Head: FINDINGS:  A CT stereotaxis devise surrounds the visualized aspect of the brain.
Evaluation of the posterior far fossa is extremely limited by artifact.
There is no evidence of acute infarction with preservation of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation.
IMPRESSION: CT stereotaxis of known hyperattenuating lesion measuring up to 1.4 cm centered within the left thalamus with associated surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect with shift of normally midline structures to the right by 6 mm.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: FINDINGS:  A small amount of air and hemorrhage along the biopsy tract is stable.
Biopsy tract blood products and associated vasogenic edema are stable.

(1) Likely CNS Lymphoma:  Examination on admission was notable for a mild right facial droop, and mild right arm weakness in an UMN pattern.
On admission she underwent a lumbar puncture for cytology, results still pending.
On [**1-13**] she underwent a stereotactic guided biopsy of the thalamic lesion, with preliminary pathology consistent with lymphoma, for which she was transferred to the floor for treatment with high dose methotrexate.
Patient on arrival to floor had infusion on [**1-14**], with alkalkination of urine to PH >8 which was consistently monitored.
Her Methotrexate levels were drawn and found to be very low .02 prior to discharge.
Patient's pathology from her biopsy was concerning for CNS lymphoma.
You were seen by the Neurosurgery team who performed a biopsy in your brain.
Aftewards, you received a CT scan of your head due to concern for swelling/bleeding in the brain which was negative.
The prelimnary biopsy results were consistent with a lymphoma, and therfore you were given a dose of chemotherapy treatment (methotrexate).
You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
