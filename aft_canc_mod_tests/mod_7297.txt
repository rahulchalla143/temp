Hematocrit of 37.9, platelet count of 402, mean cell volume of 81.
Urinalysis with a specific gravity of 1.035, 0 to 2 red blood cells, 6 to 10 white blood cells, few bacteria.
Her Chem-7 was sodium of 132, potassium of 6.6 (hemolyzed, repeated at 5.7), chloride of 97, bicarbonate of 22, blood urea nitrogen of 23, creatinine of 0.8, glucose of 103.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course while she was on the Medicine Service is as follows:  The patient had a consultation by Hematology/Oncology on the day following admission, at which time a bone marrow biopsy was done, and the slide from the outside facility was read of her cutaneous lesions.
Additional biopsies of the skin were done in the [**Hospital 2652**] Clinic.

Following that through, from the [**4-25**] to the [**4-28**], she continued to have a rapid decline in her platelets; such that, on [**4-28**], her platelets were 18.
She had a lactate level drawn which was 15.5 (consistent with a metabolic acidosis).

The patient had a head CT done to further evaluation the lethargy and dramatic change in her mental status in her peri-febrile states.
Her head CT was negative for any bleed, any evidence of a regional infarction, or any mass lesions.
