An EKG on admission showed ST elevations in V2 and V3 with right bundle branch block at a rate of 115.
A repeat EKG once the rate normalized reportedly showed a classic Brugada pattern in V1/V2.
A bedside ultrasound did not show an effusion.
A CXR did not show any acute process and his known lung cancer appeared stable in size.
A CTA to rule out PE given his initial tachycardia and known malignancy history was negative.
Blood and urine cultures were obtained.

MICRO: Blood cultures [**2151-6-8**]:  CORYNEBACTERIUM SPECIES (DIPHTHEROIDS) OF TWO COLONIAL MORPHOLOGIES.
EKG [**2151-6-29**]:  Sinus rhythm.
CHEST [**2151-6-28**] FINDINGS: Evidence of a thin-walled cavity is seen in the right upper lobe, measuring grossly 3.1 x 3.5 cm.
Spiculated right upper lobe pulmonary nodules, better assessed on CT as are the previously noted mediastinum and hilar lymphadenopathy.
CHEST CTA [**2151-6-28**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence for pulmonary embolism.
This study is not optimized for evaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures, but images of the very upper abdomen show arterial calcifications and are otherwise unremarkable.
Of note, his blood culture from the ED grew out coronybacterium in [**2-9**] bottles which was felt to be a contaminant.
There initally was also concern for adrenal insufficency in the given his current steroid taper, however an AM cortisol was done and normal.
# Hyponatremia- Sodium of 127 on admission likely related to hypovolemia in setting of diarrhea and poor PO intake, although there may be a component of SIADH given underlying NSCLC.
His urine lytes show elevated chloride and sodium which would point to SIADH, but this was also done after fluid resusictation so may not be accurate.
EKG changes- EKG on admission showed initial concern for Brugada syndrome given pseudo-RBBB pattern with ST elevations.
He was monitored on tele without events.
He received 1U PRBC and Hct stabilized at 27.9 on discharge.
Improved to 27.6 after PRBC and stable at 27.9 today.
# Follow-up/Transitional: -Pt to follow up with primary oncologist on [**7-8**] -Na+ and Hct should be followed as an outpatient given hyponatremia and anemia in-house -EKG changes should be followed as an outpatient -Lisinopril was held in-house and on discharge given hypotension.
Decision to restart this to be addressed as outpatient  Medications on Admission: -dexamethasone taper 4mg qam and 2mg qpm until [**6-29**]; 4mg qam [**Date range (1) 58081**]; 2mg qam [**Date range (1) 10232**], 2mg QOD [**Date range (1) 58082**] -insulin glargine 10 units qam -lisinopril 10 mg by mouth once a day -ranitidine HCl 150 mg Tablet by mouth twice a day until [**2151-7-22**] (while on Decadron) -aspirin 81 mg by mouth once a day -multivitamin daily -psyllium [Metamucil] Powder 1 teaspoon by mouth once daily with full glass of water.
You were given fluids and your blood pressure improved.
We made the following changes to your medications: STOPPED:  Lisinopril until further instructed by your oncologist as your blood pressures have been running low in the hospital.
It was a pleasure participating in your care   Followup Instructions: Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: THURSDAY [**2151-7-8**] at 2:00 PM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 593**], MD [**0-0-**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 24**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: THURSDAY [**2151-7-8**] at 2:00 PM With: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6575**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 24**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: RADIOLOGY When: MONDAY [**2151-7-12**] at 1:55 PM With: RADIOLOGY MRI [**Telephone/Fax (1) 327**] Building: [**Hospital6 29**] [**Location (un) 861**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage
