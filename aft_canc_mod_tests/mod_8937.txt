Blood cultures x 2 - no growth to date  EEG: [**5-5**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of a mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy with extremely frequent paroxysmal bilaterally synchronous polyspike and high voltage sharp slow discharges.
[**5-6**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous EEG monitoring study because of frequent generalized bilaterally synchronus polyspike and wave epileptic discharges which are replaced by multifocal epileptiform discharges in the second half of the recording.
These findings are suggestive of a mild encephalopathy with potential infectious, metabolic or toxic etiologies, which gradually resolved through the course of this recording.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2121-4-26**] the rate has slowed.

Preliminary ReportCOMPARISON: CT from [**2121-5-5**].
Preliminary ReportTECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence images of the head were performed with Preliminary Reportand without contrast.
Continuous EEG monitoring was initiated and has revealed ongoing generalized epileptiform discharges despite her home dose of Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **].
A brain MRI was done to ensure no new mass lesions as a cause for seizure.
During your stay we did a MRI of your brain to look for any other cause of seizures but this did not show any cause.
