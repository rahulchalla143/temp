She had presented with LAD in neck in [**2165**] with CT showing multiple lymph nodes and biopsy cervical lymph node showing an atypical lymphoproliferative disorder, highly suggestive of evolving T-cell lymphoma.
Subsequent inguinal biopsy in [**5-16**] was interpreted as either EBV expressing large B cell NHL or angio-immunoblastic lymphoma with an EBV expressing malignant B cell clone.
In the ED, the patient's VS were T 99.3, BP 105/35, P 91, O2 96% on RA.
She had a CT Head and Neck, which did not show any evidence of ICH or fracture.
She had a CXR, which was negative for PNA, CHF, with trace fluid in R fissure, no pleural effusion.
She was admitted to medicine for further workup and evaluation.

ABDOMEN - NABS, soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding EXTREMITIES - WWP, no c/c/e, 2+ peripheral pulses (radials, DPs)  SKIN - no rashes or lesions LYMPH - no cervical, axillary, or inguinal LAD NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**4-11**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout, DTRs 2+ and symmetric, cerebellar exam intact, gait exam deferred.

Numerous new mediastinal, hilar, axillary, retroperitoneal, intraabdominal, mesenteric, pelvic, and inguinal enlarged abnormal lymph nodes are consistent with recurrent lymphoma.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
If there is concern for lymphoma, an MRI of the brain may be obtained for further characterization.
[**2170-4-9**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**4-7**], the cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with left basilar atelectasis.
Pt has also had low grade fevers, rigors and fatigue for several days, suggesting possible infection although exam non focal without elevated white count Her urine  cultures showed staph UTI.
Her presentation was discussed with her hematologist/oncologist who concluded that her rigors, fevers and fatigue was also strongly suggestive of  B sypmtoms due to lymphoma recurrence.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed which showed lymphoma recurrence.
Thrombocytopenia: Patient noted to have platelets trending down.
A HIT antibody was sent with a mildly positive result (Optic Density of 0.44) This was repeated and was negative.
A bone marrow biopsy showed involvement of lymphoma in her bone marrow and it was ultimately felt that she had bone marrow suppression and thrombocytopenia from lymphoma.
She was monitored on telemetry and was noted to be in and out of atrial fibrillation.
Her sodium trended down, and renal was consulted.
She was started on fluid restriction and given lasix because she was felt to be volume overloaded; however, her sodium continued to trend down and she became more somnolent and confused.
Her sodium improved with hypertonic saline.
Urine sodium decreased, suggesting improvement of her underlying SIADH.
She was then weaned off salt tabs and her sodium remained stable on only a 1L fluid restriction.
Sputum cultures failed to reveal a bacteria and she remained afebrile.
Hct was trended daily and remained stable and stools were guaiac negative.
TSH 2.6 on [**3-24**].
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
