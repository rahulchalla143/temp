Seen at [**Hospital6 33**] yest with EKG showing A-fib, rapid ventricular response, RBBB, T wave abnormality.
Workup included a CT scan of his abdomen dated [**2142-8-5**], which showed a 10.1 x 8.2 cm lobulated enhancing soft tissue mass causing distortion of the underlying renal architecture of the left kidney.
The pathology from the nephrectomy showed renal cell carcinoma of papillary subtype, which was 11.5 cm in greatest dimension.
He underwent radiation to the lumbar spine, which resulted in significant amelioration of symptoms.
HIS head CT revealed a left parietal hemorrhage with some mild mass effect.
His head MRI revealed at least one metastatic focus that was hemorrhagic in the left posterior frontal lobe, precentral in location.
MRI imaging on [**2-17**], according to Dr. [**Name (NI) 23016**] note, revealed, "a good resolution of the blood in the left posterior frontal metastasis; however, now, the right temporal FLAIR signal abnormality appears to have bled and is now approximately about 1.5 cm with some mild surrounding edema".
Of note, he has a history of PE that was diagnosed incidentally along with RCC ([**7-19**]), with no sx at that time.
In the ED tonight T98 HR 100 RR 18 BP 101/66 Sat 98% 2L.
EKG showed NSR at 93 bpm, 1 AVB, RBBB, no acute ischemic changes.
He had a D-dimer sent which was >5000.
He subsequently underwent a V/Q scan yielding a large area of mismatched hypoperfusion in the right upper lobe with a moderately high risk ratio for pulmonary embolism.
In the meantime, they recommended Mucomyst and Bicarb O/N pre-procedure as he has a chronic renal insufficiency.
His oxygen saturation with ambulation was documented by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] 99%-100%.
