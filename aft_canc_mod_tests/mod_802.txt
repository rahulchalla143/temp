COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis [**2187-3-4**].
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2187-5-5**] 2:36 AM  CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  Reason: assess for toxic megacolon and free air Field of view: 38  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 59 year old woman with abdominal distension & pain REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for toxic megacolon and free air CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after administration of oral contrast only.
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained and reviewed.
CT ABDOMEN: There is dependent opacity at the lung bases bilaterally, right greater than left.
Absence of intravenous contrast limits evaluation of the abdominal parenchymal organs and vasculature.
A few borderline distended loops of contrast opacified small bowel, with small air-fluid levels are seen in the mid abdomen, but small bowel loops are otherwise unremarkable.
CT PELVIS: There is a moderate amount of ascites within the pelvis.
KUB was performed which showed  stool filled and distended colon.
Abdominal CT was postponed because the patient had a history of acute renal failure with IV contrast, and nausea was preventing her from taking oral contrast.
Later inthe day the patient developed hypotension, with blood pressures 77/40.
She was bolused with 4L of Normal saline with increased blood pressures to 96/60.
She had a CT scan which revealed severe colitis, so was taken to the emergency room emergently for ex lap and subtotal colectomy with mucus fistula.
Her Cdif toxin came back positive so she was started on PO flagyl and vancomycin per her mucus fistula.
