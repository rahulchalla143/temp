The patient had recently been undergoing an evaluation for painless jaundice.
In early [**Month (only) 116**] the patient had an abdominal CT at an outside hospital which demonstrated intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
On [**2101-6-10**] the patient came to [**Hospital1 1444**] and underwent an ERCP by the GI team which demonstrated a pancreatic duct stricture, which was compatible with a mass, a biliary stricture, and a stent placement in the biliary system.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient was tachycardic with a blood pressure of 110/41.
The rectal examination was normal and guaiac negative.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 13, hematocrit 46, INR 2.1, BUN 80, creatinine 4.9, bicarbonate 11, ALT 84, AST 91, alkaline phosphatase 545, bilirubin 10.
Chest x-ray demonstrated the possibility of free air overlying the epigastrium.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to the presentation of an acute abdomen following an ERCP and the possibility of free air the patient was emergently taken to the operating room where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy.
A duodenal perforation was discovered and repaired with oversewing and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] patch.
A liver biopsy was taken as well.
He did continue to make urine and was postoperatively taken to the surgical intensive care unit for close hemodynamic monitoring.
The hematocrit remained stable.
On the floor the patient had a temperature spike which prompted a work-up and a CAT scan was performed.
He underwent a CT-guided drainage and the cultures demonstrated [**Female First Name (un) 564**] from this collection.
The patient defervesced and a follow-up CAT scan done prior to discharge demonstrates that the fluid collections have decreased in size.
The patient prior to discharge underwent a T-tube cholangiography to examine the placement of the T-tube and the anatomy of the biliary tree.
