A 24 hour urine for 5-HIAA was 45.4 and a repeat 24 hour urine in [**10-17**] was 50.3.
In [**11-16**] a CT of the abd/pelvis was done revealing a left hepatic lobe 5.2x5.2cm lesion and a right anterior lobe lesion measuring 3.7x 2.8cm.
An MRI revealed 3.5cm lesion in the dome of the right lobe, a 2.1cm lesion in the anterior segment of the right lobe and a 3rd 4.1cm lesion more caudad to the 2.1 cm lesion.
An arterial scan revealed five sites of abnormal tracer uptake in the liver.
In [**2148-1-12**] a triphasic CT demonstrated multiple liver lesions.
Liver volume was insufficient (1951cc)to perform the liver resection for these lesions.
Repeat CT demonstrated significant hypertrophy of the left lobe.

Two separate intraoperative studies were performed initially, intraoperative ultrasound guidance was provided to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to document location of masses in both the left and right lobes of the liver.
Following initial resection of all of the liver lesions, intraoperative ultrasound guidance was used which demonstrated an initial small lesion in the superficial portion of segment II.

The right costophrenic angle is not well visualized, suggesting a small to moderate- sized right pleural effusion.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
COMPARISON: Prior chest radiograph from [**2148-4-22**].
TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: A portable chest radiograph was obtained in semi-upright position.

The segment of small bowel is opened on its antimesenteric surface to reveal a tan-yellow circular mass, measuring 1 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm, located 13.5 cm from one stapled margin and 31.5 cm from the other stapled margin.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:  K=section of liver through capsule away from tumor nodule, L-P=sections of tumor nodule in relation to parenchymal nodule and capsular surface, Q=sections of biliary and vascular structures deep in the specimen.
Part 3 is additionally labeled "segment 4B cephalad", and consists of a segment of liver, measuring 4 x 3 x 2.1 cm with an overlying capsule measuring 4.2 x 3.5 cm.
Part 8 is additionally labeled "inferior left lateral segment nodule", and consists of a segment of liver parenchyma and overlying capsule, measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1.9 cm.
Part 10 is additionally labeled "portal lymph node", and consists of a 2.8 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm tan-yellow segment of fatty tissue with a yellow cut surface.
The largest fragment measures 4 x 2.5 x 0.3 cm, and the last fragment measures 2.8 x 2.5 x 1 cm, and contains small yellow excrescences of soft tissue, measuring up to 0.5 x 0.4 cm.
The specimen is for gross examination only, and has been reviewed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3924**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
A 24-hour urine for 5-HIAA was 45.4.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2147-11-22**] demonstrated 2 rounded hypodense lesions in the left lobe of the liver, 1 measuring 5.2 x 5.2 cm, and the second in the right lobe measuring 3.7 x 2.8 cm.
An MRI on [**2147-12-2**] demonstrated a 3.5 cm lesion in the dome of the right lobe, a 2.1 cm lesion in the anterior segment of the right lobe, and a third 4.1 cm lesion more caudad to the 2.1 cm lesion.
A [**Doctor Last Name 634**] retractor was then able to be placed.
Intraoperative ultrasound was then performed with the findings as noted above.
Estimated blood loss was 500 cc.
He was replaced with 5500 of crystalloid, EBL was 2,500mol and uop was 325cc.
Albumin was given.
Hct was stable.
Vital signs were stable.
On POD 2, pain was controlled, LFTs trended down, HR increased to low 100s after ambulation.
Hct was 29.5.
A repeat hct was stable at 29.9.
JPs drained 460/340 non-bilious fluid.
He complained of some mild sternum pain and EKG along with cardiac enzymes were performed.
On POD5 ([**4-27**]), his JP drains were still draining out 100, 130cc (lateral and medial, respectively).
