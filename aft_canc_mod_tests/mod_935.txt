In the ED, the patient had a urinalysis, which showed trace leukocytes, large blood, and few bacteria.
He was also found to have a white count of 13.4.
Vital signs were immediately taken, pacer pads were placed on the patient's chest, and a nasal cannula was placed on the patient's nose.
A BP was not able to be obtained initially, but he had 2+ bilateral pedal pulses.
Repeat Hct had just returned at 35, which was a 3 point Hct drop from the ER.
A fluid bolus of 500 cc NS was given.
CHF - EF 20-25% 3.
Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: [**2130-1-11**] GLUCOSE-216* UREA N-37* CREAT-1.5* SODIUM-136 POTASSIUM-4.6 CHLORIDE-96 TOTAL CO2-29 [**2130-1-11**] WBC-13.4 HGB-12.8* HCT-38.6* PLT COUNT-283 N-67.1 L-23.8 M-5.7 E-2.9 B-0.6 .
[**1-12**] CXR (AP): No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**1-17**] CT abdomen/pelvis: 1.
[**1-20**] Bladder biopsy pathology: 1.
Given this history, he was treated with a 7 day course of ceftriaxone for empiric UTI coverage, though his urine culture was negative.
CT urogram was concerning for possible recurrence of TCC (showed filling defect in the bladder).
He did have one episode of chest pain prior to the initial troponin leak, however this was felt unlikely to be ACS given transient nature and no EKG changes.
His SBP came back up to normal range without intervention.
Given the hypotension and his leukocytosis there was concern for developing urosepsis and he was transferred to the MICU.
He was given IVF and his BP came back to the normal range.
He was given a 250cc bolus of NS and his BP responded appropriately.
Urine and blood cultures were all negative making urosepsis less likely.
He did have a leukocytosis with WBC up to 15-16, however he remained afebrile.
## Acute renal failure: On admission, his creatinine was elevated to 1.5.
His creatinine improved to baseline after IVF repletion.
Beta blocker and [**Last Name (un) **] were held while in the MICU and re-started on the floor when his blood pressure was stable.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Recurrent bladder transitional cell carcinoma Secondary: 1) CHF 2) CAD 3) Acute renal failure 4) Diabetes mellitus, Type 2 .
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with blood in your urine and low blood pressure.
