[**Last Name (un) **] was presumed to be due to contrast nephropathy given I+O+ abdominal CT 3d prior to that admission due to concern for renal mass (later dx as renal cysts).
Further volume repletion corrected Cr to 1.1.

Past Medical History: two past episodes of ?ARF (dehydration/diarrhea leading to need for Mg repletion) HTN Hyperlipidemia Hypokalemia of unclear origin Previous duodenal ulcer with perforation and surgical intervention Renal mass, dx as renal cysts by CT ([**7-12**]) and U/S ([**7-16**]) Anemia  Social History: Lives with her husband, has two adult children (28 and 38 who both live locally).

Colonoscopy-Diverticulosis of the ascending colon (biopsy) Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum .
RUQ u/s-IMPRESSION: 1.
# Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Leukocytosis prompted fever workup esp for viral gastroenteritis, blood and stool cultures sent as well U/A, although bacterial infection less likely given 64.7% PMNs.
Blood, stool cultures negative, U/A negative.
Patient did not report abdominal pain and exam was benign but for distention and hyperactive bowel sounds.
Patient history does not corroborate this, but anion gap observed to be 25 (discussion below).
Osmolar gap was found to be normal, but urine tox was positive for barbiturates and amphetamines.
She immediately received about 750mL NS bolus and BP returned to 140s/80s.
EKG was unchanged from baseline.
Several hormonal studies (Vip, gastrin, serotonin, chromogranin A, HIAA) and a TTG were sent to determine the etiology of her diarrhea and were pending when she was transferred back to the floor.
Her HIV antibody was negative.
EGD showed hypertrophy of stomach, duodenal hypertrophy congestion consistent with excess acid secretion.
Pt's neuroendocrine markers were pending at the time of discharge as well as her biopsy results.
While in the MICU, the patient's PTT and INR rose to 2.3 and her HCT decreased to 25.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
A RUQ u/s was ordered and negative for liver pathology.
Also on the differential is amyloidosis given GI sx (particularly diarrhea), [**Last Name (un) **] and proteinuria per prior admission (possibly due to RBCs in urine), some evidence of conduction abnormalities on EKG (skipped ventricular beats).
PTH sent to parse out etiology of hypercalcemia, found to be elevated at 167.
# Anion gap: Presumed metabolic acidosis with anion gap of 25.
Serum osms were calculated and there was no gap.
Cr 2.0 and continued urine production does not suggest uremia.
AG resolved with fluids, metabolic acidosis persisted and urine AG was found to be negative suggesting appropriate renal response to loss of HCO3.
Calcium 600 600 mg (1,500 mg) Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day.
Outpatient Lab Work please have your magnesium level checked next week on [**8-3**] at your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
We also performed a number of tests on your urine and blood to check for different hormonal disorders that could lead to severe diarrhea.
[**Last Name (STitle) 18376**] and the gastroenterologists to discuss the results of your biopsy and follow up on the remainder of your laboratory results.
You should have an MRI or CT scan in the outpatient setting for further work up.
Followup Instructions: Please have your magnesium level checked next week at Dr. [**Name (NI) 85220**] office.
