Final pathology showed invasive adenocarcinoma (cholangiocarcinoma) Post operatively she was initially transferred to the SICU with a very labile BP ranging from 70 systolic to 160's.
She had a hct drop to 24% and received RBC and cryo in the unit after receiving 5 units pRBCs, 2 u PLts and 2 U FFP while in surgery.
She was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10 on POD 3.
She received 2 more units of pRBCs for a Hct of 26% after which time she remained completely stable.
