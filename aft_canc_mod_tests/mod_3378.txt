UA showed no evidence of UTI, though prior culture grew Enterococcus ~8000/ml.
CXR showed no acute process.
Vitals prior to transfer were T 97.7, BP 144/67, HR 77, RR 22, SpO2 96% on 2L.

Microbiology: blood cultures ([**7-25**]) x2: urine culture ([**7-25**]):  YEAST.
Imaging: CXR ([**7-25**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
CXR ([**7-26**]): IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-24**] through [**2145-7-25**]: Lung volumes are lower, and heterogeneous consolidation at the right lung base and more clearly recognizable atelectasis on the left are new, explained by interval aspiration.

Based on her CXR and rapid improvement, this was likely an aspiration pneumonitis rather than pneumonia.
Repeat CXR the morning following admission showed possible consolidation.
Sputum samples and other cultures were unrevealing.
Her WBC count was elevated to 28.1 from her baseline 15-17.
A urine culture and stool studies were sent.
Urine lytes on admission showed osmolality 831, UNa 28, UUrea 1325, and UCr 118, with extremely low FENa 0.08% and low FEUrea 19%.
She received hydration given her combined hypovolemia and hypernatremia, and electrolytes were monitored Q6H until Na normalized.
Her Hct was 32.4 on admission, likely with hemoconcentration, and decreased to 28.1 on recheck in the ICU.
Her MCV is microcytic at 73, likely due to iron deficiency or anemia of inflammation.
Her Hct remained stable and no further investigation was done during this admission.
# Hypertension: On admission, the patient was hypertensive with BP in the 160s despite her volume depletion.
Her BP remained relatively high in the 120s-140s, with no further intervention.
A chest x-ray showed that you had a possible pneumonia and you were treated with antibiotics in case of infection.
You also had some abnormalities on your blood tests suggesting that you were very dehydrated.
Your temperature and cough resolved and your blood tests trended down to a normal range.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
Please discontinue use of the amlodipine and HCTZ, as your blood pressure is well-controlled with clonidine patch only.
