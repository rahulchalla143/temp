She had a CXR that showed early LLL infiltrate.
CT abdomen with stable R hydroureteronephrosis and fluid overload.
Patient was admitted to the Medical floor and was noted to have BP in 80s again, she was also noted to be tachypneic and transferred to the MICU.

Pulsus -2 mmHg .
CVR - Tachycardic, regular, 3/6 SEM heard throught ?RUB Abdomen - soft, mildly distended, no rebound or guarding Ext - trace edema bilaterally Neuro - A&O X3, able to relay history without difficulty  Pertinent Results: Admission labs: WBC 5.7, Hct 13.1, plt 84 Na 136, K 4, cl 105, bicarb 20, BUN 41, Cr 2.4 .

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Ms [**Known lastname **] was considered likely to be significantly hypovolemic considering her h/o decreased po intake, her urine electrolyes which were prerenal, and her physical exam including flat neck veins, tachycardia, hypotension.
Cortisol stim test revealed appropriate stim.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] eventually became quite tachypneic with labored breathing and evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR (although it is likely that her tachypnea was also fueled by her serious metabolic acidosis with a bicarb of 8).
Because of Ms. [**Known lastname 17064**] underlying poor prognosis with an atrial mass and likely malignancy, discussions were had with the patient and her nephew [**Name (NI) 382**] and they decided to not pursue further invasive care such as central line placement and vasopressors.
