IMAGING: CT HEAD W/OUT CONTRAST [**2118-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
ELBOW X-RAY [**2118-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: Mildly displaced comminuted lateral epicondyle fracture with 6 mm osseous fragment within the joint space.
PELVIC X-RAY [**2118-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: No definite fracture or dislocation.
CXR [**2118-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and bibasilar atelectasis.
Echocardiogram (TTE) [**2118-4-12**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-3-25**], tricuspid regurgitation is more prominent and pulmonary pressures are higher.
Left ventricular function and the other findings are similar  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1617**] is a 88F with hx of CAD, AF on coumadin, CML, CRI who presented s/p fall and found to have UTI complicated by hypotension.
# Urinary tract infection, complicate by sepsis: The patient's admission urine culture grew E. coli.
CXR showed a right perihilar opacity that was concerning for pneumonia.
Blood pressures stabilized without need for pressors.
# Wide complex tachycardia: On [**4-13**], the patient a wide-complex tachycardia, which was likely due to Afib with aberrency.
She was initially treated with amiodarone, then with metoprolol, with improvement in her heart rate from 130-140 to 100-110.
The patient was supratherapeutic on her coumadin, which was held during the initial part of her hospitalization and gradually restarted.
Her creatinine increased to as high as high as 2.6.
# Coronary artery disease: Most recent echo showed EF of 35%, pt s/p PM and ICD placement, most recent cath in [**2103**] showed sizable inferior wall akinesis and RCA occlusion.
The patient was closely monitored in the intensive care unit and treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, diuresis, non-invasive positive pressure ventillation, and other non-invasive measures.
