He returned to the ED at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] in the evening of [**2158-2-13**] (1d prior to transfer here), where his VS were notable for fever to 102.2F (after arriving afebrile) and tachycardia (normalized with 1.5 L IVF), and exam was notable for somnolence.
His WBC was elevated at 14.9.
INR was 3.3.
A NCHCT showed *Left mastoiditis*.
However, around 6:00am the morning after admission ([**2157-2-14**]), the patient had a GTC seizure requiring 12mg IV lorazepam to stop.
His post-ictal exam was notable for spontaneous movements of all four extremities, but lack of eye opening/arousability.
His HCT was repeated after the seizure, and a very tiny focus of hemorrhage (hyperintensity) was seen at the posterior end of the Left lateral ventricle (~trigone).
Finally, there was a large hypodensity in the Right temporal lobe, which looks old, and could be the "old stroke" seen on MRI in [**2156**] on OSH workup in [**State 622**] for his only previous GTC seizure (see PMH, below).
Regarding his infectious and other general medical workup/treatment, he had [**4-17**] BCx bottles return positive for GPC in pairs.
The cultures were repeated post-antibiotics.
A TTE was obtained out of concern for septic cerebral embolus, and it did not show valvular vegitations, but did show several thickened/diseased valves.
Atrial fibrillation, lonstanding, now on warfarin (started [**2157-12-6**], see OMR Cardiology note)   4.  h/o stroke seen on MRI at OSH (in [**State 622**], on presentation for stroke, see below) > or = 2y ago, details unknown to me at this point other than an OSH MRI from [**2156**] showed an "old stroke," which seems like the most likely culprit for his subsequent memory deficits and the seizure in [**2-/2156**] (and now) and the old Right-temporal abnormality seen on HCT at the OSH.
Initially presented to OSH in [**State 622**] with first-ever seizure [**2156-3-1**] ([**Hospital 624**] hospital in [**Location (un) 625**], VA; had been visiting his son) -- a GTC x 30-45min and post-ictal [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 555**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 167**]-hemiparesis, which resolved; reportedly negative MRI, echo, and EEG at the OSH, and a normal EEG here at [**Hospital1 18**].
Physical Exam: General Physical Examination (coma exam) on Admission  Vital signs on transfer/arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]-ICU: afeb, [**Age over 90 **]F   70-75   115/60 RR 15 and SaO2 98% on CMV FiO2=40% / PEEP=5 (f-set at 15; Vt of 570-580 on setting of 550)  Eyes closed, moves all four extremities spontaneously 2x wrist restraints.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, and non-distended, + minimal bowel sounds.
***************** Neurologic examination (off propofol x 5-10min at ~1am):  Mental Status: Eyes closed, and do not open to loud voice or to sternal rub.
-Reflex examination (left; right): no asymmetry detected.
Pertinent Results: Current Labs:  WBC 6.2 Hb 11.4 HCT 34.6 Plt 161 Na 139 K 4.8 Cl 109 CO2 22 BUN 23 Cr 0.6 Glu 108 INR 1.4  EEG ([**2-15**]): This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of a poorly maintained 6.5 Hz background which appeared only briefly and due to generalized delta slowing which predominated the record.
If the clinical suspicion for seizures is high, prolonged bedside EEG monitoring may helpful for further diagnosis  MR head: No acute infarction; Redemonstration of susceptibility and fluid-fluid layering within the bilateral occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] consistent with a scant amount of intraventricular hemorrhage; Opacification of the left mastoid which given the central diffusion abnormality may represent acute mastoiditis as there is no evidence that this is chronic, recommend clinical correlation.
CT abd ([**2-20**]):  Multiple dilated loops of small bowel with no discrete transition point and an uncomplicated small bowel-containing left inguinal hernia, most likely represent ileus or enteritis  CT head ([**3-3**]): No acute abnormality is seen.
Seizures: He has had known seizure disorder since [**2156**] and was treated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 629**] on Keppra 750 [**Hospital1 **].
He had a routine EEG performed on arrival that showed him to be encephalopathic.
Fevers: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 630**] had 2 culture bottles from OSH that grew Streptococcus.
ID consult was obtained and they suggested a TEE which was performed that showed no cardiac vegetations.
He had urine cultures, blood cultures, and sputum cultures that were all negative.
A BAL culture grew only Commensal Respiratory Flora.
KUB and CT scan suggestive of an ileus.
No transition point on CT scan to suggest SBO.
NS at 125cc/hr.
For your fevers, cultures from the outside hospital grew streptococcus.
Repeat cultures here were negative.
