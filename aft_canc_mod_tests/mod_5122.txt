#  Hypotension - The patient was initially bolused 4 L IVF in the ED without much response in her BPs and was placed on levophed gtt on arrival to the ICU.
A chest CTA was negative for PE.
Cardiac ischemia was unlikely given a EKG without ischemic changes.
Infection was unlikely given a negative CXR, negative UA and lack of fevers.
A repeat MRI brain showed evolution of the lesions consistent with either stroke or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).
An MRI spine was performed which was pending at time of discharge.
#  NSCLC - Stage IV c/b mets to brain, s/p brain whole brain XRT.
You were very briefly on medicines to help keep your blood pressure up, but these were quickly stopped.
While here you had an MRI of your head that showed stable, largely resolved brain metastases, as well as what looks like your old stroke.
