This is concerning for cholangitis with report of BC positive for GNR at outside lab facility.
Her bilirubin was elevated on presentation likely from acute biliary drainage blockage and improved after the exchange.
CT abdomen was performed which revealed her biliary tube to be in good positions, however there are also multiple hepatic and uterine abscesses which may be due to hematogenous spread of pathogen or possibly superinfection of necrotic metasteses.
[**Company **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and reported that blood culture grew enterobacter cloacae, [**Last Name (un) 36**] to cefepime, levofloxacin, cipro.
1 blood culture in hospital also grew GNRs and GPCs.
Preliminary gram stain of bile culture grew GPCs and GNRs.
The etiology of her bacteremia being these multiple hepatic abscesses was discussed with the patient and her family, and a decision was reached to forgoe IR intervention, and to continue just with IV antibiotics and her home hospice care.
As such a PICC line was placed, confirmed via CXR to be in good position, and she was discharged to home with home hospice care.
Her CT scan after biliary stent replacement showed likely superinfection of necrotic metasteses in her liver, which is a very poor prognostic sign.
#Hypoxemia: Pt's oxygen saturation was reportedly 85% on RA at the ED and improved to 100% on NRB.
CXR was clear.
