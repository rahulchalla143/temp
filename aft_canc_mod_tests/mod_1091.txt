He saw his primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2164-2-6**], at which time his workup included a stress test which was negative and an echocardiogram which had evidence of a left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
He was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2031**] in [**2164-9-5**] and had a repeat echocardiogram there in [**2164-10-6**] with evidence of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular outflow tract gradient at 48 mmHg which increased to 88 with Valsalva.
At that time, he had an ejection fraction of 60% and evidence of asymmetric septal left ventricular hypertrophy.
He had a repeat stress test which was negative, per patient.
Electrocardiogram on Norpace had evidence of a mildly prolonged Q-T interval and sinus bradycardia with first-degree atrioventricular heart block.
On [**5-27**], he underwent the procedure and tolerated the procedure well and developed 4/10 chest pain/chest pressure during the procedure which quickly resolved.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems, the patient denies any history of syncope, lightheadedness, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, weight gain, or chest pain.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature of 97.7, pulse of 77, blood pressure of 130/74, respiratory rate of 14, satting 99% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, and neck examination revealed pupils were equally round and reactive to light.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal examination revealed bowel sounds were positive, soft and nontender.
Neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented times three.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission revealed a white blood cell count of 3.2, hematocrit of 26.8, platelets of 158, mean cell volume of 97.
Sodium of 140, potassium of 3.9, chloride of 105, bicarbonate of 26, blood urea nitrogen of 27, creatinine of 0.7, blood sugar of 116.
Initial creatine kinases were 248, MB of 38, index of 15.3.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram on admission showed a normal sinus rhythm at 68 with evidence of a new right bundle-branch block.
Echocardiogram and catheterization done during this hospitalization showed clean coronaries, and left ventricular outflow tract resting gradient of 98 mmHg which increased to 160 after 2.5 mg of dopamine and 4 cc of alcohol injected into the septal perforating arteries.
Again, repeat electrocardiograms and telemetry showed no further evidence of heart block.
The patient remained chest pressure free for the remainder of his stay.
The patient had a repeat echocardiogram prior to discharge which showed evidence of symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with return of left ventricular outflow tract gradients to 90, ejection fraction of 75%, and the patient was discharged on 75 mg of Toprol-XL and aspirin and was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2031**] for a repeat echocardiogram in two to three weeks.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome, with a baseline hematocrit in the 26 to 30 range.
The patient's initial hematocrit was 26.8 on arrival; however, during his stay, with multiple blood draws and his procedure, the patient's hematocrit trended down to 24.5, but stabilized there.
