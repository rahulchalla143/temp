Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 103207**] is an 83 y/o M with known CAD, HTN, cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis, h/o HCC, h/o hepatic encephalopathy admitted with chest pain and found to have a worsening pericardial effusion/cardiac tamponade compared to ECHO [**2200-6-18**], now s/p R heart cath and pericardocentesis [**7-2**], and R. VATS, pericardial window [**7-3**].
# Pericardial effusion/ pre-tamponade: Pt admitted on [**7-2**] with chest pain and significant worsening of pericardial effusion on echocardiogram indicating tamponade.
[**Name2 (NI) **] has a prior known malignancy (HCC) with recent new liver lesions on CT of the abdomen; however, AFP < 1, and pericardial fluid cytology was negative for malignant cells.
Due to a gram stain result on [**7-3**] which showed gram positive rods in the pericardial fluid, he was treated with one dose of Ceftriaxone.
However it was felt that this finding was most likely a result of contamination because no other fluid or culture specimens showed bacteria, pt.
Flexible bronchoscopy and thoracotomy showed no evidence of malignancy.
Patient's cultures were all negative.
Serial CXR's showed R. lower pleural effusion and R.lower lobe atelectasis.
His last echo on [**7-10**] showed a trivial pericardial effusion.
#melena/BRBPR: Patient experienced melena on [**7-9**], BRBPR [**7-10**], HCT drop on [**7-8**], transfused.
He was evaluated by the GI service and Hct was monitored and found to be consistant with a slow bleed.
Patient had non-contrast head CT which found no acute changes.
Cardiac echo found a very small pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
# Hypertension: Well controlled during hospitalization with SBP ranging in 110-120s.
Finger sticks were performed.
