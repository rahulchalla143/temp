MRI of sella would be helpful for further evaluation.
MRI is recommended if possible to further evaluate these structures.
Pituitary apoplexy cannot be excluded on CT imaging.
Cards ECHO([**9-16**]) IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional left ventricular systolic function.
CXR [**9-20**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Head CT [**9-21**]: NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: 1) No short-interval change in hyperattenuating, round primarily intrasellar mass with suprasellar extension, remodeling the dorsum sellae; dDx includes macroadenoma, perhaps with hemorrhage, as well as intrasellar craniopharyngioma or Rathke cyst.
Head CT [**9-28**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Head ct was performed and a pituitary mass identified.
After adequate work up and consults with opthomology for visual field testing and endocrinology, transpenoidal pituitary resection was conducted on [**9-21**].
Post operatively her neuro exam was completely intact, but there was question as to her pacemaker working appropriated.
Serum sodium and osm, as well as urine sodium, osm, and specific gravity remained stable during hospitalization, only requiring one dose of vasopressin on POD#3.
On [**10-2**] she was discharge to home without the need of services with a INR of 2.5 and direction to follow up with PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 766**] AM for blood drawing to ensure adequate INR level.
