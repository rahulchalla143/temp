G0 transferred from [**Hospital3 **] to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2166-4-22**] for evaluation of large pelvic masses.
Abdominal U/S in PA from [**2165-12-4**] showed enlarged uterus, multiple fibroids, ovaries both normal.
On [**2166-2-28**], MRI showed bilateral solid and cystic masses in the adnexa, endometrial thickening to 18mm, and multiple fibroids.
She subsequently had an U/S [**2166-3-27**], which again showed complex bilateral adnexal masses, enlarged compared to previous imaging and endometrial stripe of 21 mm.
Another MRI was also performed on [**2166-4-10**], which again showed adnexal masses, thickened endometrium, enlarged uterus, small amount of pelvic ascites, as well as bony lesions in the right ileum, and L4-L5 vertebral bodies.
After receiving contrast for a CT scan [**2166-4-18**], she began having significant n/v.
Labs at that time were significant for Cr 3.0 (up from 1.6 on [**4-19**]); she also had low urine output, 125-200 cc per 8 hr shifts.
A renal U/S was performed, which showed bilateral hydronephrosis, bilateral echogenic kidneys.
The pt also had a CXR which was normal except for small bilateral effusions, and a bone scan, which was negative.
The pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for gyn onc evaluation.

[**5-7**] pelvic MRI suggested probable communication between anterior vagina & peritoneal cavity, allowing ascitic fluid to drain per vagina.
