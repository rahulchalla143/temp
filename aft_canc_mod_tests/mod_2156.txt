The results from those studies revealed that patient, in fact, had a mitral valve prolapse but also had an incidental finding of an ascending aortic aneurysm.
High porphin levels in blood, undergoes phlebotomy every six months.
Her postoperative laboratory data were significant for a hematocrit of 33, down from a baseline of 40 taken on [**2143-10-10**].
Additionally, her BUN and creatinine were 16 and 0.7, baseline 21 and 0.9 from [**2143-10-10**].
She had a lactate of 2.7.
Liver function tests were within normal limits.
Her blood pressure was stable, in the 110s to 120s systolic.
Her chest tubes were removed and her laboratory data at that time showed a hematocrit of 27, that was stable from the previous day of 27.
Her potassium was 3.8, which was repleted.
Her BUN and creatinine were 21 and 0.8, magnesium 1.7 and the remainder of electrolytes were within normal limits.
A chest x-ray on postoperative day number revealed bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with left lower lobe collapse, thought to be secondary to atelectasis.
The patient's discharge examination is significant for a temperature of 99, blood pressure 99/60, pulse 86 and regular, respiratory rate 20 and oxygen saturation 94% in room air.
Discharge laboratory data were remarkable only for a hematocrit of 27, which was stable from [**2143-11-2**], as well as electrolytes that were within normal limits and a creatinine of 0.9.
DI[**Last Name (STitle) **]ION/FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will be discharged to home with home VNA services for blood pressure monitoring, heart rate monitoring as well as wound check.
