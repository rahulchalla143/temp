CXR (portable AP) [**2150-4-3**]: Increased vague densities at the bases, which could be atelectasis or pneumonia.
CXR (PA and lateral) [**2150-4-4**]: On the current study there is evidence of a patchy density at the left lower lobe posteriorly, consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
There are no features of CHF and the heart size is normal.
Echocardiogram (TTE) [**2150-4-6**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
There is an anechoic structure in the left popliteal fossa measuring 1.7 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm, most consistent with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4675**] cyst.
CT head w/o contrast [**2150-4-12**]: 1.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2150-4-12**]: 1.
Further evaluation with a dedicated radiograph is recommended.
CT right lower extremity [**2150-4-13**]: 1.
The lucency quesitoned in this area on the [**2150-4-12**] abdominal CT likely represents partial imaging of a prominent area of more diffuse osteopenia ([**Hospital1 **] triangle), but is not thought to represent a focal lytic lesion.
Incompletely imaged left intrarenal soft tissue mass with delayed clearance of contrast from an inferior left renal calix, concerning for a transitional cell carcinoma, similar in appearance to the study performed on [**2150-4-12**].
Scrotal ultrasound [**2150-4-14**]: 1.
CXR (portable AP) [**2150-4-21**]: Interval placement of a PICC line is seen with right arm entry and tip in the expected location of the superior vena cava.
Bone scan [**2150-4-21**] (wet read): negative .
Skin biopsy right thigh [**2150-4-13**]: Marked superficial dermal edema and perivascular and interstitial mixed cell infiltrate with lymphocytes, neutrophils, and rare eosinophils.
The number of neutrophils is less than usually observed, however, inflammation may be decreased in resolving lesions of erysipelas.
PAS and gram stains are negative for fungi and bacteria respectively.
BNP was [**2066**].
An echocardiogram was performed and showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
TSH was normal and ECHO showed normal global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
He was bladder scanned for 350 cc prior to discharge and refused a Foley [**Last Name (un) **].
C. diff was negative x 5.
Skin biopsy was consistent with this.
CT and ultrasound were done to rule out Fournier's gangrene.
The patient's rash was improving and sutures were removed prior to disharge.
He should have CBC with diff and LFTs checked weekly while on nafcillin.
This finding was not confirmed by plain films or by CT of the patient's right lower extremity.
The psychiatrist at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab should be consulted and will arrange for appropriate follow-up, which may include transfer back to the psychiatry service at [**Hospital1 18**].
You had a bladder scan which showed that there was still 350 mL of urine in your bladder.
