Initial brochnoscopy at [**Hospital1 1562**] on [**12-31**] showed endobronchial, friable, "pearly white" lesion @ "take off" of right lower lobe.
CT scan here of airway showed large tumor burden on right with almost total collapse of RLL (see below for report).
Prelim biopsy report c/w lung ca, but final report pending.
Past Medical History: PMH: h/o tularemia [**2138**] (hospitalized) h/o babesiosis- 5 yrs ago (hospitalzed) chornic/recurrent right sided pnas 2-4 episodes in last year- last admit few weeks before current admission GERD eye surgery OTHER DATA: CT scan at [**Hospital1 1562**] by report [**12-18**]: R lower lobe infiltrate spirometry at [**Hospital1 1562**] [**2162-12-30**]: FEV1 2.63 (79% predicted).
TLC 102% predicted.
His vital signs are within normal limits.
Cervical exam reveals no supraclavicular or cervical adenopathy.
Lungs are clear to auscultation and bilaterally equal.
Pertinent Results: CT trachea [**2163-1-1**]: Near-complete collapse of the right lower lobe secondary to a mass which obstructs the right lower lobe segmental bronchi and extends up to the level of the right middle lobe origin.
Bronchoscopy report [**2163-1-4**]: There was normal anatomy down to the level of the right lower lobe.
P-MIBI on [**2163-1-21**]: 1.
CXR [**2163-1-24**]: Moderate right pneumothorax with chest tubes in place.
A bit more patchiness in opacity is seen in the right lower lung field, a finding which should be reassessed on subsequent followup studies.
COMMENTS: Portable erect AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed, and compared with the previous study of [**2163-1-30**].
[**2163-2-3**] 7:24 AM CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 64 year old man with s/p RML/RLLobectomy , continued air leak REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: 64 year old man with s/p RML/RLLobectomy , continued air leak REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Interval evaluation after right middle lobe and right lower lobe lobectomy.
Portable AP chest x-ray was reviewed and compared to the previous study from [**2163-2-2**].
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2163-2-4**] 6:51 AM Reason: please eval for change--compared to [**2-3**]--9:30pm [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 64 year old man with s/p RML/RLLobectomy, s/p CT removal, worsenign crepitus and voice change REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please eval for change--compared to [**2-3**]--9:30pm HISTORY: Status post right middle and right lower lobectomies and chest tube removal, with worsening crepitus and voice change.
Evaluation of the right-sided intrathoracic detail is once again limited by the extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall.

OR was delayed for acute chest pain with bradycardia, no EKG changes or increase in cardiac markers were seen.
Due to a suboptimal pre-op exercise stress test a Persanthine MIBI was obtained which was normal.
