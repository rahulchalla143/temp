He was in contact with his PCP with these findings and underwent an ultrasound followed by a CT of his head and neck.
The scan revealed adenopathy extending from the left ear into the mediastinum and right axilla and the patient was asked to return to the ED for further work up.
He received a CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis which revealed a mediastinal mass with multiple enlarged nodes in the mediastinum, right axilla, subclavicular and aortocaval nodes near the level of the kidneys.
He was then admitted to [**Hospital1 18**], where he underwent VATS and mediastinal mass biopsy, which was nondiagnostic.
He was readmitted from [**Date range (1) 9397**], where he had ENT, thoracics and ACS consults who all felt that there were no clear options for where his repeat biopsy should occur.
It was felt that his lymph nodes could represent reactive lymphadenopathy from his SVC syndrome, but also that a mediastinal mass biopsy could be unrevealing as this was the case in his last VATS.
Therefore he had PET CT to identify FDG-avid lymph nodes most appropriate for biopsy which revealed diffuse disease.
Chest compressions were initiated and he was shocked once with ROSC.
A left femoral a-line and IJ CVL were placed in the setting of the code.

A significant proportion of the biopsy is composed of dense fibrous tissue with scant lymphoid infiltrate, but prominent focal fibroblastic proliferation.
The same subset of large cells is negative for CD20 and CD79a.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[**12-11**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY: No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Vascular compromise is difficult to assess with this non-contrast study - contrast-enhanced CT of the chest is recommended for better assessment of the vascular and bronchial structures in the chest (if clinically indicated).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
IMPRESSION: Low normal left ventricular systolic function, improved compared to the prior study on [**2122-12-11**].
Pleural effusion had LDH of 325 (serum LDH 271) -> exudative likely from pneumonia vs. malignancy.
Fluid was sent for cytology and was pending at the time of discharge.
Sputum culture and blood cultures were negative.
The patients ejection fraction was noted to be depressed to 40% consistent with myocardial stunning from cardiac arrest but later normalized to 55% on repeat echocardiography.
Patient was informed of danger signs such as palpitations, racing heart beat, light-headedness to call 911 emergently.
# Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Pathology consistent with Hodgkin's Lymphoma, but final pathology will need to be followed-up on.
# PLEURAL EFFUSION: Pleural fluid had LDH of 325 (serum LDH 271) -> exudative likely from pneumonia vs. malignancy.
Cytology was still pending at time of discharge.
Infectious work-up was negative and WBC soon normalized.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ===================== - Outpatient sleep study for possible OSA.
