The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a history of throat cancer who presented to [**Hospital1 188**] in [**2173-5-28**] for leg claudication and at that time an admission chest x-ray showed right upper lobe and left lower lobe lung masses.
At that time he had a right upper lobe wedge resection and pleural biopsy which was negative for malignancy on pathology, and he also had a negative bone scan and head MRI for metastatic disease.
In [**Month (only) 216**] of this year he was admitted again for an uncomplicated left femoral peroneal bypass surgery for his leg claudication, and further workup at that time revealed a left lower lobe 3-cm mass.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed with initial of right atrium 4, pulmonary artery pressure of 38/14, cardiac output of 5.9, cardiac index of 3.2, and systemic vascular resistance of 1038.
He also had several bronchoscopies during this admission which showed multiple mucous plugs and left upper lobe collapse.
Sputum from the bronchoscopy grew Klebsiella and Serratia which were pan sensitive, and he was started on ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime.
His chest x-ray showed progressive bilateral multilobar pneumonia versus acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Efforts at weaning were limited by secretions, high oxygen requirement, and increased respiratory rate if pressure support was decreased, and he was requested to be transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs were temperature maximum of 99.5, pulse of 92, blood pressure between systolic 103 to 169 and diastolic 40 to 60.
In general, on ventilation at AC with a tidal volume of 550, respiratory rate of 20, FIO2 of 0.7, PEEP of 8; most recent arterial blood gas 7.28/59/78.
Ins were 1841, outs 1535, net positive 306.
Length of stay fluid balance -11.9 liters.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 21.1, hematocrit 32.5, platelets 382.
Sodium 140, potassium 3.9, chloride 107, bicarbonate 27, BUN 42, creatinine 1.2, glucose 129, anion gap 10.
Calcium 8.1, ionized calcium 1.18, phosphorous 2.7, magnesium 2.
Urinalysis was negative on [**10-27**].
Microbiology on [**10-18**] bronch growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella and Serratia.
Blood cultures negative to date.
Urine cultures negative to date.
Pulmonary function tests on [**2173-8-16**] revealed FEV1 of 1.34 (57% of predicted), FEV1:FVC 106% of predicted, TLC 75% of predicted, DSBVA 53% of predicted, BL/VA 85% of predicted; with conclusion consistent with an interstitial process.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Chest x-ray on [**2173-9-29**] revealed extensive left lung consolidation throughout, right upper lobe consolidation, probable left lower lobe effusion.
Abdominal ultrasound on [**2173-10-21**] revealed biliary sludge, no obstruction, fatty liver.
Most recent electrocardiogram on [**2173-10-25**] revealed sinus at 90, normal axis, intervals 0.2/0.12/0.36, diffuse T wave flattening in limb leads which were new compared to preoperative electrocardiogram on [**2173-9-30**].
Echocardiogram stress in [**2173-5-28**] showed an ejection fraction of 60% to 70%, no wall motion abnormalities, no ischemia.
He was followed on arterial blood gas and was on assist control ventilation while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
He became progressively acidotic by his followed arterial blood gas, and his set respiratory rate was increased to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
A repeat chest x-ray showed continuation of diffuse alveolar infiltrations bilaterally, left greater than right.
With increased sedation his arterial blood gas results remained steady, and he seemed to be more in synchronization with the ventilation.
However, in order to rule out cardiogenic shock, and echocardiogram was done on [**11-1**] which was within normal limits.
He was also given intravenous fluids boluses which only helped temporarily to support his blood pressure.
His subclavian tip grew vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus and was removed.
He was given one dose of vancomycin for this at 1 g.  Blood cultures did not grow anything to date.
On [**10-31**], two more blood cultures were checked as they were on [**11-1**] given his rising temperature.
Urine cultures were also negative to date.
His white blood cell count continued to rise despite his antibiotic treatment, and with his hypotension this was consistent with a septic picture.
A sputum culture was sent on [**11-1**].
Urine electrolytes were checked, and his FENa was calculated at 1.3; not consistent with a prerenal etiology.
All of his medications were renally doses on [**11-1**], and his urine output progressively decreased and became darker in coloration.
The patient's liver function tests were also noted to be increasing, particularly his AST, alkaline phosphatase, and direct bilirubin.
Enzyme elevation:  A right upper quadrant ultrasound was done on [**10-31**] which revealed no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid, no biliary obstruction.
Hemolysis laboratories were negative and reticulocyte count was 4, indicating an appropriate bone marrow response to anemia.
Rectal examination was empty of stool, and therefore could not be guaiaced.
Clostridium difficile toxin was sent on his diarrhea.
His blood glucose did increase, most likely secondary to the total parenteral nutrition and insulin was added to the total parenteral nutrition.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Gastrointestinal wise, the patient would not be able to be tubed fed yet and was dependent on total parenteral nutrition which is not an ideal form of nutrition.
The patient's blood pressure and heart rate continued to decline off of the pressors, and at approximately 7:30 p.m. his monitor showed a flat line.
