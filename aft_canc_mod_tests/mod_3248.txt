EGFR testing reported L858R mutation in exon 21 on [**1-20**] by [**Company 2475**].
- received WBXRT and XRT of C7-T6 spine, completed [**2180-1-11**] .
Head CT [**2180-1-27**] (prelim): no ICH .
Lower extremity ultrasound [**2180-1-28**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
CXR [**2180-1-30**]: Increasing parenchymal opacity is seen at the right lung diffusely, particularly in the upper lobe as well as in the left lower and mid lung zones.
The heart size is not changed substantially since the prior study and there is no PTX.
CXR [**2180-2-1**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-31**], the monitoring and support devices remain in place.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2180-1-31**]):       >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):    RESULTS PENDING.
CXR demonstrated pulmonary edema likely secondary to fluids and rapid ventricular rate.
Additionally, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted on chest CT to have worsening interstitial disease secondary to malignancy progression.
As his respiratory status deteriorated, he intermittently converted back to atrial fibrillation with rates in the 150s.
Bilateral LE ultrasounds were performed, to see if patient warranted consideration of IVC filter placement, but were negative for DVT.
An TTE was done on [**2180-1-28**] to check for heart strain and revealed: mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy LVEF: >55%.
Once intubated, patient developed hypotension with BP 80/60.
Over the course of the following 24 hours, he required pressor support, initially with phenylephrine, then with additionally vasopressin, and norepinephrine titrated to a MAP of 60.
Mixed venous oxygen saturation was high, consistent with sepsis.
the patient subsequently converted to atrial fibrillation with RVR with rates into the 150s and dopamine was stopped.
His rhythm returned to sinus and his rate decreased to 110.
