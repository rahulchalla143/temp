COMPARISON: CT of the head from an outside hospital scanned into the PACS system of [**Hospital1 18**] at 10:30 on [**2129-4-1**].
CT might be considered for further workup if clinically indicated.
Chest CT recommended for further evaluation.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Final Report EXAM: CT torso obtained on [**2129-4-2**].
FINDINGS:  CT THORAX: Thyroid gland is unremarkable in appearance.
CT ABDOMEN: The liver demonstrates homogeneous post-contrast enhancement without abnormal mass identified.
CT PELVIS: Bowel loops are grossly unremarkable in appearance.
CT [**2129-4-2**] IMPRESSION:  Expected postsurgical appearance status post resection of the left frontal lobe mass.
MRI [**2129-4-2**] IMPRESSION: 1.
The lesion is superficially located and demonstrates more marked rim and central enhancement and is markedly hypercellular, accounting for its uniformly hyperdense appearance on the non-enhanced component of the CT and corresponding restricted diffusion.
MRI [**2129-4-4**]  IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head [**4-4**]  Expected postsurgical appearance status post resection of the left frontal lobe mass.
CT Neck [**4-10**] 1.
Echo [**4-11**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Once at the OSH, a head CT was performed and showed a 3cm L frontal mass.
He is to have a CT torso to r/o metastasis and MRI wand study for OR planning.
On [**4-3**], CT torso revealed a large hypoenhancing lingular mass, which appears to be invading into the pericardium as well as a large L ardenal mass.
The post op CT scan was stable.
Med onc, neuro onc and rad onc consults were obtained.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
