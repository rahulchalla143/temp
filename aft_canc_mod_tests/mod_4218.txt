This study is performed for surgical planning.
[**9-10**] Brain MRI Demonstration of moderate-sized hypointense lesion in the left frontal lobe, with few adjacent vessels around/coursing within, for surgical planning.
No hydrocephalus  [**9-10**] CT Brain Status post recent left frontal craniotomy with expected post-operative changes including fluid, small amount of blood and pneumocephalus at the resection bed, as well as extra-axial pneumocephalus.
Expected post-surgical findings including small extra-axial left frontal pneumocephalus, small amount of blood products and dural enhancement at the resection site, similar to the postsurgical CT from the day before.
Post op Head CT demonstrated no acute infarct or increase in hemorrhage.
A brain MRI post operatively was obtained which showed gross total resection.
?You will not need an MRI of the brain.
