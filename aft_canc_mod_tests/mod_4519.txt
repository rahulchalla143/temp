Pathology: [**7-13**] Flow cytometry: FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING The following tests (antibodies) were performed: CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD19, CD20, CD33, CD34, CD41, CD11c, CD56, CD64, HLA-DR, KAPPA, LAMBDA, CD71, GlycA, CD45, CD117.
These 'blasts' express CD7, CD34, CD13 (dim), CD33, CD11c(dim) and CD71.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
The white blood cell count appears decreased.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation.
Erythroid precursors are decreased and exhibit normoblastic maturation.
Special Stains: Iron stain is adequate for evaluation.
-------------------INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300 CELLS------------------- nuc ish(D5S23,D5S721,EGR1)x2[100],(D7Z1,D7S522)x2[100], (D20S108x2)[100] FISH evaluation for a 5q deletion was performed with the Vysis LSI EGR1/D5S23, D5S721 Dual Color Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for EGR1 at 5q31 and D5S721/D5S23 at 5p15.2 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
FISH evaluation for a 7q deletion was performed with the Vysis D7S522/CEP7 Dual Color Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for D7S522 at 7q31 and CEP7 (D7Z1) (chromosome 7 alpha satellite DNA) at 7p11.1-q11.1 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
FISH evaluation for a 20q deletion was performed with the Vysis LSI D20S108 Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 20q12 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
Bone marrow [**2158-7-27**]: Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate.
Scattered microcytes, echinocytes, elliptocytes, dacrocytes and red cell fragments are seen.
The white blood cell count appears markedly decreased and includes large immature myeloid forms consistent with blasts.
Lymphocytes include small mature and large reactive forms.
Differential count shows 0% neutrophils, 0% bands, 4% monocytes, 89% lymphocytes, 0% eosinophils, 7% blasts.
Differential (300 cells) shows:  72% Blasts, 2% Promyelocytes, <1% Myelocytes, <1% Metamyelocytes, <1% Bands/Neutrophils, 3% Plasma cells, 18% Lymphocytes, 5% Erythroid.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
- [**7-24**] CT Chest w/o con: 4.5-mm right lower lobe nodule.
Suggest repeat examination in six months.Multifocal subsegmental atelectasis, not obstructive.
- [**2158-7-28**] CT chest/abd/pelvis: No abnormal interstitial lung process or site of infection identified.
Limited CT examination due to respiratory artifact.
If a high clinical concern for embolus, a dedicated V/Q scan could be obtained if patient is able to tolerate as the lungs.
- [**2158-8-15**] CT abdomen/pelvis: Mild delayed right nephrogram with high-density filling defect within the posterior calices of the right upper pole, most consistent with underlying clot.
Can consider correlation with follow up CT or further evaluation with dedicated MR urogram or ureteroscopy as needed.
-[**2158-8-24**] MRI C and T spine, brachial plexus: No abnormal cervical or thoracic spine enhancement.
Limited study by motion, but grossly normal MR appearance of the brachial plexus bilaterally.
-[**2158-8-26**] CT chest w/o contrast: Redemonstration of tiny pulmonary nodules as detailed above, the largest of which is approximately 5 mm.
Would recommend repeat evaluation with a dedicated CT of the chest in approximately six months.
He underwent TTE which showed normal LVEF.
He underwent bone marrow biopsy on [**7-14**] which confirmed diagnosis of AML.
He tolerated the infusion well and his ANC fell to 0 on [**7-22**].
He was thrombocytopenic and developed gingival bleeding with PLT in the 30s and was transfused as needed.
His ANC remained 0.
Counts continued to increase and at the time of discharge pt was no longer neutropenic and WBC was 4.1.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2158-8-28**] showed no clonal cytogenetic aberrations and <5% blasts.
However, skin biopsy for a purple-pink papular rash on both forearms with biopsy was consistent with leukemia cutis.
He was pan-scanned again, and CT sinus showed sinusitis.
Coccidio, beta-glucan, galactmannan, histoplasmosis, legionella, blood fungal cultures were sent and were all eventually negative.
Patient had risen LFTs which eventually trended down.
ID was consulted again and advised to recheck beta glucan, as it may have been an erroneous result, since he was asymptomatic and had stable lesions on chest CT from [**8-26**], and also requested a mycoF/lytic culture.
# Guaiac positive stool: Patient reported hard and painful BM during induction therapy.
CT abd/pelvis showed mild R hydronephrosis and proximal-mid hydroureter on [**8-15**].
#Thrombocytopenia: pt had low platelets as expected and was transfused PRN for platelets <10.
MRI T and C spine and brachail plexus were ordered to eval for CNS spread of disease, in addition LP was done.
CXR showed no change and ECHO was obtained.
We obtained a bone marrow biopsy which showed that you had acute myelogenous leukemia.
Your cell counts dropped as expected, and you developed a fever.
We did CT scans of your sinus, chest, and abdomen to look for a source of infeciton.
You had a repeat bone marrow biopsy which still showed leukemia, so you underwent a second round of chemotherapy.
While you white blood cell counts were at their nadir, you have difficulty breathing and spiked high fevers with rigors for many days.
We did a final bone marrow biopsy which showed <5% blasts, indicating a good response.
Your creatinine was increasing (number that shows kidney function), which we think is likely due to acute interstitial nephritis (allergic reaction in your kidneys likely from medications).
