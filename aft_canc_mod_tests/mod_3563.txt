OSH CT: Informal read here shows RUL cavitary lesion with air fluid levels surrounded by lunch parenchyma.
Bronchoscopy report: PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 1.
INDICATIONS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 73270**] was seen in consultation as well as for a flexible bronchoscopy in the pulmonary procedure unit on [**2170-2-26**].
The bronchoscope was advanced down to the level of the right bronchial tree.
All the segments and subsegments of the right bronchial's were visualized in sequence.
[**MD Number(2) 73271**]    Brief Hospital Course: RUL Pneumonia: The patient was initially transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of a RUL stent to alleviate what was initially thought to be a post-obstructive pneumonia.
She rapidly improved with resolution of her hypercarbia and significant improvement in her hypoxia within 12 hours.
However, the patient did not show any signs pneumothorax on exam or CXR.
She will require close monitoring for this complication.
A BAL showed no AFB on concentrated smear, ruling out TB.
The culture returned with MSSA.
She will follow up with her PCP and oncologist and receive a repeat CT scan after completion of her antibiotic course to evaluate for possible progression of her lung cancer.
She will also return to interventional pulmonary clinic with her CT in hand for follow up of her possible bronchopleural fistula.
Her last PET/CT scan in [**12-5**] showed now growth in the tumor per the patient.
She will follow up with her oncologist and should receive a repeat CT scan after completion of her 6 week course of antibiotics.
The best course of action is to take 6 weeks of antibiotics to treat the pneumonia and then re-evaluate the lung with another CT scan.
Please bring the CD of the CT scan with you to this visit.
Please schedule a CT scan of your chest after 6wks.
Please bring the CD of your CT scan to this visit                                [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 734**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 735**] MD, [**MD Number(3) 799**]
