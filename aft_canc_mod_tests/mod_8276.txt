Chest x-ray and CT chest were performed which revealed diffuse, extensive lung disease as outlined above.
Right thoracentesis was performed which yielded 15mL serosanguinous fluid: WBC 7090, RBC 15,000 95% lymphs, glucose 189, LDH 257, tot prot 4.7.
Bronchoscopy was also performed, showing extrinsic compression of RML and possible submucosal disease.
Lavage, brushings, and EBUS-guided biopsies were performed.
Her oxygen requirements increased over the next several days.
Based on admission CXR which showed new density (infiltrate vs. effusion) at right lung base, she was started on Zosyn for pneumonia despite no clinical s/s of pneumonia.
On arrival to the MICU, vitals are: 99.3 106 120/46 23 78% 3L + 10L face tent.

Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 70 yo F with significant smoking history transferred from OSH for workup and treatment of extensive lung masses with compression of RML bronchus and lingular bronchus and post-obstructive collapse.
Active Issues: # LUNG MASSES, BRONCHIAL COMPRESSION: Patient with extensive burden of cancer on chest CT scan.
Interventional Pulmonology attempted to stent open the RML collapsed on HD#2 but were unsuccessful - thoracentesis was performed.
Pathology at OSH had shown poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma - likely of lung origin.
