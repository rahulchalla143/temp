Per husband, the patient had her last chemotherapy about 10 days ago and was feeling well one day following.
The patient underwent MRI of her T and L spine without note of cord compression at the OSH prior to transfer.
Vitals at OSH T 98--Tm 99, BP 98-120/56-82, she was on 2L NC sat 91-93%, Prior to transfer NIF -30, Vital capacity 1 Liter.
MRI T and L spine with no reported compression, ?
Family History: Father died of MI Mother died of stroke No history of other neurologic disease or malignancy  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 96.7, HR 105, BP 106/70, R 24, 94% on 40% FM Gen- ill appearing, drowsy but arouses briefly to voice, appears comfortable.
Funduscopic exam could not be performed due pt uncooperativeness with exam (pulled eyes shut forcibly).
Pertinent Results: CHEST RADIOGRAPH AP ([**2116-12-13**]): Mild cardiomegaly.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2116-12-14**]): 1.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is most sensitive for evaluation of intracranial metastatic disease.
CHEST PA/LAT ([**2116-12-16**]): In comparison with the study of [**12-14**], the patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration and the atelectatic changes at the bases have decreased.

NeuroICU course: Her neurologic examination on admission was notable for marked inattention, which further limited detailed motor and sensory testing; however, she was able to hold her legs antigravity.
Neurologic exam the morning after her admission showed [**3-2**] strength in the IPs, [**4-3**] in the deltoids and quads, and 5-/5- in all other muscle groups.
Head CT showed no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, of mass effect.
Ammonia 10, ALT 13/AST 31, LDH 489, AP 166, T bili 0.3, alb 2.5, INR 1.6, amylase 14/lipase 8, TSH 0.069, T4 6.0; free T4 0.89.
Her active issues included resolving mental status changes, ?RUL PNA (sat's 98% on 60%FM, apparently baseline O2 sat in low 90's), UTI, and climbing WBC (12) on antibiotics.
As above, the patient's weakness was thought to be secondary toxic metabolic encephalopathy; she continued to improve on antibiotics for treatment of UTI and community acquired pneumonia.
Blood cultures remained no growth to date of discharge, and patient was unable to provide sputum specimen.
Of note, patient has history of COPD with baseline sats in the low 90's.
- Anemia:  Hematocrit slightly lower than baseline on admission.
Labs consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Blood glucose should be checked at rehab facility and hypoglycemics titrated as needed.
