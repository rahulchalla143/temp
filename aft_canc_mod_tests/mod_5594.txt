TTE [**2137-4-12**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
PROCEDURES: [**2137-4-11**] CARDIAC CATH: 1.
Angioseal closure of the left femoral arteriotomy site  Brief Hospital Course: 81M with CAD (s/p PCI in [**2129**], CABG in [**2118**]), HTN, HLD, metastatic lung CA, and COPD (on home O2), with NSTEMI s/p cath found to have significant CAD.
# NSTEMI: Pt was transferred from OSH with NSTEMI and EKG revealing new Mobitz type 1 AV block.
He underwent cardiac cath on [**2137-4-11**] which revealed severe 3-vessel native coronary artery disease with several graft stenoses.
He was kept on a heparin gtt until a repeat cardiac cath on [**2137-4-16**] during which he received 4 additional stents, one stent was placed in the SVG-OM1 and three stents in the LCx.
His AV block was assumed to be due to ischemia from his NSTEMI but pt should follow-up with his cardiologist regarding Holter monitor testing for further evaluation of nodal disease.
LVEF 40%.
His BP was subsequently in the 100s, which is his baseline per the patient.
BP remained stable in 90s to 110s during hospital admission.
# DYSLIPIDEMIA: Chol 144, TG 111, HDL 72, LDL 50.
# COPD: Pt was on 3-5L home O2; oxygen saturation remained within goal on oxygen.
Upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**], Cr was 1.2 on admission.
Cr again rose, peaking at 2.0, during this admission, likely due to contrast dye load for cardiac cath and diuresis.
He was given gentle IV fluids and Cr was stable at 1.8 by time of discharge.
# ANEMIA: HCT was stable in the high 20s-low 30s; macrocytic.
