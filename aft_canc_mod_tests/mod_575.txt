CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2138-11-6**] 5:39 PM FINDINGS: AP upright radiograph was reviewed.
HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS RIGHT  [**2138-11-9**] 1:54 PM Relatively stable examination demonstrating superior and lateral subluxation of the right femoral head stable since at least [**2138-7-30**].
[**2138-11-12**]: Thyroid US THYROID ULTRASOUND: At the level of the isthmus, the right thyroid lobe measures 2.0 x 1.5 x 3.6 cm and the left lobe measures 1.9 x 2.3 x 4.3 cm.
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
[**2138-12-5**]: ECHO Conclusions: The interatrial septum is aneurysmal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2138-12-13**]: Chest CT with Contrast: FINDINGS: The number and extent of the multiple small pulmonary nodules appear stable.
[**2138-12-18**]: CT Abdomen and Pelvis: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Soft tissue window images demonstrate small bilateral pleural effusions, which are stable in comparison with most recent study.
Lung windows demonstrate multiple tiny nodules bilaterally, consistent with a miliary distribution.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Several hypodensities are seen within the spleen, which are not well defined.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A calcification is seen within the uterus consistent with a calcified fibroid.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructions were essential in delineating anatomy and pathology.
[**2138-12-25**]: Hip Film: Single AP view of the right hip.
ADDENDUM: Special stains for bacteria, fungi and AFB are negative with appropriate positive controls.
HIP Biopsy (Synovium) - PENDING  [**12-11**]: Transfusion Reaction: Negative   Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old female with sideroblastic anemia, G6PD deficiency, sickle trait, tuberculosis, who presented with hematocrit of 16 discovered on a routine lab check and low systolic blood pressure to 80.
Stool guaiac was negative and she was not taking coumadin.
In addition, the patient was completely asymptomatic with Hct of 16 suggesting slow decrease in her Hct from baseline around 25 rather than an acute drop.
Hct was the only cell line down from the baseline.
Retic count was 1.4% (uncorrected).
Her Hct remained stable until [**11-7**] when she received an additional unit for crit 23.1.
She was transfused on several occasions w/ goal to keep Hct above 21.
She was restarted on Epogen and continue on folic acid 3 grams per day, Vit B12, B6.
Bone marrow biopsy was repeated on this admission to primarily re-evaluate for presence of AFB, but this was negative for AFB and was sent for FISH, which was negative for cytogenetic abberations.
Prior to her R hip replacement, she had a pMIBI which showed a small reversible defect.
As such, it was decided to ensure that her HCT should be maintained above 30 given her propensity for ischemia.
In addition, her G6PD and MDS also necessitated closer monitoring of her HCT.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] requested a routine chest CT to be done prior to the patient's discharge, which showed an increase in number and size of pulm nodules compared with last CT on [**7-20**] and the repeat CT on this admission was read as "miliary TB" by the radiology.
The possibility of worsening chest CT findings in the setting of stopping remicade was entertained.
Following a subsequent chest CT, which showed stable disease, and with the patient still spiking daily fevers, the decision was made to perform a bronchoscopy, which was negative for organisms or malignancy or TB.
Of note, HIV testing was discussed w/ pt but the patient refused the consent.
On [**12-12**], a repeat chest CT was done which showed unchanged size of pulm nodules (now at 4 months of rx).
Diagnostic tests performed including serum aspergillus galactomannan Ag, B-glucan, histoplasma antibody and urine histoplasma antigen, CMV VL, HBV viral load, c diff, stool Oand P were all negative.
Adrenal insuff testing was inconclusive.
Multiple blood cultures including mycolitic cultures on this admission have been negative.
Two subsequent urine cultures were negative.
Thyroid nodule was aspirated and culture was negative.
On [**12-1**] - more bottles positive for coag-neg staph; started 2 week course for presumed line-related bacteremia (although line tip negative) with vanco.
To evaluate a potential oncologic contribution to the fevers/eosinophilia, Heme/Onc repeated the bone marrow biopsy which was consistent with her known diagnosis of MDS and AFB stain was negative.
Rheumatology was consulted and synovial biopsy was suggested for definitive diagnosis.
This was discussed with her and a plan was made to ensure that she would be agressively treated to ensure that her Hct did not drop below 30 or become hypotensive, with an eye towards maintaining adequate perfusion to her heart.
It was estimated that there was 1L of blood loss.
Her BP did not deviate below 90 during the operation.
The synovial and bone biopsies were negative for AFB and did not demonstrate any signs of TB.
Blood cultures drawn on [**11-9**] grew coagulase negative staph.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was negative for endocarditis.
A transesophageal echocardiogram did not show evidence of endocarditis.
# Cough: Pt w/ cough and productive sputum of unclear etiology, has been receiving active TB treatment and CXR on admission was otherwise clear except for some mild b/l effusions.
Original sputum cultures were negative for AFB smears x 3 and w/ only rare GNR growth.
Another sputum sent approx 7 days later, again only showing rare GNR growth.
Approx a 2 week f/u CXR showed slightly more profuse pulmonary nodularity and a new small right pleural effusion and a 2 week f/u Chest CT was read as improvement in pulm nodules but both ID and Pulm felt was unchanged.
CT also showed some heterogeneity in the left lobe of the thyroid gland (present on CT back in [**2138-7-15**]).
Thyroid function tests were normal.
A thyroid biopsy was performed that was non-diagnosistic due to insufficient cellular material but was had many hemosiderin-laden macrophages consistent with cyst contents.
Aspirate was sent for culture and AFB both of which have been negative.
Bilateral PE in [**2134**] on 1 + years of anticoagulation with coumadin.
Given massive PEs the plan was to continue life-long anticoagulation with goal INR 1.5-1.9 Coumadin had been held on last admit, for unclear reasons.
Post op, her hcts were checked and maintained above 30 and troponins were flat post operatively.
EKG did not show any ischemic changes.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**12-16**] Sprays Nasal TID (3 times a day) as needed.
You must have your labs, including CBC, Chem 10, and liver function tests checked every day at the rehab hospital because of your new tuberculosis medications.
