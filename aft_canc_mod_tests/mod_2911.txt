As pt was subtherapuetic on coumadin, he was sent for CT angio to r/o PE.
When he returned from CT scanner, was tachypneic to 40s, hypoxic to 90s on NRB, BP in 240s.
Was transiently placed on a NTG gtt, and BP dropped into 170s.
Chest CT showed multifocal PNA.
Initial ABG 7.29/57/173 on NRB, lactate 1.5.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt rec'd NS x2L, ceftazidime 2g IVx1, vancomycin 1g IVx1, albuterol nebs x2, robitussin with codeine, tylenol 1g, NTG gtt.
Past Medical History: Bladder cancer- originally diagnosed [**2160**] and treated with   conservative mgmt, recurred in [**2181**] in NY, s/p chemo/XRT, s/p   intravesical BCG/IFN x6 completed [**4-29**], recurrent tumors on   cystoscopy, s/p transurethral resection [**12-29**] Peptic ulcer disease DVT- [**2183**] DVT occured spontaneously, DVT 35y ago in postop setting   (varicose vein stripping),on coumadin since [**2183**] CRI- etiology unclear, baseline creatinine 1.3-1.5 spinal stenosis (low back pain and B LE pain) left hernia repair.
CXR [**2185-2-10**]: Multifocal pulmonary opacities in the right mid and both lower lung regions show interval improvement with residual confluent opacity most prominent in the right middle lobe.
TTE [**2185-2-10**]: Normal EF, No valvular disease .
CXR [**2185-2-9**]: 1.Improving right middle lobe airspace opacity likely representing resolving pneumonia.
Further characterization of this finding with repeat PA and lateral chest radiographs is recommended following resolution of the right middle lobe consolidation.
CT angio [**2185-2-9**]: Multifocal PNA, cannot see PE but limited exam (patient movement) .
Micro: BlCx x2: 1/4 bottles w/Coag Negative Staph Negative for Influenza A and B   Brief Hospital Course: 87M with recent PNA on levofloxacin, now with worsening multifocal pneumonia.
had episode of respiratory difficulty overnight requiring numerous interventions including lasix (although CXR afterwards showed no signs of CHF), albuterol nebs, nitro for afterload reduction, and finally BiPAP .
The patient was started on Zosyn/Vanco to cover broadly given progression of symptoms and radiographic appearance of PNA as well as Azithromycin to cover atypicals.
The patient had a second episode of respiratory distress with RR 40s and was given bipap with improvement of rr 20-30.
A TTE perfomed showed no evidence of valvular disease with EF > 55%.
His CTA showed multifocal pneumonia but no evidence of PE (although it was somewhat limited study due to patient motion).
Additionally, the patient was found to have significant wheezing on exam thought to be consistent with a component of COPD/reactive airways disease.
Upon discharge, he was requiring 2-3L Nasal cannula to maintain saturation of 96%.
On room air, the patient's oxygen saturation was 90%.
He was transiently put on a nitro gtt which improved his SBPs to 160s-170s and was transitioned to isosorbide DN and metoprolol after it was clear that he was no longer septic.
# Anemia: Patient found to have new anemia with Hct 30-32.
Stool guiacs x 2 were negative.
Hemolysis labs were sent with no evidence of hemolysis.
# Bladder Ca - Patient was found to have recurrent bladder cancer on a recent cystoscopy.
The patient will need further followup as an outpatient with his urologic oncologist.
The patient's baseline Cr ranges between 1.3-1.6. .
Upon discharge, his INR was 2.2 and heparin gtt was no longer needed.
Goal INR 2.0-3.0 .
DVT [**2183**], on coumadin 4.
CKD - basline Cr 1.3-1.5 5. spinal stenosis 6.
Please return to the hospital for symptoms of worsening dyspnea, chest pain, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, or any other concerning symptoms  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
