Equivocal densities scattered through out both lungs need further evaluation by nonurgent chest CT.  CT Abd/Pelvis:  Innumerable nodules measuring up to 13 mm in diameter are seen in the imaged portion of the lung bases.
These are located in the omentum anteriorly (2:27), in the lesser sac (2:27), adjacent to the spleen and along the left lateral peritoneum (2:27, 21), and throughout the mesenteric root (2:45).
CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A heterogeneous centrally hypodense mass spans the width of the lower abdomen and pelvis, tethering the terminal ileum and cecum as well as the sigmoid colon, and is contiguous with the uterus and adnexa.
Her INR was significantly elevated at presentation, which was felt to be contributing significantly to her bleeding.
Her INR was reversed with 2 units of FFP and 10mg of Vitamin K. She was initially monitored in the ICU but remained hemodynamically stable and required no blood transfusions with a stable hematocrit after INR reversal.
She was transferred to the floor and underwent a colonoscopy after an uneventful prep.
It was unclear if this was an instrinsic vs. an extrinsic colonic mass pressing in so she underwent a CT of her abd/pelvis.
Her hematocrit remained stable througout her admission with no further bleeding  Abdominal malignancy: As noted above, the patient was found to have what appears to be diffuse metastatic disease throughout her abdomen and lower lungs.
Initial biopsies from the colonoscopy returned as normal tissue, not surprising given the mass was only extrinsically compressing the colon.
An EGD was performed which was entirely normal, indicating that the gastric mass seen on CT was likely extraluminal.
