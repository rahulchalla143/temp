Compared to the prior study, the lung volumes are lower and the left hemidiaphragm is more obscured.

Differential diagnoses included dehydration, seizures, hyperglycemia, worsened malignancy, or infection.
She did not have witnessed seizures and her EEG was negative.
Head CT showed no change from prior scans, making worsening of malignancy less likely.
During hospital course, to r/o infectious causes, LP, blood cultures, urine cultures, and chest X-ray were preformeed, which were negative.
Anion Gap Acidosis with Elevated Lactate:  Patient intially had anion gap of 20, lactate 8.6, and elevated blood glucose.
However, patient's blood sugar kept under control with HISS (spent short time on Insulin gtt), and lactate improved with hydration.
Lactate came down to 2.0 and anion gap to 10 on [**2144-8-18**].
This resolved spontaneously, and her anion gap was 10 on day of discharge.
Abdominal CT ruled out bowel ischemia.
Also infection was on differential but workup was negative (as mentioned above) and patient did not look septic clinically.
Urine electrolytes checked to r/o diabetes insipidus and they were normal (as was serum sodium).
Blood pressure remained within normal limits, and patient was monitored.
Dropping HCT: HCT on [**8-21**] was 27.3 (low of 27 on [**8-20**] and 31.5 on admission [**8-14**]).
Stool guiac was negative.
Hct dropped after port placement to 24.9, and pt was continued on erythropoietin per recommendation of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].
She was placed on insulin gtt, and then HISS and qhs glargine with improvement of blood sugars.
Her sugars were well-controlled after that throughout the remainder of her stay.
Followup Instructions: MRI  Please make an appointment with your primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-28**] weeks for a follow up appointment.
