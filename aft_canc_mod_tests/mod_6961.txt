No clear infectious source to suggest a septic picture (normal WBC, nml CXR, nml UA, effusion on exam but exam not c/w a septic joint).
No hx of bleeding and HCT is stable from previously documented baseline.
EKG findings is concerning for cardiac etiology namely effusion with possible tamponade however reassuringly there is no evidence of JVD or cardiomegaly on CXR.
Bedside echo was without significant effusion.
CXR revealed worsening bilateral pleural effusions.
Blood and urine cultures were sent and patient emperically started on vanc/zosyn.
A left thoracentesis was attempted, but patient blood pressure dropped to the 70s.
Patient's blood pressures remained low despite support with levophed, phenylephrine, and vasopressin.
Further diagnostic procedures were deferred due to patient instability.
Wt loss is certainly concerning for possible malignancy, immunsuppression or TB given findings on CT chest.
Patient refused NGT and he was started on TPN on [**2147-12-9**] and patient tolerated it well.
A PPD was placed and read negative on [**2147-12-8**], quantiferon levels were sent and were indeterminate (patient did not mount a response to positive control), and sputum cultures were sent for AFB x3 which were all negative.
Concern for possible immunosupression: HIV negative, HIV viral load and T cell subsets were sent which were negative.
CT abdomen showed a hypoattenuating mass at the head of the pancreas, which was suspcious for possible gastrinoma.
However, gastrin level was sent and returned normal.
#) Hypothyroidism: diagnosed in [**2146**], but etiology is unclear as his antibodies were negative and a CT chest revealed a normal thyroid.
Elevated ferritin with high transferrin saturations concerning for hemochromatosis.
# ETOH abuse- Pt still actively drinking.
He was monitored on a CIWA without any administration of BZDs.
