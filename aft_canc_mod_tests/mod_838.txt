He was scheduled for the pacemaker ICD placement in effort to enhance synchrony of his cardiac function and to capture an element of atrial kick, as well.
Initially he had been monitored on the floor, but blood pressures were 60s/30s despite Dopamine.
His hematocrit trended from mid 30s to 27.4, and he was started on one unit packed red cells and admitted to the CCU.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 30%.
Vitals:  Temperature 97.7, blood pressure 114/80 on 5 mcg of Dopamine, pulse 92, 98% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
LABORATORY DATA:  Significant for hematocrit 34 dropping to 30 dropping to 27.4 on admission.
Creatinine of 1.4, INR of 1.4.
Electrophysiology adjusted parameters and turned down single output as was pacing diaphragm.
Blood pressure:  Patient had hypovolemia likely secondary to blood/volume loss and was transfused two units packed red cells initially.
He was gradually weaned off Dopamine after a day and his blood pressure stabilized.
Congestive heart failure:  Patient was aggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix after his blood pressure normalized given his chest x-ray is concerning for congestive heart failure.
Chest x-ray repeated after diuresis showed improvement with decrease in infiltrates bilaterally.
Patient has appointment for Electrophysiology Clinic follow up to check pacer and INR on [**2123-3-30**] at 10 a.m. 2.
