A heaad CT at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital that same day showed left frontal edema.
She was then transfered to [**Hospital1 756**] and Woman's Hospital where a stereotactic brain biopsy was performed; but pathology was non-diagnostic.
An MRI at that time at [**Hospital1 756**] and Woman's showed left basal ganglia and left frontal enhancement.
Toxoplasmosis serologies were reportedly negative during this span.
She had a positive FDG-PET scan and a CT scan showing a 1.5 cm x 2.6 cm hyperdense lesion in the left frontal/basal ganglia region with extensive surrounding edema, 10 mm midline shift, and slight effacement of the left suprasellar cistern indicate possibly early uncal herniation.
She underwent a second biopsy on [**2197-6-2**], the prelimary pathology from which was reportedly most consistent with CNS lymphoma.
The gram stain from the biopsy was negative for PMNs or organisms.

IMAGING: [**2197-5-31**] CT head - 1.
Hyperdense lesion measuring 1.5 x 2.6 cm in the left frontal/basal ganglia region with extensive surrounding edema.
[**2197-6-1**] MR head - 1.
[**2197-6-4**] CT head - No significant change in the degree of mass effect or herniation secondary to a hyperattenuating lesion involving the left putamen and globus pallidus.
[**2197-6-10**] CT head - 1.
CXR [**2197-6-10**] - In comparison with the study of [**6-9**], there is little overall change.
The cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits and there is only mild prominence of pulmonary vessels consistent with a slight elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
ECG [**2197-6-12**] - Sinus rhythm Short P-R interval Possible inferior infarct - age undetermined Clinical correlation is suggested No previous tracing available for comparison  Laboratory values upon discharge: [**2197-6-12**] 05:00AM BLOOD WBC-15.5* RBC-4.03* Hgb-12.8 Hct-36.1 MCV-90 MCH-31.7 MCHC-35.4* RDW-13.0 Plt Ct-256 [**2197-6-13**] 12:01AM BLOOD WBC-18.9* RBC-3.97* Hgb-12.5 Hct-35.6* MCV-90 MCH-31.5 MCHC-35.2* RDW-13.3 Plt Ct-261 [**2197-6-13**] 06:45AM BLOOD WBC-17.0* RBC-3.91* Hgb-12.5 Hct-35.1* MCV-90 MCH-31.9 MCHC-35.6* RDW-13.2 Plt Ct-213 [**2197-6-10**] 04:37AM BLOOD Neuts-92* Bands-0 Lymphs-5* Monos-3 Eos-0 Baso-0 Atyps-0 Metas-0 Myelos-0 [**2197-6-13**] 06:45AM BLOOD Neuts-91* Bands-1 Lymphs-0 Monos-2 Eos-0 Baso-0 Atyps-3* Metas-3* Myelos-0 [**2197-6-13**] 06:45AM BLOOD Neuts-91* Bands-1 Lymphs-0 Monos-2 Eos-0 Baso-0 Atyps-3* Metas-3* Myelos-0 [**2197-6-13**] 12:01AM BLOOD PT-13.3 PTT-27.3 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2197-6-12**] 05:00AM BLOOD Glucose-186* UreaN-33* Creat-0.6 Na-133 K-4.3 Cl-101 HCO3-22 AnGap-14 [**2197-6-13**] 12:01AM BLOOD Glucose-154* UreaN-28* Creat-0.5 Na-132* K-4.0 Cl-99 HCO3-24 AnGap-13 [**2197-6-13**] 06:45AM BLOOD Glucose-148* UreaN-28* Creat-0.6 Na-135 K-4.3 Cl-99 HCO3-28 AnGap-12 [**2197-6-8**] 03:27AM BLOOD ALT-69* AST-16 AlkPhos-62 TotBili-0.5 [**2197-6-13**] 06:45AM BLOOD Calcium-9.8 Phos-2.4* Mg-2.4 [**2197-6-13**] 06:45AM BLOOD Osmolal-295  Brief Hospital Course: 1.
CNS Lymphoma: This was diagnosed by brain biopsy on [**2197-6-2**], HIV and toxoplasma staining were negative.
Initial CT scan with mass, shift, edema and possible early herniation.
While in the ICU patient was patient was found to have coagulase negative staphylococcus in her blood and started on vancomycin (see below).
Her last head CT done on [**2197-6-10**] demonstrated improvement in mass effect and decreased midline shift, with unchanged left uncal herniation.

Upon your arrival here, you had a brain biopsy (brain test) that showed that you have a cancer called brain lymphoma.
Because of the brain swelling, you were admitted to our intensive care unit, where you were monitored and your brain swelling was treated.
During your stay, you were also suspected to to have a blood infection, for which you are being treated with antibiotic (Vancomycin).
