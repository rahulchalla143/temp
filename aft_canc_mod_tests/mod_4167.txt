Labs were significant forplatelets of 6, WBC of 1, Hct 23.1, and tbili of 2.2.
CT of the head was significant for bilateral subdural hematomas with a midline shift.
[**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
An echocardiogram done on [**7-8**] was notable for an EF of 20%.

She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
A subsequent ECHO showed 20% dilated cardiomyopathy.
# Subdural hematoma, stable The patient was placed on neurological checks every 4 hours.
Her physical exams consistently demonstrated no neurological deficits.
The goal for platelets was 50,000.
After three units of platelets on the medicine floor, she finally obtained a platelet count of 50,000.
The patient underwent repeat CT scan on [**2166-7-16**] to evaluate for interval change of her subdural hematoma, and this showed no interval worsening of her subdural hematoma.
The initial read showed that the subdural had increased from 5mm to 7mm; however, there was no evidence of new bleeding with interval evolution of blood products.
# Dilated cardiomyopathy The patient consistently appeared euvolemic to physical exam and had, at most, minimal crackles on lung exam.
