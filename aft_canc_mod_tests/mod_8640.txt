As per ICU Admission Note, the pt's oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**], was reportedly contact[**Name (NI) **] and advised against further acute work-up for PE given the pt's recent negative CTA and similar presentations in the past.

Pertinent Results: Admission labs:  [**2120-3-25**] 05:40PM   WBC-3.7* RBC-3.52* HGB-10.8* HCT-33.0* MCV-94 MCH-30.7 MCHC-32.8 RDW-17.8* [**2120-3-25**] 05:40PM   NEUTS-78.4* LYMPHS-18.8 MONOS-1.6* EOS-0.8 BASOS-0.4 [**2120-3-25**] 05:40PM   GLUCOSE-101 UREA N-22* CREAT-0.5 SODIUM-137 POTASSIUM-3.8 CHLORIDE-107 TOTAL CO2-23 ANION GAP-11  [**3-26**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**3-25**], there is continued opacification in the retrocardiac region with obliteration of the left hemidiaphragm.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-9-7**], aortic root and ascending aorta are larger (although root was undermeasured on prior study).
Other considerations would still include pulmonary embolus, interstitial lung disease, CHF or pneumonia, however these appear less likely explainations given the reproducibility of symptoms.
She had an echo that was unable to visualize an ASD or PFO and did not demonstrated any elevated R atrial pressures or pulmonary hypertension.
# Pain: The patient reported abdominal pain, related to abdominal distention and paracentesis.
# GI bleed:  On [**3-28**], the patient had an episode of hematemesis, was tachycardic to 130s, and had a large melanotic stool.
