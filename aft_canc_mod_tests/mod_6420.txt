MRI Head without and with IV contrast ecommended for further evaluation.
CT Head [**7-20**](Post-op): FINDINGS: The patient is post-resection of a larger left frontal mass, with trace hemorrhage in the surgical bed.
The paranasal sinuses remain clear, with the exception of opacification of a few right mastoid air cells and a retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.
MRI Head [**7-21**](Post-op); MRI BRAIN WITH CONTRAST There is a large amount of pneumocephalus.
The smaller lesion noted within the posterior left parietal lobe with hemorrhagic component is unchanged and measures approximately 13 x 14 mm, currently.
A suspicious more punctate focus within the right frontal lobe is less conspicuous on today's exam (series 10, image 18).
The remaining brain parenchyma is unchanged in appearance with no region of acute infarction.
No definite foci suspicious for residual tumor are identified, though evaluation of the superior and posterior aspect of the resection cavity, is somewhat limited by the blood products at this site.
Head CT done and showed two intracranial masses.
Frozen pathology analysis revealed findings consistent with metastatic melanoma.
Post-op MRI revealed gross total resection of the left frontal lesion.
Labs were sent(including liver and pancreatic enzymes) and revealed a mild pancreatitis with [**Doctor First Name **]/Lip in 400s.
RUQ ultrasound was done, and was negative for obstructive source.
The patient's post-operative examination was notable for decreased spatial sensation of his RUE.
?You will need an MRI of the brain prior to you appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]; This will occur on.
