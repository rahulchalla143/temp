Patient brought to CT at 22:00 which revealed large Right temporal bleed with uncal herniation and also small lesion in Right frontal, Right cerebellum, and Right occipital regions.
CT chest revealed hilar mass.

CT PELVIS and CT Abdomen [**2159-3-2**] 4:13 PM CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Multiple nodules are demonstrated in both lung bases measuring up to 24 x 11 mm.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Foley catheter is seen within the bladder which contains air within it.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2159-3-2**] 5:44 PM CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient for postoperative MRI following evacuation of right-sided hematoma and evidence of multiple metastasis.
TECHNIQUE: T1 axial, sagittal and coronal images of the brain were obtained following gadolinium.
MP-RAGE axial images were also acquired.
A faint enhancement is also identified in the left temporal lobe anteriorly which is suggestive of an additional metastasis.
NOTE: Intermixed within the blood clot are frequent small clusters of highly malignant cells having large nuclei, a prominent nucleolus, and fine cytoplasmic pigment.
Intraoperatively, the frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] reads: "Right temporal lobe tissue:     Pigmented malignant epithelioid cell aggregate present within blood clot.
Part 2 is additionally labeled "right temporal lobe tumor" and consists of an aggregate of red brown blood clot with scant fragment of tan tissue, measuring 4.1 x 3.4 x 0.9 cm.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 72376**] was emergently taken to the CT scanner after being evaluated by the neurology stroke team.
The head CT showed a large right sided temporal hemorrhage, measuring approximately 5 x 5 cm with uncal herniation, incipient midline shift, transfalcine herniation.
Oncology was consulted because the pathology from the brain mass came back metastatic melanoma.
Their recommendations was CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis for metastatic workup, possible role of temodar, and derm consult to look for primary lesion on the skin.
The derm consult they recommended a biopsy of the a lesion on the foot which turned out to be a dyplastic nevus and to get any old records of his possible history of melanoma.
On POD 1 he failed bedside swallow evaluation so a dobhoff was placed and he was started on tubefeeds.
