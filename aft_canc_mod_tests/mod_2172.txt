Neuro exam was nonfocal, and pt had no focal or midline spinal tenderness.
CTA of torso revealed obstructing bladder mass with hydronephrosis and hydroureter, lytic T6 lesions extending posteriorly into spinal canal, L3 compression fracture, and other mottled appearing cervical vertebrae concerning for metastatic disease.
Spine was consulted and recommended MRI for further characterization of vertebral lesions and spinal cord pathology.
MRI was ordered but pt was transferred to floor prior to MRI, given delay.
VS prior to transfer were 89 174/80 18 97%RA.
VS - Temp 98.0F, BP 190/92, HR 93, R 19, O2-sat 95% RA, [**9-16**] pain, 48.7 kg GENERAL - Thin elderly woman appears alert and interactive but depressed, NAD HEENT - anisocoria with R > L pupillary dilation.
No midline tenderness, scoliosis or kyphosis ABDOMEN - NABS, soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM RECTAL - Normal sphincter tone EXTREMITIES - thin, WWP, no c/c/e, 2+ peripheral pulses SKIN - no rashes or lesions NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**4-11**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout, patellar and achilles DTRs are 2+ and symmetric, cerebellar exam intact, gait assessment deferred due to pain .

MICROBIOLOGIC DATA: [**2172-2-11**] Urine culture - coagulase negative Staphylococcus [**2172-2-11**] Blood culture (x 2) - no growth [**2172-2-14**] Urine culture - no growth [**2172-2-20**] MRSA screening - negative [**2172-2-20**] Blood culture (x 2) ??????

no growth [**2172-2-26**] Blood culture x2 - NGTD .
IMAGING STUDIES: [**2172-2-12**] MR CERVICAL, THORACIC, LUMBAR SPINE W/O C - Extensive bone marrow changes of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine as detailed above, representing osseous metastatic disease.
[**2172-2-16**] MR PELVIS W&W/O CONTRAS - Urinary catheter is noted within the bladder with thrombus identified in relation to the right ureteric orifice.
[**2172-2-18**] CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRA - No evidence of metastatic lesions to the brain or bones.
MRI would be more accurate in identifying metastatic lesions if not contraindicated.
[**2172-2-20**] CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON - Right hydroureter and hydronephrosis, with hyperdense material distending the right renal pelvis, ureter and the bladder, compatible with hemorrhage.
[**2172-2-23**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in severity of the pre-existing pulmonary edema.
Underwent transvaginal biopsy which showed urothelial carcinoma.
She responded to Lasix diuresis and her oxygenation improved.
Her infection concerns were treated, her metabolic derangements were addressed and we felt her pain control and ICU delirium was most likely contributing.
A CT of the torso revealed an obstructing bladder mass with mets throughout the lumbar, thoracic and cervical spine.
Urology was consulted and she underwent a cystoscopy on [**2-15**] which showed an extravesicular mass, pushing into the right ureter and bladder.
An MRI showed that the mass was actually periureteral.
She underwent a transvaginal ultrasound guided IR biopsy on [**2-19**].
On [**2-20**], her Hct dropped from 28->18 and her stomach became tense and distended.
She was discovered on CT torso to have diffuse mets to the spine.
# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: Creatinine bumped on [**2-20**] from baseline 0.9 up to 1.6.
She was given IV fluids initially and her creatinine improved to baseline.
Following resuscitation, her creatinine remained stable in the setting of diuresis needs.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was asymptomatic but was treated for 7 days with ceftriaxone then dicloxacillin for urine culture showing staph epi.
