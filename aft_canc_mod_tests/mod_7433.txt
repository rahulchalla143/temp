Of note, he had a recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**3-12**] for acute on chronic renal failure at which time he was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy and started on HD.
On arrival to the ED, vitals were 98.6, 112, 80/42, RR 20, 100% on RA.
His blood pressure subsequently dropped to 69/39.
An EKG after the episodes demonstrated sinus tachycardia with T wave flattening throughout the precordium, no ST segment changes.
1st set of enzymes with troponin elevation, though normal CK.
Past Medical History: 1) Hypertension 2) Biventricular CHF: Last echo [**3-12**].
LVEF 40%, with RV systolic function mildly depressed as well.
Physical Exam: T 95.4, BP 60/22, HR 68, RR 15, 100% on RA.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at L base and dullness to percussion.

[**2142-6-7**] 02:39AM STOOL CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN B ASSAY-DETECTED  Brief Hospital Course: 1) Hypotension: On admission, there was clinical concern for sepsis given hypotension, leukocytosis, and hypothermia.
However, cultures remained negative, and he responded promptly to aggressive fluid resuscitation.
He was given IVF boluses to maintain a MAP > 55.
A cosyntropin stimulation test was normal.
He was started on empiric metronidazole on admission and stool samples sent for C Diff toxin assay.
Toxin A assays returned negative x 3, and toxin B assay was sent.
His diarrhea improved somewhat with empiric metronidazole therapy, but continued to persist.
C Diff tox B assay returned positive the day prior to discharge.
5) Atrial tachycardia:  He had intermittent atrial tachycardia during his hospitalization, with a rate of around 100.
His outpatient regimen of low dose metoprolol was resumed prior to discharge.
6) IgA nephropathy/ESRD:  Dialysis was held for a number of days after admission as his electrolytes continued to remain within normal limits and he was not fluid overloaded even after aggressive fluid resuscitation.
Dialysis was eventually resumed, with last session prior to discharge on [**6-14**].
Phosphate binders were held as his phosphate was low.
A cortisol level was checked to rule out Addison's Disease, which was normal.
His thrombocytopenia was felt secondary to medications (though unclear which ones), and nadired at 51.
He was severely hemoconcentrated on admission with a hematocrit > 40, dropping to 30 the following day after aggressive IVF hydration.
His hematocrit subsequently remained at around 33, which is near his baseline.
After a repeat swallow evaluation with video swallow study, he was advanced to thin liquids, but maintained on pureed solids.
2) Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Fluid Restriction: 1.5L 3) Follow up as directed below.
4) Call if you have worsened diarrhea, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, fevers, or any other concerns.
