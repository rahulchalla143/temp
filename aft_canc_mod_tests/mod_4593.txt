He was taken to [**Hospital 6136**] Hospital; and then taken by [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 18**] after a CT showed extensive acute ICH.
An EKG there showed sinus rhythm, with an S in I and a Q in III, with prominent upright T waves in precordial leads and no indication of ischemia.
Of note, his INR was 3.7 on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] consistent with coumadin taken regularly at home for known PE in [**2179-12-30**].
Past Medical History: Stage IV lung cancer with brain metastases diagnosed [**9-5**] after episode of seizures, s/p R craniectomy [**9-5**] for tumor resection, s/p chemo/radiation; oncologist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1528**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Hospital1 6136**]), rad onc [**Location (un) **] ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **]); per daughter, little effect of chemo/rads, oncologist said emphasis should be on quality of life at this point PE diagnosed in [**1-7**] (on coumadin), diagnosed by routine CT scan, was evidently asymptomatic at that time Hyperlipidemia NIDDM GERD Bipolar disorder diagnosed in [**2174**] after a psych hospitalization for mania, has been on several meds; stopped meds and was rehospitalized; since then has been on seroquel alone Seizure disorder secondary to brain mets only .
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM on admission: O: T:97.0  BP:129/6/   HR:102   RR:16  O2Sats 96% Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
CT OSH(1227 [**8-17**]): "extensive acute ICH identified which all appears to be extra-xial and is most prominent superficial to the anterior left frontal lobe, but there is less extensive acute ICH along the right anterolateral aspect of the suprasellar cistern, right side of the anterior cranial fossa, left ambient cistern, along the adjacent left tentorium cerebelli, and along the sulcus posterior right frontal lobe".
CT/CTA([**Hospital1 18**]): Left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural blood measuring up to 6mm and layering along the falx.
Repeat CTA [**2180-8-19**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Echo ([**2180-8-25**]): Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %) secondary to inferior posterior hypokinesis Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Video Oropharyngeal Swallow ([**2180-8-25**]): No gross aspiration or penetration.
Labs: [**2180-8-17**] 05:51PM   GLUCOSE-176* UREA N-10 CREAT-0.7 SODIUM-143 POTASSIUM-3.9 CHLORIDE-103 TOTAL CO2-29 ANION GAP-15 [**2180-8-17**] 05:51PM   CALCIUM-9.3 PHOSPHATE-3.4 MAGNESIUM-1.9 [**2180-8-17**] 05:51PM   WBC-9.7 RBC-3.67* HGB-9.4* HCT-30.7* MCV-84 MCH-25.7* MCHC-30.6* RDW-14.8 [**2180-8-17**] 05:51PM   PLT COUNT-252 [**2180-8-17**] 05:51PM   PT-16.5* PTT-20.4* INR(PT)-1.5*  Brief Hospital Course: 60 year old Portugese speaking gentleman found down and taken to outside hospital where CT scan revealed left frontal tentorial cistern acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage.
He was intubated for a GCS of 7  at arrival and recieved profiline and FFP in ED.
On [**8-21**], a repeat head CT scan showed a stable intra-cranial bleed.
Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient's intracranial bleed was stable on head CTs on [**8-21**] and [**8-23**].
The patient had cardiac enzymes negative x3.
He had an echo with above results.
As his coumadin had to be discontinued, the patient had an IVC filter placed while admitted.
TSH was normal.
The patient had a chest CT, showing 8 cm mass of the left lower lobe growing into the left main stem bronchus and associated with complete collapse of the left lower lobe.
This mass may contribute to future respiratory compromise via obstruction or subsequent pneumonia--however, the patient remained stable from a respiratory stand-point throughout his hospitalization, with 02 saturations >95% on room air and without respiratory distress.
Although he had no obvious source, with a negative UA and indeterminate CXR showing extensive left lung collapse and effusion, the patient was begun on coverage for ventilator associated pneumonia with IV Cefepime, Vanc, and Flagyl, given his increased risk from recent intubation.
Blood and urine cultures were pending at discharge.
His blood sugar control can be further titrated at rehab.
Hypertension: The patient's systolic blood pressure should be kept <180 per neurosurgery recommedation.
This was achieved with Metoprolol 12.5mg TID, with the patient's blood pressure ranging from 114-132/60-80 on day of discharge.
He had a video swallow which showed no aspiration.
