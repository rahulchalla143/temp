Admission Date: [**2188-3-24**]        Discharge Date: [**2188-4-3**]   Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old male who had a recent colonoscopy showing a benign polyp at the splenic flexure.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 62, blood pressure 119/60, and 97 percent saturation on room air.
EXTREMITIES: Peripheral pulses 2+, no edema.
The pathology later came back as adenocarcinoma (low grade, well differentiated) invading the submucosa only.
An epidural was placed and afterwards the INR was found to be 1.7.
Repeated neurological exams on the patient showed that his neurological function remained intact despite the elevated INR.
The patient also received 1 unit of packed red blood cells bringing his hematocrit up from 26.2 to 27.8.
The patient was noted to have a postop fever to 101.2 degrees, which was likely secondary to atelectasis since it was within a day of the operation.
However, he woke in the middle of the night with some nausea and a repeat bradycardia down to 38.
His INR dropped to 1.2 after receiving the 4 units of FFP.
His hematocrit was 27.6.
Because of his cardiac condition, he was given 1 unit packed red blood cells raising his hematocrit up to 31.6, 22 that morning.
He was started on his home dose of warfarin and was ultimately discharged on his home dose with his INR up to 1.3 the day prior to discharge.
