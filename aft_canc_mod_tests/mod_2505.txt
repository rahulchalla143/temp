Abdominal CT showed bilateral renal masses:  Left kidney mass 7 cm, exocytic, lower pole and Right kidney mass 2.6 cm, w/ infarcted tissue in upper mid left kidney.
A renal ultrasound showed a solid 2.6 cm mass on right, and a complex cystic 7 cm mass on the left.
An urinalysis showed microscopic hematuria.
Pt underwent a core biopsy of Left renal mass x2.

His platelet count dropped during the time of his transfer, presumably from HIT although the one assay performed here was negative.
The pathology report from [**Hospital6 **] revealed Renal Cell Carcinoma.
A metastatic work-up with Head CT, Chest CT, Abd-Pelvic CT, and Bone scan was negative except for an adrenal mass whose density was not consistent with benign adenoma.
Cardiac clearance was obtained with a combination of studies from [**Hospital1 18**] and [**Hospital **]; an echo here showed EF 20-30% and he was maintained on beta-blocker.
He did develop LUE swelling but U/S and CT were negative for DVT.
He underwent a bowel prep on the day prior to surgery.
On POD 2 the chest tube was removed, CXR showed minimal PTX.
His HCT remained low and he received a 2nd Unit of PRBCs.
His INR was closely checked throughout his post-operative course with dosage decreased during immediate post-op period (Inr 2.8-3.2); it rose to 3.8 and 3.9 with dosage decreased.
After beginning PO intake, the INR dropped significantly to 3.4 then 2.1 over 12 hours and then 1.5.
Follow-up with Primary Care Physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 2 days to discuss INR and coumadin dosing.
Have INR checked twice daily until coumadin dose is settled with your PCP.
