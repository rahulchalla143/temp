CXR [**2150-4-6**]: 1.
ECHO [**2150-4-6**]: The left atrium is dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-7-17**], mitral regurgitation appears similar, aortic valve gradient is similar (valve area was underestimated in the prior report), estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower, left ventricular ejection fraction appears similar although today's images are technically suboptimal.
CHEST CT [**2150-4-7**]: 1.
CXR [**2150-4-7**]: In comparison with study of [**4-6**], the opacification at the left base is somewhat less.
CXR [**2150-4-9**]: No significant interval change with consolidation at the left greater than right base consistent with known pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 100985**] is a very nice 73 YO gentleman with NHL (C3D17) on Bendemustine (last dose [**2150-3-25**]), ESRD on HD, who presented with fever and LLL infiltrate on CXR and CT.  Also hypotensive on pressors in the MICU with concerns for pneumosepsis.
He was able to maintain remarkably clear sensorium and remained symptoms free even when his blood pressures dipped into 70s systolic.
Her MRSA screen was negative.
Echo from [**2150-4-6**] is not markedly changed from prior but [**Last Name (un) 22975**] EF of 35% and 3+ MR as well as AS with [**Location (un) 109**] of 1.0cm.
His phosphate binders were continued, he was put on [**Last Name (STitle) **] diet and required extra HD sessions for fluid management.
- hold glipizide, HISS, monitor sugars .
He was put on neutropenic precautions and his counts were trended.
He had HD and his rate was controlled with his coreg.
You were found to have a pneumonia on chest x-ray and CT scan and were started on antibiotics.
You needed to be transfered to the ICU, because problems with your blood pressure.
While your blood pressure was low, your Coreg and Spironolactone were held.
You will need to follow your coumadin level closely with your PCP and will need an INR next Monday at your PCPs office.
You will need your INR checked next Monday and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] will follow them.
