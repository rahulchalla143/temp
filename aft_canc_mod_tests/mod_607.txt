According to the vascular surgery H/P admission blood pressure was 80/38.
Mixed venous O2 sat was 41 arguing against distributive shock.
Patient had leukocytosis to >20 and underwent an infectious workup which was unrevealing.
She underwent ECHO cardiogram which showed aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation.
She was changed from phenylephrine to norepinephrine with moderate improvment in pressures though SBP remained 80-90's.
TTE showed severe AS with severe aortic regurgitation.
Cardiology was consulted and felt that her hypotension was secondary to cardiogenic shock from wide open MR.  Cardiac cath revealed a cardiac index of .58, 80% circ lesion.
Perioneal dialysate fluid showed 42 PMN (below cuttoff of 100) and was culture negative.
Stool negative for c.diff.
CXR was clear, RUQ u/s was negative for acalculous cholecystitis.
Consideration for AVR to improve hemodynamics was given but she was not a surgical candidate at that time according to CT surgery.
Sodium was in the low 130's, likely related to receiving nutrition through tube feeds.
Head CT did not show any acute intracranial process.
Anemia: HCT ~25-28 since surgery vs baseline 30-34.
- daily HCTs - transfuse to 25 given CAD .
EKG without e/o current ischemia.
Troponins elevated in setting of CKD.
- continue aspirin 325mg - continue statin - repeat EKG .
Because of her poor baseline pulmonary and cardiac function she got an echo of her heart which revealed her baseline cardiac function.
An EKG showed no change.
Overnight between [**7-3**] to [**7-4**] she became hypotensive into the 70s and 80s, failed to respond to fluid boluses times 3, and finally responded to a bolus of albumin.
Her blood pressure did not respond to the midodrine and she was transferred to the MICU service for further managment.
During her time on the MICU servic she had a repeat ECHO which revealed worening AS and was referred to cardiac surgery for AVR.
INR became supra-therapeutic and she received Vitamin K.  INR would trend down appropriately.
Cultures were sent and a course of antibiotics tailored for a pseudomonas pneumonia.
SBP at the time of discharge 110-116/70's.
Hematocrit was stable at the time of discharge with no further melana.
Her white blood cell count had increased to 22 and she was started on Bactrim and Flagyl.
C diff was negative x 2 and Flagyl was stopped.
She was afebrile at the time of discharge and WBC was decreasing on Bactim.
