WOUND CULTURE (Pending):   Brief Hospital Course: 83 year old man with Parkinson's and chronic aspiration who presents with GI bleed and sepsis.
A chest x-ray on admission showed bilateral focal airspace opacities.
Sputum was positive for MRSA at OSH and here.
A repeat CXR showed worsened pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions right > left.
On transfer from the MICU, he was positive 5.5 L for length of stay.
His WBC trended down and he remained afebrile.
A repeat PICC was placed on the day of discharge and is ready for use.
His INR was found to be elevated to 2.1 on admission secondary to coumadin therapy for his atrial fibrillation.
His hematocrit at the OSH was reportedly 18, with a baseline hematocrit in [**12-22**] at 39 per VA records.
He had received 2 units of pRBCs at the OSH with an improvement in his hematocrit to 20.9 on admission.
He was transfused with 3 units of FFP for emergent INR reversal as well as another 5 units of pRBCs.
An NG lavage was not performed in the ED secondary to difficulty with passing an NG tube.
He had a recent colonoscopy at the VA which showed multiple polyps but was otherwise negative for a source of bleeding.
His hematocrit steadily increased after transfer to the floor out of the MICU, and was 34.2 at time of discharge.
His EKG at the OSH showed ST depressions in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR and hct 17.
His INR was reversed with FFP and vitamin K, and his coumadin was held secondary to his GI bleed.
This may be titrated up as an outpatient as tolerated by his blood pressure.
A serum calcium level was normal, and the total protein to albumin ratio was found to be 5.7/2.2, which was not especially high.
Baseline hct at OSH was 39 in [**12-22**].
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease, and he had a normal Vitamin B12 level and folate during this admission.
However, he should have a follow-up urinalysis as an outpatient to evaluate for hematuria, and may need an outpatient work-up.
