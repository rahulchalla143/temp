CT CHEST: There is a large layering left pleural effusion causing eversion of the left hemidiaphragm and extending into the azygoesophageal recess.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Recently the medical team had discovered a lung mass by imaging studies and this was felt to be the likely primary.
At that time the patient was found to have a re-accumulation of the pleural fluid as well as pulmonary edema.
