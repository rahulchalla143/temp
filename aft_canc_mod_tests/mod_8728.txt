CXR [**3-22**]: IMPRESSION: Persistent opacity in the retrocardiac left lower lobe has the appearance of atelectasis.
CXr [**3-23**]: In comparison with study of [**3-22**], there is diffuse perihilar haziness extending out toward the periphery, consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.
CXR  [**3-26**]: In comparison with earlier study of this date, the degree of prominence of the pulmonary vessels is substantially decreased.
CXR [**3-29**]: Dense opacity at the left lung base has increased, now completely obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with effusion.
Cardiac Cath and Valvuloplasty:  1.
Initial angiography in this left-dominant circulation revealed the following:Left coronary artery with diffuse moderate calcification.
The LCx and marginals were large vessels free of significant disease.
Hemodynamics revealed a central aortic pressure pre-valvuloplasty of 111/69.
Fick Cardiac output improved from 2.83 to 2.96 post procedure.
Final pressure showed a reduction in the peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve to 36mm Hg.
Pt had negative cardiac markers x 3, q8 hours.
Lisinopril and Metoprolol were discontinued to raise her blood pressure.
Digoxin was also started with a load with a target level of 0.8, but then discontinued as her dig levels persistantly high at 1.8-1.9.
Given her recent admission with CHF and her tenous fluid status, she was evaluated for AVR and valvuloplasty.
She underwent cardiac catheterization and valvuloplasty successfully without complication and with decrease in peak gradient from 70 mmHg to 36mm Hg.
She had a brief episode of chest pain two days later which was determined not to be cardiac with rapid resolution with tylenol, unchanged EKG and negative cardiac enzymes.
