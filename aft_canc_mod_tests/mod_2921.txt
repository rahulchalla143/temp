Presumably, this was due to his study drug which was reinstituted after the surgery.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT non-contrast and contrast-enhanced axial CT imaging of the chest with multiplanar reformats was performed.
In addition, contrast- enhanced CT axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with multiplanar reformats was also performed.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Evaluation for pulmonary embolus is limited secondary to respiratory motion.
Lung windows demonstrate several pulmonary nodules, increased in size, including a 7- mm right lower lobe nodule, previously 3 mm.
The pancreas, spleen, stomach, and small bowel loops are within normal limits.
Target lesion #3, a left adrenal nodule, measures 34 x 30 mm, increased since prior study here it measured 27 x 24 mm.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Contrast is present within the Hartmann pouch.
Evaluation of segmental branch is limited.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-6-13**] 10:15 AM  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  Reason: Altered mental status; non-specific head CT.
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar multisequence images of the brain were obtained using the standard departmental protocol with administration of gadolinium.
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to a head CT dated [**2142-6-12**].
AP supine chest radiograph compared to the previous film from [**2142-6-13**].
Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2142-6-14**]    PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION: Indication: Congestive heart failure.

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: 3.6 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 55% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: *4.1 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aorta - Ascending: *3.5 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.2 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.7 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.7 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 1.00 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 250 msec TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): *27 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - body habitus.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Some upper zone redistribution is present suggesting some mild failure, but it is not significantly changed since the prior chest x-ray of [**6-16**].
Patchy bilateral airspace opacities are noted, which are slightly more prominent compared to [**2142-6-17**].
COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen and pelvis of [**2142-6-13**].
RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 12.7 cm.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-6-29**] 5:25 PM  CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  Reason: Please assess aggregate tumor burden.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast axial CT imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with coronal and sagittal reformats was reviewed.
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a new patchy opacity in the right upper lobe.
Evaluation of the lung windows is limited secondary to marked respiratory motion.
Pathologic mediastinal and hilar adenopathy is unchanged from [**2142-6-13**].
The pleural nodules previously identified are less well characterized on today's study given respiratory motion, effusions, and pulmonary edema.
Evaluation of this mass is limited secondary to the hardware.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Note is made of anterior wall defect and stoma in the left lower quadrant.
#Respiratory On POD 1, he had respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 24 and brief apnea episodes.
His fluids were decreased, nebulizers were ordered, an ABG was 7.43/37/85/25/0.
Labs were checked and CXR done.
A CT showed no evidence of a PE, a CXR showed some CHF, and a MRI of his brain showed no acute changes.
A bronchoscopy was performed that showed increased secretions in the left mainstem.
#Renal Consult After several days of diuresis with Lasix, his creatinine was rising (up to 4.2 on [**2142-6-23**]) and he was noted to have ARF.
His Vanco level was 26.1 on [**2142-6-19**].
We monitored his fluid status closely and he received several fluid boluses to increase his urine output.
A renal ultrasound was negative.
His labs gradually improved and the creatinine slowly came down and the Vanco level was 9.3 on [**2142-6-25**].
His urine output began to improve.
On [**2142-7-7**] his BUN was 27, and Cr was 1.4.
His ostomy was in place and the stoma pink.
# Urology A urine culture on [**2142-5-14**] showed P. Aeruginosa and Gram negative rods.
An ultrasound revealed a right-sided epididymitis with complex hydrocele.
A repeat urine culture showed E.coli resistant to Cipro.
A urine culture on [**2142-5-26**] revealed Klebsiella Pneumoniae, pan resistant.
A urine culture on [**2142-5-29**], again showed Klebsiella Pneumoniae.
#Heme His platelet count went from 192 to a low of 66 and gradually climbed up to the low 100's.
His labs were watched closely and his heparin products were held.
#Tachycardia The patient was tachycardic in the low 100's with a BP of 130/80.
One unit of PRBC was given for a HCT of 28.5.
