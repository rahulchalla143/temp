She was admitted [**12-30**] to the OSH with SOB, pleuritic chest pain, and throat/tongue discomfort.
She initially presented to OSH ED on [**12-29**] w/ throat pain, a strep swab was done and was negative.
CTA was done that ruled out PE.
A CT of the neck was done for her neck swelling (per patient) and incidentally showed 2x1cm mass at base of tongue.
ENT evaluated patient and recommended MRI was suggested but patient could not tolerate this.
Cardiology was consulted and echo was done that showed trivial pericardial effusion, tele sig for sinus tach, and so patient was started on metoprolol.
TSH was checked and was normal.
CT of chest was repeated given persistent tachy which was negative for PE but sig for recurrent bl pleural effusions and in light of tongue mass the primary team was concerned for possible malignancy.
Plan was to possible retap or thoracoscopic drainage and pleurodesis by thoracic surgery, but patient requested to be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Prior to transfer her VS at OSH were notable for Tmax 100.6, HR 130s SBP 180s, 95% RA.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
MRI neck: 1.
Motion degraded images but no gross abnormality of the visualized lungs or arterial vessels noted.
Pleural Effusion/Pleuritic Pain: CXR on admission sig for b/l pleural effusion.
Tongue Mass/Dysphagia: This was an incidental finding on CT of neck at OSH.
MRI of neck was performed which did not reveal any mass.
CE were negative, thyroid function normal, and echo showed borderline right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
The patient is scheduled for a repeat TTE and will follow up with cardiology as outpatient.
Iron panel was performed which revealed Ferritin of 474, findings c/w anemia of chronic disease and no evidence of iron, vit b12 or folate deficiency.
