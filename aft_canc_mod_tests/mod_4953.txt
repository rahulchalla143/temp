During that admission LVP was performed and SBP ruled out.

TTE [**2198-6-14**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Admitted with creatinine of 2.0, FeNa on admission 0.28% indicating pre-renal state.
Diagnostic paracentesis was performed and ruled out SBP.
No GI endoscopy in our system but patient being evaluated for transplant, cannot be on transplant list without endoscopy so presumably completed somewhere.
As HRS progressed, MELD score was at 40 on transfer to the SICU.
# Pulmonary edema: Pt w/ pulm edema on CXR on [**6-13**] and mildly symptomatic.
Repeat TTE with still normal EF but new moderate PA systolic HTN.
Also transfused with platelets, FFP, and RBCs (as hct was 22 down from 25 at last check).
Held continuous pressure for ~3 hours.
Hct remained stable following transfusion.
Of note, she had an INR of 2.5 and fibrinogen of 59 prior to the procedure so snare removal of the polyp was deferred.
We transfused RBC, FFP, platelets and cryo to goal Hct of 30 and correct her coagulopathy.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc/zosyn/mica) and a CT torso showed severe pneumonia with very little residual aerated lung volume.
Her heart rate and blood pressure gradually declined and asystole occured at 9:28pm.
