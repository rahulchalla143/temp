She was taken to [**Hospital3 417**] and head MRI showed multiple metastatic lesions.
A MRI brain was ordered 2 weeks ago at [**Hospital3 71979**] which showed multiple enhancing parenchymal lesions consistent with metastatic CA with notably inc size of right cerebellar lesions and frontoparietal lesions.

MRI +/- head [**2119-3-29**] (pre-op) Multiple enhancing lesions, specifically in the left frontal and the right cerebellar hemispheres are demonstrated for the surgical planning.
CT head [**2119-3-29**] (post-op) The patient is status post right suboccipital craniotomy, with bony defect in the right occipital bone, with post-surgical changes in the soft tissues along with small amount of air in the soft tissues as well as in the extra-axial location in the right side of the posterior fossa.
MRI +/- head [**2119-4-1**] TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired before gadolinium.
MP-RAGE axial images were also acquired.
Comparison was made with the previous MRI examination of [**2119-3-29**] and [**2119-3-24**].
Since the previous MRI examination the patient has undergone resection of right-sided cerebellar lesion.
Comparison of pre- and post-gadolinium images demonstrate no definite signs of residual enhancement.
CXR [**2119-3-23**]:  There is thickening of the right paratracheal stripe and hilum, which is indicative of underlying lymphadenopathy.
Increased density is again noted along the medial aspect of the right middle lobe, but is overall improved compared to previous examination as well.
An MRI of the head on [**3-24**] showed cerebellar mass causing significant mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
A neurosurgical consult recommended the initiation of decadron and close follow-up of her neurologic examination (for which she was briefly transferred to the ICU overnight).
Official pathology on the specimen was pending at the time of discharge, although initial pathology was presumed to represent metastatic disease.
She was discharged in stable condition on [**2119-4-1**] after having a post-operative MRI in anticipation of future treatment.
