In the ED his vital signs were stable although his Hct remained stable despite 1 unit PRBC transfusion so he was transfused a second unit and he was admitted.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2174-3-12**] 7:25 AM There is cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the aorta and slight pulmonary, vascular engorgement, possibly related to CHF or fluid overload.
GI Bleed and Abdominal Pain: Patient recently admitted and had negative EGD with colonoscopy showing only polyps none of which were bleeding.
Small bowel has never been evaluated since recent CT was without oral contrast and no SBFT performed.
Given hx of melena with no BRBPR despite 2 unit Hct drop over the last month, elevated BUN, we were more suspicious of UGI source although EGD neg.
Of note, CT abdomen/pelvis revealed no free air, however did reveal pericolic fluid of unknown significance as well as some mild gallbladder wall thickening and fat stranding of also unknown significance.
Patient became acutely tachycardic to 140s-150s, with SBP 90s-100s, and was thought to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response secondary to adrenergic stress from infection vs. blood loss.
Therefore, patient was administered metoprolol 5mg IV X 2, then diltiazem 10mg IV with good effect, and patient's rate came to 110s.
Patient's blood pressure, however, was also affected by both medications, and came to high 80s systolic.
ECG showed ST depression in v [**3-20**] but this is unchanged from previous, and cardiac enzymes were negative.
CT abd neg for free air or ischemic colitis.
Despite transfer to the intensive care unit, patient became adamant in his refusal of further interventions, and ultimately decided that he wished comfort management only.
