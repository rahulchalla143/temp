#.thrombocytopenia/ITP- The patient presented with petechiae, epistaxis and a platelet count at 1.
During the patient prior hospitalization, he became refractory to platelet transfusions, and an anti-platelet antibody screen was found to be positive.
Concurrently, he received platelets transfusions to maintain a platelet count above 10.
For treatment of the hematoma, a large abdominal binder was place, and the patient received thrice daily transfusion of platelets for approximately 1 week, responding well to each unit, but consumed quickly.
By the time of the patient's death, he was requiring once daily units of platelet to maintain platelet count greater than 10. .
A splenectomy was performed on [**2103-9-13**] due to ITP and a biospy of the spleen demonstrated extensive involvement of DLBCL.
A peripheral smear on [**2103-10-8**] demonstrated findings consistent with involvement by previously diagnosed CD5 positive large B-cell lymphoma.
#.Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure- On [**2103-9-15**] (post op day 2), the patient was transferred to the ICU for altered mental status, fever, and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Initially, BI-PAP was placed, but the patient continued to de-sat to high 80's and required intubation.
A CXR was concerning for LLL infiltrate/pneumonia, and a BAL was performed, which grew only normal respiratory flora.
A repeat [**Date Range **] culture on [**9-19**] grew the same.
Blood and Urine cultures also were negative.
A CD4 count was 39, and a viral load was undetectable.
The patient recieved blood transfusion for HCT<25.
Culture of PICC tip was negative and pt remained bacterimic.
Bicarbonate decreased to 10 and pt became increasingly tachypneic.
Pt did not want further invasive testing and pt would not likely survive any aggressive intervention.
Pt's blood pressure dropped, breathing worsened, and pt was unresponsive to painful stimulus or verbal cues by the afternoon of [**2103-10-11**].
