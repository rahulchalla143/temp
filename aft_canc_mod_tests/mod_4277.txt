He was intubated there (with double lumen) and then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED: pt was hemodynamically stable with HR 80s, BP 120-140s.
He was given propofol which dropped his pressures to 60s.
Pathology noted a 3-cm clear cell lesion, grade I - II, confined to the cortex.
Ureteral & vascular margins were  free of tumor, no vascular invasion was seen.
He was followed serially with CT scans.
- in late [**2132**], developed recurrent hemoptysis which prompted ENT  evaluation & chest imaging, which showed a compressive mass in  the right bronchus.
He had a flexible bronchoscopy at [**Hospital1 1562**] complicated by significant bleeding & was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2133-1-14**].
Chest CT showed a mass encasing the right pulmonary artery & invading the bronchus intermedius.
- [**Date range (1) 14706**] Sutent was restarted, completed 1 cycle; but [**2133-7-21**] bloodwork showed low WBC/Plts, drug was again held through [**2133-8-8**].
- on [**2133-11-25**], saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for bronchoscopy which showed stent in good position, no endobronchial lesions were seen.
- [**1-9**] Platelets>150 and CT chest showed interval growth of right hilar mass, w/ worse occlusion of the R mainstem bronchus.
- in follow-up [**2134-2-2**], his cough had improved but plts were low, necessitating hold - on [**2134-2-17**], restarted once plts 98 - follow-up [**2134-3-2**], He was doing well apart from ongoing respiratory symptoms of cough, sputum production & scant hemoptysis/mild epistaxis.
His platelets were 109.
platelets were stable at 95.
- On [**2134-7-13**] CT appeared to show overall minimal decrease to affected area and decreased compression of the right main stem  bronchus.
