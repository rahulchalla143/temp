EKG ([**2205-12-17**]): Atrial fibrillation with diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities are non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of [**2205-8-24**] ventricular rate is slower and further ST-T wave changes are present.
CXR ([**2205-12-17**]): Diffuse hazy opacity with pulmonary vascular indistinctness and left pleural effusion likely bilateral, most consistent with volume overload and congestive failure.
DLCO <35% as well, s/o interstitial lung disease, severe CHF, emphysmea, or PE.
Given hypoxia refractory to nebulzier treatments, BNP>1800, and CXR that shows effusions and mild vascular congestion, pulmonary congestion thought to be contributing to SOB.
Did not initially receive CT as hard IV access.
Had PICC line placed as hard IV access, and had CT chest with contrast performed.
Oxygen demand titrated down to 4-6L NC for 90-94% saturation.
