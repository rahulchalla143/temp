CTA ABD W&W/O C - [**2116-4-9**] - IMPRESSION: 1) Mild Pancreatitis, 2) Cholelithiasis, without evidence of acute cholecystitis, 3) Extensive colonic diverticulosis.
Pericolic fluid is most likely due to underlying liver disease, 4) Lesion in segment VI of liver which has been noted on prior ultrasounds from [**2115-12-28**], and [**2115-12-24**].
Because of this, an MRI is once again recommended to evaluate the vasculature and in particular, to exclude an underlying liver malignancy.
As the patient cannot get an MRI and there is no definable target for biopsy, consideration for a PET-CT study should be given.
RESOLVING SEPSIS - appears resolved, BP became stable with good CVP's.
GALLSTONE PANCREATITIS - s/p ERCP, and was able to tolerate PO diet without complaint.
His enzymes continued to trend down.
RATE - he was restarted on his outpatient Diltiazem for Afib, as well as Digoxin.
It was agreed that we should continue holding his Coumadin, and this could be further evaluated as an outpatient.
DVT - it was noted by radiology that he may have a possible RUE dvt on his abdominal CT.
He was mildly guiac positive while on Heparin, and recieved 1U of PRBC's with Hct corrected to baseline.
He should have f/u Hct checks.
HTN - his ACEi was held, and he was placed back on Diltiazem for rate control.
His BP remained stable without Lisinopril, so this was not restarted.
LIVER - his liver lesion on CT was concerning for HCC, and his previous AFP was 37.5 on [**2115-3-1**].
