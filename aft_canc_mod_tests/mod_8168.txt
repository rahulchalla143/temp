CT abdomen: CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There are new moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are grossly normal.
A partially calcified left common iliac aneurysm measures approximately 5.0 x 4.3 cm on today's study and demonstrates a more ovoid configuration than on the prior study.
CT OF THE PELVIS: There is a Foley catheter within the urinary bladder, which contains gas.
The team was called, and his BP was found to be 80/palp, and he was not mentating well.
Over the next several minutes, his BP decreased to a systolic of 30 despite fluids running in wide open.
After roughly 5 minutes, his BP began to rise, and was 90s/40s.
His SBP had been 120s-140s all day.
Labs on transfer to the MICU were significant for a severe acidemia (pH 6.94), low bicarb (14), elevated lactic acid (14), large hematocrit drop from the AM (32->22), stable WBC (10K), stable LFTs.
His CXR revealed small L effusion, no PTX, ET tube 2cm from carina, no infiltrate.
His allopurinol, HCTZ were restarted.
His abdominal exam was notable for increasing distension, and eventually he was stable enough for a CT abdomen / pelvis.
