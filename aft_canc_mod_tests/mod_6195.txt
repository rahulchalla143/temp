Of note, the patient self stopped Xarelto with last dose on Sat [**6-25**].
The patient went for the repeat PVI on [**6-28**].
Interventional cardiology was called and did a pericardiocentesis with 250 cc of bright red blood returned.
He was started on colchicine and sent to CCU for further monitoring and evaluation.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2129-6-28**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):     ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2129-6-29**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
Fluid Culture in Bottles (Preliminary):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCUS(COCCI).
Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2129-6-29**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.
ECHO ([**6-28**]): Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
ECHO ([**6-29**]): Focused study s/p pericardiocentesis: There is trivial pericardial effusion of no hemodynamic significance located anteriorly to the right and left ventricle.
Repeat TTE demonstrated little pericardial fluid and drain was removed.
Echo on day of discharged showed only trivial pericardial effusion.
Follow-up pericardial fluid cultures: One bottle showed GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS, the other bottle demonstrated no growth (preliminary read).
You had this drained and multiple ultrasounds of your heart which showed that the fluid was not reaccumulating.
Your blood pressure was a little low while you were here.
