CXR [**8-26**] The multifocal airspace opacities have overall slightly improved in the background of metastatic disease and mild pulmonary edema; however, the right upper lobe opacity remains.
Given the supine nature of these films, we are unable to assess for fluid levels or free air in the abdomen.
Also, CXR is generally improved since last performed 1 week prior.
A cardiac cause was considered unlikely given the lack of history and unremarkable EKG, but still possible, especially given long history of dialysis and BNP of 4374.
His ECHO revealed pulmonary HTN and biatrial enlargement.
