The patient states that she has had SBP in the upper 80s to 90s for the past month.
She was found to be in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.2.
In the ED she received IVFs at 1/2 NS at 100 cc/hr with blood pressures improving to the 90s (which is her baseline); she was mentating well.
Her CXR was clear, however she was mildly hypoxemic after receiving IVF for her hypotension.
V/Q scan and LENIs were obtained given hypoxia and were negative.
BNP 371.
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, decreased bowel sounds GU: no foley Ext: Bilateral lower legs are warm and erythematous.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-2-3**], the findings are similar.
Since the previous tracing of [**2121-2-17**] the rate is faster and the QRS voltage in lead aVL is less prominent with a more vertical axis.
Other possibilites include worsening of HOCM, or worsened diffuse pulmonary metastasis as seen on CT in [**2121-2-14**] which may have further reduced pulmonary reserve.
CTA was done to rule out PE - negative for PE.
# Acute renal failure - Baseline creatinine around 1 and 1.0 on [**4-10**].
We ruled out a clot in the lungs, and did an echocardiogram to show that your heart function was similar to previously.
It is unclear why your blood pressure was low, but with diuresis (fluid removal) and treatment of infection, your blood pressure improved up to baseline.
On discharge, you were walking well without a need for oxygen, your blood pressure had improved/elevated, and your leg symptoms were improving.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, weight gain greater than 2 pounds, palpitations, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, worsening leg swelling/redness/pain, lightheadedness.
