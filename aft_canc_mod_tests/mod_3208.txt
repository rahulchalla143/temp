Abdominal CT scan on [**4-1**] showed a 3-4 cm mass in her ascending colon.
Biopsy of the lesion revealed invasive adenocarcinoma in the ascending colon.
Surgery was consulted at the outside hospital for right hemicolectomy, which the patient consented to; however, the patient has a significant cardiac history and needed cardiac work-up prior to surgery and was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further cardiology work-up.
Echocardiogram in [**2143-12-29**] showed an ejection fraction of 75-80%, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and mitral regurgitation.
Persantine study showed large anterior wall reversible defect on [**2144-4-6**].
The patient had another echocardiogram on [**2144-4-6**], which showed mild aortic stenosis and an aortic valve area of 1.1 cm.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On admission temperature was 98?????
?, pulse 78, blood pressure 150/70, respirations 22, oxygen saturation 92% on room air.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 7.1, hematocrit 32.9, platelet count 291; chemistries with a sodium of 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 103, bicarb 26, BUN 6, creatinine 1.1, glucose 98, calcium 8.7.
Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm, 80 beats per minute, right bundle branch block, first degree AV block, Q-waves in II, III, and AVF, T-wave inversion in V1 and V2 with no ST elevations or depressions.
Echocardiogram on [**4-6**] at the outside hospital was with mild aortic stenosis with valve area of 1.17 mm, normal left ventricular function.
Carotid ultrasound done at the outside hospital showed no significant stenosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Service for preoperative work-up considering her cardiac history.
Cardiology consult was obtained, and a repeat echocardiogram was performed which showed left ventricle with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, ejection fraction greater than 55%, aorta with trace regurgitation, aortic valve and mitral valve with 1+ mitral regurgitation, mild to moderate aortic stenosis, and a ventricular inflow pattern suggestive of impaired relaxation and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
A stress test was also obtained that was performed with a ................... injection where the patient had no anginal symptoms or ischemic electrocardiogram changes.
Nuclear scan showed no myocardial perfusion defects to suggest ischemia and an ejection fraction of 89%.
Urine output was 260 cc.
Postoperatively the patient was transfused 1 U packed red blood cells secondary to a hematocrit of 27.3.
The patient was also received an electrocardiogram postoperatively that was unchanged from preoperative electrocardiogram.
Intraoperatively the patient had a right CVL placed, and chest x-ray was performed postoperatively which showed no pneumothorax.
Cardiac enzymes were sent after the exiting the operating room, and CK was 59, and troponin was less than 0.3.
The patient's pulse was around 100, and her blood pressure was running around 150/70; therefore, Lopressor was increased to 5 mg q.4 hours.
for blood pressures above 180.
The patient had more cardiac enzymes drawn with a troponin on the third set that increased to 1.2.
Morphine PCA provided good pain control and was continued at this time.
Lopressor was increased to 7.5 mg q.4 hours, as her pulse remained around 100, and blood pressure was 150/70.
On exam her vitals signs were normal, and she was afebrile.
Labs were drawn at that time.
CBC was with a slightly elevated white count of 13.
Hematocrit was 30.
Magnesium was 1.7, potassium 4.0, and the rest of the chemistries were normal.
Repeat electrocardiogram at that time was unchanged.
