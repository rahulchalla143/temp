The hepatic parenchyma is difficult to assess with ultrasound due to the heterogeneity and the abnormality identified on recent MRI is not visualized.
[**5-22**] CT chest - No good evidence for intrathoracic malignancy.
[**5-24**] MRI abdomen - 1.
We would recommend a repeat ultrasound-guided biopsy of this lesion.
[**5-31**] CT abd/pelvis 1.
Echo Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size are normal.Left ventricular function is hyperdynamic EF 60-70% .No regional wall motion abnormality is obseved Right atrium is mildly dilated.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion is normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
His bilirubin continued to climb.
Repeat imaging showed dramatic enlargement of his liver mass, preliminary results of liver biopsy were consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.
Diuesis was begun, and he was extubated late on POD1 without any complications.
His LFT's improved daily with ast decreasing to 28, alt 55, alk phos 115, and t.bili 1.8.
Albumin was 2.5.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Diabetes center consult was obtained for blood glucose control post-op.
His sodium slowly corrected with fluid restriction from 750-1000cc.
Urine electrolytes revealed a relatively hypotonic urine, indicating that his kidneys were responding appropriately.
Creatinine improved to 2.8 on pod 13.
The medial JP was removed on pod 5 with the lateral JP continued to have outputs of 800 to 650cc/day.
The recipient liver pathology report was still pending at time of discharge.
