While there, the patient had continued treatment of pneumonia and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done on [**10-16**], which showed esophagitis with nonbleeding fundal polyp.
On [**2147-11-4**], the patient was febrile to 102 degrees and repeat blood cultures at that time showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains.
The patient's hematocrit was 19 on [**2147-11-6**].
He was given two units of packed red blood cells at that time with repeat hematocrit on [**11-8**], still at 19.
The patient was, therefore, transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further evaluation and treatment.
In the emergency department here, the patient's temperature was 100.7 rectally and he was found to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s; this responded to an IV fluid bolus.
EKG done at that time showed new atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
A femoral triple-lumen was placed and NG-tube placement was attempted, but not successful.
Blood transfusion was initiated in the emergency department.
Lumbar fracture of L4.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the temperature of 101.7 rectally.
Heart rate in the 80s and irregular.
Blood pressure 98/50; respiratory rate 20; pulse oximetry 95% on two liters.
HEENT:  Exam showed temporal muscle wasting.
LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission revealed the following: White count 15.8; hematocrit 20.7; platelets 120,000.
Differential showed 93% neutrophils, 3% bands, 4% lymphs; PT 13.9; INR 1.3; PTT 37; albumin 1.6; sodium 153; potassium 3.5; chloride 122; bicarbonate 122; BUN 80 and creatinine 1.1; glucose 100; serum osmolality 328; calcium 7.2; magnesium 2.1; phosphorus 3.9; CK 42; troponin less than 0.3; ALT 27; AST 33; alkaline phosphatase 110; amylase 80; total bilirubin 0.4.
Microbiological studies showed urine cultures at [**Hospital1 5042**] on [**11-4**], were negative.
Blood cultures at [**Hospital1 5042**] on [**10-28**], grew out MRSA in two bottles.
Urine culture at [**Hospital1 5042**] on [**10-28**] grew out E. coli, which was resistant only to Ampicillin.
Stool for C. difficile at [**Hospital1 5042**] was negative on [**10-23**].
Blood cultures at [**Hospital1 5042**] on [**11-24**], had gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, as well as yeast, growing two separate sets of blood cultures.
RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray on admission showed a left pleural effusion, question of basilar consolidation.
EKG:  The EKG showed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of 103 with left axis deviation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the MICU, initially, for further evaluation and monitoring.
Echocardiogram was obtained on [**11-13**] to look for possible vegetations.
The blood cultures grew out E. coccus, which was sensitive to Vancomycin.
The patient was continued on AmBisome for his fungal infection, which was speciated as [**Female First Name (un) 564**] parapsilosis.
Head CT was obtained on [**11-13**].
The patient's Flagyl was discontinued on [**11-13**], as there was no evidence of aspiration pneumonia and repeated stool samples were negative for C. difficile.
The patient's femoral line, which was placed on admission was discontinued on [**11-15**], at which time, a single lumen PIC was placed into the right arm, as surveillance cultures had been negative for greater than 48 hours.
The patient has remained hypothermic throughout this hospital admission with temperatures ranging from 95 to 96, while he was on a warming blanket.
He is dosed with 1-g IV when the random Vancomycin level is less than 15.
A GI consultation was obtained.
A KUB was obtained on [**11-12**], as the patient had no bowel sounds, but it was negative for toxic megacolon.
At that time a swallow study was done at the bed side and they felt that the patient could possibly be given pureed foods with nectar-thick liquid.
The patient's most recent albumin is 1.6, which was measured on [**2147-11-20**].
As far as electrolytes, the patient has been hyponatremic throughout his hospital stay with a high of 153 on admission and most recent sodium of 148 on [**2147-11-27**].
He had received hypotonic fluids during his hospital stay, which improved his sodium down to a low of 143.
The atrial fibrillation, which he was found to be in on admission, reverted back to a normal sinus rhythm with APC.
Echocardiogram on [**2147-11-13**], showed no wall-motion abnormalities.
RENAL:  The patient has no known history of any renal disease with his baseline creatinine being .7 to .9.
The creatinine was watched closely on admission, especially given the fact that he was to receive a huge dose of Amphotericin.
However, his creatinine did not bump at that time.
The creatinine had been steady from 1.2 to 1.5 being started being started on the AmBisome.
However, the most recent creatinine on [**2147-11-27**], is up to 1.7.
A head CT is already described, but negative for any acute intracranial pathology.
Chest x-ray showed is difficult to determine as the patient is a poor inspiratory effort.
His most recent chest x-ray done on [**2147-11-23**], showed that there are still diffuse opacities bilaterally, which could represent aspiration or pneumonia, which is not significantly changed from admission.
