An endoscopy and CT scan performed in [**Country 3397**] approximately one year ago showed leiomyoma of the stomach.
An endoscopy at the outside institution showed a mass along the duodenum involving the ampulla of Vater.
An ERCP was done at that time and a stent was placed.
PHYSICAL EXAM: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 99.4?????
?, heart rate 88, blood pressure 118/64, respiratory rate 16.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Scleral icterus.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit was 40.3.
Sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 100, bicarbonate 26, BUN 20, creatinine 0.9, glucose 111, AST 64, ALT 64, alkaline phosphatase 147, bilirubin 10.4, amylase 46.
CT scan was done which revealed a large intraabdominal hematoma.
On [**10-14**], the patient was brought back to the Operating Room, had an exploratory laparotomy and evacuation of an intraabdominal clot.
Cultures from the Operating Room revealed [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.
Multiple ultrasounds were obtained of the liver which revealed good flow in the right and left hepatic arteries.
The patient's cultures continued to be followed and a repeat CT scan was obtained on [**10-18**].
Due to increased JP output, JP amylase was sent and this revealed a value of 29,000.
Repeat ultrasounds were obtained which revealed a small amount of peritoneal fluid and no loculated fluid collections.
JP fluid was again sent off on [**10-23**] which revealed a bilirubin of 12.1 and an amylase of 4,040.
CT scan showed a large amount of fluid in the pelvis.
It was decided to bring the patient back to the Operating Room on [**10-24**] as he continued to have persistent fever spikes and the above noted findings on CT scan.
Procedure performed was an exploratory laparotomy and the findings at the time were intraabdominal hematoma with a breakdown of the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis.
At that time, the jejunum was oversewed and a portion of the skin incision was left open and a portion was closed with Marlex mesh.
His repeat cultures revealed no growth.
He then regained a pulse and was tachycardic to 140s and his blood pressures were in the 70s.
He was brought emergently to the Operating Room where an exploratory laparotomy was performed.
His hematocrits continued to drop and on [**11-11**] he was brought to angiogram where it was revealed that there was extravasation from the right hepatic artery.
The patient received large amounts of packed red blood cells and FFP transfusion during this time for continued dropped hematocrits.
He was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit where his hematocrits kept dropping.
