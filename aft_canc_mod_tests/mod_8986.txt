When her head imaging showed decreased edema after the decadron was lowered, the patient started to have language difficulties, with diminished comprehension and verbal output, and although she was totally ambulatory 1 month prior to admission, she had a fall 4 weeks prior to the day of admission with head trauma, and afterwards had increasing right-sided weakness.
Subsequent MRI did show the left lobe tumor with substantial edema and midline shift associated with subfalcine herniation.
The patient was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.
The patient then was reimaged on MRI, and a new imaging showed a new large necrotic mass in the left frontal lobe with significant worsening of surrounding vasogenic edema with a midline shift to the right.
PERTINENT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FINDINGS:  The patient's vital signs were stable in the ICU and throughout admission on the floor.
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her cardiac rhythm was regular rate with S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The patient on sensory exam was withdrawing on left upper and lower extremities at the onset of admission when her mental status was depressed, and then was intact to all modalities on the left side.
However, the patient was unable to withdraw to painful stimulus on the right upper and lower extremities.
Sensory examination at the onset of the admission - the patient was intact to all modalities in the left upper and lower extremities.
Coordination exam - the patient was unable to follow finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing, but did have symmetric fine finger movements when cooperative.
Reflexes - the patient was areflexic.
PERTINENT LAB, X-RAY, EKG AND OTHER TESTS:  The patient's CBC was followed vigorously throughout the admission.
When the patient was admitted, she had a hemoglobin of [**10-15**] which decreased to [**8-9**].
The patient was transfused of 2 units of packed red blood cells in the ICU, and her hematocrit rebounded up to the mid-30s where it was stable prior to discharge.
The patient also was thrombocytopenic on admission with a platelet count of 41.
The patient's coagulation were also normal and stable throughout the admission.
The patient's UA did show evidence of a urinary tract infection which was confirmed by urine culture positive for E. coli.
The patient's latest head CT on [**2184-11-12**] showed a slightly decreased degree of edema and mass effect, and a slight decrease in the size of the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, but showed unchanged mass effect and substantial edema with surrounding hemorrhage.
The patient's neurologic exam remained unchanged while the patient was on the general medical floors, with a dense right-sided hemiplegia and full power on the left side.
Palliative care consult met with the family and explained all of the rules that hospice would adhere to, including supportive treatment, but minimalizing diagnostic treatment and blood draws.
