A true upright chest radiograph should be obtained to differentiate between the possibilities, looking for a fluid level.
[**3-12**] CXR: AP and lateral chest views obtained with patient in sitting upright position are analyzed in direct comparison with two preceding chest examinations of [**3-11**] and [**2201-3-12**], the latter approximately seven hours earlier.
On the next previous study, the right-sided chest tubes had been removed and a pneumothorax occupying the upper third of the hemithorax was identified.
On the present study, two new chest tubes have been placed and appear in rather similar position as on the chest examination of [**2201-3-11**].
The left chest remains unchanged and is within normal limits.
There is a large air-fluid level in the right apex, with smaller air-fluid levels within the right apex.
[**3-13**] CT Chest: Status post right upper lobe resection.
[**3-15**] CXR: Single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2201-3-15**] at 08:00 hours and compared with the prior morning's radiograph.
The pneumothorax previously identified is not apparent on the current examination in this projection.
[**3-18**] CT Head/neck: Acute left posterior cerebral aratery distribution infarct, with posterior occipital- temporal edema.
Filling defect within proximal left posterior cerebrla artery (likely P2 branch) and blood volume- blood flow mismatch on perfusion images suggest ischemic penumbra.
[**3-19**] CT Head: No evidence of hemorrhage s/p IV TPA.
She underwent a bronchoscopy which found copious heavy secretions in both lungs, most marked in the right lower lobe.
On POD6, her heparin drip was stopped due to a supratherapeutic INR (of 6).
Her INR was allowed to drift towards a therapeutic range.
Her sputum cultures grew Aspergillus, but all subsequent evaluation was negative for infection.
On POD10, a repeat head CT demonstated no hemorrhage after receiving TPA.
Medications on Admission: Diovan 80mg daily HCTZ 25mg daily Verapamil 180mg [**Hospital1 **] Coumadin 5mg daily Multivitamin Glucosae Milk of Magnesia  Discharge Medications: 1.
Warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO ONCE (Once): Please adjust dose to achieve an INR of [**2-14**].
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed.
Followup Instructions: Call Dr.[**Name (NI) 1816**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**] for a follow up appointment in [**7-21**] days Have you INR checked daily until your INR is [**2-14**] and stable for 48-72 hours, then have it checked weekly
