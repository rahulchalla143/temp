She was further worked up with a bone marrow biopsy and CAT scan and diagnosed with a low-grade lymphoma and thought most consistent with a splenic marginal zone lymphoma.

Abdominal U/S ([**2168-9-1**]):  1.
A contrast enhanced liver CT is advised to further evaluate.
CT Abd/Pelv ([**2168-9-1**]): occlusive PV thrombus in intrahepatic R and L branches of the PV.
CXR ([**2168-9-2**]): IJ is in proper position in the lower SVC.
CXR ([**2168-9-7**]): Neg for PNA or effusions  Pending labs: spleen for pathology  Medication changes: none  The patient was admitted for observation after laparoscopic splenectomy that was converted to open.
POD#2 she developed low grade temperature with leukocytosis of 15,000 with a HCT drop from 29.6 to 26.8 and worsening abdominal pain.
There was concern for possible venous thrombosis so an abdominal U/S was performed.
However, this was suboptimal study limited  views due to pain but did demonstrate lack of flow through the portal vein.
A follow-up CT scan demonstrated an occlusive thrombus in the portal vein and non-occlusive thrombus in the splenic vein remnant.
Her HCT continued to drop to 22.4 and she was transfused 2 units PRBCs, she responded appropriately with a HCT of 30.
ID was consulted who recommend checking blood cultures and UA which were negative.
Their recommendations were to keep HCT greater than 21 and to follow up as an outpatient with her Oncologist and her scheduled f/u CT scan.
POD#7 her INR returned as 6.6 and all anticoagulation was held to allow her to drift back down.
Her R IJ was removed and sent for culture which was negative.
POD#8 she did have temperature of 101.0, CXR was negative for infiltrate and UA was negative.
She remained afebrile therafter, her WBC continued to trend down and her INR trended down to 3.4, and she developed post-splenectomy thrombocytosis with platelet count of 840 on discharge.
She is going to receive 1mg coumadin tonight and should have her INR checked at rehab to titrate coumadin.
Calcium with Vitamin D 600 mg(1,500mg) -400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
titrate to goal INR of [**3-3**].
