The patient reports that she has had progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and a cough productive of whitish sputum over the past several months, and that these symptoms prompted her CT chest in [**8-4**] that demonstrated her pulmonary metastasis.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 97.5 130 143/82 28 94% RA.
She was then admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
Underwent 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan and four cycles of Taxol, followed by right total mastectomy, which revealed no residual carcinoma.
Partial mastectomy demonstrated 1.1 cm infiltrating ductal carcinoma, grade 2, LVI positive, 3 mm posterior [**Last Name (un) 2027**] and DCIS 2 mm from inferior margin.
Genetic testing revealed her to be BRCA2 heterozygosity, so she underwent left mastectomy, which revealed no residual carcinoma.
- Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] treated her to the chest wall (50.4 Gy) and the supraclavicular and axillary nodes (45 Gy), completed on [**2178-8-21**].
CTA chest on [**2180-8-22**] demonstrated LLL pulmonary mass (17 x 16 mm with possible lymphangitic spread), enlarged cervical nodes, and a 2.2-cm paratracheal node.
- [**2180-9-13**] - Brain MRI revealed a 4.3 x 4.2 mm left cerebellar lesion and two small foci in the right occipital lobe.

CXR ([**2180-10-29**]): Ill-defined hazy opacities in both lungs, worse within the left perihilar region, with increased size of the cardiac silhouette and small left pleural effusion.
Underlying infection or neoplasm, as noted on the prior CT within the left lung cannot be discerned on this exam.
TTE ([**2180-10-30**]): Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Moderate pericardial effusion with echo evidence of tamponade.
CT Chest With Contrast ([**2180-10-30**]): No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
TTE ([**2180-10-31**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-10-30**], the pericardial effusion is now much smaller.
CXR [**2180-11-2**]: IMPRESSION: Further progression of metastatic breast cancer disease with pericardial effusion, extensive infiltrates in left lower lobe, and additional probably metastatic spread in other lung regions.
ECHO [**2180-11-3**]: Conclusions Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Brief Hospital Course: 52 year old woman with a PMH significant for metastatic breast cancer with lung and brain metastases admitted originally to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of respiratory distress, then transferred to CCU after pericardiocentesis for cardiac tampoande, then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 2035**] after pt's respiratory status stabilized.
CXR on arrival demonstrated left peri-hilar and basilar infiltrates with concern for infectious consolidation/pneumonia, pleural effusion or progression of metastatic disease as her cancer was known to be located in the left lower lobe.
A CT with contrast was performed to further evaluate the intrapulmonary process and demonstrated a multifocal pneumonia, progression of the pulmonary metastases, pleural effusions as well as a moderate-to-large pericardial effusion (see below for management of pericardial effusion) but was negative for a pulmonary embolism.
Blood and urine cultures were performed and showed no growth as well as an Influenza DFA, which was negative.
The patient was maintained on oxygen by nasal canula to maintain an oxygen saturation greater than 90%.
Urine culture showed no growth though UA was positive for leukocytes, as she was already on broad spectrim antibiotics, no additional coverage was added.
After arrival to [**Name (NI) 2035**], pt remained afebrile and cultures were negative, so Cepfepime was dc'd again.
There was concern that it may be related to the patient's hypoxia or another underlying process such as a PE or possibly hypovolemia.
A CT was ordered as above to evaluate further, which was negative for a pulmonary embolism but did reveal a moderate-to-large pericardial effusion.
The fluid was sent for cultures which were all negative.
On [**2180-11-3**], a repeat ECHO was performed and it showed small pericardical effusion, reassuring us that the fluid had not reaccumulated.
# Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Patient presented with a mild metabolic acidosis and an anion gap of 15.
Repeat labs the morning after admission revealed a worsening of her acidosis with a HCO3 of 15 (down from 20 on admission).
An ABG revealed an appropriate respiratory compensation with a pCO2 of 31.
# Breast cancer: CT on admission showed dramatic progression of metastatic disease involving the lungs bilaterally.
The patient subsequently received several liters of intravenous fluids for her tachycardia and her hematocrit came down to 35.
