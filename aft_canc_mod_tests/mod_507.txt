Blood cxs were taken and he was started on azithromycin and vancomycin.
Past Oncology History: He was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma by bone marrow biopsy [**10-12**] when he was found to have an elevated white count on routine labs.
His cytogenetics showed a 11:14 translocation.
Pertinent Results: CXR ([**7-15**]): New diffuse bilateral increased interstitial markings suggestive  of an atypical infection of viral etiology in this neutropenic patient .
CT chest on [**7-17**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
ABG was done that showed 7.47/34/38 on RA.
CT scan showed diffuse bilateral consolidation of all lobes with relative sparing of the apices consistent with multifocal pneumonia or possibly ARDS and moderate right and small left layering pleural effusions.
His oxygen saturation prior to admission was 80% on 13L ventimask and NC.
Pt had a bronchoscopy that showed evidence of prior DAH, and patient was initiated on high dose Solumedrol 100 mg IV bid.
An TTE with bubble study was negative for any PFO or ASD that was causing persistent hypoxemia despite adequate ventilation.
A CTA was negative for any PE.
His daily CXR continued to be consistent with ARDS of unknown etiology combined with DAH.
His BAL cultures remained NGTD, and all other cx data remained negative.
Eventually, patient's WBC count returned to [**Location 213**], and his fevers resolved.
of new infiltrates in x ray prior to transfer a CT was ordered.
It showed marked improvement of consolidations and septal wall thickening in comparison to the previous CT, but rapid worsening during the last three days in comparison to the chest x-ray suggest pulmonary edema.
Chest X ray showed worsening bilateral pulmonary opacities with progression to frank alveolar consolidation.
Echocardiogram was also done that showed no change LVEF >55%, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Given lack of clear of positive data from Blood cx, urine cx and BAL, it was decided to continue treating empirically for CAP, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage.
Next day X ray was checked and showed marked improvement, however o2 requirement still present with sats 92-94% on 40%FIO2.
CT revealed worsening disease, B/L airspace opacities.
Bronchoscopy was attempted at 4:30PM.
Blood cx, BAL and Urine Cx all negative.
Hep b and C was negative in [**2116-11-7**].
Repeated serologies were sent and were negative.
