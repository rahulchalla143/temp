Labs checked at that time were normal, except for an elevated AFP of 450.
An abdominal u/s demonstrated a stable liver lesion of three years (never biopsied at patient's wishes) and a new bladder lesion.
He had a lumbar spine MRI which was reportedly normal.
In the OSH ED, 800 cc of urine was drained by a foley.
His BNP was elevated to 1600, troponin of 0.3 with no ischemic changes noted on his EKG.
His creatinine was also noted to be elevated to 2.1 from a baseline of 1.0.
The patient was also noted to be hypoxic at 86%/2LNC with an ABG of 7.42/24/50.
CXR was consistent with pneumonia and congestive heart failure.
6 cm AAA - inoperable 2. severe AS (0.9 cm) 3. alcoholic cirrhosis 4. h/o liver lesion x 3 yrs 5. new bladder lesion 6. elevated AFP 7.

DTR's 2+ throughout.

T4 moderate spinal stenosis and spinal cord compression  [**9-3**] MRI C-spine: probable metastatic compression T4  OSH: [**8-22**] Abd u/s: 2.1 cm x 2.3 cm hyperdense lesion in right posterior lobe of liver, unchanged from [**12/2103**], likely hemangioma.
Infraabdominal AAA 5.9 x 6.5 cm, increased since prior CT scan.
[**9-2**] - CT chest/abd/pelvis without contrast: small left, moderate right pleural effusion.
Spinal cord compression: Spine MRIs showed T4 infiltrated with associated compression fracture and cord compression.
Other possibilities include bladder cancer (given bladder mass), although urine cytology showed only degenerated epithelial cells.
