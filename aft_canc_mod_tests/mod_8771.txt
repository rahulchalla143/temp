The patient was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells and his K was repleted and he was prepared for surgery.
Two [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were left behind as well as a central venous line.
He was given perioperative Lopressor to control his rate as well as dopamine, and given fluid resuscitation and monitored based on the central venous pressure.
The diltiazem drip was able to control his rate under 100, although he remained in atrial fibrillation.
On [**7-10**], a urine culture was sent off in the morning which showed E. coli that was already sensitive to the Zosyn that the patient was taking at this time.
On [**7-13**], however, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was again complicated by two things, first a bile culture revealed the presence of E. coli and enterococcus as well as yeast in his bile.
Moreover, a CT scan on the 8th also showed a failure of oral contrast past the stomach, and it was noted that he had a delayed gastric emptying presumably as a complication of his Whipple procedure.
Unfortunately, his triglyceride levels were 476, and he was not able to be started on lipids within his TPN mixture.
Because of lack of clinical improvement, another CT scan was obtained, and this showed a marked massive perihepatic, perisplenic and pelvic ascites.
