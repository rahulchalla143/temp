He was started on IV antibiotics and acyclovir and underwent an LP, which showed a white blood count of 26, red blood cells 2, lymphocytes 97%, protein 42, and glucose 86.
His cultures have been negative.
It is likely that the leukocytosis demonstrated in his CSF was likely secondary to his lumbar puncture.
He underwent a head CT that showed decrease in his left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
He had a CT of his abdomen to r/o AAA because of concern for abdominal pain that was negative.
However, after it was clear that his EEG showed no ongoing seizure activity, it was weaned to 500mg [**Hospital1 **] again.
His corrected phenytoin levels were therapeutic.
All of his CSF, urine and blood cultures were negative during his admission.
Your EEG did not show any seizures, but was concerning for abnormal activity coming from your left frontal region, where your meningioma was.
