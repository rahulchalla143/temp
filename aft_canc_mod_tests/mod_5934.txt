F with L ilium plasmacytoma of the bone diagnosed in [**10-11**] and multiple myeloma in [**3-13**] when bone marrow showed 40-50% plasma cells, who was admitted for nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping, transferred briefly on night of admission to the MICU for altered mental status.
Noted to have new rebound tenderness in RUQ and hypoactive bowel sounds, and she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further evaluation.
ABG was within normal limits and mental status returned to baseline shortly thereafter.
However, other etiologies such as seizure, infection (given increased WBC and low grade fever) and myeloma (patient underwent MRI Head which showed sphenoid sinus lesion consistent with myeloma) were entertained.
An EEG performed on [**3-16**] was abnormal but did not show epileptiform activity.
Though one blood culture was still pending at the time of this dictation, no cultures were positive and infection was thought a less likely etiology.
At time of discharge her neurological and mental status exam were normal, at baseline.
CT abdomen showed no acute intrabdominal process, surgery evaluated and agreed.
Patient had a repeat scan 2 days later in the setting of low grade fever, leukocytosis and mild RLQ tenderness.
CT showed likely enteritis involving gastric and duodenal mucosa.
One blood culture was still pending at the time of discharge and this should be followed.
She required IV hydralazine in the ICU to maintain her BPs less than 170.
Her blood pressure lowered gradually into systolic 150s, and were trending down on discharge.
CT and MRI showed no evidence of bleed or acute infarct.
You had an MRI of the head which showed a lesion consistent with myeloma, the radiation oncologists will evaluate whether you might benefit from radiating this lesion.
You were also evaluated by neurology who performed an EEG which showed no evidency of seizure activity.
