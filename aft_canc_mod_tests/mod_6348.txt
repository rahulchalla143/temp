[**2131-5-18**] Final pathology of mesenteric mass: PENDING ON DISCHARGE  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 2520**] was taken to the operating room on [**2131-5-18**] for exploratory laparotomy given concern of ischemic colitis in the setting of an increased WBC count, rising lactate, and acute decompensation requiring pressors.
Final pathology results are pending on discharge.
On POD 7 his peritoneal output was noted to be chylous in appearance: Triglyerides were 303, with 100 WBC, and gram stain/culture was negative.
His JP was pulled out on POD 10.
His [**2131-5-18**] blood cultures returned positive for E.Coli, for which he completed 12 days of appropriate IV antibiotics (initially with vanc/zosyn, then narrowed to ceftriaxone).
His WBC was 23 on [**2131-5-18**], and trended down to 13.4 at the time of discharge.
All surveillance blood cultures after [**2131-5-18**] were negative, as were urine cultures.
Peritoneal fluid culture from [**2131-5-25**] was negative, and peritoneal fluid culture from [**2131-5-28**] was pending at the time of discharge (with 3+ PMNs and no microorganisms seen on gram stain).
