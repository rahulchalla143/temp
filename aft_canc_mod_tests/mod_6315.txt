Pericardial fluid and lymph node FNA both did not show clear evidence of malignancy.
CTA chest showed no evidence of PE, small bilateral pleural effusion, moderate pericardial effusion and large mediastinal mass encasing and narrowing the SVC, extensive lymphadenopathy.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

EKG: NSR, normal axis, normal intervals, occasional PAC, ST/T-wave changes, no Q waves EKG #2: a-fib, rate 110, normal intervals, no ischemic changes .
CTA CHEST at OSH: 1. no e/o pulmonary emboli 2. small bilateral pleural effusions.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
The echo dense portion of the effusion, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements, is over both the right (1.3cm) and left (0.8cm) ventricles.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-7-17**], the pericardial effusion might be slightly more organized.
[**7-21**] LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: IMPRESSION: No left upper extremity DVT identified  [**7-27**] Pleural fluid cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**8-2**] CT Abdomen and Pelvis IMPRESSION: 1.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-7-21**], the pericardial effusion appears smaller.
The LV systolic funciton appears worse (but the patient is significantly more tachycardic - SVT?)
[**2144-8-5**] Direct Antigen Test for HSV Types 1 & 2 (lip): Positive for Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 by direct antigen staining.
Torso CT [**2144-9-8**] CT CHEST: Multiple enlarged supraclavicular and bilateral axillary lymph nodes are again seen.
Mass now measures roughly 4.4 x 3.1 cm, decreased in size from previous exam when it measured 6.8 x 4.1 cm.
Evaluation of the lung parenchyma is slightly limited by expiratory phase of scan acquisition, with no focal nodules or consolidations identified.
CT ABDOMEN: Liver is unchanged in appearance, with multiple subcentimeter hypodensities which remain too small to definitively characterize.
CT PELVIS: Degree of colonic distension has slightly improved.
Pelvic loops of large and small bowel are otherwise unremarkable.
CXR [**2144-9-8**] HISTORY: Lymphoma, on chemotherapy, now with fever.
A repeat study is recommended without overlying artifact for patient obliquity.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Echo [**2144-9-7**] The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior pre-drainage study (images reviewed) of [**2144-8-24**], the pericardial effusion is smaller and tamponade physiology is no longer suggeted.
Echo [**2144-9-15**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-9-7**], there is mild global hypokinesis and a small anterior pericardial effusion.
[**2144-9-15**] CXR REASON FOR EXAM: Lymphoma, new O2 requirement.
Comparison is made to prior study [**2144-9-13**].
COMPARISONS: Comparison to CT from [**2144-9-8**], and abdominal film from [**2144-9-1**].
FINDINGS: There is marked gaseous distention of the bowel loops, similar to previous study from [**2144-9-1**].

She also suffered from infectious complications of C.Diff and a UTI with VRE which are still being treated.
Spiked temperature over 101 on [**7-31**] and was started on Cefepime and Vancomycin (day 1=[**7-31**]).
Flagyl was started on [**7-31**] as pt was found to have GNR in [**2-14**] blood cultures.
Patient was afebrile from [**8-1**] until transfer out of the ICU on [**8-7**].At time of transfer out of the ICU, patient's blood culture results were all pending (and showing NGTD) aside from GNR growth on [**7-31**].
Stool was c. Diff toxin negative on [**8-3**].
She had pulses 160s and SBP to 80s, and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Her BP stabilized while in sinus.
Her pulsus was recorded as 4 but she did have pulmonary congestion and distended neck veins.
An echo was obtained which showed RV and RA collapse w tamponade physiology.
On [**8-24**], cardiac surgery was urgently consulted following the echo that revealed significant pericardial effusion and right ventricular collapse.
She was maintained on TPN and her cardiac medications.
Her GI status continued to be a concern, as well as her skin breakdown.
She had a CT scan on [**9-8**] of her torso that showed only mild improvement in her lymphoma after chemo therapy.
She also had a decrease in the number of bowel movements, which increased in number again once her treatment was complete.
TACHYPNEA AND HYPOXIA:  Found on chest CT to have tumor causing compression not only of her SVC but also of her pulmonary arteries bilaterally which would cause the same V/Q mismatch as a PE would by decreasing her perfusion.
After initiation of chemotherapy and thoracentesis she was able to be extubated, her mental status was much improved, her O2 requirement was down from 95% face mask to 6L NC and her tachypnea resolved.
TACHYCARDIA: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with RVR with rate as high as 190s to low 200s; however, she was normotensive with these rates.
CTA negative for PE but a fib with RVR more frequent and more difficult to control prior to chemotherapy and may have been due to pulmonary artery compression causing physiology similar to PE.
After stopping the amiodarone on [**7-31**] the pt reverted back to afib with HR 110s-120s but broke again with IVF.
Off of amiodarone IV, patient's rate rose to 190 on [**8-4**].
On night of [**8-5**] patient converted to NSRat rate less than 90.
Her rate and rhythm were controlled with amiodarone and metoprolol and her tamponade was treated with a pericardial window.
Her last EKG before discharge showed mild tachycardia but sinus rhythm.
The enlarged bowel segment was originally thought to be colon and typhlitis became of concern; however, review of CT scan on [**8-2**] revealed that distention was more related to gastric distention than colonic distention.
Distention of abdomen was followed by serial exams.
Abdominal distention was markedly improved, but still present at time of patient transfer from ICU on [**8-7**].
Her ileus continued to be a problem after transfer to the BMT unit.
She was switched to NPO and started on TPN with tap water enemas per GI recommendations on [**2144-8-18**].
She remains on PO vanco, which ID recommends a 14 day course once her diarrhea is controlled and then a gradual [**Doctor Last Name 2949**].
Her stools are still intermittently a bloody jelly consistency (likely shedding of pseudomembrane), however, the volume and number of stools have improved on this treatment, until after her ICE treatment finished, at which time the number of loose stools increased again.
Her urine culture was positive for >100,000 enterococcus.
She then had another urine culture showing a UTI with E. coli and she was started on ceftriaxone.
At which time, if the patient is clinically stable a repeat urine culture should be checked.
In the past two days she has been having a decrease in her Hct, was 22.3 yesterday and had 1 unit of RBCs, was 21.6 today and received 2 units of rbcs.
Also had a potassium of 2.9 in AM, was given repletion before transfer.
Her retic count is pending and haptoglobin was 320.
