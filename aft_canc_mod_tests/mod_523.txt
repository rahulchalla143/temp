On [**7-2**], he experienced  an episode of chest pain and cardiac markers were positive (elev of Tn 0.5 and CK altho raised 10K but cardiac index 0.4).
However, he quickly reaccumulated secretions and CXR demonstrated collapsed lungs.
All BAL cultures were negative.
His blood type was O. Splenectomy was done for this reason to decrease antibodies against donor.
Plasmapheresis was done daily for 2 weeks for a total of 14 treatments.
AntiA and antiB antibody titters were monitored daily.
Liver duplex demonstrated patent vasculature with good flows.
Abdominal CT ([**7-4**]) was done for rising WBC .
On [**7-7**], a liver duplex was done for decrease in HCT.
On [**7-10**], under CT guidance, a 12 Fr pigtail drain was placed in LUQ near splenic bed.
Drain fluid culture was negative.
Potassium increased though to 5.8 on [**7-17**] for which Kayexalate was administered.
EKG was unchanged and Kayexalate was administered with potassium decrease to 5.4.
Glucoses were managed with [**Hospital1 **] Lantus (20 units) and sliding scale humalog.
C. difficile DNA amplification assay was negative on [**7-13**].
Nephrocaps 1 CAP PO DAILY 14.
Glucagon 1 mg IM Q15MIN:PRN hypoglycemia protocol 10.
OxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  2.5 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain 12.
