Labs included normal WBC and stable Hgb/Hct, elevated creatinine to 1.9 (baseline ~1.1), normal LFTs other than alkaline phosphatase 131, INR 1.3, BNP >6700, troponin 0.04, and a urinalysis with moderate leukocytes, 6 WBC/hpf, but no bacteria.
Lactate was 1.5.
Head CT was negative for acute process but +clivus bony lucency, as previously seen on MRI.
CXR showed new bilateral pleural effusions and worsening right sided opacities concerning for infection and/or progression of malignancy.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**4-/2189**]: presented to an outside hospital with severe back pain, with CXR showing right upper lobe lung mass.
PET scan revealed FDG avidity at the periphery of the mass, with an FDG-avid paratracheal lymph node - [**2189-7-31**] cervical mediastinoscopy, multiple lymph nodes neg for malignancy (report not available).
- [**2189-8-5**] transthoracic biopsy at [**Hospital1 18**], nondiagnostic.
Pt declined RUL lobectomy - [**2189-11-3**] new moderate right-sided pleural effusion; right lung nodule increased from 6.6 to 7.7 cm and was again noted to have broad contact with the chest wall - [**2189-12-2**]: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] again saw the patient and recommended a right thoracotomy and RUL lobectomy.
Surgery was scheduled but was canceled by the patient - [**2190-1-1**] chest CT revealed further increase in the known necrotic RUL lung mass, now measuring 8.1 x 7.5 cm.
- [**2190-2-4**]: A repeat bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound was performed for diagnostic purposes, with a biopsy of the right upper lobe mass revealing poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with immunostains positive for P63 and CK7 (weak), negative for TTF-1.
A transbronchial needle aspiration of station 7, 4R, and R11 lymph nodes revealed no malignant cells.
- [**2190-2-18**]: A repeat PET scan demonstrated no evidence of bony metastatic disease.
[**2190-12-7**] CT torso showing a mildly enlarged cavitating lesion in the right upper lobe, which is now 6.5 x 4.4 cm, increased from 6.3 x 3.7 cm.
[**2191-2-25**]: CT chest without contrast showing slightly enlarged right upper lung mass, measuring 7.5 x 5.2 cm, with slightly enlarged soft tissue component at the right middle lobe bronchus, measuring 3 x 3 cm [**2191-2-22**]: Palliative chemo with taxotere, with doses held due to dehydration and cytopenias.
[**2191-7-14**] CT chest: decreased size in primary mass, measuring 6.5 x 4.1 cm, as compared to 7.4 x 5.2 cm previously.
[**Date range (3) 34677**]: Hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for enterococcus mitral valve endocarditis and T12-L1 diskitis/osteomyelitis.
He had a right internal jugular  and axillary vein thrombosis, associated with his right sided port-a-cath, which was initially diagnosed at [**Hospital3 34678**] on [**2191-7-29**], and has continued on Lovenox for treatment.
He was seen by cardiology for NSVT, mitral valve endocarditis, and was started on metoprolol for rate control.
[**2191-8-2**] CT angio of the chest showed a 4.5 cm x 3 cm thick-walled mixed solid and cystic structure in the right upper lobe corresponding to interval necrosis of treated tumor.
[**2191-8-5**] MRI of the L-spine showed resolution of previously noted diskitis and osteomyelitis at T12 and L1.
[**2191-8-15**] MRI of the brain showed no intraparenchymal findings, but there was a new clivus mass, most likely representing an osseous  metastasis.
-Emphysema/COPD -right internal jugular and axillary vein thrombosis, associated with his right sided port-a-cath   Social History: [**12-27**] ppd x 30 years currently still smoking, social alcohol use, history IV heroin use and cocaine use.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the prior study (TEE - images reviewed) of [**2191-8-5**] and TTE of [**2191-7-27**], the previously seen mitral valve vegetation is not well seen on the current study (although is still likely present).
There is probably aortic regurgitation on the current study (difficult to determine severity).
He was not a candidate for permanent or temporary pacer given his bloodstream infection, and will not be until he completes his course of treatment for his blood stream infection.
Presumed source is the midline he came from rehabilitation with, which was pulled.
Repeat TTE showed probably vegetation, though difficult to discern from previous echo findings for endocarditis.
TEE was not done as he is not a candidate for cardiac surgery (as documented in chart) and the risks of the procedure were felt to outweigh the benefits).
His ventricular ectopy was controlled with metoprolol tartrate 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
BUN:creatinine ratio was suggestive of intrinsic injury, and patient volume overloaded.
