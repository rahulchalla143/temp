The patient's daughter has been draining her pleurex qod for ~400-500ccs with improvement in her respiratory status but, on the date of admission, the patient's VNA came to see her and drain her pleurex and found her sats to be in the 80s on her baseline 3L NC with SBP in the 80s as well so the patient was brought into the ED.
Upon arrival to the ED, her O2 sat was in the 80s ---> 90% on 6L NC and her BP was 74/50.
Exam was notable for lack of interaction and decreased breath sounds throughout the right lung.
Labs were notable for bandemia of 7% and leukocytosis 92k (recent baseline ~40K), creatinine 3.4 (normal baseline) and K 7.9 (repeat 8.0).
CXR was c/f worsening right sided pleural effusion.
Two 18g PIVs were placed and her pleurex was drained for 700ccs of bloody, purulent fluid.

FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):  STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary): .
[**2150-2-3**] CT Head w/o con: Comparing across modalities, the study is relatively stable compared to the very recent head MRI dated [**2150-1-29**].
# Malignant Pleural Effusion/Empyema: CXR demonstrated worsening right-sided effusion.
CT head unchanged from recent MRI.
# UTI: Urine culture is growing yeast.
Creatinine improved with fluid resuscitation.
Renal ultrasound was negative for hydronephrosis or obstruction.
Tumor lysis felt to be unlikely considering normal calcium and phos.
Potassium normalized with kayexalate and improvement in renal function.
