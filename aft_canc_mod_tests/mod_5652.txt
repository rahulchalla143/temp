In addition, the pt was persistently hypoxic with room air oxgyen saturation 90-91%, and was discharged on one liter oxygen via NC.
The pt received blood and fluids, and BP improved to 90's.
A SC CVL was placed, and urine/ blood cultures were sent.
He was started on Vanc/Zosyn/levo on admission, but he levofloxacin was discontinued on [**9-22**] as his urine legionella was negative.
He had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test in the ICU which was < 9 at 2 hours, so he was started on steroids.
These were subsequently discontinued as the patient had no evidence of sepsis and was able to maintain his blood pressure following fluid resuscitation.
By bone scan, known mets in thoracic and lumbar spine, ileums, right proximal femur, clavicles and ribs.
Now coming from NH unit at [**Location (un) **]   Family History: Brother with [**Name (NI) **] cancer  Physical Exam: T 96 PO BP 100/50 HR 88 RR 20 O2 sat 89% on RA, inc to 94% 2LNC  GEN:awake, A&OX3, thin but not cachetic.
[**2157-8-31**] LUNG SCAN: Perfusion images in the same 8 views show demonstrate subsegmental defects in the right upper lung and defects in the bases Chest x-ray shows patch infiltatrates and yesterday's CXR reveals pleural effusions.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%).
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Renal US ([**9-22**]): No evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.
CXR ([**9-20**]): Increased left retrocardiac opacity in comparison to prior exam, which may represent an area of volume loss or consolidation.
CXR ([**9-21**]): Tip of the new right subclavian line projects over the upper right atrium.
CXR ([**9-26**]): There is a thoracic scoliosis convex to the right.
The findings are similar to those noted on the prior study of [**2157-9-21**] but with probable increased patchy opacity at the right lung base.
Lower extremity ultrasound ([**9-27**]): No evidence of DVT bilaterally.
Chest CT ([**9-29**]): 1.
There are diffuse osseous sclerotic metastases, as identified on recent bone scan from [**2157-9-2**].
CXR ([**9-29**]): There is no significant change in the appearance of the normal heart and bilateral pleural effusions as well as the left lower lobe consolidation which is most likely _____ atelectasis but there is improvement of the bilateral pulmonary edema.
Renal ultrasound ([**9-30**]): 1.
Labs prior to discharge notable for platelets 46,000, WBC 12.3, creatinine 3.3, BUN 64, INR 1.6, albumin 2.8 .
Microbiology: C. diff negative X 2 Sputum culture pending but multiple organisms on gram stain from [**10-1**] MRSA in urine from [**9-20**] but not present on repeat urine culture [**9-28**]   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3314**] is an 85 yo male with history of metastatic prostate cancer, bladder varices, and chronic bladder obstruction who presents as a transfer from the MICU for hypotension, now resolved, and hematuria, thought to be chronic.
* After an extensive discussion between Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], the patient, and the patient's son, it was decided that they would not like to have any further studies or lab draws.
# Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine is climbing and was 3.3 yesterday.
He did not initially respond to fluid boluses, and we were hesitant to further diurese him due to his rapidly rising creatinine.
His oxygen requirements have also increased for unclear reasons.
It is also possible that he has some marrow infiltration, though his WBC and RBC counts are not as low as one would expect with this.
