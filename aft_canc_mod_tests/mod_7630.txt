Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-2-11**], left ventricular cavity is larger.
Biventricular systolic function (especially LV function) has significantly deteriorated.
Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2129-2-27**]):       KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE.

Brief Hospital Course: 56 y/o woman with CLL s/p 4 cycles of [**Hospital1 **] treatment on Neupogen s/p febrile neutropenia and septic shock requiring [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay, [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course described below per day:  In the ED T 102.9, P170, BP 113/65, 100% on RA.
While there her BP dropped to 74/33, T to 106.6.
She received 8L NS, cefepime 2gm, vancomycin 1gm, caspo 70, platelets 2u, and decadron 10mg.
She was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU, central access obtained, received an additional 10L of fluid, required 3 pressors to maintain MAP > 60.
Was weaned off pressors on [**2-25**] with MAP > 65.
Her blood cultures grew Klebsiella on [**2129-2-24**].
C. difficile toxin negative x 2, O&P negative x 3, UCx w/NGTD on [**2-24**] and [**2-25**].
In addition, a new echo was done which demonstrated LVEF of 21% with severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction, a deterioration from echo on [**2129-2-11**].
[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**] ====================== [**2129-2-25**] -Initially was on three pressors but weaned off over the course of the day with preservation of MAP's >65 -Blood cultures with GNR's, caspofungin discontinued (OK w/ hematology and oncology) -Echo showed new LV dysfunction with LVEF 20% per echo (new since [**2129-2-11**]) -Had hematochezia and AM Hct 24 and Plt 9.
-GNR from admission blood cx ([**2129-2-24**]) are pan sensitive but not yet speciated.
On cefepime, gent, vanco -Low UOP to 40cc/ 3 hrs in evening but CVP 14.
Deferred giving more fluids for now -Got 2 units plt with plt 9-32 but with 1 u PRBCS Hct only from 24.4- 24.7.
Defer colonoscopy to outpatient setting unless bleeding increases.
-Heme onc: Continue GCSF, give IVIG for sepsis in setting of CLL and hypogammaglobulinemia, aggressive platelet goals given hematochezia w/ plts>50K -Transfused 1 bag platelets -ID: stool studies for salmonella, shigella, e.coli 0157, yersinia; abdominal CT to r/o abscess in setting of GNR sepsis (we didn't order this because of the patient's questionable renal fxn in setting of decreased urine output and b/c our suspicion was low); hold gent until level comes back.
Gent level was 3.9 so gent d/c'd for now before 3rd dose, abdominal CT -d/c'd vancomycin, foley and a. line -Hematochezia decreased in volume and rate -episodes of brady to 40, sinus w/ no evidence of 1st degree/2nd degree heart block, she says she has a history of this, remains asymptomatic (no syncope in past) =================================================  # CLL s/p SCT: Pt.
Hct relatively stable throughout course, never symptomatic clinically.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Upon arrival, you were transferred to the ICU where they did several blood tests and gave you several units of blood, platelets, and fluid.
Upon arrival to the BMT floor, your counts were relatively stable, and it was decided that you might have a colonoscopy with polyp removal when your counts come up.
