His initial presentation was concerning for fulminant hepatic failure and transplant workup was initiated.
However, INR of 20 improved dramatically with vitamin K and was felt to be secondary to coumadin.
He also had CT which showed acute calculous cholecystitis and is s/p percutaneous cholecystostomy.
He grew pan sensitive E Coli from his blood cultures and his bile grew Ecoli, serratia, clostridium perfringens and bacterioides fragilis.
# cholecystits with ecoli bacteremia he will continue cipro flagyl until surgery.
**We have recommended to the surgeons a liver biopsy at time of cholecystectomy to rule out intrinsic disease.
**  # Acute renal failure Creatinine 7.3 on admission and BUN 251.
Likely was secondary to INR 20.
