LTAC reported that J tube was leaky and patient subsequently underwent 2 revisions on [**5-20**] and [**5-29**] by general surgery at OSH.
Pigtail catheter fell out yesterday however repeat CT showed interval improvement of pleural effusion.

The heart and pericardium are unremarkable with physiologic pleural fluid.
Small left pleural effusion is seen and improved from the prior study with improved aeration of the left lower lobe.
Though the indication describes a left-sided empyema what appears to be a loculated air-fluid collection in the prior study in the right pleural space is improved on the current examination resembling a partially loculated right pleural effusion which is small and simple in appearance.
Evaluation for empyema is limited by non-contrast technique.
Though this study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, limited upper abdominal evaluation demonstrates numerous surgical clips compatible with history of gastrectomy and Billroth II reconstruction.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**6-15**]: FINDINGS: The heart is enlarged.
Consolidation is observed in the superior segment of the right lower lobe with air bronchogram which is highly suspicious for aspiration pneumonia.
ABDOMEN: Many artifacts due to retained contrast media from previous fluoroscopic examination and from many surgical clips.
Tubular air filled structures that branch are seen on series 2, image 75, free air cannot be ruled out definitely.
fractures of ribs 10, 9, 8, 7 and 6 on the left side some of them with calus and some may be acute.
Air-filled tubular structure within the right lower quadrant, cannot rule out free air we recommend further clinical follow up or an interval CT examination with oral contrast ( through J tube ).
Echo ([**6-17**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-2-28**], left ventricular systolic function is now slightly less vigorous.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 y/o M with h/o malnutrition requiring J-tube with recent respiratory failure from aspiration PNA c/b MRSA empyema now s/p tracheostomy transferred with J-tube evaluation found to have profound malnutrition who clinically deteriorated during MICU stay and after multiple family meetings was ultimately made CMO.
# MICU Course: Patient was transferred to the MICU for evaluation of J tube.
