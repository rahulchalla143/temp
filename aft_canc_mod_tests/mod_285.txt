On the day of presentation, [**2142-6-11**], the patient was at his [**Hospital **] Clinic appointment where he was found to be dyspneic with just short walking and found to have an oxygen saturation of 83% on room air.
Of note, just one month prior in clinic, the patient had an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air.
Mr. [**Known lastname 8040**] was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] Emergency Department, where his breathing became more labored requiring 100% nonrebreather, which resulted in an oxygen saturation in the low 90s.
His initial vitals were as follows:  Temperature of 98.1.
Heart rate of 76.
Blood pressure 160/80.
Respiratory rate of 14.
His oxygen saturation was in the low 90s with 100% nonrebreather.
He had diffuse rhonchi and crackles on his lung exam and evidence of volume overload on physical examination.
His chest x-ray demonstrated findings consistent with congestive heart failure, bilateral pleural effusion, bibasilar collapse, consolidation, and mediastinal hilar lymphadenopathy with diffuse bilateral small nodules, consistent with metastatic disease.
A repeat chest x-ray revealed worsening pulmonary edema consistent with congestive heart failure.
Patient's blood pressure also rose to 230/120 requiring intravenous nitroglycerin drip.
Renal cell carcinoma was discovered during a work-up for abdominal pain in [**2135-5-30**], which revealed bilateral renal masses.
CT and MI scan revealed 3 cm mass in left upper pole and a 4 cm mass in upper right pole and patient is now status post left partial nephrectomy for cancer treatment as of [**2135-6-30**].
MI and MRA of the head showed small vessel disease and evidence for an old left-sided cerebral infarction.
This work-up was done on previous admissions.
His vitals were a temperature of 98.1.
Heart rate of 76.
Blood pressure 160/80 with intermittent rise to systolic blood pressure of 230 and a respiratory rate of 14.
His initial weight was approximately 73 kg.
His head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.
Jugular venous pressure was 8-9 cm and no thyromegaly was noted.
Pulmonary chest exam:  Rhonchi on expiration bilaterally with mild crackles, left greater than right.
Abdominal exam:  Nondistended, positive bowel sounds, soft and nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's initial CBC showed white blood cell count of 8.0, hematocrit 38.0, and a platelet count of 280.
His Chem-7 demonstrated sodium of 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 92, bicarbonate 35, BUN of 34, creatinine 7.2 and blood sugar of 111.
His first CK enzyme came back 65 which was within normal limits.
His first troponin T came back as 0.21.
Third set was 0.27.
Fourth set was 0.22 and a fifth set was 0.19.
His calcium level was 9.0, phosphate of 4.4 and magnesium of 1.9.
His blood gas was shown to have PO2 of 38, pCO2 of 41, and a pH of 7.56.
His lactate level was 1.0.
His first chest x-ray revealed findings consistent with previous heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions, bibasilar collapsing consolidation in mediastinal hilar lymphadenopathy with diffuse bilateral small nodules consistent with metastases.
The patient also had an electrocardiogram done which showed no acute changes from previous studies.
An echocardiogram on [**6-12**] demonstrated left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55% and a small right to left intracardiac shunt, most likely consistent with atrial septal defect.
Shortness of breath:  The patient was transferred to the floor on the day of admission for further care and management, however, after a couple hours, he complained of increased dyspnea on exertion and had an oxygen saturation of approximately 80% on 100% nonrebreather with systolic blood pressure in the 160s.
He was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further treatment.
At the Medical Intensive Care Unit, Mr. [**Known lastname 8040**] was continued on oxygen saturation with nonrebreather and face tent.
At admission, he was ruled out for PE with CT angiogram.
On [**6-14**], the patient received another hemodialysis session with 2.6 kg of fluid removed to a dry weight of 66 kg and Epogen administered.
His most recent echocardiogram was otherwise normal except for a mild right to left shunt atrial septal defect and his latest electrocardiogram indicated a possible new T wave inversion, however, Cardiology Consult was requested and the evaluation indicated no evidence of myocardial infarction or acute myocardial ischemia process, instead, they felt the electrocardiogram was consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy strain patterns.
Patient's shortness of breath continued to improve to the point where his oxygen saturation on room air was 92%.
Coronary disease/Cardiovascular:  Patient's blood pressure on initial examination at the Emergency Department was a systolic blood pressure as high at 230, however, a nitroglycerin drip was able to control his blood pressure throughout the Medical Intensive Care Unit course and his medication was adjusted with increase in Lopressor and hydralazine dosage throughout the Medical Intensive Care Unit course helped keep his blood pressure in the 140s to 150s.
His troponin and CKs were within his baseline.
His troponin T was in the low 0.20 range, however, this has been his consistent levels throughout this hospital course with no acute rises throughout this admission.
His electrocardiogram was consistent with a left ventricular hypertrophy pattern, but showed no acute evidence of acute myocardial infarction or process.
Hemodialysis sessions were done twice with total removal of approximately 6.6 kg of fluid.
