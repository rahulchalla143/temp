QNS FOR VIRAL CULTURES Reported to and read back by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ON       [**2157-4-25**] AT 08:54 AM..     GRAM STAIN (Final [**2157-4-23**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2157-4-26**]):       >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.
Given persistant fevers and lack of source, CT Torso was performed [**2157-4-19**] and showed a right upper lobe pneumonia that was new from her last scan in [**Month (only) 404**].
Bronchoscopy was attempted, but could not be done in the procedure suite as there was significant narrowing of the trachea from compression by her goiter.
Fever curve trended downwards, but serial chest xray showed interval increase in the size of the PNA.
Bronchoscopy performed which showed [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 34122**] drainage.
Gram stain showed gram positive rods which were likely [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13607**], negative for PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] culture was added on and results were pending at the time of death.
Her sodium improved mildly however she became anuric and free water could not be mobilized.
# Acute renal insufficiency: Creatinine trended up on [**2157-4-23**] believed to be related to a combination of AML and ATN from nephrotoxic antibiotics.
Renal ultrasound was negative.
Creatinine continued to rise and the patient became anuric.
She was ransfused intermittently for platelets < 10 and Hct < 25. .
