<br> Shock: Ddx includes cardiogenic, distributive/sepsis and hyovolemia, adrenal insufficiency Cardiogenic The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and ECG changes were concerning for cardiac ischemia.
Cardiac tamponade was ruled out by a negative US.
Her hemodynamic instability precluded CT scanning to evaluate for PE.
The source of bleeding was unclear at this point since her NG lavage was clear, FAS scanning was negative for blood or pericardial effusion.
We thought that her respiratory distress was multifactorial in etiology probably secondary to  severe COPD/bronchitis with restrictive and obstructive defect noted on recent PFTS along with new diffuse consolidations/infiltrates * Acute Renal insufficiency: This was thought to be pre-renal in etiology given her current hypotension.
* GERD: PPI * Osteoporosis - calcium and vit D * Disposition: Given the patient's grave prognosis, a family meeting was held and the patient's family decided that she would not have wanted to be ventilator dependent and thus she was made CMO and terminally extubated and pressors were held.
