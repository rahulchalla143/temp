Menorrhagia labs were drawn and were essentially negative except mildly elevated prolactin which was repeated and noted to be within normal limits when fasting.
Preoperative endometrial biopsy was benign.
Different treatment options were discussed and the patient opted to proceed with surgical management with a diagnostic laparoscopy for possible total laparoscopic hysterectomy and RSO but understood that there was a likely risk of conversion to a laparotomy given her prior abdominal history and pelvic exam suggesting an enlarged 14 to 16 size fibroid uterus.
BP is 140/82, weight 216.5 pounds, height 5 feet 5 inches.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
No palpable adnexal masses; however, the exam is quite limited due to the patient's body habitus.
On speculum exam, the cervix again is tilted quite posteriorly from the anterior fibroids and quite high, the vaginal vault also tight.

After transfer out of the ICU and with stable blood pressures on the floor, home medication was re-started.
Hypothyroidism Was not an issue during this hospitalization; home medication was continued.
