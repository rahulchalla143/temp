On the day of admission, he presented to an opthalmologist who performed a dialated exam and determined that his vision loss was not related to a primary occular lesion and recommended presentation to the ED.
CT head showed progression of known left occipital/parietal mass with worsening hemorrheage and edema (compared with MRI [**12-13**].

[**3-16**] Admission CT Head: New intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema and mass effect centered on previous left median occipital lobe metastasis.
[**3-16**] Repeat CT Head: 1.
[**2119-3-20**]: MR HEAD: IMPRESSION: The left parietooccipital hemorrhage is grossly similar in size compared with the CT of the head performed [**2119-3-16**].
Head CT on admission was remarkable for an enlarged edematous and hemorrhagic mass extending into the occipital and parietal lobes, which explained right homonymous hemianopsia.
He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and monitored with serial neuro checks.
Head CT was repeated which showed no progression for hemorrheage/edema.
His blood pressure was initially controlled with a Nicardipine gtt (goal sBP 120-140) and his head of bed was maintained >30 degrees.
Repeat CT head imaging was stable.
Repeat MRI on [**2119-3-20**] showed stable intracranial process.
# Hypertension: Given concern for acute hemorrheage we aimed to maintain SBP 120-140.
This was initially achieved with a Nicardipine gtt, which was turned off on hospital day 2.
He was also initially continued on his outpatient Metoprolol Tartrate 50 [**Hospital1 **], which was held in the setting of starting Nimodipine for vasospasm to prevent relative hypotension.
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds were negative for DVT.
His O2 saturations remained adequate on room air.
He was bolused 500 cc of NS and repeat electrolytes revealed improvement in creatinine.
His creatinine remained stable for the rest of his hospital stay.
Serum cortisol was normal.
Urine lytes revealed sodium avidity with a highly concentrated urine, likely a mixed picture (dehydration with underlying SIADH).
# Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: Patient diagnosed with RCC after biopsy of metastatic pulmonary lesion.
Admission chest xray showed worsening of pulmonary metastatic disease.
