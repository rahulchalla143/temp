Unable to obtain detailed history from patient or from rehab facility, found to have sat of 81% and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for hypoxia.
He was placed on a nonrebreather for O2 sat in the 70s which dropped to 50% so he was intubated soon after arrival.
He was also noted to be febrile to 101, with HR 146, BP 133/87 and was started on vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin after obtaining blood cx, CXR with bilateral infiltrates.
Also noted on EKG to have lateral depressions with sinus tachycardia so was given rectal aspirin.
INR 4.8.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2126-6-16**]):       >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):  Legionella negative Blood cultures NGTD Urine cultures NGTD  IMAGING: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2126-6-14**] 2:14 PM FINDINGS: There is a dense right perihilar consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2126-6-15**] 5:21 AM Significant interval progression of widespread parenchymal consolidations may represent interval development of severe pulmonary edema superimposed on pre-existing right lower lobe consolidation.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 yo M with h/o CHF, Afib on coumadin, CHF, AR s/p mechanical AVR, severe MR, Alzheimer's disease p/w hypoxia, respiratory distress, bilateral infiltrates on CXR, elevated lactate and Cr improving with IVF, hypotension now on pressors, also with anemia  Patient with evidence of PNA on chest xray with bilateral infiltrates, started on vanco/zosyn/levofloxacin in ED.
Sputum cultre showed GNR preliminarily and urine legionella was negative, blood cultures showed no growth to date.
On day of admission, patient was transfused 3 units of PRBC for a Hct 20 (unclear baseline but on discharge from [**Hospital1 2177**] 2 days prior to admission Hct 25).
Aspirin was continued considering trop elevation and ischemic changes likely in setting of demand on admission EKG, but discontinued when INR elevated to 7.8.
Patient was able to be weaned off pressors and appearance of CXR showed mild improvement.
