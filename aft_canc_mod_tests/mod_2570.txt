Initial EKGs showed ST elevations in II,III,AVF concerning for inferior STEMI so pt was taken emergently to catheterization lab where 100% thrombotic proximal occlusion to large dominant RCA was seen.
Pt was in cardiogenic shock on arrival to cath lab w/ BP ~80s.
Cath showed R-dominant system w/ 100% prox thrombotic occlusion in RCA and 90% culprit stenosis in proximal to mid vessel treated with single BMS.
On arrival to CCU, pt was intubated but not sedated, unresponsive to commands or painful stimuli, had bilateral fixed blown pupils, mottled skin, and cold extremities.
ABG on arrival: 7.05/33/65 on PS 5/5 w/ FIO2 100%.
An MRI of the abdomen on [**2100-6-6**] showed fatty infiltration of the liver, but no evidence of metastatic disease.
Pathology showed goblet cell carcinoma in the mesenteric fat and a <2 mm focus of GIST in the cecal wall near appendiceal stump.
A colonoscopy on [**2104-2-18**] showed a partially circumferential 3-cm mass located 11-13 cm proximal to the anus which appeared to be a metastatic lesion growing through the bowel rather than a primary lesion.
A CT scan of the abdomen on [**2104-2-24**] revealed peritoneal carcinomatosis most evident in the omentum, a small amount of ascites, and rectal wall thickening consistent with the mass seen on colonoscopy.
A chest x-ray on [**2-27**] was negative, and on [**2104-2-29**], a percutaneous biopsy of an omental lesion revealed moderately differentiated metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma, consistent with metastatic colon cancer.
