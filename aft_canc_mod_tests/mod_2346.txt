In the Emergency Department, she was noted to have an elevated white blood count of 48, with a right upper quadrant ultrasound suggesting liver metastases.
Abdominal CT scan confirmed liver metastases with a right colonic mass.
Her urinalysis was consistent with a urinary tract infection, and she was started on a course of Levaquin.
On [**2113-2-6**], the patient underwent a colonoscopy which revealed a mass in the distal ascending colon and diverticulosis of the descending colon/proximal sigmoid colon.
The patient's white blood count continued to rise over the course of the next several days, from 48 on admission to 65.
Her peripheral blood smear was thought to be consistent with a reactive leukocytosis.
From [**2-9**] to [**2-11**], the patient's creatinine was noted to rise from 1.1 to 1.9.
Her white blood count continued to rise, as did her serum lactate level.
Her lungs remained clear, and her respiratory rate was noted to be increased secondary to compensation for her worsening lactic metabolic acidosis.
Her urine lytes suggested a pre-renal picture.
She was sent for an abdominal CT.
While in the CT scanner, she complained of increased respiratory distress and was ultimately intubated and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Osteoarthritis 2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, vital signs:  Temperature 97.6, pulse 108, blood pressure 70/30, respiratory rate 18, pulse oxygenation 100% on the ventilator.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light, sclerae slightly icteric, conjunctiva noninjected.
Ventilator settings:  SIMV with pressure support of 5, tidal volume 600, respiratory rate 20, PEEP of 5, FIO2 of 1.
White blood count 68, hematocrit 34, platelets 273.
Sodium 134, potassium 4.0, chloride 93, bicarbonate 18, BUN 40, creatinine 1.6, glucose 92.
Urinalysis showed large blood, negative nitrite, 30 protein, negative glucose, trace ketones, small bilirubin, 4 urobilinogen, small leukocytes.
INR 2.5.
ALT 62, AST 76, alkaline phosphatase 765, total bilirubin 4.7.
Urine sodium less than 10, urine creatinine 135, urine osmolality 406.
CEA 15, lactate 6.2, CA-19-9 pending.
Chest x-ray showed no acute process.
CT scan of the abdomen revealed evidence of an umbilical hernia, but no evidence of free air, obstruction, or abdominal perforation, no evidence of biliary dilatation or cholangitis.
Blood cultures from earlier in the admission were pending or negative.
Urine cultures were pending.
Stool cultures were positive for C. difficile on [**2113-2-6**].
Pathology from [**2113-2-7**] revealed invasive adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated.
Her blood pressure initially responded to volume and low-dose dopamine.
She remained hypotensive, requiring more aggressive pressor support, despite a jugular venous pressure of 10 to 12.
Although CT scan had initially been negative for abdominal perforation or free air, the patient's belly became increasingly distended, and it was thought that she most likely developed sepsis and acidosis from intra-abdominal perforation.
The patient was unable to maintain mean arterial pressures greater than 30 to 40 on the final day or two of her hospitalization.
Urine cultures just prior to her death were positive for enterococcus.
Her hematocrit remained stable, without any recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound and CT scan showed no evidence of ductal obstruction or abscess.
Blood cultures remained negative.
Her persistently elevated white blood count was attributed to her C. difficile colitis vs. leukemoid reaction vs. sepsis.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was hypovolemic by examination.
Peripheral vasodilation unable to support, and we were unable to support her blood pressure with fluids or pressors.
We tried to keep her alive with pressors until the rest of her family could arrive, but the patient coded from cardiac arrest and was not resuscitated.
