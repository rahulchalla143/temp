At the rehab, vitals were reportedly T 100.4, HR 107, BP 92/42.
ED course: T 100.6, EKG NSR at 83 w/ TWF, received vancomycin, cefepime and IVF.
CT head was negative for an acute process.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGY HISTORY: [**2108**]: Stage II right sided, invasive ductal adenocarcinoma, ER-/Her2+ on initial core biopsy (done [**2108-1-17**]), but ER-/HER2NEGATIVE on the excised breast specimen done [**2108-2-17**] (please see below).
She was given a course of antibiotics and nasal sprays with no resolution.
CT sinus/mandible scan on [**2119-1-26**] showed an irregular lucency in the right mandibular ramus.
A PET scan on [**2119-2-10**] showed a left lower lobe lung mass, a left pleural lesion, a dome of the liver lesion and the right mandibular ramus.
On [**2119-2-13**], the left lung lesion was biopsied and showed adenocarcinoma with immunostaining positive for Cytokeratin 7 in the tumor cells, but negative for cytokeratin 20, CDX-2, TTF-1, Mammoglobin, GCDFP, ER and PR immunostains.
Her recent chemotherapy treatment history follows:  METASTATIC CANCER TREATMENT HX FIRST LINE THERAPY: [**2119-2-20**]: Started on trial 09-312; This is a Phase 3 Randomized Study of Gemcitabine and Carboplatin with or without BSI201 in patients with triple negative metastatic breast cancer.
[**Male First Name (un) **] was randomized to Arm B: Gemcitabine, Carboplatin, and BSI201; [**2119-3-10**] - Cycle 1 D1 Completed 9 cycles, stopped due to progression; Patient did have treatment delays and dose reductions due to thrombocytopenia-ENDED [**2119-10-20**] SECOND LINE THERAPY: Paclitaxel 80mg/m2 weekly, 3 week on/1 week off.

started empirically on vanc/cefepime and pancultured but no obvious source for infection was found, cultures were neg, and CXR negative initially.
CXR showed new area suspicious for pneumonia so coverage broadened to vanc/zosyn to cover anaerobes.
ANC was much improved at that time (up to 2139 from 216 the day prior) so her poor saturation was thought to be secondary to mounted immune response to pneumonia that was present.
Hct was 21.5 upon admission but decreased to 20.1 during course of admission, prompting transfusion of 1 unit PRBC.
