He says that he has had surgery in the past, and has seen multiple surgeons for  While in the ED, triage vitals were T99F, BP 170/117, HR 110, RR 14, Sat 97%.
CXR and CTA showed no obvious etiology.
He is quite concerned about the "tumors" in his back (epidural lipomatosis), but his most recent MRI shows no evidence of cord compression.

Short-term PA and lateral confirmatory radiographs should be performed.
MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE: Vertebral body height, signal, and alignment are preserved.
Sag T2 weighted images of the cervical spine demonstrate normal sagittal alignment and no cord signal abnormality.
MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE: Vertebral body height and sagittal alignment are preserved.
An MRI was performed that showed no evidence of fluid collection or infectious spinal process or any other process requiring acute intervention.
Blood gas in the ICU was consistent with chronic respiratory acidosis.
As part of evaluation for muscle weakness and myalgia CK have been monitored.
His CK went from 100s (normal) on [**2110-5-2**] to 4500 on [**2110-5-6**].
It is possible that he developed rhabdomylosis in the setting of being obtunded and not mobile for >24 hours although renal function was at baseline at that time and electrolytes were largely normal (urine myoglobin pending at d/c).
An infectious myopathy, such as a viral illness, was considered given his fever and reports of malaise and myalgia/arthralgia.
His exam was not consistent with septic joints and blood cultures were negative.
The CK was trending down to 3400 at discharge.
He will follow up with his PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 2974**] to get his CK and chem-10 checked.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: His creatinine increased from baseline of 1 to 1.8 also with evidence of urinary retention.
Urinalysis showed trace blood with normal culture.
PNEUMONIA: The patient had was found to have a perihilar infiltrate on his chest film when he was being evaluated for altered mental status and fever.
HYPOTHYROID: TSH was borderline high and T4 was pending on discharge.
Bacteremia and possible septic joint considered given joint pain and fever but blood cultures no growth to date and exam was not consistent with infectious etiology.
An x-ray showed degenerative changes.
# NOTE: The Chest CTA showed pulmonary nodules that needs to be followed up with interval CT as he is a smoker and at risk for cancer.
