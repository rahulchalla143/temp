Patient's    urine culture grew out levofloxacin-resistant    Enterococcus, and the patient was given ampicillin    beginning on [**6-3**].
The patient spiked a fever on [**6-3**], and his blood cultures were sent, which the next day    came back as gram-positive cocci in the blood.
Speciation and sensitivities from the blood culture    revealed Enterococcus that was sensitive to both    ampicillin and vancomycin, and the patient was therefore    changed back from vancomycin to ampicillin IV.
Patient's white blood cell count also had trended up to 21 with a left shift on [**6-3**], but then slowly trended back down.
MRA of the brain    on [**5-31**] showed microvascular changes, but no acute    process.
