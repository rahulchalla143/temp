He had two follow-up CT scans which showed no evidence of any recurrence or residual tumor.
He then had a follow-up MRI scan of the head which showed a recurrence of the left frontal meningioma which was approximately 8 cm in its largest diameter.
For that reason, the patient was initially sent to [**Hospital6 15291**] for an angiogram and embolization of the tumor.
At his previous surgery, it was noted that the patient was quite sensitive to Dilantin; he would become overly sedated on levels that were barely therapeutic.
A follow-up Dilantin level was only 5.2.
