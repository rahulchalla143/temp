Studies: CT chest [**2139-10-21**]: 1.
CXR [**2139-10-21**]: 1.
ECHO [**2139-7-27**]: 1.
Left ventricular systolic function is normal  (LVEF>55%).
Likely secondary to PNA seen on CXR however need to consider biliary source given pancreatic cancer with previous biliary obstruction requiring stent placement.
TBili increased to 6.5 from 1.0, AP increased from 590 to 790 from yesterday.
- s/p 3 liters NS with good BP, will hold off on additional fluid hydration given mild CHF and pleural effusions seen on CXR  - will obtain CT abd with oral contrast to evaluate for evidence of infection; may need ERCP to evaluate biliary stent placement - will start Vanco and Zosyn (previous culture data from cholangitis revealed Enterococcus and Pseudomonas sensitive to vanco and zosyn) - control fever with tylenol - monitor blood and urine culture .
ABG with PO2 of 168 on NRB.
CT negative for PE.
- dilt gtt for rate control - wean O2 as tolerated .
- control rate with dilt gtt .
- continue to cycle cardiac enzymes - monitor on tele - will d/c heparin gtt as likely demand ischemia - continue ASA .

COMPARISON: CT angiogram chest dated [**2139-7-24**].
AP upright portable chest x-ray dated [**2139-10-21**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT imaging of the chest was performed before and after the administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray.
CT ANGIOGRAM CHEST: There are no filling defects within the pulmonary arteries to suggest the presence of a pulmonary embolism.
On lung windows, pleural-based nodules are seen within bilateral lung apices posteriorly, which are stable in size and appearance since prior exam.
Limited imaging of the abdomen reveals new air within the biliary ductal system, presumably related to patient's interval biliary stent exchange.
Correlate clinically to determine if further evaluation by MR exam (or intra-esophageal ultrasound) should be considered.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis without intravenous contrast.
The lung bases show large bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
Diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis is seen throughout the large bowel, most predominantly within the sigmoid colon.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The rectum is unremarkable.
CT REFORMATS: Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial findings.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Medications: Midazolam 8 mg Fentanyl 100 micrograms  ASA Class: P3 Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The patient was placed in the prone position and an endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced under direct visualization until the second part of the duodenum was reached.
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal  Other Multiple elevated erosions suspicious for malignant involvement of the duodenum.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification.
# Cholangitis - Found by CT scan, blood cultures negative.
#Elevated LFTs - elevated during acute illness after ERCP.
Trending of enzymes showed graduall decrease back to baseline.
#Aortic stenosis - heard on exam and seen on echo in [**7-17**].
