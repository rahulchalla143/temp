Pt was noted to have fever to 102 and tachypnea (vent was on PS) beginning ~1 day PTA so was sent to ED (initially [**Hospital3 **] Hospital then [**Hospital1 18**] @ family request) where CXR revealed PNA.
<br> In ED here, WBC 26 with 10 bands, lactate 1.6.
SBP was initially stable in 100s but decreased to 70-80s despite 2L NS so started on neosynephrine.

RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 13.2 cm and appears normal without evidence of stones, mass or hydronephrosis.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not  be determined.

WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2175-2-20**]):       ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII.
TIGECYCLINE MIC= 12UG/ML.
Bacteremia: Early Blood Cx ([**2-11**]) during this hospital course grew out [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans [**2-14**] so he was started on caspofungin & switched to fluconazole for 2 week course.
TTE & TEE without evidence of vegetations, and optho exam without lesions.
ECG unremarkable.
Echocardiogram revealed EF 65%.
His EF was 44% pre-CABG, but most recent echo demonstarted preserved systolic function with evidence of impaired relaxation.
CHF: Most recent echo thought c/w impaired relaxation.
Despite his family's argument's, pt showed no signs of bronchospasm off steroids and remained hemodymically stable.
He was off steroids for a large majority of week of [**3-27**] but when developed new fevers, and hypotension on [**4-2**], was restarted on hydrocortisone.
His blood pressures improved and he has been tolerating a steroid wean well.
LUL LUNG NODULE: this was first noted in CT chest [**12-5**] (had increased from 6 mm ?
It was later noted to have increased to 13 mm by CT & MRI [**2175-1-18**] and [**2175-1-24**].
Repeat chest imaging on [**3-13**] demonstrated further increase in nodule size from previous examinations.
Thoracics surgery was consulted for consideration of biopsy but given location and pt's complex chest anatomy advised against further evaluation via biopsy.
Family had requested head CT which was unrevealing for evidence of mets.
Not unreasonable to repeat chest CT in near future although at this point, pt is unfortunately a poor candidate for either surgical or chemotherapy.
It was relayed to family that this evaluation should be placed on the side while patient tries to overcome his other serious illnesses.
He is currently receiving epogen and iron although iron studies c/w anemia of chronic dz.
