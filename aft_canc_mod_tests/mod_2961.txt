He slowly began having difficulty with oxygenation on [**2107-5-11**], where he dropped his O2 saturation to 86% and his respiratory rate rise to 40.
At that time, his white blood cell count rose to 15.5.
His physical examination was unremarkable.
He had multiple blood cultures drawn at that time for the respiratory difficulty which ended up being negative throughout.
He had a CT scan which ultimately showed no new infarctions or lesions.
CT scan two days earlier was negative.
His white blood cell count continued to be elevated during this time, reaching a high of 37.5.
Ultimately, this Candidal infection was determined to be [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] and it was decided that upon further work-up that he would require a 28 day course of AmBisome.
His white count rose as stated previously, to a high of 37.6 on postoperative day ten and one, and after the washout it continued to be elevated, however, slowly trended down .
At the time of discharge, his white blood count was 14.0 and he had multiple blood cultures, port cultures and PICC line cultures, which were all negative for anything.
He also had an echocardiogram which revealed no vegetations on his valves and an Ophthalmology examination which was also negative for embolic events.
His white count had decreased down to 18 at this time and he was started on a clear liquid diet as well as continuing on his total parenteral nutrition.
Blood cultures, urine cultures, port cultures, were all negative after the original blood and Operating Room culture were positive for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**].
On [**2107-5-26**], after multiple cultures were negative and no bacteria were discovered, the Zosyn was stopped and he was continued only on his [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**].
The patient was also transfused two units of blood on [**2107-5-28**], postoperative days 19 and 10, for a low hematocrit of 25.6.
His wound, which was left open after the second operation, was packed with normal saline wet-to-dry dressing.
He continued to have an elevated respiratory rate up into the 20s and 30s, even at time of discharge, and a heart rate that was tachycardic to the low 100s; however, his O2 saturations were normal at 98% and the patient was able to ambulate and tolerate exercise.
The patient's pulmonary status was good, however,there was a small right pleural effusion noted on chest x-ray which was decreasing in size.
Urine cultures were negative and the patient was watched carefully for this.
His white blood cell count as noted before, was returning to normal with the last one being 14.7.
His hematocrit after his transfusions stabilized at approximately 30.0 and his platelet count was normal at 230.
His electrolytes were all within normal limits.
His creatinine was watched carefully for the long duration of his AmBisome treatment.
His discharging creatinine was 1.2, up ever so slightly from his baseline of 1.0.
His liver function tests were all within normal limits.
His alkaline phosphatase was 218 and his ALT and AST were normal.
His total bilirubin was also normal at 0.3.
Status post exploratory laparotomy washout and removal of infusion port.
NOTE:  A copy of the patient's chart as well as copy of all radiologic reports and culture data will be included in his discharge packet.
