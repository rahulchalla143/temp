Further workup revealed poorly differentiated NSCLC.
An MRI of the brain and bone scan were reportedly negative but PET scan showed increased uptake in the left lung as well as numerous chest lymph node regions.
A bronchoscopy was performed this afternoon prior to transfer and showed a large area of endobronchial mass and obstruction.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation by IP.
NSCLC dx [**10/2183**] - stage IIIB versus IV (unclear if uptake in adrenals is metastatic disease).
Family History: Father died of prostate cancer (metastatic to bone); morther died of stroke at age 66   Physical Exam: Physical Exam: Vitals - BP 104/70, HR 82, RR 19, O2 94% RA HEENT - PERRL, EOMI, oropharynx clear Neck - supple, no palpable lymphadenopathy Heart - RRR, no murmur appreciated Lungs - decreased breath sounds throughout left lung Abdomen - soft, NT/ND Ext - no edema, pulses 2+ bilaterally   Pertinent Results: OSH Imaging: [**2183-12-13**] CTA Chest - No evidence of pulmonary embolism; Near complete collapse of the left lung.
[**2183-12-15**] CXR - complete opacification at the left hemithoax is again seen with shift in the mediastinum to the left consistent with obstuctive pneumonitis with collapse demonstrated on recent chest CT scan.
OSH Micro: [**2183-12-13**] Blood - no growth to date   Brief Hospital Course: 53 yo F recently diagnosed with NSCLC in [**11-5**] now with obstructing mass in left brochus.
FEN - NPO after MN for procedure in AM, replete lytes PRN PPx - pneumoboots (holding on SQ heparin given recent hemoptysis), ppi Code - Full Access - port Dispo - ICU for now pending plan by IP  The patient was soon found to be stable for a floor transfer and was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] on the evening for [**2183-12-16**] after appropriate observation and evaluation by Interventional Pulmonolgy.
The interventional pulmonologists performed a rigid bronchoscopy and debridement of the left mainstem bronches under general anesthesia.
