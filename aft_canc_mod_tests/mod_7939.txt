His biopsy showed just an adenoma.
His previous biopsy was complicated by significant bleeding.
We did check the CEA, which was slightly elevated at 4.9.
We did an MRI of the pelvis which most of the time tend to be one of the best studies which we can get, however, in his case because of absence of any fat in his body, it was really not diagnostic.
He underwent an ultrasound today which was also very difficult, but showed may be a T2 lesion at best but some areas cannot be really well evaluated.
