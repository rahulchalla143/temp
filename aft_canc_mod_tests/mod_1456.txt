Compared to the previous tracing of [**2166-9-17**] the findings are similar.
[**9-16**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the pre-existing left pleural effusion has decreased.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year-old M with CLL, CKD, DMII presents with dyspnea and weakness found to have elevated lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis with electrolyte abnormalities, likely secondary to leukemoid reaction to CAP and acute on chronic kidney injury, s/p short MICU course where he received emergent dialysis to correct metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities .
His fever curve trended down and his leukocytosis improved.
A vitamin D level is pending.
He presented with cervical lymphadenopathy, a lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis, elevated LDH, and electrolyte abnormalities, which were concerning for [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] transformation to lymphoma with tumor lysis syndrome.
# Coronary Artery Disease: The patient had elevated CK & Troponin T on admission, flat CKMB, likely related to increased demand and decreased clearance of enzymes in setting of ESRD.
His anti-hypertensives were held, as fluid shifting during initial hemodialysis sessions was felt to be somewhat unpredictable.
His blood pressures remained well-controlled on this regimen, so we asked the patient to stop his home anti-hypertensives until he follows up with his nephrologist and primary care physician.
The patient's blood sugars were controlled with sliding scale insulin.
