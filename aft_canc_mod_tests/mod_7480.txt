He reported that she was going to undergo a cardiac catherization, but this did not happen for some reason.
In the ED, initial vs were:  Temp of 101.4, Tachycardic into 120s, blood pressure in 80s, a central line was placed into her groin, given that she was not cooperative with other access sites, and she was started on norepinephrine for blood pressure support after getting 2Liters of NS IV.
UA was notable for Hazy urine, with neg Leuk, WBC 10, few Bact, No epis, and negative for Nitrites.
Labs were notable for WBC 18.6, with 82%Neuts, 1 band, 10Lymphs.
An EKG showed sinus tachycardia at HR of 120, QTc of 456, Normal Axis.
Urine culture was sent off.

Markedely enlarged thryoid gland with multple hypodense lesions, consider thyroid unltrasound exam for further assessment.
She was tachypneic, but actually less so than her baseline, and O2 sats were also baseline.
ABG obtained showing pH 7.03, pCO2 138.
The family has granted an autopsy, which may help provide some information.
# Pneumonia: Presented with new infiltrates on CXR and CT chest, consistent with possible post-obstructive type pneumonia in RLL due to RLL bronchus mass vs. HAP/HCAP.
Urine legionella negative.
Infiltrates improved on CXR and CT chest, however she is still required O2 and was perstently tachypneic.
# Severe COPD exacerbation:  Respiratory status worsened by presumed COPD exacerbation, which left her quite wheezy, "tight" and tachypneic nearly all the time.
# Lung mass: soft tissue mass suspicious for lung CA seen on CT on admission here.
Obtained records from [**Location (un) 1121**] with CT read-- can see the mass encasing the RLL bronchus and the endobronchial lesion in left bronchus.
Repeated non-contrast chest CT done [**12-1**], no significant changes to the mass or the degree of bronchus constriction.
Her family was originally interested in pursuing a diagnosis on this mass, but it was felt that a biopsy would not be worth the risk during her acute illness, especially given that she was on plavix for a recent medically-managemed NSTEMI.
