A workup was deferred at that time to evaluate a 1.5 cm thyroid nodule.
On [**2176-8-5**], the patient had a fine needle aspiration of the nodule, which eventually showed a solid 3.4 x 2.2 x 1.9 cm mass, not a multinodular goiter but simply a hyperplastic nodule.
A CT scan showed that she had airway stenosis distal to the endotracheal tube, so she was sent to the operating room for mediastinal exploration.
At that time, 350 cc of blood were drained and an additional 500 cc of blood were lost.
She sustained a 3.5 gm hemoglobin drop from 11.9 to 8.4.
She was given further mechanical ventilatory support and was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management of airway problems.
[**Name (NI) **] laboratory data before transfer were notable for a white blood cell count of 65,400 and a platelet count of 847,000.
Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] times 25 years, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of hematology oncology:  Her baseline CBC included a white blood cell count of 40,000, hemoglobin of 13, hematocrit of 38 and platelet count of 700,000.
ALLERGIES:  The patient had allergies to codeine, Demerol and possibly contrast, but she received a CT scan without difficulty at the other hospital.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, the patient had a white blood cell count of 43,700 with a hemoglobin of 8.2, hematocrit of 24.8 and platelet count of 579,000 with an MCV of 85.
Prothrombin time was 26.6 and INR was 1.3.
There was a sodium of 142, potassium of 4, chloride of 105, bicarbonate of 22, BUN of 28, creatinine of 1.2 and glucose of 129.
CK was 305.
Albumin was 3.4.
Calcium was 8.1, phosphate was 4.8 and magnesium was 1.6.
Uric acid was 8.6.
Fine needle aspiration original results showed insufficient cellular material for analysis.
RADIOLOGY DATA:  A portable chest x-ray dated [**2176-8-21**] showed the nasogastric tube to be in good position with a left sided PICC line at the superior vena cava.
The heart size was stable with slight upper zone redistribution, right basilar atelectasis and the left costophrenic angle off the film.
On [**2176-9-3**], a chest x-ray showed further improvement since [**2176-8-28**] in infiltrates with no new abnormalities, the nasogastric tube in place and the PICC at the right atrial and superior vena cava junction.
On [**2176-9-6**], the chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema.
A head CT scan dated [**2176-8-14**] showed an aneurysm to be present with a hypodense left frontal lobe, consistent with encephalomalacia, a low density of the right periventricular region and no acute processes or bleed.
A chest CT scan dated [**2176-8-14**] showed bilateral effusions with atelectasis, peripheral right upper lobe and lingular pulmonary embolisms, neck hematoma which was not compressive and mediastinal drains in place and interval enlargement of the hematoma.
CARDIAC STUDIES:  An echocardiogram of [**2176-8-8**] showed marked left atrial enlargement, moderate right atrial enlargement, septum bowed to the right atrium, no atrioseptal defect, a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, normal size, right ventricular volume and pressure overload, moderate right dilation, mild aortic stenosis, trace aortic regurgitation, 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonic regurgitation, trivial effusion; from the prior study, this noted new tricuspid regurgitation and moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
A CT scan was performed to follow the neck hematoma with the cardiothoracic surgery service following and this showed that it was relatively stable.
A CT scan of the neck performed on [**2176-8-11**] showed a noncompressive hematoma.
A ventilation perfusion scan was performed on [**2176-8-12**] after the pulmonary hypertension noted on echocardiogram was evaluated and this showed moderate probability for pulmonary embolus, which was felt very suggestive, given her history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
A CT angiography was performed on [**2176-8-14**], which was positive for peripheral pulmonary embolus and the patient was then anticoagulated.
On [**2176-8-28**], the chest x-ray looked substantially improved.
A chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema, thought to be related to fluids given at the time of her PEG placement and she was given 20 mg of Lasix.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  For her coronary artery disease, beta blockade was titrated up slowly and her cholesterol was checked.
The patient had an echocardiogram on [**2176-8-8**], which showed pulmonary hypertension with a gradient of greater than 66 and tricuspid regurgitation with an ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
As her blood pressure rose, eventually Norvasc, Captopril and Lopressor were titrated up to provide control.
The cardiology service thought that her high blood pressure might be related to her pulmonary hypertension as well.
The patient had two episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia on [**2176-8-19**] and [**2176-8-20**] with lowering of her blood pressure with the first episode.
No recurrence was noted by [**2176-8-27**] and telemetry was discontinued on [**2176-8-28**].
This was changed to vancomycin on [**2176-8-16**] for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive sputum and positive blood cultures with gram positive cocci, originally to complete a ten day course.
A subclavian central line was pulled for positive cultures on [**2176-8-17**] after a triple lumen catheter was placed to replace it.
On [**2176-8-22**], they added obtaining an herpes simplex virus culture of a forearm lesion, which they felt was vesicular and possibly consistent with herpes simplex virus; this was negative.
However, the patient was afebrile and had an uninterpretable white blood cell count, given that she had a history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
She was also transfused with three units of packed red blood cells early in her course to obtain a goal hematocrit of 30.
A hypercoagulability panel was sent for her pulmonary embolus history and heparin was started on [**2176-8-16**].
However, hemolysis laboratory studies were sent on [**2176-8-26**] in an effort to explain her low increase in hematocrit after transfusion and stool was guaiac tested repeatedly.
On [**2176-8-27**], her LDH was noted to be elevated, but was not significant given her history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
However, her haptoglobin was less than 20 and a delayed transfusion reaction workup was sent.
The hematocrit remained stable thereafter.
The patient's Coumadin was increased to 7.5 and then decreased to 5 after a good INR was obtained.
On the day of discharge, her INR was 1.5.
FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  Tube feeds were started and titrated up.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  After the endotracheal tube was removed, the patient had a swallowing study on [**2176-8-21**], which she failed.
Baseline liver function tests were checked, given her amiodarone loading.
RENAL:  Mild acute renal failure at admission with a creatinine of 1.2 resolved.
On [**2176-8-26**], the patient had decreased but acceptable urine output and a stable creatinine which had stayed stable since the Foley catheter was discontinued.
A repeat CT scan on [**2176-8-28**] showed no changes to the left frontal encephalomalacia and right periventricular low attenuation areas.
A nerve biopsy was considered, however, because it was unlikely that we would find a treatable cause of neuropathy and wanted to avoid the risk to the patient of the wound.
with monitoring of INR and dose adjustment.
until INR is 2.3, then discontinued.
