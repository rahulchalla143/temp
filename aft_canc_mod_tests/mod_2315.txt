Day prior to Discharge Labs: WBC 8.9    Hct 27.6  Plt 312   Brief Hospital Course: #.
Her primary symptoms were frequent and large quantity diarrhea.
Blood and urine from admission were no growth.
Stool c diff was negative.
Her fevers quickly resolved, her cell counts recovered to normal within 6 days, and all antibiotics were discontinued.
One surveillence culture from [**6-5**] grew MRSA but surveillance cultures thereafter were negative.
Stool was sent again for c. diff, and was negative.
# R arm swelling: her right arm was significantly larger than her left on exam at time of transfer from ICU to BMT.
An US of the right arm showed a DVT in the brachial, axillary, and subclavian veins.
While on anticoagulation she was transfused as needed to keep her platelets greater than 50.
Her platelet count had come up before discharge so she was no longer requiring transfusions.
# Diarrhea: Ms [**Known lastname **] had had several weeks of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea ascribed to B symtoms prior to her chemotherapy, which had been treated with reglan and lomotil.
Repeat KUB revealed improved resolution of her colonic dilation.
Her cell count reached it's nadir during her stay, and then recovered.
She was also transfused as needed to keep her hematocrit greater than 25, and her platelet count greater than 50 (given anti-coagulation).
After her chemo, while neutropenic, her skin condition, fragile at baseline, deteriorated with diffuse erythema, and areas of desquamation on her buttocks, back, and arms.
Her electrolytes were monitored and she was on repletion scales.
