A head CT he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU.
The recommendations included to continue transfusing platelets to keep the platelet count greater then 100,000 and to continue his steroids to decrease cerebral edema and to aid the patient's response to the platelet transfusion and also to simply continue to monitor the patient's leukocytosis.
Throughout the course of the admission, however, no obvious source for infection was obtained (negative chest x-ray, negative urinalysis, negative blood cultures).
The patient's serial neurological examinations were benign.
The recommendation by the hematology and general surgery services were to keep the patient's platelet count above 50,000 for the first week after his documented bleed.
Neurosurgery recommended to repeat the head CT in two weeks time to assess the possibility of a slowly worsening subdural hematoma (sooner if clinically indicated).
His white blood cell count peaked at 71.6 and on discharge it is 69.6.
The recommendations per the neurosurgery team was to keep his platelet count greater then 50,000 for the first seven days after his bleed.
