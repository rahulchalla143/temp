Admission Date:  [**2160-8-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-9-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-5-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: 5 months of SOB, fatigue, fevers to 102, night sweats, weight fluctuations  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - [**2160-8-6**]: Endobronchial ultrasound with ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) by Thoracic Surgery - [**2160-8-8**]: Right cervical lymph node biopsy - [**2160-8-9**]: Bone marrow biopsy by Heme/Onc - [**2160-8-19**]: Renal biopsy by Nephrology - [**2160-8-25**]: Right video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lung biopsy, limited thoracotomy and mediastinal lymph node biopsy by Thoracic Surgery   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 55yoF with a h/o hodgkin's lymphoma dx in [**2148**] treated with 6 cycles of chemotherapy [**2149**]-[**2150**] (no radiation), and asthma who presents with 5 months of B-symptoms (afternoon fevers to 102, chills, night sweats, progressive shortness of breath, easy bruising).
She was first evaluated for these symptoms in [**Month (only) 116**] at [**Hospital1 2177**], where a CT scan showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Approximately 1 month ago, she underwent a bone marrow biopsy and mediastinoscopy with subcarinal node biopsy that were, per the patient's report, unrevealing.
She established care here at [**Hospital1 18**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] shortly after these studies, and underwent rigid bronchoscopy [**2160-8-6**] for lymph node biopsy (around the RLL).
She complained of chest tightness and so an ekg, chest xray, and labs were sent she was monitored.
The ekg showed sinus tachycardia and the first trop was negative.
There, she was continued on the vancomycin (lymph node gram stain showed GPCs) and rehydrated with mulitple liters of fluid.
When her tachycardia resolved and her blood pressure stabilized, she was sent to the floor.
It was during this hospitalization that she had a CT chest/abd/pelvis showing mediastinal and abdominal LAD, prompting the above work up.

[**2160-8-6**] Cytology EBUS TBNA LEVEL 7 Lymph node (Level 7), EBUS-TBNA: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.Bronchial epithelial cells and polymorphous lymphocytes consistent with lymph node sampling (see note).
IMAGING: EKG [**2160-8-6**]: Sinus tachycardia @128 nl axis, pr 150, qrs 98, Qtc413 no stemi, no st dep, good r-r progression, no q waves  IMAGING STUDIES: CXR [**2160-8-6**] - No previous radiographs available.
Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
FINDINGS: Evaluation was limited due to poor acoustic penetration.
[**2160-8-9**] Radiology CHEST FINDINGS:  As compared to previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
The DLCO is reduced out of proportion to the reduction in TLC which is consistent with an interstitial process.
[**2160-8-22**] Radiology CT CHEST W/CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1.
Diffuse interstitial lung abnormality with traction bronchiectasis and fibrosis which is may be due to NSIP is similar compared to the prior study except for new bilateral pulmonary nodules.
The findings are similar to those present on a previous biopsy of a right cervical lymph node (S12-31209A).
Bone marrow showed cellular bone marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and no morphological evidence of lymphoma, but with evidence of MAS.
Ferritin down - trend EBV PCR on Mondays  # Malignancy work up: History of lymphoma, presented with B-symptoms and lymphadenopathy on CT torso concerning for underlying malignant process.
Mediastinal lymph node biopsy was inconclusive, for lymphoma vs infectious lymphadenitis (EBV).
Cervical node biopsy results were similarly inconclusive.
Bone marrow biopsy showed cellular debris in macrophages consistent with macrophage activation syndrome but no evidence of malignancy.
EBV VL noted to be initialy [**2171**] but weekly titers showed persistent viremia at >1k copies.
ID followed, CMV, histoplasma, aspergillus, Beta glucan, gallactomannan and quantTB were all negative, blood cultures were negative throughout hospital course, hepatitis panel, HIVAb, HIV viral load were all negative as well.

RUQ ultrasound remarkable for fatty liver infiltration and splenomegaly, hepatitis serologies were negative.
CBC was trended, she required transfusion of platelets only on one occasion and transfusion of pRBC on two occasions.
# Pulmonary fibrosis s/p bleomycin: Pulmonary function testing was performed which showed mild to moderate restrictive ventilatory defect with a moderate gas exchange defect.

You presented with fevers, sweats and shortness of breath along with enlarged lymph nodes on CT scan of your chest and abdomen.
You had a procedure called a bronchoscopy to obtain a biopsy of your enlarged lymph nodes, following which you had low blood pressures and difficulty breathing, for which you required a brief stay in the intensive care unit.
To further investigate the cause of your symptoms you underwent biopsies of your bone marrow, kidney and lymph nodes in your lung and neck.
If you do not hear from someone by Tuesday ([**9-9**]), please call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 16336**].
