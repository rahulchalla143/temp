Troponin was 0.31.
WBC was 21.9 and portable CXR showed bilateral infiltrates.
The patient had another rectal exam which showed frank blood in the rectal vault.
Hct was 28.0.

Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated left sided filling pressures with mean PCWP 21 mmHg.
The cardiac index is preserved at 2.52 L/min/m2 (using an assumed oxygen consumption).
An ECHO on [**3-26**] showed 3+ MR and severe aortic stenosis with depressed EF35%.
However after medical treatment and diuresis, a repeat ECHO showed 2+ MR and a TEE confirmed these findings.
He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] as an outpatient for repeat TTE and management of his heart failure with the likely initiation of diuretic therapy.
He was made NPO and underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy on [**3-27**] which showed a polyp and bleeding hemorroids.
His polyp was not removed given the bleeding risk and recent MI and should be followed as an outpatient with GI for this issue.
He will need a colonoscopy as an outpatient.
# Community-acquired pneumonia: The patient reported cough and shortness of breath for the past 2-3 weeks, and underwent CTA at OSH which showed evidence of b/l PNA, and was given a dose of Levofloxacin.
)(s) 4. metoprolol succinate 50 mg Tablet Extended Release 24 hr Sig: 1.5 Tablet Extended Release 24 hrs PO once a day.
Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and had a cardiac catheterization that revealed many blockages in your heart arteries.
You had some bleeding from your rectum that appeared to be due to internal hemorrhoids but you absolutely need to have a colonoscopy to look at your whole colon to make sure there are no other areas of bleeding or polyps.
STart taking Atorvastatin (Lipitor) to prevent further blockages in your arteries from cholesterol buildup 3.
Start taking metoprolol to prevent another heart attack and lower your heart rate 4.
Start taking Lisinopril to lower your blood pressure and help your heart pump better.
