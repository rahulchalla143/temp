One of these was excised and while the pathology was pending he became quite ill.
He was transferred here for further evaluation and treatment.
His most recent bilirubin is 21, Cr 2.6, LDH 2500.

CXR [**2192-8-25**] Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.
If clinically warranted, further evaluation with cross-sectional imaging toexclude the possibility of occult infection.
ECG [**2192-8-25**] Sinus tachycardia, rate 131.
ECHO [**2192-8-20**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
CT TORSO [**2192-8-12**]  contrast IMPRESSION: 1.
Right groin fluid collection, could be evolving hematoma, seroma, or lypmhocele.
Further characterization of these findings with MR imaging is recommended.
Please note that a large left abdominal mass mentioned in the history was not identified with ultrasound and further evaluation could be obtained with CT if clinically indicated.
CXR [**2192-8-10**] The right central venous line tip was repositioned and is currently at the low SVC.
A CT of his torso to evaluate the burden of his disease revelaed extensive para-aortic and hilar lymphadenopathy and intrahepatic involvement.
Tumor lysis labs were followed and Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 11752**] was continued on allopurinol therapy.
His AST and ALT eventually normalized, however his total bilirubin took longer to normalize.
The goal to initiate therapy was a total bilirubin of 2, so as to not compromise standard therapy of R-CHOP through significant re-dosing.
On [**2192-8-31**], it appeared that Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 87096**] total bilirubin had plateaued at 3.
# Hepatic failure: He was noted to have elevated liver enzymes with LDH of 2400 and T. Bili of 24.0 on admission.
His liver function tests continued to rise throughout his admission, maximally elevated at ALT 128 and AST 264 with peak LDH 2448, maximal Alkphos of 833 and total bilirubin of 26.3.
A urine culture grew coagulase negative staph aureas and Mr. [**Known lastname 16968**] was started on PO ciprofloxacin.
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 87096**] foley catheter was not removed or replaced at this time, because of significant edema, ongoing chemotherapy and the need to follow urine out-put during chemotherapy.
His edema was significantly improved at the time of discharge.
Wound culture grew MRSA, he was treated for several days with IV Daptomycin, as Mr. [**Known lastname 16968**] reportedly has a vancomycin allergy,  which was discontinued as the culture appeared more consistent with a contaminant.
You will follow up in clinic on Friday [**2192-9-7**] to check your blood counts and receive a third dose of Rituxan.
Your blood sugars have been high for the last several days because of the high dose steroids you received over the weekend with the chemotherapy.
Your home nursing aid will check your blood sugars for you.
