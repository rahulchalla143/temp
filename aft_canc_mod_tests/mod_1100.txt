Imaging: CXR-When compared to the prior chest x-ray of [**Month (only) 116**] the 21st.
Some upper zone redistribution may be present, particularly when compared to the two prior chest x-rays and I suspected degree of failure is present.
ECHO ([**2124-7-2**]):IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-10-9**], LV cavity is larger, and both aortic and mitral regurgitation are more prominent.
LV systolic function and other findings are similar.
