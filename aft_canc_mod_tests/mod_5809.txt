Inititial CXR showed LLL collapse, B effusions and evidence of CHF.
Repeat CXR post intubation showed re-expansion of L lung but persistence of bilateral effusions.
CTA in the Emergency room ruled out acute pulmonary emboli.
L IJ was placed and CVP was [**10-4**].

CXR demonstrated bilateral pleural effusion with concern for pneumonia and echo obtained on [**3-2**] confirmed a markedly decreased ejection fraction of 20%.
Respiratory failure - The patient was intubated in the ED for airway protection and increasing respiratory distress.
Chest CT angiogram ruled out acute pulmonary emboli.
Initial chest x ray showed bilateral pleural effusions and along with a retrocardiac opacity and bibasilar collapse.
Cultures obtained and patient started on broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl for her community acquired pneumonia.
Pt's sputum cultures grew out oropharyngeal flora and her blood cultures remained negative throughout her admission.
Pt was successfully extubated 2 days after she admission and maintained good oxygen saturations on 2L NC.
Oxygen saturation >94% on room air; however, patient may prefer to have oxygen supplementation for comfort.
Neuro / Psych - Mental status improved to baseline with difficulty word finding, mild anxiety, and occasional mild confusion.
Echo also revealed a severly dilated RA and RV.
Gentle use of beta blockers to control rate because the patient may need the tachycardia to offset her markedly depressed EF of 20%.
Testing of digoxin levels is recommended for goal of 0.7. f. Started on lisinopril.
Hct stable from last admission.
