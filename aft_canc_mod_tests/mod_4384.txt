He presented to [**Hospital3 5365**] where they obtained a CT torso showing extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli with suggestion of RV strain, and questionable gallbladder wall thickening.
He had an abdominal CT to evaluate extent of the lesion and was found to have incidental pulmonary embolus which was treated with lovenox then bridged to coumadin until [**5-/2168**] when it was discontinued per PCP.
FAST exam notable for RV strain.
Labs notable for WBC 11.6, PTT 142, normal creatinine, BNP<5, trop 0.13, and ALT/AST 53/46.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed some GB wall thickening and possible hemangioma 1.7cm.

As a result, MRI is recommended for further evaluation.

Evidence of intraventricular septum flattening on CT chest report and on FAST u/s in ED with RV dysfunction.
Chest xray showed low lung volumes, no consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.

Blood sugars were well controlled throughout hospitalization.
Previous MRI abd w/ w/out contrast at [**Location (un) 2274**] ([**2168-5-11**]) identified a 15 mm lesion in segment 8 consistent with hemangioma.
Per radiology, there is no need for outpatient MRI to evaluate this; he should continue imaging as recommended by his outpatient [**Month/Day/Year 21339**].
This was diagnosed at at [**Hospital3 5365**], where you came earlier that morning with dyspnea and had a CT scan showing pulmonary embolism, a blood clot in your lungs.
We also did an ultrasound which found that the source of the clot in your lungs was a clot in your legs.
We sent several laboratory tests to help evaluate possible causes of the clot; you should follow up on these with your [**Month/Day/Year 21339**].
