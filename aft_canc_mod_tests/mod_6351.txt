IMAGING: [**2159-4-26**] : This examination is severely limited by artifact from retained barium.
Repeat imaging may be considered at no charge to the patient.
Examination of the lower abdomen and bowel loops is limited by extensive streak artifact from retained barium within the stomach.
If repeat CT imaging is to be performed, would recommend plain abdominal radiographs to ensure passage of barium from the stomach and bowel loops.
PATHOLOGY: [**2159-5-15**] SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: FS Bile Duct Lymph Node.
