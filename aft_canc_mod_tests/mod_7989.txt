LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is approximately 35%.
The maximum gradient through the valve was 6 mmHg with a mean of 2 mmHg at a cardiac output of 3.5 liters/minute.
He continued to progress and was transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
Orthpeadics was consulted and a CT scan was performed.
