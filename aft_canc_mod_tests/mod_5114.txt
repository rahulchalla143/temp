/ no chemo no radiation / last CT CAP 5 yrs ago, last bone scan 3 yrs ago, [**Last Name (un) 68650**] annually.
pt reports three weeks of unsteady gait - had outpt CT and then 2 days later (24th) had MRI/brain.
MRI from 24th with right cerebellar mass with some tonsilar herniation as well as effacement of the midbrain/brainstem.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2150-8-18**] 7:37 PM IMPRESSION: Right cerebellar mass with significant vasogenic edema effacing the right posterior basal cistern and exerting mass effect on the brainstem.
Prior MRI is not available to assess for interval change.
CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2150-8-19**] 9:47 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
Comparison with a follow-up bone scan may be useful to assess for metastatic disease.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2150-8-22**] 9:43 PM IMPRESSION: 2.9 x 2.3 x 3.3 cm ring-enhancing mass involving the right cerebellum causing minimal mass effect upon the fourth ventricle.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2150-8-24**] 2:29 AM IMPRESSION: 1) Postoperative changes in the right cerebellar resection bed, with no significant change in the amount of effacement of the basilar cisterns and mass effect on the brainstem from the preop study.
This finding discussed after the study with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 39252**].
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2150-8-25**] 3:23 PM IMPRESSION: Status post resection of right-sided cerebellar lesion.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2150-8-28**] 8:29 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
Right transfrontal ventricular drain is unchanged in position, with no interval change in size or shape of the ventricles.
On [**8-22**], she was brought into the OR for OR and a craniotomy; however, MRI images were not present at this time, and hence, the EVD was placed and the craniotomy delayed until Sunday [**8-23**].
Her blood pressure was controlled, with SBP less than 145.
On [**8-28**], the patient had a repeat CT Head which was stable, and her EVD was removed (vent drain) without complications.
