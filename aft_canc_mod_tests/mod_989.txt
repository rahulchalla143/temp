Admission Date:  [**2128-7-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2128-8-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2077-9-13**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Transplant Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50-year-old gentleman with end-stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C who presented to [**Hospital1 69**] for a liver transplant.
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, and there was no cardiac history.
The patient was scheduled to undergo a liver-related liver transplant from his cousin on [**2128-7-15**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical examination, temperature was 98.3, blood pressure was 116/40, heart rate was 60, respiratory rate was 18, and oxygen saturation was 100% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremity examination revealed no tenderness.
Neurologic examination a nonfocal.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories revealed hematocrit was 26.5, white blood cell count was 6.5, and platelets were 92.
Sodium was 141, potassium was 4, blood urea nitrogen was 17, and creatinine was 0.9.
Phosphate was 4.4.
AST was 335, ALT was 210, alkaline phosphatase was 73, and total bilirubin was 6.5.
INR was 1.3.
On postoperative day one, the patient underwent a Duplex ultrasound of the liver which revealed normal blood flow and no biliary obstruction.
His creatinine was maintained.
Troponin levels were drawn and were elevated.
An echocardiogram of the heart indicated inferior wall motion abnormalities with 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation.
A KUB revealed some air/fluid levels, but gas was present in the colon to the rectum.
They were coffee-brown in color, so an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which revealed some mild gastritis.
The patient had a computed tomography scan of the abdomen which revealed normal hepatic flow; however, there was dilated loops of small bowel with a question of an ischemic process.
The patient then underwent an upper gastrointestinal swallow which indicated a mechanical partial small-bowel obstruction with dilation of both limbs of Roux-en-Y proximal to jejunostomy with decompressed small bowel afterwards; likely due to an adhesion.
The patient eventually was able to tolerate a regular diet, and his liver function tests trended downward.
Before discharge, the patient had a repeat echocardiogram which still revealed an unchanged inferior wall motion abnormality; however, there was significant improvement with only mild mitral regurgitation.
