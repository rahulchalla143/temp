CT Head w/o Contrast (12/28/8): IMPRESSION: Large heterogeneous left frontal extra-axial mass lesion, with coarse peripheral calcification, and mild-moderate surrounding edema and mass effect, most consistent with a meningioma.
MRI Brain w Contrast (12/29/8): CONCLUSION: Left temporal, frontal, and parietal meningioma with  calcification, cyst formation, mass effect, and edema.
CT Head w/o Contrast (1/9/9): IMPRESSION: 1.
No acute intracranial pathology after recent biopsy including no hemorrhage.
CT Head w/o Contrast (1/18/9): IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head w/o Contrast (2/1/9): IMPRESSION: 1.
CT A/P (12/31/9): IMPRESSION: 1.
PATHOLOGY (1/9/9): DIAGNOSIS: Atypical meningioma, WHO grade II (see note).
EEG (2/2/9): FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: There was intermittent focal slowing seen in the left posterior quadrant with occasional sharp features.
ABNORMALITY #2: The background activity was disorganized and relatively slow reaching a maximum of 8 Hz on the right, but was slower than that most of the time.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an average rate of 80 bpm.

Pt was admitted w plan for neurosurgical biopsy of the brain mass.
Initial CT of the head and MRI of the head showed CNS lesion with localized edema but no herniation.
Pt underwent biopsy on [**2169-1-6**] and was noted to have an atypical-appearing meningioma infiltrating into the surrounding tissue.
A 5mm SDH was seen at the site of surgery, which was acceptable in the perioperative setting per neurosurgery.
EEG on [**1-30**] was performed to rule out seizure, some general slowing was seen consistent w drowsiness vs encephalopathy, but no seizure activity was seen.
# DVT/PE: Pt's post biopsy course was complicated by the development of DVT on her RUE at the site of the PICC.
A CTA was obtained and was positive for bilateral PE.
Discharged on warfarin 6mg PO for 6 months w INR goal [**1-31**] (to be checked at least weekly).
A hit ab was sent and came back negative.
HIT Ab and serotonin release were obtained and were both negative.
# Anemia: Pt admitted w Hct = 37, presumed baseline.
Hct dropped into mid-to-high 20's in the setting of surgical procedures.
# Tachycardia: The patient was noted to be intermittently tachycardic, while appearing dry on exam and having orthostasis.
# Klebsiella UTI: On initial evaluation she was noted to have Klebsiella bacteremia.
# Type 2 DM: The patient's blood glucose was difficult to control requiring aggressive insulin administration.
All necessary follow-ups were arranged and the patient was discharged in stable condition.
Upon admission here you had repeat imaging to evaluate this mass.
To further explore treatment options and to obtain a tissue diagnosis, you had a brain biopsy performed by neurosurgery.
Because of your steroids and history of diabetes, your blood sugars were very high upon admission to the hospital.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] your blood sugar is less than 50 or greater than 400, you should contact your physician or come to the ED.
During this time, you will need to have regular blood checks to make sure this medication is at an appropriate dosage.
