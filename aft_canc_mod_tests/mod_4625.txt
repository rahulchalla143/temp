Sequential selective catheterization of initially two potential third/fourth order branches within the right colic artery that might have supplied this area, followed by additional selection of two potential sources within the ileocolic artery did not demonstrate any further extravasation.
After this tiny focus was seen on initial angiography, no it could not be re-demonstrated on the remaining portion of our study (over approximately 2-3 hours).
Repeat colonoscopy to remove polpys and assess rectum in the next 3 months.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80 year old male with past medical history of DM2 complicated by nephropathy s/p living related donor kidney transplant in [**2137**] with subsequent baseline Cr of 2, CAD s/p stents to LAD and Left circumflex, diastolic CHF with EF=65%, PVD, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension (45 to 55 mm Hg based on TTE in [**8-/2146**]), OSA on CPAP, history of C diff, chronic gastritis, and history of lower GI bleed 5 years ago s/p colonoscopy and successful clipping in NY presenting from his [**Hospital1 1501**] with multiple episodes of bright red blood per rectum consistent with a repeat lower GI bleed.
Hct was stable around 29-30 after transfusion.
After transfusion, his Hct remained stable around 29-30.
A tagged red cell scan was negative for active bleeding the following day.
After stable Hct and no further bright red blood per rectum episodes, he was prepped for a colonoscopy which showed polyps in the whole colon diverticulosis of the transverse colon and sigmoid colon, Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids, and Angioectasia in the cecum (endoclip).
He will require repeat colonoscopy in 3 months to remove the polyps.
# CKI s/p renal transplant:  The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.6 below his recent baseline of 2.
His Cr remained below his recent baseline of 2 on discharge (1.0-1.3).
Home labetalol was restarted after maintaining hemodynamic stability and Hct level s/p colonoscopy and angioectasia clipping.
# Vascular Surgery / Amputation: Patient is s/p right foot 4th and 5th ray amputations and right CEA endarterectomy with patch angioplasty during his recent admission from [**2146-11-18**] to [**2146-11-30**].
# Repeat colonoscopy to remove polpys and assess rectum in the next 3 months (discharged back on home regimen of aspirin and plavix.
You had some imaging studies which gave us an initial idea of where the bleeding is coming from.
After your blood level remained stable, you had a colonoscopy which showed an abnormal vessel on the right side of your colon which was clipped.
Please Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
Followup Instructions: Will need repeat colonoscopy in 3 months.
