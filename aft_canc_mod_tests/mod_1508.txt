The patient had a colonoscopy, which showed a rectal mass at approximately 12 to 17 cm and a rectal polyp approximately 2 cm.
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Rectal examination shows a prolapsing 2.5 cm polyp.
Postoperative electrocardiogram showed a questionable ST depression in V3 and V4, less then 1 mm.
Cardiac enzymes were sent, which revealed only a slight bump in troponin consistent with ischemia not infarction.
The patient was fluid bolused and eventually decreased his oxygen saturations and thus was transferred to the unit.
While in the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day two his hematocrit was shown to be 24.8 consistent with mild blood loss and hemodilution.
He was transfused 2 units and subsequent hematocrit was 30.8.
His hematocrit remained stable throughout the remainder of his admission.
Chest x-ray while in the unit was consistent with left ventricular failure, which eventually resolved.
