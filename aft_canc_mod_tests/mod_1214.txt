Overnight, his Hct fell 35.9 -> 26 over 12 hours.
INR on admission was 2.4.
Cr was 1.3 (baseline 1.2).

The suggested etiology is, when also corrlelated with CT is a right upper pole angiomyolipoma (AML).
A short-term followup examination is recommended to assess resolution of the perinephric fluid collection.
Hepatic lesions, which are likely cysts.
pt was taken to angiography to assess perinephric bleeding, which was unremarkable.
repeat NG lavage afterwards, upon arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], was negative (few clots, no bleeding).
MRI of the abdomen suggested cause of perinephric bleed to be due to an angiomyolipoma.
Urology recommended follow up CT in [**3-14**] weeks.
Upper endoscopy was deferred at that time due to pt's increasing O2 requirement (due to RLL pneumonia) as well as Afib.
Then, on [**2121-12-24**], patient again developed afib with RVR, rate unable to be controlled, and he was transferred back to ICU for diltiazem drip for rate control.
His hct has remained stable, with the GI service recommending endoscopy and colonoscopy as an outpatinet.
The following morning ([**12-27**]) he converted again to afib with heart rates in the 110s-120s.
TFTs and LFTs were normal in-house, and he will need outpatient PFTs.
Pt will require twice annual lfts and tfts, as well as baseline and annual cxr, pfts, and eye exam which will be deferred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11649**].
