A sputum culture from [**12-25**] was noted to have sparce growth of aspirgillus fumigatus and terreus.
Chest imaging showed what was felt to be worsening of her infiltrate (although it is unclear what this was compared to) and pneumonitis.
They performed a bronchoscopy on [**2117-1-26**] which was complicated by an extensive bleed leading to intubation.
She developed worsening hypercarbia on [**2-9**] and underwent a workup for embolic disease.
A CTA was negative for PE but showed b/l pleural effusions R>L and a new left upper lung nodule of 1.4cm.
An MRI of the brain showed a new left parietal lobe infarcation.
A CT also showed old infarction.
WBC up to 20,000.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management given her extensive past medical care at [**Hospital1 18**].
VS on arrival as below.
PCP infection in [**8-/2114**] and remains on Bactrim 10.
CMV viremia [**9-14**] 11.
EBV viremia [**2115-11-7**] MMF discontinued 12.
RSV infection in [**2116-2-7**] .
She had a relatively uncomplicated post-transplant course until she developed CMV viremia with CMV viral load on [**2115-9-30**] noted at 4000.
Subsequent CMV viral loads on [**2115-10-6**] revealed a level of 9000, and repeat on [**2115-10-11**] was 14,500.
Unfortunately, her CMV viral load increased further and she was readmitted for IV Foscarnet on [**2115-10-24**].
With improvement in her CMV viral load, she was discharged to the apartments on [**2115-11-9**] on IV ganciclovir.
Biopsy was consistent with a drug hypersensitivity reaction, possibly related to Foscarnet or Bactrim.
However, [**Doctor First Name 16883**] was noted for increasing EBV level of 400 and with concern for PTLD, she was admitted on [**2115-12-15**] for evaluation and followup.
Subsequent EBV viral loads were < 8 and CT of the neck showed decreasing adenopathy.
CT of the torso showed stable adenopathy within the abdomen.
Bone marrow biopsy was negative for lymphoma.
- s/p enrollment on [**Company 2860**] study involving anti-CTLA-4 antibody with donor lymphocyte infusion in 05/[**2112**].
- Persistent elevation in white blood count with increased abdominal adenopathy and began treatment with Methotrexate for two doses with minimal response.
She had initial response after two cycles with normalization of white count and resolution of cervical adenopathy but this grew again, and she received the 3rd cycle of DHAP.

Radiology: XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-2-12**] 8:03 PM IMPRESSION: AP chest read in conjunction with chest CT on [**12-28**] compared to the most recent prior chest radiograph, [**2-19**].
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-2-14**] 5:23 AM The position of the ET tube, central venous line and the NG tube is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal scan due to positioning; patient unable to cooperate.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-2-15**] 4:37 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-12**] through 9:  The improvement in widespread pulmonary opacification between [**2-13**] and 9 has stabilized.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-2-16**] 5:50 AM FINDINGS: The left venous infusion catheter ends near the cavoatrial junction.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-2-17**] 3:21 PM FINDINGS: The NG tube has been replaced with a feeding tube that ends near the GE junction.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-2-17**] 7:58 PM FINDINGS: Nasogastric tube is no longer visualized.
At the time of this dictation, a separately dictated chest x-ray has been performed and documents subsequent removal of this device.
With the exception of the change in tube positions, the appearance of the chest is relatively similar compared to the prior study of earlier the same date except for slight worsening of diffuse pulmonary opacities.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-2-17**] 11:26 PM FINDINGS: Feeding tube has been removed and replaced with a nasogastric tube, which terminates in the distal stomach.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-2-18**] 6:35 PM ' The current study re-demonstrates tracheostomy with its tip being relatively low, 1.3 cm above the carina, unchanged.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-2-19**] 5:42 AM Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained on [**2117-2-18**].
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-2-21**] 5:20 AM One view.
Comparison with the previous study of [**2117-2-19**].
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-2-22**] 5:03 AM Comparison film [**2117-2-21**].
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-2-24**] 5:56 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-17**] through 17:  Since [**2-22**], the diffuse opacification in the left lung has improved except for the apex.
The interval change might be remission of edema, and the large scale consolidation could be multifocal pneumonia or a non-recoverable component of edema such as ARDS.
Patient unable to undergo repeat chest imaging due to peristent instability.
# Parietal Stroke: Found on head MRI on [**2117-2-11**] at OSH.
Lower extremity study revealed occlusive segmental deep vein thrombosis in the right posterior tibial vein, without proximal extension to other deep veins.
