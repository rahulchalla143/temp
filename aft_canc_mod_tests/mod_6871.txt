CXR: [**2115-12-25**]: SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: An endotracheal tube tip terminates 5 cm from the carina.
CT HEAD [**2115-12-28**]: FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, edema, or shift of normally midline structures.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated, within limitation of motion.
These are possibly seen on the present CT study as hypodense areas and are inadequately assessed.
This lesion was seen on the prior CT from [**2115-12-24**] and is concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma.
Segment V liver lesion as previously seen on the CT from [**2115-12-24**] that is concerning for HCC.
The examination is otherwise significant for small amount of fluid/mucosal thickening in the mastoid tips, fluid layering in the pharynx, minimal maxillary sinus mucosal thickening and abnormal shape of the right globe likely status post scleral banding.
MRI brain showed question of encephalitis.
He was treated with acyclovir until the LP viral cultures came back negative.
Patient meets AIDS criteria with prior CD4<200 (114 [**8-/2114**]) and previous infection with pneumocystis.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Harbour Lights  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pneumonia, hepatic hydrothrorax  Secondary: HCV Cirrhosis, HIV/AIDS  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
