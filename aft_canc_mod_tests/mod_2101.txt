In addition, her BUN and creatinine began to rise.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs on transfer to the floor:  Temperature 95.9, blood pressure 106/68, heart rate 112, respiratory rate 20, 02 98% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
Capillary refill less than two seconds, warm to touch.
LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer, the white blood count was 7.8, hematocrit 28.3, platelets 210,000.
Sodium 139, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, bicarbonate 22, BUN 49, creatinine 2.2, glucose 157.
The patient's condition at this point in time was discussed with the attending, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], as well as the Renal Fellow, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1860**], and the consensus was to continue the hemodialysis as her blood pressure tolerated.
If the patient was without improvement, the option remained to start empiric heparin, but no CTA angiogram (concern for PE).
Her physical examination had not changed at this point in time and her ascites/anasarca still remained from her costal margin to her toes.
Her blood pressure predialysis was 120/75, pulse rate 111, and her blood pressure postdialysis was 107/59, pulse 124; 2.7 kilograms were removed from the patient, and she tolerated this procedure well without any shortness of breath.
