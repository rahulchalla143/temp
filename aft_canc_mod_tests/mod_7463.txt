PATHOLOGY: [**2106-2-1**] Skin Biopsy, right leg: Leukocytoclastic vasculitis with thrombi containing deposits consistent with cryoglobulinemia.
[**2106-2-1**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1.
Chest CT scanning would be helpful to exclude cavitation, a clear indication of infection, or the development of lung abscess, particularly in the lingula.
[**2106-2-9**] CT HEAD: 1.
[**2106-2-9**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1.
Bibasilar consolidations, increased from the prior examination concerning for infection.
[**2106-2-9**] CT Chest w/o con: 1.
Bibasilar consolidations, increased from the prior examination concerning for infection.
[**2106-2-24**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**2-23**], there is little change.
Monitoring and support devices remain in place and diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist.
?s constellation of findings and history are consistent with cryglobulinemia, manifesting with particularly active pulmonary vasculitis, which is an uncommon but documented phenomenon.
She was diagnosed with cryoglobulinemia by serum test as well as skin biopsy and was treated with solumedrol, underwent 5 sessions of plasmapheresis and received 1 dose of rituxan per rheumatology and heme/onc recs.
Her oxygenation did not improve, which raised concern for an alternate or secondary process.
Fungal markers were sent (concern increased in setting of her immunosuppression) and were negative.
Patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**2-5**] which showed diffusely inflamed collapsible airways without any blood visualized.
Was diagnosed with serum test as well as skin biopsy.
Dermatology was consulted and performed a biopsy which showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis and Ig deposition consistent with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis.
# ARF/Azotemia: Initially attributed to possible pre-renal picture given low urine Na and FeUrea of 17%.
Urine output improved with fluid rehydration, but then dropped again and azotemia was then attributed to steroids and later acyclovir.
She was started on CVVH when urine output dropped (though BUN, creatinine normal) and respiratory distress increased.
CT abdomen negative for obstruction.
