Admission Date:  [**2197-5-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-6-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2157-6-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line placement Radial arterial line placement Mechanical ventilation   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 3866**] is a 39 F with widely metastatic melanoma first diagnosed in [**11/2195**] after undergoing a biopsy of a nevus that had changed in appearance and had become pruritic and prone to bleeding.
Her CT scan on [**2196-10-17**] revealed enlargement of several pulmonary masses and a right infrahilar azygoesophageal  mass.
She underwent whole brain radiation, which she completed on [**2196-12-23**].
Social History: She works at [**Company **] Pilgrim and lives with her spouse and her son and 2 children.
Physical Exam:  T 96.1 BP 142/75, pulse 126, respirations 30-40, oxygen saturation 71% room air, 91% on nonrebreather GENERAL: A 39-year-old female very tachypneic, using accessory muscles to breath, speaking in 1 word answers.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation but some dullness at bases.
Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2197-5-26**] 11:13 AM FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
Please note that a non-contrast head CT is insensitive to the detection of metastatic disease, abscesses, and vascular anomalies.
Limited exam due to lack of IV contrast.
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2197-5-26**] 11:14 AM Comparison is made with prior MRI from [**2197-4-26**].
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST A right axillary node measures 15 mm in short axis diameter and appears new.
Limited non-contrast evaluation of right hilar lymphadenopathy demonstrates that the node designated as target lesion #1 measures approximately 43 x 26 mm (previously 35 x 24 mm).
Adjacent target lesions 2 and 3 cannot be adequately measured on this non- contrast study but may have also slightly increased in size compared to [**2197-4-6**].
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Limited evaluation of the abdomen without contrast does not adequately evaluate the numerous liver and splenic metastatic lesions.
Non-contrast evaluation of the kidneys again reveals a soft tissue mass near the mid pole of the right kidney posteriorly, which does not demonstrate any gross change in size.
Non-contrast evaluation of large and small bowel is unremarkable.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The rectum and sigmoid are unremarkable.
Limited non-contrast evaluation demonstrates progression of metastatic disease with increased pulmonary tumor burden and increase in size of multiple lymph node groups as described.
The patient developed oliguric renal failure, renal was consulted, but she did not require dialysis and her kidney function returned to baseline.
She contined to worsen, so CT torso was performed which revealed worsening metastatic disease.
