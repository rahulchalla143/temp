[**2137-4-14**] CT Neck W/Contrast: Status post lower teeth removal without evidence of surrounding abscess or bony lytic lesion; prominent right cervical lymph nodes, although none meet pathologic size criteria; no evidence of abscess.
[**2137-4-20**] CT Neck W/Contrast: There are no fluid collections concerning for abscess formation.
MRI head FINDINGS: There have been no significant changes since the prior study.
The diffusion study is of limited quality due to artifacts.
CONCLUSION: No change since the study of [**2137-5-23**].
Echocardiogram The left atrium is normal in size.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-5-8**], the findings are similar.
MRI neck [**7-18**] IMPRESSION: Persistent post-operative changes of the base of tongue with no suspicious interval change to suggest recurrent infection.
Exam was significant for sore on the R inner lip mucosa.
Initial negative including a chest x-ray and CT of the neck with contrast showed no evidence of infection.
Urine and blood cultures were negative.
Thorough ID work-up including CMV VL, monospot, EBV PCR, Bartonella serologies, Toxoplasma serologies, throat culture for GAS and Arcanobacterium, R lip wound culture, respiratory viral culture, beta-glucan, galactomannan, were all negative.
He continued to spike fevers so the CT of the neck was repeated which again failed to show an abscess.
An EGD showed no evidence of esophagitis.
An MRI of the pelvis showed an intersphincteric fistula extending from 1 o'clock, 2 cm above the anal verge to the left perineum and an additional tiny 5 mm enhancing focus in the intersphincteric space which may represent a tiny abscess or small sinus tract.
While intubted he underwent tongue biopsy and right lingular artery embolization.
ANC uptrended to >500 and team had discussion with ID who recommended repeat MRI on [**7-18**] which was stable.
Chest xray was negative for pna and showed atelectasis.
Blood and urine cx were negative.
Chest xray was notable for atelectasis and pt used incentive spirometer.
EGD with biopsies were negative and a one time dose of steroids did not alleviate his symptoms.
ID was reconsulted and recommended checking adenovirus pcr, urine cmv culture, BK virus, mycolytic blood culture.
BK viral load returned significantly elevated (above threshold).
Mycolytic blood culture and CMV studies pending at time of discharge.
He was started on valganciclovir for CMV with plan for repeat CMV vl on [**8-10**].
Prophylaxis was acyclovir, atovaquone and he was continued on ambisome for mucor infection.
Tissue was sent from OR for microbiology and cytological studies to work-up malignancy vs infectious etiology.
He was continued on broad antimicrobials (Zosyn, Flagyl, Bactrim, Ambisome, Acyclovir) and his pathology from the neck was consistent with fungal forms.
He was given 2 uits of pRBC post operatively with a post-transfusion goal to keep Hct >20.
Liver bx recommended pending current ENT w/u.
None seen on examination today but continue abx.
He was immediately intubated and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], where the massive transfusion protocol was activated and he received 6u pRBC, 3u plts, and 2u FFP.
MICU [**Location (un) **] [**5-24**]- [**6-3**]: Pt had lingual artery embolized and maintained on intubation with oropharynx packed.
[**6-3**] MRI brain showed no evidence of stroke and mental status noted to be much improved.
His head MRI did not show evidence of anoxic brain injury .

Your white count was abnormally low and you were found to have a condition called Myelodysplastic Syndrome.
