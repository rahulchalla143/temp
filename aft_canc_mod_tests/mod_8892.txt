Admission Date:  [**2185-2-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2185-3-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2123-1-8**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, mitral valve replacement and was found to have a right upper lobe mass on chest x-ray in [**2184-4-27**].
The patient had a follow-up chest CT scan which confirmed the presence of a mass in the right upper lobe and collapse of that lobe in [**2184-10-27**].
She had lower extremity ultrasounds which were negative for deep vein thrombosis and chest x-ray showed right pleural effusion and cardiomegaly.
When the patient's INR decreased she was taken for a bronchoscopy which showed a pulsatile mass in the right middle lobe.
A biopsy and washings were performed.
Vital signs; temperature 98.9 F, pulse 78 to 81, blood pressure 89 to 97 over 36 to 69.
The patient was having an oxygen saturation of 95 to 100% on controlled ventilation.
Chest exam significant for decreased breath sounds on the right with coarse breath sounds and scattered rales anteriorly bilaterally.
Heart exam significant for mechanical heart sounds.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION TO MICU:  Complete blood count; white blood cell count 9.8, hematocrit 20.6, platelet count 343,000.
Coags significant for an INR of 1.4.
Chemistry significant for bicarbonate of 38, chloride of 91.
Calcium was elevated at 11.6.
Chest x-ray showed complete opacification of the right hemothorax and a large right atrium.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 80 to 85 beats per minute with right axis deviation and T-wave inversions in leads 2, 3 and aVF with nonspecific ST changes.
Due to the size and nature of the mass seen by x-ray and CT as well as bronchoscopy it most likely represented a malignancy.
However, the biopsy obtained during the bronchoscopy was not definitive.
Numerous sputum cytologies were sent which showed highly atypical keratinized squamous cells highly suspicious for non-small cell lung cancer.
The patient had a rate that appeared to be junctional while she was in the Intensive Care Unit.
She was initiated on digoxin; however, was taken off of this and her rate was well controlled.
Postmortem examination was declined by the family.
