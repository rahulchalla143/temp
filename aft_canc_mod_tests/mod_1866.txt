[**2194-5-27**] Renal U/S - No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Scarred right renal parenchyma [**2194-5-26**] ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2194-5-18**], left ventricular systolic function is probably similar.

No change since prior CT dated [**2194-5-21**] [**2194-5-22**] CXR - No significant interval change over the last 24 hours, the patient with marked congestion, probably pulmonary edema and possible overlying infectious processes [**2194-5-21**] CT Head - Severely limited exam, secondary to patient motion.

- follow serial EKGs, monitor for any recurrence of angina - cycle enzymes, telemetry - continue aspirin, low-dose metoprolol (monitor closely on BB as this could mask GI bleed), stating (increase to high-dose statin); no anticoagulation given GIB -cardiology planning to follow up  2. guiac positive stool + Hct drop--serial Hcts - pt with known varices, ulcers, & watermelon stomach for which he has had argon treatments.
Hct 35 on 4/35.
- transfuse to hct>30s; lasix prn w/ transfusion - serial hct Q6hrs; IV ppi [**Hospital1 **]; 2 large bore IVs - gently correct coagulopathy - got vitamin K in ED, hold coumadin - would not reverse INR given his hypercoagulable state; this was discussed with GI, hem/omc, & cardiology -no NG lavage done d/t known varices and elevated INR - GI following; plan for EGD when medically stable  3.
- gently diurese with IV lasix - low-dose metoprolol for ACS - hold ace given his GIB - plan for repeat echo here  4.
WBC 103K with immature cells on smear - pt with known CML, on hydrea as outpt.
Per [**Hospital3 **] records, last CBC on [**3-24**] with WBC 71, hct 35, plt 439.
- obtain records, & ensure his WBC count is at baseline - make certain smear consistent with priors (r/o blast crisis); heme-onc to review smear - continue hydrea as per home regimen - case was discussed with heme/onc team, who concurred with continuing current hydrea dose, & will review peripheral smear.
ARF atop CKD - unknown baseline -check urine lytes, resuscitate as needed  6. hypercoagulability - pt w/ recurrent VTE, also h/o CVA; on coumadin as outpt.
