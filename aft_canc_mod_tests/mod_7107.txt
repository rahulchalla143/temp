The heart, mediastinal contours, and pulmonary vasculature are unchanged in appearance, remarkable for tortuous aorta.

Destruction of the outer table suggests aggressive potential and further evaluation is indicated."
FINDINGS: The images of the posterior fossa region are mildly degraded by patient motion, although a repeat imaging sequence is of reasonably good diagnostic quality in this region.
CONCLUSION: Stable, abnormal study as noted above.

CT consistent with emphysema and long standing tobacco abuse make diagnosis very likely in the abscence of PFTs.
Repeat Chest CT was performed to evaluate for metastatic disease from left frontal osteohemangioma.
CT reported 2 X 3mm pulm nodules that will require a follow up CT in 6mths but were thought to be likely benign.
However, due to his recent h/o GI bleed, decision was made not to anti-coagulate him while in house.
Recommend f/u thyroid function tests as outpt.
# Scull tumor: Neuro surgery was consulted for a CT read of invasive osteohemangioma.
Per neuro, this was not likely contributing to any MS changes but recommended CT chest for staging which showed two different 3mm pulm nodules, unlikely to be metastatic, will need f/u CT in 6mths.
Influenza B 2.
You will need to obtain a follow up chest CT scan to evaluate incidentally noted nodules in your chest.
This scan should be done 3-6 months from now.
Please discuss with your primary care physician to obtain [**Name Initial (PRE) **] follow up chest CT scan in [**3-23**] months to evaluate pulmonary nodules.
