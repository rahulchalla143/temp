Radiology: CXR - FINDINGS:  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process; please refer to the report from chest CTA performed on the same day.
CTA Chest, CT A/P: FINDINGS: CHEST CTA: Enhanced pulmonary vasculature demonstrates multiple bilateral filling defects consistent with acute pulmonary emboli involving most lobar, segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries with relative sparing of the left upper lobe branches.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver is diffusely hypodense suggestive of fatty replacement.
Diastolic function could not be assessed.
Brief Hospital Course: 49M w/PMHx HIV (CD4 114 in [**5-/2138**], kaposi's sarcoma) referred in from primary care office due to tachycardia, diarrhea, fatigue x5 days with CT Torso revealing bilateral PEs as well as mesenteric mass.
Stool studies were sent and were negative for c.diff, salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, O&P, vibrio, yersinia, e.coli, crypto, giardia.
Stool viral culture and vibrio were pending at the time of discharge.
# Transaminitis:  Admission transaminases were ALT 40, AST 90, [**Female First Name (un) **] 3.2.
EBV studies showed prior infection.
# Thrombocytopenia: PLT baseline 130-200s, was 90s on admission.
Platelet count remained stable.
Other viral studies were negative as above.
Plt count will need to be followed in outpatient setting.
Will need further evaluation as an outpatient.
# Mitral Regurgitation: Pt with history of severe MR, confirmed on echo during this admission.
Transitional Issues: - PENDING labs - MMA, HHV8 viral load, urine histoplasma Ag, stool norovirus Ag, stool viral cutlure, blood cultures - will need outpt surgery eval for mass excision - will remain on lovenox until after excision, then should be transitioned to coumadin - all need [**Location (un) 2274**] onc f/u after mass is excised - will need further outpatient evaluation of thrombocytopenia, anemia, and transaminitis  Medications on Admission: Atazanavir 300mg emtricitabine-tenofovir (truvada) 200-300mg, daily Ritonavir (Norvir) 100mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1.
You had a CAT scan which showed blood clots in the lungs and a mass in your abdomen.
Stool studies were sent.
At the time of discharge, all of your stool studies were either negative or still pending.
For your blood clots, you were started on blood thinners (heparin, then switched to lovenox).
MEDICATION CHANGES - start lovenox for your blood clots - start vitamin B12 and folic acid - start atovaquone (to prevent pneumonia) - continue your HIV medications as you were taking them  *** You were given a short supply of the Lovenox and atovaquone until your mail order medications arrive.
