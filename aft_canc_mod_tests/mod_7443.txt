He underwent an LP on [**2165-3-15**] which was not suggestive of an infection.
# Persistent fevers & Coag negative Staph line infxns: Despite negative surveillance blood cultures since [**3-16**], patient experienced persistent fevers.
His Port-o-cath was removed on [**3-25**] and cultured out CoNS, and pt completed 1 week of vancomycin after the line pull.
ENT was consulted on [**4-5**] and felt that there were no evidence of sinus infection on exam despite some opacification seen on head CT. Pt was also on micafungin for positive B-glucan (127 on [**4-2**]), which was initially thought to be a false positive result (since there were several possible reasons for it such as CVVH and IVIG).
However the repeat levels were initially higher and then trended down.
Galactomannam was negative.
CTA of chest was not obtainable due to acute renal failure (see below) and VQ scan was deemed to be non-diagnostic given pt's pulm infections and anarsarca.
An echocardiogram was done which showed a hypokinetic R ventricle, felt to be suggestive PE.
Pt was initially noted to have an acute drop in Hct (6 points in 24 hours), was CT-scanned, which showed a new fluid collection in left iliacus muscle.
His Hct has been relatively stable since then.
# ARF: Thought to be multifactorial: Bacteremia, contrast dye pt received for a CT scan, supratherapeutic cyclosporine, gentamycin and acyclovir (acyclovir crystals seen in urine).
Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis.
Pt was started on CVVH initially for maximum diuresis, which was then switched to HD when blood pressure tolerated.
MRI and LP were unremarkable.
As part of an infectious work-up for low-grade fevers after transfer CT of torso was done [**4-13**], it showed increased patchy opacities in bilateral posterior lung bases, bronchospcopy was pursued.
BAL revealed gram negative rods and pt was restarted on aztreonam (given PCN allergy).
He then became febrile again, CT showed worsening confluence of opacities, and BAL showed ESBL.
# Altered Mental Status: Neuro and psych teams which had been following in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] continued to follow on the floor as his mental staus failed to improve.
Neuro work-up was repeated with a second set of MRI and LP, both of which were unremarkable.
Creatinine improved to 1.6, by first week of [**Month (only) **], however on [**5-22**] creatinine began rising again to 2.7 on [**5-24**].
Given his bleed hx, we did not anticaoagulate and were reassured by a repeat scan two days laters which showed significant interval decrease in the clot.
CDIFF and stools cultures (including cultures for atypical organisms) were repeatedly negative.
Flex sig was done with biopsies negative for both GVH and CMV.
A bone marrow bx was obtained in early [**Month (only) 205**] which showed 7% plasma cells.
A CXR and V/Q scan were obtained which were ruled low liklihood for PE, and Mr. W was ruled out.
An endoscopy was performed which showed two large necrotic chronic duodenal ulcers.
Biopsies were obtained and negative for CMV, HSV.
Pantoprozole IV was started which brought relief to Pt's pain after two days, and as of [**5-24**] abdominal exam much improved and patient is no longer complaining of abdominal pain.
Pt is scheduled for outpt audiology exam on Tuesday [**5-28**], for evaluation of hearing loss.
Plastic is following Pt but wound site is very tender and creates significant discomfort for pt... [**Date range (3) 102905**] # Afib: Currently in afib with RVR.
CMV colitis), or parasite is possible.
?negative to date - CMV: negative - Continue solumedrol 60 mg IV BID - F/u with BMT - f/u GI recs.
NPO for colonoscopy on [**2165-5-29**]/  # ESBL E.coli asymptomatic bacteruria: Patient currently asymptomatic but with UA x2 speciated as ESBL E.coli.
Infused over 30 minutes in 100 cc NS: dose 1 0.001 mg, dose 2 0.01 mg, dose 3 0.1 mg, dose 4 1 mg, dose 5 10 mg, dose 6 100 mg, dose 7 1000 mg. Tolerating desensitization well.
# Pulmonary infiltrates: Stable pulmonary exam currently without supplemental oxygen requirement.
Ordered induced sputum culture on [**2165-5-29**].
Since that time he has had decreasing amounts of melanotic stools recently, however, his HCT has been stable above 31.
Acute on chronic renal failure / hyponatremia: Patient initially presented with oliguria in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5 (feNa=0.04%), which was likely due to volume depletion from GI blood loss.
Upon transfer he was with BUN 81 Cr 1.6, FeNa 1.9, Uosm>500, CVP 11 c/w SIADH, which initially may have been [**12-17**] extubation, however, now etiologies unclear but may include pulmonary process, malignancy, pain, intracranial process (unlikely).
BMT was actively following and had recs including: Tacrolimus re-started on [**6-10**], then d/c'd due to Cr 1.6 from 1.5.
# ID: --Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID initially suggested doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1066**] for treatment, however this was deferred since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for aspergillus negative.
Respiratory Failure--resolved: Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection for emergent EGD especially in setting of recent tracheostomy cap.
Gastric lavage showed coffee grounds as well as some bright red blood.
Blood loss on the order of [**12-18**] liters initially then progressed to 5 liters.
This was later discontinued as his WBC count fell.
# Anasarca: Although he was total body fluid overloaded, he was frequently intravascularly dry requiring more fluids.
His albumin was low, 1.6, likely the reason that he was unable to retain fluids intravascularly.
He was aggressively resuscitated with blood products.
His liver enzymes were monitored.
On [**7-6**], with a recurrence of some upper GI bleed, patient's family decided to make pt comfort measures only.
