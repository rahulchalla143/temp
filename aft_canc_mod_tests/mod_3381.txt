On presentation to the ED, patient was noted to have a temperature of 101.7, heart rate of 115, blood pressure of 72/38, RR of 16, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
In the ICU, he was given IVFs to which his blood pressures responded and have been stable in the 90s systolic (his baseline).
Blood cultures from admission grew [**4-2**] pansensitive staph aureus as well as [**2-2**] hafnia alvei which was sensitive to ceftriaxone, thus he was started on nafcillin and ceftriaxone.
Cellulitis of the sking surrounding the PICC was also noted.
He has had persistent diarrhea while here, C. diff was sent and was negative x3.
A biopsy showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and he received two cycles of Rituxan-CHOP on [**2138-4-18**] and [**2138-5-15**].
Physical Exam: Vital signs: T 98.6, HR 121, BP 108/36, RR 28, 97% on RA General: Cachectic.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.

pCXR [**2138-5-30**]: Single AP upright portable chest radiograph is reviewed and compared to [**2138-5-14**].
TTE [**2138-5-30**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-2-27**], there is no significant change.
Left upper ext u/s [**2138-6-5**]: No evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity.
Micro: [**2138-5-30**], blood cultures 4/4 bottles:       STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
[**2138-5-30**], blood cultures 2/4 bottles:        HAFNIA ALVEI.

Stool: negative for Cdiff x 3, negative for O&P, stool culture negative  Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old man with diffuse B cell lymphoma status post two cycles of R-CHOP who presented with fever and hypotension in the setting of infected PICC line.
His PICC line was removed; blood cultures and PICC catheter tip grew MSSA and Hafnia Alvei.
R upper extremitiy u/s revealed a DVT of the right basilic vein extending into the axillary vein (this is where the old PICC had been).
Trans-thoracic and trans-esophageal echos were done; neither revealed a vegetation but the TEE showed an eccentric jet of aortic regurgitaion which could not be ruled out as a manifestation of endocarditis.
He will need weakly labs while on ABX, including CBC w/diff, chemistry panel, LFTs.
C. diff toxin was sent and was negative x4 during this admission.
Due to the infection and possible endocarditis, his CHOP chemotherapy will be held, but he was given 1 dose of Rituximab while inpatient.
After his sepsis physiology resolved, he was placed on a free H2O restriction of 1500 ml.
His sodium was stable in the low 130s.
Endocarditis 3.
You will need weakly labs while on antibiotics, including CBC w/differential, chemistry panel, LFTs.
