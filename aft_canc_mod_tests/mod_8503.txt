PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.5, heart rate 88, blood pressure 113/43, respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation 95% on two liters.
Chest:  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Rectal examination showed occult blood positive in the Emergency Department.
Strength was [**6-3**] upper and lower extremities bilaterally.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION:  White count 10.5 with 63% polys, 29% lymphs.
Hematocrit was 25.8, platelet count 258,000.
Sodium 133, potassium 5.3, chloride 96, bicarb 23, BUN 67, creatinine 5.6, glucose 96.
Urinalysis was negative for infection.
RADIOLOGY:  Renal ultrasound performed showed a distended bladder, some simple kidney cysts.
Chest x-ray on admission showed no acute infiltrates and slight cardiomegaly.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 86 with flat T-waves.
An nasogastric lavage in the Emergency Department was negative for blood.
The patient was transfused to keep his hematocrit above 30.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed.
A repeat colonoscopy was performed on [**8-5**] to assess for signs of bleeding.
The patient continued to bleed after the colonoscopy and the patient continued to receive multiple units of blood in order to keep his hematocrit above 30.
This was a new development as his baseline creatinine had been 0.8 to 1.0.
Serum protein electrophoresis showed 1% monoclonal light chain, however, urine protein electrophoresis showed greater than 80% light chain disease.
The patient underwent a bone marrow biopsy which showed 50% plasma cell infiltration in the bone marrow.
He required hemodialysis on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and his kidneys did not respond to therapy for the myeloma nor did they respond to the hemodialysis because patient continued to have virtually no urine output throughout his hospital stay.
This was found to be secondary to the plasmapheresis and the patient was treated with subcu and oral vitamin K.  He was given fresh frozen plasma and the last two sessions of plasmapheresis were followed by fresh frozen plasma transfusions.
Inhibitor studies were ordered.
His rate was 160 to 210.
An EKG showed narrow complex tachycardia consistent with new onset atrial fibrillation.
The patient was otherwise hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 90-105 systolic, however, he was found to have 250 cc of maroon blood per rectum.
