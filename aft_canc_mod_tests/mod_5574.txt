TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after administration of oral and 130 cc of IV Omnipaque contrast.
Axial images were interpreted in conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are small in size.
The intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
Active Issues: # Anemia: The patient was originally admitted for blood tranfusion following a finding of Hct 18 at PCP office and EGD negative for acute bleed.
On [**2143-7-23**] a colonoscopy was performed which showed a 5cm bleeding cecal mass.
A CT torse was done for staging, showing no obvious mets, but some fluid in the pelvis and an enlarged LN concerning for metastasis.
He was discharged with VNA services and instructions to have Hct checks q48-72 hours and frequent vital signs checks.
He was pan-cultured and had a chest XR done showing no acute process.
However, given the CT chest finding of possible GGOs in the LUL, he was started on levoquin for possible PNA.
He did not complain of cough, and physical exam was free of crackles and he was satting well.
Blood cultures pending at time of discharge.
On discharge, his WBC count was downtrending.
Chronic Issues:  # T2DM: Held home glipizide and ordered ISS.
- Levaquin for 5 days for possible CAP - Follow up cecal mass biopsies - Trend Hct, transfuse as necessary - Follow up blood cultures   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Information was obtained from PatientwebOMR.
A colonoscopy was performed to look in the colon for a source of blood loss.
Biopsies of the mass were taken and are pending.
While you were in the hospital you had a fever and a chest x-ray showed what might be the beginning of a pneumonia.
