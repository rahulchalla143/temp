IMAGING: CT Pelvis [**10-7**]: 1.
CT Max/Sinus [**10-8**]: 1.
An underlying dural tear and CSF leak cannot be excluded.
Diffuse intracranial hemorrhage better characterized on concurrent head CT.  CT Head [**10-8**]: 1.
CT Head [**10-8**]: No significant change compared to study performed approximately 12 hours prior.
Multifocal subarachnoid, subdural, or intraventricular hemorrhage is redemonstrated, as is a contusion involving the left inferior frontal lobe.
MRI C-spine [**10-9**]: 1.
Areas of altered signal intensity in the thecal sac may relate to blood products/pulsation artifacts or a combination of both given the presence of subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage on prior CT head study.
CT T/L Spine [**10-9**]: 1.
MR T/L Spine [**10-10**]: 1.
Diffusely altered signal intensity in the thecal sac, may relate to pulsation artifacts; however, blood products cannot be completely excluded given the presence of subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage on the prior CT head study.
CT Head [**10-10**]: 1.
PATHOLOGY: [**2122-10-8**]: Bone, left femoral head, hemiarthroplasty: - Bone and cartilage with changes consistent with fracture site.

Evaluation was carried out by ACS trauma team and ED trauma.
Imaging was obtained as per above.
CT head obtained on admission demonstrated traumatic brain injury (left frontal subdural hematoma and scattered frontotemporal subarachnoid hemorrhage).
Vital signs were routinely monitored.
Bronchoscopy was performed that demonstrated thick secretions and treatment was initiated for VAP.
A [**Location (un) **] brace was recommended by ortho spine.
Three additional units of pRBC were transfused and patient's hematocrit remained stable in the low to mid 20s for remainder of admission.
They recommended further workup of hematologic malignancy if patient manifested symptoms of hematologic dysfunction which she did not.
A HIT panel was sent for concern of low platelets during this admission and this was found to be negative.
Patient was febrile on [**10-11**] and pan cultures were obtained.
Given desaturations and CXR findings at this time VAP protocol was initiated with triple antibiotic therapy (vancomycin, cefepime and cipro).
BAL specimens demonstrated MRSA on [**10-11**] and [**10-16**].
Of note: borderline potassium of 5.6 reported on [**10-23**].
Please repeat potassium [**10-23**] and [**10-24**]  Patient was not started on home lasix dose while hospitalized because of borderline creatinine.
14. metoprolol tartrate 50 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours): hold for systolic bp <110, hr <60.
Multiple maxillofacial fractures including the posterior sphenoid sinus, anterior and posterior frontal sinus, ethmoidal air cells, nasal bone, medial wall of the right maxillary sinus and anterior wall of the left maxillary sinus and nasal bones   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 88**] at the time of discharge to arrange an appointment to be seen and to have a non-contrast CT scan of the head on the day of your appointment.
