MRI of head done day of admission showed multiple intraparencymal masses in the right frontal/temporal lobes with vasculogenic edema, increased in size compared to [**4-10**]; with increased mass effect and shift; new hydrocephalus.
An EEG was also obtained (per notes, negative).
On [**5-7**] had 2 Head CTs; the second showed a 4.1 x 3.3 cm right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated slight worsening in regional mass effect with shift of the falx approximately 6 mm to the left and effacement of the adjacent portion of the suprasellar cistern.
Had urgent repeat Head CT [**5-8**] showed large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring approximately 3.8 x 3.2 cm,  unchanged in size compared to [**2197-5-7**]; however, the overall density of this region has increased suggesting ongoing hemorrhage.
She was thus transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for frequent Neuro checks, mannitol, and close monitoring of her MAPs (goal 100-120).
Past Medical History: -Brain tumor: Tumor hx: briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname **] had presented in 6/98 with seizure (GTC) and was found on MRI to have R frontotemporal lesion; she underwent R temporal lobectomy in 7/98 and pathology revealed glioma.

CXR [**5-2**]: Lungs are low in volume, exaggerating heart size, which is probably top normal.
CT Head [**5-2**]: Overall, stable appearance of the tumor and edema in the right frontal lobe as compared to [**2197-4-10**].
EEG [**5-2**]: no report in computer but per ONC notes, (-) .
Head CT [**5-7**]: Interval placement of a VP shunt through a new craniotomy in the right frontal skull with tip terminating in the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
Head CT [**5-7**]: 4.1 x 3.3 cm right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated slight worsening in regional mass effect with shift of the falx approximately 6 mm to the left and effacement of the adjacent portion of the suprasellar cistern.
Head CT [**5-8**]:  Increased dilatation of the supratentorial ventricular system and increased intraventricular blood compared to [**2197-5-7**].
