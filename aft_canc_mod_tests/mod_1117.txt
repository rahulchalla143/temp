The patient was CT angio on [**2182-5-10**], which did not reveal a pulmonary embolus, but did show tumor progression with compression of trachea and bronchi and a right subclavian deep venous thrombosis.
Non small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2178**], status post right lobectomy in [**2178**] with metastases in [**2182**] in right axilla, thyroid and bone.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination revealed a temperature of 97.9.
Blood pressure 138/80.
Heart rate 96.
Respiratory rate 20.
Oxygenation revealed 94% on room air.
HEENT examination normocephalic, atraumatic.
Her neurological examination was alert and oriented.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 7.1 with 71 segments, 17 lymphocytes, 6 monocytes and 5 eosinophils.
Hematocrit 38, platelet 251.
PT 16.3, INR 1.8, sodium 137, potassium 4.1, chloride 102, bicarb 23, BUN 10, creatinine .5, glucose 88, albumin 3.5, calcium 9.2, magnesium 1.9, phosphorus 3.8.
CT angiogram on [**5-10**] revealed no PE, but did reveal extensive mediastinal disease with distortion and compression and invasion of the airway with interval increase since [**4-6**].
No evidence of PE by CT angio.
The patient was brought to interventional pulmonary Operating Room on [**5-15**] where a bronchoscopy revealed significant obstruction to the trachea at main stem as well as in the left main bronchus.
A repeat flexible bronchoscopy was performed in the PACU with concerns for left upper lobe collapse with question of upper lobe obstruction from stent, but this was not clearly visualized.
The patient was continued on ventilatory support and was followed by arterial blood gas and ventilatory parameters.
Her oxygen level was brought to room air and ventilatory support was continued.
The patient's examination revealed bilateral fixed and dilated pupils, no heart or lung sounds were heard and she had no response to painful stimuli.
