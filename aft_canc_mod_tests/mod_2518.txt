Final internal length is 49 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC.
[**2170-10-16**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1.
He was taken by urology for a formalin procedure on [**2170-10-19**] and his Hct remained stable at first post-procedure.
Indirect bilirubin not elevated and haptoglobin not elevated, so patient is unlikely to be hemolyzing.
In the ICU the patient continued to have a drop in his hct secondary to blood loss.
He did not bump appropriately to platelet transfusions which supported the fact that his platelets were not functioning appropriately.
RUQ U/s negative for stentable lesions but positive for metastatic disease.
## Oral candidiasis: Thrush noted for first time on exam [**10-7**].
Patient was found to be hypotensive at 10/6 at 4 am with systolic blood pressure in the mid 80s and HR 120s.
He was given a total of 1500 cc of fluid and bp improved to high 80s systolic.
Patient's temperature was 99.3 but he was on steroids for bony mets and pain control.
The hypotension was likely due to hypovolemia from blood loss.
Urine, blood cultures with no growth to this point ??????
A urinary hematocrit was obtained and it was high.
His mentation improved and he had good urine output.
Transferred again to ICU on [**10-26**] due to hypotension in context of 1 out of 4 positive blood cultures with coag negative staph.
Given that pressure remained stable and that positive blood culture was likely a contaminant, antibiotics were stopped.
All subsequent cultures have been negative.Prior to return to medical floor palliative care was contact[**Name (NI) **] for assistance in helping to make patient as comfortable as possible - while still continuing to treat his medical issues.
Hct was stable and bumped appropriately with PRBC transfusions.
