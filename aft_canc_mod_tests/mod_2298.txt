Exam revealed a macular rash on upper chest.
WBC was 2.6 with 35% neutrophils, 21% lymphs, and 28% bandemia.
Urinalysis was negative, and CXR was reported as unremarkable.
(However, subsequent [**Location (un) 1131**] of CXR revealed LLL opacity.)
A lump developed in the area and he was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] and laryngoscopy demonstrated a post-cricoid hypopharyngeal lesion and was referred to have a CT scan of the neck.
The CT scan of the neck revealed an enhancing mass in the right pyriform sinus with extensive conglomerate adenopathy in the right level 2 and level 3 nodes.
Biopsy of the mass was positive  for squamous cell carcinoma.
On [**2197-4-13**] he underwent direct laryngoscopy and biopsy of right pyriform sinus lesion and rigid esophagoscopy.
He had a biochemical recurrence in [**2194**], status post salvage radiation therapy and has since followed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with anundetectable PSA in [**2196-11-3**].

[**2197-7-4**]: Chest X ray IMPRESSION: Increase of the left lung opacity consistent with worsening pneumonia.
[**2197-7-6**] Chest X ray: Comparison is made with multiple prior studies including all performed the day before.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The following day his blood pressures began to decrease.
An echo showed an EF of 15%, he had elevated LFT's, elevated lactate to 12.1, increasing coags and decreasing platelets indicating DIC, increasing WBC, and increasing creatinine.
Thrombocytopenia: Mr. [**Known lastname 35716**] was admitted with a platelet count of 254.
A HIT antibody test was sent and was negative.
His thrombocytopenia was ultimately thought to be due to his overwhelming infection and possible medication effects.
Increased creatinine: Mr. [**Known lastname 35717**] kidney function remained intact for most of his ICU stay with a creatinine of 0.9.
The day of his death his creatinine increased to 1.3 indicating renal failure from his sepsis.
His heart rate was initially in the 200's.
His blood pressures then decreased to systolics of 70-80's.
However, his heart rate went back into atrial fibrillation after a few minutes.
Each time his blood pressure would drop.
His blood pressure rebounded less often.
An esmolol gtt was briefly started, but this was discontinued for hypotension.
C. diff and stool cultures were all negative.
