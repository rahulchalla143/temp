LABORATORY:  After being seen in the Liver Clinic, the patient had a CT scan with contrast of his abdomen and pelvis.
This MRI showed that this mass had significant mass effect upon the inferior vena cava.
The patient also underwent preoperative laboratory studies.
Preoperatively, the patient's white blood cell count is 7.3, hematocrit 32.5, platelets 157, creatinine 1.2, ALT 41, AST 79, alkaline phosphatase 227, total bilirubin 6.9, amylase 28, lipase 81; INR 1.4.
AST 1.2.
Towards the end of the procedure, he had a platelet count of 55,000 and an INR of 2.9.
Attempts to control this blood with Argon beam, topical thrombin, Bio-Glue, Serpasil, Gelfoam with thrombin were all unsuccessful.
Blood cultures, urine cultures and sputum culture were also sent.
He had several cultures resent over the next several days for recurrence of fevers.
The patient continued to have fevers, so a CT scan was ordered on [**3-5**].
The CT scan revealed no abscess, however, did reveal a clot in the inferior vena cava; thus, the patient was started on a heparin drip.
The pathology from his operation came back hepatic-cellular carcinoma, well differentiated, with extensive necrosis.
The patient's INR came up to 1.9 on discharge date of [**3-15**] and the patient was tolerating a regular diet and stable for discharge to home with Visiting Nurses Association care.
Visiting Nurses Association scheduled for INR value on Thursday, [**3-17**], and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with the results of that, so his Coumadin dosage can be adjusted.
