Radiology Report CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2128-7-12**] 9:06 PM Final Report EXAM: CT of the chest, [**2128-7-12**].
A tracheal Y-stent has been placed since previous CT, which is patent.
Limited views of the upper abdomen show multiple foci of early arterial hyperenhancement in the liver parenchyma which have not been visualized on previous imaging (though there is no prior imaging) which includes an early arterial phase for direct comparison.
Most likely, these represent hemangiomas, but if there are liver function abnormalities, or clinical concern for liver metastases, abdominal ultrasound could be performed for correlation.

After hospitalization it was revealed that the pt had an outpt bronchoscopy that left her with some upper extremity weakness x 1 week.
Imaging of the cervical spine revealed C7 pathological fracture [**3-8**] renal cell mets.
She also underwent MRI of brain which demontrated the following: metastasis in the left frontal lobe and left occipital lobe.
She also underwent MRI c-spine which showed increased signal within the spinal cord from C2-T1 level could be due to ischemia or cord edema.
Neurologically she improved in her upper extremity exam with more stength proximally than distally.
Her lower extremity exam has remained poor.
Her NGT was removed and she was placed on thin liquids and moist ground solids.
She was re-seen by Interventional Pulmonary to assist in clearing of her secretions on [**2128-7-26**].
On [**7-28**] a CXR showed complete opacification of right hemithorax, likely a combination of atelectasis and fluid due to lack of signicicant midline shift (overall slight leftward shift) concerning for blood as patient was status-post embolization.
