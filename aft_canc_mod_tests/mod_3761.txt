Patient was taken by EMS to an outside hospital where his room air saturation was 89 percent.
At that time a CBC was obtained which revealed a white blood cell count of 12,000 with a left shift including 78 percent polys and 12 percent bands.
The patient continued to have respiratory distress and an arterial blood gas was obtained which revealed a pH of 7.19, a pCO2 of 59 and a pAO2 of 52.
A chest x-ray and KUB showed bilateral upper lobe scarring and fibrosis.
The patient's sputum grew out methicillin sensitive staph aureus and he was started on cefazolin.
While ventilated the patient's peak pressure was elevated in the 40s and his plateau pressure was elevated in the 20s.
Bronchoscopy was then performed showing compression of the right main stem bronchus and malposition of the endotracheal tube against the lateral wall of the trachea.
A subsequent chest CT was performed which revealed bullous emphysematous changes with equal scarring, external compression of the right main stem bronchus.
A CTA was not performed secondary to poor renal function.
On physical examination the patient had anisocoria with the left pupil than the right.
A head CT was obtained which showed no bleed or mass effect.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Was negative for fever, chills, cough, weight loss or change in appetite.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  [**10/2127**] echocardiogram revealing an ejection fraction of 64 percent.
[**10/2127**] Thallium stress test revealing no reversible defect.
Renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.7.
LABORATORY STUDIES:  CBC:  WBC 26.3, hematocrit 36.2, platelets 251.
PT 12.7, PTT 29.2, INR 1.1.
Chem-7:  Sodium 154, potassium 3.2, chloride 109, bicarb 34, BUN 60, creatinine 2.2, glucose 144, calcium 8.3, phos 2.7, magnesium 2.7.
Arterial blood gas:  pH 7.38, pCO2 55, pAO2 107, lactate 1.6.
Electrocardiogram:  Sinus rhythm at a heart rate of 115, normal axis.
Head CT:  No significant atrophy, no bleed or mass effect.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 100.7, heart rate 118, blood pressure 143/84, saturation 96 percent on assist control, ventolung 500, respiratory rate 16, FIO2 of 40 percent, PEEP of 5.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Pupils minimally reactive.
Extremities:  2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
Chest CT with contrast was obtained which revealed narrowing of the right main stem bronchus without evidence of associated mass lesion.
Patient underwent bronchoscopy and brushings were sent for cytology.
Blood cultures were obtained on [**2128-5-16**] and [**2128-5-18**] both of which were negative to date at time of dictation.
However, persistent white blood cell elevation and a sputum culture growing very rare gram negative rods prompted the team to re-initiate antibiotic therapy.
Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was hypernatremic at time of presentation.
His sodium was 144 at time of discharge.
A KUB was obtained which was unremarkable.
