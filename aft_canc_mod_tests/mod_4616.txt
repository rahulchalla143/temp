He was recently admitted there [**Date range (1) 86535**] after presenting with diarrhea, dysphagia, weakness, and a WBC of 15.
He was treated empirically for c. diff colitis with IV flagyl although he stopped having diarrhea upon admission so a stool sample was never sent to be checked for c.diff toxin.
He was ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes and rate controlled with IV metoprolol and digoxin.
An NGT was recommended but the medical team was unable to pass an NGT beyond the esophagus.
A repeat EGD the next day was again unsucessful.

EGD failed x 2 at [**Hospital3 **].
ECHO [**2178-2-6**] The left atrium is normal in size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
His heart rate was well-controlled after he resumed his home dose of Metoprolol PO.
After surgery, initial upper GI studies showed very little passage of contrast through the esophagus, so his diet was advanced very gradually; by time of discharge he was tolerating a soft mechanical diet.

Your heart rate was well-controlled when you were able to resume your home dose of Metoprolol.
