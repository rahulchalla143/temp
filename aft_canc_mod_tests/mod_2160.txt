Colonoscopy on [**6-10**] at OSH showed diverticulosis and hemorrhoids, which were believed to be the source of the bleeding.
She is s/p upper and lower endoscopy suggestive of duodenitis and mild gastritis, colonoscopy, and a tagged RBC scan without clear source (stomach or transverse colon).
A second colonoscopy was attempted but patient was unable to tolerate prep.
Hct was 30.7.
Her Cr was 1.5, INR 1.68, and WBC 21 (chronically elevated WBC in 18) at OSH.
Upon arrival to the floor, initial vs were T 96.3 F, HR 106 BP 127/57, RR 16, 95% on 3L NC.

Non-contrast CT scan performed due to contrast allergy.
Sigmoidal and superior rectal arteriograms demonstrated contrast extravasation in the region of distal rectum, associated with some early filling veins.
Following embolization of a superior rectal artery, there was no contrast extravasation.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # GI Bleed: The patient was transferred from an outside hospital with GI bleed requiring 7 units PRBCs.
Work-up at OSH included upper and lower endoscopy, colonoscopy, and tagged RBC scan unable to localize bleeding (either stomach or transverse colon).
However, her hematocrit remained stable.
She underwent a non-contrast CT that was limited by residual barium in her intestines from a past study prior to hospital transfer.
She was then seen by colorectal who felt that her bleeding was related to her recent hemorrhoidectomy.
She underwent iodine desensitization and tagged RBC scan that showed bleeding localized to the sigmoid colon.
Pt is at high infection risk given that she does have an open wound with stool incontinence and she will need close monitoring by wound care with frequent repositioning in bed.
The patient was admitted with crackles on exam, and CXR with cardiomegaly and evidence of pulmonary edema.
#Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient had elevated creatinine on admission with urine lytes consistent with intrinsic renal or post-renal etiology.
INR 1.5 on admission.
A C. diff toxin assay was sent on admission to MICU.
