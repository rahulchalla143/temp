Large homogeneous opacity extending from the right apex to the right hilum appears similar compared to the previous post-operative studies and could reflect a large hematoma.
CCT [**2191-3-27**]: Area of contrast extravasation in the expected location of the right middle lobe.
Echocardiogram [**2191-3-27**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
On [**2191-3-28**] his chest film showed right middle collapse.
On [**2191-3-31**] his CXR showed collapsed right lung he was taken to the operating room for flexible bronchoscopy and removal of small clot in the distal bronchus intermedius.
Series of quotidien fevers and spike to 101.8 [**4-6**] prompted CT chest concerning for infection/necrotic RML.

Chest-film serial CXR showed see above reports.
The cardiac enzymes were negative.
Echocardiogram [**2191-3-27**] with  Normal left ventricular cavity sizes with low normal global systolic function.
Amiodarone and diltiazem were titrated in relationship to HR and systolic blood pressure with patient intermittently alternating between afib and sinus rhythm.
Blood pressure 130-140 stable.
His electrolytes were replete.
Serum creatinine increased from 0.9, Peak 2.8 in setting of tobramycin, vancomycin, flagyl, zosyn for RML necrotizing PNA s/p resection.
FeNa: 1.1% and FeUrea 42% consistent with ATN likely secondary to aminoglycoside toxicity.
