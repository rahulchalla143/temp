The patient was in the facility for two days and on the day of admission the patient was found unresponsive with a heart rate of the 40s and a blood pressure of 70/48.
The patient received Atropine and was transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**] for further workup.
On course to the hospital, the patient was started on a dopamine drip and by the time that the patient came into the Emergency Department his vital signs consisted of a temperature of 99.2, blood pressure 96/48, pulse 82, respiratory rate 18.
An ABG was also done at that time that showed a pH of 7.19, PC02 65, and a P02 of 231.
On admission, it was also found that the patient's creatinine was 3.2 up from 1.7 on discharge from the [**Hospital6 14430**].
The patient had a chest x-ray that showed significant bilateral pleural effusions which was unchanged from the report obtained from [**Hospital1 2177**] on discharge.
In addition, a head CT was also obtained that showed no acute process.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99.2, pulse 60, blood pressure 110/60, respiratory rate 16 on a ventilator of assist control 550 times 16, FI02 of 40%.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, white count 16.8, hematocrit 27.8, platelets 160,000.
PT 14.8, PTT 38.4, INR 1.4, sodium 134, potassium 6.1, chloride 100, bicarbonate 24, BUN 85, creatinine 2.2, glucose 165, calcium 8.3, phosphorus 4.1, magnesium 2.3.
CK 58, troponin T 0.73.
EKG was bradycardiac with low voltage, poor R wave progression and normal axis.
based on renal clearance with a goal of vancomycin greater than 15.
The patient's blood cultures as of the time of this dictation did not grow any organisms.
However, on admission to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient's creatinine was up to 3.2 which was most likely secondary to ATN since the patient was initially hypoperfusing with a very low systolic blood pressure.
The patient's urine output also began to decrease throughout the hospital course despite several Lasix boluses.
The Renal Team also noted that the patient most likely has ATN which would resolve on its own and we should try to maintain a total fluid intake of less than 1 liter per day.
There was some concern for a cardiac involvement and so an echocardiogram was also obtained that showed an ejection fraction of 55% but that was done on dopamine.
and the patient was also started on hydralazine and Imdur to help control his blood pressure.
The patient also had an episode of abdominal pain which was thought to be secondary to constipation.
