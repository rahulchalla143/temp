He was transiently on an beta blockade for control of BP and HR and titrated off by the afternoon of POD1.
When stable he was transferred to 12 Riesman, on POD5 a decrease in his O2 saturation was noted and a chest radiographs were suggestive of bilateral pneumonia, sputum and blood cultures were collected and found to be negative.
On the floor he continued to recover but on POD9  was noted to have a significant increase in his Cr level from 0.6 to 1.6.
Renal and pulmonary services were consulted, all nephrotoxic medications were stopped or dosed renally, he was hydrated with increase in per hour rate and boluses of NS, a Vancomycin trough was checked and found to be elevated.
With renal recovery we addressed his slowly declining hematocrit with 2 units of blood, his HCT responded appropriately.
The Vancomycin was not restarted the Zocyn was discontinued after 8 days.
He was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**3-29**] as scheduled along with his Neurologist and Oncologist as scheduled.
