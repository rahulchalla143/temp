She was seen by ENT on [**12-25**] who noted true vocal cord paralysis on larygoscopy and planned to have her evaluated with neck and upper chest CT for mass which was perfrormed [**1-4**].
CT scan revealed pulmonary nodules with an esophageal mass(report not available)concerning for metastatic esophageal CA.
CXR revealed upper mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules, so CTA was performed to better characterize them.
CT revealed a new RLL mass, LLL atelactasis, enlarging left infrahilar mass, and enlarging esophageal mass which is now eroding into the trachea.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

[**1-20**] UE U/S: Limited study without demonstration of basilic and cephalic veins, however, no evidence of DVT.
If the mental status does not improve, a repeat study may be beneficial.
* Mediastinal mass: CT showed esophageal mass eroding into trachea as well as into aorta.
OSH biopsy demonstrated a squamous cell CA.
CXR [**2198-1-25**] confirmed position of stent.
Head CT, LP and MRI of the head did not demonstrate a source for the sedation.
EEG [**2198-1-24**] showed moderately severe encephalopathy.
Blood cultures were negative and 2 c. diff toxins negative.
* Anemia: Hct trending down over several days to 23-24.
CIWA scale was  ultimately dc'd [**1-19**] to sedation/intubation.
