A chest x-ray obtained at the time was remarkable for evidence of volume overload and an evolving left upper lobe infiltrate.
The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further care.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs, temperature 100.3 F, blood pressure 100/48, pulse 107, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 90% on four liters nasal cannula oxygen.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, anicteric.
ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES: White blood cell count 15.4, hematocrit 26.7, platelet count 240,000.

Sequential multiple analysis-7 131, 4.3, 102, 20, 15, 0.5, 128.
Electrocardiogram, normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 95, normal axis, normal intervals, non-specific diffuse T wave flattening, no change from prior.
2) Cardiovascular, the patient developed a high cardiac output, low SVR state on [**2185-10-21**] and after aggressive volume resuscitation required vasopressors and vasopressin to support her blood pressure.
An echocardiogram obtained on [**2185-10-21**] was notable for ejection fraction of greater then 55% and E to A ratio of 2.0 and normal right ventricular size and function, normal left ventricular size and function, 1 to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, 1+ mitral regurgitation.
All cultures to date are negative.
An abdominal CT scan early in the hospital course revealed a nodular liver edge with borderline enlarged spleen and moderate to large ascites, given her history of alcohol use and hepatitis C, it was felt that the patient was cirrhotic.
