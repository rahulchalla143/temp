She had an abdominal ultrasound done on the day prior to admission for evaluation for paracentesis, and labs drawn that day showed worsening renal function, so she was called to come in to the ED today for evaluation.
On arrival in the ED: VS - Temp 97.5F, HR 100, BP 111/70, R 20, O2-sat 91% RA.
Labs were significant for K 7.8, BUN 116 / Cr 7.2, WBC 14.3 w/ 92% PMNs, and lactate 2.0.
CXR revealed a large left pleural effusion and ECG was low voltage.
Pulsus was 10, so a bedside TTE was done to eval for tamponade, which revealed a mild pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology.
She is being admitted to the MICU for evaluation and treatment of her hyperkalemia and acute renal failure.
Evaluation revealed a mass on her right ovary that was to be removed, but CT scan prior to surgery also showed enlarged LNs, so the surgery was held off until a biopsy specimen could be taken of the lymph nodes.
?F) HR: 119 (115 - 135) bpm BP: 80/30(46) {60/15(36) - 122/88(76)} mmHg RR: 22 (0 - 32) insp/min SpO2: 98% Heart rhythm: ST (Sinus Tachycardia) Wgt (current): 104.3 kg (admission)  General Appearance: Sedated, unresponsive, intubated  Eyes / Conjunctiva: Pupils mid, responsive to light.
Positive corneal reflex   Pertinent Results: Abd u/s: Small amount ascites; Bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy  Echo: IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality.

Differential dx for shock includes sepsis, metabolic causes, cardiogenic, hypovolemia.
Consulted ID for evaluation of whether hypothyroidism could cause shock.
Her echo from [**9-15**] showed impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Most recent echo on [**9-24**] again did not show evidence of tamponade, just small effusion.
Also, echo on [**9-24**] revealed normal RV size and motion which made PE less likely.
Gave albumin challenge again on [**9-25**] and her CVP bumped to 12 and was thus able to be off of leveophed for several hours.
A repeat CT on [**9-22**] showed increased right sided effusion which was tapped on [**9-24**].
Originally admitted with K of 7.8 and Cr of 7.2.
Initial and repeat imaging of kidneys has showed continued right hydronephrosis.
Obtained tumor markers which revealed borderline high CA-125 and elevated CA27,29, but were overall non-specific.
She was eventually weaned off pressors and started on corticosteroids which improved her pressure significantly.
# Renal failure: Post stent placement by urology the patient's urine output did not improve significantly.
She was subsequently tried on HD, given albumin and fluids for volume, and eventually maintained a low but steady blood pressure with concominant tachycardia.
Her creatinine continued to trend upwards and she had multiple electrolyte abnormalities including continued hyperkalemia that was refractory to treatment.
IP was consulted but did not feel the tube needed to be replaced at that time and serial CXR were indicated to r/o PTX.
Her WBC and fever curve were monitored.
Tumor lysis labs were followed and allopurinol was started prophylactically.
