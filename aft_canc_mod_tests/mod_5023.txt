The patient had a chest CT for lung cancer that showed a large pericardial effusion.
He had an echo that showed EF 65-70%, large circumferential pericardial effusion with evidence of diastolic collapse of RA but not RV.
ECG showed no active ischemic changes and troponin T was < 0.01.
An attempted pericardiocentesis drained out only 30 ml of bloody fluid.
Repeat echo showed a 1-cm decrease in circumferential pericardial effusion.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management, including possible percardial window.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 8 cm.

TTE ([**2-16**]) Conclusions The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-1-10**], the left ventricle appears hypertrophied and small, consistent with underfilling.
TTE ([**2-18**]) Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-2-16**], the findings are similar.
CT Torso ([**2-16**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Moderate amount of intra- abdominal and intrapelvic ascites of which has a hemorrhagic component within the pelvis.
These may be inflammatory in etiology, but given underlying history of malignancy, a three-month followup chest CT is recommended if there is lack of prior exams to document stability.
Dedicated contrast enhanced cross-sectional imaging (MRi or CT) is recommended when feasible to exclude underlying renal cell carcinoma/metastasis.
Evaluation of the underlying left hepatic parenchyma is limited.
# Pericardial effusion: Large pericardial effusion noted at OSH on chest CT; TTE showed large circumferential pericardial effusion with diastolic collapse of RA but not RV.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.
Pericardial window was considered, but pt remained hemodynamically stable and repeat TTE x2 showed stable effusion.
# Small cell lung cancer: chest CT reportedly showed recurrent lung tumor.
CEA = 25 on this admission.
You needed blood transfusions for this.
Your blood counts were stable prior to your discharge.
You will need to have a repeat echocardiogram at this time.
