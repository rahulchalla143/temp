In the ED, the intitial VS t 96.6 hr 109 bp 138/83 rr 15 and pain was [**9-19**].
Physical exam showed pain with active and passive R hip rotation.
Imaging showed subcapital femoral neck fx.
Guaiac negative, cr 1.8 from b/l of 1.3.
K+ 5.8->5.6, EKG notable for new T wave inversions in V1-V4.
A CT abdomen and pelvis showed urinary retention and a foley catheter was placed.
Of note, neuropsych evaluation in [**2125**] commented that "her marked attentional impairments raises concerns around her safety, medication compliance, and other areas of functional vulnerability."

Lung apices suggestive of edema, inflammatory, or small airways disease, vs infectious process.
6mm peripherally calcified right thyroid nodule for which further evaluation with ultrasound.
EKG [**2128-2-13**] Sinus rhythm.
CXR [**2128-2-13**] IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2038-2-16**] CAROTID ULTRASOUNDS IMPRESSION: There is less than 40% stenosis within the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
[**2128-2-17**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-16**], there has been a substantial decrease in the bilateral opacification, which had been more prominent on the left and could have represented either asymmetric pulmonary edema or diffuse aspiration.
[**2128-2-18**] EKG Normal sinus rhythm with Q waves in the right precordial leads consistent with anterior wall myocardial infarction.
ACE-I was held given recent acute on chronic renal failure and preserved EF as seen on echo (see below).
# Acute Kidney Injury: Baseline creatinine = 1.3, but she presented with creatinine 1.8 -> max of 2.2 in setting of fall.
Her cardiac enzymes were followed and Trop was trended from 0.16-->0.22-->0.22, so an MI could be the etiology but this could also have been a conseqeunce of her fall.
Further syncope workup included monitoring on telemetry without significant arryhtmia, sending a tegretol level (normal), repeating EKGs (developed signs of MI), and carotid ultrasounds which were normal.
Head CT and Cspine Ct in ED were negative.
some element of hypervolemia, but phsical exam did not support this.
Echo performed this admission revealed preserved EF of 60-65% but markedly dilated RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
# Depression: dx with mild depression - Effexor therapy was continued  # Dementia/Delerium: unclear circumstances of diagnosis, per record patient reporting forgetfulness, psych testing showing mild attention deficits.

You will need a course of rehabilitation and aggressive physical therapy to regain your previous level of function.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] the meantime we did discharge you with some supplemental oxygen to keep your oxygen levels at a healthy level.
Some changes were made to your medications, as follows: 1) Your methotrexate was STOPPED, since it might have been lowering your blood cell counts when you came to the hospital.
The blood counts revcovered nicely when you were taken off methotrexate.
2) Your lipitor was increased to 80mg daily 3) You will be receiving daily injections of lovenox, a blood thinner, to prevent blood clots after your hip surgery, for the next 25 days 4) START calcium and vitamin D supplements to help with bone healing 5) START metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] to protect the heart 6) START a baby aspirin every day to protect the heart  Followup Instructions: Orthopedics: Tuesday [**3-2**] at 11:20 with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Location (un) 8661**] Building, [**Location (un) **]) .
