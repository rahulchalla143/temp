The patient's final level at the time of this dictation was a platelet count of 503.
A urinalysis was noted to have 38 white blood cells and less then 1 epithelial cell with many bacteria.
This was largely thought to be due to her severe clot burden, however, blood cultures were drawn as well as a urine culture, which were no growth to date.
It is recommended that the patient's hematocrit and INR be checked every day until therapeutic level of Coumadin can be established and dose regulated and also to watch for any signs or symtpoms of bleeding since the patient had severe bleeding in the Intensive Care Unit during prior days of this hospitalization.
