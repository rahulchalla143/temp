Colonoscopy showed diffuse erythema, friability, exudates and ulceration likely pseudomembranes in the rectum and sigmoid but biopsies were normal.
Continues to have diarrhea, stool studies repeated [**11-3**] and [**11-4**] for C.dif tox, culture and ova/parasites all negative.
for continuing diarrhea - 1. malabsorption: supported by positive fat, possibly [**1-5**] to his intra-hepatic cholestasis.
# Grave's disease: newly diagnosed per elevated TFTs ([**10-26**] Ft4 2.3 TSH < 0.02) and positive TSI Ab ( = 337 normal < 140).
Will need continued follow-up of his liver functions including INR and PTT.
Thus anemia is likely multifactorial and secondary to chronic illness + CRF + possible malabsorption and occult GI bleeding.
Iron labs should be followed and repletion considered.
