Hct was stable at 31.0.
Had an NG lavage which was completely clear for coffee grounds, blood and was so negative that the tube was removed for presumed LGIB, and not given IV Protonix.
He had no further bleeding episodes in the ED and his systolics were 89 to 107 in the ED without any reflex tachycardia.
Vitals before transfer: 59  98/56  13  98% 2L NC  Review of OMR notes shows normal systolics run in the 120's and Hct had a noticeable drop from 40 in [**2-/2158**] to mid-high 20's in [**8-/2158**], which was associated with symptoms), for which he was evaluated by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
He was then seen in the ED early [**9-/2158**] for chest pain, SOB/DOE, chronic rectal bleeding with admission for transfusions (4u with Hct increase from 23.7 --> 33.8) with symptomatic improvement.
Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 16937**] notes, it appears pt had a stress test 2 yrs ago which showed "previous inferior MI."
Past Medical History: - depression - hypertension - hypercholesterolemia - prostate cancer s/p radiation treatment (completed [**9-/2156**]) and hormone shots (last [**12/2156**] per OMR notes) - diarrhea and abdominal pain responsive to pancreatic extracts - rectal bleeding with colonoscopy [**4-3**] showing radiation proctitis; acute anemia in [**8-/2158**] with repeat colonoscopy again showing radiation proctitis s/p Argon therapy of proctitis [**2158-10-27**] - Stress test/echo [**2156-3-29**] resting inferior wall abnormality c/w old MI.
Radial pulses are easily palpable Abd obese NT ND, BS+, benign Extrems are without edema, 2 well placed 18 g PIV in bilateral AC's, warm and well perfused, no palmar cyanosis and good cap refill CN2-12 intact, no focal neuro deficits noted, moving all extremities, mental status lucid and conversant   Pertinent Results: 139  104   46 -------------- 184 4.3   26   1.6  WBC 8.6  N75 L15.6 E4.2 o/w normal Hct 31 MCV 82 Plts 311 Coags 14.3 / 31.7 / 1.2 UA pending  Imaging: [**2158-10-27**] Coloscopy and EGD showing diffuse increase in vascularity in distal rectum from 2 cm above dentate line to 10 cm, consistent with the appearance of radiation induced proctitis.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  EKG: NSR 64bpm, normal axis and intervals, prominent inferior Q's and suggestive Q's in V5-6 which correlate to known recent stress results.
Lower GI bleed: With BRBPR seen on digital rectal exam, negative NGL in ED, increased vascularity of distal rectum consistent with known radiation proctitis (also seen in [**3-/2158**] colonoscopy) and also grade 1 internal hemorrhoids seen on colonoscopy 2 wks ago, most likely source is lower GI tract/rectum.
Hct initially dropped from 31 on admission which was stable from prior to 24, but in the setting of having received ~4L NS.
Hct was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells and the hematocrit bumped appropriately to 25 at time of discharge.
They did not feel that repeat endoscopy was necessary.
Hypotension: Was not tachycardic and no evidence of end organ ischemia other than Cr 1.6 from normal baseline, which responded to IVF's back to normal.
Acute renal failure: With Cr 1.6 up from baseline Cr 1.1.
Suspect pre-renal etiology in face of volume loss and elevated BUN/Cr (however BUN may be elevated due to GIB).
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Throughout the admission your heart rate and blood pressure were stable.
