Two nights prior to admission, he went to void, went back to bed, but was unable to fall asleep because of the nasal congestion so he went to sit upright in chair.
A short time later, he got up to go back to bed and became acutely dizzy (lightheadedness) and had a sense of disequilibrium, walking like a "drunken sailor."
An EKG showed nonspecific ST changes.
SBP was 180 with full strength in all extremities.
An MRI showed an old frontal defect.
A head CT showed only the old frontal infarct.
ROS was negative for fevers/chills, no SOB, chest pain, abdominal pain, or dysuria.

Pertinent Results: Admission labs: 144  107  28 -------------<160 4.0  25  1.0 Ca: 9.3 Mg: 2.2 P: 2.7 Cholesterol:124 Triglyc: 78 HDL: 43 CHOL/HD: 2.9 LDLcalc: 65 PT: 31.4  INR: 3.3 Cardiac enzymes negative x 3  Imaging: BRAIN MRI [**11-19**]: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of slow diffusion to indicate acute infarct.
A focused MRI of the posterior fossa with gadolinium-enhanced images would help for further assessment.
MRA OF THE HEAD [**11-19**]: Normal MRA of the head.
MRA OF THE NECK [**11-19**]: No significant abnormalities on MRA of the neck with and without gadolinium.
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST [**11-22**]: No new areas of intracranial hemorrhage are identified.
Exam was notable initially for upgaze and lateral nystagmus, dyarthria, right ataxic hemiparesis, left hemibody numbness and bifacial numbness.
While in the ICU, his strength worsened and an MRI showed hemorrhage in the right medulla consistent with a cavernous angioma.
During tracheostomy placement, he had a BAL off antibiotics; cultures from the BAL were negative so antibiotics were not restarted.
Neuro: After intubation, his neurologic examination remained stable with intact mental status as best as could be assessed (following commands, answering questions appropriately) and right sided weakness, LE>UE.
He had a head CT which did not show any evidence of herniation.
- RUL PNA on CT [**12-5**] and leukocytosis - started on levo [**11-20**] (?asp pna), already on azithromycin -> vanco/levo/flagyl (d/c'd azithro [**11-24**]), fluc added [**11-25**] for Scx w/ yeast.
