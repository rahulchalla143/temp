Bone scan showed osseous met to L 7th rib; head CT negative for brain mets during this initial workup.
[**8-2**]: Restaging CT scan shows no evidence of disease progression.

[**2107-10-12**] MR thoracic & cervical spine w/o 1.Increased signal in the prevertebral soft tissues from C2-C4 on STIR sequence, which could represent edema, inflammation, or superimposition of adjacent tissues.
[**2107-10-12**] CXR New bilateral, left much greater than right, and predominantly lower lobe interstitial and nodular opacity; given history of elevated white blood cell count and immunosuppresion raises the concern for an opportunistic pneumonia.
[**2107-10-14**] CT chest 1.
Reevaluation with contrast- enhanced study might be warranted if clinically justified.
[**2107-10-14**] Transthoracic Echo The patient is tachycardic; LVEF >55%.
[**2107-10-17**] MRI L shoulder w/o 1.
[**2107-10-17**] Right Upper ext ultrasound Limited study but no evidence of right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.
[**2107-10-21**] MRV chest w/o 1.
Limited evaluation of the central vessels without the administration of gadolinium due to the patient's low eGFR.
Non-visualization of the right subclavian and right axillary veins, suggesting possible occlusion.
[**2107-10-23**] CT head w/o No evidence of infarction or hemorrhage.
Evidence on blood cultures from admission until [**2107-10-17**].
ID consulted, followed closely with recommendations on vancomycin(start [**10-12**]) & gentamycin([**Date range (1) 68752**]) for synergy, levels were closely monitored.
Given worsening lungs on imaging and sputum positive for MRSA, Linezolid was initated for a weeks duration.
# Pulm infiltrates: CT chest concerning for septic emboli versus primary pulmonary infection.
Pt without subjective shortness of breath or chest pain, however O2 requirements.
Head MRI did not show any acute CNS process, LENI's were negative and echo without evidence of RV strain making PE unlikely.
Concern for meningitis/encephalitis or new brain lesions but CT head without evidence of lesion.
# Body/joint pain: Initially admitted with neck & upper back pain, however without focal findings on neurologic examination or point tenderness over spine.
MRI C & T w/o showed increased signal in the prevertebral soft tissues from C2-C4 on STIR sequence which could represent possible edema, inflammation or abscess but limited as no further imaging with constrast due to limited GFR.
Imaging of bilateral joints revealed effusions, arthrocentesis revealed infection thus pt underwent bilateral shoulder washout.
# Acute renal failure: Poor GFR with Cr 6.0 on admission [**1-28**] IL-2 capillary leak syndrome.
# Elevated coagulation studies: INR initially concerning for development of DIC/consumptive process, however were relatively stable in the setting of longterm IV antibiotics & some element of liver dysfunction.
# Elevated LFTs: Liver ultrasound showed no focal abnormalities and resolved over time.
