In the ED, the patient was found to have a temperature of 104, HR 131s, SBP 76/59.
The patient was given a total of 11 liters IVF in the ED and his pressure rose to 103/60 on arrival to the MICU.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: Upon detailed analysis of the FLAIR images, comparison with the prior study shows slightly less extensive appearance of a semicircular area of heterogeneously diminished FLAIR signal in its central portion seen along theanteromedial border of the principal tumor mass.
I am not certain if this change relates to the biopsy procedure.
This finding could relate to prior intubation or potentially be inflammatory in origin, as fluid levels were seen on the prior study within both sphenoid air cells on [**2197-7-22**].
Stereotactic Biopsy and pathology results:  With the available material, the tumor is best classified as a DIFFUSE ASTROCYTOMA (or a diffusely infiltrating astrocytoma).
Further subclassification cannot be confidently determined with the available material.
The tumor should be considered a grade 2 out of 4 infiltrating glioma with low proliferative potential   Brief Hospital Course: On arrival to the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be septic with a temperature of 104, blood pressure of 76/59, and was given a total of 11L IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
He was monitored by bedside EEG and finally around 5:00 p.m. on [**7-20**] he stopped having electrographic seizures.
He was monitored by EEG on [**7-22**] with showed no evidence of any more epileptiform activity.
MRI was done on [**7-22**] and showed a right frontal lobe lesion with small areas of enhancement in the anterior and posterior area suggestive of neoplasm.
CSF cultures came back negative.
Weight based heparin was started for treatment of PE and therefore, surgery was delayed.
Finally, the biopsy was performed on [**2197-8-7**].
Pathology showed a diffusely infiltrating Astrocytoma grade 2.
EEG on [**8-10**] showed no signs of continued seizure.
He has been stable from a cardiovascular standpoint, with good control of BP with Valsartan 80mg daily.
Pt passed his swallow study on [**8-14**], NG tube was removed and he has been eating well since with no need for supplemental nutrition.
His Metformin was not restarted due to normal fasting blood sugars and minimal need for sliding scale insulin.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] neurology recommendations, pt should have drug levels monitored daily with a goal Dilantin level of [**11-18**] and a goal Phenobarbital level of 20-30.
