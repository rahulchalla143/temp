EGD (severe gastritis, no active bleeding).Mechanical ventilation resumed p-op- assist control mode and transitioned to CPAP w/ PS mode 16/8.
HIT negative x2 but low plt <50-60 persisted.
Pt anticoag w/ argatroban started for DVT [**2142-8-11**], and transitioned to fundaparinox w/ coumadin(start [**8-12**]) until INR therapeutic [**8-19**].
