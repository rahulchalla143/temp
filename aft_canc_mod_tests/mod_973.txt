PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.6, blood pressure 110/50, heart rate 66, respirating at 12, 95% on room air.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA OR STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 5.0, hematocrit 35.1, platelets 231, Chem-7 unremarkable.
Chest x-ray showed no consolidation, no widening of the mediastinum, no effusion, no lymphadenopathy noted.
CTA showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus but showed a 3 cm SVC thrombus with retrograde flow through azygous and lumbar veins returning to the heart via the inferior vena cava.
CT head also done in the Emergency Department showed no evidence of metastatic disease.
Superior vena cava clot:  The patient was noted to have a 3 cm clot in her superior vena cava likely related to her Port-A-Cath which was involved with the clot, according to Radiology secondary report.
The patient was monitored for signs of bleeding.
During the infusion the patient's Heparin drip was decreased, and she was closely monitored for neurologic, bleeding, or other signs of bleeding.
[**Name (NI) **] PT, INR, fibrinogen, platelets, and hematocrits were followed during this infusion.
If her fibrinogen was less than 150, her TPA dose would be decreased by half, and if it was less than 100 her TPA would be discontinued completely.
The repeat CTA showed complete clearance of clot along wall of the superior vena cava and a very small filling defect.
A final decision was made to have the patient fully anticoagulated on Coumadin for a goal INR of between 2 and 3.
The patient remained in hospital until her INR became therapeutic on Coumadin while on her Heparin drip until her INR was between 2 and 3.
She will have an INR checked in one day upon discharge and will be adjusted by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and then again in two days, in which Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2244**] will adjust her Coumadin dosing.
The patient's blood counts were followed closely without any evidence of neutropenia or anemia.
The patient had an MRI of her pelvis done to evaluate her persistent hip pain.
The MRI results were pending upon her discharge.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good status post TPA infusion and therapeutic INR of 2.2 upon discharge.
Outpatient laboratory work:  Patient is to have her INR checked on [**2115-1-4**] and fax results to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22294**].
She is also to have her INR checked during the weekend of [**2115-1-5**] and to have Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2244**] paged with the results and given her pager number.
