MRI Head: Prominence of ventricles and sulci consistent with global cerebral atrophy given the history of HIV/AIDS.
CT chest [**7-11**]:Multifocal ground-glass pulmonary abnormality is relatively [**Name2 (NI) 14617**] terms of extent, but in the setting of severe neutropenia it could indicate relatively widespread and serious infection, including pathogenic bacteria aswell as viral infection.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2103-7-13**]: Multiple ill-defined hepatic hypodensities without appreciable enhancement, and porta hepatis lymphadenopathy.
These findings may be compatible with infiltrative hepatic lymphoma, and a lesion in the lower aspect of segment [**Doctor First Name **] may be amenable to percutaneous biopsy as long as the hemangioma in that segment is avoided.
TTE [**2103-7-17**]: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
EF >55%.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
Nucleated red blood cells are noted on scan.
The white blood cell count appears decreased.
Platelet count appears markedly decreased; large and giant forms are seen.
Differential shows: 49% neutrophils, 5% bands, 25% lymphocytes, 10% monocytes, 1% eosinophils, 5% myelocytes, 3% blasts, 2% metamyelocytes.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation, and consists of a 1.3 cm bone biopsy diffusely infiltrated with large cells with moderate amounts of pink cytoplasm, irregularly shaped nuclei with clumpy chromatin, and prominent nucleoli.
By immunohistochemistry, these cells are positive for pan B-cell markers CD20, CD79, PAX-5, CD5 (major subset), BCL-6 (subset, dim), and BCL-2.
LMP appears negative (non-specific cytoplasmic positivity seen in scattered cells).
FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING The following tests (antibodies) were performed: HLA-DR, FMC-7, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 3, 5, 10, 13, 19, 20, 23, 34.
INTERPRETATION Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by an abnormal population of B-cells that are CD5-positive and seen within the blast window.

Hospital course has been notable for lymphoma diagnosed on bone marrow biopsy, BAL with negative PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] and urine with positive histo ag, prolonged pancytopenia, and hypotension.
Labs showed acutely worsened anemia with Hct of 18.7 - stool was brown, guiaic +.
WBC was 2.1 w/ left-shift.
A cosyntropin stimulation test diagnosed adrenal insufficiency, likely from [**Hospital1 **] therapy and possible HIV.
His blood pressure has remained stable, and he was discharged on 5mg daily prednisone.
Continues to require blood transfusions approximately 2x/week.
#Lymphoma: Patient  had a bone marrow biopsy to evaluate pancytopenia which was a dry tap and pathology with  diffuse large B-cell lyphoma, Bcl-2 +, Bcl-6 +, and CD10 negative.
The hypodense liver lesions were thought to be [**2-14**] lymphoma and liver biopsy was deferred given risk of bleeding with patient?????
He then had a prolonged pancytopenia, and started to recover his counts on [**8-10**].
CT imaging was notable for patchy ground glass opacities, hepatomegaly with hypodense liver lesions, splenomegaly and diffuse adenopathy.
Chest X-ray was unclear regarding possible pneumonia as a source of fevers, and he was initially started on antibiotics.
However, repeat chest X-rays did not supprot a diagnosis of pneumonia, and the patient clinically had no evidence of chest pathology.
An MRI head demonstrated significant brain atrophy and large ventricles but no evidence of CNS lymphoma.
Work-up revealed high levels of renal pottasium wasting.
Patient also became refractory to platelet transfusions, and an anti-platelet antibody screen was found to be positive.

You also had low blood counts and a bone marrow biopsy was done to investigate the cause.
The results of the biopsy demonstrated that you have lymphoma.
A lumbar puncture was done to determine whether or not you had disease in the fluid and you were empirically treated with injection of a chemotherapy [**Doctor Last Name 360**] into the spinal fluid.
