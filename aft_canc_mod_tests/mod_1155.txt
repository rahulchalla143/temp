An echocardiogram performed earlier today showed a moderate effusion without evidence of tamponade.
Cardiology was consulted and believed pt's symptoms were not secondary tamponade physiology based on pt's echo and pulsus <3.
Pt was given 1L NS with improvement in sbp to 105.
An ECG sinus tachycardia, old inf TW flattening.
CXR was notable for stable L pleural effusion with pleurx in place and R pleural effusion, unchanged from [**9-18**].
On arrival to the MICU, the patient in laying comfortably, saturating 97% on room air with HR 106, BP 110/69.
Biopsies were performed and pathology demonstrated adenocarcinoma, mucin-producing with few signet ring cells, moderately differentiated.
He underwent PET/CT scan [**2113-12-31**], which showed FDG uptake in the GE junction but no evidence of regional or distant metastases.
His last radiation treatment was on [**2114-3-1**], total dose 5040 cGy.
He underwent [**Month/Day/Year 12351**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy [**2114-4-25**] which demonstrated residual disease, including a positive proximal margin.
Surveillance endoscopy demonstrated friable and nodular distal esophagus and biopsy demonstrated adenocarcinoma.

Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed due to the technically suboptimal nature of this study.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-7-18**], the overall left ventricular ejection fraction appears lower secondary to increased dyskinesis of the inferior and posterior walls  CXR: IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of esophageal stent, bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, and bibasilar opacities, possibly reflecting atelectasis  MICRO: None  Brief Hospital Course: 62 yo male with advanced esophageal ca s/p palliative chemo/XRT, recurrent pl effusions s/p L pleurex, CAD s/p POBA/PCI [**2101**] who was sent in from cardiology clinic for hypotension and tachypnea.
Pt notes acute onset of pain after coughing last night and physical exam notable for reproducable pain.
ECG unchanged from baseline and echo unremarkable for new wall abnormalities this morning.
His tachypnea improved with dilaudid and he had no need for supplemental oxygen following admission.
Pt does promote poor po intake over recent weeks with 25lbs weight loss.
