SINGLE AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST: Compared to [**2134-5-9**] and chest CT of [**2134-5-5**].
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2134-5-21**] 2:52 AM CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images from the lung bases through the pubic symphysis were obtained with oral but not intravenous contrast.
Optimal evaluation of the visceral organs is limited secondary to lack of intravenous contrast.
There are numerous mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
CT PELVIS WITH WITHOUT CONTRAST: Foley catheter is seen in a partially distended bladder.
Multiple areas of small bowel wall thickening, relatively unchanged compared to prior study without evidence of abscess.
EKG [**2134-5-21**] Normal sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2134-5-9**] there has been no diagnostic interval change.
Initial ultrasonographic imaging was performed demonstrating a large amount of ascites throughout the abdomen.
An 18-gauge [**Last Name (un) 11097**] needle was advanced into the ascitic pocket.
Diagnostic samples were obtained for microbiology, cell count and differential, and chemistry.
CT ABD&PELVIS W/O C COLON TECHNIQUE  [**2134-5-25**] 5:24 PM ABDOMEN CT WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The hazy opacity with septal thickening and interstitial disease in the right middle lobe has decreased since [**2134-5-21**], likely reflecting resolving pneumonia and atelectasis.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: There is small amount of gas within patient's ascites within the pelvis, likely reflecting recent paracentesis.
CT COLONOGRAPHY: There is slightly limited evaluation of the rectum because of fluid, however, no definite rectal lesions are seen on either pre-contrast or post-contrast images.
The transverse colon is well distended on the supine images and is without polyp or evidence of cancer.
Initial son[**Name (NI) 493**] imaging demonstrated a large volume of ascites throughout the abdomen.
Immunostains of the tumor are positive for cytokeratin CK-20 and negative for CK-7, with satisfactory controls.
EGD [**2134-5-27**] Erythema and friability in the antrum compatible with gastritis (biopsy) Mass in the mid jejunum at 50cms (biopsy) Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to mid jejunum.
Fluid cytology c/w adeno CA of unclear primary and SBP growing [**Name (NI) **] and Veillonella species.
The tumor Cells are CEA positive, CDK20 positive and CDK 7 negative which is consistent w/ an Adenocarcinoma most likely originated from the GI tract, based on the patient's hx of Crohn's Disease, Adenocarcinoma of the Colon is a possibility that we need to r/o, his last Colonoscopy was [**4-3**] ys ago, and there's a hx of Malignant Polyp many years ago according to the patient.
He had a virtual colonoscopy showing evidence of multiple areas of small bowel wall thickening (have worsened since [**2131**]).
His ascitic fluid from [**5-10**] was read as large atypical cells with scant cytoplasm.
The cell block showed CK20 positive, CK7 negative, CEA positive.
Cells express CD138 and MIB fraction is 100%.
His flow cytometry from this fluid shows that 70% of cells are T-cells that express mature T-lineage antigens (CD3,5,2,7) and have a helper-to-cytotoxic ratio of 0.78.
No further cultures were positive.
Patient's Hct at baseline is in mid 30's.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
