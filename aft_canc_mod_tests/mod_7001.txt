Of note, this [**Month (only) 205**] she presented to her PCP with complaints of neck pain, double vision, and was found to have an elevated ESR.
Her biopsy was negative.
She presented to the ED and had a head CT that showed 2 lesions in the brain.
Her brain mets were treated with total brain irradiation and she is scheduled to start chemotherapy for the lung masses [**9-29**].
In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.4, BP 154/78, HR 112, RR 20, SaO2 96%.
She was given aspirin 325mg x 1 and levofloxacin 750mg IV x1 for CXR showing new retrocardiac opacity and lactate of 3.5.
She had a CTA to rule out PE that showed left pulmonary arterial invasion by the left upper lobe/hilar mass with associated occlusion with tumor thrombus of left lower lobe pulmonary artery branches as well as a moderate to large pericardial effusion.
She was transferred to the CCU for close monitoring and possible pericardial effusion tap.
On the floor, a bedside echo was performed which showed a large pericardial effusion with RV and RA collapse during diastole.

Blood culture [**2112-9-24**] and [**2112-9-25**]: No growth Urine culture [**2112-9-25**]: No growth .
ECHO [**2112-9-24**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Cardiac cath [**2112-9-25**]: .
Resting hemodynamics revealed evidence of pericardial tamponade as evident from the equalization of diastolic pressures in the RA, RV and PA.  Left and right sided filling pressures were elevated with RVEDP of 16mmHg and PCWP of 18.
Using standard technique and ECHO guidance, the blunt tipped  pericardial needle was used to the access the pericardial space via a subxiphoid approach.
Final hemodynamics after removal showed pericardial pressure to be subatmospheric, RA pressure decreased to 5 mm Hg with return of the y Descent.
SBP increased from 130 mm Hg to 170 mm Hg.
Pericardial Fluid [**2112-9-25**]: .
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2112-9-26**]): NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2112-9-28**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
CXR [**2112-9-28**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of both right and left pleural effusion.

Discharge Labs: Na 136, K 4.2, Cl 101, HCO3 17, BUN 25, Cr 0.6, Gluc 94 Ca: 8.6 Mg: 2.2 P: 3.7 WBC 11.3, Hgb  9.2, Hct 27.8, PLT  391    Brief Hospital Course: 71 y/o female with non-small cell lung cancer with metastases to the brain and C2 vetebral body, hypertension and hypothyroidism admitted with cardiac tamponade.
On arrival, she had CXR showing new retrocardiac opacity and lactate of 3.5.
She was transferred to the CCU, and a bedside echo was performed which showed a large pericardial effusion with RV and RA collapse during diastole.
CT Surgery was comfortable following the patient outside of ICU care, and patient will be transferred to heme-onc service for management and preparation chemotherapy next week.
She received metoprolol 5mg x3, diltiazem 10mg x2, Amiodarone 150mg x3, and started on amio gtt 1mg/min over 2.5h before she converted to NSR.
Pressures SBP 150-60s in CCU.
Prior to discharge, the patient felt that her blood pressure was too low.
# Anemia: Normocytic, HCT trending down now to 26.8, slow drop may be due to blood loss through pericardial drain.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have anemia of chronic disease (admission Hct 30).
She did not receive any transfusions as hematocrit remained stable throughout her admission with hematocrit ranging from 26 to 28.
# Leukocytosis: The patient has a leukocytosis without evidence of infection, no fevers, cultures were negative and there was no evidence for an infiltrate on CXR.
A fluid collection was found around your heart which ultimately required the outer lining of your heart to be opened to relieve the collection.
