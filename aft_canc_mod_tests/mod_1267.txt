CXR shows similar multifocal opacities to last admission, but also new RLL infiltrate as well as some worsening effusions/congestion.

ECHO ([**7-/2126**]): Global, diffuse HK; EF 35%  TTE [**2128-2-5**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-8-6**], overall biventricular systolic function has substantially improved, but regionality of LV dysfunction is now appreciated.
2 view CXR [**2128-2-6**]: PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**2-6**]  HISTORY: Multifocal pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-25**] through [**2-4**].
CAD risks: Given the patient's acute hypoxia and cardiac risk factors such as DM and a low EF.
Serial enzymes were checked to rule out ischemia.
A TTE showed EF 50%, mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD, mild mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: MRSA Multifocal Pneumonia Systolic Heart Failure, Acute Hypoxemia ARF on CKD stage 4  Discharge Condition: Vital Signs Stable  Discharge Instructions: Return to the ED if you having high fevers, difficulty breathing, hypotension, confusion, uncontrollable blood sugars not responding to medical management, severe abdominal pain.
