3 days PTA, the pts wife noted that the pt suddenly turned pale and his sats were 78% on RA, HR 130s.
After he layed down, his sats returned to the 90s with HR in 120s.
He was told that his CXR appeared improved from prior.
Blood cultures were drawn on [**1-21**] now with 1/2 bottles + for staph aureus.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to have a temp of 100.5, HR 140s-150s, ANC 256.
Lactate was 1.5.
CXR revealed a R pleural effusion increased in size from prior.
CTA showed no PE, however did show BL patchy and nodular opacities c/w an infectious process as well as a large R pleural effusion  TTE showed a small pericardial effusion (no tamponade)new from [**1-10**].
The pts R PICC line was d'c/d given + blood cx for coag +staph aureus from [**1-21**].
-s/p inguinal hernia repair -Cardiomyopathy: Moderate pericardial effusion and markedly reduced EF (20%) noted on echo in [**9-19**], presumed viral vs. chemotherapy induced.

TTE [**1-22**]: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-1-9**], a very small posterolateral pericardial effusion is now present (no tamponade).
CTA [**1-22**]: PA are patent without filling defect.
Urine cx, stool cx, sputum cx for aerobic, fungal, afb, legionella, blood cx were all drawn on admission.
760cc of semi-bloody/serosanguinous fluid was drawn off.
The pleural fluid grew MRSA, and it is likely the pt seeded his pleural fluid by an infected PICC line (given the MRSA on [**1-21**] blood cx prior to PICC line removal).
Survelliance cultures were drawn that grew out VRE.
His pigtail catheter drain eventually stopped draining, and repeat CT scan showed that it was in good place, and radiology evaluated it and it was working fine.
ABG on admission was 7.46/37/177.
Although the pt had pleuritic CP, CTA was negative for PE.
His oxygen requirement was stable on the floor, being kept at 3L NC or shovel mask per his comfort, without any desaturations.
It was noted at some points that his HR would increase and BP would decrease, so his beta blockers were increased.
He was discharged on toprol xL 25 and lisinopril 10 for rate control and afterload reduction.
Per pt, he requires frequent PRBC transfusions and functions best at hct 26-27 at least.
Received 10 mg Vit K on [**1-24**] for INR 1.5.
His hct was 33 on discharge.
Cardiomyopathy:  The pt has known dilated cardiomyopthy with EF 20%.
Pt is s/p recent pericardial drain, however repeat TTE on admission showed only small pericardial effusion and EF still 20%.
THis improved the forward flow, and his HR actually decreased on this regimen.He was discharged on toprol xL 25 and lisinopril 10 for rate control and afterload reduction.
Imaging revealed only hemosiderin changes, and no heptosplenic candidiasis (on MRI).
A bone scan did not have any revealing source of new bone lesions ot account for this incerase.
# CODE: DNR/DNI - he made this decision with his wife and family and DR. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] during this hospitalization.
Valacyclovir 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]--for HSV acyclovir and gancyclovir resistance 3.
Voriconazole 200 mg q12--for aspergillus 8.
Folic acid 12, Pentamadine q 2 wk   Discharge Medications: 1.
