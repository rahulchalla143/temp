**FINAL REPORT [**2113-5-1**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2113-5-1**]):       PROTEUS MIRABILIS.
#  METS TO BRAIN/LEFT HEMIPLEGIA:  Patient now with new hemiplegia and report of hemorrhagic mets to brain (upwards of 6) on MRI at OSH.
Likely mets are from previous adenocarcinoma of lung, which is currently being treated by heme/onc (now on regimen of Taxotere).
Patient also had INR ~3 at OSH (on coumadin for history of PE, afib), contributing to bleeding around site of mets.
As per report, MRI also showing cerebral edema.
At OSH, patient was started on decadron and Keppra; neuro exam has been stable since arrival.
CT head showed new hemorrhage, as above.
Radiation oncology saw the patient and began brain XRT, of which 6 of 10 treatements were completed.
# UTI:  Pt had postive urine culture after leukocytosis noted.
