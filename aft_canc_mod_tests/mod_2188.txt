CHEST CT WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Please note, evaluation is limited secondary to lack of intravenous contrast administration.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Please note, lack of intravenous contrast administration limits detailed evaluation of the intra- abdominal organs.
The abdominal portions of the large and small bowel appear grossly unremarkable.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Please note, lack of intravenous contrast administration limits detailed evaluation of the pelvic organs.
Extensive axillary, hilar, mediastinal, portal, and inguinal lymphadenopathy likely consistent with patient's underlying history of T-cell lymphoma.
Please note, detailed evaluation of the intrathoracic, abdominal, and pelvic organs is limited secondary to lack of intravenous contrast administration.
Highly irregular, thickened gallbladder wall without distension is better evaluated on concurrent ultrasound examination from the same date.
No additional findings on this limited non-contrast CT evaluation.
Mild-to-moderate abdominal and pelvic ascites of unclear etiology.
Vanco trough 13.4 Beta-glucan pending, Galactomannan pending, Mycoplasma DNA pending Blood Cx pending Nasopharyngeal Aspirate for Fungal Cx pending Rapid Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen negative, Cx pending  IMAGING: ECG ([**10-5**]) - Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response.
ECG ([**10-6**]) - Sinus rhythm; Consider left atrial abnormality; Low limb lead QRS voltages - is nonspecific .
Portable CXR ([**10-4**]) - Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
Abdominal US ([**10-5**]) - 1.
CT Torso without Contrast ([**10-4**]) - 1.
Extensive axillary, hilar, mediastinal, portal, and inguinal lymphadenopathy likely consistent with patient's underlying history of T-cell lymphoma.
Mild-to-moderate abdominal and pelvic ascites of unclear etiology.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 72-yo retired pediatrician with a recently diagnosed T-cell lymphoma s/p one cycle of CHOP (D+26), who presented with fever, rash, persistent dry cough, elevated LFTs, acute renal failure, and worsening oxygen requirement, transferred out of the ICU for continued care.
CXR on admission was unremarkable, and non-contrast chest CT was also non-specific.
Culture data has all shown NGTD, with Urine Legionella antigen negative, Mycoplasma pneumonia DNA not detected, and beta-glucan and galactomannan currently pending.
His hypoxia greatly improved since his admission, with resolution of his dyspnea and tachypnea, and weaned off oxygen to room air.
A repeat portable CXR was non-diagnostic, and the patient completed his full course Azithromycin as an inpatient.
His CXR was unremarkable as above, and non-contrast chest CT was non-specific.
A repeat portable CXR was again non-diagnostic.
His INR was supratherapeutic to >7 on admission, and reportedly up to 9 at OSH.
He received Vitamin K, and his INR trended down to below 2.0 prior to restarting his coumadin.
He was discharged to home with a plan to restart his coumadin at 5mg daily for now, with daily INR checks and adjustments to be made to his coumadin dose.
BRBPR - The patient described 1 episode of BRBPR when trying to move his bowels.
He also has known sigmoid diverticula, seen on a screening colonoscopy here 5 years ago.
His vital signs were stable, but his hematocrit slowly trended downward to 30 from 37.5 before stabilizing.
The did however recommend further work-up of the gallbladder, including labwork and an MRCP.
Heparin-dependent antibodies were negative for HITT, with anti-platelet antibody pending, but the patient's platelet count was recovering prior to discharge, up to 178 from a nadir of 50. .
His Flagyl was discontinued given the low likelihood of cholecystitis, and he was seen by GI and General Surgery, who recommended further work-up including a HIDA scan / MRCP.
His HIDA scan was negative for cholecystitis, with hepatitis serologies, CMV viral load, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody, and total IgG pending on discharge.
MRCP was not done given his improvement and the negative HIDA scan.
Initial DDx included drug rash to Levaquin, infectious, or lymphomatous involvement.
Evaluation by Dermatology advised that the rash is most likely a drug reaction to Levaquin, and it was recommended that he use topical Clobetasol for treatment.
Acute renal failure - The patient initially presented to OSH with Cr 2.2, up from baseline 1.1.
Urine lytes reportedly consistent with pre-renal picture, and Renal U/S essentially normal.
His creatinine improved to baseline with IVF hydration.
T-cell lymphoma - The patient was diagnosed with T-cell lymphoma approx 4 weeks prior to his admission, and is now s/p first cycle of CHOP (D+26).
Further chemotherapy is to be determined by the pt's primary oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3315**], at [**Hospital1 4601**].
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Lovenox 120 mg/0.8 mL Syringe Sig: One [**Age over 90 **]y (120) mg Subcutaneous once a day: Until therapeutic INR achieved on coumadin.
Coumadin 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day: Dose to be adjusted based on INR daily.
Drug Rash 10. history of DVT Secondary Diagnosis: - T-cell lymphoma   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable, off supplemental oxygen, pain-free, with resolving rash, normalizing laboratory values including platelet count, white blood cell count, LFTs, renal function tests, and INR .
Imaging tests including chest X-rays and CT-scans of the torso showed a possible pneumonia.
A liver/gallbladder ultrasound showed a thickened gallbladder wall but no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
You also had one episode of bloody stools, so you were evaluated by Gastroenterology, who felt that the bloody stools were likely hemorrhoidal and did not warrant further work-up at this time.
You were also seen by General Surgery for your gallbladder findings, and a HIDA scan was done which was negative.
Liver work-up for your gallbladder findings was also done, all of which was normal or is still pending.
As you continued to do well, your platelet count trended back up to normal, your LFTs trended down to normal, your acute renal failure resolved with hydration, your rash resolved, your INR trended back down to a therapeutic level, and your fevers resolved and you did not require any further supplemental oxygen.
You should come to the outpatient clinic on 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] at [**Hospital Ward Name 42299**] daily to receive your Ertapenem and Lovenox, and to get INR checks.
You should resume your coumadin tonight and continue to take 5mg daily until otherwise advised based on your INR levels this week.
