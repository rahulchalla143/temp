CT or MRI is recommended for further evaluation of the gallbladder, as well as the left lobe hepatic nodule.
# MRI ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST [**2168-4-17**] 1.
Dedicated CT examination is recommended to rule out metastasis.
# CXR [**2168-4-19**] Mediastinal silhouette with left mediastinal shift, most likely due to left lower lung atelectasis/volume loss, is unchanged.
Lung volumes remain very low.
# ERCP [**2168-4-25**] Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal Major Papilla: 2 previously placed plastic stents placed in the biliary duct were found in the major papilla.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification.
Multiple balloon sweeps were performed and large amount of blood clots and blood was extracted.
Given tumor in the common hepatic duct and a double pig tail biliary stent was placed  # CTA CHEST [**2168-4-27**] 1.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
# RIB BILAT, W/AP CHEST Study Date of [**2168-5-4**] IMPRESSION: 1.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2168-5-6**] FINDINGS:  Whereas the left hemithorax was previously completely opacified, there is now marked improved aeration of the left upper lobe, with residual atelectasis involving the left lower lobe.
Small-to-moderate pleural effusion on the left is difficult to compare to the previous study for change due to the presence of complete lung collapse on the prior exam.
Brief Hospital Course: 61M w/ HIV, Hep C cirrhosis, HCC with recent admission for CAP, presented with RUQ pain and increasing bilirubin with progression of HCC on imaging, s/p ERCP with stent placement on [**4-25**] resulting improvement in tbili.
At time of discharge, he was stable on 2 liters of supplemental oxygen via nasal canula with oxygen saturation maintaining in the mid 90s.
# VRE and Staph epidermidis Bacteremia: Pt was found to be bacteremic with multiple blood cultures positive for VRE and s. epidermidis on [**4-19**].
Surveillance cultures cleared on [**4-29**].
His rib xray revealed multiple subacute fractures, likely responsible for his pain.
Thus, he underwent cyberknife [**5-4**], which provided dramatic improvement in his pain.
His C diff assay was negative on multiple occasions, as were stool studies.
His course was continued and repeat PCR showed no evidence of C diff.
He would like to forgo any further treatment for his HCC, but should he change his mind, he should have a repeat ERCP in 6 to 8 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
