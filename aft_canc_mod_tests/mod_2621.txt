In clinic, he was placed on 4L nasal canula and O2 sat increased to 93% with resp rate of 40.
Given sodium bicarb, calcium chloride, insulin with D50 for K 6.8.
EKG showed low voltage and bedside Echo with pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology.
CXR with pulm edema, bilateral pleural effusions.
Resection of a right seventh rib metastasis, which revealed metastatic high-grade renal cell carcinoma.

WBC 9.4 Hct 29.4 Plt 250 MCV 103 N:86.1 L:6.7 M:6.9 E:0.2 Bas:0.2 .
PT: 16.5 PTT: 27.2 INR: 1.5 .
A focal consolidation, particularly on the left, cannot be excluded.
ECHO ([**8-25**]): Large pericardial effusion.
RV diastolic collapse, c/w impaired  fillling/tamponade physiology.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Cardiac Cath/ Pericardiocentesis ([**8-25**]): 1.
Pericardiocentesis revealed initial elevated pericardial pressure of 35mmHg subsequently decreasing to 13mmHg after drainage of 1.4 liters of serosanguinous pericardial fluid.
ECHO ([**8-26**] - s/p pericardiocentesis) LV wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45%).
ECHO ([**8-28**]): Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with inferolateral akinesis and inferior hypokinesis.
Overall LV systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-8-27**], left ventricular  wall motion abnormlaity appears similar.
ECHO ([**8-30**]): [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated.
RA pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
LV wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-8-29**], the size of the effusion is slightly greater around the right atrium, but transmitral Doppler no longer suggests impaired filling.
Left ventricular systolic function is similar.
Patient was known to have a pericardial effusion by CT on [**2145-8-9**] (2 weeks prior to admission.
Echo showed intermittent RV collapse suggestive of tamponade and a significant pericardial effusion.
A repeat echo the morning after pericentesis showed resolution of the effusion.
Drain output decreased and so the pericardial drain was removed on [**2145-8-26**].
Serial echocardiograms showed a gradual reaccumulation of pericardial fluid, but no acute signs of cardiac tamponade.
He will go home with repeat echo on Thursday ([**9-2**]) with close follow-up with his outpatient cardiologist.
Patient has CXR consistent with pulmonary edema, likely secondary to decreased cardiac output from pericardial tamponade.
Baseline creatinine is 1-1.2.
Creatinine improved with drainage of pericardial fluid and gentle diuresis.
Lung metastases were treated with cyberknife.

You have an echocardiogram scheduled for Thursday ([**9-2**]) to look at the amount of fluid around your heart, your cardiologist will Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 45513**] will follow-up the results with you.
