Has had 6 months of left leg parastesias, he saw a neurologist who performed a lumbar MRI and EMG which were normal.
His symptoms continued to worsen he developed total left side parastesias and became ataxic at that time his primary care obtained a brain MRI which found a 3.4cm right cerebellar mass with compression of 4th ventricle.

[**2195-9-25**] 8:12 AM Angiogram Evaluation demonstrates a vascular mass with mural nodule in the right cerebellar lobe.
[**2195-9-26**] 2:54 PM MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]: MRA, MRV, WAND STUDY and STEALTH PROTOCOL There is an enhancing, partially cystic mass identified in the right superior cerebellar hemisphere indenting on the pons and the fourth ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: 52M, c/o 6 months of paresthesias on the left leg MRI showed with cerebellar mass compressing 4th ventricle .
On physical exam he was found to have a left testicular mass an ultrasound showed a cyst.
Further malignancy work up showed a hypodense area on spleen likely a simple pseudocyst and right lung bleb othewise normal.
A diagnositic cerebral angiogram on [**9-25**]: Highly vascular tumor, likely hemangioblastoma.
Mr [**Known lastname 63390**] case was presented to brain tumor conference and to neurosurgeons at [**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **] it was determined the best course of care would be surgery to resect the tumor.
He was in the ICU for 5 days with a right frontal EVD on a steroid taper and Mannitol Q 6 hours and an exam of awaking briskly to voice following commands.
On rounds the morning of [**10-12**] he was found to extremely lethargic not following commands, a stat head CT revealed in the right cerebellum is a large area of hemorrhage extending around and compressing the brainstem.
Over the next few days his exam waxed and waned sometimes thought to be associated with ventricular drain output, at one point the EVD stopped working for nearly 24 hours then began to work again, he continued on Q6 hour Mannitol.
At midnight on [**10-20**] a head CT was done that showed good placement of VP shunt, slit ventricles but a reaccumulation of fluid in the epidural space and his exam he appeared more lethargic than the day prior.
Numerous blood studies were sent including Thrombin =18.7, Fibrogin=586, Factor 8=167, VWF AG 196, VWF COF 162 no immediate source was identified for causing coagulation problems.
An Endocrine consult was obtained due to increase urine output, lab work revealed a normal sodium and serum osm and uris osm, they felt Mr [**Known lastname **] was  diuresing all the fluids from his hospital stay.
On [**10-28**] a repeat CT showed a partial reaccumulation of fluid in the epidural space however neurologically he was improving steadily every day with following commands briskly responding appropriately to yes/no question and able to pivot out of bed with PT.
