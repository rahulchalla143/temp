A CXR showed cardiomegaly, a retrocardiac infiltrate/atelectasis, and ?pericardial effusion per report.
An ECHO done on [**9-30**] showed an EF >55%, mild LVH, and a 4-5cm circumferential pericardial effusion, respiratory variation R+L ventricle, and R atrial collapse.

Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.

Hemodynamics on entry showed equalization of pressures in the RA and pericarium, which is diagnostic of pericardial tamponade.
Pericaridal needle was inserted into the pericardial space under pressure and ECG guidance.
Echocardiogram done after the pericardiocentesis showed a small pericardial effusion with no echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
Post-pericardiocentesis ECHO ([**10-1**]): Conclusions: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
A round extrinsic mass (approximately 3 cm in diameter) abutting and compressing the right atrium is now seen  Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2190-10-1**], most of the fluid in the pericardial sac has been removed.
An ECHO showed a collapsing RA concerning for tmponande, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for pericardiocentesis.
Repeat ECHO [**10-2**].
Cytology was negative for malignancy.
-- Rate/Rhythm: sinus tachycardia - question of possibly [**2-15**] anemia - received 1 unit of blood, fluid boluses without change; may be secondary to RA mass (compensatory for decreased in flow) -- Mass: 3cm extrinsic mass compressing RA - ?etiology - chest CT to better visualize in AM once drain is removed.
-- Pump: EF >55% 2.
Respiratory: good oxygen saturations on room air; CXR - no evidence of metastatic disease; long smoking hx - COPD - nebs PRN 3.
Renal: creatinine stable 4.
Cultures drawn, negative at time of discharge.
You have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], a GI oncologist, on [**10-22**] at 10:30.
