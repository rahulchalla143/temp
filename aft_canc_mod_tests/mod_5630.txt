CT Abdomen [**12-25**] 1.
CT Abdomen [**12-26**] 1.
Renal U/S [**12-11**] 1.
Diuretics were held given acute renal failure and hyponatremia (below).
For the first 2 weeks of her hospitalization, INR was stable at baseline 1.7-1.9.
Total bili was also at baseline.
During the third week of her hospitalization, both INR and bilirubin crept up.
# intra-abdominal bleed - diagnostic paracentesis [**12-23**] in LLQ, then with steady downward trend of hct, then with acute hct drop to 18 on [**12-26**], requiring 10uPRBC with 4uFFP and 1u platelets.
Repeat CT scan of abdomen showed intra-abdominal bleed.
# acute on chronic renal failure:  Creatinine 2.0 on admission, up from recent baseline 1.5.
Creatinine continued to rise, and she was given pRBC with a goal to increase perfusion by keeping hematocrit >28.
With this treatment, creatinine stabilized at 2.5.
Octreotide, midodrine, and albumin were discontinued and creatinine trended down during admission to 1.2-1.4 but was slightly increased to 1.6 on [**1-11**] after diuretics restarted [**1-11**].
# hyponatremia:  Diuretics were held, and sodium rose into the 130s.
Iron studies were consistent with underproduction secondary to renal failure.
She initially received pRBC to keep Hct >28 as above.
Subsequently her hematocrit was stable in the low 30s without any transfusion requirement.
Vitamin D levels were checked and were still pending at time of discharge.
Calcium on discharge was 10.3. .
An FNA was performed and showed papillary carcinoma.
Pt has a f/u appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5182**] in [**Month (only) 404**] for evaluation for surgery.
Follow-up cultures were negative.
Follow up cultures only grew yeast.
Urine phorphobilinogen was sent for possible PCT and was negative.
Serum porphyrins were still pending at time of discharge.
Regular insulin sliding scale and lantus were initiated and sugars were better controlled 140s-160s.
