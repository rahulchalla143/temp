RENAL U/S: 1.
The patient's blood pressure improved with IVF boluses and antibiotics.
Eventually, her urine grew out E. coli that was resistent to ciprofloxacin and renal U/S was performed which revealed mild right hydropephrosis, right staghorn calculus as well as small non-obstructing stones in the left kidney.
All laxatives were held and stools sent for culture and c diff toxin.
Urine culture showed E. Coli resistent to cipro.
Urine lytes showed indeterminate etiology.
Kept on IVF and Cr trended down re-inforcing diagnosis of pre-renal etiology.
At the time of discharge her creatinine was 1.0. .
Laxatives held and pt monitored on tele overnight.
Her potassium remained stable and required minimal repletion.
She was refusing repletion and so was discharged with a magnesium of 1.4. .
Urine sent for culture and fever curve monitored.
