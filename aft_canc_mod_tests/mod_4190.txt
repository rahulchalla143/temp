**FINAL REPORT [**2135-8-18**]**     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2135-8-18**]):       Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
IMAGING: MRI Spine [**7-3**]: 1.
Sagittal post-contrast images suggest that this collection contains fluid at the level of C2, which would indicate an abscess rather than a phlegmon.
However, axial post-contrast images suggest that the central hypoenhancing portion of the collection at C2 may not be fully liquefied, or that the fluid may be highly viscous.
Contrast enhancement surrounding the L4-5 facet joints may represent inflammation secondary to the severe degenerative facet arthropathy, but septic facet arthropathy cannot be excluded  Echo [**7-4**]: IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality.
Normal left ventricular cavity size with preserved global and regional systolic function  MRI Spine [**7-4**]: 1.
CTA [**7-9**] IMPRESSION: 1.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**8-12**] Significant increase in volume of the epidural fluid collection/abscess extending from the uppermost C1 epidural space to the inferior aspect of the study at L1, largest at the upper cervical spine where it measures approximately 1 cm in greatest thickness.
CT-Thoracentesis (drainage) [**7-13**] IMPRESSION: Successful diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis yielding 270 cc of serosanguineous fluid from the right pleural cavity.
New soft tissue paraspinal pockets of fluid collection are seen in the lumbar region since the examination of [**2135-7-2**] and [**2135-7-4**], visualized in the lower lumbar region involving the psoas muscles and the erector spinae muscles.
Epidural collection in the cervical region extending from C2 inferiorly is not significantly changed since the MRI of [**2135-7-14**].
CT-Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**7-26**] IMPRESSION:  1.
Stable appearance of mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
CT-Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**8-1**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Multiple soft tissue abscesses appear similar to prior examination with erector spinae abscess on the right, left iliopsoas abscess, and fluid pockets overlying the lower lumbar spine spinous processes.
Cholecystitis is not excluded, although the appearance is stable compared to prior examination and has been previously evaluated with ultrasound.
MRI C-Spine [**8-6**] IMPRESSION: Again, epidural enhancement and abscesses identified in the anterior cervical region.
As described above, the fluid collection around C2-C3 level appears slightly increased in thickness, but the differences in measurements are small and this could also be due to partial volume averaging, but continued followup is recommended.
Otherwise, the examination is stable  MRI T-Spine [**8-6**] IMPRESSION: Overall stable appearance of the thoracic spine compared to the previous MRI of [**2135-7-21**].
CT Scan Abd/Pelvis ([**8-9**]): with abdominal pain of unclear etiology, look for possible underlying abdominal abscess.
COMPARISON: CT torso from [**2135-8-1**].
FINDINGS: Of note, evaluation of abdominal organs is limited without any intravenous or oral contrast administered.
The small area of hypoattenuation seen in the left kidney on the previous study was not appreciated on the current exam.
CT PELVIS W/O contrast: Once again seen is a low-attenuation fluid collection in the left iliopsoas muscle, extending from the lower lumbar-upper pelvic regions along the psoas.
This appears unchanged from the previous study of [**2135-8-1**].
Regarding further initial infectious work-up at that time: a TEE was obtained which showed no vegetations; CT head without evidence of intracranial abscess.
On [**2135-7-6**], antibiotic coverage was narrowed to nafcillin when cultures from abscesses, right knee, and blood grew MSSA.
Surveillance imaging obtained on [**7-12**] which demonstrated increased epidural collection within anterior cervical epidural space and displacement of the cervical cord.
After reviewing microbial date with all cultures + MSSA, her antibiotic coverage was again narrowed to nafcillin.
Patient had been doing well with normalized temperature and WBC however four days after starting nafcillin, developed a abdominal rash.
Follow-up CT torso was obtained on [**8-1**] due to persistent fevers on cefepime and vanc; finding were stable to previous imaging and cefepime was discontinued.
Surveilance MR C/T-Spine on [**8-6**] showed stable epidural enhancement and abscesses identified in the anterior cervical region, thoracic region without epidural abscess.
CT scan on [**8-9**] demonstrated left iliopsoas abscess/phlegmen and left thigh fluid collection; both of which were too small to be drained by IR.
CBC with noted leukopenia on [**8-5**] with progression to neutropenia [**8-8**].
Plan to repeat CT abd/pelvis; MRI spine further into antibiotic treatment.
Patient's WBC count began to slowly decline on [**8-5**] with progression to neutropenia on [**8-8**].
CTA ruled out PE, however showed evidence of bilateral loculated pleural effusions and multiple lung nodules.
Cardiac enzymes negative.
Estimated EF by TEE was >55%; 2 repeat echos without evidence of valvular pathology.
Pleural effusion studies suggested parapneumonic effusion.
CT on [**8-9**] showed improvement in pleural effusions and basilar consolidations.
These medications were gradually uptitrated and at time of discharge pressures were better controlled on metoprolol 50mg TID, amlopidine 10mg QD.
Patient underwent severeal video swallowing evaluation due to concern for silent aspiration.
Repeat speech and swallow on [**8-15**] demonstrated improved oral and pharyngeal swallow with continued swallow delay, premature spillover and reduced base of tongue retraction.
Derm consulted; felt to be consistent with lipoma.
You will receive repeat imaging after completion of your antibiotic therapy for interval evaluation of infection.
While your WBC counts were low you were placed on broad spectrum antibiotics to protect you from infection.
We also found your blood pressures to be elevated at times during your hospitalization.
After completion, you were started on a thickened nectar liquid regimen and a soft, ground solid diet.
You will need repeat speech and swallow evaluation at rehab.
Two LIDOCAINE 5 %(700 mg/patch) Adhesive Patchs, Apply each Adhesive Patch daily to back  3.
-- To prevent blood clot formation while you heal and are relatively limited in your movement you will continue to receive: Heparin (Porcine)  5,000 unit/mL Solution  Injections three times a day .
You will need Outpatient Lab Work which your facility can obtain and fax to [**Hospital **] clinic .
