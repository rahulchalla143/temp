Pertinent Results: Microbiology: [**9-7**] - CMV negative [**9-1**] - blood cx negative [**8-31**] - urine cx negative [**8-31**] - blood cx negative [**8-29**] - blood cx negative [**8-28**] - foley cath pus enterococcus/pseudomonas GRAM STAIN (Final [**2101-8-28**]): 2+ PMNs, 4+ GNRs, 1+ GPC pairs.
[**8-22**] - CMV VL negative [**8-18**] - HCV VL negative [**8-18**] - HBV VL <60 [**8-16**] - duodenal tissue cx (prelim) negative for CMV [**8-16**] - cath tip cx negative [**8-15**] - CMV VL negative [**8-8**] - CMV VL negative [**8-6**] - C diff cx negative [**8-4**] - C diff cx negative [**8-4**] - stool viral cx negative  Relevant Imaging: [**2101-7-27**] RUQ US: This study is somewhat limited by patient body habitus.
Limited views of the right kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis.
[**2101-8-29**] CT abdomen: Diffuse ill-defined patchy pulmonary opacities are diffuse infection versus asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Evaluation of the bowel is limited given lack of IV contrast, but bowel wall thickening is again seen suggestive of graft versus host disease.
[**9-12**] CXR - pulmonary edema, improved from CXR on [**2101-8-30**]  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Patient is a 38yo male w/ DM, relapsed AML neutropenic, with acute respiratory failure  1.
Respiratory distress/arrest: Pt emergently intubated on the floor due to acute respiratory failure.
Pt underwent bronchoscopy and continues to be unrevealing for etiology, BAL cultures are NGTD.
The cyclosporine levels were followed closely.
