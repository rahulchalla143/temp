On further evaluation including laboratory studies patient was noted to have an elevated CEA and abdominal ultrasound performed on [**2136-7-13**] demonstrated two heterogenous masses in the right lobe of the liver measuring 7.3 x 6.3 x 5.5 cm and 6.1 x 5.8 x 4.7 cm.
Patient underwent a CT guided liver biopsy that was interpreted as adenocarcinoma consistent with colonic origin.
Patient also had a PET scan on [**2136-8-6**] that demonstrated two large foci of a hypermetabolic activity in the right lobe of the liver consistent with hepatic metastasis.
Patient underwent a CT guided biopsy of the sternum on [**2136-8-17**] which was read as no adenocarcinoma.
On [**2136-8-22**] patient underwent CT scan of the chest and abdomen.
The chest CT demonstrated one solitary pulmonary nodule in the superior segment of the right lobe at the level of the carina approximately 3 to 4 mm in diameter and it was not determined whether it was granuloma versus metastasis.
Three month follow up was suggested and the CT scan of abdomen demonstrated a lesion on the dome of the right lobe of the liver posteriorly.
On [**2136-9-11**] a repeat CT guided biopsy of the sternum was obtained and it was confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma consistent with colonic origin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation patient's vitals were blood pressure 142/70, pulse 60, respiration of 15, temperature 96.7.
Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion.
Patient's CEA was 31, AFP was 4.5, creatinine of 0.7,  TBA of 0.7.
Patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs on a drip of Neo-Synephrine and propofol as well as continuing to be intubated with CPAP with good gases and postoperative patient's hematocrit was 33.2 postoperatively with creatinine of 0.6.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12828**] were putting out serosanguineous fluid and the patient was kept sedated overnight.
The Neo-Synephrine was weaned off and patient was continued on CPAP to re-extubate in the morning and kept NPO and managing good urine output overnight night and continuing levofloxacin and Flagyl.
The chest tubes were put to water seal, continued the levofloxacin and Flagyl and urine output was continued to be monitored.
However, patient's gases remained stable and chest tube was continued on suction.
Patient was kept NPO and urine output was continued to be monitored.
Patient's hematocrit stabilized at 33 and TBA was at 1.3.
AST and ALT were down to 70 and 119.
On postoperative day number six the patient remained afebrile with stable signs and continued to have a significant edema and significant output from the chest tube and the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12828**] were draining clear ascitic fluid as well.
Patient's sodium decreased that day but remained within reasonable range.
The patient's chest tubes were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12828**] were continued for high output.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] number two was removed and the area was stitched and drains number three and one were continued.
Patient also had an ultrasound of the liver to look for portal vein thrombosis which showed that there is no thrombosis of the portal vein or superior mesenteric artery.
Patient's sodiums continued to be stable.
Patient also had a MR scan which was negative for any signs of thrombosis of the portal vein.
Patient's sodium remained stable with stable hematocrit and creatinine stable around 0.6 and continued to be diuresed.
On postoperative day number 19 patient had good urine output and remained afebrile with stable vital signs with stable sodium at 137 and on postoperative day 17 patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs making good urine.
Patient's sodiums remained stable at 135, hematocrit of 36 and creatinine of 0.6.
On postoperative day number 24 and postoperative day 2 patient had some drainage from one of the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] sites which put to drain.
Patient's VAC was continued and was switched to home VAC and patient had a stable sodium at 137 and patient was tolerating P.O.
Patient's sodium tablet was stopped and patient's sodium remained stable at 138.
