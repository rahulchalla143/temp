History of Present Illness: Mrs [**Known lastname 1391**] is a 74F who presents with a several month history of constipation, diarrhea, occasional nausea/vomiting, and a weight loss of approx 25lbs over the past 6 months.
She first sought medical attention 3 weeks before admission, when her workup, including colonoscopy and CT scan, showed a mass in the transverse colon.
Biopsy showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
A pre-operative cardiology clearance was obtained with no cardiac intervention required.
A central line was placed on [**6-1**] and total parenteral nutrition was initiated, although the pt continued to attempt self-support through oral intake.
A CT scan on [**6-5**] for pre-operative planning was not encouraging, as it showed a metastatic lesion invading the mesentery with likely involvement of the celiac and mesenteric vessels.
She underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] prep and Fleets #1 prep on [**6-5**], and was taken to the operating room on [**6-6**].
Post-operatively she was noted to be markedly bradycardic, with heart rates as low as 29 and blood pressures that proved very difficult to measure by either machine or direct auscultation.
She was thus placed in the MICU overnight at the advice of the cardiology service, who felt that in the unlikely event her HR dropped so low she was unable to support her blood pressure, it would be essential to have close monitoring.
Fluid resuscitation continued, and the patient's HR gradually normalized.
On [**6-11**] she began to complain of a suprapubic burning pain, but a urinalysis was negative for UTI, and her pain was deemed post-surgical.
