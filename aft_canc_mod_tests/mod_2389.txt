MICRO: Blood cx [**2161-11-8**]: negative at time of discharge [**11-10**]: C Diff positive by toxin (stool) .
Mediastinal fullness in the right lower paratracheal region and bilateral hilar enlargement have progressed since [**10-4**].
CT CHEST, [**2161-11-9**].
COMPARISON: Chest CTA study of [**2161-9-30**] and chest CT of [**2161-9-29**].
TECHNIQUE: Volumetric, multidetector CT of the chest was performed without intravenous or oral contrast.
A series of multiplanar reformation images were also submitted for review.
FINDINGS: Since the prior chest CT of [**2161-9-30**], a left hemothorax with loculated pneumothorax component has improved, with resolution of blood contents and air contents.
Scattered peribronchiolar opacities in superior segment right lower lobe are slightly improved compared to the prior exam, and an area of opacity in the right middle lobe on the prior exam has resolved.
Although, the airways are patent, note is made of mild narrowing and irregularity of the lingular bronchus which in retrospect was present on the prior study as well.
The degree of narrowing, however, appears improved compared to the earlier study of [**2161-9-29**].
Exam was not specifically tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region, but note is made of postoperative changes in the upper abdomen and a persistent 4.2-cm diameter fluid-density structure adjacent to the mid pole portion of the left kidney, roughly similar in appearance to prior abdominal CT scan, but incompletely imaged on this chest CT exam.
Followup CT scan in 4 weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy may be helpful to document resolution of the pneumonia and to revaluate the lingular bronchus.
If interval chest radiographs fail to demonstrate clearance of the consolidation, bronchoscopy may be considered.
CXR: [**11-12**]: Marked improvement of pulmonary infiltrates during the last two days examination interval.
The rather extensive parenchymal infiltrates were identified on chest examinations of [**2161-11-8**], [**2161-11-9**], and [**2161-11-10**] and also documented on chest CT of [**2161-11-9**].

# Thrombocytosis:  His plt count trended up this admission.
Previous admissions had documented plt levels of nearly 1.5 million.
# Serum immunoglobulins were checked, and were within normal limits.
# F/u CT: A CT scan done this admission suggested a follow-up scan in ~1 month to assess for interval change.
However, a repeat CXR done several days later showed marked resolution in the infiltrates, so it may be that this repeat scan is unnecessary.
# Psychosocial issues:  The patient has had a marked decline in nutrition and weight over the past year.
