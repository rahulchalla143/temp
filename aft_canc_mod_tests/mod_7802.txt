Admission Date:  [**2143-12-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-12-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-5-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Clindamycin / Keflex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: hemoptysis/post-obstructive pneumonia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IR embolization of bleeding pulmonary site  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 51305**] is a 61 year old male smoker with 50 pack year history, COPD, hemachromatosis, and multiple invasive squamous cell carcinoma/basal cell carcinoma who is being transferred to the ICU for post-procedural monitoring following rigid bronchoscopy for hemoptysis and likely post obstructive pneumonia.
There, he underwent a CT scan that showed a mass obstructing the left main stem bronchus with a post obstructive pneumonia on the left.
He receives dermatologic care here at [**Hospital1 18**] from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] is to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] for a Mohs procedure of a recurrent left temporal lesion.
His oxygen saturations intermittently fell to 88-89% and he coughed up a few teaspoons of frank hemoptysis.
With a CXR demonstrating major left lower lobe collapse and likely obstruction of the LMSB, decision was made to go directly to OR for rigid bronchoscopy with subsequent MICU admission for observation.
His bronchoscopy revealed a large blood clot in the left main stem bronchus with a malignancy of 10% stenosis behind it.
Upon return from the MICU, his initial vitals were:BP:150/65 P:76 R:18 O2:100% 2Lventuri mask.
He was comfortable without complaints, though was still drowsy from anesthesia and a ROS could not be ellicited  Past Medical History: -Hemochromatosis -COPD -PVD -HTN -lymphedema of LUE, RLE -IBS -anxiety -invasive squamous cell carcinoma of left temple.
-multiple squamous cell carcinomas of frontal and temporal scalp  Social History: lives at home.
Family History: Mother: CAD, DM Father Siblings [**Name (NI) **]: DM, CAD  Physical Exam: Admission exam Vitals: T: BP:150/65 P:76 R:18 O2:100% 2Lventuri mask General: patient is fatigued-appearing and weak.
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Decreased breath sounds on the left with rhonchi, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, asymmetric 2+ pitting edema with L arm >> R, and R leg >> left.
Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation, 2+ reflexes bilaterally, gait deferred, finger-to-nose intact  Discharge exam: deceased   Pertinent Results: Admission labs [**2143-12-17**] 01:32AM BLOOD WBC-23.4*# RBC-3.22* Hgb-9.9* Hct-30.0* MCV-93 MCH-30.7 MCHC-32.9 RDW-14.4 Plt Ct-439 [**2143-12-17**] 01:32AM BLOOD Neuts-97.5* Lymphs-1.6* Monos-0.8* Eos-0.1 Baso-0 [**2143-12-16**] 05:20PM BLOOD Glucose-103* UreaN-20 Creat-0.6 Na-139 K-4.1 Cl-108 HCO3-20* AnGap-15 [**2143-12-18**] 04:20AM BLOOD ALT-12 AST-11 LD(LDH)-139 AlkPhos-65 TotBili-0.1 [**2143-12-16**] 05:20PM BLOOD Calcium-7.7* Phos-3.8 Mg-1.7 .
Discharge labs: Labs stopped being drawn, as patient made [**Year/Month/Day 3225**].
CT Head [**2143-12-16**] There is no evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, shift of midline structures, or mass effect.
LENIs [**2143-12-16**] No DVT in the right lower extremity.
CXR [**2143-12-16**] Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates marked opacification of the left middle and lower lung with significant volume loss as evidenced by marked leftward cardiomediastinal shift.
As correlated to the preceding reference CT from [**Hospital 882**] Hospital of the same day, there is significant endobronchial material obstructing the left main bronchus.
Post-embolization arteriogram did not demonstrate any bronchial arteries either originating from the aorta or the internal mammary artery supplying the left lung.
CXR [**2142-12-18**] In comparison with the study of [**12-17**], there has been some re-aeration of the left lung following bronchoscopy.
# HEMOPTYSIS:  CXR and CT suggested tumor burden in the left mainstem bronchus, and this likely explained his hemoptysis.
He underwent an IR angio/embolectomy, which was successful in reducing his total amount of hemoptysis.
# COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (?POST-OBSTRUCTIVE):  His imaging showed complete collapse of the LLL with a mass compromising the left mainstem bronchus as well as likely consolidation of the inferior LUL.
OSH labs show concerning bandemia to 25%.
His sputum cultures grew out moraxella + s. pneumo.
His bandemia improved and he remained afebrile.
