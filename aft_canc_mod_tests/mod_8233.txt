With an overnight ICU stay, patient's temperature has recovered to 98F rectal.
Hypothermia: Patient presented from group home with temperature found to be 93F rectal on initial presentation.
Potential considered etiologies of patient's hypothermia included hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, hypopituitarism, hypothalamic dysfunction related to seizure, drug-induced, or inactivity.
Infectious cause was considered but WBC count was normal and patient was normotensive with normal lactate making sepsis less likely an etiology.
Endocrine work up was done and showed normal TSH and free T4.
