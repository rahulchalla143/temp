Was found to have UA with 4+ bacteria, leuk esterase positive, 40 WBC.
Was also found to have acute on chronic kidney failure with creatinine of 5.6 although without hyperkalemia.
CXR was performed which was clear.
Labs were notable for anemia (explained as chronic) with crit in the low 20s and leukocytosis of 17,000, but without any evidence of ongoing blood loss.
On the floors, patient became hypotensive with SBPs in low 80s, adn was transferred to ICU.
Neosynephrine was started as well by a house officer on the night before transfer, and BPs were stable at > 100 (baseline in 90s).
Repeat CXR after fluids did not show any volume overload.
Creatinine improved with aggressive hydration.

Echo [**2115-9-26**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = 25 %) with regional variation.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-11-13**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is slightly further reduced.
Significant left ventricular contractile dyssynchrony is present.
EKG [**2115-9-26**] Sinus tachycardia with frequent atrial and ventricular ectopy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2115-9-5**] the rate has increased.

He was given numerous IVF boluses for blood pressure support to baseline sbps in 90s, and his phenylephrine dose was eventually weaned.
[**Hospital3 **] blood cultures were negative and urine culture grew 10-50,000 mixed gram positive flora.
Urine culture at [**Hospital1 18**] grew corynebacterium sp.
CT abdomen/pelvis was also performed, which showed worsening metastatic disease as well as bladder wall stranding which could be inflammatory/infectious process.
Patient continued to spike fevers and repeat blood and urine cultures were sent.
*Blood cultures showed no growth to date with several still pending on day of discharge.
*Urine cultures originally grew Corynebacteria for which pt took Cefepime for 10 days, completing a full course.
UA was sent which revealed many bacteria many WBCs.
ID followed pt and after two days of Ceftriaxone, antibiotic was discontinued given pt's rise in creatinine to 2.0 and conern for AIN.
A renal ultrasound performed there showed stable mild hydronephrosis.
CT abdomen and pelvis showed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis.
Urine output was maintained.
Urine electrolytes showed FENA of 1.5%, indeterminate for intrinsic process.
Pt's Urine eos were positive therefore Ceftriaxone for recurrent UTIs was discontinued.
On day of discharge creatinine was 2.1 (baseline 1.2-1.3).
# Metastatic bladder cancer: CT of abdomen and pelvis showed progression of disease, including increase in size of adrenal nodules, nodules in pelvis, lytic lesions at L2 (previously seen) and T11 and L3 (new).
Serotonin release assay was negative suggestive that HIT was not etiology.
Echo during stay showed EF of 25% and ventricular dyssynchrony.
Stool studies were sent at [**Hospital1 **] as well as [**Hospital1 18**].
Stool guaiac was performed, which was initially positive (when patient's INR was 2.0); it was subsequently negative.
# Coagulopathy: Patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with INR of 2.0.
Information was obtained from PatientPharmacywebOMR.
Morphine Sulfate IR 15 mg PO Q4H:PRN pain 6.
Morphine SR (MS Contin) 60 mg PO Q8H hold for oversedation, RR<12 5.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 26015**],  You were admitted to the hospital with a low blood pressure and fatigue, which was severe enough that you needed to go the intensive care unit for close monitoring.
