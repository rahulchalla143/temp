MTX was planned to be given at 3.5 g/m^2 but was dose reduced to 2.1 g/m^2 becasue of a creatine clearance of only 59 ml/min based on a 24 hour urine.
However, as the patient's mental status improved, so did his urine control.
CSF x 2 from his Ommaya was negative for malignant cells.
There was no clear source, and he had neg blood and urine cultures throughout.
A CSF gram stain was neg, but there were a few WBCs.
XRT was continued while he was an inpatient.
Dilantin levels were checked daily, with a goal of 15-20.
His doses were adjusted accordingly, with the knowledge that the decadron he was taking would also help to prevent GVHD if his levels of cyclosporine weren't therapeutic.
