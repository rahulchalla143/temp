She was initially admitted [**8-31**] with fevers at home to 101.9 without localizing symptoms and was admitted overnight, labs drawn, negative CXR and discharged on [**9-1**] apparently without intervention.
She had a CXR on [**9-7**] which showed bilateral intersititial opacity slightly worse on the right.
She was additionally found to have elevated LFTs with Tbili 2.4, Dbili 2.2, ALT initially 188, AST 130, increasing to 245 on day of transfer.
Given the LFT abnormalities she had an abdominal ultrasound, which showed gallbladder wall thickening, distention of gallbladder and multiple 10mm mobile gallstones, trace pericholecystic fluid, but no CBD dilatation (4mm).
On exam she had a positive [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign was tachycardic and initially borderline hypotensive (unclear exact pressures), however, received fluid resuscitation with an unclear amount of fluid and blood pressures responded, by report systolics in the low 100s (105/68) upon transfer, HR 140s regular sinus tach, RR 20, 95% on RA.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS. T 97.8 HR 134 BP 85/58 RR 24 94% 2L NC  Review of systems: (+) Per HPI, as well as nausea, new nonproductive cough, slightly short of breath (-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
[**2154-12-10**]: Screening PET showed no avid lesions though some low avidity uptake at surgical margins.
A biopsy was performed which demonstrated a lymphoma.
Limited tissue, a clear diagnosis was not possible but pathology was consistent with Hodgkin lymphoma.
[**2155-4-3**]: Staging PET showed enlarged right subocciptal node, intensely avid, with avidity of the posterior paraspinal musculature.
Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated no disease.
Given rapid progression of symptoms, a second biopsy was performed on the neck lymph node and she was started on treatment with steroids and ABVD.
Pathology from lymph node demonstrated a peripheral T-cell lymphoma.

These findings are not classic for cholecystitis, however, if clinical suspicions remain high, an ultrasound and a HIDA scan is recommended to further evaluate for acute cholecystitis.
Supraclavicular, mediastinal, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which are not particularly enlarged by CT criteria, however, demonstrate FDG avidity in a recent PET-CT, dated [**2155-9-4**].
Limited study due to suboptimal acoustic windows and persistent tachycardia.
#Respiratory failure: Likely secondary to fluid overload or flash pulmonary edema which is supported by bilateral pleural effusions seen on CT and crackles on exam.
#Coagulopathy: INR 1.5.
#Elevated LFTs:  CT very suggestive of acute cholecystitis.
AST and ALT also elevated may be from adjacent gall bladder inflammation or cholangitis.
Baseline at last check ALT 47, AST 22, Tbili 0.5.
#T cell lymphoma: Status post one cycle of ABVD and 3 cycles of CHOEP with progression and C2D9 from ICE salvage.
Pending studies: Blood and urine cultures, MRSA screen 4.
