Two weeks ago, Ms. [**Known lastname 41323**] [**Last Name (Titles) 46101**] the NP who works with her cardiologist (Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8098**]) who recommended that she stop lasix given absence of peripheral edema, and she planned to take it PRN which she has not required.
She was taken for cath on [**7-10**] demonstrating an 80% ostial RCA lesion and valve area 0.5 cm2.
After this her SBP rose into the 130s with HR 70s.

Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right atrial and right ventricular filling pressures with mean RA pressure of 6 mmHg and end-diastolic RV pressure of 5 mmHg.
There was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with mean PA pressure of 26 mmHg and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance of 150 dynes-sec/cm5.
The left ventricular filling pressure was slightly elevated with mean PCW pressure of 17 mmHg.
Severe aortic stenosis was present, with a peak aortic gradient of 66 mmHg, mean gradient of 49 mmHg, and estimated aortic valve area of 0.59 cm2.
The cardiac output was normal at 4.8 L/min.
There was no evidence of a left-to-right shunt based on oxygen saturation data.
LVEF 45%.
There is minimal MR.   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 41323**] is an 84 year-old woman with aortic stenosis, recent admission to outside hospital for CHF/flash pulmonary edema with subsequent ongoing shortness of breath, now s/p catheterization on [**7-10**] demonstrating 90% ostial RCA lesion and [**Location (un) 109**] 0.5cm2.
CT abdomen done en route to the CCU did not show any signs of retroperitoneal bleeding.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and she underwent pore-operative work-up which included echo, carotid u/s, vein mapping and usual lab studies.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
Repeat echo was performed and ruled out tamponade.
