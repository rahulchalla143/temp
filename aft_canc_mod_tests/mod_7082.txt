RENAL ULTRASOUND: 1.
Also with systolic CHF first seen [**5-21**] with RV free wall hypokinesis.
His right heart pressures were monitored by swan-ganz cath with PA pressure 50 to 40s and wedge pressures of 28 to 19 after administartion of milrinone.
His discharge weight was roughly equivalent to his dry weight at 89.1 kg (196 lbs).
Upon discharge, his Creatinine returned to his baseline of 1.7. .
He was treated with Ciprofloxacin and then Levofloxacin caused him to have a supratherapeutic INR above 5.
# Cardiac amyloidosis with restrictive myopathy: The patient has history of cardiac amyloidosis confirmed on RV biopsy, and has resulting restrictive heart disease, with subsequent R sided dilation and R sided heart failure as above.
He underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed 40% plasma cells.
Abdominal fat pad biopsy both performed [**5-28**], revealed no amyloid but RV cardiac biopsy was positive for amyloid.
He was continued on coumadin for goal INR of 2.0-2.5 given for increased risk of bleeding with amyloid.
During the hospital course, he reached a supratherapeutic INR ~5 after fluoroquinolones were addded.
He will continue INR checks and Coumadin management through Dr. [**Name (NI) 109644**] office.
