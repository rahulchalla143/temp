A CEA was obtained, which is 1.2.
The patient was transferred on [**2119-9-13**] to [**Hospital1 188**] for preoperative care with plan for tumor debulking.
The patient underwent a preoperative chest x-ray, which revealed bilateral pleural effusions, which were consistent with the pleural effusions seen on her chest CT with the right greater than left pleural effusions.
SAB x1 status post D and E.  PAST GYN HISTORY:  Patient has been menopausal since age 45.
Her last mammogram was greater than five years.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on presentation: Temperature 97.6, blood pressure 100/60, heart rate of 96, respiratory rate 16, and saturating 94-95 percent on 2 liters.
Cardiovascular examination is regular, rate, and rhythm.
Pulmonary examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Sterile vaginal examination was limited secondary to body habitus.
LABORATORY EVALUATION ON PRESENTATION:  Her white blood cell count was 7.2, hematocrit was 33.5 percent, platelets were 476.
Her coagulation profile was within normal limits.
Her ALT, AST, amylase, T bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin were all within normal limits.
A preoperative chest x-ray was obtained at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2119-9-13**], which showed bilateral pleural effusions consistent with prior imaging.
Surgery was uncomplicated with a blood loss of 300 cc and approximately 4 liters of ascites drained.
Patient's pathology and cytology from the surgery are consistent with metastatic primary peritoneal carcinoma Stage IV papillary serous pathology.
She required 4 liters nasal cannula with 100 percent face mask to keep her O2 saturations approximately 94-96 percent.
Her O2 saturations declined to 88 percent on room air, improved to 94 percent on 4 liters.
Her urine output was also found to be borderline less than 30 cc/hour.
After diuresis, the repeated pH was 7.46, PO2 was 77, PCO2 is 46, calculated bicarb was 34.
Patient underwent a chest x-ray, which showed worsening bilateral pulmonary effusions.
She underwent a CTA to rule out a pulmonary embolus, for which she was ruled out.
She also had some mild chest pain for which she underwent serial cardiac enzymes, which came back negative.
EKG was obtained, which was also unchanged from baseline.
On postoperative day number four, the patient was evaluated by the Medicine consult team and a repeat chest x-ray showed worsening of her right pleural effusion.
This was sent for cultures and cytology.
On postoperative day number five, she underwent a chest x-ray post thoracentesis, which showed a very small pleural effusion.
This was then followed up by a repeat chest x-ray on postoperative day four, which showed no change in the pneumothorax.
On postoperative day number six, her chest x-ray was repeated, which showed no change in her pneumothorax, and still remains small and the patient remains clinically stable.
Per the Medicine consult team, the patient remained on oxygen supplementation 100 percent by face mask and the plan was for followup on postoperative day number seven on [**2119-9-21**] with repeat chest x-ray.
Plan per the Medicine consult team is if chest x-ray is improved, patient should be weaned off her oxygen as tolerated.
FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2406**] for a postoperative visit as scheduled and to receive chemotherapy at [**Hospital6 17032**].
