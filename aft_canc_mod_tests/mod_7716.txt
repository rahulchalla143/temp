The patient was recently discharged from the [**Hospital1 **] Neurology service on [**2112-7-14**] for a biopsy and resection of his right frontal mass.
Past Medical History: -h/o right frontal gliomatosis cerebri -h/o narcotic abuse -osteoarthritis - Hepatitis + A/B/C   Social History: -lives at [**Hospital1 **] -at baseline had been walking with a cane -long h/o tobacco use -h/o narcotic abuse  Family History: -not available  Physical Exam: Exam upon admission: Vitals:  101.1  97  105/59  97% General: scar on right frontal area Neck: supple Lungs: clear to auscultation CV: Regular rate and rhythm Abdomen:  non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present Ext: warm, no edema  Neurologic Examination upon admission: eyes closed, will open eyes to loud voice but quickly shuts them, not following commands, frequently attempts to sit-up, arms in restraints; pupils appear equally reactive, eye looking toward right and midline; mild left facial; increased tone on left; spontaneous mvt x4 but more brisk on right; withdraws to pain more vigorously on right arm and leg; dtrs, 2+ throughout, toe up on left, down on right   Pertinent Results: [**2112-8-3**] 01:02PM BLOOD WBC-11.0 RBC-4.17* Hgb-13.7* Hct-39.7* MCV-95 MCH-32.8* MCHC-34.5 RDW-14.4 Plt Ct-188 [**2112-8-3**] 01:02PM BLOOD Neuts-83.4* Lymphs-11.4* Monos-4.2 Eos-0.3 Baso-0.8 [**2112-8-3**] 01:02PM BLOOD PT-11.9 PTT-27.1 INR(PT)-1.0 [**2112-8-3**] 01:02PM BLOOD Glucose-120* UreaN-17 Creat-0.8 Na-136 K-3.8 Cl-98 HCO3-24 AnGap-18 [**2112-8-3**] 01:02PM BLOOD ALT-123* AST-105* CK(CPK)-134 AlkPhos-124* Amylase-37 TotBili-0.7 [**2112-8-3**] 01:02PM BLOOD Albumin-4.2 Calcium-9.1 Phos-4.4 Mg-2.1 [**2112-8-3**] 01:02PM BLOOD Phenyto-9.9*  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2112-8-3**]) FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Subfalcine herniation is again identified, but has increased now with approximately 11 mm of leftward shift, previously 9 mm.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2112-8-5**]) FINDINGS: The study is compared with most recent non-contrast CT examination dated [**8-4**], as well as a series of studies dating to [**2112-6-29**].
The poorly defined, infiltrative large mass centered in the deep [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter of the right frontal lobe remains relatively occult on CT examination.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2112-8-8**]): FINDINGS: Comparison with the prior study shows continued extensive right to left subfalcine herniation and accompanying compression of the right lateral ventricle.
[**2112-8-3**]: AP portable upright view.
The left lateral hemithorax is not fully included on the image.
Given the limitations of the study, further evaluation by PA and lateral views is suggested  EEG ([**2112-8-4**]): FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording the background rhythm remained slow and disorganized, typically reaching a [**7-20**] Hz maximum in most areas.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were additional bursts of generalized slowing.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
NCHCT [**8-12**]:  1.
Extensive right to left subfalcine herniation and compression of the right lateral ventricle, which was seen on the prior examination.
His repeat head CT showed some mild improvement, but he continued to have significant edema with midline shift from right sided gliomatosis cerebri.
After he passed his speech and swallow evaluation, keppra was added as a prophylactic anticonvulsant.
Exam on discharge: awake, alert, fluent, some disinhibition, mild inattention (digit span forwards [**5-18**]), no neglect, mild left hemiparesis (delt at least antigravity, provides resistence in other UMN muscle groups).
CRP 4.6, ESR 29.
2.LLL pneumonia: The patient was found to have a LLL pneumonia on CXR on admission.
No other source of infection was found and blood cultures were negative.
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) for 2 days: Please give [**Hospital1 **] today ([**2112-8-24**]), then only qday tomorrow [**2112-8-25**], then stop.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: -gliomatosis cerebri -s/p right hemicraniectomy -left lower lobe pneumonia - Hep A/B/C   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Neurologic examination notable for left facial droop, mild left hemiparesis.
Neuro-oncology: Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) 5005**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5342**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1844**], one month from discharge.
