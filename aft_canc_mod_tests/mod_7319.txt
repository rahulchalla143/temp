Head CT scan completed which revealed no evidence of metastatic disease or bleed.
CT abdomen showed ?fluid collections concerning for possible abscess.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up/management and ?IR guided drainage of abdominal fluid collection.
On the floor her vitals were: T: 100.0 HR:104 BP 105/48 (on levo) O2 100% on 3L NC.

Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
[**8-7**] CT guided IE drainage: IMPRESSION: Technically successful CT-guided drainage of fluid collection in the right psoas.
Fluid sent for gram stain and microbiology studies.
[**2135-8-7**] 5:00 pm ABSCESS GRAM STAIN (Final [**2135-8-7**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
CULTURE (Final [**2135-8-10**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH  TTE (Trans-Thoracic Echocardiogram) Done [**2135-8-9**] IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2135-8-9**]  FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**8-7**], the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion has substantially decreased.
LUNG (V/Q) SCAN Study Date of [**2135-8-9**] Low probability of pulmonary embolism.
Ventilation images demonstrate central clumping consistent with airways disease.
Perfusion images show subsegmental perfusion defects at the lung bases corresponding to areas of decreased ventilation.
Lung perfusion is otherwise normal with no unmatched perfusion defects identified.

#Sepsis: Patient initially treated empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn, initially briefly requiring Levophed; likely source was thought to be abdominal abscess seen on CT abdomen however patient underwent IR guided drainage of the cyst and cultures were negative and the fluid collection was felt to NOT represent an abscess.
However, LE dopplers were negative for DVT here and V/Q scan was low probability, so since she had received 6 months of treatment for her first episode of DVT (arguably known source - CA), she was changed to prohylactic dose of Lovenox.
You were also seen by our Oncology service and they feel that your blood counts are rising as expected after chemotherapy and the infection, including the platelet count which is rising more slowly.
You were found to not have any evidence of blood clots in your legs or your lungs so the dose of Lovenox was decreased to 30 mg per day in order to prevent further blood clots from forming.
It is a blood thinner, so it needs to be held or stopped if you develop any significant bleeding.
