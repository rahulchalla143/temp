[**2130-3-24**] Head CT w/o contrast: FINDINGS: In the high left frontal lobe, there is a focal area of vasogenic edema (Se2:Im 21-26).
[**2130-3-24**] CT abdomen/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Suboptimal evaluation of the liver due to lack of intravenous contrast, and assessment for interval change of known liver mass(es) is difficult.
[**2130-3-25**]: CT T/L SPINE W/O CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: Limited non-contrast-enhanced CT of the thoracic and lumbar spine without definite findings to explain the patient's symptoms.
[**2130-3-28**] CT SINUS/FACE: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2130-3-30**] CT CHEST: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2130-3-30**] MRI BRAIN: IMPRESSION: The study is significantly limited due to motion artifact.

CT showed a possible left frontal lobe lesion with vasogenic edema, so he was started on dexamethasone.
Brain MRI was delayed because of an old work-related injury that left shrapnel in his left cheek.
Then he had an MRI which showed a 1.6cm mass in the left frontal lobe.
Because hepatocellular carcinoma rarely metastasizes to the brain, he had a chest CT, which showed a mediastinal mass.
A home wheelchair was arranged for delivery and his girlfriend [**Name (NI) 8513**] was educated on how to assist/transfer.
# Oncology: CT and MRI consistent with new brain met, the cause of the new right lower extremity weakness.
Radiation Onclogy, Neurosurgery, and Neuro-oncology were consulted: Plan to discuss at tumor board on Monday [**2130-4-3**].
CT chest showed mediastinal tumor, a likely 2nd primary considering HCC does not typically metastasize to brain.
Bronchoscopy [**2130-3-31**] was abandoned as Mr. [**Known lastname 85113**] would not tolerate the scope despite maximum sedation.
CT T-L spine w/o contrast was negative.

Dx: Lung cancer, brain metastasis.
CT and MRI of the brain have shown a brain metastasis (spread cancer), the cause of the leg weakness.
CT of the chest showed a mass, likely lung cancer.
To confirm this diagnosis, you had a bronchoscopy [**2130-3-31**], but this test was unsuccessful because you would not cooperate despite maximum sedation.
Initially, your blood pressure was low, so your blood pressure medications were held.
However, eventually the amlodipine (Norvasc) was restarted, but your blood pressure remained elevated.
The lisinopril and HCTZ (hydrochlorothiazide) were not restarted because of the kidney failure.
