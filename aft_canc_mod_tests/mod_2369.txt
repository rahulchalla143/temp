Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CXR [**9-6**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the image is again technically limited.
Nebulizer treatments, inhaled steroids, and inhaled albuterol should be continued at rehab.
He diuresed well with 60 mg doses of IV furosemide and was eventually negative for length of stay.
Echo showed improved EF from previous reports (EF of 45%) with no obvious wall motion abnormalities.
Pt was hypervolemic on exam with rales and lower ext edema, given lasix daily (from 80mg IV to 160mg PO) with net negative output of 1L/day.
Pt's exam prior to discharge was euvolemic and lasix was put back to home dose of 30mg [**Hospital1 **].
3) Post-obstructive Pneumonia: The patient had a CT scan of his chest on [**2122-8-29**] at presentation to the outside hospital which revealed no infiltrate.
On [**9-5**], however, due to concern for a worsening appearance to his lower extremity and cellulitis his vancomycin was restarted and then cultures revealed MRSA growing on a BAL specimen from the lung as well as strep pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza.
EEG at the OSH showed no epileptiform focus but overall presentation consistent with underlying seizure disorder.
Levels inpatient were 13-17 and he was discharged on 200mg q8hr, should have levels checked at rehab.
14. phenytoin 125 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Two Hundred (200) mg PO Q8H (every 8 hours): please have your levels checked daily, goal [**9-2**].
Please have your creatinine checked at rehab to ensure it is decreasing and have your Phenytoin level checked (goal [**9-2**])  Followup Instructions: Please follow up at rehab.
