His labs were notable for a creatinine of 10.6 (baseline varies, but recently 5 - 6; last HD session on [**6-17**]) and a calcium of 15.7.
CXR was consistent with fluid overload.
[**Month/Year (2) 2793**] was consulted and recommended Calcitonin and IV steroids with plans to dialyze first thing in the morning.
Given a low-grade temperature of 100.9 and altered mental status, an LP was considered, but deferred since patient's INR was mildly elevated to 1.9 (anticoagulated because of PAF) and because FFP to reverse it would have added to his fluid burden.
CT head was unremarkable.

[**2130-6-20**] MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: There is a tiny area of restricted diffusion in the body of the right caudate with correlate on ADC map, consistent with an acute infarct.
[**2130-6-21**] CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2130-6-29**] CXR FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting upright position.
Analysis is performed in direct comparison with a preceding similar study of [**2130-6-28**].
Findings of this single plain AP chest examination does not include a new parenchymal infiltrate or pleural effusion that reaches the lateral pleural sinuses.
Recommended that daily calcium levels be checked after discharge and that consideration be given to re-dosing bisphosphonate if Ca >13 mg/dL.
Heme/Onc was consulted for evaluation of multiple myeloma as etiology for hypercalcemia, and for definitive management of myeloma.
No clear source was identified, as chest x-ray, abdominal CT, and urine and blood cultures were negative.
While non-contrast head MR [**6-20**] (for which the patient was electively intubated and sedated) revealed a tiny lacunar infarct in the body of the right caudate, the consulting neurology team felt that this was most likely not acute and would not likely explain the current clinical picture.
Mental status cleared by [**6-30**] am, and calcium and phosphorus levels had improved.
Pt was AOx3 on day of discharge.
He was placed on 2L O2 with sats up to mid-90s.
ABG showed a metabolic alkalosis with likely concommitant AG acidosis and non-gap acidosis.
CXR did not show signs of new pneumonia or fluid overload.
On [**6-30**], hypoxia had resolved, with pt satting in mid-90s on RA at rest and 88% on RA  with ambulation.
#Retained foley fragment - The patient removed his foley catheter with the balloon inflated and abdominal CT [**6-21**] revealed a 3.3 cm segment of retained catheter within the bladder without evidence of bladder wall injury.
On [**6-30**] Warfarin dose was decreased to 4mg PO daily with am INR 2.6. .
[**Month/Day (1) 2793**] may consider removing additional fluid PRN.
#Anemia (macrocytic) [**2-27**] B12 deficiency- Hematocrit remained stable and transfusion was not required.
