Neurological consultation and follow up MR study is recommended.
MRI [**3-18**] IMPRESSION New increased t2 and flair signal noted within posterior pariteal lobes superior to ventricles and within deep left frontal [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] as noted on CT, with  slight increased signal on DWI, likely due to t2 shine through.
Overall exam  limited by motion, but clival mass and sinus thickening is without sign.
CXR [**3-19**] AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Compared to prior radiograph from [**2160-2-19**], there is no significant change.
The second two abnormalites suggest a moderate encephalopathy, which may be seen with toxic metabolic abnormalities, medication effect or infections .
An EEG showed encephalopathy, but no seizure activity.
An LP was done and shoed 14-28 WBC (90% lymphs) w/ nl glucose and protein.
CSF was negative on gram stain and also for crypto ag.
MR imaging of the brain was consistent with reversible posterior leukocencephelopathy of the brain which can be associated with seizures.
The patient's BP was controlled with metoprolol and nifedipine.
Urine grew yeast, for which the patient was treated with one dose of fluconazole.
CSF cultures were negative to the time of discharge.
CXR was clear.
# dropping ANC and wbc ct: Prior to discharge it was noticed that the patient's ANC was slowly dropping.
# Tachycardia: The patient has a baseline heart rate in the 90s in the last few months.
EKG was normal.
# CLL s/p allo transplant 90 days: the cyclosporin levels were monitored on a daily basis and the patient was also maintained on her outpatient dose of prednisone.
The patient had a speech and swallow evaluation and a nutrition consult.
Her lytes were repleted as needed, particularly magnesium, which can be low with neoral.
