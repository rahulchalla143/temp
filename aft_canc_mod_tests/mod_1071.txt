EMG done in [**2164-4-29**] done at [**Hospital1 69**] showed electrophysiologic evidence of single-fiber examination for a generalized disorder of neuromuscular transmission, but there were also features of a mild myopathic process of denervating features and mild-to-moderate sensory motor polyneuropathy, predominately axonal in nature.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.4, pulse 64, blood pressure 116/67, 18 respirations per minute 93% on room air.
Vital capacity of two liters, negative NIS, negative 44.
GENERAL: The patient was a pleasant, interactive, well-developed, well-nourished man in no acute distress.
CARDIAC:  Examination revealed normal S1 and S2, regular rate with some ectopic beats, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, but with diminished breath sounds at the bases.
Registration intact, 2 out of 3 at 5 minutes.
Cranial nerves examination revealed pupils 3 mm, equal, round, and reactive, 2 mm with disk margins not able to be visualized.
Face is symmetrical and intact to light touch and pinprick.
MOTOR: Examination revealed the following:  Neck flexors are [**5-3**], and neck extensors [**6-2**].
Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ of the biceps and triceps, 1+ at the right brachioradialis, 2+ at the left brachioradialis tendon.
Deep tendon reflexes cannot be elicited of the right lower extremity.
Sensory examination revealed diminished light touch, pinprick and temperature and stocking distribution left to the knee and right to the mid shin.
Gait testing was deferred as the patient complained of dyspnea on exertion throughout the examination.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission labs revealed the following: Bicarbonate 32, BUN 22, glucose 106, CBC normal, 71% neutrophils, 28% lymphs, urinalysis normal, coagulations normal.
Chest x-ray revealed possible right effusion and a questionable nodule at the left base.
Cardiac perfusion scan of [**2165-5-29**] revealed the following: Chest CT results currently are all not available.
PFTs from [**2165-5-29**], results are consistent with moderate restrictive lung disease in which there was no improvement with bronchodilators.
Lung volumes, however, are normal and gastric change was not impaired.
He had a swallowing study performed on the 20th, which revealed aspiration of barium.
The patient was on telemetry and several episodes of bradycardia and PVCs were noted.
Pulse and blood pressure were 70s/40s.
ABG showed a pH of 7.26, pO2 of 70, and pCO2 of 166.
The cardiac issues appeared to be improving, as he was no longer having brachycardiac episodes, but he remained with persistent tachycardia on Lopressor 50 mg PO q.i.d.
Vital capacities were being checked q. six hours to monitor the respiratory status.
However, the tachycardia was still difficult to control by increasing Diltiazem doses up to 120 mg q.i.d.
Bleeding was treated by the GI Department.
For the continuing arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation the patient was started on Digoxin.
During the stay, the patient had a pacer placement, DDI programmed to a rate of 80.
All of the cardiac medications, other than the Amiodarone, were discontinued after the pacer.
He had a respiratory rate of 40.
He had a 20% bandemia and chest x-ray that showed bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis mainly in the right middle lobe with pulmonary edema.
Urine culture was returned showing infection.
After urine cultures were returned, he was stopped on the Vancomycin and continued on the Levofloxacin and Flagyl to continue with a two-week course.
On [**9-2**], modified barium swallow was performed, which showed that the patient was capable of swallowing honey-thickened liquids.
The hematocrit continued to fall back on anticoagulation again.
CT of the abdomen was done, which revealed no active acute bleeding.
He received two units of packed red cells and the hematocrit responded with increase to 33.
On [**9-3**], colonoscopy was performed to look into the source of the GI bleeding and frond-like villous nonbleeding greater than 5 cm mass was found at the hepatic flexure.
Biopsy was performed for histology.
Sleep study was performed and the results pending at this point.
A Tensilon test was performed and the patient weakened on it.
On the 11th, a second Tensilon test was performed and the patient continued to weaken.
Pulmonary function tests were performed, which showed FVC of 1.86, 38% of predicated, FEV1 of 1.26, 42% of predicted, MMF of 0.71, 30% predicted and a FEV1:FVC ratio of 68, which is 108% of predicted.
