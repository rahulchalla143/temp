CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  The heart is enlarged.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The inferior vena cava is enlarged, consistent with the patient's right heart failure.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder, uterus and rectum are unremarkable.
Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology in this case (grade 1).
Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2114-4-14**]    PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION: Indication: Pericardial effusion.
Height: (in) 60 Weight (lb): 130 BSA (m2): 1.56 m2 BP (mm Hg): 116/67 HR (bpm): 95 Status: Inpatient Date/Time: [**2114-4-14**] at 18:28 Test: Portable TTE (Complete) Doppler: Color doppler only Contrast: None Tape Number: 2005W193-0:47 Test Location: West CCU Technical Quality: Adequate     REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]   DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  This study was compared to the prior study of [**2114-4-13**].
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2114-4-13**], pericardial effusion is now similar or smaller/minimal (was very small pveriously).

Gross: The specimen is received in formalin labeled "[**Known lastname 99606**], [**Known firstname **] - proximal ascending colon polyp" and consists of a 0.3 cm fragment of tissue; submitted into cassette coded A.  Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2114-4-12**] Conclusions: The right atrium is markedly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2114-4-9**], the size of the pericardial effusion is increased.
Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2114-4-14**] The right atrium is markedly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2114-4-13**], pericardial effusion is now similar or smaller/minimal (was very small pveriously).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2114-4-14**], the pericardial effusion has increased.
Her zyprexa was continued at 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] and her donepizil was incrased to 10 mg daily from 5 mg daily.
2) Pericardial Effusion: The patient was found to have a reaccumulated pericardial effusion as compared with echocardiogram 1 week previously.
Serial echocardiograms demonstrated that it was increasing in size.
To workup the potential etiology of the effusion, she had a CT torso with contrast to evaluate for malignancy which showed large pericardial effusion but no malignancy.
EGD and [**Last Name (STitle) 2792**] were remarkable for AVMs, hemorrhoids and colonic adenoma, resected.
A mammogram could not be done as an inpatient but can be considered as an outpatient.
Sjogren's antibodies were sent prior to discharge given patient's report of dry eyes and question of enlarged parotids on exam.
Her hematocrit did drop during admission and she required transfusion.
5) Right heart failure: The patient has a very large RA/RV by echocardiogram, likely from her tricuspid valve regurgitation.
She was continued on aspirin which has modest stroke prevention benefit and also metoprolol was titrated up for rate control as tolerated by blood pressure.
7) Quesions of paraesophageal hernia by EGD - This was a concerning finding on EGD, but as demonstrated by upper GI series, was just normal stomach below the diaphragm.
Her sodium level normalized with fluid restriction and lasix.
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed.
If you have these symptoms, call your doctor or go to the ED:  - worsening shortness of breath - hypotension - visual change - dizziness - chest pain/palpitations - fevers/chills  Followup Instructions: Please see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 5909**] after discharge to review your echocardiogram.
