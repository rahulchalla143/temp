CT Chest: New diffuse bilateral ground glass opacification with associated reticulation, highly concerning for an acute infectious process, but the absence of nodules is atypical for varicella pneumonia.

Acid Fast Culture: Pending Amplified MTB direct test: Negative, Culture pending  Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 41-year-old man with Hodgkin's Disease status-post autologous HSCT [**2-11**] now with recurrent disseminated Varicella Zoster infection.
He was started on 850mg IV q8h of acyclovir (10mg/kg) given his presentation, however, his creatinine increased to 2.0.
His creatinine steadily improved with hydration and decreased dose of acyclovir.
Hypoxia/Pneumonia:  While his CXR on admission was unchanged from one a few months ago, he had a recent productive cough, and an [**11-16**] PET scan showed new, mild FDG uptake associated with new air-space disease in the left lung base; this was associated with a mostly ground-glass appearance with a more solid component on an accompanying chest CT.
Routine BCx, UCx and CXR were done.
CXR showed new RUL infiltrate.
On [**12-11**] AM, got CT chest which showed new diffuse bilateral ground glass opacification with associated reticulation.
ABG showed pH 7.46 pCO2 33 pO2 59 HCO3 24 with an O2 sat of 89%.
He was transferred to the MICU, where bronchoscopy was performed as well as broncheoalveolar lavage.
In the MICU, his oxygen saturations were maintained at a goal 80-85% with as much as a 50% high flow face mask.
Over the course of his second MICU stay, his oxygenation worsened and then subsequently improved with the addition of 40 mg of prednisone a day, with improvement of his chest X-ray.
Broncheoalveolar lavage and induced sputum results were essentially negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3019**], but a concentrated smear for AFB was positive on [**12-11**], and he was placed in a negative pressure room (but the AFB was not treated).
HCV Ab negative [**12-10**], HBsAb, HBsAg, and HBcAb negative [**12-10**].
