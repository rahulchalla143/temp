She was assessed by a nurse practitioner, and laboratory examination revealed a hematocrit of 20.
Rectal examination in the Emergency Department was notable for guaiac-positive stools.
When the hematocrit result was returned, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department for a transfusion.
The vital signs were notable for tachycardia.
An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with ST changes consistent with an inferoposterior myocardial infarction.
A Cardiology consultation was obtained.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 98.7, blood pressure was 125/44, transiently 75/59 (responded with fluids), heart rate was 66 to 96, respiratory rate was 20, and oxygen saturation was 100% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Pulmonary examination revealed clear to auscultation bilaterally/anteriorly.
The patient did not express nonverbal signs of pain with palpation of the abdomen.
Extremity examination revealed right foot with postoperative scar, marked inversion of at the right ankle.
Neurologic examination was limited by the patient's dementia.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratory results revealed white blood cell count was 15.6, hematocrit was 20.4, mean cell volume was 81, and 3+ hyperchromasia.
Differential revealed 87 segs, 8 lymphocytes, 4 monocytes, 0.1 eosinophils, and 0.2 basophils.
Creatine kinase was 407.
MB was 37.
Troponin was 0.38.
Sodium was 146, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 111, bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was 16, creatinine was 0.8, and blood glucose was 314.
INR was 1.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram #1 revealed sinus tachycardia at 112 beats per minute, diffuse ST segment depressions in the precordial leads with ST segment elevations in lead III of 1.5 mm, diffuse T wave inversions, with normal axis, and a Q wave in lead III.
Electrocardiogram #2 revealed a normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, normal axis and intervals, resolution of ST changes and T wave inversions (this was after a transfusion with one unit of packed red blood cells).
Chest x-ray revealed no infiltrates, effusions, or opacities.
A Cardiology consultation was obtained (as above).
It was the opinion of the Cardiology consultation that the patient's ischemia was related to demand induced by tachycardia induced by hypotension induced by blood loss.
They recommended continuing Lopressor for blood pressure and heart rate control as tolerated and continuing aspirin when the gastrointestinal bleeding resolved and hematocrit was stable.
They recommended no colonoscopy, serial hematocrit checks, and transfusions to keep the hematocrit above 30%, and iron sulfate.
The patient was placed on telemetry, and her creatine kinases were cycled.
ANEMIA ISSUES:  In total, the patient was transfused with 3 units of packed red blood cells bringing her hematocrit to 35.9.
She was monitored on telemetry until [**2183-8-2**] without significant events.
Her creatine kinases trended down from 1636 to 528.
The MB trended down from 241 to 28.
On [**2183-8-2**] the patient was still minimally verbal, and she was able to maintain her blood pressure despite being on captopril and metoprolol.
