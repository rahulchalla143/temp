His BP improved with fluid boluses but was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further observation.
EKG demonstrated RBBB, inferior STT changes.
CAD s/p MI w Vfib arrest/syncope and CABGx3 [**3-10**], no warning symptoms, syncopized; EF [**10-12**] 45-50% on dobutamine stress echo, followed by outside cardiologist.
Cath in [**2198**] with 40% stenosis of SVG -> RCA, otherwise patent grafts 2.
Gout 5. cataract surgery '[**97**], '[**99**] 6. cholecystectomy '[**89**] 7.
TURP [**4-13**] 8.
Physical Exam: VS: T 96.5, BP 122/60, HR 85, RR 18, O2 95% on 2L NC Gen: Pleasant talkative elderly male in NAD HEENT: NCAT.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 8 cm.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP .
Vein graft angiography revealed a patent SVG to the RCA.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 21 mmHg and a PAD pressure of 26 mm Hg.
The cardiac index was depressed at 1.86 l/min/m2.
There was a moderate systemic arterila hypertension with an SBP of 150 mmHg.
Successful PCI/stent to proximal left subclavian thrombosis with a 7.0x39mm Genesis stent deployed at 18atms and postdilated with a 9.0mm balloon.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Renal u/s [**2200-6-16**].
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic  dysfunction.
There are mobile filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with possible Lambl's excresences (normal variant) although an aortic valve vegetation/mass cannot be definitively excluded.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-6-12**], the left ventricular function has slightly improved.
A small filamentous mobile lesion on the aortic valve is present (seen on prior study but not mentioned) which is consistent with probable Lambl's excrescence.
EKG showed new TWI in V2-V5.
Repeat ECHO prior to discharge showed no sign of ventricular thrombus despite wall motion abnormalities, and given risk of rebleeding from bladder, anticoagulation was held on discharge.
Anemia: Hct has trended down during admission in the setting of urethral clotting from mid 30s to high 20s from a baseline of 35-40.
On [**6-14**], a CT of the abdomen and pelvis ruled out a retroperitoneal bleed.
However, CT showed the site of bleeding to be in the bladder - on [**6-14**] 500cc of clot was irrigated by urology.
A bladder ultrasound later showed residual tumor in the bladder but no further blood clots.
