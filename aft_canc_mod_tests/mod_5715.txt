Pt stated she was telling the nurse about her chest and back pain throughout the night.
Upon rounding in the morning (around 6 am) the patient appeared pale and complained about [**9-21**] sharp nonradiating pain in a band like distribution across her chest and in her back made worse with breathing.
Her O2 sats were in the low 90's.
I obtained a 12 lead ECG which was normal, cardiac enzymes were cycled, ABG was drawn and showed PO2 of 68 on 3 L O2, she was placed on non rebreather at 15 l/min and on telemetry, portable xray was called.
I took the patient to CT for a CT with PE protocol and CT abd with oral contrast was performed.
IMAGING: CXR [**8-14**]: Bibasilar atelectasis.
[**8-18**] Unable to draw any labs or place any new intravenous catheters, several people have tried.
[**8-19**] Pt is in more discomfort, white count keeps climbing, will do CT scan and place PICC line to draw cultures from.
Obtain blood cx, U/A + Cx, and stool for c.diff.
Please obtain differential with next CBC  [**8-20**] Pt to go to IR for power PICC placement and left pleural effusion drainage, CT from [**8-19**] showed large left pleural effusion but the CT could not be read as the computer system was not working.
She was given 1.5 mg IV dilaudid and 30 mg IV toridol, her CXR shows a much worsened pleural effusion.
Pt started on heparin drip and PTT was followed every 6 hours.
[**2116-8-25**] Patients heparin drip was changed to an enoxaparin drip.
[**2116-8-27**]  Pt is having dyspnea, went for CXR which showed a moderate to large left pleural effusion which is unchanged from before.
She should stay therapeutic with an INR of [**3-17**], stay on coumadin for 3 months.
There is an acute change in the pigtail from pus to blood overnight.
Removed pigtail catheter due to minimal drainage over the past few days and correlation with CT scan a few days ago.
Enoxaparin 150 mg/mL Syringe Sig: One (1)  Subcutaneous Q12H (every 12 hours): until bridged with coumadin to INR of [**3-17**].
Coumadin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day for 3 months: Dose will be adjusted by PCP to meet INR of [**3-17**] requirement.
