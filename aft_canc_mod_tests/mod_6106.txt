male with PMHx of DM, HTN, CAD s/p IMI with 3 stents to RCA and recently diagnosed RCC who is transferred from [**Hospital **]for ongoing work-up of acute renal failure and change in mental status.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital on [**2165-4-16**] for chest and abdominal pain.
He ruled out for an MI with cardiac biomarkers and was felt to be constipated as was illustrated on CT and thought to be due to chronic narcotic use for lower back pain and right hip pain (awaiting hip replacement).
Blood cultures later grew GPCs in [**2-23**] bottles and chronic foot ulcers were swabbed and reportedly grew staph aureus with pending sensitivities.
Neurology was consulted and recommended a head CT which was unremarkable, leaving them to conclude that the mental status was toxic/metabolic in the setting of infection and narcotic use.
On day 5, patient was noted to develop acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3, up from 1.3 and was also anuric.
CKs were checked to evaluate renal failure from rhabdomyolysis and were not likely contributing at a level of 361.
Additionally, he had a CT scan with contrast at [**Hospital1 2025**] 3 days prior to his admission to [**Hospital3 **]as a part of his RCC work-up and the wife expressed concern for contrast-induced nephropathy.
Patient was then ordered for a stat head CT given the mental status and neurology was consulted for further assistance with management.

Lung volumes are low and there are several areas of plate-like atelectasis.
If there is continued concern based on the clinical presentation, CTA and CTV, if serum creatinine level is appropriate or a followup MR venogram can be considered.
[**2165-4-30**] CT SPINE: IMPRESSION: Limited study due to patient habitus and motion, and non- myelographic technique, with: 1.
If this remains of clinical concern, follow-up CT study, dedicated CT- myelography or MRI, when feasible, might be helpful for further evaluation.
The patient successfully underwent MRI of the brain (at this institution) as recently as [**2165-4-25**].
Indeterminate foci in the right proximal thigh medially or scrotum and the soft-tissues of the left knee medially, for which clinical correlation is needed.
An LP was initially deferred because of the unlikelihood of him developing meningitis during his hospitalization at [**Location (un) **], as he did not initially present with symptoms suggestive of this condition.
ACV and CTX were then discontinued as CSF culture returned negative and other cultures continued to be MSSA.
An MRI/MRV was negative for structural abnormality on [**2165-4-25**], after EEG showed possible alpha-coma waves.
Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended CT myelogram or MRI to better define this lesion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (radiology) stated CT myelogram was not indicated and suggested MRI.
# Acute Renal Failure: His creatinine began rising prior to transfer from a baseline of 1.3, and he developed oliguric renal failure.
Renal was consulted and their analysis of his urine was consistent with ATN secondary to sepsis, though there was no clear documentation of hypotension from the OSH.
At that point his creatinine was 9.8.
His urine output improved, although his need for HD continued.
The patient continued receiving HD 3 times weekly on the floor, and pt's creatinine was 2.2 at time of discharge.
Per family, he was recently diagnosed ~2 cm mass, CT torso without mets.

You also had an ileus thought to be precipitated by high doses of narcotics; this has now resolved.
