Ct revealed a mass at the level of the third ventricle with resultatn hydrocephalus.
Her CSF was sent for cytology and was negative for malignant cells.
MRI and MRV were done on [**2142-5-30**] and showed: 1) 1.8 x 2.3 cm enhancing mass with probable central necrotic component and a mild amount of surrounding edema with evidence of restricted diffusion located in the region of the posterior midbrain.
A CT of the Torso was done on [**2142-5-31**] and the results: 1.
Post op head CT showed no evidence of bleeding.
Post op head CT showed:1.
