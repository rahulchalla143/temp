He also underwent a CT pelvis with IV contrast which showed scattered diverticula within the descending and the sigmoid colon with no evidence of inflammatory changes.
The study was also broad-based soft tissue mass, which appeared to involve the wall of the low left posterior rectum.
The transrectal ultrasound showed a T1 to T2 lesion at the level of the seminal vesicles.
After his chemoradiation treatment was completed, the lesion was much smaller.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed an, otherwise, healthy 68-year-old gentleman, who appeared healthy.
LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Examination revealed no masses, tenderness, hernias, or ascites.
Rectal exam confirmed almost complete regression of the rectal tumor.
On postoperative day #3, he was found to have a posterior anastomotic leak which required him to be taken back to the operating room on [**2104-9-1**] and underwent a diverting ileostomy.
However, the patient, later that night, spiked a temperature to 101.2 and the Kefzol was changed to IV Ancef.
A swab of the ileostomy showed gram-negative rods.
A VQ scan was obtained, but came back as per report, indeterminate for pulmonary embolus, since the patient was not able to cooperate with the ventilatory part of the test.
Nevertheless, the VQ scan showed several perfusion defects and with the onset of the patient having a rise in creatinine and team being unable to obtain a CT angiogram, he was started on IV Heparin empirically.
His sputum grew Pseudomonas and he was covered with Ciprofloxacin.
He underwent an abdominal CT on [**9-19**], showing a fluid collection in the left lower quadrant pain and in the presacral area.
Abdominal CT was repeated on [**9-24**] and the fluid collection was found to be partially drained, so the IR drain was advanced.
The CT also showed the gallbladder, which was dilated on imaging, also with increased LFTs, question of a calculus cholecystitis versus dilatation secondary to illness proposed.
He had an echocardiogram to look for endocarditis, since he continued to spike temperatures, but the study was essentially normal, except for a moderate effusion, which on repeat echocardiogram, several days later was resolved.
After repeat CT scan showed resolution of the left lower quadrant abscess, the drain was discontinued.
The tracheostomy, which was done on [**9-26**], is stable.
From the cardiovascular standpoint, the patient is stable with a most recent echocardiogram done on [**10-2**], which showed no effusions.
The Infectious Disease recommended followup CT scan to assess the size of this collection on [**2104-10-27**].
The most recent CT scan showed a stable scan.
From the renal standpoint, creatinine was stable with good urine output.
Nutrition-wise, the patient underwent a video swallow study on [**2104-10-8**] and he failed this study, secondary to weakness.
The patient also has a CT scan scheduled for [**2104-10-27**] at 4 p.m. at the [**Hospital Unit Name 1825**].
