Problems: # Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer: Given his weight loss, a CT of the abdomen was obtained.
The patient was scheduled to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (oncology) for evaluation of candidacy for chemotherapy.
He underwent EGD and multiple upper GI sources sources were identified: gastritis, antral erosions, duodenitis, and metastatic pancreatic cancer encircling gastroduodenal artery.
He required several transfusions to keep his HCT >30.
Since he never had a febrile episode, blood culture, urinalysis and urine culture were noted to be unremarkable he was not started on any antibiotics.
His CXR did not show any evidence of pneumonia.
The pt had compalined about loose stools a month prior to presentation but his stool for C.difficile and stool cx were noted to be neagtive.
On CT abdomen, the patient's prostate was noted to be 10cm x 9cm in diameter and abutting the bladder.
Due to concern for adrenal insufficiency, a cortisol stimulation test was performed and was found to be within normal limits.
## Acute on chronic renal failure Pt had an elevation of creatinine from his baseline of 1.3-1.7 to a peak of 3.1.
The Cr eventually improved to 1.3 with blood transfusions and IVF.
During his hospitalization he was also noted to have positive urine eosinophils which likely indicate a drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis (secondary to aspirin or related family of drugs).
He responded appropriately to treatment and his blood glucose remained controlled on insulin sliding scale.
His admission hypoglycemia was likely due to poor po intake on glyburide in setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
Due to concern for hypoglycemia in the setting of abnormal EGD (stenosis of second part of the duodenum) and possible gastrinoma, a gastrin level was obtained that turned out to be within normal limits.
