The patient had a recent bone scan due to an elevated PSA and since then has been complaining of increased fatigue.
He was given IV Lasix when his chest x-ray showed flash pulmonary edema.
The patient was aggressively volume resuscitated prior to transfer with three liters as his systolic blood pressures were not being maintained.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs show temperature of 102.9, pulse 83, blood pressure 119/39, breaths 19, satting 98% on room air.
Sepsis:  On admission the patient's blood cultures were positive for gram-negative rods in [**2-22**] bottles which later grew out to be E. coli which where pansensitive.
The patient's urine culture also grew E. coli.
The patient was treated with Levo and Ceftriaxone initially on [**1-10**] after his cultures and sensitivities as being sensitive to quinolones.
On admission the patient had been complaining of chest pain and his troponins showed him to have an acute non Q wave MI though his CKs were not elevated.
His cardiac ischemia was thought to be secondary to demand.
While he denied further chest pain, the patient was continued on the Heparin drip.
The patient had a subsequent echocardiogram which demonstrated a depressed EF of 25% to 30% with severe left ventricular dysfunction and a marked anterior akinesis.
This will be stopped as the patient is going to rehab and we are recommending that his blood sugars are checked while fasting to prevent hypoglycemia.
