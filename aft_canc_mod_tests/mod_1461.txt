PROGRESS NOTE ON TRANSFER FROM MICU TO [**Hospital1 **]: 68 yo M with h/o MDS, thrombocythemia, HTN, COPD (fev1 62% pred, fvc 56% 11/06) who presented with BRBPR on [**3-22**].
Hct 25, INR 2.4, was given 10 mg vitamin K and admitted to the MICU.
An EGD was unremarkable and and a colonscopy was significant for blood in the colon, sigomid diverticulosis, but no clear source of the bleeding.
A SMA angiogram was significant for extravasation of contrast at the distal ileocolic branches, which was successfully embolized.
He received a total of 10 U pRBC and 10 U FFP while in the MICU.
Given his h/o thrombocythemia with clots and the fact that his anti-coagulation was held in the setting of GI bleed, LENIs were performed that showed a chronic appearing L superficial vein DVT.
A HIDA scan did not exclude the possibility of cholecystitis.
He was started on cipro, flagyl, and unasyn and then underwent an ERCP in which a stone was removed from the biliary tree, a sphincterotomy was performed, and the CBD was noted to be dilated to 12 mm.
DVT RLE ([**2105**]) hospitalized  2.
Aortic Regurg ([**7-/2101**]) ECHO TTE: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60-65%).
Anemia/ Manocytosis (myelodysplastic syndrome): [**2-/2100**] Bone Marrow Biopsy: Cellularity is 60% overall which is hypercellular for the patient's age.
[**2-16**] Path report: peripheral blood for immunophenotyping flow cytometry phenotyping: impression: clonal lymphocytosis.
[**2100**]: The patient was noted on admission to have a hematocrit of 41 with an MCV of 119.
His folate, B12 and TSH levels all were normal.
His iron studies revealed an iron of 113, total iron binding capacity of 135, ferritin of greater than 1000 and a TRF of 104.

IMAGING: CXR [**3-22**] - The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but stable in size.
Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.
PA and lateral chest radiograph with improved inspiratory volumes may be helpful for more complete assessment of these regions.
EGD [**3-22**]: Normal EGD to duodenum.
Colonscopy [**3-23**]: Blood in the whole colon.
SMA Angiogram [**3-23**]: SMA angiogram demonstrates extravasation of contrast from the distal ileocolic branches.
It is unlikely to represent acute cholecystitis; however, if there is clinical concern for this, a HIDA scan could be performed.
CXR [**3-27**] - Compared with [**2108-3-27**], there is now right perihilar haziness, with a more symmetric appearance of the pulmonary edema.
HIDA [**3-29**] - Findings suggest hepatocellular dysfunction.
CT abd/pelvis c contrast [**3-29**] - 1.
Patchy opacities at bilateral lung bases, which may represent atelectasis versus early pneumonia.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a sphincterotome 2.
A single stone was seen at the biliary tree.
CT abd/pelvis without contrast [**4-2**] - 1.
Compared to the ultrasound from [**2108-3-26**], this would be a new finding.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
CXR [**4-11**]: Right-sided PICC line is again noted and although is difficult to evaluate the exact location of the tip, it is likely unchanged.
LABS ON DISCHARGE: WBC 12.9 HGB 7.3 HCT 22.1 PLT 299 NA 133 K 4.2 HCO3 27 BUN 39 CR 1.4 PT 25.1 INR 2.5 ALT 20 AST 22 Total Bili 0.9   Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo M with h/o MDS, thrombocythemia, HTN, COPD who initially presented with BRBPR.
#) BRBPR: The patient had an egd and colonoscopy which failed to find the source of bleeding.
The patient underwent an SMA angiogram which showed bleeding at the distal ileocolic branches, which underwent successful embolization.
The patient's hematocrit was then followed throughout his stay and was stable at 21-23 on discharge.
His hematocrits are also unresponsive to blood transfusions presumably due to difficult crossmatching.
The patient continued to have intermittent guiac positive stool, but his hematocrit remained stable.
He was discharged with plan to observe for any evidence of acute bleeding or decrease from his baseline hct of 22. .
An EGD was performed with ERCP.
His LFTs were monitored thereafter and decreased to normal.
The patient should be scheduled for cholecystectomy with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) 468**], MD in the next month ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 476**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2835**]).
During this hospitalization, on a CT of his abdomen to look for ?
On discharge he was therapeutic (goal INR 2.0-3.0) on coumadin.
His baseline creatinine level is 1.0. .
He required transfusions to upkeep his Hct while in house.
The patient's iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
The patient's last iron level checked on [**4-10**] was normal at 139.
THE PATIENT IS A DIFFICULT CROSS MATCH FOR BLOOD BANK DUE TO KNOWN ANTIBODIES.
He has been afebrile and his most recent urine culture was negative for infection.
His WBC count started to trend downward on discharge.
His hydroxyurea was continued to treat this disorder.
