[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT) Study Date of [**2140-5-2**] 2:49 PM  FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral lower extremity veins.
CAROTID ULTRASOUND ON [**2140-5-13**] [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed of the right and left ECA, ICA, CCA, and vertebral arteries.
Grayscale imaging demonstrates mild plaque within the right and left ICAs.
LEFT: Proximal ICA 91/17 cm/sec, mid ICA 67/23 cm/sec, distal ICA 81/15 cm/sec, CCA 106/20 cm/sec, ECA 121 cm/sec, vertebral artery 43 cm/sec.
RENAL ULTRASOUND ON [**2140-5-14**]  CLINICAL INDICATION: Elevated creatinine.
This study was done portably at the bedside demonstrating the right kidney to measure 10.4 cm in length and the left kidney 10.1 cm.
These measurements are unchanged from a prior scan of [**4-5**].
The bladder is not well evaluated due to limited amount of urine within, but there is evidence of ascites in the pelvis and right flank.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ON [**2140-5-27**] The left and right atria are markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Apical hypertrophy is not appreciated, but there is an apically displaced papillary muscle and the apex is now well delineated.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-3-28**], the severity of tricuspid regurgitation is somewhat incresaed.
CXR from last week clinic visit showed small pulmonary effusions.
Unfortunately, the patient was unable to sustain blood pressures high enough for CVVH, and so was maintained on a levophed drip much of the time to assist with CVVH.
A thorough workup of potential causes of hypotension was undertaken, but no obvious reversible cause could be determined.
During diuresis, creatinine improved to 2.2, then peaked at 2.8 despite still being very fluid overloaded, likely still due to poor forward flow.
Creatinine improved to around 1.5 with CVVH.
Urine sediment was notable for granular/hyaline casts and renal US w/o evidence of obstruction.
Patient's urine output was reduced, and as above, CVVH was started after consulting with renal.
Sepsis: Patient spiked a fever [**5-12**] to 102; [**2-28**] blood cultures demonstrated MSSA.
Hyponatremia - Hypervolemic hyponatremia fluctuated in the setting of diuresis with a nadir of 125.
For that reason, the coumadin was d/c'ed and was not restarted for the remainder of his hospitalization.
Leukocytosis - The pt developed a leukocytosis of uncertain etiology.
In the setting of bleed after procedure, and in the setting of longstanding anemia, the patient was transfused with pRBCs to maintain a Hct of ~29%.
Venous duplex ultrasound was done to look for reflux, showing no evidence of proximal DVT in lower extremities, though nonocclusive tibial vein thrombosis could not be ruled out.
