Angiography revealed a 30% stenosis proximal to the LAD stents and partially in the first stent, LCx with no significant disease, OM1 stent widely patent, small OM2 with a 80% stenosis, RCA with a 90% lesion in the proximal portion, mid RCA 80%.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal and mid RCA completed at this time.He underwent a cardiac cath on [**2105-9-3**] which revealed a patent left main stent and LAD stents, 70% diagonal lesion, LCX ostial 90% stenosis in jailed segment, RCA with proximal in-sent restenosis 70-80%.
Echo on this day showed moderate aortic stenosis.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The left ventricular EF is about 40%.
The peak gradient was 30 mm Hg, with a mean of 14 mm Hg at a cardiac output of 3.8.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged since prior study and right internal jugular line remains unchanged in position.
POD#1 he was transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
1 tablet(s) by mouth once a day -  (Dose adjustment - no new Rx) LEVOTHYROXINE - levothyroxine 50 mcg tablet.
