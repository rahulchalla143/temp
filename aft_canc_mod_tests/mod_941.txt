# Portal Vein Thrombosis (main, left, right):  Given the patient's history of a lung mass on CT at an outside hospital, malignancy was initially of great concern although hypercoaguable diseases, pancreatitis, and cirrhosis were also considered.
The patient was started on a heparin drip on HD 2 after an endoscopy confirmed no active bleeding.
A hypercoaguability panel was deferred to a later date as the patient was already started on heparin.
A hepatitis panel and PSA were negative or within normal limits.
An HCV viral load was pending at the time of death.
A CEA was elevated concerning for malignancy.
Afternoon labs on HD3 revealed elevated potassium and worsening creatinine.
An EKG demonstrated no change, no evidence of high k+.
On HD 3, afternoon labs revealed worsening renal function.
The patient developed agitation in the afternoon which was thought to be secondary to receiving ativan and morphine for a CT scan as the onset coincided.
An EKG revealed no evidence of acute MI or elevated k+.
The patient was evaluated, vital signs were normal, (RR, HR and BP within normal limits) and stable and the patient was afebrile and continued to refuse medical care.
In the evening it was decided to draw blood cultures, change his foley, send a urine culture and check his electrolytes.
Repeat labs and an ABG revealed marked lactic acidosis with a pH of 7.1.
# Malignancy: A CT from [**Location (un) 745**] [**Location (un) 3678**] showed potential 15mm lesion in R lobe of liver; 10mm lesion in L lobe of liver.
The patient presented with a normal AFP (1.4) but high levels of CEA (228), concerning for colon CA, cholangio CA, pancreatic CA, gastric CA, lung CA, medullary thyroid.
A CT chest abdomen and pelvis was performed without contrast (the patient has renal failure) on HD 3 to evaluate interval change of prior masses and evaluation of possible new masses.
Preliminary read of the CT showed masses in the liver, lungs and mediastinum.
Palliative care and the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Diabetes doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] to discuss the patient's stated wish to not pursue invasive treatment measures.
A TTE revealed no evidence of transpulmonary shunting or PFO or ASD.
The patient was started on ceftriaxone and an albumin challenge for HD 1 and 3. .
Blood sugars were covered Humulin 15U HS and insulin sliding scale.
Endoscopy revealed no variceal bleeding and octreotide was discontined and ppi was changed to PO.
