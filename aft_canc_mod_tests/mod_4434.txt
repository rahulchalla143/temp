Imaging: [**8-25**] CT Chest without contrast: 1.
Atelectasis of the right lower and middle lobe.
[**8-25**] Tracheal mass tissue pathology: Immunohistochemical studies show that tumor cells are positively stained by TTF-1 and CK7; they are negative for CK20, chromogranin, and synaptophysin.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
If clinically indicated, a follow-up study is suggested.
[**8-27**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with and without contrast: 1.
Narrowing of SVC and left brachiocephalic vein by large mediastinal mass.
[**2172-8-27**] ECHO: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-8-26**], the size of the pericardial effusion is unchanged with no signs of tamponade.
[**8-28**] CT Head: 1.
[**2172-9-2**] CT Head (performed due to worsened mental status): 1.
Unchanged examination from recent exam of [**2172-8-28**].
[**2172-9-4**] CT Chest w/o contrast (to evaluate tumor s/p XRT and chemo for future XRT sessions): 1.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2172-8-29**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2172-9-1**]):    NO GROWTH.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2172-8-27**]): no AFB seen on direct smear    ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary): PENDING Cytology: Atypical cells, non-specific findings .
[**2172-9-4**] BAL: GRAM STAIN (Final [**2172-9-4**]):       1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
[**2172-9-3**] CSF: GRAM STAIN (Final [**2172-9-3**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary): NO GROWTH.
C. diff negative .
[**8-30**] Blood Cx ??????
NGTD [**9-5**] Blooc cx - pending .
Bronchoscopy [**2172-9-4**]: lots of necrotic tissue noted, ETT tube dislodged between stent and tracheal wall, repositioned during bronch.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course [**Date range (3) 84902**] 58F with likely small cell carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome, airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pericardial effusion, resolved pleural effusion and pneumothorax, and electrolytes disturbances admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she underwent XRT x2 and then chemotherapy for 3 days.
During hypoxic episodes, pt underwent bronchoscopy twice, both times of which demonstrated the ETT lodged between tracheal wall and stent.
Pt's saturation improved with repositioning.
CT head [**2172-9-2**] negative for acute process.
CT head/[**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis negative for metastases.
Initially, XRT was clinical emergency - normal and pathologic tissue was likely treated; necrotic tissue noted on bronchoscopy [**2172-9-4**].
Urine casts consistent with ATN.
Uric acid and electrolytes elevated 4-5d post chemotherapy concerning for tumor lysis syndrome.
Pt with tachycardia to 140s and episodes of hypotension to SBP low 80s.
DDx includes possible enlarging pericardial effusion/tamponade but pulsus paradoxus was normal and ECHO [**2172-9-5**] was unchanged from prior.
PE likely given malignancy and prolonged bed rest but unable to do CTA given renal failure and VQ scan not helpful in setting of lung changes.
Improved edema on exam compared to admission.
LDH effusion/serum 0.68 (exudate by Light?????
Cultures of fluid all preliminary negative.
EKG without signs of electrical alternans but does have low voltages.
Repeat ECHO done [**2172-9-5**] in setting of hypotension demonstrated no change in pericardial effusion.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
