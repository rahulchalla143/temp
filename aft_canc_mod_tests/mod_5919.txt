During his admission an initial electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation that autoconverted to sinus rhythm.
Electrophysiology was consulted and performed an echocardiogram which showed normal ejection fraction with evidence of diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary hypertension with severe left ventricular hypertrophy and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient did have an increase in troponin levels but Cardiology felt this was secondary to cardiac contusion as opposed to acute coronary syndrome.
An arterial blood gas at this time showed a pH of 7.28, a pCO2 of 81 and a paO2 of 245.
The patient was put on noninvasive ventilation with a resulting blood gas of 7.30, 68 and 146.
Chest x-ray at this time showed increased bilateral effusions.
A left thoracentesis was therefore performed with a white blood cell count of 278, red blood cell count of 8,667, protein of 2.7, LDH 160, consistent with a transudative process.
The patient continued to remain on noninvasive ventilation with a pressure support of 14 and a PEEP of 5 with gases in the range of pH of 7.33, pCO2 of 57 to 62 and paO2 of 144 to 157.
He continued to have oxygen saturations from 90 to 100%.
When the patient was switched to 50% oxygen face mask, his oxygen saturations decreased to 80%.
Myeloproliferative disorder with white blood cell count of 12,000, hematocrit 36, platelet counts of 800, followed at [**Hospital3 328**] Cancer Institute.
Severe obstructive sleep apnea with sleep study performed at [**Hospital 4415**] advising nocturnal CPAP.
Patient has refused coronary artery bypass graft but was scheduled for cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital6 1708**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO INTENSIVE CARE UNIT: Temperature 97 degrees, heart rate 64, blood pressure 133/45, respiratory rate 21, oxygen saturation 100%.
The patient was on noninvasive ventilation with a pressure support of 15, a PEEP of 5, 50% FiO2.
He was bringing in tidal volumes of 350 cc with a respiratory rate of 25 and a minute ventilation of 8.6.
His arterial blood gas was 7.34, 64 and 96.
On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, the pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The skin showed no rash  LABORATORY ON ADMISSION TO UNIT:  White blood cell count 14.2, hematocrit 28.7, platelet count 639.
Sodium 146, potassium 4.1, chloride 107, bicarb 34, BUN 51, creatinine 1.6 and glucose of 112.
His ionized calcium was 1.12, magnesium 2.1, phosphorus 4.6, lactic acid 0.7.
Pleural fluid chemistries from [**5-28**] were white blood cells [**Pager number **], red blood cells 8,667 with 32% polymorphonuclear lymphocytes.
Total protein 2.7, glucose 139, LDH 160.
Urinalysis: Specific gravity 1.017, large amount of blood, negative nitrite, 100 protein, pH 5.0, negative leukocyte esterase, greater than 50 red blood cells, [**1-31**] white blood cells, no bacteria.
RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray from [**5-30**] showed decreased effusions, continued congestive heart failure with perihilar opacification and CT of the chest from [**5-23**] showed a large left pleural effusion with a small right pleural effusion, cardiac enlargement, left lower lobe atelectasis, increased opacity in the left upper lobe suspicious for contusion.
CT of the abdomen showed an enlarged spleen with a small perisplenic fluid collection and large gallstones in the gallbladder.
The patient was diuresed with Lasix and Natrecor to a total of negative five liters which seemed to improve his congestive heart failure by chest x-ray and by physical examination and seemed to improve his hypoxic respiratory failure.
The patient's pH ranged from 7.4 to 7.32 and his pCO2 ranged from 55 to 82 though there did not seem to be much of a correlation between whether he was on noninvasive ventilation and whether he was on face mask.
Therefore, the patient was started on continuous positive airway pressure ventilation overnight with a pressure of 8 starting on [**6-10**].
In addition, the patient was maintained on oxygen by nasal cannula in order to maintain his sat no less than 88% and no greater than 93% in order to maintain his drive to breathe.
In addition, the patient underwent bilateral thoracentesis which yielded 1400 cc of serosanguinous fluid from either side.
The chemistries from the left revealed a pH of 7.42, a LDH of 193 and a total protein of 2.14.
The chemistries from the right revealed an LDH of 197 and a total protein of 2.3.
The patient had an ejection fraction of 60% with severe diastolic dysfunction which was treated with Lasix as needed and now that the patient is uvolemic is being treated with metoprolol for rate control.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient has three vessel coronary artery disease and an appointment for cardiac catheterization after discharge.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  The patient's nutrition status was addressed several times during this hospitalization.
All subsequent blood cultures and urine cultures were negative.
The patient was treated with levofloxacin empirically for possible pneumonia which was discontinued on [**6-8**] as a repeat chest x-ray showed no signs of infectious infiltrate.
Hematology:  The patient had mild proliferative disorder and his complete blood count was followed throughout this hospital stay.
