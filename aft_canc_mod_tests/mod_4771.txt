She has been persistently tachypneic with RR 20-30 and hypoxic and had O2 sat of 94% on 4L.
Her tachyopnea improved and but her hypoxia remained stable, satting 96% on 6L.
Overnight her respiratory status slowly worsened, satting 93% on 100% facemask, and this morning she was found to be somnolent, with respiratory rate in the 30's and hypotensive with blood pressure 89/49.
ABG drawn on 100% facemask was 7.44/37/44, with O2 sat 93%.
She was placed on NRB with marginal increase in O2 sat to 97%.
She was also bolused 500cc of IVF with increase in blood pressure to 105/70, HR 80.
ABG on NRB was 7.46/33/109.
Per report, her neurology exam has beeen unchanged and non-focal.

****Please see the online medical record for additional results which were not copied into this summary given large number of studies performed and lack of need to transfer care in the setting of death****   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 64 year old female with history of MDS presenting with acute leukemia, hospitalized for nearly 2 months for treatment and complications of disease, ultimately resulting in death.
Admitted with WBC of 183.
Day 14 bone marrow showed residual blasts, so pt proceeded to HDAC re-induction therapy.
Pt tolerated HDAC well, was still neutropenic (ANC = 0) by day 25, thus another BM bx was performed on [**4-18**] which showed a hypoplastic marrow.
Severe myelosuppression remained and patient required multiple transfusions with pRBCs and platelets to maintain Hct > 25 and plt > 10. .
First CSF has 1 atypical cell suspicous for blast, but subsequent ones were clear.
Extensive evaluation including bronchoscopy with BAL on [**5-4**] was unrevealing.
Repeat CXR showed increase of right middle and lower lung opacities, from increased pulmonary edema and worsening consolidation.
A diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis was performed with removal of 800cc fluid, temporarily ameliorating respiratory distress, however pt continued to be tachypnic, hypoxic and short of breath when not on high flow oxygen.
MRI shows acute ischemia in the left MCA as well as the ACA territory to a lesser extent.
Her goal platelets was > 50 to prevent conversion into a hemorrhagic stroke.
Her goal SBP is between 140?????
AVNRT: With onset of high fevers and septic-like phsyiology on [**5-1**], patient began to have episodes of SVT with heart rate as high as 150-170s.
Over following hospital course, metoprolol and diltiazem were started and titrated to maintain a target heart rate of 80s-90s without causing hypotension.
CT scan w/o contrast showed no abnormalities.
Abdominal U/S showed benign hepatic cysts, pleural effusions.
