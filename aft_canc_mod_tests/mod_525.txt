The patient had a chest x-ray done at his oncologist's office, which showed a small apical pneumothorax, new pulmonary nodules, and an enlarged cardiac silhouette.
Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed a moderate-to-large circumferential pericardial effusion with impaired ventricular filling.
The patient has since had multiple courses of chemotherapy including the following:  Cisplatin and etoposide x1 regimen; carboplatin and Taxol x1 regimen; low dose carboplatin and Taxol with concurrent radiation therapy.
Vital signs:  Temperature 98.8, heart rate 100, blood pressure 111/65, respiratory rate 27, pulse oximetry 97% on 5 liters.
Lungs: Dull breath sounds at the right base, clear to auscultation on the left side with good breath sounds.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 11.2, 84% neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, and 0 bands.
Electrolytes:  Sodium 134, potassium 4.8, chloride 93, bicarbonate 28, BUN 14, creatinine 0.7, glucose 97.
Pericardial fluid:  White blood cell count [**Pager number **], red blood cell count [**Pager number **].
Differential of the white blood cell count 15 polys, 2 lymphocytes, 1 monocyte, 8 macrophages, and 2 other cells.
Total protein 5.6, glucose 113, LDH 279, albumin 3.0.
PT 12.8, INR 1.1, PTT 28.8.
Cardiac index was estimated at 2.2 liters per minute per meters squared.
pericardiocentesis was performed and 540 cc of clear fluid was removed and sent for evaluation.
This was confirmed by serial echocardiography which did eventually show resolution of the effusion on [**5-19**].
Therefore, arrangements were made for a liquid O2 tank with a nonrebreather mask for administration of [**9-6**] liters prn be available at his home.
Patient's last echocardiography on [**5-19**] showed resolution of the pericardial effusion.
Comfort measures including pain control and nausea control were continued throughout his hospital stay in addition to administration of a nonrebreather mask of 100% O2 for improved controlled of respiratory distress.
Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  The patient had a very poor nutritional status, however, he did tolerate high protein shakes prepared by his family.
Gastrointestinal:  Patient was continued on a bowel regimen of laxatives and stool softeners to relieve the constipation caused by his large narcotic doses.
The patient was advised to keep his appointment for a CT scan at the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Center Radiology Department on [**2113-6-5**].
