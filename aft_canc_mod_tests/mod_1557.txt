Workup there included EGD which showed "narrowing, causing him to throw up" and a colonoscopy which showed "irritation, 80%-sure irritation and not cancer" per his son.
[**Name (NI) **] his son, both EGD and colonoscopy showed a source of bleeding, but the patient did not require any transfusions.
He was brought to the ED>  In the ED, VS: T 97.9 HR 80 BP 121/52 RR 20 O2 95% RA.
EKG showed diffuse T wave flattening and CXR was negative.
1st set of cardiac enzymes showed Troponin 0.10, which was decreased compared to prior Troponin levels and consistent with decreased clearance [**12-28**] to his poor renal function.
To evaluate for UGI bleed, NG lavage was performed which was negative for bleed.
U/A was obtained given his foul-smelling urine, which was positive for UTI.

CXR [**5-3**] CHEST, THREE VIEWS: There has been interval placement of an OG tube with tip and side hole projecting below the diaphragm.
Head CT [**5-3**] FINDINGS: The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with age- appropriate atrophy.
KUB [**5-5**] ABDOMEN, TWO VIEWS: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with stool and gas seen in the large bowel.
[**5-5**] BARIUM UPPER GI STUDY  The study was limited due to patient factors and aspiration.
CT abd/pelvis [**5-8**] IMPRESSIONS:  1.
Diagnostic considerations include severe gastroparesis or partial gastric outlet obstruction.
[**5-14**] CXR Right internal jugular vascular catheter is unchanged in position, but new right internal jugular dialysis catheter has been placed, with tip terminating in expected location of proximal right atrium.
High-density material is present adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm, likely due to aspirated barium, as reported on earlier radiograph of [**2144-5-7**].
He had an EGD on HD#2 which revealed a medium hiatal hernia, tortuous esophagus, erythema with single polyp/protrusion at the gastroesophageal junction, [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, edematous antral folds, edematous duodenal mucosa, and a polyp in the stomach body.
On HD#[**2-29**], pt began to have significant emesis and had an upper GI series, which demonstrated contrast in the stomach for >24hrs, consistent with prolonged gastric transit secondary to severe gastroparesis vs. obstruction.
Abdominal CT revealed contrast in the colon, ruling out complete obstruction, but differentiating between gastroparesis and partial gastric outlet obstruction was not possible with that exam.
An NGT was placed, but pt self-d/c'd on HD#9.
Given lack of improvement, concern for process other than gastroparesis was considered and repeat EGD to further evaluate previously seen gastric/duodenal pathology.
NGT was placed and again d/c'd by pt.
EGD was postponed secondary to medical instability.
He had an endoscopy and colonoscopy at that hospital which showed prepyloric antritis consistent with gastroparesis, esphagitis with mucosal ulceration, moderate-severe ischemic colitis, sigmoid diverticulitis, and internal hemorrhoids.
He was then transferred back to the floor on HD#7, where he remained in rate controlled sinus rhythm until HD#14, when he had an episode of a fib with RVR which was responsive to 10mg IV metoprolol.
He had a doppler study which revealed DVTs in the basilic and brachial veins.
Repeat EKG with no change.
Three sets of cardiac enzymes were stable, not indicative of ACS.
With the addition of intravenous nutrition, his blood glucose increased and dosages of insulin were appropriately adjusted.
Blood glucose was frequently elevated likely secondary to variable absorption of intake.
Head CT was normal.
U/A showed [**10-15**] WBC, nitrite negative, rare bacteria.
Pt was started on ceftriaxone, but urine cx negative so abx d/c'd.
Amiodarone, metoprolol, and atorvastatin were continued.
