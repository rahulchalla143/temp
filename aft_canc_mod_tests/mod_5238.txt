Decreased tree-in-[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 239**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 75026**] in the lungs bilaterally, most likely due to an improving diffuse small airways infection.
Tumor dissemination could have this appearance; however the diffuse and relatively homogeneous distribution suggests infection rather than malignancy.
No CT findings of radiation pneumonitis.
Slightly enlarged 17mm hepatic hypodensity incompletely assessed on this exam or the prior CT and further assessment should be obtained with MRI to assess for metastasis.
Barium Swallow ([**2101-7-18**]) Delayed passage of thick barium and a barium tablet in the midesophagus.
CXR ([**2101-7-23**]): Worsening airspace consolidation at the right lung base which could reflect worsening pneumonia, although the pulmonary vasculature looks more ill-defined and therefore superimposed edema should also be considered.

Subsequent CXRs showed a RLL pneumonia which was treated with vancomycin, aztreonam (due to PCN allergy) and levofloxacin.
Her hct was 21% and she was given 2 units PRBC with no events on [**7-16**].
She occasionally becomes tachypneic, w/out detriment of her oxygen saturations, and this resolves w/ 0.5-2mg ativan.
There were no acute changes in her CXR and a CT chest was also done that showed no evidence of radiation pneumonitis.
Patient had an EKG during one of her triggers that initially looked like afib.
The EKG was later read as frequent atrial ectopy.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: The patient presented with a creat of 1.3, which was likely elevated in the settting of hypovolemia and decreased PO intake.
Once her creatinine was normalized the patient was restarted on her home lisinopril.
