On [**1-16**] he underwent colonoscopy and on [**2-5**] he underwent EGD; colonoscopy was significant for several small polyps, EGD was unremarkable.
He then underwent a barium swallon on [**2171-3-7**], which showed a large gastric ulcer.
On [**2171-3-25**] he underwent a repeat EGD which also showed the 1 cm deep ulcer in the cardia, with surrounding edema and active oozing of blood.
Given the active bleeding despite three weeks of PPI therapy he was referred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER for further evaluation and consideration for surgical resection.

After transfer to the floor, vital signs were monitored closely per unit routine.
Upon transfer to the floor 02 saturations were checked with vital signs per unit routine.
