Work-up with an MRI demonstrated soft tissue mass near the left vaginal apex.
On [**2189-4-24**], the patient had transvaginal ultrasound needle aspiration which was positive for carcinoma.
On [**2189-6-29**], radiation implants were inserted and an omentopexy was performed.
EXAM:  The patient was afebrile at 98, blood pressure 122/80, respiratory rate 18, pulse 84.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her CT scan from [**2189-8-18**] revealed soft tissue stranding, but no evidence of recurrence.
On hospital day #3, the patient underwent an MRI which demonstrated left side tissue mass, unchanged from CT scan of [**2189-7-29**].
Repeat MRI again demonstrated no evidence of disease along the nerves.
An EKG was obtained that showed sinus tachycardia.
Review of the medications showed that the patient had received her PO regimen which included neurontin, methadone and Klonopin, as well as two doses of 50 mg of demerol overnight.
In the PACU, the patient was sating 99%, she was still somewhat tachycardic in the 120s-130s and her blood pressure was 140/80.
Her respiratory rate ranged from 8-12 breaths per minute.
Her exam otherwise was unremarkable.
Labs were sent which showed that her electrolytes were all within normal limits.
Her prior creatinine on [**9-9**] was 1.1.
Additionally, an arterial blood gas was obtained that demonstrated a pH of 7.3, PCO2 43, PO2 158, bicarb 24.
Her vital signs were now within normal limits.
Repeat creatinine was 1.1 and the rest of the laboratory studies were normal.
On [**9-16**], the patient underwent a transvaginal ultrasound-guided biopsy in the area of the previous biopsy.
This biopsy was negative for malignancy.
Additionally, she is scheduled for an EMG study on [**10-12**] at 10:30 am.
The patient's creatinine was 1.0.
