Admission Date:  [**2173-2-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-2-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-7-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Doxil  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 76 yo female w/hx of ovarian CA dx in [**2150**] s/p TAH BSO, debulkining last in [**7-21**] resulting in colostomy and 9 rounds of chemo on gemcitibine prior to admission, HTN, CHF (EF now 35% but nl EF and clean c's in [**7-21**] cath), anxiety, PUD, ureteral obstruction s/p stents last on left in [**11-21**] who was admitted to the MICU after severe pulmonary edema after blood transfusion in Heme/[**Hospital **] clinic.
Pt was on regimen of gemcitibine for ovarian CA after poor tolerance for doxorubacin and routine labs in clinic revealed Hct 24 so she was she was transfused 2 units PRBC's.
TTE revealed apical and septal HK with an EF of 35% with most recent TTE   Social History: Lives on her own.
Family History: Sister has breast cancer  Physical Exam: T 100.7 HR 94 BP 99/76 AC 550 x 14 PEEP 15 100% o2 GEN: sedated, intubated HEENT: PERRL, EOMI CV: RRR S1S2 no murmurs Chest: left port LUNG: clear anteriorly, crackles r base ABD:soft, nt, ostomy in place, slightly distended, midline scar, bs+ EXT: no edema   Pertinent Results: ekg: nsr 99 bpm, nl axis, left bundle branc block, no st/t changes, no change from previous * cxr #1 b/l patchy infiltrates cxr #2 improved pulmonary edema, ett tube in place * Abdominal MRI [**2-15**]: 1) Extensive tumor mass within the lower pelvis, growing superiorly, resulting in bilateral distal ureteral obstruction.
* ECHO [**2-12**]: EF 35%, mild symmetric LVH, mild global HK and severe HK of septum and apex c/w CAD.
* cath [**7-21**]: nl coronaries, diastolic dysfunction * renal u/s: IMPRESSION: Bilateral nephroureteral stents.
In comparison to the CT dated [**2172-12-24**], the most recent comparison examination available, the degree of bilateral pelvocaliectasis is probably stable to perhaps slightly decreased.
CXR at the time showed patchy bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.
In the ICU, the patient was successfully diuresed and repeat CXR was greatly improved and she was successfully extubated on HOD#2.
The patient had a slight troponin elevation to 0.10 but ruled out for acute coronary syndrome by CK and MB fraction.
Echocardiogram revealed an EF of 35% with global and focal hypokinesis suggesting an acute coronary event may have occurred sometime in the interim between her normal cath in [**2170**] and this hospitalization.
The patient will follow-up with cardiology in [**1-21**] weeks to repeat echo and determine outpatient plan.
The patient was found to be in acute renal failure in the ICU with creatinine to 4.6 (BUN 76).
U/S was inconclusive and a follow-up abdominal MRI revealed bilateral distal ureteral obstruction on HOD #4.
A left femoral vein DVT was found on MRI on HOD #4.
Please have your blood counts and potassium level checked at this time.
You will need to have a repeat echocardiogram in [**1-21**] weeks.
