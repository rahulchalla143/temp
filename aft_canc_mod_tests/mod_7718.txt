The patient was febrile and sputum studies were planned.
On [**2120-6-9**] the patient presented to the ED with fever of 102F, heart rate of 110 and blood pressure of 84/38 with a respiratory rate of 30 and O2 saturation 93% on room air.
The patient was also given 6 liters of normal saline with increased in blood pressure to 94/58.
Because of enlarged heart on chest x-ray an echocardiogram was ordered.
CT scan of the chest and abdomen were ordered for better evaluation of the lungs and new onset abdominal pain.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs blood pressure 94/58, heart rate 94, O2 saturation 98% on room air, respiratory rate approximately 24.
LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count 3.4, hematocrit 25.1, ANC 3,050, platelet count 220,000.
PT 15, PTT 25.5, INR 1.5.
Chem 7 remarkable for a BUN of 33 and creatinine of 1.1.
Calcium 6.9, magnesium 2.5, phosphate 2.9, free calcium 1.01.
ALT 439, AST 447, albumin 3.1, haptoglobin 410, alkaline phosphatase 80, T bilirubin 0.6, LDH 964.
CK #1 38, Troponin 2.3.
CK #2 102, Troponin 0.9.
CK #3 104, Troponin 0.8.
However CT scan of the chest did not reveal any cavitary lesions and the patient did not worsen.
A chest x-ray revealed a left retrocardiac density which could be either consolidation versus atelectasis.
The patient had several blood cultures sent, urine cultures, crypto antigen, micro plasma antigen, CMV antigen, histo antigen and EBV titer sent.
Cardiac - Because of the enlarged cardiac silhouette seen on chest x-ray and hypotension, an echocardiogram was done to evaluate for ejection fraction.
The echocardiogram revealed surprisingly global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25% and 2+ MR.
The patient did have a slight Troponin leak with Troponin max of 2.3.
The patient's blood pressure continued to rise and was at baseline levels of 120 upon discharge.
Pulmonary - Upon admission to the OMED service there was concern for pulmonary embolus however a CTA was done which did not reveal any pulmonary embolus.
Gastrointestinal - The patient had acute transaminitis with liver enzymes that rose to an ALT of 722 and AST 348.
With improvement of the patient's cardiac function these liver enzymes seemed to decrease.
Stool studies were sent which have been negative thus far.
The patient was anemic with a hematocrit of 25 and had two units of blood transfused.
The patient's hematocrit continued to rise during his hospitalization and the patient symptomatically felt better after the transfusions.
