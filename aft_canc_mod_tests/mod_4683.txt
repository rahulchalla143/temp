[**2199-9-6**]: Right Femoral US: Pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral artery.
[**2199-9-2**]: CT Abdomen/Pelvis: 1.
Increased anasarca, pulmonary edema, and size of abdominal ascites, suggestive of volume overload.
[**2199-8-31**]: ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
[**2199-8-30**]: CT Head and Neck: 1.
Possible perfusion defects concerning for infarct within the brainstem; however, CT perfusion is suboptimal for the evaluation of the posterior circulation.
MRI could be performed for further evaluation.
He had a repeat ultrasound on [**2199-9-6**] which showed the pseudoaneurysm had slightly increased in size from 1.7 to 1.9 mm in the sagittal plane only.
CXR on [**2199-9-3**] had shown stable reticular nodular pattern in right lung likely representing lymphatic obstruction, a stable right pleural effusion, and increased opacification in left lung likely representing increased atelectasis and increased pleural effusion.
Repeat CXR on [**2199-9-8**] showed increased pleural effusion and patient had a repeat thoracentesis on [**2199-9-11**] prior to discharge.
A post-procedure chest x-ray was done and there were no complications from the procedure.
His left stent showed hematuria and had poor output in setting of creatinine increase from 1.3->1.7, his left nephrostomy tube was placed.
On discharge, his creatinine was 2.0.
Stage IV gastric CA: Patient recently diagnosed with gastric cancer, and gastric biopsy returned positive for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma infiltrating through the deep mucosal layer.
His cell counts were monitored closely in setting of recent chemo.
Patient will need long-term anticoagulation in setting of recent embolic stroke and hypercoagulable state.
Hypertension: BP was well-controlled after transfer to medical oncology service.
The patient was continued on metoprolol for both rate control and BP control.
Alum-Mag Hydroxide-Simeth 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for indigestion.
