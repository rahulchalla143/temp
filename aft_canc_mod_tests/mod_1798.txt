The patient was started on dobutamine for her hypotension at [**Hospital3 **], and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management.
Blood cultures were collected prior to first dose of antibiotics.
Patient was also hypotensive and started on a norepinephrine drip to titrate to a mean arterial pressure of greater than 60.
The patient's Vancomycin was also discontinued on [**8-14**] after [**5-1**] blood culture bottles grew out gram-negative rods.
Upon admission to the MICU, the patient was also found to have an AST of 14,023 and a LD of 14,025, a total bilirubin of 2.6, and alkaline phosphatase of 185.
The patient underwent an ultrasound of the liver and gallbladder, which showed no evidence of extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation or other obvious cause for the increased liver enzymes.
CT scan of the abdomen was also performed, which showed slight decrease in ascites, no evidence of abscess, stable left hepatic pneumobilia, unchanged pelvic and right inguinal lymph nodes, unchanged nodular lymph node inferior to the right kidney and a slightly increased soft tissue nodule in the anterior abdominal wall.
While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient also underwent a CT scan of the head to rule out abscess or hemorrhage.
The CT scan showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Of note, the patient also was found to have a platelet count of 30 on admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

TSH 1.2 within normal limits.
ULTRASOUND OF THE ABDOMEN:  On [**8-14**]:  Stable examination when compared to prior CT and ultrasound from [**Month (only) **] and [**Month (only) 205**] of this year with no evidence of extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and unchanged appearance of limited amount of intraabdominal ascites, pneumobilia, and an unchanged appearance of the biliary collecting system within the left lobe of the liver.
LABORATORY DATA UPON TRANSFER TO THE OMED FLOOR:  White blood cell count 11.8, hematocrit 32.0, platelets 23.
PT 12.6, PTT 25.2, INR 1.0.
Sodium 139, potassium 3.0, chloride 104, bicarb 27, BUN 7, creatinine 0.6.
ALT 335, AST 25, alkaline phosphatase 178, total bilirubin 1.3, calcium 8.1, phosphorus 2.8, magnesium 1.6.
Patient's liver enzymes continued to trend down on the OMED floor and at discharge as well.
Hypotension:  Patient was off of pressors after one day in MICU and her blood pressure remained stable upon trip to the Medicine floor until discharge.
