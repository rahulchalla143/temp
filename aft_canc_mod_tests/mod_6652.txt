Admission Date:  [**2173-1-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-4-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2112-10-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: WBC of 185K  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bone marrow biopsy Endotracheal Intubation PICC line placement and removal PEG tube placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 60yo F w/ a PMH of hypothyroidism, hypertension, fibromyalgia and hyperlipidemia who presented to an OSH today for evaluation of a month of night sweats, worsening back pain, frequent and easy bruising, and fatigue.
She had been to her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 1 week ago for evaluation of these symptoms and had her thyroid checked (which was normal per her report).
She continued to feel poorly so presented to [**Hospital6 8972**] today for evaluation and her CBC revealed a WBC of 185K, with 90% peripheral blasts.
Her platelets were also found to be ~35K and her fibrinogen was undetectable.
She was reportedly given cryoprecipitate and antibiotics (but there is no documentation of this) and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
On arrival here, her VS were T 100.0, BP 148/80, HR 100, RR 20, sats of 98% on RA.
Initial labs showed a WBC of 185k with a predominance of blasts and some promyelocytes.
Her transaminases were elevated, her uric acid was 7.8, LDH 897, INR 1.4, K 3.2, Cr 1.0 and fibrinogen 197.
She remained afebrile in ER (T 99.3-100.0), BP 111-137/61-83, HR 70s.
A CVL was placed and she received 1u plts post CVL placement.
She was then transferred to 7F for further management.
Physical Exam: Vitals - T: 98.6 BP: 126/72 HR: 78 RR: 16 02 sat: 96% on RA wt 135.1 lbs GENERAL: WDWN middle aged female in NAD.
Pertinent Results: CXR PA/LAT [**2173-1-30**]   No evidence of pneumonia/edema.
CVR PA/LAT [**2173-1-31**] Cardiac size is top normal.
Ill-defined bibasilar reticular opacities are new and of uncertain etiology, for which, if clinically indicated, further evaluation with CT for further characterization could be performed.
CXR Port [**2173-2-1**] Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged with cardiac size top normal.
[**2-3**] CXR Portable- Worsening moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
[**2-3**] CXR portable- Worsening moderately severe pulmonary edema with increasing confluent areas of opacification in the right upper and left mid lung zones representing asymmetric edema or evolving infectious process.
On [**2-2**] she desat'd again in the setting of SBP 170 and was put on a NRB.
Blood gas showed hypoxemia.
She was diuresed aggressively due to concern for volume overload, but this was hindered by her continued need for blood products.
Her Cr has been stable at 1.8 and she has been hydrated with IVFs w/bicarb.
On [**2-11**], oral swab showed evidence of HSV-like cytopathic effect and acyclovir was changed to IV.
Imaging was consistent with ARDS of unknown etiology & bronch showed some bloody clots in large airways thought due to mucositis, but no evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
Pt had some evidence of low grade DIC that improved over ICU course, and oropharyngeal bleeding improved with plt tranfusion threshold >50.
The BAL cultures were + for GPCs & final culture was consistent with oral flora, thought not to be cause of her primary pulm process.
Blood Cx on [**2-15**] was + MSSA (2/4 bottles).
Fungal & Viral sputum cultures have otherwise been negative, blood Cx NGTD.
Pt had no RUQ tenderness on exam & repeat labs showed T.bili was trending down  with a stable haptoglobin & no schistocytes on smear.
#) Acute systolic heart failure: Pt presented to ICU with significant pulm edema & initial ECHO showed an EF drop from 70% to 10%, believed to be [**1-16**] acute chemo toxicity as pre chemo ECHO had a normal LVEF.
BP was well controlled & pt diuresed well.
However, after extubation BP has been difficult to control due to inability to take po meds, currently on IV Labetalol, Hydralazine, Lasix & started Clonidine patch on [**3-2**].
Renal US showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis.
BP has not been particularly responsive to diuresis.
Continue current regimen & anticipate >24hrs before onset of action for Clonidine patch.
# APML (15-17) s/p cytarbine, idarubicin followed by ATRA, intra-thecal ara-c on [**3-5**] - Had LP and per hemepath there were no definite blasts in CSF from [**3-5**]; did have myeloid precursors but likely contamination from peripheral blood - pt was continued on ATRA, along with Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis [**Name Initial (PRE) **] leukocytosis initially which was thought to be [**1-16**] ATRA maturation of cells and recovery of marrow which was consistent with normalization after a few days.
She will follow up at the outpatient clinic in several days for count checks and with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in approximately 1 week.
A repeat echo showed EF 55-60% (although not completely back to baseline).
An ultrasound confirmed a DVT associated with the PICC in that arm.
A repeat u/s on [**3-29**] confirmed the presence of continued clot in the subclavian vein.
Pt had some difficulty with high residuals and this was thought to be related to slow GI transit (large amount of contrast from barium swallow was seen on the KUB, no obstruction).
An EMG/NCS was done which was consistent with this dx.
MRI was negative for CSN involvement of tumor.
No APML blast on CSF and CSF cultures negative.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Ten (10) mL PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
You will also continue to take a blood thinner called Lovenox by injection to treat a blood clot in your left arm.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you experience fevers >100.5, chills, worsening headache, visual changes, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, worsening pain anywhere, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, painful urination, numbness, tingling, increased weakness, or any other symptom that concerns you.
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 3936**]  You have an appointment to have your PEG tube removed by the GI doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**4-13**] at 10am, at the Gastroenterology Center on the [**Location (un) **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
