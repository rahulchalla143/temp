He then had a biopsy which confirmed relapse, so presents today to start salvage chemotherapy.
A recent stress test and echo was suggestive for inferior wall ischemia, yet his cardiologist has cleared him to proceed with chemo.

Later in the morning (~11AM), after being given IV lasix, he developed SVT (appears to be AF with occasional sinus beats) with a ventricular rate in the 140s.
This was controlled somewhat with 2.5mg IV metoprolol with HR in the 120s.
Cardiology previously cleared pt to start chemotherapy despite echo and stress test findings.
