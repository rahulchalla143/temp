He was transferred to MICU for further management, started on IV heparin and TPA for presumptive pulmonary embolism.

ICU stay also c/b ARF (thought to be [**1-13**] to ACS), w rising creatinine and worsening acidosis, requiring bicarbonate drip.
Bladder pressure was found to have risen from 20 to 40.
The following day, the patient was weaning down from his pressor requirement, the PEEP was decreased from 20 to 10, he went back to the OR for a washout and placement of an HD line.
On [**4-9**], bedside cystogram showed disruption of the bladder anastamosis.
He was transfused 1u PRBC for Hct 23.1.
On [**4-12**], the white count was elevated and there was concern for possible VAP so a Bronch/BAL was performed and showed no purulent secretions.
Post-code CT scan included a CT of the head, which showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage but a possible early acute infarction in the left frontal lobe.
Per neurology, MRI Head, thoracic/Lumbar spine was obtained which showed: MRI Head: a ?????
MRI T/L-Spine: No evidence for cord ischemia.
Chest compressions and ACLS medications resulted in return of pulses and a bedside cardiac Echo was performed which showed: ?????
After patient was stable post-arrest, he was taken for emergent CT scan of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with the primary concern being a large pulmonary embolus.
CT of the chest showed: 1.
Multifocal segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli involving all lobes with CT findings suggestive of right ventricular strain.
This can be better evaluated with a conventional or CT angiogram if desired.
After Chest CT confirmed bilateral Pulmonary Emboli, it was felt that despite the patient being in the immediate post-op period, he would likely not survive without drastic attempts at clot lysis.
His cardiopulmonary function was noted to be improved after administration of TPA, but his hematocrit was noted to drop to a level of 16, for which he was emergently transfused.
He required intermittent transfusions and fluid boluses to maintain a HCT in the low 20?????
It was felt that unless his systolic blood pressures rose above 160, there was no need to increase the dose of his beta-blockers.
CT of the chest post-code and intubation is detailed above and showed bilateral pulmonary emboli.
He was given systemic TPA for clot lysis after PE was found on his CT scan.
CT scan of Abd/Pelvis after TPA noted: ?????
As compared to the prior CT scan, there is increase in the extent of bilateral pleural effusions, pericardial effusion and intraperitoneal free fluid.
Attempts at fluid resuscitation failed to improve his blood pressure, and his abdomen was noted to become more distended and tight with bladder pressures increasing to the mid 60??????s.
BP noted to improve after abdomen opened.
Once his BP stabilized and pt able to tolerate fluid removal, he had a large amount of fluid removed with approximately 2-3 liters of fluid per day removed.
His urine output slowly recovered such that his daily UOP was >1000cc.
At the time of discharge, his BUN and creatinine continue to decrease, and UOP is excellent.
A 19 Fr [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was left in the pelvis to collect and urine leakage.
The [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was kept on bulb suction for many days, but as UOP increased and drain output decreased, the bulb was taken off suction.
Repeated creatinine values taken from the pelvic drain fluid showed a creatinine value consistent with serous fluid and NOT urine.
A portable cystogram performed on the day of discharge did show a presumed urine leak after instillation of around 60 cc of cystograffin.
?s urine was slightly malodorous, and urine culture is pending.
His platelets were noted to drop after heparin started, for which HIT antibody assay was sent, which ultimately returned positive ([**2196-4-14**]).
During an abdominal washout procedure, he had a retrievable IVC filter placed by the ACS team ([**4-11**]).
Argatroban was discontinued once INR was between [**3-15**], at which point his INR returned in the mid-3?????
He was then given between 1-5 mg of Coumadin daily for anticoagulation with a goal INR of [**1-14**].
At the time of discharge, his HCT is stable above 30 and is slowly rising.
During his ICU stay, his foley was noted to have yeast growing in the tubing, for which a urine Cx was sent, which was positive for yeast.
WBC at the time of discharge was 14.
