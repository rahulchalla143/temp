[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Gross Description by:   DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 80901**]/mtd    SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: Esophagectomy, periazygos tissue.
Chest CT: 1.
Postoperative changes following esophagectomy and pull-up procedure, with no evidence of mediastinal extraluminal collections.
If there remains clinical suspicion for this complication, a fluoroscopic study may be helpful if warranted clinically.
Perihilar ground-glass opacities, which may reflect mild hydrostatic edema.
Final Report EXAM: PA and lateral chest [**2134-6-30**].
Upper mediastinal drain, and overlying surgical staples are unchanged.
He was placed on a lasix drip for fluid overload, and an echo was performed without significant result.
On [**6-21**] he converted back to sinus rhythm and his PCA was d/c'ed.
On [**6-22**] his lasix drip was weaned off, and a CT chest was performed to assess for leak.
On [**6-29**] his chest tube and foley were both discontinued with minimal apical pneumothorax (stable).
