CT Abd/Pelvis [**8-7**]: 1.
Limited study without contrast was designed primarily to evaluate for obstruction.
ECHO [**8-9**]: Hyperdynamic left ventricular function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-11-24**], the findings are similar.
#)SBO - Upon admission the patient was found on CT Abdomen to likely have a small bowel obstruction with transition point at the site of her ostomy.
