WRIST, AP & LAT VIEWS RIGHT Study Date of [**2200-4-15**] FINDINGS: A fiberglass cast obscures the bony detail of the right wrist.
CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2200-4-15**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Extensive retroperitoneal, retrocrural, and mesenteric adenopathy, unchanged compared to the recent MRI.
The rectal mass suggested by the MRI is not appreciated on the current study.
MRI PELVIS ([**4-20**]) There is no definite evidence of rectal or anal mass.
The abnormality noted on previous MRI likely represents collapsed bowel.
Brief Hospital Course: 67yo M w/ pheochromocytoma who presents with poor PO intake and nausea, imaging demonstrates progression of disease.
MRI abdomen showed overall increase in size of retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and portocaval lymphadenopathy compared with prior, consistent with progression of disease.
Patient's albumin of 3.9, suggests that poor nutrition alone as the sole cause of weight loss/FTT.
Goal BP range was 140-160 systolic per Endocrine service.
# Diabetes: Poorly controlled blood sugars likely secondary to progressive pheochromocytoma.
# Hypotension: The evening of admission to the ICU, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s.
A subclavian CVC was placed.
A CT A/P with PO contrast was obtained and revealed a incomplete small bowel obstruction near the left flank.
Initially believed to be secondary to a rectal mass visualized on pelvic MRI, however re-peat MRI demonstrated that this mass was merely collapsed bowel.
We performed an MRI of your abdomen that unfortunately showed that your disease has progressed.
