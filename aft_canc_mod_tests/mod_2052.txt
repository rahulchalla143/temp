Immunohistochemistry is being performed with antibodies CK7, CK20, TTF-1, and CDX2 to help identify possible sources.
A recent study suggests that this pattern of immunoreactivity might be indicative of a primary stomach, TTF-1-/CDX2+/CK7+/ CK20-, but there is a 15% false classification with this pattern.
A portion is frozen for intraoperative consultation performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] which reads: "Non small cell carcinoma and hemorrhage".
Compared to previous tracing of [**2109-1-30**] no major change.

The patient was worked up with imaging and two large intracranial lesions were found.
They recommended PET scan and follow up in the thoracic multidisciplinary clinic.
His pathology report from the frontal mass appears that he may infact have gastric cancer as the primary for the metestatic brain lesions although he does have a lung mass as well.
Follow up with Thoracic Surgery interdisciplinary clinic [**2109**]/ call them for an appointment and to have an outpatient PET scan, bone scan and EGD (esophogastroduodenoscopy)arranged for you.
