Admission Date:  [**2171-3-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-3-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-5-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillin V  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30062**] Chief Complaint: Lightheadedness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Placement of ET tube Placement of NG tube Placement of central line  History of Present Illness: 80 y/o F with h/o CAD s/p MI with stents in [**2164**], Htn, HL and recent bout of pneumonia, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH where she was found to have a leukocytosis of 137K with 88% lymphocytes.
She saw her PCP earlier today, who found her to have orthostatic hypotension, and checked labs revealing leukocytosis to 113K with 84% lymphocytes and many atypical lymphs.
She was referred to [**Hospital **] Hospital, where repeat labs showed WBC of 137K, with 88% lymphocytes and moderate smudge cells.
Labs at [**Hospital1 **] were also notable for BUN/creat of 30/1.2.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were 97.3, 82, 128/66, 18, 98%RA.
Exam was notable for irregularly irregular heart rhythm.
Labs revealed leukocytosis of 96.3K with 88% lymphocytes and no bands.
Hct and Plts were normal.
LDH was 332, and uric acid 7.8.
Lactate was 2.4.
ECG showed atrial fibrillation at ~80 bpm, LAD, TWI in I, aVL, V4-V6, and Q waves in V1-V2.
Heme/onc also saw the patient and reviewed her blood smear and saw that she had smudge cells consistent with CLL but also some immature lymphocytes.
This in conjunction with a rapid rise in her WBC count over the past year made cause for concern that she might have an immature clone, and her blood was sent for flow cytometry.
This evening, the patient subsequently developed an extremely rapid heart rate of 130s-140s while continuing to drop her pressures, which nadired at 78 systolic on the floor and spiked a temperature of 101.1.
She was bolused 1L on the floor without improvement of her blood pressures and was transferred to the ICU for further management.

DISCHARGE LABS: ................................................................ MICROBIOLOGY: **All blood, urine, and sputum cultures negative** ................................................................
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Diastolic function could not be assessed.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study of [**2171-3-11**], left ventricular systolic function is less dynamic and a resting LVOT gradient is no longer seen.
The heart rate is much slower and the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
Severe aortic valve stenosis is suggested with a peak velocity of 4m/s (64 mmHg).
Brief Hospital Course: 80 y/o F with h/o CAD s/p MI with stents in [**2164**], Htn, HL and recent bout of pneumonia, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH where she was found to have a leukocytosis of 137K with 88% lymphocytes concerning for leukemia.
A TEE demonstrated severe LVOT obstruction.
# Respiratory distress/Shock: Initially felt to be secondary to sepsis considering the patient's recent treatment for pneumonia, small infiltrate on CXR, and sputum positive for GNRs.
An ECHO revealed a hyperdynamic LV with consequent development of an LVOT gradient at the mitral valve.
Repeat ECHO showed severe AS, and much of her symptoms were felt to be due to this.
However, subsequent TEE demonstrated that patient's cardiac dysfunction was secondary to significant LVOT obstruction, and that her aortic valve was not significantly stenosed.
On [**3-11**] she developed SVT vs. VT (rate 200/minute), pulse present.
Shock delivered - returned to atrial fibrillation with slower rate (<100).
Urine sediment showed 30-40 monomorphic RBCs per HPF, 3-5 WBCs, several granular casts, and a few muddy brown casts, consistent with ATN.
# GI Bleed: Pt with h/o erosive gastritis seen on an EGD in [**2161**].
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES The patient expired   Medications on Admission: 1. amlodipine 5 mg daily 2. atenolol 50 mg daily 3. calcium 500 mg daily 4. furosemide 20 mg PO 3x/week 5. iron ?
