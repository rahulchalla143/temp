On arrival to ED, VS: T 100.8 rectal 106 24 100% on vent.
Labs were significant for WBC 28.3, lactate 10.2, INR 1.4.
The patient was given vecuronium in order to obtain a head CT. CT head showed large mass centered in left frontal sinus with lytic bony destruction and posterior extention into left frontal lobe.
Neurology was consulted, who recommended an MRI w/ and w/out contrast to r/o an infectious process.
CXR showed a large right hilar pulmonary mass causing post obstructive atelectasis.
Vent settings on transfer were: FiO2 100%, RR 24, PEEP 5, O2 100%.
His CXR showed a RUL consolidation, however there was concern for an underlying lesion on a CT.
He had a bronchoscopy performed at [**Hospital3 **] on Friday [**2118-11-25**] along with a biopsy of a presumed lesion.
The pathology results are pending at this time.

VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO VIRUS ISOLATED.
Aspergillus galactomannan- negative Beta glucan- negative  IMAGING: CT head w/o contrast ([**2118-11-28**])- Large predominantly hyperattenuating mass centered in the left frontal sinus associated with aggressive lytic osseous destruction and posterior extension into the left frontal lobe, most concerning for neoplastic process, particularly given known right lung mass.
MRI head w&w/o contrast ([**2118-11-28**])- Large heterogeneously enhancing mass in the frontal sinus with intracranial extension and destruction of inner and outer tables of the frontal sinus, bilateral cribriform plates and invasion of the anterior portion of the superior sagittal sinus.
CT head w&w/o contrast ([**2118-11-28**])- Large peripherally enhancing mass centered predominantly in frontal sinuses with associated vasogenic edema and mild mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
EEG ([**2118-11-28**])- This portable bedside EEG gives evidence for focal slowing in the left frontal quadrant compatible with a structural lesion of that area with superimposed high voltage interictal epileptiform transients in the left frontal polar region and short runs of brief electrographic seizure activity that were without any obvious clinical accompaniment.
EEG ([**2118-11-29**])- This EEG gives evidence for a focal slow wave abnormality over the left frontal polar region suggestive of a subcortical/cortical junctional structural abnormality.
CT Abd/pelvis ([**2118-11-29**])- 1.
The differential would include metastatic disease to the right kidney or a primary renal lesion and biopsy should be considered to help differentiate between these two possibilities.
CT Chest ([**2118-11-29**])- 1.
The differential would include metastatic disease to the right kidney or a primary renal lesion and biopsy should be considered to help differentiate between these two possibilities.
Fusion Protocol Maxillofacial CT ([**2118-11-30**])- Unchanged NSCLC metastasis in the frontal sinus with destruction of surrounding osseous structures and invasion into the ethmoid air cells and frontal lobe of the brain.
CT Neck w/contrast ([**2118-11-30**])- No evidence of metastasis in the neck.

He had no history of prior seizures and toxicology screens were negative.
CT scan of head in the ED showed a large mass in the frontal lobe.
With further imaging (MRI, CT with contrast, fusion maxillofacial CT), it was noted that the mass invaded through the bone into the frontal sinus and ethmoid air cells.
He had no further clinical seizures, but on EEG continued to have subclinical focal seizures in the frontal lobe.
# RUL and sinus mass: Patient had a recent admission at [**Hospital1 **] with pneumonia.
CXR showed a right upper lobe mass, which was followed by a CT scan which showed the same, with resulting post-obstructive pneumonia.
Preliminary reports of this biopsy showed poorly differentiated non-small cells.
Pathology and CT imaging was sent from [**Hospital3 **] for further interpretation.
Of note, pathology was confirmed at [**Hospital1 **] and showed that the lung mass was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Block was sent for k-ras, alk, and EGFR mutations.
# Leukocytosis/fever: Elevated white count thought to be partly due to stress response, however, CXR with large post-obstructive pneumonia.
Blood and CSF cultures showed no growth to date.
It was felt that a large component of this leukocytosis was secondary to a leukemoid reaction in the setting of pulmonary malignancy.
