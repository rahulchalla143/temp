Sputum GS showed 4+ GNR, 3+ GPC in pairs/chains, 2+ GP rods.
Repeat chest X rays showed no significant change.
# SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION: Pt had positive blood cultures from [**8-22**] of Strep anginosus, but the validity and source of this bacteremia is not clear: the Strep grew in only 1 out of 4 tubes, and the sputum culture from [**8-22**] grew GNR.
Urine culture on [**8-22**] showed <[**Numeric Identifier 4856**] Enterococci, and U/A was negative.
Follow-up urine cx was negative.
Follow-up blood cultures have grown nothing to date.
Pressures dropped as pressors were weaned, but urine output remained good, albeit decreased overall, with a stable Cr of 0.5.
?s hct continued to drop: he received 2 units blood for a hct of 21 on [**8-23**] with recovery to 27 and again on [**8-25**] for a hct of 22.
Hemolysis was very unlikely given t bili of 0.4 at admission and lack of jaundice; this was confirmed by hemolysis labs that were negative.
The pt's new thrombocytopenia (138 at admission) was initially relatively stable and most likely due to sepsis.
There was an acute drop in plt count to 69 mid-course that may have been drug-related.
Creatinine and urine output were monitored during his hospitalization.
TSH 0.23, follow up fT4 0.66 -> central hypothyroidism.
