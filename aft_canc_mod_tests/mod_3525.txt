TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images of the abdomen were obtained without IV contrast.
Subsequently, MDCT-acquired axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis obtained with IV contrast.
Delayed phase images of the abdomen and pelvis were also obtained.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Again seen are innumerable bilateral metastatic lesions scattered throughout the lungs.
Lesion 1 as identified on the oncology table, which previously measured 15 x 13 mm, now measures 19 x 17 mm on today's study, and is best seen on series 3, image 49.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Again seen are innumerable metastatic hypodense lesions throughout the liver.
Again seen is a lesion in the left side overlying the peritoneum that has increased in size from approximately 0.5 cm on prior study to 1.2 cm on today's study, and is concerning for metastatic disease.
On prior study the greatest cross-sectional diameter of this mass was 10 x 6.9 cm.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The distal ureters appear within normal limits.
The large soft tissue mass which extends into the pelvis as described above is seen with cross-sectional dimensions measured on series 4, image 71.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Please note that in regard to the category of stroke, the etiologies could include amyloid angiopathy (primary hemorrhage), hemorrhagic transformation of either an arterial or venous infarct.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN:  HISTORY: Melanoma.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT scan.
COMPARISON: Gadolinium enhanced MR study of [**2179-7-29**].
A second punctate area of hyperdensity likely indicates a hemorrhagic metastasis within the left cerebellum.

CT SCAN OF THE BRAIN, [**2179-9-15**]:  INDICATION: Left occipital hemorrhage from metastatic melanoma, evaluate for interval change.
TECHNIQUE: Axial noncontrast CT scans of the brain were obtained.
Better defined on today's examination are two foci of hemorrhage within the cerebellar hemispheres, right slightly larger than left.
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the brain without and with gadolinium.
COMPARISON: Head CT from [**2179-9-15**].
MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM: Three abnormally enhancing foci are seen within the cerebellum, which are most likely metastases.
Diffusion- weighted imaging shows no areas of acute ischemia.
Left occipital parenchymal hemorrhage unchanged allowing for differences in modality, since the head CT from [**9-15**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
HCT remained stable.
Pt comppleted 3 out of 12 radiation sessions.
SBP 130-150 per neuro.
-On decadron - with PPI and RISS -?nausea related to XRT.
CXR showed no new air space opacities but slight increase in size in known metastatic nodules.
Now resolved with WBC >7000.
