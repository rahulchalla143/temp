LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count of 12.2, hemoglobin of 8.4, hematocrit 23.8, platelets 143.
BUN 43, creatinine 1.2, ALT 272, AST 93, alkaline phosphatase 750.
GI:  The patient received abdominal CT scan on admission which showed free air within the abdomen and a moderate amount of free fluid.
Given this CT scan finding, the patient was taken to surgery.
A CT scan performed on [**7-25**] prior to discharge was significant for improvement in the free air and free fluid.
The patient was maintained on the Solu-Medrol, cyclosporin, and CellCept for graft-versus-host disease, with cyclosporin levels checked regularly and doses adjusted accordingly.
His blood cultures were sent.
Urine cultures were sent, and his right IJ tip were sent for cultures.
The patient was placed back on Zosyn per ID approval, and once a chest x-ray became positive for a new left basilar infiltrate consistent with pneumonia, levofloxacin was added to his antibiotic regimen.
A CT scan performed on [**7-22**] was significant for multifocal patchy pulmonary opacities in the peribronchial distribution involving mid and lower lung zones with associated bronchial obstruction of segments of the left lower lobe consistent with aspiration pneumonia versus fungal infection.
Given these findings, expectorated sputum and induced sputum samples were sent for culture.
The cultures from the sputum samples eventually grew out Aspergillus fumigatus.
A CT scan performed on [**7-25**] was significant for interval resolution of a mucoid impaction of the left lower lobe airways, however, tree ............... opacities and ill-defined peribronchial nodules and foci of consolidations were discovered primarily in the lower lobes, but also in the right middle lobe and lingula.
Cardiovascular:  After transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**], the patient's blood pressure became gradually increased with diastolic blood pressure over 100.
The patient's cyclosporin levels were found to be markedly elevated given thought to be secondary to voreconazole increasing their levels.
Once this interaction was identified, and the patient's cyclosporin levels were decreased in half, his blood pressures were more easily manageable.
The patient will be discharged with nifedipine 5 mg po prn for diastolic blood pressures over 95.
FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is to get daily cyclosporin levels drawn at [**Hospital3 **], to present to [**Hospital3 **] on the day following discharge.
