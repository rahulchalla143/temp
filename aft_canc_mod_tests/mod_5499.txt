At that time, an abdominal U/S was obtained, which revealed an enlarged uterus with an echogenic mass.
Further work-up included an abdominal MRI remarkable for an enlarged uterus, thickened endometrial stripe, and a vaginal mass.
A CXR was also obtained, concerning for metastatic disease, and a CT chest subsequently confirmed pulmonary metastases, without PE.
An MRI brain was negative.
She was seen by an oncologist at [**Hospital3 **], and seen today on the day of admission in the [**Hospital 6669**] [**Hospital **] clinic for a biopsy of the vaginal mass, which was performed.
While in the [**Hospital **] clinic, her saturation was noted to be 86% on RA, and she was referred to L&D triage on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**].
From there, she was admitted to 12 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**], where concern was raised over her breathing status, and she was transferred to the ICU for close monitoring.
Saturation 90-95% on 6L  NC at the time of transfer.
Physical Exam: Physical examination on admission VITALS: T 99.4  HR104  BP125/71  RR32  O2sat: 92%RA on 6L NC GEN: Tachypneic, able to speak with full sentences, short of breath with minimal exertion.

[**2165-5-7**] MRI BRAIN with gad:1.
[**2165-5-9**] CT CHEST/[**Last Name (un) **] with contrast: 1.
[**2165-5-13**] CT CHEST/[**Last Name (un) **] WITH CONTRAST: 1.
[**2165-5-27**] CT CHEST: 1.
1) Pulmonary: As noted above, her initial CT chest was remarkable for innumerable pulmonary metastases, without PE (although a subsegmental PE could not be excluded).
The pathology from her vaginal biopsy eventually returned as poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, and per Hematology/Oncology, systemic chemotherapy was initiated with Carboplatin and Taxol (day 1 on [**2165-5-14**]).
2) Metastatic malignancy: As noted above, pathology from her vaginal biopsy eventually returned as poorly differentiated carcinoma, most likely squamous.
A repeat CT chest on [**2165-5-30**] showed some radiographic improvement in tumor burden, albeit with limited meaningful clinical improvement.
