[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/vf Previous biopsies:    [**-9/5489**]  GI BX (1 JAR)  DIAGNOSIS: Colon, 20 cm, biopsy: Colonic adenocarcinoma, low grade.
CT CHEST ABDOMEN PELVIS [**2201-12-23**]: LUNGS: Mild apical scarring and centrilobular emphysema is seen.
A left renal cyst (3:66) and right renal cyst (3:61) are noted.
There is a 1-cm left adrenal mass which is unchanged from prior study and statistically represents an adenoma.
Status post TIPS which is widely patent.
If clinically indicated, a CT colonoscopy can be performed for better evaluation.
TTE [**2201-12-24**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-3-11**], the severity of aortic stenosis has increased by transvalvular velocity and gradients from moderate to critical; however, visually the valve appears to be similarly pliable.
Sixteen lymph nodes with no carcinoma identified (0/16; additional levels are examined on blocks N and U).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
If concern for mechanical small bowel obstruction persists, a CT would provide better characterization.

Unfortunately colonoscopy on [**12-23**] showed a sigmoid mass, and pathology confirmed adenocarcinoma.
# Acute on chronic anemia: Pt presented with Hct 22, baseline Hct ~28.
He received 1 unit pRBCs and his Hct appropriately increased.
On discharge his Hct was 30.1.
Aortic Stenosis: [**Location (un) 109**] on TTE obtained [**12-24**] 0.7 cm2.
His creatinine returned to his baseline of 1.1 without intervention.
Hyperkalemia: Potassium was elevated on admission to 6.0 with EKG changes concerning for peaked T waves.
He received insulin/glucose/calcium and kayexolate and his potassium returned to [**Location 213**].
S. anginosus Bacteremia: During previous hospitalization, pt had blood cx [**11-17**] and [**11-28**] that grew Strep anginosus in setting of GI bleed.
Blood cultures were repeated on [**2201-12-28**] and were negative.
Idiopathic Cirrhosis s/p TIPS: On admission pt's LFTs, T bili, and INR were normal.
He has h/o esophageal varices on no varices were visualized on EGD of [**2201-11-25**] during previous hospitalization.
Last CD4 94 on [**2201-11-27**], viral load undectectable.
Transitional issues: - He maintained DNR/DNI code status (reversed for procedures and surgery).
Pt was monitored intraoperatively with a TEE and no changes in hemodynamics were noted.
CV: The patient was closely monitored from a cardiovascular standpoint with a goal SBP above 120mmHg.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
On POD 5 he vomited 300cc, put back to sips, KUB showed air fluid levels,and an NGT was placed putting out 500cc of bilious fluid.
On POD 6 a CT scan that day failed to show leak or ascites and confirmed an ileus.
On POD 8 NGT was d/c and he has advanced to sips without issue and a KUB was obtained after he stopped passing flatus and it showed colonic air - pt was given a suppository and began passing large amounts of flatus and had a BM which continued into POD 9 at which time he was advanced to a regular diet which was well tolerated.
A JP drain was discontinued on POD 4 and a stitch was placed which was removed before discharge.
C. diff was sent on POD 6 for liquid stools but were all negative.
Patient's intake and output were closely monitored and electroyltes repleted as needed.
Blood, urine, and stool cultures were all negative.
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs of bleeding post-operatively, of which there were none.
No post-operative transfusions were required and hematocrit was 30 at discharge and stable without signs of GI bleed.
Polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram PO daily 8.
You had a colonoscopy, which unfortunately showed a cancer in your colon.
You received 1 unit of blood prior to surgery and your blood counts improved.
