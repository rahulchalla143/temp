He went to an outside hospital, where he was noted to have a temperature of 99.2 F, heart rate of 106, oxygen saturation of 89% on 2 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula and subsequently 92% on 6 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula, and a blood pressure of 53/31.
He had a head CT scan that was negative.
Upon arrival at the [**Hospital1 69**], the patient was found to be markedly hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 92% on 100% nonrebreather face mask.
A subsequent arterial blood gas demonstrated a pH of 7.44, pCO2 of 34, and pO2 of 57.
Of note, the patient reportedly had a CT angiogram done at the outside hospital that demonstrated a persistent left upper lobe mass, small bilateral pleural effusions, and small segmental pulmonary emboli on the right.
Because of the brain metastases, a neurosurgery consult was requested prior to the initiation of Heparin drip.
Severe emphysema with a diffusion capacity of 52% of predicted on pulmonary function tests done on [**2190-4-15**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination, the patient's temperature was 102.7 F, heart rate 104, blood pressure 97/53, respiratory rate 24, and oxygen saturation was 90% on 100% non-rebreather face mask.
His heart rate was tachycardic and there were normal S1, S2 heart sounds.
Chest X-ray done on the day of admission demonstrated no evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
The patient then had a CT scan of the chest done on the day of admission that was initially read as demonstrating a right posterior segmental pulmonary embolus, as well as interval increase in the size of the left lower lobe lung mass.
He then had a head CT scan that demonstrated no evidence for a new appreciable intracranial hemorrhage.
Patient's initial laboratory evaluations demonstrated a white blood cell count of 20.1 (differential 86% neutrophils, 2% bands, 9% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes).
Hematocrit 41.4, platelet count of 197,000.
His serum sodium was 133, potassium 4.4, chloride 99, bicarb 24, BUN 31, creatinine 1.3, glucose 77, potassium 7.7, magnesium 1.8, and phosphate 4.8.
His ALT was 100, AST 59, and amylase 74.
His urinalysis demonstrated a specific gravity of 1.007, small blood, trace protein, trace ketones, and was otherwise negative for any infectious process.
His electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus tachycardia at 100 beats per minute, rightward axis, and incomplete right bundle branch block, and had no significant change compared with an electrocardiogram dated [**2190-3-15**].
The patient's blood pressure subsequently normalized, and he did not require further administration of pressors during this hospitalization.
On [**2190-5-17**], the patient's systolic blood pressure dropped into the 80's; his blood pressure normalized with the administration of an IV fluid bolus.
On the following day, however, the patient was again febrile to 103.6 F, and his systolic blood pressure dropped to the 70's.
A repeat head CT scan done at that time was negative for any new findings and there were no infectious sources that could explain the patient's fever and hypotension.
Because of his deteriorating clinical status, the patient was again transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
His INR was still somewhat labile by the time of his discharge from the hospital; his INR on the day of discharge was 2.7.
Warfarin 3 mg po q hs with a goal INR ranging between 2 and 3.
