An EKG showed NSR with nnormal axis and intervals and no ischemic ST or T-wave changes.
Initial CK was flat at 50, with troponin slightly elevated to 0.1, from a recent baseline around 0.8.
A CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism and demonstrated a new RUL opacity tracking along the fissure, and thought by radiology to most likely reflect plate-like atelectasis related to her history of sarcoidosis.
Lower extremity dopplers were negative for DVTs.
Her labs were otherwise normal except for her baseline elevated bicarbonate.
Sarcoidosis/Pulm HTN -Home O2 at 4L -Inhaled iloprost and prednisone 4.
COMPARISON: CTA of the chest from [**2177-3-28**] and CT of the torso from [**2177-3-11**].
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning of the chest was performed before and following intravenous contrast administration.
Large left upper quadrant abdominal mass and retrocrural calcified lymphadenopathy, similar to prior studies and compatible with metastatic disease.

Initial evaluation was generally unremarkable with LENIs negative for DVT, CTA not suggestive of PE.
At that time, her initial ABG was notable for PCO2 of 132.
Developed increased RR on [**4-23**] to 26-30 and CXR was c/w volume overload.
ABG was 7.26/99/32, placed in BIPAP without improvement (7.22/107/62).
During her hospital course patient had numerous transfers to the ICU for mental status changes and respiratory failure, which became increasingly difficult to control, she was DNR/DNI and remained BiPAP dependant.
Hyponatremia: presentation and urine lytes c/w SIADH in the setting of pulmonary disease.
Fluid restriction of 1.5L, and continued salt tabs.
TSH cortisol normal and less likely to include in the differential.
Lorazepam 0.5mg q6-8h 15.
