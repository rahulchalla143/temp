A chest CT was performed at [**Hospital3 45357**] in [**Hospital1 1474**] and revealed a 2 cm nodule anterior to the distal aspect of the main pulmonary artery that was suspicious for thymoma.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, blood pressure 121/74, heart rate 91, FVC 1.5 liters.
Cardiac examination revealed a normal S1 and S2, with a regular rate, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Funduscopic examination was normal on both the left and the right.
V1 through V3 is symmetric and intact to temperature, light touch and pinprick.
On strength examination, her deltoids were 5-/5 bilaterally, biceps [**3-25**], triceps [**3-25**], wrist extensors [**3-25**], wrist flexors [**3-25**], finger flexors [**2-23**] bilaterally, finger extensors [**2-23**], and interosseous [**2-23**] bilaterally.
Sensory examination intact to light touch and temperature.
Her reflexes were 2+ and symmetric in the upper extremities, absent in the lower extremities, with downgoing toes bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  CBC was within normal limits.
She had a tensilon test given in the Emergency Department, and her Mestinon dose was increased from 60 three times a day to 90 three times a day.
Speech and swallow study on that day showed that the patient was having difficulty with thin liquids.
Two days later, on [**8-16**], the patient had worsening weakness with a NIF of -30 and FVC of 0.9.
On [**8-17**], the patient's NIF was increased, with an FVC of 1.55.
On [**8-19**], she had a repeat chest CT which showed a 15 x 8 mm anterior mediastinal mass, suspicious for thymoma.
Vaginal examination was done, which showed no blood in the vaginal canal.
Despite her increased facial weakness and difficulty swallowing, the patient had no decrease in her NIF or vital capacity, which remained stable at -80 and 1.3 liters.
Her NIF was back to -58 to -80, and her vital capacity was 1.1 to 1.5 liters.
Over the following few days, her NIF increased to -80 or above, and her vital capacity remained greater than 2 liters.
A vaginal examination revealed blood in the vaginal canal.
This examination revealed an extremely small cervical opening secondary to scarring status post a cone biopsy in the spring of [**2197**].
They suggested doing an endometrial biopsy under anesthesia, as the patient had been already scheduled for thymectomy to be performed on [**2198-9-11**].
