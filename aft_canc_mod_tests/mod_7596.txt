There is mild increased T2, FLAIR signal in the right superior frontal gyrus and extensive increased T2, FLAIR signal in the left frontal lobe, unchanged since the prior exam and likely representing vasogenic edema.
#Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hyperglycemia as correction of blood sugars resulted in slow resolution of his altered mental status.
MRI without change in mets or worsening vasogenic edema, LP without signs of infection (although HSV PCR pending).
Urine and blood cultures negative.
CT thorax without evidence of intrapulmonary or intraabdominal infection.
Blood sugars should be controlled in the future to avoid further worsening of his mental status.
CT thorax neg for infection.
UA repeat neg x2.
#Non-small cell lung cancer/Goals of Care: metastatic to frontal sinus.
CT thorax with worsening metastatic disease and interval loss of fat plane between primary tumor and SVC suggestive of SVC invasion.
Due to these CT findings, his primary oncologist and the palliative care team determined that he was no longer a candidate for chemotherapy and that he should pursue inpatient hospice.
He is being discharged on an insulin sliding scale in instruction to monitor blood sugars QACHS with understanding that the insulin coverage might not be needed eventually and can be discontinued.
Cardiac enzymes flat.
Initially presented with WBC count of 80,000 and has since downtrended to approximately 40,000.

We corrected the blood sugar and you became less confused.
We did a CT scan which showed that your cancer has not improved, but instead has gotten worse.
