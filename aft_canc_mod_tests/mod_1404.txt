ABD (SINGLE VIEW ONLY)  [**2131-11-6**] 11:21 AM FINDINGS: Single supine radiograph was obtained following injection of approximately 30 cc of Conray through the patient's existing J-tube.
He did not have any ischemic changes on EKG and enzymes were negative for troponin leak.
Infectious work-up negative and the patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage until he was afebrile with an ANC > 1000.
otherwise remarkable for negative U/A, CXR without infiltrate, blood cultures pending, but currently negative.
His Neulasta was continued until the ANC reached appropriate levels and his levels normalized to acceptable levels.
He was followed by Surgery for the initial hospital course while he had the ileus, but once his febrile neutropenia resolved and his ileus resolved the Surgery service signed off.
The tube feeds were promptly stopped, broad spectrum antibiotics were started, and abdominal imaging was done.
These images were negative for perforation but showed a continual ileus.
Please call your primary doctor or return to the ED with fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, vomiting blood or any other concerning symptoms.
