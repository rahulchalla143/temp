After she arrived at our ED, a head CT was taken and showed "2.3 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm lesion in the high left frontoparietal region with surrounding vasogenic edema.
The neurology team saw her and recommended an MRI of head and starting Keppra and steroid.
She denied focalized weakness, tingling, fecal and urine incontinence.
On [**2102-8-8**] an excisional biopsy was performed with pathology revealing an at least 14.5 mm deep, ulcerated and invasive melanoma, which was classified as type non-specific, but clearly contained a nodular component.
Additionally, a PET/CT scan showed a 3 cm FDG-avid mass in her right axilla without other disease.
On [**2103-1-3**], she was preparing to commence a year of adjuvant interferon when a suspicious lesion was identified on her right leg above the ankle and was biopsied, with pathology showing a 1.2 mm deep, non-ulcerated invasive melanoma with at least two mitoses per square millimeter.
In early [**Month (only) 116**], her chest x-ray revealed a new, ill-defined opacity in the right apex projecting over the posterior third rib.
On follow up CT performed [**6-15**], an area of most likely scarring was seen in the right apex without features consistent with neoplasm seen.
She was referred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, underwent an ERCP with sphincterotomy on [**6-20**] and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on [**6-21**].

MRI HEAD [**2103-10-27**]:Multiple parenchymal enhancing lesions, consistent with metastases.
CT C/A/P [**2103-10-27**]: 1.
EEG [**2103-10-28**] This is an abnormal awake and sleep EEG due to the presence of occasional sharp wave discharges and spike and slow wave discharges in the bilateral frontal central regions, phase reversing at F3 and F4, indicative of an area of epileptogenic cortex in these regions.
MRI brain [**2103-10-31**] Stable appearance to multifocal peripheral parenchymal enhancing lesions, with a large amount of edema surrounding the left parietal lesion.
CT head [**2103-10-31**] 1.
Head CT revealed a new mass.
EEG was also done which showed epileptogenic cortex in frontal lobes bilaterally but no seizures, as well as subcortical dysfunction.
Due to hemorrhage associated with lesion, anticoagulation and antiplatalet therapies were avoided (DVT prophylaxis with pneumoboots) and pt was placed on captopril to maintain SBP goal <160.
CT head showed no hemorrhage.
