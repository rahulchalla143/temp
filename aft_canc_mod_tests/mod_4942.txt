IMAGING: CXR (OSH) cephalization; blunting of left costophrenic angle; no clear inflitrates  CT Abdomen/Pelvis: 1.
Would recommend further evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT or abdominal ultrasound.
CT Head w/o contrast: 1.
CTA head/neck: 1.
Lung nodules measuring greater than 1 cm in diameter, concerning for neoplastic process.
Dedicated chest CT is recommended to further evaluate the above findings.
Further evaluation of this lesion would require surgery.
Ovarian mass and lung nodules: Upon admission to the hospital, she had a CT abdomen/pelvis which showed an adnexal mass which was not well characterized.
She had a follow-up pelvic ultrasound which demonstrated a large cystic adnexal mass concerning for cystic neoplasm.
She had a video swallow study which showed that she aspirated both liquids and solids.
Vertebral artery aneurysm: A brain MRI showed a medullary mass which was later characterized as a large vertebral artery aneurysm.
Her hematocrit was 20 on admission and she was given 4 units of blood and her hematocrit increased and remained stable during her stay.
She had a CT scan which showed an enlarged gall bladder, stool, an adnexal mass and pneumonia.
The gastroenterology team evaluated the patient and recommended an EGD/colonoscopy under anesthesia to evalute anemia in this patient.
Cardiology was consulted to assess the risk of EGD under general anesthesia as she had a troponin of 0.17 on admission with an echo that showed subtle hypokinesis of mid-inferolateral wall but no significant wall motion abnormality.
Cardiology initially felt that she could complete EGD/colonoscopy without further cardiology testing and should start a beta blocker for BP control.
As her respiratory status and functional status were poor, the patient and her family elected to defer further workup due to multiple comorbidities.
Chest xray showed new infiltrate in the left lower lobe.
Her blood cultures were negative.
UTI: She had two positive urinalyses with urine cultures that grew E. Coli.
Her final urine culture had not grown any bacteria at the time of discharge, although did grow yeast.
Her platelets remained elevated at the time of discharge, and her hydroxyurea was stopped when her goals of care became comfort measures only.
She remained without chest pain and the ECG changes were not dynamic.
An echo was completed with subtle hypokinesis of mid inferolateral wall but no significant wall motion abnormality.
