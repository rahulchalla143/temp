On [**2182-3-20**] Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy of the left main stem bronchus with Argon plasma coagulation of the bleeding mucosa of the left main stem bronchus for further evaluation of the left main stem occlusion with a tumor.
On [**2182-3-25**] the patient underwent repeat bronchoscopy with the goal being tumor destruction and dilation.
At this point the Radiation Oncology resident was called for evaluation of the role of radiation therapy for Mrs.[**Known lastname 52537**] left main stem bronchus tumor.
At the point Oncology was consulted, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was already intubated and her performance score was quite low.
The pathology from [**2182-3-20**] showed non-small cell poorly differentiated lung carcinoma.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had a head CT which was negative for metastases.
The CT scan on [**2182-3-19**] had documented the enhancing soft tissue mass within 2 cm of the carina and a question of an extrabronchial component of the neoplastic mass in the left hilum.
The CT at that time recommended correlative PET imaging for the further evaluation of her metastases.
In addition, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had had an echocardiogram which showed left ventricular outflow track gradient of 37 and moderate left ventricular outflow obstruction as well as aortic stenosis.
Blood pressure in the 60s with an ejection fraction of 75%.
An urgent bronchoscopy was performed which removed some mucus plugging and some bloody secretions and documented the tumor obstructing 75% of her left main stem bronchi.
Her oxygen saturations improved, as well.
It was felt that part of the difficulty weaning Mrs. [**Known lastname **] to pressure-support ventilation was secondary to volume overload given that she was significantly net positive and by chest x-ray had evidence of congestive heart failure.
Her PEEP was immediately increased back and her FIO2 was increased; however, her oxygen saturations did not improve.
The PEEP was further increased to 12, 100% FIO2, and her sats remained quite low.
A repeat urgent bronchoscopy was performed which showed that the left main stem bronchus appeared to be about 85% occluded by the tumor at this point.
Again, post bronchoscopy, her left upper lobe opened up and her oxygen saturation improved.
A decision was made to repeat a chest CT to evaluate if there was any progression of the multiple right lung nodules as a PET scan could not be performed while she was intubated.
The repeat chest CT scan was unable to fully assess the right lung field for the nodules which were again seen secondary to motion artifact.
On [**2182-4-12**], a chest CT scan did show worsening bilateral pleural effusions and persistent left lower lobe collapse and probable direct invasions of the mass in the mediastinum posteriorly.
