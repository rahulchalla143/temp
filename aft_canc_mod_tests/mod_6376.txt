Repeat CT scan [**2139-3-11**] showed progression despite this therapy, thus she started Taxotere on [**2139-3-18**].
Bronchoscopy revealed a intraluminal lesion in her right main bronchus with almost complete obstruction.
She was then transferred to the ICU at [**Hospital1 18**] with plan for IP evaluation and possible stenting the following morning.
ABG at 0648 [**2139-3-30**] on 15L O2, 7.43/43/63.
VS on transfer 112/59, 117, 37, 99, 95/NRB.
Past Medical History: NSCLC: Dx [**2137**] s/p chemotherapy x 6 cycles with [**Doctor Last Name **]-alimta-erbiltix; with disease progression [**2139-3-11**]; started Taxotere [**2139-3-18**] x 1 Pericardial effusion with tamponade [**2139-3-21**]   Social History: Previously worked in [**Last Name (un) **] management prior to cancer diagnosis.
Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam VS: 97.2, 117, 104/73, 35 and 100/NRB GEN: Appears calm at rest but HEENT:  NCAT, NRB in place, mouth breathing CV:  Tachycardia, regular, without murmur PULM:  Course breath sound with more bronchial breath sounds on right; thoracotomy incision with dressing clean, dry, intact and no erythema or exudate ABD:  Mildly distended, nontender with minimal bowel sounds LIMBS:  WWP without edema SKIN:  With some eccymoses on abdomen, no erthyema around PIVs NEURO:  A&O x 3 .

CXR [**2139-3-30**]: Homogeneous opacity of the right hemithorax with mild rightward mediastinal and tracheal shift , with abrupt cutoff of the right main bronchus is concerning for right hilar mass lesion with collapse of the right lung.
Recommended a CT chest with contrast for further evaluation.
CT chest with contrast [**2139-3-31**]: 1)large right hilar mass which infiltrates the collapsed right middle and lower lobes and obstructs the right main stem bronchus just beyond its takeoff.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
An apical pericardial adhesion cannot be excluded.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2139-4-12**] at 6:03:31 PM The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Found to have an intraluminal lesion in her right main bronchus with almost complete obstruction of the RML and RLL for which she underwent rigid bronchoscopy with some tumor debridement and recanualization.
Despite this intervention, the patient's respiratory status worsened, repeat TTE showed persistent posterior loculated effusion with persistent tamponade physiology.
Transferred to the CCU for further evaluation and management on [**4-12**].
Leukocytosis/UTI - pt has had a stably high WBC count in the 27-29's, but no signs of sepsis.
BP remained in high 90-100s.
Returned to sinus rhythm with carotid sinus massage.
Start Lorazepam 0.5-1mg every 6 hours as needed for pain 5.
