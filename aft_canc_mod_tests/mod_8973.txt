Given her shortness of breath and tachycardia, a CT chest was obained on admission which showed no PE, but right middle and lower lobe air space opacities suggestive of multifocal consolidation, as well as multiple nodular densities in the right upper lobe, left upper lobe, and left lower lobe with associated central cavitation concerning for septic emboli.
Due to her IVDU history and CT findings there was concern for endocarditis and was started on vanco/ceftriaxone.
Echo was obtained showing 2 cm vegetation on the tricuspid valve, with potential concern for fungal vegetation.
Blood cultures were drawn and are now growing out GPC clusters in [**2-9**] bottles.
HIV and Hepatitis B and C serologies were sent given her IVDU and were pending on transfer.

CT abd/pelvis: [**2182-4-22**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Increased bilateral pleural effusions since the reference study from [**2182-4-18**].
CT abd/pelvis: [**2182-4-26**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT chest [**2182-4-27**] IMPRESSION:  1.
CT chest: [**2182-5-1**] IMPRESSION:  1.
CT torso showed cavitary lesions suggestive of septic emboli, and echo with large tricuspid vegitation suggestive of endocarditis.
CT scan at the OSH with cavitary lung lesions, consistent with septic emboli from her known endocarditis.
She was seen in consultation by the infectious disease service and the cardiac surgery service, she underwent a TEE which showed a 1.7cm x 1cm tricuspid valve vegetation, no abscess formation, and no involvement of any other valves.
She remained on vancomycin with a goal trough of over 20, when the cultures from the OSH returned MSSA it was decided to continue her on vancomycin given her history of throat closing with amoxicillin.
Her daily EKG's did not show any evidence of conduction system disease.
The patient was found to have an increasing white count and repeat CT chest was done on [**2182-5-1**].
However, CT chest showed improvement compared to priors, and thoracics said no intervention was needed at this time.
# Fevers/weight loss: Prior to transfer given the septic emboli on her chest CT and fevers and weight loss there was concern for possible TB.
A PPD placed at the OSH was negative and she had three sputums negative for AFB.
# Tachycardia:  CTA negative for PE prior to transfer, thought to be related to pain, fever and withdrawal symptoms, she was monitored on telemetry and remained in sinus tachycardia throughout her stay.
# IVDU:  Pt with long history of IVDU likely precipitating her endocarditits, HIV antibody negative at the OSH on [**2182-4-19**].
Hepatitis C antibody positive here with a viral load of 173,401.
Hepatitis B serologies showed immunity.
# abdominal pain:  The patient had an episode of abdominal pain, with exam notable for rebound tenderness.
# LE purpura s/p punch biopsy:  The patient had punch biopsy done on [**2182-5-7**].
