Laryngoscopy was performed revealing airway edema.
A CT scan of the chest and neck revealed a goiter with airway compression.
TSH was elevated at 7.13.
Neurology workup including EEG and CT was negative.
On [**2173-4-12**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy and partial sternotomy with right total and left subtotal thyroidectomy.
The pathology showed the patient to have papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with extrathyroidal invasion and nodal involvement.
At this time, the patient was found to have nosocomial pneumonia with sputum cultures positive for Acinetobacter, pan-resistant, as well as Enterobacter cloacae, pansensitive.
Postoperatively, chest x-ray showed that the patient had developed a right pneumothorax, displacing the right hemidiaphragm and the mediastinum, collapsing the right lung secondary to barotrauma versus the tracheal dilation procedure.
A right chest tube was placed as well as her central line was changed over wire and post chest tube chest x-ray showed marked improvement of the large right pneumothorax.
At this time, it was also noted that the patient had gram negative rods, specifically Acinetobacter in her blood cultures, and she was also placed on amikacin.
On [**4-17**], chest x-ray showed near resolution of her right pneumothorax.
Given her high grade of bacteremia, a CT sinus was recommended by Infectious Disease.
Her blood sugars were stable and the patient was off the insulin drip at this point.
On [**2173-4-20**], a chest CT was performed to evaluate for consolidation.
Her chest tube was removed and post pull chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumothorax.
Over the next few days, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was uneventful save for a fever spike in which blood cultures were negative, sputum cultures showed persistent Acinetobacter infection and urine cultures showed yeast.
On [**2173-4-27**], a bedside swallow was performed to evaluate for the patient's ability to tolerate p.o.
ENT was consulted for evaluation of possible vocal cord paralysis.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Papillary cancer with positive nodes status post sternotomy and partial right and total left thyroidectomy on [**2173-4-12**], status post rigid bronchoscopy and tumor debridement on [**2173-4-14**], status post open tracheostomy on [**2173-4-16**], status post bronchoscopy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement on [**2173-5-3**].
