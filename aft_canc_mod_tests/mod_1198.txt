MRI C SPINE [**2105-12-27**] IMPRESSION: Compared to the study of the previous day, there has been no  significant change in the extent or mass effect of the posterior spinal  epidural hematoma, extending from the C4 to the T3 level, with no evidence of new hemorrhage.
MRI C SPINE [**2105-12-26**] IMPRESSION: Since the previous MRI.
CT AB PELVIS [**2105-12-25**] IMPRESSION: Large left buttock hematoma, primarily intramuscular involving the left gluteus maximus muscle with a focal area of active extravasation just posterior to the left superior posterior iliac spine.
MRI T & C SPINE [**2105-12-25**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Additional findings upon availability of contrast enhanced study was entered at 5:27 PM.
CXR [**2106-1-11**]: The lungs are well expanded and clear without focal consolidation aside from minimal right basilar linear atelectasis.
ELBOW PLAIN FILM, LEFT  [**2106-1-11**]: No previous images.
This was his first significant bleed since his diagnosis, and he was subsequently started on recombinant factor VII infusions to prevent cord compression.
His hematoma remained stable on serial MRIs.
His neurologic exam was monitored daily throughout his hospitalization and remained normal.
Left Gluteus Maximus Bleed: His CT scan showed evidence of extravasation into left gluteus maximus muscle.
We were eventually able to discontinue infusions on [**2106-1-27**] without further bruising, or bleeding, and while maintaining a stable HCT.
His inhibitor levels were originally quite high, at 236.8.
EKG with sinus tachycardia.
He was started on atovaquone instead for PCP prophylaxis instead, and his WBC increased to 3.1 at the time of discharge.
Anemia: He presented with a HCT of 24 that dropped to 19 soon after admission.
His HCT remained stable at discharge.
Will need close follow up with hematology oncology for further management of his immunosuppression 2.
