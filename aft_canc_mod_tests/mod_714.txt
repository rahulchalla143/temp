PT 12.5, INR 1.1, PTT 28.4.
Sodium 141, potassium 3.7, chloride 100, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.6, glucose 79.
She had an ALT of 28, an AST of 27, alkaline phosphatase 60, total bilirubin 0.8, total protein 7.1, albumin 4.1.
Her output included an estimated blood loss of 800 ml, and urine output of 800 ml, for a total output of 1600 ml.
Her postoperative hematocrit was 26.2.

Vital signs were otherwise stable.
Urine output was adequate.
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were putting out between 60 and 170 cc.

Vital signs were stable.
At that time, a full fever workup, including chest x-ray, blood cultures, sputum cultures and urine cultures were ordered.
In addition, in association with this cough, she lowered her oxygen saturation on room air to 88 to 90.
The chest x-ray was suggestive for pneumonia with left basilar and right basilar infiltrates.
Her bilateral breast flaps continued to do very well, without any signs of infection.
The [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were patent and continued to drain minimal serosanguinous fluid.
Postoperative day five revealed a patient without complaints, who was afebrile, with a maximum temperature of 99.2, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.
Physical examination continued to be good, without evidence of infection and with viable flaps.
Her lung examination showed decreasing crackles in the left and right, improving from prior days.
Postoperative day six revealed the patient without complaints, was afebrile for 24 hours, saturating 92% on room air, with a continuing improvement in her respiratory examination, and no evidence of infection in any of her surgical sites.
