He underwent an EGD, which showed an esophageal varix and did not undergo any other procedure.
His PCP sent him to our hospital to get an outpatient MRI given that his pain has worsened significantly in his cervical spine, but given that he was feeling very weak and deteriorating fast he was taken to our ED.
In the ED his initial VS were: T 95.6 F, HR 107 BPM, BP 142/105 mmHg, RR 16 X', SpO2 97% RA.
His labs weere significant for WBC 9.5, HCT of 22 with PLT 216.
His INR was 1.1 with PTT of 25.
Sodium was 117, K 4.6, Cl 82, AG 10, UA was negative, BC were drawn.
BUN 28, cr 0.6.
He was with HR in 90s and BP in the 90s throught most of his ED stay.
His repeat HCT came back as 20 with Na of 117.
GI was consulted, but felt that his neck issues and hyponatremia were more improtant than GIB and therefore scope was partially contraindicated in this scenario and recommended correction of hyponatremia and further evaluation of his spine.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] W &W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-5-9**] 5:32 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-5-10**] 1:56 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
However, given the presence of a bony lesion within a recent cervical spine study, a followup chest examination should be obtained following resolution of the pneumonia to rule out an underlying mass.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-5-10**] 2:19 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2174-5-11**] at 9:44:22 AM      FINAL Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Portable TEE (Complete) Done [**2174-5-12**] at 2:40:00 PM      FINAL No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
BONE SCAN Study Date of [**2174-5-13**] Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior projections showing multifocal patchy increased tracer uptake in both proximal and distal medial femoral metadiaphysis, in both humeri, the calvarium, the spine, and diffusely in multiple bilateral ribs, the left scapula and claviculae, concerning for diffuse metastatic disease.
The proximal femoral shafts which show relatively prominent increased activity may offer a biopsy site, but there are many alternatives.
BONE MARROW Biopsy final results pending  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a very nice 54 YO gentleman with CAD s/p MI and h/o endocarditis s/p bioprosthetic AVR with recent history of GIB requiring 6 RBC units comes to the emergency room with fatigue and progressive failure to thrive at home [**1-26**] diffuse bone lesions (malignancy of unknown primary), pneumonia, GI bleed, hyponatremia.
MRI was done of spine which showed diffuse lesions appearing to be malignant, along with pathologic fracture at T12.
Bone scan was done for further evaluation, and showed diffuse bone lesions through out the body.
No lesions on CT torso to suggest a primary malignancy.
Also on the differential for bone pain andlesions, along with weight loss, was endocarditis which was ruled out by TEE.
CXR with infitlrate in LLL and LUL suggesting multifocal PNA.
Bronchoscopy was done x 3 for diagnosis and the final time for potential symptomatic relief prior to extubation for comfort, above.
Sputum showed mixed flora with GPC and GNR.
Upper GI Bleed - Hct of 22 on admission that continued to drop with positive NG lavage.
GI team was consulted and EGD was done which showed erosions in linear esophagus and GE junction, otherwise normal EGD to third part of duodenum.
As volume status improved, urine lytes reassessed and suggested increased secretion of ADH, possibly SIADH in setting of malignancy vs pain.
RUQ u/s was done which showed patent veins.
Further workup not pursued given comfort measures.
