Chest pain: Pt complained of chest pressure the night prior to admission that was non radiating.
CXR showed cardiomegaly, and consideration was given to CHF also showed retrocardiac opacity.

Patient's INR goal is [**2-20**] and was supratherapeutic given recently started on ciprofloxacin at ECF.
Acute blood loss Anemia/ Bright red blood per rectum: Hct 28.8 today, baseline 31-33, Fe studies WNL in summer [**2164**].
Hematocrit trended down and negative hemolysis labs.
History of PEs: Towards the end of her hospitalization, pt's INR goal was changed from [**2-20**] (on admission) to [**1-22**] (per her PCP) given her rectal bleeding.
She will continue to require adjustment of her coumadin dosing to maintain her INR at goal of [**1-22**] (should be maintained closer to 3).
