Additionally the suture material around the side to side bowel anastamosis more proximally is  different in configuration to the prior CT examination though the area is incompletely evaluated due to the lack of IV contrast.
Repeat CT (after red [**Doctor First Name **] tube placed) 1.
Large parastomal mass, several omental metastases, and retroperitoneal/pararectal lymphadenopathy, though unchanged compared to CT from earlier today, are new compared to the [**3-26**], [**2196**] study.
Asymmetric subcutaneous edema involving the visualized portion of the proximal left thigh, increased compared to the prior study from [**2196-3-26**], with no (non-contrast) CT evidence of DVT.
CT head did not show evidence of metastases.
#Acute renal failure, postrenal: Necrotic tumor next to ileal conduit causing obstruction, obstruction as evidenced by b/l hydronephrosis, baseline Cr is 0.9.
After red [**Doctor First Name **] cath placed into ileal conduit, repeat CT showed mild improvement of hydronephrosis.
#Leukocytosis: white count elevated >19 and persistent while on ciprofloxacin.
Urine culture eventually grew out Enterococcus, but only 10k-100k colonies, and the patient did not have symptoms of sepsis.
