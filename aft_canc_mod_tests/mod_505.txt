CT Head [**2146-9-7**]: right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild mass effect and leftward shift of midline structures.
MRI can be obtained for further evaluation.
MRI Head [**2146-9-7**]:  Mild-to-moderate-sized area of negative susceptibility in the right capsuloganglionic region, correlating with the previously noted area of hemorrhage, measuring approximately 1.4 x 2.2 cm, with mild-to-moderate amount of surrounding edema.
CT Head [**2146-9-8**]: Unchanged right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage adjacent to the capsuloganglionic region.
CT L-Spine: No fracture involving the lumbar spine.
see subsequent MRI which shows moderate - severe canal stenosis, crowding of the roots of cauda and impingement on L4 and L5 nerves on both sides.
However, the significance of this finding is uncertain as there is no definite fracture on the prior CT C-spine study.
MRI T and L-spine: IMPRESSION: 1.
Please see the details on prior CT studies.
A few T2 hyperintense foci in the right side of pelvis on the localizing images can be better assessed with pelvic ultrasound.
She was continued on her home medications for her comorbidities (including gout), and her blood pressure was kept below SBP 160 with the help of intravenous agents.
In our hands on Day 1, she remained intubated and sedated so as to achieve formal MR imaging of her brain and C-spine so as to rule out soft tissue injury of the cervical spine.
A follow up NCHCT showed no evidence of enlarging bleed, and there was no midline shift.
With the assistance of the orthopedic spine service and the general surgery team, her spine precautions were officially cleared and she was extubated on [**9-10**].
Her physical examination did show some left sided weakness that has remained, but improved throughout her hospitalization.
Her brain MRI showed changes consistent with her known IPH on the right basal ganglia, no obvious evidence of metastatic lesion was noted, although this is difficult to tell in the acute period.
She will need to schedule an outpatient repeat MRI with contrast in 6 weeks (phone number in the discharge paperwork).
PENDING LABS: Blood Culture x2 [**2146-9-8**]  TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: Patient will need her baby aspirin restarted on [**9-16**] (10 days s/p bleed).
She will need to be monitored for changes in her neurological exam after this is started.
Lidoderm 5 %(700 mg/patch) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Sig: One (1)  Topical once a day as needed for pain: 12hrs on, 12 hrs off in given 24 hr period.
11. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain, temp >100.4.
While here you were evaluated with an MRI and it was shown that your bleed remained stable.
Followup Instructions: Please call Phone: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 6713**] to set up an appointment to have a brain MRI in 6 weeks (beginning of Novemeber).
