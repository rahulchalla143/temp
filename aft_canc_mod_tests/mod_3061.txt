Blood work at the time of the admission revealed leukocytosis and anemia.
A chest x-ray allegedly showed a left upper lobe lesion, and this was confirmed on chest CT.
Notation was made on abdominal and pelvic CT of splenomegaly and a question of prostate cancer.
The patient was evaluated by pulmonary, a bronchoscopy for biopsy was attempted, but unsuccessful according to the patient.
On [**2103-10-2**], the patient underwent a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate at the [**Hospital3 19345**].

The patient's white blood cell count allegedly declined with the addition of Hydrea to 19,000.
LUNGS: are clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.

*   Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo male with CMML admitted from clinic with neutropenic fever after blood transfusion.
This was first noted on CT scan [**6-7**].
Potential etiologies included his underlying CMML vs infectious (+AFB fungemia) vs embolic/thrombotic (DIC vs HIT).
Labs were not consistent with DIC, with fibrinogen greater than 200.
His urine culture was negative.
CXR was also negative for infiltrate.
KUB and CT of the abdomen revealed changes consistent with c.diff infection.
On [**6-7**] the CT scan of the abdomen was repeated because the patient had worsening of his abdominal exam and showed unchanged appearance of the colon.
His white count recovered on [**6-7**] but he remained transfusion dependent for plts and pRBCs.
EKG w/o signs of R heart strain.
