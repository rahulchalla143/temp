COMPARISONS: Chest CT dated [**2104-1-4**].
Limited images of the chest were obtained with the patient in the left posterior oblique position for localization purposes only.
Using CT guidance and trocar technique, a 10 French catheter was inserted directly into the collection and approximately 35 cc of purulent hemorrhagic fluid was aspirated, a portion of which was sent to microbiology.
Limited post-procedure images revealed slight interval decrease in the collection size.
He underwent CT guided drainage of lung abscess.
At the time of the procedure, frozen section pathology of the lung and pericardium revealed stage IV squamous disease.
