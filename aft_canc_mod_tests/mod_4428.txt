She went to see her PCP who decided to do a CT scan of her head, as she is on coumadin and was found to have bilateral cerebellar lesions.

MRI Head [**9-18**]: FINDINGS: There is extensive edema identified in the cerebellar hemisphere with two discrete mass lesions identified One mass lesion is seen in the midline and extending to the right cerebellar hemisphere measuring approximately 4 x 3 cm with central area of low signal indicating blood products.
The examination was performed with fiduciary markers for preoperative planning.
LENIS [**9-18**]: FINDINGS: In the right lower extremity, isoechoic material is seen within the right common femoral vein, which is non compressible.
Color Doppler analysis reveals only trace flow in the popliteal vein and common femoral veins, with no observable flow in the superficial femoral vein.
CT Torso [**9-19**]: FINDINGS: There is a large necrotic mass in the right lower lung.
Mediastinal node enlargement includes right paratracheal 6.8 mm and prevascular 9 mm.
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: There is a 22 x 36 mm poorly defined area of low attenuation in the periphery of the right lobe of the liver at the junction of segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] and IVb (3.44) near the ligamentum teres, is not seen on the non-contrast or delayed images and there is no contour bulging.
Cardiac Echo [**9-19**]: There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
MRI Head [**9-20**](post-op): FINDINGS: There is a bilateral suboccipital craniectomy, as seen on the preceding CT scan, and a small extra-axial fluid collection deep to the craniectomy defect.
There is no definite evidence of mass- like contrast enhancement outside of the blood products to suggest residual tumor.
There is a small focus of slow diffusion (image 18 of series 8 and series 9), in the left anterior corpus collosum, lateral to the ventriculostomy catheter.
There is a small subdural collection along the anterior right frontal convexity and the right anterior falx, also new since the pre-operative study, which could be related to the interim ventriculostomy placement.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2173-9-23**] FINDINGS: Again noted are changes from a suboccipital craniectomy with post-operative changes in the cerebellum.
Recommend MRI for further evaluation.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2173-9-23**] Status post removal of external ventricular drain, no significant change compared to the prior study.
Post-resection MRI revealed complete mass resection, however a small area of decreased diffusion along the corpous collosum was noted.
CT Torso was also obtained, and identified both lung and liver lesions.
The EVD was clamped on [**9-22**] and a repeat CT scan showed stable ventricular size the morning of [**9-23**].
The drain was removed that afternoon and another CT scan revealed no hemorrhage after drain removal.
