Subsequently on [**7-26**], he had a fall at home leading to a right ACL tear, hemarthrosis, ecchymoses, hypotension, and was transferred to [**Hospital6 48646**].
He was also noted to be thrombocytopenic, hyponatremic, and with liver failure with an alkaline phosphatase of 1300, total bilirubin of 18.5, ALT of 1170, and AST of 1375.
He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 96.7, blood pressure 80/60, heart rate of 98, and 90% on 6 liters.
Abdominal examination is nontender and nondistended.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 7.7, hematocrit 34.5, platelets 57.
Sodium 121, potassium 3.9, chloride 85, CO2 24, BUN 28, creatinine 0.7, glucose 128.
PT 12.8, PTT 25.5.
Urinalysis revealed trace protein, otherwise within normal limits.
ALT 1259, AST 1107, LDH 81, alkaline phosphatase 1582, calcium 7.9, magnesium 1.9, phosphorus 3.0.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient's potential hepatotoxic medications were on hold and his liver function tests trended downwards towards normal limits.
A GI consult was obtained and deferred liver biopsy at this time.
and a transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, elongated left atrium, trace AR, 1+ MR with small pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
A bronchoscopy was performed on hospital day #10, which revealed frothy secretions in his left and right lower lobes.
A BAL was performed on the right middle lobe and lingula and was therefore subsequently sent for culture.
A CTA of the chest was performed to rule out recurrent pulmonary embolism.
This CTA revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, interval development of bilateral pleural effusions, and was then started on high dosed steroids.
