The patient had a KUB of his abdomen on [**2179-11-11**] which showed no evidence of an IVC filter.
Also noted on [**2179-11-2**] was a bedside swallow study which showed no signs of aspiration and functional oral and pharyngeal swallowing.
On [**2179-10-24**] a bronchoscopy was performed which allowed clear visualization and showed no evidence of intratracheal or intrapulmonary injury.
EGD was also performed; and the stomach, esophagus and oropharynx were clearly visualized without any evidence of hemorrhage or luminal compromise.
Chest tube output was monitored.
The patient remained ventilated on assist control 40% with a PEEP of 12.
The patient's blood pressure was controlled with a wide range of medications, including enalapril.
Pupils were equal and reactive to light and accommodation, sluggish, 2- to 3-mm bilaterally, responded to pain and light touch.
A volar splint was applied on [**2179-10-25**] and the arterial line was moved from right to his left upper extremity secondary to injury.
On [**2179-10-25**] ortho spine was consulted; and MRI was recommended to assess further damage to the T9-T10 injury.
MRI was obtained and studies were as above.
EKG on left and right sides were also performed and showed right bundle branch block.
Cardiac enzymes were sent.
On [**2179-10-26**] a sputum culture showed 3+ gram-positive cocci and 2+ gram-positive rods.
Chest x-rays were monitored throughout course of stay in ICU.
A chest x-ray was done, and the chest tube was placed to water seal on a.m. rounds, and the patient was suctioned for copious thick yellow secretions.
A chest x-ray was done.
Chest x-ray showed no changes.
Breath sounds were faint.
An easy cap was placed on endotracheal tube without color change, which was verified by the RN.
A chest x-ray was done and ABGs were sent.
Chest x-ray was clear, and a CTA of the chest was ordered once the patient was stable.
His EKG during this time showed sinus tachycardia, and no significant changes from prior EKG.
Cardiac enzymes were pending, which ended up eventually proving to be negative, and a CTA was ordered.
The CTA showed a large pulmonary embolism as noted above in diagnostic studies section.
MGA's records were obtained, and the patient was recommended to have the MRI which showed a T9-T10 anterior longitudinal ligament injury, and TLSO was recommended.
On [**2179-10-28**] after the pulmonary embolism was noted, the patient was started on heparin GTT and monitored with serial PT and PTT checks for treatment for pulmonary embolism.
Blood sugars were continued to be checked as above.
Bronchoscopy was performed on [**2179-10-29**]; and the patient was suctioned with copious amounts of thick yellow suctioned.
Breath sounds were coarse bilaterally.
Multiple chest x-rays were taken.
On [**2179-10-30**] Levaquin was restarted after a sputum culture sent when the patient spiked a temperature to 101.
CT was placed to water seal.
On [**2179-11-1**] secondary to large doses of heparin being used to control the patient's PTT, heparin drip was turned off and argatroban was started with a goal PTT of 50 to 70 and were monitored q.6h..
The patient's blood pressure would increase to 200 to 220 systolic whenever was agitated.
Pulmonary toilet was maintained, and sputum continued to drain when the patient was turned from side-to-side.
A speech and swallow eval was done.
Labs were drawn to work up for hypercoagulable state including protein C/protein S anticoagulant, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, IgG and IgM.
These studies were negative and/or within normal limits.
Also, outpatient studies were done for prothrombin [**Known lastname 1105**] gene mutation in addition to factor V Leiden; which were pending upon discharge.
The patient continued to improve at this point, and INR was managed with Coumadin 5 to 10 mg daily until the patient's discharge.
On [**2179-11-15**] INR was 2.2 as the patient had stabilized on 7.5 mg of Coumadin.
The patient remained afebrile, vital signs stable after transfer to the floor.
An ultrasound and KUB ultrasound of his femoral veins showed patent vessels.
The patient will need to have his INR checked on Thursday, [**11-18**]; a prescription has been provided to the patient to present to a hospital for outpatient blood draws.
The patient is to call [**Last Name (un) **] at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 17484**] if his fingerstick's run over 350 mg/dL.
If his fingerstick's were below 60 the patient was instructed to drink a full glass of [**Location (un) 2452**] juice and then recheck his fingerstick's.
Magnesium hydroxide 4 mg/5 mL suspension was given p.o.
Albuterol 90 mcg 2 puffs 4 times a day as needed for     shortness of breath or wheezing was given.
NOTE:  Please note, the patient was also given a script for outpatient lab work for PT and INR 1 to 2 times per week.
If you are still in [**State 350**] you should call to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1352**], orthopaedic spinal surgeon; ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 68270**] for an appointment.
