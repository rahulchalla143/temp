Patient's presenting EKG showed ST elevations in the inferior leads and symptoms are initially concerning for unstable angina/ ACS.
Her troponin was noted to be elevated to 0.13 and cardiology at BIDN advised transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] as she was a potential candidate for cardiac catheterization.
CT head was negative for mass or bleed and the patient was started on a heparin drip and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
At the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were 99 86 139/71 20 97% 4LNC.
A chest X-ray was repeated in the ED and revealed no evidence of congestive heart failure and right-sided calcified pleural plaques.
Repeat labs revealed troponin 0.13, CKMB 7 and WBC of 12.4 with 80% PMNs.
Vitals on transfer were 98.6 136/76 81 98% 2LNC.

Echocardiogram showed mildly dilated RV with normal biventricular function.
Chest CTA at [**Hospital1 **]-N showed multiple nodules in liver so CT A/P was pursued to work up possible malignancy as source of PE.
CT A/P showed necrotic pancreatic tail mass and "numerous hypodense lesions with peripheral arterial enhancement most consistent with metastases" in the liver.
Pt discussed options with social work and palliative care and decided not to pursue any further work-up or treatment and prefers not to discuss results any further.
Follow up troponin at [**Hospital1 18**] at 1PM was 0.13 with CKMB or 7, which was peak level after which it trended down.
Blood pressure normotensive on admission so antihypertensives were initially held.
BP trended up so lisinopril and felodipine were added back and lisinopril was increased to 40mg po daily.
CODE: Full (confirmed with patient) TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1. continue lovenox for PE treatment 2. if begins to develop symptoms such as abdominal pain, pt should be encouraged to speak with PCP about pain control and asked if she would like to revisit malignancy work up or treatment 3. follow up BP on new regimen  Medications on Admission: - Atenolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] - [**2187-12-10**] - Felodipine ER 10mg daily - [**2187-10-19**] - may not be taking - Lisinopril 30mg daily - [**2187-11-28**] - Flonase 50mcg nasal spray 2 puffs each nostril once daily - [**12-10**] - preservision daily  Discharge Medications: 1. labetalol 200 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Residence - [**University/College **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: pulmonary embolism bilateral deep vein thrombosis necrotic pancreatic tail mass with multiple liver nodules on CT  Secondary Diagnoses: hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
While you were here you had a CT to figure out the source of your clots.
