Cholangiogram - IMPRESSION:  1.
Pullback cholangiogram demonstrates biliary leak at the posterior and inferior aspect of the right hepatic lobe with extravasation of contrast into the abdominal cavity.
An ultrasound of the abdomen is recommended in order to determine if there is any abdominal collections in the right upper quadrant.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Cholangiogram via existing catheter demonstrates decompressed intrahepatic ducts and good drainage of contrast through the catheter into the duodenum.
10 cc of bile were sent for culture analysis.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
The hematocrit remained stable thereafter.
Cholangigram showed a bile leak.
Blood culures remained negative at the time of discharge.
SIADH - Na maintained in the mid-120's with 1 lit water restriction/day.
