EMS was activated who transported the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
However, after non-contrast head CT was performed, Mr. [**Known lastname 7474**] became right sided hemiparetic with right facial droop and was found to be aphasic.
A repeat NIHSS was measured at 15.
He was taken back to the scanner and a CT perfusion / angiogram were performed which identified patent vessels, but increased cerebral blood volume in the left hemisphere.
Past Medical History: - Pituitary Adenoma diagnosed in [**2126**], initially measuring 3.3 cm with extension into the left cavernous sinus with hypercortisolism and symmetric proximal muscle weakness status post resections in [**2127**]/[**2132**] and fractional radiotherapy - in [**2127**] (52.2 [**Doctor Last Name **]), and [**6-/2132**] (17 [**Doctor Last Name **]); now medically managed on ketoconazole, - Multiple episodes of Pneumonia in [**2132**] - Hypertension - Hypokalemia - Developmental Disability v. Highly Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder   Social History: No recent tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use (distant tobacco and alcohol use).

- Gait and Coordination were not assessed  ******************* EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE  Vitals: T: 97.6 P:80  R: 22  BP: 133/87 General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.

Considerations favor an entity such as a chordoma, though lesions of sellar origin, or a sinus malignancy may have a similar appearance.
CTA HEAD WITH & WITHOUT CONTRAST & RECONSTRUCTION - [**2132-7-29**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT perfusion suggests the possibility of subtle ischemia in the left parietal lobe, corresponding to area of hypodensity on the preceding head CT. No evidence for an infarct.

Continuous EEG monitoring was also begun.
On repeat evaluation, the patient had just had a conversation with his cousin, was answering appropriately and noted no complaints except a sore throat likely secondary to irritation from the endotracheal tube.
Subsequent evaluation of Mr. [**Known lastname 7474**] revealed improving strength in his right upper and lower extremities, where upon discharge he was found to have equal strength bilaterally in his upper and lower extremities, with only mild deficits in arm extension.
Cardiovascular/Pulmonary:  After intubation, the patient was maintained over the course of the next two days on pressure support of 5mmHg, 5 of PEEP, and 50% FiO2 with respiratory rates between [**12-23**].
On these settings, Mr. [**Known lastname 7474**] [**Last Name (Titles) 56018**] was measured 99-100% oxygen saturation over the course of [**8-5**].
On the evening of [**8-5**], the patient became hypotensive to the high-80 systolic blood pressures.
A bolus of 1.5 liters of normal saline was administered, and over the course of the next 2-3 hours, the patient returned to normotensive with systolic blood pressures between 100-110.
Urology was consulted who on evaluation were immediately able to reduce the foreskin about the glans.
Of note, the complete blood count reported a pan-measure drop, which likely suggested a dilutional phenomenon.
Subsequent complete blood counts showed increased hemoglobin.
