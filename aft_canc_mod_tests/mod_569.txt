Brief Hospital Course: 62 year old HIV negative man who presented with mental status changes and was found on head MRI to have a right parietal/occipital biopsy-confirmed.
His course was complicated by an ileus, hypoxia, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, as well and a small GI bleed.
Head CT was done here on admission and was negative.
Head MRI on [**2195-11-24**] showed a T2 signal abnormality and associated enhancement within the white matter and brain stem.
Lumbar puncture on [**11-25**] showed white blood cells but no malignant cells on cytology.
CSF cultures were negative.
A few days after admission, his neuro exam showed increased disorientation and appearance of left-sided neglect indicative of progression of disease.
A staging torso CT w/contrast on [**11-25**] was negative for masses or lymphadenopathy.
Brain open biopsy performed [**2195-11-27**] confirmed lymphoma.
Methotrexate levels were followed every day.
Additionally, urine pH was tested q4 hours.
If urine pH was less than that, pt received sodium bicarb IV.
Pt was d/cd when methotrexate levels were <0.3 on [**2195-12-12**].
Because of this, a repeat MRI was done [**2195-12-11**].
MRI that day showed that periventricular CNS lymphoma lesions have resolved and increased edema in that area.
Distended bowel loops were noted on chest X-ray on [**2195-11-30**] and colonic ileus confirmed by KUB [**2195-12-1**].
Hct was stable throughout.
Chest X-ray was suggestive of pulmonary edema; however, the patient's atelectasis and low lung volumes secondary to colonic ileus were contributing to decreased oxygenation.
CTA on [**2195-12-2**] was negative for PE and showed atelectasis.
Urine lytes showed low Urine sodium and high Osms, suggesting that pt was intravascularly depleted.
ROMI: On [**2195-11-30**], the patient had HTN urgency w/strain pattern on ECG and ST depressions <1mm in the anterolateral leads.
Administration of IV metoprolol 5 mg reduced blood pressure and resulted in baseline appearance on repeat ECG.
Cardiac enzymes [**2195-11-30**] to [**2195-12-1**] were negative x 3.
ARF:  Pt with rising creatinine throughout beginning of admission to 3.5 high on [**2195-12-5**].
Additionally, pt received contrast for CT scan ([**2195-12-2**]) which is nephrotoxic.
Phos-lo was discontinued once phosphate levels were normal.
Hypertension:  Blood pressure was controlled as an outpatient on Vasotec.
After pt came back to the floor, his BP started to slowly rise without medication.
Electrolytes were checked and repleted as necessary.
Enoxaparin Sodium 40 mg/0.4mL Syringe Sig: One (1) Subcutaneous Q24H (every 24 hours).
Followup Instructions: -You should have your blood work drawn on Tuesday at your local PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] should have the labs faxed to Dr.[**Name (NI) 6767**] office (you have the fax number); his office number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1844**].
