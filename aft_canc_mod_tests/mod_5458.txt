Due to presentation of respiratory difficulty, cough and high fever, pulmonary infectious processes such as bacterial pneumonia, (especially w/ encapsulated organisms like strep pneumo) PCP pneumonia or influenza are highly likely, or his pulmonary infiltrates seen on CXR could be due to inflammatory vascular leak causing an ARDS type picture.
On day of admission [**12-4**], patient was febrile to 104, had WBC of 310, with HR in 150s-160s.
He developed increased work of breathing and went into atrial fibrillation with heart rate in the 160s, refractory to low-dose diltiazem, so amiodarone drip was started.
Patient's blood pressures continued to drop with systolic pressures in the 70s and 80s, so levophed was initiated, and titrated til it was at maximum dose.
Serial arterial blood gasses were measured and patient was profoundly acidotic, with mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis having pH of 7.19.
His repeat WBC count trended upward to 462.
Repeat ABGs showed no improvement.
Patient was given multiple fluid boluses over night with very little effect on blood pressure and urine output.
Patient's urine output continued to worsen, and by the morning of [**12-5**], his fluid balance was 13 liters positive.
Blood cultures returned positive for gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters, and patient's vancomycin was changed to linezolid as per ID recommendations, for better VRE coverage.
ABG on [**12-5**] 7.13/ 45/ 64/ 16/ -14 and lactate was 5.1 .
Blood cultures were later shown to grow staph aureus.
