she had blood/urine cultures drawn, was given Ertapenem and tylenol, as well as 1 unit of Platelets.
Her consolidation treatment involved high dose araC times 3 cycles, with her last treatment  in [**2113-3-11**].
She achieved a remission (marrow biopsy on [**2112-12-20**]), but was readmitted in [**7-16**] for relapse.
The bone marrow biopsy was repeated 4 days later revealed 27% blasts in the aspirate and CD34+ blasts in the core (which was only 10% cellular in total).

Chest radiograph appearance accounted for by atelectasis at both lung bases.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2114-5-28**] compared to [**2114-5-22**]: There has been interval decrease in size of hypodensity in segment VIII of the liver, which currently measures roughly 19 x 16 mm, decreased from previous exam when it measured 40 x 36 mm.
There is a small pericardial effusion.Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-12-20**], estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher and tricuspid regurgitation is now much more prominent.

CT chest revealed a hypodensity in segment 8 of the liver.
U/A was negative, CT chest was negative for pneumonia.
She underwent CT guided biopsy of the liver lesion.
No fungus was cultured, but pathology stains were positive for fungus.
The biopsy was complicated by a small R apical pneumothroax, which resolved spontaneously.
CT scan revealed an improvement in the size of the abscess 5 days after the biopsy.
Her O2 requirement decreased but did not resolve right away.
ECHO of her heart revealed to vegetations; however, her valvular disease was found to be worse with preserved ejection fraction.
WBC was rising, and pt has high % of blasts (>80) on peripheral smear.
She was continued on hydroxyurea 1 gm twice a day, but her white blood cell count remained above 10,000.
On discharge her white blood cell count was 13.8 and falling.
