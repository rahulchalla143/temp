IMAGING/STUDIES: PET SCAN [**2132-1-11**]: IMPRESSION: Remarkably extensive focal FDG-avid lesions, predominantly in the musculature throughout the head, neck, and torso, but note should be made of FDG-avid lesions in the brain, bilateral adrenals, bone, and peritoneum.
MRI HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2132-1-13**]: FINDINGS: There is a hemorrhagic mass measuring 2.2 x 2.4 cm in the right cerebellum with a small satellite nodule adjacent to it, compatible with metastatic disease.
R GLUTEAL BIOPSY PATHOLOGY: Soft tissue, right gluteus, biopsy (A): .
CXR [**2132-1-17**]: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of superior mediastinal mass, no cardiac enlargement, no pulmonary congestion, and no acute pulmonary infiltrates on this preoperative chest examination .
Specimen labeled "right cerebellar tumor" (including frozen section and smear preparation" (A-B):      METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, SEE NOTE.
Overall, the morphologic and immunohistochemical characteristics are consistent with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of gastrointestinal origin.
Slides will be referred to GI pathology for consultation and an addendum will be issues.
MRI HEAD [**2132-1-18**]: IMPRESSION: Cerebellar metastatic lesions involving both cerebellar hemispheres, right greater than left side as described above, unchanged from prior study.
This study was performed for surgical planning.
CT HEAD [**2132-1-18**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of large hemorrhage.
MRI HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2132-1-19**]: IMPRESSION: Since the previous study, patient has undergone resection of right-sided cerebellar lesion.
Blood products and edema are seen.
CXR [**2132-1-22**]: PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to [**2132-1-17**].
TISSUE PATHOLOGY FROM GE JUNCTION MASS SENT FROM [**Hospital1 **] FOR REVIEW: Gastroesophageal junction, biopsy (2 consult slides labeled S12-43, procedure date [**2132-1-8**], [**Hospital6 3105**], [**Hospital1 487**], MA):  Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, at least intramucosal; no submucosal tissue present for evaluation.
BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM [**2132-1-25**] Distal esophageal stricture with holdup of the passage of contrast; however, this is patent to both thin and thick barium with some delay, with the residual contrast cleared by drinking water.
DISCHARGE LABS: [**2132-1-26**] 08:10AM BLOOD WBC-39.9* RBC-3.71* Hgb-11.9* Hct-34.2* MCV-92 MCH-32.1* MCHC-34.8 RDW-13.7 Plt Ct-114* [**2132-1-26**] 08:10AM BLOOD Glucose-99 UreaN-28* Creat-1.0 Na-130* K-4.7 Cl-98 HCO3-25 AnGap-12 [**2132-1-26**] 08:10AM BLOOD Calcium-7.8* Phos-3.1 Mg-2.3  Brief Hospital Course: 42 y/o male transferred from LGH for evaluation of a 3.8 x 5.0 cm mass at the GE junction, s/p OSH EGD and biopsy of the mass with report of low grade adenocarcinoma, with diffusely metastatic disease on PET including musculature, bones, lungs, cardiac, adrenal as well as CNS metastases, now s/p posterior craniotomy for resection R cerebellar mass, transferred to OMED for consideration of XRT and/or chemotherapy for poorly differentiated tumor of upper gastrointestinal origin.
BRIEF HISTORY PRIOR TO TRANSFER TO OMED: 42 y/o male with a 30+ pk year smoking history who was transferred from [**Hospital6 3105**] and admitted to the thoracic surgery service on [**2132-1-9**] for evaluation of a 3-4 cm mass at the GE junction.
CT abd/pelvis [**2132-1-7**] revealed a 3.8 X 5.0 cm soft tissue mass at GE junction as well as diffuse soft tissue deposits and adrenal nodules.
A PEG was placed [**2132-1-11**] due to ongoing inability to tolerate PO.
A PET CT on [**2132-1-11**] showed extensive, diffuse FDG-avid lesions, predominantly in the musculature throughout the head, neck, and torso but also in the bone and brain.
Per discussion with neurosurgery, patient was cleared for radiation to the brain as of POD 5 (currently POD #5) based on results of post-op MRI and CT head.
He was able to tolerate PO and take his pills, an esophogram study was performed which did show backing up of contrast in the esophagus but it was able to pass through.
Patient's biopsy results from mass at LGH was requested and sent here for further review to assist with onc treatment and planning.
Repeat MRI/CT did not show hydrocephalus, c/w with postop changes, no hemorrhage.
His cerebellar biopsy was consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
CXR PA and lateral was obtained which did show concern for L lingula infiltrate, but as the patient clinically did not demonstrate signs of PNA we opted not to start a course of antibiotics.
A HIT AB test was sent and was positive, with and Optical Density of 2.606.

The biopsy was shown to be a cancer, with metastasis to your brain.
You had a brain biopsy and the biopsy was consistent with the cancer in your esophagus.
You have follow up scheduled below with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1852**] and with the Rad/Onc team for further evaluation and treatment.
