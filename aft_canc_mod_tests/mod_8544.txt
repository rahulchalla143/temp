An abdominal CT showed a 28 x 53 mm mass in the body and tail of the pancreatic as well as multiple hepatic lesions, the largest measuring 19 x 21 mm, peritoneal implants, and omental caking.
She underwent diagnostic paracentesis on [**2191-3-28**] with left groin lymph node biopsy.
Cytology of the peritoneal fluid was positive for adenocarcinoma, and the left groin biopsy showed metastatic adenocarcinoma staining positive for CK7, CK20, and CEA, negative for mammoglobin and GCDFP.
She also underwent bone scan, which showed likely metastases in T6-T7 vertebral bodies.
The family reports very poor urine output and no bowel movements since Sunday.
Her pain has been minimally controlled and is focussed in the back and right chest area.
In the ED, initial T 97.3, HR 102, BP 115/56, RR 24, 92% on NRB.
Breast cancer: - Left breast cancer diagnosed in [**2162**] treated with mastectomy.
Physical Exam: Vitals - BP 119/57, HR 90, 98%.

Blood Cx NGTD .
ECG #1 ([**2191-4-8**]) - Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2191-3-25**] the rate has increased.
ECG #2 ([**2191-4-8**]) - Sinus tachycardia.
V/Q Scan ([**2191-4-8**]) - INTERPRETATION: Ventilation images of the lungs were obtained in 8 views following the administration of 43.5mCi of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m DTPA aerosol.
Perfusion images in the same 8 views were obtained following the intravenous administration of 5.8mCi of Tc-99m MAA.
The results were compared with the chest x-ray done [**2191-4-8**].
There is mild decreased activity in the posterior perfusion and ventilation images of the right lung that likely corresponds to atelectasis/ effusion on the chest x-ray.
IMPRESSION: Mild decreased activity in the right lung on posterior views likely corresponds to the effusion on the chest x-ray.
Abdomen X-ray ([**2191-4-8**]) - FINDINGS: There are some gas filled loops of centrally positioned large bowel.
CXR ([**2191-4-8**]) - FINDINGS: There are bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
CT Head ([**2191-4-8**]) - FINDINGS: No acute hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or evidence of major territorial infarct is apparent.
CT Abdomen / Pelvis ([**2191-4-8**]) - CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are small-to-moderate pleural effusions bilaterally with associated relaxation atelectasis, increased from previous.
Evaluation of intra-abdominal and intrapelvic organs is quite limited given lack of intravenous contrast administration and moderate-to-large amount of ascites within the abdomen.
The gallbladder, spleen, and visualized large and small bowel appear within normal limits.
Given lack of IV contrast administration, the exact boundaries of the pancreatic mass within the body and tail is difficult to adequately measure; however, it appears grossly unchanged.
Limited evaluation given lack of intravenous contrast and moderate-to-large amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
She was admitted to the MICU, where goals of care were addressed with the patient and the family with regards to her extensively-metastatic pancreatic cancer, acute renal failure, and altered mental status.
