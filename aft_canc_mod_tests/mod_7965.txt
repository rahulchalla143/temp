The patient was noted to have ST elevations with her rapid rate which cleared when her rate was adequately controlled with beta-blockers.
Echo [**5-/2171**] with an EF of 40 to 45% 3.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 97.8, blood pressure 123/77, heart rate in the 60 sating at 98% on 40% FIO2 with a PEEP of 5.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally and superiorly.
She was alert and oriented times three and her neurological exam was grossly nonfocal.
LABORATORY:  On admission initial white count 202, hematocrit 38.1, platelets 351, sodium 141, potassium 5.0, chloride 104, bicarbonate 24, BUN 52, creatinine 1.5.
Glucose 242.
CK 66, troponin I less then 0.3.
Calcium 9.4, magnesium 2.3, phosphorus 4.7.
Urinalysis with 30 protein, 3 to 5 red blood cells, 0 to 2 white blood cells.
Arterial blood gases:  7.27/54/281 on 40% O2, PEEP of 5, Tidal volumes of 500.
Chest x-ray showing congestive heart failure without infiltrates.
Atrial flutter at 104, no Q-waves 2, [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations in V1 through V3.
ST depressions V4 through V6, 1 and L. 2.
Initially her rate which was very rapid and probably precipitated her decompensation was controlled with beta-blockers.
However, through the rest of her admission her rate remained well controlled without the use of beta-blockers.
Congestive heart failure that she initially suffered secondary to her rapid rate was thought to be from flash pulmonary edema, responded well to diuresis at the time of this dictation she is sating well on room air and able to ambulate comfortably without desaturation.
Her chronic renal insufficiency was stable with a creatinine of 1.5 which was close to her baseline.
Her initial white count was elevated over 200 however, this subsequently declined to less than 100 with no interventions.
It was thought this initial laboratory was actually spurious and that her white count was below 100 which is near her baseline.
At the time of discharge her last white count was 97.
The patient does have baseline anemia and given her enzyme leak she was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 28.7.
