+ influenza A.  CT trachea showed evidence of small airway infection, and significant narrowing of the trachea at the level of the thoracic inlet by the patient's goiter.
CTA was negative for PE.
Will continue steroids for now (prednisone 60mg QD, no taper, as results of thyroid studies are pending, and would want to continue steroids if Pt.
Recommmendation from IP was for repeat tracheal CT in [**2-24**] weeks; if there is an acute change, Pt may need to undergo rigid bronchoscopy and stenting.
Thyroid technetium uptake scan was unsuccessful given recent IV contrast.
Her lantus dose was decreased while she was in the hospital due to several finger sticks <50.
Will need hormonal workup and f/u scan.
## Pulmonary nodule: Will need OP f/u in 1 year with repeat CT scan.
Syncope x 2, negative EP evaluation.
Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, breathing comfortably and with oxygen saturation in mid-90s on room air.
You will need to have follow up arranged for your: (1) thyroid goiter, to see if further imaging or studies are indicated.
You are taking two medications, methimazole and prednisone, which will need to be adjusted based upon labs that are still pending, to determine what is causing your thyroid disease.
(2) blood pressure, to adjust your antihypertensive medications (3) blood sugar, to adjust your insulin regimen (4) heart failure, to adjust your diuretic medications    Completed by:[**2125-2-27**
