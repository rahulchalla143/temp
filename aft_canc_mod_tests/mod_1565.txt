ECG [**2184-12-16**]: poor baseline ?
He was generally afebrile through course in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and did not require intubation By the end of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay once he was breathing with adequate saturation on 2L.
Blood cultures from admission grew 2 out 4 bottles with final culture being Klebsiella sensitive to cefepime, resistant to levofloxacin and gentamcin.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course also remarkable for intermittent atrial flutter seen on telemetry and supratherapeutic INR for which coumadin was held.
LE dopplers revealed no presence of DVT.
His neutropenia was noted to resolve s/p GM-CSF treatment.
Surveillance blood cultures taken on the His respiratory status was still not at baseline and therefore the pt was steroid regimen was made more potent by changing the steroid to solumedrol.
Neutropenia, resolved s/p GM-CSF treatment -appears to be improving, continue to monitor CBC and ANC.
DVT from [**10-2**] now gone.
-Would check INR every 2 days the first few days after discharge.
-when INR in therapeutic range start 150 mg SC lovenox once a day  6.
Appears that he had this as far back as [**2184-5-28**] and plain films at that time were negative for any abnormality including SBO, free air or ascites.
Guaiac is currently unknown (given his ANC <500, no rectal exam performed).

Effexor XR 75mg once daily 9.
