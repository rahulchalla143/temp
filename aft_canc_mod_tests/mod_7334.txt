Imaging CXR PA and Lateral [**2154-8-30**]: MPRESSION: Improving congestive heart failure and right basilar pneumonia.
PA and Lateral CXR [**2154-8-23**]: 1.
CTA [**2154-8-23**]: 1. right lower lobe pneumonia 2. mild pulmonary edema 3. pathologic mediastinal adenopathy, unchanged .
EKG [**2154-8-23**]: NSR @ 75.
He was found to have a RLL pneumonia seen in CXR and Chest CT scan.
He underwent repeat CXR on [**8-30**] which was notable for an improved right basilar pneumonia.
# Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure with preserved biventricular function from last echo in [**Month (only) 956**].
He has only trace edema on CT and CXR but during his last hospitalization he presented very similarly and responded well to diuresis.
Exam notable throughout hospitalization for b/l inspiratory crackles, midly elevated JVP and trace pedal edema.
Repeat CXR on [**8-30**] showed decreased pulmonary edema.
His weight on discharge was noted to be 155.6 lbs.
Given the finding of infiltrate on CT and CXR this was thought to be the most likely source.
He had two sets of negative blood cultures in the emergency room.
Urine culture grew ~1000 gram positive organisms but repeat culture later in this hospitalization was negative.
He was continued on his home dose of metoproll and his lisinopril was increased from 30 mg to 40 mg daily with a decrease in his systolic blood pressures to the 140s.
His baseline hematocrit is 26-30.
On admission his hematocrit was noted to be 23.
On discharge his hematocrit was 26.7.
On discharge his hematocrit was 26.7. .
His metformin was held on admission given the need for CT imaging.
On a regimen of lantus 9 units QHS and glipizide 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] the patient was noted to have significant AM hypoglycemia with AM blood sugars on chemistries in the 30s and 40s.
He should have repeat TFTs as an outpatient once he has recovered from his acute illness.
# Hyperkalemia: On the day of discharge the patient was noted to have a potassium of 5.4.
He should have a repeat potassium check as an outpatient when he follows up with his primary care physician.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Your blood sugars were noted to be low in the morning.
Please check your blood sugars every morning this week and let your primary care physician know these numbers when you follow up with him.
