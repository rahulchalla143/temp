She then underwent a chest CT [**2175-5-4**], which demonstrated a 5x3cm spiculated ilfiltrate in the RUL.
She was treated with another course of levo and had a repeat CT scan [**2175-6-7**].
This scan showed an increase in size in the RUL consolidation with some new fullness in the R hilum.
She then underwent a CT guided biopsy of the mass which revealed NSCLC most consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.

[**2176-2-9**]: In comparison with the study of [**2-8**], right chest tube again extends to the apex and descends inferiorly to terminate at the level of the hemidiaphragm.
On [**2176-2-10**] she was extubated with oxygen saturations in the 94-98% with occasional desaturations to low 90's on 50% shovel mask.
Aggressive chest PT was administered her oxygen saturations improved 94-97% on 4 Liters nasal cannula.
Oxygen saturations remained > 93%  at rest on 3Liters of nasal cannula with desaturations to 88% with acitivity.
She required home oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations > 93%.
Flexible bronchoscopy was performed on [**2176-2-10**] which showed slight effacement of right middle lobe medial segment.
She was followed by serial chest films which showed atelectasis and stable right apical space.
