At [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital patient underwent EGD on [**2128-11-11**] and was found to have gastritis/gastroesophageal reflux disease.
A recent abdominal ultrasound showed a questionable focal lesion (location not reported).
On [**2128-11-11**] he also underwent an ERCP that revealed common bile duct stricture which was stented with a plastic stent.
The patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy on [**2128-11-13**] at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain left in place.
On [**2128-11-15**] the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**] for a repeat ERCP.
He became apneic with heart rates in the 30s, systolic blood pressure to 81, and oxygen saturation to 40% very briefly.
The patient's heart rate increased to a rate of 150s with systolic blood pressure to the 150s.
Hepatitis C, viral load undetectable in 01/[**2128**].
Status post ERCP [**2128-11-11**] and [**2128-11-15**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.3, heart rate 81, blood pressure 121/61, oxygen saturation was 95% on AC mode, tidal volume 700, respiratory rate 20, FIO2 of 100%, and a PEEP of 5.
LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION:  White blood cells 7.5, hematocrit 34.3, platelets 169.
Coagulation studies were normal.
Chemistry was normal with the exception of a potassium of 2.9.
ALT 36, AST 47, LDH 229, alkaline phosphatase 240, total bilirubin 19.6, amylase 28, lipase 60, CK 174, MB 5, troponin less than 0.01, albumin 2.3, calcium 7.7, ammonia 40.
Blood gas on arrival to the Intensive Care Unit:  pH 7.25, PCO2 55, PO2 250, bicarbonate 25, lactate 3.0.
EKG:  Sinus tachycardia with a rate of 104, normal axis, no acute ST-T changes, no prior study available for comparison.
Portable chest x-ray showed the ETT at carina, diffuse patchy infiltrates bilaterally, and no effusions.
Patient's white blood cell count decreased during admission, and an initial fever after intubation to a maximum of 102.2 resolved and patient was afebrile for last eight days of admission.
A biopsy of the common bile duct was done at that time and showed chronic inflammation and no evidence of tumor or mass.
Both PTC and CT of abdomen and MRCP were unrevealing for extrinsic mass.
Patient's bilirubin continued to decline towards normal during his admission, and on day of discharge bilirubin was at 9.
The patient's pathology slides have been requested by the surgeons who consulted on this patient and will be reviewed by our Pathology Department in the coming weeks.
Other laboratory values that were checked during admission include a CEA of 2.4, a CA of 19-9 of 58, bile fluid that grew Enterococcus that was sensitive to both Ampicillin and Levofloxacin.
Hepatitis C. 5.
Patient to see his primary care doctor, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5936**], at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 25350**], on Wednesday, [**2128-12-1**], at 5:15 p.m.
Patient will have his chemistries and liver function tests checked within two to three days of discharge by home nursing to ensure trending downward of bilirubin.
