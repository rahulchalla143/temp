Focal consolidation in the right upper lobe is unchanged allowing for differences in patient positioning, but has improved compared to an older study of [**2174-4-5**].
Video fluoroscopic images were obtained with assistance speech pathologist.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - normal; mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal; basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral - normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex - normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler, though can not completely rule out a small PFO.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
An intraaortic balloon is seen (IABP).
LV systolic function is normal.
The maximum gradient across the MV was 7 mm Hg with a mean gradient of 5.

Bilateral chest tubes were placed for 5 liters with dramatic improvement in his ventilation which was able to be weaned to 40% Fio2.
Head CT was negative.
On [**4-6**] he complained of LLQ pain, CT scan showed retroperitoneal bleed.
His white count continued to rise, and he complained of RUQ pain, and had evidence of acute cholecystitis on ultrasound.
Speech swallow evaluation suggested PO diet of thin liquids and soft solids.
Antibiotics were dc'd, and his white count continued to improve.
