# GI bleed: After reversal of her INR with vitamin K the patient underwent EGD, colonoscopy and capsule study.
EGD showed an AVM which was cauterized.

Capsule study showed nonbleeding red spots.
#chronic systolic CHF: Initially the patient was slightly volume overloaded (with crackles and pedal edema on exam).
While NPO the patient was diuresed and exam was euvolemic.
As his creatinine was then elevated, diuretics then stopped prior to colonoscopy.

Blood cultures grew MRSA in [**4-14**] bottles in 12hrs.
A TTE did not show valvular lesions to suggest endocarditis.
