These were inconsistent, and associated with epistaxis, and we believed that there was a component of bloody post-nasal drip contributing, exacerbated by the fact that she was on a heparin gtt for her heart valve.
She underwent broncheoalveolar lavage which was culture negative and her antibiotics were discontinued on [**10-23**].
She continued to be intermittently diuresed but it was stopped when her creatinine bumped from 1.8 to 2.7.
She was extubated and returned to the medical floor with o2 sats 95% on 2LNC The thought is that her respiratory distress was likely due to a mucus plug and pulmonary edema.
She was empirically started on IV flagyl and PO vanco which were continued when stool culture was positive for c.diff.
Patient presented with an INR of 10 for unclear reasons.
She received 5mg PO Vit K, and her INR down-trended to the sub-therapeutic range and she was started on a Heparin gtt for her mechanical mitral valve.
Urine lytes showed were consistent with hypovolemia.

During hospital stay patient was intermittently diuresised and prior to discharge restarted on PO Bumex 5mg daily with creatinine of 1.7.
Weight at time of discharge: 62.4kg ; sating >95% on 5L NC.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: -- Pleae continue Bumex 5mg PO daily; monitor weights daily as well as renal function; may consider increasing bumex to [**Hospital1 **] or transitioning to IV if weight increases >3lb .
Na at time of discharge 152 OUTPATIENT -- Continue monitoring of electrolytes; encourage PO intake and adminster D5W if needed (however by cautious in setting of known diastolic CHF).
Congestive Heart Failure -- Continue PO Bumex 5mg daily; monitor weights as well as renal function with weekly chem 10 panel .
Mitral Valve Replacement; goal INR 2.5 - 3.5 -- Continue hep gtt until bridged with coumadin, 3mg daily, to a therapeutic INR .
Left kidney mass was seen on CT abdomen which is new since [**2134**] and will need follow up ultrasound and monitoring.
Outpatient Lab Work Please obtain twice weekly hematocrits, INR (INR goal 2.5 - 3.5) 2.

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of GI bleed and while in house you developed respiratory compromise requiring intubation.
You were transfused RBCs as needed and your blood counts were monitored closely.
CHANGES TO YOUR MEDICATIONS: START 10mg Nadolol daily for gastric varices CONTINUE MEROPENEM until [**2137-11-3**] CONTINUE VANCOMYCIN AND FLAGYL until [**2137-11-9**] STOP SPIRONOLACTONE and AMLODIPINE until told otherwise CHANGE COUMADIN to 3mg daily (goal INR 2.5 to 3.5) CHANGE BUMEX to 5mg daily (previously 5mg twice a day)  Again it was a pleasure taking care of you.
