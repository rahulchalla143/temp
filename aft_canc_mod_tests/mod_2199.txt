On [**6-28**] the patient underwent bronchoscopy which showed tumor occluding the stent which was partially removed.
STAT echo revealed EF of 25%, decreased from 60% in [**2115-5-8**].
Eventually, the patient was also started on low dose metoprolol and captopril after his blood pressure stabilized.
During his OSH MICU course, he was also found to have focal neuro deficits (left ptosis, left facial droop) so a head CT was done.
This study revealed an old right parietal infarct with moderate chronic small vessel infarcts without evidence of enhancing lesions.
CXR was done showing complete whiteout of the right lung [**1-9**] to post-obstructive pneumonia.
Chest CT the following day revealed bilateral pleural effusions (R>L), complete RUL/RML/RLL collapse with apparent obstruction of the bronchial stent within the right main stem bronchus.
