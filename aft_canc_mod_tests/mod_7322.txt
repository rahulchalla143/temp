([**4-20**]) CT COLONOGRAPHY: There is adequate distention of the colon between the three positions.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN [**4-24**]: The liver is without focal lesions.
There is a low-density lesion in the left kidney, which on prior CT examination has been demonstrated to represent a cyst.
There is an aortic aneurysm, better evaluated on the recent CT scan.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
Please note that the sensitivity of CT colonography for polyps greater than 1 cm is over 90%.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2122-4-15**] no diagnostic interval change.
Given the lobulated margins of the descending thoracic aorta, specifically seen on series 3, image 65, the possibility of a penetrating atheromatous ulcer cannot be excluded though overall configuration is stable.
There is thrombosis of the right CSA stent seen on series 3, image 225, unchanged.
Lung windows are notable for mild apically predominant centrilobular emphysema.
[**Name2 (NI) **]-containing ventral abdominal hernias are noted on series 401B, image 36 and image 41.
Massive fusiform aneurysm of the thoracic and abdominal aorta, up to 7 cm in diameter, increased from prior CT scan without signs of rupture or aortoenteric fistula.
COLONOSCOPY [**2122-5-1**]: Red blood and clots was seen in the entire colon.
Fresh blood was noted accumulating in the cecum.
Impression: Red blood and clots was seen in the entire colon.
Fresh blood was noted accumulating in the cecum.
Blood in the colon Diverticulosis of the whole colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum .
CTA [**2122-5-2**]: LUNG BASES: There is bibasilar atelectasis without pleural or pericardial effusion.
GI BLEEDING STUDY [**2122-5-3**]: INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for minutes were obtained.
Blood flow images show a tortuous aorta and iliac vessels.
Once stable, she was hemodynamically stable on the floor, however she continued to bleed requiring intermittent transfusion to keep her Hct above 25.
On [**4-17**], colonscopy was performed which was notable for sessile polyps and sigmoid diverticulosis, however it was felt to be a difficult study most consistent with a proximal source of bleeding.
On [**4-20**], given her continued transfusion requirement, she had a tagged RBC scan which failed to localize the bleeding.
Additionally, she had a virtual CT colonscopy which showed no abnormality.
CTA was obtained on [**5-2**] but showed no source for the bleed, and no sign of aortoenteric fistula.
Decision was then made to repeat tagged RBC scan on [**5-3**] which infact showed LLQ bleed, likely distal jejunem/prox ileum.
Therefore, she underwent small bowel enteroscopy on [**5-4**] which again showed no source of bleed.
Hct 25.4 on discharge .
#Thoracoabdominal aneurysm: This was noted by CTA to have increased in size to 7.3cm from prior size of 5.5cm.
#Lung nodules: She was noted to have a <1cm lung nodule, stable on current scan versus prior studies in [**2121**].
# Mild ARF: Cr 1.2 on admission.
Cr was 0.9 on discharge .

We did several tests and endoscopic procedures, and we were still not able to localize the bleed.
