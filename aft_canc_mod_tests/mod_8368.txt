[**5-30**] CXR - Improved pulmonary aeration, with persistent right basilar opacity, likely residual consolidation.
[**6-2**] CT chest/abd/pel - 1.
[**6-8**] CXR - Tracheostomy tube tip is 2 cm from the carina.
Blood cultures were consistently negative.
VAP (resistant pseudomonas) - Colonized chronically with multiple resistent pseudomonas bacteria.
Based on sputum culture data from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab she was changed from imipenem to cefepime and vancomycin was discontinued.
Repeat sputum cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] again grew pseudomonas that was now resistant to cefepime, therefore tobramycin was added.
No evidence of vegetation on TEE during last admission and given that blood cultures remained negative an endovascular source seemed less likely.
Heme-onc was consulted as patient has underlying MDS with borderline AML transformation, but they did not believe that her fevers were due to her underlying hematologic disorder.
No further renal failure and creatinine was at baseline 0.8-1.0 until just prior to discharge.
Renal function should be followed daily while continue treatment with tobramycin for VAP.
Urine lytes not pre-renal.
Please check Cr in [**1-23**] days to ensure it is downtrending.
Heme-Onc: -Pancytopenia - h/o MDS with bone marrow Bx revealing borderline transformation to AML.
A repeat bone marrow Bx can be considered in the future.
DAT weakly positive initially due to elevated IgG, but a repeat test was negative.
Hematocrit was followed and remained stable prior to discharge.
Had no change in her exam and did not have distress.

Your creatinine increased slightly which we presume is secondary to one of the antibiotics you were receiving.
Please re-check creatinine in [**1-23**] days.
Please have your electrolytes checked until stable.
