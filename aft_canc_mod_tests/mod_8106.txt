She was taken to an area hospital where a CT scan of the neck showed C2 vertebral foramina fracture, and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further managment.
Her GCS was 15 upon arrival; she was also complaining of pain in the back of her head and neck, but denies weakness and numbness/tingling, though she does have severe pain from her orthopaedic injuries, including a left wrist fracture.
Past Medical History: ONC HISTORY (per OMR, previous discharge summaries): Ms. [**Known lastname 103705**] was diagnosed with her lymphoma following preop workup in preparation for Nissen fundiplication mid-[**Month (only) 404**] [**2116**].
During her pre-operative workup, a CXR showed a R mediastinal mass.
Right cervical LN biopsy ([**2116-12-23**]) showed involvement by high grade non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, best classified as diffuse large B-cell-type.
By immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells are diffusely immunoreactive for pan-B-cell marker CD20 with coexpression of bcl-2, CD10 (minor subset), and bcl-6 (subset).
Pan T-cell markers CD3 and CD5 highlight background T-cells.
Restaging PET scans ([**2117-2-8**] and [**2117-3-24**]) revealed further reduction in her disease burden.

Conclusions Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal / borderline (LVEF 50-55%).
An antispasmodic was also added for the neck spasms that she was experiencing which seemed to help.
