She underwent a CT scan in [**Month (only) 547**], which demonstrated epicardial fat and right middle lobe atelectasis and/or scarring and lingular atelectasis.
She then underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed a possible mass in the left atrium.
Since the study was technically challenging, she underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram which showed a large left atrial mass which appeared adherent to the intra-atrial septum, most likely representing a large atrial myxoma.
