His PET scan from yesterday revealed ascites, pleural effusions, but showed that his esophageal CA treatment with cisplatin and 5FU was definitive.
His vital signs on presentation to the ER were 97.5 78 107/86 26 100.
He had a CXR that showed early PNA in the LLL for which he received levaquin.
His vital signs on transfer were 97.5 84/42 (78/42 prior) 62-72 13-16 98-99% RA.

CXR showed lower lobe opacities bilaterally.
He was started on heparin gtt while transferring and he received a CTA which was negative for PE, but showed b/l ground-glass opacities concerning for ARDS.
He had a BNP, EKG, cardiac enzymes and TTE which did not reveal heart failure as contributory to respiratory distress.
#Hypotension: Patient's BP ranging from 80s to 130s systolic.
Cortisol stimulation testing was inadequate, however pt has low albumin levels and therefore he would not be expected to have a sufficiently high total coritsol level.
Free cortisol levels would likely respond appropriately.
His hypotension was volume responsive making adrenal insufficieny unlikely (although patient likely has long-standing adrenal insufficiency).
Cdiff tests negative throughout stay.
#Liver disease:  Known hepatitis C positive since age 17 secondary to IV drug use.
He had a right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed cirrhosis, ascites and patent vasculature.
He is HCV (+) and had a viral load of  195,000 IU/mL.
He also underwent paracentesis which was negative for SBP.
