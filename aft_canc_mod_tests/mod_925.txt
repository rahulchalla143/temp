History of echocardiogram in [**2119**] by report with no mitral regurgitation, mildly decreased bilateral ventricular function.
4) Secondary polycythemia with baseline hematocrit 65-75 and prn phlebotomy at hematocrit greater than 74.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission, temperature 95.9, blood pressure 112/58, heart rate 110, respiratory rate 20, pulse ox 74%.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, hematocrit 75, white blood cell count 7.9, platelet count 34,000, sodium 143, potassium 4.5, chloride 99, CO2 31, BUN 67, creatinine 1.7.
Urinalysis with greater than 300 protein and rare bacteria.
AST 59, ALT 16, alkaline phosphatase 87, total bilirubin 0.9, uric acid 6.5, lactate 2.7, TSH 3.1.
Chest x-ray in the Emergency Room demonstrated cardiomegaly but no pneumonia or intrapulmonary pathologic processes noted.
Bleeding scan negative for any active bleeding.
The patient and family refused colonoscopy and NG lavage for fear of desaturation with sedation.
Stool studies were sent and were negative for C.diff and E. coli but three PMNs were noticed on fecal leukocyte exam.
However, given the PMNs on fecal studies and the resolution of the bright red blood per rectum, it is felt that it was likely infectious in quality.
Pulmonary:  The patient maintained her baseline saturations in the 70's during this admission with no further issues.
Heme:  The patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 75 upon admission which dropped as low as in the 60's during her hospitalization after her episode of GI bleeding.
The patient did not require transfusion and maintained her baseline oxygen saturations throughout this admission.
An arbitrary decision was made to transfuse the patient if her hematocrit dropped below 60 as she typically runs in the mid 60's and a lower hematocrit would be more of a stress for her heart but this never occurred.
