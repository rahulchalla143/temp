Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, compared to the previous study of [**9-13**].
CXR 2/4/8: 1.
TTE [**2138-3-18**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
CXR [**2138-3-20**]: Worsening of pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions with overall distention in mediastinal vasculature consistent with volume overload.
