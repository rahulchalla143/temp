Past Surgical History: - Appendectomy in childhood - s/p bilateral Dupuytren's contracture releases - Back surgery - Rotator cuff repair .
Strength 5/5 RUE/LE, [**4-27**] LUE, [**2-25**] LLE.
Pertinent Results: CXR [**11-6**]: Since prior exam, there has been no significant interval change.
CT Head w/o contrast [**11-7**]: No acute intracranial pathology.
Please note that gadolinium-enhanced MRI is more sensitive for the detection of intracranial masses.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-10-21**], there is worsening in right ventricular function with more right ventricular dilation, increased severity of tricuspid regurgitation, and increased estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Evaluation of the mucosal surface is limited.

He then developed hypoxia worsening about [**11-16**] and had another brief few days in the intensive care unit on stress dose steroids for respiratory monitoring before he was transferred back to the oncology floor.
A barium swallow was performed and there was no evidence of stricture or obstruction.
The patient will follow with new scan in [**3-29**] weeks.
Target INR goal is [**1-26**], and his INR at discharge is 2.8. .
A CTA was performed which showed no pulmonary embolism.
ACS less likely given lack of acute ST-T changes on EKG and negative CE.
