PATHOLOGY [**8-23**] path: Positive for malignant cells consistent with poorly-differentiated carcinoma with features of a small cell carcinoma.
Bone scan [**8-27**]: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of bony metastatic disease.
CT torso [**8-27**]: 1.
Small left adrenal lesion does not meet CT criteria for benign lesion.
MRI of head [**8-26**]: .
Metastatic SCLC - Large R sided lung mass encassing RMSB.
Bone scan negative for [**First Name3 (LF) 1364**].
Patient was suspected to have paraneoplastic encephalitis vs HSV encephalitis according to an MRI of the brain that also showed brain lesions likely to be [**First Name3 (LF) 1364**].
Pt was started on ACV b/o possible HSV encephalitis according to neurology consult, but D/C'ed again since LP from [**8-29**] contained only 1 RBC and CSF HSV PCR result was negative.
