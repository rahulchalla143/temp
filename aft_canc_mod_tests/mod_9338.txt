Patient received CT head and was found to have bilateral subdural hemorrhage with midline shift.
Patient's platelets were 7 and he was given one unit of platelets at that time.
He denies blurry vision, numbness (other than chronic chin numbness), tingling, weakness of the extremities (outside of chronic weakness which has been attributed to vincristine toxicity, and compression neuropathy due to weight loss).
But notes a remote fall in [**Month (only) 5298**] of [**2144**], for which head CT was negative.
Neuro exam was nonfocal, patient A&Ox3.
Labs significant for pancytopenia (WBC 0.1, ANC 80, hct 21.4, plts 7), electrolytes and coags WNL (INR 0.9).
EKG showed sinus @ 90, no acute changes.
VS prior to transfer 98.3 HR 94 BP 118-103/78 RR 18 O2 sat 98-100% RA.
Post-op CT showed pneumocephalus as expected.
He was recovering well on [**2-10**] and CT head showed some more left SDH but less midline shift.

Flow cytometry showed monotypic large B cells, kappa light chain restricted, CD10+, CD19+, CD20+ bright, CD22+, CD 38+ bright, FMC7+, CD5-, CD11c-, CD25-, CD103-.

Biopsy of the cervical FDG avid lymph node, shows lymphoma cells.

An area of hyperdensity along the left convexity (2:16) is also unchanged.
There is edema and sulcal effacement with mass effect on the ventricles as compared to the CT of [**2144-8-2**], which was obtained prior to the hemorrhage.
While of slightly more fluid-attenuation over the series of studies since [**2145-2-2**], it is not clearly present on MR studies of [**9-26**] and [**2144-12-11**], and may represent a relatively acute posterior fossa subdural hygroma.
# SDH: Stable on repeat CT imaging, although his HA and nausea persisted.
He will have repeat head CT in 4 weeks and follow up in neurosurgery clinic.
You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to your appointment.
You will have a PET CT on [**2145-2-24**] at 2pm, [**Location (un) **] [**Hospital Ward Name **] Bld, [**Hospital Ward Name 600**].
