COMPARISON: CT torso [**2108-1-5**] and CT abdomen and pelvis [**2108-1-16**].
RENAL ULTRASOUND: This study is somewhat limited by large patient body habitus.
Again demonstrated are bilateral hypodense foci of both kidneys similar to low attenuation lesions seen on recent CT and most compatible with cysts.

Brief Hospital Course: She was admitted to the Medicine and underwent abdominal CT which showed no acute pathology though exam was limited due to lack of contrast but did reveal an ileus.
One episode coffee ground emesis noted in ED; her stool was guaiac positive; hematocrits were followed every 6 hours; the Hct did drop as low as 19.7; last value was 26.3 on [**2108-2-6**].
The patient however, had an clinical abdominal exam that was increasingly worrisome for peritonitis and a lactate elevation.
Her ostomy output was initially high; she was later started on Loperamide to slow down output to allow for better absorption of her oral intake.
The Lithium levels during her hospital stay were consistently subtherapeutic.
Her creatinine began to slowly rise on [**2108-2-3**] 2.6 up to 3.4 on [**2-6**].
A renal ultrasound was also ordered; no hydronephrosis noted; bilateral renal cysts present.
