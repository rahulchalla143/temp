CT of the neck at [**Hospital3 **] showed a 3.6 cm mass in the L piriform sinus.
An EGD was unable to be completed due to severe esophageal stricture.
A modified barium study showed achalasia and severe esophageal narrowing.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up of this mass.

CXR ([**7-21**]): Single chest AP performed to evaluate pneumothorax, the heart and mediastinum are midline.
CXR ([**7-23**]): Two views.
Comparison with the previous study done [**2107-7-22**].
CXR ([**7-29**]): CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: Comparison is made to the prior day.
Density along the right lateral chest wall, at the site of the recent catheter tract, has a similar appearance.
Rest MIBI ([**2107-7-22**]): Following injection of MIBI while patient was at rest and experiencing chest pain, static and gated SPECT images were obtained and analyzed.
Gated images and the rest of the test including stress images were not performed due to patients pulmonary and blood pressure problems.
CT Neck ([**2107-7-27**]): FINDINGS: There is an ill-defined, heterogeneous, enhancing mass filling the left piriform sinus with the bulk centered at the C5 level on the lateral scout film.
Encroachment of the airway at the inferior border of the hyoid bone.
Comparison with prior outside studies would be helpful to ensure stability of this finding.
Echo ([**2107-7-26**]): Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
PLEURAL FLUID: exudative, negative for malignant cells.
Patient was maintained on supplemental oxygen with appropriate saturation for the remainder of his hospitalization.
Although initially he was deemed safe for comfort POs (coffee, water sips), subsequent evaluations demonstrated that he has a high risk of aspiration.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
Iron studies pointed to anemia of chronic disease.
For the past 14 days prior to discharge, his hematocrit stabilized and had no further changes.
Patient was not symptomatic with this hypertension and was continued on IV/TD antihypertensives with SBP goal of 160- 170: permissive hypertension given chronic elevation as an outpatient.
Patient was on Digoxin as an outpatient and serum levels were appropriate.
He was pancultured but all cultures were negative.
HydrALAzine 20 mg IV Q6H:PRN SBP > 160 8.
A biopsy was performed of this tumor and it is a cancer that has not spread (squamous cell carcinoma).
