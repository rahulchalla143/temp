Angiogram was done emergently, which revealed likely occlusion of the left angular branch of the middle cerebral artery on the left, but because the patient could not tolerate the placement of the catheter, he could not receive intra-arterial TPA.
The CT done at that time showed no bleed and only slight contrast extravasation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, vital signs were blood pressure 165/56, pulse 60, respirations 20 and temperature 908.5.
Neurological examination revealed that the patient is alert, awake, and only saying minimal words.
Coordination tests were not able to be done secondary to comprehension problems.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was kept in the ICU under the care of Neurology and his blood pressure was controlled at 140 to 150 systolic.
He initially tolerated the Heparin and Integrilin well, but on the day after admission it was noted that his hematocrit had dropped to 30 from a preoperative level of 37.
Urinalysis and stool guaiac were obtained, which were negative for bleed.
He was given two units of packed red blood cells and the hematocrit came up nicely.
While he was in the unit, he also received some Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support.
Bedside swallow test was performed, which demonstrated that he could swallow thickened liquids and diet was advanced as tolerated with no adverse events.
