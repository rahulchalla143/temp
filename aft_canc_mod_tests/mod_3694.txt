GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The study is otherwise unchanged from prebypass.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has apparently been an attempt to advance the right IJ catheter.
It appears to extend well into the IVC, before _____ back on itself so that the tip is in the pulmonary outflow tract.
