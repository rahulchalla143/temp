After fluid resuscitation, her blood pressures stabilized and she was transferred to the floor.
Pneumonia: She presented with history of cough and fatigue, and her initial chest xray on admission showed no acute process.
A chest xray the day after admission showed bibasilar pneumonia.
She was seen by the endocrinology team who did not feel that her presentation was related to her hypothyroidism, despite an elevated TSH to 7.5.
She was negative for acute EBV and other viral studies were pending (HIV, CMV, or Hep A, B, D, or E).
Acute renal failure:  Given her BUN to Crt ratio, granular and hyaline casts on sediment and picture of hypovolemia on presentation, her acute renal failure was most likely prerenal.
Your kidneys have recovered but you need to follow up with your PCP regarding pending tests including repeat liver function tests in 1 week.
