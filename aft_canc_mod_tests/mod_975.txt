On the morning of [**2149-12-28**], she was noted to be in respiratory distress with an oxygen saturation of 80% on room air and a temperature of 103.4.
In the Emergency Department, she was in respiratory distress, saturating 95% on 100% nonrebreather, blood pressure 130/80, pulse 140s-150s.
Her systolic blood pressure dropped immediately into the 70s and did not respond to fluid.
A chest x-ray demonstrated a left lower lobe pneumonia and a white cell count was 20.2 with a left shift.
In the Emergency Department, she was also noted to have poor urine output and received 6 liters of IV fluids with 600 cc of urine output over the next two hours.
Cervical cancer, diagnosed in [**2106**], status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
ONCOLOGIST AT [**Hospital6 **]:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE ICU:  Blood pressure stable, saturations 99% on assist control 20, 500, and 60%.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 20, hematocrit 32, creatinine 1.3 (last creatinine at this hospital was 0.7 in [**2147-8-11**]).
The differential included 45% neutrophils, 21% bands, 15% lymphocytes, 12% metamyelocytes, 2% myelocytes.
INR 1.2.
Valproate level 45.
The urinalysis was notable for [**5-19**] white blood cells and occasional bacteria.
Blood gases were within normal limits at 7.40, 39, 70.
Chest x-ray demonstrated ETT 6 cm above carina, left subclavian and left atrium, no effusions or infiltrate were read on initial x-ray.
EKG was notably tachycardiac with ST depressions in V2 and V3, mild left axis deviation and question of U wave.
CARDIAC:  The patient was initially felt to be in septic shock secondary to her left shift, fever, and hypotension not responding to fluids; however, on [**2149-12-30**], a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed which demonstrated a cardiac index of 1.5, SVR 1,200, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 20.
Her CK was in the 800s and troponin 2.6.
An echocardiogram was performed which demonstrated global decrease in LV and RV function and no significant valve abnormalities.
Her EF was about 20%.
This is in contrast to an echocardiogram from [**2149-7-10**] where her EF was 55%.
Repeat echocardiogram should be performed within the next few days to reevaluate cardiac function.
An EEG was performed on [**2149-12-31**] which demonstrated that the patient was in convulsive status epilepticus.
Continuous EEG from [**2150-1-1**] to [**2150-1-5**] demonstrated no further seizure activity, although the patient had severe diffuse slowing.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] states that further workup of Mrs. [**Known lastname **]' AML demonstrated that she is in remission.
RENAL:  Creatinine clearance came down to 0.5 which is in the patient's normal limits.
No further issues with urine output or creatinine.
HEMATOLOGY:  Thrombocytopenia, have held all heparin, Swan discontinued on [**2150-1-5**] (Swan with heparin-bonding).
PLAN IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS:  Neurology is requesting an MRI when EEG leads are discontinued.
