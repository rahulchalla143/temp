He had fevers which were believed to be due to the cytarabine since the fevers only occurred following the chemo and cultures were negative.
He received tumor lysis and DIC labs frequently during chemo, none of which were positive.
Bone marrow biopsy was done of [**8-17**].
As LFT's normalized the pt continued to have fevers, tachycardia and developed sharp [**Month/Year (2) 5283**] abdominal pain and mica was changed to vori again, and an extensive work up including [**Month/Year (2) 5283**] US, CT A/P, MRI of liver, HIDA scan, surface ECHO, CTA of chest, CT non-con of chest was pursued to evaluate the cause of the pt's persistent hyperdynamic state and severe pleuritic pain.
He was placed on a NRB with improvement in sats to 100% but a large A-a gradient with ABG 7.44/45/79, lactate of 1.0.
Pt was tachycardic to 170s and tachypneic.
He continued to spike fevers while on the floor and was cultured repeatedly, but was never positive except for the single VRE positive blood culture.
The patient's bilirubin subsequently decreased after stopping the daptomycin.
A CT scan of the chest done on [**9-15**] showed no acute process or etiology of his pain.
#Elevated bilirubin - The patient had an elevation of his bilirubins from [**Date range (1) 62547**].
