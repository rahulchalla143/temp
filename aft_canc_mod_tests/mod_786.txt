female with h/o Multiple myeloma and Amyloidosis s/p auto and allo SCT with complicated medical history including multiple DVTs, and sponatenous pneumothoraces s/p chest tube placement now admitted for hypoxia when she was seen in clinic with an O2 saturation of 86% on RA.
The patient states that she was in clinic today for evaluation when they took her vitals and noticed her low O2 sat.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY - s/p 3 episodes of epiglottitis/supraglottitis requiring intubation in [**2145**], [**2149**], [**3-2**] - Amyloidosis - involvement of lungs, tongue, bladder, heart - CKD - thought secondary to disease progression - Diastolic dysfunction- likely secondary amyloid - h/o multiple DVT's (L IJ, L popliteal, L sup femoral)-IVC filter, due to R sided DVT propagation; on coumadin intermittently (due to fluctuating platelet counts on Velcade) - Osteopenia s/p Zometa infusions - HTN - s/p tonsillectomy - Hx of disseminated herpes in [**2146**] - Urge incontinence - Subdural hemorrhages in [**2-/2151**] in the setting of elevated INR  ONCOLOGIC HISTORY Multiple Myeloma TREATMENT HISTORY: 1.

female with h/o Multiple myeloma and Amyloidosis s/p auto and allo SCT with complicated medical history including multiple DVTs, and sponatenous pneumothoraces s/p chest tube placement now admitted for hypoxia when she was seen in clinic with an O2 saturation of 86% on RA.
# Hypoxia: The patient's CT scan prior to admission was consistent with recurrence of pneumothorax on L side with also a loculated right hydropneumothorax.
On the day of admission, she had a CT guided pigtail catheter placed and approximately 700 cc was drained via chest tube.
Approximately 2-3 hours later, the patient became acute short of breath, hypoxic to the high 80s, and required non-rebreather mask to keep her O2 sat >93%.
At that time, she had a repeat CT scan did not show any new abnormalities.
Serial lactate levels remained < 2.
She was given gentle IV fluids to support her pressures without worsening her pulmonary edema and hypoxia.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because your oxygen saturation was low.
You also had pleurodesis, which may have led to a reaction causing you to drop your oxygen saturations requiring you to go to the ICU.
