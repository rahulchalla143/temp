CT head was notable for a large L temporal lobe hypodensity concerning for a CVA and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Exam w/ 10mins off was propofol notable for being comatose, intact pupillary, corneal, VOR and gag reflexes, spontanous UE movements R < L, non-localizing to pain at supraorbital notch, flx response to nox in UEs and LEs.
EKG showing sinus tachycardia.
Repeat HCT and CTA showing a persistent hypodensity in the left subcortial white matter in region of left temporal and parietal lobes (MCA territory) and extensive plaque at bilateral carotid bulbs, but no sigificant hemodynamic stenosis.
Given history of afib, it initially appeared unclear whether CT findings were consistent with an embolic infarction versus the more likely metastatic disease leading to seizure.
Once CTP images were available, it was notable that there was no perfusion deficit and majority of edema was vasogenic.
MRI of the brain revealed multiple metastatic lesions intraparenchymally as well as leptomenigial.
