On further questioning, the family indicated that his blood pressure was "low" at the rehabilitation center.
He was on Levophed as well as dopamine and dobutamine to maintain his blood pressure above a systolic of 90.
His Perm-A-Cath measurements clearly showed a hypermetabolic process consistent with sepsis.
The patient's blood pressure was very dependent on fluids, and he received several liters of fluids in addition to his pressor requirements to maintain his end-organ perfusion.
His oxygenation improved on the ventilator.
His blood cultures were always negative, and his blood pressure improved to the point that his pressor agents were weaned considerably from what they had been on admission to the Intensive Care Unit.
