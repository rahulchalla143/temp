Urine Cytology ([**2189-5-20**]): Atypical urothelial cells, present singly and in rare clusters.
FISH ([**2189-5-21**]): FISH evaluation for a MYC rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the LSI MYC Dual Color Break Apart Rearrangement Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 8q24 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
