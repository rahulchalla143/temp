He was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 31775**] with fever, felt [**2-4**] pneumonia on CT chest, described as patchy b/l infiltrates.
Pa/L CXR today revealed improvement in his infiltrates.

CXR pa/l: Improvement in the patchy densities seen in both lung bases, particularly on the left side.
Slightly limited examination due to large amount of motion artifact, however no evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental level.
ECHO [**2118-6-7**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2118-5-9**] no definite change   Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo M c stage IIIB IgG kappa multiple myeloma d+27 of auto SCT presents with worsened SOB.
# Hypoxia/SOB: Initial w/u negative for worsening PNA (no fever, CXR and CT showed improved appearance of prior infiltrates, and cough was improved since last admission).
Cardiac cause was investigated with BNP, echo and CXR, and there was no evidence of heart failure (patient did not improve with IV lasix).
His hypoxia worsened significantly over the first 24 hours of hospitalization, and he eventually required non-rebreather with 100% O2 and ICU admission.
CTA was negative for PE.
Pt has regular insulin at home and knows how to follow a sliding scale, which he will use upon discharge.
