Upon admission to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital Mr. [**Known lastname 35297**] hematocrit was 35 and systolic blood pressure was 102, which was intravenous fluid resuscitated to 118 with a pulse of 64.
Emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed blood in the stomach and three units of red blood cells were transfused, and he was placed on octreotide with no further bleeding.
A repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy during that hospitalization revealed several grade III esophageal varices on [**2122-7-28**].
He underwent band ligation and was discharged home with an hematocrit of 34.
Blood pressure was 90.
Hematocrit was 18.5 and he was transfused a total of 10 red blood cell units and two units of fresh frozen plasma.
Colonoscopy was performed, which offered a limited view due to large amount of bright red blood in the colon.
The patient underwent a second colonoscopy, which was negative.
The patient was then transferred on [**2122-8-4**] to the Medical Intensive Care Unit at the [**Hospital6 2018**] for further evaluation with angiography.
On admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit his hematocrit was 24.5.
A colonoscopy was performed, which revealed a polyp in the ascending colon, grade II internal hemorrhoids, with an otherwise normal colonoscopy to the cecum.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  His review of systems is notable for a 20-pound weight loss over the past two years, which the patient feels is due to increased exercise and diet.
VITAL SIGNS:  On admission to the medicine unit his temperature was 99.8, pulse 62, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 132/80, O2 saturation 89% on room air.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  His head was atraumatic with a 6 mm nodule, slightly erythematous, on top of his head, which the patient said was evaluated by his primary care physician and determined to be benign.
His eyes showed pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation with concentric reaction; extraocular movements intact; full to confrontation.
Funduscopic examination was normal with clear vessels and optic discs.
Ear examination showed clear tympanic membranes, finger rubbing and finger clicking heard bilaterally.
Throat examination revealed clear posterior pharynx with no exudate; poor dentition.
VASCULAR:  Radial, femoral, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibialis were 2+ bilaterally; no femoral bruits.
Motor examination was [**4-11**] throughout; normal bulk and tone.
Biceps, radial, and patellar deep tendon reflexes were 3+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY STUDIES:  On admission to the medicine unit his white blood cell count was 5.3, red blood cells 3.18, hemoglobin 9.7, hematocrit 30.9, MCV 89, MCH 30.6, MCHC 34.5, RDW 15.5.
Prothrombin time was 13.7, PTT 29.9, platelet count 99.
Glucose 122, BUN 8, creatinine 0.8, sodium 136, potassium 3.6, chloride 105, total bicarbonate 23, anion gap of 12, calcium 7.1, magnesium 1.8, protein 4.2.
STUDIES:  Electrocardiogram done on [**2122-8-5**] revealed normal sinus rhythm, limb lead voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy, early R wave progression with prominent R waves in leads V2 through V3; cannot rule out posterior myocardial infarction, however no previous tracing available for comparison.
Abdominal ultrasound on [**2122-8-6**] revealed a slightly nodular course in liver with associated ascites, splenomegaly, and dampening of the portal venous waveform, suggestive of cirrhosis with portal hypertension.
Colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy studies are as per history of present illness notes.
Gastrointestinal bleed:  Mr. [**Known lastname 35297**] gastrointestinal bleed remained stable in the medicine unit, with hematocrit rise from 24.5 on admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit to an hematocrit of 29.8 on the day of discharge.
The blood pressure remained stable at 150/90 on the day of discharge with a range of 132-150/70-90 throughout the medicine unit admission.
Cirrhosis/portal hypertension/ascites/varices:  Abdominal ultrasound on [**2122-8-6**] revealed a slightly nodular course in liver with associated ascites, splenomegaly, and dampening of the portal venous waveform suggestive of cirrhosis with portal hypertension.
No liver biopsy was done due to the high suspicion of alcohol cirrhosis.
A chest x-ray was performed on [**2122-8-6**], which revealed a left lower lobe consolidation with possible left lower lobe effusion that could not be ruled out.
In addition, no pneumothorax was noted, and x-ray was unchanged from the x-ray of [**2122-8-5**].
The patient's lung symptoms were much improved on the day of discharge with very few crackles heard at the bases bilaterally.
