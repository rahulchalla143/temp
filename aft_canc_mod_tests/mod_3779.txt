Pertinent Results: CT head: Mass effect on fourth ventricle with leftward deviation of pons and mass effect on right cerebellopontine angle.
MRI OSH: Enhancing 2.5 cm cerebellar mass with vasogenic edema, mass effect narrowing 4th ventricle, no significant hydrocephalus, no DWI abnormalities  [**2107-9-27**] 11:30PM   GLUCOSE-92 UREA N-17 CREAT-0.8 SODIUM-136 POTASSIUM-4.2 CHLORIDE-99 TOTAL CO2-24 ANION GAP-17 [**2107-9-27**] 11:30PM   AST(SGOT)-27 CK(CPK)-49 ALK PHOS-35* AMYLASE-63 TOT BILI-0.7 [**2107-9-27**] 11:30PM   ALBUMIN-3.7 CALCIUM-8.8 PHOSPHATE-3.0 MAGNESIUM-2.4 [**2107-9-27**] 11:30PM   WBC-6.7 RBC-3.35* HGB-12.9 HCT-35.6* MCV-106* MCH-38.4* MCHC-36.2* RDW-14.6 [**2107-9-27**] 11:30PM   NEUTS-96.5* BANDS-0 LYMPHS-2.6* MONOS-0.8* EOS-0.2 BASOS-0 [**2107-9-27**] 11:30PM   HYPOCHROM-NORMAL ANISOCYT-1+ POIKILOCY-NORMAL MACROCYT-1+ MICROCYT-NORMAL POLYCHROM-NORMAL [**2107-9-27**] 11:30PM   PLT SMR-NORMAL PLT COUNT-241 [**2107-9-27**] 11:30PM   PT-12.5 PTT-22.1 INR(PT)-1.1  Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the neurosurgery service and monitored closely in ICU.
MRI head done [**2107-9-28**] showed a well-circumscribed approximately 3 cm mass in the left cerebellar hemisphere with leptomeningeal involvement and evidence of mass effect and edema.
Torso CT [**2107-9-29**] showed a large lung mass with possible pericadrial component, which prompted an Interventional Pulmonology consult.
[**2107-9-30**] she underwent a bronchoscopy and biopsy of the lung lesion, done by IP.
Bronchial lavage was positive for malignant cells, consistentt with non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma.
She was watched overnight in PACU and her BP was kept less than 140.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2107-10-6**] shows postoperative changes with decreased mass effect in the left occipital cranial fossa with pneumocephalus.
MRI Head showed: Status post left cerebellar lesion resection with evidence of postop hemorrhage in the resection bed with surrounding areas of residual enhancement.
Her neurological exam upon discharge is intact without any focal findings.
