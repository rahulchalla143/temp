Small bowel resection   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 87-year-old female Jehovah's Witness with a significant cardiovascular history who was diagnosed with a poorly differentiated carcinoma in the left colon after presenting with a hematocrit of 10.

Because of the profound nature of the anemia induced by the tumor,surgical resection was indicated even in the face of metastasis.

She underwent a Head CT, MRI/MRA, and bilateral carotid ultrasounds.
See below for further workup .
POD2: Her aphasia was somewhat worse on POD#2 and her cardiac enzymes were positive.
If Cardiac cath  and/or nuclear MRI study were considered according to enzymes.
Her troponins continued to rise which indicated a Cardiac Cath.
Her oxygen demand increased slightly in ICU, intubation was not required.
She should continue to wean from oxygen as long as cardiac function remains stable during rest & activity.
