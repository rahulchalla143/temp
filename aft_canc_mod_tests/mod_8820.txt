He then developed a fever, cough, and chest discomfort in the setting of of blood transfusion, raising concern for transfusion reaction.

Labs revealed WBC 2.5 (49% NEUTS, 1% EOS), HCT 27.5, PLT 113, Na 130, CRE 1.7, CK 30, Trop < 0.04, INR 1.09.
CXR without clear infiltrate, ECG was reportedly NSR with TWI in V3-6, 2, 3, avF.
CT HEAD was reportedly negative.
Regarding CP, he received aspirin 325mg, with plan for additional blood tranfusions to maintain HCT >30 given question of ischemia.
BP was noted to drop to 85/50, improving with 1L IVF to 96/60.
He then developed SSCP, and repeat ECG showed "T-wave normalization" for which he was given sl ntg, nitro paste.
He was noted to have rales to the mid lung [**Last Name (un) 18100**], and CXR showed "mild increased cephalization."
O2 sats were 100% on NRB, and he was given 20mg lasix, started on heparing gtt, and given 1U PRBC for HCT 27.
CXR without focal infiltrate.

CXR - Bibasilar opacity, likely atelectasis.
Dedicated PA and lateral views recommended for future followup studies.
V/Q scan - 1.
Matched perfusion and ventilation defects in the right upper lobe.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2116-5-25**]):       1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2116-5-27**]):    NO GROWTH, <1000 CFU/ml.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
Respiratory Viral Identification (Final [**2116-5-26**]):       Positive for Influenza A viral antigen.
[**2116-5-24**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION: 1.
Contrast enhanced CT can confirm this if indicated.
CXR showed the development of a right lung consolidation with rapid progression of airspace disease on CT chest.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine 2.0 in [**2115-9-17**],  Creatinine remained under baseline until patient was transferred back to the MICU when he developed anuric renal failure in the setting of septic shock.
Diff at [**Hospital1 882**] notable for 15% plasma cells on microscopy; with flow cytometry confirming plasmcytosis.
Heparin gtt discontinued and not transfused blood for Hct <30 as no evidence of ongoing ischemia.
Switched from atenolol to metoprolol given question of renal failure with goal to titrate to HR 60s.
Coumadin continued for goal INR [**1-14**].
No evidence of active ischemia so Hct transfusion goal lowered to >21.
