significant for malignant bladder cancer s/p elective radical cystectomy/ileal conduit on [**4-25**], HTN, hyperlipidemia, and new mass-like lesion obstructing proximal orifice of left upper lobe, who is transferred from [**Location (un) 28318**], [**State 1727**] for IP evaluation of lung lesion.
In preparation for radical cystectomy, patient had an extensive metastatic evaluation, including chest CT, that revealed no metastatic disease outside of the bladder.
A repeat CXR showed evidence of collapse of the left upper lobe, and a repeat CT scan confirmed collapse and question of a mass (The prior CT images were reviewed and in retrospect it appeared as though there was an upper lobe hilar mass i [**2140-3-1**] as well).
Patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**4-27**] and a mass-like lesion was found obstructing the proximal orifice of the left upper lobe.
Washings were taken but biopsy was not done due to bleeding.
Patient is now being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for Interventional Pulmonology evaluation of bronchial mass.

Imaging: CXR [**2140-4-28**]:  Followup of the patient with bladder cancer after radical prostatectomy and new bronchial mass.
Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison.
Right lung demonstrates a right lower lobe opacity, partially characterized on that study and may represent infectious process or partial atelectasis.
Correlation with cross-sectional imaging is required.
The partial imaging of the upper abdomen shows bilateral ureteral stents.
ECHO [**2140-4-29**]: Suboptimal images.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF >70%).
CT CHEST [**2140-5-6**] FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated, with the ET tube tip being approximately 4 cm above the carina.
The exact dimension of the mass is difficult to estimate given the lack of contrast, but approximate estimation would be 2.5 x 4 cm.
The imaged portion of the abdomen re-demonstrates low density of the liver, 2:50, it should be better assessed with ultrasound.
PATHOLOGY [**2140-5-2**] Left upper lobe, endobronchial biopsy:      Poorly differentiated carcinoma.
Small groups of viable cells stain positive for cytokeratin cocktail (AE1/3 and CAM 5.2) and p63.
Cells are negative for cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 20.
He was bronched by IP, who was able to open up part of the left upper lobe, which subsequently re-collapsed on serial chest xray.
At the time of discharge, the rash persisted and involved his groin, anterior chest and abdomen, and medial aspect of his arms.
# Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine 2.0 prior to transfer and trended up to 3.5.
CT A/P with urogram and negative for ileal conduit leak.
# BRONCHIAL TUMOR: Broncheoscopy performed for left upper lobe collapse returned tissue consistent with non-small cell lung cancer however pathology was unable to exclude metastatic disease from bladder.
His creatinine at OSH reached 3.8 in the setting of obstruction from ureteral stents.
# HYPERNATREMIA: Developed hypernatremia during ICU admission, replaced free water deficit with D5W, with good response of serum sodium values.

Discharge Instructions: Mr [**Known lastname 56711**],  As you know, you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after your bladder surgery for evaluation of respiratory failure.
You were treated with mechanical ventilation and taken for a proceedure to evaluate your left lung.
We took biopsies which suggested that you have a form of lung cancer in your left lung.
Your heart rate increased and you developed an arrythmia called atrial fibrillation.
