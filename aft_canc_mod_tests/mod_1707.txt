The patient was baseline anemic from her colon cancer, and she had an expected drop in her Hct with the addition of IVF resuscitation.
Her O2 saturation failed to improve with supplemental O2, and a trigger was called.
She was found on CXR to have pulmonary edema.
Nonetheless, she began to tire from her tachypnea, and it was decided to transfer her to the ICU for intubation.
Troponins were drawn serially, and during her stay in the ICU they trended downward to 0.03.
An echocardiogram in the ICU showed normal ventricular function and normal ejection fraction.
The patient should follow up with her PCP regarding future management of her metoprolol and diltiazem, as well as for further consideration of anticoagulation.
She had low urine output immediately post-operatively, and actually triggered for it; this was initially treated with albumin.
The patient received 2uPRBC on POD#1, as above, for a Hct of 21.
Her Hct increased appropriately, and she required no further transfusions.
As her cultures were found to grow back group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus, her antibiotics were changed to unasyn on POD#3, and then to augmentin on POD#4 when she was taking PO medications.
She was ambulating well with assistance, her bowel function had returned, her heart rate was controlled, and her pain was controlled by tylenol.
