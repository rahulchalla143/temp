EKG - Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2198-11-6**] the rate has increased.
Echo - Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-9-13**], the effusion is larger and increased pericardial pressure is suggested.
