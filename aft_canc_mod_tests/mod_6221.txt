Her oncologic history began in [**2146-1-20**] when a torso CT to evaluate worsening edema and anemia revealed a 16-cm mass in her right kidney.
Chest CT revealed a 5 x 3.5-cm soft tissue mass in the sternum.
She underwent preoperative embolization of the renal mass in [**2146-2-17**], followed by right hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy and biopsy of the chest wall lesion on [**2146-2-21**], by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 80728**].
Pathology revealed renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, predominately grade 3 with focal sarcomatoid areas.
Tumor was 15 cm in size and invaded the renal capsule.
Biopsy of the chest wall lesion was consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Pretreatment torso CT revealed a small-to-moderate pericardial effusion.
An echo confirmed a small effusion without tamponade.
She otherwise passed stress test and PFTs and began cycle 1, week 1 high-dose IL-2 therapy in [**2146-5-2**], receiving [**11-2**] doses with course complicated by toxic encephalopathy and acute renal failure.
Vital signs: 96.7, 71, 20, 130/80.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission labs: WBC 8.3, hemoglobin 12, hematocrit 35, platelet count 283,000.
INR 1.1.
BUN 16, creatinine 1.1, sodium 39, potassium 4.3, chloride 100, CO2 25, glucose 208, ALT 29, AST 25, CK 23, albumin 3.8, calcium 9.2, phosphorus 3.1, magnesium 1.8.
Her admission weight was 101.3 kg and she received interleukin-2 60.8 million units IV every 8 hours x 14 potential doses.
Systolic blood pressure remained in the 75- 90 range.
On treatment day #5 she was noted to have an elevated CK to 143 with a CK-MB of 14 and troponin of 0.23.
This was in the setting of acute renal failure with a creatinine of 5.5.
During this week she developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 5.5 with associated oliguria.
Electrolytes were monitored and repleted per protocol.
Strict intakes and outputs and serum chemistries were maintained.
She developed a transaminitis with a peak ALT of 111 and a peak AST of 139 improved to within normal limits at the time of discharge.
She developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of 7.1, improved to 3.0 at the time of discharge.
Her INR was elevated to 2.4 on treatment day #3; improved to 1.3 at the time of discharge.
Once IL-2 therapy was complete her blood pressure improved without further shock noted.
FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 80727**] will return in 4 weeks after CT scans to assess disease response.
