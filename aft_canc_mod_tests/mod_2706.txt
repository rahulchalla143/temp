A colonoscopy in [**Country 3399**] revealed an adenocarcinoma of his descending colon.
His hematocrit was 24.9 and his white count was 13,000.
A CT scan was performed which revealed a mass just anterior to the aorta as well as a dilated afferent limb consistent with obstruction of that limb.
A pullback, over-the-wire cholangiogram was performed which demonstrates free flow of the contrast column via the dilated afferent limb to the ligament of Treitz.
Non-visualization of new jejuno-jejunostomy which is thus presumed occluded.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2106-11-2**] 5:10 PM  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: eval for afferent loop obstruction Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 52 year old man s/ whipple now with obstructive [**Last Name (un) **], fevers, wbc REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for afferent loop obstruction CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
COMPARISON: CT of [**2106-10-26**] and percutaneous cholangiogram done the same day.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: Consolidation at the left lung base has improved with atelectatic changes still present.
The oral contrast material seen in this new bypass loop may be secondary to reflux from the gastrojejunostomy site.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: Patient has undergone interval descending colonic resection, with the anastomotic site seen in the left lower quadrant.
A tiny focus of air is seen in the bladder, likely due to recent catheterization.
Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were imperative in delineating and confirming the above findings.
Delayed nephrogram and mild hydronephrosis of the left kidney, likely due to functional ureteral obstruction due to lymphadenopathy in the retroperitoneum.
Pathology Examination  Name Birthdate    Age     Sex Pathology #     [**Hospital1 18**] [**Known lastname 60402**],[**Known firstname **]       [**2054-5-28**]    52 Male      [**-6/3940**] [**Numeric Identifier 60403**]  [**Doctor Last Name **].
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN1:  Metastasis in 1 to 3 lymph nodes (see note).
Cholangiogram was performed, demonstrated dilation of intrahepatic biliary system, patent hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis, but markedly dilated bowel loop.
A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire was then advanced into the hepaticojejunostomy and the Accustick sheath was removed and exchanged for a 8 French internal external biliary catheter that was placed over the wire with the loop formed in the bowel loop.
Studies compared to CT abdomen of [**2105-5-6**] which is post-Whipple.
Right kidney demonstrates no evidence of hydronephrosis.
If there is any uncertainty, a repeat CT could be performed.
2) Suboptimal evaluation of the liver.
A CT on [**10-26**] showed Abnormal soft tissue density mass in the pancreatic head surgical resection site, concerning for tumor recurrence.
He then went for a Biliary tube check on [**2106-11-2**] that showed non-visualization of new jejuno-jejunostomy which is thus presumed occluded.
Overall he was feeling better and his Total Bili was trending down.
His LFT's continued to trend down with a TBili of 1.9 on [**2106-11-12**] (Tbili was 7.1 on [**2106-11-3**]) and the drain therefore remained capped and secured to his side.
Pertinent Cultures: Blood cultures from [**10-25**] showed AEROMONAS SPECIES pan-sensitive.
Bile cultures from [**10-25**] showed ENTEROCOCCUS and from [**10-27**] showed ESCHERICHIA COLI and ENTEROCOCCUS.
Urine Cx from [**2106-11-2**] showed CORYNEBACTERIUM SPECIES (DIPHTHEROIDS).
