There was no history of trauma and at his PCP plain films and blood work were un revealing.
2 weeks ago he underwent an L-spine MRI because the pain had worsened and he was beginning to have mild tingling and numbness of his thighs.
These images were not concerning for cord compression or nerve entrapment but did reveal some bony abnormalities so he returned for a CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis last Thursday.

ABOVE T6 has full sensation, two point discrimination, light touch and temperature all intact.
Pertinent Results: MRI THORACIC SPINE [**2102-3-28**]: 1.
Further workup with dedicated chest CT should be considered if clinically indicated.
CT TORSO [**2102-3-28**]: 1.
Extensive bony metastases, involving the T3, T6 through T9, and L5 vertebral bodies.
On [**3-28**] CT of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis were obtained which ultimately showed multiple pulmonary nodules bilaterally with the largest being on the left.
His exam remained stable prior to surgery with decreased sensation to light touch below the T6 sensory level at the xiphoid process and inability to distinguish proprioception in bilateral lower extremities.
He went to the OR on [**3-31**] for a LECA T7-8 and fusion T5-11.
The patient continued to work with PT on [**4-3**] and his JP was still draining a large amount.
On [**4-4**] his JP was pulled and steri strips were placed.Staples in incision clean dry and intact.
It was noticed that his hematocrit was 20.7.  he was trasnfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit raised to 27.3.
Orthostatic blood pressures were also obtained which were normal.
CXRs showed slowly resolving LLL patchy infiltrate.
