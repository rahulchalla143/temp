[**8-24**] Ultrasound: Examination limited by extensive bowel gas, which may represent the source of the patient's distention.
[**8-25**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1.
Suboptimal evaluation of the spleen; while the appearance may reflect heterogeneous enhancement due to the phase of contrast, the possibility of infarcts should be considered.
EGD showed no bleeding from duodenal/ampullary mass or hematobilia.
He thus likely has a lower GI source, which is consistent with colonoscopy with blood throughout.
The following day ([**8-21**]) the patient was hemodynamically stable and had a Hct of 31 in the AM, yet her afternoon HCT was found to be 24 and confirmed on repeat.
His hematocrit remained stable 24 hours after.
An ultrasound identified mild ascites and increased bowel gas, and a CT abd/pelvis was performed, demonstrating pleural effusions and mild ascites.
A diagnostic paracentesis was attempted but could not be safely performed given the small amount of fluid.
His nodal blocking agents were slowly added back (diltiazem first), and he was discharged to continue all of his home blood pressure medications.
Cultures were negative at the time of discharge and should be followed up as an outpatient.
