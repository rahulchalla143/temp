On evaluation at the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1785**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the pt's VS were 100/60  120s-130s  42  85% 2L NC.
Pt was given 0.4 mg of morphine and 0.5 mg of ativan then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
His BP subsequencly decreased to 80/63.
Pt was placed on a NRB for his decreased sat and 3L of NS was infused with an increase in his SBP into the 90s.
Labs whoed a WBC count of 15/9, troponin of 0.35, CK of 176, and a CK MB of 8.
CXR was significant for a new LLL infiltrate suggestive for a PNA.
A cardiology consult was obtained and they felt the pt's elevated troponins were secondary to demand ischemia from ongoing sepsis.
Presumed lung CA metastatic to the colon- Pt was found to have mutiple polyps on colonoscopy in 01/[**2182**].
Repeat colonoscopy on [**2183-9-2**] whoed high grade dysplasia and CIS.
Right upper lobe nodule biopsy on [**2184-7-2**] was significant for undifferentiated carcinoma which was positive for CK 7, negative for CK 20, negative for TTF-1, and negative for LCA.
COPD- PFTs on [**2183-9-18**] were significant for a FEV1/FVC of 60%; FEV1 of 17%; and FVC of 28%.
CAD- ETT MIBI on [**1-/2181**] was significant for a moderate partially reversible inferior defect.
Echo on [**9-/2184**] was significant for a LVEF of >55%.
Exam on readmission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after a mucus plug on the floor: VS: 153/87 108 34 87% NRB Gen: diaphoretic, appears uncomfortable, no audible wheezing; respiratory distress with subcostal retraction HEENT: PERRL, EOMI Skin: bruising on neck, particularly L side Neck: shoddy LAD, could not assess JVD as pt refuses to be supine CV: tachycardic, regular, nl S1/S2, no murmurs appreciated Pulm: wheezes bilaterally, fair air movement; symmetric breath sounds Abd: soft, +BS, could not assess further as pt refuses to be supine Ext: compression stockings in place, [**1-29**]+ pitting edema, hands cool, but 2+ radial pulses, could not palpate PT or DP pulses [**12-30**] edema Neuro: answers questions appropriately, minimal conversation  Exam on day discharge: VS-82 kgs, T 97.5, HR 59-83, BP 100-130/50-60, RR 32-37, sats 98%/4LNC with humidified shovel mask Gen- Elderly man sitting in bed with HOB at 30 degrees.
Cardiac- RRR, s1 s2 distant.

Micro:   multiple negative sputum, blood and urine cultures this admission.
CXR ([**12-22**])- Shows stable cardiac and mediastinal and hilar contours.
CXR on [**12-28**] after mucus plug and sudden resp decompensation: HISTORY:  COPD.
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**12-25**] and 30: The right upper lobe is newly collapsed.
CXR on discharge: [**1-2**] COMMENTS:  Portable erect AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed, and compared with the previous study of yesterday.
His sepsis was most likely due to PNA but blood, urine, and sputum cultures wewre all negative.
His oxygen has been weaned down to 2L NC with stable sats.
Patient was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs for Hct of 24 on [**2185-1-4**], post-transfusion Hct 26.
All cultures were negative.
However, after his mucus plug, he has been requiring 4L NC for sats of 95%.
The diagnosis of PE was entertained, but a workup for PE could not be easily undertaken as a VQ scan would not be helpful in the setting of the pt's baseline lung disease and a CTA was avoided given a recent episode of ARF.
Chest xray revealed LUL collapse, and on bronchoscopy likely due to mucous plugging.
Repeat bronch showed secretions in LLL.
He requires 4L NC for his O2 sats to be 95% resting.
Chronic iron def anemia: His iron studies in [**11-1**] c/w iron deficiency anemia.
Basline HCT was 24 - 31.
He was transfused 2 units for a HCT of 24 to assist with O2 delivery.
He was on lovenox 150mg sc daily on discharge from last hospitalization for DVT in [**10-2**]  His lovenox was restarted [**2185-1-1**] as Hct stable at very low dose 50 mg SC daily.
8. hematuria - He had a breif episode of hematuria possibly [**12-30**] to supratherapeutic lovenox.
Depression - The patient is extremly depressed about his prognosis and social isolation.
He had a central line placed on [**12-29**] mainly for blood draws.
Communication - sister [**Name (NI) 17**] [**Name (NI) **] is his HCP.
