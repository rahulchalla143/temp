CMV Viral Load (Final [**2174-5-6**]): CMV DNA not detected.
ECG [**2174-4-18**]: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2174-4-2**] multiple described abnormalities persist.
CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast [**2174-4-18**]: FINDINGS: There is a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion, smaller in size compared to last CT torso.
Study is suboptimal for evaluation of solid organs due to lack of IV contrast.
Due to lack of oral contrast, evaluation for mesenteric lymph nodes is suboptimal.
CT PELVIS: There is free fluid in the pelvis - ascites.
No drainable fluid collection, however, evaluation is suboptimal due to lack of IV and oral contrast.
No definite bowel wall thickening, although the examination is suboptimal for such.
In correlation with the comparison CT torso, mediastinal lesion is less likely.
Renal ultrasound [**2174-4-20**]: FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.5 cm.
Scattered atypical lymphoid cells in a background of   reactive mesothelial cells  IR guided paracentesis [**2174-4-25**]: IMPRESSION: Ultrasound-guided diagnostic paracentesis, with a total of 200 mL of ascites removed.
TTE [**2174-5-2**]: The left atrium is mildly elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-4-1**], the findings are similar.
TTE [**2174-5-10**]: The left atrium is dilated.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-5-6**], ther pericardial effusion is now smaller.
Cardiac cath [**2174-5-5**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Pulmonary vascular resistance is elevated at 280 dyne-cm-sec5.
Pulmonary hypertension  LE ultrasound [**2174-5-13**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
TTE [**2174-5-16**]: The left atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-5-10**], biventricular systolic function is slightly worse.
Abdominal CT was unrevealing for any obvious source of her pain.
GI was consulted who recommended a SBFT which did not reveal any significant pathology.
Fluid was sent for culture which showed no growth and flow cytometry which showed no evidence of ALL recurrence.
# Anthracycline-induced/ GVHD cardiomyopathy:  EF <20% on echo from 2/[**2174**].
Torsemide was slowly reintroduced and uptitrated to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] which caused another bump in creatinine to 3.0, so renal and cardiology were consulted.
Renal ultrasound was unrevealing.
A repeat echo showed improved EF to 40-45% on the milrinone gtt.
She did well on milrinone and lasix drip, but the drip was stopped when her creatinine bumped to 3.0 and it was felt her volume status was near maximization.
Her milrinone was then discontiued and she was then transferred back to [**Hospital1 3242**] for further management of her abdominal pain and GVHD.
Repeat TTE prior to discharge showed an EF of 35-40%.
Given her depressed EF, her rising Cr was thought to be [**3-9**] volume overload.
She was actively diuresed on her milrinone and lasix drip with a total net negative of close to 9L.
This trended down to normal values and remained stable by time of discharge  # Leukocytosis: patient had uptrending WBC in setting of starting solumedrol, clutures were sent which revealed no growth.
# H/O Embolic Stroke:  Has new opening of PFO based on most recent echo which likely contributed to her recent stroke.
She was maintained on coumadin 4mg daily, but anticoagulation was held on day of paracentesis and remained subtherapeutic for several days, so she was maintained on a heparin drip to bridge her to a therapeutic INR [**3-10**].
She was maintained on a decreased dose of coumadin throughout hospital admission with INR within goal between 2 and 3.
We did a test to look at your small bowel which was negative.
You underwent a right heart catheterization and [**Known lastname 461**] to assess your heart function because worsening heart failure can cause fluid in your belly and worsening kidney disease.
A repeat [**Known lastname 461**] prior to your discharge showed that your heart function has improved somewhat and is stable.
We made the following changes to your medications: -Mycophenolate Mofetil 1000mg twice a day was started -Prednisone 60mg daily was started -Coumadin was decreased to 2mg daily -Torsemide was increased to 40mg daily -Please hold your valsartan until you see your cardiologist -Metoprolol succinate 100mg daily was started; please stop carvedilol -Bentyl (dicyclomine) was started for your abdominal pain -Simethicone was started for abdominal discomfort/gas -Your morphine was switched to long-acting Morphine 15mg twice a day -Bactrim single strength, 1 tablet daily, was started to help prevent infection -Acyclovir 400mg twice a day was started to help prevent infection -Allopurinol 100mg daily was started because your uric acid levels were high  Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
You will need to follow up at [**Hospital3 **] on Thursday, [**2174-5-19**], for an INR (coumadin level) check.
Please come to the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Center [**Location (un) 895**] for this lab test between 9am and 5pm.
