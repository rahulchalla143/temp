FINDINGS: The study was performed in conjunction with the speech and swallow pathologist.
Because of aspiration, the study was discontinued, suctioning performed via the tracheostomy tube by the Radiology nursing staff.
The oxygen saturation was checked at the end of the study, found to be 98%.

Pt was seen by our service during the previous admission for a PMV and swallow evaluation.
With regards to swallowing, the pt had FEES exam completed on [**2173-5-31**] that revealed "moderate pharyngeal dysphagia at with overt aspiration of secretions, thin and nectar thick liquids.
However, it was noted on the bronchoscopy completed on [**2173-8-21**] that there was "supraglottic edema" though the vocal cords looked "functional and normal in appearance".

We were initially consulted for a Passy Muir Valve, however the pt's prior h/o inability to tolerate the Passy Muir Valve with this current trach tube, the limited airspace around the trach tube such that the bronchoscope could not be advanced around the trach tube, and the current findings from yesterday's bronch that revealed supraglottic edema, subglottic edema and tracheal stenosis, it was felt that the pt would not be able to tolerate the PMV.
EVALUATION: The examination was performed while the patient was seated upright in the bed.
Pt required visual cues/models to follow commands for the oral motor exam given difficulty with the language barrier.
Video swallow study on [**2173-8-25**].
[**2173-8-25**] OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION EVALUATION: An oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed today in collaboration with Radiology.
Due to her trach which can not be capped with a Passy-Muir valve due to severe tracheobronchomalaica, she was unable to cough to clear material from the airway.
The study was stopped and nursing was called to deep suction the patient.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for Evaluation by Interventional Pulmonary on [**2173-8-20**].
Trach mask .40 95% sat.
Lioth d/c and levothyroxine 137 resumed.
Rigid bronchoscopy done in afternoon- superand intrglottic swelling, unable to change trach- see operative note for details.
