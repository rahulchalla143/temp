The nodule is somewhat ill- defined, and is nonspecific, but given the history of lung cancer, a 3 month follow- up chest CT is reccommended.
Air- fluid levels are demonstrated on the left lateral decubitus view.
The degree of dilatation of small-bowel loops appears slightly decreased compared to the study of [**2186-3-9**].
[**2186-3-9**]  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  INDICATION: 70-year-old man with history of lung cancer, now with nausea and vomiting, and loose stools.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Dense calcification of the intra-abdominal aorta increases in to bilateral iliac arteries.
Within the abdomen, note is made of multiple air filled loops of dilated bowel, which were also present on a recent CT of the abdomen of [**2186-3-9**], which described a small-bowel obstruction.
Please note that recent abdominal CT of [**2186-3-9**] described a small-bowel obstruction.

[**11-29**] blood cx are positive for septecemia, pt followed with surveillance cultures.
CT SCAN obtained.
A stat CT scan was ordered.
It was found that the pt had an increase of INR/PT - secondary to Cirrohsis.
Vancomycin HCl 1000 mg IV Q24H if random level <15 already approved -- changed frequency because of vanco trough; 6.
Please adjust vanco level according to blood draws.
