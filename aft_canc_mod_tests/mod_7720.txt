On presentation to the ED, initial vitals were 97.9 84 156/123 24 85% on RA.
CT Head was negative and CT c-spine showed spinous process fractures.
CXR showed old cardiomegaly and questionable LLL infiltrate.
Review of systems is not able to further be obtained due to language.

MRI c-spine [**3-26**]: 1.
No definite cord edema is identified, although the exam is somewhat limited on the fluid-sensitive sequences.
CXR IMPRESSION: 1.
Marked cardiac enlargement, unchanged, likely reflecting a combination of cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion, as seen on prior CT from [**2180-9-19**].
Retrocardiac opacity, which may reflect atelectasis.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-9-19**], the findings are similar.
Thought possibly due to Bactrim (given for pyuria) or low-flow state with SBP low 100s.
No hydronephrosis on CT scan, urine eos neg, renal U/S no acute hydronephrosis.
Will need close monitoring of INR.
Should not allow further supratherap levels due to cervical hematoma.
INR on day of discharge was 2.2  Continue digoxin  #.
Chronic diastolic heart failure:  she has known severe tricuspid regurgitation, RV overload, on [**Hospital1 3278**] echo as well as echo here.
Her lopressor dose was decreased this admission and imdur held to increase overall blood pressure and improve forward flow to her renal perfusion.
-she was initially tx with bactrim, urine culture grew E. coli ESBL but then final [**Hospital1 **] result returned and showed signs of contamination.
Third UCx showed 10,000-100,000 VRE but clinically pt not exhibiting signs of a UTI, is afebrile, nl wbc, no change in MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] dysuria, other urinary sx.
A final UA from [**3-30**] shows 2 wbcs, neg Leuk, neg nit, no bacteria or yeast.

Outpatient [**Name (NI) **] Work Pt will need her INR checked 2-3 times this week to ensure it does not become supratherapuetic.
Please check Cr, electrolytes twice this coming week to monitor renal function and ensure it continues to improve   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute renal failure Cervical spinal fracture Hypoglycemia resolved  Chronic kidney disease Atrial fibrillation Chronic diastolic heart failure Anemia   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: If you have fevers, chills, worsening neck pain, focal weakness, numbness or tingling of your extremities, please seek medical attention  Followup Instructions: Please follow with orthopedic spine at [**Hospital1 18**] as below: Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] XRAY (SCC 2) Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1228**] Date/Time:[**2181-4-9**] 12:40 Provider: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
