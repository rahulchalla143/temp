The history was obtained from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 174**], his HCP and [**Name2 (NI) 802**], as the patient is unable to recount a history.
Yesterday at 8:30 am, the patient called his [**Name2 (NI) 802**] stating that he was feeling unwell; she got there by 9:45 am and his blood glucose was 282.
She stated that his blood pressure which she had taken was fine (but did not remember the exact numbers).
A couple of hours later his blood glucose was 58.
When I saw him in the ER, he complained of a right retro-orbital headache, which he had when he was at the OSH.
His corneal reflexes are in tact bilaterally.

CT head [**2146-4-12**]; Unchanged right MCA infarction with unchanged partial hemorrhagic transformation.
CXR [**2146-4-11**]; No acute intrathoracic process.
TTE [**2146-4-14**] The left atrium is elongated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to extensive severe apical hypokinesis with focal apical dyskinesis.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Extensive apical left ventricular contractile dysfunction consistent with myocardial infarct  Carotid ultrasound [**2146-4-12**]; Less than 40 percent on both sides (prelim read), final read is pending  CT head [**2146-4-15**] (prelim)- no change in size of bleed.
final read is pending  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 86212**] is an 87 yo with multiple vascular risk factors, poorly controlled diabetes recently due to poor food intake.
He was monitored in the neurological ICU with q1h neurochecks and systolic blood pressure was allowed to autoregulate to 160.
A repeat CT head the following morning showed a stable infarct with hemorrhagic transformation.
EKG performed here showed paced rhythm.
A TTE showed no evidence of  and carotid ultrasound showed less than 40 percent stenosis on both sides (official read pending) The patient was started on aspirin and a statin.
His LDL was 96 and his HbA1c was 8.6.
His agitation and inattention have been improving, and his examination is notable for mild left nasolabial fold flattening and possible left field cut.
He underwent repeat CT scan which showed no change in bleed.
CV; The patient was found to have an initial troponin of 0.43 with CK of 420 and MB of 9.
His EKG was paced.
His troponins trended down to 0.35 and 0.33.
A TTE showed no evidence of clot or PFO.
His home [**Last Name (un) **] was resumed after allowing blood pressure to autoregulate for stroke in the acute setting.
His fingersticks were closely monitored and covered with regular insulin sliding scale.
A TSH was 2.7. .
Hematology; The patient had a HCT drop from 39 to 34 on HD #2.
His HCT will continue to be monitored daily.
His examination remained nonfocal but the patient did not return to baseline until the next morning.
His HCP is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 174**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 86215**] .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name **] ridge  Discharge Diagnosis: Right MCA stroke with hemorrhagic conversion   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive  Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation of stroke.
You had CT scan of brain which showed stroke on the right side of your brain.
You had cardiac ultrasound which did not show evidence of clot but did show apical hypokinesia.
