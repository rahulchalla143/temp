ICU COURSE - She was admitted to the ICU for CVVH in the setting of a mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis and an arterial pH of 7.57.
She received plasmaphoresis twice in the unit and serum Ig levels fell from 7.2 to 3.6 gm/dL.
MULTIPLE MYELOMA - Patient was started on cytoxan (1.2 g/m2)and prednisone (total of 80mg) on [**10-7**].
Her IgG on admission was 7208 and trended down with pheresis and stayed down after stopping it on [**10-13**].
The most likely treatment, after speaking with her outpatient Hematoncologist will be prednisone/melphalan/velcade.
RENAL FAILURE - Patient had myeloma kidney with possible RTA associated with myeloma.
Patient recovered her renal function and now has been on creatinine of 1.3.
LIVER DYSFUNCTION / LIVER MASSES - Patient with HCV serology positive at OSH, but negative here and negative viral load.
Ultrasound showed multiple masses, that were corroborated by MRI.
Bilirubin trended down from 5.2 to 3.3, but today was 4.2.
COAGULOPATHY - Patient had low platelets, high INR and low fibrinogen on admition, which were thought to be due to liver dysfunction.
Patient discharged with normal INR, PLT and PTT without any evidence of bleeding and stable HCT.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**12-15**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Multiple Myeloma with liver infiltration Acute Renal Failure  Secondary Diagnosis Diabetes mellitus with baseline renal insufficiency (baseline 1.2) Hypertension s/p Hysterectomy Peripheral neuropathy Metal plate in foot   Discharge Condition: Stable, breathing comfortably on room air, walking, eating, with baseline kidney function.
You had USG, and MRI of your liver, which showed multiple masses and were inconclusive, so we had to perform a transjugular liver biopsy (through the neck), which showed infiltration of the myeloma to your liver.
