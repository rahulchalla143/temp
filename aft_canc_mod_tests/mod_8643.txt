If Bleeding scan negative and unable to do IR, continue golytely prep and will re-attempt colonoscopy.Transfusion support.
Clots of blood were seen throughout the colon all areas were washed and there was no active bleeding Impression: Ulcer in the proximal ascending colon Clots of blood were seen throughout the colon all areas were washed and there was no active bleeding The area of the ulcer was about 3 cm from the ileocecal valve.
If rebleeds will discuss with surgeons utility of repeat endoscopy versus surgery.
Impression: 1 mm spot in the Transverse duodenum Polyp in the duodenum Fluids in stomach   Brief Hospital Course: 80 y/o with PMH sig for CAD s/p 1 vessel CABG, EF 15%, recent admit for GIB [**9-7**] for GIB requiring 1 U PRBC.
The EGD showed mild gastritis and the colonoscopy showed 3 sessile nonbleeding polyps in ascending colon s/p hot snare single piece polypectomies (path showed adenoma) .
1) GI bleed: In ED, found to have initial HCT of 35.4; INR 1.7, Pt was initially HD stable but then dropped his SBP to 70s-->repeat HCT was 28.
Initially hemodynamically stable, but became hypotensive to BP 70's at 4 am, Hct drop to 28.
Improved w/ IVF bolus 500 cc to BP 130's, then trended down again to BP 90's.
Pt was admitted to ICU at 6 am and was hemodynamically stable w/ BP 110's s/p 1u RBC and 1u FFP.
He got 2nd u RBC and 2nd u FFP.
On [**9-15**], pt had a colonoscopy that was unsucessful [**1-6**] too much bleeding.
He went for tagged RBC scan which localized bleeding to the RUQ.
His hct was montired closely after this .
His hct trended downward with rebleeding occuring on [**9-18**], DDAVP given [**9-18**].
A repeat colonoscpy was done at that time and an 8mm nonbleeding ulcer ~3cm from ileocecal valve was bicapped, injected with epi and dye.
Since colonoscopy, his Hct and hemodynamics remained stable.
PPt hematocrit was  followed Hct closely.
An EGD was done on 10/ 19 which did not reveal any additional bleeding source.
While on plavix, his Hct continued to be stable and even rose slightly.
PUMP: Anti-htn agenets were on hold including ace, bb, amlodipine, nitrates.
His carvdelilol and ace inhibitor were restarted after he remained hemodynamically stable with stable HCT for several days.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: GI bleed (requiring 20unit PRBC transfusion) blood loss anemia renal failure   Discharge Condition: afebrile, hemodynamically stable, tolerating full diet, ambulating without difficulty (cleared by PT) hematocrit stable for over 4 days   Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Please return to the emergency department immediately if you have any signs of bleeding including red blood with stools, maroon or black stools, lightheadedness, weakness, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other worrisome symptoms  Followup Instructions: Please contact Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2204**] on Monday morning [**9-26**] for an appointment early next week.
Please be sure to have your blood level (hematocrit) checked at that time as well as your chemistries.
Please be sure to discuss the restart of your heart and blood pressure medications (aldactone, amlodipine, imdur) with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
