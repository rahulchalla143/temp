Direct visualization by colonoscopy is recommended after acute symptomology resolution for further evaluation.
CXR ([**2167-3-21**]) - FINDINGS: Minimal linear opacities are present in the left base and may reflect atelectasis or scar.
Colon Mucosal Biopsies ([**2167-3-25**]) - A.  Transverse colon:     1.
Immunohistochemical stain for CMV was negative in parts A and C  GI Bleeding Study ([**2167-3-30**]) - IMPRESSION: Active bleeding first occurring at 67 minutes in the area overlying the pelvis between the iliac arteries, although localization to a portion of the bowel was not possible.
GI Bleeding Study ([**2167-4-4**]) - IMPRESSION: No active bleeding seen during the duration of the exam.
Stress Test ([**2167-4-14**]) - IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.

Echo ([**2167-4-16**]) - The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %).
Compared with the report of prior study (images unable to be reviewed) of [**2166-7-4**], biventricular systolic function, the severity of mitral regurgitation, and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure have worsened.
CTA Chest ([**2167-4-17**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
Suboptimal examination for evaluating segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries.
Incomplete evaluation of known widespread pulmonary carcinoid metastasis, due to respiratory motion and presence of effusions with compressive atelectasis.
MRI T Spine ([**2167-4-17**]) - CONCLUSION: Technically limited study.

# GI Bleed/CMV colitis: Pt has had progressively bad bloody diarrhea with recent admission for a similar presentation.
This was initially felt to be most c/w his presumed Crohn's diagnosis as carcinoid does not cause bloody diarrhea and his stool cultures were negative including c diff x3.
Due to continued bloody diarrhea, on [**3-25**], pt had a sigmoidoscopy which showed diffuse ulcerations, cobblestoning, erythema, and friability extending to the distal transverse colon c/w severe Crohn's disease as well as diverticulosis of the descending colon and sigmoid colon; 4 biopsies were taken which were negative for active CMV.
On [**3-31**], pt underwent CSCY which was notable for a bleeding vessel in the sigmoid colon which was injected.
On [**4-4**], pt underwent a bleeding study that showed no active bleeding.
On [**4-6**], pt went to angio and found to have an intermittently bleeding branch of the left colic artery but too tortuous for intervention thus pt taken to OR on [**4-7**] and underwent L. colectomy with colostomy with specimen sent to pathology which returned positive for CMV inclusions.
His CMV viral load improved and he was transitioned to PO valgancyclovir.
Swab cultures were sent and grew MRSA.
[**Date Range **] cultures were drawn off of the PICC, and then it was pulled.
Of note, the patient's PICC tip grew pseudomonas; however, because this did not grow in any [**Date Range **] cultures, it was felt to likely be a contaminant.
# CMV Viremia:  ID was consulted on [**4-11**] and recommend CMV VL which returned at 39, 900.
He was initiated on IV ganciclovir and had a negative opthalmology exam for retinitis.
Of note, pt also found to have a CD 4: 91 (14%) with concern for possible CVID although he had a normal immunoglobulin profile.
He will get weekly CMV viral loads as an outpatient, which will be following by the infectious disease clinic.
CK values with within normal limits and thyroid panel was not concerning.
MRI T spine was limited but revealed no specific abnormality.
MRI L spine showed moderate right subarticular recess narrowing at L4-5 and mild left subarticular recess narrowing at L2-3 level, as well as soft tissue edema around the spinous processes in the lumbar region.
MRI pelvis was also performed and did not show any significant abnormalities (see above for full report).
Per neurology recs, anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] and anti-Yo antibodies were sent and were pending at the time of discharge.
His systolic [**Month/Year (2) **] pressue in the MICU ranged 90s-120s.
Troponins on admission were <0.01, positive [**4-13**] at 0.12 and downtrended to 0.06 [**4-14**].
A nuclear stress test was ordered that showed EF 20% (two years ago EF 50%) and an echo was done per cardiology request that showed biventricular dysfunction, EF 20%, MR/TR, RV volume/pressure overload (see below).
Follow-up cardiac MRI, showing improvement of his EF to 54%.
At the time of discharge, the patient's heart rate was stable on a regimen of metoprolol 25 mg tid.
CXR was notable for diffuse alveolar opacities c/w CHF and pulmonary edema.
A nuclear stress test was ordered that showed EF 20% but normal perfusion (two years ago EF 50%) and an echo was done per cardiology request that showed severe hypkinesis of LV (EF 25%), dilated RV w/ hypokinesis, RV pressure/volume overload, worsening MR (3+), moderate TR (2+) and moderate PA systolic HTN.
Troponins positive to peak of 0.12 as stated above and BNP not checked.
CTA was performed, which showed no evidence of PE but did show pleural effusions.
Thyroid studies were sent and were not concerning.
However, cardiac MRI was performed, which actually revealed an EF of 54%.
His O2 sats were WNL on RA.
His Hct trended down, and got total of 21u pRBC throughout his hospitalization (last transfused [**4-11**]).
Hct remained stable at the time of discharge.
# Thrombocytopenia: Developed thrombocytopenia [**3-27**] with a nadir of 19 on [**4-6**].
Platelet count improved and was stable at the time of discharge.
Perfusion scan did not show perfusion defects pointing against ACS.
Appears to be primary lung rather than GI source per old imaging and prior heme/onc notes.

You ultimately had a surgical removal of part of your colon, which revealed that you had a viral infection in your colon.
As a result, part of the incision was opened and packed by the surgical service.
