While his AFP was not particularly high (7.0), his LFTs were slightly abnormal with an alkaline phosphatase of 213, and increase of his AST to 397 and ALT to 98.
An ultrasound in [**Month (only) 1096**] showed a large 13cm mass in the right lobe of the liver of 13 cm.
Biopsy of this mass was read as consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.
Vital signs remained stable throughout procedure.

CXR post procedure: clear  [**2150-1-1**] CT of ABD/PELVIS IMPRESSION: 1) Large right retroperitoneal hematoma extending from the right groin and along the right flank.
In the setting of a noncontrast examination contrast given earlier in the day, this finding could be related to acute tubular necrosis.
Vitals were checked at that time and the patient was found to have a SBP of 74 by doppler.
A second peripheral IV was placed and a stat HCT was drawn.
An ABD/PELVIC CT was done which revealed a large right retroperitoneal hematoma extending from the right groin and along the right flank.
Vascular surgery was also consulted who agreed with the plan of serial HCTs and medical as opposed to surgical management at this time.
His HCT remained stable and he was transferred back to the floor.
A CXR, UA, blood and urine cultures were obtained.
