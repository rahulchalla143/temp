A laryngoscopy at the OSH showed severe narrowing of the subglottic area and CT scan showed a large laryngeal mass concerning for neoplasm.
An emergent trachestomy/bronchoscopy was done by the thoracic surgery team and biopsy of the mass were sent.
Of note, bronchial washings were sent which were positive for MSSA.
He was therefore started at cefazolin and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Attention to these on a three-month followup CT may be helpful.
The sub 5-mm left lower lobe nodules diagnosed on the chest CT are below the resolution of this chest radiograph.
...[**5-15**] BRONCHOSCOPY DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was consented and topical lidocaine was given in the oropharynx in the usual fashion.
The scope was not inserted past the vocal cords via that approach.
An endobronchial biopsy was taken x2 at the carina as well as on the right and on the left just distal to the trach.
There was some mild oozing after the biopsy which spontaneously resolved.
...[**5-17**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: No prior studies for comparison.
A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] guide2wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.
The micropuncture needle was exchanged for a sheath, and contrast run was performed which showed a prominent draining vein in the lower IVC.
The patient's hemodynamic parameters were monitored throughout.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
...[**5-31**] BARIUM SWALLOW STUDY: BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM: Optiray contrast passes freely through the esophagus.
Once this was determined, thin barium was also administered to the patient in AP and lateral views and again no aspiration or leak at the area of surgery was identified.
Another tumor which can occur in this area and mimic adenoid cystic carcinoma on a small biopsy specimen is a basaloid squamous cell carcinoma, although they usually show more atypia, mitotic activity and necrosis than we see in this case.
Larynx, subglottic, biopsy (A):         Carcinoma, most consistent with adenoid cystic carcinoma.
Lymph nodes, left neck level 3, dissection (B-C):         No carcinoma identified in nine lymph nodes (0/9).
Lymph nodes, left neck level 2, dissection (D):         No carcinoma identified in two lymph nodes (0/2).
Immunohistochemical stains performed on a section of tumor show the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin cocktail (AE1:AE3/CAM 5.2), smooth muscle actin, calponin, and p63.
CEA (unabsorbed) shows rare positivity of some squamous cells as well as rare ductal-type structures.
Based on the tumor morphology and results of the immunohistochemical studies (particularly cytokeratin and actin positivity), this tumor is interpreted to be an adenoid cystic carcinoma with squamous differentiation.
A CT trachea was done which confirmed a 4mm x 8mm proximal tracheal intraluminal mass.
He was immediately started on a heparin drip with a goal PTT between 60 and 80 for the pulmonary embolus.
A bronchoscopy was one by the IP service showing diffuse posterior pharyngeal tissue infiltration and diffuse tracheal thickening by ultrasound.
In preperation for the procedure, b/l lower extremetiy ultrasounds were done to search for a cause for the pulmonary embolus.
In addition a medicine consult was obtained for preoperative risk assessment.
No further testing was recommended, however they recommended restarted the heparin drip postoperatively once surgically safe and to discharge him on lovenox.
Regardless, a total laryngectomy was felt to be the necessary treatment.
He then developed atrial fibrillation with RVR, with a rate of 150-200.
He was then given IV diltiazem and became hypotensive with a SBP of 70.
He was transferred to the ICU where he was started on an amiodarone gtt and given several fluid boluses with good blood pressure response.
Potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels were checked daily after the episode of atrial fibrillation.
His potassium level ranged from 3.6-3.8 requiring potassium supplementation daily.
A barium swallow study was obtained at this time which did not show an esophageal leak or tracheoesophageal fistula.
