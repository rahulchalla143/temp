GRAM STAIN (Final [**2138-6-29**]):       1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2138-7-1**]):       STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 59 year old diabetic man with related neuropathy, recent toe deep infection to the bone with underlying osteomyelitis (recent wound culture by his podiatrist grew Ecoli that was resistant to everything except aminoglycoside and one cephalosporin; he was empirically treated with few days of Ciprofloxacin, Clindamycin, and Augmentin), hypertension, hepatitis B/C, and monoclonal gammopathy, who presented with severe hyperkalemia and acute renal failure of unclear etiology (initially).
Urine sediment showed muddy brown casts suggestive of ATN.
Several serologies were ordered including complement levels, RF, [**Doctor First Name **], Cryoglobulin, SPEP/UPEP, hepatitis serology, and biopsy was planed (he has horseshoe kidney on the MRI).
However, his urine toxicity screen was positive for cocaine (patient was in denial).
His last HD treatment was on [**2138-6-30**], and his renal function was monitored for several days afterward.
His creatinine improved slightly, but his BUN increased.
Purulence was noted on examination but he was afebrile without leukocytosis or systemic symptoms.
