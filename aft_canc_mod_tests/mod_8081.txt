She had an urgent computed tomography angiogram of the chest which demonstrated large bilateral pulmonary emboli in both pulmonary arteries and a question of pulmonary infarction.
The patient's blood pressure dropped from 105 systolic to 95 but returned to 105 with a 1-liter bolus.
She remained hemodynamically stable and was brought to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further heparinization and treatment of the pulmonary emboli and diabetic ketoacidosis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed her temperature was 98.8, her blood pressure was 110/48, her pulse was 99, her respiratory rate was 22, and she was saturating 99% on nonrebreather.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed a hematoma of 3.5 cm X 2 cm on the right forehead, soft, anicteric.
Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardic but regular.
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ and symmetric.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Creatinine kinase was 27.
Troponin was less than 0.01.
Glucose was 584.
Sodium was 134, her potassium was 3.8, her chloride was 95, her bicarbonate was 17, her blood urea nitrogen was 13, and her creatinine was 0.9.
Urinalysis revealed small blood, greater than 100,000 glucose, and ketones of 150.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with a rate of 104.
A chest x-ray revealed the lung fields were clear.
A computed tomography angiogram of the chest and computed tomography of the pelvis revealed filling defects bilaterally in the mid pulmonary artery, a small opacity in the left lower lung, question of pulmonary infarction, small mesenteric lymph nodes, and enlarged fibroid uterus (measuring 11.4 cm X 11.7 cm).
Compression ultrasonography of the lower extremities demonstrated occlusive thrombus of the left popliteal vein and left lesser saphenous vein.
An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2111-10-30**], which demonstrated good overall left ventricular systolic function with an EF of greater than 55%, mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with severe global right ventricular hypokinesis.
Based upon her hemoglobin A1C of 13.5, it is likely that she has been hyperglycemic for the last few months.
