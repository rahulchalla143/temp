Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably mildly depressed(LVEF= 40 -45%).
A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-1-2**], the LVEF appears improved.
If indicated, a repeat TTE with echo contrast (Definity) or cardiac MRI may better assess regional/global LV systolic function and exclude apical thrombus.
Chest X-Ray, study Date of [**2172-1-26**] 10:35 AM Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid low SVC.
Microbiology: [**2172-1-25**] 2:15 pm URINE     Site: CLEAN CATCH URINE CULTURE (Final [**2172-1-27**]): GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIA.
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2172-1-28**]): Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
Had intermittant chest pains which were somewhat different from her chronic chest pain.
Troponins were checked and ECG was unchanged from her prior.
Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine 1.1 on [**2172-1-18**] and was 3.5 on admission.
She was volume resuscitated with 6L and her creatinine normalized to 1.0 prior to transfer to the floor.
Neurofibromatosis Type 1.
History of malignant nerve sheath tumor (s/p removal from left anterior chest wall [**6-18**] and radiation [**2172**]).
