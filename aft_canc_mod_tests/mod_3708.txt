Recent MRI ([**2175-9-22**])demonstrated an increased lesion (2 x 3 x 2cm) with extensive edema and mass effect on the motor strip.

Recommend MRI for further evaluation.
MR HEAD W/CNTRST [**2175-10-10**] FINDINGS: Right frontal lobe mass is identified with surrounding edema as on the previous MRI of [**2175-9-22**].
IMPRESSION: Limited study by motion.
MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST [**2175-10-12**] FINDINGS: There is a large heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right frontal lobe which measures 3.8 x 3 cm.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2175-10-13**] FINDINGS: There has been interval resection of the right frontal mass with postoperative pneumocephalus and small amount of cortical hyperattenuation which could reflect minimal postoperative blood products.
There is persistent vasogenic edema spanning the right frontoparietal convexity and extending into the right thalamic, mid brain, and anterior temporal regions, the extent of edema is minimally larger than the prior study and may relate to recent intervention.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST f [**2175-10-13**] FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the patient has undergone resection of the right frontal lobe enhancing mass.
She was also observed to have had a seizure, which was treated with ativan and resolved.
Post-operatively she had a head CT and she returned to the ICU.
