On CT Chest she was found to have a large mediastinal mass deviating the trachea to the right, heterogeneous in nature suggestive of goiter with left hilar LAD and left lower consolidation with air bronchograms suggestive of post obstructive pneumonia.

Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of a large vascular left thyroid nodule without immediate complication.
CXR admission: IMPRESSION: Improving left lower lobe atelectasis.
Followup chest radiographs are recommended to document complete resolution.
CT Torso admission IMPRESSION: 1.
Diagnostic considerations include a large thyroid mass or multinodular goiter with retrosternal component, much less likely a thymic lesion.
Further evaluation with bronchoscopy is advised to exclude an endobronchial lesion or extrinsic compression at the left hilum.
If indicated, further assessment could be performed with a dedicated renal ultrasound.
Head CT [**11-13**]: 1.
If there is high clinical concern, further characterization with contrast enhanced MRI or CT is recommended.
Left upper ex U/S [**11-18**]: DVT involving both brachial veins and the basilic vein along the catheter.
Thyroid biopsy [**11-25**]: Left thyroid, biopsy: Papillary carcinoma, follicular variant .
Right upper ex U/S [**11-30**]: Deep venous thrombosis of the right upper extremity isolated to the right internal jugular vein surrounding the patient's central venous catheter.
# Mediastinal Mass: Head/Torso CT negative for possible metastatic disease, although done without contrast.
Then, during trach placement, had biopsy which showed papillary thyroid cancer, follicular type.
HIT ab neg x2.
Coumadin: [**11-28**] 2.5mg, [**11-29**] held, [**11-30**] 5mg.
INR 1.5 on [**12-1**].
Plan: bridge with heparin and continue with coumadin until INR [**2-26**].
Monitor INR closely - Please pull right IJ CVL when heparin gtt no longer needed since it has a clot alongside it.
Last day of vanc was [**11-23**] and platelets have already rebounded.
Consider increasing as BP and renal function tolerates.
Creatinine at 1.2 on discharge.
