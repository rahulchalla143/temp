The patient only recalls that his blood sugars were elevated on the night before admission, that he got up to go to the bathroom around 1 am, and remembers waking up around 8 am in the bathtub covered with stool.
Head CT at the [**Hospital 78319**] hospital showed a large mass in the right frontoparietal area 2.5 cm in diameter with vasogenic edema.
A chest X-ray and chest CT showed a tumor in his R lung.
He underwent a bronchoscopy at an OSH, which was complicated by hemorrhage.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1170**] on [**2110-5-7**] to have the broncoscopic biopsy with bronchial stent placement.
Pathology showed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with ulceration, necrosis and lymphovascular invasion.
Subsequent PET/CT showed the lung tumor together with brain metastases.
A bronch on [**6-10**] showed that the stent had migrated proximally.

These findings have previously been evaluated by CT of the chest, and correlation with that study recommended for more complete assessment.
Triplanar post-Gadolinium spin echo T1-weighted images and axial post-Gadolinium MP-RAGE of the head were obtained.
This appears to have minimally increased in size since the prior study from [**2110-6-11**].
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).

Head CT at the [**Hospital 78319**] hospital showed a large mass in the right frontoparietal area 2.5 cm in diameter with vasogenic edema.
He was evaluated by the neurosurgical service on this admission, and underwent a steriotactic brain biopsy of a right frontal parasagittal mass on [**6-23**], which showed a  poorly differentiated metastatic carcinoma on pathologic evaluation.
CT revealed worsening right frontal vasogenic edema with new foci of parenchymal and possible subarachnoid hemorrhage and 13-mm leftward subfalcine herniation.
He underwent repeat head CT on [**2110-7-2**] demonstrating no new bleeds and mild improvement in edema.
He was encouraged to continue these measures at home and to have his sodium checked by his PCP.
His infectious workup was notable for coagulase negative staph in two out of two blood cultures on [**2110-7-3**].
Follow-up cultures were negative.
TTE was w/o evidence of endocarditis.
His positive blood cultures were attributed to contamination from his skin.
