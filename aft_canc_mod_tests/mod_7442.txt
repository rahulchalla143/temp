The patient was subsequently referred to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room and admitted on [**2124-12-9**], for workup of suspected upper gastrointestinal bleed.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.2, blood pressure 112/51, heart rate 57, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 95% on room air.
Heart examination demonstrated a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 S2, and a II/VI systolic murmur.
Respiratory examination demonstrated lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, with diminished sounds at the bases.
Abdominal examination was soft, with minimal protuberance, nontender, no palpable masses.
Rectal examination demonstrated brown stool, strongly guaiac positive, no palpable masses, and normal tone.
Neurologic examination was alert and oriented x 3, appropriate.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 9.1, hematocrit 23.6, platelet count 780.
Sodium 134, potassium 5.4, chloride 103, bicarbonate 20, BUN 47, creatinine 1.6, glucose 46.
A previously-drawn Helicobacter pylori test was antibody negative.
PT 12.7, PTT 29.2, INR 1.1.
An endoscopy conducted the evening of admission demonstrated a normal esophagus, melena in the antrum and stomach body, and a single acute cratered bleeding 7 mm ulcer in the distal bulb of the duodenum, with edema of the surrounding walls and a narrowing of the lumen.
The patient was followed with serial hematocrits every four hours through the evening of admission, into hospital day number one, during which time the patient required two additional units of packed red blood cells to be transfused, resulting in a hematocrit of 27.3 on the morning of hospital day number one.
Given this inappropriate response to four units of packed red blood cells transfused, the patient received continuous every four hour hematocrit checks through hospital day number three.
Serial studies conducted throughout the course of hospital day number three and four demonstrated stabilization of the patient's hematocrit at approximately 31.7.
A follow-up evaluation by the Gastroenterology service noted the patient to be doing well, in stable condition, and advised continued oral Protonix therapy twice daily for at least eight weeks, with once daily therapy thereafter.
