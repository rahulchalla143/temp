Bronchoscopy [**2166-4-9**] 5.
She initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2-/2166**] with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting from an OSH.
A CT scan showed a multicystic pelvic adnexal mass.
She was diagnosed with ovarian adenocarcinoma during that admission along with a PE and was started on lovenox.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ACS service for further evaluation.
The option for surgery was discussed with patient and family; opted not to do it at this time and underwent CT guided IR drainage [**2166-3-31**].
- CT abd/pelvis revealed an 8.5cm multicystic pelvic mass arising from the adnexa, as well as simple ascites.
- Transvaginal ultrasound guided biopsy [**2166-3-5**] confirmed primary ovarian adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, grade 1.
PMH: - Ovarian adenocarcinoma as detailed above - PE diagnosed on [**2-/2166**] on enoxaparin - Hypertension - Hypercholesterolemia - Overactive bladder/incontinence - Knee arthritis - Pneumonia [**1-/2166**] - Colonoscopy ~7 years ago, normal per patient - Annual mammographies normal per patient .
PSH: - Knee arthroscopy - Cataracts  Social History: Has several supportive children in the area, and an extensive social network.

[**2166-4-21**] Abd/pelvic CT: IMPRESSION: 1.
The right calf veins could not be evaluated on this study due to calf edema.
Given that the left upper lobe opacity has persisted over two months, an underlying malignancy cannot be excluded.

OSH CT: (report in OMR from ob gyn admission note from past [**2-/2166**] admission): Small L pleural effusion, atelectasis vs. scarring in RML/lingula, abnormal adnexal region/uterus, 8.5cm irregularly shaped cystic focus with nodular enhancing margines in the L adnexa.

Cultures from the abscess drainage grew coag-negative Staph, Enterococcus, and yeast.
Hypoxemia persisted and a CXR showed a persistent LUL infiltrate, unresolved from a pneumonia treated the month before as well as a left pleural effusion.
Concern for unusual organisms, resulted in Pulmonary consultaton, repeat CT, thoracentesis (1.3L from the left-sided effusion), bronchoscopy, and transfer to a negative pressure room for rule out of TB.
A PPD with Candidal Ag control were placed and a quantiferon gold assay was indeterminate.
She was treatd with further diuresis and lower extremity doppler U/S was negative.
CXR revealed reaccumlation of her left pleural effusion and mild right pleural effusion.
Her hypoxemia improved to her previous baseline - 93-94% on 3L O2.
Repeat C. difficile toxin assays and PCR were negative and she was treated supportively with banana flakes in her tube feeds and loperamide.
Repeat abdominal pelvic CT revealed that the drain was in place and the abscess was resolving and much decreased in size.
Blood cultures and C. diff toxin negative.
Coag-negative Staph, Enterococcus, and yeast grew in abscess culture.
It is not clear how long abscess drain will need to stay in place and will be dependent on follow-up abdominal/pelvic CT post discharge.
Pleural fluid culture has been negative, but cytology was POSTIVE FOR ADENOCARCINOMA.
The persistent LUL infiltrate on CXR may be a malignant process given that it has not resolved on broad spectrum antibiotics and pulmonary workup has been negative for infection although a tissue diagnosis has not been pursued.
CT scan showed development of a new organizing fluid collection.
She will have a repeat CT 10 days after discharge and be seen in surgical follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**] (GYN ONC) for consideration of further management.
Stool for H. pylori antigen clearance is pending.
# Hypoxemia: Repeat CXR showed worsening LUL infiltrate.
Repeat CT showed persistent LUL infiltrate, new effusions, and pulmonary nodules.
Bronchoscopy with BAL was performed on [**2166-4-9**] with negative cultures.
The etiology of worsening hypoxemia requiring a brief 2 day [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission [**Date range (1) 90111**] was likely  multifactorial: LUL infiltrate, recent PEs, atelectasis, splinting from right abdominal pain s/p J tube placement, recurrent malignant pleural effusions.
Her baseline oxygenation is stable at ~ 93% on 3 liters O2 nasal cannula.
Wound team reconsulted for further recommendations prior to discharge.
# Lower extremity edema: Lower extremity doppler U/S negative for DVT.
Stool guaic was positive as expected with a perforated duodenal ulcer.
Transfused 1U RBC [**2166-4-5**], [**2166-4-9**], [**2166-4-10**].
# HTN: Anti-hypertensives held for BP lower than baseline in setting of infection.

An abdominal abscess formed from the perforation and needed a drain placed to help clear the infection along with IV antibiotics and G-CSF (Neupogen), a medication to help produce white blood cells, as your white blood cell count was initially very low due to chemotherapy.
A CXR and CT scan of the chest both showed that the pneumonia from your last admission had not cleared and you had fluid around the lungs.
Tests of the fluid showed that it has cancer cells in it.
You also had a bronchoscopy of your lungs that did not show evidence of infection.
You will need to remain on antibiotics until the abscess and ulcer resolve, as determined by future CT scans (ideally with oral gastrograffin to evaluate the ulcer perforation; contrast through the J-tube will not reach this location).
