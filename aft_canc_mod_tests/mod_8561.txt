This a.m. the patient was tachypneic with O2 saturations 92% to 94% on room air with respiratory rate in the 40s.
with heart rate 124, blood pressure 110/50 and respiratory rate 40 with O2 saturation 97% on nonrebreather.
The patient was started on BIPAP with pressure support of 10, positive end expiratory pressure of 10 and O2 of 100%.
Subacute bacterial endocarditis with Enterococcus faecium, currently on intravenous ampicillin (no transesophageal echocardiogram was done at diagnosis in [**2153-4-23**] at [**Hospital6 2910**]).
?, pulse 90 to 120, blood pressure 107 to 170/59 to 100, respirations 36 to 44, O2 saturation 99% to 100% on nonrebreather.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES:  White count 40.7 with 76% neutrophils, 5% bands, 9% lymphocytes, 10% monocytes, hematocrit 41.6.
Hemoglobin 13.8, MCV 94, platelets 744, INR 1.3, PT 13.4, PTT 24.6.
Chem-7:  Sodium 142, potassium 3.9, chloride 105, bicarbonate 17, BUN 44, creatinine 1.6, glucose 152, anion gap 20.
Urinalysis with yellow cloudy urine with specific gravity 1.025, moderate blood, positive nitrite, large leukocyte esterase, 30 protein, small bilirubin, 10 red blood cells, greater than 50 white blood cells and moderate bacteria.
Arterial blood gases 7.26, 42, 125, 20.
Blood cultures pending.
Urine cultures pending.
Electrocardiogram atrial fibrillation at 124 beats per minute with left axis deviation, new T-wave inversions in 1 and L.  SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  In brief, the patient is an 85-year-old white male with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve manipulation of unclear nature, recent Enterococcal subacute bacterial endocarditis currently on intravenous ampicillin, recent Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection, currently on vancomycin intravenous, dementia, presenting with abdominal distention secondary to sigmoid volvulus and respiratory distress.
The patient was followed closely with serial abdominal exams and remained with soft non tympanitic abdomen without any evidence of tenderness.
At time of dictation, the patient has Clostridium difficile toxin x2 which are negative and third Clostridium difficile toxin pending.
Stool cultures are pending at this time.
The patient had multiple blood and urine cultures drawn during this hospital admission.
Blood cultures remained negative at time of discharge and original urine culture grew out greater than 100,000 yeast.
Patient had indwelling Foley for greater than two weeks at time of admission and thus Foley was discontinued and repeat urinalysis was sent which was consistent with bacterial urinary tract infection.
Vancomycin was subsequently discontinued and blood cultures remained negative for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus as well as urinary cultures.
The patient's oxygen requirements rapidly decreased and the patient was able to tolerate room air by hospital day #2.
His respiratory status remained excellent with an oxygen saturation between 95% and 98% on room air.
He exhibited electrocardiogram changes, most notably rapid atrial fibrillation upon admission.
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarct with negative cardiac enzymes x3 with negative troponin I.
His digoxin level was subtherapeutic at time of admission and digoxin was initially held, as the patient was not taking po.
Digoxin was restarted on hospital day #2 and digoxin levels were followed.
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation with heart rate in the 60s to 80s.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient exhibited multiple electrolyte disturbances during this admission, likely secondary to voluminous watery diarrhea.
Documentation not available as to prior history of hypernatremia, however the patient had sodium ranging between 149 and 155 during this hospitalization.
It was felt that the electrolyte disturbances were secondary to large volume diarrhea, however with questionable history of polydipsia, urine osms were sent off to evaluate for possible diabetes insipidus.
Urine osms were appropriate at approximately 500, thus not consistent with diabetes insipidus.
RENAL:  The patient was in acute renal failure with elevated BUN and creatinine of 1.6 at time of admission.
At time of dictation, the patient's creatinine is 0.7 with BUN of 24.
Given urinary tract infection, the patient was left without placement of Foley catheter, however the patient's urine output needs to be closely monitored for possible urinary retention in future given his history and history of multiple urinary tract infections.

Note:  All blood cultures drawn during this hospitalization have been no growth to date at time of dictation.
