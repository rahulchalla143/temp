Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup and scope (EGD and colonoscopy)  1.
RUQ u/s was done and showed no e/o portal hypertension.
Hct and vital signs remained stable so patient was transferred to medical floor with plan for EGD and colonoscopy.
EGD showed gastritis but was otherwise normal.
However, colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis with evidence of fresh blood in addition to sigmoid polyp; polyp was not intervened upon at this time due to evidence of current bleed (planned follow-up in several months for removal).
He was monitored and remained stable and was to be discharged; however, on day of discharge pt again had a bloody bowel movement with hct drop of 5 units (28 to 23).
Pt had CTA which showed findings suggestive of active bleeding within proximal transverse colon (see full report for details) however the patient stopped bleeding before intervention could be performed.
Pt was transfused and additional 2 units of blood and HCT rose to 27.8.
His hematocrit remained stable for 2 days.
His hematocrit was stable and no further bleeding.
Key follow up: He will need repeat colonoscopy in several months to remove polyp.
