IMPRESSION: Left frontal lobe lesion as described above, with surrounding vasogenic edema, sulcal and left lateral ventricular effacement, and 1-cm left to right midline shift, without significant change from outside hospital studies performed earlier this same date.
[**11-25**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**11-26**] CT Head: Stable hemorrhage.
CT head was performed in the ED, revealing a small ring-like hemorrhage with disproportionate edema, concerning for underlying mass.
Brain biopsy was planned and Mr. [**Known lastname 4587**] transferred from the Neurology to the Neurosurgery service.
Brain biopsy was uncomplicated and final pathology results were pending at the time of discharge.
Post op head CT revealed small hemorrhage along the biopsy tract.
Repeat CT in the AM of [**11-26**] was stable.
On CT scan of your brain a small hemorrhage was noted with a lot of surrounding edema.
Given your history of kidney cancer, a CT scan of your torso was performed.
Given concern for a tumor in your brain at the site of bleeding, a brain biopsy was performed.
