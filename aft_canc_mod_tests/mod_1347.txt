The symptoms apparently began this morning when his caregivers noted that he was "not himself".
EMS responded to the scene and found his heart rate to be in the 20s with a BP of 80s/P.
On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were 97.5, 36, 112/43, satting 99% on 4L.

# Bradycardia: Unclear precipitant but his baseline EKG showed RBBB and LAFB so any further conduction system degeneration would likely result in complete heart block, likely infranodal, which is more likely given his lack of response to atropine.
No signs of acute ischemia and cardiac enzymes were cycled to confirm.
Pt initially had temporary pacer wire placed after INR reversed with FFP.
# GI bleed: On [**11-23**] pt passed some guaiac positive dark stool with question of flecks of blood, in the setting of dropped hematocrit to 24.2 Pt remained hemodynamically stable and was transfused one unit of pRBCs.
He was held over the weekend for lowering of INR and prep for EGD and colonoscopy given unstable hematocrit and anticoagulation.
Monday with INR of 1.7, pt was taken for EGD which showed gastritis and duodenitis with biopsies taken, and also a colonoscopy with multiple polyps but polypectomy not done and pt recommended to have repeat scope with lower INR and better prep.
Pt's hematocrit remained stable and he did not have any more guaiac positive stools.
On discharge hematocrit was 27.9.
Recent MRI ([**9-11**]) showed microvascular ischemia.
No evidence of infection by fever or WBC, and neuro exam was unchanged throughout.
# Hyponatremia: Pt with sodium 131 on admission likely due to hyperglycemia, and resolved with control of BS.
Pt was medically managed with ASA, statin, ACEi, beta blocker once appropriate with blood pressure and renal function.
# CHF: Restarted on home doses of ACEi, lasix and BB once tolerated by blood pressure and renal function.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Bradycardia Dementia with transient Delerium Acute on Chronic Renal Failure Hypertension Acute on Chronic Congestive Heart Failure Peripheral Vascular Disease Acute Blood Loss Anemia   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You had a slow heart rate and a pacemaker was placed to keep your heart rate in a normal range.
Please get your labs drawn on Friday [**12-1**] and have the results called to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
You had a colonoscopy that showed multiple benign looking polyps.
The colonoscopy will need to be repeated with a better bowel prep and a INR of < 1.4 to remove these polyps.
the endoscopy of your stomach showed gastritis and you have been started on pantoprazole to take twice daily to treat this.
Furosemide and Lisinopril was unchanged Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
