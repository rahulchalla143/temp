A foley was placed (per notes 200 cc of urine came out) and he was given dilaudid with resolution of his pain.
He had a CXR and abd x-ray which were normal except for bony mets in the pelvis and degenerative changes in the spine.
He also had an L-spine MRI which was pre-liminarily negative for cord compression.
Neuro also recommended MRI of the C and T spines.
Prior to transfer here CT of the T and C spines were done which showed degenerative changes and spinal stenosis in c5-c6.
A head CT was also done b/c the patient became confused in the ER.
Head CT at that time was negative.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia.

MRI of the L-spine did not show evidence of cord compression or cauda equina compression.
Should also consider worsening prostate dz, perhaps radiation prostatitis which could be contributing.
-T and C spine MRI, no cord compression but diffuse metastatic dz.
MRI brain official dictation pending at discharge, but on discussion with neuroradiology, no dural enhancement and normal MRI brain.
-Foley to stay in -Pt has made decision not to pursue further chemotherapy or aggressive Rx.
Currently has benign abd exam and no sx of N/V/diarrhea/constipation.
CT abd negative for acute process.
Abdominal exam completely benign on discharge.
-cardiac enzymes not consistent with acute myocardial ischemia and ECGs unchanged.
*Initial Fever: w/u negative (bld cxs x2, urine cx, chest xray, abd CT scan, spine MRI, brain MRI) and resolved by the time I had met him without intervention.
*Chronic Backpain: Backpain chronic and likely [**12-22**] to spinal mets.
-[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10794**] met with pt.
-holding coumadin tonight due to increased INR 4.0.
*Comm: [**Name (NI) 16042**] witness/no blood transfusion.
Hold your coumadin tonight because your INR is high.
Restart your Coumadin tomorrow and follow up your INR next week at Dr. [**Name (NI) 24777**] office.
You will also need to have your platelet count checked (127) at time of discharge.
