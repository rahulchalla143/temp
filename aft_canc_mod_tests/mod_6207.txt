No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The interatrial septum is intact by 2d, Color Doppler and by agitated saline at rest and with Valsalva manuever.
The study is otherwise unchanged compared to prebypass.
