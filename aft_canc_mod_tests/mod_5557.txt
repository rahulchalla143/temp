L-SPINE (AP & LAT)  [**2163-1-6**] 3:09 PM FINDINGS: There are five non-rib-bearing lumbar-type vertebrae.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT  [**2163-1-6**] 2:38 PM  FINDINGS: Grayscale, color Doppler, Doppler waveform evaluation were performed of the left lower extremity.
FEMUR (AP & LAT) LEFT  and TIB/FIB [**2163-1-6**] 3:09 PM FINDINGS: Mineralization is within normal limits.
ECG ([**1-6**]) - A-fib@56, LAD, RBBB, Q's II/III/aVF.
MRI L-spine: IMPRESSION: 1.
There is increased T2 signal within the adductor and obturator internus muscles, left greater than right, and within left gluteus medius and minimus muscles.
We will be happy to complete the MRI of the pelvis at no additional charge; however, followup CT would be better to assess for fracture.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2163-1-15**] 5:33 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: Assess for CVA/bleed  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 75 year old man with h/o Afib and metastastic bladder CA, p/w lethargy and acute change MS REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Assess for CVA/bleed CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST  INDICATION: A 75-year-old man with history of atrial fibrillation, metastatic bladder carcinoma, presenting with lethargy and acute mental status change.
No CT evidence of major vascular territorial infarction, but MRI remains most sensitive for evaluation of acute ischemia.
RENAL ULTRASOUND: Comparison with [**2163-1-20**] nephrostogram and renal ultrasound, [**2163-1-16**].
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2163-1-14**], mild mitral regurgitation is not seen on the current study.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2163-1-18**]):       YEAST.
ECHO shows LVEF>35% Concern for urosepsis vs question new aspiration pna (may have aspirated while intubated for IR procedure).
Repeat RUQ US was negative for cholelithiasis.
# Anion Gap Acidosis: [**3-5**] uremia, lactic acidosis, attempted correct w/ CVVHD, vent settings.
CT of the head is without acute hemorrhage or stroke (although MR is more sensitive).
ABG 7.24/66/66.
# Left buttock pain, ilium fracture, history of bladder cancer: MRI L-spine and hip done on admission [**1-7**] demonstrated ?
CT scan performed [**1-7**] for better definition of lesion, concern for pathologic fracture.
On [**1-10**], CT scan reviewed, ortho/onc and rad/onc consulted.
Pt underwent CT guided biopsy of the bone lesion on [**1-14**] which showed metastatic bladder cancer.
In staging, bone scan had no further lesions, CT torso showed lesions in liver and nodules in lung.
Urine culture returned klebsiella and enterococcus (though only low grade).
#CHF, systolic [**Last Name (LF) 94658**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 30% ([**4-5**]): systolic dysfunction on repeat ECHO, LVEF 35%.
