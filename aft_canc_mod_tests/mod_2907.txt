At the VA: LDH 726, CT showed massive LAD in retrocrural nodes into upper abdomen involving celiac nodes; concerning for lymphoma.
He was prepared for biopsy of the area, but was unable to complete procedure secondary to discomfort (?chest pain).

3) Non-calcified pulmonary nodule measuring less than 5 mm in diameter, as described above, probably related to the prior granulomatous infection, however, please follow up these lesions on future CT scans.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Methenamine silver stain of the esophagus (slide A) is negative for fungi, with satisfactory control.
Immunostain of the duodenum (slide B) is negative for cytomegalovirus, with satisfactory control.
[**2100-11-27**]: CT abdomen:IMPRESSION 1.
A CT scan at WR was notable for lymphadenopathy concerning for neoplastic disease.
A repeat CT abdomen on admission was notable for extensive LAD, splenomegaly with a splenic lesion.
On [**2101-10-27**], CT guided core biopsy of spleen was notable for B cell lymphoma - DLBL vs Burkitts.
CT chest was done for staging which was notable for enlarged R hilum LN.
He then had a baseline TTE which suggested an LVEF of >55%.
A bone marrow biopsy was done which suggested T cell dominant lymphoid profile.
He was started on IVFs with [**12-23**] amps of bicarb + bicarb tablets for goal urine pH >7 and allopurinol.
When his urine pH was greater than 7, he was given his first dose of cytoxan 400 mg IV ([**2100-10-29**]).
The medications were separated in time because he was considered high risk for TLS because his LDH was 1100 and rising and he had Burkitts with a large tumor burden.
His LDH increased to max 2900 on Day 2 of Modified [**Last Name (un) **] protocol.
The frequency of TLS labs was decreased to q6hours.
On day 7, the patient noted an increase in his LUQ pain; a repeat CT of the abdomen showed necrosing tumor decreasing in size.
On day 9 he was started on IVFs with bicarb for goal urine pH >7.0.
He spiked to 102.4 overnight so he was started on cefepime, blood cultures/urine cultures were sent which were negative.
Stool cultures, cdiff and CMV were sent which were negative (cdiff negative x 3).
By mid morning of day 13, the patients blood pressures had decreased to 70s-80s/40s-50s and his HR increased to 120s.
An A-line was placed and he was started on levophed once in the unit.
CT abdomen was performed with oral contrast (through NGT b/c pt unable to tolerate contrast) due to concern for abdominal source, especially typhlitis.
His CT abdomen demonstrated some mild wall thickening in the cecum.
On day 14, he had coffee ground emesis overnight and guaic + stools so he was started on IV PPI.
Repeat stool studies were again negative.
Because the patient was no longer neutropenic, he was able to have an EGD which was notable for grade 1 esophagitis and diffuse nodularity of the mucosa of the duodenom.
The path from the biopsies were consistent with crypt abscess from drug vs infection.
CMV and fungal cultures were negative from the biopsies.
Flow was sent on the blood and it was found to not be consistent with Burkitts.
A repeat abdominal CT was done which was notable for stable mass in spleen, stable paraortic lymph nodes and no thickening of wall of small bowel.
The patient's cerebellar exam remained stable throughout and s/p the 4 doses of ara-c.
#Acute renal failure - In the setting of the patient's hypotensive episode, his creatinine increased to a max of 1.4.
His BUN increased to 24.
Due to concern for methotrexate toxicity (completed on [**11-6**]) and MTX level 0.36 on [**11-8**], especially in light of sepsis and potential third spacing of MTX, IV leucovrin was increased and hemodialysis was started.
His methotrexate level decreased appropriately, and no further hemodialysis was required.
A ruq ultrasound was normal and had normal venous flow.
The patients peak bilirubin was 8.1 with direct bili of 5.7 on day .
Hepatitis A, B and C serologies were sent which were negative.
The etiology of the hyperbilirubinemia was unknown, and with negative US and CT scan it was felt to be secondary to septic gallbladder (although peaked several days after the episode of hypotension occurred) vs methotrexate effect.
His bilirubin trended down to normal on the actigall.
It was felt that the ativan given for his nausea and his morphine pca could be contributing to his altered mental status so both of these were held.
The patients neuro exam was nonfocal during the episode.
His electrolytes were repleted as needed.
Temperatures of 100.4 and above should be considered a fever while your white count is low.
