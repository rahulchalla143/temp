MRI Brain [**11-7**]: Prelim read: Large decrease in mass effect of right cerebellar mass on fourth ventricle since MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**10-24**] with small improvement in mass effect seen since head CT of [**11-4**].
CT of thorax also performed given hx of smoking and possbile primary etiology being lung, thyroid, GI and renal which was unremarkable.
An exhaustive work-up was done including  several negative blood and urine cultures, chest-xray and lower extremity dopplers.
He had a repeat MRI which showed stable lesion with decreased swelling.
He was discussed at tumor board and it was decided to wean the steroids and have a follow-up MRI in [**1-12**] months to evaluate progression.
His exam upon discharge is significant for oriented to person and year, often not to place.
