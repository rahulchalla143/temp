Patiennt has a history of migraines followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and her currrent hedaches are not like this.
She had been recently changed from topiramate to nortriptyline with a resultant worsening of her headaches initially to 2x/month (from having no headaches in 6 months) and then later daily headaches which were different by their faster onset, particularly after lunch each day for the past 2 weeks.
She has had 2 ED presentations as a result of her headaches prior to her OSH admission on [**11-5**].
On [**11-1**] she was treated symptomatically and sent [**Last Name (un) **] after CT head was normal.
On [**11-2**], she had an LP on [**11-2**] which was unremarkable but no opening pressure was measured 4 RBCs <1 WBC Glc 62 Pr 19.
Head CT showed some right maxillary sinusitis and she was given azithromycin and again sent home.
Per patient report, on these occasions she was also significantly hypertensive with SBP 180s.
She was finally admitted on [**11-5**] after she had been profusely vomiting for 2-3 days and at that time was found to have significant hypertensive urgency in association with her headaches with BP 229/121.
Her neurological examination was unremarkable and she was admitted to the ICU at [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital and started on an IV nicardipine infusion which controlled her SBP to 160s.
She was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for MRV as [**Hospital3 1443**] did not have this facility and she had an allergy to CT contrast agents.

Patient had hypertensive urgency with SBP 220s/120s at OSH requiring IV nicardipine infusion and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**11-6**] for assessment and admitted to the neuro ICU.
On admission, patient had a normal general and neurological examination with no papilledema.
Patient underwent workup for secondary causes of hypertension with normal fasting cortisol and normal TSH.
Renin/aldosterone and serum catecholamines/urine metanephrines are pending at the time of writing.
Patient was started on verapamil for possible cerebral vasospasm secondary or Call-[**Doctor Last Name 8271**] syndrome and bupropion and citalopram were decreased and nortiptyline stopped given concerns of these medications' possible contribution to her clinical picture.
Patient proceeded to an MRI head with MRV/MRA to look for any evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or other cerebrovascular abnormality.
Her BP was controlled and she was weaned off nicardipine and transferred to the floor on [**11-7**].
After control of her BP, her headache improved only requiring simple analgesia.
