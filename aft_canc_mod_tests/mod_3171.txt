He later had another episode of VT at 12:40 and an amiodarone gtt was started.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were T98.2 HR75, BP149/106, RR32 100% on the vent.
A R femoral line was placed, he was given 1L IVF and had a head, chest, abdomen CT done without contrast.
CT scan showed a sternal fracture and mediastinal hematoma.

CXR ([**2117-1-16**]): Cardiomegaly with mild congestive heart failure.
CT spine ([**2117-1-16**]): 1.
Consider MRI for further evaluation if clinically indicated.
Non-contrast head CT ([**2117-1-16**]): NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation abnormality.
CT chest, abdomen, pelvis ([**2117-1-16**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
A renal ultrasound is recommended further evaluation.
ECHO [**2117-1-18**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-1-6**], left ventricular function has further deteriorated and the right ventricular cavity is more dilated with new free wall hypokinesis.
Based on his EEG result, non-arousal, and lack of brainstem reflexes except for overbreathing on the ventilator, Neurology suggested that meaningful recovery from the neurological standpoint is very unlikely.
His chest CT demonstrated mild pulmonary edema.
Sputum culture from [**1-18**] and [**1-21**] grew out Moraxella for which he was covered with ceftriaxone.
His electrolytes and acid/base status was stabilized after he was placed on CVVH.
Given that his his UOP improved and his electrolytes were stable off CVVH, and because of his poor prognosis, CVVH was discontinued.
His electrolytes were stable during the rest of the hospitalization.
# CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40% in [**12-15**], down to 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**2117-1-18**], likely further impaired by the cardiac arrest.
His ACE was held given renal insufficiency and his fluid status was managed as above.
# Leukocytosis: Patient presented with leukocytosis & grossly positive U/A, but elevated WBC may also be due to stress response to cardiac arrest.
Sputum cx was positive for Moraxella & blood cultures demonstrated coag negative staph.
