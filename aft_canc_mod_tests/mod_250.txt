She had a pericardial window placed on [**2175-5-18**] without any complications.
Postoperatively, the decision was made to re-initiate anticoagulation given her hypercoagulable state, but the therapeutic INR range was decreased to 1.5 to 2.
She was also started on an intravenous heparin drip with a goal partial thromboplastin time of 60 to 70 while her INR was subtherapeutic.
While she was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, she also had a barium swallowing study done to evaluate a questionable small amount of air behind the esophagus on her admission chest computed tomography.
The barium swallowing study was normal.
Subsegmental PE diagnosed in [**2175-4-18**].
Heparin drip (with a goal partial thromboplastin time of 60 to 70).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on transfer to the East Oncology/Medicine Service revealed temperature was 96.5, blood pressure was 114/64, heart rate was 102, respiratory rate was 14, and oxygen saturation was 99% on 2 liters.
Head and neck examination revealed sclerae were anicteric.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Extremity examination revealed trace edema but warm to touch.
Distal pulses were 2+.
Neurologic examination revealed awake, alert and oriented times three.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on transfer to the Oncology/Medicine Service revealed white blood cell count was 13.6, hematocrit was 25.5, and platelets were 485.
Prothrombin time was 13.6, partial thromboplastin time was 46.6, and INR was 1.2.
Sodium was 140, potassium was 3.5, chloride was 109, bicarbonate was 18, blood urea nitrogen was 13, creatinine was 0.8, and blood glucose was 142.
Calcium was 8.7, magnesium was 2.2, and phosphate was 3.7.
q.h.s., and her INR reached the therapeutic range.
Her hematocrit had slowly been trending down throughout her hospital stay, which was thought most likely secondary to her chronic disease.
She received 2 units of packed red blood cells, and her hematocrit responded nicely to the transfusion.
However, in the Postanesthesia Care Unit she acute respiratory decompensation with oxygen saturations down to 70s on room air.
However, the Neurology Service recommended a lumbar puncture to rule out meningeal carcinomatosis.
The decision was made not to pursue lumbar puncture since the patient was not a candidate for intrathecal chemotherapy.
