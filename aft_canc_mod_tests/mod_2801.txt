He had a chest CT overnight which showed --Perihilar lung mass measuring 4.0 x 2.9 cm causing occlusion of the lower lobe branches to the left main pulmonary artery, narrowing of the left proximal mainstem bronchus, and post obstructive consolidation.
A bronchoscopy was performed and no endobronchial lesions were seen.
The results of the pleural fluid cytology are still pending at the time of transfer back to [**Hospital 1281**] hospital so it is unclear as to whether the effusion was malignant(associated with lung CA) or [**1-13**] infection.
He was evalutated at the bedside by Dr. [**Name (NI) **] and the interventional pulmonary team using ultrasound which did not reveal any reaccumulation of pleural fluid at the thoracentesis site.
A cortisol level was drawn here and the level was markedly high, indicating the steroids can be tapered and removed.
