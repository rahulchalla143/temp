=============== AP UPRIGHT CHEST: There has been little change since the most recent prior study with poorly defined right heart border with adjacent patchy opacity.
===============  ECHO Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
=============== COMPARISON: CT torso, [**2165-10-1**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial imaging was performed from the thoracic inlet to the diaphragm following the uneventful administration of IV contrast.
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no central or main pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
However, the timing of contrast bolus, as well as respiratory motion significantly limits evaluation of the more distal branches and pulmonary parenchyma.
His symptoms improved and oxygenation remained stable.
His TSH was checked and was normal.
However, it was held after his platelets dropped below 50K.
ECHO was obtained and is copied in results section.
# Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia:  Patients platelet count was noted to trend down during his hospital course, and the rest of his blood lines also trended down.
Although this was felt likely due to his recent chemotherapy with carboplatin, his subcutaneous heparin was held and a HIT antibody was sent which was negative.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Hospital1 **]: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed.
