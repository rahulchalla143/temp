CT scan was obtained an revealed a large 10 cm right renal mass with extension into the IVC and infrarenal IVC.
MRI revealed extension of thrombus into the common iliac veins, exteind up to the suprarenal IVC into the hepatic venous structure.
She was referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 4229**] for evaluation of surgical options.
Past Medical History: PMHx - Right leg DVT in [**5-8**] - led to evaluation with abd CT on which  a 10cm right renal mass was seen.
Subsequent biopsy showed renal  cell carcinoma (clear cell) with IVC tumor thrombus extending to  the hepatic veins - Right renal cell carcinoma - s/p debulking nephrectomy (as in HPI) - Gestational DM - PSHx - C-section x3, tonsillectomy, vericose vein stripping  Social History: She is a second grade school teacher.

The intra-op course was complicated by cardiopulmonary arrest, exploration of the right atrium and right ventricle, and  cardiopulmonary bypass.
The patient received cardiac massage for  5-7 minutes and was on bypass for 10 minutes before regaining hemodynamic stability.
No further signs or symptoms of ischemia was found and further MRI studies were not warranted at the time.
