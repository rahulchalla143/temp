Further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
C-Spine CT IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI/MRA Head - IMPRESSION: Irregular ring-enhancing lesion is identified on the left parietal lobe, measuring approximately 1.6 x 1.9 mm in size in the axial projection, associated with extensive vasogenic edema and possible focus of calcification.
Once the MRI was performed (showing enhancing metastatic lesions in the left parietal and left frontal region) and the results for the ID screening came back, we believe the seizures were related to edema from her CNS metastasis.
