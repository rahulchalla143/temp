[**2105-2-13**] Sputum cx: RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2105-2-15**]):       OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA ABSENT.
IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON CULTURE # 204-4647O          [**2105-2-12**].
[**2105-2-10**] CT CHEST: The patient is status post left upper lobectomy.
A new, partially enhancing, 7 x 4 cm left paratracheal mediastinal mass with central hypodensity is likely necrotic tumor (unless the patient has had recent mediastinoscopy or transbronchial procedure, in which case some components could be hemorrhage; it has too much internal tissue structure for an abscess).
Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval expansion of the previously identified left main stem bronchus stent.
Per Infectious Disease recommendations, Bactrim was also started for stenotrophomonas grown from sputum culture, and Zosyn was disconinued on [**2-12**].
CXR at that time showed worsened collapse of the left lower lobe from the obstruction, and the patient was empirically restarted on Zosyn to for post-obstructive pneumonia and the stent was repositioned on [**2-14**].
