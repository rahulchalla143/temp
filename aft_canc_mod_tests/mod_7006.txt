O/P workup revealed multiple lytic bone lesions and an abnormal monoclonal spike that was c/w IgD lambda.
Her ARF was thought to be secondary to light chain nephropathy and hypercalcemia.

Recommend MRI with gadolinium for further evaluation.
Abd/pelvis CT without contrast: 1.
Very limited study due to lack of oral and IV contrast.
Renal US 1) Complex cyst in the upper pole of the left kidney demonstrating a thickened wall with a 10mm mural nodule.
MRI is recommended for more definititive characterization.
Her initial CT scan was stable and showed no increase in the size of the hemorrhage.
MRI with gado not helpful in further narrowing differential, but did show evidence of posterior leukoencephalopathy which was thought to be due renal failure or hypertension (though she was not hypertensive on admission).
MRV was negative for sinus thrombosis.
She had an LP which showed 2000RBCs, 5WBCs.
She received empiric antibiotic coverage with vanco/ceftriaxone/acyclovir until CSF culture negatives.
She had a repeat LP on [**4-6**] for cytology and oligoclonal bands.
Tap again showed 2000RBCs (not traumatic).
CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells nor was there evidence of paraprotein.
She had a repeat MRI with contrast which showed "surrounding edema which is slightly increased since the previous study.
A repeat MRI will be done in [**5-4**] weeks to assess for underlying mass.
Her last CT scans showed small thyroid nodules and lung nodules as well as multiple renal cysts.
Thyroid US showed evidence of multinodular goiter and renal US showed multiple simple cysts and one complex cyst.
A renal MRI was done to further characterize the complex cyst and showed: "cyst within the upper pole of the left kidney demonstrates a 5 mm enhancing nodule in its anteromedial aspect, which is concerning for an intracystic neoplasm".
A mammogram was also ordered and the patient will be getting it as an outpatient.
Urine cytology was sent and is pending at the time of discharge.
Will continue to monitor BP with goal SBP<140 and increase meds as needed to maintain this pressure.
HEME: -She received 2 Units of PRBCs on [**4-8**] for Hct 25.
Triamcinolone 0.025 % Cream [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) PRN for breast rash.
