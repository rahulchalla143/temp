He had a CT of his abdomen [**6-16**], which showed intra and extrahepatic biliary dilitation, pancreatic duct dilation.
He underwent a MRCP which showed high grade biliary obstruction with a fluid multilobulated lesion in the pancreatic head.
He underwent a repeat ERCP on [**6-22**], with extension of prior sphincterotomy, however, again the biliary duct could not be cannulatedHe was worked up with an ERCP which included a pancreatogram which showed a pancreatic ductal stricture.
Follow-up ERCP showed evidence of huge clot in this diverticulum and at the ampullary region and there was no possible way to perform another interrogation of the bile duct.
An interventional radiology technique took place and was able to embolize the bleeding pancreaticoduodenal arcade vessels.
His bilirubin was in the 20 range.
I performed a number of measures in the days preceding this operation including a CT scan with an angiogram, MRI scan and an endoscopic ultrasound test.
