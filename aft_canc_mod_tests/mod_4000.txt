Received decadron and XRT fpr spine compression at OSH w/o significant improvement.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.
In the week after her surgery, her neuro exam stabilized, and she was able to ambulate w/ some assistance.
She will need daily PT as she has decompensated after a prolonged hospitalization.
Also, thyroid function studies suggested that she has mild hypothyroidism; did not treat at this time as she continued to have tachycardia on small dose BB.
Urine cx negative, and blood cx w/ no growth to date; catheter tip growing coag neg staph which is likely staph epidermidis.
# Tachycardia - Patient with ventricular bigemeny on EKG - has a history of this.
She continued to have HR in 110s w/ low BP.
Did not pursue further work-up at this time as this has been a long-standing issue.
# hypoxia/crackles on exam - this was first noted after the chemoembolization in the PACU.
CXR was only notable for bilateral atelectasis.
In the days prior to her discharge, she was satting 94% on RA and breathing comfortably.
# low platelets/elevated INR - no schistocytes on smear, no renal failure or CNS symptoms or labs to suggest TTP, no DIC.
Transfused platelets to maintain >50 and gave vitamin K prior to spine surgery; platelets bumped up to 154 and then slowly drifted down.
Last plt count was 78 and stable prior to discharge.
- follow CBC .
