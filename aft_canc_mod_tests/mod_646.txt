He was given 3 liters of normal saline with an increase in his blood pressure to 95/48.
He was also given Flagyl and Levaquin for a question of sepsis secondary to a bandemia on his laboratories and was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit because it was discovered that his hematocrit had dropped 10 points in two weeks.
He had a lavage which showed red-colored fluid which cleared with 500 mL of normal saline.
His neck examination revealed he had no jugular venous distention.
On cardiovascular examination he had a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Pulmonary examination was bilaterally clear to auscultation.
Abdominal examination revealed positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, and nondistended.
His extremities showed trace edema in both lower extremities, but no clubbing or cyanosis.
His back showed no midline tenderness.
Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves II through XII were intact.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  His laboratories upon admission revealed he white blood cell count was 11.4, hemoglobin was 10.3, hematocrit was 30.7 (down from 40.9 on [**2188-8-8**]), with a platelet count of 455.
His Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 127, potassium was 7.6 (hemolyzed), chloride was 92, bicarbonate was 23, blood urea nitrogen was 87, creatinine was 2 (up from 1.8), and blood glucose was 223.
The patient had an ALT of 16, AST was 40.
Creatine kinase was 62.
Alkaline phosphatase was 53, albumin was 2.5.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray was read as normal without any infiltrates or free air.
His electrocardiogram showed no changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**2188-8-26**], he had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed a normal esophagus and duodenum.
He was made n.p.o., current intravenous proton pump inhibitor and was recommended, and was recommended for outpatient repeat endoscopy in 7 to 10 days with a biopsies at that time.
His laboratories upon transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the Medicine [**Hospital1 **] on [**2188-8-27**] showed a white blood cell count of 12.1, hemoglobin was 12, hematocrit was 35.6, and platelets were 329.
His electrolytes had been stabilized to a sodium of 142, potassium was 5, chloride was 111, bicarbonate was 16, blood urea nitrogen was 25, creatinine was 1, blood glucose was 105.
Calcium was 8, and magnesium was 2.1.
The patient was transferred to the Medicine Service; and instead of being discharged to home with outpatient followup, it was decided that he would have his esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies done subsequently during his stay as an inpatient.
These biopsies showed pyloric obstruction.
Biopsies were taken which subsequently showed lymphoma, and various consultation services were called to see the patient.
He had a CT scan of the abdomen done for staging which showed small bilateral pleural effusions, thickening circumference of the gastric antrum, large lymph nodes up to 2 cm in the gastrohepatic ligament, and the peripancreatic gastrosplenic para-aortic, and autocoidal areas which were worrisome for metastatic disease.
His CT of the pelvis showed no free air or fluid and no bony lesions.
Given these results, a cortisol level was drawn which was normal, and the patient was scheduled for a gallium scan.
