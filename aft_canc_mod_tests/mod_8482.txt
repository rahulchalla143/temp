Of note, the patient's INR was 3.2 yesterday, according to his wife.
In the emergency room, he was emergently sent to CT scan.
A non-contrast image of the head and neck suggested a "likely subdural spinal hematoma" extending from the cerebellopontine angle "to the C2-C3 level with cord compression and edema."

CT C-Spine ([**11-17**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CTA Head ([**11-17**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of AVM, aneurysm formation, or other vascular abnormality.
MR or catheter angiogram may be helpful for more definitive proof.
CXR ([**11-17**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.

Conventional angiogram can be considered to confirm the source of hemorrhage after discussion with the interventional neuroradiologist, if there is continued cocern.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] ([**11-19**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Continued evolution of the blood products, noted in the CSF space, anterior and to the left side of the medulla and in the upper cervical canal with mild decrease in the anteroposterior extent of the blood products as seen on the sagittal images; improvemed but persistent compression on the upper cervical cord and the left side of the medulla compared to the prior study (but persistent).

CTA head showed no evidence of AVM, aneurysm formation, or other vascular abnormality.
Cerebral angiography showed prominent venous/vascular structures in the region of the proximal V4 segment of the left vertebral artery may represent a developmental venous anomaly/venous angioma, but hypervascular tumor cannot be excluded.
His INR was 3.6 on admission, and he was given Prophylnine 2 vials, Vitamin K 10 mg IV x1, and 2 U FFP.
Neurosurgery was consulted on admission and recommneded reversing INR to 1.3.
He will be sent out with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor for the next 2 weeks, so monitor his QTc and heart rate while starting Amiodarone.
WBC was 14.1 on admission with 88% neutrophils, and peaked at 18.7 Urine Cx ([**11-17**]): <10,000 organisms/ml, ([**11-21**], [**11-25**]): No growth, and ([**11-22**]): ENTEROCOCCUS >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML; STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
Blood Cx ([**11-21**], [**11-22**] x3, [**11-23**] x2, [**11-25**] x2): No growth.
CXR and LFTs were normal, ANCA was negative, and TTE did not show any vegetations.
CT Torso showed no evidence of abscess and no explanation for the patient;s fever.
LENIs showed no DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
Hypertension: His bp was 167/92 on admission.
Papillary renal cell carcinoma: CT Torso showed multiple renal cysts including two hyperattenuating, likely hemorrhagic, cysts in the right kidney.
He had recently had an MRI Abdomen at [**Hospital1 112**] ([**2149-10-1**]) which showed: -Stable in size partially exophytic solid mass in the lower pole of the right kidney, consistent with known papillary renal cell carcinoma, unchanged in size and appearance since comparison study from [**2149-5-23**] -Multiple stable in size bilateral renal cysts.
