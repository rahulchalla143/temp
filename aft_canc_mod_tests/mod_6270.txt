Labs were notable for a WBC count of 21.2 with 89.4 % neutrophils,, hemoglobin of 13.1.
Initial ABG post intubation was 7.31/68.1/293 on 500 x 15, FiO2 100%, PEEP 5.
Prior to transfer his blood pressures were ranging from the 70s to 90s systolic.
His blood pressures were in the 80s systolic on neosynephrine.
The diltiazem drip was discontinued and his heart rates were in the 70s with wandering atrial pacemaker.
He received 3 liters normal saline with improvement in his blood pressures to the 110s systolic.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
CXR [**3-28**]: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as well as there is no change in the right upper lobe mass highly suspicious for neoplasm.
Patient extubated, abx and blood pressure support withdrawn as patient made CMO.
Given bilateral infiltrates and no clear evidence for congestive heart failure meets criteria for ARDS.
CXR today with new LLL infiltrate c/f aspiration PNA.
Heart rate currently in the 70s off diltiazem.
