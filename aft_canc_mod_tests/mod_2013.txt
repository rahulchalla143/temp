GRAM STAIN (Final [**2122-1-31**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2122-2-2**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2122-1-31**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2122-2-2**]):       MODERATE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
Pulmonary vascular markings are normal and the remainder of the lungs is clear.
[**2122-2-5**] VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: Oral and pharyngeal swallowing study was performed today in collaboration with speech and swallow pathology.
Culture swabs were taken of the larnyx and right arytenoid and the patient was started empirically on unasyn and fluconazole.
Cultures eventually grew oropharyngeal flora and Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
PMV was placed on POD#4 and the tracheostomy was changed on POD#5.
#Aspriation pneumonia - As the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable with a normal WBC#, augmentin was continued for coverage of aspiration pneumonia.
#Acute blood loss anemia - The patient had an asymptomatic 10% decline in hematocrit over 1 month and guaiac positive stools on admission.
He received 1 U PRBC on HD#2 for Hct 22.7%.
His Hct remained stable ~24%.
Colonscopy revealed a benign-appearing ascending colonic polyp which was biopsied.
EGD revealed antral gastritis and duodenitis with superficial erosions, but no source of active bleeding.
He will continue on PPI [**Hospital1 **] and will have a repeat Hct soon after discharge.
Video oropharyngeal swallow study on [**2122-2-5**] revealed moderate pharyngeal dysphagia characterized by impaired laryngeal valve closure which resulted in penetration and trace aspiration.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Ten (10) mL PO twice a day.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary 1) Hypoxic respiratory failure 2) Aspiration pneumonia 3) Fungal laryngitis 4) Acute blood loss anemia  Secondary 1) Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma 2) Status post percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement 3) Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable vital signs and respiratory status.
You had another swallowing study which showed muscle weakness and a high risk for aspiration even with ground solids and nectar-thickened liquids.
If you accept these risks and choose to take food by mouth, please eat ground solids and nectar-thickened liquids, keep the head of the bed at 45 degrees and wear the Passy-Muir valve during meals, and perform oral care every 4 hours.
Please have your blood count (hematocrit) and liver function tests checked at this visit.
You had an upper endoscopy on [**2122-2-3**] which showed a small amount of irritation in the stomach and small intestine.
Colonoscopy showed a benign-appearing polyp which was nonetheless biopsied.
Please follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 349**] of [**Hospital1 18**] Gastroenterology on Wednesday, [**2-18**] at 3:30 PM to review the results of your colon biopsy and discuss the role for capsule endoscopy.
Please have your blood count (hematocrit) and liver function tests checked at this visit.
