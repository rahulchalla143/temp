<br> <b>Studies:</b> CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2167-10-26**] 3:28 PM CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Lung bases demonstrate mild atelectasis.
Multiple prominent lymph nodes are seen within the retroperitoneum and in the peripancreatic region which are unchanged and do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Intra- abdominal loops of large and small bowel maintain a normal caliber without evidence of obstruction.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder are within normal limits.
A hemangioma is again identified in the vertebral body of L3.
The previosly described abnormal hypodensity around the plastic biliary stent is no longer apparent as the space is now occupied by a larger metallic stent and thus the findings on the prior exam is most likely attributable to a focally dilated common bile duct.
<br> US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN  [**2167-10-19**] 9:56 AM LIVER AND GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND: Comparison was made with the prior CT study dated [**2167-10-13**].
Liver is heterogeneous in echotexture, likely representing cirrhosis, with atrophic right lobe and pneumobilia as seen on the CT study.
The evaluation of the pancreas is extremely limited, and please refer to the official report of CT scan for the pancreatic finding.
<br> CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2167-10-13**] 2:57 PM CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Again noted is massive ascites throughout the pelvis.
<br> ECG ([**10-11**]): Sinus rhythm.
# Cholangitis Underwent an initial ERCP as above with placement of a plastic stent.
The patient was about to have the repeat procedure when she refused due to discomfort.
Ultimately, with the help of the social workers, the patient agreed to have the repeat procedure.
Cytology from the ampulla was sent and showed an adeoncarcinoma.
The patient's AlkPhos trended down after the procedure.
Initial CT scan raised the suspicion of a pancreatic mass, however this was not seen in repeat CT scan after metal stent was placed.
Viral hepatitis serologies were sent, and were positive for HAV antibody, prior HBV exposure, and HCV indeterminate (per RIBA as above).
Alpha Fetal Protein was negative.
Hepatic U/S showed normal portal flows.
She underwent 3 separate therapeutic paracenteses with studies as above (no evidence of SBP, SAAG of 1.1).
At time she appeared to have some element of confusion and was noted to have asterixis on exam c/w hepatic encephalopathy.
She also had an ammonia of 88.
She was started on Lasix and Aldactone, with the doses titrated up as her blood pressure would allow.
She will need outpatient GI follow up and continued paracenteses.
Cardiac enzymes negative for acute ischemia.
Discharge weight - 119 lbs.
You underwent an ERCP 2 times (the second time a metal stent was placed in your bile ducts).
