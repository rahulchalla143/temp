She was initially diagnosed with melanoma in [**2102**] after the biopsy of a lesion on her abdomen, for which she underwent surgical resection.
Then in [**2120**], she was found to have metastatic melanoma after the biopsy of a shoulder mass prompted further workup and she was found to have brain and lung mets.
CT scan revealed unchanged 3mm midline shift.
- Initially presented with melanoma in-situ in [**2103**] on her abdominal wall which was resected - [**2120**] re-presented with a L axiallary nodule found to be LN with melanoma and multiple other metastatic sites.
- [**12/2122**], she developed severe intermittent headaches and an MRI showed extensive CNS metastases.

MICRO: - Blood Cx [**2127-1-7**]: negative - UA/UCx [**2127-1-7**]: negative - RPR [**2127-1-10**]: negative .
[**2127-1-6**]: CT head w/o contrast FINDINGS: Multiple mixed attenuation lesions are again noted, including lesions in the cerebellar vermis, posterior right temporal lobe, left posterior frontal lobe, the medial parafalcine left frontal and left parietal lobes, and the right frontal lobe.
IMPRESSION: Multiple parenchymal metastases, grossly similar to the [**2127-1-2**] head MRI allowing for differences in modalities, with unchanged 3 mm leftward shift of midline structures.
EEG [**2127-1-7**] This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of right fronto-central rare epileptiform discharges which represent epileptogenic cortex.
TSH and B12 are normal, and RPR is negative.
CT showed stable 3mm midline shift.
She was taking Lamotrigine 150mg [**Hospital1 **] at home (though no blood level was obtained on admission) and she was started on here.
While her level of attention improved during her stay, she still remained confused and had poor recall.
