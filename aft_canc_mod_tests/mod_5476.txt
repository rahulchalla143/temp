On CT at OSH was found with worsening progression and spread of cancer to L hilum with occlusion/stenosis of central branches of L bronchus and occlusion of L lower pulmonary vein and severe L pulmonary AA stenosis.

Periphery of left lower lung and lateral ribs have been excluded from the radiograph, but will be fully evaluated on the patient's separately dictated chest CT from the same date.
On [**2165-12-17**], chest xray was obtained, showing a large infrahilar mass that developed in the left lung along with a large opacity peripherally that could be due to additional mass or area of post-obstructive atelectasis.
Subsequent chest CT was obtained, confirming a left hilar mass invading the left main stem bronchus.
Flexible bronchoscopy revealed a viable stump in the bronchus intermedius with distal left main stem endobronchial lesion causing significant airway compromise (75% occlusion) and tumor infiltration in the left upper lobe.
