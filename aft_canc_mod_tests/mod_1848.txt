Upon arrival there her vitals were as follows: T 97.9, HR 115, BP 112/69, O2 sat 96% on RA.
CT scan was attempted, however, po contrast had not progressed sufficiently for accurate scan.
She then underwent staging laparotomy in [**9-/2113**], and at that time, it appeared that she would be resectable.
On [**2113-10-18**], she underwent a trisegmentectomy with a roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy and cholecystectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She underwent RFA and had a hepatic artery thrombosis which resulted in a long course of chronic hepatic ischemia.
Physical Exam: T 96.4, BP 102/69, P 132, RR 18, 96% RA Gen - Ill-appearing, cachectic, sleepy, breathing comfortably, jaundiced HEENT - MMM, no oral lesions.

CT Scan Abd/Pelvis ([**7-29**]): ABDOMEN FINDNGS:  There is interval development of left basilar airspace opacity which is incompletely imaged.
Lack of intravenous contrast limits the evaluation of solid organs.
Evaluation of bowel loops is significantly limited due to inadequate contrast in the bowel and background mesenteric edema, which has increased compared to prior study.
Significantly limited non-contrast CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates stable post-surgical changes related to prior whipple and right hepatectomy.
Given the limited passage of oral contrast, a delayed scan may be useful to further evaluate though no transition point is seen on this study.
Correlation with dedicated chest CT is recommended.
RUQ ultrasound: FINDINGS:  This is a limited study for the evaluation of intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Limited study of the liver.
UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH  Comparison is made to [**8-2**] and [**8-9**] radiographs.
