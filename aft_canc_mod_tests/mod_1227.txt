Imaging Chest XR ([**2125-6-8**] 3:31 PM) IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities.
Chest XR ([**2125-6-17**] 9:18 PM) IMPRESSION: The tracheostomy tip is relatively at the midline, 3.5 cm above the carina.
No appreciable worsening since the prior study has been demonstrated.
It was felt that her upper airway collapse, secondary to her paraneoplastic syndromes,  was the cause of her respiratory distress.
On discharge, she required less frequent suctioning, her oxygen saturation has remained 99% and above, and was breathing comfortably with the aid of a 35% O2 trach mask.
She will follow up with him for initiation of treatments and to review her CT scan, currently scheduled for [**7-3**] to further investigate a primary lung malignancy.
# Hematocrit drop: Her hematocrit started trending down while in the MICU and she was transfused 1 unit of pRBCs with good response.
While on the general medicine floor, her hematocrit hit a nadir of 18.9, but once again resolved with administration of 2 units of packed RBCs to 28.2.
Iron studies, hemolysis labs, and guaiac testing revealed a likely anemia of chronic disease (high ferritin, low TIBC, normocytic).
B12 was found to be slightly elevated, folate was within normal limits, and a direct Coomb's test was negative.
Though IVIg can be a cause of hemolysis, laboratory testing did not show evidence of any hemolysis.
Upon discharge, her hematocrit was measured at 31.0. .
# Hyponatremia:  Her sodium levels were measured as low as 126, thought to be secondary to her paraneoplastic disorders, described above.
Urine creatinine and electrolytes were consistent with SIADH.
