HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56 year old former anesthesiologist, who has a history of anaplastic oligodendroglioma which was picked up in [**2166-3-24**] by screening MRI of the head for an infertility workup.
The initial abnormalities were in the right temporal and right insular cortices with later involvement of the corpus callosum.
He was treated initially with Antineoplaston in [**Country 149**] and finally had stereotactic brain biopsy in [**2167-8-24**].
Because of lack of response to this, whole brain radiation was begun in [**2168-1-24**] and ended on [**2168-2-29**].
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2168-3-13**] for an intracranial hemorrhage seen on radioimaging that was probably radiation changes ultimately.
He was seen on [**2168-4-1**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in neuro-oncology and his cell counts were low.
A head CT showed no new changes and a chest x-ray showed a persistent right middle and right lower lobe infiltrate, thought to be due to aspiration pneumonia.
A valproic acid level was low upon admission and it appears that it has not been therapeutic for a couple of months.
History of a line infection, sepsis, in [**2166**], related to    chemotherapy.
His temperature was 99.4, blood pressure was 120/74, heart rate 92, O2 sat 95 percent on room air.
Reflexes were trace throughout and difficult to elicit.
The plantar reflexes were flexor bilaterally.
He was monitored with extended EEGs throughout this course and again showed the same persistent pattern of epileptiform activity at about 1 Hz of spike and slow wave, which did not change whenever the patient had a clinical event that was thought to be a partial seizure, for example facial twitching on one-half of the face, usually the right side.
He would look towards his left after an extended delay, which we interpreted as abulia, in addition to a general slowing in terms of answering questions, which eventually were correct and showed clearly that he comprehended the questions.
On exam currently, he is able to answer appropriately questions regarding orientation.
ANEMIA:  The patient had a baseline anemia with a    hematocrit hovering in the 29 to 31 range.
Iron studies    were checked and this was consistit with an anemia of    chronic disease.
With regard    to neuro-imaging and the status of the oligodendroglioma,    the most recent MRI of [**2168-3-14**] compared with an MRI in    [**2167-12-24**] showed some considerable reduction in the    diffuse flare hyperintensities present throughout the    right temporal, frontal and occipital lobes.
Of note, an MR spectroscopy was done in    [**2167-10-24**], which showed progressive infiltrative    tumors centered in the right temporal lobe, but also    involving the right frontal and parietal lobes.
As    mentioned a CAT scan was done initially on admission at    [**Hospital1 **] - [**Location (un) 620**], and this showed no    changes consistent with hemorrhage.
