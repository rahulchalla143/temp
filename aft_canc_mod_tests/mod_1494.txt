On cranial nerve examination, pupils are equal and reactive, EOMI.
Extra-axial, dural-based mass lesion measuring 15 (CC) x 25 (transverse) x 31 (AP) dimensions within the right parietal region of the vertex with homogenous enhancement shows no significant change from the prior examination allowing for positioning and technique.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2169-6-1**] 1.
Moderate amount of pneumocephalus and expected post-surgical changes  [**6-1**] CT head - 1.
The event at 7:30 on the morning of [**5-31**] showed video and EEG  evidence of a seizure.
The focus was not completely clear by EEG as there was irregular slowing in the right central region and also left temporal area, both with sharp and spike features.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there is improvement as faster background rhythms are present in this recording.
[**6-6**]: pendinf [**6-7**]: pending  [**6-2**] CT head - 1.
No significant change in the appearance of the post-surgical resection bed in comparison to exam obtained 15 hours prior.
[**6-4**] Ct Head -  With the exception of the resolution of the minimal pneumocephalus previously seen, there has been no significant change in the appearance of the right [**Last Name (un) 24096**]-frontal post-surgical resection bed, including trace residual blood products and [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter hypodensities, most consistent with edema.
On post operative exam it was noted that she was not moving her left leg as well.
Post op Head CT revealed no hemorrhage, + pneumocephalus therefore she was placed on a non-rebreather.
Post operative MRI was performed which revealed new convex epidural fluid collection with contrast extravasation.
Head CT was obtained which showed acute hemorrhage in the R frontoparietal region.
Post op head CT showed good resection of clot with no acute hemorrhage.
Overnight, she was seen to have twitching of her LUE which was continuous.
EEG leads were placed and keppra was increased to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].
EEG showed seizure activity in the R central region and her keppra was increased to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] and dilatin was added.
A repeat head CT was done which was stable.
She was given 1 unit of PRBC for Hct 23.9 in setting on low UOP.
Post hematocrit [**Last Name (un) 24097**] 29.2%.
[**6-5**] Speech and swallow eval and he was deemed an aspiration risk.
The EEG leads were DC'ed on [**6-7**].
Information was obtained from webOMR.
