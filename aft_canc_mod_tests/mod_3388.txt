The patient's respiratory distress did not resolve and after obtaining an ABG of 7.17/74/226, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient's mental status declined and his hypercarbia worsened considerably with an ABG 7.09/121/140 on BIPAP.
Shortly after the results of this blood gas were obtained the patient was intubated.
His BP subsequently improved to MAP>60.

VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.
Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status was complicated by a number of factors including his underlying COPD, diastolic heart failure, lung Ca, and suspected infection.
On [**11-8**] he underwent flexible bronchoscopy with BAL at the bedside which demonstrated significant airway edema, thick white secretions but no obstruction.
The Gram stain, fungal, AFB, and Legionella cultures were all negative.
Due to the patient's poor airway compliance, significant bronchospasm, and anxiety, he developed autopeep on the ventilator calculated to be ~15.
Therefore, the patient's sedation was increased using both fentanyl and propofol in order to decrease the respiratory rate while still on AC and decrease his autopeep.
Blood cx drawn on admission and on follow up were negative.
Pt continued to improve and follow up chest X ray showed on [**2128-11-20**] showed no new lung lesions.
An ECHO was performed which showed no evidence of pericardial effusion, a normal LA, and an EF of 50-55%.
He was started on diltiazem which was quickly titrated to 120mg qid for heart rate control.
As he improved clinically, the diltiazem was decreased and pt was sent home on 60mg po qid.
An HIT antibody was sent which was negative.
During the hospitalization, and likely due to poor po intake, pt was dehydrated, with hypernatremia, relative hypotension to SBP 90s, tachycardia to 110s, and a contraction alkalosis.
A depression screen revealed no evidence of depression, and pt was back to his baseline per family members.
