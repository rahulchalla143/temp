17 x 14 mm cystic structure abutting pancreatic tail is consistent with a pseudocyst, but MRCP may be obtained for further evaluation when clinically appropriate.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization:  73 yo F w/ CKD stage IV, HTN, anemia who presents with atypical abdominal pain and metabolic acidosis found to have radiologic findings suggestive of acute on chronic pancreatitis and admitted to MICU for monitoring, then transferred to the floor for further evaluation and management of her abdominal symptoms.
Although unlikely infectious cause, work-up was started, urine cx & blood cx still pending.
Her phosphate binders were restarted and she resumed a renal diet.
Less likely PE or PNA as she is not tachycardic or without chest pain and CXR was negative.
She was weaned off of O2 while on the floor and was satting > 95%.
Creatinine trended downwards from 3.7 on admission, not yet back to baseline of 2.8 (on discharge was 3.3).
