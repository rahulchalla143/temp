History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 84873**] is 63 yo female with a history of metastatic breat CA on chemotherapy (Fulvestrant 500mg IM and a study drug).
EKG showed SR HR 100.
Cardiology was consulted for evaluation of CHF.
A bedside cardiac ultrasound was performed with limited images that did not show any obvious effusion or RV dysfunction.
CXR showed nodular opacity in right lung field.
CTA chest was performed but no prelim results on arrival to floor.
1st set of enzymes negative.
Patient admitted to floor for further workup of new onset volume overload.
Family History: Breast Cancer: Mother [**Name (NI) 3495**] Disease/MVP: Mother   Physical Exam: VITALS: 98.9, 84-99/53-57, 104-114, 20, 97% RA weight 60.6 kg GENERAL: NAD, comfortable while lying on bed HEENT: MMM, EOMI NECK: JVP at 12 cm LUNGS: CTABL, no crackles HEART: [**4-10**] holosystolic murmur heard best at apex with radiation across the precordium, RRR ABDOMEN: Soft, NT, NABS, no organomegaly EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e NEUROLOGIC: A+OX3  Pertinent Results: TTE [**2196-7-5**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-5-26**], the posterior mitral leaflet is now flail, and the mitral regurgitation is markedly increased (at least moderate-to-severe, and likely frankly severe).
CTA [**7-4**]: 1.
Cardiac cath [**7-6**]: 1.
PFTs [**7-6**]: no pulmonary function abnormalities  Intra-op TEE [**2196-7-8**] Conclusions Prebypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] distance is 2.9cm and the A:P ratio is 1.03 as predictors for systolic anterior motion.

# SOB: Echo shows new mitral leaflet flail, with markedly increased mitral regurg.
The etiology of her SOB was [**1-7**] worsening mitral regurg with resultant volume overload/heart failure.
Cardiac cath was preformed before surgery and showed clean coronary arteries.
# Breast Ca: CTA showed increasing size of metastasis in the liver.
The patient's study drug was held during hospitalization, but she did recieve Fulvestrant during admission.
At the time of discharge, mitral valve and thymic fat pad biopsy were pending - these results need to be followed up.
Information was obtained from PatientwebOMR.
