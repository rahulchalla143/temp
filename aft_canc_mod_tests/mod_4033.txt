An MR is recommended for better evaluation of this lesion.
CT TORSO [**1-30**]: IMPRESSION: 1) A 3-4 mm vague nodule in the right upper lobe, new since the previous exam.
[**2130-2-13**] CT abdomen/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Multiple hypoenhancing lesions throughout both kidneys, consistent with lymphoma, and unchanged compared to CT [**2-13**], [**2130**].
[**2-17**] MR head: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the brain, compared to the previous MRI of [**2129-12-17**].
[**2-18**] CT torso: IMPRESSION: 1) Diffuse bilateral increased thickness of the pulmonary interlobular septa, new compared to the prior study of [**2130-2-13**].
If clinically indicated, correlation with ultrasound examination may be performed.
[**3-5**] CT chest: IMPRESSION: 1) Interval formation of bilateral dependent areas of consolidation in the lower lobes suggestive of aspiration with or without overlying pnuemonia.
3) New and worsened SUV avidity involving a right spinal accessory lymph node, the pre-carinal lymph node, and two tiny para-vascular lymph nodes.
Stool studies, including C. Diff were sent which were negative.
On HD 2, the patient had a CT of the abdomen done which did not elucidate the cause of his abdominal pain.
Blood and urine cultures were sent and were negative.
On HD 2, a CT torso was done which was notable for a vague nodule in RUL but no other source of fevers.
He had a number of blood cultures drawn which and never grew any organisms.
He was re-imaged, including CT scans of the sinuses and torso, and no source of infection was identified.
A culture of nasal secretions was sent and grew out aspergillus [**Country 11730**].
He continued to have low-grade temps, with spikes daily, and repeat cultures did not grow any microorganisms.
In particular, repeat nasal secretion culture showed only yeast, and no longer any Aspergillus.
3. nasal T-cell/NK cell lymphoma - The patient continued to receive his daily radiation treatments while an inpatient.
A PET scan on HD 2 was concerning for a right cervical lymph node foci and 3 liver foci.
The cisplatinum was discontinued after 2 days of treatment as the pt developed acute renal failure with a creatinine of 1.6 (FE Na 5.5%, suggesting acute tubular necrosis).
A repeat PET scan was performed and did not show any evidence of dissemination.
He then developed SOB and tachypnea that required transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring, and CT showed a diffuse process that was unclear but felt most likely to be capillary leak syndrome.
He was also felt to have significant consolidation in the bases, though bronchoscopy and induced sputum samples did not grow any organisms.
Repeat chest CTs showed interval increases in infiltrates and consolidation, but it was unclear whether this was due to fluid overload or to infection.
A renal ultrasound showed no evidence of hydronephrosis, stone, or mass.
He then worsened acutely about 2 days after a dye load for a CT angio was given.
However, his kidney function did not recover spontaneously as expected, and ultimately, due to fluid overload and massive anasarca, ultrafiltration was begun.
6.  elevated pancreatic enzymes - pt's lipase was intermittently elevated, at one point at 3600 (on [**3-11**]).
GI was consulted, and it was felt that he needed an MRCP of the abdomen to see if there was significant biliary obstruction, with the thought that he may need an ERCP.
A RUQ ultrasound previously showed only sludge in the gallbladder.
The MRCP was done, which showed no evidence of biliary ductal dilatation, nor radiographic evidence of pancreatitis.
His lasix drip was discontinued at this point, as this has been shown to induce pancreatitis, and his TPN was stopped, as well.
Echocardiograms on [**2-28**] and [**3-6**] showed mildly depressed LVEF and global hypokinesis, which was thought to be secondary to cardiomyopathy due to critical illness.
Pt's cardiac enzymes remained flat though mildly elevated, consistent with a demand ischemia in this setting.
Repeated RUQ ultrasounds, and eventually an MRCP, excluded biliary dilatation.
It began to spontaneously drain serosanguinous fluid, which was sent for culture and grew out VRE.
His INR was up to 1.7, and his DIC and hemolysis panels were positive, though not floridly so.
He was transfused with multiple units of FFP to try to lower his PTT, which was >150 at one point; he was given units of cryo to keep his fibrinogen > 150, and he was transfused with multiple units of platelets, given his thrombocytopenia and active oozing from sites as well as guaiac positive stool and NG aspirate.
11.  encephalopathy - pt began to be more encephalopathic in the last few days of his life.
12.  hypotension/sepsis - Pt became more hypotensive toward the end of his hospitalization.
Although he had significant anasarca by this time, his CVP and decreasing urine output pointed to intravascular volume depletion.
His urine output dropped off, he was becoming more and more encephalopathic, and his blood pressure was difficult to maintain.
Post-mortem examination was declined.
