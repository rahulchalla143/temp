He was taken to a local hospital in [**Location (un) 27138**] where labs were reportedly normal, with KUB and head CT reportedly negative.
On arrival in our ED, his vitals were T 96.2, HR 70, BP 134/81, RR 16, 99% O2.
Head CT revealed L parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended phenytoin and labetolol to keep SBP 110 to 140.
His abd CT revealed no obstruction, no evidence of metastatic disease.
CXR was unremarkable.
Past Medical History: Oncologic history: * Metastatic melanoma: - excisional biopsy of a nasal lesion in [**7-/2120**] with pathology revealing a lentigo maligna melanoma.
- Reexcision pathology revealed a lentigo maligna melanoma, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level IV, 1.75 mm thick, nonulcerated without perineural invasion.
One sentinel lymph node was negative for metastases.
Non-oncologic history: HTN CKD vitiligo h/o colonic polyps   Social History: No smoking, no drinking  Family History: Non contributory  Physical Exam: VS: T 97.6, BP 140/84, HR 76, RR 12, 96% RA GEN: Elderly man, unable to lie still in bed, frequently attempting to get out of bed, soft restraints on wrists, unable to cooperate with exam or history NEURO: Awake, not oriented to name, person, or date.
Pertinent Results: * Head CT [**9-25**]: Left parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage with potential small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontal and temporal distribution.
No definite mass lesion identified; however, evaluation is limited without contrast.
* CXR [**9-25**]: no acute cardiopulmonary process * Abd CT [**9-25**]:  No evidence of obstruction.
* CXR [**10-5**]: LLL opacity (my read), improving from [**9-29**] * Head CT [**10-3**]: unchanged SAH * Chest CT [**9-29**]: LLL aspiration pna, 1.2cm RUL nodule * CXR [**9-29**]: LLL atelectasis vs. aspiration * Head MRI [**9-27**]: no leptomeningeal metastasis, chronic microinfarctions * Head CT [**9-25**]: Left parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage with potential small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontal and temporal distribution.
No definite mass lesion identified; however, evaluation is limited without contrast.
* CXR [**9-25**]: no acute cardiopulmonary process * Abd CT [**9-25**]:  No evidence of obstruction.
He was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage on chest CT on admission.
Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended medical therapy with blood pressure control, for SBP goal of 110 to 140, and anti-seizure prophylaxis with phenytoin, which was later switched to levetiracetam due to administration via a PICC line.
A head MRI showed no leptominingeal enhancement and, except for the known SAH, no other acute process.
A bedside EEG was negative.
Metabolic work-up did not reveal any abnormality.
Due to his inability to take PO medications, clonidine 0.1 mg patch was started to achieve goal SBP of 110-140.
A repeat head CT showed extensive new bleed.
CXR and chest CT later revealed likely aspiration pneumonia.
An initial EEG was negative, and a repeat EEG was inconclusive.
