Of note, she was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 45401**] with new onset BLE weakness and urinary retention, and T11-L2 and conus mets on MRI at OSH.
She denies fevers/chills, SOB, chest pain, abdominal pain, no change in mental status.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.8 HR 88 BP 139/87 RR 16 O2 100%  Patient was given morphine for pain and zofran for nausea, which were effective.
CT Head showed hemorrhagic transformation of known brain metastases with no midline shift or hydrocephalus.
Rad/onc fellow was called who said that no further imaging is needed urgently and that she will be seen tomorrow morning for probable whole brain radiation.
Past Medical History: Melanoma stage IV -[**1-7**] Excisional biopsy revealed a 3.75 mm thick, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level IV melanoma on her lower back.
Restaging PET scan showed retroperitoneal disease which was biopsied on [**2134-2-18**] and proven to be melanoma.
-[**3-10**] HD IL-2 with 13/14 doses week 1 and [**11-14**] doses week 2 with disease progression noted [**9-9**].
She underwent pre treatment biopsy on [**2134-10-6**] on the left breast taillesion.
-On [**2136-6-2**], she had restaging Ct of head for routine follow up as well as torso CT.
Her torso CT revealed to be stable with further reduction of her disease however, on head CT two suspicious lesion 1.0 cm in L frontal lobe and in the periventricular white matter on the left note is made of a small hyperdense focus which also enhances on post-contrast imaging, measuring in total 4 x 3 mm.
She underwent head MRI for confirmation  and was found to have at least [**6-8**] small lesions and well as the L frontal lesion.

Microbiology: Urine culture ([**7-15**]): Negative .
Imaging: CT head without contrast ([**7-15**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
If there is clinical concern for new metastasis, MRI of the brain is recommended.
CT torso with contrast ([**7-16**]): IMPRESSION: Hypodensity/melanoma lesion in the caudate lobe appears slightly increased in size on the current study compared to the prior examination.
MR head with contrast ([**7-17**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 33F with metastatic melanoma with leptomeningeal disease, BLE weakness and loss of sensation now presents with frontal headache, nausea, and vomiting, found to have  likely hemorrhagic transformation of 2 known brain metastases on CT head.
#Hemorrhagic Transformatin of known brain mets: Pt presented with severe headaches, nausea, and vomiting with findings on CT demonstrating hemmorrhagic conversion confirmed on MRI brain.
CT Chest/Abd was performed for staging and showed no new mets.
The patient refused WBR in favor of other therapeutic options.
She tolerated the study medication well and required only occasional PRN doses of morphine for headaches and ativan for steroid-induced anxiety and muscle tension.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of severe headaches and found to have hemorrhagic conversion of known tumor metastasis in your brain.
