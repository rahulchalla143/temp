CT head [**7-8**] Right parietal parenchymal lesion abutting the lateral ventricle, with probable surrounding edema (versus cystic components).
CT head post op [**7-8**] 1.
CT head post epidural evacuation 1.
Hypodense areas in the right frontal and parietal lobes are more conspicuous than on prior study and more extensive in location than the prior mass.
Recommend MRI and follwo up(if not contra-indicated) for better assessment of these hypodense areas.
Stable leftward shift from normally midline structures  [**7-13**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Since the previous CT of [**2125-3-1**] both the intracranial pressure monitoring device has been removed.
There is craniectomy with multiple hypodensities in the right cerebral hemisphere unchanged from previous study with foci of hemorrhage and pneumocephalus.
Chest XR [**7-24**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the PICC line lies in the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.
Head CT [**7-26**]: 8mm increase in extra-axial fluid collection.
CT of the head upon admission showed a right parietal mass with surronding vasogenic edema.
MRI +/- contrast showed an enhancing mass within the right parietal lobe and the plan was for open biopsy on Monday [**7-9**].
The patient was immediately taken for CT of the head.
Head CT showed large right sided epidural hematoma anterior to the resection cavity with 1.7cm of midline shift.
Pt was taken back to the operating room from CT scan and underwent emergent evacuation of epidural hematoma and R hemicraniectomy.
An ICP monitor was placed at the time of surgery to further monitor intracranial pressures.
A head ct obtained showed good evacuation of hematoma, resolution of midline shift and no hyrdocephalus.
[**7-10**] Head ct was stable with no new hemorrhage.
His baseline exam on this day showed no eye opening, PERRLA, withdraw BLE R>L, flexion RUE, extensor posturing LUE, no eye opening.
Stat head ct showed no change when compared to previous exam.
His ICP did decrease to a range of 20-21.
His exam on this day remained unchanged as did his ct head.
[**7-12**] Pt cont on mannitol and decadron, neurological exam & ICP's remained stable.
tumor markers were sent by the oncology team.
Family decided to proceed with Trach/Peg/IVC Filter [**Date range (1) 57944**]: neurological exam slightly improved.
[**7-19**] CT head obtained for routine evaluation.
[**7-20**] Pt noted to be febrile on this day with an increasing WBC count and increased amounts thick secretions requiring deep suction.
Sputum cultures sent and positive for H. Flu.
His WBC count continued to trend down from 17.3 to 10.5 and he remained afebrile.
A trough level on [**7-24**] was 14.3.
On [**7-25**] it was noted that his LFTs were slightly elevated on the date that Ceftaz was initiated.
A subsequent RUE UE revealed a superficial clot.
His final labs were unremarkable, and his head CT was grossly unchanged.
