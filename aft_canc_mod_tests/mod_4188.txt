He was noted to have blood draining from his left ear.
CT scans were performed that showed left depressed skull fracture with associated SDH, left temporal bone fracture, ?

Further evaluation with CTA is recommended to exclude vascular injury.
[**2169-7-10**] CT Torso : 1.
No Foley catheter in place for CT cystogram currently.
Extensive hematoma involving the perineum and base of the urethra as well as a foci of pelvic hyperdensity, raising concern for vascular injury.
[**2169-7-10**] Left elbow : Note is made of fragmentation at the olecranon process, which may be chronic or alternatively reflect acute injury.
[**2169-7-10**] CTA Neck : 1.
Further evaluation with head and neck MR, with axial fat sat sequences to exclude intramural hematoma/dissection can be considered for better assessment.
However, evaluation at the level of C2 and C3 is limited due to prominent adjacent venous plexus.
[**2169-7-10**] CT Pelvis : 1.
Increased dense material in the right medial thigh as well as anterior subcutaneous tissues and rectus abdominal musculature, new from the previous study and reflecting interval bleeding since the preceding scan.

Evaluation at the level of the lower L5 and the sacrum is limited due to artifacts, from the hardware  [**2169-7-22**] Liver US : 1.
[**2169-7-31**] CT Cystogram : 1.
His hematocrit was monitored serially and was noted to dip from 35-28.5.
His ETT was up sized from a 6.5 to an 8.
On POD [**3-16**] a repeat CTH was performed demonstrating a stable SDH but a new small L temporal lobe hematoma adjacent to evolving contusion.
On POD [**4-16**] his chest xray showed worsening infiltrates so a bronch was done showing LUL & LLL mucus plugging and purulent fluid.
On [**7-17**] his urine output decreased so a renal ultrasound was performed and negative for hydronephrosis.
On [**7-19**] the patients oxygen saturations dropped with a chest xray showing fluid overload so he was diuresed with lasix.
Following gentle diuresis his oxygen saturations improved and he was breathing comfortably.
Neuro: He was followed by Neursosurgery for his left parieto-occipitial skull fracture with small subjacent SDH which was manged nonoperatively, Serial head CT scans and his exam were followed closely.
An EEG was also done to assess for seizure activity, no epileptiform activity was seen.
Cardiac: His blood pressure is 110/70 & HR 84 on Lopressor 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Resp:  His pseudomonas pneumonia resolved with double coverage with Tobra and Zosyn and he is currently off oxygen with RA saturations of 97%.
GU : He underwent serial CT cystograms to assess the healing of his bladder rupture, his foley remmained in place.
A repeat scan was done which showed improvment in the bladder leak, his foley was removed and he is voiding spontaneously.
Several alternative options were explored and it was eventually decided with patient approval, that he go to an apartment in [**Hospital3 **] area with family support.

Followup Instructions: Please call/or have the patient call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 88**] to schedule a follow- up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**], Neurosurgery in 4 weeks, with a Non-contrast CT scan of the head.
