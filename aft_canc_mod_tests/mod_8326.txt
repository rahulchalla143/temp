Catheterization of the celiac trunk [**2127-1-24**]   History of Present Illness: 71 year old female with arthritis, osteoporosis, history of duodenal ulcer and recently diagnosed gastric cancer initially treated with chemotherapy c/b nausea/vomiting/lower GI bleed, now presenting with melanotic stool and ten point hematocrit drop.
She sought medical care and her PCP obtained labs, which were notable for Hgb/Hct 6.7/20.0, down from 11.3/32.3 when checked in [**Month (only) 359**].
She may have felt some dizziness with ambulation for the last couple of days, but denied falls, lightheadedness, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, or hematuria.
Exam was notable for pale sclera and skin, and black stool on rectal exam.
ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm at 88 bpm, and no ischemic changes.
A pantoprazole bolus of 80 mg, then 8 mg/hr gtt was started.
RBC transfusion was started at [**2031**].
GI was consulted, and recommended keeping patient NPO for EGD in AM, and transfusing RBCs for goal Hct > 25. .
The decision was made to defer raditation treatment or further chemo, since the patient was feeling generally well and her PET scan showed general decrease in size of tumor burden.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Carcinoma of GE junction, likely gastric   - Presented in [**6-10**] with dysphagia, initial EGD showed ulcer in cardia and gastritis but no mass and biopsies then negative for malignancy.
CT showed showed 5 mm RLL nodule and ulcerated gastric mass at GE junction.
A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed on [**2126-9-13**], at [**Location (un) 2274**].
A repeat PET scan was performed, which revealed decreased bilateral hilar and precarinal lymph node FDG uptake.
Lung nodule was unchanged, decrease in the size and uptake of the gastroesophageal mass.
No sensory deficits to light touch appreciated RECTAL:  Deferred .

Studies: Imaging: CXR [**2127-1-23**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
Mesenteric study [**2127-1-24**]: read pending .
EGD [**2127-1-24**]: A large ulcerated friable mass of malignant appearance was found at the gastroesophageal junction.
Patient was started on IV Pantoprazole gtt and transfused PRBC X 1 unit in the ED, another 2 PRBC units were transfused in the ICU with appropriate Hct rise from 18.5 on admission to 26 post transfusion.
As patient's hematocrit remained stable Heparin were started for DVT prophylaxis.
She was discharged with instructions and lab slip to repeat a Hct within 7 days of discharge.
She had a PET scan to assess size of gastroesphogeal mass and whether there were metatastases to determine further treatment - palliative radiation in setting of gastric mass bleeding vs. surgery or other treatment.
