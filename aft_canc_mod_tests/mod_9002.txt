She also had an LP positive for malignant cells, and received intrathecal cytarabine, complicated by chemical meningitis with mental status changes.

EEG: [**10-2**] EEG - IMPRESSION: This EEG is severely abnormal and gives evidence for bilaterally independent-appearing paroxysmal epileptiform transients.
[**2187-10-3**] EEG IMPRESSION: This EEG shows a diffuse and moderately to moderately severe encephalopathy with background slowing, loss of any normal frequencies, but predominance over the posterior head regions and greater slowing in the right hemisphere suggestive of structural  pathology bilaterally and more posteriorly in location.
A periodicity is reminiscent of periodic lateralized discharges, and these sometimes occur at the end of a clinical or electrographic seizure or even status epilepticus.
[**10-2**] CXR - FINDINGS: Single portable frontal view of the chest was performed.
[**10-2**] MRI Head c/s gadolinium FINDINGS: Discrete interval progression of supra- and infratentorial metastatic disease with increase in size and perifocal edema of the lesions.
[**2187-10-15**] portable chest x-ray: Compared to the prior study there has been a dramatic increase in a large left pleural effusion with only a small amount of residual aerated lung on the left.
[**2187-10-15**] portable chest x-ray (post-thoracocentesis): FINDINGS: There has been interval decrease in the left-sided effusion.
[**2187-10-19**] chest X ray: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-15**], there is substantial increased haziness of the hemithoraces bilaterally, consistent with recurrent effusions, substantially worse on the right.
Given the extensive changes, an MRI is suggested for better evaluation of the underlying pathology.

Pt was noted to be tachypneic on the morning of [**10-15**] and stat CXR showed large pleural effusion with lung collapse.
Pleural fluid studies were consistent with exudative effusion, and cytology showed malignant cells.
On [**2187-10-19**] she triggered with SBP 170s, and repeat CXR showed interval increase in pleural effusions, with evidence of volume overload.
Her LTM EEG showed severe diffuse encephalopathy with bilateral paroxysmal epileptiform transients with subsequent suppression of her epileptiform discharges overnight on [**10-3**].
Imaging showed interval progression of brain metastases, the likely cause of her seizures.
LTM EEG was again performed, and no seizures were noted.
A repeat head CT showed further interval progression of brain edema and midline shift.
Her glucose levels were also followed and she was placed on insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia due to corticosteroid use.
#) Low urine output: On [**2187-10-19**] pt was noted to have low urine output of <30 cc/hr.
Creatinine was stably low at 0.2-0.5, possibly because of decreased muscle mass from low nutrition.
She received periodic one-time doses of IV lasix, which would temporarily improve her urine output.
The overall trend, however, was that her urine output continued to decline.
#) Pain control: pt was on oral oxycodone prn, which was converted to sublingual oxycodone prn, per palliative care recommendations, when her PO intake dropped.
#) Hypertension: Pt's SBPs were persistenly in 140s-160s, with pulse in 80s-100s.
Neurology service thought this could have been due to heparin prophylaxis, but HIT antibody panel was negative.
We consulted dermatology, who performed tissue biopsies and Gram stains, showing poorly differentiated carcinoma and no evidence of infection.
