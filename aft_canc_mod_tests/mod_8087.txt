[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube was placed and subsequently removed once patient stabilized.
Repeat EGD showed 5 cords of grade III varices in the lower third of the esophagus and 4 bands were successfully placed.
Patient was transfused a total of 2 units of PRBCs and since then blood counts remained stable and he has had no further melena.
A CT abdomen and pelvis showed a portal vein thrombus, and therefore was determined not to be a TIPS candidate.
Nadolol, oral proton-pump inhibitor, and sucralafate were started for prophylaxis and treatment of his recent bleed.
He was insufflated with quite a bit of air during his endoscopy with rising bladder pressures, relieved by placement of rectal tube and decompression of abdominal gas.
Bladder pressures trended down, urine output improved, and abdominal exam clinically improved.
Patient spiked a fever during his stay and diagnostic paracentesis initially grew coag-negative staph and [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
Repeat CT was performed which showed no signs of perforation so patient was empirically started on fluconazole for a total of seven days and zosyn for 48 hours.
Therapeutic paracentesis the following day revealed only small pockets of fluid.
Hep C viral load was 1.6 million and Hepatitis B serologies were negative.
# Possible hepatocellular carcinoma - Patient had CT scan which revealed multiple irregular hepatic hypodensities and portal vein thrombosis, likely from associated tumor.
Patient will require further imaging with MRI/MRCP and discussion of possible treatment of his likely hepatocellular carcinoma  # s/p intubation: Patient intubated at outside hospital for airway protection in the setting of GI bleed.
# Hypertension: He was transitioned to nadolol and his blood pressures remained well-controlled.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Further workup and management of his hepatocellular carcinoma will need to occur in [**Location (un) **] - Consider initiating diuretics if required for volume overload/blood pressure control - Fluconazole course will end on [**6-20**] and sucralafate will end on [**6-25**] - The hepatology attending on service was [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD whose telephone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 111934**] and address is [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 86**], [**Numeric Identifier 718**]  Medications on Admission: - amlodipine 10mg daily - atenolol 100mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1.
We also performed a CT scan that showed some fluid in your abdomen and areas of the liver concerning for liver cancer.
Once you are home, you will need a repeat endoscopy in three weeks to make sure the bleed is healing and an MRI of the liver to rule out cancer.
You will need to discuss further treatment for your possible liver cancer as well as repeat endoscopy to evaluate the the blood vessels in your GI tract.
