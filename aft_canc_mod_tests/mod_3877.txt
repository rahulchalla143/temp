COMPARISON: Noncontrast head CT dated [**2178-11-20**] and the MRI of [**11-13**].
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6744**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Neurooncology was phoned with a change in the report at 9:37am on [**2178-12-16**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
COMPARISON: CT angiogram [**2178-11-20**].
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images were obtained from the lung apices to the mid abdomen first without contrast with a low-dose technique, followed by CT angiogram of the chest.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There has been interval resolution of the filling defects within the pulmonary artery supplying the left lower, right upper, right middle, and right lower lobes.
CT REFORMATS: Coronal, sagittal, and oblique sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial findings.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
ABNORMALITY #2: The background rhythm was slow also on the left side, typically reaching a [**7-14**] Hz maximum in most areas.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with very frequent PVCs.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 axial, sagittal and coronal images of the brain were obtained following the administration of gadolinium.
Comparison was made with the previous MRI examination of [**2178-11-13**] and correlation was made with the head CT of [**2178-11-14**].
There is a small area of acute/subacute hemorrhage seen in the right periatrial region as seen on the CT of [**2178-11-14**].
A small new area of hemorrhage and new surrounding enhancement in the right periatrial region since the MRI of [**2178-11-13**].
Small head bleed seen on initial CT scan.
Repeat imaging did not show interval chnage in bleed.
EEG negative for ongoing seizure activity.
2)PE - Resolved by CT [**2178-12-16**].
MRI did not show significant interval change in disease.
