RADIOLOGY: -[**5-5**] TTE from [**Last Name (un) 4199**]: Summary: LV size and wall thicknesses are nl; LVEF is ~75%.
-[**5-10**] CT abd/pelvis from [**Last Name (un) 4199**]: Two gallbladder-to-distal small bowel fistulas with associated severe gallbladder wall thickening.
-[**5-13**] Abdominal MRI 1.
Small bilateral pleural effusions - [**5-14**] CXR AP chest compared to [**5-10**] through 18: There are now more discrete areas of consolidation in the right mid and lower lung zones, which could be due to pneumonia.
- [**5-18**] echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiogram may better assess for valvular vegetations.
- [**2174-5-20**] IR 1.
The patient can be brought in a few days for repeat cholangiogram and removal of the catheter, if there is no evidence of cholestasis or cholangitis.
Given the scant material, additional evaluation should be considered if clinically appropriate.
[**2174-5-20**] Gallbladder Cytology pending  - [**2174-5-25**] CT HEAD No acute intracranial process.
- EEG [**2174-5-25**] (24 hour): This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of mild diffuse background slowing indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction with non-specific etiology.
- [**2174-5-27**] CXR Lung opacities likely due to multifocal pneumonia.

She was noted to have rising liver enzymes and a CT scan that showed an abnormal gallbladder with markedly thickened gallbladder wall and dilated common bile duct and possible gallbladder carcinoma.
Pt was transitioned to CMO/hospice on [**2174-5-27**], with plan to discontinue vital signs and IV fluids.
She was found to have increased Tbili to 4, and CT scan showing abnormal gallbladder with markedly thickened gallbladder wall and dilated common bile duct, suggesting biliary tract was likely source.
She was weaned off pressors, and her white count improved.
# Fungemia: [**12-29**] blood cultures positive for yeast from [**5-13**], though subsequent surveillance culture were negative.
ECHO evaluation for endocarditis and ophthalmology evaluation for endopthalmitis were negative.
Final pathology from brushings/biopsy revealed glandular atypia but no definitive carcinoma.
Was going to undergo evaluation with colonoscopy and EGD at OSH, but this could not be completed due to patient instability.
Iron studies revealed anemia of chronic inflammation and some hypoproliferation.
# Afib with RVR: This appears to be new onset and began at [**Last Name (un) 4199**] during colonoscopy prep.
She was started on pressors after her drain was placed, and her blood pressure continued to improve.
Her blood pressures remained in the 130-140 range on the floor.
Lorazepam Intensol 2 mg/mL Concentrate Sig: 1-2 mg PO q30min as needed for seizure.
A blood clot was found in a vein in your leg so a filter was placed in your vein to help prevent it from moving.
