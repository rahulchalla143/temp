Compared to the prior study there has been interval increase in the amount of right upper lung collapse with associated expansion of the right lower lung.
Course was complicated by a pancytopenia, febrile neutropenia, and respiratory issues.
She was initially on sevelamer and aluminum hydroxide for hyperphosphatemia which were d/cd when phosphate levels returned to [**Location 213**].
And etoposide expect decrease counts [**10-31**] d. CBC was checked [**Hospital1 **].
She was switched to her own room, put on neutropenic precautions, and a neutropenic diet.
b. Anemia- Tranfusion criteria was 21 given that she had no comorbid disease and baseline Hct around 30.
Iron studies were consistent with ACD.
c. Thrombocytopenia- transfused for platelets <20 or bleeding.
Her O2 Sats went to the mid-80s on RA and she was put on O2.
This was changed to a prednisone taper.
3 c. diff assays were sent and one of them was positive for c. diff.
Alkalosis-alkalosis on ABG which looked like a metabolic alkalosis.
Lung cancer- with recently diagnosed IIIa SCLC s/p cisplatin and etoposide as above.
Leukocytosis- WBC peaked in 80.7, and came down to 50K on discharge.
C diff came back positive and it was thought that it was a combination of c. diff + lung ca.
Pt will get WBC checked as an outpt.
Continued albuterol, salmeterol, and fluticasone inhalers.
[**Name (NI) 12329**] Held pt's hyzaar (HCTZ/losartan) given renal failure and eventually also d/cd verapamil as pt's BP was ~100 without medications.

Her eye exam was fine.
Disp:*qs 1* Refills:*0* 11.
