Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p cardiac catheterization without any intervention CABG x 4 (LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM2, OM3, PDA)/MV repair with 28mm annuloplasty band.
History of Present Illness: 76 yo female with PMH HTN, hyperlipidemia, presumed CHF/CAD now being evaluated for acute respiratory distress and renal dysfunction while in cath lab holding area for evaluation of acute coronary syndrome.
Labs were notable for troponin 3.8, CPK 326 with MB 61.
Creatinine ranged from 1.5 to peak 2.3.
No echo or cath was performed during that hospitalization.
EKG performed at PCP's office reportedly showed inferolateral ST depressions.
She was sent to OSH ED where she was reportedly found to have K of 7.4, creatinine 3.0, bicarb of 12.
Past Medical History: poorly controlled HTN hypercholesterolemia CHF OA gout   Social History: lives alone in [**Location (un) **] Denies tobacco, ETOH, drugs  Family History: mother with glomerulonephritis sister with MI at age 70 brother with MI in 30s  Physical Exam: p55, 143/70, 98% 6Lnc Gen: lying in bed, mild dyspnea, no acute distress HEENT: MMM, clear OP, JVP difficult to assess CVS: RRR, no s1 s2, no m/g/r Lungs: bilateral crackles 2/3 up from base Abd: soft, NT, ND, +BS Ext: trace edema bilaterally Neuro: nonfocal  Pertinent Results: Hematology   COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT WBC RBC Hgb Hct MCV MCH MCHC RDW Plt Ct [**2156-12-13**] 05:51AM    6.0 3.53* 10.1* 30.0* 85 28.6 33.6 13.8 258   BASIC COAGULATION Plt Ct [**2156-12-13**] 05:51AM    258  Chemistry   RENAL & GLUCOSE Glucose UreaN Creat Na K Cl HCO3 AnGap [**2156-12-13**] 05:51AM    86 72* 2.2* 136 4.5 96 29 16   CHEMISTRY TotProt Albumin Globuln Calcium Phos Mg UricAcd Iron  [**2156-12-13**] 05:51AM          8.5 4.4 1.9  RADIOLOGY  Final Report  PELVIS, NON-OBSTETRIC  [**2156-11-30**] 4:34 PM  PELVIS, NON-OBSTETRIC  Reason: please assess Lt adenxal mass  INDICATIONS: A 6-cm left ovarian cyst seen on MRI.
PELVIC ULTRASOUND: Transabdominal examination was performed.
Followup imaging in 3 months is recommended to assure stability of the cyst.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Since previous chest x-ray, the nasogastric tube test and mediastinal tubes have all been removed.
Atelectasis of the left base is present.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and pt had a peak CK of 335.
Pt has cardiac cath performed on [**11-22**] with showed severe diffuse 3 vessel disease (see results section for details).
Pre-op studies were initiated.
Ultrasound of the carotids revealed right ICA with 80-99% occlusion and L ICA with 40% occlusion.
MRI/MRA of brain found no acute stroke and occlused left vertebral artery; all other intracranial vessels were open.
Neuro stated that cardotid stenting could be performed either before or after CABG and left it up to the discretion of the CT surgeon.
On arrival to the CCU, K still elevated at 6.8.
Pt was given D50/insulin, lasix, and kayexalate with improvement in potassium to 6.0.
EKG initially showed junctional rhythm with peaked T waves.
By HD2, K was 5.6, EKG changes were resolved, and pt appeared less volume overloaded with resolution of respiratory distress.
Pt was seen by renal who suggested 1 amp of bicarb q6 x 24h to treat bicarb of 16; these was given with improvement in bicarb to 22.
Over the next several days, creatinine slowly improved to low of 1.7.
Pt was able to undergo cardiac cath on [**11-22**].
After the procedure, creatinine slowly increased to 2.7, likely secondary to prerenal etiology.
Pt had TTE performed which showed  LV systolic dysfunction with EF 30-35% and mild symmetric ventricular hypertrophy.
On HD3, pt appeared euvolemic with good urine output and diuretics were discontinued.
Each time, BP normalized with lopressor.
Her blood pressure was well-controlled on metoprolol with systolic BP ranging from 95-160 sytolic.
MRI of the abdomen showed mild bilateral renal artery stenosis.
MRI of the pelvis showed 6-cm thick-walled cystic mass in the left adnexa without focal or nodular areas of enhancement.
Pelvic ultrasound was performed and showed 6-cm avascular cystic structure in the left adnexa with internal debris with a fluid debris level.
Pt was transfused on HD6 with 1 unit of blood for hct of 27.3 with appropriate bump to 30.6.
Her hct fluctuated from 27-30.
Her creatinine eventually came down and on POD#7 she was transferred to the floor in stable condition.
She continued to diurese and her creatinine came down to 2.2.
