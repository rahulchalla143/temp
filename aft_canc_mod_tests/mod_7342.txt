CT head revealed hemorrhagic right sided mass with significant edema and MLS.
Pt given Dexamethasone 10mg IV and Keppra 500mg IV and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch bilaterally.
Toes mute bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger bilat  Handedness Right  PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE: **  Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2149-7-27**]: Hyperdense right frontotemporal mass with marked surrounding edema and associated heterotopic irregular bone formation abutting the right anterior clinoid processes, causing leftward subfalcine herniation and possibly early downward transtentorial herniation.
MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST [**2149-7-27**]: 1.
No significant change in comparison with the prior head CT examination.
CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM [**2149-7-28**]: The right middle cerebral artery was superior and posterior to the tumor.
The predominant blood supply is from the right internal carotid artery, ophthalmic artery and cavernous branches.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2149-7-29**]: Small focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the region of right temporal meningioma resection, with expected post-operative changes, and no  difference in mass effect from the pre-operative exam.
PATHOLOGY [**2149-7-29**]:  **pending**  MR HEAD W/ AND W/O CONTRAST [**2149-7-30**]: Post-operative changes with findings suggesting residual neoplasm medially.
On [**7-28**], her exam was improved and her mannitol was decreased to 12.5g Q6H.
She was taken to angiogram for evaluation of vasculature.
Post-operative head CT demonstrated small focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the region of right temporal meningioma resection, with expected post-operative changes.
On [**2149-7-30**], POD #1, patient's examination improved significantly.
Post-op head MRI revealed post-operative changes with findings suggesting residual neoplasm medially, stable uncal herniation with  mass effect on the right cerebral peduncle, and restricted diffusion in the right temporal lobe could represent acute ischemia or post operative cytotoxic edema.
