CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2178-3-29**] 5:21 AM FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimally improved ventilation at both lung bases.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2178-3-30**] 4:41 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-24**] and 16: Right apical pleural tube still in place.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2178-3-30**] at 9:59:30 AM      FINAL  IMPRESSION: Small to moderate pericardial effusion without overt tamponade physiology.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2178-3-31**] at 11:32:22 AM FINAL IMPRESSION: Limited/focused views.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2178-4-2**] at 11:21:12 AM FINAL IMPRESSION: Small to moderate pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2178-4-2**] 10:33 AM There is no evident pneumothorax.
The patient has known mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy and multiple lung nodules, all are better seen in prior CT of [**3-6**].
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2178-4-3**] 8:41 AM FINDINGS: Bilateral parenchymal opacities are unchanged to slightly worse.
Repeat CXR at that time showed re accumulation of pleural fluid, possibly due to clogged chest tube/pleurex, as his output had been decreasing.
However, in the ICU, his chest tube output increased again with improvement in his CXR and subjective dyspnea.
He did not have any evidence of volume overload on physical exam and also did not have an elevated pulsus.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended observation with repeat echocardiogram which were performed.
He was discharged with a follow up appointment with cardiology and should have another echo in [**1-12**] weeks post discharge.
His cardiac enzymes were negative.
