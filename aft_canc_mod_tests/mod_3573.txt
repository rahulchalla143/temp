She was referred to an OSH ER where CXRs were obtained.
On her way home from the OSH ER she was contact[**Name (NI) **] by her primary care physician who told her to go to [**Hospital1 18**] ER because her CXR was concerning for a mass in her chest.
CT chest demonstrated diffuse LAD (+/- mass) and postobstructive pneumonia.
This is a new finding, although there are no other CT scans in our system.

Pertinent Results: STUDIES: ECG Study Date of [**2159-2-14**] 2:40:38 AM Sinus rhythm with frequent atrial premature beats.
Compared to tracing #1 frequency of atrial premature beats has significantly increased.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 97 0 82 398/462 0 42 60 .
Endobronchial biopsy could be performed for further evaluation.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-12-25**], the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are reduced.
[**2159-2-15**] CT ABDOMEN/ PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: 1.
Further imaging with MR recommended.
Further imaging recommended.
Further evaluation with MR recommended.
Further imaging with MR recommended.
Ultrasound (or MR) could evaluate this finding, though these likely represent cysts.
The expanded right hemithorax shows no evidence of acute pneumonia.
Additional small 7-mm segment IV-B lesion along the anterior liver margin of similar enhancement characteristics which could also represent metastases.
Hepatic ultrasound could be performed to assess as to whether the dominant lesion is amenable to ultrasound-guided biopsy, and whether further characterization of any of the smaller lesions is possible.
Cell marker analysis was attempted, but was non-diagnostic in this case due to insufficient numbers of cells for analysis.

The patient showed improved aeration on pulmonary exam for remainder of hospital course.
# Large Cell Lung CA - As below, the pulmonary service performed a bronchoscopy which showed external compression of her left mainstem bronchus.
The patient underwent biopsy/FNA, which showed large cell carcinoma.
Gran ct > 5000 by time of discharge with no recurrence of neutropenia.
While on the floor, she had a bronchoscopy performed which showed external compression of her left mainstem bronchus, and she had a biopsy/FNA performed, which showed large cell carcinoma.
She was then readmitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with atrial fibrillation with HR 130s, and was started on a diltiazem gtt.
She was briefly called out, but developed HR 160s, w/EKG c/w AF with RVR, for which she received metoprolol 5 mg IV x2, followed by diltiazem 10 mg IV x2 without conversion.
Her blood pressure was low-normal on this regimen (90s-100s/ 50s-60s), so she was started on digoxin 0.0625mg for additional HR control with good effect (HR ~ 100 by time of discharge).
Anticoagulation was not pursued as the patient has a high risk of bleeding given large tumor burden and a CHADS score of 0. .
CXR was consistent with worsening edema in the remaining lung (known L lung collapse).
She required BiPaP for an ABG which showed hypercarbia to 60.
The patient was transfused a total of 2u PRBC per oncology recommendations to keep hct > 22.
Hct on discharge was 25.9. .

If you experience any fevers > 100.5, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, abdominal pain, nausea/ vomiting/ diarrhea, or any other concerning symptoms please contact your PCP or go to the ER for further evaluation.
You will need a CT scan of the torso before this appointment.
