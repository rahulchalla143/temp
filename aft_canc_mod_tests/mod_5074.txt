Blood cultures [**2143-10-27**]: No growth to date Urine Cultures [**2143-10-27**]: No growth to date .
Chest X-ray [**2143-10-27**]: Mild interstitial edema.
ECG [**2143-10-27**]: Sinus tachycardia w/ APCs @ 110, 1mm ST depressions in v3-v5, TWI v1-v2 (unchanged.)
Pelvic CT [**2143-10-27**]: 1.
Transthoracic Echo [**2143-10-28**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
V/Q Scan [**2143-10-28**]: Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.
Persantine Mibi [**2143-10-28**]: Predominantly fixed distal anterior wall and apical defect.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled and CKs were flat with an elevated Troponin felt to be due to his renal function.
He had a pelvic CT and ultrasound for concerns for groin infection with recent surgery and these studies were reassuring that he did not have an infection, but he was kept on the antibiotics for a total 10 day course.
For his tachycardia, he underwent a V/Q scan for concern for pulmonary embolism which was low probability.
He had a persatine thallium study to evaluate his coronaries which showed a fixed lesion and normal stress portion.
For his renal function, his creatinine was checked daily and he was given no further Lasix.
On discharge, his final blood cultures were still pending.
You had an echocardiogram showing normal heart function.
