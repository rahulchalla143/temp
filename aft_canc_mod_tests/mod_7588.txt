She was transported to an OSH where she was intubated to allow for CT imaging.
CT at OSH suggested a question of a brain aneurysm or mass.
She was hypotensive at the OSH and was started on phenylephrine; the thought was she had dropped her pressures because of sedation.
She was quickly weaned off pressors, and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Upon arrival to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], she had repeated imaging of her head which revealed no aneurysm or bleed, however there was noted left sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] meningioma which is potentially chronic.
A bedside echo was done which showed good contractility despite the bradycardia.
At time of arrival to MICU, her HR was 110, BP was 120/70, and she was hypothermic with temp of 95.

Close clinical monitoring and bedside EEG monitoring is recommended to evaluate for change or improvement.
[**2184-12-28**] CT HEAD 1.
Dense calcification identified below the level of the III ventricle and anterior to the cistern of the lamina terminalis the possibility of a partially thrombosed aneurysm in the ACA territory is a consideration, correlation with MRI and MRA of the with and without contrast is recommended.
[**2184-12-28**] CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS The ET tube is a little far advanced and should be retracted a few centimeters.

The patient is scheduled to undergo an MRI for further evaluation.
[**2184-12-31**] MRI HEAD, MRA BRAIN, MRI NECK 1.
her neurologic exam fluctuated, with intermittent loss of brainstem functions (gag, pupillary reaction).
Neurology was consulted and felt that her exam was consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.
MRI suggested watershed infarcts which support the theory of hypotensive damage, though no hypotension was documented prior to her transfer.
