[**2102-8-29**]: CT removed, resolution of gastric distension, started on clears without difficulty.
Started on PO lopressor and received one unit of packed red cells for a hematocrit 28.6->29.8.
hematocrit remained stable, started on vancomycin + cefepime for empiric HAP coverage given GPC and GNR on gram stain of BAL.
started on heparin gtt in preparation for cardioversion [**2105-9-3**]: attempted cardioversion by cardiology failed, spontaneously converted to SR, BAL cultures grew out pan-sensitive pseudomonas for which ID recommended double coverage with cefepime + cipro x 14 days total course, vancomycin stopped.
Report to the [**Location (un) 861**] Radiology Department for a Chest X-Ray 45 minutes before your appointment.
