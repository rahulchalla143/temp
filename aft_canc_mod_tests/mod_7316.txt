Admission Date:  [**2134-9-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-10-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-10-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Bactrim Ds  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: Pancreatic Tail Mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Laparoscopic Distal Pancreatectomy Intraoperative Ultrasound   History of Present Illness: This 48-year-old woman has a history of significant diabetes as well as many of comorbid conditions including Raynaud's, irritable bowel syndrome, peripheral [**First Name3 (LF) 1106**] disease and cardiac disease.
she received a CAT scan of the abdomen for some reason, and this picked up an incidental lesion in the tail of the pancreas that was around a centimeter in size.
Furthermore, a liver/spleen scan showed that this was not a splenule.
Pertinent Results: CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2134-10-6**] 10:49 AM  CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: r/o infiltrate  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48 year old woman with aspiration event 7 days ago, now with fever.
TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral views of the chest.
FINDINGS: Doppler evaluation was performed of both lower extremity arterial systems at rest.
Pulse volume recordings show drop off at the ankle level and are flat line at the metatarsals.
Ankle-brachial index is 0.59.
CT TRACHEA W/O C W/3D REND  [**2134-10-4**] 3:30 PM  CT TRACHEA W/O C W/3D REND  Reason: dynamic airway CT to eval for malacia  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48F s/p aspiration PNA< with ?
CT TRACHEA, DATED [**2134-10-4**]  INDICATION: Aspiration pneumonia.
CT of the trachea was performed according to the CT trachea protocol.
This included a standard-dose end inspiratory CT scan followed by a low-dose dynamic expiratory CT of the central airways.
The patient had difficulty cooperating with the various components of the examination including end inspiration, dynamic expiration and coughing, somewhat limiting the evaluation.
For example, in the proximal trachea at the level of the compression deformity, the cross-sectional area decreases from 143 mm2 to 72 mm2.
At the proximal right main stem bronchus, cross-sectional area decreases from 121 mm2 to 55 mm2 and at the proximal left main bronchus, the cross-sectional area decreases from 114 mm2 to 42 mm2.
Within the lungs, there are multifocal patchy areas of consolidation and ground glass attenuation, which are overall improved compared to the recent chest CTA of [**2134-9-30**].
The entirety of the lung bases was not included on this study which was tailored to the airways, limiting complete assessment of the lung parenchyma.
These nodes are prominent in number but without change since the recent chest CTA.
Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2134-10-1**]    PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION: Indication: Left ventricular function.

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 80% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: 3.0 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
CHEST PORTABLE: Comparison is made to a prior study of [**2134-9-30**].
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2134-9-30**] 11:56 AM  CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  Reason: eval for pe  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48F pod #1, with desats REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for pe CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CTA OF THE CHEST  CLINICAL HISTORY: 48-year-old woman postop day #1 post-resection of pancreatic tail lesion, with desaturation.
These findings are stable compared to prior studies and most likely represent the presence of prior granulomatous disease.
Multiplanar reformatted images were useful in the delineation of the above findings.
US INTR-OP 60 MINS  [**2134-9-29**] 7:36 AM  US INTR-OP 60 MINS  Reason: PANC MASS ,LAPAROSCOPIC DISTAL PANCREATECTOMY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48 year old woman with pancreatic abnormality REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy [**2134-9-29**] 9:30am CLINICAL INDICATION: A small hypervascular tumor of the distal pancreas seen on CT scan, for localization and laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy.
Laparoscopic ultrasound images of the pancreas were performed via a right upper quadrant port, using a curved array transducer at 7.5 MHz frequency.
A 7 x 8 mm hypoechoic nodule was seen in the distal body of the pancreas, corresponding to the lesion identified on CT scan.

An EKG did not show any changes.
A CTA showed no PE, atelectatic collapse of Right lung.
A CXR showed large areas of multilobar air space opacity c/w consolidation in RUL, RLL, and LLL as well as discoid atelectasis in the left mid zone (question aspiration).
A CXR on [**10-1**] showed increasing R lung consolidation.
She was still needing respiratory support as her sats were low and she was needing high O2 requirements.
A urine analysis and culture were done for fever on [**2134-10-6**] and showed UTI.
On [**2134-10-7**], cellulitis was noted around [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain site and the Cipro was stopped and she was started on Vanc/Levo/Flagyl IV.
A wound swab from the JP site revealed STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
Echo [**10-1**]: The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Pulses: B-fem palp; R-PT & L-DP/PT dopp.
