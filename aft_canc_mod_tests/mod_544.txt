Normal IVC diameter (<2.1cm) with <35% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure indeterminate).
Hyperdynamic LVEF >75%.
TDI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-12-16**], the heart rate is higher and the left ventricular systolic function is more vigorous.
If neurologic abnormalities are referred to this area, followup study could be performed for further evaluation.

By Kappa/Lambda light chain immunostaining, the plasma cells are kappa restricted.
The white blood cell count appears mildly increased.
Differential count shows 82% neutrophils, 0% bands, 3% monocytes, 13% lymphocytes, 2% eosinophils.
Erythroid precursors are decreased and show normoblastic maturation.
Differential shows: 0% Blasts, 0% Promyelocytes, 2% Myelocytes, 10% Metamyelocytes, 33% Bands/Neutrophils, 25% Plasma cells, 13% Lymphocytes, 17% Erythroid.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and shows variably cellular bone marrow (10-20%) overall, 15%.
[**12-21**] Renal biopsy showed global glomeruli distruction.
He was briefly hypotense overnight [**1-12**] to SBP 70s and MAPs 40 while sleeping but once awaked, BP normalized.
C diff was negative x1.
While pt was in ICU, he did have a bedside TTE which showed EF 75% with mild LVH suggestive of possible diastolic dysfunction.
#Ischemic colitis: As mentioned above surgical invervention was avoided and HCT remained stable with transfusions.
The bloody bowel movements stoped with improved blood pressure and the HCT remained stable for days prior to discharge .
