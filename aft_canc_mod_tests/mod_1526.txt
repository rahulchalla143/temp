Patient initially thought the pain was coming from his gallbladder - he requested a RUQ U/S from his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] which a mass was discovered in his liver.
CT with po and IV contrast was then obtained to better define the mass and confirmed a large mass in his left lobe.
Per patient's report, the biopsy of the mass was nondiagnostic, however he was told it was likely a leiomyosarcoma based on the location.
He was due to get an EUS on [**3-3**].
In the ED, SBP was 120 and HR was in the 70s.
He was admitted to the MICU for serial HCTs and for EGD.
The mass was quite friable and started to ooze a bit with manipulation, and so a biopsy was unable to be obtained.

Serial hcts were checked and he was transfused 2 units of pRBCs.
An emergent EGD was performed which revealed a large 6cm submucosal lesion with 3 areas of ulceration.
A biopsy was not performed as the tissue looked very friable.
They recommended obtaining a biopsy of the liver mass to establish a tissue diagnosis.
The patient therefore underwent ultrasound-guided biopsy of the liver mass on [**2177-3-4**].
On the same day, the patient underwent spiral CT with triple phase contrast to better define the liver metastases.
Once these images were obtained, the hepatobiliary team was consulted about possible resectability.
His hct had been stable and he had no more episodes of melena.
