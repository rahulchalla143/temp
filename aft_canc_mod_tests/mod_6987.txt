EMS was called and he had a sat of 79% which increased to 94% on a NRB.
EKG with STD v4-v6.
He was noted to have chronic venous stasis changes and his BNP was ~1200, so he was given lasix 20mg as thought was pulmonary edema.
CTA was discussed with patient by attending given CKD (Cr 1.5 which is baseline) and patient declined CT as he is also s/p nephrectomy.
He initially was able to be weaned to 4L nc, but after CT was worsening and was put back on non-invasive ventilation.

CXR ([**5-24**]): 1.
Nodular opacity in the left mid lung corresponds to pulmonary nodule on subsequent CT consistent with metastasis.
CT Head ([**5-24**]):  No evidence of metastatic disease in this non-contrast CT head.
An MRI is more sensitive for more sensitive for metastatic disease .
CT Chest ([**5-24**]): 1.
Multiple pulmonary nodules in both lungs with bibasilar consolidations and interstitial thickening also suggesting metastatic disease, please refer to the report of the dedicated CT of the chest performed concurrently.
TTE ([**5-25**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CXR ([**5-25**]): In comparison with the study of [**5-24**], there is increase in the bilateral pulmonary opacifications, most likely consistent with pulmonary edema and underlying metastatic disease (seen on prior CT scan).
CXR ([**5-26**]): In comparison with the study of [**5-25**], there is little overall change.
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications again are most likely reflective of pulmonary edema and underlying metastatic disease that was seen on the previous CT scan.
Hypoxic Respiratory distress: Patient with hypoxia in the setting of flash pulmonary edema, chest xray at admission showed right sided opacity and bilateral infiltrates consistent with edema and pneumonia.
Sputum cultures were sent and showed only commensal respiratory flora.
Echocardiogram showed normal global biventricular systolic function and there was no significant pathology seen at the valves.
CK peak was 250's, and MB peaked at 14 and subsequently down-trended within 24 hours.
Troponin peak was 0.20 and down trended.
Repeat EKG did not show acute ischemic changes, and the patient was started on ASA 325mg daily and high dose statin after LFTs returned normal.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: The patient's oncologist was called and per discussion, his lung metastases were considered unlikely to be cause of his acute respiratory distress.
Medications on Admission: Simvastatin 20mg daily Oxycodone HCl 5mg Q6 Pentoxifylline 400mg TID [**Doctor Last Name 1819**] Aspirin 325mg daily Indomethacin 25mg 6 tabs per day Lidocain/Nystatin/Mag 2 teaspoons before meal  Discharge Medications: 1. simvastatin 10 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Please continue to take care of this ulcer as you were before with help at the VA. You also had an echocardiogram of your heart which was showed normal function and valves.
MEDICATION CHANGES: - START levofloxacin (ending [**5-29**]) - START hydralazine for blood pressure as prescribed - HOLD lisinopril until discussed with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) 102943**] until discussed with PCP .
Hydralazine (a blood pressure medication) was started while you were in the ICU and medical floor.
Please continue this on discharge, but discuss with your PCP if he would like to change this to another blood pressure medication.
