He had been doing well until a restaging scan was done on [**7-20**], which demonstrated persistence of the three lesions associated with significant edema of the left posterior lesions, if not slightly bigger, as well another new lesion in the left parietal lobe.
The multi disciplinary decision was made to go ahead with the cyberknife treatment, and hold off on resection, if his symptoms improved.

This corresponds to findings from recent MRI of [**2198-7-20**] at outside hospital.
MRI Head [**8-8**]: 1.
Limited study done for planning surgery.
CT Head [**8-9**]: No acute hemorrhage, mass affect, or new infarct identified.
MRI Head [**8-10**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Post-surgical soft tissue edema  CT Head [**8-10**]: 1.
CTA Head [**8-11**]: IMPRESSION: Interval enlargement of the temporal ventricular horns with air in the left temporal ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**], contiguous surveillance is recommended to rule out hydrocephalus.
MRI Head [**8-11**]: 1.
a post op Head CT demonstrated no hemorrhage, and post op MRI showed persistent but unchanged vasogenic edema.
A stat head CT was performed, which did not demonstrate any specific rationale for the patient's change in mental status.
His exam deteriorated, as his pupils became unreactive and he lost all bowel function.
He was placed in 24 hour EEG monitoring, but no specific seizure activity was recorded.
Over the weekend on [**8-4**] the patient remained intubated and with very minimal neurologic exam; his pupils remained non-reactive, and the EEG recordings were still negative for any seizure activity.
An MRI was obtained which was suspicious for infarct near the resection cavity.
At this time blood cultures showed gram negative rods and he was started on meropenem 500mg IV q6.
On [**8-14**] the Dexamethasone and mannitol were tapered, and the Keppra was D/C'd on [**8-15**] in order to obtain a more thorough physical exam.
The EEG monitoring was continued to monitor for epileptiform activity which was negative.
[**2118-8-16**] The patient underwent a repeat head ct and this showed no change from his previous ct scan.
The patient's previous parenchymal edema did persist but again was unchanged from previous exams.
His neurologic exam did improve somewhat on [**8-16**].
His LUE did have some weak withdrawl but no spontaneous movement.
Pt did have a fever on this day but repeat blood, urine and sputum cultures all proved to be negative.
