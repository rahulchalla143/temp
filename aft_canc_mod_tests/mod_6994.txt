[**2147-7-25**] Bedside TTE during CPR: Emergency study during a "code" while CPR is performed.
Several subcostal images taken during CPR and during pulse check demonstrating cardiac stand-still.
Brief Hospital Course: On admission pt was noted to be delirious but initially had HR 70s and BP 110s/70s.
EKG showed rate in 70s with P waves before most QRS complexes.
At 20:35 pt developed sudden onset of bradycardia to the 50s and hypotension with BP 70s/40s.
Pt was given multiple doses of epinephrine during code and bedside ECHO showed no pericardial fluid but an akinetic myocardium.
