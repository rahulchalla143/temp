However, his gastric lavage was negative in the ED and repeat EGD in house showed only mild gastritis without evidence of active bleeding.
A lower source seemed less likely given melanotic stools as well as a recent colonoscopy at outside hospital which showed multiple polyps which were removed at that time.
He received a total of 4 units PRBCs over the course of the admission with appropriate response in his hematocrit and no further evidence of bleeding.
Following his EGD, he was restarted on an IV dose of lasix equivalent to his po home dose.
However, his blood pressures became low.
