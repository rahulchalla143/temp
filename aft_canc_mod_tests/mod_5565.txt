The patient reports that he frequently uses a home O2 monitor along with his CPAP.
As of a few weeks ago, he was able to walk on a treadmill for ~5 minutes without significant SOB.
In the ED inital vitals were, HR 78, O2 80% RA.
Labs were significant for WBC 2.4 (baseline [**6-1**]), plts 107 (baseline 200s), lactate 1.6, and Cr 1.3 (baseline).
CXR showed worsening mid to lower lung ground-glass opacities which may reflect worsening bronchoalveolar carcinoma versus superimposed pneumonia.
EKG was unchanged from prior.
Vitals at the time of transfer were: 98.0 80 109/49 22 90 6L (Pt baseline at home 90-92 on [**4-30**] L)  On arrival to the ICU, the patient's VS: 97.9 81 111/65  24 94% NRB 15L O2.
CT scan done on [**2160-4-1**], while admitted for treatment for pneumonia, demonstrated widespread ground-glass opacities, more severe in the right lower lobe with increased number of mediastinal lymph nodes.
A transbronchial biopsy on [**2160-4-3**] showed a pathology suspicious for bronchioalveolar carcinoma.
A PET scan done on [**2160-4-17**] showed a FDG-avid area of lobar ground glass opacity with bowing of the intralobar fissure involving the right lower lobe compatible with history of pneumonic type bronchoalveolar carcinoma, though given high avidity may represent superinfection in this region.
He also had interval improvement in the left lower lobe and right middle lobe ground-glass opacity since the chest CT from [**2160-4-1**].
MRI brain [**2160-4-17**] did not show any evidence of metastases.
An MR of his head at that time showed new cortical T2/FLAIR-hyperintensity along the medial aspect of  the left frontal lobe, and extending along the base of the left frontal lobe  and the orbitofrontal gyrus in the anterior cranial fossa.
Physical Exam: Admission Exam: Vitals: 97.9 81 111/65  24 94% NRB 15L O2 General: Alert, oriented, speaking in full sentences HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Course breath sounds scattered bilaterally.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: [**2162-11-22**] 03:00PM BLOOD WBC-2.4* RBC-3.79* Hgb-12.3* Hct-35.8* MCV-95 MCH-32.4* MCHC-34.2 RDW-13.5 Plt Ct-107* [**2162-11-22**] 03:00PM BLOOD Neuts-50.1 Lymphs-44.0* Monos-1.4* Eos-3.6 Baso-0.9 [**2162-11-22**] 03:00PM BLOOD Glucose-129* UreaN-27* Creat-1.3* Na-140 K-3.7 Cl-105 HCO3-26 AnGap-13 [**2162-11-22**] 03:00PM BLOOD LD(LDH)-187 [**2162-11-23**] 03:31AM BLOOD Calcium-9.5 Phos-2.4* Mg-1.5* [**2162-11-22**] 10:43PM BLOOD Type-ART pO2-55* pCO2-29* pH-7.47* calTCO2-22 Base XS-0 [**2162-11-22**] 03:09PM BLOOD Lactate-1.6  CXR [**2162-11-22**]: FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
Allowing for differences in CT technique, since [**2162-10-14**], multifocal ground-glass opacities predominantly in bilateral lower lobe have progressed, which is marked in left lower lung.
ABDOMEN: ThiS study is not designed for assessment of subdiaphragmatic pathologies; however, limited views are unremarkable.
ECG [**2162-11-22**];Normal sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2160-12-27**] no diagnostic interval  change.

# Hypoxia/pneumonia:Chest CTA done and was negative for a PE but did show bilateral infiltrate suggestive of bilateral pneumonia although progression of disease is also a possibility.
Influenza swab negative  and  oseltamavir discontinued.
Blood cultures remained negative.
B-glucan was 66 (low intermediate) and informal infectious disease consult recommended repeating test which is pending at the time of discharge.
Outpatient Lab Work Check chem 10 and vancomycin trough in AM, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD to adjust vancomycin dose 17. guaifenesin 100 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: 5-10 MLs PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for cough.
You were initially admitted to the intensive care unit.A chest CT angio scan showed no evidence of a blood clot but did show that you had pneumonia.You were treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for the  pneumonia.
