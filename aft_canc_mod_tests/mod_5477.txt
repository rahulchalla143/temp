MRI OF THE BRAIN:[**2101-1-2**] (POSTOP) Extensive postsurgical changes are noted in the right frontal region consistent with recent surgery.
A followup MRI is recommended in two to three weeks for further evaluation.
[**1-6**] CT Head: Essentially stable study compared to the previous examination.
[**1-22**] CT Torso: 1.
This may be related to recent placement of a percutaneous gastrostomy tube, but correlation with examination and laboratory findings is recommended.
Correlation with physical exam is requested.
An MRI may be helpful for further evaluation.
This may be related to instrumentation, but correlation with urinalysis is requested.
A 3-month CT followup could be considered if clinically indicated.
Immediate postoperative neurologic exam was lethargic, speech unintelligible, moves right side spontaneously.
On [**2101-1-7**], his abdomen was noted to be distended a KUB showed an ileus and LFTs were slightly elevated.
He was made NPO started, NG tube was put to low intermittent suction on on [**2101-1-10**] his repeat KUB showed improvement in the ileus.
Urine cultures taken on [**2101-1-17**] showed E. coli resistant to Cipro, switched to Augmentin.
Examination at the time of transfer to Oncology:  Eyes open spont.
The urine culture grew E. coli resistant to TMP/SMX and ciprofloxacin, so the patient was switched to augmentin to complete the course of treatment.
Culture again grew E. coli with similar sensitivities, so he was treated with ceftriaxone for 1 week.
A follow up urine culture grew 10,000-100,000 colonies of vancomycin resistant enterococcus, but the UA at that time was negative and the patient was afebrile and had a normal WBC count so this was considered likely to be a colonizer.
A repeat swallow evaluation prior to discharge was done, and the patient was then allowed to take small amounts of pureed food and nectar prethickened liquids with supervision for comfort.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO every eight (8) hours.
