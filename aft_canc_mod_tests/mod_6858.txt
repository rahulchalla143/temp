Head CT showed midline shift with subfalcine and uncal herniation in the setting of tumor progression.
On re-admission on [**2197-7-7**] for a scheduled cycle of methotrexate and rituximab, her examination was notable for an alert metnal status, poor language fluency and comprehension, equal pupils, right lower facial droop,  3/5 strength in the right upper extremity, 1-2/5 in the right lower extremity, absent ankle jerk, upgoing right toe, and impaired pain sensation on the right side of body.
MRI was read as revealing no change in her intracranial mass, surrounding edema or mass effect/midline shift; though her primary neuro-oncologist did think there was some progression with mild worsening of midline shift.
Had non-diagnostic brain biopsy on [**2197-4-26**].
Second brain biopsy confirmed primary CNS lymphoma on [**2197-6-2**].
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAMINATION ([**2197-7-7**])  VITAL SIGNS: Temperature is 98.6 F axillary, pulse is 85, blood pressure is  161/92, respiratory rate is 11, and oxygen saturation is 98% in room air, and weight is 85.7 kg.
GENERAL: Responsing to painful stimuli only.
PULMONARY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE ([**2197-7-27**]):  Neurological Examination: Her Karnofsky Performance Score is 50.
Her reflexes are 0.
Sensory examination is notable to grimace when pain stimuli are applied to the extremities.
Pertinent Results: [**2197-7-7**]: Na 138, K 3.4, Cl 102, bicarb 28, BUN/Cr 11/0.3, glucose 115, Ca 9.8, Mg 2.1, Phos 2.9, WBC 5.5, Hct 28.0, platelets 152.
ALT 54, AST 12, LDH 417, T Bili 0.8.
INR 1.2, PTT 42.6 MTX 5.3  [**2197-7-8**]: Imaging: MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] ([**2197-7-8**]): Prelim report with no change in size of the mass surrounding edema, ventricular size and periventricular edema compared to the previous MRI of [**2197-7-1**].
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] ([**2197-7-1**]): Again a large enhancing mass is identified in the left basal ganglia region with mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
Compared to the prior study, the enhancing component of the brain and the lesion in the corpus callosum and also in the left subfrontal region has decreased.
IMPRESSION: Since the previous MRI examination, the component of the tumor seen in the basal ganglia may have slightly increased in size but the enhancing lesions in the corpus callosum and left subfrontal region have decreased.
Chest X-Ray ([**2197-7-7**]): New left-sided PICC line positioned in the left brachiocephalic vein.
MRI obtained on transfer on [**2197-7-8**] showed no interval development of acute ischemia or hemorrhage, but there was evidence of midline shift.
EEG was negative for status epilepticus.
Repeat head CT on [**2197-7-14**] showed decreased midline shift and edema, and neurologic examination (right-sided weakness and facial droop) improved on transfer back to floor.
CT scan showed bowel dilatation and gas in the portal system.
She was started on a course of piperacillin-Tazobactam on [**2197-7-15**] with an intended course of 14 days, last day on [**2197-7-29**].
The patient's vital signs remained stable and no peritoneal findings were noted.
Hypertension: Patient's systolic blood pressure reached a peak of 190-200, secondary to increased intracranial pressure, and recovered with mannitol infusion to SBP 150s on transfer.
Levetiracetam 500 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: One (1)  Intravenous Q12H (every 12 hours).
Followup Instructions: Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 640**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4861**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1844**] Date/Time:[**2197-8-14**] 1:00
