She was sent here for further evaluation and care.

BLOOD CX [**9-18**], [**9-21**]: PENDING .
PA/lateral CXR FINDINGS: The heart and mediastinal contours are stable with cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence.
NON-CONTRAST CT SCAN OF THE HEAD: There has been no change from the previous examination of [**2115-9-20**].
CT angiogram of intravenous contrast material, multiplanar reformatted images and additional 3-dimensional reconstructed images.
EEG IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due the presence of intermittent slowing in the right posterior quadrant, rasing the possiblity of a focal subcortical dysfunction in that area.
CT PULMONARY ANGIOGRAM WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
CT REFORMATS: Coronal, sagittal, and oblique sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial findings.
This finding should be followed with a CT of the chest in three months if the patient has a primary malignancy; if there is no known primary malignancy, the patient should receive a follow-up chest CT in six months.
MRI EXAMINATION OF THE BRAIN WITH CONTRAST Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain was obtained without and with intravenous gadolinium administration.
Comparison is made to the prior brain MRI from [**2115-7-6**].
The overall exam is degraded by repeated motion artifact.
Post-gadolinium enhancement images are significantly degraded by motion artifact.
Scattered foci of magnetic susceptibility are noted within the left thalamus and right periventricular white matter, unchanged in appearance since the previous exam suggestive of possible small cavernous angiomas or changes related to amyloid angiopathy.
IMPRESSION: Resolution of the previously noted vasogenic edema since the prior exam of [**2115-7-6**], along the right posterior frontal convexity.
Brain MRI was without new findings.
EEG was without epileptic focus but did show encephalopathy.
Neurology was consulted and recommended CTA brain to rule out filling defects.
Her systolic blood pressure has been running in the 120's since ICU callout [**2115-9-24**].
ECHO with suggestion of diastolic CHF but normal EF.
Cardiac enzymes negative x 2 and CTA chest negative for PE.
Patient has been monitored on tele which has only shown SVT up to the 120s but generally in the low 100s.
Recommend follow-up UA and urine culture to confirm resolution.
Her electrolytes and volume status are stable.
She will need a dilantin level rechecked on Tuesday.
Heparin products were stopped and her platelets have since improved to 255.
