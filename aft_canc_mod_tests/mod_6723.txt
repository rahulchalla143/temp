He was admitted for further workup and a MRCP was obtained, demonstrating intra-hepatic ductal dilatation with a filling defect at the biliary confluence.
He was noted to have melanotic stools, and serial laboratory studies demonstrated a drop in his hematocrit of ~10 points (from 40 to 29).
Additionally, he was found to have increasing serum bilirubin levels; at the time of transfer his total bilirubin level was 9.2 (increased from 6 at the time of admission to [**Hospital3 **]).
His lipase was also significantly elevated at 1100, and his amylase was 200.
A CT scan performed emergently on [**4-2**], demonstrated a possible fistula between the stent and a portal venous vessel, and he was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
At the time of transfer, his INR was 1.5, his platelet count was 251, and his hematocrit was 29.6.

On [**4-3**] he underwent a hepatic angiogram which showed no evidence of arterial biliary fistula, but there is a small area of contrast pooling seen on portal venogram in segment VII adjacent to endoscopically placed biliary drain done the same day.
His hematocrit then remained stable through the hospitalization.
Interventional radiology was to attempt a second PTC drain on [**4-5**] through the left side following stent removal by ERCP.
Hydromorphone (PF) 1 mg/mL Syringe Sig: 0.5-1 mg Injection Q3H (every 3 hours) as needed for pain.
Capping drain at this time will likely produce fever and possible infection, please leave open to bag draiange Advance diet as tolerated Continue PO Cipro  Followup Instructions: If patient changes his mind about pursuing second PTC placement and surgery, patient can contact Dr [**Name (NI) 4727**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**]                                [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 707**] MD, [**MD Number(3) 709**]  Completed by:[**2152-4-6**
