She underwent induction for anesthesia with propofol, succ, rocuronium, fentanyl with blood pressure dropping from the systolic 90s to 60s.
Blood pressure currently in 80s-90s prior to transport to MICU.
ECG showed ST depressions in V3-6.
Repeat EKGs showed resolution of ST depressions.

**FINAL REPORT [**2102-4-14**]**    URINE CULTURE (Final [**2102-4-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
Blood culture pending .
IMAGING CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2102-4-12**]: PRE-PROCEDURE IMAGING: Limited unenhanced CT scan of the abdomen which demonstrated a macro-nodular contour of the liver with mild segmental atrophy in segment V consistent with known cirrhosis.
PROCEDURE:  The procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient and written informed consent was obtained during a preprocedure interventional radiology consultation.
A preprocedure timeout was performed discussing the planned procedure, confirming the patient's identity with three identifiers, and reviewing a checklist per [**Hospital1 18**] protocol.
A 12-lead EKG was performed, and based upon these findings, a stat cardiology consult was requested.
For information on general anesthesia course/medications administered, please see anesthesia notes.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT Study Date of [**2102-4-12**]: FINDINGS: Limited ultrasound of the abdomen was performed prior to beginning the procedure.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2102-4-13**] The left atrium is normal in size.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2102-4-13**] FINDINGS: There are bilateral basilar opacities, with some element of organization likely representing subacute pneumonia.
Cardiovascular Report Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2102-4-14**] PRELIMINARY REPORT*** COMMENTS: 1.
Limted resting hemodynamics revealed a normal systemic arterial blood presure of 128/68 mmHg, and a mildly elevated LVEDP of 22 mmHg.
Her EKG was concerning for ST depressions in the setting of hypotension, with a troponin elevation, so patient underwent cardiac catheterization with no angiographical flow limiting disease.
She was quickly weaned off and she maintained her blood pressure in the 90's-100's systolic afterwards.
# ST depressions: EKG showed ST depressions in lead V3-V6 that were new from prior, in setting of bradycardia and hypotension.
Her repeat EKG later showed resolution of ST depressions.
Given that the patient is being evaluated for transplantation, she underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed non significant coronary artery disease.
She also had a TTE which showed EF >55%, trace AR and MR. .
She will need to have her RFA rescheduled and will require an anesthesia evaluation prior to the procedure.
Transitional Issues: # blood cultures were pending at time of discharge.
# Pt's initial chest xray was concerning for pneumonia, however pt was clinically well and asymptomatic.
She should have a pre-op evaluation by anesthesia to determine the safety of the procedure.
However, your blood pressure and heart rate returned to [**Location 213**].
You had a heart catheterization to evaluate for any blockages in the heart, and this was normal.
You should also be scheduled for a pre-op evaluation by anesthesia.
