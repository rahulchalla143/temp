The patient required a blood transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells because her hematocrit trended from 31 to 26.
It was originally felt that this was due to liquefaction of old hematoma and a pressure dressing was applied.
Cultures at the time of the operation grew methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus and two different species of carinii bacterium.
As her cultures became finalized her Flagyl was discontinued as we believed it was not necessary.
A KUB showed that she was obstipated with stool filing her entire colon.
We were concerned that if she started to bear weight on that foot the wound may potentially breakdown the vein graft anastomosis to her dorsalis pedis artery lies directly underneath the wound and we would like to do everything we can to keep the wound integrity intact.
Lopressor 25 mg po tid hold for blood pressure less than 100, heart rate less than 60.
