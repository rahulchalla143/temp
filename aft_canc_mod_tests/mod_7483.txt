[**2104-9-24**]: VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION [**2104-9-24**]: Larynoscopy   History of Present Illness: 76F with esophageal perforation s/p EUS for evaluation of GEJ mass found on endoscopy.
CT revealed no evidence nor metastatic disease although a small 1.x2cm lesion was noted in the uncinate process.
She presented to the the GI endoscopy unit for further evaluation with EUS.
Left minimal pleural effusion and [**Hospital1 **]-basal lung atelectasis are no different as compared to the prior radiograph.

Chylous leak: pigtail fluid [**2104-9-20**] appeared chylous.
Her TF were changed to vivonex, nonfat with medium change triglycerides.
Thoracentesis on [**2104-9-28**] for 300 mL, pigtail remained which slowly taper off.
CXR with no effusion.
Lisinopril was started once her blood pressure increased 140-160's.
