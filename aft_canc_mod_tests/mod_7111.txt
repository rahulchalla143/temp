CXR [**8-13**] The ET tube tip is 3.3 cm above the carina.
CXR [**8-15**] There is increased lower lobe atelectasis and slightly worsened right middle lobe atelectasis.
CXR [**8-16**] Since yesterday, aeration in both bases improved.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2126-8-5**] the P wave is less peaked  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 107101**] is a 49yo presented for planned TAH/BSO for endometrial cancer.
In the preop holding area, the anesthesia team evaluated the pt and noted that her oxygen saturation at baseline was 90%.
Incentive spirometry was given to the patient, but despite this, her oxygen saturation remained low.
As her glucose fingersticks were extremely high, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained for optimization of diabetes medications.
Her levoquin was d/c'd following the surgery, but prednisone was continued until tapering was started on the day of discharge.
Her oxygen saturation ranged from 94-98% on RA-2L O2 by NC during the day and 90-95% on 2L Bi-Pap at night.
Her vital signs were always stable during these episodes, and while sitting up during the day, no abnormalities or mental status changes from baseline were noted.
*) EKG changes: An EKG obtained during an episode of sedation revealed T wave changes.
Three sets of cardiac enzymes were negative and the pt was without symptoms.
*) HTN: Her blood pressures continued to be elevated with vasotec, so HCTZ was added to the regimen.
