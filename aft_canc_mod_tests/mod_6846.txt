Immunohistochemical stains for CD68 and CD3 show dense infiltration of macrophages and scattered T cells in areas of demyelination.
Imaging: CTA Chest([**10-15**]): IMPRESSION: Small peripheral pulmonary embolus within the right lower lobe.
MRI Head ([**10-15**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Correlation with prior MR examinations is critical to evaluate the evolution of these findings in the setting of the patient's biopsy and possible ischemic event.
Normal MR perfusion study with no definite areas of hyperperfusion to definitely suggest malignancy.
CT Torsoe: 1.
MR BRAIN [**12-12**]: 1.
No significant change in extent of white matter FLAIR hyperintensity and right basal ganglia T1 hyperintensity from recent MRI from [**11-15**].
Per OSH pathology identified Grade II astrocytoma.
During his medical flight to MA, he experienced SOB and desaturations and upon landing was taken to an OSH ED where he was intubated and later transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after a subsegmental PE was identified.
His initial pathology was reviewed by another outside pathologist and the slides were sent here for review and the final descision, as above, is a demyelinating process and not oncologic.
With this new information he was transfered to the neurology service for further evaluation and treatment.
He had an LP which was unremarkable and negative for oligoclonal bands.
He had an extensive evaluation for causes.
He had another MRI without significant change and then underwent Cytoxan induction.
His discarge neuro exam is significant for abulia, but oriented x3.
Strength exam is difficult due to motor impersistance but on the right side he can move agaist resistance.
