The plan - after multiple meetings with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] - was to proceed with mediastinoscopy, and if the nodes were negative to proceed to a lobectomy.
He did receive preoperative chest x-rays that were within normal limits, except for a right apical haziness that represented the likely tumor and significant emphysema.
His cardiac enzymes were followed postoperatively along with serial EKGs, based on his recent catheterization.
These were all unremarkable, and his cardiac enzymes never showed a significant increase on 3 subsequent sets.
There was minimal small right pleural effusions noted at this time on serial chest x-rays, and these chest tubes were without air leak with the posterior tube removed on postoperative day #3 and the anterior tube removed on postoperative day #4 with no significant untoward event.
His saturations on the morning of discharge were 95% on 2 liters without any activity.
He was then ambulated up to 100 feet, and his oxygen saturation on room air at this point - post ambulation - was noted to be approximately 89-90%.
