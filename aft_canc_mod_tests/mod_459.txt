Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2192-7-19**] 1:39 PM There is no evidence of hemorrhage.
There is extensive edema present similar in comparison to the comparison study performed in [**2192-5-8**].
A noncontrast CT scan cannot say anything meaningful about the extent of the resection.
Radiology Report MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2192-7-20**] 9:21 AM 1.
Susceptibility artifact in the left vertex, likely represents pneumocephalus, better seen on CT exam one day prior.
The post operative Head Ct was consistent with expected post operative changes.
The patient's blood pressure goal was liberalized to a goal of less than 160.
The patient had a post operative MRI of the Brain which was consistent with post-surgical changes with  minimal enhancement within the resection bed.
Information was obtained from webOMR.
?You will not need an MRI of the brain with/ or without gadolinium contrast.
