She had a diagnostic paracentesis performed in the ED which showed no evidence of SBP.
She had a RUQ ultrasound performed which showed patency of the hepatic vessels, as well as moderate ascites relatively unchanged from her prior CT scan on [**2158-10-11**].
However, over the course of 2 days this did not result in appreciable increase in her sodium, which ranged from 116-119 from [**Date range (3) 40847**].
As such she was started on Tolvaptan 15mg on [**2158-10-25**], and her fluid restriction was liberalized.
She was continued on midodrine and hydrocortisone to support her blood pressures during dialysis given episodes of hypotension.
A tunneled HD line was placed for outpatient HD which she will have on a M/W/F basis.
# Severe AS: The patient had a history of AS with an estimated valve area of 1.0-1.2cm from her prior echo in 5/[**2158**].
A repeat echo was obtained which revealed an aortic valve area of 0.9 consistent with severe aortic stenosis.
