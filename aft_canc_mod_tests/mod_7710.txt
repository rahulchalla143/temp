Anemia: Likely from a slow ooze, considering she has not noticed a change in her bowel movements, and is relatively well compensated for a Hct of 18.
She was originally started on a pantoprazole infusion, which was switched to pantoprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
Her Hct originally came up to 22, then transfused two more units PRBCs with Hct to 28.
Upper endoscopy showed a large, ulcerated, bleeding mass in the antrum highly suspicious for gastric carcinoma.
A repeat endoscopy was performed after stabilization of her hematocrit, and pathology showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
The patient received a total of 8 units of PRBCs and her hematocrit was stable at discharge.
EKG shows possible mild strain, but not ACS.
Troponins were negative, and mild ST depressions resolved.
