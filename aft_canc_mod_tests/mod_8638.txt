History of Present Illness: The pt is a 64 year-old right-handed male with history of oligodendroma, found in 07 , s/p resection, stable at least since [**12-9**], first presented in SE (long ICU stay c/b PEs and VAPs), seizure disorder, HTN, hypothyroidism, DM2 and hyperlipidemia who presents with multiple brief episodes of "freezing up" and difficulty producing speech for ~3-5 days, with increasing frequency over the last 2 days.
His prior seizure types were focal motor and per patient primarily involved left arm and leg shaking.
There was no loss of consciousness during these episodes, which never lasted more than 30 seconds.
These occurred in the setting of a self-taper of Topamax, which he blamed for the episodes.
The EEG monitoring during admission showed correlation of these episodes with "electrographic seizures... of right frontal origin."
Oligodendroglioma, WHO grade II    - presented in [**6-/2197**] with status epilepticus    - diagnosed [**7-/2197**] by stereotactic biopsy    - resected 9/[**2197**].

[**3-17**] CT head w/o contrast 1.
[**3-24**] MRI brain IMPRESSION: Unchanged or slightly decreased enhancement in the right frontal lobe at the site of previous surgery.
Unchanged FLAIR abnormalities compared to the previous MRI examination of [**2199-12-30**].
[**3-26**] MRI brain IMPRESSION: Increased perfusion associated with the right frontal lobe resection bed.
EEG [**3-19**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to multiple electrographic seizures as described above in detail.
The interictal EEG is notable for sharp waves phase reversing independently in the biparasagittal regions.
This telemetry captured 15 pushbutton activations which contained electrographic seizures.
Compared to prior 24 hours, this study is unchanged.

followup evaluation, to assess for any residual tumor.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to EMU service for evaluation of seizures.
he was admitted on telemetry and continuously monitored on EEG recording.
routine labs, metabolic work up, UA, chest xray and EKG was done on admission to EMU.
His EEG recording showed multiple electrographic seizures , most of them localized to right frontal area (prelim read).
After giving these medicines, his EEG improved , however he required 200 mg of IV fosphenytoin on [**3-19**] am in order to achieve therapeutic level of medicine.
There was therefore concern that his intractable epilepsy was due to potential regrowth of his tumor (as had been considered in the fall).
MR imaging was therefore repeated with arterial spin labeling and he was noted to have tumor progression.
He underwent repeat MRI of brain including arterial spin sequence which showed regrowth of his tumor.
A craniotomy was done and per the operative report "image-guided resection of the superior frontal lobe according to BrainLAB criteria.
The posterior medial margin of the tumor was left behind since a functional MRI scan had shown [**Last Name (STitle) **] and speech activation in the infiltrated the area."
On discharge, exam was notable for left facial droop, limited upgaze, frontal and inattentive.
