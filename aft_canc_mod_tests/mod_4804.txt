She had a chest x-ray there and per report had a dense opacity in the right upper lobe with moderate airspace opacity in the right lower lobe with loss of lung volume; as well as mild mediastinal shift to the right and decreased aeration of the right lung.
She had a Hct of 32.1 with 88% neutrophils; and a K of 3.4.
On arrival in MICU 7, her vitals were HR 122 BP 96/69 (map 67) RR 24 88% RA.
She came up to high 90s for O2 sat with nasal cannula.

Pericardiocentesis was performed with removal of 350 ml of bloody fluid.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 20 mm Hg and mean PCWP of 22 mm Hg.
The pericardial pressure was 11 mm Hg as was the initial RA mean.
The systemic arterial blood pressure was normal at 119/65 mm Hg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.4 l/min/m2.
Successful pericardiocentesis 2.
PERICARDIAL TAMPONADE Repeat ECHO revealed RV collapse and signs of pericardial tamponade.
Repeat ECHO on 12.13 and then 12.15 revealed evidence of small clot in pericardium without significant reaccumulation of fluid.
Flexible bronchoscopy on [**2190-1-11**] revealed tumor erosion of bronchi with near complete compression of the right bronchus intermedius.
LUNG CANCER Patient with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
Repeat surveillance blood cultures remained negative.
Ultimately the patient's positive blood cultures were felt most likely consistent with contamination.
