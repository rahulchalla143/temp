He also felt he gained 10 pounds (normal weight 178 pounds), which he attrbiutes to prednisone usage.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2152-6-13**], the pulmonary hypertension is now mild.
EGD biopsies [**2152-12-27**] .
No evidence of CHF on exam despite 10lb weight gain (no significant rales or pedal edema) or CXR (does not appear fluid overloaded), echo several months ago with EF>55%, troponin neg x2, ECG similar to previous.
No evidence of acute infectious process on CXR and WBC WNL (however Neut 90%).
After spending the night in the ICU, patient was weaned down off ventimask and satting 93% on 4L NC.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient was found to have an INR of 5.3 in clinic several days prior to admission.
His warfarin was held for 2 days and patient presented with an INR of 1.5.
Warfarin 8mg (home dose) was restarted and INR was monitored with a goal of [**1-12**].
His CHADS-2 score is at least 4, so when it was determined that he would have an EGD/colonoscopy in house he was started on a heparin gtt.
He was also re-started on 8 mg of Coumadin and given a prescription for a INR which will be followed by his PCP.
Given that his BP control was still poor, HCTZ was added.
Strict BP control in this age group is likely not necessary.
Per recent PCP note, patient was noted to have small amount of blood in stool and GI endoscopy is being planned as an outpatient.
[**2152-12-15**] iron level above normal (268), ferritin low (24), TIBC 316.
Retic count 6.0% (elevated).
MCV 114 with normal B12 (439) and folate level (on supplementation).
Thyroid studies were normal.
EGD showed gastritis, hiatal hernia and a small angioectasia in the duodenum which was an unlikely source of the anemia.
Colonoscopy showed polyps (removed) diverticulosis and hemorrhoids.
Patient presented with Hgb 9.9 and was 10.7 on discharge.
# Low Vitamin D: Patient's vitamin D level is 17 (<30) on recent labs.
Transitional Issues: * lovenox bridge and INR follow up with PCP (1-2 weeks) * Further BP regimen titration * hematuria work up * Pulmonary follow up in [**12-11**] weeks  Medications on Admission: * Albuterol sulfate 90 mcg inhaler 2 puffs four times daily PRN shortness of breath * Atorvastatin [Lipitor] 10 mg Tablet daily * Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily * Cyclosporine [Restasis] 0.05 % Dropperette 1 drop in the left eye twice a day * Dorzolamide-timolol [Cosopt] 2 %-0.5 % Drops 1 drop to left eye twice a day * Esomeprazole magnesium [Nexium] 40 mg daily * Folic acid 1mg daily * Glipizide [Glucotrol XL] 5mg daily * Loteprednol etabonate [Lotemax] 0.5 % Drops, Suspension 1 drop to left eye twice a day * Metformin 500 mg twice daily * Prednisone 20mg daily * Tiotropium bromide [Spiriva with HandiHaler] 18 mcg Capsule one capsule daily * Venlafaxine [Effexor XR] 75mg twice daily * Verapamil 180mg twice daily * Warfarin 8mg daily * Ferrous sulfate 325mg twice daily  Discharge Medications: 1. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2)  Inhalation four times a day.

You were noted to have a rapid heart rate, and high blood pressure and your medications were adjusted.
You had a colonoscopy and upper endoscopy that showed gastritis and angioectasia in the small bowel.
