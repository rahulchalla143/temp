CXR revealed hyperinflated lungs with evidence of pulmonary edema and central venous congestion.
A TTE-bubble study was ordered.
In setting of [**Last Name (un) **], elevated troponin not unexpected, however his MB was elevated as well which is more concerning for cardiac ischemia.
A TTE-bubble study was ordered and cardiac enzymes were planned to be cycled.
Examination of his blood smear revealed few, if any, blasts were identified.
Given that his smear showed mature lymphocytes, it was felt unlikely that leukostasis would have occured until the WBC > 400K and therefore not the cause of his acute respiratory failure.
An autopsy was declined.
