MRI was suggestive of leptomeningeal spread, and LP was confirmatory.
Of note she has an indwelling Foley catheter BP at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was found to be 70/palpable, HR 120s, O2 Sat 88% on RA.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In the ED, VS initially T 97.3, BP 99/71, HR 138, RR 20, O2 Sat 100% on 6L.
She had a CT of her torso that demonstrated air adjacent to a sacral decubitus ulcer.

Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was found to have three pulmonary nodules on CT scan on [**2151-4-5**].
On [**2151-12-8**], right upper lobectomy revealed stage I, 1.1 cm poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma with negative bronchial and vascular margins, no pleural or vascular involvement, and no involved lymph nodes.
CT demonstrated increase in size of left lingular nodule.
CT in [**5-/2157**] was unremarkable.
Biopsy of this lesion on [**2157-7-12**] revealed metastatic poorly differentiated NSCLC.
PET scan [**2157-8-3**] was notable for an FDG avid left chest wall mass, SUV 16.4, consistent with recurrent disease.
She was started on cisplatin/docetaxel on [**2157-9-26**] and began XRT to the left chest wall in 2/[**2157**].
CT chest on[**2158-4-20**] showed an enlarged left axillary lymph node and increase in the soft tissue component of the left chest wall lesion in the area of her prior surgery.
Biopsy of the lymph node was consistent with NSCLC.
PET on [**2158-5-15**] showed interval development of an FDG avid, enlarged soft tissue mass in the left axilla, abutting the chest wall, with adjacent FDG avid adenopathy.
Her PET scan on [**2158-9-14**] showed disease progression.
CT [**2158-12-4**] showed increase in her left axillary lymph node.
MRI was suggestive of leptomeningeal spread of her lung cancer, confirmed by LP.

CXR [**4-2**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2158-10-11**], there is little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
CXR [**4-9**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-2**], there is little change and no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
CT Torso [**4-2**]:IMPRESSION: 1.
She was responsive to fluid boluses, with MAP >65 and did not require CVP monitoring or pressors.
She had one episode of hypotension with mild lightheadedness on the floor with SBP 80s which repsonded to 1L fluid bolus.
Cultures showed mixed bacterial flora.
There was initially concern for necrotizing fasciitis given air tracking along puborectalis on CT abdomen.
CT abdomen did not show any acute intra-abdominal process.
She was given a bowel regimen and pain was managed aggressively once blood pressure recovered.
# Anemia: discharge hematocrit was 41 one month ago, fell to 32 on admission and as low as 21 later that evening.
She received 1 unit pRBC with a more than adequate bump in her Hct, raising the possibility that the Hct 21 was not real.
Repeat hemolysis labs showed no evidence of hemolysis.
ECG unchanged from prior with q waves II, II, AVF.
Felt unlikely to be cardiac since reproducible on exam and ECG without acute changes.
Biomarkers showed stable troponin and normal CK and MB.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
Alum-Mag Hydroxide-Simeth 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for heartburn, gas pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Sepsis secondary to UTI vs pyeloneprhitis Sacral pressure ulcer  Secondary Diagnosis Metastatic Non Small cell Lung Cancer Chronic pain Depression   Discharge Condition: hemodynamically stable, SBP 90s-100s, O2 sats 90s room air, HR 90s   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure, likely from a urinary tract infection.
We treated you with an antibiotic called levofloxacin and stopped your lisinopril and your blood pressure improved.
