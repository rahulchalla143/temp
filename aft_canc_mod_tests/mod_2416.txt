He had a preoperative CT scan that showed no evidence of lymphadenopathy.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 150/92, pulse 80 and regular, respiratory rate 16 unlabored.
PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no evidence of wheeze, crackle, rhonchi.
It was ultimately determined that he would undergo an orthotopic diversion and a continent cutaneous diversion with ilial loop.
Preoperative hematocrit was 38.2.
No chest x-ray was done.
Preoperatively, electrocardiogram showed no ST-T wave changes, normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, no history of Q-wave.
Blood loss for the case was 850 cc.
Urine output for this case was 250 cc.
Postoperative hematocrit was 29.4.
BUN and creatinine were 15 and 0.9, otherwise his electrolytes were unremarkable.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION AND GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient had a protracted postoperative ileus.
CT scan was obtained.
It was presumed after analysis of the JP fluid with his creatinine values being somewhat elevated that there was an additional leak from the neobladder.
By postoperative day #13, the patient underwent a CT scan.
CT scan at that time did not show any evidence of leak.
It was a rather encouraging study radiographically, however once the patient arrived to the floor after receiving gastrografin his wounds at the site where it had previously been draining at the most inferior margin began to drain copious amounts of enteric contents.
His electrolytes were serially repleted.
JP, amylase, lipase, bilirubin and creatinine were ultimately serially checked.
The central venous line had been previously discontinued and he was utilizing a right basilic double lumen PICC for his TPN and intravenous fluid access.
