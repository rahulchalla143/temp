A CXR was done on admission showing and expanding pleural effusions.
had an aspiration event during which his O2 sats dropped briefly and he became tachycardic.
A post-water seal cxr was unchanged and on the morning of PPD 4 the ct was clamped.
A four hour post cxr showed no change and the chest tube was pulled.
Post pull CXR was again stable with no evidence of a new pneumothorax.
He was still requiring supplemental oxygen and arrangements were made for a VNA to visit and check the pt.s oxygen saturation as well as chest tube site.
