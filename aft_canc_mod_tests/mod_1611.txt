A CT torso showed colonic distention to the sigmoid colon with collapse, suspicious for obstruction due to possible drop metastasis.
An NGT was attempted but not tolerated.
Her exam was consistent with distention, tympany, and tenderness to palpation without peritoneal signs.
Myotonic dystrophy 3.

CT chest/abdomen/pelvis [**4-9**]: Interval progression of parenchymal lung nodules, with interval development of left-sided pleural effusion and probable worsening of large bowel distention.
KUB [**4-11**]: There is no free air.
Nausea, vomiting, and constipation: Based on CT scan and KUB findings, this is likely a partial small bowel obstruction vs. an ileus from likely drop metastasis from her ovarian cancer.
-Bowel rest, NPO, D5NS, and advance diet as tolerated -Anti-emetics with compazine and lorazepam -Aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, bisacodyl, and lactulose -NGT decompression prn -Therapeutic paracentesis prn -Repeat CT and general surgery consultation if she acutely worsens .
Ovarian cancer: Now with progression of disease on volociximab trial, documented on CT torso.
She was pre-op'd and taken to the OR on [**2142-4-14**] for an exploratory laparotomy and loop ileostomy (please refer to operative note for details).
Given the acute nature of her hypoxemia, PE was considered a possible etiology and a heparin drip was started.
Aspiration was also suspected and a bronchoscopy was performed that showed a moderate amount of brown fluid in the upper airway (trachea, mainstem bronchi).
A CXR was obtained, which demonstrated: increased haziness overlying the right lower lung likely representing effusion layering posteriorly, with opacity in the retrocardiac region consistent with volume loss/atelectasis.
Cultures were pending at the time of this report.
An autopsy was declined.
