Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
The patient spikes fever on POD # 6 and WBC spikes to 32.7.
Abdominal CT revealed  6.5 x 9.9 cm hypodense area within segments [**Date Range 1105**], [**Doctor First Name 690**] and IVb of the liver.
On POD # 8, repeat CT scan demonstrated increase in size of large area of hypo attenuation within segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] and IVb which has a thicker rim than previously.
Fluid was send for evaluation and grew enterococcus sensitive to Vancomycin.
On POD#15 repeat CT showed likely communication of liver collection through abd wall.
On POD # 6, repeat Doppler revealed patent hepatic arteries and saphenous vein interposition graft and high velocities at the graft-hepatic arterial anastomosis.
The patient underwent abdominal CTA/CTV on POD # 7, which demonstrated patent intrahepatic vessels including the portal vein, hepatic veins and hepatic artery, focal high-grade (>70%) narrowing of the left hepatic artery at bifurcation with proper hepatic artery, which was not present previously and distal right hepatic artery is attenuated for several centimeters beyond the bifurcation but patent.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
POD#14 5 staples removed from left side of wound and allowed to drain - both samples grew Vanc senstivie enterococcus.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required.
