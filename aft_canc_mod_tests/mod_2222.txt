Evaluation at [**Hospital3 3583**] revealed a large pericardial effusion and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for pericardiocentesis.
The patient's current heart rate was 100, blood pressure 150/70, respirations 12, saturating 92% on 2 liters nasal cannula, pulses were noted to be 20 mmHg.
The patient had 2+ DP pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The data upon admission to the outside hospital revealed a Chem-7 within normal limits, creatinine 0.7, hematocrit 32.5.
CK 22, troponin less than 0.02.
ALT 39, AST 40, albumin 3.6, INR 1.1, TSH 1.4.
EKG on admission revealed sinus tachycardia at 95 beats per minute, nonspecific T wave inversions in the lateral leads.
Echocardiogram from the outside hospital revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55% with 1+ MR, small to moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade.
A chest CT performed on [**2192-5-6**] from the outside hospital revealed a large pericardial effusion, right pleural effusion, small left-sided pleural effusion, right lower lobe atelectasis, and hepatomegaly with biliary stent.
A V/Q scan performed at the outside hospital on [**2192-5-5**] was read as low probability.
On [**2192-5-8**], cardiac catheterization upon admission at [**Hospital6 256**] revealed the following hemodynamics:  Right atrium pressures of 28/32 with a mean pressure of 25, right ventricular pressure of 50/28, PA pressure 50/28/36, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 30/34 with a mean pressure of 29, cardiac output 4.82, cardiac index 3.
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION/CONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS:  Given the concern of ongoing pericardial effusion and constrictive pericarditis, the CT Surgery Service was consulted for evaluation of pericardial window or pericardial stripping procedure.
For further evaluation and to better define the effusion, the patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed a continuous moderate effusion with right ventricular and right atrial clot.
The patient also underwent a cardiac MRI which revealed tethering of the pericardium, suggestive of constriction, with small semisolid effusions.
Her blood pressure remained stable without any evidence of compromise.
Of note, cytology of the pleural fluid was negative and was noted to be blood only.
