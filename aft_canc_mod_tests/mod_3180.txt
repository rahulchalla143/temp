CT abdomen done, after which pt c/o dizziness, diaphoresis, nausea, then became unreponsive with BP 110/60, HR 60s at that time.
CT abdomen revealed probable splenic laceration/rupture although the patient could not receive IV contrast due to renal failure, so this could not be quantified; pt taken to ED.
BP in the ED was reportedly 67/30 -> 137/54 with 1L NS and 1U PRBC; then transferred to SICU.
Physical Exam: Gen: NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, OP clear CV: RRR, nl S1S2, II/VI systolic murmur at LUSB Lungs: Crackles and dullness to percussion at R base.

[**3-20**] CT abdomen: 1.
In this patient with an elevated creatinine, an MRI with gadolinium could be helpful in confirmimg the source of bleeding.
[**3-24**] CT abdomen/pelvis: 1.
[**3-27**] CT abdomen/pelvis: Stable appearance of the spleen.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CT abdomen revealed a likely splenic rupture.
The patient was transfused a total of 7U of PRBC and 7 bags of platelets while in the SICU.
Platelet count was maintained >100 in the setting of bleeding.
Hct stabilized, and repeat CT showed a stable appearance of the spleen.
The lung bases were visible on his CT abdomen and their appearance was consistent with fluid in the lungs.
The patient was diuresed and his oxygen saturation improved to baseline.
An echocardiogram was done and revealed an EF of 60% and was otherwise unremarkable.
Cultures remained negative at the time of discharge.
CXR revealed no evidence of pneumonia.
# chronic renal insufficiency(baseline Cr 1.9-2.2):  On admission the patient's creatinine was elevated at 2.4, but by the time of discharge (after receiving IVF and blood products) it returned to baseline around 2.0. .
# HTN: While in the surgical ICU, the patient's blood pressure was controlled with IV metoprolol and hydralazine.
