She underwent a stat, non-contrast CT scan of the head on [**2143-11-4**] that ultimately revealed no evidence of parenchyma hemorrhage, no axial blood, no midline shift.
The initial evaluation by the neurology staff here felt that the patient may have suffered some type of subthalamic or sub midbrain lesion perhaps a medial longitudinal fascicular lesion that would explain the neurologic deficits which were she had the inability to perform saccadic movements, scanning movements were however intact.
First an EEG was performed to rule out any possible disease that might be contributing to this.
On[**2143-11-6**] she underwent an echocardiogram of the heart to rule out any possible thrombus or abnormality in the graft that might explain an embolic phenomena that could explain the neurologic deficit.
There was mildly decreased left ventricular function with an EF of 45 to 55%.
The initial [**Location (un) **] on the echocardiogram by staff cardiologist was that there was evidence of left to right shunt at the top of the intraventricular septum between the left ventricular outflow tract and the right ventricular consistent with a ventricular septal defect.
The remainder of the study is unremarkable.
On [**2143-11-6**] the patient underwent an MRI MRA.
The MRI of the brain revealed no acute territorial infarctions seen on diffusion weighted images.
The likelihood of an acute ischemic event in the setting of no restricted diffusion flow on diffusion weighted image is less likely, however still possible.
Additional findings of MRI of the brain were scattered foci with increased T2 signal intensity in the paraventricular white matter and centrum semiovale.
MRA of the head and neck was also performed which showed no hemodynamically significant stenoses in the internal  or external carotids.
MRA of the intracranial vessels showed patent vertebral arteries with a left dominant system.
The fact that the image does not show up on the MRI apparently is a harbinger of a good prognosis and excellent recovery.
Additionally she will have home monitoring, blood pressure checks and neuro visual evaluation with wound care checks with visiting nurse assistant.
Otherwise her neurologic exam is completely normal.
