As part of his workup, he underwent a colonoscopy which showed a resection of part of the rectosigmoid from prior surgery, some diverticulosis, and angiodysplastic lesion at the base of the cecum which was cauterized.
He also underwent an EGD, which showed two small benign appearing polyp-like lesions at the GE junction which were biopsied and showed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma at the squamoglandular junction.
He had previously undergone an MRI of the abdomen, which had shown a 3-cm left hepatic lobe lesion.
As part of his staging workup for the esophageal adenocarcinoma, he underwent an abdominal CT scan on [**2188-8-27**] which showed the same left lower lobe mass which had grown in size.
He also underwent a CT of the chest on [**2188-9-8**] which showed nonspecific ground-glass opacities in the left lower lobe.
He underwent a liver biopsy on [**2188-9-8**] which showed poorly differentiated carcinoma most consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.
He underwent a PET scan on [**2188-9-30**], which did not show any abnormal uptake in the region of the patient's known hepatocellular carcinoma.

Initially, he was followed in the PACU, where EKG changes were noted, and he was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit to manage his blood pressure and evaluate these changes.
His cardiac enzymes were not indicative of any myocardial ischemia.
However, that evening, he was noted to have a heart rate to 140 in atrial fibrillation.
His heart rate recovered, and his rhythm converted to normal sinus.
The assessment was that he would do well at home (will be at his daughter's home).
