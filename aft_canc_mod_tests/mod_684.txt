- Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Statin - patient monitored on telemetry - As pt had RV infarct (by EKG, no right heart cath performed), avoid nitroglycerin for chest pain as RV infarct patients are preload dependent.
- monitor on telemetry - On Metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] for rate control, titrate up to home dose as BP tolerates - Will stop Amiodarone as NSVT was peri MI and did not recur .
- Nitrates were held as blood pressure stable.
- Pt should have BP check by PCP or NP within 1-2 weeks of D/C .
