History of Present Illness: 87 year old male with h/o CAD s/p CABG, Afib, SSS s/p PPM, CHF with EF 35%, moderate-severe AS, HTN, HL, and prostate cancer who presented on [**5-3**] to [**Hospital3 **] with worsening SOB found to have an [**Hospital 39700**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath, and now transferred to CCU in setting of worsening respiratory distress and [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing.
His weight increased 10 pounds over one week prior to admission with substantial peripheral edema.
On admission to [**Location (un) **], Troponin I was 0.19 with CPK of 65.
Creatinine was elevated to 1.6.
Creatinine improved to 1.2 throughout his stay.
Vitals on transfer: 96.4, 108/68, 60 paced, 99% 2LNC.
He was transferred for cardiac catheterization Tuesday.
Troponins were stable and EKG did not reveal any new changes.
(OSH records obtained during [**4-/2102**] hospitalization) Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation, not felt to be a candidate for Coumadin Moderate to Severe AS: peak gradient 28, mean gradient 15, AV area 0.6cm2 Sick sinus syndrome s/p PPM with generator change in [**2098**] Chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, in [**3-18**] TTE showed EF 35%, worse than one year ago and new focal areas of distal septal and inferoposterior hypokinesis (althoguh TTE reports states global hypokinesis)  Other Past History: COPD, not on home O2 Osteoarthritis Hyperlipidemia Prostate cancer, treated with finasteride, previously on lupron, never had surgery.
Rheumatoid arthritis, on methotrexate and prednisone with continued significant pain Hypothyroidism Lymphoma, states he has had it 3 times, the most recent being 3 years ago when he received radiation (low grade follicular lymphoma per OSH records, last radiation [**2099**]) Anemia H/o GI bleed - per OSH records, "Lower GI bleed of unknown source"  TTE [**2102-3-14**] at [**Hospital3 **]: (Full report in scanned records) 1.
Probable severe aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 50, mean gradient of 30, which given his degree of left ventricular dysfunction likely represents critical aortic stenosis.
The calculated aortic valve area by continuity equation is 0.7cm2.

[**2102-5-8**] CXR Cardiac silhouette is enlarged.
[**2102-5-8**] Foot xray  No prior studies for comparison.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= XX %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Brief Hospital Course: 87 year old male with h/o CAD s/p CABG, Afib, SSS s/p PPM, CHF with EF 35%, moderate to severe AS, HTN, HL, and prostate cancer who presented on [**5-3**] to [**Hospital3 **] with SOB, [**Hospital 39700**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath who had worsening respiratory distress prior to catheterization.
