CXR [**8-4**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process (though reticular nodular pattern appreciated).
KUB [**2152-8-4**]: No free air under diaphragm, normal bowel.
ECG [**8-4**]: Sinus tach (142); axis, intervals NL, no acute ST-T changes.
CT Neck [**8-7**]: 1.
CXR [**8-9**]: Low lung volumes following tracheal extubation probably exaggerate persistent mild pulmonary edema, and the radiodensity of the moderate right pleural effusion, but azygous distention indicates persistent volume overload even though heart size is normal.
