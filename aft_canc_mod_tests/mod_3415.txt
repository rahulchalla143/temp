Transbronchial and endobronchial biopsy   History of Present Illness: This is a 73 year-old man with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer treated with surgical resection and radiation in [**2120**], bladder diverticuli with resection, benign parotid tumor resected in [**2115**] who presents with two weeks of altered cognition.
There the patient was noted to have 17mm right frontal mass and right perihilar mass on CT head and chest.
Please see detailed neuro exam done by neurosurgery in OMR earlier this morning   Pertinent Results: Admission labs: [**2122-4-30**] 11:10PM   GLUCOSE-261* UREA N-25* CREAT-1.1 SODIUM-137 POTASSIUM-4.2 CHLORIDE-100 TOTAL CO2-29 ANION GAP-12 .
[**2122-4-30**] 11:10PM   NEUTS-90.5* BANDS-0 LYMPHS-8.3* MONOS-0.6* EOS-0.4 BASOS-0.2 [**2122-5-1**] 07:33AM   DIGOXIN-0.9 [**2122-5-1**] 07:33AM   PHENYTOIN-10.1 [**2122-5-1**] 07:33AM   PT-14.0* PTT-24.6 INR(PT)-1.2* .
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2122-5-1**] 11:02 AM 1.
Right hilar opacity demonstrating calcification and adjacent bronchiectasis and satellite nodules, most suggestive of an infectious process, of which tuberculosis is of concern.
BONE SCAN [**2122-5-1**] No evidence of osseous metastases.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2122-5-1**] 12:14 AM Large, partially cystic and solid right frontal lobe mass.
Pathology Examination TRANSBRONCHIAL AND ENDOBRONCHIAL BXS (2).
[**2122-5-4**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2122-5-6**] 8:07 PM Post right frontal mass resection and frontal craniotomy, with postoperative changes and small amount of hemorrhage, persistent vasogenic edema and shift of normally midline structures.
MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST  [**2122-5-6**] 5:53 AM This study was performed for operative planning and has limited diagnostic utility.
Limited study for preoperative planning.
[**5-6**] brain biopsy: #1, RIGHT FRONTAL TUMOR BIOPSY (including intraoperative smear): METASTATIC MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA, consistent with metastasis from lung primary.
[**5-14**] ct head: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN: Post-surgical changes are again noted as such.
#Brain mass - 17 mm right frontal mass with surrounding vasogenic edema and midline shift.
The brain biopsy pathology revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma, presumptively from the lung (+adenoCa on bronchial washings as well), and he has follow-up with neuro-oncology and will at that time decide on a definitive treatment plan.
He had a bronchoscopy and initial bronchial washings showed 0 PMNS and 0 microorganisms.
Initial biopsies were negative for any malignancies.
AFB smear x1 negative, and his PPD negative.
# Pneumonia: During the patient's course he developed RLL crackles on exam, cough and a CXR with interval increase in RLL opacity.
Once the patient was at goal he had a head CT, and bleed was ruled out.
Prior to discharge, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] said the patient could be safely discharged on lovenox as a bridge to therapeutic coumadin with a goal inr 2-2.5.
His beta-blocker was uptitrated and he was rate controlled prior to discharge.
His beta-blocker was uptitrated for heart rate and blood pressure control and he was well controlled with the beta-blocker and HCTZ.
# Left adrenal adenomatous mass on abd CT: On abdominal CT the patient was noted to have a 2x2 cm mass, benign in appearance.
