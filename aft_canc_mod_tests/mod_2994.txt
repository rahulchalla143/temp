IMPRESSION: Appropriate ET tube placement  CT TRACHEA W/O C W/3D REND  [**2143-7-15**] 9:12 AM Reason: Evaluate for tracheobronchomalacia IMPRESSION: 1.
At this point, the patient was afebrile and without leukocytosis and had a CXR without clear focal opacities.
Given high suspicion for upper airway process, bronchoscopy and direct vocal cord visualization was performed, which demonstrated infraglottic edema/ulceration.
With extensive walking including stairs, the patient's oxygen saturation did not drop below 96% and thus did not meet requirements for home oxygen.
A dynamic airway CT to evaluate for tracheobronchomalacia did not show dynamic changes of the tracheobronchial tree on dynamic expiration versus inspiratory series.
Continuing bi-pap was recommended by interventional pulmonology due to closure seen during bronchoscopy; however, the patient would not tolerate bi-pap while sleeping and it was discontinued.
An outpatient evaluation for OSA was recommended after discharge, as outpatient positive pressure ventilation would not be covered by insurance without this study.
# MRSA positive sputum cultures The patient developed a leukocytosis to 13.7 on the day after admission and sputum cultures obtained during bronchoscopy grew out MRSA.
HCT fell from 37 on admission to 28; Plts fell from 172 to 111.
