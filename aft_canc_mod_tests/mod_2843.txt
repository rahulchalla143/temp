Core biopsy of the rectus abdominal muscle on [**2147-2-13**] showed involvement by his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma marginal zone.
MIB-1 staining showed a proliferation fraction to be approximately 40%.
-  CT scan of the chest from [**2147-9-29**] showed new diffuse peribronchovascular ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lobes, most suggestive of an infectious etiology.
-  CT of the chest abdomen and pelvis on [**2147-12-15**] showed no evidence for lymphomatous disease.
-  In [**3-/2148**], noted for an enlarging lymph node in the left lower cervical and supraclavicular area; PET imaging on [**2148-3-29**], showed new bilateral cervical lymph nodes, left supraclavicular lymph node peritoneal nodules and numerous musculoskeletal foci with FDG uptake consistent with recurrence.
Other notable past medical history: - Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (marginal zone)as above - Right hip replacement - CAD s/p AVR (bovine graft) and 3V CABG - History of hemolytic anemia - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease - Open appendectomy - Lap cholecystectomy - Hyperlipidemia - Stage I left renal carcinoma, status post left radical nephrectomy, adrenalectomy, and regional lymphadenectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2139-12-7**].
