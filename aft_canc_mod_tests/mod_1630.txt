A CT scan was done as an outpatient which showed no evidence for an acute disease process.
The magnetic resonance angiography showed multiple enhancing fossae of the thalamus, cerebellum, and surface of the frontal lobes with enhancement of the meninges; consistent with carcinoma dysmeningitis.
Magnetic resonance imaging also noted enlarged third ventricle; consistent with communicating hydrocephalus.
Non-small-cell lung cancer; stage III-B, diagnosed in [**2169-5-18**] now with bony liver metastases.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on presentation to the Emergency Department revealed temperature was 97, blood pressure was 108/52, pulse was 78, respiratory rate was 18.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed his pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves II through XII were intact.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory values on admission revealed white blood cell count 6.6, hemoglobin was 11.7, hematocrit was 33.2, platelet count was 395, and mean cell volume was 86.
Differential revealed neutrophils of 63%, lymphocytes of 28%.
Sodium was 137, potassium was 4.7,  chloride was 105, bicarbonate was 21, blood urea nitrogen was 13, creatinine was 0.7, and blood glucose was 110.
ALT was 37, AST was 27, alkaline phosphatase was 147, amylase was 36, total bilirubin was 0.3, lipase was 25, albumin was 3.8.
Calcium was 9.4, phosphorous was 3.3, magnesium was 2.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram done on [**2171-11-4**] showed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 67, normal axis and intervals; with no change compared to electrocardiogram of [**2170-11-19**].
IMPRESSION: The patient is a 59-year-old male with non-small-cell lung cancer with metastases to liver and bone now with magnetic resonance imaging consistent with carcinomatous meningitis with metastases to left cerebellum, left thalamus, and frontal lobes.
A lumbar puncture was performed which showed an elevated open pressure of 31, and only 2 cc could be removed.
On hospital day four, the patient was noted to have bradycardia with a heart rate in the 30s to 40s, as well as some hypertension, which raised concern for [**Location (un) **] triad and increasing intracranial pressure.
A head CT was repeated at that time which showed no change in ventricular dilatation.
A cerebrospinal fluid flow study examining the shunt was to be performed on [**2171-11-12**] as an outpatient.
His mental status began to clear approximately three days postoperatively, and it was felt that the etiology of his altered mental status was multifactorial; including Decadron, postsurgical anesthesia, brain metastases, and possible alcohol withdrawal.
He was continued on a CIWA scale; however, he did not require any Ativan per protocol.
Cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negative as well as blood cultures.
One of two of his urine culture grew Streptococcus bovis; which, given its association with colon cancer, an outpatient colonoscopy may be necessary.
