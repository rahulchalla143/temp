Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-3-9**], LVH is not seen on the current study.
The pt had an EGD performed by the liver service which demonstrated significant portal gastropathy but no focal site of bleeding.
The pt was transfused 4 units pRBCs at [**Hospital1 18**] in the ICU (had been given two units at OSH) and he was also given two units of FFP pre-procedure.
Over the rest of his admission he was given 2 more units of pRBCs and his hct was between 26 and 31, 27.1 at discharge.
Iron studies were borderline low, pt was started on iron 325mg per day.
Colonoscopy was performed and only showed grade 1 hemorrhoids and diverticulosis.
##CAD: He had no history of CAD or prior MI, stated had "false positive" stress test here in [**2158**] followed by negative cath.
Had TTE from [**2-14**] with mild AS, trivial MR. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 9413**] was noted on physical exam concerning for AS, thus a repeat TTE was obtained which was unchanged from prior study except for increase in mild MR and no LVH.
You underwent an upper endoscopy which showed stomach congestion called "portal gastropathy."
Your colonoscopy showed diverticulosis and hemorrhoids.
