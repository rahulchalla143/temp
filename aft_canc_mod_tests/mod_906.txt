Needle biopsy of the liver lesion confirmed metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Vital signs revealed temperature 97.8 heart rate 68, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 136/83, oxygen saturation 96 percent in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat is normocephalic and atraumatic.
Lymph nodes - No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary or bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy.
The chest is clear to percussion and auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 5.0, hemoglobin 15.0, hematocrit 45.4, platelet count 323,000.
Blood urea nitrogen 26, creatinine 1.2.
Sodium 136, potassium 4.3, chloride 101, CO2 30, ALT 15, AST 18, LDH 138, CK 24, alkaline phosphatase 156, total bilirubin 0.2, albumin 3.7, calcium 9.3, phosphorus 3.6, magnesium 1.9, uric acid 6.6.
INR 1.0.
Her admission weight was 56 kilograms and she received Interleukin2 600,000 international units per kilogram equaling 33.6 million units intravenously q8hours times fourteen planned doses.
On treatment day number five, she developed mild dyspnea on exertion with oxygen saturation in the high 90s in room air and examination consistent with small pleural effusions with dullness at bilateral bases without crackles.
She developed crackles on her pulmonary examination and was subjectively short of breath and 20 mg of intravenous Lasix was given.
She developed mild chest pain and underwent electrocardiogram revealing probable supraventricular tachycardia.
Given need for maximum doses of Dopamine and Neo-Synephrine with systolic blood pressure remaining in the 80 range, she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management and monitoring.
During her initial hypotension on seven [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**], she was also noted to be hypoxic with an oxygen saturation in the mid 80s, markedly improved with oxygen by face mask.
She initially remained in supraventricular tachycardia but ruled out for myocardial infarction by CK and troponin.
By the evening of [**2147-1-7**], her blood pressure had stabilized and she had been weaned completely off Neo-Synephrine.
Her systolic blood pressure was maintaining over 90 on Dopamine.
Her oxygen saturation was in the 90s in room air.
She underwent echocardiogram on [**2147-1-9**], revealing left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and systolic function to be normal with a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55 percent.
Laboratory abnormalities during this week included creatinine rise to 2.6, improved to 2.1 on the day of discharge; hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of 3.8, improved to 1.7 on the day of discharge; metabolic acidosis with a bicarbonate low at 16, improved to 25 on the day of discharge; and an elevated alkaline phosphatase with peak alkaline phosphatase [**Location (un) 1131**] of 383 on the day of discharge.
She was mildly anemic with a hemoglobin of 12.1 and hematocrit of 35.1 without need for packed red blood cell transfusion.
She was thrombocytopenic with a platelet count low of 27,000 on the day prior to discharge which had improved to 36,000 on the day of discharge.
She had significant weight gain of approximately thirty pounds during her hospitalization.
Her blood cultures drawn during her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay were negative.
Her central line tip was sent for culture upon discharge.
