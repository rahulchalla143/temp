The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-10-22**], a small-to-moderate pericardial effusion is now present.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2183-12-12**] the rate is slightly slower and limb lead voltage is lower.
[**3-19**] CXR portable-IMPRESSION: Improving pulmonary opacifications, most likely representing decreasing pulmonary edema.
CT CHEST [**2184-3-26**] : Within limits of the study without contrast, the heart and great vessels are within normal limits.
Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes have decreased in size compared to prior examination.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-4-16**] 11:11 AM FINDINGS: Diffuse lung parenchymal abnormalities have progressed, including areas of consolidation, ground-glass attenuation, and poorly defined nodules.
Examination is not specifically tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region, but a small incompletely imaged cyst in the right lobe of the liver is incidentally noted as well as diffuse increased attenuation of the liver.
This could potentially represent a sebaceous cyst, but correlation with physical exam findings is suggested for initial further assessment if the diagnosis is not already known clinically.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-4-26**] 10:14 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-5-4**] 10:39 PM FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or acute vascular territorial infarction.
Please note that MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive for the detection of acute brain ischemia.
MR/A HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-5-5**] 4:17 PM FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, infarct, or edema.
MRA OF THE CAROTIDS AND VERTEBRAL ARTERIES: Carotid and vertebral arteries are visualized from the origins to the intracranial courses.
Increased signal on post contrast images of brain in the internal auditory canals can be real or artifactual related to 3T scanner effect amd is not associated with increased FLAIR signal or seen on postcontrast MRA neck images.
PERSANTINE MIBI  [**2184-5-7**] INTERPRETATION: Left ventricular cavity size is mildly dilated.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 49%.
LVEF 49%.
STRESS Study Date of [**2184-5-7**]  EXERCISE RESULTS  RESTING DATA EKG:  SINUS, PROM.

The patient underwent a bronchoscopy, and BAL was sent.
CT chest revealed increased diffuse bilateral peribronchovascular infiltrates as compared to previous.
TTE on [**4-12**] revealed a normal EF with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior segments of the LV, which had been seen on a prior TTE on [**4-2**].
EKG was unchanged.
CXR appeared more volume overloaded.
Infection was felt to be less likely.
CT chest revealed likely BOOP, and pt was started on methylprednisolone IV with planned slow taper.
At that point he will have a follow up Chest CT and PFTs and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4507**] will advise on plan for further taper.
# Coronary artery disease: The patient had an episode of nausea/diaphoresis in ICU and was evaluated with EKG that showed non-specific changes.
CT chest showed calcifications of the LAD.
P-MIBI on [**5-7**] showed no ECG changes, and normal myocardial perfusion on scintigraphy, mildly dilated left ventricular cavity size with mild depression of systolic function (LVEF 49%).
His Hickman line site showed no evidence of infection.
Lower extremity ultra-sound showed no evidence of DVT, and CT of chest showed a question of a multifocal pneumonia.
Additionally, patient had CT of the sinuses, which had a question of sinusitis.
ENT was not markedly empressed by CT, and an aspirate was sent and has been negative to date.
Renal was consulted, who felt that ARF was seondary to cyclosporine toxicity, as patient was admitted with supratherapeutic levels of near 400.
Urine electrolytes were consistent with a pre-renal etiology and creatinine improved after diuresis was held.
Pt developed new fevers & Head CT on [**3-26**] reported L sphenoid sinusitis, d/w ENT, very subtle & nothing to drain, performed nasal washing & sent aspirate for fungal culture to r/o fungal infections.

You will need to have a repeat Chest CT without contrast before the appointment as scheduled.
You had a stress test which was negative for ischemic changes or perfusion defects.
You had an echocardiogram which showed mildly depressed ejection fraction (50%) which indicates you have mild chronic systolic heart dysfunction.
While in the hospital it was also noted that your blood sugars were high.
You should have your fasting blood sugars checked as an outpatient once you have finished your steroid course.
