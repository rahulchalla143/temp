INDICATION: Recent prostate biopsy here with fevers, shortness of breath, tachycardia, please assess for PE.
COMPARISON: Chest x-ray of [**2178-4-18**].
TECHNIQUE: Multiple MDCT images were obtained before and after the administration of intravenous Optiray.
FINDINGS: There is no CT evidence for pulmonary emboli.
ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)  [**2178-4-20**] 3:56 PM  ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)  Reason: please further evaluate hypodensities in liver  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 72 year old man with SOB, recent prostate biopsy and now here with NSTEMI with liver densities on CT chest REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please further evaluate hypodensities in liver HISTORY: 72-year-old male with recent prostate biopsy, now with hypodensities in the liver on CT chest.
COMPARISON: CTA chest of [**2178-4-18**].
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: Multiple cysts are seen within the liver, the largest one measuring 1.9 x 1.7 x 1.6 cm.
These correspond to the hypodensities that were seen on the CT chest performed 2 days prior.
The right kidney measures 12.0 cm and the left kidney measures 11.47 cm; there is no hydronephrosis, stones, or masses.
Hypodense lesions on the CT chest correspond to hepatic cysts.
Echo ([**4-20**]) The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
He was subsequently transferred to the floor with reasonable control of blood pressure and heart rate.
His urine culture and sensitivities returned, and his antibiotic regimen was converted to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim twice daily for a total of 4 weeks given the reduced tissue penetration to the prostate of sulfa antibiotics.
Urinary tract infection following prostate biopsy 6.
