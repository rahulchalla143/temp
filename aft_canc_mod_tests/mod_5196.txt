The patient had complained of persistent lower abdominal pain, and CT of the abdomen was done at [**Hospital3 4107**] which revealed mild ascites and a 5 cm left adnexal cyst.
She also underwent an MRI of the pelvis, which suggested that the 5-cm cystic mass may be arising from the uterine fundus, possibly representing a cystic degenerating exophytic leiomyoma.
She had a few lab abnormalities that were concerning for malignancy: namely a CA 125 up to 106, anemia with a hematocrit of 30, and thrombocytosis with a platelet count in the 800,000 range.
She had a recent colonoscopy which was normal.
2 years ago, she had a diagnostic hysteroscopy for post-menopausal bleeding which revealed only atrophy.
The last Pap smear was in [**1-/2169**] and is reportedly normal.
CT Chest and abdomen, [**5-18**]: 1.
Inflammatory stranding, and intraperitoneal air in the mid abdomen, with no discrete abscess.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
RV systolic function is borderline preserved.

Brief Hospital Course: On [**2169-5-11**], the patient underwent exploratory laparoscopy converted to laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, dissection of intraperitoneal cyst, and left salpingo-oophorectomy.
The patient's post-operative course was complicated by development of an entero-cutaneous fistula, post-operative CHF, post-operative acute renal failure, and bacteremia.
Her course is summarized below by issue:  # CHF, systolic - as noted above the patient was intubated and in acut eresp failure from CHF.
ECHO done revealed poor EF and wall motion abnormalities, concerning for CAD.
She had a persistant leucocytosis that was slow to recover.
Another CT abdomen did not reveal occult abscesses.
Cultures at the time of discharge were negative.
The ovarian cyst was [**Last Name (un) 17066**] on pathology and cytology of ascitis fluid was positive for atypical cells.
Nutrition team followed him and performed a caloric count which was at goal for the patient.
Weight at discharge was about 43 kg.
she is advised to follow up PCP for weekly weight checks to ensure she is not loosing wt in which case she may need a nutritionist evaluation or alternative source of supplement feeding.
The hematocrit was stable at discharge.
