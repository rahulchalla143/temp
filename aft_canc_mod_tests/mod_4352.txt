CT scan revealed increasing chronic R SDH with increased MLS.
[**2106-9-14**] CT head postop: Decreased right subdural collection, now consisting of fluid and air, with improvement in associated mass effect.
[**2106-9-15**] Chest Xray:FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing bilateral pleural effusions have increased.
Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2106-9-15**]  1:58:56 PM Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2104-8-25**] the heart rate is slower and the T wave inversion in  leads V2-V3 is more prominent.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2106-9-16**] 11:37 AM  FINDINGS:  The right-sided subdural drainage catheter has been removed.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2106-9-17**] 4:25 AM  Mild pulmonary edema has improved, now persisting mainly at the lung bases.
[**9-17**] CT Head- 1.
[**9-18**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**9-19**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring study because of continuous focal attenuation and prolonged runs of quasi-rhythmic 1 Hz delta activity with intermixed sharp waves in the right posterior quadrant.
[**9-20**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring study because of continuous focal attenuation and prolonged runs of quasi-rhythmic 1 Hz delta activity with intermixed sharp waves in the right posterior quadrant.
[**9-20**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: The right epidural collection is minimally decreased.
POstop head CT showed good evacuation of SD collection without new hemorrhage.
POD 1 [**9-15**] her HCT was noted to be 23 and she was hypotensive to the low 90s.
She was transfused 1 unit PRBCs and post transfusion HCT bumped to 27.
A repeat head CT was performed and was stable.
The cardiac echocardiogram, but suggestive of Right Heart failure.
A chest X ray was consistent with mild pulmonary edema which has improved, persisting mainly at the lung bases.moderate left pleural effusion stable.
A CT was performed which was questionable for slightly enlarging SDH vs positioning.
On [**9-18**] her exam continued to decline with less left sided movement.
Another CT was performed which revealed increased MLS.
Her SQH was decreased to 5000units [**Hospital1 **] due to an increased ptt on AM labs.
[**9-18**], A head CT demonstrated worsening changes and the patient exhibited less movement on the left.
CXR demonstrated pleural effusions.
[**9-20**], A repeat head CT was stable and a family meeting resulted in the decision to progress toward palliative care.
On [**9-22**] her NGT was removed and she was started on a PO diet.
On [**9-23**], patient's exam was unchanged.
Information was obtained from  Rehab [**3-18**].
