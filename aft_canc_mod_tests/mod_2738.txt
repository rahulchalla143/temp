+le edema and abdominal distention which have been present from >1 week.
In ED, found to have T 97.9, HR 86, BP 94/60, Lactate =6.5; Started on MUST protocol.
BP increased to 130/76.
CT as OSH has shown extensive liver, lung, mesenteric mets and pleural effusion.

If further characterization is desired, a CT scan is recommended  [**4-2**] Echo  Conclusions: 1.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
[**4-3**] Abdominal MRI  REPORT: The patient has diffuse metastatic disease, with pulmonary, soft tissue, hepatic, renal and bone marrow metastases being seen.
He was aggressively IVF repleted to maintain CVP >8, and mixed venous O2 was maintained >70%.
Given his localizing symptoms of cough and positive CXR for atypical pneumonia he was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin empirically.
In addition blood, urine, sputum and stool cultures were sent for infectious work-up.
PNA: imaging seemed consistent with atypical pna with ceftriaxone (which would also cover urinary source as well) and azithromycin.
He was started on vancomycin and then switched to oxacillin when his cultures grew MSSA.
Urine cultures and blood cultures showed no growth at the time of this dc summary.
White count continued to increase into the 30's- likley from bm involvement of tumor (was seen on mri).
2.SOB: Patient continued to complain of some sob and dyspnea, though to be likely from pna and mets, patient was continued on oxygen with close monitoring .
Dacarbazine response rate is 10-20% of pt's with this severity of dz and subsequent interleukin-2 (which pt is already too ill for) only has 10% response rate as well.
Abdominal distention/LE edema/ liver failure- Patient continued to complain of abdominal distenstion and he had a transaminitis, with elevated ldh, alk phos, and t bili.
An ultrasound was obtained to eval portal/ivc flow and see if there was enough fluid to be tapped.
The ultrasound showed no fluid.
We felt that his elevated lactate may be secondary to his liver mets It was also felt that part of his transaminitis was from dacrabazine.
An MRI was obtained that showed markedly compressed, but patent IVC; markedly compressed, but patent intrahepatic portal vein, particularly the posterior branch of the right portal vein; and probable partial thrombosis of left hepatic vein.
5. coagulapthy: His inr was 2.4, likely due to poor synthetic function and nutritional deficiency.
Diarrhea: stool was sent for c. diff, cultures, O and P- all no growth to date.
Acute renal failure - cr began trending up with decreased urine output, urine lytes and FENA support that he was intravascularly dry and likely third spacing fluid.
In addition, MRI showed renal mets which were likley contributing to her failure.
FEN -hyponatremia: likely hypervolemic hyponatremia, urine lytes did not support SIADH .
