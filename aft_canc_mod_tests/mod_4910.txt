There is prominence of hilar and mediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature, which may be reflective of increased pulmonary vascular pressure.
CXR (PA & LAT) [**2144-1-26**]: IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:  The lateral view shows a wedge-shaped area of opacity in one of the lower lungs, could be a composite shadow of anterior spinal osteophytes and large lower lung vessels.
Head CT at OSH was largely unchanged per neurology team.
Lumbar puncture was not performed as he was afebrile with no leukocytosis and because he had thrombocytopenia (plts 60s).
Renal cell carcinoma: Pt with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to brain.
?Aspiration: CXR on admission showed retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis vs. aspiration but could not rule out PNA.
Repeat cxr showed an opacity that was read as possible composite shadow of osteophytes and lung vessels; two other regions of fullness were interpreted as adenopathy or fat.
He underwent a speech and swallow assessment and was deemed safe for thin liquids and regular consistency solids.
Normocytic Anemia: Pt with normocytic anemia, Hct 30-35 during hospital admission.
Hct remained stable and pt had no evidence of bleeding.
Cr was 1.3-1.5 during admission.
Thrombocytopenia:  Pt presented with thrombocytopenia, plt count in 60s.
Peripheral smear was examined per ICU and did not show schistocytes to suggest TTP.
He was started on folic acid and plt count rose to 108 by time of discharge.
