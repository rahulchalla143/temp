He has subsequently been found to have a right frontal white matter brain lesion and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, most concerning for malignancy.
We are being consulted for consideration of a brain biopsy of the right frontal lesion.
Registration [**4-6**] and recall [**4-6**].
- Cranial Nerves - [II] PERRL 3->2 brisk.

The imaging findings could be consistent with lymphoma.
MRI Head c/s contrast [**8-19**]  Right frontal signal abnormality with a central portion of restricted diffusion is not typical for an infarction and is predominantly involving the white matter.
NC CT Head [**8-30**] Status post open biopsy from a right frontal approach with a small amount of subarachnoid blood; right frontal sulcal effacement and vasogenic edema similar to [**2113-8-18**], head CT.  MRI Head c/s contrast [**8-30**] 1.
Please see the prior MR head study for additional details.
He will followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2442**] on [**2113-10-11**] and in the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic on [**2113-9-11**] for further management.
