SBP 140s.
HR in upper 40s and lower 50s, Was given glucagon w/ GI upset but w/o improvement in HR.
EKG here w/ ?
Temazepam 30 - 45 mg qhs 11.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VS -  T 97.6  BP 162/52  P 54  R 20  sat 98% on 3 L Gen: thin, elderly male lying in bed in NAD.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 8 cm.
MEDICAL DECISION MAKING EKG [**6-25**] - HR 50, irregular, TELEMETRY demonstrated: bradycardia 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**10-27**] demonstrated:  EF 40-45%, mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral/inferior akinesis.
LABORATORY DATA: Na 14  K 4.9  Cl 109  Bicarb 24  BUN 69  Cr 3.6  Glu 155 WBC 8.7  Hct 30.0  Plt 201  (83.8% N, 11.6% L) Pt 12.9  Ptt 25.8  INR 1.1  Troponin  0.02  [**1-27**] CT abdomen: - Cystic renal cell carcinoma left kidney, likely high-grade papillary type.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 84 yo male with pmh of CAD s/p CABG, htn, and renal and pulmonary masses who presents with ARF and a juntional bradycardia.
CAD  - patient is s/p CABG, currently without chest pain.
Pump  - patient has some signs of volume overload - crackles halfway up his chest and interstial fluid on CXR.
- Continue to monitor on telemetry - Hold his B-blocker and diltiazem .
-  Renal US to rule out obstruction -  F/U urinary electrolytes and [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes -  F/U UA amd UCx -  Consider CT abd/ pelvis to evaluate renal mass .
#  Kidney/ lung masses - last CT abd was in [**1-27**] -  Consider CT abd/ pelvis to evaluate renal mass .
#  Wheezing - patient has crackles and interstial fluid on CXR - albuterol nebs prn - Will monitor respiratory status .
#  Hx of diarrhea and bowel obstruction - continue home PPI, ranitidine and miralax.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p MI and CABG hx recurrent partial small bowel obstructions htn diverticulitis s/p ccy s/p sigmoid colectomy Dengue fever and malaria in WWII small bowel obstruction in [**2196-1-21**] colonoscopy [**10-16**] with one polyp removed EGD [**2196-10-15**] with gastritis  Social History: Wife died within the 2 months prior to admission.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: VS - 100.4 95 123/60 16 100% on AC 0.7 500 16 5 Gen: Thin, elderly male.
RENAL U.S. Study Date of [**2197-6-25**] 12:52 PM 1.
In view of which, this mass could have been obscured by the rib shadows in that region and MR evaluation is recommended.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2197-7-6**]  6:19:00 AM Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats including a slow triplet.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2197-7-4**] 3:06 AM Moderate right pleural effusion layers posteriorly, obscuring detail in the right lung but interstitial edema is still present.
He improved to NC 4L on the floor and was stable with improving pulmonary exam until on [**2197-7-2**], he developed hypercarbic respiratory failure likely due to mucous plugging and/or aspiration with blood pH 7.08 and CO2 74.
However, he improved without CPAP and has been transitioned back to 4L NC with last ABG on [**7-3**] showing pH 7.26.
His sputum GS and culture were contaminated however.
# NSTEMI:  Patient had many PVCs on telemetry but no evidence of a second infarction.
A renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis/post-renal obstruction from mass, but did identify a lesion suspcious for RCC.
Sodium was corrected slowly.
# Kidney and lung masses: Had CT abd in [**1-27**] (showed Cystic renal cell carcinoma left kidney, left lower lobe nodules largest measures 1 cm).
# Anemia: Patient's baseline hematocrit is low 30s, and he likely has anemia of chronic disease.
# Acute decompensated systolic heart failure: with EF 25-30%.
Previous EF 40%.
An ACE-I may be restarted in the future as the patient's renal fxn improves.
However, at time of d/c, he requested a script for his Temazepam, which was restarted.
