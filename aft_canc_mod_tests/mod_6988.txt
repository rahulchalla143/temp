She had a KUB performed at the rehabilitation facility.
She was found to be tachycardic to 120/130s with systolic blood pressure of approximately 100 per report.
Consequently, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] where she was found to be in supraventricular tachycardia and a heart rate in the 160s.
The heart rate was broken with some beta-blocker and fluid repletion.
In addition, in the Emergency Room, the patient was noted to be significantly hypertensive to low 200s systolic blood pressure.
A CT of the abdomen and chest performed on [**2158-12-26**] showed extensive wall thickening and probable pneumatosis coli of the distal jejunum, highly suspicious for ischemic bowel.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.1.
Heart rate 89.
Blood pressure 175/102.
Respiratory rate 15.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam: Pupils reactive to light, anicteric, mucous membranes moist.
Chest exam:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 24.9, hematocrit 45.2, platelet count 332,000.
Sodium 139, potassium 3.1, BUN 30, creatinine 1.0, glucose 169.
Troponin less than 0.3.
Creatinine kinase 41.
Urinalysis showed no signs of urinary tract infection.
Electrocardiogram showed supraventricular tachycardia, no ST changes.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a CAT scan of the abdomen and chest which showed a large periaortic enhancing mass with central calcification.
In light of the CT findings, as well as supraventricular tachycardia and physical examination, the decision was made to proceed to the Operating Room for a surgical intervention.
Blood loss was less than 100 cc.
The small bowel and the retroperitoneal biopsy were sent to the Pathology Department.
Her heart rate was controlled with a diltiazem drip.
Her blood gas showed some improvement postoperatively.
Her hematocrit remained stable and her white blood cell count remained elevated.
An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2158-12-28**] which showed an ejection fraction of 60%.
The blood loss was less than 100 cc.
Her urine output picked up slightly.
She was given fresh frozen plasma for an INR of 2.0.
Blood cultures obtained on [**2159-1-5**] grew coagulase positive Staph aureus.
Her white blood cell count remained elevated.
An echocardiogram was repeated on [**2159-1-3**] which again showed an ejection fraction of at least 60%.
Her creatinine was noted to be rising as well.
Peripheral pulses were absent.
Corneal reflexes were absent.
