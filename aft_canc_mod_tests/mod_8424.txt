Patient underwent a second endoscopy which showed a large adherant clot at the site of the resection and 4mg of epinephrine was injected into the site with out obtaining hemostatis.
HCT prior to procedure was 44.8 to 38.1.
During the placement of the line patient had several vagal episodes with passage of bright red stool and dropped his systolic pressures to the 60s.
The massive transfussion protocol was initiated and the patient given 2 units of pRBCs prior to his systolic pressures recovering to the 110's systolic.

Site of endoscopic mucosal resection in the duodenum is identified.
- ERCP: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal Duodenum: A flat polyp 5 cm in size was identified in the second portion of the duodenum.
Patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored by a trained radiological nurse.
Patient was placed supine on the angiography table and both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.
Selective angiography after coil/gelfoam embolization demonstrates no further flow into the GDA artery.
An angiography was obtained.
Successful coil and Gelfoam embolization of the GDA artery, with a  andwich technique, until successful stasis was achieved.
The hard copy ultrasound images were saved; however, due to technical problems, not transferred to PACS.
A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava.
Fluoroscopy spot image demonstrated the catheter tip in the distal SVC.

Small nodule posterior to the pancreatic body is seen, measuring 1.7 cm, previously seen on the recent MRI of [**2181-6-25**], whic was characterized as tuber omentale.

Patient underwent a second endoscopy which showed a large adherent clot at the site of the resection and 4mg of epinephrine was injected into the site with out obtaining hemostatis.
HCT prior to procedure was 44.8 to 38.1.
During the placement of the line patient had several vagal episodes with passage of bright red stool and dropped his systolic pressures to the 60s.
The massive transfusion protocol was initiated and the patient given 2 units of pRBCs prior to his systolic pressures recovering to the 110's systolic.
His hematocrit was monitored closely over the next two days and continued to slowly trend down.
Out of concern for hematoma formation at the groin sites or a retroperitoneal bleed, CT scan was performed which showed no hematoma or RP bleed; there was no pseduoaneurysm of the femoral arteries.
He should have a repeat CBC in 1 week for monitoring of H/H.
The patient should have a CBC checked in 1 week after admission for monitoring of H/H.
Biopsy of duodenal adenoma pathology pending.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check a CBC on [**2181-8-3**] with results faxed to Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Name (STitle) 5395**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103723**]  (discharge HCT 33, Hgb 11) ICD-9, 285.1   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Doudenal adenoma ERCP biopsy hemorrhage Mistaken insertion of 9French trauma line to the right femoral artery   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the intensive care unit after having massive bleeding from the biopsy in your small intestine earlier in the day.
During your bleeding a large IV was need to be placed in your leg in order to transfuse you blood as quickly as possible and keep your blood pressure up.
You will need to have a blood count checked in a week's time to ensure that there is no further bleeding.
Your hematocrit was 33 and your hemoglobin was 11 at the time of discharge.
