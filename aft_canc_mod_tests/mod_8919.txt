She underwent an exploratory laporotomy, lysis of adheasions, repair of enterotomy, resection of small bowel, and right oopherectomy.
By HD3 (POD1) the pt's creatinine had increased to 3.1 from 2.1.
The swan was removed and a CT surgery consult was obtained when a chest x-ray was read as having a possibly widened mediastienem.
CT showed no abnormality and CT surgery signed off.
Mrs.[**Known lastname 109877**] urine output was at this time minimally responsive to lasix, and her creatinine ultimately peaked at a value of 4.1.
Her creatinine slowly dropped to a new baseline of 2.2.
On several occations, pt's PO2 dropped from the mid 90s to the high 80s, and her O2 requirement grew.
A swallow study during the day demonstrated no impairment, but aspiration precautions were initiated, especially at night.
Pt ultimately was dced to rehab after her coumadin was theraputic (INR=2.9), her SaO2 was stable, her diarrhea is tapering, her CHF is much improved (now minimal crackles in b/l bases, her UTI is being adequately treated, her anemia is resolving (hct 33.9), her WBC count is normalizing (last 12.2), her heart rate is controled (80s and 90s), and her creatinine is much improved (now 2.2).
Last INR 2.9 on [**9-1**].
Target INR 1.8 to 2.0 as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1365**] (Heme-Onc) .
Outpatient [**Name (NI) **] Work Pt will need to have her INR checked to maintain a target INR of 1.8-2.0 16.
