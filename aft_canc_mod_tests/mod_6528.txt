Three days prior to presentation the patient first noted a decrease in his energy, and over the previous two days he was so weak he could not even stand for a few minutes.
-Matched unrelated donor non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant with Fludarabine/Busulphan/ATG conditioning - day 0 was [**2126-4-11**] complicated by grade 2 acute cutaneous GVHD for which he was started on steroids and hadn his cyclosporine dose increased  OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY ============================= - Epistaxis - TIAs (3 episodes in past 5 years) - Coronary Artery Disease (asymptomatic, diagnosied by positive stress test 8 yrs ago; stress test with imaging in [**2123**] showed a small area of mild distal inferior apical ischemia.
He had a radionucleotide stress test recently, however, that stratified him to low risk.)

Skin, left medial canthus (C,D):     Basal cell carcinoma, superficial and nodular types with superficial excoriation and squamous differentiation; extends to the peripheral and to the deep specimen margins.
Skin Biopsy [**2126-5-13**]: DIAGNOSIS: Skin, left abdomen, punch biopsy (A):     Vacuolar interface dermatitis with satellite cell necrosis and scattered eosinophils (see note).
GI Biopsies [**2126-5-15**]: DIAGNOSIS: Colonic mucosal biopsies: A.
While CMV immunostains are negative for viral inclusions, a concomitant infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.
Radiology ========== Chest Radiograph [**2126-5-8**]: IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest.
Cardiac silhouette exaggerated by a mild pectus deformity is top normal size.
Limited views of the right subclavian vein were obtained due to patient's bandage.
Chest radiograph from [**2126-5-8**] showed the tip to lie over the region of the brachiocephalic confluence or proximal SVC.
A contrast-enhanced study is recommended to further evaluate for clot.
RIGHT Venogram 1.
CT Torso W/Contrast [**2126-5-11**]: 1.
MRI Head W and W/O Contrast [**2126-5-11**]: FINDINGS: There are scattered areas of white matter hyperintensity on the FLAIR images in both the deep and subcortical white matter.
Chest Radiograph [**2126-5-13**]: IMPRESSION: No change or evidence of acute pneumonia.
Chest Radiograph [**2126-5-17**]: INDICATION: Line change.
CT Head W/O Contrast [**2126-5-17**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2126-6-3**]: Conclusions The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-3-26**], the pericardial effusion is slightly larger (still small).
CXR [**2126-6-14**]:  The Hickman catheter tip is at the level of mid SVC.
Evaluation with PA and lateral radiographs is recommended for precise characterization of this worrisome for infectious process abnormalities.
Cardiomegaly is unchanged, moderate compared to the prior study  RUQ US [**2126-6-19**]:  1.
CTA [**2126-6-17**]:  1.
While these findings are consistent with given history of pneumonia, drug toxicity or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia could have a similar appearance   CXR [**2126-6-18**]:  FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-14**], there is increasing opacification at the left base in the retrocardiac area, as well as some increasing opacification at the right base.
Markedly limited Doppler examination, probable gross venous patency although if renal vein thrombus were of significant clinical concern then CT or MR would better evaluate.
Echo [**2126-6-24**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-6-3**], the pericardial effusion is slightly larger, especially posterior to the heart.
The findings are nonspecific given hypoproteinemia and biliary distention but acute cholecystitis cannot be excluded; HIDA scan could be performed for further evaluation of biliary tract function.
[**6-29**] Echo Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**6-30**] CXR FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the prior studies from [**2126-6-29**].
GI biopsies were performed on [**2126-5-15**] with flexible sigmoidoscopy, which were consistent with GVHD and negative for CMV while skin biopsies of his rash from [**5-13**] were non-dignostic.
The patient was allowed rice once again on [**2126-6-2**] as his stool output had dropped below 500 cc per day and bilirubin was back to less than 4.
However, his stool output continued then increased the first week of [**Month (only) **].
RUQ US was done which showed sludge in the common bile duct.
Culture data remained unrevealing and UA and chest radiograph were benign and and respiratory viral screen was unremarkable.
When CT torso revealed colitis the patient was empirically started on ciprofloxacin/metronidazole on [**2126-5-12**] though C diff assay was negative.
All cultures remained negative and vancomycin stopped on [**5-21**], pipercillin-tazobactam stopped [**5-22**].
These were briefly restarted after another fever on [**5-23**] but weaned off by [**5-26**] as once again cultures remained negative and no source of fevers were found.
A CT of the chest was performed on [**2126-6-17**] which showed bilateral infiltrates.
Also had sputum and mini-BAL from [**6-20**] and [**6-21**] showing GNRs identified as STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPHILIA sensitive to SMX TMP.
Chest radiograph from the time of the procedure showed interstitial edema and it seems likely the patient had flash pulmonary edema in the context of volume overload and being placed flat.
Renal ultrasound was preformed which demonstrated no obstruction.
Imaging of the head (CT and MRI) were benign and these deficits resolved over his first 3-4 days in the hospital so no further work up was pursued.
ECG remained stable, CXR remained benign, and he was never hypoxic except as described above.
Echocardiogram was also completely stable.
His BB was weaned down over concern his dyspnea could have been due to difficulty augmenting his cardiac output in the context of standing with beta blockade but this wasn't particularly helpful.
Given D5W and sodium improved.
