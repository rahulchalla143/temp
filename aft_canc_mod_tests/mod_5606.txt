Random cortisol was reassuring at 40.
Her blood pressure should be measured on discharge and lisinopril can be restarted if needed.
THe patient had been on percocet as an outpatient, which was discontinued on admission.
Infection was considered as a contributing factor, however, culture remained negative as above.
CT head was negative for acute process.
# Acute renal failure: The patient originally presented with a creatinine of 2.3.
EEG showed no discharge activity consistent with non-convulsive status epilepticus.
Plain films of the lumbar spine revealed spondylosis and degenerative joint disease, but no evidence of compression fractures.
S/p 6 cycles of high dose methotrexate, changed to Rituxan and Temodar in [**9-17**] - Stroke ([**1-15**], posterior circulation) - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Subarachnoid hemmorhage (while on coumadin for stroke) - Diastolic dysfunction, last ejection fraction =55% - Hypothyroidism - Obstructive sleep apnea - Gastroesophogeal reflux disease - Status post cholecystectomy for gallstones - Atrial fibrillation, not on coumadin - Chronic bronchitis   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] after you were found to be confused and disoriented at your outpatient opthalmology appointment.
You were first admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring, where you were rehydrated with intravenous fluids, and given antibiotics in case of an blood infection.
