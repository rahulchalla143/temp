Had dilantin load and CT at OSH.
CT showed 3x4 right frontal hemorrahge and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: Labs on admission: [**2151-2-6**] 02:49PM BLOOD WBC-17.6* RBC-4.48 Hgb-13.5 Hct-39.1 MCV-87 MCH-30.2 MCHC-34.6 RDW-13.7 Plt Ct-387 [**2151-2-6**] 02:49PM BLOOD Neuts-84.9* Lymphs-11.4* Monos-2.6 Eos-0.4 Baso-0.6 [**2151-2-6**] 02:49PM BLOOD PT-11.7 PTT-24.6 INR(PT)-1.0 [**2151-2-6**] 02:49PM BLOOD Glucose-108* UreaN-13 Creat-0.7 Na-139 K-4.7 Cl-105 HCO3-24 AnGap-15 [**2151-2-6**] 02:49PM BLOOD Calcium-9.2 Phos-3.2 Mg-2.5 [**2151-2-7**] 02:39AM BLOOD Phenyto-10.0  IMAGING: Head CT [**2-6**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a large 3.5 x 4.8 cm intra-axial right frontal lobar hemorrhage, with surrounding edema and associated mass effect.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
MRI is recommended for further evaluation to exclude underlying mass lesion.
MRI Head [**2-7**]: FINDINGS: Again identified is a large right frontal hematoma.
There are no prominent feeding vessels or draining veins, thus a CT angiogram is unlikely to be helpful.
CT Torso: POST-CONTRAST CT OF THE CHEST: Imaged thyroid gland appears unremarkable.
ABDOMINAL CT WITH CONTRAST: The liver contains a 0.9-cm area of hypoenhancement (3:52).
Abdominal aorta and iliac vessels demonstrate atherosclerotic calcifications with no aneurysmal dilatation.
PELVIC CT WITH CONTRAST: Small amount of air within the urinary bladder is likely secondary to instrumentation.
MRI Head [**2-11**]: Post-surgical changes are noted in the right frontal lobe and in the adjacent bone and external soft tissues, with blood products, and moderate vasogenic edema.
The ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are unremarkable except for effacement/mass effect on the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] by the edema in the right frontal lobe.
RIGHT FRONTAL MASS PATHOLOGY: REPORT PENDING RIGHT FOOT BIOSPY PATHOLOGY: REPORT PENDING   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after OSH imaging revealed a signifcantly sized right frontal hemorrhagic mass.
CT was concerning for underlying lesion; so MRI was performed to confirm this.
CT torso was also done, which was significant for pulmonary and adnrenal lesions.
Pulmonary biopsy was pursued, however this was refused by the patient's legal proxy due to "previous familial bad experiences".
Preliminary pathology was consistant with metastatic melanoma.
She was seen again by Dermatology, who did a biopsy of a suspicious looking lesion on the bottom of her right foot, that was once previously diagnosed as a dysplastic nevi.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
?You will need an MRI of the brain as this was done during your acute hospitalization.
**Your CT scan of your torso was also revealing for adrenal and pulmonary masses, in addition to emphysema.
