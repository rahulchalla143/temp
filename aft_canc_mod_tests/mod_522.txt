Imaging:  [**2153-6-6**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: New consolidations in the posterior segment left upper lobe (4, 53), in the right upper lobe (4: 52, 91), are most likely infectious in etiology.
Mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
[**2153-6-6**] BONE SCAN INTERPRETATION: Whole body images of the skeleton obtained in anterior and posterior projections show no abnormal areas of tracer uptake.
On the anterior projection, there is reduced uptake in the spine and kidneys, unchanged, secondary to large volume ascites as seen on the MRI of the abdomen done today.
[**10/2152**] EGD - One column of nonbleeding grade I varices were seen in the lower esophagus.
MRI abd w/ and w/o contrast: 1.
Renal US [**2153-6-9**] 1.

The poor kidney function was caused by worsening liver function.
Since you have had a bladder mass removed in the past, you had a cystoscopy performed to look in the bladder.
