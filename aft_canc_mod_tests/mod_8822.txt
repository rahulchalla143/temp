[**2145-12-12**] MR Pituitary: MR EXAMINATION OF THE BRAIN AND PITUITARY GLAND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [**2145-12-12**].
TECHNIQUE: Routine [**Hospital1 18**] non-enhanced MR examination of the brain and sella turcica was performed.
Given the patient's severe renal insufficiency (BUN 124, creatinine 3.0 with eGFR 13 mL/min), no intravenous gadolinium contrast material was administered.
FINDINGS: The study is compared with the recent NECT of the head dated [**2145-12-11**].
The limited whole brain imaging is notable for moderate global atrophy.
Markedly abnormal appearance to the sphenoid air cell, which, as on the CT, is virtually-completely opacified with heterogeneous-signal contents, most suggestive of differing degrees of inspissation.
Additionally, fungal colonization cannot be excluded, with this appearance.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
# Found down: Differential includes acute illness (h/o cold symptopms and ?infiltrate on cxr), vs stroke, vs encephalopathy [**2-24**] renal failure vs cardiogenic syncope.
ECHO was equally unremarkable.. Cardiac enzymes were negative.
# Acute kidney injury: improved with hydration, creatinine 1.1 upon discharge.
HCTZ, lisinopril, and metformin held during stay, with metformin started on discharge.
Creatinine should be checked after discharge at which time, if blood pressure can support and creatinine remains stable, lisinopril 20mg and then HCTZ 25mg can be reinitiated daily.
# Diabetes: on insulin sliding scale  # Elevated inr: INR 1.4 on admission, possibly [**2-24**] poor nutrition.
# Please follow INR as well and encourage good nutrition.
