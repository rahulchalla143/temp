INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300 CELLS nuc ish(MYCx2)(5'MYC [**9-10**]'MYCx1)[93/100] FISH evaluation for a MYC rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the LSI MYC Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 8q24 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
Following admission, a bone marrow biopsy was done on [**2166-7-27**] and which ultimately showed cells consistent with non-hodgkin's lymphoma.
Cells from the ascitic fluid also were sent for evaluation and were found to be positive for malignant cells and consistent with Lymphoma.
A diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma was made based on the available clinical evidence and the findings on diagnostic testing conducted.

In the setting of rapid expansion of abdominal distention and worsening elevations in intra-abdominal pressures bedside U/S and X-ray of the abdomen was performed and continued to show minimal ascites and no evidence of free air.
The patient's bladder pressure was approx 40.
The patient was unable to maintain his cardiac output and he was give nitrogen mustard and a second dose of cyclophosphamide emergently in hopes of reducing his tumor burden.
