A exercise MIBI was obtained, with a hypotensive blood pressure response to exercise low level exercise.
He underwent cardiac catheterization, which revelaed 3VD, and subsequent CABG in [**Month (only) 116**] [**2105**] without complication.
Perioperative ECHO showed normal global and regional biventricular systolic function, mild to moderate aortic regurgitation, and mild functional mitral stenosis from MAC.
Stool was sent for c.diff during the hospitalization, which returned positive.
It was initially believed that his coagulopathy was secondary to malnutriion, however, his INR remained levated despite vitamin K supplementation.
In order to reverse his INR in order to pursue a thoracentesis, the patinet was given a total of 12 untis of FFP, but without effect.
Hematology was consulted, who felt that he had aquired a prothrombin inhibitor, potentially due to exposure to bovine thrombin.
-sensory: No deficits to light touch throughout.

CXR Final Report REASON FOR EXAM: Evaluate pleural effusion.
Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
Cardiac size cannot be evaluated.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) 3901**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3902**] Approved: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**2106-1-28**] 12:44 PM .
CXR Final Report HISTORY: CABG with increasing oxygen requirement.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-20**], there is little overall change.

CT Head Final Report HISTORY: 77-year-old man with elevated INR and increased somnolence.
FINDINGS: A non-contrast CT of the head was obtained.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 39944**] DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 11136**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11137**] Approved: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**2106-1-21**] 6:01 PM .
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regiona/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-5-5**], mild aortic stenosis is now present and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure has increased.
CXR Final Report AP CHEST, 10:30 P.M. ON [**1-17**]  HISTORY: Respiratory distress.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-25**]:  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion have increased substantially.
Opacification at the lung bases is probably atelectasis.
# Coaguloapathy - INR of 5.6 at the OSH despite vit K and FFP.
Results from OSH showed a Factor V inhibitor, a repeat study here was still pending at time of death here despite extensive studies sent by hematology.
Pt had a positive DILUTE [**Location (un) 39945**] VIPER VENOM TEST which suggests lupus anticoagulant and may interfere with the factor V inhibitor study.
#  Diastolic CHF - Has had persisent LE edema and orthopnea since CABG surgery in [**Month (only) 116**], with escalating doses of lasix.
On exam appears total body fluid overloaded but intravascularly dry, and has hypoalbuminemia.
MEDICATIONS AT TRANSFER: ASA 81 mg daily Lipitor 80mg daily Citalopram 10mg daily Digoxic 0.125mg q48h Dilt 120mg daily Lasix 40mg daily Toprol 50mg daily  Discharge Medications: expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure coagulopathy from factor V inhibitor causing life threatening epistaxis acute on chronic renal failure .
