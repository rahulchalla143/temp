Patient was found to be lightheaded with a blood pressure of 90/palp.
After 1.5 liters of normal saline, her heart rate was 104 and blood pressure was 95/50.
Once patient was transferred from the ICU to the Medical Floor on [**2192-12-15**], she had received four units of packed red blood cells and four units of FSP for her GI bleeding.
Patient was also given vitamin K to reverse her INR of 55 while her Coumadin was held.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals on admission showed a temperature of 98.1 F, pulse 104, blood pressure 90/60 to 105/55, respiratory 18, 100% on four liters and 92% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Anicteric eyes.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 23.6, hematocrit 27.9, platelets 410.
Sodium 139, potassium 5, chloride 101, bicarbonate 21, 39 for BUN, 1.2 creatinine, 144 for glucose.
INR is 54.
Chest x-ray shows some postsurgical changes with questionable right pleural effusion.
EKG is with a heart rate of 104 at sinus tachycardia, normal axis.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  For her GI bleed, she received four units of packed red blood cells and her hematocrit increased to 32.4.
Patient also had signs of cholecystosis on physical examination where patient started to become jaundice and on lab exams with ALT in the 70s, ASTs in the 100s, alkaline phosphatase in the 600s, and total bilirubin in the 10s.
Work up for the cholecystosis included a CT Scan of the abdomen which revealed a distended gallbladder, marked intra and extrahepatic duct dilatation, common bile duct and pancreatic duct dilatation, normal pancreas.
This lead to a ERCP which revealed a bleeding pancreatic mass in the duodenum with pancreatic duct and common bile duct dilatation.
Later on a second ERCP was done to place a metallic stent instead.
A CTA of the pancreas was then done revealing a 3 by 3.5 pancreatic mass with liver lesions and intrahepatic duct dilatation.
Biopsy from the first ERCP revealed an adenocarcinoma.
Further staining revealed that this was indeed a primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
After stenting was placed, ALT then went back down to 52, AST went back down to 69, alkaline phosphatase went back down to 498 and total bilirubin went back down to 4.2.
A CEA level was checked and found to be at 9.8.
A CA99 levels were checked and are still pending upon discharge.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  For the patient's aortic valve replacement, she was anticoagulated with heparin with PTT goal of 50 to 70.
Her INR then became 2.7 upon discharge.
Lorazepam 0.5 to 1 mg p.o.
