He had neuro-ophthalmology workup, which did not show anything abnormal.

An MRI was also done and further characterized this lesion.
A CTA was done for surgical planning.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: On Admssion: neurologically intact  On Discharge: neurologically intact  Pertinent Results: MRI BRAIN [**2187-10-9**]: Right frontal lobe mass, which appears to be extra-axial and on the CT scan contains fat and calcium.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2187-10-9**] (4PM): Status post right frontal extra-axial mass resection with slightly decreased mass effect.
Blood products and gas in the surgical bed.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2187-10-9**] (8PM): No significant change compared to [**2187-10-9**], at 4:25 p.m.
Chest X-ray [**2187-10-9**] ET tube tip is 2.7 cm above the carina, the tip lies against the right tracheal wall.
EEG [**2187-10-10**] This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the presence of 4 Hz background rhythm which represents a moderate to severe encephalopathy such as can be seen in diffuse ischemia, toxic/metabolic, infectious, or other etiologies.
Chest X-ray [**10-14**] Mild interstitial edema has progressed accompanied by some increase in pulmonary vascular congestion.
Post-op CT head showed post-surgical changes reflective of removal of his dermoid tumor.
The patient had a repeat CT head 4 hours later on [**10-9**] given his seizure activity, which noted no significant changes.
The plastic surgery team felt the pressures were not consistent with compartment syndrome and recommended arm elevations and warm compresses which seemed to improve the swelling.
On [**10-11**] the patient had an EEG which demonstrated no seizure activity.
The patient was started on a Nicardipine gtt for blood pressure control.
The patient's central venous catheter was discontinued and his scalp staples were removed on [**10-17**].
