Her oxygen saturations were 96% on room air.
Ms. [**Known lastname 6993**] was evaluated by the nutrition team as her oral intake was minimal and her transferrin and albumin were low along with an elevated INR.
Her type and screen was updated and she was cross matched for 4 units.
Her INR had been elevated 1.8-2 likely secondary to poor nutritional status.
Her hematocrit was stable 31.2->29.6->29.9.
A CT scan was obtained, significant for multiloculated simple pleural fluid and axillary superficial simple fluid collection.
