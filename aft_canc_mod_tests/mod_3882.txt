Shoulder x-ray - FINDINGS: In comparison with earlier study of this date, the humeral fracture is again seen with marked overlap of the head with the proximal shaft.
TEE - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CTA chest - IMPRESSION: 1.
Evaluation of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries, especially in the lung bases is limited by respiratory motion.
For infectious wrk-up patient had CTA which demonstrated effusions but no obvious infiltrate.
Patient underwent TEE which demonstrated no atrial thrombus, patient then underwent subsequent cardioversion.
Beta blocker being titrated up as tolerated by heart rate and blood pressure.
# PUMP:  On admission exam pt is volume overloaded with elevated JVP, crackles, some mild LE edema.
Based on imaging pt has significant cardiomegaly.
Echo on admission demonstrates mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function.
EF 55%.
ECG without acute ischemic changes.
patient with creatinine of 1.3 on admission with previous value of 1.0 in [**2099**] which improved to 1.0 on discharge.
Initially held ACE inhibitor in the setting of elevated creatinine which was restarted and Cr remained stable.
Repeat films as above and ortho saw patient and felt that fracture healing well, reccomended weight bearing as tolerated and outpatient orthopedic follow up in 3 weeks.
#Lung nodule - incidentally noted lung nodule (small in right lung) on CTA.
Patient needs outpatient follow up with repeat CT chest in [**6-17**] months as per primary care provider.
Defer work-up to primary care physician as outpatient issue.
TSH on admission 0.95 which is WNL.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 100 % Powder Sig: One (1)  PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
The cardioversion resulted in sinus rhythm which unfortunately was not sustained and your rhythm returned to atrial fibrillation.
You  had a shoulder x-ray taken which demonstrated a right proximal humerus fracture which appears to be progressing well clinically.
