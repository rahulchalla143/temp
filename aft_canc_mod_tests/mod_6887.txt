However, this study was not done with contrast, and L-spine MR with contrast at [**Hospital1 18**] is indicated.
Compression of R ventral/lateral thecal sac (traversing L4 ventral nerve root) with complete obliteration of R subarticular recess and neural foramen (exiting L3 nerve root).Diffuse disc bulges, lig flavum thickening, and facet hypertrophy throughout L-spine with mod-severe canal stenoses.
