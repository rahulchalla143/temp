Given persistence of disease based on bone marrow biopsy on [**2128-4-8**], he completed 5+2 regimen.
Repeat biopsy still showed residual biopsy.
Thus, he completed another round of chemotherapy (MEC D1C1 [**2128-5-15**]) after which repeat biopsy revealed that the bone marrow had been ablated.
The bone marrow remained acellular on repeat BMBx on [**2128-6-29**] with no leukemic cells.
Persistently neutropenic on filgrastim until WBC counts began to recover [**2128-8-12**] to > 0.1 and continued to uptrend to 2.5 by [**8-27**].
#) COLITIS:  IV flagyl was initiated on [**4-4**] and CT abdomen showed colitis on [**2128-4-6**].
Stool Cdiff negative and noro negative.
Repeat CT on [**2128-4-13**] shows improvement in colitis, and stools decreased to 1 per day and no BM over the last 4 days.
Repeat CT scan on [**6-7**] showed resolution of previously seen colitis.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent with no growth.
CXR showed some suggestion of LLL infiltrate.
Based on CT scan, pt underwent bronch with BAL on [**6-10**] (no growth).
Ambisome was DC'd on [**7-2**] when repeat chest CT showed improvement of nodules.
Comparison of Chest CTs from [**8-20**] and [**8-26**] showed interval worsening of multifocal pneumonia and right side pleural effusion.
Of note, the patient's WBC count has been within normal limits from [**Date range (1) **].
Repeat echocardiogram on [**8-31**] showed no valvular abnormalities suggestive of endocarditis, EF >55%.
Repeat Chest CT [**2128-9-5**] showed little interval change.
[**Last Name (un) **] #2: Creatinine increasing around [**8-18**] after VRE grew from blood likely sepsis related with peak at 2.0.
#) ANEMIA/THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Found to have HCT of 10% on admission.
There was concern for autoantibodies to platelets but PRA testing was negative.
EEG was performed, which was not consistent with seizures.
Consideration was also paid to potential role of tacrolimus, levels of which were significantly elevated during [**Last Name (un) **].
A repeat MRI head was done on [**9-1**] which showed small vessel disease, but no acute process.
ENT was consulted and thin cut CT of the sinuses was performed.
Repeat EEG was performed on [**2128-9-4**].
Paracentesis showed that fluid in the abdomen was bile   and the tube interrogation demonstrated that bile was leaking into the peritoneum  and that the perc tube was displaced and terminating anterior to the liver.
Labs showed increasing lactic acid with severe metabolic acidosis.
Patient's pressures held in the 70s-80s (MAP ~50), but he was unresponsive.
His blood cultures have been negative since then but a repeat bile culture from [**8-31**] again grew vanc sensitive enterococcus.
And bile cultures from [**9-10**] is growing rare enterococcus in aerobic vile.
Echo did not show evidence of endocarditis on [**8-31**].
His urine cultures have remained negative.
He had an MRI brain on [**9-1**] that did not show any evidence of acute infection.
Culture of PICC tip removed on [**9-1**] yielded no growth.
He does not have any diarrhea or leukocytosis, and his C diff stool PCR was negative on [**2128-9-7**], but he seems to have significant abdominal pain.
CT [**9-11**] showed no intrabdominal abscess but mild edema of the colon c/w volume overload vs colitis/typhilitis and stable bilateral pleural effusions.
Another explanation for his hypotension may be adrenal insufficiency given random cortisol of 8.6 which is inappropriately low given current severe illness.
His bilirubin and alk phos continued to trend up despite the stent placement.
Tbilis from 4 to 12.2 and alk phos from 200s to 790s.
Pt's ABG showed CO2 retention and hypoxia.
Bronchoscopy did not show obvious pathology and BAL cultures are pending.
CT scan shows stable to slightly increased bilateral pleural effusions and interval increase of parenchymal atelectasis vs consolidation at bases, no evidence of empyema.
CXR did not show any signs of consolidation.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: on [**10-11**], his creatinine noted to rise up to 3.4.
CPK was checked and was 14.
Initially, patient had intermittent RUQ pain but CT abd/pelvis and RUQ u/s showed no biliary dilation or other acute intraabdominal pathology likely responsible for pain.
A HIDA scan on [**10-11**] showed CBD obstruction and patient sent for ERCP and placement of stent.
Fish XY test was sent to test if blood cells were from engrafted XX cord transplant.
Cyclosporine levels were checked daily.
PTT, PT, fibrinogen 377, LDH 274 not suggestive of DIC.
# PRES: diagnosed on MRI head on [**9-30**] and emperically treated for HSV encephalitis.
EEG on [**9-4**] with no seizure activity.
Indirect bili 0.9 and haptoglobin 212, thus unlikely to be hemolysis.
Hct was monitored daily with a transfusion goal of hct<21  #Hypogammaglobulinemia: The pt's IgG level from [**9-15**] was low in the 500 range.
The patient received a one time dose of IVIG on [**9-15**] 500mg/kg IV (sucrose-free IVIG) X 1 dose  #Adrenal insufficiency: Diagnosis based on hypotension and random cortisol level of 8.6.
MRI brain on [**9-1**] showed no acute process.
EEG on [**2128-9-6**] did not show epileptiform activity and levetiracetam was discontinued.
-transfuse with goal Hct > 25, Plt > 15 -continue ursodiol for [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease prevention -continue prior mycophenolate for GVHD prophylaxis -transition from tacrolimus to cyclosporine today -f/u tacrolimus and cyclosporine levels -f/u oncology recs  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== - Will need colonsocopy for transverse colon focal thickening once clinical status improves (i.e non-neutropenic)  Medications on Admission: None.
