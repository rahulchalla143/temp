RML infiltrate, and he was placed on nitro gtt.

Of note, cardiac enzymes were notable for negative troponin x 2 and BNP 268 then 560. .

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Post bypass The patient is s/p Mitral valve repair with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 30 ring and an 25 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement The patient is on an Norepinephrine drip at 0.05 mcg/kg/min and a milrinone drip at 0.5 mcg/kg/min The cardiac index is 2.9 The mitral ring is well seated with no peri/paravalvular leaks seen.The mean gradient across the mitral valve is 3 mmhg The aortic valve is well seated with no peri/paravalvular leaks.The mean gradient across the aortic valve is 11 mm hg There is persistent moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation The aorta is intact post decannulation LV function is preserved at an EF of>55%  Cardiac Catheterization [**2159-2-27**] 1.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated two vessel CAD.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left sided filling  pressures with a mean PCWP of 28mm Hg.
The was moderate to severe pulmonary pressure with a PASP of 58mm Hg and an elevate PVR.
The was low normal systemic systolic pressure of 90mm HG with severely depressed cardiac index of 1.8 l/min/m2.
CTA [**2159-3-5**] 1.
Bilateral pleural effusions, stable on the right and decreased on the left compared to the prior examination.

A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed single vessel coronary artery disease.
A chest CT scan was performed which showed a stable dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta measuring up to 4.7 cm in diameter and likely pneumonina.
As there was some concern that these lesions could also represent bronchogenic carcinoma, a repeat CT scan was done.
On [**2159-3-8**], Mr. [**Known lastname 3075**] was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
Hematocrit remained stable and bleeding stopped.
