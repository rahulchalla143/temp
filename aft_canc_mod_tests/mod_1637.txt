While these may represent bone islands, given the concern for metastatic disease, a bone scan could be used to further evaluate these findings.
CT chest: The airways are patent to the subsegmental level.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Please refer for more detailed description of abdominal findings in prior abdomen CT from [**1-7**].
MRI head: [**2149-1-10**] 1.
MRCP: [**2149-1-11**] 1.
EGD [**1-14**]: Findings: Esophagus:  Excavated Lesions A single clean-based but somewhat atypical appearing non-bleeding 15 mm ulcer was found at the gastroesophageal junction.
There is no role for repeat ERCP as a sphincterotomy was not performed and bleeding would be from tumor eroding into a vessel.
EGD [**1-16**]:Esophagus:  Mucosa: Clean based 8mm erosion/ulceration seen at GE junction without evidence of bleeding.
A CTA was not pursued in this setting.
# Metastatic adenocarcinoma: The patient was initially admitted to floor for work up of his weight loss and imaging showed diffuse liver lesions, with liver biopsy confirming adenocarcinoma.
Cancer screening was not up to date.
His liver enzymes were found to be elevated so he underwent an MRCP.
Also likely that periods of hypotension led to acute tubular necrosis, accounting for his decreasing urine output, as well as increasing creatinine.
