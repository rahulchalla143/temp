Based on his previous failed attempts to get an MRI, it was decided to electively intubate the patient for an MRI of his brain and spine.
He had MRI head and spine which showed leptomeningeal involvement.
His LP drain broke and the patient was febrile, thus preventing a new one from being placed.
CT abd was negative.
# Cryptococcal meningitis: Pt was found to have recurrence of cryptococcal meningitis by positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test at a titer of >1:64.
Gram stain was negative.
Other cultures were found to be negative including HSV, so the patient was continued only on Ambisome.
Flucytosine was held intially given the patient's ARF (worst Cr 1.9 on [**7-29**]).
He has follow up with [**Hospital 8611**] clinic for repeat LP and follow up of his cryptococcal meningitis.
During hospital stay had 2 ophtho exams negative for retinitis.
Of note, prior to discharge, the patient's free water boluses by TF were increased to 150cc to increase hydration as BUN/Cr slightly trending upwards to BUN 27/ Cr 1.4.
Please recheck lytes and give IV fluids or increase hydration through TF to keep patient at baseline BUN low 20s and Cr 1.1-1.3. .
Also, if spikes temperature, would consider sending patient for abd CT to r/o abcess, collections given 2 foreign bodies in abdomen but currently no increased pain or evidence of infection at VP-shunt or G-J sites.
Retic count depressed at 0.8.
Vitamin B12 was 264 and folate 6.6 on [**2172-8-3**].
Patient was started on B12 repletion and Hct remained stable throughout hospital stay.
