Upon arrival to the ED, a non-contrast CT of the head was done.
The imaging revealed hemorrhage in a prior right frontal resection site, intraventricular extension, and mild hydrocephalus.

CT Head [**2142-5-19**]:  IMPRESSION: Stable right frontal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and dilation.
CT Head [**2142-5-20**]:  IMPRESSION: Stable right frontal hemorrhage, with intraventricular extension.
CT Head [**2142-5-21**]:  IMPRESSION: Stable examination with right frontal hemorrhage and intraventricular extension.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 63651**] is a 60-year-old woman with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme was admitted for neurological deficits from baseline and was found to have a right intracranial hemorrhage on CT scan.
A repeat of her CT Scan the following morning was performed, which did not reveal any change is the size of the bleed.
The initial plan was to repeat a CT scan at time of discharge, however, as further events resulted in change in goals of care, this plan was no longer appropriate.
Applied pressure and Afrin did not control the bleeding.
Proteus was seen in urine culture, thus pt was treated with a 7 day course of ceftriaxone for a complicated UTI (pt had a Foley).
