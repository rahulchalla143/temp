Part 11 is additionally labeled "-20", and is entirely submitted in cassette F.  CT Head without contrast post-op [**2152-6-26**]: FINDINGS: There is a new left frontal burr hole for stereotactic biopsy.
MRI Head ([**2152-6-29**]) FINDINGS: Study is slightly limited due to patient motion during examination.
An MRI of the spine is recommended to assess for leptomeningeal involvement of the spinal axis.
CT head ([**2152-6-30**])  FINDINGS: Again demonstrated is a large bifrontal mass, compatible with biopsy-proven GBM, with significant mass effect on the adjacent frontal horns of the lateral ventricles and rightward shift of midline by approximately 7 mm.

Head CT was repeated; and found to have significantly worsened edema.
In subsequent hours, his neurological examination significantly improved to the point that he could possibly be discharged.
