C.CATH Study Date of [**2166-3-25**] 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated mean PCPW of 25mmHg with a low cardiac index of 2.3 l/min/m2.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI-3 flow (see PTCA comments).
Distal aortography revealed severe bilateral iliac and common femoral disease procluding the potential placement of IABP.
A rectal exam revealed gross blood.
The patient's blood pressure transiently dropped to SBP in the 80s, but responded to fluid boluses, blood transfusion, and dopamine.
ECHO Study Date of [**2166-3-26**] EF 25- 30% There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the antero-septum and entire distal LV including the apex.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Of note, CI was never low (>3.0) and SVR was intermittently 600s-700s during episodes of hypotension (SVR increased appropriately with uptitration of pressors).
Rec'd one unit of blood on HOD2 for Hct 29->35->32.
Given this clinical picture, patient's initial hypotension post STEMI was thought to be secondary to cardiogenic shock despite Swan-Ganz values, and as patient's cardiac function recovered, blood pressure improved appropriately.
* ACID BASE DISTURBANCE: When patient arrived, had AG of 14, potassium of 3.1 and ABG 7.54/18/164 suggesting a respiratory alkalosis w/ mixed gap and non gap metabolic acidemia.
Further, cosyntropin stim revealed no adrenal insufficiency that would explain patient's condition.
Although further intervention could be pursued, given high grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and multiple nodules noted on MRI and CT at [**Hospital1 2025**] and [**Hospital3 1443**], it was felt that patient would be best served with workup and thorough staging and prognostic evaluation of malignancy to further determine utility of revascularization.
As noted above, as hypotension improved, patient was started on carvedilol and lisinopril to improve cardiac remodeling.
With weaning of dopamine and uptitration of carvedilol, patient's heart rate improved to 60s-80s at the time of discharge.
Patient was to followup with oncologist for PET/CT evaluation of malignant peripheral nerve sheath CA.
Followup Instructions: Colonoscopy - Recommend followup colonoscopy given anorectal bright red blood to rule out malignancy as outpatient.
Oncology: Please follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 62117**] as scheduled on Please go for your PET scan and CT of the chest and abdomen at [**Hospital1 2025**] as scheduled by Dr.[**Name (NI) 62118**] office.
