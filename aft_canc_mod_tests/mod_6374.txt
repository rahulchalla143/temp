Interventional radiology was consulted and recommended serial hct checks with potential intervention if her Hct fails to stabilize.
After presenting with an Hct of 32, her Hct gradually trended downwards overnight despite receiving 2 units of PRBC.
She was transfused one unit post procedure and her Hct responeded appropriately to 28.
She remained stable throughout the night into the next morning and was transfused another unit the next afternoon ([**2128-7-22**]) for an Hct of 27.
Her repeat Hct was 25.
Her repeat Hct was 27.7 and she remained with stable Hcts throughout the night.
She did not require additional transfusions, her urine output remained excellent.
She was transferred to the floor where her HCT remained stable.
#bacteremia: on HD2, her blood cultures from admission grew GPCs; her antibiotic coverage initially just ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis was broadened to vanc/cefepime.
It was felt that she did not have SBP and cefepime was discontinued when cultures showed only 1/2 bottles of coag negative staph.
#HCV cirrhosis - [**1-29**] hepatitis C, with concurrent HCC see below.
Her home spironolatone and lasix were restarted after her hematocrit remained stable for several days.
#Portal Vein Thrombosis - she had been on lovenox for PVT which was likely the cause of the rectus sheath hematoma.
