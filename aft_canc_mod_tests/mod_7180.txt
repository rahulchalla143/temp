[**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] and [**Doctor First Name **] She is status post 1 cycle of Taxol/Carboplatin [**2165-10-17**], 15 session WBI ([**2165-9-22**]), and recently started cycle 2 of [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol ([**11-13**] was cycle 2, D1).
CT head showed mets but no new mets, no increased edema, and no mass effect.
Of note, she had a recent INR that was 5; she held her coumadin dose night prior to admission.
She was found to have a mass on CXR during a workup for worsening hoarse voice in [**8-4**].
She then had a CT scan at an OSH which revealed a R lower lobe infrahilar mass.
She then had a PET scan which showed this mass was FDG-avid, as were multiple bilateral mediastinal lymph nodes, as well as supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes.
Ms. [**Known lastname 8957**] was then seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for evaluation of diagnostic procedure (likely bronchoscopy +/- mediastinoscopy).
She had an MRI as part of her metastatic workup which revealed multiple brain metastases, the largest of which was 1.5cm.
She was not symptomatic, so nothing was done urgently, but the plan was to proceed with the bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy in order to obtain tissue for diagnosis.
Unfortunately, on [**2165-9-3**], Ms. [**Known lastname 8957**] had loss of consciousness and what sounds like a seizure at work.
She was taken by EMS to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] hospital where a CT scan revealed edema in the area of the L temporo-parietal region, which was the area of the largest brain met seen on previous MRI.
She was loaded with fosphenytoin and had a repeat CT scan which showed no additional change.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

CT of the head showed mild increase of edema.
Neurologic exam was largely unchanged.
Gastroenteritis was felt to be a distant possibility.
Compazine, ativan, phenergen, and zyprexa were given as needed for nausea.
The patient had a negative head CT for any acute bleeding at that time.
Aspiration pneumonia seen on CXR [**11-21**] but as patient had been afebrile and stable, was believed to be resolving PNA from previous admission.
Repeat CXR showed worsening aspiration/PNA.
The patient's blood counts remained stable throughout admission.
INR was supratherapeutic on admission.
Blood draws and vital sign checks were discontinued prior to discharge.
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for nausea.
