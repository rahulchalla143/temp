The patient has had frequent nausea and vomiting and was sent for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 69**], status post duodenal stenting today at the proximal common bile duct, and internal and external biliary drain placement.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had a temperature of 95.1, his blood pressure was 130/80, his heart rate was 64, his respiratory rate was 18, and his oxygen saturation was 94% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed he had scleral icterus.
The lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate.
His hematocrit was noted to be dropped down to 26 from 32 that day, and the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring and transfusions.
The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, nasogastric lavage of 2 liters did not clear at all.
Before the patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, he had an upper gastrointestinal study which revealed an obstructed duodenal stent.
A Gastroenterology consultation felt that the upper gastrointestinal bleeding was likely due to the instrumentation and an ulceration in the region of the duodenal stent which was stable and did not require any treatment.
His blood pressure was stable.
His nausea persisted, and the patient continued to have emesis with scant blood and stable hematocrits.
Repeat lower extremity Doppler studies revealed that the right-sided deep venous thrombosis was still present, and there was great concern over how to manage this best given the patient's need for anticoagulation, concern for pulmonary embolism given the presence of the deep venous thrombosis, unlikely benefit of an inferior vena cava filter, and the persistent inability for the patient take oral intake well and get adequate nutrition in the context of severe worsening metastatic disease.
Oxygen by nasal cannula (to keep saturations greater than 93% on 3 liters).
