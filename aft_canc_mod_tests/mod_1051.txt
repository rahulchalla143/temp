He noted that his SOB started as he was going upstairs to the second level of his home, when he would feel winded.
At around the same time, a cough developed, which was often productive of clear or yellow sputum in the morning.
In [**Month (only) 547**], he was seen for a stress test and a CXR was performed, which showed the pleural effusion.

Absence of staining for the prostate markers and the cytokeratin-7 positivity rule out a prostatic origin.
[**5-4**] pleural fluid, cell block:  adenocarcinoma   Brief Hospital Course: 1.  adenocarcinoma - Pt had recurrent right pleural effusion and a mass seen on CT scan; given his past history of smoking and asbestos exposure, concern was clearly for malignancy.
As pt had recurrent R pleural effusion, a pleuroscopy was performed, which showed studding of parietal pleura with small masses, which were biopsied and found to be consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Pt underwent talc pleurodesis; the first attempt was unsuccessful, so a second trial of talc pleurodesis was performed, and the chest tube had little output after [**2-1**] days and was successfully removed.
Staging CT scans and a bone scan were performed, which showed no evidence of metastasis.
However, with further analysis of the CT scan, it was felt that inflammation from the VATS procedure and inflammation from the pneumonia were the causes of obstruction, and XRT would not improve the situation, and may in fact be harmful.
2.  postobstructive pneumonia - Pt completed a 7 day course of levo/flagyl but continued to have increased O2 requirements (up to 10L NC, satting in the low 90s) and was febrile.
A repeat chest CT scan showed increased consolidation in the RLL.
Metformin was held prior to CT scans.
He was discharged on oral hypoglycemics and instructed to check his fingersticks and call his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] >350.
