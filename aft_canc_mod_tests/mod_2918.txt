Her creatinine on the day of treatment was 0.9.
Prior to admission she presented with SOB and dyspnea on exertion to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital [**2194-3-25**] where CT showed a 1.5 cm tumor filling the superior pulmonary vein draining the upper and middle lobe on the right.
Extensive workup includig flexible bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy ([**2194-3-28**]) and cervical mediastinoscopy of multiple levels of nodes ([**2194-3-29**]) did not reveal a histologic iagnosis.
MRI of the brain was negative.
She underwent thoracoscopic biopsy of this mass with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] [**2194-4-15**].
Pathology showed adenocarcinoma.
As her PFT's showed moderate to severe obstructive ventilatory defect and moderately reduced diffusing capacity as well as the fact that the lung scan showed 40% of her ventiliation and perfusion occur in her right lung, she is considered a non- operable candidate despite the small size of her lesion.

CT CHEST (7/35): A well-defined pulmonary nodule measuring approximately 10 x 9 mm in the right lower lobe.
CT CONSTRAST W/O CONTRAST ([**6-29**]): Organizing left groin hematoma, without evidence of retroperitoneal extension.
Left groin hematoma - as a complication of attempted line placement for hemodyalysis, Hct drop to 19, s/p 2 units of PRBCs on [**6-28**], Hct to 27.6.
Repeat ultrasound showed no pseudoaneysm formation and a stable L groin hematoma.
CT pelvis was performed and showed no sign of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
A peripheral smear did not reveal any significant schistocytes.
She then became oligouric and a test dose of 40 of lasix was given with little urine output.
Urine output still inadequate but improving slightly, now >300cc/day.
Her input and output were carefully monitored and she was initially started on NS and her sodium increased from 121 to 125 over twenty four hours.
She was then converted to 2amp bicarb/1/2NS to address both the hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis, with clinical signs of fluid overload, and little urine output she was discontinued from IVF.
Electrolytes being managed by nephrology during dialysis.
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed.
