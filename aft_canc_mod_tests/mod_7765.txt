Based on the pattern of his LFT's, his pancytopenia, his lymphadenopathy, and hiw weight loss, this was thought to be most likely be a malignant infiltrative process with rapid progression.
Multiple lab tests from [**Hospital1 18**] and pathology reports from the OSH are pending at the time of death.
