Colonoscopy confirmed a near obstructing lesion of the descending colon at approximately 50 cm.
Colonoscopic biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma.

Chest: Her chest rose and fell with equal size, shape and symmetry, her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CV: PMI appreciated in the fifth ICS in the midclavicular line without heaves or thrills, RRR, normal S1 and S1 no murmurs rubs or gallops.
Rectal exam done in ED shows brown guiac positive stool Back: No spinal or CVA tenderness.

Pertinent Results: [**2122-2-1**] 03:00PM   WBC-3.3* RBC-3.59* HGB-8.9* HCT-28.8* MCV-80* MCH-24.9* MCHC-31.1 RDW-19.0*  GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2122-2-3**] No definite evidence of GI bleeding.
Colonoscopy [**2122-2-4**] Colonic mass @ 50 cm, mucosal biopsy: Adenocarcinoma  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD W&W/O C 1) Multiple, tiny hypoattenuating liver lesions, which likely represent simple cysts.
This could be further worked up with a CT colonoscopy if indicated.
CT COLON TECH ABD/PEL W&W/O C  [**2122-2-10**] 11:41 AM 1.
She underwent an emergent tagged red cell study after a supposed episode of bright red blood per rectum but which was eventually deemed falsely positive due to her ileal conduit.
She then went to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer hemodynamic monitoring and bowel prep for a colonoscopy.
The colonoscopy was done on [**2122-2-4**] and showed a large fungating mass in the descending colon which was partially obstructing the bowel at 50cm.
Biopsy was positive for adenocarcinoma.
CT scan on [**2-5**] demonstrated a short segment stricture with wall thickening identified in the mid-descending colon consistent with mass seen on colonoscopy and without lymphadenopathy.
On [**2122-2-6**], her hematocrit dropped from 29.2 to 26.9 then 25.1 and was subsequently transfused with 2 units of PRBCs by the medicine team; repeat hematocrit was 29.7.
On POD 1, her temperature was 101.3 but decreased thereafter with encouraged incentive spirometry.
Pain was well controlled by epidural and was eventually d/c'd on POD 4 and was started on a dilaudid PCA.
She was then switched to clears on POD 7 with positive flatus and bowel movement and her PICC was d/c'd later that same day.
