She was initially scheduled for a VATS procedure on [**9-18**], but was admitted to an outside hospital on [**9-16**] with worsening shortness of breath and severe dysphagia and a temperature to 102.0.
Mediastinoscopy on [**9-21**] was positive for a small cell lung cancer.
Neurology recommended a head MRI and lumbar puncture to rule out leptomeningeal disease at that time.
MRI of the spine on [**9-25**] showed diffuse bony metastases and epidural tumor in the lower thoracic spine.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs temperature 98.1.
Pulse 88.
Blood pressure 120/80.
Respiratory rate 20.
Pulse ox 94% on room air.
She shrugs her shoulders and turns her head against resistance with no obvious deficiency.
ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES:  White blood cell count 9.8, hematocrit 28.8, platelets 166, sodium 139, potassium 3.7, chloride 100, bicarbonate 26, BUN 6, creatinine 0.6, glucose 81, ionized calcium 1.32, magnesium 1.7, phosphate 3.1, INR 1.3, total bilirubin 0.8, AST 29, ALT 16, alkaline phosphatase 118, albumin 2.7, TSH 11.0, uric acid 3.2, ammonia of 50.
MRI of the brain on [**2122-9-25**] showed no clear evidence of intracranial mass or metastasis, but was limited by motion artifact.
MRI of the spine on [**9-25**] showed clearly diffuse bony metastatic disease and epidural tumor in the lower thoracic spine.
Pathology of [**2122-9-23**] for right paratracheal nodes positive for metastatic small cell carcinoma.
Pertinent records from the [**Hospital3 4527**] where the patient had been admitted prior to transfer for mediastinoscopy, swallowing evaluation with question of hysterical etiology, upper gastrointestinal study was negative for esophageal narrowing.
Initial chest x-ray showed a new left lower lobe and medial basilar segment right lower lobe infiltrate.
Repeat chest x-ray showed some slight improvement in the pneumonia with a persistent lung mass and a small pleural effusion.
Significant interventions at [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital included transfusion of two units of packed red cells for a hematocrit of 24%.
A lumbar puncture was attempted on the evening of admission in order to analyze spinal fluid for evidence of leptomeningeal involvement.
The lumbar puncture was unsuccessful and was not further pursued on the recommendation of the Neurology Service who felt that it would put the patient at risk for inadvertent seating of the cerebral spinal fluid.
As noted the MRI of the brain was negative, but MRI of the spine did show a leptomeningeal enhancement consistent with dural metastases as well as diffuse metastatic disease of the lower thoracic, lumbar and sacral spine.
MRI of the spine showed no evidence of cord compression.
A swallowing study was performed, which confirmed the patient's aspiration.
Urine lytes and urine osmolarity studies suggested that the patient's hyponatremia was most consistent with SIADH a not uncommon finding in the presence of small cell lung cancer.
The patient's sodium gradually corrected from a low of 126 to approximately 130.
She was started empirically on Ceftazidime and cultures were sent.
Hematological:  The patient's initial hematocrit was low and iron studies revealed that the anemia was most consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Post chemotherapy the patient required transfusion for a hematocrit of 23 on [**2122-10-7**].
Emergent bronchoscopy revealed a large mucous plug in the left lung.
