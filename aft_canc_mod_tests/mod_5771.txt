Serial laboratory work was noted that the patient's hematocrit was decreasing dropping reportedly from 37 to 29.6 within several days.
In the Emergency Department the patient's blood pressure was labile ranging from 80s to 115s systolic.
He was seen by the Gastroenterology Service who recommended a tagged red blood cell scan followed by an esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs temperature 99.0, blood pressure 120/58, pulse 84, respiratory rate 20, weight 72 kilograms.
Head and neck examination revealed normocephalic, atraumatic.
Lungs clear to auscultation with good breath sounds and air movement.
Gastrointestinal bleeding:  The patient underwent a tagged red blood cell scan on [**2188-2-14**], which demonstrated a very small amount of gastrointestinal bleeding mostly in the left lower quadrant most likely within the small bowel.
He continued to have melena as well as lability in his blood pressure and hematocrit.
He was monitored with serial hematocrits and transfused to keep his hematocrit greater then 28 to 30.
He underwent additional studies including esophagogastroduodenoscopy and duodenoscopy on [**2188-2-19**], which demonstrated angiectasias in the second part of the duodenum, which was treated with thermal therapy.
Because of dropping hematocrits and recurrent melanotic stools the patient underwent a pill study on [**2188-2-22**], which showed fresh blood and active bleeding from the arterial venous malformations seen in the proximal small bowel.
He continued again to have melanotic stools and had repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2188-2-25**].
Blood pressure fell to 80/40 with a heart rate in the 90s.
Gastrointestinal lavage demonstrated 2 liters of normal saline with dark red material that was not fully cleared.
Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2188-2-27**] showed red blood and clot overlying a prior cautery site in the mid to distal duodenum.
Repeat enteroscopy was performed on [**2188-3-6**], which demonstrated red blood in the second part of the duodenum and an ulcer ni the second part of the duodenum.
Basically the patient was afforded with serial transfusions to keep his hematocrit appropriate above 30 in light of his history of coronary artery disease.
As an outpatient he will have serial hematocrit checks and was arranged to have outpatient blood transfusions if necessary.
Echocardiogram on [**2188-2-21**] showed hyperdynamic with EF 75% with severe resting outflow tract obstruction left ventricular hypertrophy as well as 3+ mitral regurgitation consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
His previous medications of Atenolol, Hydrochlorothiazide and Isordil will not be continued as an outpatient.
Hematocrit stabilized, melena decreased and tolerating a regular diet.
He was to be transfused for a hematocrit of less then 30 at the [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 94138**] Center.
Mylanta 15 to 30 ml po q.i.d.
He had an appointment made with the Outpatient [**First Name (STitle) 94138**] Center on [**2188-3-11**] if a blood [**Date Range **] was needed.
He also had a follow up echocardiogram on [**2188-4-16**].
