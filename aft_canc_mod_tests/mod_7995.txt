She also underwent a chest CT that demonstrated a 4-mm pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe, and within the posterior segment of the left upper lobe there was an ill-defined 3-mm nodule.
Liver volumes were performed and these included total liver volume of 1001 mL, the right lobe has 394 mL, left lobe 606 mL, left lateral segment 401 mL, and the caudate lobe 17 mL.
CA19-9 on [**9-18**] was 18.2 and her AFP was 98.3.
She has no history of IV drug use, marijuana use, blood transfusions, or tattoos.
Physical Exam: VS at clinic visit: BP 158/86, pulse 90, respirations 16, temperature 98.6, weight 51.9 kilos, and height 5 feet 5 inches.
On physical examination she is a thin, alert, well-developed female who appears younger than her stated age.
Her abdominal exam is benign.
Pertinent Results: Laboratory studies drawn on [**9-21**] include hemoglobin 14.2, hematocrit 44.8, WBC 5.2, platelets 170, INR 1.2, sodium 128, potassium 4.9, chloride 92, creatinine 0.7, BUN 15, AST 96, ALT 93, alkaline phosphatase 327, total bilirubin 1.0, direct bilirubin 0.5, albumin 4.0, magnesium 1.7, AMA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] smooth positive, CEA 6.4, AFP 98.3, HCV antibody negative, and CA19-9 1639, hemoglobin A1c 9.3, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, hepatitis B surface antibody positive, and hepatitis B core antibody positive,.
IVFs were given with improvement in UOP and MAP, Hct was checked which was stable.
Her labs that night demonstrated a severe metabolic acidosis 7.10/28/213/9/-19  lactate 14.6.
Despite this, her UOP decreased, she went into renal failure with a rising Cr that peaked at 2.8, and her LFTs continued to rise, with an unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] into the 6000 range.
A liver Duplex was performed on three separate occassions, since her clinical status was not improving.
All three U/S exams demonstrated normal portal venous, arterial, and hepatic venous flow without reversal.
On the evening of POD 2 she suddenly had an increase in her pressor requirement along with a drop in her Hct from 32->26->20   Given her overall clinical picture, it was felt that only operative exploration could diagnose the etiology of her liver dysfunction.
