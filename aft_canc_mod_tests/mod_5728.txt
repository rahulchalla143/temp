# Anemia - Initially admitted to the ICU with hematocrit of 19.
An EGD showed mild bleeding gastropathy, likely source of melena and blood loss.
Goal hematocrit this admission was >25.
Of note, his hematocrit dropped several times this admission despite improvement in melena, this corresponded to administration of albumin for SBP.
He blood counts were stable at the time of discharge.
Cultures later grew pansensitive Klebsiella, and treatment with 2g Ceftriaxone was initiated for 5d total course.
However, his creatinine subsequently improved (albumin given as above), and was stable at 1.6 upon discharge.
# Alcoholic Cirrhosis - complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, varices, ascites, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
# Asymptomatic bacteruria:  Urine cultures grew several strains of VRE.
These cultures were associated with a negative UA, grew in low colony counts, and when coupled with the fact the patient was asymptomatic, was felt most likely to represent colonization, and the patient was not treated.
You also had an infection, which we treated with 5 days of IV antibiotics.
