Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Brain biopsy [**2111-2-23**] Central line placement [**2111-2-28**] Portacath placement [**2111-3-12**] G-tube placement [**2111-3-12**]  History of Present Illness: This is a 73 year old female with history of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, bipolar disorder, and hypothyroidism, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with mental status change, aphasia, left sided weakness and facial droop, and encephalopathy.
She was found at outside hospital to have multiple brain lesions with mass effect on CT scan.
Here an MRI of the head showed multiple, likely metastatic lesions of the brain.
CT abd showed suspicious low attenuation lesion in dome of liver.
CT head repeat showed multiple enhancing lesions including the largest in the right frontal lobe measuring 15 mm, most consistent with metastatic disease.
The patient underwent bipsy on 2/209 which has confirmed CNS lymphoma.
On CXR on [**2111-3-3**] the patient was found to have new collapse of the RML and RLL, in addition to enlarging pleural effusions compared to prior AP films.
On repeat imaging, the RML and RLL collapse had resolved and the patient's oxygenation status improved.
Past Medical History: - Bipolar disorder - Anxiety - Hypothyroidism - Chronic ETOH use - Left distal radial fracture in [**2110-8-22**], chronic back pain, recent fall with chin laceration and facial contusion, recent hospital admission for failure to thrive.
Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS: T 95.4 F, BP 94/48, HR 59, RR 20, O2sat 99% on RA.
Radial and DP pulses 2+  NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  Her Karnofsky Performance Score is 50.
Her reflexes are 3+ bilaterally.
Sensory examination is notable for grimace to pinch applied to all 4 extremities.
Coordination examination does not reveal gross appendicular dysmetria.
