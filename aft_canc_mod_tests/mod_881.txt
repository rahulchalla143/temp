Colonoscopy revealed a benign polyp.
A&O x3   Pertinent Results: ECHO: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: 3.7 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: *4.1 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient: 64 mm Hg Aortic Valve - Mean Gradient: 40 mm Hg Mitral Valve - E Wave: 1.1 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 1.2 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 0.92 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 270 msec LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is very difficult to assess but it may be normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2167-12-7**], LV function may have improved.
1)Anemia: Pt was recently admitted in [**2170-5-31**] for anemia work-up and found to have a bleeding gastric ectasia on EGD which was removed.
Pt was found to have Hct of 18 on this admission.
Pt finally underwent colonoscopy which revealed no source of bleed.
Since pt's Hct was stable 25 34-35, no further diagnostic procedure was done.
Last echo before admission was from [**2168**] which showed EF of 35-40%.
She got an echo on [**9-20**] which showed EF>55%.
Pt was initially started on niseritide and lasix for diuresis for suspected CHF exacerbation before her initial Hct of 18 came back.
However, after 5 days of prep for the colonoscopy, pt started to gain weight everyday and was net positive daily.
Pt's admission weight was 130 kg (128 kg in a clinic note) and has gotten up as high as 139 kg.
However, she was able to diuresis 1-2L/day and her weight came down to 130kg which is her baseline.
Coumadin was restarted with goal INR of [**1-2**].
Pt needs to be seen by her PCP to check her INR level.
