1st CXR with cardiomegaly, early chf.
Per OSH notes, "exam worrisome for PE given large swollen leg, but already anticoagulated with INR 3.2".
Received blood for hct 27 and melena on exam (OGT negative for blood).
ABG with pO2 466 -- so o2sat not realiable.
ETT advanced 2cm after post tube CXR.
Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation and management.
[**Hospital1 18**] ED COURSE: Initial VS T97.6 HR 70 BP 185/102, Placed on propofol for sedation BP dropped to 93/42-->88/50, HR 65.
Propofol off, BP increased to 113/56, 1U PRBC and 2UFFP given, unclear why Atropine 0.5mg x1 given.

CXR c/w pulm edema which may have improved with BiPAP.
On HD#2 pt with increased sputum production, with sputum cx positive for GNR.
He was continued on vanco/ctx empirically for ?sepsis as below, however CTA was negative for consolidation or PE.
Sputum cultures speciated enterbacter with intermediate sensitivity to ceftriaxone on [**10-4**], so pt switched to cefepime.
EP consult obtained, as below, felt pauses were [**3-1**] pulmonary disease and vagal tone, without intrinsic conduction disease.
Pt weaned off O2 gradually (goal O2 sat > 90%), with plan to complete 14 d course [**Month/Year (2) 9847**].
Given emphysema seen on CXR may continue to need O2 chronically but should reassess as edema/CHF continues to improve.
Pt received factor IX in ED for unclear reasons, and was given 2U PRBC without bump in HCT (27->28).
Serial HCT were stable 27-28 throughout MICU stay, no recurrence of melena.
On [**10-9**], pt underwent EGD [**10-10**] (no colonoscopy [**3-1**] unable to complete prep [**3-1**] n/v and MS changes).
EGD showed ?varices, though not clearly varices.
Hypotension: admit SBP 74/55, etiology unclear, ddx sepsis vs volume loss [**3-1**] GIB vs some component of pump failure (RV vs LV).
TTE revealed severe RV dysfunction raising concern for PE, however LENI's and CTA were unremarkable.
cardiac enzymes flat (trop 0.03->0.02).
TTE obtained which showed EF 40-50%, no new [**Male First Name (un) 4746**], 1+MR, and severe RV dysfunction concerning for PE.
CTA negative for PE, but showed severe COPD, which is likely chronic cause of RV strain.
EKG shows afib, with IVCD, but otherwise no evidence of dig toxicity.
** ISCHEMIA - unclear h/o CAD s/p MI, EKG without evidence of active ischemia, low voltage, cardiac enzymes unremarkable (peak trop 0.03), TTE without focal WMA.
ASA held [**3-1**] GIB, BB held [**3-1**] hypotension initially.
Cr = 1.1 on discharge.
