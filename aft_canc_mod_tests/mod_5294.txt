However, after the cardiac catheterization that showed LAD and LCx disease, as well as the elevated cardiac enzymes and improvement in chest pain with stents, this was most likely an STEMI.
He had an ECHO which showed an EF of 30-35% with new anterior wall hypokinesis.
Etiology could have been sepsis - his sputum cx grew GNRs.
Blood and urine cx negative.
