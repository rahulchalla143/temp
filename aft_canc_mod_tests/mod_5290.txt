Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: On Discharge: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  Pertinent Results: Labs on admission: [**2178-9-11**] 02:00AM BLOOD WBC-13.2*# RBC-3.88* Hgb-10.6* Hct-34.6* MCV-89 MCH-27.4 MCHC-30.8* RDW-17.8* Plt Ct-462* [**2178-9-11**] 02:00AM BLOOD PT-11.5 PTT-20.5* INR(PT)-1.0 [**2178-9-11**] 02:00AM BLOOD Glucose-138* UreaN-13 Creat-0.6 Na-141 K-4.3 Cl-107 HCO3-26 AnGap-12 [**2178-9-11**] 02:00AM BLOOD Albumin-3.5 Calcium-8.8 Phos-3.1 Mg-1.9  IMAGING: MRI Head [**9-10**](Pre-op): FINDINGS: There has been marked interval enlargement in the heterogeneously enhancing mass within the anterior parasagittal right frontal lobe.
Overall measurements on today's examination are 5.9 x 2.9 x 4.7 cm.
MRI Head [**9-11**](Post-op): FINDINGS: The study is compared with limited enhanced pre-operative planning MR study, as well as the post-surgical NECT, obtained the preceding day.
The patient is status post repeat right frontal craniotomy with extensive post-surgical changes, including marked right frontal pneumocephalus, both intra- and extra-axial, as on the CT obtained one day previously.
The pre-contrast imaging demonstrates an overall relatively thin rim of intrinsic [**Name (NI) 64375**] at the circumference of the resection cavity, which is largely fluid-filled.
Overall, this region is significantly larger than on the last diagnostic MR study of [**2178-5-20**].
However, close comparison of the pre- and post-contrast sequences demonstrates no appreciable nodular, mass-like or other marginal or central enhancement to specifically suggest persistent tumor at the resection bed.
Remainder of the examination is notable only for fluid- opacification of mastoid air cells, right more than left; the opacified right mastoid apex was present on the [**5-9**] study, while that on the left is new, some of which may relate to intubation and/or supine positioning.
Large, 5 cm (AP), right paramedian frontal resection cavity, largely fluid-filled with blood products and, possibly, melanin, at its margin.
LENIS [**9-16**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the lower limbs.
Post-operaive MRI imaging showed no definite focus of marginal or central enhancement suspicious for residual neoplasm.
CT imaging revealed stable slight compression of the right and left frontal horns of the lateral ventricle with stable 4-mm leftward shift of midline structures.
He remained in the ICU and repeat MRUI imaging was performed.
His Bp parameters were liberalized.
