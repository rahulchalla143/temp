Also, in the nursing home, she was found to have a Klebsiella UTI sensitive to ciprofloxacin, to be tachycardiac and hypovolemic.
In the Emergency Room, her initial vital signs revealed a temperature of 98.4, pulse 106, blood pressure 119/66, respiratory rate 18, saturating 96% on 3 liters.
An EKG found her to be in atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.
She received 20 mg of Diltiazem with an appropriate heart rate down to the 80s temporarily.
Her systolic blood pressure at this time was in the 80s to 90s with a heart rate still in the 120s to 150s.
She had continued fluctuating systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 110s.
She was given another 5 mg of Diltiazem for heart rate in the 120s.
At this point, her systolic blood pressure fell to the 70s and the repeat EKG showed questionable fib versus flutter pattern.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, she had a white blood cell count of 9.7, hematocrit 29.0, platelets 206,000.
Sodium 140, potassium 4.8, chloride 105, bicarbonate 18, BUN 41, creatinine 1.3, glucose 115.
PT 13.2, INR 1.2.
ALT 20, AST 41, amylase 15, alkaline phosphatase 62, total bilirubin 0.2.
Cardiac enzymes were drawn which showed a CK of 32, one troponin of 0.08, and another troponin of 1.0.
She had an EKG which showed narrow tachycardia of 120 with normal axis.
She had a chest x-ray which showed a left upper lobe pneumonia with a right IJ without pneumothorax.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.4, blood pressure 116/56, pulse 117, saturating 100% on 2 liters.
Abdomen: An obese abdomen which was nontender and nondistended with very active bowel sounds.
A CT scan was done on [**2168-7-30**] which showed left upper lobe lingula consolidation and collapse without a patent airway.
A needle aspiration biopsy also of the left main lung mass.
with stable systolic blood pressures in the low 100s with diastolics in the upper 60s.
The patient did have one episode during the course of her hospital admission where she became tachycardiac to the 140s with systolic blood pressures in the 80s and diastolic pressures in the 50s.
She was given Diltiazem 10 mg IV which improved her heart rate back down into the 90s.
She did have an echocardiogram done while here which showed an ejection fraction of 55% and a small highly mobile 2 mm mass on the mitral valve which was fibrinous and calcified that was questionable for either thrombus or tumor.
The echocardiogram also showed an intra-atrial septal aneurysm.
It was decided during the course of her hospital admission due to her continuing pulmonary disease that we would not attempt cardioversion or electrophysiology studies at this time.
ANEMIA:  On [**2168-8-1**], the patient did have a hematocrit drop from 28.4 to 21.7.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no bleeding in the retroperitoneal space or in the femoral areas.
Her hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s.
On the date of discharge, her hematocrit was 30.4.
HYPERCALCEMIA:  The patient did have calcium levels in the low 10 range.
Her calcium levels remained stable in the 10.0 range and the patient did not have any symptoms of hypercalcemia and did not show .....................  5.
Her fingersticks were in the 140s to 150s fasting in the morning.
12 hours to be continued until INR reaches 2.0.
