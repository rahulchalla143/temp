He initially had his cerebellar mets diagnosed due to headache on a CT in [**2118-10-20**] and had a VP shunt placed by neurosurgery.
Past Medical History: 1. carcinoma of the rectosigmoid junction and rectum - s/p low anterior resection in [**2115**] - Neo adjuvant chemo radiation ([**2115**]) - Six cycles of CPT-11, 5-FU and leucovorin ([**2116**]) - Ostomy reversal ([**2116**]) - seven cycles of the [**Doctor Last Name **] regimen with Avastin ([**2116**]) - 6 week cycles of FLOX chemotherapy ([**2118**]) - VP shunt placed by neurosurgery ([**9-/2118**]) 2. hypertension 3. diabetes  Social History: He is from the DR [**Last Name (STitle) **] came here 40 years ago.

Pertinent Results: Admission labs: CBC: WBC-8.9 RBC-4.50* Hgb-13.5* Hct-41.4 MCV-92 MCH-30.0 MCHC-32.6 RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-274 Diff: Neuts-87.1* Lymphs-9.3* Monos-3.2 Eos-0.4 Baso-0.1 Coags: PT-12.5 PTT-22.0 INR(PT)-1.1 Chem10: Glucose-816* UreaN-25* Creat-1.1 Na-129* K-5.9* Cl-93* HCO3-27 Calcium-9.1 Phos-2.3* Mg-2.0 cardiac enzymes negative x 2  Imaging: CXR ([**11-22**]): Unchanged appearance of advanced metastatic disease, without discrete foci of consolidation.
HCT ([**11-22**]): A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is seen entering the right frontal region and terminating in the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
MRI ([**11-23**]): A right frontal approach ventriculostomy drainage catheter remains unchanged in position.
The larger of the two left cerebellar hemisphere lesions measures 2.6 x 2.7 cm and is slightly increased in size compared to the prior examination where it measured approximately 2.6 x 2.2 cm.
The right cerebellar hemispheric lesion has an area of susceptibility artifact which corresponds to increased attenuation seen on the recent CT scan.
The ventricles as seen on the prior recent CT scan are much smaller in size compared to the CT from [**2118-9-30**].
The right cerebellar hemispheric lesion has an area of susceptibility artifact and corresponding to increased attenuation on the CT suggestive of intratumoral hemorrhage.
The left hemispheric lesion has decreased T2 signal intensity corresponding to increased attenuation on the CT and likely represents calcification in a mucinous metastasis.
MRI c-spine: wet read: No evidence of metastatic bone disease to the C-spine.
An MRI brain showed three cerebellar metastases with new hemorrhage into one of these metastases, as well as a new right-sided subdural fluid collection and small ventricles.
MRI of the cervical spine was also performed, which showed no evidence of brainstem compression or cervical canal stenosis.
