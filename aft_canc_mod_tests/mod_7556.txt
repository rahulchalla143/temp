CT Head [**8-21**] post-op Post operative changes in the left temporo-parietal region with minimal blood products and air in the resection bed.
Functional MRI [**8-13**] Unchanged intra-axial mass lesion in the left temporal, parietal  and occipital lobes with no significant change since the most recent study.
MRI Head [**8-12**]  5.7 x 4.1 x 2.5 cm lobulated, mixed solid + cystic mass in L parieto-occipital region.
CT Head [**8-11**] Heterogeneity, cystic chagne in L temporal/parietal lobes w/ vasogenic edema, concerning for infiltrative glioma.
