CT HEAD [**2172-11-11**] 9:37 AM 1.
CT LLE; [**2172-10-31**] 2:47 PM IMPRESSION:  1.
Lack of intravenous contrast did limit the sensitivity for detection of small abscesses.
Blood cultures were positive for enterococcus sensitive to ampicillin.
X-rays of the left leg showed chronic osteomyelitis.
ID was consulted on the patient to manage the enterococcal bacteremia; ID will follow his CBC and renal function to determine appropriate renal dosing of ampicillin if his renal function continues to improve.
His ANC trended upward over several days as the rapamycin / sirolimus levels trended down.
The N/V was zofran, and a head CT was also performed to rule out metastasis / mass lesions (unremarkable for this).
Amylase / Lipase were normal repeatedly; his sxs were not considered secondary to pancreatitis or rejection.
# ARF on CKD Urine studies showed ATN.
Blood levels of tacrolimus / sirolimus were checked and found to be markedly elevated (Tac 10.8; Sirolimus 13.6).
He was provided IVFs and his creatinine trended downward, although not quite back to his previous baseline.
His hct continued to trend down slowly, considered secondary to ESRD.
