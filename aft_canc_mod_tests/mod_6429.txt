Subsuquently, his blood cultures grew GPC's and he got Vancomycin.
Today his blood pressure lowered, with SBP's in 80's.
His creatinine increased from 0.9-> 1.3 overnight, and his hemoglobin dropped from 10-.7.6 over the past 6 days.
LENI neg, V/Q scan neg- PE r/o.
Eventually, it was decided that he did not have an aspiration PNA and that his tachypnea was [**1-7**] distended abd.
In the ED his vital were temp 101.6 pt SBP 97-112/46-67, HR 98 RR 30 SaO2 97% NRB.
A CXR was performed with new RUL infitrate.
Cr 1.4, baseline 0.9.
EKG w/o ischemia.
Source was initially thought to be PNA given RUL infiltrate on CXR and hypoxia and he was treated with vanc/zosyn/levo.
He was also anemic on admission with HCT 22 and guaiac positive stools concerning for GI source.
In addition, he had a CT on admission showing early SBO.
On [**2192-9-30**] his blood cultures came back positive for MRSA and pip/tazo + levofloxacin were d/c'd and he was continued on vancomycin alone.
A pleuroscentesis showed the fluid was transudative.
He had an initial TTE showing no definite valvular vegetation and was felt not to be stable enough for a TEE.
A repeat ECHO showed a large aortic valve vegetation and severe AR meeting criteria for surgery.
On [**2192-10-11**] he underwent to surgery for a porcine valve replacement and was transfused 9U pRBC perioperatively for a post op HCT of 30. .
Regarding his abdominal pain, on [**2192-10-15**] he had a KUB and RUQ u/s for abdominal pain and concern for SBO vs cholecystitis.
The KUB showed non obstructive bowel gas pattern with retained contrast c/w delayed transit.
His RUQ ultrasound showed no evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.
On tranfer to the medicine service his vital signs were 98.4 121/78 71 18 97% on 3L.

[**2192-10-7**] CT chest, abdomen, & pelvis with contrast - IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2192-10-7**] CT head with & without contrast - CT HEAD BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST: No evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or recent infarction is seen on the non-contrast study.
Prominence of the ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are consistent with age-related involutional change.
[**2192-10-8**] ECHO -  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-10-1**], a large vegetation is now visualized on the aortic valve (vs. focally thickened non-coronary leaflet).
The left ventricular systolic dysfunction also appears new ?emboli to coronary arteries?
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define the aortic valve vegetation and to identify a potential abscess.
[**2192-10-8**] CXR - The right internal jugular line was inserted in the meantime interval.
[**2192-10-9**] Right Lower Extremity Ultrasound - IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in the right lower extremity.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2192-10-20**] 8:13 PM  There is a punctate focus of elevated signal on image 21, series 502 of the diffusion-weighted scans, but which also appears to have slightly elevated signal on the commensurate FLAIR image.
On diffusion image 15, series 502, there is a punctate area of elevated signal in the right occipital pole that is not seen on the ADC map, and could be an artifact.
He underwent a thoracentesis to drain accumulating pleural fluid due to concern for empyema.
An infectious disease consultation was obtained on [**10-4**] for further assistance.
The patient had a TTE showing no definite valvular vegetation and was felt not to be stable enough for a TEE.
He had a repeat ECHO on the same day showing a large aortic valve vegetation.
Head CT was negative for acute intracranial bleed.
ARF: creatinine increased to 1.4 prior to surgery, like from hypotension, poor perfusion.
The KUB showed non obstructive bowel gas pattern with retained contrast c/w delayed transit.
His RUQ ultrasound showed no evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.
An MRI was ordered for further work-up of mental status changes.
A head MRI showed no process to explain his delirium.
# Atrial fibrillation - he had Afib with RVR post-operatively for which he was started on amiodarone + metoprolol.
Cards had recommended amiodarone 200mg daily for 6 months but CT [**Doctor First Name **] said none is needed since he seems to be in stable sinus rhythm.
# Anemia: HCT 22 on admission with guaiac positive stools concerning for slow GI bleed.
HCT dropping slowly.
Plan to transfuse if increasingly tachycardic or HCT <21.
Grasp was positive but less so over time.
As noted, MRI of the brain showed nothing to explain his delerium or neuro s/s.
All blood cultures since surgery have been sterile.
No need for further screening BCx.
Spine MRI was not done [**1-7**] agitation.
Had KUB and abdominal ultrasound which were unrevealing.
PSA WNL [**2192-10-20**] so was holding leuprolide given low PSA.
SBP 90-110.
Calcium  Oral 8.
Cyanocobalamin  Oral 9.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 100 % Powder [**Month/Day/Year **]: One (1)  PO DAILY (Daily).
