He was maintained on an insulin drop for hyperglycemia with blood sugars ranging to 143.
A liver duplex was done.
Repeat chest x-ray was done that demonstrated satisfactory positioning of all lines and tubes without any pneumothorax and bibasilar atelectasis was noted with the left side greater than the right side.
On [**3-1**] he had pathology assessment of the native liver that demonstrated well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma 1 cm present in the right lobe.
Iron stain demonstrated moderate iron deposition in hepatic sites and bile ducts.
A biopsy of the liver donor demonstrated predominantly macrovascular steatosis involving 20% of the liver parenchyma.

and repeat Prograf level demonstrated a level of 15.4.
A chest x-ray demonstrated no overt evidence of CHF.
A repeat chest x-ray on [**2107-3-3**] demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions and associated bibasilar atelectasis as well as discoid atelectasis in the right apical region.
Of note on [**2107-3-1**] the patient received intraop cardiac echo for evaluation of ASD/patent foramen ovale.
Ejection fraction was 50 to 60%.
Conclusion demonstrated tiny atrial septal defect seen by color Doppler with minimal left to right flow.
