Based on her urine electrolytes the patient appeared to be intravascularly depleated and was given upto 8 liters of fluid.
However her urine output did not improve after fluid boluses and she remained hypotensive.
Patient was scheduled for CT scan of head and CTA but had to be deferred since patient BP was too unstable for her to leave the floor.
An ABG revealed that the patient had an elevated lactate and had a primary metablolic acidosis.
From earlier CT scan and U/S whcihj showed gallbladder wall thickening it was felt that cholecystitis could be the source of her infection.
Patient blood pressure continued to deteriorate and her ABG showed pH as low as 7.02 and lactate as high as 13.
An echo was performed as a last effort to find etiology of hypotension.
The echo showed dialated RV with global hypopkinesis and small LV.
Based on echo results patient was started on milrinone, however as the night progressed her blood pressure did not improve and she had little to no urine output.
