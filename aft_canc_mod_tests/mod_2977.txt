While in the Intensive Care Unit, her peak Tylenol level was 5.1, peak AST and ALT were greater than 10,000, INR peaked at 4.3, total bilirubin peaked at 2.3.
While her labs indicative of liver function continued to improve, her laboratory values also showed worsening renal function with creatinine on the day of transfer to the Regular Medicine Floor of 3.2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs on transfer revealed temperature maximum 98.7 F.; blood pressure 140/82; pulse 96; respiratory rate 20; oxygen saturation 98 on room air.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally; no rhonchi, rales or wheezes.
LABORATORY:  Pertinent laboratory on transfer was complete blood cell count which showed white blood cell count 7.2, hematocrit 30.6, platelets 146.
Coagulation profile showed PT 50.5, PTT 30.0, INR 1.6.
Serum chemistry demonstrated a sodium of 141, potassium 3.6, chloride 106, bicarbonate 17, BUN 33, creatinine up to 4.2.
Glucose 105.
Liver function tests showed ALT 3161, AST 446, LDH 321, alkaline phosphatase 52, amylase 97, total bilirubin 2.0, lipase 40.
HYPERTENSION / DEPRESSION, STATUS POST SUICIDE ATTEMPT WITH INGESTION OF TYLENOL P.M. TABLETS:  Her liver function tests were improving but renal function continued to decline.
She was followed by the Hepatology Service status post her overdose attempt and her liver function tests and serum tests of liver function including albumin and INR were followed serially.
After several days on the Medicine Floor, her INR stabilized and Hepatology Service signed off.
After transfer from the Intensive Care Unit, her serum chemistries were followed daily.
Initially, there was felt to be no need for acute hemodialysis; however, the patient's serum creatinine continued to climb to a peak value of 9.2.
She needs to have her serum chemistries checked at least every two days and the Renal Team will make the decision for hemodialysis based on her laboratory values.
Renal ultrasounds were performed which showed no evidence of an obstructive component to her renal failure.
Her liver function tests, amylase and lipase were followed serially.
At that time, an abdominal series x-rays were obtained which were without evidence of obstruction or perforation.
She also underwent an MRI of the abdomen which demonstrated no abnormality.
Again, liver function tests, amylase and lipase were checked and were not acutely elevated.
She underwent endoscopy by the GI Service which demonstrated evidence only of mild gastritis.
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION:  A routine chest x-ray to rule out any pulmonary infiltrate or evidence of fluid overload demonstrated an enlarged cardiac silhouette that was concerning for a new pericardial effusion.
The patient therefore underwent echocardiogram [**2127-12-5**].
Echocardiogram demonstrated a small circumferential pericardial effusion; there was no evidence of tamponade.
Follow-up echocardiogram on [**2127-12-20**], showed ejection fraction of greater than 60% and a small pericardial effusion which appeared smaller than her prior study.
Serial chest x-rays were negative for any evidence of infiltrate.
Blood cultures were also unrevealing.
As her hypertension improved with dialysis, the decision was made not to pursue a work-up for fibromuscular dysplasia.
As her blood pressure improved, Hydralazine was discontinued.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  As the patient was unable to maintain adequate oral intake in the setting of persistent nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, she was nutritionally repleted with total parenteral nutrition.
Her electrolytes were followed serially and were repleted as needed.
They will follow serial laboratory evaluations of her renal function as well as her electrolytes.
Neurofibromatosis #1.
She is to call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 52482**] for a follow-up appointment.
