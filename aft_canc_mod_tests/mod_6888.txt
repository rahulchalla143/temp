Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement Arterial line placement  History of Present Illness: History of Present Illness, in brief: 41-year-old male with past medical history of patent foramen ovale s/p closure, PE on lovenox, diastolic CHF, COPD, pulmonary hypertension, on home O2 at 4L NC (although patient states he was on room air prior to admission) initially presented to [**Hospital3 10377**] Hospital with 10/10 periumbilical pain associated with nausea, vomiting, worse in the right lower quadrant.
He developed atrial flutter after which he required both face mask and nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations above 90% and required cardioversion.
The patient immediately triggered on the floor with an SaO2 of 88% on 50% venti-face-mask and a temperature of 101.1.
He was given IV lasix 80mg, nebs, heparin drip continued, vancomycin and zosyn for HAP/VAP/aspiration PNA, blood and urine cultures obtained and MICU consulted and subsequent transfer initiated.
He had an A-line placed and a TTE with bubble study, which showed a septal occluder device in place without evidence of atrial septal defect of patent foramen ovale.
A PICC line was placed and a CTA was performed which showed possible chronic pulmonary emboli and patchy ground glass opacities and enlarged lymph nodes.
His sotalol was decreased to 40mg [**Hospital1 **], however, HR increased to 130s and he continued his 80mg [**Hospital1 **] dosing.

No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
He was continued on coumadin and aspirin with an INR goal of [**2-5**].
He may also warrant evaluation for lung transplantation in the future.
CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia.
