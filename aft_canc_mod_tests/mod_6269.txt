GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-5-5**], significant tricuspid regurgitation is no longer appreciated.
