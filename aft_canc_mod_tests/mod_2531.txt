On POD 1 he had new onset of afib and was rate controlled on diltiazem.
An ECHO was done - see results section.
POD 3 he was extubated and tube feeds were increased.
POD 4 he converted back to normal sinus rhythm.
POD 5 he had a negative swallow study and was transferred to the floor.
His post pull CXR was negative for ptx.
