During her [**Hospital3 **] course, her peak Trop=28.72, CK 647, MB 82.1.
Patient underwent ECHO on [**2105-3-23**] that demonstrated inferior ischemia, EF=40%.
On [**2105-3-24**] patient underwent dobutamine stress test that was stopped due to SOB and CP, decreased O2 sat to 85%, TWI in lead II and III.
She was started on nitro gtt and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
On transfer, patient's labs notable for Cr decreased to 1.3, glucose 245, WBC 12.6, Hct 34.3. .

Chest CT [**3-27**] demonstrates interstitial septal thickening and ground glass opacities in R lung c/w pulm edema vs pulm hemorrhage vs acute interstitial pna vs lymphegenic carcinomatosis, L hilar finding ?recurrent ca vs scar.
Patient was treated empirically for pna (sputum cx from [**3-27**] w/ MSSA and H.Flu) with broad spectrum abx (vanc, aztreonam) and was extubated on [**2105-3-31**].
On night of [**2105-4-5**] pt underwent respiratory arrest, causing code (7 minutes), and was intubated.
Urine legionella negative.
Bronch [**4-7**] BAL for cytology + for highly atypical cells, suspicious for sq cell carcinoma, remainder of micro negative (PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/Cx, AFB, fungal, legionella, nocardia).
Patient was evaluted for IP thoracentesis of R sided effusion to confirm malignant effusion.
Patient also underwent 14 day course abx with vanc, aztreonam, also transiently on bactrim empirically for PCP (micro negative from BAL).
CXR on admission demonstrates L hilar mass c/w recurrent lung ca vs adenopathy vs scar from radiation.
Chest CT as above - repeat Chest CT demonstrates diffuse consolidation, per pulm w/ BAL results, likely represents lymphagenic spread of ca, likely contributing/causing pt's respiratory issues.
Her UO continued to decrease and her Cr continued to rise.
# Cardiac: A. Ischemic:  Patient initially presented to OSH with CP, r/i for NSTEMI, started on heparin gtt, underwent dobutamine stress test and developed CP, SOB, TWI in inferior leads (II, III, avF), transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.
Cardiac cath on [**2105-3-25**], w/ 3x stent to RCA.
CK peak for NSTEMI was 647.
Pump:  Patient presented with clinical evidence of CHF, with bilateral crackles, LE edema, EF=40% per OSH ECHO.
Initially MUCH improved lung exam on IV lasix.
Recent ECHO showed no change in EF at 45%.
Pulse and blood pressure returned after being coded for >10 minutes.
Patient brought back to MICU, echo revealed increasing right-sided dysfunction, however, EKG not consistent with right heart strain.
Patient's creatinine >3, unable to tolerate chest CTA.
D. Pericardial rub:  pericardial rub appreciated on ascultation on [**3-29**] - cardiac enzymes sent that demonstrated no elevation.
EKG demonstrates diffuse ST elevation and PR depression c/w pericarditis.
ECHO demonstrates no pericardial effusion.
# Anemia:  Pt presented with Hct = 31.
hemolysis labs - WNL.
