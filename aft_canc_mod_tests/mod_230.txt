Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2135-7-18**], estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower and mitral regurgitation is now less prominent.

Patient was found to have bilateral pulmonary consolidations with sputum notable for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and klebisiella, therefore, vancomycin and meropenem were administered for treatment based upon susceptibility profiles.
* Pneumonia: As noted above, sputum culture returned MRSA and klebsiella, and patiented was started on a course of vancomycin/meropenem, to continue until [**2135-12-20**].
On hospital day 17, patient was noted to have a white count elevation to 60, which prompted an infectious workup, although patient had no clinical signs or symptoms of infection or fever.
CT scan revealed no abdominal pathology, however, patient was noted to have large pleural effusions bilaterally, right greater than left, consistent with patient's subjective complaints of dyspnea.
His baseline creatinine is 0.8.
Of note, patient's creatinine improved with further Lasix-mediated diuresis, and during the week prior to discharge patient was given Lasix 40-80mg IV with a goal of 500cc-1L out daily.
Indeed, LDH continued to trend downwards at the time of discharge (LDH 297).
* Aspiration/Nutrition:  Although patient initially failed a swallow study while in SICU, patient later did well on a second swallow study.
Patient was discharged with instructions to continue Lasix 80mg PO daily, with 20meq Potassium chloride supplementation daily, and hematocrit/Chem7 to be checked four days following discharge.
