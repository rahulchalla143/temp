EMS was called, found pt to have systolic blood pressure of 200, she was given nitro and lasix for presumed heart failure (although she has no documented history of CHF).
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her vitals were temp of 100.5, HR 81, BP 153/87, RR 22, 100% on nonrebreather, with desatting to the 70s on room air.
Labs were significant for normal chem 7, WBC 6, BNP of 1168 and negative Troponins.
EKG was unchanged from previous.
CXR showed cardiomegaly, and a density in the right lower lobe which was read as possible early infection vs. atelectasis.
She was given a dose of levofloxacin for community aquired pna and trasnfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
Past Medical History: -Poorly controlled DMII -hypertension -asthma -anemia - profound iron deficiency [**2-21**] gastric and duodenal AV malformations, transfusion dependent, Hct baseline around 22-29 -depression -migraines -obesity -chronic abdominal pain -delayed gastric emptying -diverticulosis -extensive DVT [**2-27**] s/p thrombectomy, IVC filter placement, common and external iliac vein stenting on coumadin/plavix -OSA, on BiPAP 20/16 -?
Meningioma (lesion identified by CT on [**6-27**] in left perimesencephalic region, being followed) -S/p appendectomy -S/p bilateral oophorectomy and hysterectomy -gout   Social History: Mrs. [**Known lastname 11468**] reports living by herself in [**Location (un) 686**], although her daughter lives nearby and she babysits for her grandaughter [**Name (NI) 12855**].
Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS: T= 96.2 BP= 157/77 HR=82 RR=22 O2=100% on NRB (15L) .
Na 139 K 4.0 Cl 103 HCO3 27 BUN 8 Cre 0.9 .
Trop-T: <0.01 CK: 158  MB: 6 .
PT: 23.4  PTT: 25.5  INR: 2.3 .
CXR: SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Examination is limited by breathing.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
<br>  [**2185-3-15**] 2:50 pm URINE     Site: CLEAN CATCH                              **FINAL REPORT [**2185-3-16**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2185-3-16**]):    <10,000 organisms/ml.
FINDINGS: The prior study is not available on the PACS at this time.
Of incidental note is evidence of previous [**Month/Day (2) 1106**] surgery on the left and an IVC filter.
On am of [**3-16**] - pt more stable from resp standpoint with 97% on RA, pt was transferred to floor, give 1 more dose of po lasix 20mg - feeling well am of [**3-17**] - ambulating without DOE, 92% on RA o2 sat, Echo showing evid of mild pulm HTN and dCHF without evid of sCHF.
Pt will be given CHF instruction, given a Rx for 20mg po lasix but to be taking only PRN - not on a scheduled dose for now - ***will need close f/u with her PCP in regards to this with focus now to keep BP controlled.
Dyspnea - more likely due to mild secondary pulmonary HTN with low thresholds for decompensation - here with mild PNA, bacterial (Community acquired) and CHF exacerbation - diastolic confirmed more by echo this stay -Failure supported by clincial history of worsening orthopnea and dyspnea with exertion as well as elevated BNP on admission, and elevated JVD and crackles on exam.
No previous diagnosis of heart failure but risk factors for CAD and stress in [**4-27**] showing mild inferior wall reversible perfusion abnormality and LVEF of 49%, as well as evidence of diastolic dysfunction on [**2182**] ECHO.
CXR with increased hilar fullness, as well as focal RLL opacity.
No evidence of ACS with no EKG changes, one negative set of cardiac biomarkers.
Given that patient is therapeutic on coumadin with IVC filter, PE is less likely.
-as above d/c with PRN lasix 20mg as needed based on daily wts (see d/c instructions) -ECHO noted -serial cardiac biomarkers x3 were negative to note.
Anemia, chronic blood loss - Patient w/ chronic anemia due to multiple oozing AVM's and chronically guaiac +.
Hct is near baseline range and low suspicion that cause of acute presentation - though my have small degree of contribution - as d/w in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] - plan will be to tranfuse for Hct<25.
-Hct at 26.0 at time of d/c -Continue PPI -Continue iron <br>  4.
DVT/Anticoagulation -Continue home plavix and coumadin -Low threshold for CTA given history -Daily INR -noted on plavix - ****question for PCP whether to continue this for long-term to be f/u as outpt - noted per pt/family "history of head clot in [**2-27**] - reason for plavix" - records reviewed - particularly neuro note in [**6-27**] - per re-review of imaging in [**2-27**] - felt lesion more -  meningioma in the left prepontine cistern.
-Continue Gabapentin at decreased dose while in respiratory distress -coot home dose oxycontin -L-S spine films done - NO FX -PT evaluation - pt ambulated well - no further services needed per assessment <br>  CODE STATUS: Full code EMERGENCY CONTACT: Daughter Dispo - d/c to home with close PCP f/u in [**1-21**] wks   Medications on Admission: ALBUTEROL SULFATE - 90 mcg HFA Aerosol Inhaler - 2 puffs q4 BUTALBITAL-ACETAMINOPHEN-CAFF [FIORICET] - 50 mg-325 mg-40 q6 CLOPIDOGREL - 75 mg qd CPAP 16 WITH 2 LITERS OXYGEN FLUTICASONE [FLONASE] - 50 mcg Spray, Suspension - 2 sprays [**Hospital1 **] FLUTICASONE [FLOVENT HFA] - 110 mcg/Actuation Aerosol - 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **] GABAPENTIN - 800 mg tid HYDROCORTISONE ACETATE [ANUSOL-HC] - 25 mg Suppository prn INSULIN GLARGINE [LANTUS] - 100 unit/mL Cartridge - 72 units at noon and at bedtime sq daily INSULIN LISPRO [HUMALOG] - 100 unit/mL Solution - according to sliding scale administer twice a day - No Substitution ISOSORBIDE MONONITRATE - 30 qd LISINOPRIL - 40 mg Tablet - qd METOCLOPRAMIDE - 10 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth four times a day before meals and at bedtime METOPROLOL SUCCINATE - 200 mg qd OXYCODONE [OXYCONTIN] - 15 mg Tablet SR [**Hospital1 **] OXYCODONE-ACETAMINOPHEN [PERCOCET] - 5 mg-325 mg Tablet q6prn PANTOPRAZOLE - 40 mg qd PROMETHAZINE-CODEINE [PHENERGAN-CODEINE] - 10 prn SIMVASTATIN - 40 mg qd TRAZODONE - 50 mg Tablet - qhs UREA [CARMOL 40] - 40 % Cream - apply to both feet [**Hospital1 **] WARFARIN [COUMADIN] - 5 mg Tablet - 1 [**1-21**] Tablet(s) by mouth on Mon, Wed, [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **].
