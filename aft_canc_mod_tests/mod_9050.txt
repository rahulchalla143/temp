Late that afternoon she began having tachycardia to 130s, hypertension, and tachypnea to a respiratory rate of 35.
It was decided at that point to get a CAT scan of the abdomen.
The CAT scan revealed a large fluid collection in the left side of the abdomen.
The fluid collection revealed 4+ gram-negative rods, gram-positive rods, gram-positive cocci, and yeast.
She spiked a temperature to 102.6 degrees.
On Intensive Care Unit day two, her hematocrit was 23.6 and she was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.
A Clostridium difficile at that point was negative.
A repeat CAT scan showed a large decrease in the fluid collection in the abdomen.
Her blood pressure and heart rate remained stable, and her urine output was adequate.
An earlier chest x-ray on Intensive Care Unit day three revealed an effusion on the left side.
A repeat chest x-ray on Intensive Care Unit day six revealed resolution of the effusion.
A repeat abdominal CAT scan on [**11-9**], which was Intensive Care Unit day six, again revealed reduction of the fluid collection in the abdomen.
On Intensive Care Unit day seven, a clear liquid diet was started, and her oxygen saturations were 99%.
On Intensive Care Unit day eight, her temperature was 98.6., and it was decided she could be transferred to the floor.
A urine culture and blood culture which were obtained revealed no growth.
Her drain fluid was sent for amylase and total bilirubin.
Amylase was 24,030.
The total bilirubin was 2.7.
On [**11-16**], an abdominal CT scan revealed the fluid collection had become larger in size.
On [**11-18**], a repeat CT scan was performed due to decreased output from the new drain which was placed.
This CT scan showed communication with the small bowel and the fluid collection.
On [**11-19**], the drain output improved due to proper flushing of the tube.
Prior to discharge the fluid from the drain was sent for Gram stain and culture which was to be followed up as an outpatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
