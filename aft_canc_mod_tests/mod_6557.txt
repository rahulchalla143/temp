He was brought to [**Hospital 6138**] Hospital, where a non-contrast CT-head showed 3.5x 4.2cm right parietooccipital mass.

IMAGING: -[**12-21**] CT Neck: 1.
Heterogeneous bulky appearance to the right side of the glottis and supraglottic region which needs evaluation with direct exmaination and MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 31186**] [**Last Name (un) 78953**] without and with contrast for better assessment of extension and exclude neoplasm in this location.
Correlation with ENT examination and MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 31186**] [**Last Name (un) 78953**] can be helpful to assess the extent  -[**12-17**] MRI Brain: 1.
The findings may represent a conglomerate of metastatic lymph nodes, but the appearance given the relationship to the pyriform sinus raises the possibility of a primary neoplasm of the head and neck.
Dedicated CT of the neck is recommended for further evaluation.
[**12-17**] CT Head: 1.
Segment of non-opacification within the right transverse sinus, consistent with likely chronic occlusion.
CT Torso [**12-10**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Lymph node, site not specified: Poorly differentiated non-small carcinoma.
Lymph node, site not specified: Poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.
Immunophenotyping: A limited panel was attempted to exclude a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, however was non-diagnostic due to insufficient numbers of B cells for analysis.
He was then taken to an OSH, where CT head imaging revealed a right sided parietal-occipital mass.
MRI of the head, as well as CT of the Torso were obtained which revealed significant, likely metastatic disease.
A Lymph node biopsy was obtained which revealed metastatic carcinoma.
Further differentiation was not able to be done from the biopsy.
He also had a cranioplasty with mesh as the bone was not able to be replaced due to the infiltration of the mass.
The patient went directly to CT scan from the OR and the scan showed no hemorrhage and confirmed resection of the supratentorial portion of the mass.
His neuro exam remained stable and he was ambulating without difficulty.
# Squamous cell Carcinoma: The patient's pathology revealed metastatic carcinoma with squamous cell differentiation.
CT scans and rhinoscopic visualization performed by ENT suggested that a soft [**Date Range 31186**] mass in the right neck was the primary cancer.
# Tumor lysis syndrome/[**Last Name (un) **]: Following his first cycle of chemotherapy, the patient developed signs of tumor lysis, including acute kidney injury, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia (in the setting of a high baseline uric acid level), and an LDH level that rose into the 5000s.
His creatinine rose from a baseline of 0.9 to 1.8.
He had excellent urine output during this time.
Urinalysis was sent, revealing hyaline casts.
His Hct stayed around 30 and his platelets around 40 - 60.
Then after having 3.5 liters of fluid (BP still in 60s), he developed resp distress.
The next AM he was mentating with BP in 60s, then throughout the day became more unresponsive.
ABG showed a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with an elevated lactate.
Lasix was given to help with his breathing, but had no effect despite large doses.
# Acute kidney injury: The patient initially presented with a creatinine of 1.1.
The day of [**2134-1-9**] the patient's creatinine was 3.1 (see above) and he appeared to be in ATN.
C. diff was negative x 2.
STAT head CT revealed a extracranial hematoma, and (likely chronic) pooling of CSF at the site of the surgery.
As the patient was thrombocytopenic to 60K that morning, he was transfused platelets, with a post-transfusion plt level of 89K.
C. Diff was negative x 2, and the patient was started on PRN imodium.
He has never had a colonoscopy, and outpatient screening colonoscopy was recommended.
# Cardiomyopathy/CHF - The patient was found to have an EF of 50-55% as seen on [**12-10**] TTE.
# Anemia - The patient maintained a Hct around 30.
Hct remained stable after BRBPR.
# Thrombocytopenia: The patient maintained platelet levels stably low ~60K.
Other coag studies were normal, including fibrinogen.
