While you were here stool cultures were sent to look for infection and they came back positive for c. dificile.
On the second night you were here, your blood pressure dropped and you were given lots of fluids.
This continued into the following day and as a result your blood pressures were doing better, but you started to have difficulty breathing.
A chest X-ray was done and it seemed that your lungs were filled with fluid.
You were doing better, your blood pressure was stable and so you were transferred back to the floor and eventually you were breathing well without the nasal cannula.
Speech and swallow evaluated you at the bedside as well as with a video swallow study and felt that there was not much change in your swallowing function.
