[**3-13**] CT head: One right and two left frontal hemorrhagic lesions with surrounding edema, concerning for metastasis.
These lesions were seen in the MRI of [**2192-3-12**], but new since the CT of [**2192-2-3**].
[**3-15**] MRI Brain- IMPRESSION: Previously noted enhancing lesions in the brain on the MRI of [**2182-3-12**] again identified for WAND study for surgical planning.
The patient had a Head CT which was consistent with multiple known hemorrhagic metastases in bifrontal lobes.
The goal systolic blood pressure was < 140.
The post operative Head Ct was consistent with expected post operative changes.
The goal was to keep the patient platlets > 80 for 24 hours post surgery.
A blood sample was sent to the lab and the patient was found to be HEPARIN DEPENDENT ANTIBODIES   Positive.
A CXR was performed in the afternoon which was consistent with left upper lobe consolidation which had improved.
The platlets were 67 and the patient was transfused with 1 pack of platlets and post transfusion platlet count was 136.
The systolic blood pressure goal was < 160.
On [**3-17**], The patient's hematocrit was 21.7 from 27 the day prior and 2 units of Packed Red Blood Cells were administered with 10 mg IV lasix to avoid fluid volume overload.
The serum potassium level was 3.8 and was repleated with 20 meq KCL.
The post transfusion hematocrit was 31.3.
The evening platlet count was 37.
Patient was kept comfortable and he passed with family at the bedside on [**2192-3-23**] at 23:30   Medications on Admission: dexamethasone 4mg [**Hospital1 **] famotidine 20mg [**Hospital1 **] advair keppra 750 [**Hospital1 **] oxycodone (not really using) TMP-SMX acetaminophen prn  Discharge Medications: Expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: NSCLCA with mets to brain Hematuria Thrombocytopenia Hemoptysis COPD   Discharge Condition: Expired on [**2192-3-23**] at 23:30   Discharge Instructions: Expired  Followup Instructions: N/A    Completed by:[**2192-3-23**
