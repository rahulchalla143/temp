Congestive heart failure (mild ischemic) with ejection fraction of 15 to 20%, non ST elevation myocardial infarction in [**9-26**] Adenosine MIBI revealed global hypokinesis and large distal/anterior/anteroseptal/apical/inferolateral defects, which were not reversible.
[**2166-11-5**] echocardiogram revealed anteroseptal/apical/anterolateral akinesis with an ejection fraction of 15 to 20%, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation (no significant change from [**2166-8-25**] echocardiogram).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.9.
Pulse 55.
Blood pressure 130/64.

Chest x-ray [**11-14**] at [**Hospital1 **] consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram [**11-14**] at [**Hospital1 **] revealed normal sinus rhythm with lateral T wave inversions, which were unchanged from prior electrocardiograms.
On [**2166-11-19**] the patient underwent total vaginal hysterectomy, anterior and posterior colporrhaphy, sacrospinous colpopexy, and SPARC with cystoscopy for stage 4 pelvic organ prolapse (procidentia) and urinary incontinence.

Her electrocardiogram was unchanged.
A set of cardiac enzymes were negative.
Her postoperative hematocrit was 26.9 as she received one unit of packed red blood cells with a post transfusion hematocrit of 33.
