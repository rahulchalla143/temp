His Hct=37, HR=79, BP=128/56.
Work up for pre-syncope included Head CT, echo, MRI/MRA of neck (see results below).
On HD #2, the patient started passing multiple dark stools and Hct dropped to 25 range.
EGD [**2192-10-6**] was normal.
Colonoscopy [**2192-10-6**] showed dark blood in cecum (prep was suboptimal) but no clear source was identified.
Tagged RBCs scan [**2192-10-6**] and showed focus in the region of hepatic fx c/w acute GI bleed.
Patient continued to have small amounts of bleeding but Hct remained stable in 26-27 range.
BP 144/58.
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Nasogastric tube passes to the distal esophagus loops and turns upwards passing back into the neck and out of view.
Impression: Normal EGD to second part of the duodenum *************** Colonoscopy [**2192-10-15**] Impression: Polyp in the distal sigmoid colon at 15 cm Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Polyp in the cecum near the appendiceal orifice Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Follow-up biopsy results, repeat colonoscopy in 3 yr if adenoma High fiber diet The above findings do not account for the anemia and GIB ************* Video Capsule Study [**2192-10-17**] Findings: 1.
Capsule reached colon Recommend: Push enteroscopy to cauterize angioectasias in small bowel (if continues to bleed) *************  [**2192-10-19**] 06:55AM BLOOD WBC-9.1 RBC-3.02* Hgb-10.1* Hct-29.0* MCV-96 MCH-33.3* MCHC-34.6 RDW-14.0 Plt Ct-211 [**2192-10-18**] 09:00PM BLOOD Hct-29.4* [**2192-10-18**] 05:40PM BLOOD Hct-30.6* [**2192-10-18**] 06:05AM BLOOD WBC-7.3 RBC-2.89* Hgb-9.6* Hct-27.6* MCV-96 MCH-33.1* MCHC-34.6 RDW-14.3 Plt Ct-196 [**2192-10-19**] 06:55AM BLOOD Plt Ct-211 [**2192-10-17**] 04:50AM BLOOD PT-13.5* PTT-30.9 INR(PT)-1.2 [**2192-10-19**] 06:55AM BLOOD Glucose-116* UreaN-10 Creat-1.0 Na-139 K-3.5 Cl-106 HCO3-25 AnGap-12 [**2192-10-19**] 06:55AM BLOOD Calcium-7.8* Phos-2.9 Mg-1.4*  Brief Hospital Course: #.
Per tagged RBC and colonoscopy from OSH patient with bleed, likely coming from right colon in the region of the hepatic flexure.
EGD/Colonoscopy at [**Hospital1 18**] showed some non-bleeding polyps without any source of bleeding.
Capsule study showed nonbleeding angioectasias.
Recieved PRBC's for HCT less than 25.
Patient will need colonoscopy follow up in 3 yrs for his colonic adenoma.
Please see your Primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**12-11**] weeks for further assessment and consider restarting Plavix.
If you have any further drop in your red blood cell count or any more gastrointestinal bleed, we will consider doing a push enteroscopy.
If you have any further drop in your red blood cell count or further lower gastrointestinal bleed, we might have to do a enteroscopy.
