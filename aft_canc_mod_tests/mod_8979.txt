Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2126-1-20**]):       GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
IMAGING:  Radiology Report CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2126-1-17**] 5:56 PM Final Report INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with fever and hypotension.
TECHNIQUE: Pre- and post-contrast axial images were obtained through the chest.
Multiplanar reformatted images were generated.
CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified, and there is no pulmonary embolus.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient has undergone prior right colectomy.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2126-1-17**] 12:06 AM  Final Report INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male status post fall.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the cervical spine.
Grade 1 anterolisthesis of C5 on C6, age indeterminate without prior study available for comparison.
If there is clinical concern and no contraindication, MRI may be obtained for further evaluation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2115-10-7**], no definite change.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
Cardiac etiology of hypotension less likely as patient ruled out for MI, and no signs of CHF, however at age [**Age over 90 **] could have AS and vasodilation in the setting of fever/pain could cause hypotension so echocardiogram was done (no AS, see above).
His blood cultures eventually revealed fusobacterium, and suspected source was necrosis within liver mass.
Infectious workup was completed as above.
# Liver Lesions: Identified on CT scan and confirmed on MRI, concerning for metestatic disease.
Tumor markers revealed normal AFP and CEA.
Lipid panel was drawn and LDL was at goal so statin not started.
Release 12 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
We did blood cultures, which showed a bloodstream infection.
