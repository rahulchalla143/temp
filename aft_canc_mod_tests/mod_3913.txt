He had a colonoscopy recently and was found to have villous adenoma.
Laparoscopic surgery was planned with no future date, but due to frequent episodes of angina, cardiac workup was done.
His ETT was positive on [**2128-7-15**] that showed myocardial ischemia and an ejection fraction of 59 percent with areas of reversibility.
Carotid ultrasound was also done on [**2128-7-20**] preoperatively, which revealed a 40 to 60 percent stenosis in the right internal carotid artery and a patent left internal carotid artery with increased velocities in the distal common carotid and bifurcation, but the ICA was nonstenosing.
Monitors his blood pressure frequently and reports mild edema to both ankles.
LABORATORY DATA:  Preoperative lab work from [**7-23**] is as follows:  Sodium 140, potassium 4.5, chloride 102, CO2 29, BUN 24, creatinine 0.9, white count 6.9, hematocrit 42.8, platelet count 196,000, and INR 1.03.
Hi[**Last Name (STitle) **]iac catheterization was performed on [**2128-7-29**] prior to his operation, which revealed severe left main disease with 70 percent distal stenosis, calcified LAD with a multiple 90 percent lesions, and a 95 percent lesion in the large first diagonal.
The circumflex had a 90 percent ostial stenosis, and the RCA had 80 to 90 percent stenosis.
His ejection fraction was approximately 65 percent in his right dominant system.
His heart rate was 56 and in sinus rhythm, saturating 96 percent on room air with blood pressure of 186/65.
He had no varicosities in his leg and had 2 plus DP and PT pulses bilaterally, 1 plus carotid pulses bilaterally, 2 plus radial pulses bilaterally, and 1 plus femoral pulses bilaterally.
Labs prior to operation were as follows:  Sodium 136, potassium 4.4, chloride 102, CO2 25, BUN 19, creatinine 0.7 with a blood sugar of 202.
White count 6.0, hematocrit 39.1, platelet count 190,000, PT 13.3, PTT 29.9 with an INR of 1.2, ALT 17, AST 16, alkaline phosphatase 82, amylase 47, total bilirubin 0.9, albumin 4.2, and calcium 8.5.
He was in sinus rhythm at 74 with a blood pressure of 135/53 and was hemodynamically stable.
Postoperatively, his white count was 11.8 with a hematocrit of 31.8 and a platelet count of 158,000, and potassium of 4.6, BUN of 19, and creatinine of 0.8.
He began incentive spirometer, chest PT, and was out of bed to the chair.
His creatinine, his potassium, BUN, and creatinine all were stable.
His exam was relatively unchanged.
He continued with his Lopressor, beta-blockade, was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 28.8 and finished his perioperative vancomycin.
His JP drain from his leg was pulled as were his chest tubes.
The heart rate was 68.
His hematocrit was slightly after transfusion at 31.2, his BUN and creatinine remained stable.
His blood pressure was continuously stable.
His hematocrit rose to 35.9 with a white count of 9.3, platelet count of 229,000.
His creatinine remained stable at 1.0 with a potassium of 4.4.
His exam was unremarkable.
There was no exam recorded in the chart at this time from his physical exam on the day of discharge.
He was instructed to follow up with his cardiologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1295**] in 1 to 2 weeks and to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], his surgeon, in approximately 3 to 4 weeks and was given the phone number for making the appointment.
