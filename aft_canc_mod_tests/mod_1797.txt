Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably mildly to moderately depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-3-17**], LV systolic function appears more vigourous (in the setting of increased tachycardia and more pressor support).
CXR [**2191-3-17**] As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new left internal jugular vein catheter.
The tip of the tube projects 3.8 cm above the carina, the tube could be advanced by approximately 1 cm.
Echo was obtained to assess heart function, which showed global hypokinesis with LVEF of 25%.
