On arrival to [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital, he was afebrile, BP 122/82, HR 75 and RR 20.
CT scan showed new left sided parieto-occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation on [**2137-8-17**].

Large left parietal hematoma as visualized on the CT scan with surrounding edema.
-------------- CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2137-8-18**]: Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema in the left parietal lobe.
-------------- CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-8-21**]: No obvious consolidating pulmonary infiltrates are identified.
-------------- MRI HEAD WITH CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2137-8-21**]: No significant interval change in the size of a large intraparenchymal hematoma in the left parietal and occipital lobes.
There is peripheral enhancement of this hematoma which raises the suspicion of an underlying neoplastic process -------------- CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2137-8-22**]: No significant interval change in a large intraparenchymal hematoma in the left occipital lobe when compared to [**2137-8-20**].
-------------- CHEST (LAT DECUB ONLY)  [**2137-8-22**]: Freely layering moderate right pleural effusion.
------------- CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2137-8-23**]: Findings suggestive of aggressive local recurrence of hepatocellular cancer with invasion through the diaphragm, into the IVC and right atrium, as well as additional masses within the left hepatic lobe, innumerable pulmonary metastases, and large, probably metastatic mass to the right psoas muscle.
Non contrast head CT demonstrated a left parietal hemorrhage with moderate edema.
A successful MRI/MRA was obtained on [**2137-8-21**] under conscious sedation and demonstrated an enhancement pattern suspicious for neoplastic disease.
Urinalysis on [**2137-8-20**] was suspicious for early urinary tract infection and the patient was treated with levofloxacin.
Multiple head CT demonstrated no change in the size of the hematoma.
Systolic blood pressure was tightly maintained below 140 with captopril, metoprolol, and hydralazine.
CT of the abdomen with and without contrast on [**2137-8-23**] revealed findings suggestive of aggressive local recurrence of hepatocellular cancer with invasion through the diaphragm, into the IVC and right atrium, as well as additional masses within the left hepatic lobe, innumerable pulmonary metastases, and large, probably metastatic mass to the right psoas muscle.
