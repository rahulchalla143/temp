Initial vitals showed HR 138 and SBP > 200.
EKG was reported to have peaked T waves V1-V4 as well as ?
Cards fellow thought T waves rate related and did bedside ECHO with normal EF but hypokinesis in LAD distribution.
SBP fell to 80s with propofol and intubation so pt received a 600cc bolus.
ETT pulled back from 25 to 23 in ED.
At time of transfer to CCU pt had put out 150cc urine and had vitals showing HR 77, BP 125/73, O2 Sat 100% on CMV TV 500, RR 20, PEEP 5, FiO2 100%.
Gas showed 7.32 / 52 / 100 / 28 with PaO2/FiO2 100 but question that this gas was drawn at same time as being intubated and without full effect of vent as repeat gas on vent settings CMV TV 500, PEEP 5, RR 14, FiO2 100% showed 7.42 / 44 / 392 / 30. .

Initial ABG in ED was likely falsely hypoxic as obtained at parallel time with intubation and repeat gas 90min later with no sig change in vent settings much improved an no longer with PaO2/FiO2 consistent with ARDS.
CT read confirms that lung findings most likely due to severe pulmonary edema.
Bedside ECHO in ER showed some question of hypokinesis in LAD distribution consistent with CAD but EKG without signs of active ischemia and biomarkers negative x 2.
No need for cardiac catheterization as did not appear that presentation due to acute ischemic event.
CXR showed signs of acute pulm edema likely related to hypertension.
Pt had significantly elevated pressures on presentation with Sys BP >200 but came down to 130s with lasix, nitro paste, and intubation/sedation.
Her nifedipine was intitially held and the next day she was started on lisinopril and carvedilol and nifedipine stopped.
# Breast Ca: Patient has known mets to both skull bones and lungs although documentation of lung mets not noted in our imaging as no chest imaging present.
Head CT showed no evidence of intra-cranial bleed or intra-cranial mets.
Her outpatient Fluoxymesterone was non-formulary and unavailable and was not given this hospitalization.
Was on Fragmin as outpt via study protocol at [**Company 2860**] and has completed a 12 month course.
She was initially on heparin drip which was stopped when CTA showed no evidence of PE.
