Bilateral LE dopplers were performed and showed a DVT in the right common femoral to the calf veins.
A Heparin gtt was started and the patient was admitted for further management.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T - 97.5, BP - 120/64, HR - 82, RR - 18, O2 - 96% RA Gen: Awake, alert, NAD HEENT: NC/AT; PERRLA, EOMI, OP clear, nonerythematous, MMM Neck: Supple, No LAD, JVP flat sitting upright Chest: CTAB Cardiac: S1, S2, no m/r/g appreciated ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS Rectal: brown stool, guaiac positive.
A duplex ultrasound was performed in the ED and he was found to have a right femoral vein DVT that extended to his popliteal vein.
The heparin goal was a PTT 60-80.
At that time he was tachycardic to 130's but continued to maintain his blood pressure around 130 systolic.
His HCT on [**2122-1-12**] was 29.7 On the morning of [**2122-1-13**] as 26.6.
Hypercoaguable workup so far has showed increased B2 microglobulin which is nonspecific and frequently elevated in patient's with chronic renal insufficiency.
Also increased Thrombin time which is expected given heparin anticoagulation.
Futher work-up was sent off and pending at time of discharge.
His protein C level was elevated while protein S was within the normal range.
Beta-2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies (IGA, IGM, IGG) and factor V leiden were pending at time of discharge.
The patient was started on Coumadin on and his levels were carefully monitored given the potential interaction with his transplantation medications.
He was discharged when his INR was therapeutic.
A colonoscopy completed in [**2119**] showed a nonbleeding polyp/adenoma.
His hematocrit was noted to be down from 40 in [**Month (only) 216**], but had been as low as 31 prior.
Upper and lower endoscopy on [**2122-1-8**] demonstrated an EG juntion ulcer which was biopsied, as well as three non-bleeding polyps in colon that were removed.
A repeat colonoscopy was completed on [**2122-1-16**] which demonstrated no sources of bleeding.
He had no further episodes of bleeding and his HCT remained stable.
The biopsy obtained was positive for H. Pylori, for which treatment was initiated.
An US study of the graft showed good flow, normal functioning kidney.
To ensure that he did not have a pulmonary embolus that was contributing to the tachycardia, a V/Q scan was completed which was normal.
Glucose intolerance: Patient's blood glucose finger sticks trended back down to the normal range after his prednisone taper was completed.
His Hb A1c was checked and found to be 6.7.
FEN/Propylaxis/Access: Patient's electrolytes were monitored carefully and treated as needed.
Discharge: Patient was ambulating without difficulty or pain and his INR was therapeutic at time of discharge.
He was instructed to follow up with his primary care physician for both an appointment as well as an INR check, to which he expressed good understanding.
These interventions were done so that the thrombosis would not move to your lung.
You also underwent a colonoscopy and experienced some bleeding which resolved.
You will also need to have your Coumadin level followed very closely to ensure your blood levels are correct.
Please arrange to have your level checked during week of discharge through Dr. [**Initials (NamePattern4) 6259**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6260**] prescription for this will be given to you at time of discharge.
