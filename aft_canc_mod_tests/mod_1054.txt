An MRI done at an outside hospital on [**2153-10-11**], reportedly showed four enhancing lesions (lesion #1 is the largest lesion, measuring approximately 14 mm X 14 mm X 8.0 mm in the left thalamic region with surrounding edema extending to the left mid brain with compression.)
At that time the patient had no pulmonary complaints, but a chest x-ray on [**10-11**], demonstrated a right upper lobe lesion with a question of mediastinal adenopathy and a chest CT scan performed the next day revealed a 3.7 cm X 2.4 cm right upper lobe mass with right hilar, precarinal lymphadenopathy.
An initial bronchoscopy was unsuccessful.
On repeat bronchoscopy, there are clusters of atypical glandular cells, suspicious for adenocarcinoma.
A chest CT scan demonstrated a right upper lobe mass, but no mediastinal lymphadenopathy and low attenuation lesions of the liver, suspicious for primary lung carcinoma.
CT scan guided biopsy of the chest lesion was performed at [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2153-12-18**].
At the time of admission, pathology was still pending.
The patient and her husband, who witnessed the seizure, denied any urinary or bowel incontinence.
The patient was taken to the Emergency Department where she went for a head CT scan to evaluate.
She apparently had a second seizure while in the CT scan room.
After the head was examined, she was reported to be somnolent with a respiratory rate ranging from 8 to 12 breaths per minute.
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, her blood pressure responded to intravenous fluid resuscitation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.6 F, blood pressure 124/70, heart rate 82 and regular, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute.
The examination was limited due to lack of cooperation on the patient's part.
It was impossible to perform a thorough motor / sensory examination secondary to patient's inability to follow commands.
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ and symmetric.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values on [**12-19**] were notable for a white count of 9.1 with 89% neutrophils and 7% lymphocytes, hematocrit 38.9%.
PT 12.3, PTT 27.
Sodium 137, potassium 3.7, chloride 101, bicarbonate 24, BUN 11, creatinine 0.7, glucose 151.
ALT 15, AST 19, alkaline phosphatase 81, albumin 4.0, amylase 43, total bilirubin 0.4, lipase 37.
Laboratory values on [**12-20**] were notable for a white count of 5.6, hematocrit 35.6, platelets 220,000.
Sodium 137, potassium 3.7, chloride 101, bicarbonate 25, BUN 11, creatinine 0.7, glucose 151.
The head without contrast on [**12-19**] demonstrated a 13 mm X 18 mm mass with high attenuation in the left frontal lobe with associated edema, extending to the cerebral peduncle.
Pathology per the lung biopsy came back positive for a non-small cell adenocarcinoma.
Her neurological examination at the time of discharge was notable for:  alert and oriented to person, place, and time with good naming and short-term and long-term memory.
Her examination was grossly normal.
Hemodynamically her blood pressure remained stable throughout her admission on the OMED service.
