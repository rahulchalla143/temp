Since the patient thought his oral iron therapy might be contributing this blackened stools, approximately two weeks prior to this admission he stopped taking oral iron that had been prescribed for his chronic iron deficiency anemia.
Upon admission to the Emergency Room, his vital signs were blood pressure 80/33, heart rate 120, respiratory rate 14.
He received four units of packed red blood cells in the ER since his hematocrit was found to be 10.
ABG showed PH 7.52, PO2 106, PCO2 28.
The ABGs draw site blood for 15 minutes despite pressure, his coags were PTT 150, PT 100, INR 69.
Lower extremity dopplers did not show evidence of DVT or evidence of intravascular bleed.
Abdominal and pelvis CT showed no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed, no evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid.
3) Celiac sprue, anti-endomesial antibody titer was 1:8 in [**2142-12-31**].
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for fatigue, dizziness, recent weight loss, negative for nitrites or diplopia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 99.2, blood pressure 100/58, pulse 72, respirations 18, sats 90% on room air.
Cardiovascular, S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Pulmonary clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Strength, [**4-3**] in upper and lower extremities.
Reflexes 2+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8.4, hematocrit 29.8, MCV 86, reticulocyte count 2.1, platelet count 175,000.
GI:  The patient had EGD and colonoscopy which found no source of bleed.
Cold forceps biopsy was performed for histology.
It seems likely that his elevated INR was likely secondary to Vitamin K deficiency which was secondary to his celiac disease.
Anti parietal antibodies were sent for ruling out pernicious anemia.
Additionally, Vitamin B12 and Folate levels were pending at the time of discharge.
Doppler examination and MRI of the left lower extremity showed no signs of DVT.
