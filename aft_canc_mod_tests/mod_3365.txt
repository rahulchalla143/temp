He was recently hospitalized on [**8-18**] with nausea/vomitting fever found to have a pneumonia s/p treatment but also with lung/liver masses, s/p lung biopsy and referred to oncology and offered systemic chemotherapy in [**8-18**].
Last evening, noted increasing hemoptysis, [**6-17**] teaspoons, with blood clots, and presented to the ED.
[**8-18**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with n/v A CAT scan of the torso on admission revealed the right lower lung mass now measuring 4.4 x 2.7 cm with extension to the right lower lobe bronchus, multiple surrounding satellite nodules and a right hilar lymphadenopathy.
RLL Biopsy revealed non-small-cell carcinoma consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin 7 and CK 20 are positive, TTF-1 is negative.
Progression of disease with massive right sided lung masses, including large 9 x 5 cm mass with endobronchial component involving the RLL and RML bronchi, which may contribute to pt's hemoptysis.
ECG Study Date of [**2160-2-4**]  8:30:20 AM Sinus rhythm.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2160-2-7**] 3:25 PM The multiple pulmonary masses of the right lung including the right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe appear relatively unchanged.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2160-2-8**] 1:33 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with earlier study of this date, the patient has taken a much better inspiration, which has resulted in some decrease in opacification of the right base.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2160-2-8**] 1:55 AM CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: CTA: There is no evidence of a pulmonary embolism in the main or the segmental pulmonary arteries.
The evaluation of subsegmental branches is limited due to collapse-consolidation as well as extensive tumor involvement of the right lower lobe.
Right superior paratracheal loculations of air are unchanged since [**2159-8-14**], probably tracheal diverticuli.
There are multiple hepatic metastases which appear more cystic and larger when compared to the prior examination, and this may be related to treatment effect.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2160-2-8**] 12:09 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-7**], there is increasing opacification at the right base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2160-2-11**] 8:31 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-8**], there is some increasing opacification at the right base that could represent atelectatic or change distal to one of the numerous metastatic nodules.
BONE SCAN  [**2160-2-13**] INTERPRETATION: Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior projections demonstrate increased uptake within the T10 vertebral body, slightly more than on [**2159-8-14**] corresponding to lytic metastasis on CT.
