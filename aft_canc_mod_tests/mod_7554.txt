Since the previous tracing of [**2138-12-16**] sinus tachycardia is now present and QRS voltage is less prominent.
Renal US ([**2139-1-27**]): No hydronephrosis.
CXR ([**2139-1-19**]): No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
CXR ([**2139-1-24**]): Pending  CXR ([**2139-1-25**]): In comparison with the study of [**1-19**], respiratory motion somewhat degrades the image.
CXR ([**2139-1-27**]): Left lung is clear.
Incidental note is made of possible acute fracture of the left eighth rib more obvious on the chest radiograph from [**1-25**], and distortion of the right seventh rib posterolaterally that looks more like a healed fracture.
CXR ([**2139-1-27**]): NG appropriately placed.
An asymmetric area of alveolar consolidation in the right infrahilar region.
CXR [**2-17**]-FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.
This was felt to be flash pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension with BPs 220s/130s.
He was initially placed on nitro gtt for BP control.
Focal exam deficits included impairment of downward gaze, right facial droop, right arm and leg weakness.
MRI with contrast was concerning for metastatic lymphoma.
Toxic/Metabolic work-up was negative.
CNS Lymphoma - After the MRI with contrast raised concern for metastatic lymphoma, a follow-up LP was performed.
Shingles - On [**1-22**], Dr. [**Known lastname **] developed a rash in the right C3-C5 distribution ending midline.
He was continued on vancomycin until....  UTI - Initial urine culture showed mixed flora, and UA was negative.
Dr. [**Known lastname **] developed fevers during admission and repeat urine studies revealed E. Coli (>100,000 colonies, pan-sensitive except to Bactrim) and Enterococcus (10,000-100,000 colonies).
They also recommended considering abdominal CT to further evaluate the kidneys if renal ultrasound was unrevealing......  Bacteremia / Fevers - Blood culture [**1-25**] grew gram-negative rods, pan-sensitive.
CXR was performed but did not show evidence of an acute lung process.
CK was WNL and Troponin 0.08 in setting of renal failure.
The episodes appeared to resolve once Keppra was on board......  Rib Fracture - CXR did show what appeared to be an acute rib fracture of the 8th rib and an older fracture of the 7th rib.
