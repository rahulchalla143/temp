Repeat labs 3 hours later required transfusion with blood products.
There was concern for poor liver function; ABD ultrasound on POD1 showed "Patent transplant hepatic vessels.
LFT's trended down, and coagulation studies were only moderately abnormal.
An US on POD3 showed patent vessels.
Drain output became less bilious.
He had increased drainage from his incision on POD7 ([**6-14**]); CT scan was unremarkable with no changes.
On [**6-16**], an ostomy appliance was applied around the wound to help control drainage due to ascitic leak.
On [**6-19**], a hepatic arteriogram demonstrated mild narrowing at the hepatic artery anastomosis with interval improvement since the last study, however the portal vein could not be visulaized.
The following day, an ultrasound demonstrated abnormal arterial, hepatic venous and portal flows, essentially unchanged, however the proximal portal vein was not clearly appreciated.
His ascitic output was replaced with albumin.
On [**6-21**], a CTA demonstrated a thrombosis of the donor portal vein extending to the iliac vein anastomosis.
He was immediately taken back to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy, portal vein thrombectomy, portal venous revision with Hemashield patch angioplasty, and excision of common bile duct and liver biopsy (subsequently showing subfulminant hepatic necrosis).
He was transferred to the SICU intubated and sedated with an open abdomen and on a heparin drip with a goal PTT greater than 50.
HIs bilirubin was 7.8.
He had an NG tube, 2 JPs, and a biliary drain and he was on Vancomycin and Zosyn.
An Angio  was done to assess for residual clot in the PV.
The following day, he was taken to IR again and an angiogram demonstrated sluggish right main portal vein flow with multiple filling defects suggestive of thrombosis, which contributed to inability to pass the guidewire into central location.
An ultrasoud showed persistent nonocclusive thrombus in the portal vein.
A portogram demonstrated two areas of nonocclusive thrombus (SMV/iliac anastomosis and at the right/left bifurcation) as well as multiple narrow areas of possible stenosis, most significant at the SMV/iliac graft anastomosis.
An angiojet thrombectomy and TPA infusion were performed within the portal system.
A follow-up angiogram showed improving but persistent nonocclusive thrombus in the portal vein.
Albumin was given to repalce his drain output.
On POD 3, bilirubin was 15.
Urine output was adequate.
Drains outputs were 975cc and 1500cc of ascitic fluid.
An ultrasound demonstrated a non-occlusive intraluminal filling defect in the main portal vein with likely thrombus in the vicinity of the anastomosis.
An angiogram demonstrated no significant interval change in the size of the nonocclusive thrombi and TPA was continued.
Bilirubin was 12.
A portal venogram demonstrated no change and the TPA catheter was discontinued.
On POD 1 he spiked a fever to 101 and was pan-cultured, but these cultures were negative.
Urine output was adequate.
An ultrasound showed unchanged portal venous velocities.
A CT of his head was negative.
On POD 4, Caspofungin was switched to Fluconazole and cholangiogram was normal.
Bilirubin was 10.
On POD 5, he was more alert but still confused.
Bilirubin was 9.
He remained on Prograf 3mg [**Hospital1 **], Cellcept and Prednisone taper.
An ekg was wnl and IV hydration was given.
He required FFP for supratherapeutic inr of 5.7 on [**7-6**].
INR was then 2.3.
HARRT (Abacavir, tenofovir, & Kaletra) was resumed on [**7-8**] when HIV VL was 1450.
Prior level was <50 on [**6-30**].
Doses were based on elevated creatinine 1.4.
Azithromycin was started for CD4 count less than 50 for MAC prophylaxis.
Prograf continued to be held until levels were <10.
On [**7-14**] FK level was 9.0.
On [**7-12**] an U/S of the liver was done to assess flow and the portal vein.
INR was 2.2.
BP ranged between 101/76 to 118/86, HR 83-100, RR 18-22.
Wt was 72.5 kg.
Lancets 1 box-qid accuchecks refill: 2 18.
