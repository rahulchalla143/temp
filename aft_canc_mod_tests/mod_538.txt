In the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], she was found to have elevated cardiac biomarkers (troponin I of 4.8) and elevated BNP (1900), with ECG showing inferolateral TWI.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.9 HR 86 BP 168/98 RR 17 SaO2 98% on RA.
She was treated with heparin and had a CXR showing right pleural effusion and diffuse interstitial markings.
Labs were significant for Trop T 1.04 and flat CKs.
She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] Cardiology service for further managment.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
FINDINGS: There is a moderate right pleural effusion as visualized on the prior CT from [**2180-2-14**].
Evaluation of the interlobar artery is limited secondary to respiratory artifact.
Evaluation of the interlobar arteries is very limited secondary to respiratory artifact.
The study is limited secondary to respiratory artifact.
Moderate right pleural effusion as visualized on the CT from [**2180-2-14**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-22**], there is continued prominence of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of bilateral pleural effusions and compressive basilar atelectasis.
She was continued on Plavix and her cardiac enzymes were cycled.
She was on heparin and underwent cardiac cath on [**2-14**] which revealed severe left and right sided diastolic dysfunction with severe pulmonary hypertension.
Her LVEF was 30%.
Renal was consulted and a renal ultrasound was done revealing no renal artery stenosis.
it was determined that her blood pressure needed to be >140 to perfuse her kidney's.
Her urine output improved and her creatinine recovered over time.
