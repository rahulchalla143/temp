Cross-sectional imaging revealed an extremely large approximately 16-cm retroperitoneal mass involving the inferior aspect of the left kidney and contiguous with the inferior psoas muscle.
A core needle biopsy had been performed showing a spindle cell tumor with a high mitotic rate.
After a complete immunohistochemical analysis, the patient was now thought consistent with a pleomorphic myogenic sarcoma which was high-grade.
He subsequently underwent a repeat CT scan which suggested that the mass was largely unchanged but potentially increased somewhat in size.
His hematocrit had remained stable at approximately 29 to 30.
Preoperative radiotherapy was considered but in light of the patient's extreme symptoms and what appeared to be a rapidly deteriorating clinical status, it was felt to proceed with a ressection at this time which the patient freely consented to procedure.

Of note the hematocrit was stable and there were no further signs of hypovolemia.
The urine output was monitored closely with a foley catheter in place.
The blood glucose were monitored closely and he received insulin appropriately.
The patient had adequate urine output and foley catheter was discontinued and he voided without difficulty.
A renal ultrasound was obtained to assess for any potential hydronephrosis indicative of potential ischemic injury to the ureter.
The patient continued to progress well and at time of discharge, had adequate pain control, was afebrile, vital signs were stable,was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating and voiding without assistance.The transverse abdominal incision with staples was intact without any erythema or ecchymosis.
Please continue to monitor your blood sugars closely.
