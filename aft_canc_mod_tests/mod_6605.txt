History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) **] is a 47 y/o man with a PMH of GBM s/p resection, radiation, ongoing chemo (with Avastin and carboplatin; last cycle this past tuesday), and seizures who presents after a prolonged seizure this morning.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: (1) a stereotaxic brain biopsy by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.
on [**2135-6-22**], (3) received involved-field cranial irradiation with temozolomide to [**2135-7-11**] to [**2135-8-22**], (4) started Nuvigil on [**2135-7-12**] and stopped on [**2135-9-5**], (5) s/p 2 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide at 200 mg/m2/day x 5 days since [**2135-9-24**], (6) s/p 2 cycle of XL-184, which was started on [**2135-11-25**], (7) s/p hospitalization from [**2136-1-20**] to [**2136-1-22**] after a seizure causing non-fluent aphasia, (8) had 3 cycles of bevacizumab (5 mg/kg on [**2136-2-28**] and 10 mg/kg on [**2136-3-13**] in cycle 1, 10 mg/kg in cycle 2, 15 mg/kg in cycle 3, and 12.5 mg/kg in cycle 4), (9) had adverse abdominal reaction (pain and inability to tolerate food) with Etoposide which he last received approximately 10 days ago ([**2136-6-24**]), (10) But after stopping etoposide on [**2136-6-24**], his cramping and nausea improved by [**2136-6-26**].
He was found to be neutropenic on [**2136-6-28**] with WBC at 1.2 and ANC at 467.
His colonoscopy had to be with held.
On [**2136-6-29**], his WBC was 1.7 and his ANC was 969.
He had his colonoscopy on [**2136-6-29**] without problem.

Physical Examination On Discharge: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.7 F, blood pressure 130/80, pulse 73, repsiration 18, and oxygen saturation 96% in room air.
His muscle strengths are [**5-9**] at all muscle groups, except for 4+/5 strength in right handgrip.
His reflexes are 2- and symmetric bilaterally.
Sensory examination is intact to touch and proprioception.
Coordination examination does not reveal appendicular dysmetria.

In addition, the overall slowing and voltage reduction would suggest a diffuse encephalopathy more accentuated over the left than the right.
This might be attributed to slight asymmetric position of the neck, but mass effect cannot be excluded, thus repeated radiograph, or if clinically justified, CT of the neck might be considered.
CT Neck: IMPRESSION: No evidence of compression of the airway.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a congenital fusion anomaly with C5- C7 "block" vertebral body with rudimentary intervening disc spaces, as well as ankylosis of the posterior elements, particularly at C5-C6 on the right (as on MR examination of [**2136-10-30**].
CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1.
Hypodensity in the right frontoparietal lobe is more apparent than on reference CT head of [**2136-11-24**] and may represent subacute infarct.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The hypodense region in right parietovertex subcortical white matter likely corresponds to the vasogenic edema associated with numerous enhancing lesions at this site, well-demonstrated on the interval MR study of [**2136-11-26**], which had progressed since the prior study of [**2136-10-23**].
He had an MRI that showed slight progression of his lesions from the previous study.
CT of his head showed hypodensity in the right frontoparietal lobe which is more apparent than on reference CT head of [**2136-11-24**] and may represent subacute infarct.
He was feeling was that his complaints of vertigo, lip numbness, drowsiness are all manifestations of continuing seizure activity.
Neck X-ray showed possible left sided impingement and deviation to the right, which could not differentiate between mass effect versus rotation of the film.
A CT neck was pursued which showed no evidence of compression of the airway, just a benign congenital anomaly.
WBC stable at 2-4 range.
We have not made any adjustment in his blood pressure medications.
