Of note he had a recent admission from [**Date range (1) 10375**] for BRBPR requiring 7 units of PRBCs.
During that admission, he underwent EGD which showed an ulcerated, malignant-appearing mass in the antrum of the stomach, with stigmata of recent bleeding.
In the ED, patient has been hemodynamically stable with SBP 90-100s.
VS prior to transfer were 98 113/56 20 99% ra.
NG lavage performed and was negative.
MDS on dacogen - presented in [**2143-9-28**] with pancytopenia, complained of dyspnea on exertion - cytopenias progressed and he had a repeat bone marrow done in [**1-4**] which showed a markedly hypercellular bone marrow with significant dysplasia in the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.
Flow cytometry demonstrated CD-34-positive cells comprised 4-5% of total blast gated events.
Cytogenetics revealed [**11-16**] cells have abnormal chromosome 12 and an abnormal chromosome 17 in a possible three way translocation.
- refractory to Procrit, at escalating doses and then became red blood cell transfusion dependent - Decitabine therapy was initiated [**2145-9-13**] but had to be discontinued due to a hematoma which developed at the site of a wound.
CT scan demonstrated perigastric adenopathy and EGD had a multilobulated mass with ulceration.
- Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated mildly hypercellular marrow for age with megakaryocytic dysplasia and occasional ringed sideroblasts (10%) without evidence of lymphoma.

Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  CXR [**2146-6-2**]: In comparison with the study of [**5-31**], the left hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, consistent with some improvement in the atelectatic change in the region.
He was transfused a total of 7 units of pRBCs with a goal Hct of 30 and 3 units of platelets with a goal of maintaing platelets above 30.
C. diff was negative x2.
His Hct remained stable throughout the rest of the hospital course.
CXR at OSH was normal.
#  Acute Kidney Injury:  Creatinine was up to 1.2 from baseline of 0.8 on admission.
CXR revealed improving atelectasis, but no evidence of PNA.
Cultures failed to yield any organisms.
We found your red blood cell count to be very low and gave you red blood cells and platelets.
