CT head was done showing a left lesion with hemorrhage.
Right strength deltoids [**2-24**], hamstrings [**2-24**], IP 3-/5 all other muscle groups on the right [**3-26**].
Recommend MRI to further evaluate.
The extra-axial location and involvement of the adjacent bone is suggestive of a meningioma but other forms of more aggressive extra-axial masses should be considered in the differential diagnosis given the presence of extensive hemorrhage which is somewhat unusual for a meningioma.
[**2105-7-4**] CT abdomen pelvis 1.
If clinically indicated, a hepatic MRI could be obtained for further evaluation as small cystic foci are difficult to differentiate from small solid lesions on CT exam.
If hepatic MRI is performed, attempt can be made to characterize these as well.
MRI abdomen [**2105-7-5**] 1.
MRI Head [**2105-7-10**] 1.
CT and MRI imaging demonstrated an extra-axial mass with surrounding meningeal enhancement and associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
CT abdomen/pelvis and follow up MRI showed no significant abnormalities to suggest malignancy.
