Head CT [**8-20**]: Expected appearance, status post craniotomy.
MRI is better able to detect acute infarct if clinically suspected  MRI [**8-21**]: 1.
Her SBP was kept less that 160, and her neuro exam was closely followed.
Her post op head CT demonstrated edema.
MRI showed increase in edema and steriods were kept at 4mg Q6H.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
?You will not need an MRI of the brain with/ or without gadolinium contrast.
