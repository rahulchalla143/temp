The patient's CT scan revealed 1.6 by 2.0 centimeter Klatskin tumor with no evidence of liver mass nor encasement of vessels.
The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which showed normal pancreatic duct but biliary stricture, consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.
An MRCT in [**2147-12-6**], revealed a 2 centimeter mass in the porta hepatis consistent with cholangiocarcinoma, with extensive periportal lymphadenopathy.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  On [**2148-2-15**], white blood cell count 8.0, hematocrit 29.9, platelets 204.
PT 14.6, PTT 51.7, INR 1.4.
Sodium 135, potassium 3.5, chloride 101, bicarbonate 24, BUN 14, creatinine 1.0 and glucose 78.
AST 102, alkaline phosphatase 213, amylase 144/168.
Total bilirubin 7.9, albumin 2.5, calcium 8.0, magnesium 1.8 and phosphate 3.2.
Bio-cultures from [**2-5**], Enterococcus species in yeast and [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] cultures revealed Vancomycin sensitive enterococcus.
Blood cultures from [**2-5**] showed no growth.
[**2-6**] CT scan of abdomen:  Complete resolution of right subhepatic collection.
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit intubated for close observation following surgery due to prolonged surgical time and estimated blood loss of 1200 cc..
During this period, the patient's white blood cell count began to rise to 12.8, although the patient remained afebrile.
A [**1-24**] culture revealed coagulase negative Staphylococcus from blood, one out of four bottles and enterococcus fro peritoneal drain culture.
On [**1-27**], the patient's peritoneal culture revealed [**Female First Name (un) 564**] and Fluconazole was added.
Interestingly, the patient's total bilirubin began to rise along with white blood cell counts.
A cholangiogram was also performed on [**2-5**] and because of the 5 centimeter fluid collection noted, Interventional Radiology was consulted to remove the collection for culture.
White blood cell count began to decrease the following day along with total bilirubin.
