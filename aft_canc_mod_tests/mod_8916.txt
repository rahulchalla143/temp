Name:  [**Known lastname 4793**], [**Known firstname 4794**]                     Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 4795**]  Admission Date:  [**2123-1-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2123-1-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2067-10-10**]     Sex:  M  Service:  BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT  ADDENDUM:  On [**2123-1-4**], an MRI was obtained of the head which showed a small area of enhancement in the left motor cortex which may represent an AVM versus small hemorrhage, but in either case it does not represent a septic embolism.
The patient had an ultrasound drainage of the left elbow abscess of 6 cc of fluid which was sent off for Gram's stain and culture.
Gram's stain revealed only polymorphonucleocytes.
The patient had an MR of the calves which showed the right calf had a tiny abscess in the lateral soleus muscle and the left calf had a tiny abscess in the posterior tibialis muscles.
Infectious Disease suggested a TEE and a torso CT to look for endocarditis or further abscesses.
Torso CT showed no evidence of abscesses and a mildly thickened bladder wall which could be consistent with cystitis.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2021**]-[**Location (un) 2022**] drain was left in the elbow for 24 hours and drained a moderate amount of serosanguinous fluid, after which it was pulled.
The patient plans for further workup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The blood pressure and heart rate were stable the whole time.
