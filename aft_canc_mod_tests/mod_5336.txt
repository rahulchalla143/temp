NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN  HISTORY: Brain mass.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT scan.
COMPARISON STUDY: [**2178-4-17**] CT scan of the head, reported by Drs.
ADDENDUM: There is a tiny residual gas collection superior to the biopsy site, definitely decreased in extent compared to the prior study of [**4-17**].

HISTORY: Ring-enhancing brain mass with edema seen on CT scan.
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted brain images with gadolinium enhancement.
WET READ REPORT: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 71796**] interpreted this study as revealing "bilateral parenchymal masses, suggesting metastatic disease.
FINDINGS: The study indeed reveals a large right parietal, irregularly thick ring enhancing mass, possibly with some tiny "daughter" cystic components extending towards the cortical surface.
I discussed this case this morning with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided that a non-contrast head CT scan would be a helpful followup diagnostic procedure to further characterize the left cerebral hemispheric lesions prior to brain biopsy of the right parietal lesion.
No evidence of a primary pulmonary neoplasm, but PA/Lateral CXR or CT would be more sensitive than a portable study and may be helpful for more complete assessment, if not already recently obtained.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
She had a biopsy which showed glioblastoma, WHO grade IV.
She was noted on [**4-21**] to have headache, with 4/18 she had mental status changes and imaging c/w herniation.
