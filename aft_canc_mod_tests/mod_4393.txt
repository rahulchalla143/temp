Interval development of diffuse and symmetric perihilar ground glass opacities and septal thickening, most suggestive of diffuse pulmonary edema.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-11-9**], the degrees of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation along with pulmonary hypertension have all increased.

-transvaginal u/s [**2167-11-23**] 1.
Moderate-to-large amount of free fluid is seen within the pelvis, similar to recent prior CT exam.
- CT chest/[**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis w/o contrast ([**2167-11-17**]) 1.
- Echocardiogram ([**2167-11-9**]) The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Diastolic function could not be assessed.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Noted anemic 5 years ago with polyps on colonoscopy but persisted and eventually deveoped severe pancytopenic and CT [**Last Name (un) 103**] showed splenomegaly - 1 BMBx equivocal second showed MDS.
She was still overloaded re volume status but urine output improved and fluid status improved with boluses of furosemide on advice of renal.
IV MP stopped on [**12-5**] but restarted on [**12-7**] Cefepime stopped [**12-10**].
and IV cefepime/[**Doctor Last Name **] started [**12-17**] due to new onset [**Last Name (un) 103**] pain although scan negative ?
Respiratory decompensation [**12-21**] and CT showed pulmonary edema and responded to aggressive diuresis with considerable improvement in fluid status.
She was found to have HLAII antibodies which do not necessitate HLA matched platelets.
Although she was still requiring frequent transfusions of platelets and blood and needed to continue micafungin, it was felt that the pt was stable enough to be discharged to the apartments with daily monitoring at the [**Hospital 3242**] clinic.
Total bilirubin was elevated (direct bilirubin elevated) at one point, but abdominal ultasound was negative.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis did not identify any other source of bleed.
Therefore, the patient was tranfused PRBC to a goal hct >21.
In the ICU, the patient's neutropenia persisted throughout her ICU stay, but her ANC rose to 494 before she left the ICU.
Started Atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**] [**12-9**] and stopped cefepime [**12-10**].
Bone marrow from [**12-18**] was hypocellular but otherwise trilineage hematopoesis.
CMV 1070 copies - started treatment dose IV gancyclovir [**12-24**].
CT scan on [**10-31**] and [**11-4**] showed no evidence of infiltrate.
The patient's neutropenia persisted throughout her ICU stay, but her ANC rose to 494 before she left the ICU.
Her most recent granulocyte count is 494 on [**11-23**].
She developed worsening hypervolemia, hyperkalemia up to 6.3 and a Creatinine level of 4.1 in spite of intravenous fluids and treatment for hyperkalemia.
She had a temporary dialysis line inserted on [**12-1**]  and it was felt that her uremia may be contributing to altered mental status although this was multi-factorial and resolved by early 11/[**2167**].
She had bilateral effusions and R effusion worse on CT [**12-21**].
She passed progressively higher volumes of urine and by [**12-4**] passed 1000ml urine over 24 hrs as end of [**12-4**] and this trended upwards.
On advice of renal she was slowly started on IV furosemide boluses to help her fluid status.
Following discontinuation of antibiotics, she greatly improved in the matter of a few days to the extent that by  [**12-9**] she was GCS 15/15.
Her blood pressure was controlled initially with IV hydralazine and ;latterly has been transitioned to oral labetalol.
She otherwise had an unremarkable neuro exam other than mild jerky saccades.
On [**11-24**] overnight, fell out of bed and head CT showed bifrontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Platelet count not increasing as of [**12-24**] and labs sent for HLA Ab.
IVIg 0.4g/kg 25g one dose [**12-25**].
In the ICU, cyclosporin levels were checked qAM and cyclosporin was redosed if level <100 as per BMT recs.
Abdominal U/S found no biliary/gallbladder pathology.
In the course post return rom the ICU, we tapered IV methylpred and stopped on [**12-5**] Cyclosporin levels were taken daily and dose was adjusted accordingly.
Cyclosporin level aim was <100 in ICU on renal advice and on transfer to the floor 100-150 but when renal function improved, this was increased to 150-200.
Level 263 on [**12-14**] and reduced to 75mg [**Hospital1 **].
but gradual over last 3 days - CT showed pulmonary edema and aggressively diuresed total 100mg IV furosemide [**12-21**].
Echo [**12-21**] showed good LV function, Mod MR/TR and pulmonary HTN.
Pertussis -ve and CT-chest showed some change in GGOs which have migrated.
Repeat CT chest 1 week and started cough suppressants [**12-9**] with guaifensain/dextro QID regularly and added codeine PRN [**12-10**]  which improved matters.
Will need repeat CMV levels on [**1-2**] (one week from [**12-28**]).
Changed to oral labetalol [**12-10**] and BP thus far controlled.
)(s)* Refills:*2* 20. prednisone 20 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day for 4 days.
Over the course of your transplant stay, you experienced some fevers and cough for which you received antiobiotics given that your white blood cell count was very low.
You also had a fall out of your bed; CT scan was performed at that time which should a small amount of bleeding in your head.
You were seen by gynecology and ultra sound showed thickened endometrial stripe that will need further gynecologic follow-up as an outpatient in the future.
