Physical Exam: T: 98.5  HR: 93  BP: 144/50  RR: 22  O2Sat: 94% Gen: AAOx3, NAD Heart: RRR, no murmur Lungs: CTAB Abd: +BS, soft, NT, ND Incision: Neck and abdominal incisions C/D/I Extr: 1+ edema   Pertinent Results: [**2137-3-15**] ABD DRAIN FLUID Amylase 3721 IU/L [**2137-3-20**] Amylase (Abd drain) 6600 IU/L .
IMAGING: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-3-15**] - Small bilateral pleural effusions and retrocardiac atelectasis versus air space consolidation  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-3-16**] - Increased pulmonary parenchymal density which may represent developing edema.
No other significant interval change  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-3-20**] - Stable moderate bilateral pleural effusions with increasing left basilar atelectasis or, less likely, consolidation  ESOPHAGUS  [**2137-3-20**] - Normal esophagogastric anastomosis without evidence of leak or stricture  CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2137-3-21**] - no pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax  Chest CT : [**2137-3-24**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
In a patient with a known malignancy, followup CT scan in [**2-5**] months is recommended.
Interval 3- to 6-month CT followup is recommended for this finding as well.
[**2137-3-25**] CT guided needle aspirate of abd collection: IMPRESSION: Successful CT-guided aspiration of a peripancreatic fluid collection anterior to the head of the pancreas.
His follow-up CXRs revealed a left pleural effusion that was tapped by IP on [**3-19**] that resulted in 500cc of serosanguinous fluid.
His pleural fluid had inflammatory cells but was negative for malignant cells.
Subsequent CXRs showed stable bilateral pleural effusions.
His oxygen requirement remained high despite diuresis and a Ct scan was done and subsegmenatl PE's were discovered.
Heme: His HCT decreased to 22.6 on [**3-15**].
His HCT rose to 25.5 and stablized there.
His blood and urine were cultured and were negative for infection.
A CT scan of the abd was done on [**2137-3-25**] and an abdomen fluid collection at the head of the pancreas was seen and subsequently tapped by IR and was non-infectious.
T/L/D:  Post-op, he had an NGT, neck JP drain along with an abdominal JP, a J-tube to gravity and a Foley catheter.
The abdominal JP, which had an amylase level of 6600 ([**3-20**]) and the J-tube, which was used for tubefeeds, remained after discharge.
His abdominal JP was placed to gravity bag prior to discharge.
He did well overall except for decreases in oxygen sat with ambulation.
