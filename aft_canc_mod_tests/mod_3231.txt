A stat chest x-ray was ordered to rule out pulmonary edema.
An electrocardiogram was also ordered and was indeterminate.
Given an arterial blood gas was drawn which revealed the patient to be significantly acidotic, a decision was ultimately made to intubate the patient and transfer her to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.
In the Intensive Care Unit, series of cardiac enzymes were drawn and the patient was ultimately ruled in for myocardial infarction.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent.
CT of the patient's head was ultimately ordered and was negative for stroke.
Part of the patient's workup at the time included duplex ultrasound to evaluate for portal vein thrombosis.
The patient was also scheduled for CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on the night of postoperative day number four.
The study revealed the patient had no central pulmonary embolism but was inconclusive about possible segmental pulmonary embolisms.
Blood, urine, sputum and wound cultures were drawn on the night of the [**Hospital 228**] transfer to the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient's blood cultures ultimately grew out E. coli.
Four out of six of the patient's urine cultures were ultimately negative.
The patient's sputum grew out coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, gram negative rods, beta Streptococci.
Follow-up blood cultures drawn on [**2173-5-18**], were negative.
Wound cultures grew coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus.
The results of the patient's pathology studies ultimately revealed that the patient had a clear cell cancer of the pancreas.
It should also be noted that the patient had a transient period of thrombocytopenia with her platelet count trending down into the 50,000 and 60,000 while in the Intensive Care Unit.
