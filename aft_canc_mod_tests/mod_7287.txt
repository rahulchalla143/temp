Her ascitic fluid had a SAAG>1.1 and demonstrated no evidence of infection.
Her RUQ ultrasound demonstrated cholelithiasis, but no evidence of cholecystitis.
An abdominal CT was planned, but Ms. [**Known lastname **] refused this test.
Hepatitis and autoimmune serologies were sent, given her mild elevation of LFTs (mainly a cholestatic picture).
There was suspicion that her ascites could be due to peritoneal or hepatic metastases from her breast CA, but cytology of ascitic fluid was negative for malignant cells.
When entering the room to see patient, the liver fellow noted the patient to be unresponsive with vomitus on her chin, and SaO2 48%.
Her SaO2 improved to 100% on 100% bag-mask.
She was intubated with etomidate and succinylcholine, and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management of likely aspiration event.
ABG at time of transfer was 7.04/77/116.
Her BP also fell to SBP 80, with little response to 2L NS wide open.
A repeat RUQ U/S with doppler was done to r/o Budd Chiari, and found a patent portal vein with no hyperdynamic waveform to suggest CHF.
She had no pulse, heart sounds, or breath sounds for 2 minutes.
