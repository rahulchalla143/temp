HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 53 year old woman with a past medical history significant for advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer who presented complaining of bright red blood since [**2154-9-25**] that has intensified over the three days prior to evaluation in the Emergency Department.
She also reports an appreciable increase in lower extremity edema approximately 25 pounds, which has responded initially to diuresis on her last admission but has since reaccumulation and this has limited her ability to ambulate and has caused significant discomfort in her legs.
Interval evaluation of her biliary draining system reveals portal venous thrombosis and a recent admission for cholecystitis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature is 99.9 F.; heart rate was 87 to 102; blood pressure 94/41; respiratory rate 16.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 6.5, hematocrit 24.4, platelets 277, INR 1.1.
Chemistry panel was sodium 135, potassium 3.4, chloride 95, bicarbonate 31, blood urea nitrogen 10, creatinine 0.7, glucose 137.
Her AST was 58, ALT 26, amylase 27, alkaline phosphatase 734, albumin 2.7, calcium 8.8, phosphate 2.7, magnesium 1.8.
Two sets of blood cultures were drawn which were ultimately sterile.
Chest x-ray showed a decrease in the right sided pleural effusion which was unchanged and small left pleural effusion as well as atelectasis of the left base.
She underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and an antral gastric and antral ulcer was identified and injected with epinephrine with good hemostasis.
Interval assessment of her hemoglobin and hematocrit however showed continuing decline.
A repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed diffuse bleeding from a very friable gastric mucosa.
Blood cultures were obtained and at the time of this dictation, one set (it is unclear if it was drawn from her PICC line or peripherally), had grown Gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
A urinary culture was performed and enterococcal species were isolated.
She also had a paracentesis performed which showed no evidence of peritonitis and the cultures remained sterile at the time of this dictation.
She was started empirically on Vancomycin for an enterococcal urinary tract infection as well as the morphologic findings of her blood culture.
Her electrolytes remained in good order with sporadic repletion of potassium and magnesium being required.
