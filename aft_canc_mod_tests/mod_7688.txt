GRAM STAIN (Final [**2162-8-13**]):       2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2162-8-16**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary): Imaging: CXR [**8-11**]: Severe emphysematous changes are redemonstrated.
CXR ([**8-13**]): A pigtail catheter is seen near the left lung base with the tip towards the left cardiophrenic angle.
Mild interstitial thickening is seen in the left mid and bilateral lung bases suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 83F with COPD oh home O2, severe systolic and diastolic CHF (EF=25%), squamous cell lung CA was admitted with  dyspnea x 1 week that worsened acutely on the day of admission.
# Dyspnea - Patient's dyspnea was thought to be multifactorial but was consistent with flash pulmonary edema/acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure.
Serial cardiac enzymes were negative for acute MI.
Interventional pulmonary performed a thoracentesis and pigtail catheter placement and drained approximately 1 L of fluid, most suggestive of transudate BUT pleural fluid CYTOLOGY is still PENDING.
#Acute Renal Failure: Upon admission, the creatinine was 1.1, but with the aggressive diuresis, the creatinine climbed to 1.6.
Clearly, the titration of diuretics based on daily weights, O2 sats, pulmonary signs and symptoms, and renal function will be crucial to preventing re-hospitalization.
# Anemia - She has been chronically anemic and her hematocrit remained stable.
Bladder scans revealed up to 300 cc of urine.
A UA was negative for infection.
She will need: -daily weights -daily physician or NP/PA review of her clinical status and medication regimen -monitoring of her renal function in the setting of diuresis -availability of chest X-Ray for evaluation of decreasing sats - DDX includes pulmonary edema, re-development of pleural effusion (lower likelyhood if she is maintained on the "dry" side as she is now), PNA.
IF CXR negative emphysema exacerbation should be considered.
Would transfuse only if she is symptomatic or if her Hct drops below 22%, though we leave this to the discretion of the [**Hospital1 1501**] physician.
13. calcium carbonate 200 mg calcium (500 mg) Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO BID (2 times a day).
Weight gains of more than 3Lbs over one week should be reported to the physician and may represent a need for more diuretics.
Blood pressures are currently on the low side.
No recent changes have been made to her anti-hypertensive regimen, but should be considered if her BP continues to run low.
Her hematocrit is 25%.
