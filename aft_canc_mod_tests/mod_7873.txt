STUDIES: CXR ([**12-2**]): Fullness of the hila and prominence of the interstitial markings, suggest mild pulmonary edema.
CXR ([**12-4**]): Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Repeat troponins were mildly elevated, but likely in the setting of her CKD and possible demand that she had initially.
There was no clear source of bleeding and BUN was not elevated above baseline to suggest any underlying GI bleeding.
# Hypertension: Blood pressure was stable in the 130s throughout her stay.
She is discharged to continue with all three medications since low blood pressure was no longer an issue.
She received antibiotics and lasix while in the hospital, likely to account for the increase in creatinine to 1.8 from admission.
On chest X-ray, you were found to have fluid in your lungs and pneumonia.
