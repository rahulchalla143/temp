An ERCP was attempted at the outside hospital which was unsuccessful so the patient's primary care physician transferred him to [**Hospital6 1760**] where he underwent a second ERCP which was also unsuccessful due to blood and coffee grounds in the stomach and oozing at the major papilla and edema.
He denied abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, or unintentional weight loss.
His vital signs were normal.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
On admission, the patient received a CT angiogram to demonstrate the nature of his pancreatic mass.
On [**2161-8-20**], an MRI was done to determine the nature of caudate lobe lesion.
The patient was lightheaded but his vital signs were normal and stable.
Subsequently, the angiography showed no signs of hepatic arterial injury.
At this time, he was transferred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Surgical Service and was monitored in the ICU with serial hematocrits and arterial and central venous lines.
The patient's hematocrit fell as low as 24.8 at 10:00 p.m. on [**2161-8-20**].
Serial hematocrits were monitored and the patient's hematocrit was maintained above 30 from the morning of [**2161-8-22**].
His hematocrit remained stable for the rest of the hospital stay.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The patient had an ERCP done on [**2161-8-18**] which showed a moderate amount of blood and coffee grounds in the stomach and active oozing at the major papilla with unsuccessful attempts at cannulation of the biliary duct.
A CTA of the abdomen on [**2161-8-19**] showed a 3.5 by 3.9 cm pancreatic mass producing obstruction of the common bile duct and intrahepatic bile ducts.
The patient received an MRI of the abdomen on [**2161-8-20**] which showed the caudate lobe lesion to be consistent with hemangioma.
Angiography on [**2161-8-20**] showed no subhepatic arterial injury.
The patient received another CT of the abdomen on [**2161-8-25**] which showed a large subcapsular right lobe hepatic hematoma with extension into the liver parenchyma.
Films of the left knee on [**2161-8-26**] showed mild degenerative changes.
Pertinent laboratories during this admission include hematocrit on admission of 40.5, subsequent drop in hematocrit, as mentioned in the hospital course, and hematocrit on [**2161-8-25**] of 30.5.
On admission, the patient's total bilirubin was around 24.
His liver enzymes remained elevated throughout the hospital stay, although they did decrease significantly.
On [**2161-8-23**], his ALT was 395, AST 105, and alkaline phosphatase 247.
On admission, ALT was 553, AST 292, alkaline phosphatase 465.
He is to go for CT angiogram on [**2161-9-14**] at 10:15 before he visits Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] and will follow the visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] with his preoperative visit with Anesthesia and for preoperative laboratories.
