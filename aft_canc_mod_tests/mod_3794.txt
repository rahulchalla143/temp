Physical Exam: T 98.4 110/58 (110-122/56-70) HR 67 RR 20 95%RA Gen: comfortable cachectic male lying in bed, NAD.
CV: Distant heart sounds, nl s1 s2, no mrg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
CT chest ([**12-2**]): IMPRESSION: 1) Bilateral upper [**Month/Year (2) 3630**] segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli.
Dedicated CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was recommended for further evaluation of the lymphadenopathy and to assess for extensive disease.
Again, a dedicated CT of the abdomen and pelvis would be helpful in further evaluation of this finding.
[**2100-12-3**]: CT Abd CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Again demonstrated within the right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] are three cavitating lesions with central areas of low attenuation, likely representing necrosis, unchanged since the prior exam.
The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and stomach are all within normal limits.
The largest fat containing lesion seen on series 2, image 38, which appears to have a thin wall, measuring 4.0 x 2.9 cm.
One of these lesions is seen within the left periaortic region, best seen on series 2, image 55, which measures 3.5 x 3.3 cm.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Again seen within the pelvis are several enlarged lymph nodes along the iliac chains.
[**2100-12-9**]: bronchial brushings NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**2100-12-13**]: CTA CT CHEST WITHOUT/WITH CONTRAST: There are residual small filling defects within the left upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] segmental pulmonary artery, as well as within the right upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] and mid [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries, markedly decreased in size in the interval.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were essential in delineating the pathology described above.
[**2100-12-20**] CT abd/pelvis CT THORAX W/CONTRAST  Extensive air space consolidation is identified in the right upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**].
A right-sided subclavian line is in-situ, but there is no evidence of perivenous abnormality to suggest extravasation.
The patient's pulmonary emboli were not visualized, but the examination was not targeted to evaluate for this.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  There is evidence of large and small bowel dilatation.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Multiple intraperitoneal fat-filled lymph nodes are identified.
CT BONES W/CONTRAST  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic abnormality is identified.
[**12-23**] transfusion reaction DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname **] experienced an increase in respiratory rate, blood pressure, and heart rate 75 minutes following a test dose of IVIG.
[**2100-12-25**] CT chest FINDINGS: There has been interval worsening of the right upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] pneumonia with new involvement of the anterior segment.
CT BONES WITHOUT CONTRAST: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic abnormalities identified.
Note: Gram stain and PAS stains are negative for bacteria and fungi.
[**2101-1-2**] Chest CT CT CHEST W/IV CONTRAST: A left subclavian venous access catheter is in place with the tip terminating in the distal SVC.
There are multiple scattered nodular densities within the anterior segment of the right upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] (series 102-B, images 96 and 102), which appear unchanged from the previous examination.
Ultimately pt had a bronchoscopy here with BAL positive for aspergillus and pseudomonas; bronchial biopsy with HSV; and gram stain with gram positive cocci.
Pulmonary nodules were not biopsied as it was felt that it would not change management.
GI was consulted and colonoscopy was performed with diagnosis of ileus and treatment with decompression with rectal tube.
Repeat Chest CT performed on [**1-2**] showed stable to slightly increased lymphadenopathy consistent with CLL and stable to slight improvement in cavitary PNA of RUL and superior segment of RLL.
PNA:Chest CT performed on [**1-2**] showed stable to slight improvement in cavitary PNA of RUL and superior segment of RLL.
Pt received a total antibiotic course of: vanco (20 days), Voriconazole (20 days), Aztreonam (18 days, d/c [**1-3**]), Cipro (12 days, d/c [**1-1**]), Flagyl (11 days, d/c [**12-31**]), Pt is to continue vancomycin (for corynebaterium in BAL gram stain) and voriconazole (for aspergillus) until he follows up in [**Hospital **] clinic.
He should get a repeat chest CT several days prior to the visit.
PE: Recent chest CT from [**1-2**] showed peripheral based densities within the posterior aspect of the right lower [**Month/Year (2) 3630**], possibly consistent with areas of pneumonia vs. pulmonary infarcts, related to prior PE.
Continue heparin until pt is therapeutic on coumadin with goal INR [**3-9**].
[**12-20**] Abd CT scan showed diffuse dilated small and large bowel.
Last dilantin level was 4.6 on day of discharge.
Please check phenytoin level on [**1-7**].
Skin biopsy showed HSV.
