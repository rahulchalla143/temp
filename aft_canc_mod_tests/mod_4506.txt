Head CT [**4-20**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Post operatively he was transferred back to the ICU for continued neuro monitoring and strict blood pressure control.
A post op head CT showed good evacuation of SDH.
His exam post operatively did improve somewhat and he began to follow commands with his LUE.
On [**4-8**] he stopped following commands and a head CT showed re-accumulation of his previously evacuated SDH.
ON [**4-9**] he went back to the OR for a left sided craniotomy, which showed interval decrease in midline shift.
He was less responsive than the previous day so a repeat CT was done which showed stable intracranial hemorrhages with no acute infarct or increase in cerebral edema.
A upper extremity U/s and LENIs were obtained [**4-14**] DVT in right basilic vein and superficial reight cephalic vein.
He continued to have issues with his respiratory status and required CPAP to keep O2 saturation due to his pneumonia.
On [**4-14**] his neuro exam improved and was deemed stable for Q4h neuro checks.
A Head CT was done on [**4-20**] to reassess prior to discharge and remained stable.
