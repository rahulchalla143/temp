Noncontrast head CT revealed right frontal new hypodense area with rim of hyperdensity in the area of prior flair hyperintensity ([**7-19**]) which was concerning for evolving hemorrhage versus abcess.
MRI suggested that the R frontal lesion represented scar tissue from prior premature removal of EVD by the patient.
Pertinent Results: CT Head [**2114-10-24**]: 1)Right frontal parenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema, mass effect and approximately 6 mm leftward shift of normally midline structures.
CT Head [**2114-10-25**]: This is a post-op scan showing evacuation of the IPH, pneumocephalus, and stable midline shift.
CT Head [**2114-10-26**]: There is significant improvement.
CT Torso:  Revealed a RML pulmonary nodule and right apical pleural bleb.
His neurologic exam worsened and he was emergently taken to the OR for evacuation of the hemmorrhage on [**2114-10-25**].
His post-operative head CT showed pneumocephalus and evacuation of the IPH.
On [**2114-10-26**] his repeat CT was much improved with decreased midline shift and mass effect.
Preliminary pathology from the IPH removed in the OR showed malignant neoplasm.
In this setting, he was sent to undergo a PET scan to attempt to further identify a lesion.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right intraparenchymal hemorrhage, pathology consistant with metastatic melanoma   Discharge Condition: Neurologically stable   Discharge Instructions: WOUND CARE ??????
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
You will not require a MRI of the head, as this was done during your acute hospitalization Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**4-16**] weeks with a non-contrast head CT.
