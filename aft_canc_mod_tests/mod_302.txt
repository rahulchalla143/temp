[**2188-7-16**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Bilateral white matter hypodense areas in parietal and occipital, and in left frontal white matter.
needs MRI scan of the brain with IV gadolinium, for more accurate assessment.
[**2188-7-18**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 1.
These are inadequately evaluated on the non-contrast CT study.
PORT Examination was markedly limited due to patient's altered mental status.
Limited examination of the left renal fossa was unremarkable.
[**2188-7-21**] Radiology MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Confluent symmetric foci of T2 prolongation in the posterior brain, predominantly in the posterior brain white matter, including the posterior aspects of the frontal lobe and much of the parietal and occipital lobes, and another focus in the left frontal periventricular white matter, are unchanged.
[**2188-7-18**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) A left retrocardiac opacity could represent early pneumonia.
[**2188-7-21**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) The heart size is mildly enlarged but stable.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2188-5-20**] no significant change.
[**2188-7-18**] Cardiology ECG Baseline artifact Sinus rhythm Probable normal ECG, although baseline artifact makes assessment difficult.
MRI hyperintense lesions of FLAIR c/w leukoencephalopathy w/ areas of questionable stroke.
Blood pressures were too difficult to control on floor and there was concern over mental status/ability to tolerate POs, so he was admitted to ICU on [**7-18**].
Pt was started on Nitro and esmolol gtt for BP control, with goals SBPs 120-130.
By [**7-20**] and [**7-21**] with improved BP control, and off pressor drips, the patient's MS greatly improved and now has clear sensorium and asking appropriate, in-depth questions.
MRI [**7-21**] showed no significant change per official read (possible improvement per Neuro).
#) Hyperkalemia: Patient presented with a potassium of 5.5 on admission, unclear etiology.
The patient had serial EKGs with no abnormalities.
Despite a small improvement, patient had worsened potassium of 5.7, and kayexalate was given.
K+ of 4.1 at time of discharge.
Non-gap metabolic acidosis with urine lytes consistent with type I or IV RTA, likely secondary to ARF.
No recent antibiotics and no urine eos to suggest interstitial nephritis.
Baseline Hct around 30.
Glucosuria: Glucosuria on U/A, and elevated serum values recently, fasting glucose in 80s.
MRI was consistent with a condition known as posterior leukoencephalopathy, which is most likely caused by the sutent chemotherapy.
Over the course of a week, your mentation returned to [**Location 213**] and BP control has been achieved on oral medications.
Your blood counts have additionally fell over the course of this admission, believed to be secondary to the gemzar dose you had received.
You blood pressure should be followed as an outpatient.
