Imaging CXR [**2193-6-20**]: Recurrent, moderately severe, pulmonary edema, worsened since [**6-10**].
CT chest [**2193-6-20**]: No pulmonary embolism.
Evaluation of subsegmental vessels is limited.
Mild fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of the abdominal aorta just proximal to the bifurcation measuring 2.2 cm  CXR [**2193-6-26**] In comparison with study of [**6-20**], the degree of bilateral opacification may be slightly less prominent.
[**Name2 (NI) **] evidence of PNA or PE on CT scan.
TTE showed stable severe AS.
Since resolution of acute dyspneic event pt has been asymptomatic and tolerating 2L of O2 with Pox sats > 95.
An oxygen weaning trial resulted in O2 sats dropping to around 92%.
CXR was obtained which did not show evidence of recurrent pulmonary edema.
#Left acetabular fracture: This was found incidentally on the CT abd/pelvis.
#Stercoral ulcer-patient had evidence of stercoral ulcer on his CT abdomen with some air surrounding his portal system, however his abdominal exam was unremarkable and he had no abdominal pain.
#Diastolic CHF: Echo on [**2193-6-21**] showed symmetric LVH with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Pulmonary edema in setting of diastolic CHF is likely cause of his respiratory distress.
Pt is very sensitive to fluid overload and should have his fluid balance monitored to prevent future episodes of volume overload.
#Hypothyroidism: TSH was elevated 2/[**2192**].
TSH was rechecked and found to be elevated to 12 on discharge.
Per previous endocrine eval: He should continue to have fingerstick checks QACHS (AM fasting, before meals, and at bedtime).
Information was obtained from  nursing home medication list.
