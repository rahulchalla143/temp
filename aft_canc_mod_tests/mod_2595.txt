Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with thinned and akinetic inferior/inferolateral.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-3-27**], findings are similar.
Subpleural areas of reticular opacity with associated traction bronchiectasis, corresponding to the abnormalities seen on the recent chest radiograph.
When compared to the prior CT of [**2130-8-8**], the greatest dimension has slightly increased in size (from 1.8 to 2.1 cm).
Given slight interval growth compared to CT of [**Month (only) 216**] [**2129**] and solid appearance this may represent a benign or malignant solid lesion and further workup with cystoscopy is recommended.

Cardiac Surgery was consulted and he underwent preoperative workup.
A bladder ultrasound revealed a mass and urology was consulted.
GI was consulted, his hematocrit dropped by 2 points and he was cleared for surgery.
On POD #2 he had atrial fibrillation which was treated with beta blockers and amiodarone.
He was then transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
His coumadin will be managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24717**] for an INR of 2.0-2.5 for atrial fibrillation.
