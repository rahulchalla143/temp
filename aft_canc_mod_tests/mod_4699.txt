He presented to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital where he was admitted on [**3-22**] and discharged on [**3-25**] and during that period he had a CT guided biopsy of the mass with the results inconclusive but showing malignant cells suggestive of carcinoma vs germ cell tumor.
He estimates a total of around 15 ml from all episodes of hemoptysis over the previous day, with the amount each time and frequency stable.
In our ER his initial VS were T 99.3 F, HR 123 BPM, BP 132/83 mmHg, RR 20 X', SpO2 98% on RA.
His ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 120 BPM without any signs of ischemia.
His labs were significant for a microcytic normochromic anemia with HCT of 36.
He underwent a CT-PE, which showed a small PE in left upper lobe segmental artery.
His CT scan of his head showed no acute intracranial process.

Given the patient's history of lung cancer, bone scan may be performed for further evaluation or correlation with PET-CT.  CT Head w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
MRI Head: IMPRESSION: No evidence of metastatic disease to the head.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Tumor cells are negative for cytokeratin 20, AFP, PLAP, and CD30.
Note: The biopsy is comprised of tiny fragments of fibrous tissue being infiltrated by malignant epithelioid cells.
The neoplastic cells are negative for cytokeratin 20, LCA, monoclonal CEA, HCG, PLAP, and S-100.
A mucicarmine stain does not demonstrate mucin.
He was seen by the oncology consult team who recommended MRI brain, and CT abd/pelvis for staging as well as radiation oncology consult.
SQUAMOUS CELL LUNG CANCER: Upon transfer to the OMED service, patient was noted to be in sinus tachycardia to the 110s to 140s and normotensive requiring 4L NC for sats in the 90s.
MRI of head was negative for mets.
CT Abd/Pelvis showed LAD in the celiac and retrocrural axis.
Given these findings along with biopsy results consistent with squamous cell carcinoma, it was felt patient was at least Stage 3A SCCA Lung CA, however given the patient's pleural effusion and possible LAD below the diaphragm, patient's staging may be higher.
Further staging will be performed in the outpatient once he receives a PET/CT.
Alum-Mag Hydroxide-Simeth 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for reflux.
You also had a blood clot in your lungs that was felt secondary to your lung cancer.
