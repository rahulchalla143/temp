Bone marrow biopsy was performed, and the patient was then initiated on leukopheresis prior to admission.

Imaging: ECHO [**2175-8-21**] The left atrium is elongated.
Cytogenetics [**2175-8-21**]   PML at 15q22   RARA at 17q21.1   ETO at 8q22   AML1 at 21q22   CBFB 5' at 16q22   CBFB 3' at 16q22 .
CXR [**2175-8-21**]: IMPRESSIONS: Unchanged bibasilar opacities.
CT Chest [**2175-8-24**] IMPRESSIONS:  1.
Diffuse right pleural thickening with sparing of the medial pleural surface together with tiny right pleural effusion likely account for the CXR appearance.
Otherwise, follow up CT in 3 months may be helpful to ensure stability.
CT sinus [**2175-8-26**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2175-9-8**] Cardiac size is normal.
CXR [**2175-9-10**] Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
[**9-11**] SKIN BIOPSY PATHOLOGY REPORT: Superficial dermal hemorrhage associated with small vessel thrombi and superficial to mid dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (see microscopic description and comment).
If there is continuing clinical concern for herpes virus, culture may prove more sensitive than tissue based stains.
Micafungin and levofloxacin were added on [**2175-8-25**] after CT chest showed ground glass attentuation.
He was also ordered for CT sinus (pt uses fluticasone at home).
CXR showed perhaps a new opacity at base of left lung.
Repeat CXR showed no evidence of PNA.
A punch biopsy was obtained and sent for pathology which showed superficial dermal hemorrhage associated with small vessel thrombi and superficial to mid dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with no evidence of HSV or VZV.
