At that time he was given 40mg lasix, 4mg zofran, 25mg demerol (for shaking) and 5mg lopressor for tachycardia, rate 120s.
He never lost a pulse again and he maintained his blood pressure and was transferred to the ICU for further care.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
[**6-25**] CXR SINGLE SUPINE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST, BEDSIDE: There is interval worsening of the diffuse left lung airspace opacity with new areas of opacification in the right mid and lower lobes.
[**6-26**] CXR Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
# Acute Respiratory Failure: Pt underwent an enteroscopy and colonoscopy for recurrent GI bleeding, following the procedure the patient developed acute respiratory distress requiring intubation.
CXR consistent with pulmonary edema with possible aspiration.
Cardiac enzymes negative for AMI.
He had a brief run of VT with pulse and stable BP which broke within seconds without intervention.
He remained with a stable BP and pulse and was transferred to the ICU.
A TTE was performed which demonstrated slightly reduced EF of 55% but new RV dysfunction from prior [**2143**] TTE.
The patient should undergo further ischemic workup upon discharge.
Acute on chronic diastolic CHF - TTE demonstrated stable EF 55% with mild AS (AoVA 1.2-1.9cm2).
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Following his arrest the patient was found to have a Cr of 1.6.
His Cr bumped to 2.0 then to a peak to 2.7.
Urine electrolytes were sent and Furea was 21% consistent with prerenal etiology.

You had an Echo which showed new right ventricular dysfunction.
Your cardiac enzymes have been negative.
You should follow up with your outpatient cardiologist for further workup of possible ischemic heart disease.
