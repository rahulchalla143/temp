Fluid overload, with anasarca and moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
# Hypotension: On admission he was hypotensive to SBP 80's and thus admitted to the MICU, this was likely in the setting of profound dehydration from GI losses and poor PO intake.
He received a total of 4-5L and his BP improved such that he was transferred to the medical floor.
His BP remained normal afterwards.
A CT abdomen showed improvement in the colitis and a new perirectal abscess but no other abnormalities.
#Perirectal Abscess-Seen on CT, non-symptomatic but on exam he had tender fluctuance in the posterior rectum.
He had a CTA with bilateral subsegmental PEs, nonobstructive and an IVC filter was placed on [**7-10**] given inability to anticoagulate due to known colon malignancy.
# [**Month/Year (2) 2793**] isufficiency: He appears to be at his baseline - but his BUN was elevated on admission likely due to dehydration.
[**Month/Year (2) 2793**] function remained at baseline.
# Anemia: He had a recent transfusion - possibly due to underlying malignancy.
Hct was monitored, there was no need for transfusion as he is actually above recent baseline.
