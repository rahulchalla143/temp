L foot X-ray showed osteo along medial base of first metatarsal could represent a small focus of osteomyelitis.
incontinent of loose stools sent for C-diff x 3, all came back negative.
A greed to have an angiogram w/ the possibility of revascularization instead.
Taken to holding room for scheduled angiogram, cancelled due to creatine rise to 2.3 compared to admission creatinine of 0.7.
Hct down to 24.3, transfused w/ 2 units packed RBC.
Nephrology consulte-recs to hold angiogram likely AIN- recs, start Prednisone 40 mg qd, switch PPI to H2 blocker, labs: CBCw/ diff, LDH, SPEP, UPEP, & urine and creatinine ratio, hold off IV hydration after blood transfusions.
Creatinine continue to rise now 3.0, with low urine output, Nephrology following.
Transferred to Medicine for further medical management, will follow re:vascular perspective, intervention to be revisited once renal/medically stable.
