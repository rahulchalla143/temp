A biopsy was taken but complicated by profuse bleeding which was not amenable to epinephrine injection or clipping due to poor visualization.
Initial vitals were 177/72 87 100% on FiO2 100% PEEP of 5 RR: 14 and Vt: 500.
EGD showed clotted of bleed at GE junction which could be variceal or arterial.

CT Head: No CT evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage.
CT C-spine: Degenerative changes of the cervical spine without evidence for for fracture, normal alignment.
EEG [**2141-10-24**]: IMPRESSION: This EEG continues to show an exceptionally active paroxysmal epileptiform abnormality in the right occipital pole in the context of a continuous focal delta disturbance suggestive of a large structural lesion in that region.
EEG [**2141-10-25**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU video EEG study due to paroxysmal at times periodic epileptiform discharges in the right occipital pole in the context of a continuous focal delta activity suggestive of a large structural lesion in that region.
EEG [**2141-10-26**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU video EEG study due to paroxysmal and, at times, periodic epileptiform discharges in the right occipital pole in the context of a continuous focal delta activity suggestive of a large structural lesion in that region.
CTA HEAD AND NECK [**2141-10-27**]: IMPRESSION: Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications of the cervical carotid bifurcations with no evidence of critical stenosis.
The patient had a trauma line placed, and serial HCTs were monitored.
The patient's HCTs were checked q8h, with goal HCT maintained between 25 and 30.
CT head/neck without contrast was negative for acute process.
EEG showed abnormal epileptiform discharges (the patient has a history of seizures).
MRI showed early subacute infarcts in bilateral frontal, parietal, right posterior temporal and occipital lobes, right thalamus and right superior cerebellar vermis; there are of different chronicity and likely thromboembolic in etiology.
TTE showed aortic regurgitation and aortic stenosis and bubble study was done showing no PFO.
Social work, PT/OT, and speech and swallow were all consulted.
He received a CTA to see if his blood vessels were patent, which they were.
EEG showed abnormal epileptiform discharges; hundreds of briefly sustained electrographic seizures from the right occipital area with occasional spread to the left occiput.
His EEG improved to show less frequent seizures, but they were still occurring.
We stopped his lacosamide, and his EEG did not become more active, so we slowly tapered down the keppra to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].
This can be further tapered down in the future as long as his exam doesn't worsen with each subsequent decrease.
No infectious source was found, but there was a possible RLL infiltrate on CXR and the patient was empirically started on cefepime.
His sputum cultures were also growing out Gram negative rods.
The patient was never ill-appearing, however, and it was thought that his fevers could be medication related or neurogenic fevers, given his new onset stroke.
The patient's home lasix, spironolactone, propranolol were in the setting of the UGIB, but eventually were restarted with no issues.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right sided MCA and PCA territory infarcts   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
