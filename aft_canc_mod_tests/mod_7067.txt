MRI C/T/L spineFINDINGS: Within the cervical region, there is no spinal cord compression seen.
The fat-saturated images show no sign of pathological contrast enhancement either within the cord, or within the limitations of the artifact- degraded parasagittal scans, within the paraspinal regions, either.No definite area of spinal cord compression is seen within the thoracic region nor are there visible areas of pathological enhancement.
