This was discovered incidentally during a CT for her breast cancer followup and restaging.
A subsequent MRI demonstrated bilateral large adnexal masses (most likely Krukenberg tumors-metastases from breast) causing hydronephrosis.
Her weight was 265 pounds, height 5 feet 6 inches tall.
O2 saturation was 93% on room air, temperature 98.6, pulse 79, blood pressure 135/79.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
HEENT examination revealed anicteric, normocephalic, atraumatic.
Cardiac examination was remarkable for a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremity examination revealed left lower extremity edema, upper and lower extremity.
Pelvic examination was as follows:  Adnexal masses were not appreciated secondary to the patient's body habitus.
Her bilateral hydronephrosis was noted, right greater than left.
Overnight in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, the patient had better urine output and did well after extubation.
Ultrasound showed continued hydronephrosis.
Her creatinine reached a level of 3.3 and the decision was made to place a percutaneous nephrostomy tube on the right side.
As of today, her urine output is approximately 3000 cc.
Blood and urine cultures subsequently grew out Escherichia coli and Klebsiella.
Her postobstructive diuresis continued and her urine output was very copious, thus diabetes insipidus workup was initiated.
