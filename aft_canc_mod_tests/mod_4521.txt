In the ED, initial vs were: 103.6 152 108/50 22 94% 2L Nasal Cannula.
Labs were sent for fibrinogen, LDH, Coombs, FDP, and blood cultures: 2 peripheral, 1 from picc line.
Upon removal of this line, CXR showed that the PICC line appears to have been pulled back as well.
U/A clear and CXR shows symmetric pulmonary vascular congestion.

Imaging: - CT abdomen/pelvis ([**6-29**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Given the short-interval appearance, this is likely infectious or inflammatory, though a dedicated CT of the chest is recommended in three months' time in order to exclude an underlying lesion.
CXR ([**6-29**]):  IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
CXR ([**6-30**]):  IMPRESSION: Left basilar opacity.
CXR ([**7-1**]):  IMPRESSION: Bibasilar infiltrate left greater than right.
CXR ([**7-2**]): Small left pleural effusion has developed since [**6-29**], and there is mild left lower lobe atelectasis.
TTE ([**7-3**]): IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations or clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
CXR post PICC placement: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a left-sided PICC line.

# Neutropenic Fevers/rigors with tachycardia:  Given the timing of his fevers/rigors, a transfusion reaction was considered, but ruled out.
A previous transfusion reaction in [**2159-3-25**] was characterized by urticaria and not this clinical picture.
CT abdomen/pelvis revealed both a LLL opacity in the lung and a possible colitis vs. diverticulitis in the sigmoid.
ID was consulted after blood cultures grew Strep viridans and E. coli, both of which were pan-sensitive.
The patient's blood cultures had cleared by [**7-1**].
# Direct hyperbilirubinemia: On presentation, the patient had an elevated bilirubin at 1.9, with direct of 0.9 and an AP of 490; all mildly elevated from prior baseline.
A RUQ ultrasound was normal.
EKG was repeated once the patient was less tachycardic and these changes resolved.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
Your temperature on admission was 103 F. You were admitted to the ICU for close monitoring of your pulse, blood pressure, and temperature.
Your blood cultures drawn on admission grew 2 types of bacteria: E coli and Strep.
Also, we took an ultrasound of your heart to look for bacteria, but this was negative.
We monitored your counts due to your leukemia.
