Admission Date:  [**2194-1-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-1-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-11-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY  Allergies: Sulfur, Elemental  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6743**] Chief Complaint: Lower extremity swelling Weakness Large pelvic mass, likely advance endometrial cancer  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy Total abdominal hysterectomy Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy Lysis of adhesions Radical resection of abdominal pelvic tumor Cystoscopy IVF filter placement PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 8922**] is a 64 yo G1P1 with a h/o T2DM and atrial fibrillation transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] for further mgmt of a large pelvic mass, likely advanced endometrial CA.
The pelvic mass was discovered at that time; she subsequently was discharged after adjustment of her anti-coagulation and transfusion for anemia.
CT on [**12-9**] showed a 24 x 14 x 14cm pelvic mass.
An endometrial/cervical mass biopsy was performed during this initial hospitalization, which was consistent with endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
CA-125 was 1144 and CEA was 23.3.
Slides were reviewed at [**Hospital1 18**]; confirmed endometrial cancer.
V/Q scan was negative for PE.
In the Intensive Care Unit, she received vasopressin for blood pressure support as well as vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl for presumed urosepsis due to her initial hypotension and a leukocytosis of 18.7 with 6 bands, although U/A showed only [**2-20**] WBC.
Her Cr was 3, from a baseline of 1.1 on [**12-18**].
Potassium was noted to be 5.8 on admission.
Her blood pressure also normalized, and the vasopressin was discontinued.
Urine cx grew out yeast only and blood cx were negative, so her antibiotics were stopped and fluconazole was initiated on the day of transfer.
She was also placed on a heparin drip for anti-coagulation both for atrial fibrillation and her bilateral DVT.
On [**1-4**] she was deemed stable for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and mgmt.

Her hospital course was complicated by the following issues:  *) CARDIOVASCULAR:     *) POST-OP HYPOTENSION:  In the immediate post-operative period, the patient's blood pressure was maintained on a Levophed and Phenylephrine drip in the ICU.
On POD#1, cardiac enxymes were cycled x 3 and noted to be negative.
The patient's EKG was noted to be unchanged from her pre-operative EKG.
Her hypotension improved with aggressive fluid resuscitation and blood products.
She was monitored on telemetry throughout her hospitalization.
On POD#10, the patient had a heart rate in the 160's, however she remained asymptomatic.
Her blood pressure remained within a normal range.
Post-operatively, she remained intubated in the ICU secondary to massive fluid volume resusicitation and blood products.
Lower extremity dopplers revealed bilateral deep venous thrombosis.
V/Q scan at [**Hospital3 3583**] was negative for a pulmonary embolism.
She never had any signs of DIC and her platelet count remained stable.
On POD#11, she received 1 unit PRBC to maintain a hemoglobin greater than 9.0.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable.
Her hematocrit is 29.0 on her day of discharge.
Her urine culture revealed yeast, therefore IV Fluconazole was added and she was treated for 5 days.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was afebrile and her WBC count was 12.
Urine culture at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed no growth.
Post-operatively, the patient was noted to have a leukocytosis, thought to be likely a stress response.
She remained afebrile throughout her hospitalization and her leukocytosis normalized.
Her blood culture revealed no growth.
*) RENAL: Upon presentation, that patient was noted to be in acute renal failure, with a creatinine of 3.0.
Her CT scan revealed bilateral hydonephrosis secondary to tumor compression, also likely the etiology of her renal failure.
Post-operatively, her creatinine normalized and remained stable at 0.8.
On POD#7, the patient's urine output dropped to 20cc per hour.
Her creatinine and hematocrit were obtained and were noted to be stable.
She was bolused 500cc normal saline and her urine output responded appropriately.
Her urine output remained adequate for the remainder of her hospitalization.
Since POD#9, we have maintained her blood sugars on Glimepiride and a Regular sliding scale.
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): Please hold for blood pressure less than 90/50 or HR less than 60.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
