Admission Date:  [**2164-9-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-9-24**]   Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9569**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with intervention.
History of Present Illness: 83yo female with known CAD (s/p MI in '70s and cath x7), HTN, Afib, CHF (EF 35%), [**Hospital 5550**] transferred from OSH for cardiac catheterization.
Transfered from MICU on [**9-20**]: Pt transfered to ICU post cath with GIB.
HCT stable over 24 hours after transfused 2 units.
Past Medical History: -CAD -HTN -CVA with residual left sided weakness -Chronic Afib -CHF (EF 35% by ETT MIBI on [**4-24**] at [**Hospital1 1474**]) -GERD -CLL -CML -?DM?
Family History: [**Name (NI) 2280**] - pt is only one with heart disease, stroke, blood clots in family.
Strength: Right UE [**4-25**] with Left UE [**3-26**], Right LE [**4-25**] with Left LE [**3-26**]   Pertinent Results: [**2164-9-13**] 08:55AM   INR(PT)-1.0 [**2164-9-13**] 04:14PM   PLT COUNT-446*# [**2164-9-13**] 06:00PM   DIGOXIN-0.6* [**2164-9-13**] 10:03PM   PLT COUNT-445* [**2164-9-13**] 10:03PM   CK-MB-NotDone [**2164-9-13**] 10:03PM   CK(CPK)-27 [**2164-9-13**] 10:03PM   POTASSIUM-3.5  ELECTROCARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: [**2164-9-13**] Atrial fibrillation with well controlled ventricular response Left axis deviation - possible left anterior fascicular block Left ventricular hypertrophy Diffuse nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities Since previous tracing of [**2157-12-19**], atrial fibrillation is new  ELECTROCARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: [**2164-9-19**] Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2164-9-18**] atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response persist as do the ischemic appearing ST-T wave abnormalities in leads I and aVL.
The T wave inversions recorded on the tracing of [**2164-9-16**] can now be compared with the current ECG showing less prominent T wave inversions in leads V2-V6 but without diagnostic interim change.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed moderate two vessel disease and severe single vessel disease.
The LCX demonstrated moderate diffuse disease in the mid vessel.
Limited resting hemodynamics were performed upon entry.
Left sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (LVEDP was 20 mm Hg).
Left ventriculography revealed a contrast calculated ejection fraction of 38%.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Her cath on [**2164-9-13**] revealed severe 1vCAD s/p PTCA and stenting of the RCA.
Was orthostatic on exam 175 SBP flat--->76 SBP standing.
HCT still 35 but no time for hemodilution.
Pt given 3 units of PRBC with improvement of Hct from 28 to 33.5.
Pt transferred back to floor on [**9-20**], and her hematocrit and vital signs remained stable until discharge on [**9-24**].
Colonoscopy showed only small, non-bleeding sigmoid ulcer, some internal hemorrhoid.
Push enteroscopy (to assess small bowel) was within normal limits.
Serial hematocrits continue to be checked for stability.
ECG with small persistent inferior ST elevation, asymptomatic.
Ectopy on tele, and lytes were continuously repleted.
CLL: Continue hydroxyurea and allopurinol, outpt heme f/u  Diarrhea at OSH: 2 c diff negative during admission.
Diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q12H (every 12 hours) as needed for itching prevention for 10 days: take as needed 30minutes before your antibiotic cefpodoxime to prevent itching.
Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) 20484**],[**Name11 (NameIs) 20485**]  [**Name12 (NameIs) **] appointment should be in 2 weeks  Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**Name11 (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].
