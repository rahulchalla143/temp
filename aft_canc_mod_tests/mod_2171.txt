A staging chest computed tomography scan, head computed tomography scan, and bone computed tomography scan were negative for metastatic disease.
A repeat chest computed tomography scan demonstrated no progression of the disease.
Vital signs were within normal limits.
His neck revealed no supraclavicular or cervical adenopathy.
Vascular examination revealed 2+ pulses throughout and without bruits.
On [**2131-11-13**], the patient was brought to the operating room, at which time an [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy was performed.
The patient's chest tubes put out a good amount of serosanguineous material up until postoperative day six, at which time they were discontinued.
During the postoperative course, the patient's heart rate climbed into the 130s to 140s, at which time he was started on Lopressor.
Because of the patient's extensive history of emphysema, the Lopressor was discontinued and replaced with diltiazem at 360 mg once per day, for which the patient's heart rate came down to the 100s.
Subsequent chest x-rays each day throughout the patient's early postoperative course were consistent with normal postoperative changes without dilatation of the gastric component of the esophageal reconstruction.
On postoperative day eight, secondary to complaints of the patient's shortness of breath as well as the resurgence of the tachycardia, a V/Q scan was performed in order to rule out pulmonary embolism.
The results of the test were low probability for pulmonary embolism.
In addition, the chest x-ray that was done at the time of the complaints of shortness of breath were consistent with a significant left pleural effusion.
