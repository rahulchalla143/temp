Conclusions This is a limited, directed intra-operative TEE to monitor patient during chest exploration and possible closure after dissection repair.
TOTAL CROSS-CLAMP TIME: 108 minutes with 88 minutes for the first cross-clamp time and 20 minutes for a second cross-clamp time.
Postoperatively, she had a diffuse coagulopathy and her chest was left open.
POD#1 her bleeding had slowed down but the covering over her open chest wound appeared to be bulging and clot was suspected to be accumulating in her chest and; therefore, she was brought back to the operating room for a second re-exploration.
POD#4 Renal was consulted for ATN in the setting of hypotension and contrast induced nephropathy as her creatinine peaked approx 72 hours after contrast.
Over the course of the procedure her hemodynamics and urine output deteriorated.
Upon opening up the sternum her hemodynamics improved with her CVP coming down and her blood pressure improving.
Speech and swallow was consulted for evaluation of oral nutrition and ultimately she had no need for trach and PEG placement.
Pt foley was also DC'd on discharge she is making good urine, her last creatinine was 0.8  The patient was evaluated by the speech and swallow service on the day of discharge and was found to be at continued risk for aspiration in her deconditioned state.
