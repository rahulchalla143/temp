She had tests that included liver function tests reported as abnormal.
Ultrasound was obtained on [**7-4**], which raised the question of clot.
The patient had a CT of the abdomen, which revealed a pelvic mass with clot versus tumor, which extended into the right atrium.
She went to [**Location (un) 47**] and had an MRI and was told that it was negative at that time.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 157/68, 95, 14, 90 percent 02 sat on room air.
HEENT examination was unremarkable.
Chest examination lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal examination palpable mass in the lower abdomen, normoactive bowel sounds.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 10.9, hematocrit 42.1, platelets 247, BUN 17, creatinine 1.0, K 3.3.
CTA of the pelvic vessels was negative for embolization.
CT of the abdomen was a pelvic mass with IVC clot versus tumor, which extended to the right atrium.
Liver function test, ALT 330, AST 96, alkaline phosphatase 152, total bilirubin was 0.9.
Cardiology was consulted and echocardiogram was done.
A CA 125 and CEA were obtained.
The patient's initial echocardiogram demonstrated left ventricular cavity size as normal.
The patient underwent transesophageal echocardiogram, which confirmed IVC mass and extension into the right atrium.
The patient's CEA was 19.9.
The MRV, which was done on [**7-8**] demonstrated right gonadal vein was markedly extended secondary to thrombus.
Correlation with recent CT confirms that the thrombus does extend into the right atrium and gadolinium enhanced images demonstrate marked contrast enhancement of the thrombus in the atrial phase prior to arrival of venous return to the inferior vena cava.
The arterial phase images demonstrated a normal appearance in the abdominal aorta, iliac arteries and major aortic branches.
Initial CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate pelvic mass with tumor thrombus extending into the right gonadal vein with extension to the IVC at the level of the right atrial junction with extension into the proximal left renal vein.
The patient's CEA was less then 1, normal range is 0 to 4.
After consultation with the involved services, thoracic, vascular and gyn/oncology it was determined that the patient undergo an abdominal exploration and excision of mass.
Her postoperative hematocrit was 32.9 with a total white blood cell count of 18.1.
Platelets 231, BUN 11, creatinine 0.7.
She had a temperature maximum of 100.7 to 100.2.
Her lung examination was unremarkable.
Her abdominal examination wounds were clean, dry and she had 1 plus edema.
Her white blood cell count showed a downward trend of 16.7, hematocrit 28.1 and platelets of 182.
Lopressor was increased to improve her rate control and her intravenous fluids were decreased.
By postoperative number three the patient still was without flatus, but her hematocrit drifted to 25.6.
Her white blood cell count continued to show improvement at 14.1.
BUN and creatinine were stable.
Lung examination was unremarkable.
Post transfusion hematocrit was 28.4.
