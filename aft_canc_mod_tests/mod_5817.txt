CXR was reportedly normal, but sputum Cx were sent and she was started on vancomycin [**12-16**] and cefepime [**12-17**].
In light of her new hypoxia, she was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of possible PE.

=================== MICROBIOLOGY =================== Sputum from [**Hospital1 **] [**12-16**]:  Gram stain showing mod GNR Blood Cultures 12/8 and [**12-19**] pending Urine Culture [**12-19**] pending Influenzae DFA [**12-19**] negative .
CXR [**12-19**] Question retrocardiac left lower lobe atelectasis versus aspiration versus early pneumonia.
CTA Chest [**12-17**]: 1.
TTE [**12-19**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
She also had a reported sputum culture from [**2153-12-12**] growing Pseudomonas, but her presentation was felt to be less consistent with pneumonia given her lack of fever and leukocytosis.
Other causes of hypoxia were ruled out as follows; CTA was negative for PE, physical exam and TTE were not consistent with heart failure, and influenza DFA was negative.
