He was initially seen at [**Hospital3 **], where CT head showed extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further Neurosurgery evaluation.
In the ED, initial vital signs were T 96.4, BP 120/59, HR 100, RR 18, SpO2 99% on 2L NC.
The patient was seen by Neurosurgery, and CTA head was performed to evaluate for aneurysm.
Infection workup was started with blood cultures, urinalysis, urine cultures, and CXR.
His urinalysis was bland with WBC 1, few bacteria, negative nitrite, and negative leukocyte esterase.
CXR showed bibasilar opacities likely atelectasis though aspiration could not be excluded.

CT HEAD ([**2132-7-7**]): SAH grossly unchanged with small amount of hemorrhage in occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle, likely redistribution of blood.
ECHO ([**2132-7-7**]): The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CT head ([**7-13**]): Interval mild decrease in bilateral subdural and subarachnoid and prenchymal hemorrhages.

# Febrile Neutropenia, Bacteremia, CLL He was reportedly febrile for several days prior to his presentation, and was febrile to 102.7 on arrival in the ICU.
Blood cultures eventually grew Listeria.
Surveillance cultures were drawn, blood cultures cleared after the first day.
Given the presence of a murmur on exam and bacteremia, patient underwent TTE, which revealed no vegetations.
Surveillance labs should be done weekly and faxed to ID at [**Hospital1 18**] and his oncologist--instructions attached in discharge plan.
His last treatment was [**2132-5-15**].
CTA brain did not show evidence of an aneurysm.
Neuro checks were done q1hour and then increased to q4hours.
Three repeat head CTs showed a grossly unchanged SAH with no shift of midline structures or central herniation.
He will have f/u head CT and appointment with neurosurgery in [**5-21**] weeks.
They suggested that if he should become confused again that carbidopa/levodopa be discontinued as he takes this only for RLS and not parkinson's dz.
