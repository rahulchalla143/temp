The patient had a bone marrow biopsy which showed the presence of sparse megakaryocytes which looked normal, but low in number.
CT scan showed a normal sized spleen with a small infarct.
By the end of his admission he was requiring approximately one bag of platelets per day to keep his count in the 40's.
After 24 hours his count would drift down to the 20's.
The patient was initially transfused with a goal hematocrit of 25.
At this time he has not had a colonoscopy, but once his platelet count improves and he is discharged, he should be seen by gastroenterology in followup for further workup of his GI bleeding.
Once the Foley was changed and the counts were kept at a level above 50, the hematuria resolved.
3)CLL: Bone marrow biopsy did not suggest disease transformation.
By the end of admission, pt's creatinine was stable in the normal range between 0.8 and 1.
His blood sugar remained stable by the end of the admission and steroid dose was decreased.
