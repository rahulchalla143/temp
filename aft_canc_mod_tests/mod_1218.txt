An x-ray of his left hip demonstrated a left femoral neck fracture with displacement.
Blood pressure 128/54.
Heart rate 91.
Respirations 20.
Oxygen saturation 97% on 6 liters face mask.
On HEENT examination his pupils were equally round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Neurological examination he was alert and oriented times three.
He had decreased strength in his left lower extremity, because of pain, and his sensory examination was grossly intact.
He had no peripheral edema and he had 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
INITIAL LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The patient's white blood cell was 16, hematocrit 20.2, platelets 739.
His PT was 13.7, PTT 28.6 and INR 1.3.
Initial serum chemistries demonstrated a sodium of 129, potassium 4.5, chloride 93, bicarbonate 22, BUN 40, creatinine 1.5, glucose 135.
Initial arterial blood gas demonstrated a pH of 7.37, PCO2 74, PAO2 of 46 on 6 liters by face mask.
His serum lactate was 1.1.
They felt that given his recent cardiac catheterization in [**2163-9-16**], which demonstrated normal coronaries and an absence of symptoms, the patient was unlikely to have a flow limiting coronary artery disease.
Although this procedure was uncomplicated from an orthopedics point of view, while in the Operating Room the patient reportedly dropped his oxygen saturation to 75 to 80%.
A repeat chest x-ray done following the procedure demonstrated diffuse, patchy opacification of the right middle and lower lobes consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.
Given the appearance of this chest x-ray and the patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, he was deemed to be a poor candidate for weaning off of mechanical ventilation and was therefore transferred to the MICU for continued monitoring.
A repeat chest x-ray done on [**9-15**] demonstrated marked interval improvements in his right middle lobe and right lower lobe atelectatic changes.
On physical examination, however, his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and the patient was maintaining good oxygen saturation on room air.
Although his hematocrit was found to be 20 on admission he was subsequently transfused a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells throughout the admission and his hematocrit subsequently increased to 32.
Renal:  The patient's BUN and creatinine remained stable throughout the admission.
His creatinine decreased to 0.5 at the time of discharge from the hospital, indicating that he likely had a component of acute renal failure at the time of his presentation to the hospital.
His electrolytes were repleted as needed.
His white blood cell count gradually decreased throughout his hospitalization and he remained afebrile.
