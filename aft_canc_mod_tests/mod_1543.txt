Echocardiogram at that time revealed aortic stenosis, trace AI.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%, critical aortic stenosis with aortic valve area of 0.9 cm squared, dilated aortic root and noncritical lesions of his left main and his left anterior descending coronary artery.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac surgery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.1.
Pulse 62 sinus rhythm.
Respiratory rate 18.
Blood pressure 106/62.
Oxygen saturation 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Weight 109.8 kilograms.
2+ posterior tibial bilaterally, 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Examination of his carotid showed a bilateral radiating murmur.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 29.5, hematocrit 40.8, platelet count 347.
Chem 7 sodium 135, potassium 4.4, chloride 99, bicarb 25, BUN 13, creatinine 0.9, glucose 121.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] for workup for cardiac surgery.
The patient also underwent hematology workup prior to surgery for his history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] and his leukocytosis.
On postoperative day number two the patient was noted to have a white blood cell count of 35.1, which continued to rise into the 50s over subsequent hospital course.
His white blood cell differential was significant for elevated neutrophils without a bandemia.
Chest x-ray was obtained, which showed a large cardiac silhouette and small bilateral pleural effusions.
This was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] and it was decided to obtain an echocardiogram to rule out the possibility of tamponade as the patient had a large amount of bleeding from his chest tube postoperatively.
An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2192-11-6**] postoperative day number five, which showed severely depressed left ventricular function, no pericardial effusion, no evidence of tamponade.
Pulse 75 sinus rhythm.
Blood pressure 101/64.
Respiratory rate 18.
Room air oxygen saturation 95%.
Weight 116 kilograms, which is 7 kilograms up from his preoperative weight.
Breath sounds are decreased at bilateral bases.
LABORATORY DATA FROM [**2192-11-9**]:  CBC, white blood cell count is pending.
Previous white blood cell count from [**2192-11-7**] was 50, hematocrit 29.6, platelet count is pending.
PT 13.5, PTT 27.6.
Chem 7, sodium 132, potassium 4.6, chloride 100, bicarb 26, BUN 21, creatinine 1.0, glucose 141.
Chest x-ray from [**2192-11-6**] shows cardiomegaly, small bilateral pleural effusions unchanged from x-ray of [**2192-11-5**].
Sputum culture [**2192-11-4**] showed mixed oral pharyngeal flora.
Urine culture from [**2192-11-4**] was sterile.
