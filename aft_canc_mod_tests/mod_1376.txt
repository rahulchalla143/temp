A BAL was done and showed mold, with suspicion of Aspergillus (outside record does not state why aspergillus suspected).
He improved on zosyn/voriconazole, and repeat CXR on [**7-2**] showed improvement in LUL infiltrate, but large right sided pleural effusion.
MRI of the brain was ordered, and showed among other findings increased uptake in the pituitary stalk, concerning for pituitary involvement with diabetes insipidus.
During a routine CXR on [**2133-7-19**] he was found to have a fair amount of pneumoperitoneum bellow the diaphragm, this study was repeated on [**7-21**] and the findings  were unchanged.
Of note this was his first x-ray since his CT scan on [**7-8**] which was negative for pneumoperitoneum.
He had an ECHO in [**2133-5-26**] per report gross nl with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and estimated EF of 60%.

Given the clinical history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, imaging findings suggest lymphomatous involvement of the CNS.
CT abdomen [**7-7**]: FINDINGS: A Port-A-Cath terminates in the superior vena cava.
An ill-defined nodule along the left major fissure has a base measuring up to 13 mm with a height of 5 mm (3:31).
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Within the liver, there are several well-defined hypodense lesions.
The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen and right adrenal appear within normal limits.
CT OF THE PELVIS: There is an expansile nearly occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein.
[**2133-7-19**] CXR New pneumoperitoneum highlights the presence of ascites.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 34578**] is a 58yoM with a history of B-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma who presented to an OSH with fever and hypotension, found to have CNS lesions and a cavitating lung infiltrate, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
During a routine CXR on [**2133-7-19**] he was found to have a fair amount of pneumoperitoneum below the diaphragm, this study was repeated on [**7-21**] and the findings were unchanged.
Of note this was his first x-ray since his CT scan on [**7-8**] which was negative for pneumoperitoneum.
His NGT remained to low continuous wall suction.
After identification of the problem, he was reversed with Protamine 50 mg and a head CT was performed to ensure no evidence of intracranial bleed -- it was negative.
On POD 5, Mr. [**Known lastname 34578**] developed relatively sudden onset tachycardia to the 120s and hypotension to a systolic of 70s.
He was fluid resuscitated with several IVF boluses and his pressures were stabilized.
A CXR done at the time showed significant amount of free air -- over the amount one would normally expect as residual from the laparotomy four days ago.
