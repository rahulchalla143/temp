ICU admission:  Patient was admitted postoperative to the ICU for evaluation of shock.
WBC on POD#0 peaked at 29.2 (93%N, 1 band) and declined on subsequent days.
All cultures including blood, line, sputum, and urine had no growth.
Empiric Zosyn was initiated on POD#0 and discontinued on POD#3.
Post op day 7 WBC elevated to 16, pt remained afebrile.
CT done revealed SBO, no abscess.
WBC declined with management of SBO.
Septic shock ruled out by negative cultures and afebrile as above.
HCT declined to 25.
She was subsequently transfused 2U PRBC with posttransfusion HCT 40.
Hct nadired at 27 and patient received 1U PRBC.
She was maintained on asa and coumadin for anticoagulation with plan to d/c asa when INR [**2-16**].
Her INR plateaued at 1.5 but Coumadin was not increased due to concern for high risk of bleed.

TSH was elevated but T4 was within normal limits.
Gen [**Doctor First Name **] (from POD 9):  CT showed SBO - patient was made NPO, NGT & foley placed for decompression, IVFs and TPN started, patient monitored with serial exams.
Initial subjective and clinical improvement was seen as patient was afebrile and WBC decreased.
High output still from NGT, increasing drainage and erythema.
repeat CT scan showed perwistent SBO, no abcess collection.
