She  underwent induction therapy with daunorubicin, vincristine, l- asparaginase, and prednisone and responded well.
She also had a CT scan in [**Month (only) 958**] [**2129**] to discover the etiology of her fevers.
In clinic, she was given 100mg IV hydrocortisone, Ertapenem 1gm IV, tylenol 650mg po after blood and urine cultures obtained.

Hypotension: The patient presented with systolic blood pressure in the high 70s to 80s that was minimally responsive to fluids.
She did not have symptoms of lightheadedness or change in mental status and over the course of her stay her blood pressure returned to her baseline of 90s to low 100s.
Her admission CT chest actually showed an improvement in her ground glass lung opacities from previously and given that she had had a negative BAL within the last month, PCP was [**Name9 (PRE) 1801**] thought to be a low probability.
Eventually a b-glucan test was found to be significantly positive, when tests from previous hospitalizations had only been "intermediate."
She then had a repeat CT of the chest which showed worsening ground glass in the upper lobes.
ID: ID consult service was involved and based on beta-glucan and CT findings and resolution of fevers on Bactrim, determined that the diagnosis could be made without doing another bronchoscopy.
Within two days of starting the bactrim, her LFTs had climbed from a normal level to a maximum of ALT 433, AST 336 (the LFTs continued to rise for a day after the bactrim had been stopped).
On discharge the LFTs had trended downward for 48 hours and on discharge were ALT 317, AST 150.
These were not restarted on her discharge from the hospital, as she had relatively low blood pressures (<120) and was still being actively treated for infection.
Based on your CT scan and one of your blood tests, there is a high chance that these fevers were caused by an infection called Pneumocystis or "PCP".
