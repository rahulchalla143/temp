The MRI revealed "      a large mass over the right renal fossa extending to the   paraspinal muscle and also there was a tumor involving the   thoracic 11 and thoracic 12 vertebral body extending into the   spinal canal, cord compression, and also a tumor involving the   paraspinous muscle.
Partial right nephrectomy in [**1-/2107**] after the patient   presented with hematuria and flank pain to [**Hospital1 **]   Hospital and was found on CT scan to have a 5.1 x 5.8 right   renal mass.
The pathology of the   resected tumor was consistent with the previously resected clear    cell primary.
Posterior cervical fusion, occiput to C5 and left-sided C2   laminectomy and decompression in [**4-/2108**] because of the finding   on MRI of a 2.5 x 3.2 cm destructive soft tissue mass.

During   procedure he was transfused with 2 units of PRBC and his POD#1   hematocrit was 32.
His HCT continued to trend down and on [**2111-10-12**] he      received 2 units of PRBC's for a HCT of 21.7.
Of note, a CT L-spine   [**10-16**] was read as concerning for possible paraspinal abscess.
The neurosurgery team reviewed the CT   films and reported that the changes seen were most consistent   with post-op surgical changes rather than infection.
