PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 120/80, pulse 80, afebrile.
Chest and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination is regular, rate, and rhythm, S1, S2.
Preoperatively, the patient was noted to have laboratory values:  White count of 10.4, hematocrit 24.5, platelet count of 215 following multiple transfusions prior to admission.
Postoperative hematocrit was 23.8.
Postoperatively, the patient was noted to be slightly tachycardic with a pulse of 102.
On postoperative day one, the patient was noted to have a hematocrit which declined to a value of 21.8.
His heart rate was noted to be 140-150.
His pressures were stable at 120/70.
An electrocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated atrial fibrillation.
At that time, CK, troponin, complete blood count, and Chem-10 were all sent.
At that time, the patient was also formally ruled out for myocardial infarction through serial CKs all went over 226, serial troponins that rose to a level of 0.3.
During transport to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient spontaneously converted into a sinus rhythm, and after further review of the electrocardiogram, it was decided that the patient's symptoms are more likely a supraventricular tachycardia versus aflutter and afib.
They also recommended us checking an echocardiogram for ventricular function.
The patient was transferred on Telemetry to the floor, where he is noted to be in a rhythm of atrial flutter versus atrial fibrillation with a rate somewhat tachycardic in the low 100s.
Laboratory values on the 30th which were obtained demonstrated a postoperative hematocrit of 26, potassium of 3.6, magnesium of 2.0, TSH of 0.68, and normal LFTs.
The patient declined further workup or the recommendations which were previously discussed with the Cardiology team.
