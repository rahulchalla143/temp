CT GUIDED CHOLECYSTOSTOMY TUBE REVISION:   CT GUIDED LOCALIZATION:Using informed consent from ultrasound, the gallbladder was localized with CT Fluoroscopy.
CT GUIDED GALL BLADDER DRAINAGE:Under CT guidance, an 8 French pigtail catheter was inserted into the gallbladder.
Comparison is made to ultrasound of [**2120-9-28**] and CT of [**2120-9-29**].
Evaluation of the liver is extremely limited.
The head and tail of the pancreas were not visualized.
A color Doppler images of the gallbladder show no increased flow in the gallbladder wall.
FINDINGS: Again, the exam is limited by patient body habitus.
... ERCP on [**12-3**]: Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
A physical exam was performed.
The patient was placed in the prone position and an endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced under direct visualization until the second part of the duodenum was reached.
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal Major Papilla: A single diverticulum with large opening was found on the rim of the major papilla.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification.
Biliary Tree: A single stricture was seen at the level of the common hepatic duct however extensive cholangiogram was not performed due to the presence of cholangitis.
A single stricture was seen at the level of the common hepatic duct however extensive cholangiogram was not performed due to the presence of cholangitis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly-to-moderately depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent) secondary to hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
