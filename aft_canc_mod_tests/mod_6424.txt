Most recently, a CT scan and PET scan both demonstrated enlargement of the liver lesion to greater than 9 cm.
A CT scan of the chest demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary metastases.
A triphasic CT scan demonstrated a large arterial and hyper-enhancing mass involving segments 5 and 6 of the liver consistent with a biopsy-proven HCC with no further concerning lesions being identified.
Preoperative liver function tests included AST 66, alkaline phosphatase 116, total bilirubin 0.4, albumin 4.7, CEA 2.7, CA-125 9.3, CA19-9 6.
She has undergone thorough preoperative evaluation of her cardiac and cerebrovascular vasculature and has been cleared for surgery.

[**2184-12-20**] CT abdomen/pelvis: 1.
Stable appearance of the resection bed hematoma (heterogeneous collection measuring 9.5 x 6.4 x 7.3 cm) as compared to the CT from [**2184-12-20**].
[**2184-12-30**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph from [**12-25**], there is improvement with decrease in extent of the right-sided pleural effusion.
The clips, the drains projecting over the liver and the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.
Total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase increased post-op: alk phos peaked at 614 on [**12-18**] and T bili at 23.4 on [**12-22**] before starting to decline.
On [**2184-12-20**] WBC rose to 29.3 from 19.0 the day before.
Patient was afebrile; cultures were obtained and were negative.
Drain output had 10,000 WBCs but fluid culture was negative.
Patient received 2u pRBC on [**12-20**] after a decline in HCT to 24.4 as well as 2 u FFP for an INR of 2.7.
A Dobhoff was placed and tube feeds were started for poor oral intake.
On [**12-23**] L blood was noted from JP drain with a decline in HCT to 28.9 from prior 32.8 and was taken to OR for hematoma evacuation.
She required albumin and a fluid bolus for hypotension/low UO, pRBCs for HCT 27.5, and 1 u plts for platelets of 66.
Liver biopsy obtained intra-operatively demonstrated severe cholestasis.
Cultures obtained from the hematoma intra-op grew sparse coag neg staph aureus.
On [**12-27**] 1 FFP, 1 plt, and vitamin K were given for an INR of 2.1, but there was no evidence of bleeding from the JP drains, which had decreased output.
Chest xray demonstrated right greater than left pleural effusion but mild vascular congestion.
She was maintaining her saturations at 96% on 2L NC and appeared more awake and responsive by the late afternoon.
Ammonia level was 51.
