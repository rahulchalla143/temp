<B>RADIOLOGY DATA<B> Cardiac MRI of [**2126-7-22**] Impression: 1.
TTE on [**2126-7-25**]: IMPRESSION: Large tumor mass in the right ventricle with extensive mass infiltration into the right atrium, interatrial septum, and possibly the left ventricular apex.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-8-5**], the current study better defines the valves with no discrete vegetation identified (does not exclude endocarditis if clinically suggested) CT Head w/o Contrast on [**2126-7-28**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage or recent infarction.
CT Chest and Abdomen W/IV contrast on [**2126-8-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
No focal liver abnormality, or other CT finding to explain sudden increase in liver function tests.
<b>PATHOLOGY<b> Kidney, needle core biopsy [**2126-7-23**]: Gross: Involvement by high grade non Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma best classified as diffuse large B-cell type Cytology: Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield.
INTERPRETATION Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a lambda-restricted B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
Bone Marrow Biopsy on [**2126-7-25**]: DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Heart Biopsies [**2126-7-25**]: DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Pericardium biopsies (C-E): -- Fibroadipose tissue with patchy involvement by patient's known B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, high grade.
CSF cytogenetics [**2126-7-30**]: RESULTS: Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield.
B cells are scant in number precluding evaluation of clonality.
Cell marker analysis was attempted, but was non-diagnostic in this case due to insufficient numbers of cells/insufficient amount of tissue for analysis.
1) High grade NHL likely stage 3 or 4: This was diagnosed with a CT guided renal biopsy on [**2126-7-23**].
There was never any signs of [**Last Name (un) **] following the chemotherapy and uric acid peaked at 3.1.
A CT chest performed on [**2126-8-4**] showed interval improvement in the cardiac, pulmonary, and renal masses.
Given the patient's persistent mental status changes, an LP was performed and showed cytology indeterminate for malignancy.
After his MTX levels were within safe limits following this final treatment and his neutropenic nadir begun to recover he was discharged to home with plans to return for further cycles of outpatient CHOP.
Head CT without contrast was negative for bleeding or other acute intracranial pathology.
An LP was performed to evaluate for CNS involvement or infection but cytology was inconclusive and there were no signs of infection.
1/2 blood cultures from a PICC site was positive for gram + cocci in pairs and chains (see management below).
Strep viridans bacteremia: The patient never had a fever but on ICU day 8 an infectious work-up was initiated due to his continued encephalopathy.
At that time, one out of two cultures drawn from his PICC site were positive for gram positive cocci in pairs and chains that were eventually speciated as viridans streptococcus.
Cultures of the PICC catheter tip did not grown any bacteria.
Pericardial effusion: On [**2126-7-25**] an echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion that caused some diastolic collapse of the ventricle.
Pericardial window was chosen over pericardial drain given this was now thought most likely to be a malignant infusion and the risk of recurrence was high.
Drain output gradually decreased and the drain was discontinued when there was only a minimal amount of drainage.
Ultrasound was obtained and revealed a DVT at the PICC site.
Ceftriaxone-Dextrose (Iso-osm) 1 gram/50 mL Piggyback Sig: One (1) gm Intravenous Q24H (every 24 hours) for 16 days.
Initially, the tumor in your heart was causing fluid to collect around the heart so the cardiac surgeons drained this fluid and left a drain in place.
You had one blood culture that grew a bacteria from your blood.
Please call your doctor or report to the emergency room if you have fevers or  chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, increased bleeding, inability to tolerate eating or drinking due to mouth pain or nausea, or any other concerning changes to your health.
