Admission Date:  [**2174-8-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-8-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-11-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Prochlorperazine / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3565**] Chief Complaint: Fevers  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2431**] [**Known lastname **] is a 38yo F ALL s/p double cord blood SCT [**1-/2173**] c/b GVHD, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction attributed to chemotherapy for ALL as well as XRT for [**Year (4 digits) 3242**] (EF 15-20%), embolic CVA now on coumadin, asthma, hypertension and chronic kidney disease, well-known to the [**Year (4 digits) 3242**] service who was just discharged yesterday ([**2174-8-10**]) after a prolonged hospital course for acute on chronic CHF thought be be due to cardiac GVHD and acute on chronic renal failure.
CXR was done and cardiac silloette was increased, concerning for pleural effusion.
Blood (PICC and peripheral) and urine cultures were sent, and she was started on empiric meropenem.
WBC 149,000; received leukapheresis, started on hydroxyurea.
- underwent phase I induction with daunorubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone, L-asparaginase, MTX; phase II with cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, MTX - Bone Marrow Aspirate/Biopsy on [**2172-10-26**] showed no morphologic evidence of residual leukemia - underwent allo double cord blood SCT [**2173-1-11**], course complicated by neutropenic fever and acute skin GVHD - subsequent course has been complicated by pseudomonas pneumonia in [**5-15**], empiric treatment of CMV pericarditis in [**7-15**], chronic nausea and vomiting which has been treated as GVHD with steroids though colonoscopies in [**8-14**] and [**11-14**] were negative for GVHD.
OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: - Embolic stroke in [**3-/2174**] on coumadin - Asthma - Hypertension - Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia - C-section in [**2165**] - Cardiomyopathy due to early anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity [**10/2172**] - Chronic kidney disease stage III/IV, baseline creatinine ~2.0 - Chronic abdominal pain: Her workup so far has included EGD [**2173-9-5**], [**2173-11-5**] with mild signs of gastritis, no GVHD.
Colonoscopy [**2173-8-5**], unremarkable with biospy negative for GVHD, CMV.
She has had multiple CT scans which have demonstrated moderate ascites with interval increase, no drainable fluid collection, diverticulosis, small fat-containing umbilical hernia with mild fat stranding, no bowel obstruction.
RUQ ultrasound revealed ascites, gallbladder wall edema presumably from third spacing, and no biliary duct dilatation.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Admission: VS: T97.9/Tm 102, BP 110/67, HR 86, RR 18, 94% on 2L GEN: AOx3, NAD HEENT: Pupil equal and round.

IMAGING: CXR ([**2174-8-11**]): AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position.
Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of [**2174-8-3**].
The rather general increase of the heart shadow is suggestive of pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary vascular congestive pattern has not changed significantly; however, the previously described patchy and partially confluenting parenchymal densities persist and apparently have progressed further.
Echo ([**2174-8-12**]):  Moderate ?partially loculated pericardial effusion without definite evidence for tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-8-4**], the pericardial effusion is larger.
Serial evaluation is suggested.
Echo ([**2174-8-18**]): There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echo ([**2174-8-23**]): The left atrium appears extrinsically compressed (mildly) posteriorly, possibly by a consolidated posterior pericardial effusion.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
RUQ ([**2174-8-23**]): 1.
#Sepsis: Patient presented to the clinic with fevers to 102; CXR showed increased pulmonary infiltrates and heart size.
She received a dose of meropenem, blood and urine cultures were sent, and she was admitted directly to the ICU.
Bronchoscopy lavage fluid was sent for pan-culture, pneumocystis smear, and CMV screen.
CMV pneumonitis was suspected given previous BAL CMV+.
Microbiology revealed parainfluenza 3, but no other pathogens: sputum bacterial and fungal cultures + BAL cultures/stains/labs were all negative, including negative PCRs for PCP and CMV.
# Hypoxia: Serial CXRs showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates.
#Pericardial Effusion: Admission CXR showed increased heart size, and the echo done on [**2174-8-12**] showed increase in pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade.
Patient's primary cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] was alerted and recommended follow up with echo on [**2174-8-15**].
Follow-up echo showed worsening moderate-to-large pericardial effusion, which was drained by bedside pericardiocentesis.
Pericardial fluid included 30% lymphocytes and 60% macrocytes, cultures negative.
Although she does not carry a diagnosis of cardiac GVHD, this was suspected.
A third follow-up echo showed normal LVEF.
She was euvolemic to slightly volume up on exam with lower extremity pitting edema.
NiCOM maneuvers were performed and a transesophageal Balloon was placed for pleural pressure monitoring.
Following pericardiocentesis her cardiac output improved, repeat Echo was performed, and congestive heart failure was thought not to be the cause of her declining clinical picture.
A repeat ECHO did show worsening right ventricular function.
#Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient baseline creatinine 2.5 - 3.0 with admission Cr of 2.7.
Creatinine continued to rise from 3.0 to 3.7 despite IVF.
She was transiently IV fluid and pressor-dependent with hypotension to 85/45 but maintained BP through most of her ICU stay.
Transfused 1U PRBC for Hct 22 on ICU day 2; post-transfusion Hct 27.
Platelet count remained low but patient did not show signs of coagulopathy.
