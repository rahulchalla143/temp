Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: percutaneous liver biopsy   History of Present Illness: 68 year-old male with recently diagnosed HTN and liver mass admitted for hemodynamic monitoring from intraperitoneal bleed after liver biopsy.
Mass was incidentally discovered on a CT for nephrolithiasis [**2113**], and initially believed to be in pancreas.
CT and MR of the abdomen showed 4x3cm mass to be in caudate liver.
He presented for IR liver biopsy on [**4-24**], which was complicated by small RUL ptx.
He was under observation when HCT dropped from 53 (admit) to 41 this morning.
Of note, HCT was 45 post bx-->41 14 hrs later.
CT abd/pelvis showed subcapsular hematoma, retroperitoneal bleed, blood in pelvis.
AAA 3x3 with minimal prior dissection 3.
Nephrolithiasis (fall [**2179**]) 4.
Arthritis 7.

Technically successful CT fluoroscopic-guided biopsy of periportal/caudate lobe lesion.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2181-4-24**] 3:19 PM CHEST, TWO VIEWS, PA AND LATERAL History of liver biopsy with pneumothorax on post-scan radiograph.
The previous chest radiographs are not on PACS for review.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2181-4-24**] 5:02 PM CONCLUSION: Stable right apical pneumothorax as compared to earlier today at 3:30 p.m. .
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2181-4-24**] FINDINGS: This study was performed in conjunction with the CT fluoroscopic-guided biopsy done on same day ([**2181-4-24**]).
Study was performed to assess feasibility to see if the lesion could be biopsied by ultrasound or CT fluoroscopy.
ECG Study Date of [**2181-4-24**]  4:16:14 PM Sinus rhythm.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2181-4-25**] REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of pneumothorax after liver biopsy.
The small right apical pneumothorax is stable or slightly decreased compared to the previous study giving the expiratory technique of the current exam.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2181-4-26**] CHEST TWO VIEWS PA AND LATERAL History of liver biopsy and pneumothorax.
1) Liver mass:  As above, the patient underwent CT guided biopsy on arrival.
The pathology is still pending at the time of discharge.
His hematocrit on arrival was 53, declining to 45 post-procedure, and then slowly trending down by a couple of points an hour to a nadir of 31.5.
He did not require any red blood cell transfusions, and his hematocrit stabilized at around 32; 32.5 on the day of discharge.
His aspirin had been discontinued 7 days prior to admission, and should not be restarted for at least a week, possibly longer, pending repeat hematocrit check by his PCP.
His oxygenation was never impaired (>95% on room air throughout).
Followup chest x-rays demonstrated improvement/resolution of the pneumothorax.
Disp:*30 patches* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Intrabdominal bleed (subcapsular hematoma of liver, pelvis) Right upper lobe pneumothorax secondary to liver biopsy complications.
Hepatic mass Alcohol withdrawal   Discharge Condition: stable, no signs/symptoms of further bleeding   Discharge Instructions: You had a liver biopsy which resulted in minor collapse of your R lung which is resolving, and some internal bleeding.
You were monitored with serial checks of blood levels which were fine.
