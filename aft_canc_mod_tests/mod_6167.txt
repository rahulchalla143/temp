A cholecystectomy was performed as well as an open liver biopsy given the nodular appearance of his liver, felt to be consistent with cirrhosis.
He was transferred to the medicine service at [**Hospital1 **] where discussion was held concerning transplant given the extent of his liver disease, based on the liver biopsy which showed cirrhosis with moderate activity.
Hepatitis serologies showed immunization against hepatitis A and B with no hepatitis C and the etiology was felt to be alcoholic cirrhosis.
Additionally, his creatinine began to worsen and the renal team was consulted at the onset of the elevation and suspected hepatorenal syndrome in light of the patient's liver disease, an undetectable urine sodium and normal renal ultrasound.
Since liver transplantation was being considered, the decision was made to transfer the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and thus patient was    Past Medical History: Alcoholic Cirrhosis s/p repair of liver laceration Hepatorenal syndrome  Social History: Patient reports heavy alcoholism, but stopped approximately 4 months ago.

Colonoscopy ([**11-25**]): No clear cecal landmarks could be identified.
Impression: Normal mucosa in the colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: CT colonography for evaluation of the right colon and cecum  EGD ([**11-25**]): Tortuous esophagus Blood in the stomach body Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  CT colongraphy ([**11-25**]): Possible flat lesion (vs adherent stool) within the mid to distal one third of the transverse colon.
Colonoscopy ([**11-27**]): A single sessile 8 mm polyp of benign appearance was found in the transverse colon.
Impression: Polyp in the transverse colon (polypectomy) Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Follow-up biopsy results  Biopsy of polyp ([**11-27**]): Fragments of adenoma.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast.
The result of the rest injection study is consistent with the presence of pulmonary arteriovenous shunting (one single bubble in 20 cardiac cycles seen in left atrium).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Head CT ([**12-1**]): There is a 10 mm focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the  right parietal lobe.
Repeat Head CT ([**12-1**]): There has been no interval change since two hours ago.
He underwent a liver biopsy (given the nodular appearance of the liver and no previous dx of cirrhosis) and cholecystectomy.
The liver biopsy showed cirrhosis with moderative activity.
He underwent an extensive workup including 2 colonoscopies with a biopsy of a polyp found to be an adenoma in the transverse colon.
A diagnostic paracentesis showed no evidence of SBP.
Head CT showed a 1 cm acute Rt-parietal hemorrhage.
Repeat head CT showed no change.
Chronic ischemic changes were seen on MRI from [**2144**].
In the MICU he was started on keppra and he underwent an EEG which showed no seizure activity.
He experienced lower GI bleeding on [**12-2**] with Hct drop so 4 units PRBC, 4 units FFP, and 1 unit of plt were given.
Urine was produced immediately and CVVHD was stopped.
On pod 1 ([**12-30**]), he had a temp of 103.
He was pan-cultured with only the urine showing some growth of yeast.
A f/u urine culture was negative.
A liver duplex was ordered.
This was a difficult evaluation of the hepatic artery, with normal waveforms (good systolic upstroke), but decreased velocities, particularly in the left and right hepatic arteries.
Creatinine trended up to 4.9.
Albumin and lasix had been given to increase urine output.
Creatinine started to trend down around pod 8.
Urine output was appropriate.
JP drain output was high initially, but diminished.
Nutren 2.0 was ordered to provide 2400 kcal and 96 grams of protein.
Hct was stable, but had trended down to 25 on [**1-11**].
Two units of PRBC were transfused with a hct increase to 31.
His levels had been ranging between [**11-20**], but decreased on [**1-15**] to 5.9.
