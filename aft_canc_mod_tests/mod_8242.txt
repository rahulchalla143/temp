LINE PLACEMENT  [**2127-6-24**] 4:27 PM  Portable chest radiograph compared to the previous one done the same day at 5:01 a.m.
TTE [**2127-6-24**] 1.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review)of [**2126-5-17**], the pulmonary hypertension is worse.
EKG [**2127-6-24**] Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
No change since the previous tracing of [**2127-5-22**].
EKG [**2127-6-26**] Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response RSR' in V1 Generalized low QRS voltages Since previous tracing of [**2127-6-25**], no significant change .
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2127-6-29**] 10:20 AM  FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the previous study from [**2127-6-24**].
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2127-6-30**] 7:46 PM  COMPARISONS: Comparison is made to [**2127-2-25**].
[**2127-7-3**] ECHO with bubble study 1.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2127-7-6**] 11:08 AM  IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**6-29**] and 14:  Small left and moderate right pleural effusion have improved since [**6-29**].
Ms. [**Known lastname 109973**] was treated with a pressor and boluses of LR with no significant improvement of BP (remained in low 100).
Her repeat HCT showed a further drop.
Her cardiac enzymes were negative.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was negative for adrenal insufficiency.
On the day after admission, the pt's EKG was significant for uniformly low voltages in all leads.
A cardiac ECHO showed moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, a moderate sized pericardial effusion (echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements) with no evidence of tamponade; these findings have been noted on previous ECHO dating back to 10/[**2125**].
The pt's CXR was significant for increased mild asymmetric pulmonary edema (R>L), with increasing small R pleural effusion.
It was noted that her BPs would fall with each administration of narcotics; these were weaned off and her BPs remained stable.
Patient had tachy episodes to 150s-170s x 2 on [**6-25**] & [**6-26**], EKGs showing afib w/RVR.
CXR on [**6-29**] CXR showing effusion and cardiomegaly unchanged from prior.
# Sob/Hypoxia: Likely Multifactorial given patient with known lung disease, b/l pleural effusions, stable pericardial effusion, CHF and volume overload, A.fib with RVR and platypnea-orthodeoxia (see below).
ENT was consulted who performed laryngoscopy which was non revealing.
Upon discharge she was able to ambulate the floor while maintaining her saturations in the low 90s.
Patient noted to desat to low 80s upon sitting up on bed with improvement in her sats to mid 90's when lying supine.
A positional echo was performed however it was negative for ASD/PFO.
Patient was evaluated by the pulmonary service who recommended the above echo as well as [**Doctor First Name **] to r/out CT disease.
She was monitored on telemetry throughout with improvement in HR ranging 80-90s.
On [**6-27**] transfused for Hct 26.4 likely [**2-20**] to post op blood loss.
Her electrolytes remained stable.
