PTT normal at 29.8 and PT was elevated at 18.6.
Her LDH was 1,500.
Her creatinine rose from 1.1 to 2.5 during her admission (nephrotoxic drugs included vanco and CT contrast dye.
Uric acid was normal  Electrolytes were normal and w/o evidence of tumor lysis.
* Her temperature was 38.2 max at the OSH.
Blood cultures x 4 are negative to date by report.
Ucrine culture grew several mixed organisms.
CT [**11-17**] showed diverticulosis and precarinal LAD w/ likely RUL opacity c/w scar.
PTT was normal throughout her stay.
haptoglobin-127 * Total bilirubin elevated up to 2.3, but declined to 1.9 the following day ([**11-20**]) * Bone marrow aspirate by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and on her review, she had increased luekemic blasts, without obvious auer rods.
* On ER presentation [**11-18**] her BP was elevated to 204/92 and she complained of urine discoloration since starting nitrofurantoin for urinary frequency x 1 week.
A bone marrow biopsy revealed acute myeloid leukemia best classified as monoblastic M5a (FAB classification) with >90% cells in her bone marrow being blasts.
No shortness of breath  Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1) Kidney stone 3 years ago 2) GERD 3) MIBI/stress test [**6-26**] -- reportedly unremarkable w/o reversible ischemic changes.
Her hct and platelets were supplemented as needed with transfusions to keep her hct > 25 and platelets > 10.
She also suffered hearing loss, which was initially thought to be secondary to vancomycin.
Benadryl, oxycodone, ativan and other psychoactive drugs were initially discontinued, but her mental status continued to vacillate.
A head CT was negative, but a head MRI ordered [**12-22**] showed a possible infiltration in the right and left frontal lobes and left cerebellum as well as a small CVA in the left frontal lobe.
Her last CBC showed WBC 13.6 (elevation thought to be due to steroids), Hct 33.1 and Platelets differential showed Her mucositis resolved, and her TPN was weaned off and eventually d/c'ed.
The inciting processes likely include pulmonary edema (diastolic dysfunction, as echo [**11-25**] with EF 60-70%, [**1-26**]+ MR) and pneumonia.
She was ruled out for an MI with cardiac enzymes x 5 with a baseline troponin of 0.05.
The increased fluid worsened her volume status and her respiratory status declined with sats at 93%.
Her respiratory status improved with sats at 99% RA with resolution of her LE edema at time of discharge.
This was not treated as her platelets were <50 at the time.
* Renal Failure: On admission, she was found to be in ARF with a Cr 2.6 after a contrast-enhanced CT at the OSH.
Her Cr eventually came down and stabilized at 0.9-1.0 which was reportedly her baseline.
After aggressive diuresis for her CHF, her Cr increased back up to 1.2, but resolved with some fluids and the discontinuation of her diuretics.
She was given cyroprecipitate to increase her fibrinogen to 100 and FFP for procedures.
Hepatitis with Hyperbilirubinemia: Her bilirubin was 2 on admission and trended up to a peak of 5.9.
A RUQ U/S on [**11-30**] was normal.
Her bilirubin began to elevate again and a follow-up RUQ U/S [**12-24**] showed sludge in gallbladder with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or gallstones seen or biliary ductal dilatation.
Her fluconazole was discontinued and her liver enzymes have continued to normalize.
The line was d/c'ed and she has finished a 10 day course of daptomycin since rebound of her ANC to > 500, as recommended by ID.
Surveillance cultures show NGTD.
Central line d/c'ed - tip culture showed NGTD at time of discharge.
Her BP has normalized as her dexamethasone has been weaned.
