-Sensory: No deficits to light touch throughout (remainder of sensory examination deferred given clinical situation).

Micro: Ucx [**4-29**]: pan-sensitive E coli Ucx [**5-9**]: pan-sensitive (except to gentamycin) E coli Ucx [**5-22**]: pan-sensitive (except to gentamycin) E coli Sputum cx [**5-10**]: MSSA, resistent to penicillin BAL [**5-11**]: MSSA as above Catheter tip [**5-11**]: gram positive bacteria Blood cultures 5/28, [**5-12**]: NGTD .
CXR on admission: 1.
Respiratory mechanics were performed immediately and she had a NIF of -34 and FVC of 550cc (which is in [**Doctor Last Name 29943**] contrast to reportedly normal values during admission in late [**Month (only) 547**]).
She was electively intubated for airway protection as respiratory failure was deemed imminent given her examination and respiratory mechanics.
Her exam slowly improved with this.
On day of discharge she had fatiguable ptosis, R > L, diplopia with R gaze and with 10 seconds of sustained upgaze, incomplete abduction her R eye with R gaze, EOM otherwise intact in horizontal plane, and limited upgaze L > R.  She had 4+/5 strength in her neck flexors and 5-/5 in neck extensors, 4+/5 strength in her R deltoid, 4+/5 R finger extensors, and otherwise full strength throughout.
Her ventilation improved with her second course of plasmapheresis, and she was able to wean to CPAP + PS [**11-17**], with trials of trach collar each day (tolerating trach collar for 8-10 hours/day for several days prior to discharge).
She had sputum cultures sent and a bronchoalveolar lavage.
However, on [**5-11**], her blood pressures dropped and she was thought to be in septic shock (see below).
She was treated with vancomycin and meropenem, changed to nafcillin and meropenem after sputum cultures grew methacillin-sensitive staph aureus.
A surveillance urine culture grew E coli for a 3rd time, and was felt to be a colonizer.
7. anemia: Her hematocrit drifted down over several days while she was menstruating.
Iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic inflammation.
