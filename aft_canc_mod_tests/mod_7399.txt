He had already been given a NS bolus in the ambulance for hypotension (to SBP 90) and tachycardia (to 120).
Exam showed no evidence of peripheral edema or DVT.
EKG showed no acute ischemic changes, initial Troponin was negative, and CXR showed chronic interstitial opacities with no evidence of superimposed pneumonia.
Labs were notable for D-dimer [**Numeric Identifier **], proBNP 1484, bicarb 19, lactate 1.7, and platelets 71. .
CTA was not performed due to increased risk of contrast nephropathy in patients with active multiple myeloma.
His chest pain had resolved and his breathing was less labored, but still significantly worse than his baseline.

IMAGING [**6-18**] CTA PULMONARY ARTERIES: The main pulmonary artery proximal to the bifurcation measures 3.5 mm and is dilated.
Calcification in the coronary arteries and the aortic arch is mild-to-moderate .
ABDOMEN: Study is not tailored for evaluation of the abdomen; however, limited views revealed non-calcified plaque measuring 1.7 x 0.9 cm in the abdominal aorta (3:75) along the posterior wall causing less than 50% narrowing of the aortic lumen.
All these changes were previously seen and better characterized on the MR imaging of spine dated [**2181-5-7**] and are consistent with known underlying clinical diagnosis of multiple myeloma.
[**6-16**] CXR There are coarsened interstitial markings again noted within the lungs, most notable in the right upper lobe, left lower lung, which likely represent scarring related to interstitial lung disease.
[**6-17**] CXR Heart size is normal.
[**6-18**] CXR The lungs are low in volume and show bilateral diffuse interstitial opacities.
[**6-15**] EKG : Sinus arrhythmia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2181-5-8**] no change except rate is faster.

Initial ABG showed respiratory alkalosis with 7.48/20/53, improved at 7.42/34/162 with supplemental oxygen.
LENI study negative for LE DVT.
Patient was bridged initially with heparin but changed to lovenox due to fluctuating PTT levels between 56 and 114.
For the three days up to his discharge, the INRs were 1.8, 1.9, 2.4.
The plan for outpatient is to maintain Lovenox overlapped with therapeutic INR for at least 48 hours total.
Lung exam improved and patient felt more comfortable.
Low Plt count initially thought to be related to his multiple myeloma and recent chemotherapy, but primary oncologist suggested it may also be secondary to bactrim, which was recently stopped as outpatient prophylactic therapy.
At the time of discharge his platelet count was 141. .
SPEP, immunoglobulin, serum light chains, and b2-microglobulin were pending at discharge, value to be followed up by medical oncologist.
His blood glucose became elevated after he was started on prednisone.

Insulin Treatment Please follow attached Humalog Sliding Scale Insulin as outlined on attached Sliding Scale Form 14. warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM: Please continue to monitor for INR goal [**12-28**] and adjust PRN, monitor [**Date range (1) 11067**] daily and then space 2x weekly for monitoring .

IF INR [**6-30**] is <2, need to continue until have 2 consecutive INR daily levels 2-3 range.
INR INSTRUCTIONS If INR 2-3 range 8/6, overlap enoxaparin 100mg SC BID for an additional 24 hours then discontinue.
IF INR [**6-30**] is <2, need to continue until have 2 consecutive INR daily levels 2-3 range and then may discontinue with patient managed on Coumadin alone with ongoing monitoring.
You were seen in the emergency room for chest pain and subsequently admitted into the intensive care unit for low blood oxygen levels and low blood pressure.
From a chest x-ray and your difficulty breathing, you received antibiotic treatments for suspected infections while in the emergency room.
You were admitted into the intensive care unit because of your low oxygenation and concerns for pulmonary embolism, an illness involving a blood clot in the lungs that causes the heart to work harder and prevents the body from getting enough oxygen.
You received a chest CT which confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
Ultrasound revealed no clots in either leg.
Your blood pressure and heart rate were consistently within the normal range.
Your oxygen levels were routinely checked and managed using steroids until it became stable on oxygen.
Followup Instructions: 1) Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31097**] on [**2181-7-23**] at 2:40pm.
