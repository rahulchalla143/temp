Given h/o malignancy, a CTA was done which was negative for PE, stable adenopathy/dilated esophagus with esophageal wall thickening/air fluid levels/distal air and ?obstruction.
In the ICU, the patient underwent EGD which showed partially digested food boluses in the distal esophagus with esophagitis.

Pulmonary vascularity remains within normal limits.
Impression: Little change from prior study with persistent small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
Endoscopy showed food stuck in the distal esophagus which was removed.
She was started on a PPI [**Hospital1 **] and will followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from GI for a repeat endoscopy in 2 weeks once inflammation improves.
There was inflammation of the esophagus and you will need a repeat endoscopy to make sure this inflammation has resolved.
