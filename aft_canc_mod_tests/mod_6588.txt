Imaging: CTA [**2157-6-10**] 1.
Non-opacification of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery, could be secondary to the compression from the mediastinal mass, but cannot exclude pulmonary embolism or thrombosis in the right upper lobe.
A chest CT done on [**2157-6-10**] showed complete airway obstruction on the right upper lobe bronchus and proximal left main bronchus.
On [**2157-6-13**] she had flexible bronchoscopy to evaluate Y stent placement and therapeutic aspiration of secretions.
Her preliminary pathology showed SCLC.
CK was 24 so not thought to be due to statin myalgia.
Had ECHO which demonstrated hyperdynamic EF and mild diastolic failure (LVH).
Patient had CT scan to eval whether other etiology which demonstrated: no PE, b/l small pleural effusions, no PNA.
