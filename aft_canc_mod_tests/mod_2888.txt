On [**2108-1-21**] he had rigid bronchoscopy with Y stent placed in trachea/right/left mainstem.
Patient diuresed with 80 mg lasix, placed on nitro (to which patient's BP dropped to 80s), placed on BIPAP (to which he responded well).
Repeat ABG was 7.35/44/70.
Respiratory compromise - Initially he did well on BIPAP.
His bronchial lavage gram stain showed 4+ gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
His repeat bronchoscopy on [**2108-1-23**] showed patent stent.
He was given fluid boluses to try to slow his rate as his BP was low and could not tolerate beta blockade.
