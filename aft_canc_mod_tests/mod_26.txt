the abd protrusion was palpated and had crepitus and could be reduced, so no action was taken and mass was thought to be a hernia at that time.
Creatinine was elevated to 2.1 and this thought to be [**1-18**] poor renal perfusion.
Renal u/s was negative for obstruction.
Her hct was 17.5 at midnight and pt received 2 units PRBC, repeat hct was 24.8.
After colonoscopy, abdominal protrusion was over twice as large as in the AM and continued to progress rapidly throughout day.
It developed a bluish appearance - surgery was consulted and pt sent for non con CT which showed a hematoma.
Repeat Hct after CT was 21.0, so pt given another unit of PRBC and also transfused 1 unit FFP, and 100mg cryoprecipitate.
Cr was down to 2.0 after albumin but jumped again in the PM to 2.3, likely [**1-18**] ongoing blood loss.
Patient transfused 2u PRBC's for Hct 25 in setting of active bleeding.
Direct pressure applied to LLQ.
on [**7-7**] U PRBC given, started 1/2cc per cc replacement of JP output.
on [**7-8**], 2u FFP given for INR 1.7.
CXR was consistent with flash pulmonary edema.
IVF repletion of JP output resumed at 1/2cc per cc ratio.
Overnight, she had a burst of tachycardia to the 170s, EKG unchanged and troponin was negative.
Lactulose was provided and an MRI brain revealed no evidence of anoxic brain injury.
Liver was consulted, and felt since imaging showed patent TIPS that UGIB from portal HTN was unlikely.
Hct was stable by call out of MICU.
HCT fell from 34.4 to 28.7 and BRBPR was noted.
On the AM of [**6-23**] she underwent an endoscopy also without evidence of a bleeding source.
She was given broad spectrum ABx (Vanc/Zosyn) and the only culture which grew out was MSSA in her sputum.
Echo was normal.
Renal failure: Felt to be ATN due to hypotension vs HRS vs mild rhabdomyolysis given mildly elevated CK's.
Repeat U/S on [**2119-7-15**] again showed patent TIPS  8.
AFib: She had an episode of AFib with RVR that flipped back to NSR with IV Metoprolol.
