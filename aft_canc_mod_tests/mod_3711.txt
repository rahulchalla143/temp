BMBx was consistent by report with myelodysplastic syndrome with presence of a 15-20% immature cells consistent with blasts; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt the pathology was consistent with MDS with excess blasts in transformation, suggesting acceleration of the disease towards acute leukemia.
Pt underwent induction and reinduction with single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] clofarabine per protocol 07-013, last treated in 09/[**2116**].
Since that time, he showed signs of dysplasia was dropping cell lines and bone marrow biopsy done in [**9-/2118**] showed blasts occurring in small clusters occupying an estimated 20% of the marrow cellularity.

Right Upper Lobe Pneumonia/Fever: Right upper lobe pneumonia on CT scan.
Repeat CT scan of the chest on [**12-2**] showed improvement of disease but not complete resolution.
Patient was continued on prednisone 20mg daily, Diphenhydramine 25mg Q6hrs, and Prevacid 20mg Q12hrs.
EKG showed T wave flattening, but these changes resolved after normalization of symptoms, and cardiac enzymes were negative.
Patient's blood counts monitored daily, with transfusion if needed.
Emphysema demonstrated on CT scan.
