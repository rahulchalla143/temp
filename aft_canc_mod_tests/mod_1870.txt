Blood cultures from [**Date range (1) 29927**], [**3-15**], [**3-16**], all no growth  Imaging Studies: [**2174-3-9**] ECG - Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
[**2174-3-9**] V/Q Scan - IMPRESSION: Low likelihood ratio for PE.
[**2174-3-9**] CXR AP - IMPRESSION: Relatively stable x-ray examination given differences in depth of inspiration and technique.
[**2174-3-10**] Transthoracic ECHO - The left atrium is moderately dilated.
An eccentric, posteriorly-directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen ([**Last Name (un) **] 0.2 cm2, regurgitant volume 26 ml/beat).
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2165-3-13**], left ventricular systolic function has deteriorated.
[**2174-3-10**] CXR PA & LAT - FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little interval change.
[**2174-3-11**] Transesophageal ECHO - No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %).
[**2174-3-12**] Renal Ultrasound - IMPRESSION: 1.
Son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign was negative.
[**2174-3-15**] Renal Scan - IMPRESSION: Severe impaired bilateral renal function.
[**2174-3-15**] RUQ ultrasound - IMPRESSION: Moderately distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis, not significantly changed, but with no specific features for cholecystitis.
[**2174-3-16**] CT abdomen/pelvis, non-contrast - IMPRESSION: 1.
Bilateral renal cysts, not fully evaluated given lack of IV contrast.
[**2174-3-17**] PICC line placement - ADDENDUM: On review of this study in conjunction with the frontal and lateral chest radiographs, the right PICC is identified terminating in the lower SVC or cavo-atrial junction.
# Sepsis, bacteremia, hypotension: The patient had high grade bacteremia, with blood cultures from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] turning positive approximately 12 hours after admission to [**Hospital1 18**], eventually yielding MSSA.
Admission blood cultures from [**Hospital1 18**] as well as multiple joint aspirations all grew out MSSA.
The source for initial bacteremia was not clear and transesophageal ECHO showed no evidence of endocarditis.
Per recommendations from the infectious disease team, the patient was empirically treated with nafcillin for 6 days and then switched to a combined regimen of ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and flagyl starting the evening of [**3-15**] when his surveillance blood culture from the day prior grew gram negative rods in the anerobic culture bottle (eventually grew B. fragilis).
The patient also required aggressive IV fluid resuscitation on presentation to support his blood pressure and intermittantly required pressors as well.
Subsequently, he had difficulty weaning from the ventilator, initially due to fluid retention in the setting of agressive IV fluid hydration required to support his blood pressure (he was 17L positive over his length of stay), as well as underlying COPD.
Initially this was felt to be pre-renal in the setting of sepsis and hypotension and urine lytes were consistent with this hypothesis.
Over time, however, his creatinine continued to rise and urine studies became consistent with ATN.
No urine eosinophils were identified, thus it was unlikely AIN due to nafcillin.
Initial renal ultrasound suggested right-sided hydronoephrosis and urology was consulted, however, non-contrast CT scan subsequently showed no hydronephrosis.
Of note, the patient has a mass lesion on the left previously seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at BIDN.
His creatinine finally stabilized in the 4+ range.
When the aspirations showed bacteria on gram stain, the steroids were decreased, but then increased again per rheumatology recommendations for gout and slowly tapered off.
All joints tapped had GPCs on gram stain and eventually grew MSSA.
Abdominal ultrasound noted sludge in the gallbladder, no other findings were noted.
LFTs, amylase, lipase, were all within normal limits and Tbili was mildly elevated.
Follow-up non-contrast CT scan of the abodmen and pelvis did not reveal any cause.
Contrast CT scan could not be performed secondary to renal failure.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
# Colon Cancer: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest on last CT scan.
Further evaluation was deferred until his acute illness could resolve.
Local wound care, frequent turns, special mattress, and close monitoring for areas of peripheral necrosis were performed.
