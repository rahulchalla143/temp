LAD was occluded, LMCA 60% ostial occlusion and 80% mid.
LCX 80% mid and RCA occluded.
- Mild MR secondary to Cerebral Palsy - Prostate cancer, with radiation proctitis secondary to XRT - Status post left wrist fusion.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 8 cm while supine CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
PULSES: Right: 1+ DP Left: 1+ DP   Pertinent Results: Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2127-7-23**]  COMMENTS: 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right-sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 11 mmHg.
There was severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA systolic pressure of 88 mmHg; however, this must be interpreted in the context and severe left-sided volume overload with a mean baseline PCWP of 40 mmHg.
There is mild systemic systolic arterial hypertension with an SBP of 139 mmHg.

Patient had catheterization today showing diffuse CAD with elevated PCWP and pulmonary edema.
Patient denied symptoms; however, his exam was positive for diffuse crackles with decreased breath sounds at bases and elevated JVP.
He had adequate oxygen saturations on 2L NC, and his BP was stable.
He was fluid overloaded on exam and the overall goal was to diurese.
His blood pressure decreased to low-normotensive and his creatinine was 1.2.
The patient's outpatient provider should consider starting a beta-blocker pending normal heart rate and blood pressure in the future as the patient has systolic congestive heart failure with a low ejection fraction.
#CAD: Cath showed 3 vessel disease with likely ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Last echo showed EF between 20-25%.
He had a creatinine of 1.2 at time of discharge.
You were admitted to us after an ultrasound evaluation of your heart showed decreased function, in addition to your symptoms of shortness of breath.
A diagnostic cardiac catheterization allowed us to evaluate the coronary arteries and showed you had several blockages in your vessels that were causing your symptoms and decreased your heart function.
