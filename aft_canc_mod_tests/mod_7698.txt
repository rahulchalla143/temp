CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2147-10-9**] 5:08 PM FINDINGS: There has been interval left parieto-occipital craniotomy, with overlying skin staples and mild pneumocephalus.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2147-10-10**] 10:22 AM IMPRESSION: Status post left occipital craniotomy and tumor resection with expected postoperative changes.
CT head scan there revealed a large left parietal mass with signifcant mass effect.
He was administered mannitol and dexamethasone and a CTA head showed increased vascularity is mainly from the left PCA.
Postoperatively the patient was extubated and transferred to the ICU for Q1 hour neurochecks and SBP control less than 140.
Post op CT was stable, without evidence of hemorrhage and postop MRI demostrated subtotal resection of tumor.
