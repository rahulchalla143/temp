About 1-year-ago, blood work at PCP's office showed evidence of hematologic malignancy.
Patient decided to forgo traditional work-up and treatment at that time and instead pursued homeopathic remedies with a naturalist (including injections of [**7-18**]-X compound).
Bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry were indicative of CLL.
A code stroke was called in context of acutely abnormal neuro exam; CTA head showed possible filling defect in MCA territory.
Neuro was also concerned about possibility of septic emboli on CT and recommended MRI.
Patient was noted to have a WBC count of 23.4 (which is significantly decreased from prior).
Past Medical History: --Hypertension (though improved since losing weight) --Obesity: s/p 87 pound weight loss --Anxiety --s/p 2 C-sections  Social History: Married, 4 children.
No FH or leukemia or lymphoma  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 102.2 BP: 124/66 P: 113 R: 33 SPO2: 94% 3L General: lethargic, moderate respiratory distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, multiple crusted lesions on bottom lip.
CV: tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  firm, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, +BS, non tender, nondistended.
EEG [**6-1**]:: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling showed a diffusely slow and disorganized background consisting of mixed theta and delta frequencies reaching up to [**6-11**] Hz.
EEG [**5-31**]:  This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
MRI [**2153-5-24**]: 1.
CSF [**2153-5-24**]: Abundant neutrophils, lymphocytes and some macrophages, consistent with acute menigitis.
ECHO [**2153-5-29**]: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

# FEVERS/ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: # S. Pneumonia Meningitis # Necrotic Lymphadenopathy # Seizure Disorder   Clinical picture and lumbar puncture consistent with meningitis; this is an immunocompromised patient with high fevers, altered mental status, and abnormal neurologic exam.
Blood and CSF cultures were positive for strep pneumonia, while HSV was suspected (had herpetic lip lesion).
CT imaging of the neck revealed large, necrotic lymphadenopathy, presumably related to an intense lymphatic reaction to systemic disease.
Upon transfer to BMT, blood cultures had cleared.
A CTA of patient's head showed a question of an MCA infarct.
However, a subsequent MRI showed no evidence of acute ischemia.
Multiple fundoscopic exams consistent with retinal hemorrhage.
Right vitrectomy was performed, and vitreous samples were sent for culture and cytology.
#  RESPIRATORY STATUS:  Patient presented with tachypnea but her ABGs were within normal limits.
