FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
The wound culture grew out pan-sensitive Serratia.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
ID: The patient's white blood count was 9 on admission and on repeat check came down to 7.
Wound care was [**Hospital1 **] wet-to-dry dressing changes with Xeroform over his superior auricle,this remained stable throughout his stay with clear signs of regression of erythema.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required.
He had a foley in place to monitor urine output closely.
His flap checks were hourly and his vioptix and doppler signals remained stable.
A venous doppler study was negative for thrombus.
Flap vioptix and dopplers remained stable.
Flap checks remained stable and pain well controlled.
An EKG was recommended to get baseline QT interval as seroquel and ciprofloxacin can cause QT prolongation.
Patient will have follow up EKG on Wednesday, [**4-10**] as an outpatient.
The posterior chest incisions was clean/dry/intact and flat.
