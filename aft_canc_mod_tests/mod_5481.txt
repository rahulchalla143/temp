ED COURSE: VS 97.3, 91, BP 115/88, RR 16, O2Sat 99RA.
A CXR was done, that showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
An EKG was done unchanged from prior.
IR was [**Name (NI) 653**], and [**Name2 (NI) **] underwent CT imaging of head and chest.
Onc Hx: Mr. [**Known lastname 72663**] is a 48-year-old gentleman who was diagnosed with AML-M5B in [**4-/2116**] when he was admitted with a white blood count of 200,000, requiring leukophoresis.
He developed hepatic candidiasis which was treated successfully with oral Diflucan, which delayed his allogeneic stem cell transplant, but then he underwent matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplant with Cytoxan and TBI conditioning on [**2116-8-25**].
He did relatively well post-transplant until [**10/2116**] when he developed left upper lobe and bilateral opacities with he underwent BLL, which was nondiagnostic and then proceeded to VATS biopsy with a diagnosis of acute and organizing pneumonia.
CT scan showed new right upper lobe hazy infiltrate and nasal aspirate was positive for RSV.

********* RADIOLOGY ********* Admission CXR [**2116-2-1**]: A right-sided subclavian catheter is detected with tip in the proximal-to-mid [**Month/Day/Year 17911**].
CTA Chest [**2117-1-31**] 1.
ECHO [**2117-2-1**] The left atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-9-17**], the patient is now tachycardic, the left ventricular cavity appears small and systolic function is hyperdynamic.
EKG [**2117-2-1**] Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2117-1-31**] the ventricular rate is faster.
Rate 108, PR 138, QRS 88, QT/QTc 336/420, P 73, QRS 22, T 68 .
PTA VENOUS Study Date of [**2117-2-2**] PROCEDURE NAME:  [**Date Range 17911**] venogram and PTA [**Date Range 17911**] stenosis.
Followup venogram after balloon dilatation demonstrated segmental stricture at mid [**Date Range 17911**] and thrombus in upper [**Date Range 17911**] with multiple collateral veins.
Balloon dilatation was then performed with an 18 mm x 4 cm balloon catheter.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-2-4**], the pericardial effusion is similar in size.
However, abnormal repirophasic variation of right venrticular inflow, and mild apical right ventricular diastolic invagination, are now present, consistent with early cardiac tamponade.
In the upper lobes bilaterally, in a predominantly bronchovascular distribution, there is new airspace opacity and bronchial wall thickening, right greater than left.
Previously noted thrombus within the upper [**Year/Month/Day 17911**] is more difficult to evaluate on today's exam due to timing of contrast bolus, but is probably still present, although it appears slightly decreased in size, now occluding approximately half the vessel lumen at the level of the top of the aortic arch (3, 33).
Likely slight decrease in extent of partially occlusive thrombus in the upper [**Hospital1 17911**], although timing of contrast bolus in this study is suboptimal for evaluation of this region.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-2-10**], the effusion is slightly smaller.
[**2117-2-16**] CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST 1.
The abnormality can be visualized on a chest x-ray and so if the patient's clinical symptoms are stable or are actually improving then follow up by chest radiograph can be performed.
In the ED, he was stable, BP 115/88, HR 91, RR 16, O2Sat 99RA.
EKG was done unchanged from prior.
Pulsus paradoxicus was consistently 8 mmHg prior to transfer to the [**Name (NI) 3242**] unit; EKG was without alternans and ECHO was without evidence of tampondade.
For a HCT 25, he was tranfused 1 unit pRBCs, and tachycardia improved 120s-->100.
Respiratory rate remained stable at approximately 24 and patient has stable dyspnea on exertion but no hemodynamic compromise or right ventricular dilation or strain.
# Pericardial effusion: An ECHO on [**2-4**] revealed a small to moderate pericardial effusion with Right atrial invagination during diastole however no RV collapse, again a hyperdynamic LV.
Upon transfer the patient was found to be normotensive with a SBP consistently above 130 and a pulsus of 4 to 6.
He was tachycardic with a rate in the 120s, with a 500cc bolus of NS and continual rate of 100cc/hr of NS his rate responded and slowed slightly to 100-110.
A repeat ECHO on [**1-/2038**] revealed more right sided compromise, the size of his effusion was unchanged by ECHO but there was mild diatolic invagination of the apical portion of the RV free wall and significant accentuated respiratory variation in the tricuspid but not mitral valve inflow consistent with impaired filling.
Serial ECHO showed decreased in pericardial effusion and no evidence of tamponade physiology.
The etiology of the pericardial effusion was unclear but per echo did not seem to be blood however this evaluation was limited.
On [**2117-2-7**] the patient spiked to 100.3 and given bilateral apical infiltrates on CT chest, he was started on vancomycin in addition to levofloxacin.
Bronchoscopy was performed on [**2117-2-12**].
No organism was isolated on BAL microbiology studies or from other sputum samples.
Repeat imaging showed improvement in the bilateral apical opacities.
# Pleural Effusions Large to moderate bilateral pleural effusion increased from admission were noted on CT chest on [**2117-2-7**].
Thoracocentesis was performed on [**2117-2-12**].
No microorganisms were isolated from the pleural fluid, and flow cytometry/cytology of the fluid sample did not reveal neoplastic cells.
Repeat CT chest on [**2117-2-16**] showed considerable decrease in the pleural effusions bilaterally.
On [**2-14**], the patient's creatinine rose to 1.1 and on [**2-16**] was 1.3.
The acute renal failure was likely due to supratherapeutic vancomycin levels in the setting of contrast nephropathy.
Creatinine remained stable upon discharge, 1.3.
Pulmonary embolism 5.
You will need close followup for blood work measuring your INR.
You also developed a pericardial effusion and pleural effusion, which is fluid around your heart and lungs respectively.
You blood pressure will be rechecked in clinic tomorrow morning, and amlodipine will likely need to be restarted as an outpatient.
Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8129**].
Please followup at the [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] 7/outpatient clinic 9:00 AM on [**2117-2-19**] for blood draw to check your renal function, electrolytes, coagulation panel, and cyclosporin level.
You blood pressure will also be measured at this time.
