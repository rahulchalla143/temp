PET CT on [**2178-7-9**] showed R lung collapse, intense uptake at distal trachea and proximal R mainstem bronchus.
Bronchoscopy on [**2178-7-22**] revealed complete malignant right sided airway obstruction with growth of the tumor through the mesh of the stent.
Biopsy was positive for SCC.
Her vent settings were downtitrated to PEEP 5 and FiO2 of 50%, satting 97%.
Past Medical History: Stage IIIB NSCLC diagnosed by transbronchial biopsy in [**8-10**].

It was noted that she had a pericardial effusion on the CT scan, which cardiology came to evaluate with echo and determined that there were no signs of tamponade.
She had a repeat imaging that showed mildly improved ventilation of the right lung (though still largely collapsed [**2-3**] to tumor).
