[**2154-4-27**] 11:18AM CHEMISTRY Amylase, Ascites 6 IU/L   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2154-4-18**] under Dr.[**Name (NI) 9886**] care.
#Respiratory The patient was transferred to the SICU from the floor for O2 saturation in the 70s and HR >120.
ABG was PO2 38, PCO2 49, pH 7.41.
A chest X-ray showed LLL consolidation, atelectasis and effusion.
She required a face mask and careful monitoring of her respiratory status.
#Hypotension She was hypotensive immediately post-op BP 80's and was on a Neo drip and IVF, which improved.
Her staples were D/C'd POD 13.
A chest CT showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
An ECHO was done that showed moderate to severe regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
A EKG showed changes, troponin was 0.05 x 2.
