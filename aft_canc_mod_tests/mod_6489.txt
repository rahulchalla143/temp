IMAGING STUDIES:  CT HEAD [**2197-9-11**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2197-9-11**] CT OF ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: The visualized lungs are clear without nodule or masses.
This lesion which is arising from the right 12th rib is compatible with metastasis (2:11).
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a large irreguylar mass arising from the anterior bladder wall measuring approximately 8.2 (tr) x 4.6 (AP) x 9.6 (CC) cm.
Recommend MRI for further evaluation as clinically warranted.
MR LUMBAR SPINE [**2197-9-11**] FINDINGS: There are multiple metastatic masses throughout the imaged bones.
There is an at least 3.5 cm mass in the inferior sacrum, partially imaged on the sagittal images only, which extends into the presacral soft tissues, as seen on the concurrent abdominal/pelvic CT scan.
At L4/5, there is a disc bulge and a central disc protrusion, which does not contact any nerve roots.
Given the patient's symptoms, sacral plexus protocol MRI of the pelvis would be helpful for evaluation of the sacral plexus.
Smaller disc protrusions from T8/9 through T11/12 cause only mild spinal canal narrowing without compression.
Recommend chest CT for more complete evaluation.
LUNG SCAN [**2197-9-14**]: INTERPRETATION: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate central clumping of the tracer, consistent with diffuse airway disease.
Perfusion images in the same 8 views show heterogeneity in a sub-segmental distibution, also most likely due to airways disease.
Chest x-ray shows hyperinflation without evidence of pneumonia.
CXR [**2197-9-14**]: PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Compared to prior study, is increasing opacity in the medial aspect of right lower lung.
MR HEAD [**2197-9-17**]: Comparison is made with CT head from [**2197-9-11**].
CXR [**2197-9-17**]: PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was compared to [**9-14**], [**2196**].
CT and MRI demonstrate diffuse lytic lesions of the calvarium, all levels of the spine, bilateral femurs and ribs.
CT of the pelvis demonstrates a 8.2 x 4.6x 9.6 cm bladder mass, as well as, bulky pelvic lymphadenopathy highly suggestive for a bladder cancer.
This is further supported by urine cytology demonstrating  atypical keratinizing squamous cells.
The urology consult team felt that bladder biopsy should be obtained by interventional radiology rather than via cystoscopy due to the risk of bleeding with cystoscopy.
The team suggested vertebroplasty for the T2 fracture rather than surgery given the widespread nature of disease.
The orthopedic trauma team saw the patient in regards to his femur lesions and recommended IM rod for the right femur given the large size of the bony metastasis and the risk of fracture.
At time of transfer free calcium is 1.35 and total calcium is 11.1.
3)Pneumonia:A CXR on [**9-14**] showed possible right sided infiltrate concerning for pneumonia.
That patient was initially treated for community acquired pneumonia with Levaquin,however, white count continued to increase and patient's oxygen requirment became greater so his antibiotic coverage was switched to vancomycin and zosyn on [**9-15**].
At time of discharge patient is afebrile and oxygen saturation is stable on room air -mid 90's.
4)Urinary Tract Infection: Urine positive for pansensitive E.Coli.
Calcium has trended down following this treatment though free calcium remains elevated at 1.35 and total calcium of 11.1.
Serum sodium resolved and remains stable at time of transfer.
Iron studies demonstrated normal iron level and ferritin with low TIBC and transferrin.
He was transfused 1 unit PRBC on 10/0 for HCT of 21.7.
Hct remained stable >21 for rest of admission.
Albumin 2.4 and INR elevated (1.4-1.6)at time of transfer.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).

Piperacillin-Tazobactam Na 4.5 g IV Q8H 9.
Further testing and imaging revealed that you have a metastatic cancer, which we believe to be bladder cancer.
