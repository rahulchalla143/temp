His last bone marrow biopsy showed complete response.
His ANC was 100 and he received 1 U PRBC for chemotherapy induced anemia.
This morning he felt cold and took his temperature which was 100.5.
In ER, he had blood cultures x2, urine culture, chest x-ray and received Cefepime 2 gm IV and Tylenol.
VITAL SIGNS: Temperature is 100.6, O2 saturation is 98% on room air, pulse is 84 and blood pressure is  110/68.
CHEST: Clear to auscultation and percussion.
Pertinent Results: Admission labs: WBC 0.4, Hgb 10.6, Hct 29.9, platelets 68, ANC 70, BUN 13, Cr 1.0, Na 135, K 3.3, Cl 99, HCO3 27, AG 12.
CXR [**2147-8-19**]: The heart size is normal.
TTE [**2147-8-20**]: There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
LV systolic function appears depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-8-18**], biventricular systolic function is now worse.
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**2147-8-20**]: CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  The pulmonary arteries opacify without filling defects.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver enhances without focal lesions.
Comparison to previous studies would also be helpful.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Multiple surgical clips are present in the pelvis.
The rectum, sigmoid, and large bowel is within normal limits.
Gallbladder US [**2147-8-21**]: The gallbladder is normal in appearance, with no evidence of cholecystitis or gallbladder wall thickening.
Labs at time of discharge: WBC 1.5 ANC 600 Hct 32 Plt 360 INR 1.1 Na 142 K 3.6 Cr 0.7 Ca 8.2 Mg 1.8 Culture data negative     Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit for treatment of neutropenic fever.
Initially on the floor the patient was stable with BP 110/70.
Overnight however, the patient became hypotensive with bp 80s/50s.
Prior to transfer the patient developed chest pain and hypoxia associated with hypotension so a bedside echo was performed to r/o pericardial effusion.
This was neg for effusion, but notable for EF of 35%.
EKG showed twi in II, AVR and V1, as well as left anterior fascicular block and RBBB, no change from prior, no acute ST changes.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics were continued and extensive work-up continued to reveal no clear source of infection.
CXr and U/A on admission were negative, Ucx subsequently was negative.
BCx from [**8-19**] and [**8-20**] show no growth to date.
CT abdomen/pelvis was also negative for focal infection.
Gall-bladder US showed no cholecystitis and patient did not have RUQ pain.
Patient has multiple violacious nodules on upper and lower extremities that were biopsied on [**8-5**]: path showed cells + for CD68 and CD15, neg.
Radiation oncology evaluated the patient for possible skin radiation and the decision was made between Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 776**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to send the patient to [**Hospital1 1012**] for further treatment.
