Original concern was for new ischemic wall motion abnormality, but repeat echo here after resolution of septic physiology showed recovery of myocardial funtion with EF of 50%.
He was able to me immediately weaned from pressors on arrival and his blood pressure was stable with IV fluid boluses and did not require a central line.
His lab values showed evidence of severe systemic septic response with likely ischemic injury from hypotension to body tissues.
LFT elevations, CK elevations (without MB) and a lactate of 7.7 all trended down on admission with maintence of blood pressure.
A repeat echo cardiogram showed resolution of the wall motion abnormalities.
A urine culture here grew 10,000 colonies of amp sensitive enterococcus, and so ampicillian was added to his regimen.
A repeat urine cx, along with cxr and blood cultures were negative.
