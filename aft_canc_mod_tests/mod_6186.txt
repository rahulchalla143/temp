CT HEAD ([**3-11**]): 1.
An MRI is recommended to confirm these findings.
MRA of the neck demonstrates no hemodynamically significant stenosis.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
She was extubated on HD#2 but within several hours, developed increased sputum with respiratory distress hence re-intubated and sputum culture initially grew 3+ GNR and 1+ GPCs plus leukocytosis with WBC up to 16K hence broad antibiotics of Vancomycin and Zosyn were started which was switched to ampicillin-sulbactam once H.influenzae was isolated on [**3-15**].
She also failed speech and swallow evaluation on [**3-16**] which was repeated on [**3-20**] given that patient was only recently extubated.
Also, on HD #3, patient was found to have tachycardia hence EKG was obtained which showed no acute change but cardiac enzymes were elevated hence most consistent with NSTEMI.
Her CPK peaked in the 200's then trended down.
Repeat swallow evaluation again resulted in recommendations for strict NPO hence IR was consulted for PEG placement.
She was planned for PEG on [**3-21**] but her coag panel showed elevated INR of 5.8.
Her INR improved drastically with 5mg of Vitamin K and she successfully underwent [**3-23**] but she self-DC'd the PEG on the night of placement despite restraining of her strong/non-paretic hand.
