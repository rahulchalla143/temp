Imaging: MRI Head [**2169-8-16**]: 1) Irregular enhancing mass of the right frontal lobe is associated with significant secondary mass effect and subfalcine herniation.
EKG [**2169-8-18**]: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to previous tracing of [**2169-3-16**] multiple abnormalities as noted persist without major change.
MRI [**8-25**]: 1.
He underwent brain MRI on the evening of admission and was found to have an irregular enhancing mass of the right frontal lobe measuring 32 x 32 mm in axial dimension with associated severe cerebral edema and 16 mm sub- falcine herniation.
On neurologic exam he was found to have evidence of diplopia, left sided facial weakness, left sided pronator drift, left sided upper and lower extremity motor weakness and difficulty with finger-nose-finger and rapid alternating movements bilaterally L>R.
His neurologic exam was monitored closely.
His electrolytes were within normal limits.
His urinalysis and culture were normal.
MRI of the brain performed on admission showed evidence of new lesions in the brain.
He underwent CT of the chest/abdomen and torso which showed evidence of a previously known pulmonary lesion but no knew lesions.
MRI of the spine to evaluate further for metastatic disease was deferred during his MICU course but may be considered during this hospitalization given that on presentation the patient noted some mild bowel incontinence (but in the setting of diarrhea).
His was monitored on telemetry and did not have any concerning events.
His electrolytes were monitored closely and repleted and all nodal agents were held.
<br> # ANEMIA: On admission the patient had evidence of a mild macrocytic anemia with an MCV of 101 and hematocrit of 37.3 which is approximately his baseline.
Reticulocyte count was 1.2 which is slightly decreased in the setting of anemia.
On admission his INR was supratherapeutic and his coumadin was held in the setting of the likely need for surgical intervention for his brain lesions.
<br> # ARF: On admission the patient's creatinine was 1.3.
