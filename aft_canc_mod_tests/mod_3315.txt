CAROTID US ([**2113-8-22**].)
2D ECHO ([**2113-8-22**]):  Ejection fraction of 60-70%.
CARDIAC CATH at [**Hospital1 18**] ([**2113-8-23**]):  Right dominant circulation.
LAD thrombectomy was performed and A Cyhper drug eluting stent (2.5 x 18mm) was placed in the LAD.
Subclavian angiogram was normal.
Carotid angiogram showed bilateral high grade focal disease.
PERIPHERAL (CAROTID)CATH at [**Hospital1 18**] ([**2113-8-24**]):  Right subclavian artery with 80% stenosis.
Comparison to old studies is recommended to ensure stablity.
Recommendations: Repeat colonoscopy in 6 months to examine the colon and remove rectal polyps.
UPPER ENDOSCOPY ([**2113-8-28**]):  Normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations.

UA ([**8-22**]): > 50 RBCs, 0-2 WBCs, [**7-16**] epis     Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 15499**] is a 78 year-old female with a 50 pack year smoking history admitted to OSH for antero-septal ST elevation myocardial infarction with three vessel disease and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**].
Peak CPK was 191 and peak CK-MG was 20.
The patient was initially evaluated for a CABG by CT surgery.
Pre-op carotid US showed a  80-90% bilateral carotid stenosis, making her a poor surgical candidate for CABG.
Therefore, in the setting of the patient's recent anterior myocardial infarction and proximal LAD lesion, the patient was taken for a cardiac catheterization ([**2113-8-23**]) with LAD thrombectomy and drug eluting stent placement in the LAD.
A lipid profile was found to be within normal limits.
Her blood pressure was too low on discharge to add an ACEI, but she may benefit from Lisinopril in the future.
Peripheral catheterization on [**2113-8-24**] showed a 60% Right Internal Carotid Artery stenosis and a 99% Left Internal Carotid Artery stenosis.
After the procedure, the patient's blood pressure was monitored so that the systolic blood pressure ranged from 100's-140's.
Additionally, the patient's neurologic exam was unchanged after the catheterization.
PUMP:  Echocardiogram on [**2113-8-22**] showed an left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-70% with mild LVH and impaired ventricular relaxation.
She was given 2 fluid boluses with slight elevation of blood pressure and good urine output, but continued to have MAPs lower than 60.
When the patient went to cardiac catheterization on [**2113-8-23**], an arterial line did show normal blood pressures (117-159/49-113) that were 30 points higher than cuff measurements.
Additionally, peripheral catheterization showed an  80% Right Subclavian Artery Stenosis, causing even lower pressure readings by cuff measurements taken in her right arm.
When the patient's blood pressure was taken from the left arm, it normalized.
On [**2113-8-25**], the patient's Hct dropped from 28.8 to 25.2 to 23.5.
The patient was stable with good urine output and no change in mental status.
A abdomino-pelvic CT was performed to rule out an retroperitoneal bleed.
Although her HCT rose to 27.0 on [**2113-8-26**], she reported that she had multiple loose, bloody stools.
On [**2113-8-27**], a NG lavage showed no blood and the bleed was assumed be from a lower GI source.
The patient's SQ heparin was discontinued, she was placed on a proton pump inhibitor [**Hospital1 **], two large bore IV's were placed, she was typed an crossed, and then given two unit of packed red blood cells with a Hct bump from 24.6 to 29.1.
The patient tolerated the blood transfusion well.
On [**2113-8-28**], the patient was taken to colonoscopy and upper endoscopy.
The colonoscopy showed external hemorrhoids, diverticulosis of the entire colon, and rectal polyps (not removed because the patient was on Plavix.)
The patient will follow up with a colonoscopy in 6 months.
The patient will also need a follow up colonoscopy at 6 months.
This was evaluated with a colonoscopy and an upper endoscopy.
