She presented for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with biopsy on [**2186-10-13**], during which an ampullary mass was noted and positive for pathology-revealing adenocarcinoma.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed temperature 96.0, pulse 66, blood pressure 145/44, respiratory rate 20 and 96% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils equally round and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular muscles intact.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Additionally, please see the discharge summary by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] for the dates of [**11-2**] to [**11-14**] for information regarding immediate postoperative event.
She was stable until postoperative day #2 when her hematocrit fell without appropriate response to blood products and her abdomen had become firm and tender.
A decision was made to take the patient back to the Operating Room to look for a source of bleeding, and on [**2186-11-4**], on postoperative day #2 she underwent an exploratory laparotomy with findings consistent with a hemoperitoneum, but no evidence of any active arterial or venous bleeding.
It was thought that the patient likely had a low ooze after her operation from the posterior-SMV divided mesenteric base of the afferent limb.
Over the ensuing days her fluids were managed following her central venous pressure and urine output and she was diuresed successfully and extubated on postoperative day #7.
On postoperative day #10 it was noticed that her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] output had become bilious and Octreotide was restarted and her lines were changed.
On postoperative day #12, the patient underwent a swallow study to assess her swallowing ability and she aspirated thin liquids and failed the study.
On postoperative day #13, the patient underwent a video swallow study revealing aspiration of thin liquids that reversed with postural maneuvers in a chin tuck.
A computerized tomography scan of the head was performed which revealed no stroke or hemorrhage.
A follow up magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed only mild to moderate atherosclerotic changes of the cavernous portion of her right internal carotid artery, but otherwise normal.
On postoperative day #13, a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed because of persistently elevated white count in the low 20s.
This computerized tomography scan revealed fluid collection in her mid abdomen which was concerning for an abscess, persistent bilateral pleural effusions, ascites and extensive subcutaneous edema.
She therefore underwent computerized tomographic-guided drainage of the fluid collection which turned out to be a hematoma.
On postoperative day #14, Methicillin-sensitive resistant Staphylococcus aureus swabs of her rectum and nasal cavities revealed Methicillin-sensitive resistant Staphylococcus aureus and at this time Zosyn was changed to Vancomycin.
She also underwent a left thoracentesis for 450 cc of clear fluid with her postoperative chest x-ray revealing no evidence of pneumothorax.
The patient denied any shortness of breath or difficulty breathing but was found to have an oxygen saturation that had decreased to the low 80s and high 70s with hypotension of 100/50.
The patient was placed on a nonrebreather of 100% and emergently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where a hematocrit showed a drop from 30 to 24.
Her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain that was draining copious amounts of bilious secretions was placed to wall suction.
Her erythema had stabilized on broad-spectrum antibiotics and her white count had eventually decreased from the low 20s.
A PICC line was placed on postoperative day #25 and her left internal jugular central venous line was discontinued at this time.
On postoperative day #28 to 30 her white count continued to decrease from 20 to 14.6 and the right lateral abdominal erythema had virtually resolved on her antibiotic course.
for heartrates in the mid 90s and systolic blood pressures in the 140s.
