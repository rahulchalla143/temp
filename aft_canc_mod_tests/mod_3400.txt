Pertinent Results: Pre-Operative MRI([**2111-7-22**]): TECHNIQUE: Limited MR imaging of the brain was performed with axial MP-RAGE and multiplanar T1 post-contrast images, for surgical planning.
There is 4-mm midline shift, not significantly changed from preoperative study.
Post-operative MRI ([**2111-7-24**]): The patient is status post left frontoparietal craniotomy.
There are T1 hyperintense blood products in the operative bed, which limit evaluation for residual neoplasm.
This could represent a small amount of residual neoplasm and recommend attention on short-term followup imaging after resolution of blood products.
