She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for IP evaluation and possible tracheal stenting.
Bronchoscopy however, demonstrated extensive involvement of the right mainstem, right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe with tumor.
Her RR was 30-40.
She was hypotensive to the 50s sytolic during the study and was returned to the TSCIU.
When in the MICU, she was transitioned to volume control ventilation with Tv 350/RR 20/100% Fi02 and 10 peep.
A CTA was performed of chest/brain to eval for PE and brain metastasis.
Past Medical History: Small Cell Lung Cancer - treated @ [**Hospital 1559**] Medical Center.

CXR [**2-13**] Line Placement: In comparison with earlier study of this date, the right subclavian catheter extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
CXR [**2-13**]: No previous images.
CT Head [**2-13**]: Enhancing mass lesions centered within the left thalamus, right pons and left cerebellar hemisphere, concerning for metastatic disease.
If clinically indicated, further characterization could be performed with contrast-enhanced MRI to assess for small lesions not seen on CT. .
CXR [**2-14**]: Little overall change except for placement of nasogastric tube.
CTA Chest [**2-14**]: 1.
She did receive sedation, but she had a bronchoscopy the day prior with sedation and no subsequent respiratory failure.
Nebulizers, steroids, and empiric levofloxacin/metronidazole were started.
She was discharged to [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital on AC 330x30, 80%, 10. .
If we are able to get her off the ventilator, woudl be reasonable to discuss possible intervention.
Blood, urine, and sputum cultures sent.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Ten (10) mL PO BID (2 times a day).
Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate 4 mg/mL Solution Sig: Four (4) mg Injection Q6H (every 6 hours).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Small cell lung cancer with brain metastases Right lower lobe collapse Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure COPD   Discharge Condition: Stable for transfer: AC 330cc x 30 breath/min, 80% FiO2, 10 PEEP   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for rigid bronchoscopy and evaluation of the right lung.
You developed respiratory failure after the procedure, and you were intubated; CT head revealed brain metastases, likely from your primary lung cancer.
