During that admission chest CT and echo were performed which showed moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion extending 1.7 cm posterior and lateral to the left ventricle, 2.0 cm around the right ventricular free wall, 1.7 cm around the right atrium without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
The patient was discharged with instructions to follow up with echo in [**3-10**] weeks.

There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2161-12-1**], there has been no significant change.
[**2161-12-11**]: post-procedure TTE Conclusions: 1.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2161-12-11**], the pericardial effusion is gone.
Hemodynamics during the procedure were as follows: RA 2, RV 30/2/7, PCW 13, CO 3.74, CI 2.37.
The patient then developed pericarditis after the drain was pulled with manifested itself as [**11-15**] chest pressure, mainly pleurtic, and an EKG with PR depressions and ST scooping.
