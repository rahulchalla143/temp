He had a white blood cell count of 27,000 (with 21% bandemia).
His creatinine there was 4.5.

On [**2145-7-25**] he dropped his blood pressure to the 70s, had oxygen desaturation, and experienced substernal chest pain, and had electrocardiogram changes.
He was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit at [**Hospital1 69**] [**Location (un) 86**] for further management.
At [**Hospital1 69**], his electrocardiogram was ventricularly paced at 90 beats per minute.
His initial troponin was 3 which trended down to 1.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Father died at the age of 76 and mother died at the age of 86 from cardiac conditions.
He lives with his wife, daughter, son-in-law, and grandson in [**Name (NI) 1411**], [**State 350**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on [**2145-7-26**] revealed blood pressure was 88 to 140/47 to 70, temperature was 99.8, heart rate was 62 to 90, and oxygen saturation was 98% on 12 liters cool-nebulizer mask.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the oropharynx was dry.
Chest examination revealed left-sided crackles one half of the way up.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.

Creatinine was 4.4 (on [**2145-7-26**]).
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A cardiac echocardiogram on [**2145-7-26**] revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
His troponin levels trended down, and the elevated troponin levels were felt to be due to a demand ischemia from hypotension.
Given the large right pleural effusion, a computerized axial tomography of the chest was performed which showed a large right-sided loculated pleural effusion.
In addition, a swallow study was performed which showed that he had significant aspiration problems and was not safe to take anything by mouth.
Postoperatively, the patient did have improvement in his white blood cell count; but again, he had frequent episodes of plugging.
