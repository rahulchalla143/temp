CT head: [**2169-12-5**] FINDINGS: The study is severely limited due to patient motion.
The mastoid air cells and paranasal sinus appear to be clear.
IMPRESSION: Study limited by patient motion.
CTA chest: CT CHEST BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST: The heart size is enlarged with severe coronary artery disease and calcification of the aortic valve.
Several centrilobular and other pulmonary nodules are suggested on this exam limited by motion.
A repeat CT scan as an outpatient after resolution of these acute setting may be warranted.
However, given that PET CT of [**2169-10-28**] was negative for metastatic pulmonary lesion, the likelihood of these nodules representing new metastatic lesions is decreased.
Cardiac Echocardiogram [**2169-12-5**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2168-1-19**], the left ventricular function has significantly worsened.
Cardiac cath report: [**2169-12-5**] HISTORY:   73 yo female with a history of lung cancer, metastatic renal cell carcinoma with met to right femur s/p recent reconstruction admitted on [**2169-12-5**] with large right-sided pulmonary embolism with hypoxia for which she was intubated.
Echo shows EF 15-20% with severe aortic stenosis.
Initial angiography revealed an 80% LM stenosis with damping of the catheter with engagement of the LM and a 70-80% stenosis of the mid LAD as well.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow.
There was difficulty re-obtaining arterial access but once we did, angiography of LM revealed patent LM stent.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed a proximal 80% stenosis in the LMCA.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right-sided filling pressures.
The RASP was 22 mm Hg, RVEDP 30 mm Hg, PASP 57 mm Hg, PCWP 35 mm Hg and LVEDP 40 mm Hg.
The cardiac output was 4.6 and cardiac index was 2.5 l/min/m2.
There was a mean gradient of 23 mm Hg across the aortic valve with a calculated area across the aortic valve of 0.73 cm2 consistent with severe aortic stenosis.
Successful LM and LAD stenting with a 3.5x12mm driver stent post dilated to 4.0mm in the LM and a 3.0x24 driver stent posted to 3.0mm in the LAD.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow.
LCX 60% stenosis.
Hemodynamics as follow:The RASP was 22 mm Hg, RVEDP 30 mm Hg, PASP 57 mm Hg, PCWP 35 mm Hg and LVEDP 40 mm Hg.
The cardiac output was 4.6 and cardiac index  was 2.5 l/min/m2.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow .
