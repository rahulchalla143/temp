The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes.
Extremities - The patient's knees were swollen and had effusion bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 14.0, hematocrit 27.1, platelet count 282,000.

Sodium was 130, potassium 3.9, chloride 92, CO2 26, blood urea nitrogen 18, creatinine 1.4, glucose 176.
Coagulation studies were within normal limits.
Chest x-ray showed no active cardiopulmonary process.
The patient had an arthrocentesis of his right knee on [**2153-8-24**], and it was sent for gram stain and culture.

Estimated blood loss was less than 400cc.
Cardiac index was 3.5.
His arterial blood gases showed acidosis of 7.29, pCO2 39, pO2 107 and base access of 6.0.
His white blood cell count was 17.6 and hematocrit was 36.6.
INR was 1.4.
Creatinine 0.9.
Lactate was 3.5.
Later that day the patient showed deterioration with a base access of a nadir 10 and a blood pressure of 30.
His white blood cell count at this point was 3.9, hematocrit 29.3, INR 1.6 and his creatinine was 0.7.
The patient's abdomen was left open with a bag type dressing for closure.
