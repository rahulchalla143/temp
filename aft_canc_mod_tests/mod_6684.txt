She brought the mass to the attention of her physician who obtained [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CT of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis at the [**Hospital1 16549**].
Neck, chest, and abdominal CT on [**2173-4-7**] showed marked thickening of the right lateral oropharyngeal wall up to approximately 2 cm and a 4.5 x 3 cm lobulated, heterogeneous, right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle that displaced the right carotid artery.
On [**2173-4-26**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 66245**] took the patient to the operating room for direct laryngoscopy and tonsillar biopsy.
The right tonsil contained an ulcerative lesion, which was biopsied.

Additionally, she was then discovered to be in ARF and anemic with a troponinemia and EKG with various territories of mild ST depression.
Overnight on [**8-3**], the patient had three dark red bowel movements with a hct that trended from 26 to 24.4 to 19.5.
Endoscopy was performed to evaluate the bleeding around the G-tube site and clamping was attempted, but not successful.
She was transferred back to the OMED service on [**8-6**] hemodynamically stable with Hematocrit 29.3, pain well controlled.
Nevertheless, an EKG was ordered that was improved when compared to the admission EKG and a unit of blood was transfused over three hours.
A CXR showed no worsening infiltrate although there was possibly increased pulmonary edema/ atelectasis.
The patient was continued on her antibiotic course for HAP and was gently diuresed with fluid goal of -500 to -1L.
The patient continued to have guiac positive stools, but this was felt to be residual from her GI bleed and her hct remained stable.
Final review of a CT Head showed a right parietal hypodensity.
Initially there was concern that the right carotid artery may be compressed by tumor, so neurology recommended permissive hypertension until MRA of neck and CNS assessed patency of vessels.
TTE with bubble study showed no PFO or ASD as possible source for emboli.
Carotid dopplers and MRI looked good but official reads were pending.
Delirium - while the patient has some baseline dementia, she is fully oriented and interactive ([**Location (un) 1131**] the paper) at baseline.
CHF - This patient has an EF of 45-50%.
