An EGD was done which revealed Grade IV esophageal varices.
The patient was initiated on an octreotide gtt, which was continued until she was transferred to the floor.
She was also started on both Lasix and spironolactone, which were discontinued as her blood pressure did not tolerate all of the above agents.
Her hematocrit remained stable after an initial transfusion of four units of packed red blood cells.
While in the intensive care unit, an ultrasound demonstrated cirrhotic liver with re-demonstration of a known hepatocellular carcinoma in the right hepatic lobe as well as near complete occlusion of the main portal vein, which had progressed since the ultrasound of [**2150-4-9**].
