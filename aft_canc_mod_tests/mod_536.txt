BMT moonlighter was notified of status around 8pm, (VS p 90s SBP 90s O2 low 90s on [**5-10**] L o2) who felt she was wet on exam and she was given 40 IV lasix with some effect in terms of urine outpt, but her respiratory status continued to deteriorate and ABG was hypoxic 7/43/40s/60s, CXR w/ diffuse pulmonary infiltrate.
ICU evaluation was called at 2am.
Pt was found to have P 90s SBP 80s, R 30s (chronic all day), low 90s on NRB.
Then, it changed to V Fib, she was shocked once and her pulse returned to 160s BP 90-100.
Her BP was drifting down and was started on levophed.
Her EKG was notable for sinus tachycardia.
Her VS stabilized at P 130s SBP 110-120s and then she was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Her CXR at [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] s/p intubation showed nl heart size and diffuse, somethwat improved opacitiy but no focal infiltrate.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a large mass in the left upper quadrant with numerous enlarged celiac, porta hepatis, splenic and hilar lymph nodes.
A fine needle aspirate of the retroperitoneal lymph node unfortunately was nondiagnostic and she underwent a bone marrow biopsy and retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy which did prove positive for diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[**2196-3-4**] PET scan showed an interval increase in the size of the left upper quadrant mass measuring 2.3 x 5 cm when compared to 1.1 x 2.8 cm.
[**2196-5-9**] underwent a CT scan on a which showed no evidence for adenopathy, particularly in the retroperitoneum at sites of her prior disease.
The PET CT that she had [**3-28**] showed an interval increase in the size of the left upper quadrant mass which now measures 2.3 x 5 cm compared to 1.1 x 2.8 cm.

9.Immunostains for Herpes, CMV, and hepatitis B are negative with appropriate control.
CxR found large effusions, L>R on Chest CxR ([**6-4**]).
-Noncontrast CT normal.
MRI with chronic microvascular ischemia - no acute findings on [**6-13**].
-Began to resolve on [**6-13**] - likely toxic-metabolic -[**6-20**] began worsening MS once again.
Did LP - nml, cx negative.
Noncontrast CT nml on [**6-20**].
Will change to Keppra PO once awake, swallowing***  -Dilantin level 2.3 on [**6-23**], re-bolused on [**6-23**], dilantin 7.9 on [**6-24**], re-bolused [**6-24**], dilantin 17.9 on [**6-25**].
Flagyl ([**6-5**]) added because of diarrhea, possibiliy of C.Dif, cultures x2 have been negative.
-thoracentesis on [**6-19**] for reaccumulation of fluid, fevers to 103 -+VRE urine on [**6-15**] --> tx'ed with Linezolid x6 days.
Her counts rose to a level of 22,000 due to ?GVHD vs. infection, but trended down to normal range.
FEVER/NEUTROPENIA:  Pt had no further fever until day +1, at which time she was started on Cefepime in addition to the acyclovir and fluconazole PPX that had been started on day -1.
She spike a fever and flagyl was added for possible C.Dif, cultures were negative x2 for C.Dif.
C. Diff cultures x5 were negative.
Neurology was consulted, patient had a noncontrast head CT that was normal, MRI negative except for chronic microvascular ischemia, and an LP that was cx negative, and was cytology negative.
Neuro ordered an EEG which showed 3 Hz electrical spikes consistant with ?seizures.
Repeat EEG [**6-23**] EEG concerning for post-ictal seizure activity, and a repeat EEG on [**6-28**] continued to show spikes possibly c/w seizures.
On [**6-27**], pt was found to have (+) HHV-6 from her CSF from LP on [**6-20**].
PT continued to have sinus tachycardia while occasionally switching into a ventricular pre-excitation rhythmn, but never developed a-fib.
A CxR found large effusions, L>R on Chest CxR ([**6-4**]).
She then had a thoracentesis x2 which removed the left sided effusion.
She remained stable on RA - 2L O2 with an oxygen saturation at 95%.
It was continued to replete her albumin level, which may have contributed to her fluid overload.
She then transferred to V-fib and ACLS protocol was again changed accordingly and she regained sinus rhythm with pulse after initial defibrillation.
During this time, dilantin dose was adjusted and bedside EEG monitoring was performed which demonstrated decreased amplitude, decreased spike activity.
When pt's pH dropped < 2, pt was placed on Tham x 500mL for non-HCO3 buffer, which transiently raised her pH to 7.2, but it subsequently dropped again below 7.2.
During this time, family was informed of the critical nature of the [**Hospital 228**] medical problems and they decided to make the patient DNR and also to not escalate the current amount of intervention, specifically they did not want to dialize the patient and they did not want to add another pressor if her blood pressure required.
