PTC [**2121-3-12**] IMPRESSION: Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography demonstrates dilated intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts with findings of a large calculus in the distal common bile duct.
CXR [**2121-3-12**] FINDINGS: Compared with the study at 3:33 a.m. the same day, the ETT has been withdrawn slightly and now projects approximately 2 cm above the carina.
CXR [**2121-3-12**] IMPRESSION: 1) Tip of an endotracheal tube located 1 cm above the level of the carina.
2) Tortuous appearance of the thoracic aorta which could be better evaluated with a PA and lateral chest radiograph.
CXR [**2121-3-14**] IMPRESSION: Slight worsening of left lower lobe consolidation.
MRA [**2121-3-15**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of high-grade stenosis or occlusion in the arteries of anterior or posterior circulation .
CT head [**2121-3-15**] IMPRESSION: Chronic watershed infarction in the right frontal lobe.
Pullback cholangiogram demonstrated obstruction at the distal common bile which could be a long area of fibrous stricture or the possibility of a small tumor of the pancreatic head.
CT ABDOMEN [**2121-3-19**] IMPRESSION: 1.
ULTRASOUND RUQ WITH DOPPLER [**2121-3-20**] IMPRESSION: No demonstrable flow in left portal vein consistent with thrombus.
Therefore she underwent a PTC, with successful placement of an internal/external drain.
A large stone was thought to be seen in the CBD which was later determined to be a stricture.
An MRI was ordered, and it showed chronic right frontal watershed infarct and moderate changes of small vessel disease and brain atrophy.
Prior to her discharge from the ICU, peripheral lines were placed, and the central femoral line placed under sterile conditions at the outside hospital was removed.
She was continued on Zosyn and her bile cultures grew gram negative rods, enterococcus and viridans streptococci.
The pt's blood cultures were negative.
The pt underwent an interventional radiology guided dilatation of CBD stenosis also had a percutaneous drain placed in the common bile duct (as mentioned above).
Her blood cultures (2 sets) were negative.
The GI team was unable to perform a successful ERCP due to a previous gastric bypass procedure.
She underwent a CT abdomen that showed no pancreatic mass or tumor.
Left portal vein thrombus: The pt underwent a CT abdomen which showed portal vein obliteration in segment II and an adjacent portion of segment IV, with associated increased arterial perfusion of these segments.
A duplex ultrasound confirmed left portal vein thrombosis.
The pt's head MRI was significant for no acute strokes, however it did indicate a chronic right frontal watershed infarct, moderate changes of small vessel disease and brain atrophy and no evidence of high-grade stenosis or occlusion in the arteries of anterior or posterior circulation.
Her ECG on admission showed no acute evidence of ischemia and her cardiac enzymes ruled out an acute MI.
Anemia: The pt was noted to have a hematocrit drop from 40 to 33 with IVF hydration in the ICU.
Her baseline hematocrit is unknown.
The pt was noted to have no evidence of bleeding and her hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s.
The pt will likely benefit from an out-patient workup of her anemia and will likely need to be scheduled for a colonoscopy by her PCP.
FEN: The pt was maintained on a low fat diet and her electrolytes were repleted as needed.

Your PCP will do further workup of this clotting.
You were noted to have anemia for which you will need to ask your PCP to schedule you for a colonoscopy as an out-patient.
