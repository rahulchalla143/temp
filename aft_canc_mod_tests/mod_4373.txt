Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %) with anterior, septal and apical akinesis.
[**5-27**] CT head: 1.
[**5-29**] EGD: - Erythema and congestion in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with esophagitis - Mild erythema, mild atrophy in the stomach body compatible with gastritis (biopsy) - Small hiatal hernia - Mild congestion and erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis (biopsy) - Ulcer in the incisura (endoclip) - The antrum was deformed, suggesting previous PUD.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6311**] stain is negative (satisfactory control).
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6311**] stain is negative (satisfactory control).
[**6-1**] Colonoscopy: 4 polyps seen and removed for biopsy diverticula noted  [**6-1**] Colon polyp biopsies: pending  [**6-1**] ECHO: The left atrium is elongated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-5-23**], left ventricular systolic function is improved and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower.
Based on [**2101**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in 1 year.
DISCHARGE LABS [**2105-6-3**]: WBC 10.3 HCT 25.7 (stable) Plt 504 Na 143 K 4.1 Cl 110 HCO3 23 BUN 20 Cr 1.5 Glc 78  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 77625**] is a 73yo F with h/o CRI admitted with tachycardia, anemia and hypocalcemia.
She underwent upper and lower endoscopy, which revealed an ulcer in the incisura - the ulcer began bleeding after the first endoclip was placed, so 2 more endoclips were placed afterward with resolution of the bleeding.
The colonoscopy revealed 4 polyps, which were removed.
Biopsy taken in the stomach showed chronic inactive gastritis, no intestinal metaplasia, and negative [**Doctor Last Name 6311**] stain.
Biopsy of the colonic polyps is still pending at the time of discharge.
GI recommended a repeat biopsy of the stomach ulcer when the patient is more stable.
- f/u colon biopsies - monitor HCT - f/u scheduled with Atrius GI @ [**Location (un) **] - H pylori eradication therapy as requested by GI  # Tachycardia: The patient was noted to be tachycardic to the 180s on admission.
TSH was WNL at 3.9.
She was started on Metoprolol and Amiodarone with good effect - no further runs of SVT after the Amiodarone was started.
Vitamin D level was 22.
Calcium was repleted several times with Calcium gluconate IV.
Calcium on discharge was 8.3 (corrected for albumin 2.5).
Creatinine was elevated to 2.0 during the hospitalization, likely due to profound anemia.
Creatinine improved to 1.5 (baseline) at the time of discharge.
# Leukocytosis: The patient was noted to have a leukocytosis, WBC up to 26.
She was found to have a Group B Strep UTI and was treated for a 7d course with Clindamycin (allergy to PCN).
The WBC continued to climb for a few days after starting treatment - however CXR was unremarkable, BCx were negative, and the patient had no other localizing signs or symptoms.
The WBC count started to decline after several days of Clindamycin and was 10.3 on discharge.
RPR, TSH, B12, folate were all WNL.
Moderate MR was noted, and repeat ECHO in 1 year was recommended.
- repeat ECHO in 1 year - stress test as outpatient - has Atrius cards follow up scheduled  # Positive PAP: Family notified us of positive malignant cells on recent PAP smear.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
You were admitted to the hospital with a low blood count and a fast heart rate.
Your low blood count was due to a bleeding ulcer in your stomach - this was clipped by the gastroenterologists, and there has been no further bleeding.
You should have a stress test as an outpatient to fully evaluate the function of your heart.
