[**2162-5-1**] CT head: 1.
Attenuation of the intrahepatic IVC due to extensive hepatic metastatic disease, without evidence of severe stenosis or thrombus.
The patient did not have a fever, had minimal [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] pneumonia seemed less likely, and CTA was negative for PE.
On [**2162-5-2**] the pt had a therapeutic thoracentesis which per the patient provided an improvement in symptoms.
CXR on [**2162-5-5**] demonstrated some re-accumulation of the right sided pleural effusion and interval increase in the left sided pleural effusion.
Interventional radiology was consulted for possible repeat thoracentesis or pleurX catheter placement but did not feel there was enough fluid on ultrasound to safely attempt thoracentesis.
Admission lower extremity dopplers were negative for DVT, so the patient's extremities were kept elevated.
Given history of liver mets near the IVC there was concern for obstruction of venous return, though abdominal imaging did not demonstrate any IVC obstruction though the read did comment on intra-hepatic attenuation of the IVC likelyy due to extensive liver metastases.
The patient also had an X-ray of the right ankle as it was quite tender on admission, and the X-ray was negative for fracture and foreign body.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
