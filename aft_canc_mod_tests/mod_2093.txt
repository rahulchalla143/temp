He recently completed the first 10-week cycle two weeks ago, and repeat CT scans and the brain MRI, which were done on [**9-12**], revealed significant regression in his ............ abdominal and pelvic disease, undetectable pulmonary nodules, and regression of the lesions in his brain.
In the Emergency Room the patient had a CT angiogram which showed 1) bilateral large pulmonary emboli with clot in the left main pulmonary artery bifurcation of the left and right main pulmonary arteries,  2) right-sided pulmonary effusion, and 3) collaterals of left chest wall suggesting a left subclavian clot.
Seizure in 12/[**2119**].
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is a former urologist and his oncologist fellow is [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 41157**].
Blood pressure was 140/76.
Heart rate 65.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted from the Emergency Room where he had a CT angiogram showing 1) bilateral large pulmonary embolus with the largest embolus seen in the left main pulmonary artery; saddle embolus is present, 2) right-sided pleural effusion, 3) collateral vessels seen within the left chest wall suggesting occlusion of the left subclavian.
In [**2119-12-31**] patient had IVC filter placed as well as an echocardiogram to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of the pulmonary embolism and to guide IV fluid therapy.
Patient also had echocardiogram on [**2120-9-23**].
Left ventricular wall thickness is normal.
To better assess the patient's risk, a head CT without contrast was performed.
The results of the CT were no acute hemorrhage or mass effect, stable appearance of the right frontal lobe resection bed, and left cerebral hemorrhage likely due to punctate left cerebellar tonsillar metastases.
The finding of small focus of hyperdensity within the left cerebellum was consistent with the finding of susceptibility within the same region on a prior MRI and likely represented an area of old hemorrhage into a metastatic lesion.
His blood pressure was unchanged.
His heart rate was stable.
Patient was not short of breath, and his oxygen saturation remained at 96% on room air.
EKG showed no S-T depressions, no T-wave inversions, no new Q-waves and was relatively unchanged from his admission EKG.
A stat portable chest x-ray was performed on [**2120-9-27**] showing 1) improving right lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation, 2) patchy opacity of the left lateral lung field corresponding to area of pulmonary embolus on recent CT scan.
Exam was otherwise unchanged from prior study and was negative for pneumothorax or new pneumonia.
Patient was otherwise stable with normal blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation on room air, and desire to go home.
