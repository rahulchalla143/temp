FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):  STUDIES: [**3-26**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1.
Segment VII lesion at the dome of the liver currently measures 1.4 x 1.4 cm, slightly decreased in size compared to the previous examination and has washout at the delayed phase, findings consistent with residual HCC.
Multiple hepatic lesions, which are better characterized on a multiphasic CT scan performed on same day at 10:08 a.m. 5.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: hyperdynamic left ventricle with at least mild outflow tract onstruction; small-to-moderate pericardial effusion (no deefinite tamponade signs)  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2103-10-11**], the heart rate is increased, with hyperdynamic function, and significant outflow tract obstruction.
Patient's mental status remained clear despite a sodium of 116 on admission which subsequently improved to 129 on discharge after holding all diuretics.
Urine osms were within normal limits on admission and hypertonic saline was not used.
# Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - TTE revealed hyperdynamic LV (EF > 80%) with decreased LV dimensions and mild outflow tract obstruction, as well as mild-moderate pericardial effusion.
Blood pressures remained stable after administration of IV fluids.
CT scan performed during admission showed his known tumors and ascites.
He was guaiac negative with no signs of bleeding and his hematocrit stabilized.
Peripheral blood smear suggested acanthocytes with no visible schistocytes.
Hematology was consulted, a direct Coombs test was negative, and there was no evidence of TTP-HUS.
TussiCaps 10 mg/8 mg capsules sustained release, [**2-2**] capsules by mouth as needed for cough.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Hyponatremia Hypovolemia Anemia of chronic disease  Secondary diagnoses: -Cryptogenic cirrhosis -Hepatocellular Carcinoma -CAD -Pancreatic cystic mass of unknown etiology -Reactive PPD with positive quantiferon gold -HTN -Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital for evaluation of increased weakness and fatigue.
You were found to have a low blood pressure because of dehydration as well as a low level of sodium in your blood which likely was causing your symptoms.
You were given IV fluids to improve your dehydration, your home blood pressure medications have been changed to make sure that your blood pressure remains stable at home, and your sodium level has improved dramatically.
The following changes have been made to your home medication regimen: - Stop Avapro - Stop Lasix - Start Nadolol 20mg daily .
