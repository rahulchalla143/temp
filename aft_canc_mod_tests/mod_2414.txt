Levofloxacin and metronidazole were given, CT scans were obtained, and the patient was transferred to the Fenard Intensive Care Unit for further management.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination, the patient's temperature is 95 degrees, heart rate 115, blood pressure 71/50, respiratory rate 15, and oxygen saturation of 99% on mechanical ventilator.
Her heart rate was tachycardic, there are normal S1, S2 heart sounds, and there is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard throughout the precordium.
She had bronchial breath sounds at the left base, otherwise her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her abdomen was firm, distended, there were hypoactive bowel sounds, and a fluid wave was palpable.
The extremities were cool and peripheral pulses were barely palpable.
LABORATORIES:  Initial laboratory evaluation demonstrated a white blood cell count of 16.3 (69% neutrophils, 21% bands, 8% lymphocytes, and 2% monocytes), hematocrit 29.8, and platelets of 224,000.
PT was 17.2, PTT 33.7, and INR of 2.0.
Chemistries demonstrated a sodium of 128, potassium 3.4, chloride 86, bicarbonate 15, BUN 46, creatinine 1.1, glucose 179, calcium 8.5, magnesium 2.3, and phosphorus 4.8.
The albumin was 2.6.
LFTs were normal except for an AST of 63 and an alkaline phosphatase of 143.
Urinalysis was negative for UTI.
ABG on the ventilator was 7.46/28/213.
Diagnostic paracentesis was consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; peritoneal fluid Gram stain demonstrated 2+ polys, but no organisms.
Initial CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated a large left sided pleural effusion, moderate right sided pleural effusion, bibasilar compressive atelectasis, interval enlargement of left sided axillary nodes, diffuse distention of multiple bowel loops, with the majority of the small bowel dilated and fluid filled, right sided colonic distention with air and fluid, ascites, and a soft tissue mass in the mid-transverse colon leading to relative decrease in the caliber of the remaining large bowel with air in the left sided colon and rectum.
Head CT demonstrated no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
She was initially aggressively resuscitated with multiple pressors to support her blood pressure as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics for her peritonitis.
