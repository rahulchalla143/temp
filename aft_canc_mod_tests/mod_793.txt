CXR (portable AP) [**2152-4-29**]: bilateral pleural effusion, diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities, concerning for multifocal pneumonia .
EKG: Atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate 104.
Compared with prior study [**2152-4-26**], ST-depression in I and TWI in II, III, aVF is new.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 year old woman who presented with pulmonary edema from atrial fibrillation, acute diastolic heart failure, and prolapsed and regurgitant mitral valve.
She initially presented with progressive shortness of breath with chest x-ray read as "multifocal pneumonia".
However, I believe she had pulmonary edema and she appeared fluid overloaded with jugular venous distension and peripheral edema with very suggestive CXR of edema.
Her Coumadin was held for supra therapeutic INR and the rate was controlled with digoxin and Diltiazem.
MICU team ordered TSH/CRP/RF/B12/folate/cortisol and were all normal.
