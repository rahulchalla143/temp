TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were obtained from lung bases to the symphysis pubis after administration of Optiray intravenously.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The visualized portion of the lung bases does not demonstrate any pulmonary nodule.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, distal ureters, uterus and adnexa, rectum and sigmoid colon appear normal.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are noted with grade 2 retrolisthesis of L5 over L4.
Unchanged moderate extrahepatic and mild intrahepatic bile duct dilatation since MR of abdomen performed in [**2182-1-17**].
Grade 2 retrolisthesis of L4 over L5 with a small disc bulge at the same level.
[**2186-3-29**]: PA and lateral upright chest radiograph compared to [**3-27**] and [**2186-3-24**].
Mediastinal position, contour, and width are unremarkable.
Interval development of bilateral small pleural effusion is demonstrated, especially between [**3-24**] and [**3-27**], with minimal progression between [**3-27**] and [**3-29**].
Grayscale, color flow and Doppler images of the left upper extremity were obtained.
[**12-25**] Pathology Tissue: GI BIOPSIES (2 JARS).
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-7-26**], no change.
PORTABLE CHEST [**2186-4-1**].
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the stomach antrum.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the duodenal bulb- ulcer edge.
Follow biopsy results and treat if positive for H. pylori.
Biopsy of ulcers taken at EGD and pending.
Superficial thrombophlebitis: Septicemia, coagulase negative staphylococcus:  The patient developed Superficial thrombophlebitis at the left brachial IV cath site.
Cath was removed and patient was treated with IV vancomycin for total 7 days.
Also, BUN, creat and CBC should be done to ensure stability.
The patient should follow up with PCP for repeat blood cultures in [**1-18**] weeks after the antibiotics completed for follow up labs.
The patient has COPD and CXR showed some changes as above.
Folow up CXR at discretion of PCP.
Pancreatic enzymes with meals were continued.
