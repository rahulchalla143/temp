He was infused with muliple boluses of normal saline, put on levophed for blood pressure support.
Blood cultures were found to be positive for gram postive cocci which was ultimately shown to be VRE.
The pt remained hypotensive on pressors for the next several days and a work-up was initiated to determine the source of infection.
MRI of the foot was pursued to r/o osteomyelitis, and a CT of the abdomen was down to r/o an abdominal source of infection.
The CT Abdomen and pelvis showed possible abscess in liver and spleen.
For the pancolitis, the pt was kept NPO and he was treated for possible c. diff infection while c. diff cultures were sent and found to be positive.
A RUQ U/S [**2135-2-2**] was pursued which showed evidence of hypoechoic lesion could be flegmon or mass.
It was unable to be confirmed on imaging whether these lesions on CT which were new compared with a previous scan in [**10-1**] were abscesses vs possible mets from an unknown primary.
The GI team suggested an MRI to further evaluate the liver lesions although this was unable to be pursued because the pt was too unstable requiring pressors for bp support.
A TTE Echo was done to r/o endocarditis or abscess and was negative.
Head CT was negative for abscess as well.
His blood pressure was in the 80s-90s systolic off pressors and his extremities continued to show evidence of perfusion.
