Bronchoscopy showed inability to cannulate the right middle lobe, making it worrisome for middle lobe torsion syndrome.
This had previously been ruled out by a CT scan at her original hospitalization in [**Month (only) **].
We did obtain an airway CT with IV contrast, which showed poor perfusion to the right lung.
A perfusion scan was obtained that showed essentially no perfusion to the right lung, confirming ischemic necrosis of unclear etiology.

Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2160-12-6**]):    NO GROWTH.
Chest CT: 1.
Marked attenuation of the right lower lobe blood supply, demonstrated by this first contrast-enhanced postoperative CT scan may be responsible for progression of right lower lobe consolidation to necrosis since [**2160-10-24**].
While in the ED she was pan cultured, CXR showed right lower lobe  parenchymal opacification and loculation of air in the right upper lobe space.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and recommended a bronchoscopy which was done on [**2160-12-1**] and showed anatomic distortion of the right middle lobe causing narrowing and compression.
Subsequently a Chest CT showed no perfusion of the remaining right lung.
A V/Q scan confirmed no ventilation or perfusion.
A preoperative work-up was done for Ischemic necrosis of right lung with abscess formation.
She was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells for a HCT 25 to 29.
The antibiotics were discontinued once her cultures were negative and she remained afebrile.
On POD6 she had an episode of Atrial fibrillation a rate in the 180's with spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm.
The beta-blocker was increased and electrolytes were replete.
Cardiology was consulted they recommended Toprol 100 daily, an echocardiogram which was normal with an EF >55%.
Oxygen saturations was 96% RA.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Right upper lobe mass s/p RULobectomy [**10-11**] H/o elevated liver enzymes, initially thought to be due to autoimmune hepatitis but liver biopsy at [**Hospital1 2025**] ruled this out.
Report to the [**Location (un) 861**] Radiology Department for a Chest X-Ray 45 minutes before your appointment.
