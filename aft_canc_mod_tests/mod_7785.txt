[**2153-3-22**] CT abdomen/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2153-3-21**] Kidney biopsy: ULTRASOUND GUIDANCE FOR RENAL BIOPSY BY NEPHROLOGIST: Ultrasound examination of the kidneys was performed.
The lower pole of the left kidney was identified and the position was marked on the patient's back for renal biopsy to be performed by the nephrologist.
[**2153-3-27**] CT abdomen/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
He received several sessions of bedside hemodialysis; two sessions were prematurely stopped as his blood pressure did not tolerate it.
Renal ultrasound showed enlarged prostate and large amount of ascites but normal kidneys.
However, the kidney biopsy light microscopy showed mesangial proliferative GN.
Immunofluorescence showed 2+ IgG and 2+ lambda mesangial deposition.
The serum free light chain assay was pending on discharge.
Preliminary biopsy results were suspicious for fibrillary glomerulonephritis.
He was discharged with follow-up at nephrology clinic for further evaluation as outpatient.
# GU bleed s/p kidney biopsy: Pt underwent kidney biopsy on [**2153-3-21**] that was complicated by gross hematuria.
His hematuria led to drop in Hct from high 20s to low 20s and a drop in blood pressure to systolic 70s.
CT abdomen showed perinephric stranding adjacent to the left kidney, most likely from recent percutaneous biopsy, a small hematoma in left kidney, and blood in the collecting system and bladder.
Hct was stable at baseline in high 20s by time of discharge.
Repeat CT abdomen showed that small hematoma in kidney was stable.
# Hypotension: BP at admission was systolic 80s.
He later became hypotensive to systolic 70s following hematuria after a kidney biopsy and hemodialysis.
He was pan-cultured, with negative urine and blood cultures.
Peritoneal fluid showed no signs of infection.
Following transfusion of PRBCs and IV fluids, BP stabilized in systolic 100s-120s throughout remainder of admission.
Nexavar (on hold) 8. levaquin 500mg po x 1 week  Discharge Medications: 1. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain.
This was complicated by bleeding that caused your blood counts to drop and your blood pressure to drop.
You were transferred to the intensive care unit briefly because of this and were transfused with blood products.
Your blood pressure recovered and the bleeding in the urine stopped.
Your kidney biopsy showed a rare condition called fibrillary glomerulonephritis.
It is very important that you have regular follow-ups at the [**Hospital 10701**] Clinic for frequent monitoring of your kidney function and possibly further testing.
Your blood pressure was extremely good in the hospital so you didn't need it on discharge.
