Patient underwent a TTE the following day which showed normal global and regional biventricular systolic function with mild mitral regurgitation with good rate control, and cardiology reported no contraindications to surgery.
An NGT was placed and put on suction and pt decompressed.
On day of discharge urine cultures came back with e. coli resistant to cipro and patient switched to Macrobid 7 day course.
*) Hypoxia: Patient developed hypoxia with oxygen saturations at 88% RA on post-op day 2.
A CTA was done to rule out PE and CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia.
Urine lytes were sent and corresponded to a pre-renal source.
This was stopped as BP was controlled with metoprolol after development of Afib with RVR.
