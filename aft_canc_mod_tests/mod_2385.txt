CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2176-8-5**]): New sulcal effacement of the left occipital and parietal lobes with relative sparing of the temporal and frontal lobes.
Further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS ([**2176-7-3**]): 1.
CHEST PORTABLE AP ([**2176-8-5**]):  New area of opacity in the right mid lung may represent an area of infection or increased atlectesis in setting of decreased lung volumes.
Limited examination secondary to motion artifact and metal artifact, ventricular shunt noted on the left frontal ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**] via right frontal burr hole.
Seizure detection files showed two electrographic seizures without clinical correlate on video.
Her sputum was growing serratia and stenotrophomonas, and urine was growing pan-resistant pseudomonas.
A CT scan of her head showed possible cerebritis.
Samples of her CSF, sputum, urine, blood, and stool were taken to look for a fever source, and with the help of an infectious disease consultation, she was empirically treated with vancomycin, cefepime, colistin, PO vancomycin, and acyclovir- given concern for VPS associated encephalitis, ventilator associated pneumonia, pan-resistant foley associated UTI, and c. diff colitis.
An MRI was performed to further evaluate the findings on CT scan, which showed multiple embolic strokes.
Cultures returned negative in the CSF for bacterial or HSV infection, and highly resistant pseudomonas species grew in both sputum and urine.
Blood cultures remained negative.
Her antimicrobials were pared down to cefepime and colistin, which she completed a course of for her concurrent infections, ending on [**2176-8-20**].
Her MRI did not confirm any evidence of encephalitis, and in fact showed multiple acute/subacute embolic strokes.
Her EEG showed evidence of seizure activity.
A 24hour video EEG was performed, which confirmed the presence of seizure activity, which correlated to the images captured on video.
This was reversed with deep suctioning, and felt to be secondary to mucous plugging.
Her sugars were mostly in 100-200 range.

A video EEG was done which confirmed that you were indeed having seizures.
Your Dilantin and albumin levels need to be checked in 5 days ([**2176-9-2**]).
Corrected Phenytoin = Measured Phenytoin Level / ( (adjustment x albumin) + 0.1); Adjustment = 0.2; In patients with Creatinine Clearance < 20, adjustment = 0.1. .
If corrected Dilantin level is lower than 15, then increase the noon dose to 150 mg.  Dilantin levels need to be checked again in 5 days.
