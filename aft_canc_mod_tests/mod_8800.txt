Bronchoscopy 3.
Blood transfusion 4.
Bone marrow biopsy  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 2031**] is a 62 y/o male with MM s/p allo-BMT and DLI [**8-16**] with GVHD of skin recently admitted on [**10-14**] for [**Month/Day/Year **] and shortness of breath concerning for pneumonia or restrictive airway disease such as BOOP.
PFT's revealed a slightly restrictive pattern, but pulmonary felt that the clinical evidence was not too suggestive for BOOP.
He has had recurrent diarrhea with rectal biopsies showing no evidence of GVHD, and c. diff was negative.
CHF, [**3-15**] diastolic dysfunction Echo [**10-23**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal(LVEF>55%).
Osteoarthritis 7.

IMAGING: [**11-9**] CHEST CT: 1.
Brielfy, lung volumes appear unchanged, DLCO decreased slightly,  FEV1/FVC also decreased suggestive of restrictive disease.
CT chest [**2192-11-26**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Widespread bone lesions did not change appreciably, the evaluation of the D11 vertebral body lesion is difficult on the chest CT.
If warranted clinically, further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
chest ct [**12-18**]: 1.
Coexisting infection is likely, although bronchiolitis seen on the previous exam has improved.
[**12-31**] cxr: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-14**] through 18:  Substantial progression of consolidation has continued relative to [**12-26**] and 18 with greater involvement of the lower lungs.
He had a chest CT that showed "worsening diffuse bronchial wall thickening, new nodules with ground glass "halos," and new ground glass wedge opacities in the upper lobe" which were concerning for a progressive infectious process, such as aspergillus.
A bronch was done and BAL showed growth of aspergillus.
Sputum culture showed growth of pseudomonas (resistant to cipro and intermediate to cefepime).
His oxygen was increased to 5L NC, but he continued to be tachypneic and oxygenation ranged from 88%-98% on 5L.
ABG was done and was 7.4/36/57/26.
CXR appeared consistent with worsening opacities/volume overload.
Patient's hyypoxia improved daily and by [**2192-12-10**] weaned down to 4-6L NC satting between 92-98%.
A repeat CT scan was more worrisome for BOOP so the patient was treated with cellcept and steroids.
The patient's BOOP, GVHD, aspergillus pneumonia and later presumed PCP pneumonia were all insults leading to his poor pulmonary status.
Patient remained on NRB, and then continued to decline and was only 70-80% saturation on 100% NRB, the patient was DNR/DNI and continued to decline at this point with antibiotics, lasix, nebs and inhalers.
Based on his Chest CT his steroids were increased and on [**12-26**] he received 3 days of high dose steroids to improve his pulmonary status.
Viral swab from oral ulcers showed HSV-1 at this admission.
His lesions improved and his pain remained controlled.
Multiple myeloma: The patient has extensive skeletal involvement and is status-post allo transplant in '[**81**] and DLI in [**8-16**].
During his last admission, MRI revealed enhancing lesion on thoracic vertebrae.
BM biopsy revealed no recurrenece of disease.
His counts were closely followed and he was given blood for hematocrit < 25 and platelets for platelets < 30.
With the aspergillus he was at risk for pulmonary bleeding, so his platelets were kept > 30.
His bony lesions were treated with fentanyl patch and oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
He had a RUE ultrasound that was negative for DVT.
Shoulder films revealed unchanged non-[**Hospital1 **], but did not fully evaluate entire right arm.
Further imaging subsequently revealed a lytic lesion in his right radius.
At this time his insulin was stopped, but as his steroids were increased he was restarted on SSI, and his insulin was adjusted as needed.
He had urine cultures followed, and as he was not infected was given platelets as needed and medications to control bladder spasms.
