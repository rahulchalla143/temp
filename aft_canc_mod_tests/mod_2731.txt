#Acute myeloid leukemia:  Patient with rapidly rising WBC count on admission despite therapy with hydrea.
She underwent CT chest that showed hilar and pretracheal lymphadenopathy, likely consistent with leukemia, although possibly related to infection.
Given tumor lysis syndrome prior to initiation of chemotherapy, she was transferred to the ICU for leukophoresis to decrease WBC count burden prior to initiating chemotherapy.
WBC count decreased from 78 to 28 with leukophoresis, and the patient became more awake with decreased peripheral cyanosis.
Patient with hypoxia and mild hypotension (to SBP 92 from 130s), concerning for developing sepsis.
She underwent bronchoscopy with BAL to further evaluate her ground glass opacities.
