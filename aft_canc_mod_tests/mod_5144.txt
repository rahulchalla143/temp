She was then brought to the ED were rectal temp was 98, BP 100/60s, and tachy 100-110s.
A CTA was performed which showed no PE but with increased vascular resistance in the R M/L lobes, known R mediastinal mass with mass effect on SVC, worsening collapse of entire R lung and finally R pleural effusion.

[**10-17**] CTA - IMPRESSION: 1.
No significant interval change since prior exam of the known large invasive right mediastinal mass, adjacent mass effect on the SVC, and development of collateralization.
[**9-9**] CT Abd/Pelvis IMPRESSION: 1.
# SOB - No PE evident on CTA, CT with evidence of tumor progression and collapse of most of right lung with minimal perfusion and pleural effusions.
Did not pursue further work-up on admit given CMO status.
