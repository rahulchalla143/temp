Platelets have been from 49K to 78K with a macrocytic anemia (both low methylmalonic acid and B12 levels noted).
He had a colonoscopy last summer due to his history of polyps.
He drinks about [**4-8**] alcoholic beverages today, although reports that he did stop this for the last month or so to see if this would cause any improvement in his blood counts.
It does not report any other cancers or blood disorders in his family.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT Abdomen: [**4-21**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The lung bases are clear.
Laboratory workup revealed no evidence of hemolysis and the patient has had febrile episodes preceeding the transfusion that were not in the setting of transfusion.
CT OF THE PELVIS: There is moderate thickening extending along the sigmoid colon and rectum.
Microbiology: Stool cultures: negative for SSYCE organisms, O&P, viral cultures CMV viral load, negative [**Location (un) 27292**] virus antigen: pending Catheter Tip: no growth  Blood cx's: [**4-26**] - 2/4 bottles   ENTEROCOCCUS FAECIUM.

While this may represent a larger infectious or inflammatory nodule related to changes described above, a followup chest CT in three months is recommended to assess for stability.
[**2136-5-12**] CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis: 1.
Followup chest CT in three months is recommended to assess for stability.
[**2136-5-13**] Left Upper Extremity Ultrasound: 1.
[**2136-5-14**] Transthoracic Echo: The left atrium is normal in size.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-5-1**], the findings are similar.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
The white blood cell count appears markedly decreased.
A limited 10 cell differential count shows 100% lymphocytes.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation, and consists of markedly hypocellular marrow (less than 5% cellular) consisting primarily of stromal cells with rare scattered plasma cells and scant hematopoietic precursors.
[**2136-5-20**] CXR Cardfiomediastinal contours are unremarkable.
Daily Blood Cultures [**2136-5-11**] - [**2136-5-19**]: VRE   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year old male with a new diagnosis of AML admitted for 7+3 induction chemotherapy.
On [**5-23**], he became tachycardic with CVP ~11, on NIPPV.
Hematocrit was stable; PE was in the differential, but heparin was deferred given the severity of his prior upper GI bleed.
Given agitation and discomfort, he was given a trial of high flow mask, and his oxygen levels remained 93-95%, MAPs > 65, with stable mentation.
At approximately 3am on [**5-24**], he became apneic and heart rate became bradycardic.
Had bone marrow biopsy on day 14 that showed 10% cellularity and 50% blast count.
The patient had a repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**5-15**].
Was initially broadly covered with antibiotics (Vancomycin, Cefepime, Micafungin, and Flagyl and Acyclovir) until blood cultures grew VRE (E. faecium) from his venous line blood culture.
Line was pulled, culture tip showed no growth.
Surveillance cultures initially showed no growth, so TTE was not pursued.
He again starting having fevers on [**2136-5-11**] and blood cultures showed VRE.
He had a new PICC line which was pulled on [**2136-5-12**] and the tip was cultured and again showed no growth.
His infectious workup included a repeat chest, abdomen and pelvis CT which showed resolution of his pancolitis but RUL nodules in the lung concerning for infection.
However, a left upper extremity ultrasound demonstrated a superficial venous clot in the cephalic vein.
He continued to spike fevers and grow VRE from his blood cultures.
The patient was briefly anticoagulated with a heparin gtt at low dose, however, he dropped his hematocrit from 25 to 20 and had hemeoccult positive stool, so this drug was stopped.
Stool was sent for microbiological analysis.
Stool cultures for bacterial (including C. difficile), parasitic, and viral etiologies (including CMV, [**Location (un) 27292**], and Norovirus) were all negative.
