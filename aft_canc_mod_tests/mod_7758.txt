Consider repeat colonoscopy at some point as an outpatient to remove polyps that were noted.
Baseline HCT is unclear, on prior d/c his hct was 25, in [**Location (un) **] records baseline looks like 30 and he was given 2 units as an outpatient (on [**2-15**]) for unclear reasons.
Pt was bolused IVF prn to maintaine SBP and was transfused for HCT goal >25.
EGD and [**Last Name (un) **] were done [**2134-2-17**], showing esophagitis (likely [**12-24**] radiation) and multiple colonic diverticuli with no stigmata of active bleeding.
HCT remained stable post procedure.
EGD showed esophagitis.
# History of PE: pt on warfarin for dx of presumed PE based on ekg findings (S1Q3T3), ddimer, and echo with RH strain on prior admission.
Oncologist was notified re admission and pt was not planned for repeat tx for at least 1 month at which time he will re-address goals of care with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
CXR showed retrocardiac opacity that was decreasing in size.
Sputum cultures were attempted but were contaminated.
Transitional issues: - evaluation of esophagitis if symptoms continue - repeat colonoscopy in future for removal of polyps seen on [**Last Name (un) **] this admission   Medications on Admission: 1. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath, wheeze.
You had and upper and lower endoscopy which showed #1) moderate to severe radiation esophagitis and #2) diverticulosis.
You were transfused 5 units of blood and your blood count stabilized.
