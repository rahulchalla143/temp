A CT scan of the abdomen was performed on [**2165-1-4**], which demonstrated two lesions in the liver, a 3.2 cm lesion in segment for a 4.3 x 2.5 cm lesion in the inferior aspect of the right lobe near the liver edge.
Temperature is 99.0, pulse 84.
Blood pressure is 140/84, respirations 20, and weight is 246 lb.
Cardiac examination is normal, S1 loud, split S2, there is a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.
LABORATORIES:  Hemoglobin 12.6, hematocrit 37.7, white count of 12.3, platelets 176,000.
Sodium 139, potassium 4.5, chloride 102, bicarbonate 23, glucose of 305, BUN of 12, creatinine of 0.7, AST of 17, ALT of 27, alkaline phosphatase of 88, total bilirubin of 0.2, direct bilirubin of 0.1, CEA of 34.
She underwent a cardiac catheterization by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], which is only significant for an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18-20, but her coronary arteries were open, which is a moderate surgical risk.
Electrocardiogram showed paced rhythm with a rate of 78.
CTA showed one liver lesion in segment six of the right lobe measuring 2.7 x 5.2 cm.
She tolerated this procedure well and received 3,000 Crystalloid and estimated blood loss of 400 and urine output of 640.
She spent the first postoperative night in the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring where she remained hemodynamically stable, and postoperative day #1, she was transferred to the floor for remainder of recovery.
Her O2 saturations have been in the high 90s to 100%, and has been weaned off oxygen successfully.
She had an electrocardiogram which showed paced rhythm which was unchanged from a previous electrocardiogram.
She also had a set of cardiac enzymes sent which were negative with a troponin less than 0.3, CPK of 639, MB fraction of 1.
She will be discharged with a JP in place with followup in clinic for evaluation and then possible removal.
Her platelet count had dropped down to 105 on postoperative day two from 151 on postoperative day #0.
The section 6 and 4 resection were positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient will go home with VNA services for wound care, JP care, and insulin teaching, NPH administration [**Hospital1 **].
