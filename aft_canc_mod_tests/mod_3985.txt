TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial images of the head were obtained without contrast.
The contrast-enhanced study was planned but the patient was unable to continue, and the examination was terminated.
For further evaluation and evaluation of the postoperative changes, a repeat study is recommended with gadolinium.

MP-RAGE axial images were also acquired.
Comparison was made with the previous outside MRI of [**2106-10-18**].
IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearances of bilateral cerebral masses in temporal- occipital regions, left greater than right side compared with MRI of [**2106-10-18**].
The examination was performed for operative planning.

TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the head were obtained without contrast.
Comparison was made with the previous study of [**2106-10-28**].
IMPRESSION: New since the previous study is slight increase in size of the left-sided subdural collection which now measures approximately 11 mm with mass effect on the adjacent sulci and slight midline shift.
Otherwise, the examination is unchanged.
TECHNIQUE: Non contrast Sagittal, axial, coronal T1, FLAIR, and post- gadolinium contrast images were obtained.
A left temporal/parietal wedge- shaped area demonstrtates restricted diffusion, consistent with acute infarction.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There are previous post-operative changes in the left posterior temporal occipital region with new left tempoaro occipital post- surgical changes noted.
Results were discussed with Chip [**Doctor Last Name **] at 10 PM on [**2106-11-2**]  The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Postoperative CT demonstrated expected post-surgical changes, in addition a 7mm hyperattenuating focus in the postsurgical bed, ?
On POD#1, the morning of [**10-29**], he was more aphasic, and a repeat CT demonstrated increased edema causing 7mm MLS; dexamethasone was increased and he remained in the ICU.
Routine post-op CT showed the loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation and increased hypodensity in the left frontal lobe; ?
