His post-operative head CT was stable.
A repeat Head CT was stable and showed no acute hemorrhage.
A EKG was stable.
It was explained that since he was unable to tolerate the MRI post operatively, that he will now need to have a MRI with and without contrast prior to his follow up in the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic in 4 weeks.Physical Therapy evaluated the patient today and found that while he is independent with ambulation , the he would benefit from high level balance training on an out patient basis with Physical Therapy.
You will need your level drawn in one week with the result faxed to our office.
Followup Instructions: You will need to be see at the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic in [**3-3**] weeks with a MRI of the Brain with and without contrast.
