Admission Date:  [**2152-2-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2152-2-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-11-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Tylenol/Codeine / Iodine Containing Agents Classifier  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Failure to thrive, nausea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP with removal and replacement of biliary stent RBC scan x 2, both unremarkable   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 year-old Spanish speaking woman with a history of non-resectable cholangiocarcinoma s/p seven cycles of gemcinabine (last [**11-18**]) and CyberKnife radiotherapy ([**8-18**]).
Since her most recent chemotherapy, she has felt generally unwell and has been unable to take much PO.
In the ED, initial VS: T 99, BP 138/48, HR 62, O2 Sat 100% RA.
CXR showed no significant abnormality.
Urinalysis was clean.
She was admitted to OMED for further evaluation and management.
Abdominal CT revealed soft tissue attenuation surrounding the superior mesenteric artery and extending to the periportal region; enhancing soft tissue surrounding the common hepatic and bile duct with periportal edema; and an ill-defined low attenuation in the head of the pancreas.
Abdominal MRI revealed abnormal T2 dark soft tissues surrounding the celiac axis extending to the periportal region and abutting the head of the pancreas.
On [**3-31**], the patient underwent EGD which demonstrated normal esophagus, stomach and duodenum.
Following cannulation of the pancreatic duct, the CBD was cannulated and stented for the length of the stricture.
On [**2151-4-29**], she underwent repeat ERCP and removal of the pancreatic duct stent.
Treatment History: [**2151-5-14**]: C1 Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2; W3 dose reduced by 25% to 750 mg/m2 [**2151-6-11**]: C2 Gemcitabine 750 mg/m2 [**2151-7-9**]: C3 Gemcitabine 750 mg/m2           Aranesp 200 mcg [**2151-7-23**] for Hg/Hct < 10/30 [**2151-8-6**]: C4 Gemcitabine 750 mg/m2.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent CT scan on [**12-12**] and this revealed complete stability.

[**2152-2-17**]: INTERPRETATION: Baseline images were obtained before tracer injection since the patient had a tagged RBC scan the day prior.
Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were obtained.
Pre-injection images show activity in the bowel compatible with interval bleed since the prior study.
Flow study shows normal abdominal flow.
Dynamic blood pool images show no evidence for a active GI bleed.
[**2152-2-16**]: INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen at 60 and 90 minutes were obtained.
Blood flow images show flow into abdominal vasculature.
Dynamic blood pool images show no evidence for bleeding.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
ERCP: 6 spot fluoroscopic images were obtained without a radiologist present and submitted for review.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CXR clear, no other localizing signs or symptoms.
CT torso was performed with premedication to evaluate for metastatic and/or locally progressive disease.
After her ERCP procedure, she was being prepared for discharge but developed a fever.
Blood cultures were drawn and were positive for Serratia.
A CT scan was performed and showed abscesses in the liver.
She ultimately underwent a repeat ERCP.
However, the patient's alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels continued to rise during this time.
Of note, during this time as well, the patient's more recent blood cultures began to grow enterococcus.
On [**2152-2-15**], because her alk phos and bilirubin were still rising, the patient underwent a 3rd ERCP, during which a defect was created in the distal portion of her previous stent so that bile could drain into the duodenum.
A tagged RBC scan was performed which revealed no clear source of bleeding.
# Cholangiocarcinoma:  Locally advanced and unresectable but stable in appearance by CT [**2151-12-22**], s/p 7 cycles of gemcitabine (most recent [**11-18**]) and Cyberknife ([**7-19**]).
There was no evidence of metastatic disease on CT torso.
# Anemia: Her hematocrit was  consistent with baseline, with expected drop from GI bleeding.
Blood tests and CT showed that you had blockage in the ducts that drain the liver.
