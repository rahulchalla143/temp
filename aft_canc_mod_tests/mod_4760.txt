His muscle strengths are [**4-19**] at all muscle groups, except for weakness in the proximal lower extremities at 4-/5.
His reflexes are 0 bilaterally.
Sensory examination is intact to touch and proprioception.
Coordination examination does not reveal dysmetria.
Pertinent Results: [**2194-2-5**] CTA Chest No evidence of pulmonary embolism, thoracic aortic dissection, pneumonia.
Labs on admission showed a sodium of 120 and potassium of 1.7.
His FeNa was <0.1 but urine osmolality >300 so there was also likely an element of SIADH in setting of GBM.
(4) History of Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's INR was elevated on admission (likely due to poor PO intake causing alteration of gut flora), therefore his Coumadin was held until [**2194-2-9**] when her was restarted on his prior regimen (5 mg 4x/week and 4 mg 3x/week).
His INR will be monitored as an outpatient in the acute rehabilitation facility.
Further management will be per primary oncologist  (6) Steroid Myopathy: The patient was evaluated and treated by PT and will be discharged to rehabilitation for further therapy.
