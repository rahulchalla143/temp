Staging screening revealed locally advanced disease with Right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
PET and CT did reveal other lesions including renal and splenic masses felt to not be consistent with metastatic disease.
The patient was seen by outpatient Heme/Onc and CT surgery.
The patient underwent pre-op evaluation including outpatient stress testing.
The patient was scheduled for outpatient bronchoscopy on Thursday [**10-24**] for further biopsy and imaging of the lesion.
Bronchospopy revealed obstructive lesion of the Right mainstem due to a RUL tumor.
PET scan from [**2160-10-2**] demonstrates an FDG avid right hilar mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, there was an unusual focus of FDG uptake and soft tissues prominence along the left posterior psoas of unclear significance.
He had a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis on [**2160-9-14**], which demonstrated pulmonary embolus, mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy, ground glass and consolidative opacities concerning for hemorrhage, marked scarring and emphysema in the right upper lobe, nonspecific pulmonary nodules, several subcentimeter vague hypoattenuating foci in the liver, a large 3 to 4 cm nonspecific lesion in the spleen, and a 30 mm lesion along the lower pole of the left kidney.
An MRI of the head on [**2160-9-14**] showed no evidence of intracranial metastases.
Patient underwent recent stress test as part of pre-op eval for possible lung mass excision.
CTA chest ([**2160-10-20**]): 1.
Portable CXR ([**2160-10-20**]): Near complete resolution of right lower lobe consolidation, with unchanged right upper lobe opacities.
Lower extremity ultrasound ([**2160-9-15**]): No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
MRI ([**2160-9-14**]):  No evidence of intracranial metastasis.
[**Month/Day/Year **] Scan ([**2160-9-15**]): No definite evidence for osseous metastases.
CT abd/pelvis ([**2160-9-14**]): 1.
To evaluate the significance of this finding, further correlation with prior studies could be most helpful.

Patients HCT was stable throughout his hospital course.
Pt underwent rigid bronchoscopy and argon ablation for neovascularization in the right mainstem bronchi.
A biospy was also done of the left lung.
The patient's hematocrit was stable throughout the stay.
The patient was recently seen by outpatient heme/onc and outpatient CT surgery.
Bronchoscopy for visualization of bleed and mass, biopsies were to rule out a bronchogenic component of the cancer.
