There he received a lumbar spine MRI (details below) that showed likely osteomyelitis of L1 with compression fracture, and liekly disckisits of adjacent disks.

The post-contrast images show abnornal enhancement in the anterior epidural space which could represent neoplasm (15:10).
Recommend correlation with CT of the abdomen with contrast  [**6-13**] CT: Torso/Pelvis w/ Contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**7-14**]: L-Spine AP/Lateral: IMPRESSION: There is no change in hardware position or alignment compared to the intraoperative images from [**7-7**].
The prior vertebral body biopsy (S10-[**Numeric Identifier 87643**] L) has been reviewed.
L1 Compression Fracture/Vertebrectomy: His outside MRI sugggestive of osteo and fracture of L1, with diskitis of T12-L1, L1-L2.
CT/MRI were performed at [**Hospital1 18**] that were suspicious for lytic lesions of the spine and a lung lesion rather than the initial suspicion of infection.
A pelvis and torso CT showed a R lung mass concerning for a primary malignancy.
# Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: Due to CT findings of right lung mass, the patient underwent a CT guided biopsy of his spine, which revealed metastatic squamous cell lung cancer.
# Hypercalcemia: He initially had a mildly elevated Calcium during his hospitalization, and he received fluids.
His diabetes remained stable throughout the hospitalization.
His lisinopril was held as his blood pressure was low and he had one episode of orthostatic hypotension.
You had a CT scan of the torso and pelvis which revealed a mass in the right lung.
We did a biopsy showing that you have cancer in your lung that spread to your back.
Stopped your lisinopril - please discuss restarting this medication with your primary doctor   Followup Instructions: You should call the thoracic oncology clinic at ([**2149**] to set up an appointment for 2-4 weeks from now.
