He was then brought to the ED for further eval.
In the ED, initial VS were: HR 80, 140/90, 25, 88-93% on BIPAP.
proBNP: 2129, WBC was 10.2 (N:74 Band:0 L:10 M:15 E:1 Bas:0),Trop-T: <0.01.
He also had a CTA which did not show a PE or other acute lung process.
He was then given 80mg of IV lasix which he responded well with 900cc of urine output in the ED and 300cc on arrival to the floor.

This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2134-9-2**] at 10:50:10 AM   FINAL Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-3-27**], the findings are similar.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2134-9-2**] 3:21 AM FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is almost unchanged evidence of moderate pulmonary edema.
He has required increased pressures at night with high O2 flow which has improved his saturation overnight.
His O2 sats have remained stable in the low 90%s on BIPAP of 20/18 with 10L of O2.
During the day he uses 2-4 L of O2 N/C to maintain his sats >90%.
He had an Echo on [**9-2**] which showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
His increase in sleep due to better controlled hypoxia may also have contributed to his improving symtoms.
- continue carbamazepime, risperidone, and benztropine - He will need to have close monitoring and follow-up with psychiatry for titration of medications.
- EKG weekly while for QT prolongation until stabilized on psych med regimen  # DM II: as per notes most of his gluc has been in the low to mid 100s.
Medications on Admission: -Aripiprazole 20 mg PO/NG DAILY -Aspirin 81 mg PO/NG DAILY -Acetaminophen 325-650 mg PO/NG Q6H:PRN pain - Carbamazepine 200 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **] -Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **] -Doxepin HCl 10 mg PO/NG HS -Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY -Risperidone 3 mg PO BID   [**Hospital1 **] Medications: 1. doxepin 10 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO HS (at bedtime).
Titrate for O2 saturations greater than 90%.
Your BiPap (sleep mask) settings were increased to keep your oxygen level above 90%.
The following changes were made to your medications: - STOPPED Aripiprazole - INCREASED Risperidone to 4mg by mouth two times a day - INCREASED Carbamazepine to 200mg by mouth four times a day - STARTED benztropine mesylate 0.5mg once a day as needed for abnormal muscle movements  Please take all medications as prescribed, and follow-up with psychiatry, cardiology, and your sleep [**Hospital1 21334**] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] from rehab.
