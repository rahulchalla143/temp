There is a small vacuum phenomenon anteriorly in the vertebral body, and tiny vacuum phenomenon in the T4-5 and T5-6 intervertebral discs.
CT T-spine [**8-24**]: FINDINGS: The patient is status post recent posterior fusion of T2 to T7 with placement of posterior fusion construct and bony fusion material, and intervertebral cage placement at T4-T5, and extensive post-surgical changes in the region.
IMPRESSION: Immediately status post posterior fusion, from the T2 to T7 level, with T4-T5 partial corpectomy and intervertebral cage placement, and significant streak artifact limiting evaluation for epidural hemorrhage, with: 1.
LENIS [**8-29**]: FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.
CTA of Chest [**8-29**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are no filling defects within the pulmonary arterial vasculature.
Multiple soft tissue metastatic nodules within the left upper and lower lobes have increased in size compared to the PET CT of [**2124-7-25**] concerning for disease progression.
There is no CT evidence of hardware loosening.
Worsening widespread thoracic metastatic disease compared to the PET CT of [**2124-7-25**].
Surface Echo [**8-30**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-12-4**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher and the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed.
Based on [**2121**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is asymptomatic, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**2-18**] years.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2124-9-6**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2124-9-6**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.

SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST..     Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2124-9-2**]):       REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 4322**] @ 1440, [**2124-9-2**].
Metestatic NSCL: Patient underwent T4-T5 corpectomy/cage, T3-6 laminectomy, post instrumentation and fusion T2-T7 on [**2124-8-24**].
He may bear weight but must not lift more than 10 pounds.
Head MRI [**9-6**] showed vasogenic edema, slightly worse, but no new mets.
An EEG was performed, the results of which were pending at the time of discharge.
No evidence of PE on CTA [**2124-8-29**], and repeated CXRs showed an evolving PNA on top of underlying neoplastic disease.
Blood gases showed CO2 retention with a mixed acid-base disorder.
Blood cultures from [**9-1**] eventually grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus in [**3-22**] bottles, likely a contaminant.
A total of approximately 500cc of blood was lost.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable but anemic, in the range of 25-28%.
