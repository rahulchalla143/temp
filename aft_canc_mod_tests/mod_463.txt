She had a vaginal pack in place along with the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain, two nephroureteral stents, bilateral nephrostomy tubes which were present preoperatively, a pulmonary arterial line, an arterial line, an nasogastric tube and peripheral intravenous lines.
Her x-rays that were performed postoperatively revealed both ureteral stents to be in the mid to proximal ureters.
The morning of postoperative day #8 her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was removed as it was draining small amounts of fluid and the creatinine from this fluid revealed it was consistent with peritoneal fluid and not urine.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.9, heartrate 84, blood pressure 136/74, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased effort.
Her previous [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain site is covered with a dressing and intact.
Should the patient develop left flank pain or have minimal output from her loop for an extended period of time, the left nephrostomy could be placed back to gravity drainage but we would like to keep this capped in an effort to have it removed at the postoperative visit.
LABORATORY DATA:  All laboratory data from [**2180-6-14**] - White blood cell count 11,000, hematocrit 29, platelets 305,000.
PT 15.5, PTT 33.6, INR 1.6, sodium 136, potassium 3.7, chloride 105, bicarbonate 20, BUN 11, creatinine 0.9, glucose 66, magnesium 1.8.
