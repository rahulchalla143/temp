BAL CULTURE: NGTD SPUTUM CULTURE: 1 COLONY OF ASPERGILLUS FUMIGATUS BLOOD CULTLURES: NGTD MYCOLYTIC AND AFB BLOOD CULTURES: NGTD .
Imaging: ======= TTE [**2174-5-26**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-5-16**], the global left ventricular systolic function is worse.
TTE ([**2174-7-4**]) Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional and global systolic dysfunction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-6-29**], global left ventricular systolic function is minimally improved (some regionality was suggested on review of the prior study) and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation is now reduced.
TTE [**2174-7-7**] LVEF: 40% to 45% The left atrium is dilated.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-7-4**], overall function has increased slightly due to slight improvement in inferior/inferoseptal/inferolateral segments.
CARDIAC MRI .
There was a diffuse increase in signal intensity of the myocardium on the T2 images which may be consistent with edema or inflammation.
In the future, gadolinium enhanced images may be useful for the assessment of myocardial fibrosis (gadolinium was not given on the current study due to low eGFR).
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: .
This examination is not tailored to evaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures, except to note normal appearance of the included portions of the liver, spleen, and adrenal glands.
CHEST CT .
SINUS CT .
Mild pansinus mucosal disease, with air-fluid levels seen in the left maxillary and right sphenoid sinuses.
ECHO [**2174-8-4**] The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-7-27**], the previously mentioned wall motion abnormalities appear to have improved and the global left ventricular systolic function is now near-normal.
Brief Hospital Course: 38-year-old female with ALL s/p double cord blood SCT [**1-/2173**] c/b GVHD, CHF secondary to anthracycline induced cardiomyopathy, embolic CVA on coumadin presented with altered mental status, ascites secondary to congestive hepatopathy, and acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation presumed to be secondary to cardiac GVHD with initial EF <10%.
Given INR of ~ 16, a CT head was performed not indicating an intracranial bleed.
Paracentesis was performed on ascites that was not suggestive of peritonitis.
Her ECHO on admission was read as 20%, but upon further review by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] was <10% consistent with profoundly low cardiac output.
She had myocardial biopsies in the past not showing T-cell infiltration based on prior pathology records, however, it was theorized that her presentation was most likely a result of GVHD affecting the heart.
On transfer out the CCU, she was net negative 13.9 L. Repeat TTE showed LVEF 35%.
Ejection fraction plummeted from 40 to 20%.
Initial numbers: RA pressure of 20, wedge 12, CI of 1.2, pulm vasc resistence 560, PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 38.
With inhaled NO:  no significant change in PA pressures, wedge pressures increased to 31, PVR decreased further to 160 indicating significantly improved LV filling.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient baseline creatinine 2.5 - 3.0 with admission Cr 3.8.
Renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction.
Her creatinine trended down with diuresis.
Throughout the remainder of her course, creatinine fluctuated as her cardiac output changed.
Nasal swab returned positive for parainfluenza 3.
A sputum collection was also collected; 1 colony of aspergillus fumigatus grew out of the patient's culture.
# Transaminitis:  Worsened on admission compared to last set of outpatient labs on [**5-20**].
Hepatology was consulted and felt that clinical picture represented cholestatic hepatitis, but may be having fulminant hepatic failure if INR not due to coumadin effect.
LFTs were trended, multiple hepatic markers were checked and negative, and diagnostic paracentesis revealed SAAG >1.1.
Coumadin and Fluconazole were held, and INR trended down.
On day of discharge, the patient's INR was 1.1. .
The joint fluid was sterile and contained a large number of marcrophages and lymphocytes as did the peritoneal fluid sampled during her last admission.
The patient repeatedly refused the MRI of the knee.
# Hyponatremia: Sodium trended down to mid-120s during diuresis likely from heart failure given decreased effective circulating volume in addition to usage of thiazide.
Her calcium was increased and was given IV when symptomatic.
Vitamin D level was extremely low so patient was started on 50,000 units qweek.
Hematology was following with impression of thrombotic microangiopathy from HIT, medication side effect, or other etiology based on blood smear and rising hemolysis markers.
Her HIT PF4 antibody returned weakly positive but a serotonin assay was negative.
# Normocytic anemia: Patient was admitted with Hct 34.5 that trended down to 22.8 requiring 2 units of pRBC.
Her INR was supratherapeutic at time of admission and was held.
Neurologic exam was monitored and non-focal.
# Abdominal pain: Extensive work-up in past with no clear etiology.

Host Disease and high blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary arterial hypertension).
You underwent cardiac catheterization to diagnose pulmonary hypertension and were started on nifedipine and sildenafil to treat pulmonary hypertension.
A sputum culture that was collected grew out a mold called Aspergillus fumigatus so you were started on Voriconazole for treatment.
As part of the work-up to determine where this mold may have come from, you had a CT of your sinuses, which did not show evidence of infection.
