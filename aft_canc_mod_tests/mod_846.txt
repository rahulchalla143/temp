CT scan at the OSH revealed a small fat containing umbilical hernia with minimal fat stranding concerning for incarceration.
His KUB showed fecal loading in the rectum so he was given milk of magnesia and mg Citrate.

Past Medical History: - Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, [**2115**], s/p CHOP, complete remission, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**].

[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2127-9-24**], the findings appear similar.
CXR 2/25/0: CHEST, AP AND LATERAL VIEWS: There is an AICD overlying the left chest wall, with leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, similar in appearance to prior study.
CT from [**Hospital3 7362**] [**2129-2-10**]: Wet Read: [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 20005**] [**Doctor First Name **] [**2129-2-10**] 4:40 PM Tiny fat containing umbilical hernia with additional tiny ventral wall defects.
TECHNIQUE: A non-contrast CT of the torso was obtained at [**Hospital1 **] on [**2129-2-10**] at 10:41 a.m., and submitted for consultation.
CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A pacer overlies the left chest wall.
Few scattered mediastinal lymph nodes are not enlarged by CT size criteria.
Diffuse hazy ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs may relate to exhalation during the study or edema.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A small amount of perihepatic free fluid is decreased in extent from [**2124-1-21**].
Collapsed gallbladder, containing high-density contents, likely reflective of numerous stones.
His KUB showed improved bowel distention.
The patient was transferred to the medical floor on 6 L nc but this was turned down to 2 L and he maintained saturations of 96%.
His CXR showed no pleural effusion, but his CT showed emphysema with suggestion of mild fluid overload.
BNP was grossly elevated at 7940, however his BNP was elevated above 7000+ for all prior lab values except for one checked 2 weeks ago that was 5000.
His creatinine was elevated above baseline at 1.4.
Because his BP was in the high 80s (basline is low 90s) he was not diuresed aggresively.
An echo was obtained which showed EF of 30% and similar findings compared to prior echo in [**2126**].
On rectal exam there was no stool in the vault for manual dissempaction.
However, KUB showed significant stool in the distal colon and rectal vault.
Urine and blood cultures were taken but did not grow any organisms.
The patient remained afebrile and his white count trended down.
Here at [**Hospital1 18**] the patient's UA showed few bacteria, WBCs and RBCs.
He had an elevated white count with 86% neutrophils so he was started on aztreonam for UTI.
However, his urine culture ended up not growing anything so the aztreonam was stopped.
His INR was found to be supratheraputic at 6.9.
His INR trended down and was __ on discharge.
