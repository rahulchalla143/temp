EKG's [**2-1**] - NSR at 88 bpm, 1 mm STD's and TWI's V4-V6, TWI's I & AVL  [**2-3**] - NSR at 84 bpm, resolved TWI's and STD's V4-V6; still w/ TWI's I & AVL (ols changes compared to [**5-/2136**])  [**2138-2-7**]:  IMPRESSION:  1)  AV fistulogram demonstrated complete thrombosis of the brachiocephalic vein fistula.
The lung examination is somewhat limited by respiratory motion.
Studies were not done on the initial specimen showing a spun Hct >50%.
A thoracentesis was done which showed an exudative effusion on the right, the side of the hemothorax, and a transudative effusion on the left.
Gram stain and culture were negative; however, the patient was on antibiotics (levofloxacin) at the time of the tap for treatment of post-intubation tracheobronchitis.
By the time of discharge he had stable small bilateral pleural effusions by CXR and was saturating well on room air, not short of breath.
CXR, chest CT, abdominal CT, blood cultures, urinalysis, and urine cultures were nondiagnostic.
Sputum grew gram negative rods E. coli and Enterobacter.
As no findings were seen on CXR or chest CT, this was attributed to tracheobronchitis and treated with a 7day course of levofloxacin.
A swallow study was done once the patient was more alert and initially showed risk of aspiration.
Two days prior to discharge a repeat swallow study was done.
LFTs showed mildly elevated transaminases, normal alk phos and total bilirubin, and moderately elevated lipase and amylase.
History of DVT:  the patient had a DVT diagnosed in [**4-18**].
Echo was done and showed mild [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1915**], 1+MR, otherwise normal.
Type II diabetes mellitus:  he was monitored with QID fingersticks and treated with a regular insulin sliding scale.
His counts remained stable throughout the hospitalization.
Subsequent IM injections were held, and the CK trended down to normal.
Communication is with the patient and his wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 32904**].
