Name:  [**Known lastname 14848**], [**Known firstname 14849**]                     Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 14850**]  Admission Date:  [**2198-10-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2198-10-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2136-9-25**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital1 1098**] MEDICINE  ADDENDUM:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old female with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer to the pleura, pericardium, and ocular, stage IV, diagnosed in [**2198-9-4**], who is status post her second therapeutic thoracentesis on [**2198-10-5**] when an outpatient echocardiogram revealed tamponade.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE CCU:  Temperature 98.8, oxygen saturations around 98% on room air, pulse 117, blood pressure 130/84, weight 133 pounds.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA AND X-RAYS ON ADMISSION:  EKG revealed sinus rhythm but diffuse low voltages and increased rate with new electrical alternans consistent with pericardial effusion.
An echocardiogram performed at that time revealed a normal left atrium, normal left ventricle, left ventricle ejection fraction greater than 55%, right ventricle systolic function was normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  After admission to the CCU, the patient underwent a pericardial tap which revealed around 800 cc of serosanguinous fluid from the pericardium.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed which once again showed normal left atrium, normal left ventricle.
A portable chest x-ray obtained on [**2198-10-6**] revealed interval increase in pleural fluid on the right.
An EKG obtained on [**2198-10-6**] revealed sinus rhythm, diffuse low voltages but no electrical alternans.
An ultrasound of the right lower extremity was performed for right lower extremity edema, greater than left, but revealed no evidence of DVT.
An echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricle again with left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%, normal RV, and a small pericardial effusion with no evidence of compromise.
On [**2198-10-8**], an AP and lateral chest x-ray were again obtained which revealed a stable right pleural effusion and a slight increase in a small left-sided effusion.
An EKG again revealed diffuse low voltages and sinus tachycardia.
An echocardiogram performed later that day revealed a small loculated pericardial effusion with fibrin or thrombus on the surface of the heart.
The patient was saturating 92-95% on room air, had a blood pressure in the 100-120s/60-70s.
That evening, the patient's blood pressure was about 80/50.
She was asymptomatic and her examination unchanged.
She was monitored closely and her blood pressure increased to 100s/70s without intervention.
On [**2198-10-9**], the patient continued to be stable with a blood pressure in the 100-110s/50s-70s.
Her oxygen saturations in room air and walking were 92-95%.
