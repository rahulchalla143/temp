Bone marrow core biopsy [**4-7**]-     Relapsed precursor B- acute lymphoblastic leukemia MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
Red blood cells are reduced in number, normochromic with anisopoikilocytosis including occasional macroovalocytes and spherocytes seen.
A nucleated red blood cell is seen on scan.
The white blood cell count appears decreased.
Platelet count appears decreased; large and giant forms are seen.
Differential shows 50% neutrophils, 1% monocytes, 47% lymphocytes, 0% eosinophils, 1% basophil, 1% myelocytes.
Differential (500 cells) shows:  80% Blasts, 1% Promyelocytes, 1% Myelocytes, 1% Metamyelocytes, <1% Bands/Neutrophils, 10% Lymphocytes, 7% Erythroid.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation.
Imaging: CXR [**4-7**]- Right PIC line passes as far as the low SVC.
CT Chest [**4-8**]- 1.
Transthoracic echocardiogram [**4-13**]- The left atrium is normal in size.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-12-4**], no change (very small pericardial effusion was seen on prior).
CT sinuses [**4-13**]- There is mild to moderate mucosal thickening and aerosolized secretions in the bilateral maxillary, sphenoid, and frontal sinuses.
Noncontrast head CT [**4-15**]- 1.
MRI Head [**4-16**]- 1.
Sinus disease is not changed compared to CT yesterday.
20min EEG [**4-16**]- This routinely acquired EEG is moderate to moderately severely encephalopathy.
EEG [**4-17**]- The recording showed often rhythmic and very persistent, approximately 2 Hz, generalized sharp wave activity throughout most of the record with brief periods of diminished sharp wave activity, as described above.
EEG [**4-18**]- The continuous EEG showed rhythmic generalized 2 Hz sharp wave discharges throughout most of the recording.
There were a few breaks of several minutes at a time when discharges were far less frequent and an encephalopathic background was more prominent.
EEG [**4-19**]- The recording showed rhythmic generalized 2 Hz sharp wave discharges through midnight at the end of [**4-19**].
EEG [**4-20**]- The background remained slow, disorganized, and indicative of an encephalopathy throughout.
CT chest w/o contrast [**4-21**]- 1.
CXR [**4-25**]- Right infrahilar consolidation and pleural effusion appear to be even more prominent than on the prior examination.
Heart size and mediastinum are stable.
Narrowing of the proximal trachea due to thyroid enlargement is noted, better appreciated on the CT chest from [**2133-4-21**].
CXR [**4-28**] - There has been interval improvement of the right lower lung consolidation and decrease in size of the right pleural effusion.
RUQ ultrasound [**5-6**] - Gallbladder is distended, contains echogenic material in its lumen and shows some mild wall thickening.
The gallbladder distention is more pronounced compared to the previous ultrasound examination of [**2132-10-20**].
HIDA scan [**5-6**] - 1.
CXR [**5-6**] - Newly occurred right basal parenchymal opacity, in addition to a right pleural effusion.
A wet read was delivered at the time of image acquisition.
CXR [**5-10**] - Cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion and mild perihilar edema are present, the latter slightly worse compared to the prior examination.
Bone marrow biopsy consistent with relapsed ALL with BCR-ABL translocation.
Keppra, which was held due to concern for myelosuppression, was restarted, and on [**4-16**], when the patient's mental status continued to rapidly decline, a 20 min EEG confirmed non-convulsive seizures.
Two LPs were performed with no clear infectious source.
Nasopharyngeal RSV was positive so patient received pavalizumab, as this helped during last admission.
Valproic acid level remained therapeutic, and 24 hour EEG performed did not show further evidence of seizures.
The's patient's family refused further EEG monitoring for patient's comfort.
RUQ ultrasound and HIDA were without evidence of obstruction.
MRI performed during admission showed no inflammation to suggest extension of mucor.
Stool was consistently guaiac positive with stable hematocrit.
