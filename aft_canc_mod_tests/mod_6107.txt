**FINAL REPORT [**2139-7-10**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2139-7-10**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
BLOOD CULTURES NEGATIVE TO DATE X2 .
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Within the visualized left lower lobe are two pulmonary metastases, measuring 1.5 cm and 1.9 cm, which are larger compared to [**2139-5-29**], previously measured 1.1 cm x 1.4 cm respectively.
Also scattered within the mass are linear and rounded hyperdense foci, which on a chest CT, from [**2139-5-29**], appears similar, and may reflect areas of calcification.
The liver, spleen, pancreas, right adrenal gland, and right kidney are unremarkable.
Scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are not enlarged by CT size criteria.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder and rectum are unremarkable.
[**2139-7-9**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
[**2139-7-14**]  CXR IMPRESSION: Clear improvement of temporary pulmonary congestion pattern [**2139-7-8**], consistent with fluid overload and temporary left-sided congestion.
Of note, her Coumadin which was a home med given AFib/Flutter issues, was held through admission and CONTINUES to be held, in the setting of hematuria and potential for bleeding into renal mass.
She was called out of MICU in stable condition and had no further unstable events, although she did have occasional RVR which was treated with nodal agents as below.
All blood cultures were negative.
IMPORTANTLY though, she was stopped on her home Coumadin dosage due to a supratherapeutic INR which peaked to 5.0 and hematuria.
Her INR was normal by discharge, she got PO Vitamin K. .
LUQ abd pain: Likely due to very large renal mass, LFT's and lipase were normal.
Chest pain: Cardiac enzyme negative x2 and without worrisome EKG changes to suggest cardiac etiology.
She had an echo with a normal EF >55%, mild MR, and mild pulmHTN.
She also became slightly volume overloaded by physical exam and CXR showing mild volume overload and small bilateral pleural effusions and so was gently diuresed with good improvement in her O2 sats to 95-96% RA and also clearing of her CXR.
Medications on Admission: Sutent 50mg daily Ferrous sulfate 325mg daily Warfarin 5mg daily (10mg on Sunday) Singulair 10mg daily Celebrex 200mg daily Verapamil 240mg daily Citalopram 20mg daily Zolpidem 10mg daily Alprazolam 0.5mg Q8H PRN  Discharge Medications: 1.
