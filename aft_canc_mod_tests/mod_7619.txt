Head CT [**11-4**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Abdominal Plain Film [**10-22**]: A SINGLE VIEW OF THE ABDOMEN demonstrates surgical clips, likely related to prior vascular procedure, projecting over the L3 vertebral body.
CT Torso [**10-23**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI [**10-23**]: Left cerebellar 2-cm enhancing lesion, most likely due to metastasis.

Brief Hospital Course: 81M with known lung mass for which was reportedly refused workup for greater than 1 year, PET +, likely adenocarcinoma, recent admission for post obstructive pneumonia with increasing size of mass seen on chest CT scan, to undergo bronch next month.
He underwent MRI imaging with further identified the lesion within the cerebellum.
He also had a CT of the torso which identified a hilar mass causing some degree of stenosis on the pulmonary system.
Pathology of the bronchoscopy has revealed small cell carcinoma.
