Labs were significant for lactate 3.2 and WBC 2.1.
Head CT (obtained to r/o ICH) showed stable R frontal and L temporal mets with edema and bony involvement, but without significant change since [**2144-10-5**].
CXR showed ?
Vitals at the time of transfer: 114/51 110 10 97%2L.
- [**9-/2141**]: Abdominal pain and lower GI bleed, colonoscopy revealed an ulcerated 4-5cm mass in the mid-rectum at 10cm, path showed poorly differentiated carcinoma.
- [**5-/2142**]: Cycle #1 FLOX (5-FU 500mg/m2 D1,8,15 + oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 D1,15 q4wks).
Urgent CT demonstrated nonocclusive thrombus in left renal vein and interval enlargement of sclerotic focus in left aspect of T12.
- [**2142-6-13**]: Bone scan, spine MRI, and CT torso showed multiple bone metsmetastasis.
CT demonstrated small bowel thickening suggestive of enteritis.
CT revealed epiploic appendagitis.
- [**2142-8-21**]: C4 FLOX (dose reduced 5-FU 400 mg/m2 D1,15 + oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 D1,15).
- [**2143-10-9**]: CT TORSO showed increased sclerotic bony metastatic disease unclear if due to disease progression or response to treatment.

Further workup as clinically indicated.
CXR ([**2144-11-9**]): Extent and distribution of rib-based metastases appear overall unchanged since [**Month (only) 359**].
Lower extremity venous ultrasound ([**2144-11-9**])- No evidence of DVT in right or left lower extremity.
CTA Chest ([**2144-11-9**])- 1.
EKG: AFib with rate 156   Brief Hospital Course: 71 year-old man with metastatic rectal CA with brain mets reulting in seizures presenting with tachycardia, fever, and CT findings consistent with multifocal PNA.
CXR showed new multifocal pneumonia, and so broad spectrium antibiotics were initiated (vancomycin, azithromycin, cefepime).
Blood pressure improved with fluid boluses and patient did not require pressors.
All cultures were negative.
CT head in ED showed unchanged vasogenic edema surrounding metastatic disease.
Labs were significant for low reticulocyte count, suggesting bone marrow failure.
