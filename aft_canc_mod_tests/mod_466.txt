Triple phase CT of the liver on [**2188-9-8**] identified a 3.2-cm focal hypodense lesion in segment II with no enhancement in the arterial phase or attenuation in the delayed imaging.
Biopsy (and RFA) were not feasible given the close proximity to the umbilical vein.
While surveillance MRI in [**12-14**] revealed no clear evidence of residual or new disease, the one from [**3-14**] detected an enhancing mass in segment II/[**Doctor First Name 690**], which had  increased in size and represented further growth of residual HCC.
Subsequent ERCP revealed an irregular filling defect in the left main hepatic duct with peripheral dilation.
On [**2189-4-7**], the patient underwent successful CT-guided liver biopsy which demonstrated HCC.
The tumor cells were positive for keratin cocktail, CK7, MOC31, and CEA (focally,) and PAX-2, and negative for HepPar1, CK20, S-100, vimentin, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and RCC.

[**8-9**] Abd U/S: Nondiagnostic ultrasound examination secondary to body habitus and overlying bowel gas.
CT examination recommended.
He developed disease recurrence based on MRI in early [**Month (only) 547**], CT-guided biopsy and precipitous rise in AFP.
Mucositis - this was thought to be secondary to Xeloda, which was stopped on [**7-31**].
Patient was given Gelclair along with magic mouthwash, as well as general oral care.
The axillary culture grew out sparse MSSA, most likely a skin colonizer, but given the patient's neutropenic status, and the plan to continue neutropenic antibiotic coverage, this was of little clinical significance.
On admission blood cultures were taken for both bacterial and fungal etiologies.
Dermatology was consulted and believed the rash looked as if it was viral, and took a biopsy from the axillary area that looked quite similar.
His platelet levels trended down over the hospitalization, and on [**8-13**] he received a unit of platelets for a count of 10 (goal >10).
Based on exam findings, etiology was likely due to encephalopathy from hepatic, infectious, or metabolic causes.
An LP and further imaging were deferred.
A RUQ ultrasound was attempted to evaluate for portal vein thrombus, but given the patient's large body habitus, the liver and its vasculature could not be visualized.
Another possibility that was entertained was encephalitis secondary to toxic levels of the patient's xeloda.
Given the patient's improvement in mental status, no MRI of the brain was pursued to evaluate this hypothesis.
His cxray showed increased bibasilar atelectasis, and his WBC had begun to increased to 3.8 (with 17 bands) from 1.9 the day prior.
His WCC continued to rise to 15, and his lactate rose to 4.
He had worsening infiltrates on CXR and his mental status continued to deteriorate.
His bilirubin and INR began to rise.
