Operative specimen showed suboptimal necrosis (only 5% necrosis) and her postoperative chemotherapy was switched to AP alternating with IE (ifosfamide/etoposide).
This was followed by observation and in [**2195-5-24**] one of the nodules became very large (over 10 cm) and began to cause symptoms.

STUDIES: CT CHEST with CONTRAST IMPRESSION [**8-20**]: 1) 16 x 15 x 10cm, new prevascular mediastinal mass occluding a long segment of the superior vena cava, severely compromising the right bronchial tree and right lung pulmonary circulation invading the pericardium, accompanied by new and/or enlarging right lung nodules and bilateral pleural effusions.
ECHO [**8-20**]:The left and right atria appear compressed by an extrinsic mass.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-12-20**], the atria now appear compressed by an extrinsic mass.
[**8-20**] Bilateral LENIs: negative .
CXR [**8-23**]: Markedly increased bilateral basal consolidations are seen accompanied by bilateral increase in pleural effusion.

1) Mediastinal Mass/SVC syndrome:  Patient has developed a large medistinal mass compressing right upper lobe bronchus, shifting mediastinum to left and compressing right and left atria seen on CT scan.
ECHO done confirming left and right atrial compression, but only physiologic effusion.
After CT scan was ordered showing SVC syndrome, right upper lobe lung compression, subsegmental PE, possible pericardial invasion and compression of right and left atria on Echo, she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**8-20**] for closer monitoring.
She remained tachycardic 120-130's (although has been for 1 month) and bp stayed 95-110 systolic (also stable for a month).
Pulmonary performed thoracentesis of L pleural effusion.
Sent for cell count/diff, LDH, total protein, cultures and cytology.
Physician exam revealed patient had died.
6) Non anion gap acidosis- consistent with persistent hyperventilation.
