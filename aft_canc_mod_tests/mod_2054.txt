Bone marrow biopsy done at the time demonstrated recurrence of AML, so she was enrolled in a trial of AraC +/- clofarabine ([**Date range (1) 36125**]).
Day 22 BM biopsy [**2169-11-30**] showed persistant disease.
Today her visiting nurse found her to have a temperature of 102.
She has an erythematous papular rash on her nose that she states is not new for her and is not pruritic or painful - feels this is irritation from tissues for runny nose.
She denies any localizing symptoms such as headache, neck pain, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, or dysuria.
She underwent partial gastrectomy, radiation therapy, and CHOP chemotherapy.
Her counts were significant for a white blood count of 2.6, hematocrit 31.1, and platelet count of 23,000.
Bone marrow biopsy after resolution of the pneumonia showed myelodysplastic syndrome with increased blasts (5-10% with trilineage dysplasia), thought to be [**3-5**] her prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplant.Chromosomal studies revealed chromosome abnormalities of deletion 5, 7 and 20. .
A bone marrow biopsy on [**2169-8-14**] was consistent with increasing blasts to 10% in the marrow.
She underwent induction with Idarubicin and Ara-C on [**2169-8-30**].
Bone marrow biopsy [**10-26**] showed recurrence of leukemia.
Had a P-Mibi for further evaluation which confirmed moderate perfusion defect of PDA territory and medium sized, severe perfusion defect of LAD territory as well as severe systolic dysfunction.
The decision was made to defer cardiac catheterization until oncologic issues had been resolved.
Repeat echo showed that EF was stable at 35-40%.
Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS - T 99.3, BP 101/63, RR 20, HR 92, 100%RA GENERAL - Well-appearing female NAD, comfortable HEENT - NC/AT, PERRLA, [**Country 3899**], sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear NECK - Supple, no thyromegaly, no JVD, no carotid bruits LUNGS - CTA bilat, no r/rh/wh, good air movement, resp unlabored, no accessory muscle use HEART - RRR, no MRG, nl S1/S2 ABDOMEN - NABS, soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding EXTREMITIES - WWP, no c/c/e, 2+ peripheral pulses (radials, DPs)  SKIN - Maculopapular rash on nose; several macules, dark red in color, on dorsal surface of feet bilaterally NEURO - Awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**6-5**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout  Pertinent Results: Chest radiograph, portable ([**2169-12-4**]): In comparison with study of [**11-16**], allowing for the portable technique, there is little change.
CT chest without contrast ([**2169-12-6**]): 1.
Bone marrow biopsy ([**2169-12-21**]): HYPOCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE FIBROSIS, MARROW REGENERATION AND INCREASED MYELOBLASTS.
By immunohistochemistry, CD34 highlights mononuclear cells which comprise approximately 10% of the cellularity.
CD117 and MPO stain approximately 30% of cells.
Chest radiograph, 2-view ([**2169-12-29**]): Minimal right perihilar atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo F with AML admitted with fever and neutropenia, noted to have persistent leukemic involvement of bone marrow, who underwent allogeneic SCT during this hospitalization.
A bone marrow biopsy on [**2169-12-21**] again showed marrow regeneration with persistent involvement by acute leukemia.
Another bone marror biopsy was performed on [**1-16**], which revealed a hypocellular bone marrow and <5% blasts.
The patient started conditioning therapy on [**2170-2-9**] and received a SCT on [**2170-2-16**].
On [**3-19**], her bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of residual leukemia.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy showed persistent blasts, (20-30%) consistent with recurrent leukemia.
The patient received neurology checks every hour, and she had multiple CTs of her head, which did not show a progression of this hemorrhage.
Neurology performed a 24 hour EEG which did not show any evidence of seizure activity.
Neutropenic fever/other infections - The patient presented to the hospital with a neutropenic fever.
In early [**Month (only) 1096**], the patient had a CT chest which revealed bilateral bronchopneumonia.
A BAL was performed on [**1-3**], which did not show any evidence of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], Mycobacteria, or viral etiologies.
Hemodynamics - Patient was placed on a low-dose beta-blocker.
During hospital course she experienced episodes of hypotension when maintenance fluids were stopped requiring continuation at low rate (75 cc/hour).
Echo was found to have improvement to EF of 50%.
EKG unchanged.
Cardiac Enzymes were flat.
Cards was c/s and stated that the patient would not be a candidate for cardiac catheterization of POBA, as she is unable to take Plavix or ASA long-term.
Posaconazole was changed to Micofungin as a possible source for elevated transaminases, and a RUQ U/S was performed which showed stones in the gallbladder and CBD.
A J-tube was placed as the patient had a past partial gastrectomy for a gastric cancer.
A barium study revealed an obstruction above the site of the J-tube, but the J-tube itself and distal bowel was unobstructed.
As her Albumin was low Surgery said she was not a surgical candidate.
GI did not think a scope was warranted as her hct was stable and her stools were guiac negative.
Transfused to keep her plt above 50.
Discharge Medications: None-expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: 1.
Unfortunately, a repeat bone marrow biopsy showed recurrent leukemia.
