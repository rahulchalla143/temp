Given the patient's abdominal pain, a CT scan was obtained in the Emergency Department which revealed a thrombus of the superior mesenteric vein.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical examination, in the Emergency Department, the patient had a temperature of 99.8, pulse was 85, blood pressure was 134/57, respiratory rate was 16, oxygen saturation was 96.
His head and neck examination showed moist mucous membranes without scleral icterus.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His cardiovascular examination showed an irregular rhythm, a soft 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
Lymph nodes demonstrated no neck, axillary, or groin lymphadenopathy.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On admission the patient was noted to have  white blood cell count of 15.7, hematocrit was 28.7, and platelet count of 213.
The differential on the patient's white blood cell count showed 84.5 neutrophils, 11.1 lymphocytes, 4.3 monocytes, 0.1 eosinophils, 0.1 basophils.
The patient's coagulations showed a slightly elevated INR of 1.3.
The patient's urinalysis was negative on admission.
Electrolytes on admission demonstrated sodium was 133, potassium was 3.7, blood urea nitrogen was 23, creatinine was 1.2.
The patient's liver function tests were essentially normal with a total bilirubin of 1.4, and a lipase of 35, transaminase was slightly elevated.
Albumin was 3.7, calcium was 9.4, phosphorous was 3.6, magnesium was 1.6.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted for workup of the abdominal mass noted on CT scan, for treatment of diarrhea, and for evaluation of superior mesenteric vein clot.
A CT scan was reviewed.
The Vascular Surgery Service also recommended a CT angiogram of the abdomen to be obtained to delineate the pancreatic area given a small amount of stranding seen around the pancreas, there was a question it may be an abdominal mass versus a recurrent of his non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
His abdominal examination was felt to be benign.
On [**2180-4-17**] the patient's hematocrit was noted to be decreased to a value of 25.
On [**2180-4-17**], a CT angiogram was obtained.
This CT angiogram demonstrated a prominent periaortic lymph node in the chest which were consistent with old lymphomatotic disease.
A deep venous thrombosis was noted within the pancreas, but there were no other secondary signs of pancreatitis, although there was a small amount of stranding on the original CT scan when the patient was admitted.
It was noted that 4/8 bottles from his blood cultures from the [**4-16**] were growing gram-negative rods in the anaerobic bottles.
The urine culture was negative, as was his stool Clostridium difficile culture.
It was decided given his positive blood cultures to add ceftazidime q.8h.
Of note, the portal vein was patent on the CT scan, however.
Following this procedure, the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 29.2.
His vital signs were noted to be stable with a slight increase in hematocrit.
On [**4-20**], an Infectious Disease consultation was obtained by the Surgical Intensive Care Unit team given the patient's positive blood cultures from admission as well as continued fevers while on intravenous antibiotics.
The assessment was this was a 71-year-old patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in remission with a superior mesenteric vein thrombus and with anaerobic gram-negative rod bacteremia.
Infectious Disease recommended awaiting the speciation of the final gram-negative rod from the blood cultures in order to consolidate antibiotic therapy into a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
His temperature maximum was 100.4, and his urine output was adequate, and his potassium was 4.7.
Their recommendations were for the patient undergo a colonoscopy as well as a esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
On [**4-21**], the anaerobic organism in the patient's blood culture was speciated as Bacteroides fragilis in groups.
His colonoscopy was scheduled for the [**2180-4-23**].
On colonoscopy, the colonoscope revealed two small hyperplastic polyps within the rectum, and the colonoscopy was otherwise normal from the cecum to the terminal ileum.
Vital signs were otherwise stable with good urine output.
On [**4-25**], the patient was also scheduled to undergo a ultrasound-guided biopsy of his lymph nodes.
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 141**] on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**2180-4-27**], for an INR check.
