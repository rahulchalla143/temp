The patient was found to have an obstructive mass in the duodenum, left inguinal lymphadenopathy, ascites, pancreatitis and a bilirubin of 14.4.
The patient underwent an endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography on [**10-7**] with failure to cannulate ampulla resulting in respiratory failure during procedure and intubation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In evaluation on arrival, he was found to have a temperature spike of 104.5 F.; temperature on the Medical Intensive Care Unit was 100.0 F.; 88 pulse; 111/65 blood pressure; MAP 82; respiratory rate 20; 97% on ventilation.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count on admission 13.3, hematocrit 41, bilirubin 3.1, albumin 2.6, AST 75.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for work-up of obstructive jaundice and history of alcoholic pancreatitis.
Endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography was consulted with the recommendation of PTC.
Sections of the duodenum were obtained that showed mucosal eroding ulcerations with active inflammation; biopsy was obtained later which showed chronic inflammatory change and fibrosis; no evidence of malignancy.
Abdominal CT scan with intravenous contrast was obtained showing bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, ascites with hepatobiliary dilatation, presumed pancreatitis, no pancreas masses seen although small probably cystic area in the head of the pancreas seen.
Per IR, long area of stricture of the common bile duct, mild dilatation of the right and left intrahepatic ducts, and a biopsy was obtained of the lower common bile duct which again was negative for malignancy, positive for chronic inflammation changes.
The patient's bilirubin continued to be trending down and right internal hepatic drain was internalized on [**2115-10-21**].
Concern for portal vein thrombus as seen on CT scan.
Repeat right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed normal flow, no evidence of complete obstruction, although presence of thrombus could not be eliminated via this modality.
Ascites were sent for analysis and cytology was pending at time of dictation.
ONCOLOGY:  Preliminary results from lymph node obtained from outside hospital was negative for malignancy.
Surgery was consulted and repeat biopsy was obtained; preliminary results show that it is positive for LCA, CD20 strong positive as well as 100% myotic index, is an indication of a high grade B cell lymphoma histologically, although clinically, the patient does not appear to be succumbing to a high grade lymphoma process.
The patient, at this time, declined further staging work-up and would recommend PET CT scan of the chest to delineate the presence or absence of mediastinal nodes.
CT scan of the abdomen done for obstructive jaundice was negative for intraperitoneal nodes.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient was transferred after intubation from the endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography.
Cytology and chemistries are pending at this time of dictation.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Sputum, bile gram stain negative, blood cultures negative to date.
Hepatology viral cultures pending at time of dictation.
Declining studies for further evaluation and management.
Patient did not have an ERCP at [**Hospital1 18**].
All blood cultures here are negative to date.
