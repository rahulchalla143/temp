Imagies from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital were obtained for evaluation of gastric tumor.
HD 8: Preop evaluation CXR: The heart remains within normal limits in  size and there is no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute pneumonia.
HD 11 POD 1: ([**2123-5-8**]) Patient was transfer to the floor, there were no complications, doing fine, NGT in place with minimal out up.
HD 13 POD4: ([**2123-5-10**]) Ex lap He initially did well, but early in the morning developed a fever associated with some more abdominal pain.
Urine output was dropping.
His white blood cell count dropped to 2.4.
The initial thought was to obtain a CT scan.
However, given the clinical situation, that even if the CT scan did not show a definitive problem in the abdomen this needed to be ruled out as one could not be sure that there was not an occult perforation, especially of the colon.
All suture lines appeared to be intact, including the duodenal closure, the gastrojejunostomy, and the colon anastomosis.
HD 13 POD [**4-1**] ([**2123-5-11**]) Patient was transferred to the floor.
If clinical correlation suggests problems with the afferent limb, CT is recommended.
HD 14 POD [**5-2**] ([**2123-5-12**]) HIDA scan: Severe hepatocellular disease, likely acute hepatitis Hepatology was consulted.
Recommendations as followed - wean and discontinue TPN - start ursodiol 600mg daily - please avoid hepatotoxic medications - check Hepatitis A IgM, Hepatitis B Anti Core Ab, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen, Hepatitic C Antibody to evaluate for possible underlying viral hepatitis: was negative.
HD 15 POD [**6-3**] ( [**2123-5-13**]) CXR: Right basilar consolidation has slightly increased.
Vancomycin was added to his Abx regimen  HD 16 POD [**7-4**]  ([**2123-5-14**]) Physical therapy recommends rehabilitation center when ready to d/c Peritoneal cultures positive for ESCHERICHIA COLI ( resistant Ampi and Genta) and ENTEROCOCCUS SP.
Continue increase on LFT's and T Bili.
CT scan:  1.
HD 28 [**2123-5-25**] Abx were stopped 1/2 strength tube feed started at 10cc/h.
HD 29 [**2123-5-26**] Patient tolerating TPN and regular diet.
