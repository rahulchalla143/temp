Multiple CT scans of her abdomen revealed no evidence of obstruction and the ileus was thought to be secondary to inflammation and irritation from the necrotic omentum.
An arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.22, CO2 100 and a PA2 of 84 on 3 liters of oxygen.
A sputum culture from [**12-18**] subsequently grew MRSA and the patient was treated with a ten day course of Vancomycin.
From a gastrointestinal standpoint a CT of the abdomen on [**12-16**] revealed a communication between Hartmann's pouch and the peritoneal cavity with an abdominal fluid collection.
From an infectious disease standpoint four out of four blood culture bottles from [**12-5**] and [**12-6**] grew coag negative staphylococcus, which has been treated with Vancomycin.
Surveillance cultures from [**12-28**] revealed no growth to date.
As mentioned previously, the patient had a sputum on [**12-18**], which grew MRSA.
Blood cultures from [**12-18**] subsequently grew [**Female First Name (un) **] [**Female First Name (un) 29361**], and the patient completed a fourteen day course of Fluconazole on [**1-4**].
Lastly, sputum from [**1-4**] grew Pseudomonas.
The patient had an echocardiogram on [**12-19**], which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% and unremarkable chamber sizes and thicknesses.
The patient reportedly had a cardiac catheterization at the outside hospital with a 30% left anterior descending coronary artery and a 50% right coronary artery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a temperature of 99.9.
Her blood pressure was 129/34.
Heart rate 78.
Respiratory rate 30.
Neck examination she had a jugulovenous pressure of approximately 8 cm of water.
Cardiovascular examination regular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen examination the patient had positive bowel sounds.
She had 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  The patient had a white blood cell count of 11.6, hematocrit 32.2, platelet count 376, sodium 137, potassium 4.8, chloride 88, CO2 41, BUN 15, creatinine 0.4, calcium 9.1, mag 1.8, phosphate 4.3.
Studies, the patient had a chest x-ray on [**1-6**], which revealed interval improvement in upper zone redistribution with a small left pleural effusion and residual left lower lobe collapse with a questionable consolidation in the retrocardiac region thought to be secondary to atelectasis.
She had a CT of the abdomen on [**12-25**], which revealed a collection of fluid and air within the abdomen consistent with an abdominal abscess.
She had a CT of the adomen on [**12-16**], which revealed a collection of fluid and air within the abdomen with no identifiable Hartmann's pouch.
She had a TTE on [**12-19**].
She was found to have an ejection fraction of 60%.
Her left ventricular thickness and cavity size were normal.
Her right ventricular thickness and size were normal.
Microbiologic data, sputum culture from [**1-4**] grew Pseudomanas.
Blood cultures on [**12-28**] no growth times two sets.
Her oxygen saturations improved dramatically to the point that she required 3 to 4 liters by nasal cannula to maintain appropriate oxygen saturation.
We followed her blood cultures carefully and there was no additional growth to date on her surveillance cultures.
Her white blood cell count and fever curve remained within normal limits.
Her abdominal examination remained benign.
During her stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was felt to have a diastolic dysfunction, but was noted to be very fluid sensitive and responsive to Lasix.
