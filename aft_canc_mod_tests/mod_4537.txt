She went to OSH where BP 127/75 HR 84 and she was neurologically intact.
A CTA head/neck was performed and showed occlusion of R vertebral, mild stenosis of mid basilar artery and short segment stenosis P2 segment of L PCA.
A brain MRI revealed bilateral cerebellar stroke and small punctate cortical infarcts R and L occipital lobes.
Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
She also had an NSTEMI with a peak trop of 0.22 [**2126-11-25**] most likely in the setting of demand ischemia.
She also developed BRBPR during this hospitalization, and was taken to colonoscopy on [**2126-12-3**] which showed a colonic mass which was sent for biopsy.

From OSH: CTA head/neck was performed and showed occlusion of R vertebral, mild stenosis of mid basilar artery and short segment stenosis P2 segment of L PCA.
A brain MRI revealed bilateral cerebellar stroke and small punctate cortical infarcts R and L occipital lobes .
CT head [**2126-11-26**]: IMPRESSION: Areas of hypodensity within the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally corresponding to area of acute infarct seen on the outside hospital MRI with mass effect on the 4th ventricle.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
CT head [**11-28**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2126-12-4**] Diagnostic cath: 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial  systolic hypertension SBP=152 mmHg.
[**2126-12-4**] Echo with bubble study: Focused study.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
CTA at OSH revealed occlusion of R vertebral, mild stenosis of mid basilar artery and short segment stenosis P2 segment of L PCA.
When she arrived at [**Hospital1 18**], her examination was notable for loss of color vision in right peripheral field, nystagmus in bilateral gaze, mild dysmetria bilaterally in UEs and L > R impaired coordination in LEs with a mild R NLF flattening.
She was noted to have progression of edema and infarcts on repeat CT and thus heparin was discontinued.
BP was maintained at goal with IV hydralazine to 120-140 mm Hg SBP.
ECHO did not show a source of a thrombus, but did show extensive hypokinesis in the  mid to distal anterior septum, the distal anterior wall, apex, and distal inferior wall without an overt evidence of an embolism.
A bubble study did not show a PFO.
Repeat CT scans showed increased edema and mild tonsilar hernation.
Pain was typical for unstable angina (SOB, diaphoresis, pressure like) and resolved upon receiving morphine at OSH.
Initial EKG showed mild Tw flattening, however it progressed to TwI in II, aVF, and V1-6 by time of admission to Neuro ICU.
ECHO showed findings as above including EF of 45%.
For risk stratification after her troponin leak,  she underwent cardiac catheterization which showed 20% mid-LAD stenosis and 80% D2 stenosis.
She then had a staging CT for the colonic mass noted below, which showed subsegmental PEs bilaterally.
Subsequent LENIs showed right posterior tibial DVT.
Her O2 sats were stable at 95-99% on 2L NC prior to transfer to the surgery service on [**2126-12-6**].
However, she then developed hematochezia with a hematocrit drop from 37 to 31.
GI was consulted and performed a colonoscopy showing a fungating colonic mass.
She had a staging CT as above which showed the PEs but no metastases.
A CEA was 1.9.
Blood pressure and heart rate well controlled.
Out-patient follow up: The CT done for staging purposes showed a heterogeneous thyroid for which she will need an ultrasound as an outpatient.
It also showed an infrarenal 3.5 cm AAA for which she will need an ultrasound every 3 years.

Deep vein thrombosis, right 9.
Prior to this, you underwent cardiac evaluation with coronary angiogram, which showed no significant coronary disease.
NEW MEDICATIONS/MEDICATION CHANGES: -aspirin (decrease to 81mg daily once INR therapeutic) -coumadin (titrate dose according to daily INR, goal= [**2-12**]) -toprol xl (extended release metoprolol) -simvastatin .
