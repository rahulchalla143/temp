CT angio [**3-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1) No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.
CT head [**3-15**] (noncontrast): IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
EEG [**3-16**]: IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
Neurology was consulted early, and a tensilon test could not rule out myasthenia crisis.
In addition, BAL on [**3-3**] eventually revealed RSV, which was consistent with the tree-in-[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 239**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 55713**] picture on chest CT.
Further, due to his neutropenia, pt was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics (cefepime as febrile/neutropenic, doxycycline for atypicals, and vanco for possibility of MRSA)for his presumed multifocal pneumonia.
A head CT did not reveal any acute intracranial process.
An EEG showed changes consistent with encephalopathy, thought to be due to metabolic causes.
An LP was eventually performed to rule out a meningitis, which was negative.
There was no clear etiology; pt's EKG was consistent with sinus tachycardia.
4.  anemia - Pt's baseline Hct was around 28-30.
However, his Hct dropped to 22-24 during the first few days of hospitalization.
He was transfused and his Hct responded appropriately.
Hemolysis and DIC labs were negative.
A reticulocyte count was 1.8%, which pointed to an underproduction/bone [**Last Name 15482**] problem.
He was continued on his pyridostigmine, which was initially increased to 80mg po tid.
While pt was receiving IVIG and his secretions were increased, this was lowered to 40mg po tid, and then uptitrated to 60mg po tid with resolution of these symptoms, after the IVIG was completed.
Blood cultures were repeatedly negative, with the exception of a myco/lytic blood culture bottle ([**12-27**] blood cultures from that day, [**3-11**]) grew Enterococcus faecium, which was sensitive to vancomycin.
Pt's sputum cultures did not grow any bacteria; however, repeated nasopharyngeal aspirates were positive for RSV antigen and he was treated with ribavirin and palivizumab x 2.
Urine cultures were repeatedly negative.
Pt's nasopharyngeal aspirates grew HSV-1 on viral culture, but this was not thought to be a pathogenic source.
CLL - pt is s/p recent CEPP chemotherapy, the last dose being on [**2-28**].
