HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 38-year-old male with a past medical history of hepatocellular carcinoma status post resection one year ago, inferior vena cava thrombosis secondary to his carcinoma who was initially admitted to the Orthopedic Service of [**Hospital1 69**] for surgical evaluation of his T10 lytic lesion and mild to moderate cord compression.
He had no other symptoms such as bowel or bladder dysfunction or diarrhea and incidentally was found to have a T10 lytic lesion on the CT scan done to evaluate his abdominal pain.
The patient then spent some time in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on clindamycin postoperatively and had an MRI guided embolization procedure of the T10 intercostal artery to attempt a reduction in blood loss for future planned surgeries and spinal stabilization.
He was then transferred to the Medicine Service for evaluation and management of his diarrhea.
Pleural biopsy showing granulomatous disease but no metastatic disease of the pleura or lungs.
Hepatic adenoma resected ten years ago which was incidentally found on CT scan after a motor vehicle accident.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER:  Temperature 99.1, blood pressure 120-170/75-100, pulse 56-78, 96% on room air.
Lungs clear to auscultation anterolaterally bilaterally.
DATA ON TRANSFER:  White blood count 9.7, hematocrit 28.5, platelets 96.
Differential of 85% polys, 1% basophils, 5% lymphs, 7% monocytes, 1 atyp, 2 meta, 1 myelo.
PT 13.3, PTT 27.6, INR 1.2.
Sodium 139, potassium 3.6, chloride 103, bicarb 29, BUN 26, creatinine 0.9, glucose 116, ALT 17, AST 15, total bilirubin 0.8, alkaline phosphatase 46, albumin 3.2, calcium 8.6, magnesium 1.5, phosphorus 2.4.
RADIOLOGY:  MRI of the spine done [**2186-2-23**]:  There is a lesion within the posterior portion of the vertebral body at T10 with epidural tumor causing mild to moderate cord compression with evidence of abnormal signal intensity in the spinal cord at this level.
Chest x-ray on [**2186-3-3**] showed low lung volumes but no obvious congestive heart failure.
CT of the abdomen done [**2-10**] showed no evidence of recurrent hepatoma and stable right pleural-based nodules with no _______ of subcutaneous varices and a thrombosed infrarenal IVC.
His white count jumped from 8 to 23 during the time his diarrhea came on.
Because of his white count in the setting of clindamycin, Clostridium difficile was suspected as the etiology of his profuse watery diarrhea, which obtained levels of three liters per day.
Four Clostridium difficile tox samples were negative during this hospitalization.
The patient, however, was still maintained on Flagyl 500 IV t.i.d.
therapy as he was not taking p.o.
The patient had a rectal tube placed for decompression and close monitoring of his diarrhea volume as well as an NG tube placed to decompress his concomitant ileus.
Stool electrolytes were obtained which showed that the patient had a stool osmolar gap of less than 50 consistent with a secretory diarrhea which could be secondary to Clostridium difficile or perineoplastic syndrome from his hepatocellular carcinoma.
His diarrhea did show improvement after this slowing to two liters, then 500 cc and then to preceding days.
as Clostridium difficile is still a possibility in this clinical scenario despite the negative toxin.
His abdomen was distended and he had dilated loops of both small and large bowel on KUB and abdominal CT scan.
There was no evidence for bowel obstruction or colitis on these studies and no free air.
As his NG tube output diminished from over one liter a day to about 300 cc per day the NG tube was discontinued on [**3-16**].
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  Because of his large secretory diarrhea, Mr. [**Known lastname 41220**] has had large potassium and magnesium losses in his stool.
His stool studies showed 95 mEq of potassium.
He, therefore, was on large volume potassium, magnesium, calcium and phosphorus repletion while his diarrhea continued.
After a large workup by the Interventional Pulmonary Service at that time, it was found that the patient did not have evidence of metastatic or neoplastic disease, however, his effusions were exudative and pleural biopsies showed granulomatous disease of the pleura.
As Mr. [**Known lastname 41220**] becomes more stable it may be feasible to obtain a bone scan in the future.
Panniculitis:  This was seen incidentally on his CT scan of his right superficial abdominal wall.
His follow-up urine studies are negative for UA at this time.
Hematologic:  Mr. [**Known lastname 41220**] had large volume blood loss of 20 units during his initial surgeries and had transfusions of fresh frozen plasma and platelets as well.
