CT head revealed no hemorrhage and biopsy was consistent with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
A head CT was performed which was stable.
An EEG which showed generalized slowing, but no seizure activity.
Her levetiracetam was increased plus an additional bolus.
On [**2175-1-30**], EEG revealed persistent eliptiform waves.
Oxygen saturation was 88-91%, so she was started on face tent O2.
CXR revealed white out of the right lung, so she was started on levofloxacin.
Cytology from the pleural fluid were negative for malignancy.
Due to continued R sided weakness a Head CT was ordered which was negative.
She developed a fever to 100.5F on [**2175-2-2**] and was cultured, CXR showed re-accumulating effusion, but she remained well oxygenated.
CT head and MRI/MRA brain non-diagnostic.
EEG [**2175-2-6**] showed diffuse slowing, but no seizure.
LP [**2175-2-4**] and [**2175-2-7**] under fluoroscopic guidance did not confirm infection.
After blood, urine and CSF cultures were sent, she was started empirically on ceftazadime and vancomycin.
Vancomycin was changed to daptomycin for a positive urine culture growing vancomycin resistant enterococcus ([**Month/Day/Year **]).
Paracentesis performed [**2175-2-8**] also negative for infection.
EEG on [**2175-2-9**] also showed diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy without seizures.
TPN, fluids, anticoagulation, and IV meds stopped.
Head CT stable, MRI/MRA brain negative.
EEG [**2175-2-6**] showed diffuse slowing, but no seizure.
- F/U EEG final reads.
Diagnostic pleurocentesis [**2175-2-4**] negative for infection.
Urine osm consistent with hypovolemia.
# Seizures: EEG [**2175-2-6**] diffusely slowed, but no seizure activity.
EEG [**2175-2-9**] also slowed, but seizure propensity present.
Valproate level was supratherapeutic [**2175-2-6**], decreased dose frm 750mg [**Hospital1 **] --> 500mg [**Hospital1 **], but level [**2175-2-8**] is subtherapeutic --> increased back to 750 [**Hospital1 **].
Levetiracetam stopped as possible cause of encephalopathy.
# Anemia: Microcytosis, hypochromia, ferritin 38, retic 0.8, Fe sat 13%, haptoglobin 45, consistent with iron-deficiency anemia.
# RLE DVT: She is at high risk for bleeding given her recent brain bx and GI bleed (EGD & colonoscopy negative at [**Hospital1 112**]).
SENNOSIDES 17.2 daily except day of and day after chemo 15.
Lorazepam Intensol 2 mg/mL Concentrate Sig: 0.5-1.0 mg PO q4HR PRN Seizure, nausea, anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 24302**] Healthcare  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (pancreatic cancer) Brain fetastasis (cancer spread to the brain) Pleural effusion (fluid in your lung) Ascites (fluid in your abdomen) Seizures Urinary tract infection (bladder infection) Encephalopathy (loss of conciousness, altered mental status) DVT of right lower extremity (blood clot) Hypernatremia (high sodium) Diabetes (high sugar) Hypercalcemia (high calcium) Thrush (yeast infection of the mouth) Bipolar disorder Anemia (low red blood cells) Thrombocytopenia (low platelets) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (abnormal blood clotting)  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Unresponsive.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a brain biopsy which showed you have metastatic pancreatic cancer to the brain.
High calcium was treated with medications (calcitonin and pamidronate), high blood sugars treated with insulin, and high sodium treated with IV fluids.
You developed a blood clot in your right leg that has been treated with IV heparin, a blood thinner, but this was stopped early when you left the hospital considering no improvement in your overall condition.
Blood clotting labs have been abnormal and platelets low, but these did not require treatment.
You have also been anemic (low red blood cell count).
