A V/Q of her chest was ordered to rule out PE, but the patient was unable to lie flat and complete the exam so it was aborted.
Her BP improved to SBPs in the 90s, then 100s with IVFs and remained stable.
Initially she had negative LENIs and a CT was deferred because of ARF.
A V/Q scan was performed on [**2179-3-10**], but she was unable to lie flat for the test and the test could not be completed.
# Hyponatremia/Acute renal failure: Based on exam and history, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.
She did have a CT head in the ED that showed no intracranial lesions to explain this.
Her ARF also improved with IVFs and her urine output remained brisk throughout her hospitalization.
Family meeting regarding poor prognosis and goals of care; patient not to have further chemotherapy or interventions/invasive procedures.
