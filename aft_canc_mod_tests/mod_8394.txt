She was seen by her VNA who performed a rectal exam 4 days ago and found her to have guaiac positive stools which may have been a false positive due to iron supplementation.
In the ER her initial VS were T 97.4 F, BP 146/67 mmHg, HR 60 BPM, RR 18 X', SpO2 100% on RA with pain 0/10.
Her BP was table thoughout the ED stay with SBP ranging from 120-150 with HR in 60s (on metoprolol).
Her CXR showed opacity in the LLL that could be compatible with atelectases or PNA, so patient received Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin.
She had an 18-G placed in the antecubital fosa, but Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] expressed patient had "2 large IVs".
ECG showed sinus bradycardia without signs of ishcemia.

GI BLEEDING STUDY (TAGGED RBC SCAN) [**2127-4-5**]: IMPRESSION: Evidence of very slow but steady GI bleed likely at the sigmoid colon.
ANGIOGRAPHY [**2127-4-5**]: FINDINGS: 1.
Angiography of the SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] demonstrated no evidence of active contrast extravasation to localize the source of gastrointestinal bleeding.
FLEXIBLE SIGMOIDOSCOPY [**2127-4-7**]: Impression: - Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids - Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon - Polyp at 70cm in the splenic flexure (polypectomy) - Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to proximal transverse colon  Brief Hospital Course: 88 year-old woman presents with maroon-colored stool with blood clots.
Tagged RBC scan showed that the bleed was from a sigmoid vessel.
HCT remained stable after last transfusion on [**2127-4-5**].
Angiography was performed to try to intervene on the bleeding vessel after it was identified on the Tagged RBC Scan, but no further bleeding was found.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy on [**2127-4-7**] found no active bleed, but did find Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids and diverticular disease.
With the known GI bleed being in the sigmoid colon and the hematocrit being stable, the black stool is attributed to iron supplementation rather than upper GI bleed.
Iron studies this admission were normal.
No BP or blood draws in R arm.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Newbridge on the [**Doctor Last Name **] - [**Location (un) 1411**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSES: - Lower gastrointestinal bleeding from hemorrhoids or diverticulosis - Hemorrhoids, Grade 1 - Diverticulosis - Anemia from blood loss  SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: - Alzheimer's disease - Hypertension - Hypercholesterolemia - History of breast cancer  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Always Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation and management of rectal bleeding.
Your hematocrit remained stable for the last 3 days of hospital admission.
A flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed on [**2127-4-7**] that revealed hemorrhoids, diverticulosis, and a small polyp which was removed.
You were previously iron deficient, but our tests show that your iron is now normal.
