His wife looked in his throat and saw minimal "redness," and offered the patient some ice cream and water with minimal relief.
In [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], patient initially had stable vital signs, and underwent CT scan.
Seizure x1 in [**2132**], on chronic depakote and seizure-free since this time 3. s/p cholecystectomy 4. s/p AAA s/p aortobifemoral stenting  Social History: Lives with wife and daughter.
CT neck [**2143-8-1**] 1.Interval development of a large medium-density fluid collection with an enhancing rim in the location of the patient's prior neck mass.
As the patient is status post biopsy of this mass, these findings are concerning for nfection.
5.Reviewing the current examination and the prior CT, the findings are entirely compatible with a hematoma.
CT neck [**2143-8-14**] Significant interval decrease in size of left parapharyngeal mass which shows peripheral enhancement and a central area of low attenuation.
A US-doppler and arteriogram of the carotids fail to demonstrate any vascular lesion in the mass area.
In the absence of a vascular lesion, a repeat CT of the neck on [**2143-8-14**] shows reduction in size of the peripharyngeal mass and a second biopsy under direct laryngoscopy is performed on [**2143-8-16**].
Frozen sections reveal the presence of normal oropharyngeal tissue with acute and chronic inflammation and culture of an adjacent pus-like throat swab is positive for oropharyngeal flora.
On [**2143-8-19**], a video swallow shows persistence of a moderate-severe dysphagia.
A repeat swallow video is performed on [**2143-8-29**] showing post swallow residues in phrayngeal area resulting in aspiration (see attached report) and the patient is discharged rehabilitation on the same day.
Significant medical events during his hospitalization include:  Respiratory - Lung opacity on initial CXR is consistent with pneumonitis from aspiration of blood during procedure and intubation.
During the course of his hospitalization, repeat CXR reveal the development of bilaterl pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis but without showing any consolidation or opacification suggestive of pneumonia.
Post-incidental ECG and cardiac enzymes (3 sets) revealed no abnormality.
Peripheral IV site: on [**2143-8-6**], patient develops phlebitis and cellulitis at IV puncture site on his right arm; catheter is removed, blood cultures are sent (neg.)
However, his peripheral smear and differential was not normal even prior to his hospitalization and it is recommended to check a CBC again 1 month after his discharge and f/u with a hematologist.
