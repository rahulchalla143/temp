[**2166-12-17**] Peritoneal fluid: Albumin was 1.8, LDH was [**Telephone/Fax (1) 43426**] nucleated cells of which on preliminary analysis many appeared malignant.
[**2166-12-19**] Cell block, peritoneal fluid: Mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes and red blood cells.
[**2166-12-26**] Bone Marrow: Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
The white blood cell count appears normal.
Differential count shows 69% neutrophils, 5% monocytes, 2%lymphocytes, 1% basophils, 3% atypical mononuclear cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles within deep blue cytoplasm.
Differential shows: 3% Blasts, 1% Promyelocytes, 12% Myelocytes, 14% Metamyelocytes, 14% Bands/Neutrophils, 13% Plasma cells, 16% Lymphocytes, 35% Erythroid.
Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and demonstrates a fragmented cellular core (overall cellularity of 20-30%).
Special Stains: Iron stain is adequate for evaluation.
EKG: sinus rhythm, HR 80, normal axis, normal intervals, non pathologic q-waves in II, III, aVF.
RADIOGRAPHIC DATA: CXR [**2166-12-22**]: There is some hyperexpansion of the lungs with coarseness of interstitial markings consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.
Apical pleural thickening bilaterally, more prominent on the right, consistent with old granulomatous disease.
CT CHEST [**2166-12-19**]: 1.
ABDOMINAL ASCITES, WHICH WAS BETTER ASSESSED ON THE [**2166-12-16**] ABDOMINAL CT SCAN.
HOWEVER, A METASTASIS CANNOT ENTIRELY BE EXCLUDED, AND A BONE SCAN [**Month (only) **] BE CONSIDERED.
[**2166-12-16**] CT ABDOMEN ([**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]): ASCITES.
Compared with the report of the resting portion of the prior stress study (images unavailable for review) of [**2163-9-9**], tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension are now seen.
[**2167-1-2**] LE Ultrasound: The examination was negative for DVT in the lower extremities.
[**2167-1-12**] Chest CT: 1.
[**2167-1-25**] Chest CT: 1.
As seen in the chest CT from the prior day there is right apical pleural plaque and increased interstitial markings on the right.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname **] is a 78-year-old female transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with CT findings of ascites, omental thickening, and left adnexal fullness, as well as an elevated CA-125, concerning for ovarian cancer versus primary peritoneal cancer, found to have Burkitt's lymphoma as well as likely peritoneal TB.
Patient underwent CT guided mesenteric biopsy which demonstrated high proliferation fraction and lack of Bcl-2 expression consistent with Burkitt's Lymphoma.
Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated MILDLY HYPOCELLULAR ERYTHROID DOMINANT BONE MARROW WITH MATURING TRILINEAGE HEMATOPOIESIS AND REACTIVE (POLYCLONAL) PLAMACYTOSIS, but did not show evidence of lymphoma.
Bone marrow acid-fast stain was negative for microorganisms.
MRI demonstrated no discrete lymphadenopathy and findings consistent with anasarca.
# Hypoxia: Initially, on the floor the patient required NRB for O2 sat 90-94%.
EKG showed no acute changes.
CT chest was performed showing diffuse ground glass opacities.
Sputum culture grew stenothrophomonas.
Pt underwent a broncoscopy on [**1-26**] for evaluation of persistant ground glass opacities.
# Peritoneal TB: The patient had a history of active TB (demonstrated on CT chest) without adequate treatment.
She ruled out for pulmonary TB with > 4 sputum samples negative for AFB.
The infectious disease service was concerned for peritoneal TB due to + [**Doctor First Name **] peritoneal fluid ([**Doctor First Name **] of 96.7 with a reference range of <7.6 U/L) despite negative TB PCR.
The following are new medications: Omeprazole: for heartburn Senna: as needed for constipation Pyridoxine: to take with tuberculosis medications Isoniazid:  tuberculosis medication Ethambutol: tuberculosis medication Pyrazinamide: tuberculosis medication Docusate Sodium: for constipation Fluconazole: to prevent fungal infection Rifabutin: tuberculosis medication Metoprolol Tartrate: for blood pressure Acetaminophen: for pain Lamivudine: to prevent infection Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole: to prevent infection Acyclovir: to prevent infection Hydromorphone: as needed for pain Lorazepam: as needed for nausea .
