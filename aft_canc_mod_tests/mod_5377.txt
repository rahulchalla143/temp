COMPARISON: Comparison is made with the prior study of [**2138-1-24**].
SCAN FINDINGS: As on the previous examination there is a large enhancing mass in the right frontal region with a central area of low signal in the anteromedial frontal lobe.
Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2138-1-30**] 9:51 PM COMPARISON: CT head [**2137-7-19**] and MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2138-1-30**].
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast axial images of the head are obtained with 5-mm section thickness.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: The patient is status post repeat right frontal craniotomy and resection with a large focus of pneumocephalus and a small amount of hemorrhage in the resection bed.
Radiology Report MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2138-1-31**] 8:25 AM Final Report INDICATION: 50-year-old male patient, with right frontal mass, status post resection, to evaluate for residual tumor, baseline postop.
COMPARISON: MR of the head done on [**2138-1-24**] and [**2138-1-30**].
This can relate to blood products or acute infarction in this location.
Enhancing areas, noted in the posterior and inferior aspects of the surgical resection cavity in the right frontal lobe, likely represent residual tumor.
Followup evaluation, to assess interval change/progression.
His MRI was completed and appeared to have a gross total resection.
