At [**Location (un) **] he was noted to have sats in the low 80's.
There CXR showed right sided pleural effusion(concerning for an empyema).
He was started on azithromycin, ceftriaxone, 125mg solumedrol and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

The multifocal infiltrates in the right mid and lower lung fields appear to have become more confluent superiorly.
[**2-25**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION: 1.
Three-month CT followup is recommended.
When the patient's condition improves, if he is able to breath hold, a contrast enhanced MRI is recommended.
If he cannot breath hold, multiphase CT is recommended.
Recommend CT of the abdomen for metastatic work-up, or hepatic MRI if there is clinical concern for a primary hepatocellular carcinoma.
[**3-1**] ECHO: EF 75-80% Conclusions: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular  systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**3-19**] CT Abd/Pelvis IMPRESSION: 1.
CT imaging characteristics are not specific but differential includes hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic adenoma or even a solitary metastasis.
Further charactherization of this mass is recommended with MRI.
[**2158-4-6**] CT Torso: 1.
This could suggest an obstructive process near the ampulla, and although no stone or clot is directly observed there, the presence of a stone or blood clot would often not be observable on CT. 4.

However, Hct acutely dropped from 25.5 on [**3-27**] to 19.1 on [**3-29**]; EGD, [**Last Name (un) **], CT torso all negative for source of bleeding and Hct responded appropriately to 2units PRBCs and remained stable at 26-27.
CT abd/pelvis did not reveal any bleeding around PEG site.
Continue MVI, thiamine, folate, B12 .
# Adenocarcinoma: Per pathology prelim read, biopsy specimen c/w adenocarcinoma (not hepatocellular), unlikely lung or colon based on immunohistochemical staining so most likely cholangiocarcinoma.
CEA <1; AFP 8.8 (0-8.7, ref range); CA19-9 26 (0-37, ref range).
