Imaging: MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-10-28**] 9:43 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Very limited study due to motion artifact.
A complete diagnostic examination was not performed.
CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-10-29**] 12:57 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Lack of mass effect and edema is more suggestive of a cavernoma than a metastasis, but an MRI is recommended in order to evaluate further and to better characterize the lesion.
ECHO Study Date of [**2183-10-30**] Conclusions: 1.
MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-10-31**] 3:21 PM IMPRESSION: Small focus of chronic blood products and enhancement in the left subinsular region adjacent to the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle as described above.
The MRI appearances and the presence of developmental venous anomaly in the adjacent brain favor cavernous malformation as suggested on the previous CT.
However, if further assessment is clinically indicated, the perfusion MRI with arterial spin labeling may help for differentiation MRA OF THE HEAD: The head MRA is limited by motion.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2183-10-31**] 10:38 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-11-1**] 12:13 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-11-1**] 12:12 PM IMPRESSION: Allowing for differences in technique compared to the prior MR, similar appearance of compression fracture of L1 with associated enhancing soft tissue mass.
CT L-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-11-1**] 12:12 PM IMPRESSION: Allowing for differences in technique compared to the prior MR, similar appearance of compression fracture of L1 with associated enhancing soft tissue mass.
MRA LUMBAR SPINE  [**2183-11-3**] 10:37 AM IMPRESSION: Anterior spinal artery is not definitively visualized.
Hct was followed and she did need transfusion post op.
Patient's neuro exam has improved slightly while on steroids.
Finding on CT head from [**2183-10-29**] is likely an old finding.
