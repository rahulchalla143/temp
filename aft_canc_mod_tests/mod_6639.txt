After the operation, he developed a new oxygen requirement and was on 4L NC for the past 2 days until he was found to have a HR of 140s on tele on [**2173-7-25**] at 1830 and an O2 sat of 71% on 4L NC.
He was given 40mg IV lasix and 5mg IV lopressor, which was repeated when heart rates did not decrease with another 5mg IV lopressor.
He diuresed 1 L of urine and his oxygen saturations increased to 100% on the non-rebreather.
On arrival to the MICU, O2 sats are 100% on non-rebreather and patient has a new fever of 101.2.
After this surgery on post-po day 1 he suffered a long-standing post-op seizure tonic clonic and found on imaging a R+ MCA CVA.

Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for decalcification as follows:  A= representative sections of femoral head, B = representative sections of femoral neck.
Compared to tracing #1 the heart rate is decreased but there are no other significant changes.
TRACING #2  Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 56 0 132 468/461 0 -57 85  [**7-23**] Hip Xray: FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the pelvis and three views of the left hip were obtained.
[**7-23**] CXR: FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest compared to previous exam from [**2172-3-20**].
[**7-25**] Knee xray No prior studies for comparison.
No acute fracture or dislocation identified, but CT of the cervical spine is much more sensitive than conventional radiographs for detecting traumatic abnormalities and would be suggested if there is persistent clinical suspicion for a cervical spine injury.
AP CXR on [**7-25**] IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**7-23**]:  Lungs are appreciably smaller and there is greater but symmetric opacification in the lower lungs.
Subsequent chest CT reported separately has findings of left lower lobe atelectasis, right lower lobe pneumonia and multifocal small regions of peribronchial opacification, probably bronchopneumonia.
Though this study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, imaged upper abdomen reveals distended stomach.
The pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified without filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolism, though evaluation of the subsegmental vessels is limited due to respiratory motion.
Echo [**7-26**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
AP CXR [**7-26**] FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial increase in extent and severity of the pre-existing multifocal pneumonia.
ECG [**7-28**] Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2173-7-23**] the heart rate has increased, ST-T wave abnormalities have improved.

AP CXR [**7-30**] FINDINGS:  A new left PICC terminates approximately 1 cm beyond the cavoatrial junction.
There is a persistent retrocardiac opacity as well as worsening consolidation of the left upper lobe when compared to the prior study from yesterday.
AP CXR [**7-31**] CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW  The patient is status post sternotomy.
Additional scattered regions of ground-glass opacification are also seen scattered within the lungs, for example, on series 2, image 35, suggestive of edema.
Minimal quantity of perihepatic and pelvic fluid, which could be related to third spacing.
CXR [**8-4**] INDICATION:  Pneumonia, questionable ET tube placement.
Pt was evaluated for a PE; CTA showed no evidence of PE, but did show a multifocal PNA.
Blood, urine, and sputum cultures did not grow out any organism.
His tachypnea increased, and he became hypoxic on BiPAP and required intubation on [**2173-7-31**].
Cultures from bronchoscopy following intubation were unremarkable, and visual inspection of the airways did not demonstate purulence.
Further imaging with chest CT showed large bilateral pulmonary effusions, multifocal PNA, and pulmonary edema.
Troponins were sent and were negative.
He required norepinephrine drip, but this was discontinued in the MICU when his BP improved with MAPs in the 70s.
He was normotensive on transfer to the floor and his Metoprolol was held with his SBP in the ~90s.
# Dropping HCT: HCT dropped from 28 on [**7-30**] to 22 on [**8-2**] without a source of bleeding.
From that point, his HCT has been increasing.
This was initially held, but was restarted on [**8-6**] The patient's Foley was removed on [**8-7**] and he maintained urine output on discontinuation of the Foley.
# The patient's metoprolol 25mg tid was consolidated to metoprolol succinate 75 once a day, but his SBP has been in the high 90s towards the end of his hospital stay, so antihypertensives had been held.

We also treated you with oxygen, antibiotics for the pneumonia and diuretic medications, which remove fluid from your body.
Please note the following changes in your medications: You should START Fondaparinux to prevent blood clots, as managed by your orthopedic surgeon.
