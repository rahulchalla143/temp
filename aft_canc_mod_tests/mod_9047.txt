CT studies of the abdomen were unremarkable for an infectious source.
Blood, urine cultures were negative while patient was in the MICU.
Stool cultures were  also negative.
Urine legionella was negative.
Her course was also notable for a fluid overload state given evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR and exam, requiring agressive diuresis with lasix gtt and IV chlorothiazide.
After her diarrhea, fever, ARF and metabolic acidosis improved, she was transferred to medicine floor for further care with a 5.5 L oxygen requirement.
Blood  cultures from [**2125-7-6**] subsequently grew [**1-24**] Coag negative staph (sensitivities pending) from the central line site.
Surveillance cultures remained negative, patient remained stable without a fever or white count.
The positive cultures may be [**2-22**] contamination, but it is unclear.
Her urine on [**2125-7-6**] also grew out <10,000 Enterococcus senstive to IV vanc but resistant to tetracycline.
Given her CRI, she was dosed 750 mg/qd and have levels checked in [**1-22**] days to ensure therapeutic levels - done for 5 days as above, and no evidence UTI on d/c.
Her initial fever on presentation was attributed to a GI source, give negative blood, urine, and stools cx.
ESRD s/p transplant with ARF - likely intrinsic process as FENa of 1.21% and  FeUrea = 47.8; no evidence of obstruction on U/S; creatinine stable at 4.0 - cont immunosuppressants for now - restrict phosphate and potassium intake - may require HD in the future, patient refusing currently; transplant renal followed during course - need to follow renal function carefully as pt may require HD in the near future .
She was restricted to < 1.5L/day fluid intake, 1 gram phosphate as patient was hyperphosphatemic on admission, and 2grams of potassium daily.
