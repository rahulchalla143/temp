In ED had CT chest confirming bilateral large PE and U/S of legs showing bilateral LE clots.
He had a STAT echo that showed RA and RV dilation with global RV HK and abnormal systolic septal motion.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2168-10-27**] that showed an increased plasma cell count that was 26% in the aspirate.
The plasma cells were 16% of the nucleated cells of the biopsy.
Of note, hypercoagulable workup negative (negative, [**Doctor First Name **], lupus anti-coagulant, ATIII, protein C, protein S, Factor V Leiden, PT gene mutation and anti-cardiolipin) .
DVT 2 years ago, treated with coumadin for 8 months, negative hypercaog w/u   Social History: lives with wife and daughter in [**Name (NI) 13588**] works at [**Name (NI) 1819**], director of service - TOB rare ETOH, (-) hx IVDU  Family History: mother died lung cancer at age 72 father died of CHF, had MI in 50's  Physical Exam: T: afebrile HR 94-120 155/102 18 96% 2liters comfortable, no distress HEENT: NCAT Oropharynx clear lungs: CTA B/L No wheezing or crackles heart: +s1+s2 RRR abd: Soft NTND ext: R leg chronically larger than the L ; no edema  Pertinent Results: CT-A: 1.

CT Chest/Abd Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO [**2171-2-1**]: Bubble Study Limited contrast study was performed at rest with cough and Valsalva.
# PE - Large causing compromised respiratory status and right heart strain - He was hypoxic to 85-89% with tachycardia on admission to ED.
Started on heparin with PTT goal of 60-80.
There was no indication for clot lysis at this time as patient stabilized with regard to his O2 requirements and his hemodynamic status.
- Started on heparin, maintain PTT >70 to finish 5 day overlap of heparin and coumadin - with goal INR to be therapeutic at [**3-1**].
Though was only able to achieve INR of 1.6 on day of discharge.
- Bubble study was negative .
# Hypercoagulable workup - Usually see tendency to bleed rather than tendency to clot with MM.
- Abdominal CT with contrast to look for other primary malignancy was negative - Repeat hypercoag workup: anti-cardiolipin Ab, PT mutation, Factor V Leiden, Protein C and S (may not be accurate in setting of clot)  - to be followed up by outpatient oncologist.
- consider bx of lung nodule when acute issues resolve - no prior CT in our system to compare .
# Ventriculomegaly - seen on head CT - Repeat head CT as needed  .
