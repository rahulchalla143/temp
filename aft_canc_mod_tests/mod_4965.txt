Reports: CT neck [**2147-7-28**]: IMPRESSIONS: 1.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear:  ([**2147-7-27**]) The smear is adequate for evaluation.
Erythrocytes are markedly decreased and exhibit moderate anisopoikilocytosis with rare dacrocytes and red cell fragments present.
A rare nucleated red blood cell is seen on scan.
The white blood cell count appears markedly increased.
Differential count shows 2% neutrophils, 6% lymphocytes, 92% blasts and promonocytes.
Differential (300 cells) shows:  94% blasts and promonocytes, 3% bands/neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, 3% erythroid.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation.
Special Stains: Iron stain is adequate of evaluation.
[**2147-7-28**]: FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING The following tests (antibodies) were performed: CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD19, CD20, CD33, CD34, CD41, CD11c, CD56, CD64, HLA-DR, Kappa, Lambda, CD71, Glyc A, CD45, CD117.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this bone marrow express immature antigens CD34, HLA-DR, myeloid associated antigens CD33, CD15, CD117, CD11c, CD64, CD56, CD71, lymphoid associated antigen CD7, are CD10 (cALLa) negative, and are negative for CD5, CD19, CD20, CD3, CD13, CD14, CD41, Glycophorin A.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
Rare ovalocytes and red cell fragments are seen on scan.
The white blood cell count appears markedly decreased.
Differential count shows 0% neutrophils, 0% bands, 0% monocytes, 100% lymphocytes, 0% eosinophils, 0% basophils.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and is markedly hypocellular.
A limited 100 cell differential shows 90% lymphocytes, 8% plasma cells, and 2% immature erythroid precursors.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
The white blood cell count appears markedly decreased.
Limited 50 cell differential count shows 7% monocytes, 90% lymphocytes, 0% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 3% others including 2% nucleated red cells, 1% blast.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation.
Erythroid precursors are relatively increased and exhibit normoblastic maturation.
Scattered marrow stromal cells and hematopoietic precursors are seen, however, the morphology is suboptimal to evaluate due to preparation artifacts.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2147-8-21**] at 9:40:59 AM Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 33 year old male with no significant past medical history who presented from an OSH with enlarged tonsils and CBC with white count of 79.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2147-7-27**] established a new diagnosis of AML, monocytic type.
A BMB was done on [**2147-7-27**], demonstrating AML, likely monocytic type.
He was started on Hydrea and hydration on the evening of [**2147-7-27**], which brought his white count down.
CT of the neck that afternoon showed interval enlargement of a left tonsillar phlegmonous collection to 4.3 x 6.2 x 6.4 cm with ongoing severe airway narrowing, and he was returned to the ICU for airway monitoring.
His 7+3 induction was complicated by DIC, and his labs were trended for several days.
He finished his 7+3 induction, and repeat bone marrow biopsy on day 14 showed a markedly hypocellular bone marrow consistent with chemotherapy induced ablation and no features of involvement by acute leukemia.
He required several platelet transfusions and PRBC transfusions throughout this time due to his pancytopenia.
By Day 21, his CBC continued to show pancytopenia, with nucleated RBCs on peripheral smear and a slight increase in platelet count from baseline.
Concern for returning leukemia prompted a day 21 ([**2147-8-17**]) bone marrow biopsy which showed hypercellular marrow with maturing erythroid-dominant trilineage hematopoiesis and 5% blasts highlighted by CD34.
His CBC began to improve over the next few days, with his ANC rapidly starting to normal after [**2147-8-21**].
He was discharged on [**2147-8-25**] with normal platelets, steadily increasing Hct, and granulocyte count 1245. .
He was scheduled for DIC labs Q4H.
By [**8-1**], he had recovered and DIC labs were stopped.
CT neck demonstrated a 6 mm mass concerning for abscess.
The antibiotics were discontinued as his white count recovered.
The most recent biopsy showed a good response to the treatment and regeneration of the normal bone marrow cells.
At the time of discharge, your blood counts were quickly returning back to their normal range.
