In the Emergency [**Hospital1 **], he was noted to be tachycardic and found to have a hematocrit of 14.8.
Serum toxicology was negative, but a urine toxicology was positive for cocaine.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 15501**] [**Name (STitle) 48530**], which was significant for a Grade II esophagitis in the lower [**12-9**] of the esophagus.
The patient continued on Protonix twice a day dosing and serial hematocrits were checked.
His hematocrit was increasing appropriately to transfusions and he was transferred to the Medical Floor under the [**Hospital4 **] [**Hospital5 **] [**Hospital6 **]' Service.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus:  CD4 count and viral load unknown.
; heart rate ranged from 80 to 90; blood pressure ranged between 135 to 155 systolic over 78 to 80 diastolic; respiratory rate was between 17 and 21; his oxygen saturation vary between 96 to 100% on room air; inputs and outputs were 4400 in/3858 out.
Occult blood negative after the esophagogastroduodenoscopy procedure on transfer.
LABORATORY:  On transfer, the patient's hematocrit was 21.0 at 12:30 p.m. on the day of transfer.
Platelet count was 69.
Coagulation studies demonstrated a PT of 14.0, INR of 1.3, PTT was 30.1.
Chem-7 was notable for a sodium of 142, potassium 4.7, chloride 113, bicarbonate 21, BUN 10, creatinine 1.0, glucose 122.
Hematocrit on the day of discharge was 27.4.
Platelet count on the day of discharge was 59.
PT, PTT and INR were 13.1, 28.2, and 1.1 respectively.
A T-lymphocyte subset demonstrated a absolute CD4 count of 31.
A reticulocyte count was 4.6 on [**5-2**].
Hemolysis labs were checked on the day of discharge which demonstrated an LD of 256, total bilirubin of 1.0, and haptoglobin of less than 20.
Serial cardiac enzymes were checked on [**5-2**] into [**5-3**], which demonstrated three troponin of less than 0.3 and serial CKs of 62, 50, and 52.
Albumin was 3.3 on [**5-4**].
Iron studies which were added on to the patient's admission labs demonstrated an iron of 196, calculated total iron binding capacity of 208, vitamin B12 of 292, folate of 13.5, ferritin which was pending and transferrin of 160.
A TSH was 2.0.
A rapid plasmin reagent test was checked on [**2186-5-4**], which was nonreactive.
HIV viral load checked on [**2186-5-3**], demonstrated less than 50 copies per ml.
PA and lateral chest film on [**2186-5-2**], demonstrated mild cardiomegaly, pulmonary vasculature without evidence of failure.
CT scan of the head without contrast on [**2186-5-4**], demonstrated no intra or extra axial hemorrhage, with no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
Hypo-attenuation was noted interrupted he peri-ventricular white matter which extends into the U-fibers.
IMPRESSION:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old male with Human Immunodeficiency Virus, hypertension and depression, who was noted to have a hematocrit of 15 after a suicide attempt with Dapsone, pyrimethamine, and a history concerning for gastrointestinal bleed.
[**Name2 (NI) **]L BLEED:  The patient's symptoms were consistent with an upper gastrointestinal bleed but an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was noted to be negative as above.
The findings of gastritis and esophagitis would not account for his level of blood loss.
Iron studies were added on to the patient's admission labs and were not significant for an iron deficiency anemia.
Hemolysis labs were checked and were significant for a haptoglobin of less than 20 on [**2186-5-5**], however, this was after four units of packed red blood cells.
The patient's LD and bilirubin were within normal limits.
A colonoscopy was performed on [**5-4**], which was significant for a polyp at 45 centimeters.
A polypectomy was not performed at that time based upon the patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia.
Other flat 1 to 3 centimeter verrucous appearing lesions were seen in the rectum and sigmoid, of which cold forceps biopsies were performed for Histology and the biopsy results were pending at the time of this dictation.
Recommended were a repeat colonoscopy and polypectomy when the patient's counts have stabilized.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable status post four units of packed red blood cells with  discharge hematocrit of 27.1.
The patient was also noted to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status for which he received a CT scan of his head on [**5-4**].
The CT scan was negative for any intracranial mass or bleeding.
His findings demonstrated some white matter changes, which was consistent with HIV leukoencephalopathy.
He will require an inpatient psychiatric hospitalization for further evaluation and management of his psychosis/depression.
There were no former records in the computer and a CD4 count and viral load were obtained.
The CD4 count was noted to be 31 and his viral load was less than 50 copies per ml.
The likely reason for his HIV viral load to be less than 50 copies per ml with clear CD4 lymphopenia is that the HIV he acquired in [**Country 2045**] may be of a different clade that is not tested by this laboratory.
The patient needs a follow-up colonoscopy as an outpatient once his blood counts improve to re-evaluate his polyp.
He will need a CBC to be checked on [**5-11**], and please have the results forwarded to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1771**] at [**Hospital6 2399**], [**Location (un) 830**], in [**Location (un) 86**], [**Numeric Identifier 48534**]; phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**].
