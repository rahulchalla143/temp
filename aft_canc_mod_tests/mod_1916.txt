However, pressures were labile (SBP 70s-100s); BP 70s and bounce back up on repeat, then sustained in 80s so RIJ placed and gave 10mg decadron.
EKG was unchanged from prior, CE Trop: 0.07->0.05, CK: 1163, MB: 16 (but in setting of CKD) and no chest pain; pt was given ASA 325.
Pt also had elevated WBC 21.7, CXR showed +LLL hazziness on prelim read and pt was started on vanc/zosyn (after also getting ceftriaxone).
Lipase 90.
Given Cr elevated at 3.0 from baseline of 1.8-2.0 and labile BPs, pt received 2L IVF and also central line placed.
X-ray of lower extremeties and spine performed given symptoms; premil read does not show any acute process.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2198-8-20**], LV function is now hyperdynamic with accompanying outflow tract gradient.
MRI Head: FINDINGS:  There is extensive, confluent T2-/FLAIR-hyperintensity seen in the periventricular and deep white matter, consistent with sequelae of microvascular ischemia.
In addition, there are scattered lacunar infarcts in the cerebral hemispheres, unchanged since the CT of [**2198-8-17**].

The patient was initially admitted to the intensive care unit because of systolic blood pressure of 50 (although reportedly asymptomatic).
She briefly required levophed and was aggressively fluid resuscitated with improvement of her blood pressures.
## Pulmonary edema: In the setting of aggressive fluid hydration, the patient developed hypoxia with pulmonary edema shown on chest x-ray and required BiPAP.
An echo showed a hyperdynamic left ventricular function with increased severity of known mitral regurgitation.
However no evidence of pneumonia was reported on repeat chest x-ray, and blood and urine cultures show no growth to date.
On discharge patient was afebrile and WBC was downtrending at 14.2.
## Vascular stenosis: Patient had uneven blood pressures in her right and left arm (left SBP 90s, right SBP 130s) concerning for aortic dissection in the setting of her low blood pressures.
An MRI chest however showed no evidence of aortic dissection.
This was consistent with her urine analysis which showed gross hematuria but only 1 RBC.
Her rhabdomyolys resolved resolved with hydration, and her creatine kinase and creatinine normalized.
Her creatinine returned to baseline with fluid resuscitation.
However due to concern for cerebrovascular accident, neurology was consulted and an MRI brain showed sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease without any acute intracranial process.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] ruled out a cord lesion.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] that time, she should: (1) get bloodwork to ensure that WBC is downtrending, (2) follow-up final urine and blood cultures, (3) follow-up endocrine labs (ACTH, IGF, LH) (4) discuss medication adjustments.
You had x-rays of your pelvis and spine, which showed no fractures.
A brain MRI was done, and no evidence of stroke was seen.
We also noticed that the blood pressure as measured in your left arm was lower than your right arm.
A vascular surgeon saw you and believes that this difference is due to narrowing of the vessels in your left arm ("vascular stenosis"), which is likely related to your diabetes and hypertension.
A chest x-ray showed possible pneumonia, so we treated you with antibiotics called cepodoxime and azithromycin.
With hydration your kidney function improved back to your normal level.
We sent a urine sample, but the results are not back yet.
