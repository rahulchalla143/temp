Upon his return visits to clinic for the last 2 days, he has required further platelet/RBC transfusions for plt counts of <10, Hct<30, with appropriate bumps to transfusions (Plt 6 --> 50 this AM).
He did remark that he has occasional episodes where he feels like his "throat is closing", which makes him panic and his blood pressures acutely rise.
Blood culture was drawn from his portacath, U/A and urine culture done, but they were unable to draw peripheral cultures prior to receiving his 1st dose of Daptomycin 450mg.
Labs are notable for WBC 1.6 with 4% neutrophils and 5% blasts, Hct 25.5, Plt 25, Cr 1.2 (baseline 0.9-1.0), and lactate 0.9.
CXR shows an infiltrate in the posterior RLL, seen best in the lateral view.
Past Medical History: Oncologic history: Patient initially presented in [**2119**] with easy bruising and dropping cell counts (pancytopenic) as well as some SOB/fatigue.
BMBx was consistent by report with myelodysplastic syndrome with presence of a 15-20% immature cells consistent with blasts; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt the pathology was consistent with MDS with excess blasts in transformation, suggesting acceleration of the disease towards acute leukemia.
Pt underwent induction and reinduction with single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] clofarabine per protocol 07-013, last treated in 09/[**2116**].
Since that time, he showed signs of dysplasia was dropping cell lines and bone marrow biopsy done in [**9-/2118**] showed blasts occurring in small clusters occupying an estimated 20% of the marrow cellularity.
Past surgical history: - Tonsillectomy as a child- age 5 - Appendectomy as a child - age 8 - Submucous resection - age 12 - Left meniscus repair of the knee - age 37 - Right meniscus repair of the knee - age 64 - Hernia repair left side - age 65   Social History: Occupation: former veteran from [**Country 3992**], ?

=============================================================== Imaging: CXR ([**3-12**]): PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the SVC.
CT chest ([**3-17**]): 1.
Right lower lobe, lateral-basal segment consolidation, new from prior study.
LENIS ([**3-21**]): Grayscale and color evaluation of the right common femoral vein, superficial femoral veins, popliteal vein, and posterior tibial vein demonstrate normal color flow, augmentation, and compressibility.
ANC of 64 on admission, s/p recent decitabine infusion, with fever to 101.4.
CXR shows a developing RLL consolidation, concerning for pneumonia (seen best on lateral film).
He remained afebrile since [**3-17**] when the oral levofloxacin was started (D1 = [**3-17**]) and tapering of prednisone to 10 mg was started on [**3-18**] per Allergy recommendation given his clinical improvement.
However, by [**3-21**], intense erythroderma again spread to include his face, which he reports never had before with prior antibiotics hypersensitivity, his body ached, and his LE became more swollen.
Given that patient had not spiked a fever since [**3-17**] and his hypersensitivity appeared worsened, levofloxacin was discontinued (total 4 day course) and prednisone was uptitrated to 20 mg daily on [**3-21**].
He was transfused with pRBC and platelet frequently to maintain Hct of about 30 and plt > 10.
He was started on hydroxyurea on [**2120-3-28**] and cycle 13 of decitabine on [**2120-3-29**] because of increased WBC (~11,000) and blast counts (~75%).
Acute kidney injury: Initially, his creatinine was 1.2, which is slightly elevated above his baseline.
His UA was neg and there was no evidence of active sediment.
His creatinine improved to 0.9.
This has been observed in the past where his creatinine rises with the chemotherapy.
It was noted that the past LUL biopsy did not appear to be infectious etiology and past bronchial washings were negative for malignancy on cytology.
Disp:*1 bottle* Refills:*3*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: - AML, Cycle 13 of decitabine - Healthcare associated pneumonia - Hypersensitivity reaction  Secondary diagnoses: - Acute renal failure, resolved.
