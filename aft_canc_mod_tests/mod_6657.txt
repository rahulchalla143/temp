Last chemotherapy was ONTAK CHOP on started on [**2148-12-31**] which was well tolerated.
Cord blood donors have been identified.
The patient presented with fevers and elevated LFT's in the spring of [**2148**], at which time a bone marrow biopsy from an outside hospital demonstrated large lymphoid cells which were positive for CD30, along with CD56, CD2 (subset), and rare CD8 positive cells.
The large cells were negative for PAX-5, CD45, C15 and ALK-1; CD20 and CD79a highlighted B cells; while CD3 stained T lymphocytes (subset).
Results of a repeat biopsy performed at [**Hospital1 18**] were felt to be most consistent with peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
A repeat staging evaluation included a  PET scan on [**2148-11-26**], which demonstrated patchy marrow uptake in  the vertebral bodies consistent with persistent disease.
Bone marrow biopsy showed large, atypical lymphoid cells which were CD30 negative but morphologically similar to her prior disease.

On [**2149-1-27**] the pt began to spike fevers and had blood cultures that grew Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
An extensive infectious work-up was pursued, but the pt was noted to have increasing numbers of atypical cells on her daily white blood cell differential which was concerning for a recurrence of the pt's hematologic malignancy.
