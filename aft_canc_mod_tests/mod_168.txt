CXR showed RLL and LLL infiltrate.
Transfused 1U pRBC [**2171-2-1**], [**2171-2-6**], [**2171-2-7**], and [**2171-2-8**].
# Hypoxia: Likely due to recurrent aspiration pneumonia + right-sided pleural effusion considering hypoxia, fever to 102F [**2171-1-31**], tachypnea (RR 30), hypotension, and CXR findings.
BNP 3543 on [**2170-12-13**].
Echo [**2170-12-14**] showed LVEF >55%, moderate MR, and mild pulmonary HTN.
He refused a repeat video swallow having had one last week as an outpatient.
Overt aspiration [**12/2170**] resolved, but this event seemed to be a recurrence.
EKG consistent with AVNRT.
Repeat CXR unchanged.
Cardiac enzymes negative.
C. diff toxin negative x3.
Stool cultures negative x1.
Mixing study negative.
A chest x-ray showed a new pneumonia and fluid in the right lung (pleural effusion).
However, you refused a video swallow test because of severe pain from the multiple sclerosis.
Also during your stay, your heart rate became very fast, so you were evaluated by Cardiology and restarted on metoprolol, a blood pressure medication that also controls heart rate.
After starting this, your blood pressure became very low for a short while and improved with IV fluids.
You blood counts remain low from myelodysplastic syndrome and chemotherapy.
You should have your blood counts checked at least every other day until they stabilize because you will continue to need frequent transfusions.
