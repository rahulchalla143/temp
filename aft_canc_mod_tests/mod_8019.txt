His diarrhea improved with these interventions.
#Anion Gap Acidosis - On admission the patient was found to have a primary gap acidosis with an insignificant delta-delta.
His lactate on admission was 10.7 and did not improve despite aggressive IVF hydration.
His lactate was stable with these interventions.
#Hypotension - On admission the patient's blood pressure was 110/70.
His blood pressures remained stable with IVF hydration for the first 12 hours.
His blood pressures remained stable for 2-3 hours then decreased to 84/60 again.
This time his blood pressures did not improve with IVF bolus so he was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.
Blood cultures were sent and he was started on empiric broad spectrum antibiotics.
A cortisol was sent which was appropriate.
His blood pressures improved with IVFs and antibiotics.
#Liver Failure/Hyperbilirubinemia - The patient had an elevated INR and low albumin.
The rest of his labs were not consistent with DIC, thus both his coagulopathy and hyperbilirubinemia were felt to be [**3-12**] extensive tumor burden of his liver.
#Hospital Course - In the setting of his recent diagnosis, the patient was originally full code on admission.
