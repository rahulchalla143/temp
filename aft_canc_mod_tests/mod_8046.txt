Admission Date:  [**2148-8-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-8-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-10-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim Ds  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: Flash Pulmonary Edema, Hypotension, NSTEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Arterial line   History of Present Illness: 81F hx of anterior STEMI in [**9-3**] s/p thrombectomy and BMS x 2 to proximal LAD, EF 55% to 60% ([**1-5**]), also with distant hx of Non-Hodkins Lymphoma and is currently undergoing her third cycle of Gemzar/Cisplatin for Bladder CA (most recent treatment [**8-15**]) that presented to the ED this evening with SOB and later hypotension.
ECG at that time revealed new ST elevations anteriorly and the pt was subsequently taken emegently to the cath lab.
Upon arrival to the ED, initial vitals BP 100/58, HR 101, afebrile, 98% on 100% nrb, RR 22.
She had a prior workup for hematuria in [**2143**], which was reportedly negative.
Biopsy performed on [**2147-9-4**] revealed high-grade urothelial carcinoma infiltrating the lamina propria present in the left lateral and right lateral walls.
This was followed by BCG x6 between [**2147-11-27**] and [**2148-1-11**].
Staging CT torso performed on [**2148-1-11**] revealed no evidence of visceral disease.
She then went for repeat cystoscopy with TURBT on [**2148-2-20**], with biopsy showing a focus suspicious for muscularis propria invasion identified in the deep biopsy of the tumor bed.
She met with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] this time for consideration of a bladder resection, however, given the complications of her recent heart attack, she was felt to be a nonoperative candidate.
She then met with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4223**] of orthopedics, who proceeded with a [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 500**] biopsy on [**2146-5-2**], pathology consistent with metastatic carcinoma, consistent with urothelial origin.
The pt succesfully underwent XRT which provided pain relief and began her first dose of gemzar/cisplatin on [**6-18**].

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-1-22**], wall motion abnormalities are new.
CXR [**8-17**]- IMPRESSION: Mixed response with improved aeration of the left mid lung field and increased opacity in the right lower lung field, for which positioning differences might be contributing.
ECHO [**8-19**]- The left atrium is normal in size.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-8-17**], the function of the distal 2/3rds of the ventricle has improved.
MIBI [**8-22**]- No evidence of perfusion defects.
CXR improved.
CXR reviewed with radiology and it was felt that she may have a RLL PNA.
ECHO showed LVEF of 15-20%.
Repeat ECHO performed on [**8-19**] showed markedly improved LVEF (40-45%).
By [**8-20**], lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no complaints of shortness of breath.
At 1AM on [**8-18**], patient had a 2 minute run of SVT and her pressures dropped to 50s-60s systolic.
EKG obtained.
BP after event 70s-80s despite increased levophed.
She continued to periodically go into and out of SVT with BP going as low as 40s systolic.
BP remained in the 90s-100s.
BP up to 130s.
Gave 12.5 PO metoprolol- HR dropped to 90s.
Upon discharge, vital signs were stable and patient was doing well.
# Pump:  EF in [**12/2147**] was 55%.
ECHO on admission showed EF of 15-20%.
Once treated with antibiotics, patient's heart function improved, symptoms resolved and EF upon discharge was approaching baseline (40-45%).
On admission, cardiac enzymes were positive, and EKG showed questionable ST elevation in leads V1-V3.
DDx at time included strain vs. acute plaque rupture.
Stress MIBI showed no evidence of perfusion defects.
Blood and urine cultures from ED grew pseudomonas.
She had another positive culture on [**8-20**] which was most likely contaminated (grew back coag negative staph- one set only).
All other cultures were negative.
She maintained BPs, checked stat Hct and T&C'd 1 unit, Hct 32.8, stable.
# Hyponatremia - Presented with sodium of 131.
Urine lytes were checked.
Acidosis was most likely related to poor forward flow in setting of volume overload and CHF exacerbation.
# Acute renal failure - Baseline Cr 0.8 but up to 1.4 on admission.
