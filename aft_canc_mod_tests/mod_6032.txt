MICU course was also complicated by pleural effusion (tapped) and coagulopathy ( INR increased to 3) thought to be due to IL-2 therapy.
Creatinine also normalized to baseline (1.5) .
Exam continued to be suggestive for pleural effusion on discharge, but given that the patient was asymptomatic no repeat thoracocentesis was done.
The repeat tap appeared to be exudative likely malignant given multiple pulmonary masses.
However, cytology was negative both times as was gram stain and culture.
