In the Emergency Room, the patient was found to have a blood pressure of 111/55, pulse of 59, and he was diaphoretic.
Blood pressures dropped to 100, and he was given 1 liter of normal saline with blood pressure response into the 110s.
Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine of 1.7 to 1.8.
Alprazolam 0.5 q6 prn.
Magnesium oxide 400 q day.
On admission to the Emergency Room, vital signs were as previously noted including a temperature of 98.5, blood pressure 111/55, pulse of 59, and patient is sating 96% on room air.
Abdominal examination was soft, nontender, nondistended, good bowel sounds, no palpable masses.
Rectal examination was guaiac positive per the Emergency Room.
Extremity examination revealed trace lower extremity edema, good dorsalis pedis pulses.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Significant for a hematocrit of 18.6, white count of 8.9, platelets of 20.
He is found to have an INR of 1.3.
An electrocardiogram done on admission revealed normal sinus rhythm [**Company 96461**]-wave inversions in aVL, V5, and V6, possibly old, also with poor R-wave progression, ST depressions, 1 mm.
CT of abdomen was negative for aortoenteric fistula, aortic dissection, or abdominal aortic aneurysm.
The patient was transfused initially 10 units of packed red blood cells while in the MICU for a goal hematocrit of greater than 28.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed during this admission which revealed myelodysplastic syndrome as the likely etiology of his now chronic anemia.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable, however, with serial hematocrit checks would be found to have a hematocrit of 25.9 or lower.
The patient was transfused to maintain a hematocrit at least greater than 28.
On the day of discharge, the patient's hematocrit was stable at 32.
On the day of discharge, the patient had platelet count reaching the 130s.
The patient will follow up in [**Hospital **] clinic for further monitoring of his myelodysplastic syndrome, and thrombocytopenia, and anemia.
He had a nasogastric lavage which was positive for return of blood.
Once the patient's hematocrit and platelet counts were stabilized, the patient was prepared for endoscopy.
The endoscopy revealed multiple areas of gastritis and small patchy angiectasias.
In addition to this, they also found an extrinsic compression of the mid esophagus by a pulsating structure, however, a prior CT scan of the abdomen had been unrevealing for aortic aneurysm.
An electrocardiogram was obtained which revealed 3 mm ST segment depressions.
The patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled.
