Only two of the seizures had clinical correlates which are mentioned above.
Routine sampling showed a background that was slow and poorly organized with a theta Hz frequency.
EEG Study Date of [**2111-10-20**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2111-10-19**] 2:36 PM FINDINGS: Prior sternotomy, joint chamber pacemaker, left pleural effusion and consolidation in the left lower lobe is again noted.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2111-10-14**] 11:02 PM IMPRESSION: Status post left parietooccipital craniotomy with persistent small hyperdense focus at the margin of the resection bed, which may represent residual tumor as suggested previously.
MRI is recommended to characterize this finding further, if there is no clinical contraindication for MRI.
MRI is recommended to characterize this finding further, if there is no clinical contraindication for MRI.
His physical exam was remarkable for clonus of his upper extremities and withdrawal of his bilateral lower extremities.
Initial head CT showed post-operative changes, hyperdensity which possibly could represent residual tumor, edema and possible mild midline shift.
Serial ABG's were initially performed showing improving respiratory status and BiPAP was discontinued within the first several hours of admission.
He became more alert and engageable and neuro findings on physical exam normalized.
EEG was performed on [**10-16**] which was concerning for underlying seizure activity and Neurology recommended continuing Dilantin and adding Keppra for improved seizure control.
Subsequently, patient was transferred to the floor where continous EEG showed that there were seizure activities.
Initial labs showed + UA thus raising the possibility of urosepsis.
Given respirator status, congested lung sounds on physical exam and serial CXR's pneumonia was also strongly considered.
On [**10-17**], antibiotics were tailored as suspicion for meningitis was very low considering his rapid clinical improvement and physical exam findings.
After he stablized on the floor, a two view xray was done and showed findings of pneumonia.
Concerning that CT head shows new areas of hyperdensity as well as ?mild midline shift.
Serial ABG's showed improving respiratory status amd Bi-PAP was discontinued after several hours on the floor.
Cardiac enzymes were trended and gradually decreased.
