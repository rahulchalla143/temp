-CT abd/pelvis ([**2162-4-23**]): 1.
Multiple hypodensities in the liver, unchanged from the prior studies, likely cysts, but correlation with prior imaging studies performed at other institutions (Atrius) is recommended.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
