# Retroperitoneal bleed: Atraumatic bleed in the setting of anticoagulation for provoked DVT/PE with INR in therapeutic range of 2.3 at presentation.
Initially presented to [**Location (un) 620**] where CT showed active extravasation on CTA abd/pelvis.
HCT 23.9, INR 1.8, received 1U PRBC and 10mg vitamin K and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Had CT scan at 5am on [**8-20**] which showed expansion with decompression of peritoneal cavity and his hypogastric artery was coil embolized, achieving hemostasis.
In total he was transfused 10 units since arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] (6 peri operatively) Last transfusion [**2140-8-21**] at 9pm with HCT 25 -> 30.
Was anticoagulated with INR 2.3 on admission, and is now s/p reversal given RP bleed coil of hypogastric artery.
Bicarb was 34 at the time of discharge.
He should have his electrolytes checked twice daily while receiving Lasix.
# Ischemic Colitis: Diagnosed [**Hospital1 **] CT [**8-4**], involving descending/sigmoid colon area.
# Liver and renal hypodensities: seen on CT scan last [**Hospital1 **] admission likely cysts vs hemangiomas.
# Transitional issues: - Patient will need IV heparin bridge to Coumadin (INR goal [**1-15**] for 6 months) - Will need daily INR checks until therapeutic - Patient scheduled for follow up with Vascular Surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] - Please ensure the patient follows up for interval IVC filter removal.
- Patient scheduled for follow up with [**Name (NI) 3463**] [**Name (NI) 2274**] - Pt will need his Na, Cl, K, Cr and Mg checked twice daily for 3 days while being diuresed with Lasix.
- Pt will need outpatient MRI/renal US to evaluate liver and renal hypodensities seen on CT  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
