Admission Date:  [**2168-1-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2168-1-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2137-10-10**]     Sex:  M  Service:  O-MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 30 year old male with a past medical history of pulmonic stenosis (now thought to be secondary to an anterior mediastinal mass), who presented with five weeks of progressive nonproductive cough, fever, and night sweats to an outside hospital on [**2168-1-1**], where a chest x-ray revealed an anterior mediastinal mass and a CAT scan showed the mass measuring at 11.3 by 14.4 by 12.0 centimeters, as well as small effusions.
He was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] where an echocardiogram revealed a 3.5 centimeter effusion with inferior vena cava inspiratory collapse and mitral inflow variability without increased jugular venous pressure or a pulsus.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature 101.8, heart rate 105, blood pressure 130/70, respiratory rate 27 to 32, oxygen saturation 98% in room air.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was 10.9, hematocrit 37.2, platelet count 381,000.
INR 1.5.
Echocardiogram revealed normal systolic function, 3.5 effusion at the largest diameter, inferior vena cava collapse with inspiration, question of pericardial studding, mild respiratory variation in mitral inflow consistent with some early signs of tamponade.
Repeat echocardiogram showed increasing size of the effusion.
Repeat echocardiogram showed decreasing pericardial fluid.
The patient had one further follow-up echocardiogram on [**2168-1-11**].
Hematology/Oncology - The patient underwent a mediastinal biopsy to diagnose the large anterior mediastinal mass.
The biopsy revealed nonseminomatous germ cell yoke sac tumor.
Staging workup included a head magnetic resonance scan which revealed no lesions, as well as an ultrasound of the scrotum which was within normal limits.
Fluid drained from the pericardial and pleural effusions were negative for malignant cells.
