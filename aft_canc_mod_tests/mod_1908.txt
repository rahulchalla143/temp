Abdominal CT did not show any evidence of ductal dilatation.
The patient's stool studies were checked for C. difficile and ova and parasites.
A CMV viral load was checked which returned on [**2188-9-12**] as not detectable.
The patient's liver function tests remained elevated until the patient received his first pentostatin dose on [**2188-9-10**].
Because the patient had not spiked a temperature and his renal and liver function tests continued to be elevated, the decision was made to discontinue his antibiotics, Levaquin and Flagyl, on [**2188-9-10**].
The patient also had new splenic masses on CT initially.
The patient will have a repeat CT in one week after discharge, currently scheduled for Tuesday, [**2188-9-23**] at 2 PM, to evaluate the progression of his disease.
The chest CT performed on admission showed scattered small nodules throughout.
The patient had a sputum culture sent but it did not yield any data.
In addition his lung examination was worsened with more diffuse rhonchi and expiratory wheezes.
Pulmonary evaluated the patient again and the decision was made to perform a bronchoscopy on [**2188-9-12**] to rule out any possible source of infection.
On [**2188-9-12**] bronchoscopy was completed which showed inflamed airways with thin white/clear secretions throughout.
Specimens were sent for micro and cytology.
His saturations remained 92-96% on 40-100% oxygen.
Per pulmonary, the patient should have a repeat CT scan which is currently scheduled for [**2188-9-23**] at 2 PM to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment on his disease and the size of the nodules on CT.
His fibrinogen began to improve on this heparin drip and the patient was also given [**1-31**] bags of cryoprecipitate prior to his pentostatin infusion.
The patient received fibrinogen and coagulation laboratory studies twice a day and was closely monitored through his hospital course.
An ophthalmologist was consulted to perform a CMV retinal examination to rule out CMV retinitis and this was negative for CMV retinitis.
Another CMV viral load has been sent off at the time of this dictation, and is still pending.
History of coronary artery disease:  The patient had new Q waves on EKG suggestive of a new infarct, and was cycles for cardiac enzymes x 3.
An echocardiogram was performed that showed an ejection fraction of greater than 55% but evidence of mild diastolic dysfunction.
His troponins have remained flat and a repeat set drawn in the intensive care unit showed a troponin even lower of 0.04.
The patient had also complained of  dysphagia in the first week of his hospital stay and with an oropharyngeal examination that was not very highly suggestive of thrush, but with patient's complaints of dysphagia, the patient was started on IV Diflucan.
