The patient presented in [**Month (only) 205**] with pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, evaluated by catheterization revealing ejection fraction of 30%, restrictive hemodynamics.
Ultimately he was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] Rehabilitation for further management and returned to [**Hospital1 1444**] after four to five days of worsening renal function with a creatinine that was 3.4, up from his discharge creatinine of 1.2 and his baseline at [**Hospital1 5593**] of 1.5 and also elevated blood urea nitrogen at 186.
Ceptaz 2.25 q8hours.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient is 75 kilograms, temperature 97.9, blood pressure 105/43, pulse 80 paced, respiratory rate 28, 100% on 50% FIO2 on assist control.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - tracheostomy site clean, dry and intact.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count 11.7, hematocrit 28.8, platelets 295,000.
Sodium 131, potassium 5.0, chloride 97, bicarbonate 21, blood urea nitrogen 186, creatinine 3.4.
The patient had a differential of 81 neutrophils, 1 bands, 12 eosinophils, 3 lymphocytes with positive toxic granulation.
Initially, his urinary output was on the low side making 500 ccs in his first twelve hours in the Intensive Care Unit ultimately with the creatinine that stayed stable or elevated to 3.4 on [**2124-1-27**].
The patient had a blood pressure that continued to be on the low side even for him though there have been frequent issues in the past of him being hypotensive while still perfusing his brain and also having good renal function.
Also because of peripheral vascular disease, his blood pressure tends to run about 30 to 40 points lower than his A line tracing when he was on the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] on a prior admission.
He received a unit of packed red blood cells during this hospitalization to improve his hematocrit to 35.0.
Ultimately, he had noninvasive arterial studies that revealed iliac disease bilaterally.
Ultimately his Captopril was discontinued and on renal consultation it was noted that the patient had high eosinophils peripherally, eosinophils in his urine, prompting them to discontinue his Zosyn and his Celexa for fear that those were causes interstitial nephritis.
His blood pressure was slightly improved after that and his creatinine began to improve rapidly within a day after initiation of those two interventions.
Ultimately, the patient at the time of this dictation had a creatinine that returned to the 2.2 range with urine outputs greater than one liter a day, not on diuretic.
The patient's white count remained stable and he has been afebrile throughout his entire course.
He has a sputum culture that is growing Klebsiella sensitive to Ceftazidime only in his sputum and a pseudomonas growing from his sacral decubitus that is highly resistant with sensitivity to Gentamicin.
