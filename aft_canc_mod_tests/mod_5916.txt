Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was borderline neutropenic on labs in the ED, and received cefepime and flagyl.
He was hemodynamically stable and his diarrhea was thought to be secondary to 5-FU.
His Hct was stable throughout and his stools were guaiac negative.
His coumadin was held for the history of a supratherapeutic INR (7.9) 1 week earlier.
His INR increased from 2.9 on admission to 5.5 today.
He had a short run of VT and then became bradycardic to the 30s, with a BP of 60/palp.
The plan was made to obtain a CT head to rule out intracranial hemorrhage as a cause for his acute change in mental status.
Also on his differential were CVA, toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, and seizure.
He was kept on Flagyl and cefepime for empiric treatment and his stool was sent for C. diff toxin.
Labs showed a severe non-anion gap acidosis, likely secondary to his diarrhea.
A femoral TLC and an arterial line were placed for further monitoring and management.
Cozaar 50 2.
Coumadin (held last week when INR was found to be 7.9) .
