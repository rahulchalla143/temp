Serial computed tomographies at [**Hospital3 14565**] showed stability of this mass but development of an apparent gastric colic fistula.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical examination revealed vital signs with a temperature of 100.6, heart rate was 120, blood pressure was 111/87, respiratory rate was 18, oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Pertinent x-rays revealed a computed tomography scan upon admission which showed a large low attenuating mass in the left upper quadrant encasing the splenic flexure, stomach, spleen, and pancreatic tail; invading the chest wall and diaphragm with a large left pleural effusion, and a small amount of fluid in the left paracolic gutter; tumor probably arose from the splenic flexure of the colon.
The patient was to have a Gastrointestinal consultation and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy for biopsies, as the mass was most likely not operable; however, if it turned out to be lymphoma we could possibly start chemotherapy.
The patient also had left upper quadrant pain with this, and the nurses found his blood pressures at this time to be 70/50 and 80/60.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient underwent an emergent endoscopy which showed a large blood clot in the stomach; most likely a bleeding source from the invasion of the tumor.
A chest x-ray also showed a large left pleural effusion compressing the right side of the lung with mediastinal shift, so a chest tube was placed at that time.
