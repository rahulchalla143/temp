Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 38**] Landing  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure with intubation, secondary to aspiration, MRSA and Pseudomonal pneumonia 2) VRE Bacteremia presumed from PICC Line infection  Secondary: 3) Parkinson's disease with chronic aspiration, s/p G-tube placement 4) dementia 5) delirium 6) Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response 7) CAD s/p CABG in [**2157**] 8) Restrictive lung disease [**3-21**] to asbestos exposure 9) Hypertension 10) Hyperlipidemia 11) myelodysplasia 12) B12 deficiency 13) BPH   Discharge Condition: Improved- breathing comfortably on room air, afebrile for several days Still with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, confused with hypophonia attributed to recent intubation.
Followup Instructions: 1) Weekly CBC and LFTs while on linezolid 2) repeat LFTs in one month (mild transaminitis here) 3) Check Thyroid function tests in 1 month 4) condsider head CT if delirium fails to resolve over the next week as the pneumonia and bacteremia/septicema are treated 5) titrate up beta blocker as needed for HR control, to achieve HR less than 100 beats per minute at the minimum.
