Her saturations dropped to 90% on room air.
On the day after admission, her hematocrit dropped from 20 to 7 to 20 and she was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
Pulse 72.
Blood pressure 130/50.
Respirations 18, 02 saturation 98% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Notable for white blood cell count of 9.4, hematocrit of 25.1 and platelets of 60,000.
Her BUN was 48, creatinine 2.0 and bicarbonate was 17.
Lactate was 3.6.
Abdominal CT revealed trace ascites and pan colitis.
Over [**6-5**] to [**6-6**], her urine output dropped and her blood pressure dropped to 100/60.
Levofloxacin was started for positive urinalysis, but blood pressure did not respond to boluses or normal saline.
Repeat abdominal CT showed resolving colitis.
Head CT was negative on [**6-11**] because of mental status and echocardiogram revealed no vegetations.
Her 02 saturations remained stable and she had not complained of chest pain or discomfort.
The plan was made for a swallowing study to evaluate for the patient to advanced to po tube feeds and discontinue the nasogastric tube.
Chest x-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe opacities.
The right pleural effusion appeared possibly larger than the previous one, however, the chest x-ray was PA and lateral versus portables on prior films.
At 5 p.m., the nurse went into the room and checked on the patient and she was conversant and had had recent stable vital signs at 4 p.m. with a systolic blood pressure in the 130s.
Her oxygen saturation was in the 70s at this point and the house officer was called.
The oxygen saturation meter was not [**Location (un) 1131**] properly and an arterial blood gas attempt was unsuccessful.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Probable etiologies for this acute event in unclear, however, because of the quick change in mental status to unresponsiveness and the manner of the breathing, a central nervous system bleed is in the differential diagnoses with her history of thrombocytopenia with platelet count around 20,000.
