LAPAROSCOPY AND NECK DISSECTION:  The patient was placed in the supine position and the tube was changed to a single- lumen tube.
The neck left neck and abdomen were prepared as well as the chest with Betadine solution and draped in the usual fashion.
We then turned our attention back to the laparoscopy and were able to dissect the distal esophagus and lymphatic tissue out of the hiatus and retrieve the Penrose drain which was then placed through the thoracoscopy.
Anastomosis was then performed using the [**Female First Name (un) 3224**] stapler, going through both the esophagotomy and gastrotomy.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was placed through the neck incision through a separate stab wound.
COMPARISON: CXR [**2171-8-1**].
FINDINGS: Portable supine plain radiograph of the chest.
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Comparison was made with a prior chest radiograph taken approximately six hours earlier on the same day.
A mediastinal drain is noted at the thoracic inlet.
LIMITED BARIUM ESOPHAGOGRAM: Scout image shows staples over the left sternoclavicular joint, left neck drain, right-sided mediastinal drain, nasogastric tube terminating at the diaphragmatic hiatus, and cardiomegaly with atelectasis.
Thin barium was administered to the patient, and fluoroscopic images obtained, showing no evidence of [**Numeric Identifier 3564**].
PA and lateral chest radiographs compared to portable chest radiograph from [**2171-10-8**].
The PA view demonstrated mediastinal air comparable to the previously seen - most likely postoperative, and within the neoesophagus.
The lateral view demonstrates air fluid level which is most likely in the neoesophagus and looks similar to the one demonstrated on the previous barium swallow.
Post-operatively he was tachycardic in the 110's, EKG was without changes, cardiac enzymes showed mild elevation in Troponin, his hematocrit was 25.4, he was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells; follow-up cardiac enzymes were normal, repeat hematocrit was 29, and he was continued on intravenous beta-blockade.
On POD 3 his right chest tube was removed without complication, repeat chest x-ray demonstrated unchanged right apical pneumothorax, he was oxygenating well on nasal cannula.
On POD 4 he was transferred to an in-patient nursing unit with telemetry monitoring, his nasogastric tube and foley catheter were removed, and his diet was advanced after he [**Doctor Last Name 1834**] a swallow study which was negative for a [**Doctor Last Name 3564**].
On POD 4 his left chest tube was removed with repeat x-ray demonstrating no pneumothorax.
On POD 5 he had an episode of atrial fibrillation which was converted to sinus rhythm with additional beta-blockade, he remained normotensive, and hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit of 31.3.
He was to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**10-21**] and his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
