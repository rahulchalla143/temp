However, peripheral blasts were still seen on her most recent bone marrow after the first cycle of decitabine.
Given her excellent performance status, she had been undergoing evaluation for possible allogeneic bone marrow transplant after controlling her CNS disease (possibly with radiation therapy in addition to chemotherapy).
She was found to have an elevated white count of 114,000 with 10% blasts and early myeloid precursors.
A bone marrow biopsy done on [**2153-8-8**] showed involvement with acute myeloid leukemia, most likely M5b with monocytic differentiation.
Cytogenetics were complex with deletion 4, derivative chromosomes 7, trisomy 8 and deletion 11q23 and derivative chromosome 17.
Followup bone marrow biopsy on [**2153-8-24**] showed 60% cellularity out of which approximately 20% were blasts.
On [**2153-9-12**] bone marrow biopsy showed 90% cellularity, which was entirely comprised of monocytic cells consistent with leukemia precursors.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2153-10-5**] showed 60% cellularity with blasts, were comprising 5-10% of the bone marrow.
Toxoplasmosis - causing spontaneous abortion at 8 months gestation in [**2133**]  Social History: She moved to US from [**Country 9362**] 7 years ago.

Multiple punctate foci of negative susceptibility on gradient echo images are stable since prior exam; however, significantly less conspicuous since the exams prior, for example MRI from [**2153-9-6**].
This apparent change is likely secondary to technique as a 3T MRI was done [**2153-9-6**] and the last and current MRI were done on the 1.5 T scanner.

Blood and urine cultures were negative.
CT Torso showed new lingular lung infiltrate and splenic infarctions, likely leukemic infiltrate though infection could not be ruled out.
Her CBC and differential was monitored daily.
Prior to receiving full treatment course, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for respiratory distress.
An arterial line was placed to monitor her blood pressures more accurately and draw frequent arterial blood gases.
When on volume control ventilation, she would overbreathe the ventilator but with decreased tidal volume, so her minute ventilation would be similar to when on pressure support ventilation.
Her blood pressures were low and could not tolerate sedation medications.
Tumor lysis labs were monitored and were stable, while intravenous fluids were continued.
Final blood and urine cultures were negative.
Mrs.[**Known lastname 83422**] urine output declined as the night progressed, and she became tachycardic to 130s.
Her hematocrit slowly trended down, and she received IV fluid boluses after intubation.
Through the morning, the patient had an increased vasopressor requirement to maintain systolic blood pressure, and she demonstrated worsening acidemia desipte maximal medical support.
Her physical exam at that time was significant for an increased tenderness and firmness in the epigastric area and guarding only in the epigastric region of her abdomen.
A CT abdomen/pelvis showed significant worsening of splenic infarctions and new renal infarctions, likely secondary to her leukemia.
