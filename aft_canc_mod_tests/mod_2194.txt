Further evaluation by MRI is recommended.
MRA Brain ([**2198-1-11**]): Some increased mass effect in left hemisphere when compared to the prior study associated with some increased edema and/or recurrent neoplasm around the operative site together with slight increase in the left- sided subdural fluid collection.
CT head ([**2198-1-11**]): No evidence of enlargement of the subdural hematoma since [**2198-1-10**].
Echo ([**2197-12-13**]): 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is hard to assess given the limited views but appears depressed.
The patient had an EEG with diffuse slowing though no seizure activity.
