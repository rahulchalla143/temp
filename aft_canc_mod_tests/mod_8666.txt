Review of medications showed that he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and during that admission his Lisinopril was increased and he was started on Amlodipine, also started on Keppra and Metoprolol.
Amlodipine, Irbesartan, and Lisinopril were all held on admission and not restarted.
The patient should have an MRI prior to that visit.
His lisinopril, Irbesartan, and Amlodipine were held as above.
Type II diabetes: Pt had elevation in his blood sugars likely due to steroid effect, and he was given Humalog sliding scale for control instead of his home Metformin/Glyburide.
We are planning to resume these on discharge and blood sugars should be checked in the outpatient setting.
