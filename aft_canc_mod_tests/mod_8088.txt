The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%) with normal regional left ventricular wall motion.
[**2109-5-13**] CT Chest w/o con: 1.
Her initial CXR showed diffuse interstitial abnormalities bilaterally and a questionable right base opacity suggesting pneumonia.
A CT chest showed moderately severe emphysema with an inflammatory interstitial component, also scattered areas of alveolar opacification which could be due to desquamative interstitial pneumonia or drug reaction.
Given this, and her lack of fevers/leukocytosis, and lack of improvement on the levofloxacin, this was felt unlikely to be a bacterial pneumonia so the antibiotics were stopped on [**5-14**].
A respiratory viral swab was ordered and a bronch was done with BAL, which did not grow any organisms and revealed pale airways suggesting an interstitial process.
