ECG Study Date of [**2134-5-15**]  11:12:34 PM Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response rate of 126 beats per minute.
CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2134-5-17**] 10:29 AM FINDINGS:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Although this study is not tailored for the evaluation of supradiaphragmatic contents, the visualized lung bases show bilateral consolidations/collapse on the right greater than the left with air bronchograms and trace bilateral pleural effusions on the right greater than the left.
Limited imaging of the heart shows moderately enlarged size without pericardial effusion.
Evaluation of the solid organs is limited without intravenous contrast.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is decompressed by Foley catheter in appropriate position.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2134-5-24**] at 10:56:45 AM      FINAL The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

A physical exam was performed prior to administering anesthesia.
Will need colonoscopy when more stable Additional notes: The attending was present for the entire procedure.
Bronchoscopy [**2134-5-26**]  Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.

Colonoscopy [**2134-5-31**] Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
A physical exam was performed.
The physical exam was performed prior to administering anesthesia.
The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.The digital exam was normal.
Impression: Polyps in the ascending, descending, sigmoid Ulcer in the rectum Ulcer in the rectum Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Colonoscopy in 6 mos.
No specimens were taken for pathology   Brief Hospital Course: 65yo M with a PMH of afib on coumadin, diabetes, HIV, HTN, and CHF admitted to the ICU with likely subacute GIB, with hct 12.8 in the context of supratherapeutic INR at 14.2.
He does not carry a diagnosis of liver disease or known GI pathology, however he has also not seen a GI physician and has not had an EGD or colonoscopy previously.
His EGD showed esophagitis in the GE junctoin compatible with mild esophagitis, linear erosion on the greater curvature of the stomach consistent with NG tube trauma, erythema in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis.
He had a colonoscopy that showed several rectal ulcers and polyps in the ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon.
It is currently unclear how or for how long his INR has been supratherapeutic.
Last known Cr is 1.2 from [**2121**].
# Diabetes: Blood glucose 216 on admission.
UTI- He was found to have a E.Coli UTI and we decided to treat for 7 days with ceftriaxone staring on [**2134-6-1**].
Transitional issues: Colonoscopy with GI within 6 months Gi says the flexiseal- would be best to avoid, but can continue for patient comfort/ skin issues.

Oxycodone-Acetaminophen (5mg-325mg) 1 TAB PO Q4H:PRN pain 22.
You were also seen by the gastroenterology doctors who recommended a colonoscopy that showed rectal ulcers, which may be where the bleed was coming from.
You should have another colonoscopy in 6 months.
This can help prevent blood clots.
