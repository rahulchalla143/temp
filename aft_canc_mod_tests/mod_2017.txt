LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 54.5, hematocrit 31.3, platelets 80, sodium 137, potassium 4.3, chloride 103, bicarbonate 24, BUN 23, creatinine 1.6, glucose 135.
X-rays of C spine negative, degenerative changes.
Chest x-ray lateral right sided effusion, no fractures, no pneumothorax.
CT of the head bifrontal subarachnoid hemorrhages with small area of intraparenchymal bleed on right.
Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm no acute ST or T wave changes.
Pulmonary:  Right loculated pleural effusion was drained by ultrasound guided thoracentesis, which drained serosanguinous fluid, which showed exudates with no evidence of empyema, no organisms grew and cytology was negative.
This finding was consistent with prior films obtained from the VA, which showed that the pleural effusion has been present for at least the last three to four months without change.
The patient's white blood cell count remained relatively stable throughout his hospital stay with predominant lymphocytosis.
Deconditioning:  The patient after his fall is afraid of further movement and is being followed by physical therapy for evaluation and treatment of his deconditioning and recommended rehabilitation in order to improve his mobility.
