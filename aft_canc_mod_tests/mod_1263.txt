CT OF THE PELVIS:  Small 0.7 cm lymph nodes are seen just lateral to the bifurcation of the left common iliac artery.
Severe degenerative changes are noted in the lumbar spine with anterior wedge deformity of L2.
Note:  Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin 903, MNF-116, p63, focally positive for pancytokeratin, and are negative for PSA, PSAP, CK7, CK20, LCA, CD30, CD20, CD3, S100, Tla1, and ALK.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Leukocytosis)  Given the patient's neutrophilic leukocytosis of 36K on admission in the setting of a pathologically enlarged 6cm left inguinal LN (by CT abd/pelvis)and left iliac LAD and lack of any evidence of infectious etiology, concern was for lymphoma or other malignancy.
Rectal exam was unremarkable and PSA within normal range.
Ct abd/pelvis with oral and IV contrast revealed left inguinal LAD per above.
Heme/onc was consulted and review of the peripheral smear revealed numerous neutrophils with toxic granulations but no lymphocytosis or evidence of blasts.
After patient's supratherapeutic INR was reversed, patient underwent surgical partial excision of 6cm left inguianl LN with results sent for pathology, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, aerobic and anaerobic cx, AFB smear, AFB culture.
A urology consult was obtained, and they felt that biopsy of this lesion was of limited value given the pt's known squmous cell carcinoma seen in the LN biosy and given persistent dyspnea and hypoxia and declining clinical status.
Oncology recommended biopsy of this lesion if possible for definitive diagnosis.
The oncology team also noted that chest lympadenopathy would have been a most atypical presentation for penile cancer and it was felt that a biopsy would be needed to further evaluate these lesions as well.
Prior to resolution of the need for further diagnostic biopsies, the pt's wife (and the HCP) decided that further work-up would not have been wanted be the patient, and he was made CMO.
Admission x-ray showed only bilateral atelectasis with a question of a mild pleural effusion.
A CT-PA was obtained due to the patient being subtherapeutic on his coumadin at the time of admission in the setting of a malignancy.
His LVEF was found to be >55% on TTE and he responded to aggressive IV lasix.
