[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 11003**] biospy of his right parietal lesion revealed a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder with evidence of demylination though was not diagnostic of lymphoma.
Further imaging revealed possibly progressive dz.
An EEG in the ICU showed no evidence of seizure acitivity and then he was transferred back to the floor.
Regarding his lymphoma, a repeat head MRI on [**2123-7-26**] has shown interval worseining of his mass.
CLL: dx '[**17**] when he was noted to have an elevated wbc on preop labs for a hernia repair, 1st tx in [**8-28**] w/ chlorambucil and prednisone for NS, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly 2. hypercholesterolemia 3.
GERD PSHx: 1. s/p stereotactic brain biopsy [**2122-12-9**] and [**2123-7-21**] 2. s/p ear surgery 3. s/p hernia repair in [**2117**].
Since his sz following the brain bx ([**2123-7-21**]), he has been at [**Hospital3 **].
Lungs: Clear to auscultation (anterior exam) Abdomen: Hypoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no rebound, no guarding.

------------  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2123-7-26**] 11:02 AM Again identified are numerous periventricular masses.
This appearance has not changed since the examination of [**2123-7-21**].
This now demonstrates an air fluid level, which is new since the prior study.
CONCLUSION: S/P biopsy of multiple bilateral deep white matter masses.
-------------  EEG Study Date of [**2123-7-30**] This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of a slow and disorganized background rhythm in the delta frequency range with generalized bursts of delta and theta frequency slowing.
-------------  EEG Study Date of [**2123-7-31**] This is an abnormal discontinuous 24-hour bedside telemetry.
It was made on the cardiac monitor and occasional ectopy.
-------------  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2123-8-1**] 4:57 PM 1.
-------------  MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2123-8-6**] 7:09 PM No significant interval change in extent and appearances of the enhancing component of the lesion involving the splenium and periatrial region of both lateral ventricles compared with the prior study of [**2123-7-26**].
Dilantin was titrated to a serum level of 19-20, and Lamictal was continued and no further seizures were noted.
Since there was no gross change on repeat MRI, it was thought that patient's disease continued to progress on a microscopic level that was not visualized by MRI.
In preparation, patient underwent endoscopic placement of a jejunostomy tube for continued PO medications (especially anti-epileptics).
