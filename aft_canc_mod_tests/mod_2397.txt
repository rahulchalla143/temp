# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt developed acute respiratory decompensation after receiving blood products, raising the concern for TRALI, transfusion-associated cardiac overload [**2-5**] acute diastolic CHF, progressive AML with leukostasis, overwhelming infection 2/2 blood products received, or PNA, with the first two etiologies considered most likely.
Cultures were pending for blood products received at OSH; blood and urine cultures were negative or pending during admission.
No remarkable casts or crystals were noted on urine sediment.
Creatinine improved throughout admission with gentle hydration with added bicarb and rasburicase.

CT head and C-spine were negative for acute pathology.
