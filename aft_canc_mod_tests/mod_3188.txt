EMS was activated and the patient was transferred to an outside hospital Emergency Room where temperature was 97.5, blood pressure 197/97, pulse 112, oxygen saturation 96% on two liters.
Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.38, PCO2 38, PO2 64.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates and the patient was started on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.
CT of the head with contrast was negative for all pathology.
The patient also ruled in for myocardial infarction on [**12-22**] with peak creatine kinase of 300 and cardiac troponin-I 2.1.
Echocardiogram on [**12-23**] showed ejection fraction greater than 55%.
At that time, a lumbar puncture had no white cells.
Given his dyspnea on presentation, a computerized tomography of the chest with angiogram was performed which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Other notable abnormal labs included an alkaline phosphatase of 1,000, lactated dehydrogenase of 800, and ammonia of 85, for which the patient has been receiving lactulose.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.8, pulse 69-96, blood pressure 126/41 to 151/68.
Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY/DIAGNOSTICS:  White blood cells 6.0, hematocrit 29.5, platelets 186.
Sodium 156, potassium 3.5, chloride 118, CO2 27, BUN 19, creatinine 0.5, glucose 125.
PT 15.8 with INR of 1.6, PTT 25.8.
ALT 17, AST 35, LDH 879, alkaline phosphatase 708, total bilirubin 0.6.
Ammonia 82, magnesium 2.0.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 90 with right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock.
Chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 **] showed mild diffuse pulmonary edema.
Blood cultures were sent looking for source of infection.
Exam, however, was confusing for left MCA distribution ischemic event with right facial and arm weakness.
Magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion was recommended, as well as electroencephalogram discussed above.
On [**12-29**], MRI was obtained, but, unfortunately, did not include diffusion imaging and Neurology consult recommended repeat MR.  On that day, Cardiology consult agreed with diagnosis of non-Q wave myocardial infarction and recommended increasing beta blockade and adding ACE inhibitor.
It was not clear whether wide complex tachycardia was ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy.
Hydralazine was added and carefully increased for blood pressure control.
Neurology was re-consulted and recommended repeat lumbar puncture and following of pneumonia, electroencephalogram, and ammonia.
Serum ammonia noted to continue to be elevated and lactulose increased.
Persistent tachycardia led Cardiology Service to suggest repleting potassium to 4.5 and magnesium to 2.5.
This service recommended continuing to increase lactulose, magnetic resonance imaging of the liver, but no liver biopsy as would not likely change treatment options.
His hematocrit continued to gradually decline requiring packed red blood cells.
Also, on that day, large volume lumbar puncture was performed which noted an opening pressure of 28 cm of water.
He also had an episode of hypoglycemia with blood sugar of 42.
His sodium had, again, increased to 147 and an increase in the dose of free water was again required.
Nerve conduction studies and electromyography were performed and consistent with a severe sensory motor polyneuropathy that was axonal in nature, felt to be most consistent with diagnosis of critical illness polyneuropathy.
On [**1-13**], blood cultures were positive for gram positive cocci in one bottle and vancomycin was given as temperature spiked to 102.1.
Bronchoscopy showed mild secretions and the tracheostomy was placed without complications.
On [**1-14**], minimal pressure support on tracheostomy was all that was required, but the patient continued to be encephalopathic.
Blood cultures grew mixed gram positive cocci felt to be possible contamination and only in one blood culture bottle; vancomycin discontinued.
Family was informed and partial autopsy with omission of the head was requested.
