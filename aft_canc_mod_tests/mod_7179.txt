She was transferred from an OSH with temperature of 102.
The patient was admitted to the ICU, given multiple fluid boluses, and found to have 2/2 blood cultures growing Gram Negative Rods, later E Coli sensitive to zosyn.
She was placed on pressors until her blood pressure stabilized.
She was started on cipro, vanco, flagyl, and zosyn presumptively; the vanc and cipro discontinued following results of the blood cultures.
She underwent a CT scan of the abd to search for a presumed GI source of her bacteremia.
CXR revealed increasing b/l opacities concerning for pulmonary edema.
ABG 7.38/32/62/20.
She underwent a CTA of that chest that revealed bilateral multifocal consolidations, worsening pleural effusions, now moderate on the left and large on the right, Anasarca, ascites, persistent hepatic lesion compatible with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, lucency in vertebral body of L1, worrisome for metastasis.
She was treated empirically for both with zosyn and flagyl; follow up blood cultures on [**12-17**] were without growth.
Following normalization of her hemodynamics and control of her pneumonia, the patient was aggressively diuresed for b/l pleural effusions (thought secondary to fluid resuscitation vs parapneumonic vs malignant, though no tap performed).
At the time of dictation the patient is without pain, on room air both at rest and while ambulating, has documented negative blood cultures ([**12-17**]), is tolerating a regular diet, urinating well and without other complaints.
