Incompletely characterized renal cysts - US may be obtained to further assess.
Left adrenal nodule, which is not compatible with adenoma due to attenuation of 25 [**Doctor Last Name **] - consider MRI to further assess.
CT Head [**6-16**]-IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with initial K+ of 7.4 and Cr 3.6.
Initial differential was for tumor lysis syndrome vs. rhabdo.
His CK, AST, K and uric acid were elevated at admission and improved to baseline over the course of his stay.
Head CT was obtained given reccent history of fall and did not show an acute intracranial process.
CT scan of abdomen showed no suggestion of hydronephrosis/post-renal problems.
The patient's Cr trended downwards from a peak of 3.8 around admission to 1.7 presently.
# Blood Dyscrasia: The patient presented with WBC >100 with 96% neutrophils.
Unclear etiology although the patient's wife reports that he sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital1 1474**] for a blood dyscrsia and is receiving radiation therapy.
Heme/onc did not see any immature forms on peripheral smear and did not find this to be either a blast crisis or tumor lysis syndrome.
His pressures were stable in the 110s on 6.25 mg metoporolol.
# Dispo: to rehab with instructions to follow up with primary care and outpatient hematology  Transitional Issues:  Will need: (1) Daily abdominal / flank assessment to make sure hematoma is not expanding (2) Daily CBC to ensure HCTs are stable (3) Daily INR checks to keep < 2.0 (4) Daily BMP to ensure potassium does not increase (5) Telemtry for atrial fibrillation - can d/c metoprolol if no further episodes (6) Can restart SC heparin if INR remains < 2.0   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] at [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: (1) Right sided buttock and right thigh hematoma (2) Rhabdomyolysis (with renal failure and high potassium) (3) Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] (4) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Able to sit up in bed with assistance; improvement in WBC count, resolution of electrolyte abnormalities   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr [**Known lastname 26735**],  You were admitted after a recent fall.
We made the following medication changes during your hospitalization: (1) Stop colchicine - you should only restart this when your kidneys are back to normal.
(3) Start metoprolol - this is a medicine for your heart that protects it from a fast heart rate that you had called atrial fibrillation.
