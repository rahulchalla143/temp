Admission Date:  [**2172-11-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-11-27**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: Evaluation for IR procedure for LGIB of unknown etiology  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Upper endoscopy 2.
Colonoscopy 3.
CT Angiography 4.
Tagged RBC Scan 5.
She initially presented on [**11-15**] from an [**Hospital3 **] facility with an episode of BRBPR in her bathroom to [**Hospital **] hospital, with an initial Hct of 31.9.
Ms. [**Known lastname 13144**] was hemodynamically stable and admitted to the floor where she sustained a gradual drop in her Hct (naidr 22.9) and platelets (89K) and subsequently transfused and.
On the morning [**2172-11-17**], Ms. [**Known lastname 13144**] received a tagged RBC scan that demonstrated no active bleeding.
Later that day, she began to bleed again and a repeated tagged RBC scan (11hrs post contrast) showed diffuse activity throughout the colon with the most likely origin near the hepatic flexure.
(Poor localization of bleeding by tagged RBC scan is noted).
Ms. [**Known lastname 13144**] was therefore tranfered to the [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation for possible IR.
At the time of transfer, SBP ranged 110s-120s, HR 80s, O2 Sat 98-100% 2L NC.

Prior to transfer from the ICU, vital signs were Tmx: 98.9 Tcur: 98.2 HR 77 BP 115/52 (110-144/42-106) RR 21 (14-28) O2 Sat 97% on RA.
Her Hct has remained stable at 27.6.

STUDIES: # ECG [**2172-11-18**]: Normal sinus rhythm.
# TTE [**2172-11-18**]: The left atrium is elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
# CT Abdomen/pelvis [**2172-11-18**]: <I>CT Abdomen w/ & w/o Intravenous Contrast</I> There is dependent atelectasis at the lung bases, without nodule, mass, consolidation, or pleural/pericardial effusion.
# Colonoscopy [**2172-11-19**]: Findings: - Contents: Red blood was seen in the entire colon, more in the left colon than in the right.
A single sessile 5 mm polyp was found in the sigmoid colon.
# Chest XRay [**2172-11-22**] FINDINGS: Thoracolumbar levoscoliosis, mild cardiomegaly, tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta are unchanged since [**2172-11-18**].
# EKG [**2172-11-22**] Probable atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Since the previous tracing of [**2172-11-20**] sinus rhythm has been replaced by probable atrial fibrillation.
# TAGGED RED BLOOD CELL: GI Bleeding Study [**2172-11-24**] Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen were obtained for 2 hours.
A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.
Blood flow images show no evidence of GI bleeding.
Dynamic images show no evidence for active gastrointestinal bleeding two hours after injection.
The study was terminated at this point due to patient request.
# Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasound Grayscale and Doppler examination of the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and calf veins were performed.
The other deep veins including the left common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, peroneal and posterior tibial veins are patent with normal compressibility and respiratory variation and flow.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 year old woman with history of [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH for evaluation for IR procedure for LGIB of unclear exact source.
# LGIB: Pt presented to OSH with LGIB and Hct lowest at 22.9.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where CT abdomen/pelvis revealed sigmoid diverticulosis but no active extravasation.
She underwent colonoscopy under anesthesia that revealed diverticulosis of sigmoid colon and polyps in descending and sigmoid colon but did not identify site of bleeding.
Endoscopy was performed that again did not identify bleeding.
She required 4 additional units of PRBCs during ICU course for Hct below 25.
She was taken for CT angiography that was also negative for active extravasation.
After all these procedures and her last unit of transfused PRBCs, Hct remained stable at 27-29 and she was transferred to the floor at that point.
Tagged red blood cell scan failed to localize the bleeding.
HCT stablized and was 30-32 at time of discharge.
On exam was tender to palpation and legs showed +1 edema.
LENIS was performe and demonstraed b/l dvts.
Currently blood pressure is stable on metoprolol 25mg TID and diltizem 30mg QID.
Rates were in the 160s and pt was becoming hypotensive; on heart rate measure showed rate of 207 but repeat was in the lower 100s.
# ?Sleep apnea: Oxygen saturation in high 90s on room air but fell to 80s while asleep.
She should be assessed with sleep study as outpatient.
Howver, albuteol could not be used b/c of afib so ipratropium was used.
MEDICATIONS At TRANSFER TO [**Hospital1 18**] - Nexium 40mg IV BID - Lopressor 2.5mg Q4H prn HR > 110 - Flonase 2 sprays [**Hospital1 **] .
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
You needed to be admitted to the ICU because of the extent of your bleeding and the need for significant blood transfusions and blood pressure support.
Multiple attempts were made to determine the source of the bleeding including a colonoscopy and a special imaging scan.
Medications were given to control your heart rate so that it would go at normal rate and your blood pressure improved.
A special ultrasound was performed which showed that your had clots in both of your legs.
