Currently his calcium levels have been monitored daily and if they continue to rise, can be treated with IV pamidronate, which he has received in the past.
Pain control: The patient entered the ICU with poorly controlled pain resulting from his metastatic multiple myeloma.
Chest CT revealed a dense RUL pneumonia.
Repeat cultures are negative.
Repeat Chest imagine on [**8-28**] shows progression of consolidation and the patient was empirically started on Zosyn 2.25mg IV BID and on the day of discharge is on d3/10.
Repeat imaging could be considered after his course is completed.
Positive AFB:  He was found to have AFB on his sputum culture from [**7-21**] during his prior hospitalization.
Addtionally, one more induced sputum was obtained and the ID team felt that further specimens should be obtained if treatment would be considered.
Furthermore, the ID team also discussed the option of repeat bronchoscopy with biopsy, but per the pulmonary service, the pt would need intubation to perform the bronchoscopy.
Chest CT revealed no PE but the pneumonia described above.
His calcium improved with these treatments.
The level was starting to rise again by [**8-24**], and he will need repeat dosing of pamidronate, possibly as frequently as every 2 weeks.
