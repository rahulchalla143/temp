At [**Company 191**] today and was found to be hypoxic to 84% on RA and CXR showed a left sided pleural effusion.
She was also noted to be tachycardic with an irregular rhythm and EKG showed afib (no prior history) so the patient was instructed to go to the ED.
Then tachy into 150s, EKG showed Afib w/ RVR.
Labs notable WBC of 9 but 32% bands, sodium 130, creatinine of 1.9 and Lactate 3.4.
Bedside ultrasound showed small pleural fluid on the left side.

LABS ON DISCHARGE: [**2152-4-10**] WBC 15.6, Hb 10.1, Hct 30.1, Plt 1011 PMN 86.6, Lymphs 9.5, Monos 2.8, Eos 0.9, Baso 0.2 Na 138/K 4.5, Cl 105/HCO3 26, BUN 17/Cr 0.6, Glu 101 Ca 8.4, Mg 1.9, P 3.8 PT 18.0, INR 1.6 Dig 0.8  RELEVANT IMAGING: [**2152-3-28**] CXR (on admission): Left lower lobe atelectasis and left pleural effusion; given the possible history of smoking, an obstructive neoplasm at the left hilum causing left lower lobe atelectasis and effusion cannot be excluded on this radiograph and is best further evaluated with a chest CT.  [**2152-4-8**] CXR (on discharge): There is background COPD with diffuse parenchymal scarring.
[**2152-3-31**] CT CHEST W&W/O CONTRAST: 1.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-11-15**], the left ventricular systolic function is now hyperdynamic (previously normal).
[**2152-4-3**] [**Month/Day/Year **] WITH SALINE: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe consolidation and effusion.
Repeat CXR was consistent with acute volume overload (see below).
Lung ultrasound was not concerning for empyema or parapneumonic effusion.
The patient had persistently elevated A-a gradients on hospital days [**11-29**], so a CT scan was done to rule out a pulmonary embolus.
Persistent leukocytosis on [**2152-4-8**] prompted a repeat CXR, which showed continued bilateral pulmonary effusion (L>R).
The pleural fluid was borderline exudative by Light's Criteria with negative cytologies and cultures.
Her ambulatory oxygen saturations were above 90% on room air.
Her heart rate remained stable in the 90s-100s.
Echocardiography with bubble study did not show any changes to the mitral valve and was negative for intracardiac and extracardiac shunt.
Her TSH was within normal limits.
The patient should follow up with her cardiologist and undergo transesophageal [**Date Range 461**] as recommended by cardiology.
# ACUTE SYSTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: In the setting of volume resuscitation, the patient's new atrial fibrillation with RVR and her underlying mitral valve regurgitation led to acute systolic congestive heart failure with flash pulmonary edema.
Her initial EKG showed ST depressions that appeared to be rate related.
Acute coronary syndrome was unlikely as three sets of cardiac enzymes were within normal limits.
# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: The patient's creatinine on admission was 1.9 (baseline 0.5-0.6).
Her creatinine improved with diuresis.
Her home lisinopril was held and not restarted on discharge given systolic blood pressures in the 90s-110s.
Urine and blood cultures were repeatedly negative.
CXR on [**2152-4-8**] prompted the thoracentesis described above.
C. diff was negative x 3.
Her platelet counts will be followed as an outpatient.
# CONTROLLED HYPERTENSION: Prior to admission, the patient took lisinopril for blood pressure control.
This medication was held in the setting of her acute kidney injury and subsequent systolic blood pressures in the 90s-110s from the initiation of diltiazem.
She worked with physical therapy and was able to ambulate without assist with oxygen saturations above 90% on room air.
- INR should be monitored for appropriate coumadin dosing.
Medications on Admission: CODEINE-GUAIFENESIN - 100 mg-10 mg/5 mL Liquid - 1 tsp by mouth tid prn cough 6 oz.
A chest x-ray was performed, which showed that you had pneumonia in multiple places in your lungs.
This was later confirmed with a CT scan.
You were able to walk without oxygen, and the oxygen levels in your blood remained appropriate.
Your heart rate was initially very fast, so you were given medicines to slow your heart rate down.
You were also started on coumadin to make your blood less likely to clot and to decrease the risk of stroke related to clotting that can occur in people with atrial fibrillation.
You had an [**Location (un) 461**] of your heart while you were in the hospital.
An [**Location (un) 461**] is an ultra-sound picture of the way that your heart beats.
When you initially came to the hospital, your creatinine was a little elevated.
Creatinine is a quantity that we can measure in the blood that helps us estimate your kidney function.
A nurse will come to your house for the next few days to make sure that the oxygen levels in your blood are appropriate.
