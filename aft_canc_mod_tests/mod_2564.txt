CT abd/pelvis ([**2165-7-10**]): 1.
She received 2U pRBC's with an appropriate response in Hct from 20 to 29.
In the ED she underwent CT abd/pelvis which revealed numerous diverticula, the most likely source of her bleeding.
After discussion with the patient's family and the GI service it was felt that in accordance with the patient's and her family's wishes she would not undergo an invasive work-up such as colonscopy/endoscopy.
Since did not have endoscopy/colonoscopy per familiy's wishes, upper GI bleeding can not be ruled out, so aspirin should be held until further evaluation from primary care team.
