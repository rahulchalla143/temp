He was subsequently intubated for combativeness and airway protection and taken for a head CT  that showed right parietal lesion.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
[**6-15**] MRI Head with and without contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
Multiple small foci of signal loss scattered throughout the brain on gradient recalled echo sequences.
[**6-16**] CT Torso: CHEST FINDINGS: Post-surgical changes consistent with left pneumonectomy and resection of left pulmonary artery sarcoma are redemonstrated.
