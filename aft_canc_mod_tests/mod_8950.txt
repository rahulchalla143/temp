The patient had a stress test in the past for left sided chest pain, without ecg changes, no perfusion defects on MIBI.
She called her PCP who had her get a CXR that showed a right sided pleural effusion and pleural opacities that was followed-up with a CTA that failed to demonstrate PE but did show r. pleural effusion and non-pathologic nodules.
An ECG showed no significant changes from baseline.
Her D-dimer was >[**2193**], wbc 13->11, and LFT's were all within normal limits.
Pt had CT that showed exudative right pleural effusion with negativ ecytology.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2197-1-20**] no diagnostic interval change.
Therefore, a CT angiogram may be considered for more complete assessment as communicated to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Lung window images reveal a rightsided pleurased nodular density and several small nodules scattered in both lungs, the largest of which is in the right lower lobe anterior to the pleural effusion and measures 8 mm.
CT angiogram demonstrates no pulmonary embolus.

Although the field of view of the CT makes assessment of skin exit sites difficult, it appears that the chest tube which has a more anterior position, with only a short segment of the tubing beneath the skin, is a malpositioned chest tube.
Please note that the chest tube which extends from the lung base to the lung apex in a vertical configuration, as seen on the chest x-ray, is appropriately positioned.
Bone scan would be useful for further evaluating this lesion, and for evaluation of other occult skeletal metastases.
* 1) DYSPNEA: After admission, a CXR was done which showed a right sided pleural effusion.
Right lung base atelectasis was present, with a moderate-sized pleural effusion.
A follow-up CT was recommended.
Cultures of the fluid were negative, and cytology was negative for malignant cells.
On [**10-30**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] then developed hypercarbic respiratory failure and was found to have stridor/wheezing on exam which did not improve with racemic epi.
A CXR was performed which showed an increase in the size of her right sided effusion.
On [**11-9**], another thoracentesis was attempted to take fluid off and make the patient more comfortable; however, fluid could not be aspirated.
The IP fellow suggested that a CT scan be performed for better characterization of the effusion seen on CXR, as well as VATS to obtain tissue at the pleural nodule for a diagnosis.
The patient could not lie supine due to significant respiratory distress, so she was transferred back to the MICU for elective intubtaion to obtain CT scan and subsequent VATS.
The repeat chest CT on [**11-10**] showed an increased right sided collection with worsening atelactasis of right middle lobe and right lower lobe.
On [**11-15**], the pathology from her pleural biopsy obtained during VATS revealed a metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
Immunostains were positive for CEA, cytokeratin, and S100, but negative for MART-1, TTF-1, B72.3, and calretinin.
PNEUMONIA: The patient had a CXR done on [**10-27**] which showed a nodular density right mid zone.
At one point, her cardiac enzymes trended up to a high of trop = 0.32.
EKG was without changes.
These cardiac enzymes subsequently trended down.
Other episodes of chest pain on this admission were not accompanied by EKG changes or elevation of cardiac enzymes.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: During her admission, the patient had ARF with a high creatinine of 3.6.
With IV hydration, her creatinine trended down, and on discharge was 0.5 * 5.
Two RUQ ultrasounds were obtained which were normal without evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystits.
