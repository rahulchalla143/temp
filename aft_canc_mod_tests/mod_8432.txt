Chest CT shows miliary lesions in lung, liver and spleen.
In OSH ED, chest x-ray did not show infiltrate and blood culture grew gram positive cocci in clusters in 1 out of 4 bottles.
Chest/abdominal CT revealed miliary lesions in lung, liver and spleen.
She was subsequently transferred to BIMDC to rule out tuberculosis and for further workup.

Imaging: CXR [**3-22**]: elevated right hemidiaphragm with atelectasis of the right lung base .
CXR [**3-23**]: interval presence of an increased density in the right upper lobe which was consistent with pneumonia.
LABS At [**Hospital1 18**]: PENDING STUDIES: LIVER BLOOD POOL STUDY [**2192-2-24**]: Focal increased tracer uptake in the liver which correlates with the suspicious lesion seen on MRI, consistent with hemangioma.
Because there has been equivocal enlargement of this lesion when compared to prior examination, additional imaging is recommended.
A technetium-[**Age over 90 **]m-labeled red blood cell study (nuclear medicine study) is recommended for further evaluation (this nuclear medicine study could potentially confirm that this lesion is in fact a hemangioma).
RUL infiltrate seen on OSH chest x-ray suggestive of pneumonia and miliary lesions in multiple organs suggestive of miliary TB, MAC or fungal infection.
--rec'd ceftriaxone and azithromycin [**Date range (1) 71671**] at OSH, then changed to levaquin on [**3-26**] --continue levaquin for now to cover CAP and atypical PNA --f/u OSH test results --repeat bld cxsx2, mycolytic, UA/urine cx --induced sputum x3 to rule out TB --repeat CXR and chest/abd CT --respiratory precautions for now --consult pulm in am, may need bronchoscopy if unsuccess with induced sputums --CIS >100.4, tylenol 325mg PRN not to exceed 2g/day --follow fever curve .
Influenza a/b antigen negative at OSH.
--rule out TB --repeat chest/abd CT --pulm consult and consider bronchoscopy/BAL/?Bx --consider CT guided biopsy of lesion and send for path and microbiology .
FEN: cardiac healthy/diabetic diet and NPO after midnight for possible bronch in am, replete lytes as needed, D5W w/3 amps bicarb at 75cc/hr overnight prior to CT scan .
On [**2192-3-29**], a CT scan of the torso was performed to rule out other causes of sepsis and respiratory failure.
Initial read of the CT showed "free air" in the pelvis.
Exploratory laparotomy performed on [**3-29**] which was found to be negative for any intraabdominal pathology.
Liver biopsies were performed.
CVVH was initiated and her acidosis improved, however her lactate continued to rise.
ADDENDUM: A few days after the patient expired, the final path report on the liver biopsy showed non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type, high grade.
