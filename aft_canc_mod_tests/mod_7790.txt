[**2137-2-16**]: CT head without contrast: No overt intarcranial pathology  [**2137-2-17**]: CT Chest w/o contrast: 1.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2-18**]/201, the severity of pulmonary hypertension has increased.
Doppler: No evidence of left upper extremity DVT  [**2137-2-25**]: CT Abd/Pelvis: 1.
No CT evidence for bladder leak in this somewhat limited examination secondary to lack of ability to distend the bladder with contrast.

Bedside Echo showed severe pulmonary hypertension, which was new compared to the Echo he had 2 days prior to this event.
Doppler US abd/pelvis on [**2137-2-28**] showed Inferior vena cava thrombosis extending at least from the infrahepatic inferior vena cava to the level of the IVC filter.
Thoracocentesis was done on [**2137-2-18**] and 1.2L bloody effusion was aspirated.
Repeat CXR showed increasing small right-sided pleural effusion.
Echo done [**2137-2-18**] was WNL.
Bedside echo (after the pt's BP dropped to 70's/50's and sat down to 89-90% on [**2137-2-20**]) showed new onset severe pulm HTN and new Right ventr.
# BLADDER/RENAL lesion: Found to have bladder exophytic polypid lesion on CT abd/pelvis at [**Hospital6 **] [**2136-12-10**].
CT urography at [**Hospital1 2177**] [**2136-12-10**] showed retroperitoneal conglumerate LN (per report: nonspecific - lymphoma,granulomatous, mets).
CT chest w/o contrast showed 1.numerous multifocal pulmonary nodules 2.Abnormal soft tissue seen in the mediastinum posterior to the esophagus and in the superior paraaortic retroperitoneum consistent with lymphadenopathy.
Cystogram showed no reflux or bladder leak.
Palliative radiotherapy was not favored by the patient due to possible irritative bladder and rectal side effects.
Baseline Cr 1.2-1.5 per OSH records from [**Hospital1 2177**].
