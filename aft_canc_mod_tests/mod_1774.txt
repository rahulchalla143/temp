On the floor, he was treated with 2 doses of 5mg Lopressor which brought his heart rate down from 140s to 120s and dropped his systolic bp to 90s from 120s.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient was noted to be febrile to 102 and diaphoretic.
Blood and urine cultures were sent.
CXR was obtained.
EKG showed Afib w/ RVR to 130s.

Lung volumes are somewhat low.
CT HEAD [**2177-1-19**]: 1.
MRI/MRA HEAD/NECK [**2177-1-19**]: MRA NECK: Neck MRA demonstrates normal flow in the carotid and vertebral arteries without stenosis or occlusion.
MRA HEAD: Head MRA demonstrates normal flow in the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.
CXR AP [**2177-1-22**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase in density at the right lung base, potentially suggesting increased atelectasis, notably in the light of minimal overall decrease of lung volumes.
ECHO [**2177-1-23**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary): PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA.
Neurology was consulted, a head CT and MRI was not evident for an acute bleed or CVA.
His CXR did not show evidence of infiltrates.
Foley was discontinued at midnight, unfortunately he had large amount of urinary incotinence with post void residuals of 700cc, Foley was replace.
