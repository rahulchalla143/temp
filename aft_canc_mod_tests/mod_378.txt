There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Differential considerations include necrotic lymph node (though the marked fluid signal intensity argues against this) or primary neoplasm such as a neurogenic or neuroendocrine tumor.
CYTOLOGY & PATH RESULTS FROM TISSUE BIOPSY DONE DURING BRONCHOSCOPY [**2116-7-2**]: 1.
Subcarinal lymph node: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
She will need to have repeat ERCP at the end of [**2116-9-2**].
No repeat flex sig/colonoscopy done on this hospitalizatin.
Both CT and MRCP done of abdomen to elucidate cause of biliary obstruction without definitive result.
Preliminary biopsy results available at discharge:  Subcarinal lymph node: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
She responded well to blood transfusions and no further endoscopy was performed given that she was clinically stable.
Her hematocrit continued to drift down during the hospitalization and she was transfused another unit prbc on [**2116-7-5**].
Hematocrit goal was 28.
Omeprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **] #.

Your colon cancer was also re-evaluated and we did several studies to try to stage your disease.
To fully stage your disease we are awaiting pathology samples from [**Hospital3 2005**] to be evaluated by our own pathology department, as well as pathology reports on the tissue sampled during your bronchoscopy.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] will discuss the results of these tests with you at your next appointment.
