Bld cx were drawn and antibiotics were started.
For his hyperkalemia he was dialyzed and his EKG was followed.
For his fever, cultures were drawn from his dialysis catheter, cdiff sent and he was on vancomycin dosed by levels for < 15.

On floor 97.1, BP 98/40, P 72, RR 16, 99%RA Gen: NAD, pleasant HEENT: MMM, no JVD, no LAD CV: RRR murmur noted though faint Chest:  CTAB Abd: +BS, soft, nontender, nondistended ext: no edema, 2+ PT, warm neuro: CN 2-12 intact, AAO    Pertinent Results: Initial EKG: baseline RBBB, widened QRS, peaked T waves .
EKG after HD: RBBB, QRS and T waves improved .
Admission CXR IMPRESSION: 1.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
CT chest [**8-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Evaluation of the central canal is limited on CT.  2.
CXR [**8-9**]: There has been a substantial increase in perihilar pulmonary consolidation which is seen on the lateral view to lie in the upper and middle lobes, less so in the lower.
CT chest: IMPRESSION: Worsening multilobar pneumonia, much less likely pulmonary hemorrhage.
This will be correlated to the results of the white blood cell scan when available.
WBC scan: IMPRESSION: 1.
No convincing evidence for spinal osteomyelitis although In-111 white blood cells may have some decrease in sensitiviy in the spine.
The patient could not complete the study and the submitted images are degraded by significant motion artifact.
Further evaluation could be made with either a dedicated CT through the shoulder or if the patient clinically stabilizes, an attempt at a repeat MR with more time sensitive sequences.

1) Fever of unknown origin/discitis/osteomyelitis/pneumonia: The patient presented with high fever spikes.
Patient had recently finished a three week course of vancomycin from presumed bacteremia from AV fistula, but per [**Hospital3 **], all blood cultures sent were negative.
All blood cultures and catheter tip culture returned negative/no growth to date.
Patient also had a known history of discitis and osteomyelitis of L1-L2/epidural abscess in [**3-28**].
He has had CT guided biopsies of this area in the past, from which the cultures have been negative.
A new MR of spine was obtained during his hospital course that demonstrated continued L1/2 spondylodiscitis with paraspinal and epidural phlegmon without a discrete abscess.
Another CT guided biopsy was considered, and therefore the orthopedic spine team was consulted.
Other infectious work up during hospital course included a trans-thoracic echocardiogram which was negative for valvular vegetations, ultrasound of chest wall (where HD catheter was) which was negative for absess, ultrasound of left upper extremity deep veins that demonstrated DVT in left IJ, initial CT thorax that did not demonstrate any absesses, but revealed bilateral pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusions, which likely represent fluid overload (although are considering other etiologies on differential), bone scan, WBC scan (revealing pneumonia), bronchoscopy, and an MR of the shoulder (possible effusion noted).
A repeat CXR was performed later in his course, which raised the possibility of disseminated infection or septic emboli.
This led to a pulmonary consult, and per their suggestions, we rechecked his Chest CT after dialysis, sent sputum samples and sent out an anti-GBM antibody.
Later in his course, the CT of the chest and the white cell scan revealed a multilobar pneumonia, so a bronchoscopy was performed.
Eventually with a source of pneumonia, and the patient having increased fevers, it was decided the patient needed to be covered and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics while cultures were pending.
2) Atrial fibrillation:  In the ICU, the patient converted into atrial fibrillation with a rate of 140-150 following hemodialysis.
His EKG improved post-intervention and we continued to monitor for re-occurrance.
6) Hypertension: Patient's blood pressures remained controlled on metoprolol, and the dose was adjusted for optimal control.
We did not restart hydralazine as the patient's blood pressures were normal, and we were unsure if this was needed (he is on hydralazine and not isosorbide at home, so less renal benefits).
MICU course [**Date range (1) 9459**]: Pt arrived to the MICU with a bp in the 80s-90s.
He received a one liter fluid bolus and his bp remained stable in the 120s for the rest of his MICU stay.
His cultures remained negative, and he was transferred back to the floor on [**8-19**].
