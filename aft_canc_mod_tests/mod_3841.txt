Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 13mmHg at baseline with minimal change with 100%FiO2 and nitric oxide.
There was mildly reduced cardiac index at baseline of 1.93L/min/m2 with mild improvement with introduction of 100%fi02 and nitric oxide.
B. ECHO ([**2182-3-20**]) The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Overall LV systolic function is probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be excluded.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-12-31**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower (may be underestimated on the current study).
Right heart cath showed severe pulmonary artery hypertension not responsive to oxygen or inhaled vasodilators and severe right ventricular diastolic heart failure with mild LV diastolic dysfunction.
# Hypotension secondary to hypovolemia: Patient presented to the ED with low BP and positive troponin (0.39) in setting of renal failure.
He was transferred for concern of cardiogenic shock; however, his blood pressure was responsive to fluid resuscitation.
CXR is not remarkable for severe fluid overload.
He may have had some component of demand given hypovolemia with cardiac biomarkers trending downward with fluid resuscitation (CK-MB 15 to 9, Trop 0.39 to 0.31).
During hospitalization, his blood pressure trended to SBP 90s without signs/symptoms of end-organ perfusion with associated tachycardia to low 100s.
His pressures and heart rate were again responsive to fluid resuscitation.
To explore his hemodynamics, a right heart catheterization was performed showing  severe pulmonary artery hypertension not responsive to inhaled vasodilators in addition to severe right ventricular diastolic heart failure and mild LV diastolic dysfunction (see attached report for full details).
ECHO performed did not show significant changes from prior ECHO in [**12-11**].
He presented in acute renal failure with Cr 2.1 secondary to pre-renal azotemia that was responsive to fluid resuscitation.
Cr at discharge was 1.2.
Medications on Admission: Albuterol 90mcg 2puffs Q406H:PRN Advair 1 puff [**Hospital1 **] lisinopril 10mg PO daily Tadalafil (dosage uncertain) tiotropium bromide 18 mcg Capsule Daily torsemide 40 mg Daily Supplemental Oxygen Vitamin D  Discharge Medications: 1.
Discharge Instructions: You had weakness at home and low blood pressure that we think was due to dehydration from the torsemide.
