CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2135-2-13**] 7:57 PM IMPRESSION: Right hemidiaphragm elevation with opacification posteriorly suggesting extensive adjacent lung atelectasis, though cannot exclude developing infectious process.
If findings do not resolve on subsequent radiography, evaluation with chest CT could be considered, preferably with intravenous contrast if possible.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2135-2-14**] at 1:59:51 AM      FINAL Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %) with hypokinesis to akinesis of the mid to distal/apical LV.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2135-2-14**] FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2135-2-15**] at 3:53:41 PM      FINAL CTA AORTA/BIFEM/ILIAC RUNOFF W/W&WO C AND RECONS Study Date of [**2135-2-14**] 8:02 AM  IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO TEE Portable [**2135-2-15**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-2-14**], left ventricular systolic function appears significantly improved.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2135-2-16**] 2:17 AM FINDINGS: The patient has been extubated.

Distal gastrectomy (A-L): - Peptic ulcers, 4 cm and 1.5 cm, involving submucosa; no malignancy identified.
[**2135-2-21**] EKG Sinus rhythm.
Opacification at the left lung base is unchanged, and pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 y/o woman with no recent medical care presenting to the emergency room  with mental status changes, elevated blood sugar and EKG changes with  positive cardiac biomarkers.
Admitting EKG did show convex ST elevations in V3 and diffuse TWI inversions in the setting of severe metabolic disturbance and hypertension likely representingh LV strain and not indicative of an acute coronary event.
Because of these findings, the patient underwent cardiac catherization where she was found to have clean coronaries.
Her troponins and CKMBs were trended and remained stable (0.17 initially).
Her chest x-ray at this time did shown  an elevated right hemi-diaphram with an unclear cause.
She was given fluid and initially placed on an insulin drip with close monitoring of her blood sugars.
After her antrectomy she was started on tube feedings and her blood sugars were still controlled with sliding scale insulin.
Her blood sugars have been averaging 160.
The urine specimen did grow out citrobacter and she completed a week course ceftriaxone which was completed on [**2135-2-19**].
Vascular surgery was consulted and she underwent a cat scan angio which showed complete occlusion of her left CFA.
GI service was consulted and she underwent an emergent EGD which showed a duodenal ulcer and severe esophagitis.
After repair of the duodenal ulcer, coumadin was resumed on [**2-24**] with close monitoring of her INR.
Her hematocrit was rechecked at 27.0 and she had no further episodes of bleeding.
Because of her history of limb ishemia, she was started on lovenox with a bridge to coumadin to attain an INR >2.0.
He blood sugars continued to be montired during her stay.
Her vital signs are stable and she has been afebrile.
She is tolerating a diabetic diet with close monitoring of her blood sugars.
