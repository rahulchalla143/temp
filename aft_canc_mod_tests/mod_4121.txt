The patient was also immediately followed by the endocrine service and their recommendations were followed in regards to regulating her blood pressure through a high salt diet and volume expansion.
A full metastatic workup was done and a bone scan revealed a intense activity corresponding to the left pubic bone lesion seen on the previous CT scan.
A drain was in place at this time.
During the evening of postoperative day number two the patient's blood pressure reached a low of 78/52.
She was immediately evaluated by the orthopaedic service and bolused 500 mL of normal saline, her electrolytes were repleted, and an EKG was performed revealing sinus tachycardia at a rate of 108 with no ischemic changes.
The patient improved after this episode and began to maintain her blood pressure in the 90's systolically and at the time of discharge was noted to be hemodynamically stable at 110/70.
She was given a CD with her X-rays, bone scan, and CT scan to be brought to her rad-onc appointment.
