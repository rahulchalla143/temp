ECG [**10-12**]: Wide complex tachycardia with right bundle-branch block and marked right axis deviation.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2105-3-28**] the rhythm, rate and intraventricular conduction delay with right bundle-branch block pattern and marked right axis deviation are all new.
CXR [**10-12**]: IMPRESSION: Hiatal hernia, otherwise unremarkable study.
EP STUDY [**10-13**]: Conclusions: 1.
A second, non-clinical VT was also induced with triple extra-stimuli (RBBB, right inferior axis).
TSH was wnl's and he did not have EKG findings or cardiac enzymes concerning for acute ischemia.
He underwent an EP study and VT substrate ablation (for full details please see EP study report) complicated by moderate left groin hematoma which was treated with local pressure and did not progress in size or cause a drop in blood counts or symptoms for the patient.
