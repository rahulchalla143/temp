On bronchoscopy appeared to have collapsing distal tracheal walls and proximal mainstem bronchi.
CT showed chronic appearing infiltrates and possibly decreased airway diameter with extensive vertebral compression fractures also with breast mass (biopsy negative).

The prominent finding on the needle examination is the reduced activation in all muscles examined; this finding may be seen in weakness of an upper motor neuron origin or can also be related to submaximal effort-clinical correlation is recommended to evaluate this question more fully.
CT Chest [**2118-6-23**] IMPRESSION: Decreased lung volumes and diffuse ground glass opacity may relate only partially to hypoventilation, in the absence of little clinical history or previous imagig, the differential diagnosis for this appearance is broad.
Comparison with previous imaging would assist in determining the time course and possible etiology of this diffuse abnormality.
CTA Chest [**2118-7-1**]: IMPRESSIONS: 1.
