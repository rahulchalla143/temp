In the ER, vitals T 102.7 HR 78 BP 90/67 RR 21 O2 95%2L, CXR with Lingular and LLL PNA.
His SBP continued to be low SBP 78 so CVL placed and transferred to the ICU.

IMAGING: * Chest CT [**2125-4-28**]: A 1.3 x 1.6 cm left upper lobe nodule is re-demonstrated, abutting a left rib without causing cortical breakthrough.
A focal uptake in the left nasopharynx with SUV of 11.2 of unknown significance, for which clinical correlation and possible direct visualization is recommended.
A focal area of FDG uptake with the SUV of 5.4 in the vertebral body of T8 without CT correlate, suspicious for metastasis.
Pathology L fever - [**3-8**] - Metastatic, poorly-differentiated carcinoma with focal necrosis (This immunophenotype is compatible with a lung origin and raises the possibility of a poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.)
TTE [**2125-4-26**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Chest imaging studies revealed bilateral honeycombing pattern, concerning for pneumonia in the setting of emphysematous lungs versus pulmonary fibrosis.
His BP quickly stabilized after IVF, initiation of antibiotics, and discontinuation of furosemide.
His sputum culture was negative.
Urine Legionella antigen was negative.
Pulmonary was consulted and thought that a bronchoscopy was not indicated at this time.
# Diastolic heart failure: EF > 55% on echo on [**2125-4-27**].
His counts quickly recovered, and his hematocrit was stable at discharge.
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed.
