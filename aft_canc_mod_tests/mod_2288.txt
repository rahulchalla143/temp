CXR showed increase pleural effusion and patient underwent thoracentesis on [**2158-11-16**].
VBG showed 7.08/69/43.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], intubated, and placed on CMV 550/16/5/100%.
Post-thoracentesis CT showed remaining large effusion and infiltrates.
Cefepime, flagyl, and daptomycin were continued.
Fluid boluses were given, which were minimally effective.
Serial ABGs were done overnight.
ABG was done, which was 7.80/31/250 with K 3.7.
CCU Course: On DOA, patient was found to have a pericardial effusion on CT scan and a TTE was suggestive of tamponade.
- Improved diarrhea in evening of [**10-27**] - CDiff neg x 3 - CMV negative on [**10-16**] - NPO, IVF - Repleteed electrolytes PRN - received Loperamide standing .
# FEVERS: - Concerning for infection - CXR without evidence of PNA, with B/L effusions - f/u stool cultures and blood cultures - F/u UA/UCx - PICC without clinical signs of infection .
# AML - [**Month/Year (2) 3242**] followed - Continude Acyclovir/Levoquin/Ursodiol/Cyclosporine/ Diflucan/Prednisone - Monitored lytes - Allogenic transplant precautions - Monitored fever curve and CIS .
[**Month/Year (2) 3242**] course: 31y/o man w/ AML s/p his second allo-SCT who presented w/ one week of diarrhea and fevers.
Right heart cath did not show tamponade, and pt was transferred back to the [**Month/Year (2) 3242**] service.
PICC line was pulled and cath tip grew MRSA.
- transfused PRN - R leg CT was negative for bleed.
R leg MRI negative for pathology, except for edema.
- cefepime and daptomycin were started (pt has PCN and Vanc allergy), given new fevers and decreased BP - stat portable CXR shows increased size of R pleural effusion, but no pneumothorax that could be causing hypotension - repeat echo did not show endocarditis or signs of tamponade .
- abd CT scan showed edema/inflammation of the entire colon, and involvement of [**11-27**] of the ileum.
- crypto and microsporidia were negative - stool O&P was negative - C.dif toxin B was negative - C.diff negative x 3 - pt had one day of levo/flagyl on admission, subsequently d/c'd as pt was afebrile.
- pt was also treated with solumedrol and cyclosporine for presumed GVH - weekly CMV viral loads were negative - pt tolerated clear liquids with occasional toast, with only minimal diarrhea.
- cxr demonstrated BL effusions w/o evidence of infection, L pleural fluid from prior thoracentesis demonstrates transudative process.
Chest CT showed large pericardial effusion, and BL pleural effusions.
Although echo was consistent with tamponade, right heart cath did not show tamponade.
Repeat abdominal CT showed larger pericardial effusion.
Subsequent CT's showed decreasing size of pericardial effusions.
- pt underwent multiple thoracenteses during the admission, and 1 L serosanguinous fluid was removed each time - per pulm recs, both pleurodesis and pleurex were considered - CXR showed rapid reaccumulation of pleural effusions - pericardial effusion decreased in size according to last chest CT .
#) HTN: pt had been hypertensive during the admission (with BP 140's/110's).
- metoprolol 25mg tid was given, with increased dose to 50 tid - nifedipine 10mg tid switched to nifedipine 30mg CR qd, and nifedipine then held in setting of hypotension .
- HIT Ab was negative - decreased platelets also might be secondary to flagyl (however continued flagyl given possible infectious colitis, and pt's intolerance of vanco) - towards the end of the admission, there was more concern for TTP given pt's rising LDH, decreasing platelets, and worsening mental status.
- pleural fluid LDH much less than serum LDH, suggesting liver or hemolytic source of elevated serum LDH - RUQ u/s was negative for clot - bili peaked at about 4.3, then began to stabilize around 3 - fluconazole was held secondary to rising bili .
Medications on Admission: Folic Acid 1 mg qd Pantoprazole 40 mg qd Oxycodone 5 mg q 4 hrs prn Triamcinolone prn Cyclosporine liquid form (neoral) 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] Ditropan 5 mg qd Pyridium 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] Acyclovir 400 mg tid Ursodiol 300mg [**Hospital1 **] Zolpidem 5 mg qhs prn Ativan 1 mg prn Metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] Fluconazole 200 mg qd Prednisone 5 mg 3T qam and T qhs Levoquin 500 mg po qd started [**2158-10-17**] for low grade temps and cough along with advair and combivent- plan was to f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] this Tuesday to confirm duration of course.
