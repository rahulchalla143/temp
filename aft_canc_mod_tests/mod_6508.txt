On initial presentation, she had BP down to 89/50, not responsive to fluids.
Cath [**2106-12-30**] demonstrated single vessel disease - no intervention.
A diagnostic paracentesis was performed without SBP.
ECHO was performed that showed volume overload with mild depressed systolic function (likely 50%) however it was a poor study.
She subsequently had a V/Q scan which was intermediate prob, but given concerns for massive GI bleed from varices on anticoagulation, this was not initiated.
Outpatient MRI has not yet been completed.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI  Past Medical History: After 5 years w/o medical care she presented in [**Month (only) 404**] with new AFib, NSTEMI, new cirrhosis, elevated CA 125 (400), nonvisualized ovaries on CT or US, 2.5 cm hypoechoic pelvic mass c/w fibroid vs ovarian pathology.
Was admitted [**Date range (3) 84220**], cath [**2106-12-30**] demonstrated single vessel disease - no intervention.
Was to have outpatient pelvic MRI to characterize uterine mass.
Other studies showed significant cirrhotic stigmata (varices, splenomegaly, ascites), and her breathing improved with aggressive diuresis.

[**2-8**] GRAM STAIN (Final [**2107-2-2**]):       2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably mildy impaired (LVEF 50%?).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-12-29**], unable to compare regional wall motion due to poor image quality.
[**2-13**] MRI PELVIS W/O CONTRAST: Single fibroid within the left posterior uterine body correlates with the lesion seen on ultrasound.
[**2-15**] Abdominal Ultrasound:  Patent hepatic vasculature, gallstones and sludge within the gallbladder, ascites, splenomegaly, right pleural effusion.
EGD [**2107-2-17**]: Findings: Esophagus:  Protruding Lesions 1 cords of grade I varices were seen in the distal esophagus proximal to site of previous banding.
She was noted to have a rising creatinine, an elevated (but not rising) troponin, a hematocrit below her baseline, hyperkalemia for which she received kayexalate.
Her pressures dropped from an initial 120/58 to 89/50, non-responsive to fluids.
She had an IJ placed, was started on pressors and admitted to the ICU for presumed GIB, started on octreotide, and had an upper endoscopy in the early morning of [**2-2**].
For her asicites she had a diagnostic paracentesis that showed no evidence of SBP.
An Echo showed some mild tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and an EF of 50%.
A renal ultrasound showed no evidence of obstruction and a stable right upper pole renal cyst.
She also had a V/Q scan performed to evaluate for pulmonary embolus that came back as intermediate risk for PE.
She received 2 additional units of blood that did not bump her hematocrit appropriately.
Repeat EGD did not show any stigmata of bleeding, only appropriate ulcerations at the sites of prior banding.
Her Hct remained stable over her last several days of admission at around 25.
An abdominal US was performed that showed patent hepatic and portal vasculature and no etiology for her transaminitis.
Initially she was not thought to be a candidate for liver transplantation because of her pulmonary hypertension, but she should have a repeat echo to reevaluate given her clinical improvement and reassess her candidacy for transplantation.
# Hypotension: Her blood pressures have been low while here.
Initial imaging with pelvic ultrasound was concerning for ovarian mass.
MRI abdomen was performed which showed the mass to be consistent with a fibroid.
# Coronary artery disease: Recent NSTEMI in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year with catheterization showing one vessel disease.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**12-18**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed for nasal congestion.
You required an extended stay in the medical ICU during which time you had your varices banded and required blood to bring your blood pressures up.
