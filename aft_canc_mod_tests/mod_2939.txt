Pathology Specimens: [**11-17**]: Uterus and cervix, hysterectomy: A. Leiomyoma.
Omentum, biopsy (H-I): 1.
Patient did well the night of POD #0 however had persistent low grade tachycardia with heart rate in the ~100's.
POD #1, patient was started on clears, transitioned to PO pain meds, and her IV was saline locked.
Hct was checked and found to be 25.3, this was repeated and was stable.
She had an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia without ST changes.
The following morning on POD 2, her heart rate was up to the 110's and UOP less than adequate at 20cc/hour.
Given unexplained persistent tachycardia she had a CTA to rule out pulmonary embolism.
This study was negative for pulmonary embolism but revealed pneumoperitoneum.
A CT abdomen/pelvis was ordered to assess her bowel injury given the aptient's increasing abdominal distention and new symptoms of nausea and vomiting suspicious for a post-operative bowel injury likely related to her recent laparosocpic hysterectomy.
While obtaining the preliminary CT results, the decision was made to proceed to the operating room for surgical exploration ([**2195-11-19**])for a likely bowel perforation.
The patient was taken to the operating room by the GYN team and had a diagnostic laparoscopic exploration that confirmed the findings of a bowel injury.
The general surgery team performed a exploratory laparotomy and found a 1.5 cm bowel perforation and stool in the abdominal cavity.
Blood cultures, urine cultures were drawn.
Patient was bolused fluids to  keep urine output at a goal of 30-50 cc/hour.
On ICU day two the patient's WBC count was trending down, she was afebrile and blood cultures remained negative.
Her HCT trended down to 20.8 and she was given 1unit PRBCs with appropriate bump in HCT to 24.9.
There were no EKG changes and cardiac enzymes were negative.
The patient then complained of abdominal discomfort and Abdom XRay showed findings consistent with an ileus.
CXR also done at this time showed increased pleural fluid so the patient was given 10 IV Lasix with good urine output.
She was continued on 2L NC to maintain O2sats in high 90s.
The NGT was kept in place until [**11-23**], when a clamp trial revealed low residual, so it was removed.
However, she did spike a fever to 101.0 again on the evening of [**11-23**], and had new complaint of abdominal pain; blood and urine cultures were done, as was a CT of the abdomen and pelvis.
The final read on this revealed no anastomotic leak, but did find an infrasplenic fluid collection, which was read as amenable to drainage.
Her Hct was found to be 21.6, and the decision was made to transfuse 2 units of blood.
On POD #8/#6, she was noted to have a Tmax of 100.2.
An EKG was done, as were cardiac enzymes and all were normal.
Her post-transfusion Hct was 29.9.
A set of LFTs were done which revealed a mild transaminitis as well as elevated amylase and lipase.
She remained afebrile but had a white count of 16.5.
Her abdominal exam remained benign and she had no further episodes of nausea or retching.
Notably, her WBCs were still elevated, but she had no other signs of infection.
It was decided to perform an MRCP to evaluate for any pathology related to the hepatobiliary system.
