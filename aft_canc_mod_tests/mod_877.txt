CXR [**2167-7-17**] No pneumonia or CHF.
Recommend repeating the study with standard PA and lateral view when the patient can tolerate.
CXR [**2167-7-19**] In comparison with study of [**7-17**], there is little change.
Further evaluation would require CT scanning.
Blood Cx [**7-13**] at NVMC: [**1-19**] bottle (+) for E coli; sensative to TMP/SMX, Amox/clavulonate, amp/sulbactam, cipro and levo; resistant to amp, cetriaxone, cefzolin, and cefuroxime   Brief Hospital Course: 89yo M with AICD placed s/p VFib arrest, CAD s/p CABG, and AFib recently d/c from OSH after being treated for E. coli bacteremia who presented after multiple AICD firings.
3 sets of cardiac enzymes have been unremarkable and there were no new ECG changes.
Right lung process noted on CXR is unlikely to be a source of a gram (-) bacteremia.
Urine was negative.
# lung nodule: First incidentaly found on CXR at OSH.
Pt should have CT scan as an outpatient for further evaluation.
We cardiovertered you because we believe that this will prevent the heart rhythms which caused the shocks.
Please make an appointment with Dr. _____ for further evaluation of the source of this infection.
