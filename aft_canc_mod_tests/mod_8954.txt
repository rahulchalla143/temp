PARKINSON's: While admitted, the patient's deep brain stimulator was interrogated and found to be without any significant problems.
He underwent speech and swallow evaluation on [**11-26**], which he failed.
Speech and swallow eval was repeated while the patient was on the floor, and the patient's swallow ability was completely normal.
