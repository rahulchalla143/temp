GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Image quality was suboptimald - poor esophageal contact.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
LVEF 50-55%.
Remaining exam is unchanged.
[**Location (un) **] PHYSICIAN:     Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent routine preoperative evaluation which included echocardiogram, pulmonary function test and carotid non-invasive studies.
Echocardiogram showed no aortic valve disease with only physiologic mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary function testing showed normal lung function while carotid ultrasound found no significant disease of the internal carotid arteries.
He remained bradycardic with a heart rate in the 40-50's.
He required blood transfusion post-op day three for a low HCT.
