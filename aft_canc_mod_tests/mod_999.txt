EKG at that time upon presentation was significant for T wave inversion in V1-V6 and RSR prime in V1.
White blood cell count upon admission was noted to be 1,800, hematocrit 35.2, platelet count 134,000 with creatinine 1.1.
The patient also complained of back pain and a bone scan was obtained where the results were negative.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was also performed which revealed normal left ventricular function and no valvular abnormalities.
A CD4 count was obtained which was found to be 15 and an HIV antibody test was sent which subsequently returned as positive.
The patient subsequently had a lumbar puncture and a bone marrow biopsy at the outside hospital.
The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further workup and evaluation for possible hemolytic anemia syndrome/thrombocytopenia purpura and requiring possible plasmapheresis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 36-year-old male with newly diagnosed HIV with a CD4 count of 15 and viral lode of 50,000 who presented from an outside hospital for further workup for his acute renal failure, hemolytic disease, thrombocytopenia, and transaminitis.
Given the fact that the patient was thrombocytopenic, a head CT was obtained to rule out intracranial bleed.
A lumbar puncture was performed during the hospital course which was negative and did not reveal any evidence of infection.
By CK enzymes, the patient had elevated CKs up to the 1000s, however, did not rule in by CKMB indexes which were negative.
During the hospital course, however, the patient remained in persistent tachycardia and chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly.
A cardiac echocardiogram was performed which subsequently revealed a small pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology on cardiac echocardiogram.
The Cardiology Service was consulted for further evaluation and their recommendation was to follow pulsus paradoxus and EKGs daily as the patient remained hemodynamically stable at this time.
The patient's blood pressure remained stable in the 150-160/90-100 range.
During this time, a lumbar puncture, MRI of the head and abdomen, bone scan, bone marrow biopsy, and lymph node biopsy were all obtained.
After all these studies were obtained, the patient was subsequently rapidly extubated and subsequently did well with face mask oxygen and subsequently titrated down to nasal cannula, then back down to room air.
A CT scan revealed lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum.
A CD4 count was obtained which revealed it was 15.
HIV antibody test was obtained at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Hospital1 **] which returned positive and viral lode was obtained which revealed 50,000.
Despite this during the hospital course, the patient continued to spike high temperatures to 104 degrees Farenheit and subsequently had to be placed on a cooling blanket.
All blood cultures drawn at [**Hospital3 17309**] were negative to date.
Blood cultures drawn here at [**Hospital6 256**] were negative to date.
However during the hospital course, the bone marrow biopsy performed at [**Hospital3 17310**] on the fungal culture grew out yeast.
Here at [**Hospital6 2018**], a lymph node biopsy on pathology revealed budding yeast and on fungal culture grew out yeast also as per the pathologist.
The pathology of the yeast was consistent with Histoplasmosis duboisii an African variant.
Histoplasmosis urine antigen was positive after being sent from [**Hospital6 1760**].
All of his blood cultures have been negative to date and all fungal cultures from the blood have been negative to date.
The only positive cultures were from the lymph node biopsy done here at [**Hospital6 256**] and also the bone marrow biopsy performed at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Hospital1 **] which grew out yeast.
As mentioned before, the patient's blood cultures have been negative to date.
The patient's lumbar puncture and CSF cultures have been negative to date.
Bronchial alveolar lavage cultures have been negative to date for viruses and bacteria.
The patient's urine cultures were also negative to date.
At this time, the patient's infectious disease source was thought to be disseminated histoplasmosis given the positive lymph node biopsy and culture and also the positive bone marrow culture.
A bone marrow biopsy performed at [**Hospital3 17310**] was relatively negative.
A Coombs test performed at [**Hospital3 17310**] was positive and the patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for possible workup for hemolytic uremia syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Upon extensive evaluation of the patient's blood smear/slides, there was no evidence of schistocytes.
During the hospital course, the patient was supported with transfusion with multiple units of packed red blood cells, platelets, and also fresh frozen plasma.
The patient's white count subsequently improved and remained stable approximately at 7,000.
Urine protein electrophoresis and serum protein electrophoresis which were obtained during the hospital course were negative to date.
Upon lymph node biopsy, the pathology results revealed that the patient had evidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in his lymph nodes.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient's CK enzymes subsequently continued to rise and seemed to have peaked at 5,000.
Alkaline phosphatase subsequently continued to rise and peaked at 600.
The patient's liver function tests were consistent with disseminated histoplasmosis.
Hepatitis serologies were sent which revealed that the patient was exposed to hepatitis B in the past but there was no active hepatitis B infection.
Iron studies were obtained which did not reveal that the patient had any evidence of Wilson's disease.
An MRI of the abdomen and also multiple CT scans were obtained which revealed the patient had hepatomegaly and splenomegaly.
MRI of the abdomen to rule out histoplasmosis abscess in the spleen or liver revealed that the patient had infarcts in the spleen and subsequent hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed that the patient had hemoglobin S trait.
Clostridium difficile cultures were negative and stool cultures were negative and no etiologies were found for the patient's diarrhea.
Renal:  Upon arrival to [**Hospital3 17310**], the patient had normal BUN and creatinine and renal function.
Creatinine was noted to be 1.1.
However during the hospital course at [**Hospital3 17310**], the patient went into acute renal failure with subsequent rise in his creatinine to 5.0 and upon transfer to [**Hospital6 2018**], the patient's creatinine remained at 5 and subsequently peaked at 5.5.
Abdominal CT revealed the patient had diffusely enlarged kidneys bilaterally which were consistent with HIV nephropathy versus disseminated histoplasmosis to the kidney.
After aggressive fluid hydration, the patient's sodium was corrected back to within normal limits.
The patient's potassium, magnesium, and calcium were replaced aggressively.
The patient's albumin was noted to drift downward during the hospital course to 1.6 as the patient was unable to tolerate much p.o.
