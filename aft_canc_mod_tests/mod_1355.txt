Admission Date:  [**2167-8-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-9-3**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bleomycins / Strawberry / Pineapple  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 477**] Chief Complaint: s/p fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 85M with PMH of both Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphoma currently on chemo who presented to an OSH after a fall in his driveway, pt was noted to be febrile and tachycardic in ED so transferred to ICU for further evaluation and work-up.
He was initially taken to [**Hospital3 **] where an EKG was performed that was concerning for ST-segment elevations.
Patient received one dose of atorvastatin and cardiac enzymes were negative x1.
His CBC was significant for a white count of 13.8 with an 18% bandemia.
Upon arrival in the ED, vitals were 99.6 HR 80-140s 130/77 22 97% on 3L.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and negative x1.
EKG was notable for sinus tachycardia to the 140s.
A head CT was performed at the OSH that was reported as negative.
A CT scan of C/A/P was done in the ED that was negative for pulmonary emboli and intra-abdominal pathology but he was noted to have a small-moderate pericardial effusion.
The patient was again noted to have an elevated white blood cell count with a bandemia of 8%.
Patient was given 4L of NS, blood and urine cultures were sent.
Past Medical History: HODGKIN LYMPHOMA: Relapsed disease:  In [**2165-12-9**], he was markedly symptomatic with fatigue, feeling lousy, and weight loss.Bone marrow examination in [**Month (only) **] showed extensive involvement by Hodgkin lymphoma.
Torso CT scan (full report on OMR) was mostly unremarkable; spleen was normal.
Bone marrow exam demonstrated CD30+ HODGKIN'S DISEASE.
In [**2165-4-8**], repeat bone marrow showed no evidence of lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease either by flow cytometry or by histology.
His symptoms, fatigue and loss of appetite, resolved.
Cardiac echo shows left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CT Abdomen: There is a moderate-sized pericardial effusion.
Evaluation of the solid organs is somewhat limited by the lack of IV contrast: The liver, pancreas, and spleen are normal.
The intra- abdominal small and large bowel is normal.
CT PELVIS: The rectum, sigmoid, and bladder are normal.
Pt was hydrated with IV fluids, work up included a CT chest/abdomen scan which showed a small pericardial effusion, no evidence of pulmonary embolism, no intraabdominal process.
Please check INR every two days and adjust Warfarin accordingly for a goal INR of [**1-11**].
# Renal Insufficiency; Pt has a history of renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine 1.2-1.3.
