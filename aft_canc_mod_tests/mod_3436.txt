He had a CTA to evaluate for PE which was negative.
However, CT showed 2 focal areas of irregularity in the aorta thought to be ulceration vs. dissection.
He was started on a dilt gtt in the MICU, with continued rapid HRs to the 140s and SBPs 80s-90s.
His HR remained in the low 100s to high 90s with SBP in the 120-130s.

Cystic lesion seen on pelvic CT corresponds to a 4.3 cm exophytic simple renal cyst from the left lower pole.
The left lateral chest is off the film.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2147-11-28**] 10:34 PM IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute fracture.

Indeterminate left upper pole renal lesion for which a dedicated non- contrast CT of the abdomen could be performed, alternatively, a dedicated MR could be performed.
Multinodular goiter for which a throid ultrasound could be performed for further assessment.
- His RVR was thought to be precipitated by dehydration and catecholamines in setting of fracture and pain.
-He was also started on metoprolol 25 mg po TID but his heart rate did not improve with this.
-DC'd lovenox on [**12-5**] and started heparin.
His heparin was discontinued when his INR was therapeutic on coumadin 5 mg.
His coumadin was decreased to 2 mg on the day of discharge for an INR goal of [**12-23**].
It has subsequently resolved and his SBP has been in the 110-130s.
- He will need his staples removed from the left hip 2 weeks from [**2147-11-30**].
He may benefit from an outpatient echo for routine care.
-Captopril 6.25 mg TID started on [**2147-12-6**] as BP in 118-120 range.
# Aortic ectasia - This was originally seen on a CT of the chest s/p MVA.
The repeat CTA showed a stable appearing outpouching of the aortic arch, descending aortic ulceration with thrombus and small hematoma as well as small right common iliac aneurysm.
* Fe deficiency anemia: The patient's Hct trended down to 27 from 39 at admission;  this occurred in the peri-operative period.
- His Hct remained stable throughout his stay.
*Interstitial Lung Disease secondary to amiodarone toxicity: Chest CT shows severe emphysema (the patient has a significant history of tobacco as well).
# Lytic lesions in bone - This was an incidental finding on a CT of the pelvis.
- Renal ultrasound showed 4.6 cm exophytic simple cystic lesion in left kidney.
