Echo on [**4-21**] revealed severely depressed EF of 20% presumed to be from myocarditis - viral vs. chemotherapy induced.
Repeat echo one week on [**4-28**] showed slight improvement to 20-25%.
Patient also underwent 160cc thoracentsis of R pleural effusion and received empiric treatment for pneumonia which was completed prior to transfer to floor.
You white blood cell count was dropped very low because of the chemotherapy but it was rising before your discharge.
