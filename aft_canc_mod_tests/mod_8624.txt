CXR on admission: 1) Persistent loculated left effusion with increasing fluid within the left pleural cavity and new partial left lower lobe atelectasis.
ECHO [**2173-3-25**]: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
CARDIAC CATH [**2173-3-26**] (PRELIMINARY REPORT): Coronary Angiography- Right domimant LMCA- Stent widely patent.
Because of the proximal mild lucency, it was interrogated with pressure wire that showed FFR of 0.92 indicative of no significant disease.
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2173-3-27**]: The trachea and central airways are patent to the subsegmental level.
Hyperdense material in the upper pole of the left renal collecting system likely represents retained contrast from cardiac catheterization performed one day prior.
Recommend followup imaging after resolution of pleural effusions to assess stability of findings.
Hospital course complicated by episode concerning for ACS but taken to cardiac cath and stents found to be patent.
Pleural effusion (chronic) most likely secondary to CHF but other possibility is malignancy based on CT scan last admission with ?
CXR demonstrates loculated left pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse.
Transthoracic echocardiogra showed preserved EF, 1+ MR, and elevated left ventricular end-diatolic pressures.
Repeat imaging showed improvement in pleural effusions after diuresis and no thoracentesis was pursued.
Repeat CT of the chest reported that they hyperdense mass commented on CT from [**2172-11-18**] is most likely rounded atelectasis, and not a mass; however repeat imaging after resolution of pleural effusions is recommended.
There was a concerning area on Chest CT from [**2172-11-18**] which seemd more likely to represent rounded atelectasis on repeat CT from this admission.
Follow-up imaging is recommended after resolution of pleural effusions.
Of note, thoracentesis from [**2172-11-18**] was consistent with transudative process and cytology was negative for malignancy.
Troponins increased in setting of worsening renal function, but CK-MB remained flat.
Patient started on a heparin drip and underwent cath which demonstrated no in-stent thrombosis.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
Pt was monitored and Cr improved prior to discharge (down to 2.3) with expected continued improvement.
-Pt needs follow-up chest imaging with resolution of pleural effusions.
-Pt should have creatinine checked in next 2-4 weeks to ensure return to previous renal function.
