Vital signs in the ED:  103.8  165  151/127  16  95 on 4L .
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt's BP dropped to 80s/60s.
A CVL (R-IJ) was attempted but the pt was uncooperative.
Pertinent labs in the ED included lactate 7.6, creatinine 1.7, troponin 0.06, INR 6.1.
Blood cultures were sent from the ED.
Pertinent Results: CXR [**2134-5-8**] FINDINGS: Lung volumes are again low and absence of lateral limits assessment.
IMPRESSION: Increase in size of left greater than right upper lung, possibly pleural-based based on the prior examination, opacities for which further evaluation by CT is recommended.

ROS: afebrile, no chest pain PMH: CHF  discharge exam EXAM:97.2 119/72 HR 74 18 96 RA lung sounds clear without crackles or wheezes irregular s1 and s2 soft, non-distended/non-tender abdomen trace peripheral edema  DATA INR 4.1, Creat 0.8 I personally reviewed her chest CT with radiology demonstrating bilateral chest masses  Medical Decision Making:  #SEPTIC SHOCK: Pt presented with SBP in 90s which was unresponsive to fluids (but only received 1.5L) and lactate of 7.6.
Urinalysis showed evidence of UTI.
Shy was transferred out of the ICU to the medical floor on [**5-9**].
Blood cultures and urine cultures both grew pan-sensitive E.Coli.
Repeat blood culture is negative.
# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: Creatinine 1.7 on admission from apparent baseline of 0.9-1.0 (last [**2134-4-28**]).
As of [**5-12**], her creatinine improved to 0.8.
INR trended down and is 2.3 as of [**5-10**], so coumadin was resumed at 2.5mg (home dose), but INR was 4.1 after 2 doses, so coumadin will be held until INR trends back down.
Troponin trended down after admission.
Her CHADS2 score is 5 (age, CHF, DM2, prior CVA); she is on coumadin as an outpatient.
Pt was monitored on telemetry in the ICU.
Coumadin was resumed on [**5-11**], but held on discharge for INR > 4.0  Metoprolol was resumed in TID dosing on [**5-11**].
#Lung mass: Pt previously noted on CXR [**3-21**] to have bilateral pleural opacifications in the upper lung fields.
A chest CT documented large bilateral pulmonary masses with an appearance concerning for malignancy though given the rapid change in appearance on CXR radiology also felt a fungal infection could also be on the differential.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with sepsis from a UTI leading to positive blood cultures growing E. Coli.
Initially you were admitted to the MICU where your blood pressure was stabilized and antibiotics were begun.
Lung masses were found on chest CT that are suspected to be lung cancer but given your age and medical problems, you and your family decided against performing a biopsy.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
Nifidipine was also stopped, but can be resumed if BP is high  Followup Instructions: When you are discharged from rehab please call your PCP's office to arrange a followup appointment  Name: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] L.
