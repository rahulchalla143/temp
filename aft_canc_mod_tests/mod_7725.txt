His PCP then recommended cognitive neurology evaluate the patient and after seeing him and conferring with his PCP it was recommended that he obtain a MRI scan of the Brain which was obtained on [**6-25**].
Immediately following the scan he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup as the MRI showed a right sided lesion compressing the right lateral ventricle.
Consider chest CT for further evaluation.
[**2134-6-26**] CT TORSO CT OF THORAX: Normal appearance of the thyroid gland.
CT OF ABDOMEN: Note is made of a 6-mm hypodensity in segment VII of the right lobe of liver.
CT OF PELVIS: The prostate is enlarged, measuring 5.8 x 4.7 cm in maximal axial dimensions.
[**2134-6-28**] CTA 1.
[**2134-6-30**] CT head Impression: Expected post-biopsy changes as above and redemonstration of a right intracranial mass with consequent obstructive hydrocephalus.
The functional MRI of the brain demonstrates the expected activation areas in the primary motor cortex, with no evidence of areas of activation adjacent to the mass lesion.
[**2134-7-1**]  CT head IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2134-7-5**] MRI Brain Wand study FINDINGS: The patient is status post right frontal ventriculostomy with the tip of the drainage catheter abutting the septum pellucidum.
Small extraaxial right parietal and temporal, but moderate bifrontal pneumocephalus, correlate clinically and repeat CT is recommended to monitor for tension pneumocephalus.
[**2134-7-11**] CT Head Slight increase in size of lateral ventricles when compared to previous scan.
[**7-12**] CT Head 1.
[**7-13**] CT Head 1.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted through the emergency department to the ICU after outpatient MRI revealed new brain mass.
His exam remained stable and he was transferred to the stepdown unit.
He underwent screening CT torso to eval for primary malignancy - this was negative.
He remained stable in the stepdown unit and a CTA of the head was otbained to assess the vasculature surrounding the lesion.
He was planned for a stereotactic brain biopsy for [**6-30**] to aid in diagnosing the lesion in order to direct further care.
On [**6-30**] he underwent the biopsy without difficulty and he tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the ICU for Q1 hour neurochecks and SBP control less than 140.
Exam was stable before and after EVD placement.
CT head demostrated catheter placement within the right lateral ventricle without interim hemorrhage.
His dilantin was subtherpeautic and this was corrected.
He remained intubated until POD1 after a postop MRI could be done.
A repeat CT scan on [**7-11**] did show slightly enlarged ventricles when compared to previous exam but his neurologic exam remained stable.
A repeat CT showed no evidence of hydrocephalus.
A repeat LENIs showed no evidence for DVT.
