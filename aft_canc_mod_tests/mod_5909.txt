Rheum workup was unrevealing.
Since admission, she underwent renal evaluation and was found to have dysmorphic red cells and muddy brown casts in her urine.
However renal biopsy revealed collapsing FSGS.

Slight improvement in diffuse peribronchovascular patchy and nodular opacities, which may again be due to vasculitic or infectious process.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2111-10-22**], no major change.

Pt's serologies sent out for extensive rheum/renal w/u - pt's sx started to improve with treatment.
A renal biopsy was done on left kidney [**10-22**] and eventually showed collapsing FSGS.
However, renal biopsy did not show vasculitis and [**Doctor First Name **]/ANCA negative.
Pulmonary was consulted for further evaluation given concern for infectious process in the lungs.
PPD was placed, and was negative.
Viral/infectious serology/cutlures sent and were negative.
Pulmonary recommended a repeat chest CT, with initial plan for bronchoscopy with BAL and biopsy.
However the repeat CT scan showed great improvement in the infiltrates with steroids and dialysis.
However, after two weeks of dialysis and steroids, repeat CT [**11-8**] did now show much difference from [**10-22**] other than decreased pleural effusions.
She did not have any orthopnea, echo showed small LV/RV, she became tachycardic with standing (100-150s), and she had NO peripheral edema.
Also, she was having intermittent fevers to 102 and intermittent O2 requirements.
ID and Rheum also felt that there was something more inflammatory in etiology (ESR 122) that needed to be further evaluated, especially since the CT did not show much improvement in the reticulonodular/peribronchovascular opacities.
Thus the CT service/Interventional Pulmonary service were consulted, and they recommended bronch/BAL on [**11-16**], followed by VATS if necessary.
As for her ARF, acute nephrotic syndrome, progressive renal failure, and renal biopsy c/w collapsing FSGS, the etiology was not clear.
HTLV, HIV, parvovirus, lyme/EBV/CMV and other viruses were all negative.
As she did not improve on pulse steroids (prednisone 100mg qod), and she became progressively uremic, she was started on HD.
A CXR revealed RML infiltrate c/w PNA and the Pt was Rx with Azithromycin on [**10-6**].
Rheumatologic workup thus far has included negative ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-dsDNA, anti-mitochondrial, and NL C3C4.
A workup for elevated PTT has been non-specific with ongoing mild elevations in PTT with normal PT.
Anti-cardiolipin IgG is negative while IgM is positive.
There was also concern for breast cancer recurrence based on CT findings for her pulmonary work up, but diagnostic mammography was negative for Ca.
She was transfered the [**Hospital Ward Name **] on [**2111-11-16**] for diagnostic bronchoscopy, after which the [**Hospital1 139**] Medicine team took over her care.
Her saturation on transfer was 76% on RA and 96% on 70% hydrated face mask.
# ARF/collapsing FSGS: Biopsy on [**2111-10-22**] showed collasping FSGS, and pulse steroids were started in addition to HD.
Imaging was suggestive of vasculitis but [**Doctor First Name **]/ANCA negative as noted above.
Infectious work-up was negative, and she did not worsen on high dose steroids and off antibiotics.
Bronchoscopy showed 2 adherent white plaques on erythematous bases concerning for [**Female First Name (un) 564**], so fluconazole was started.
BAL fungal culture was positive.
Today her pathology confirmed BOOP, and the Pulmonary consult team recommended continuing her on high-dose steroids.
Pulmonary embolism was considered, but UE/LE dopplers were negative, and echocardiogram showed small but normal RV, no pulmonary HTN.
We were unable to obtain CTA or V/Q scan due to her poor renal function and abnormal CXR, respectively.
Her pulse is now in the 90s with transient tachycardia to 140s with exertion.
CT [**11-3**] with fibroid uterus, and patient had been menstrating during the same period.
CT on [**2111-10-29**] showed L breast spiculated nodule and R breast opacity.
Diagnostic mammogram on [**2111-11-10**] was negative for malignancy.

A biopsy of your kidney showed collapsing focal segmental glomerular sclerosis.
We did a bronchoscopy and a biopsy of your lung to determine why you are coughing and have hypoxia.
The bronchoscopy showed evidence of a fungal infection, which we are treating.
The biopsy of your lung showed bronchiolitis obliteran organizing pneumonitis, or BOOP.
