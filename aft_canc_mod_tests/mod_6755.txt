Post arrest ECG showed ST depressions in V3-V6.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, intial BP 155/65, HR 89.

ECG [**2130-2-6**] [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]: NSR @ 90 w/ LAD and 1st degree AVB.
ECG [**2130-2-7**] [**Hospital1 18**]: Sinus bradycardia 42 w/ PVC.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**2130-2-14**] Right shoulder x-ray: There is no evidence of an acute bony injury.
[**2130-2-14**] Right hand x-ray: There are degenerative changes but no fracture is seen on the single views.
Coronary angigraphy of this right dominant system revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling pressures with LVEDP of 25 mm Hg.
Systemic arterial pressures were normal with aortic systolic pressure of 119 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation with anterolateral hypokinesis and LVEF of 40%.
[**2130-2-12**] MRI BRAIN FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, edema, or mass effect.
Intervertebral osteophyte at T8-9 with some cord encroachment.
CXR (AP, [**3-1**]): In comparison with study of [**2-28**], diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist.
CXR ([**2130-3-6**])(one day after starting steroids): In comparison with study of [**2-4**], there has been a substantial decrease in the opacification in the left perihilar region as well as the upper and lower zones on the right.
TTE ([**2130-3-7**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
An eccentric, posterioly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-2-6**], the left ventricular function has significantly decreased with regional wall motion abnormality.
Rest Thallium ([**2130-3-10**]): Fixed moderate perfusion defect in the distal anterior, apical and lateral segments.
CHEST PORTABLE AP SEMI-UPRIGHT ([**2130-3-14**]):  The heart is not enlarged.
The bilateral diffuse opacities are still present in the upper lobes with the right side greater than the left.
Preliminary workup did not reveal acute ischemic coronary process and no ECG changes were noted.
EP was consulted and the cardiac arrest was thought secondary to ventricular arrhythmia since peri-code strips showed VT althought the source was unclear given no known structural heart disease, no prior history of MI, no CHF symptoms, QTc not significantly prolonged.
ISCHEMIA Cardiac catheterization was performed and revealed severe three vessel disease.
CT surgery was consulted and after evaluation determined he was not a candidate for CABG due to the severity of CAD and lack of targets for anastomosis; therefore his medical management was optimized wtih ACEI, BB, ASA, statin.
Possible intervention was revisited after his significant neurologic progress at which time a rest MIBI was perform to explore possible salvagable regions but the study demonstrated a fixed moderate perfusion defect in the distal anterior, apical and lateral segments; therefore medical management was recommended.
PULMONARY EDEMA Pt had some pulmoary edema seen on CXR as pulm congestion, echo initally demonstrated EF>55%, then a repeat echo demonstarted EF 35-40% with anterior hypokinesis of the anterior, anterolateral, mid to distal anteroseptum walls and akinesis of the apex.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mr. [**Known lastname 8071**] was initially intubated as part of the cooling protocol for cardiac arrest.
Video swallow evaluation revealed aspiration, and he underwent PEG placement on [**2130-2-21**].
A repeat speech and swallow evaluation performed on [**3-1**] recommended holding off PM valve evaluation and swallow evaluation until patient is on tracheostomy mask and secretions have decreased.
AMIODARONE INDUCED BOOP: On [**2130-2-27**], patient developed hematocrit drop.
CXR showed worsening alveolar infiltrates and bloody secretions were noted from his tracheostomy tube.
Interventional Pulmonology evaluated patient with a bronchoscopy and serial BALs showed progressive hemorrhage consistent with alveolar hemorrhage, thought likely due to combination of a pneumonia and anticoagulation.
His hematocrit stabilized on [**3-1**] and remained stable around 30 thereafter.
Pulmonary were consulted who thought thi was more consistent with amiodarone induced BOOP and steroid were started on [**2130-3-6**] which dramatic improvement overnight in symptoms and in findings on CXR with decrease in bilateral opacification.
Please follow-up with the PFT lab at [**Hospital1 **] for the time and place for this (requested 4 weeks from today) as well as a chest x-ray to check for resolution of the amio-induced BOOP.
T10 VERTEBRAL FRACTURE: The patient was noted to have fallen during his cardiac arrest, and abdominal CT revealed an abnormality of the T10 vertebrae.
MRI of the spine showed fracture of the superior endplate of T10 with gross disruption of the ALL without evidence of cord compression at T9-10.
LEFT DISTAL FIBULA FRACTURE: Ankle x-ray on [**2130-2-8**] revealed a subacute nondisplaced fracture of the distal left fibula, thought to have been sustained during the initial cardiac arrest and fall.
MENTAL STATUS Intially thought to have some level of anoxic brain injury given 30 minutes w/o spontaneous perfusion and GCS of 4 upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] but made tremendous advances and was alert and oriented x3, moving all extremities but with need for significant PT/rehab in recovery.
