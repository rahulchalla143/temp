She had a head CT and was found to have a 5mm L frontal subdural hematoma.
She was then transferred here for further evaluation of her subdural hematoma.
On arrival to the ED her vitals were, T97.4, BP 102/60, R 18, HR 60, O2Sat 96% Her PE was noted for no neurologic findings.
Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended repeating CT of Head in AM and frequent neuro checks.
Neck CT was done and showed no fracture or traumatic malalignment.
She also had CXR that showed 3.6 cm RLL pulmonary opacity/mass and patchy left costal phrenic angle opacity, that could represent atelectasis vs consolidation.
Her WBC 0.6 w/( N:20 Band:0 L:54 M:10 E:6 Bas:0 Atyps: 10), Hct 28.5, plts 212.
Bicarb at 19, creatine at 1.5 w/ BUN of 29 uncertain about her baseline.

If the clinical exam is suspicious for this entity, consider evaluation with MRI.
Would recommend comparison to previous imaging if available.
Otherwise, consider outpatient MRI or bone scan as clinically warranted.

Bacteremia:  Blood cultures drawn during the patient's hospitalization returned positive with high-grade enterococcal bacteremia and coagulase negative staph bacteremia.
TTE showed no vegetations; TEE was refused by patient, therefore, 6 week course was recommended with Day 1 [**10-3**] and Final Day [**11-14**].
Neurosurgery evaluated and recommended repeat head CT which showed normal progression of bleed; neurosurgery recommended follow-up in 4 weeks.
CXR demonstrated a RLL opacity felt to be most consistent with metastatic disease (seen on CXR at oncologists office).
After seven day course of former, this was stopped; neupogen was stopped after WBC normalized.
Hct of 28.5 on admission down to Hct of 22.3 by AM of [**10-3**].
Due to overall poor status and unclear relation to timing for chemo count nadir, transfused 1 unit PRBC on AM of [**10-3**] with post transfusion HCT of 27.0.
Magnesium  Oral 8.
For the head bleed, you have an appointment scheduled with the neurosurgeons to follow-up.
