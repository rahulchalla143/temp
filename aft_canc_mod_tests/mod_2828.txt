Admission Date:  [**2166-6-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-7-4**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**] Chief Complaint: Fall down stairs  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p C3-7 posterior laminectomies and fusion  History of Present Illness: 82year old man with a past medical history significant for cervical spondylosis, a.fib, and renal cell ca who presents [**6-15**] with a fall at home and C3-4 cord contusion (with baseline exam of plegic LUE, mild finger flexion in RUE, and could bend both knees against gravity), who is now 1day postop C3-7 laminectomies/fusion and was found this am by the nurses to be "unresponsive."
INR on arrival was 2.4, there was small SAH in right parietal lobe on arrival.
Medicine and cardiology consults were called for pre-op evals - recommended bp control (hydral and lopressor for sbp > 160, and aspirin post-op.
BP 178/76, hr 90, rr 22, afebrile.
Emergent head ct, labs, ecg were done.
Past Medical History: 1.a.fib, dilated cardiomyopathy 2.htn 3.left renal tumor found [**1-1**], likely renal cell carcinoma.
Planned for repeat MRI in [**8-1**].
4.bph s/p turp 5.right lung nodule - stable in size for over 2yrs 6.family reports history of "tortuous" carotid with episodes of syncope in past when he turned head to right- was on dilantin/phenobarbital per family.
Physical Exam: Tm 99.8; BP 122-184/46-70s; HR 74-90; RR 16-22; O2 sat 95-100% on 3L gen - lying in bed, no acute distress.
lungs - somewhat coarse bilaterally anteriorly with lots of upper airway sounds heart - irreg irreg, nl s1/s2 abd - soft, nt/nd, nabs ext - warm, 2+ peripheral pulses throughout.
grimaces to painful stimuli though not vigorously and face appears symmetric.
Sensation: minimal grimace/arousal to noxious in arms, triple flexion in legs  Coordination & Gait: unable to assess given mental status  Pertinent Results: wbc 12.6    hct 30.3   plt 158 pt 17.2   ptt 28.5   inr 2.0 Na 144  K 4.2  Cl 115  CO2 21  BUN 52  Cr 1.2  glucose 156 Ca 8.1  PO4 3.0  Mg 2.2 ALT 25 AST 29  Head CT ([**6-23**]): Remote infarcts in the mid right frontal lobe and in the right basal ganglia.
Ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent, consistent with mild brain atrophy, unchanged from prior study  CT C/T/L-spine: The vertebral body heights are preserved.
Focus of increased susceptibility in the left temporal lobe, which, in the absence of acute blood products on the CT of the same day, represents a site of old hemorrhage.
An MR head revealed new left MCA stroke.
Injuries s/p fall: In the ED, the pt's head CT showed focal linear hypodensity in R superior parietal region c/w small subdural hematoma (MRI head negative for ischemic event).
MRI C-spine showed increased signal C3-4 c/w cord contusion/edema, given dx of central cord syndrome, Coumadin d/ced, and pt was started on steroids in ED.
His EKG was negative for changes, cardiac enzymes negative.
Head CT without contrast was negative for bleed, though atrophy and old R frontal infarct, no acute pathology.
Differential dx at that time included ?embolic vs hemorrhagic CVA vs nonconvulsive seizures.
Neurology felt that pt may have likely had status epilepticus possibly from old R frontal infarct or alternatively, he may have suffered a new infarct related to his a.fib given his known afib and need to hold coumadin prior to surgery (although INR was 2.0 [**6-23**] AM).
On [**6-26**] pt's MR revealed new left MCA infarct.
On discharge his blood pressure was allowed to return to baseline of 120s-140s.
Throughout, he was unable to follow direct commands, was unable to communicate through vocal or non-vocal means, though occasionally he appeared to respond to his name and withdrew t painful stimuli in all extremities.
Respiratory Distress: On [**6-24**] at 9 pm, following onset of unresponsiveness, pt noted to have increased O2 requirement -ABG at that time 7.42/30/276, CXR with new RML and partial RLL collapse.
ABG 7.42/32/105, EKG with afib rate 102, new TWI V6, CXR with same changes as previous with ?RUL infiltrate, transferred to unit and intubated.
Placed on AC TV 600 x16 (actually breathing at 22), FIO2 100%, PEEP 5.
ABG at 2 am 7.42/27/238, lactate 1.4.
His Gram stain demonstrated 4 + GNR and 2+ GPC in chains and pair.
Sputum cultures ultimately grew out three different isolates of GNRs.
