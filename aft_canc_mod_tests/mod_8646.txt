CT abdomen/pelvis showed possible early diverticulitis.
An ID consult was called and they recommended rapid tapering of his steroids to his home dose, imaging of the L hip, a repeat CT abd/pelvis, a TTE to assess his murmur, and an ultrasound of a fluid pocket on the lateral side of his right knee.
The U/S of the L hip was negative for abscess, a CT on day of discharge on preliminary read showed no evidence of osteomyelitis or effusion.
A repeat CT of the abd/pelvis showed no evidence of diverticulitis.
In discussion with the renal attending, ID felt that a TTE could be considered as an outpatient.
Rheum was consulted and they performed an arthrocentesis which was positive for gout, but negative for septic arthritis.
Blood cultures showed no growth to date at time of discharge, CXR was negative, urine culture negative, stool cultures negative, and CMV VL negative.
His creatinine was 2.7 on admission and was stable until discharge, when it was at 2.9.
He was continued on his home dose of FK506 and Rappamune while his levels were monitored QD.
Rheumatology performed an arthrocentesis which returned wtih birefrigent intra and extra-cellular crystals.
