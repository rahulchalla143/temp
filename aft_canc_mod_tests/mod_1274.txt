Microbiology: GRAM STAIN (Final [**2137-4-19**]):       2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2137-4-21**]):       OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA ABSENT.
On presentation to ED, oxygen saturations were 92 % on undetermined amount of supplemental O2.
Because of her history of pseudomonal pneumonia, she was empirically treated with ceftaz and when her sputum cultures grew pseudomonas, inhaled tobramycin was added to her antibiotic regimen.
Her symptoms and exam improved over the course of her stay.
This is a condition that has complicated her previous hospital stays and workup in the past including EKG and CTA have been unrevealing.
Her respiratory dysfunction could be causing this mild tachycardia so would reccommend to monitor this condition and look for improvement as her respiratory function improves.
