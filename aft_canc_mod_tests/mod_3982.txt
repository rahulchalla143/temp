[**2142-12-2**] 04:02PM BLOOD Lactate-2.5*  [**12-2**] Chest CTA: 1.
[**12-2**] CT head: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or acute infarction, within the limitations of recent contrast administration, limiting the evaluation of small masses or hemorrhage.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-7-25**], a small atrial septal defect is not identified on the current study (may be due to technical issues and better visualized by TEE).
[**12-4**]: Lymph node biopsy POSITIVE FOR SMALL CELL CARCINOMA.
Micro:  RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2142-12-5**]):  MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
# PE: In the ED, her Temp was 101.5, HR 95, RR 24 and 91% on RA.
She received nebs with "improved" oxygenation to 93% on 3L and RR decreased to 18.
CTA was done which showed left segmental PE and right hilar mass with possible RLL post-obstructive pneumonia.
LENIs were done which showed RLE DVT.
# Pneumonia/COPD: Patient found to have obstructive PNA on CTA chest on admission.
Chest CTA performed in the ED showed hilar mass.
She underwent bronchoscopy with tumor debreidment and stenting to her bronchus intermedius and had a biopsy which eventually showed small cell carcinoma.
PET scan was done as an outpatient and showed likely lesion in acetabulum.
A baseline CEA was found to be elevated at 52.
# Leukocytosis: The patient had a WBC count of 21.3 on admission.
Her TSH was elevated at 11 and her free T4 was 1.3.
# A fib: The patient's EKG showed normal sinus rhythm.
# Anemia: The patient was found to have a Hct 30.3.
Fe studdies showed decreased TIBC (183), but Ferretin and Fe were WNL.
