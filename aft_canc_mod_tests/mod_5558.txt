On exam after intubation, his CN were intact, and motor/sensory exam shows some assymmetries (extension LUE).
MRI showed an intra-parenchymal hemorrhage within the left temporal lobe which demonstrated surrounding edema suspicious for an underlying mass.
Blood pressure was controlled with IV labetolol as needed and he was extubated without complications.
He went for stereotactic brain biopsy on [**2144-11-12**] without complication.
CV: Cycled enzymes which were negative and monitored on caridac telemetry without events.
EKG unchanged.
Patient had CT guided biopsy on [**11-10**] and developed an asymptomatic small left pneumothorax that was followed with serial chest x-rays and treated with O2 nasal cannula.
Pathology was pending at time of discharge.
Of note, pelvic CT on [**11-6**] noted an enlarged prostate with lobulated appearance, more prominent on the right, it measures 7.1 x 5.6 cm in axial dimension.
Which will likely need to be monitored and further evaluated as an outpatient.
He passed a speech and swallow evaluation and was put on a regular diet.
