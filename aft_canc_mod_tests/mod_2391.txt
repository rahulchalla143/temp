GRAM STAIN (Final [**2127-3-21**]):       [**10-26**] PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):       ?
CXR [**2127-3-18**] IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions with question of mild superimposed edema.
Please note the previous imaging to document the reported pneumonia is not available at this time.
On admission the pt didn't have any evidence of pneumonia (she had recently completed a course of antibiotics for nosocomial pneumonia), and PE seemed unlikely as the pt had been on subcutaneous heparin at rehab and her oxygenation improved with intubation.
The pt's chest xray did show mild pulmonary edema and effusions, so the pt was diuresed with IV lasix, which she tolerated well.
The pt's sputum culture grew out gram + cocci in pairs and clusters.
# Anemia: Baseline Hct low 30s, however was 24 on recent discharge, currently stable at 28.
# Cardiovascular:  No documented h/o CAD, however has known PVD and also with q-waves on EKG which indicates a prior event.
EKG is unchanged here.
As seen in "results" section cardiac enzymes were cycled and trended down, elevation was likely demand in the setting of hypoxia.
The ultrasound showed a non-occlusive thrombus in the left axillary vein.
