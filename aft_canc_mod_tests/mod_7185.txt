Bone scan may be obtained for further evaluation as clinically warranted.
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: In the ED, patient underwent bedside ultrasound that did not demonstrate any ascites amenable to bedside paracentesis.
Abd CT showed diffuse small bowel dilatation with no evidence of obstruction or free air.
She was also noted to be pancytopenic with a hematocrit of 22, baseline unknown.
For bordeline hypotension of systolic of 95, patient was given 2 litres normal saline.
Head CT was performed given mental status changes and was unremarkable.
She was admitted to MICU for further monitoring of mental status, and borderline hypotension.
She had a RUQ ultrasound that did not show cirrhosis, or cholecystitis.
Stool cultures were collected to evaluate for c.diff.
An NGT was placed, which did not provide the patient relief, drained a total of 600cc of yellow fluid.
Her abdomen became increasingly distended, and she had a new O2 requirement and her tachycardia increased from 110 to 140's, sinus.
An ABG was done that was unremarkable, a CXR showed hazyness at the right base.
Surgery was consulted and they recommended a CTA chest and CT abdomen.
Her chest CTA showed a large right sided pleural effusion, no PE and her CT abdomen was unchanged.
A repeat ABG showed an increased lactate to 2.2.
She had a left salpingo-oophorectomy, [**Last Name (un) **] gastrostomy tube placement, and placement of a vacuum dressing since her abdomen was unable to be closed.
