Her initial liver function tests include AST 938, ALT 555, alkaline phosphatase 549, total bilirubin 14.
She was also noted to have compromised pulmonary function tests with FEV1 of 1.0 related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease secondary to smoking.
This improved to an FEV1 of 1.4 on bronchodilators and with discontinuation of smoking.
An echocardiogram demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional left ventricular dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
A sestamibi stress test demonstrated normal myocardial perfusion and left ventricular ejection fraction was 48%.
The stress portion demonstrated no anginal symptoms or additional ST-segment changes from baseline.
With drainage, her liver function tests improved and most recently include AST 27, ALT 19, alkaline phosphatase 92, total bilirubin 1.4, albumin 3.9.

The areas of suspected nodularity seen on the previous AP view are not definitely appreciated at this time.
Throughout her admission she was occasionally hypertensive to SBPs in the 190s, for which she received hydralazine prn, and was continued on her home verapamil SR. On discharge her blood pressure was at its baseline, in the 160s/60s.
She underwent a tube cholangiogram on POD5, which showed a patent anastamosis.
Her JP output gradually decreased post-operatively, and it was pulled on POD6 on the day of discharge when output had decreased to <20 cc/day.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
