Unfortunately, in [**2147-1-28**] the patient began to experience a hematologic relapse with a rise in her WBC to 9.4 and atypical lymphs on a CBC from [**2148-2-9**].
Her LDH had peaked in the 1300-1600 range and then she went on to receive CHOP w/ Denileukin diftitox on [**2148-2-26**].
This led to a response with her LDH dropping to 199 and cytopenias ensuing.
She had a repeat chest CT on [**2148-4-9**] that showed increased lymphadenopahthy.

OTHER RESULTS =============== Chest Radiograph [**2148-4-18**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
CT Chest W/Contrast [**2148-4-9**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis W/Contrast [**2148-4-18**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2148-4-18**]: IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF 45%), c/w CAD.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-6-3**], regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is more evident because of a technically-better study.
ECG [**2148-4-21**]: Baseline artifact.
ECG [**2148-4-22**]: Probable sinus tachycardia.
Chest Radiograph [**2148-4-22**]: IMPRESSION: Findings still suggest pulmonary edema, less likely widespread hemorrhage.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2148-4-23**]: IMPRESSION: Moderate regional and global left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF 30%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-4-23**], LV systolic function has deteriorated.
Right ventricular systolic function has declined.
Abdominal Radiograph [**2148-4-23**]: IMPRESSION: Unremarkable bowel gas pattern  Abdominal Radiograph [**5-23**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**5-23**] REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Acute tachypnea, recent intubation.
After obtaining an echocardiogram to assess her baseline cardiac function and ejection fraction chemotherapy with the [**Hospital1 **] regimen was started late in the evening of [**2148-4-19**].
Unfortunately, [**Hospital1 **] was stopped on [**2148-4-21**] during an episode of acute respiratory distress and was not restarted given concern for incremental cardiotoxcity from the anthracycline.
Neurology was consulted regarding her recent treatment with ARA-G.  She had a non-contrast head CT which did not show evidence of acute process.
She also had an LP which did not show evidence of infection or malignant process.
Her uric acid peaked at 8.8 and did not require rasburicase, however it was considered.
She was also becoming increasingly tachypneic, breathing at a rate in the 40s but satting 95% on 3L.
An abdominal x-ray prelim read showed no evidence of free air, no air-fluid levels, only a large air-filled stomach.
A NGT was placed, and subsequent Xray showed complete decompression of the stomach.
At admission an echocardiogram was obtained that showed an EF of 45% and a local wall motion defect consistent with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Chest rardiograph revealed acute pulmonary edema and so she received 40 mg IV furosemide and had 0.5 inch nitro paste placed.
ABG revealed 7.22/62/74 so she was transferred to the ICU for non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP).
Her cardiac enzymes returned with mildly positive troponin (0.37) and negative ck-mb (tropnonin steadily declined afterward and CK-MB never came out of normal range.
Cardiology consult thought this was most likely due to demand ischemia and heart failure (BNP was 18,063) rather than acute ischemia.
Repeat echocardiogram showed diffuse hypokinesis and a decreased EF to 30%.
She was eventually transitioned to long acting ACEi in order to address dosing concerns with her marginal BP's, but was not continued as the patient's blood pressure was marginal.
On [**5-23**], despite a negative fluid balance during the day, she had an acute episode of dyspnea characterized by labored breathing, clear lungs, and desaturations that did not improve with nebs/O2 mask.
An ABG revealed a metabolic acidosis (lactate 13) with compensating respiratory alkalosis(CO2 21).
Cultures grew coagulase negative staph while she was in the unit.
Meropenem was stopped the following day but vancomycin was continued given the patient's blood culture came back positive and she had an indwelling port for chemotherapy.
In an attempt to preserve the port, the decision was made to try and treat through the infection so surveillance cultures were taken for the following days.
Culture from [**2148-4-23**] did also grow coagulase negative staph but all other cultures returned negative for growth.
A CXR was done which showed evidence of infiltrate, a follow up Chest CT showed ground glass opacities on the left side.
After her treatment with ARA-G, the patient's fever curve decreased, then increased at day 12 of the treatment.
Abdominal exam revealed distension and tenderness but good bowel sounds.
Dermatology was consulted and did a skin biopsy which showed likely hypersensitivity reaction.
Lymphoma involvement of the skin was considered, but the pathology showed intraepidermal lymphocytes, mounded parakeratosis, dermal erythrocyte extravasation, and superficial perivascular lymphocytic inflammation with scattered interstitial eosinophils consistent with hypersensitivity reaction.
