In the ED his temp was 102, HR 100-120's, BP 160-180's, RR 26-34, satting 95% on NRB.
A Chest CT revealed a large left pleural effusion and LLL/lingular/portions of LUL collapse (worsened significantly compared to [**2168-10-22**]).
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was noted to have a RR of 40 with a gas of 7.47/32/68.

Studies: - CT chest [**2168-11-16**]: 1.
Lytic foci within the T1 vertebral body and right fifth rib are unchanged.
- CXR [**2168-11-16**]: Interval increased left pleural effusion, and increasing parenchymal opacities in left lower lobe and lingula.
- PET CT scan: 1.
- Chest CT [**2168-10-22**]: bulky, bilateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well as bilateral hilar adenopathy, the largest lymph nodes include a subcarinal node or mass measuring approximately 2.5 cm x 3.5 cm in diameter.
CT chest revealed a large left pleural effusion and collapse of left lower lobe, lingula and portions of the left upper lobe.
Bronchial washings, subcarinal mass, and paratracheal lymph node obtained on [**11-19**] were again consistent with malignancy.
Repeated blood, sputum, and urine cultures did not identify etiology of infection; viral screen also negative.
Patient became hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis, and required pressors and fluid boluses to maintain his CVP and urine output.
