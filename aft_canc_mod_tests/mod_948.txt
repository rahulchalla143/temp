CT ABD/PELVIS IMPRESSION: 1.
Small upper abdominal fluid collections in the gastrohepatic and gastrosplenic space are significantly smaller than prior study, nearly resolved.
He had an extensive surgical history concerning for SBO, but KUB did not show air-fluid leves, and CT was negative for strangulatation of his ventral hernia, and his lactate was normal.
His RUQ US was also negative for acute cholecytitis: he may have had transient choledocholithiasis with a passed stone, as small subcentimeter stones and GB sludge were noted on U/S, and he  transiently elevated AP and LDH that decreased over 24 hours while in the ICU.
His CT showed no evidence of abdominal abscess.
His CXR showed no evidence of PNA.
His stool was sent for C. difficile toxin assay, but not enough stool was present for proper quantification.
His blood, urine, and stool cx's o/w showed no growth at the time of discharge.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia, no evidence of arrhythmias.
It was supplemented with IV dilaudid for now as he had abdominal pain, which was tapered off prior to discharge.
