Her workup included bone marrow biopsies, echo, CT, hematology consultation.
She was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and nodules on CT chest, negative for PE.
She was also found to be anemic and thrombocytopenic with HCT in the high 20s and platelets in the low 100s, new since [**3-12**].
Blood cultures were postive for pseudomonas and ECHO negative for endocarditis.
CT continued to show lung nodules and LUL infiltrated.
Recieved zosyn, gentamycin, vancomycin, amikacin and linezolid and had persistent thrombocytopenia and anemia in spite of multiple blood transfusions.
She was discharged from that admission with hematocrit of 24-31.
Then in [**Month (only) **] was still thrombocytopenic with plt 90s, and anemic with Hct of 24-27.

[**7-22**] Echo: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-7-20**], left ventricular systolic function has significantly deteriorated, and severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation is greater.
She has had three sets of cardiac enzymes (trop 0.01 --> 0.61 --> 0.48; CK 36 --> 50 --> 50), and she was seen by cardiology.
On morning of [**7-22**], she was hypotensive to SBP low 70s.
En route, she also received a blood transfusion for HCT 24.
CXR and exam c/w pulm edema.
Pain was controlled.
CVP was [**2-7**] and SvO2 was 67 which suggested primary cardiogenic shock less likely.
We resuscitated with approx 2L IVF and were able to wean neo almost completely off with improvement in BP and CVP.
We planned for CT abd soon.
After 3 shocks, epi, amio, HCO3 -> BP and HR returned after approx 25m.
Causes of death: VT arrest - immed NSTEMI - days Lymphoma - weeks also, consider infectious etiology or unrecognized bleed.
