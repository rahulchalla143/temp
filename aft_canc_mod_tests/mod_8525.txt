After receiving a CT scan for the PNA, she was found to have a pericardial effusion that was evaluated by ultrasound.
She received a pericardial window for cardiac tamponade presumably from a malignant effusion, as well as a bronchoscopy which took several transbronchial biopsies.
She was transferred to the oncology floor after her initial pathology results showed malignant cells c/w adenocarcinoma.
# Malignancy adenocarcinoma: CT showed that since [**2178-7-6**], her left lower lobe consolidation has significantly progressed with unchanged bulk of the bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes; interlobular interstitial septal thickening in left lower lobe persists.
After pathology from her bronchoscopy (lymph node and LLL mass Bx's) were positive for malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma, heme-onc was consulted and she was transferred to the oncology floor.
# Pericardial effusion: CT thorax showed evidence of pericardial effusion.
Pt c/o SOB, and TTE showed evidence of tamponade physiology.
Repeat TTE showed evidence of returned pericardial effusion with evidence of loculation and tamponade physiology.
Pericardial window was performed on [**8-19**].
After call-out to the cardiology floor, her chest tube drainage decreased and the tube was removed on [**8-25**].
Repeat CXR's continued to show stable effusions.
The pt c/o constant dyspnea and was maintained on several L of O2 with sats in the mid-90's; she was started on low doses of morphine to treat dyspnea and air hunger on [**8-24**], which gave her significant symptomatic improvement.
# Pneumonia:  She likely had a post-obstructive pneumonia due to the lung mass seen on CT chest one month ago.
A repeat CT chest was performed and showed the mass was amenable to bronchoscopic biopsy.
Pulmonology was consulted and performed a biopsy and bronchoscopy with washings sent for cultures.
She was treated with cefepime and metronidazole for 10 days each for concern for anaerobes and resistant gram negatives.
Her cough and lung exam initially improved, but on [**8-24**] her dyspnea increased, she had persisting opacities on CXR and slowly increasing WBC, and so zosyn, and levofloxacin were started.
Patient was symptomatic during RVR episodes with dyspnea, with systolic blood pressures 90-100s (baseline SBP appears to be 100s-120s).
TSH was normal.
During her stay on the cardiology floor, she remained in sinus rhythm with HR in 70-80's.
# Normocytic Anemia: Hct was in low 30's during admission (recent baseline 30-35), MCV 85, RDW 13.
The patient is also to have an echo done as an outpatient.

A bronchoscopy was performed to evaluate this mass, and the results of the biopsy showed adenocarcinoma.
