The patient was recently diagnosed with a UTI on [**11-28**] and was given ciprofloxacin for a seven day course as well as Vicodin for worsening back pain.
In the ED, the patient was noted to be hyperkalemic with a K of 7.2 and hypercalcemic with a calcium of 13.2 as well as to be in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 7.5.
Multiple myeloma was complicated by multiple osteolytic metastases including ORIF of the right femur pathologic fracture in [**2173**], upper extremity bilateral osteolytic metastases, radiation treatment to bilateral hips in [**2173**], compression fractures of T12, T8, L1 through L4, right 7th rib fracture, left 5th posterior rib fracture, and soft tissue mass of the right chest wall, also complicated by hypercalcemia on chronic diphosphonate treatment, as well as chronic renal insufficiency.
PHYSICAL EXAM AT ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.3, blood pressure 137/56, pulse 84, respiratory rate 20, and sating 92% on 4 liters.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  White count of 7.2, hematocrit 30.6, from baseline of 34.4, platelets of 89 down from baseline of 162.
Chem-7:  Sodium 129, potassium 7.2, chloride 97, bicarb 12, BUN 69, and creatinine 7.5, glucose 116, anion gap 20, calcium 13.2 with an albumin of 3.7, magnesium 2.4, phosphorus 7.6.
Klebsiella 10-100,000.
L spine showed multiple compression fractures:  T12, L1, L2-L4 with progression of the L spine fractures.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral perihilar haziness, pulmonary vascular distribution, unchanged chest wall mass, left posterior rib fracture, and pulmonary edema.
Hyperkalemia:  Patient was treated with sodium bicarb, insulin, glucose, Kayexalate and albuterol with excellent response as the K came down to 5.7.
An echocardiogram was performed showing moderate left atrial dilation, mild right atrial dilation, EF of 55%, [**2-15**]+ MR, 2+ TR.
Coag-negative Staph bacteremia:  Although patient remained afebrile, blood cultures were checked and revealed 4/4 bottles positive for coag-negative Staph.
The right IJ was removed, and tip sent for culture, which also grew out coag-negative Staph.
Blood cultures continued to be positive, however, and therefore the left hemodialysis catheter was removed.
Following the removal of this catheter, blood cultures remained negative for 48 hours.
Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit was down from her baseline at admission and continued to trend downward going as low as 22.5 on [**12-6**] from 34.4 at admission.
Hemolysis laboratories were unrevealing as well as peripheral smear.
The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells and hematocrit remained stable thereafter.
Stable vital signs, had baseline mental status, afebrile with negative blood cultures on hemodialysis.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14069**] in [**2-15**] weeks, and to followup with the Renal team as directed.
Of note, the patient did receive a number of additional studies including a MRI of the head which revealed no brain metastases, however, osteolytic lesions were found of the calvarium as well as a CT of the abdomen with and without contrast which revealed three lesions on the liver suspicious for metastatic disease.
