He was found to have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (though CXR was limited by position).
# Abdominal Pain: etiologies of abdominal pain and distention include ischemic bowel vs obstruction vs peritonitis.
# Acute kidney injury: On admission Cr 4.5 up from baseline 0.8 and related to hypotension from acute blood loss and sepsis.
EKG showed persistent peaked t waves despite these interventions.
#Metabolic Acidosis: ABG 6.83/28/248, secondary to hypovolemic and septic shock.
#Coagulopathy: labs on admission remarkable for INR 5.4, PT 53.9, PTT 79.3.
#Metastatic rectal neuroendocrine adenocarcinoma:  no plan for further chemotherapy according to primary oncologist.
