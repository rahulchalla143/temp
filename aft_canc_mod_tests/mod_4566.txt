On the day of admission, he came in for a scheduled CT scan for staging.
In the emergency department, his initial vitals were T 95.4, BP 80/62, HR 165, RR 35, 92% on RA to 98% on 4L.
ECG was interpreted as sinus tachycardia.
He received 3L IVF with improvement of BP to 90-100s.
Out of concern for PE, head CT was performed to rule out brain mets (negative), and he was guaiac negative.
Given persistently elevated HR, he was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
HR initially in the 140s with SBP in the 100s.
Received lopressor 5mg IV x 2 and converted to sinus with HR in the 80s and BP in the 100-110s.
JVP at clavicle.

Note that CT has limited sensitivity for detection of metastasis and MR can be obtained as clinically indicated.
There was originally concern for PE in setting of malignancy; a head CT was done (initial read showing no mets) and patient was guiac negative so a heparin ggt was started.
He will need a TTE as an outpatient, and can make an appointment upon discharge.
BP improved with IVF and normalization of heart rate.
However, there was no left shift or localizing signs of infection, and WBC count went down to 8.4 on second hospital day.
