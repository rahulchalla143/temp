ECG [**2121-2-28**]: Atrial fibrillation.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2121-2-24**].
Portable CXR [**2121-2-28**]: IMPRESSION: Nearly nondiagnostic study due to respiratory motion and artifacts projecting over the right hemithorax.
ECG [**2121-3-1**]: Atrial fibrillation.
Portable CXR [**2121-3-1**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Portable CXR [**2121-3-2**]: There is a left retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.
Portable CXR [**2121-3-2**]: IMPRESSION: Increased cardiogenic edema.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were negative and her MRSA screen was negative.
She underwent speech and swallow evaluation given concern for possible aspiration, but was cleared for thin liquids and regular-consistency food (this study was done on hospital day 3 when she was more alert than on admission).
Treatment was aimed at underlying infection, hypoxia and electrolyte imbalances with apparent improvement in MS.  # Fever: To 103 rectally in ED per report.
Lactate remained WNL, and WBC was not elevated.
# CHF: The patient has known CHF with LVEF of 25% and 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 28753**]o.
Given her recent admission [**Date range (1) 95167**] for presumed CHF exacerbation, it is likely that some degree of volume overload contributed to her symptoms of hypoxia.
INR was subtherapeutic but Coumadin was held given concern that antibiotics may augment these levels.
Metoprolol and digoxin were continued; Coumadin was ultimately restarted and her INR was 1.8 on last check.
Creatinine was trended daily.
# Coronary artery disease: EKG stable, elevated trop (at baseline) likely related to CRF.
Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) 50,000 unit 1x/week 5.
Multivitamin,Tx-Minerals 1 tab daily 8.
Mucinex 600mg [**Hospital1 **] x 7 days (planned to start [**2121-3-1**]) 20.
