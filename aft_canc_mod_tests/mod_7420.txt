He was noted to be orthostatic at that time with BP 140/100 HR 83 supine and 110/70 HR 113 standing.
He was referred to the ED, where initial vital signs were: 97.9, 102, 140/86, 20, 100ra.
Hct was 39.6 which is marginally down from his baseline of 40-42.
Of note, he was seen by his PCP & ortho the week preceding for what seems to have been a hemarthrosis judging by a fluid Hct of 29, but the improvement in his knee pain seems a bit more brisk than I would have expected for that condition--states his knee pain is now minimal.
