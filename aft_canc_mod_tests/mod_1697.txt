The patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in the Fall of [**2143**] when a bone marrow biopsy revealed myeloma with hypercellular marrow with 66 percent plasma cells.
IgA level was at 4910 at that time.
He did well for approximately for one year until decrease of [**2145**] when his IgG levels rose.
A bone marrow biopsy and aspirate on day plus 30 showed extensive involvement by plasma cell myeloma.
A repeat computer tomography of the chest was obtained which revealed a linear opacity in the right middle lobe that was felt to be either focal atelectasis versus focal pneumonia as well as an increased size of pleural-based soft tissue lesions.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the oropharynx was red.
The chest revealed no tenderness to palpation over the sternum or the anterior ribs.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 3.1, his hematocrit was 27.7, and his platelets were 88.
His blood urea nitrogen was 18.
His creatinine was 1.3.
Alanine-aminotransferase was 23, his aspartate aminotransferase was 24, his lactate dehydrogenase was 337, his alkaline phosphatase was 206, his total bilirubin was 1.2, with an indirect bilirubin was 0.9.
Cytomegalovirus viral load from [**5-29**] not detected.
An echocardiogram from [**2147-5-22**] revealed left atrium and right atrium moderately dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function was low-normal.
Ejection fraction of 50 percent to 75 percent.
On [**2147-6-5**], the patient had a repeat computed tomography scan of the chest which showed an interval decrease in the right middle lobe infiltrate with no new consolidations.
ACID BASE ISSUES:  As the patient was tachypneic, and it was noted that his bicarbonate was low at 14 to 18, a blood gas was performed.
The suspicion for a pulmonary embolism was low given his pO2 of 100 on room air, and a computed tomography angiogram of the chest was undesirable given the patient's increased creatinine, and a V/Q scan would not be a good study given the soft lesions.
Lower extremity noninvasives were performed, and they were negative.
A magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed no cerebrovascular accident or evidence of basilar meningitis.
A lumbar puncture was performed to explore the potential of a central nervous system infection or an infiltration by his myeloma given this respiratory alkalosis as well as due to new onset somnolence (as will be described below).
The lumbar puncture did reveal 150 white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid with a normal glucose and protein.
As discussed above, a lumbar puncture was performed due to the concern of a central process causing tachypnea as well as somnolence.
A swallow study was performed which revealed major deficits in swallowing, putting the patient at very high risk for aspiration of even his own secretions.
Repeated magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans of the base of the skull revealed no evidence for lesions compressing the cranial nerves.
There were plans for a repeat lumbar puncture; however, this was held off due to the fact that the patient had a soft tissue lesion located at L3, and there was concern for seeding of the cerebrospinal fluid or for getting a false-positive result on the lumbar puncture.
He underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy which was normal.
However, biopsies revealed evidence of graft-versus-host disease.
BACK PAIN ISSUES:  The patient with baseline back pain on admission; however, it became more and more severe leading to a magnetic resonance imaging of the spine which revealed metastatic disease in all visualized bones with soft tissue masses at T10-T11 and C11 with collapse of T7, and soft tissue masses at L3, but no cord compression, as well as a questionable pathologic fracture of the coccyx and sacrum.
ASPIRATION ISSUES:  The patient's pulmonary status remained relatively stable after the resolution of the issues described above; however, his lung examination started to sound worse around [**6-15**] to [**6-20**].
In the setting of the rapid ventricular rate and the high risk for aspiration, it was felt that an aspiration pneumonia could be contributing so he was started on a course of Levaquin and Flagyl.
PANCREATITIS ISSUES:  Due to abdominal pain, the patient's amylase and lipase were checked - which were found to be elevated.
ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  After the hypotension following his first episode of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate, a cortisol stimulation test was performed.
