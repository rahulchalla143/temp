The GI team scheduled him for a repeat EGD and colonoscopy on [**2105-6-24**].
RUL Opacity on CXR This radiologic finding had been unchanged since [**2105-2-24**]; the patient underwent a chest CT for further evaluation which showed an increased RUL opacity but additionally new lucencies in the thoracic spine which were read as lytic lesions.
