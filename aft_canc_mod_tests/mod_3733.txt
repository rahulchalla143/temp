CXR [**1-8**] Interval resolution of a previously seen left upper lobe opacity, compatible with resolved aspiration pneumonitis given the rapid time course.
EGD Reports: [**1-4**] Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
A fungating and ulcerated 1 cm mass with stigmata of recent bleeding of malignant appearance was found at the antrum.
A single-piece polypectomy was performed using a hot snare and both the polyps were removed.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 year old woman with mechanical St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mitral valve, tricuspid valve replacement ([**Doctor First Name 7624**] ring), atrial fibrillation on coumadin and aspirin presenting with melana in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR and new diagnosis of antral gastric polyps.
Serial hematocrits were checked, and hematocrit remained stable at 32-34.
Patient had central line placed for access, which was removed once her hematocrit remained stable.
She was subsequently called out to the medical floor: EGD and EUS revealed 2 antral gastric polyps removed via endoscopic polypetomy.
Pathology of polyps showed granulation tissue and inflammation, but no evidence of adenocarcinoma.
Her hematocrit remained stable  (38-40) for latter five days of her hospitalization.
Goal INR 2.5-3.5 but wanted reversible anticoagulation for required diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
Once all GI endoscopic and colonoscopy procedures were completed, heparin gtt bridge was restarted and she was transitioned back to coumadin (goal INR 2.5-3.5) prior to discharge.
Her final day of discharge, her INR was 3.0.
Repeat CXR 24 hours later showed resolution of opacity, consistent with aspiration pneumonitis.
Repeat leukocytosis occurred a few days later, repeat CXR showed no acute process.
All blood and urine cultures were negative to date.
