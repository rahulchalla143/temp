Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**6-11**] performed at [**Hospital1 69**] showed an intraductal mass, and plastic stent placed.
The mass was brushed and cells were sent to cytology which were positive for adenocarcinoma.
Creatinine in [**2163-12-24**] was noted to be 0.9.
Then on [**6-5**], creatinine was noted to be 2 after a computed tomography scan at the outside hospital.
On admission to the hospital on [**6-11**], creatinine was noted to be 8.1.
His blood pressure did not increase, and the patient began to experience shortness of breath.
An arterial blood gas was taken and showed a pH of 7.41, a PCO2 of 28, and a PO2 of 72.
Once the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, his blood pressures dropped to the 60s.
A right internal jugular was placed, and the patient was started on Levophed.
Fresh frozen plasma was given prior to line placement as the patient's INR was 1.7.
A catheterization performed in [**2162-5-23**] showed no significant coronary artery disease.
An echocardiogram performed in [**2162-5-23**] showed diastolic dysfunction without systolic dysfunction and left atrial enlargement.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination on admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit revealed vital signs of 93/29, heart rate was 83, respiratory rate was 10, and oxygen saturation was 96% oxygen saturation on 4 liters nasal cannula.
Temperature was 95.8 (hypothermic).
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Chest examination revealed crackles at the bases bilaterally/anteriorly.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Extremity examination revealed no edema.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit revealed white blood cell count was 7 (down from 10.2), hematocrit was 28.6, and platelets were 90.
Prothrombin time was 15.9, partial thromboplastin time was 37.1, and INR was 1.7.
Urinalysis revealed brown/cloudy.
Specific gravity was 1.016, large blood, 100 protein, moderate bilirubin, trace leukocytes, greater than 50 red blood cells, 6 to 10 white blood cells, few bacteria, and amorphous crystals.
Sodium was 137, potassium was 4.5, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 16, blood urea nitrogen was 86, creatinine was 7.9, and blood glucose was 105.
Lipase was 72 and amylase was 25.
Calcium was 7.8, phosphate was 6.9, and magnesium was 2.1.
Albumin was 3.
ALT was 47, AST was 82, total bilirubin was 27.2, and alkaline phosphatase was 145.
Microscopic examination from ascites taken from [**6-13**] revealed no growth, no polymorphonuclear leukocytes, no organisms seen on Gram stain, 55 white blood cells, and 3045 red blood cells.
Brush on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography taken from [**6-11**] was positive for malignancy cells adenocarcinoma.
Urine cultures from [**6-12**] and [**6-13**] revealed no growth.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING PERFORMED AT [**Hospital1 **]:  1.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography performed on [**6-11**] revealed intraductal mass, stent placed.
Abdominal ultrasound on [**6-12**] revealed sludge in the gallbladder, negative [**Doctor Last Name **] sign, liver shrunken with increased echogenicity, enlarged spleen, and portal vein was patent.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen performed on [**6-11**] (although limited by the patient's claustrophobia), revealed massive ascites, left greater than right small bilateral pleural effusions, liver nodularity (consistent with cirrhosis), 3.6-cm X 4.8-cm mass with increased signal in segment 4A liver, spleen mildly enlarged, varices along the stomach (portal hypertension), gallbladder with no stones and no ductal dilatation.
A chest x-ray on [**6-14**] revealed right internal jugular in place and pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   In summary, the patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with diabetes, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular accident who presented with painless jaundice and a 55-pound weight loss, status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent, now with cirrhosis and acute renal failure and probable cholangiocarcinoma.
Mean arterial pressure remained in the 50s to 60s, and the patient mentated well throughout his hospital course in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Hypotension was most likely secondary to sepsis.
The patient's pulmonary status was monitored closely while receiving fluid boluses for blood pressure so as to prevent a flare of pulmonary edema.
Mild congestive heart failure was seen on chest x-ray on [**6-11**].
The patient received an echocardiogram on [**6-15**] which revealed an ejection fraction of 75% to 80%; although the patient was on Levophed at the time of this echocardiogram.
The patient's treatment options and prognosis were discussed at length with the patient and his family.
Total bilirubin and liver function tests were checked daily to assess for obstruction.
If these values were to increase significantly, could possibly replace stent with a more permanent stent via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to relieve obstruction.
Total bilirubin tended to decrease throughout his hospital stay.
Fractional excretion of sodium was 1%.
Cultures were negative or pending to date.
Blood cultures from [**6-15**] were pending.
Urine cultures from [**6-12**] and [**6-13**] showed no growth.
The patient received two units of packed red blood cells while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for a hematocrit of less than 30.
The patient and the patient's family expressed a wish to not be started on pressors if the patient's blood pressure were to fall.
