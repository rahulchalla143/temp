As part of his ED workup, he was also noted to have an abnormal CXR, not further specified, but work-up was not pursued at the time, as Mr. [**Known lastname 81483**] was transferred immediately to [**Hospital1 18**] to the neurosurgery team.
He was to be discharged today ([**11-29**]), when follow-up CXR to the OSH note was completed and revealed >30 discrete pulmonary nodules throughout the entire lungs, ranging in size from several millimeters to > 2.5cm.
CT imaging after transfer to the medical team was consistent with metastatic disease throughout the body, including lesions in the liver, retroperitoneum, lungs, and ascending colon.

Head CT [**11-28**]:IMPRESSION: Stable left frontal and left frontoparietal subdural hematomas.
Multiple radiopaque objects are projecting over the upper thorax and the right chest and are consistent with prior gunshot injury.
Further comparison with prior radiographs and/or crossectional imaging are crucial with the decision of further evaluation based on the results.
CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS: CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Innumerable pulmonary nodules and masses are detected throughout the lungs, most predominant at the lung bases.
No axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymph nodes are present for CT size criteria; however, there is a prominent conglomerate of lymph nodes within the pretracheal region, the largest measuring 9 mm in short axis.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The rectum and sigmoid colon demonstrate fecal material within.
Direct visualization with colonoscopy and biopsy is recommended.
The patient was initiated on continue seizure prophylaxis and should be continued on this medication pending an outpatient Brain MRI for evaluation of possible metastates to the Brain.
The patient will require a follow up head CT in 8 weeks and an appointment with neurosurgery.
Theses nodules most likely represent metastatic colon cancer based on CT imaging.
The CT scan also revealed nodules in the liver and enlarged lymph nodes.
THe patient's CEA was elevated at 2319.
The patient preferred to be discharged and have the remainer of the malignancy workup done as an outpatient.
We recommend that the patient have a colonoscopy, possibly a liver biopsy and an MRI of the brain to further evaluate the origin and extent of this malignancy.
An infectious process is still on the differential but less likely due to lack of signs or symptoms.
The patient's Hct was 30.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
# Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient's creatinine was elevated at 1.3.
His baseline Creatinine is unknown.
His Creatinine did not improve with fluid hydration.
Recommend oupatient evaluation of kidney function.
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day).
Your doctor will need to check the levels of this medication in approximately 1 weeks time and he will tell you if you need to continue the medication after that date.
While an inpatient, you had a chest x-ray which showed multiple nodules in your lungs.
A CT scan of your torso showed that there are also lesions in your liver and colon.
For further evaluation of your metastatic disease, you will need a colonoscopy with a biopsy or a liver biopsy of one of the lesions.
You will need an MRI of the brain.
Please also check the patient's blood pressure as phenytoin can make felodipine less effective.
Please check a dilantin level in one week and consider discontinuing the medication after obtaining an MRI of the brain.
You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to your appointment.
