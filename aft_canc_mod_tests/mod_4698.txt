Imaging:  IMPRESSION:  CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2113-9-5**] 5:43 PM 1.
ECHO [**2113-9-15**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-3-15**], no change.
Note: Section showed myofibers with prominent inflammatory infiltrate composed of foamy macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells.
Further studies including biochemical panel will be reported as an addendum.
R forearm: pending at time of discharge   Brief Hospital Course: 58-year-old female with CAD s/p CABG, accelerated phase CML s/p allo SCT [**2112-4-6**] complicated by upper and lower GI GVHD [**2112-4-25**] and liver GVHD [**8-/2112**] presenting from OSH electively intubated for hypoxic and hypercarbic failure in the setting of myopathy.
During trials on trach collar, she has maintained her oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, however her blood pressure elevates and she reports subjective feelings of dyspnea and fatigue.
Muscle biopsy shows impressive inflammation despite having been on steriods prior to biopsy.
Given clinical improvement and radiological improvement on CT scan [**9-19**], we do not feel that this is likely a pathogenic organism.
We do recommend repeat CT chest in [**2-22**] weeks for continued monitoring.
Her CBC has been stable and she has not required any recent transfusions.
Threshold for transfusion would be platelets <10, hct <25 .
Dermatology was consulted and felt that her purpura was due to trauma and her coagulopathy.
# Elevated LFTs: LFT have been stably elevated during this hospitalization, likely secondary to her known GVHD.
Repeat ECHO here showed no wall motion abnormalities.
She also had cardiac catheterization at outside hospital for workup of initial presenting dyspnea which revealed clean coronary arteries.
She should have repeat CT chest in [**2-22**] weeks for follow up on interval change in L infiltrate.
This should be re-evaluated if remains elevated and further work-up would be warranted.
If necessary, her captopril could be up titrated.
