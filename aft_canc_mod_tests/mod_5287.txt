While there, her hospital course was marked by considerable increase in lethargy and serial CT scans showed progressive effacement of her fourth ventricle and she was transferred here for neurosurgical intervention.

Serial Head CT upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] showed progressive effacement of her fourth ventricle.
The decision was made to take the patient to the operating room for placement of an external ventricular draingiven unclear pathology and at that time perserved brain stem functions.
The following am exam continued to deteriorate and pt had no response to noxious stimuli; no corneals; no gag; pupils small and unreactive.
