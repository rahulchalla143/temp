She was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Orthopaedics) and underwent a bone scan on [**4-7**] which showed abnormal tracer in T8, T9, L1.
An MRI of her spine, CT of chest, abdomen, pelvis on [**4-23**] showed 2cm mass in the right hilum associated with small rt hilar LN and enlarged rt paratraceal LN measuring 9.8mm and 12.7mm.
She was prescribed Oxycodone, Acetaminophen and was referred for bone biopsy and XRT.
Pt underwent XRT (second session) yesterday and had a progression in her severe back pain and was referred to the ED.

Her labs were unremarkable aside from anemia of 33.2, WBC was 7.9.
A CT Pelvis was ordered which showed no fracture; L5 vertebral body lytic lesion.

CT pelvis ortho without contrast: 1.
No prior CT study for comparison.
The compression fracture is new since the previous MRI of [**2131-4-7**].
I discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 86072**] that the reference chest CT shows extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli as well as the findings suggesting widespread malignancy.
CT T and L spine: 1.
Right hilar lesion, right pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy better evaluated on contrast-enhanced CT of the chest dated [**2131-5-4**].
Lytic lesion in T12 vertebral body concerning for metastatic disease.
- Continue pain regimen as follows: * Fentanyl patch 75 mcg every 72 hours * Tylenol 1 gram every 6 hours * Lidoderm 5% patch daily * Tizanidine 2grams three times daily as needed (for muscle spasms) * Dilaudid 2-4mg by mouth every two hours as needed for pain * Dilaudid 0.125-1.5mg every 6 hours as needed for pain .
Pathology results from bone biopsies during the spinal surgery confirmed a carcinoma that likely originated in the spine.
- Patient had MRI mapping of her brain and simulated for cyberknife.
Then OFF (last day: [**6-2**]) --> START Pantoprazole 40mg daily instead of Ranitidine for acid reflux --> START bowel regimen as narcotic pain medications can make you contipated --> CONTINUE Nebulizers (albuterol/ipratropium) to help with shortness of breath from the blood clots in your lungs --> START pain medication regimen as follows: * Fentanyl patch 75 mcg every 72 hours * Tylenol 1 gram every 6 hours * Lidoderm 5% patch daily * Tizanidine 2grams three times daily as needed (for muscle spasms) * Dilaudid 2-4mg by mouth every two hours as needed for pain * Dilaudid 0.125-1.5mg every 6 hours as needed for pain .
