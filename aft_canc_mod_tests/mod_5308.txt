SInce her last chemotherapy at the end of [**Month (only) 956**], she was admitted with foot pain and swelling due to bilateral lower extremity DVT's and found to have multiple PE's on CTA for minimal pleuritic chest pain.
Her CTA suggested infiltrates consistent with a pneumonia so the patient was also treated with an outpatient course of azithromicin.
Patient admitted with R sided facial droop, headache, and underwent sterotactic brain biopsy on [**2131-1-12**] at [**Hospital1 18**] with  results c/w  CNS lymphoma.

[**2131-4-6**] MRI BRAIN: IMPRESSION: Left-sided subdural hematoma, which is new since the previous CT of [**2131-3-17**] and measures approximately 20 mm in maximum width.
[**2131-4-7**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: 1.
Acute/subacute moderate left hemispheric subdural hematoma with 9-mm rightward shift of midline structures, allowing for differences in technique, is stable since earlier study of [**2131-4-6**].
[**2131-4-10**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: Status post left frontal hemicraniectomy and drainage of left frontal subdural hemorrhage with expected post-surgical changes and interval improvement of rightward shift of midline structures.
Followup CT may be obtained for further evaluation.
[**2131-4-11**] CT head Stable  Brief Hospital Course: # New RUE dysmetria: in setting of migraine, but also anticoagulated for recent DVT's and PE's.
DDx includes complicated migraine, tumor progression, hemorrhagic CVA or stroke - reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] - will obtain MRI with contrast - neuro checks Q2H - hold enoxaparin until rule out intracranial bleed .
- Bicarb: 1meq/kg IV prior to MTX, 25meq IV with chemo, 150meq/L IVF, and 1300mg PO q6hr + additional bicarb to maintain urine pH >8 to enhance MTX excretion.
- Monitor weight and consider furosemide.
CXR does not show any new or progressive infiltrates.
IVF changed and will follow blood sugars.
Her enoxaparin was held, neuro checks were started and an MRI with contrast was obtained.
Post operative head CT revealed evacuated SDH with small residual acute blood.
She had a CT head that showed expected post operativ echanges.
timolol maleate 0.5 % Drops DAILY (Daily).
Thera Tears 0.25 % Dropperette Sig: 1-2 Drops Ophthalmic four times a day as needed for dry eyes.
Chemotherapy was complicated by migraine headaches, nausea/vomiting, and after you complained about righ-arm weakness and headache, MRI of the brain showed a subdural hematoma (brain bleed).
You should call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1669**] for an appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 4 weeks with a CT head.
