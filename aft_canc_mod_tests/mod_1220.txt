Cultures: Sputum: 9/12,13,14,16,17- all neg for AFB, 16,17 with <10 epithelial cells.
Blood cultures: [**8-24**]: 1/4 bottles Strep bovis pan sensitive, [**8-25**] and [**8-27**] negative to date .
CT Chest: IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO [**2105-8-26**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure (<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-4-17**], the focal thickening of the aortic leaflets is slightly more pronounced, but no aortic regurgitation is identified.
Colonoscopy [**2105-9-1**]:Pt with multiple polyps that were removed and sent for pathology.
The patient will likely need lifelong S Bovis suppression per ID (as pt has aortic graft).
Tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacity CT findings: CT chest showed findings that could represent fungal or mycobacterial.
However, patient had multiple induced sputum samples as well as fungal blood tests that were all negative.
- Colonoscopy shows multiple polypoid lesions, likely cause of bleeding.
Pt received multiple transfusions with goal hct of 30 while in pre-chemotherapy status.
