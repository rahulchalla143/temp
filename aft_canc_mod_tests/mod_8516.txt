Per the nursing home records, her labs were notable for Hct 29.2, Na+ 119 (from 122 on [**10-2**]), K+ 6.2 (5.7 on [**10-2**]), creatinine 3.4 (up from 2.0 on [**10-2**]).
Due to the trend of the labs, she was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
She has had a history of presumed sarcoidosis since [**2112**], though no definitive diagnosis has ever been made because her biopsy results have been inconclusive.
She was seen by [**Hospital1 18**] Rheumatology (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1667**]) in [**Month (only) **] [**2118**] and was referred for a repeat biopsy.
Prior work-up showed negative [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA, ESR of 18, and an abnormal SPEP with a IgG lambda monoclonal population of about 3% of the total protein population.
Renal (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1366**]) was consulted around the time of her admission to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for a similar set of circumstance (though she was hypokalemic at that time) and outlined the following issues: (1) Creat 1.5 with low grade proteinuria (UP/Cr ~1.5), (2) Edema with hypoalbuminemia (mid 2s), (3) Hyponatremia of likely multifactorial etiologies, (4) Left ureteral obstruction with stent placed in [**Location (un) **] in [**Month (only) **], as above.
Exam was notable for AAOx3, but occasionally confused at times and yelling, severe LE edema bilaterally with ulcers on right lateral lower leg, left dorsal aspect of foot, and left calf.
Repeat labs here showed Na+ 114, K+ 6.5, and creatinine 3.2.
EKG unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm and no peaked T waves, but received calcium gluconate and IV regular insulin for treatment of hyperkalemia.
Urinalysis showed pyuria and many bacteria, so she was started on Cipro as well.
Urology was consulted and recommended a non-contrast CT of the abdomen/pelvis, completed prior to her arrival to the ICU.
Renal U/S showed moderate left hydronephrosis, new in comparison to prior study from [**2118-8-28**] with visualization of the renal stent (patient reports passing the stent).
Past Medical History: - Lymphadenopathy with lymphedema causing anasarca and hypercalcemia, unresponsive to high-dose prednisone with atypical histiocytes with proliferation in the left nodes ----questionable diagnosis of sarcoidosis since [**2112**] with lung findings and inconclusive biopsy, presumed to have sarcoidosis ----started on methotrexate on [**2118-10-4**] ----supraclavicular LN biopsy: Atypical histiocyte-[**Doctor First Name **] proliferation, favor sarcoidosis (post-steroid treatment) ----multiple coccyx and LE ulcers - Left-sided ureteral stenosis, s/p stenting in [**2118-8-24**] - Adrenal mass: large 3 cm adrenal gland mass, increased in size from [**Month (only) 956**] to [**2118-5-24**] - Spinal stenosis - Hypertension - Hypercholesterolemia - Thyroid disease - GERD - Depression  Social History: Denies alcohol or tobacco.

Limited study due to lack of IV contrast demonstrates mild left hydronephrosis and hydroureter with the point of transition likely in the proximal to mid left ureter but not clearly identified.
[**2118-10-10**] CT Chest CONCLUSION: 1.
A left supraclavicular lymph node biopsy has been done in [**9-4**]; even if the pathologic report mentionned possible sarcoid, the radiologic appearance, however, is non-specific and malignant disease is also included in the differential diagnosis.
Bilateral non-hemorrhagic moderate pleural effusions are new since [**2118-2-23**] and are increased since recent abdominal CT of [**2118-10-7**].

Patient had a bone marrow biopsy diagnostic for Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
Bone marrow biopsy from [**10-11**] showed classical Hodgkin Lymphoma.
Patient was started on Neupogen and Leucovorin and counts improved (WBC 9.2, ANC was >4K, HCT 25.2, PLT 59) prior to transfer to BMT.
Several providers have questioned the diagnosis of Sarcoid given patient's lack of response to steroids and her multiple biopsies which, by report, were inconclusive but most likely consistent with Sarcoid.
Patient's CT scans seemed more consistent with a lymphoproliferative etiology (i.e.
Patient had a bone marrow biopsy on [**10-11**] showing classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, which is stage IV given bone marrow involvement.
She had pulmonary function tests showing a decreased DLCO and was therefore started on AVD chemotherapy with C1D1 on [**2118-10-21**].
Patient had a brain MRI demonstrating a lesion in her left frontal lobe that was very concerning for Hodgkin's.
CSF cytology was negative for malignancy; unfortunately, that result did not definitively rule out CNS Hodgkins.
A repeat brain MRI 2 weeks after the initial scan showed decrease in size of brain lesion, which was deemed more consistent with subacute infarct by neuro-oncology.
Therefore, patient had a thoracentesis on [**2118-11-11**] showing a chylous effusion.
Cytology showed no evidence of malignant cells.
Bacteremia: Patient had an episode of hypotension on [**10-11**] and blood cultures were drawn.
The culture drawn off of her PICC grew vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus faecium at approximately 19 hours.
Surveillance blood cx remained negative.
Cortisol level before steroid administration was wnl.
Hypovolemic hyponatremia, paraneoplastic syndrome/SIADH, thyroid disease, and hypervolemia from her lymphedema (though this has been long-standing and Na+ is new), were all considered.
As she was volume resuscitated, her urine electrolytes of urine Na+<10 seemed to indicate appropriate sodium avidity and subsequent appropriate ADH release.
A renal work-up was negative for hydronephrosis and again demonstrated sodium avidity with UNa <10, making appropriate ADH in the setting of intravascular depletion most likely.
Sodium returned to her baseline of high 120's-low 130's.
Creatinine downtrended to 0.9.
Patient's Cr was stable at 0.7 prior to transfer to BMT.
She then had a subsequent episode of [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr of 1.2.
It is has been complicated by remarkable edema and pressure ulcers on her coccyx and along her thighs and lower extremities.
An MRI showed that her left supraclavicular mass was likely compressing the left subclavian vein and causing LUE edema.
Hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia: [**Name (NI) **] PTH was elevated at 282.
It was felt that hypocalcemia may have been exacerbated by low Vitamin D and phosphate retention and precipitation in setting of acute renal failure [**2-24**] dehydration.
Her urine Ca was low (0.3), suggesting appropriate renal conservation of calcium in setting of hypocalcemia.
Patient has been hypercalcemic in the past; unclear what her phosphate and creatinine levels were at that time.
She was started on weekly Vitamin D [**Numeric Identifier 1871**] IU and her electrolytes were repleted as needed.
DHEAS, testosterone, 17-OH progesterone, and SHBG were WNL.
A cortisol stimulation test was normal.
She had no history of abdominal surgery and CT failed to reveal obstructive masses, though exam is limited.
Information was obtained from  nursing home records.
