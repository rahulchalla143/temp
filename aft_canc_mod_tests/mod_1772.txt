Surgical preparation of chest wound 12 x 12 cm.
She was seen today at her PCP's office and referred to the ED after being found to be orthostatic with a BP of 118/62 lying, 82/36 sitting, and 70/40 standing.
On ED exam her graft was not TTP.
Per the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EKG did not show any changes from prior.
A CXR was also performed and did not show any acute cardiopulmonary abnormality per the ED.
Labs were significant for a WBC count of 25.4, thrombocytosis to 980, floridly positive UA, hyponatremia to 127, creatinine of 2.5, and an anion gap of 15.
Blood cultures were performed, but urine culture was not sent.

Note: The biopsy is mostly comprised of fibrous tissue and lymphocytes with some crush artifact.
Addendum: Kappa and lambda ISH reveals a mixed polytypic plasma cell population.
Immunophenotyping [**7-22**] Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize blast/lymphocyte yield.
B cells are scant in nature precluding evaluation of clonality.

[**2101-7-26**] CT Abdomen and Pelvis IMPRESSION: 1.
[**8-8**] CT Chest Abdomen and Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Decrease in size of collections surrounding the transplanted kidney and collection along the lateral abdominal wall measuring 3.3 and 2.0 cm respectively from 4.8 and 2.1 cm on prior examination.
Abnormality adjacent to the coracoid process which is suboptimally evaluated on this motion-degraded study - recommend further evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT, as this could represent a mass or lymphadenopathy; collection of fluid is less likely given imaging characteristics.
ECHOCARDIOGRAMS  ECHO [**2101-7-18**]: MPRESSION:No endocarditis or abscess seen.
ECHO [**2101-7-27**]: This is a limited examination to r/o endocarditis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
ECHO [**2101-8-8**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
A mid-cavitary gradient (30mmHg peak) is identified.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-7-18**], the pericardial effusion and mid-cavitary gradient are now identified.
Serial evaluation is suggested.
ECHO [**2101-8-10**]: IMPRESSION: Very small echodensity attached to the posterior mitral annular calcification at the level of the P2 scallop.
Compared to the prior study dated [**2101-7-27**] (images reviewed), the echodensity is smaller and less mobile and probably c/w with healing vegetation.
ECHO [**2101-8-15**]: NO effusion: The left atrium is elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-7-18**], the findings are similar.CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Based on [**2097**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended.
CHEST X-RAYS  [**2101-7-11**]: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
[**2101-7-21**]: IMPRESSION: Stable chest findings in comparison with preceding study of [**2101-7-18**].
Recommend CT examination to evaluate alleged new anterior chest wall mass.
[**2101-7-27**]: AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is new moderate right-sided pneumothorax with partial collapse of the entire right lung following resection of the medial one-third of the right clavicle and first anterior rib.
[**2101-7-28**]: Current study demonstrates bibasal consolidations, bilateral pleural effusions and small amount of pneumothorax is still present as well as potentially small amount of pneumomediastinum.
Tip of the PICC line is 5.4 cm below the cavoatrial junction.
No acute cardiopulmonary changes compared with last chest x-ray.
[**2101-8-4**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again is evidence of increased pulmonary venous pressure, mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, bilateral pleural effusions, and evidence of resection of the medial aspect of the right clavicle.
[**2101-8-8**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-4**], there is little overall change.
After treatment with IV PCN, repeat echocardiogram on [**2101-8-15**] was unable to revisualize the vegetation, consistent with healing.
Culture of the drainage grew GBS sensitive to PCN, and served as the target organism for antibiotic therapy with regards to patient's multiple areas of infection.
Repeat imaging showed decrease in size of abscess on discharge.
Patient's heart rate dipped below 40, she lost consciousness and quickly recovered without lasting deficit within minutes each time.
There was likely an initial component of AIN due to NSAID use, but also a pre-renal component related to fluid loss from vomiting and insensible losses on presentation.
The right pleural effusion was tapped, a chest tube was temporarily placed, and labs showed transudative fluid so chest tubes were discontinued.
Her plavix, which she was on for throbocytosis and previous episdode of TIA, was held for concern of bleeding.
MRI from [**2-/2101**], showed Punctate focus of slow diffusion in the left posterior frontal lobe consistent with a tiny acute infarct.
Patient should have a repeat head MRA around [**2101-9-5**] to evaluate status of mycotic aneurisms and infarct of corpus callosum.
Patient will have follow-up CT scan [**2101-9-5**] for imaging of perinephric abscess.
