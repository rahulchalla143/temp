Admission Date:  [**2185-7-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-7-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-5-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Artic Sun protocol   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 84831**] is a 79 year old female with past medical history of systolic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, diabetes mellitus, COPD, known aortic aneurysm, and coronary artery disease who presented with dyspnea to the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED.
Due to respiratory distress, she was intubated with 120 mg of succinyl choline, and initiated on phenylephirine for blood pressure support--initially she was hypertensive with systolic to 180.
En route, it was reported that she had bradycardia with heart rate to 20-30, without hypotension.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, once cardiac monitor was attached, no pulse was noted.
She was also initiated on amiodarone drip to help improve control of her heart rate, which was 140-160's after return of circulation.
Imaging of the CT chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed thrombosed aorta below the renal arteries.
General surgery was consulted, and HIDA scan was recommended to rule out acute cholecystitis.
It was recommended that amiodarone continue for her tachycardia, along with levophed for blood pressure.
At time of transfer to ICU, her vitals were reported to be heart rate 126, blood pressure of 120/60 on 0.75 mg/kg/min of levophed, with oxygen saturation of 95% on ventilator.
INR was >10.0, and BNP was 16,677.
Her ALT was 709, and AST 901, with normal alk phos and total bilirubin.
A head CT was negative for acute process.
LFT abnormalities were attributed to hepatic congestion from CHF.
During that admission a right apical spiculated mass was seen on chest CT as well as descending thoracic AAA.
Past Medical History: - Congestive heart failure, EF 15% - Atrial fibrillation on warfarin - COPD - Diabetes mellitus - AAA: described as 4.7 cm x 4.8 cm in descending thoracic aorta - Adrenal hyperplasia - Right-sided breast cancer status-post lumpectomy on Arimidex - Tobacco use - Coronary artery disease status-post MI - Hyperlipidemia - Right apical 1.8 cm spiculated mass noted during admission [**11/2184**]--per family, this was diagnosed as lung cancer (details unknown), status-post either lobectomy or segmentectomy [**3-/2185**] at [**Hospital1 1774**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 816**].
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: Afebrile BP: 180/100 systolic P: 130-160, irregular, Oxygen saturation 100% on FiO2 100% General: Unresponsive to verbal or tactile stumli, occasional myoclonic jerks HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear with ETT in place.

General surgery consulted and recommended HIDA scan and possible IR-guided percutaneous gallbladder drain.
HIDA scan showed normal filling but no emptying consistent with possible CBD stone.
Given the EEG findings and the poor prognostic situation, the patient was made CMO by her HCP (brother- [**Male First Name (un) 1704**] on [**2185-7-14**].
