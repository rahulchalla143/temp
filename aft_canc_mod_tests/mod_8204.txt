Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %).
Compared to the prior study dated [**2159-8-2**], no clear change (LVEF was probably overestimated on prior).
During the surgery, patient transiently dropped her blood pressure during the procedure to 50s/30s, she was initiated on phenylephrine gtt through peripheral IV.
Serial labs were obtained for monitoring.
HCT were monitored and there was a slow decrease in her HCT but no evidence of active bleeding, she was given 2 additional units of PRBC.
# ICU admission #2/desaturation secondary to flash pulmonary edema: [**2159-8-2**] she had respiratory distress after CTA of the chest was performed for tachypnea and persistent tachycardia in the 100's.
CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed worsening bilateral pleural effusion with pulmonary edema.
Her Lung exam was significant for extensive inspiratory crackles, CXR consistent with worsening pulmonary edema.
EKG showed left bundle branch block that is unchanged compared to EKG on [**2159-7-23**].
IV Lasix was administered with good urine output during her 2nd ICU stay.
Echo was of suboptimal image quality and showed ?
EF of 45%.
She was placed on IV Nitro drip for a period of time for SBP in the 150-160's.
BiPAP was gradually weaned off and pt was transferred out of ICU with saturation in her 90's on NC of 2-3L.
Repeat Echo on [**8-6**] confirmed prior Echo and showed moderately depressed LVEF at 30-35%.
Her sedation and vasopressors were weaned without any difficulty, and her blood pressure remained normal at the time of transfer out of the ICU and continue to be stable prior to discharge to rehab.
# Hematocrit: Patient's hematocrit dropped from 39.9 on admission to 30.0 post-surgery.
She was transfused with 4 units blood cells and 2 units of FFP throughout her hospital stay, and her HCT was stable at 41 at the time of transfer to rehab.
#Incisional cellulitis/wound care: small 1.5 cm incisional opening, continue with twice daily wet to dry wound packing; mild erythema around the incision and wound opening, pt was started on a 10 day course of Keflex.
# UTI: urine culture was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and it was pan-sensitive.
