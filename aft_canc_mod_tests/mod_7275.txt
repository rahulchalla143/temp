Worsening renal failure: the patient's baseline creatinine was 2.2-2.4, and he presented with creatinine of 3.2.
Previously he had been discharged to rehab on n lisinopril and lasix, and his creatinine worsened since that time.
Renal failure was likely multifactorial related to his poor cardiac function, prerenal azotemia leading to ATN, and complicated by ACE inbitor and lasix use, obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy as he was noted to have urine residuals of 350cc when catheter was inserted, and continued periods of hypotension.
Despite efforts to closely monitor his fluid status, to increase his blood pressure to SBP >120 to maintain renal perfusion, to relieve obstruction by placing a foley, and to treat his funguria aggressively, his creatinine continued to rise.
Creatinine stabilized at around 4.2 by the time of discharge.
His renal failure continued to worsen on this regimen, and he became hypotensive with SBP 80-90.
CXR here showed a possible pneumonia, and he was treated with levofloxacin.
X-ray; however, did not show any signs of osteomyelitis.
INR became surpratherapeutic while on concurrent antibiotics, and coumadin was held.
Coumadin should be resumed at 2mg qHS, and held for INR >2 (goal INR [**1-24**]).
He continued to have guiaic positive stools, but his Hct remained stable.
He had a colonoscopy in [**12-26**] that showed benign adenomatous polyps.
Sodium Citrate-Citric Acid 500-334 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO QD ().
Coumadin 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime: hold for INR >2.
