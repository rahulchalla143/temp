Review of CTA showed no PE, but there was ground glass opacities on CT, so PCP was considered highly unlikely given her recent history of steroid use.
Her induced sputum was negative and BOL was done and also negative.
Sputum cultures were negative.
She spiked a fever to 103 with blood pressures hypertensive into the systolic 80s and with rigors.
Chest x-ray showed a question of left lung opacity.
The patient was given Vancomycin and a gram of intravenous fluids.
Today, the patient was found in the bathroom and became hypoxic with saturations in the 80s and was responsive to oxygen, but was still tachypneic without improvement and was placed on nonrebreather.
Her pulmonary examination shows she has bronchial breath sounds with dry crackles at the bases.
Abdominal examination was benign.

She had a gas showing 7.36, 31, 96.
She had a CT from the 29th of her abdomen and pelvis showing marked increased consolidations at the left lung base and question of new left sided pleural effusion.
Ultimately  her Intensive Care Unit course continued and she began to defervesce and her bacterial studies particulaly from BAL lavage were found to be negative.
Later in her hospital course she also had an echocardiogram for question of new ECG findings in her inferior leads.
Her echocardiogram, however, was essentially normal with an ejection fraction of 55% without any gross wall motion abnormalities or valvular pathology.
She did have lower extremity doppler ultrasounds, which were negative.
All of her cultures are negative to date.
