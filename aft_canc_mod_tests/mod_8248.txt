A interpolar cyst measuring 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.6 cm shows no internal vascularity or septations and is unchanged in size from [**2137-8-19**].
The left kidney measures 9 cm and is diffusely echogenic consistent with medical renal disease.
The right renal upper pole lesion seen on the prior CT was difficult to visualize on this examination.
[**12-28**] CXR: Comparison is made to the prior study from [**2135-8-20**].
There is interval increase in the size of bilateral pleural effusions from CT scan of [**2137-7-28**], with associated atelectasis/consolidation.
MRI OF THE PELVIS: There is a Foley catheter in a near-empty bladder.
Echogenic debris measures with maximum cross-sectional dimension 5.0 x 1.4 x 2.0 cm (TRV x AP x CC), layering in the dependent position of the urinary bladder, compatible with blood clot.
There is an area of focally increased density at the right base that appears increased since the previous study and a small area of pneumonia cannot be excluded.
This might be better evaluated by CT if further evaluation is warranted.
