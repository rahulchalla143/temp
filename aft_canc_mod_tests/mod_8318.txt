The day of presentation, the patient had undergone a capsule endoscopy and got home, noticed 2 episodes of black, tarry stool without any red blood.
She had recently been undergoing an outpatient workup for worsening anemia and was due for initiation of aranesp shot tomorrow after having received IV Iron supplementation recently.
Workup was notable for a HCT of 21 (was 22.1 2 days prior, 26.2 one month prior).
EKG showed new ST depressions in the inferolateral leads with Troponin of 0.06.
CXR showed possible mild pulm edema, focal calcification R lower lung, likely scarring/atelectasis.
She was written for 2 units PRBC in addition to 500cc of a 1L NS bag, a GI cocktail, and Pantoprazole IV x1, and was admitted to the MICU for the management of GI Bleed.
VS prior to transfer were 116/64, 107, 17, 98% 2L.
Normocytic Anemia: thought to be due to CKD/iron def Iron Deficiency: S/P Ferraheme X 2 in [**2179-8-9**] stage 4 CKD  thought to be due to hypertension and possibly diabetes.

ECG [**9-22**]: Sinus tachycardia and occasional atrial ectopy.
Increase in rate as compared with prior tracing of [**2170-5-21**].
TTE [**9-23**]: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
CT Abd/Pelvis: [**9-24**]: 1.
Aortic atherosclerosis, with 2.3 cm infrarenal aortic ectasia.
RENAL ULTRASOUND:FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 8.3 cm with no evidence of hydronephrosis, stones, or masses within it.
CXR: Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed on [**2179-9-22**].
Otherwise the limited exam of the rest of small intestine was normal.
A CT abdomen/pelvis was done that showed a 6.8cm small bowel tumor consistent with malignancy.
The patient underwent push enteroscopy [**2179-10-1**] which showed a malignant mass involving the entire circumference of the distal jejunum causing partially obstruction.
A biopsy was obtained; the final pathology report was pending on day of discharge, but prelim results showed poorly differentiated carcinoma, unclear if adenocarcinoma or lymphoid in origin.
It was felt this was likely demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed and she was transfused to a hematocrit of 30.
Serial EKGs were performed that showed stable Q waves in leads III and avF, with T wave inversion in leads V4-V6.
Her cardiac enzymes were trended through her admission on the medicine floor.
The troponin peaked and then fell; the patient's CK-MB and CK remained flat while on the medicine floor.
The patient was monitored on telemetry through the admission.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  She had acute on chronic renal failure with Cr 3.2 and recently 3.4 on [**9-20**] from baseline of 2.4 on [**6-17**].
CT of the abdomen/pelvis showed left hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
The patient's creatinine was trended through her admission on the medical floor.
The patient's creatinine continued to up-trend through the admission.
Urine was negative for eosinophils and the creatinine was unresponsive to fluid bolus.
The patient's worsening kidney function was thought to be due to obstruction presumably from the small bowel mass.
Renal ultrasound showed moderate to severe left hydronephrosis with hydroureter of the proximal and mid ureter.
The patient's serum creatinine trended downward with placement of the nephrostomy tube on the left, which initially had bloody output that cleared to essentially normal urine with trace bloody streaks by discharge.
Anemia:  Patient presented with hematocrit of 26.8.
Her hematocrit was trended daily.
The patient had a transfusion threshold to transfuse if hematocrit was less than 30 in light of the patient's NSTEMI.
On day of discharge, the patient's hematocrit was stable at ~ 29. .
Repeat TTE on this admission showed worsening of her AS with valve area of 1.0.
Her blood pressures ranged from 120s -140s / 60s-80s while on the floor on metoprolol.
KUB films showed that the capsule was present in the right lower quadrant.
Push enteroscopy showed that the capsule had passed the area of partial obstruction.
The final results from these samples are still not available, but the preliminary results show that you do have a cancer in your small bowel.
You received blood tranfusions to keep your blood counts stable.
You had a nephrostomy tube placed in the left kidney to help drain urine from this kidney.
You will also need to have follow-up with an Oncologist regarding the results of the biopsy from the mass in your small bowel.
You will need to discuss the results of your testing done while in the hospital.
