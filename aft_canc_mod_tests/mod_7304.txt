[**2131-9-25**]: CT Chest: 1.
CT Head: 1.
CD 20, 79 +, CD10, BCL2 - .
[**2131-9-30**]: CT abd/pelvis: 1.
The fullness of the collecting systems may be secondary to marked bladder distention.
Further evaluation with ultrasound or contrast-enhanced CT is recommended.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2131-10-25**]: CT chest: 1.
A dedicated CT trachea study could be performed when the patient is stable, if clinically warranted, for confirmation.
[**2131-10-31**]: CT trachea: Moderate-to-severe tracheo-bronchomalacia.
A biopsy of the anterior chest mass was performed on [**2131-9-26**] with orthopedics and thoracics following.
A staging Abd/Pelvic CT and echo was performed.
Abd/Pelvic CT showed pulm nodules increased in size from [**9-25**] and multiple SC masses in back and buttocks.
The biopsy returned consistent with diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
Repeat CT torso was notable for decrease in tumor burden.
#Tachypnea/Hypoxia - The patient required 2L O2 to maintain oxygen sats >95% while on the medicine service.
She was on lasix as an outpatient so this was continued with minimal improvement in her oxygen saturations despite increasing doses.
She had bibasilar crackles on exam but her CXR was not consistent with failure.
A TTE was done notable for normal EF, mild pulmonary systolic hypertension, and [**1-28**]+AR.
A chest CT and CXR were not notable for pneumonia but notalb for bilateral effusions and evidence of volume overload.
Diuresis was limited by worsening creatinine and increasing HCO3.
Her ABG was 7.31/86/123 on 4L.
Pulmonary mechanics were completed and notable for a NIF of -38cmH2O and VC of 450 CC.
Her ABG on Bipap was 7.5/54/93 compared to 7.4/75/78 on nasal cannula.
She had a therapeutic thoracentesis done the next day.
PFTs from [**Hospital1 2025**] were obtained and notable for FEV1-1.1 and FVC 1.9 c/w COPD.
She was transferred back to the floor but continued to have O2 sats of 88-89% on [**1-28**] L NC.
Her CXR was again c/w CHF.
She had a CT neck notable for tracheomalacia but a stent was felt unnecessary as it would only provide minimal palliative symptom benefit and the patient was a poor surgical candidate.
ABG was notable for 7.2/87/50/36 on 1L.
Blood and urine cultures were sent.
Blood cultures were again sent which grew out [**1-28**] coag negative staph.
On [**2131-9-30**], her temperature was 101.2 so she was started on vancomycin.
She also had increasing LFTs and an abdominal US notable for sludge.
Repeat US was notable for cholelithiasis but negative for cholecystitis.
On [**10-11**], she remained afebrile but developed increasing wbc count and diarrhea so stool studies were sent which were negative.
Surveillance blood cultures also remained negative.
Her urine was notable for yeast despite multiple foley changes.
After her thoracentesis on [**10-25**], a follow up CT scan was notable for ground glass opacities and an infiltrate.
## elevated alk phos - The patient noted RUQ pain around [**2132-9-30**].
A repeat US on [**10-10**] was notable for cholelithiasis but no cholecystitis.
On [**10-26**] she had a recurrence of abdominal pain so surgery was consulted and a HIDA scan was ordered.
She was guaic negative and hemolysis labs were negative.
Her hematocrit stablized and she remained off of anticoagulation except for ppx w/ subcutaneous heparin.
CHF 3.
