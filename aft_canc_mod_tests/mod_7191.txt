Admission Date:  [**2130-2-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-2-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-12-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: progressive shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old gentlemen with history of emphysema, SCC diagnosed in [**8-/2129**] s/p left upper lobectomy and s/p neoadjuvant chemoradiation, PE/DVT in [**11/2129**], pericardial effusion w/ tamponade requiring pericardial windown in [**1-/2130**], s/p IVC filter placement who presents from clinic with SOB and CTA showing multiple PEs and LLL pneumonia.
He presented to the ER on [**2-7**]/2 and was initially felt to have pneumonia, but at the time of admission was found to have a pericardial effusion with tamponade in the setting of a supratherapetuic INR to 15.
However, then appeared to be continued loculated pericardial fluid so eventually a sub-xiphoid pericardial window was performed and an IVC filter was placed.
He was seen in house by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], a cardiolgist, for further evaluation of afib/flutter.
During that hospitalization, decision was made to discontinue Warfarin given difficulty with maintaining therapeutic INR and multiple recent surgeries.
CTA was done and showed RML and RLL lobe pulmonary embolisms, LLL PNA, trace pericardial effusion.
A bedside TTE showed trace effusion but no RV collapse.
Review of Systems: (+) Per HPI  Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: PET CT [**2129-8-10**]: FDG-avid LUL large 49x40mm lung lesion is seen highly concerning for lung cancer.
Bronchoscopy [**2129-8-22**]: obtained tissue for pathology which revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma (stage IIIa) .
[**2129-9-9**]: left VATS and lymph node biopsy to complete staging work up.
No pleural metastases were noted but there were bulky level 6 lymph nodes, which were positive for metastatic carcinoma on frozen sections; final pathology showed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with extensive necrosis histologically similar to the prior lung sample.
No other history of cancer or blood clotting disorders  Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Admission: Vitals - T 97.5  BP 110/70 HR 68 RR 24 02 sat 94 on 3L GENERAL: NAD SKIN: warm and well perfused, no excoriations or lesions, no rashes; HEENT: AT/NC, EOMI, PERRLA, anicteric sclera, pink conjunctiva, MMM, good dentition, nontender supple neck, no LAD, no JVD appreciated CARDIAC: RRR, S1/S2, no mrg; incsion on sternum well healed, not erythematous LUNG: crackles in RLL, decreased breath sounds in LLL ABDOMEN: nondistended, +BS, nontender in all quadrants, no rebound/guarding, no hepatosplenomegaly M/S: moving all extremities well, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, no obvious deformities PULSES: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally NEURO: CN II-XII intact  Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission:  [**2130-2-3**] 03:50PM   WBC-14.2* RBC-4.55* HGB-11.8* HCT-38.9* MCV-86 MCH-26.0* MCHC-30.4* RDW-15.6* [**2130-2-3**] 03:50PM   NEUTS-84.8* LYMPHS-7.3* MONOS-3.2 EOS-4.3* BASOS-0.4 [**2130-2-3**] 03:50PM   GLUCOSE-113* UREA N-20 CREAT-1.1 SODIUM-133 POTASSIUM-5.4* CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-21* ANION GAP-16 [**2130-2-3**] 03:58PM   LACTATE-2.9* K+-4.9 [**2130-2-3**] 04:00PM   PT-13.0* PTT-25.5 INR(PT)-1.2* .
Imaging TTE [**2130-2-3**]: 1.
Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is  normal, with an  estimated LVEF of 55-60%.
There is subtle septal flattening in systole in one off-axis view , which can be consistent with right  ventricular pressure overload, but is nondiagnostic 4.
The right ventricular systolic function is normal.
CTA [**2130-2-3**]: -Acute pulmonary emboli in the right middle lobe, into segments of the right lower lobe.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST [**2130-1-10**]: Findings: A large pericardial effusion, with attenuation characteristics of bloody or exudative fluid has developed, impinging on the right atrium and right ventricle, suggesting cardiac tamponade.
ECHO [**2130-2-10**] There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended to rule out vegetations.
There was also a concern for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage so he underwent a bronchoscopy showing minimial bleeding.
His respiratory status and chest xray began to improve initially on broad spectrum antibiotics.
An echo was obtained showing a severe amount of tricuspid regurg.
A ferritin level was checked and found to be [**Numeric Identifier 42344**], then >[**Numeric Identifier 4856**] on recheck.
