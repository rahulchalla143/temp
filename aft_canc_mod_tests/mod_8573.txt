Admission Date:  [**2127-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-5-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-12-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: Fever, abnormal chest CT.  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old male with a history of stage I lymphocyte [**Doctor First Name **] classical Hodgkin's s/p XRT now with recurrent Hodgkins disease, s/p 3 cycles of AVD (last treatment was [**4-25**] (C3D15)), and presumed bleomycin pneumonitis on steroids, who presents from clinic with fever to 102.2 and dry cough.
He says that 2 days prior to admission, on day 25 of his third cycle of AVD, he awoke and felt warm, at which time his temperature was 100.7.
He was seen in clinic later that day at which time his temperature was 99.7, blood cultures and a UA were sent, and he was given a prescription for clindamycin 300 mg PO QID which he has been taking.
The following morning, on the day of admission, his temperature at home was 102.2, therefore he was seen in clinic.
A CT thorax on the day of admission demonstrated diffuse ground glass opacities, and he was sent for admission.
Otherwise review of systems negative for chills, headache, chest pain, abdominal pain, palpitations, bleeding gums, hematochezia, melena, dysuria.
He developed R sided chest discomfort and chills 2 hours after receiving bleomycin, with T 101.8, O2 sat 88% on RA.
He had PFTs on [**2-11**] with DLCO 76%, decreasing 66% on repeat [**4-8**].
Repeat PFTs done on [**4-15**] showed DLCO significantly improved to 80%, therefore prednisone decreased to 40 mg daily, and subsequently was tapered to 30 then 20, but repeat DLCO was worsened at 73% therefore prednisone was increased back to 30 mg daily which is what he has been taking.
Excisional biopsy was consistent with lymphocyte [**Doctor First Name **] classical Hodgkin's disease with diffuse effacement and diagnostic [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells.
Flow cytometry revealed monoclonal B cells which were CD5 positive, raising the possibility of CLL.
By flow cytometry a monoclonal population demonstrated monoclonal kappa population CD 19, 20, 22, 5 and FMC7.
A staging gallium scan at that time only revealed uptake in the left side of the neck.
CT torso showed no significant adenopathy.
Following this he was monitored with serial CT scans.
CT scan dated [**2125-1-29**] revealed mild interval increase in size of right hilar node, largest measuring 1.1cm and slight interval increase of the right sided subcarinal adenopathy measuring 1cm.
This prompted a CT scan, earlier than planned, on [**2127-1-20**].
He underwent a CT guided FNA of one of the lung based nodules which revealed a minute fragment of fibrous tissue with scattered small lymphocytes and rare large atypical cells, including binucleated forms, with prominent nucleoli consistent with [**Doctor Last Name **]-  Sternberg cells.
Immunoperoxidase stains revealed that some of the large atypical cells are positive for CD20 and CD30, and negative for CD15.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: 99.2, 92, sbp 138, RR 18, 95% RA.
Pertinent Results: CT thorax with contrast [**2127-5-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
These have significantly increased since the prior examination of [**2127-3-14**].

His presentation with dyspnea and worsening ground glass opacities on CT scan, in the setting of Hodgkin's Disease and having been on steroids was concerning for PCP.
His sats remained around 88-92% occasionally requiring 1L O2 NC.
Cultures were taken and came back negative.
Blood culltures were negative.
Counts on discharge were stable with WBC 8.7 Hct 31.5 and Plts 184.
