chemotherapy.
Her urine output was noted to be low during the middle of the case but she was making greater than 30cc/hr by the end of the operation.
She required metoprolol 5 IV Q4H to control her heart rate in the ICU and when returned to the floor for a short period of time.
On the floor patient was intermediately tachycardic with HR 100-120, her Lopressor was weaned off.
Resp: After being intubated overnight for close monitoring she was extubated on POD 1 and was weaned off oxygen and onto room air by POD 2.
Her NGT output slowly declined over POD1 to POD4 but was kept because of the extent of the case.
On POD 6 UGI study showed no leak and good flow on contrast through gastro-jejunostomy.
On POD 7 clamp trials were started and residuals were 385-400s.
She had been advanced to tube feeds goal of 60cc/hr and was started octreotide 150 TID in addition to reglan, but was noted to have increased NGT output and have tube feed coloring to NGT output and so tube feeds were reduced down to 30cc/hr.
Her creatinine peaked at 1.3 but was otherwise normal through hospitalization.
On POD 1 she received 2 units RBCs for Hct 24.2 and responded appropriately.
On POD 4 she received an additional 1 unit for Hct of 26.
A hematology consult was called in the setting of questionable resistance pattern and no clear etiology for this pseudo resistance could be elucidated, although by the time she was transitioned to Lovenox her PTT went from 20s to 90s.
She had multiple factor xa levels checked, the second being 0.56, and was followed by the hematology team who agreed with dosing of 70mg [**Hospital1 **] Lovenox, thought that she would need lifelong anticoagulation, and argued that Lovenox is better than coumadin for cancer patients based on recent data.
She was afebrile until spiking to 104 on POD 9.
CT scan that day showed fat stranding around the duodenum but no free air or clear fluid collection.
She was started on vanc and zosyn after GNR found on blood cultures, which eventually grew out pan sensitive E. Coli, at which point vancomycin was stopped.
On POD 28, her temperature rose to 102 and she had AMS.
She was restarted on zosyn and vancomycin empirically and her AMS began to resolve on POD 29.
All surveillance cultures were negative and patient's WBC remained within normal limits prior discharge and patient remains afebrile.

You are now stable for discharge home with continued close follow up and care with a visiting nurse who will continue to monitor your blood levels (Hematocrit) as well as assist with dressing changes for your incisional wound.
