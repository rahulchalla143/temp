He was taken to [**Location (un) **] Emergency Room, where he was found to be afebrile with pulse of 60 and blood pressure 104/51.
The patient then dropped his systolic blood pressure to the low 70s at which time he was given Narcan, normosaline bolus, and hydrocortisone 100 mg times one.
The patient's pressures did not improve and therefore, he required a Dopamine drip.
The EKG at the outside hospital showed on significant change and no evidence of ischemia.
CK and troponin were negative times one.
When the patient arrived to [**Hospital1 188**] MICU he was mentating but lethargic with systolic blood pressures from 110 to 130s on dopamine drip at 15 mcg per kilogram per minute.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, B-cell type diagnosed [**2103-2-16**] found in T11 vertebrae and status post XRT times two treatments.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following: Temperature 99.4, blood pressure 134/79, heart rate 85, respiratory rate 16, 91% on four liters nasal cannula, weight 54.6 kg.
LUNGS: Lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
Normal S1 and S2, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the apex, no S3 or S4.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count:  7.0, hematocrit 36.3, platelet count 354,000 with differential of 86% neutrophils, 4% bands, 4 lymphs, and 2 atypical lymphs.
Coagulations:  PT 12.6, INR 1.1.
Chem 7:  Sodium 131, potassium 4.6, chloride 94, bicarbonate 28, BUN 21, creatinine 0.6 and glucose 135, free calcium 1.15, phosphorus 4.0 and magnesium 1.6.
CK 58.
Additional labs from outside hospital on [**2103-4-20**] revealed the first CK of 35, troponin less than 0.3, LFTs within normal limits, albumin 2.0.
EKG from outside hospital showed normal sinus rhythm with normal axis, normal intervals with nonspecific T-wave abnormalities.
Chest x-ray on admission showed the following:  Right lower lobe opacification and probably small effusion.
EKG did not show any evidence of ischemia.
On chest x-ray from this admission the patient had right upper lobe and right lower lobe infiltrates.
In addition, blood cultures were sent secondary to question of sepsis.
Urinalysis was found to be negative.
Urine culture and blood cultures times two showed no growth to date times 72 hours.
LFTs were within normal limits from outside hospital.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient has known adrenal insufficiency from the last hospital stay, which displayed a positive cortisol stimulation test and low minimal and corticoid levels.
Lidoderm 0.5% patch 12 hours on and 12 hours off up to three patchs at a time.
