In [**2111-11-27**], the patient developed recurrent abdominal pain, the workup for on an abdominal CT revealed a left hepatic lobe abnormality with ductal dilatation concerning for cholangiocarcinoma.
Cholangiogram at that time revealed common bile duct strictures as well.
Brushings sent for cytology were positive for atypical cells suspicious for adenocarcinoma.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital 6138**] Hospital with increasing abdominal pain on [**2112-2-28**] with a total bilirubin of 4.6, alkaline phosphatase 751, and a white blood cell count of 10.5 which later increased to 15.9.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature current 97.5, blood pressure 101/88, heart rate 108, respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation 100% on room air.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 16.1, hematocrit 31.1, platelets 672,000.
INR 1.4.
PTT 23.
Sodium 135, potassium 4.7, chloride 99, bicarbonate 23, BUN 17, creatinine 0.5, glucose 81.
Alkaline phosphatase 811, total bilirubin 7.7, AST 67, amylase 15, lipase 2, albumin 2.7, calcium 9.0, phosphorus 3.7, magnesium 2.0.
CK 44, lactate 1.4.
Her preintubation ABG revealed a pH of 7.4, PC02 35, P02 73, bicarbonate 25.
Abdominal CT from an outside study on [**2112-3-2**] revealed ductal dilation extending from the porta hepatis to intraductal areas.
Distal, transverse, and descending colon with localized ileus, right peripheral consolidation with effusion.
The EKG on [**2112-3-2**] revealed sinus tachycardia at 128, normal axis, intervals, T wave inversions in V3 through V6, I, III, and aVF without prior EKGs for comparison.
The chest x-ray revealed bilateral hilar congestion.
The patient did have a troponin leak consistent with a non-ST segment myocardial infarction with a peak troponin I of about 6.0.
The patient underwent an abdominal CT.  An abdominal CT was performed on [**2112-3-6**] which revealed bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, a large amount of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis, intact common bile duct stents, bilateral renal stones.
The patient's total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase then gradually trended down.
COMMUNICATION/DISPOSITION:  Given the patient's overall grim prognosis, discussions were held with the patient's daughter, Mrs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
An addendum will later be added.
