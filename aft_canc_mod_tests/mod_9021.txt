He additionally, over the time course, developed acute renal failure with rising creatinine to 2.9.
These were biopsied with a nonspecific pattern and viral cultures were sent, which were negative.
He also underwent a barium enema, which showed a pattern in the distal sigmoid colon and distal small bowel consistent with a functional ileus, but no evidence of obstruction.
He was taken to the operating room [**2105-2-18**], at which time he underwent an exploratory laparotomy with takedown of enterocutaneous fistula, lysis of adhesions, revision of the enterosigmoid colostomy, small bowel resection, and a component separation ventral herniorrhaphy under general endotracheal anesthesia.
He had good urine output throughout the case, however, towards the end he became mildly acidotic.
Chest x-ray was consistent with likely left lower lobe pneumonia.
Blood cultures grew out coagulase negative staph.
Sputum grew out yeast and gram-negative rods.
Repeat sputum cultures grew out Klebsiella oxytoca, which was pansensitive.
The white blood cell count was also still elevated.
He had a repeat abdominal CT scan [**3-4**], to evaluate for intra-abdominal abscess.
There were a few small fluid collections visualized, however, no definite abscesses were identified.
EKG showed some T-wave flattening in V4 through V6.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled, which were negative.
Cardiology consultation was called and it was recommended that noninvasive testing could be done at a later date.
It was further noted on the patient's labs that his creatinine began rising reaching a peak of 2.7.
He underwent renal ultrasonography on the [**2105-3-14**], which showed normal kidneys, no evidence of hydronephrosis, stones, or masses.
He has been able to maintain room-air saturations in the high 90s.
The hematocrit stabilized at 29.
In addition, because of the preoperative question of mesenteric ischemia, he underwent a hypocoagulable workup, which was negative.
Stool was sent for C. difficile, which was negative.
Urine culture, from [**3-8**], grew Enterococcus and yeast, for which she was treated with a full course of Ampicillin.
He defervesced and the white count decreased to 10 and then 8.6.
The hematocrit is stable, as well.
