He underwent right-sided hemicraniectomy, evacuation of hematoma, and dural repair of the superior sagittal sinus.
He has had a single positive blood culture with coag positive staph growing - his CVL was removed and has no growth to date.
A single stool sample is negative for c. difficile.
He was given empiric perioperative vancomycin and gentamicin x 3 doses starting on [**3-2**]/7, and then started on vancomycin and zosyn from [**Date range (1) 8301**], and nafcillin from [**Date range (1) 71203**], for empiric coverage of fevers.
His LFT's and pancreatitic enzymes were noted to be elevated on [**3-6**] with his ALT peaking at 258, alk phos at 623, and lipase at 623, they are all now trending down.
The patient had repeat pan-culture (blood, urine and sputum) revealing negative blood and urine cultures and sputum growing Staph and E. Coli as known prior to transfer.
The patient had no signs of infiltrate on repeat CXR and therefore his sputum growth was not treated as a pathogen.
The patient was transferred to the medicine service with a transaminitis, benign abdominal exam and no signs on abdominal imaging (abdominal plain film and ultrasound) of an acute process.
The patient had a benign abdominal exam and benign abdominal imaging as described above.
The patient was maintained off of possible inciting drugs and his pancreatic enzymes are trending toward normal.
Head CT revealed no interval change.
The patient was continued on valproic acid for seizure prophylaxis and underwent an EEG which showed encephalopathy but no active seizure activity.
His mental status and neuro exam was monitored and unchanged throughout his remaining hospital course, with the exception of occasional eye opening to voice.
On admission, Hct was 43, 24 on the time of discharge.
Iron studies were inconsistent with iron deficiency and hemolysis labs were not consistent with hemolysis.

Have your liver and pancreatic enzymes monitored on blood work within 5 days of discharge to ensure normalization of these values.
You should receive blood transfusions for Hct <21.
You also should have your hematocrit checked at this time.
