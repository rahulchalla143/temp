Admission Date:  [**2158-5-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-5-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-4-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfamethoxazole / Dapsone / Nevirapine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: respiratory distress, abdominal distention, facial swelling  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: thrombolysis  History of Present Illness: HPI: 42 year old woman with AIDS (By CD4 criteria, CD4 of 42), and a high-grade AIDS-related lymphoma (plasmablastic lymphoma with the initial site of disease in the left maxillary sinus).
She also was hypotensive with SBP 80-90s and tachycardic with HR 120s.
She got a dose of dilaudid and her SBP dropped to 70s however patient mentating normally.
Patient then underwent CT torso which revealed multiple pulmonary emboli including left main artery, right atrium extending into SVC, cannot exclude extension into IVC, focal clot within pulmonary veins as well;  abdominal and pelvic ascites, moderate large right pleural effusion.
Radiology felt that patient may benefit from cardiac MRI to differentiate between mass vs clot.
ABG on NRB was 7.48/29/81; in the ED also tachycardic to 120-140s, appears to be sinus tachy.
AIDS (CD4 63 and VL 7,290 in [**1-15**])- multiple antiretroviral meds.
Thought to have gotten HIV from blood transfusion in the [**2131**]'s.
She has areas in several bones that are hypermetabolic on PET scan 3.
Lung nodules - 1.5 cm cavitary nodule in the left upper lung in 9/[**2156**].
She had a CT scan of the chest in [**3-/2157**] that revealed a 13-mm cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe that had remained stable, and stable nodule in the other lung fields: 3-4 mm noncalcified nodules in the right upper lobe, lingula and right middle lobe remain stable.

ct abdomen: IMPRESSION: 1.
The differential includes a possible primary cardiac tumor centered in the left atrium and further assessment could be performed by cardiac MRI.
Recommend CT of the left lower extremity for further assessment.
echo [**5-16**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) R heart/pulm lymphoma vs clot: Chest CT in ED showed extensive obstruction of IVC/SVC, RA/RV by tumor or clot.
TEE revealed 2x2 cm mass in RA prolapsing into the RV during diastole, creating severe functional TS.
LENIs showed non-occlusive clot/mass in R superior femoral vein.
She was tachypneic throughout her admission, but Oxygen sats remained above 90% on 100% NRB.
She had received 8 liters by the time she left the ICU, but her urine output remained low, 0-30 cc/hr.
Her Cr rose to 1.6 from a baseline of 0.9, likely prerenal with iscehmic ATN.
5)Anion gap acidosis: Due to hypoperfusion, her lactate increased from 3.4 on admission to 4.9 on HD 2, and she had an AG of 18.
This was felt to be either tumor or clot and further eval was not undertaken on this admission.
8) HIV - Patient was on salvage therapy, has been off HAART for weeks now given trouble taking PO meds (recent esophagitis).
Her last CD4 count was 47 on [**2158-5-9**], and viral load 7290 ([**2158-1-9**].
9) Abdominal discomfort: Abdomen did not show any acute process, but diffuse abd discomfort, likely from ascites.
Sucralfate 1 gram 4x/day   Discharge Disposition: Home with Service  Discharge Diagnosis: Deceased from heart failure induced by R heart/pulmonary tumor from AIDS related lymphoma.
