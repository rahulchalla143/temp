He was initially brought to [**Hospital1 **] and a Head CT showed extensive SAH w/IVH extension into the third and fourth ventricle.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch  CT Head: Extensive SAH along the sylvian fissure and cisterns, IVH extension into the third and fourth ventricles, ventriclomegaly noted.
Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2190-1-25**] 1.
There has been some decompression of the right lateral ventricle; however, the body and anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left ventricle appear increased in size.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2190-1-25**]: 1.
ECHO [**2190-1-26**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST [**2190-1-26**]: 1.
HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST [**2190-1-26**]: 1.
Further extension or redistribution of intraventricular hemorrhage, now filling the majority of the lateral ventricles, more markedly on the left, as well as a crescentic area of acute hemorrhage within the fourth ventricle.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2190-1-27**]: 1.
EEG [**2190-1-28**]: IMPRESSION: This EEG shows a fairly repetitive alternating pattern between what looks like a mild diffuse encephalopathy to more significant slowing perhaps related to the intermittent use of medication although it may also represent a combination of increased intracranial pressure and/or projected abnormalities.
Unchanged non-contrast head CT showing residual diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, diffuse cerebral edema, effacement of the basal cisterns consistent with herniation, and evolving left cerebellar hemispheric and vermian infarction.
CT perfusion with suggested decreased perfusion in the medial left cerebellar hemisphere, also consistent with infarction.
CT Head [**2190-1-28**]: IMPRESSION: Stable positioning of right frontal EVD with no new intracranial hemorrhage, and no mass effect.
[**2190-2-2**]: CT Brain/Perfusion: IMPRESSION: 1.
Diffuse severe vasospasm worsened compared with the prior CTA performed [**2189-1-28**].
Slight decrease in the conspicuity of the diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage compared with the study on [**2190-1-31**]; stable intraventricular hemorrhage and the medial right thalamic hemorrhage; no new intracranial hemorrhage is demonstrated.
The CT perfusion demonstrates continued diminished blood volume within the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter infarction consistent with evolution.
[**2190-2-5**]: CT Torso-IMPRESSION:  1.
Further evaluation with MR recommended on non-emergent basis.
[**2190-2-11**]  CTA chest FINDINGS: The heart is normal in size.
Although the study was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, no abnormalities are noted within the visualized upper abdomen.
[**2190-2-21**] CT Chest: 1.
Indeterminate nodule in the right adrenal region is unchanged since CT torso of [**2190-2-5**].
ECHO [**2190-2-25**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 75%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-1-26**], the findings are similar.
LENIS [**2190-2-27**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
CTA Head [**2190-2-28**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI Abdomen [**2190-3-12**]: FINDINGS: The lesion of interest corresponds to a 1.7 x 2.4-cm round lesion in the right adrenal gland demonstrating significant loss of signal on out-of-phase images (2:4), diagnostic of adrenal adenoma.
The exam is not tailored to assess the rest of the abdominal organs, however, visualized liver, gallbladder, kidneys, spleen, and pancreas are unremarkable.
CXR [**2190-3-13**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-7**] through 17: Right lower lobe pneumonia has decreased over the past several days, although it is stable since [**3-11**].
Head CT shows SAH with IV extension.
A CTA was ordered .
Within an hour of initial examination patient became more lethargic and was intubated.
An EVD was placed emergently for obstructive hydrocephalus in the ER and patient was taken immediately to CT Head and angiogram where his R vertebral artery aneurysm was coiled.
Post-angio his Head CT was stable, patient required frequent EVD flushes.
On [**1-26**]: Head CT was done which showed a a possible left cerebellar infarct.
Stroke neurology was consulted along with cardiology for his cardiac arrest.
Echocardiogram was done which did not show any concern.
EVD flushed and TPA'd which did not help and a Nicardipine drip was initiated to bring down his pressure with no effect.
He was then sent to head CT emergently to reassess given his clinical picture and inability to get good exam due to paralysis.
His CT head showed increased IVH and worsening SAH so the Heparin drip was turned off.
On [**1-27**]: During the early morning, patient became hypertensive and tachycardic to 140s, then dropped blood pressures to 50s-70s.
An ABG showed profound respiratory acidosis, pads were placed in preparation for cardioversion.
With resolution of respiratory acidosis, his HR decreased and BP stabilized.
A head CT was done to ensure there was no displacement of the catheter, the CT head showed no change in position.
On [**1-29**]: His exam remained stable, but there remained to be no movement to his [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] MRI Cspine was added to his MRI Brain.
The MRI of the brain showed multiple areas of infarct including the cerebellum.
The C-Spine MRI showed minor C5-6 disc protrusion but no significant abnormalities.
Overnight into [**1-31**] his heart rate elevated to the 170's, he was hypertensive to the 220's, and he was placed on a labetolol drip.
A CT scan of the head was obtained which was stable and his fevers and hemodynamic status was broguht under control.
His Chest xray revealed a right lower and left lobe consolidation.
His Vancomycin level was found to be 3.3.
[**2-2**] CTA revealed moderate to severe basilar artery spasm, patient was subsequently taken for a formal angiogram which showed basilar vasosparm.
[**2-3**] CVP was 11 and was requiring fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure goals (SBP 180-200).
CSF was sent for gram stain and culture.
[**2-5**] CTA head was ordered to evaluate status of vasospasm.
A CT Torso was requested to rule out infectious process due to the patient's continued febrile state.
His hct was noted to drop and stool guiacs were negative.
Gastric lavage was negative for heme.
On [**2-16**], TCDs were done and NA levels were increased to 139, 3%NS was discontinued.
Exam remained the same off sedation, he opens his eyes and follows simple commands.
On [**2-21**] UOP began to slow down, serum NA/OSM and urine NA/OSM remained stable.
R thoracentesis was done and bronchoscopy w/ b/l BAL.
On [**2-23**] an endocrine c/s was obtained for hypokalemia and question of an adrenal mass on CT.  His methadone was increased, initiated standing ativan.
Endocrine workup pending for hypokalemia.
His morning EKG showed an increase in his QTc interval and his Triglycerides were elevated.
[**Date range (1) 86566**] he remained stable and tolerating a trach mask.

Please follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 3 Months, you will not need any imaging at that time.
You were diagnosed with an andrenal adenoma on MRI imaging during your hospital stay.
