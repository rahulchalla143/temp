He had similar abdominal pain approximately 4 days prior, and at that time, he had a CT scan without IV contrast that demonstrated a non-leaking 4 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Blacked out at home and went to Caritas HC where a CT without contrast showed leaking aneurysm and creatinine up to 5.8 from baseline 1.8.
Past Surgical History: status post nephrectomy for renal cancer, Right femoral [**Doctor Last Name **] bypass in [**2161**] and s/p thrombolysis of his graft, Right below the knee amputation, CABG x 4  in 93, appendectomy, exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions -internal hernia, biliary stenting [**2166-10-15**] EVAR for ruptured AAA   Social History: Lives by himself.
An urgent CAT scan with IV contrast performed at [**Hospital1 18**] demonstrated a contained, leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm.
BP during the procedure was initially 90-100s over 40-50s (one value to 80/40) then 110/80s.
Due to increase in creatinine from baseline of 1.8 to 5.0, nephrology was consulted on [**2166-10-15**].
A flex sig was performed at the bedside which revealed no evidence of either mucosal slough or transmural ischemia.
On [**10-19**],he was kept NPO, an NGT was placed for vomiting and a KUB was done to eval for free air.
Urine was positive for pan sensitive enterobacter cloacae.
CT abdomen on [**10-21**] demonstrated findings consistent with ileus.
The NGT output was 1L to 1.5L of gastric contents on a daily basis for the past 72 hours.
After review of the MRI and CT scans from the VA, the pancreatic mass was felt to likely be either a primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma or potential renal cell carcinoma metastasis.
Brushings obtained during the ERCP were negative for malignancy, and biopsy obtained during a subsequent EUS of the mass was an insufficient sample and thus a proper diagnosis could not be made.
On [**11-20**] AMS, hypoxic, transferred to SICU, intubated, became tachy/brady then asystolic, pulse returned w/ CPR found to have massive MI by echo put on pressors and taken to cath lab.
He continued to deteriorate with pH on ABG of <7, and Potassium at 6.7.
Negative gag reflex, neg corneal reflex and neg oculocephalic reflex.
