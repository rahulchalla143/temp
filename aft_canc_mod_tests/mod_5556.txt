The patient was monitored cautiously during the resuscitative period, and evaluated for congestive heart failure, despite the fact that her EF was greater than 55 percent, particularly because of O2 saturations in the low-90's, although this was not an initial finding on chest x-ray.
The patient received a chest x-ray which showed bilateral pulmonary edema.
Her ABG showed both a respiratory, as well as metabolic acidosis.
The patient spiked a temperature to 103.8, which prompted a fever work-up including UA, urine culture, sputum culture, and blood culture.
Over time, cultures came back with coag-negative staph in 1 blood culture, and E. coli in the urine.
On the 3, the patient underwent a speech and swallow study which she failed, and for that reason was left NPO, and left on aggressive tube feed treatment.
On the 3, it was confirmed that one of the patient's blood cultures was confirmed with Enterococcus, and the patient was started on linezolid.
She reached her baseline preoperative weight, and her Lasix was stopped.
