# Hypotension - The patient was admitted with a blood pressure 74/53.
She underwent ECHO for a cardiac source of hypotension, but was found to have normal biventricular function.
Her blood pressure remained in the 130s-160s/80s-100s.
Her blood pressure eventually stabilized in the 120s/80s.
Pancreatic enzymes were only mildly elevated, AST/ALT/bili were normal, and abdominal ultrasound and CT were negative for abdominal pathology, making an acute cholecystic, pancreatic, hepatic, or obstructive GI process unlikely.
A tTG-IgA was normal, excluding celiac disease.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**7-23**] showed mild esophagitis, gastritis and duodenitis with "feline esophagus".
An H. pylori serum antibody titer was positive.
A colonoscopy on [**7-25**] showed several small pedunculated polyps, which were excised and sent for pathological review; there was no evidence of acute malignant process.
LFTs, B12 were within normal limits.
Age appropriate cancer screening including abdominal ultrasound, CT, and colonoscopy did not reveal a source for her fatigue.
# Acute renal failure - The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 2.8 (baseline 1.0).
Urine electrolytes were consistent with pre-renal etiology.
Creatinine improved with the administration of IV fluids to below 1.0.
# Hyponatremia - The patient was admitted with a sodium of 129.
Blood glucose eventually fell to below 120 on maintenance D5NS and was below 100 by the time of discharge.
Medications on Admission: CITALOPRAM - 40 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day dose increase DILTIAZEM HCL - 120 mg Tablet Extended Release 24 hr - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day LOSARTAN - 100 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth qam METHADONE - 10 mg Tablet - 0.6 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day PROMETHAZINE - 12.5 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day as needed for trouble sleeping QUETIAPINE [SEROQUEL] - 200 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth at bedtime TRAZODONE - 50 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth at bedtime  Discharge Medications: 1. methadone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
You were initially admitted to the hospital for low blood pressure, fast heart rate and weakness.
Once we gave you enough fluid, you had a high blood pressure, which we treated with blood pressure medications.
Please continue to take your diltiazem and make sure to have your blood pressure checked by your primary care doctor at your follow-up appointment.
We performed multiple blood tests, radiologic scans, and endoscopic exams to look for the cause of your abdominal pain.
Your abdominal CT scan showed no visible problems in your abdomen, but did show a protruding disc in your spine.
Your upper GI endoscopy showed esophagitis, or inflammation of the esophagus which connects the throat to the stomach.
Your colonoscopy showed 4 benign-appearing polyps but an otherwise normal colon.
The recommendations are to have a repeat colonoscopy in 2 years from now and have a follow-up appointment with the GI team that saw you in the hospital.
We did blood tests to evaluate your fatigue, and we believe that it is most likely due to poor nutrition.
Our blood tests showed that you had poor kidney function when you arrived at the hospital, most likely due to poor liquid intake.
This is a drug that will help eradicate a bacteria that we found in your stomach called H.pylori While you are taking your prevpac, please do not take your trazodone  Followup Instructions: Department: [**Hospital3 249**] When: THURSDAY [**2127-7-31**] at 4:10 PM With: [**Company 191**] POST [**Hospital 894**] CLINIC [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 895**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Gastroenterology - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 908**] [**Hospital1 69**] [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**2127-8-15**]:20am [**Telephone/Fax (1) 463**]  Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1112**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2334**], M.D.
