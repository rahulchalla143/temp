[**2198-4-17**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
CVP was zero argued against cardiogenic shock.
Initial urine culture was contaminated; subsequent cultures were negative but sent after the start of antibiotics.
She was treated for presumed sepsis with aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain MAP >65, although CVP was persistently at 0.
Blood  cultures were persistently negative.
Urine culture from the ED was contaminated.
Given the potential for adrenal insufficiency, Cortrosyn stimulation test was done and showed adequate adrenal function.
Hypotension was completely resolved on the floor for greater than 5 days prior to [**Known lastname **] and she remained normotensive with SBP 110's to 120's.
CT head negative for acute change.
(3) Right Thigh Hematoma/Anemia:  Right obturator hematoma visualized on CT from the ED.
She required 3 units pRBC over the first 48 hours to maintain her Hct 22 to 24.
Repeat CT showed stable 8 cm hematoma with a question of an underlying mass.
She was transfused for symptoms and to maintain HCT >24.
Last transfusion [**2198-4-23**] for HCT 23.8.
CT for PE negative in the ED.
EKG in the ED with ST depressions laterally new since [**2197-9-23**].
Cardiac enzymes were trended and decreased.
She will resume Temodar as determined by her outpatient neuro-oncologist but it has been held during admission.
