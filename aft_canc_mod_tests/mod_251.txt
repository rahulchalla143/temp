Blood cultures from [**2161-4-30**] grew GPC in [**1-17**] bottles, urine cultures also positive for coag+ S. aureus.
On the evening on [**5-2**], she spiked fever to 102 through vanc and cefepime and her blood pressure trended down to 100s/60s, along with increased work of breathing.
ABG 7.42/43/83; received narcan 0.4mg, after which pt became verbal but delirious and moved all four extremities but then began salivating, with tachycardia and gooseflesh.
An ill-defined 2 cm x 2.5-cm mass was identified in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast.
- [**1-/2157**]: Ultrasound-guided biopsy demonstrated infiltrating ductal carcinoma.
One sentinel lymph node showed no evidence of metastatic cancer.

[**2161-5-7**] CTA Chest TECHNIQUE: CT of the chest was performed without intravenous contrast followed by CT of the chest post-administration of intravenous contrast, reconstructions were performed in the axial, sagittal and coronal planes.
COMPARISON: With CT of [**2160-5-20**].
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-10-14**], the images are suboptimal.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report [**5-4**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**] W & W/O CONTRAST Reason: rule out epidural abscess MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM.
Re-demonstrated is extensive osseous metastasis throughout the lumbar spine and sacrum with compression deformities of L5, T12, T11 and T10.
[**4-30**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS CTA CHEST: Again noted is widespread skeletal metastatic disease with multiple compression fractures through the spine and multiple rib fractures bilaterally at various stages of healing, with resultant deformity of the chest wall.
Lung volumes are decreased and there is likely mild fluid overload, without overt pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
While the current exam is not designed for a subdiaphragmatic diagnosis, note is again made of hypodensities in the liver, which would be consistent with metastatic disease.
Labs on day of discharge: WBC 5.4, Hct 21.3, Plt 152.
Neutrophils 81%, 0 bands.
Na 144, K 2.5, Cl 101, HCO3 37, BUN 15, Cr 0.2, glucose 111   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the ICU for management of altered mental status/respiratory distress: .
Sputum cultures at that time grew PCP and patient was started on IV bactrim.
CT scan of the chest for persistent tachycardia and respiratory distress showed no evidence of PE, but demonstrated diffuse ground glass opacities consistent with PCP.
Her CMV viral load trended downward and her PCP pneumonia is thought to have responded to therapy.
The patient has signs of persistent diffuse patchy infiltrates on CXR concerning also for fibroproliferative ARDS.
CT/MRI of the brain showed no evidence of metastases other than to the calvarium.
Despite this treatment, patient was found to have over 100,000 copies/ml of CMV in blood on [**5-17**].
CMV later found to be sensitive to Gancyclovir, suggesting initial CMV blood test insensitive to effect of Gancyclovir on count (due to presumably very high initial CMV copies in blood).
The patient will complete 21 days of additional foscarnet therapy at a reduced dose of 3000mg (reduced from 6000mg) when CMV viral load is zero.
#MSSA Bacteremia: Patient had blood cultures + for MSSA.
TTE demonstrated no evidence of valvular lesions.
She had no indwelling lines, and imaging of her lumbosacral spine showed no evidence of underlying osteomyelitis.
A TEE was attempted but due to significant kyphosis the probe could not be advance beyond the proximal esophagus.
She defervesced and culture data was only notable for sputum culture positive for Acinetobacter Baumannii sensitive to Cefepime.
After 48hrs of no blood culture growth, PICC was replaced.
CTA negative for PE.
Patient was covered with IV antibiotics as above to treat MSSA bacteremia, VAP, and PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 9359**] of the lumbosarcal spine showed no evidence of osteomyelitis.
Medications on Admission: fentanyl patch, lidocaine patch, gabapentin 100am 300 hs, senna one tab [**Hospital1 **] c olace 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], ativan 0.5-1 mg hs, decadron 2mg am 2 mg hs [**2072-4-29**], 2 mg am [**2076-5-3**], discontinue [**5-9**] asa 81 , oxygen 1 liter hs dilaudid 2 mg 1-2 tabs q3-4.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Five (5) mL PO BID (2 times a day).

Her vent settings are assist control Vt 500, RR 20, PEEP 8, FiO2 50%.
Check residuals Q4H, holding for >100ml and flushing with 300 ml Q4H.
Will need to check CMV viral load on [**2161-6-18**] and serially every 7 days if not at zero.
Electrolytes - Mrs. [**Known lastname 9355**] has required daily electrolyte replacement  secondary to electrolyte wasting with foscarnet.
She will need potassium 40 meq po three times daily, neutra-phos 1 packet three times daily, free water flushes for hypernatremia, and magnesium sulfate repletion as necessary.
Her BP can be as low as 70-80's/40's.
When awakened her blood pressure typically returns to a baseline of systolic 90s-100s.
