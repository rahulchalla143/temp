A CT scan of the chest and abdomen demonstrated 2 small left upper lobe pulmonary nodules of uncertain etiology but concerning for malignancy.
His abdominal CT demonstrated a left lower quadrant mass that on biopsy was demonstrated to be a GIST tumor that was C-kit positive.
In addition, this CT demonstrated a large mass in the right lobe of the liver that was initially thought to represent an abscess but an attempted CT guided drainage demonstrated only a small amount of blood.
The patient had a recent follow-up CT scan that demonstrated rapid and significant enlargement of the right lobe mass.
