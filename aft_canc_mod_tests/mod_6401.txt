She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup and management of the pericardial effusion.
In our ED, initial vitals were T 97.3, HR 103, BP 111/67, POs 100%.
Bedside U/S showed a large effusion with RV collapse and tamponade physiology.
An arterial groin line and venous groin line were place along with swan-ganz catheter.
Initial PCWP was 30mmHg.
Pericardicentesis showed initial pericardial pressure 30mmHg.
600cc of bloody fluid were drained and the pericardial pressure decreased to zero.
PCWP post-procedure declined to 20mmHg.
On arrival to the unit, she was sedated and intubated, with stable blood pressures of SBP 130s.
NECK: Exam limited by large neck.
CARDIAC: Exam limited by continuous rhonchi and soft heart sounds but RRR appreciated.

Cardiac tamponade- On arrival, the patient was noted to have a large pericardial effusion on bedside echo.
Fluid was sent for chemical and cytological analysis, and showed no malignant cells.
A repeat echo on [**6-30**] showed no evidence of pericardial fluid reaccumulation, with normal RV chamber size and wall motion.
LVEF was >75%.
RUL PNA- CXR at admission showed right upper lobe pneumonia, likely post-obstructive due to right upper lobe mass, and small right pleural effusion.
WBC was 12.5 at admission.
Blood cultures were pending, sputum cultures showed rare yeast and urine Legionella antigen was negative.
Patient remained afebrile throughout course and WBC trended down to normal range.
Unlikely to be cardiac etiology since echo showed normal EF and effusion was right-sided only.
Urine culture was negative.
Likely due to underlying COPD and lung pathology, as well as post-obstructive PNA.
Acid/base disturbance- ABG post cath showed pH 7.26, down from 7.34 in ED with a lactate of 1.3 and normal PCO2.
Given hypotension in the setting of cardiac tamponade, this likely reflected lactic acidosis along with respiratory alkalosis in the setting of respiratory distress.
Her most recent ABG was from [**6-29**]- pH 7.34 CO2 41 O2 87.
Cardiac enzymes negative for ACS.
Presumed ARF- Baseline Cre unknown but was 1.4 at admission.
Creatinine trended down to 0.8 by discharge.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
We stopped your  lisinopril because your blood pressure has been low, and stopped your simvastatin because it is no longer necessary.
