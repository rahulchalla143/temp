STUDIES EKGs [**2138-1-9**] 11:48 am- Probable sinus tachycardia at a rate of 145 per minute.
Compared with previous tracing of [**2137-11-12**] the heart rate has increased by 55 beats per minute and there is more marked left axis deviation.
Compared to the previous tracing earlier on the same date, the rate has decreased by 20 beats per minute, the left axis deviation is less marked, and more in line with previous tracings.

His labs were notable for 11.5 with 9% bands, and a bicarb of 21.
Chest xray showed a retrocardiac opacity.
His systolic blood pressures were in the 70s requiring levophed.
Patient is thrombocytopenic at baseline and was noted to have a plt count of 25 on admission.
Significant oozing from the catheter site was noted the following morning with a repeat plt count of 25.
In terms of other infectious workup blood cultures showed no growth x 2 days.
C. diff was negative and other stool studies were pending at the time of transfer.
Pneumonia was confirmed with a CT chest which showed multiple bilateral patchy opacities, with more confluent opacities at the left lower lobe, are likely representative of multifocal pneumonia.
Given the patient's history of mucor infection a CT of the sinus was performed which showed sinus thickening but no abscesses or bone erosion.
Patients blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of levophed on [**2138-1-10**].
His white count trended down, through he remained febrile.
Daptomycin was given on [**1-12**] given negative blood cultures and inactivated by surfactant, thus inactive in PNA so unlikely MRSA pneumonia.
# CMV: pt has CMV, viral load 1061 ([**1-10**]) and then <600 ([**1-16**]).
He will need CMV viral load checked again as outpatient on [**2138-1-21**].
CT sinuses ([**1-11**])reassuring.
C. diff toxin neg x 3, and negative stool cultures ([**1-10**]).
# MDS: Pt diagnosed with hypoplastic MDS, now D+285 s/p single cord transplant.
Received transfusions intermittently during hospitalization to keep HCT>21 and platelets >20.
#) TRANSITION OF CARE: - Needs CMV viral load checked on [**2138-1-21**], then again on [**2138-1-26**].
Once CMV viral load is negative x2 (separated by 5 days between tests), needs 14 more days of valganciclovir 900mg [**Hospital1 **].
