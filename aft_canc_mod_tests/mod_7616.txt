Finally, he lost consciousness at with increased rigidity, less spontaneous movement, and suspected seizure, treated with ativan x 6 mg and dilantin load 1.5 g.  Several aspects of his history and exam were concerning, including his fever of 101, the dysarthria and the rigidity and immobility of his limbs.
A shunt malfunction, while possible, and which can cause headache, should not cause this rigidity.
To investigate possible causes, he had cultures, UA, and CXR which were all normal.
He had LP which showed essentially normal values, including negative HSV, but did have a possibly elevated opening pressure.
The head CT looked unchanged from those from [**2140**] though making this unlikely.
An EEG was done initially which showed no evidence for ongoing seizure.
He had several repeat head CTs to look for bleeding/SAH, all of which were normal.
He then had an MRI which showed a left sided pontine stroke with extension into the right pons as well.
The MRI took 1-2 days to obtain due to complication of needing to deactivate VNS before scanning him.
Multiple cultures and chest X-rays were unremarkable.
He had therapeutic levels throughout.
All cultures remained negative and HSV PCR was negative.
The patient's brother-in-law is a physician who fully understood the medical aspects of the situation.
The patient gradually had slower respiratory rate and blood pressure and eventually expired at 12:15AM on [**2143-7-10**].
His sister [**Name (NI) 1258**] and her husband [**Name (NI) **] were notified and declined autopsy.
