came in from [**Hospital 1426**] medical apartments with a white count of 1.3  and fevers of 101.5, rigors, general malaise and fatigue.
Rest of her vitals were stable on admission and she was afebrile.
Chest Xrays in the ER were negative for infiltrates or effusions.
Bcx's grew coag negative staph, and urine cultures were negative.
CT chest performed as pt was c/o of pain near her insertion site of her Hickman Cath.
CT negative for pathology  Prior to the result of blood cultures, the pt was switched from vancomycin to daptomycin on [**7-23**] for empiric VRE coverage given pt's history of severe VRE sepsis in the past.
Given the pts immunocompromised state, additional titers were drawn for aspergillus, galactomanna Ag, Beta-Glucan, HHV6, HHV8, Parvovirus B19, BK virus, and EBV.
Tests came back positive for EBV VL of [**2140**].
Her cyclosporin doses were decreased to keep a therepeutic range of 150-200, and her prednisone was tapered down to 10 mg a day as she had no current evidence of GVHD.
Cefepime was replaced by ceftriaxone on [**7-25**] for gram negative coverage as p.aeuriginosa was not likely etiology of fevers.
continued to spike fevers, and by [**7-29**] triggered for hypotension of SBP <80.
On [**2150-7-31**], the patient developed profound abdominal distention, severe acidosis, had peak airway pressures of 70, complete anuria and hypotension despite multiple vaso-active agents.
The family was informed and an autopsy was requested.
Her creatinine on admission was 0.8.
Pt noted cloudy dark urine changes, and her UA was positive for blood, significant granular casts, and protein.
# Transaminitis/Cholestasis:  At time of admission, pt's levels were ALT 49* AST34 LDH 378*   ALK PHOS 87  and TBILI 0.6.
However, by [**7-29**] her liver enzymes had climbed to ALT 51 AST 97 LDH 758   ALk Phos 184*   Total BIli 3.9*.
RUQ US and MRCP were both negative for obstruction or evidence of intrahepatic/hepatic vasculature process.
Hemoltyc labs had haptoglobin of 184, and tbili of 2.7 (for Total bili of 3.1).
Outpatient workup had not determined an etiology.
CSA levels were titrated to be at 150-200, MMF was decreased to 500 mg [**Hospital1 **], budenoside was dc'd and prednisone was tapered to 10 mg daily with goal of being off prednisone by 2nd week.
