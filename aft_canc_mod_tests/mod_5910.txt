She underwent EGD and colonoscopy on [**11-7**] (reports above) when a L colon mass was found and biopsies taken.
Postoperative CXR's were suggestive of a R lung wedge infarct, which seemed unlikely.
Therefore a CT of the chest was performed to confirm this diagnosis(without contrast given reports of prior adverse reaction), which did not show any pulmonary infarct, but did show a RLL pneumonia.
GI was consulted on [**11-4**] for GI bleed and recommended protonix, transfusion with goal HCT >30 and EGD and colonoscopy which were performed [**11-7**].
Her Hct decreased to 25 and she received 2 units of pRBC.
Her Hct was stable throughout the hospital stay.
She had a EDG done wich showed gastritis and a submucosal lesion in the mid-esophagus.
Colonoscopy revealed two polyps and a malignant appearing mass at 45 cm.
She had a CT chest for staging and a pre-op evaluation by cardiology.
Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain was in the epigastric area.
Chest pain: Her chest pain has been chronic and did not appear to be cardiac in etiology.
Her cardiac enzyme x 1 was negative.
Stress test in [**2120**] was normal.
Her EKG was unchanged.
Her cough was improving.
Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine was 1.5 on admission, which was baseline.
Her Cr was stable at 1.4-1.5 throughout the hospital stay.
Diabetes mellitus type 2: Her Blood sugars were in the range of 80-200.
HTN: Her blood pressure was controlled while holding on metoprolol and lasartan.
Because your blood levels were low we gave you 2 units of blood which brought your blood levels back to your baseline.
You had an endoscopy and a colonoscopy.
Based on the endoscopy you were diagnosed with mild gastritis (inflammation in the stomach) which was most likely the cause of your bleeding.
