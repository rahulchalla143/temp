Blood was noted throughout the entire colon.
A large adherent blood clot was found in the cecum with surrounding oozing of bright red blood.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 73078**] is 79 year old pleasant woman with a Past medical history significant for MDS with AML transformation on Dacogen, diverticulosis, known cecal AVMs admitted from clinic on [**2195-4-1**] in the setting of a transfusion reaction to platelets with thrombocytopenia who was noted to develop bright red blood per rectum with acute hematocrit drop who underwent repeat colonoscopy showing non-bleeding diverticulosis of the entire colon and bleeding angioectasias of the cecum treated with Argon Plasma coagulation.
Specifically, repeat colonoscopy demonstrated cecal angioectasias that were actively bleeding, non-bleeding colonic diverticula and small polyp.
While on the floor, she had a few bloody bowel movements however the night of [**4-17**] she had total of 450 cc bloody watery stools which required amicar drip for 8 hours (her platelets were in the 40-50's).
Of note, her platelet count was improving already and did not require further platelet transfusions.
Platelet count was in the 90's upon discharge.
A blood bank work up was initiated, and the patient was given group specific platelets.
She did not require further platelet transfusions once her platelet count started to increase.
# MDS with AML transformation:  While the patient was on the floor, it was noticed that her blast count was trending up and her neutrophil count was trending down.
Second colonoscopy was done which showed a large clot attached to your colon in the same area where the AVM's were clipped.
Your blood level was stable as well as your blood pressure and you were transferred to the floor.
We did not discharge you on Amicar which is a clot stabilizer medication since you did not have further bloody stools, your blood level was stable and your platelets were gradually increasing.
While in the hosiptal, it was noted that occasionally your blood pressure was high and you were started on a medication for brief time.
