Hx of CABG/Mechanical MVR in [**2131**] at [**Hospital1 18**], HIV+ (dx'ed approx 7 yrs).
Blood cultures grew Enterococcus but no follow-up blood cultures drawn.
His CD4 count was checked and was 50 (Viral load checked but currently do not have these results).
CT Abd/Pelvis done with old splenic infarcts, ascites but no acute bowel pathology.
HIV (VL 175 on [**2135-6-21**])- on HAART 2.
MVR [**2131**] w/ cabg 5. left thoracotomy [**8-5**] for pleural effusion 6. cord compression/spinal stenosis w/ c4-c6 laminectomy and decompression [**10-7**] 7.
EF 40% [**2132**] 9. anemia - fe deficiency (baseline hct 30), had been worked up for pancytopenia in the past and this was when his HIV dx was discovered.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS - 96.6F  HR 67  145/70  16  100%/2L 205lbs Gen: awake, alert, NAD HEENT: PERRL, anicteric, OP clear, no evidence of thrush, small area of erythema under tongue Neck: supple, no LAD, JVP 9cm CV: regular, S1, mech S2, soft systolic murmur Pulm: Crackles bilaterally [**2-6**] way up with exp wheeze Abd: (+) BS, distended, firm, mild, diffuse TTP, no rebound or guarding Ext: WWP, 2+ LE edema b/l, 1+ DP pulse b/l skin: no rash  Pertinent Results: TEE ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2137-4-26**]: The left atrium is dilated.
LV systolic function appears depressed.
CT TORSO [**2137-4-27**]: TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are obtained with the administration of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**], 130 cc of Optiray.
Multiplanar reformation images are reconstructed.
Evaluation of the lung is somewhat limited due to motion artifact.
EGD [**2137-5-1**]: No esophageal varices.
CXR [**2137-5-1**]: PICC with tip overlying proximal portion of the superior vena cava.
EGD [**2137-5-17**]:  Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus.
Liver Biopsy Pathology [**2137-5-3**]: Liver, transjugular biopsy: 1.
Trichrome stain shows focal increased sinusoidal fibrosis.
Reticulin stain shows no definitive features of nodular regenerative hyperplasia.
Iron stain shows no stainable iron.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old male with CAD s/p CABG and mech mitral valve [**2131**], HIV+ CD4 50, DM2, transferred from outside hospital with CHF, Enterococcal endocarditis, and ascites.
Of note, OSH TTE showed possible aortic (and not mitral) vegetation which was not seen on TEE here.
Blood cultures were persistently negative.
2) GI Bleed: On [**5-1**] his Hct was noted to drop from 27 the day prior to 22.
He underwent EGD and blood was seen in the stomach as well as a Dieulafoy's ulcer, which was was ligated.
He was transfused 2 units pRBCs and Hct stabilized.
He underwent repeat EGD on [**2137-5-7**] and no active bleeding was seen.
His hematocrit continued to gradually trend down, with trace guaiac positive stools, therefore he had a third EGD, this time with colonoscopy, on [**5-17**].
On [**5-31**] the patient had another hematocrit drop to 19, with melena.
This time a tagged RBC scan was performed, which demonstrated a proximal source of bleeding, likely stomach.
He was transferred to the CCU where he had another EGD, this time with visualization of bleeding from clips at site of Dieulafoy.
Heparin was restarted on the evening of [**6-3**] and his hematocrit was stable >31 after a day.
He should have a repeat hemoglobin in 2 weeks and every 2-4 weeks thereafter.
Goal hemoglobin is [**12-16**], so if > 12, stop erythropoetin.
4) CHF: Echo at the outside hospital revealed EF 45-50%, which is likely underestimated in the setting of mitral regurgitation.
In the end, it is felt most likely secondary to liver cirrhosis with sampling error on the liver biopsy making fibrosis look less extensive than it is.
His transaminases were never elevated, though alk phos was mildly elevated at 200 (with elevated GGT).
Anti-mitochondrial antibody was negative (making primary biliary cirrhosis less likely).
He ultimately underwent liver biopsy which showed only mild portal inflammation.
Additionally, he had 2 diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis, both of which demonstrated SAAG < 1.1, with many WBC and > 250 polys.
He was already on ceftriaxone for his endocarditis, and cultures were without growth, making an infectious etiology unlikely.
CT abdomen with contrast was negative for peritoneal carcinomatosis, and cytology was negative from the ascites.
Acid fast smears were negative, though culture is still pending.
They also felt that peritoneal biopsy would be unlikely to yield the diagnosis.
His INR was stable at 3.0 on 8 mg of coumadin.
Prior to procedures, his INR seemed to be stable at 3.0 on 8 mg of coumadin.
Needs frequent INR checks until therapeutic consistently on a stable dose of coumadin.
Azithromycin for MAC prophylaxis will be considered as an outpatient (once acid fast cultures from peritoneal fluid are known to be negative).
11) Access:  He had a PICC placed on [**5-1**], confirmed in good position by CXR and in working order.
