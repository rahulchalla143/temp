Initial CXR showed a consolidation in the posterior segment of the LUL and subsequent CT Scan revealed a segmental infiltrate in the posterior segment of the LUL.
Bronchoscopy revealed BRB and there was a lesion in the posterior segment in the LUL.
This was not biopsied and cytology showed mixed cells.
Patient also underwent EGD showed that Barrett's and possible Grade I varices.

Lung mass/Hemoptysis: The patient was transferred from OSH with know endocronchial mass lesion which was identified for evaluation of hemoptysis.
Bronchoscopy on [**9-24**] showed an endobronchial mass consistent with possible carcinoid tumor by appearance.
The patient underwent repeat bronch at [**Hospital1 18**] with brush cytology, biopsy, and BAL.
Prelim biopsy thus far has revealed only normal bronchial tissue.
Gram stain from BAL showed 1+ PMNs with no organisms seen.
The patient was initially placed on TB precautions given history of nightsweats and hemoptysis but induced sputum was negative and BAL negative on concentrated smear.
Respiratory culture showed normal oropharyngeal flora only at time of discharge.
HTN: Patient initially presented with BP of 240/160 at OSH with no evidence of end-organ damage.
He was intiially admitted to the MICU to control BP with labetolol and nipride drip.
Cortisol was 2.3.
A number of labs for secondary causes including Renin, Aldosterone, Metanephrines are pending at the time of discharge although more likely etiologies for patient's hypertension include longstanding idiopathic hypertension (undetected due to lack of consistent medical care) as well as possible alcohol withdrawal.
He was maintained on a CIWA scale which was discontinued after 1 to 2 days because of low [**Doctor Last Name **].
Abnormal CT: Chest CT performed for hemoptysis revealed a 3 mm lung nodule was seen in the LLL, separate from the patient's known lesion, as well as a low-density attenuation in the right kidney thought to represent a myoleiolipoma.
A repeat CT scan was recommended by radiology in 12 months to monitor for interval change.
Patient's blood pressure still above goal but better controlled with plan for ongoing titration of BP meds as outpatient (do not want to normalize rapidly given likely long standing hypertension)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with blood in your sputum, elevated blood pressure and a mass that was identified in one of your airways.
During this hospitalization you had your blood pressure controlled with new medications and underwent repeat Bronchoscopy with biopsy of this mass.
It is very important that you keep your follow up appointment with Interventional Pulmonary so that the results of your biopsy can be followed up.
There was a small long nodule seen on your chest CT in addition to your known airway mass.
We recommend that you get another chest CT in 12 months to evaluate whether this has changed.
There was also a small nodule in your right kidney that was difficult to characterize and can also be reevaluated with the repeat CT in 12 months.
