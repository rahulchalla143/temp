Right tonsillar fossa, biopsy (A-B): Invasive squamous cell carcinoma, well to moderately differentiated, involving squamous mucosa; focal necrosis is identified.
FDG TUMOR IMAGING (PET-CT)  [**2170-1-17**]  INTERPRETATION: There is focal abnormal uptake of FDG in a right pharyngeal mucusal soft tissue mass measuring 2.2 x 2.8 cm, with an SUV max of 11.8.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2170-1-19**] 10:24 AM  FINDINGS: There is no evidence of mass, abnormal enhancement, hemorrhage, or abnormal signal intensity in the brain.
CT NECK W/CONTRAST (EG:PAROTIDS)  [**2170-1-19**] 9:51 AM  NECK CT WITH CONTRAST: Comparison was made with a prior PET CT dated [**2170-1-17**].
Direct visualization and biopsy is recommended.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2170-1-21**] 3:56 PM FINDINGS: There is a conglomerate nodal mass centered at the level of the carina, extending superiorly to the level of the aortic arch and inferiorly to the azygoesophageal recess.

[**12-23**] they did an xray chest which showed b/l LL infiltrates.The CT scan revelaed L endobronchial narrowing, mediastinal abnormalities,  extensive compression of the left main stem bronchus and the esophagus.The patient continued to have worsening respiatory status and had to placed in BiPAP,her PH at this time was 7.33 but pco2 had gone upto 82.
On [**2170-1-1**] she continued to have hypercapneic respiratory insufficiency and had to be intubated.A bronchoscopy followed demonstrating a mass above the carina,extending into the left mainstem bronchus.The right side was clear.Biopsies were taken from the area which showed non small cell lung cancer.On [**1-2**] she got a YAG laser resection of the endobronchial tumor with resultant opening of 40% of the L main stem bronchus.She also got an endoscopy which showed a benign appearing ulcer at the GE junction.No tumor was seen.A trial for extubation was made on [**1-7**] but she could not last too long of the breathing machine.
At the time of discharge the patient's nutritional status is improving, and her heart rate is well-controlled on her current cardiac medical regimen.
