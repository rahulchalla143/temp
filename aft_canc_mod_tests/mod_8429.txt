The patient was then brought to the CT department and placed supine on the imaging table.
A limited noncontrast examination of the lower abdomen was performed which again demonstrated a 4.6 x 8.1 cm (axial)air and fluid collection in the anterior abdominal wall near the midline.
The collection has increased slightly from the CT of 24 hours previously.
This may represent residual contrast medium from the previously ingested oral contrast from the CT examination of 24 hours previously.
Following administration of 6 cc of 1% buffered lidocaine to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, a 2-mm incision was made using an 11 blade.
Under intermittent CT fluoroscopic guidance, an 18-gauge [**Last Name (un) 4300**] needle was advanced and placed centrally within the fluid component of the collection.
An 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire was then coiled within the fluid collection and the needle was removed.
A sample was sent for microbiological assesment.
The collection contains hyperdense material which is of uncertain etiology but may represent delayed accumulation of oral contrast from the CT of 24 hours previously.
COMPARISON: CT abdomen [**2179-5-26**].
FINDINGS: Prior to the procedure, a non-contrast study of the upper abdomen was performed.
This again showed an anterior abdominal wall collection with measuring 4.9 x 7.2 cm (series 2, image 32).
The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure were explained to the patient and written informed consent was obtained.
The patient was brought to the CT suite and laid supine on the CT table.
Under CT guidance, an entrance site was selected.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire was advanced into the pre-existing 8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter and its placement within the collection was verified under CT fluoroscopic guidance.
