EGD [**2197-8-6**] Impression: Obliterated varices seen in the esophagus.
Erythema and congestion with mosaic pattern in the fundus and stomach body compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy Punctate erythema in the fundus compatible with gastritis Nodularity in the antrum compatible with hyperplastic polyps Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  MICRO: Blood culture [**2197-8-6**] PENDING [**2197-8-7**] 2:41 pm URINE      Source: CVS.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2197-8-8**]):    <10,000 organisms/ml.
An EGD was performed which showed an antral clot and evidence of portal gastropathy.
The patient received a total of 4 units of PRBCs and her Hct responded appropriately and remained stable.
A repeat EGD was performed on [**2197-8-8**] and it was also negative for any clear source of bleeding.
Patient's liver function was near baseline with normal bili and INR of 1.7 (baseline 1.7).
Serum tox negative.
Urine tox was positive for benzos (which she received during hospitalization).
Anion gap acidosis: Pt had a anion gap of 20 with no delta/delta, which was most likely secondary to lactate elevation due to acute blood loss and/or liver dysfunction.
Infectious work up with CXR, U/A, blood cx were all negative.
Pt was maintained on a CIWA scale however did not score on it.
# Thrombocytopenia: Plts were 257 on admission, then trended down slowly to 101, 91 and 66.
Iron defeciency anemia: Pt needs outpt follow-up for this.
Hct rose appropriately to transfusions and remained stable.
Urine and blood cultures are still pending at time of discharge.
The gastroenterologists evaluated you and performed an upper endoscopy which revealed no obvious source of bleeding.
