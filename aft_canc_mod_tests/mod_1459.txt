In the Emergency Room, the patient had a blood pressure less than 60/palp that responded quickly to normal saline boluses.
On x-ray, there was noted bilateral pleural effusions and a calcium of 15 that corrected to 17.
Echocardiogram was obtained which was normal, which showed no effusions, normal valves, and an ejection fraction of 60%.
X-ray on [**6-3**] showed complete obstruction of the entire lung field.
An arterial blood gas was obtained at that time of 7.32, 73, and 143.
Repeat thoracentesis on [**5-/2189**] yielded 1 liter of serosanguinous fluid.
Patient became promptly hypotensives to 80s/palp with a respiratory rate of 6.
Her arterial blood gas at that time was 7.23, 73, 21.
Right IJ was placed for adequate fluid resuscitation and central venous pressure monitoring.
Preceding chest x-ray showed little evidence of pneumothorax or fluid accumulation.
Chest x-ray was obtained at that time showing persistent right effusion that was tapped and showing exudate picture.
Urine output was continuously monitored, and subsequently the diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis was made, which was treated with pressors and volume resuscitation.
Empiric antibiotics were started to rule out sepsis, and the patient was pancultured, although cultures were no growth to date.
In assessing the etiology of respiratory failure, patient obtained second echocardiogram which was again normal showing normal ejection fraction and normal valve function.
A CT scan on [**6-9**] was obtained of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to assess for 1) increase in local recurrence of renal cell carcinoma, 2) the presence or absence of ascites in her belly, 3) the presence of mediastinal metastases as a possible etiology of her hypercarbic respiratory failure and chylothorax/exudate pleural effusions.
CT scan showed permanent findings of increased number of metastases in her liver as well as or her lungs bilaterally.
In comparison with previous CT scan, the multitude and size were profoundly larger.
