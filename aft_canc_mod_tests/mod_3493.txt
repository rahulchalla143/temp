U/a had WBC 2 to 5.
EKG with sinus tachycardia.
CT Abdomen was done that showed new pockets of ascitis, pelvic lymphadenopathy worse thatn prior, cirrhotic liver, enlarged portoahepatis and portocaval notes and heterogeneus prostate.
A CTA was done that was negative for PE - altough states that a suboptima IV bolus was given-.
His labs were notable for WBC 5.6, HCT 41.6 Platelets of [**Numeric Identifier 961**], INR 1.0, PTT 25.8, elevated bili 2.63 Direct 1.66, and elevated transaminases ALT 225, AST 184, alk phosphatase 165LDH 2163.normal Creatinine 1.0 Peripheral smear was reviewed with no evidence of schistocytes.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was evaluated by Hem/Onc who reviewed smear - negative schistocytes.
Bone marrow biopsy performed on Friday showed findings consistent with neuroendocrine tumor.
STAT CXR revealed worsening B/L pleural effusions.
CT chest concerning for new opacities.
ABG revealed hypoxia and he was switched to a NRB and transferred to the MICU for closer respiratory monitoring.
Extremities: No edema 2+ radial, DP and PT pulses b/l.
DT reflexes 2+/4+.
Pertinent Results: CT Abdomen [**2114-9-13**] PELVIS: There is minimal interval enlargement of prominent retroperitoneaL lymph nodes; a representative left parailiac node measures 1.6 cm (image 59  series 2), previously measuring 11 mm.
ENLARGED PORTAHEPATIS AND PORTOCAVAL NODES [**Month (only) **] BE INFLAMMATORY IN NATURE.
CT PE [**2114-7-14**]: negative for PE .
TTE [**2114-9-17**] Small left ventricular cavity with hyperdynamic function, tachycardia, moderate outflow tract gradient and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflet in the absence of left ventricular hypertrophy (suggestive of intravascular volume depletion with high catecholamine state).
CT Chest [**2114-9-17**] No pulmonary embolism.
While most of the opacities in the lung are tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**], some are morenodular and repeat chest CT may be indicated if further abdominal workup reveals underlying malignancy to rule out lung metastases.
CXR [**2114-9-19**]: No new focal consolidations are identified with increased obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm likely related to underlying atelectasis.
Preliminary BM biopsy showed evidence of neuroendocrine tumor, complicated by respiratory distress.
# Neuroendocrine tumor: Preliminary BM biopsy was consistent with neuroendocrine tumor, not lymphoma.
There was no plan for biopsy given low platelets; however MR of the abdomen showed several diffuse nodules in liver with necrosis - infectious vs lymphoma, less likely HCC.
Preliminary BM biopsy showed infiltrating carcinoma of bone marrow consistent with neuroendocrine tumor.
Hct steadily declined from baseline 43 at OSH with values slowly trending down into the mid-20s.
CTA was negative for PE.
CT chest with opacities and concern for possible infectious process, and the patient was broadly covered with vancomycin and zosyn for possible PNA.
Echo with bubble study negative for shunt.
The patients O2 requirement dramatically increased as lactate levels increased and pH decreased.
