He had some green diarrhea on the day prior to presentation and his blood sugars had been very high for the past several days (300's).
He was treated for his seizures, which were felt secondary to his elevated ammonia level.
His blood cultures at that time had coag negative staph and vanco-sensitive enterococcus.
He also had an episode of VT and an echo at the time revealed a decreased EF of approximately 40%.
Past Medical History: PMHx: - NASH cirrhosis, on transplant list - HCC - Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension - Seizure disorder - Hypothyroidism - GERD - CHF, TTE in [**2198-8-10**] demonstrated LVEF 40% with regional LV wall motion abnormalities, which was new as compared to [**3-/2198**] (EF at that time was >55%.
Doppler examination of the TIPS shunt demonstrate flow within the shunt which is wall- to-wall, however, the distal portion of the shunt shows some narrowing.
His BP improved and has since remained stable.
His chest x-ray showed no pneumonia.
He had no recurrent fevers and blood and urine cultures and stool C. diff were negative.
Given his low albumin, corrected phenytoin levels (goal 20-30) and free phenytoin levels (goal 2-2.5) were followed.
Continuous EEG monitoring x 2 days demonstrated slow background but no rhythmic epileptiform activities, ruling out subclinical seizures.
He should have a free phenytoin level checked on [**2198-11-16**] and again on [**2198-11-19**], and the results should be communicated to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3506**].

EGD on [**11-9**] showed small hiatal hernia and grade B esophagitis with contact bleeding in the lower third of the esophagus.
His hematocrit has remained stable at 29.
Acute renal failure was considered a possible contributor to elevated troponin levels, and his CK trended downwards.
His blood pressure has remained stable.
# ESLD/cirrhosis: He has a history of HCC and NASH cirrhosis, and is s/p TIPS after a GI bleed.
A RUQ US was performed on admission with some concern for TIPS stenosis.
