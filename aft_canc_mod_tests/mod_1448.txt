A soft tissue mass was noted in the mediastinum at that time, and a subsequent PET CT demonstrated abnormal uptake in this area.
The patient then underwent a bronch/mediastinoscopy with biopsy which returned as poorly differentiated carcinoma, suggestive of squamous carcinoma.
Subsequent Echocardiograms have demonstrated slight reaccumulation of the pericardial fluid but no evidence of tamponade.

Postoperatively she was transferred stable and intubated to the CSRU for further monitoring.
She was transfused PRBC's for a Hct of 26.3.
On POD #1, she was extubated without complication and had adequate oxygen saturations on 4L NC.
Pulmonary Patient's initial postoperative CXR demonstated L opacification.
An chest ultrasound was performed which did not reveal and pleural effusion.
She underwent flexible bronchoscopy on POD #2 with mild improvement of her left sided atelectasis.
She continued to improve from a respiratory standpoint and was able to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on room air prior to discharge.
Her blood pressure remained stable after initial fluid resuscitation postoperatively.
Left lower extrem swelling was noted on day of discharge -LE non-invasives were done and were neg for DVT.
