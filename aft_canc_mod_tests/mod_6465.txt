Rigid bronchoscopy at the yellow Dumon bronchoscope, Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration, Bronchoalveolar lavage of the left lower lobe, Balloon dilatation, left main stem, Stent placement.
On [**10-16**] she underwent a CT scan that revealed collapse of the left lung with partial sparing of the lingula.
On [**10-17**] she was extubated, which she tolerated well although with need for frequent suctioning, chest PT, and required therapeutic bronchoscopy for secretions on [**10-18**].
On [**10-21**] she underwent a Barium swallow to assess for the TEF, but the patient was unable to complete the study as she aspirated the Barium during the study.
On [**10-22**] she had a follow up CXR that revealed: The stent, central venous access line, and abdominal drain are in unchanged position.
#PLEURAL EFFUSION On [**10-16**] the patient underwent thoracentesis given radiologic and clinic findings that was transudative in nature, with Glucose 214, LDH 170, and total protein of 2.5.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION The patient has a history of Atrial fibrillation and was initially placed on IV diltiazem and esmolol for rate control, which was then converted to PO meds via the PEG; however, her rate was not controlled until she was digoxin loaded on [**10-19**] and her rate slowed from AF in the 120s to the 80s.
She was then placed on her home dose of digoxin 0.125 mg/day, which controlled her rate throughout her stay.
# ATRIAL THROMBUS The CT on [**10-16**] revealed a filling defect along posterosuperior wall of left atrium could represent direct extension of tumor or intraluminal thrombus.
Given this finding in the presence of Atrial Fibrillation, she underwent an echocardiogram that revealed a possible 1.1cm mass in the body of LA,Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation, Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, but normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
This should be followed in the future, and her baseline anemia is of unknown etiology.
