A recent CT scan was performed to follow stable pulmonary nodules which demonstrated growth of the right middle lobe nodule.
Given the increase in size and its stellate pattern and a prior history of smoking, he was referred for evaluation and possible workup.
Vital signs showed a temperature of 97.7, oxygen saturation 97% on room air, pulse 51, blood pressure 150/90, and weight 173 pounds.
ENT examination demonstrated no supraclavicular or cervical or thyroid masses.
His skin showed no lesions.
The thorax showed no asymmetry, masses or lesions.
Neurologic examination was grossly nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA:  CT scan was performed at the Thoracic Oncology Multidisciplinary Center.
CT of the chest performed on [**2141-6-21**] showed no evidence of right middle lobe lesions.
On [**2144-6-9**], the lesion had increased to 1.3 mm in greatest dimension, and finally the most recent CT scan of [**2144-9-8**], the right middle lobe lesion was more spiculated and increased to the size of 1.9 mm in greatest dimension.
There was diffuse thickening of the gastric wall, which is unchanged from previous CT scans, consistent with the patient's prior history of gastric lymphoma.
Temperature was 99.1, blood pressure 120/49, oxygen saturation 98% at that time on 4 liters.
His urine output was adequate.
The chest x-ray was obtained after the patient had significant signs of hypoxemia and tachypnea.
Additionally at this time, the patient was requiring Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support, as postoperatively he did have some relative hypotension and anuria.
After being supported with pressors and being volume resuscitated, his urine output seemed to turn around.
He did have some serial bronchoscopy examinations on [**2144-10-23**], which again showed significant secretions.
His urine output seemed marginal at best.
Creatinine did bump to 2.1, which was up from an otherwise normal baseline.
Ultimately at this time also it became clear that the patient suffered from a poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung with a diffuse pulmonary infiltrate seen by chest x-rays with this fever spike, having persistent pressor requirements and severe hypoxemia and an adult respiratory distress syndrome net protocol for support.
He was on broad-spectrum antibiotics as dictated by the Infectious Disease fellow, being treated with levofloxacin, vancomycin and clindamycin, although he did not suffer from a leukocytosis, as his white count at this point was 9000.
His BUN and creatinine were 54 and 2.2, and he was having persistent marginal urine outputs.
His chest roentgenography was always consistent with a possible picture of adult respiratory distress syndrome vs aspiration.
During his postoperative course for his postoperative renal failure, he was seen by the Renal service, which recommended keeping his blood pressure greater than 120 and to continue the lasix drip as we had been doing, to continue to ensure that the patient did not have any issue of pulmonary edema.
His oculocephalic reflexes were negative however.
He was seen by the Neurology service, and the impression was that his examination was remarkable for depressed cortical function with preserved brain stem function, with decreased level of consciousness, perhaps secondary to several factors.
Given the renal insufficiency, sedative and narcotic medications, an MRI of the brain was recommended to exclude metastatic disease of the brain.
His sedatives and narcotics were removed and, after approximately a 35 minute hiatus without any sedation, his examination revealed that he had fixed and dilated pupils.
