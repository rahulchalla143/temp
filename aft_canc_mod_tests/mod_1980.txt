A left frontal lobe lesion was noted on imaging and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
[**Month (only) 958**] and [**Month (only) 116**] imaging showed stable size of the lesion, though there was significant peritumoral edema.
A preliminary laboratory evaluation was performed, and revealed a leukocytosis of 11.5 with left shift (77% PMN), BUN 24, glucose 97.

Chest x-ray was read as consistent with [**Hospital1 **]-basilar atelectasis or scar, greater on the left than right.
However, the CXR is concerning for a patchy LLL opacity.
