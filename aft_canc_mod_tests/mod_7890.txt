The patient's temperature was 101 degrees Fahrenheit orally.
The patient came to the Emergency Department after several days of the above-mentioned symptoms with a temperature of 104.8 degrees Fahrenheit and an absolute neutrophil count of 0.
However, the patient's blood pressure began to drop, and the patient was started on dopamine and vasopressin.
After the patient's blood pressure increased, he was weaned off of pressors in the Intensive Care Unit; however, his fevers continued.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed the patient's temperature was 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 108, his blood pressure was 113/62, his respiratory rate was 20, and his oxygen saturation was 97% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the mucous membranes were moist.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed the patient was tachycardic but otherwise a regular rate and rhythm.
Abdominal examination revealed a left-sided scar.
Back examination revealed no midline tenderness.
Genitourinary examination revealed no evidence of lesions.
On external rectal examination, there was no evidence of lesions or exudate.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission revealed the patient's white blood cell count was 1.5, his granulocyte count was 260, and his hematocrit was 25.9.
His bicarbonate was 18.
His partial thromboplastin time was 30.6.
His INR was 2.5.
The Clostridium difficile toxin was positive.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray showed recurrence of nodular opacities, questionable atypical pneumonia.
This therapy was continued until his absolute neutrophil count was greater than 1000 for two days.
Cultures were drawn on the patient including stool and blood cultures on days [**10-29**] to [**11-2**], and urine cultures from days [**10-29**] to [**10-31**].
All of these cultures were negative with the exception of Clostridium difficile.
On [**10-31**], the patient underwent a computed tomography with contrast of the abdomen which showed no evidence of intra-abdominal abscess or bowel wall thickening.
A possible pneumonia was considered as a source of fevers; however, it was thought that the abnormalities seen on a recent computerized axial tomography were secondary to fluid overload during aggressive resuscitation in the Intensive Care Unit and nodular opacities from his malignancy.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient presented with a hematocrit of 22.
The transfusion was stopped midway through the second infusion.
At the time of his discharge, his hematocrit was 34.1.
On admission, the patient's INR level was 2.5.
At that time, his INR corrected to 1.1, and his partial thromboplastin time was 30.1.
