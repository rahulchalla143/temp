EKG [**2130-6-20**] Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2130-5-25**] no diagnostic change.

BP and sats were stable.
He was noted to be tachycardic in the PACU and EKG showed some ST depressions in the lateral leads, increased from baseline.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled and peaked at 0.14 then trended down.
