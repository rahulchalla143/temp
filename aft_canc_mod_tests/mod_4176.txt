Pt reports was in USOH until ~4wks ago when he developed a fever, non-productive cough, scratchy throat and severe SOB (+orthopnea and DOE), facial+neck swelling, cyanotic ears/lips, decreased appetite (wt loss 10-12lbs).
There, CT chest showed a large [**Location (un) 21851**] invading the R.mediastinum causing severe compression, but no occlusion of the SVC.
Labs showed AFP 1303, LDH 407, normal B-HCG.
CT guided bx showed malignant cells c/w poorly differentiated carcinoma (ddx carcinomatosis of immature teratoma within mixed cell germ tumor or poorly differentiated carcinoma with non-small cell morphology.

Other CT-guided needle biopsy [**2171-2-13**] (by dictation, original report is not available): flow cytometry negative for lymphoma, POSITIVE markers: epithelial, pankeratin, BEREP4; NEGATIVE markers: CK-7, CK-20, TTF-1, b-HCG, yolk-sac cocktail;  impression - differential diagnosis includes carcinomatosis component of the immature teratoma within the mixed germ cell tumor and poorly differentiated carcinoma with a non-small cell morphology.
CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of any prior chest imaging.
Trachea is not particularly displaced and narrowed, so the extent of mediastinal mass is not appreciated on this study and would require cross-sectional imaging for assessment.
With such a study one can distinguish cardiac tamponade from SVC syndrome, which can present with great clinical similarity.
ECHO [**2171-2-12**] OSH -normal LV size, EF, RV normal, atrial normal, no valvular abn, trace MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], impaired LV relaxation.
CT abd/pelvis OSH read: focal fatty infiltration is seen within the liver adj to the falciform ligament.
pancreas, spleen, kidneys and adrenal glands are normal in appearance with incdiental not of 2.5cm cyst from the lower pole of the R.kidney, no calcified gallstones seen, no enlarged intra-abdominal nodes seen.
Moderately dilated loops of proximal small bowel are seen with an abrupt caliber change inteh LUQ beyond which the small bowel is decompressed.
CXR [**2171-2-16**]: AP chest reviewed in the absence of any prior chest imaging.
Trachea is not particularly displaced and narrowed, so the extent of mediastinal mass is not appreciated on this study and would require cross-sectional imaging for assessment.
With such a study one can distinguish cardiac tamponade from SVC syndrome, which can present with great clinical similarity.
CXR [**2171-2-21**]: There is no significant interval change in the large right pleural effusion, although minimal decrease might be suspected most likely due to postural changes.
Vascularity within the testes appears symmetric bilaterally.
MRI could be considered for further evaluation if etiology remains uncertain.
CT Head [**2171-2-20**]: FINDINGS: There is no acute hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or large territorial infarcts.
MRI Abdomen/Pelvis: FINDINGS: On localizer images and coronal imaging, the known large right mediastinal mass is partly visualized.
A subcapsular area of signal loss is identified on out-of-phase imaging in the anterior aspect of segment IVb of the liver compared to the in-phase images, appearing to corresponding to the focal area of low attenuation identified on CT performed at outside hospital [**2171-2-11**].
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series with kinetic information.
A repeat MR study may be considered when the patient's respiratory status improves.
RESULTS REPORTED AFTER DISCHARGE: Cytology results 	 Right lung, fine needle aspirate and cell block  	(CN-10-[**Numeric Identifier 85984**], procedure date [**2171-2-13**]):  	  	POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,  	consistent with a poorly differentiated epithelioid  	neoplasm.
Pathology results: Right lung mass, needle core biopsies (CN-10-172, [**2171-2-13**], [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital, [**Location (un) 5450**], NH):      Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, see note.
Note: Tumor cells are positive for keratin and BER-EP4, and negative for TTF-1, PLAP, calretinin, CD30, CK20, and CK7.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 42 y.o male with no PMH who presented with SOB/fever/cough/weight loss/SOB and was found to have SVC syndrome and a mediastinal mass.
CEA was <1 and CA [**80**]-9 was within normal at 4.
HCG was <5.
Patient's alpha fetal protein level was 1310 on [**2-16**] and 1286 on [**2-22**], leading the oncology team to be concerned that he would need a different regimen as an outpatient, including possible Bleomycin.
Metastatic work-up did not reveal disease in the head or abdomen though there were abnormal CT abdomen findings as attached.
A testicular ultrasound found only heterogenous abnormalities, if anything, most consistent with lymphoma.
CT abdomen revealed focal fatty infiltration near the falciform ligament.

The blood clot and obstructing of the veins in your neck were caused by a cancer in your chest.
You will probably have to have your blood checked for alpha fetal protein at that time.
