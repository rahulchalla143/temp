Brief Hospital Course:   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74y/o gentleman with h/o mitral and aortic valve replacements [**1-12**] rheumatic heart disease, A fib s/p ablation and BiV pacer, systolic CHF (EF 40%), HTN, HLD, COPD, CKD baseline Cr 1.6, obesity who presented with epigastric/chest pain and abnormal stress test.
His cardiac cath showed no disease requiring intervention.
Due to his mechanic valves, he needs to be anticoagulated (INR 2.5-3.5), so while he was admitted and on a Heparin drip for his cardiac cath, the decision was made to perform EGD/colonoscopy to investigate a S.bovis blood culture from 1 year prior.
Colonoscopy showed 3cm polyp at rectosigmoid junction, which was removed (path negative for malignancy).
CXR for NG tube placement suggested free air under the right diaphragm.
Upon admission to the surgical floor, his vital signs have been stable.
His Coumadin was resumed at his preop dose and his INR is in the 2-2.5 range.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] continues to expel some bloody drainage from his rectal hematoma and his hematocrit has been in the 23-25 range since [**2123-10-28**].
