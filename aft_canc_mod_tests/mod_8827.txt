He had an echocardiogram which showed severe aortic stenosis and an EF of 55-60%.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] and underwent cardiac catheterization on [**10-30**], which showed an A-V gradient of 63 mm Hg and aortic valve area of 0.35 cm squared, right coronary artery was 60% stenosed proximally, left main to be normal, left anterior descending artery with 60% stenosis in the mid vessel and left circumflex normal.
His vital signs showed his heart rate to be 77, blood pressure 132/71, respirations 20, and O2 saturation 97% on 1 liter nasal cannula.
His neck is supple with no JVD, no bruits, and carotid pulses are 1+ bilaterally.
His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
DP and PT pulses are by Doppler bilaterally, and his radial artery pulses are 2+ bilaterally.
His neurologic examination shows him to be alert and oriented times three and to be grossly intact.
LABORATORIES:  White count of 7.2, hematocrit of 30.6, platelet count of 181,000.
Sodium 139, potassium 4.2, chloride 107, CO2 26, BUN 26, creatinine 0.9, and glucose of 115.
PT was 12.8, INR of 1.1, PTT 34.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2109-10-31**], patient underwent carotid ultrasound which showed bilateral internal carotid stenoses of less than 40%.
On postoperative day #2, he was noted to have decreasing cardiac index over the course of the day, and a cardiac echocardiogram was ordered.
This revealed global hypokinesis with an EF of about 40%.
He did receive CT of the head which showed evidence of right MCA stroke, but no bleed.
It was recommended at that time that his systolic blood pressure be kept in the 140s-160s, and that he be Heparinized.
He was cardioverted to sinus rhythm with 200 joule shock because the AFib was concurrent with the increasing cardiac index and he did return to sinus rhythm.
They were able to take off approximately 800 to 1000 cc from the left and 500 cc from the right.
His followup chest x-ray showed no signs of pneumothorax.
He was then felt to be ready for discharge to rehab, but overnight period of postoperative day #17, he was noted to have a heart rate in the 30s-40s.
He had his amiodarone and Lopressor D/C'd and his heart rate remained in the 40s to low 50s.
His discharge examination shows him to be alert.
Laboratories on discharge include a white count of 9.7, hematocrit of 30.7%, platelet count of 266,000.
Sodium was 134, potassium 4.7, chloride 101, CO2 27, BUN 21, creatinine 1.3, and a glucose of 92.
His chest x-ray did show small bilateral pleural effusions.
