On [**2139-7-2**], his white blood cell count was noted to be 21,000.
A bone marrow biopsy confirmed pre-B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia positive for [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome.
A lumbar puncture was positive for lymphoblasts.
He developed blurry vision on [**2140-2-8**], a head magnetic resonance imaging scan at that time was without abnormalities.
An lumbar puncture on [**2140-2-9**] showed recurrence of leukemia in his cerebrospinal fluid and he has received three doses of Methotrexate, Solu-Medrol, Ara-C intrathecal chemotherapy ([**2-10**], [**2-12**], and [**2-15**]).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.9, pulse 104, blood pressure 118/72.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Oral mucosa moist, oropharynx clear.
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies on admission revealed white blood cell count 0.9, granulocyte count 510, hematocrit 30.4, platelets 74.
MCV 92.
Sodium 139, potassium 2.4, chloride 103, bicarbonate 26, BUN 11, creatinine 0.6, glucose 99.
ALT 186, AST 64, LDH 228, alkaline phosphatase 59, total bilirubin 0.5, direct bilirubin 0.1.
[**2140-2-15**], cerebrospinal fluid, 5 white blood cells, 23 red blood cells, 5 mono, 91% lymphocytes, 86% blasts, total protein 29, glucose 58.
Gram stain, no polys, no microorganisms, fluid culture negative, fungal culture pending, acid fast bacillus culture pending.
[**2140-2-5**], echocardiogram, left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%, trivial mitral regurgitation.
The patient had a bone marrow biopsy on [**2140-2-19**].
During the receipt of Cytoxan the patient's electrocardiogram and urinalysis was monitored.
The patient's urinalysis was noted to be positive for blood on [**2140-3-1**].
Given concern that the drip represented cyclophosphamide induced interstitial nephritis, the patient was aggressively hydrated and repeat urinalyses were negative.
The patient was started on Cyclosporin drip per protocol and levels monitored and adjusted to goal Cyclosporin level of 500.
On that same day his blood pressure dropped to 70/40 with a heart rate of 130s, (baseline systolic blood pressure 100 to 120, heart rate 70 to 90).
The patient responded well to normal saline boluses, and since that time the patient's heart rate and blood pressure have remained stable.
Mucositis - Ulcers were noted over his lips at admission with progressive swelling.
Additional workup included an ultrasound of his liver which showed no evidence of abnormalities in the gallbladder or biliary ductal system but showed fatty infiltration of his liver.
Hematology - The patient's blood counts were supported with transfusion for hematocrit less than 30 or platelet less than 30 given severe mucositis.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition on [**2140-3-3**] given poor p.o.
The patient's ins and outs were closely monitored while receiving chemotherapy, and he was given intermittent Lasix.
On [**2140-2-18**], Surgery repositioned the catheter as it was curled as a chest x-ray had shown that it was improperly positioned.
