Head CT was done, which revealed a significantly sized right fronto-parietal mass, and he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive neurosurgical care.

CT Head(post-op): showing appropriate resection and decompression.
Head CT [**11-28**]: area of hypodenisity within the right MCA distribution.
Head CTA/P [**12-2**]: 1.
Perfusion study demonstrates decreased cerebral blood volume in the right MCA territory with increased MTT, consistent with prior right MCA infarct.
The patient was morbidly obese and was unable to undergo an MRI because he was over the weight limit.
His CT scan revealed a 7.5 x 5.3 cm mass in the right middle and anterior cranial fossa with midline shift and uncal and subfalcine herniation.
The patient remained intubated and was brought directly to CT for a post-op scan.
His exam improved and he was able to follow commands when the sedation was turned off.
His dilantin levels were monitored and adjustments made as indicated.
It was further noted that his serum sodium levels were becoming more elevated(153), so he was started on 100cc of free water q6h.
Further imaging showed a RLL consolidation and a right mca hypodensity.
Perfusion studies were performed for hypodensity on CT.
A blood gas was obtained and he was found to be hypercarbic acidosis.
After further titration of his non-invasive support, his acidosis was corrected, and mental status improved.
