CT abdomen/pelvis [**6-12**]:  INDICATION: 82-year-old man with end-colostomy for bladder tumor, now with nausea, vomiting and higher nasogastric tube output.
COMPARISONS: CT from [**2144-4-28**] and more recent radiograph from [**2144-1-11**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial non-contrast CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained with oral but not intravenous contrast, and sagittal and coronal reconstructions were also performed.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right than left, of low density with associated parenchymal opacities, most likely represent atelectasis.
The liver, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are within normal limits.
However, the distal small bowel is again moderately dilated to a similar extent as on a plain film from two days ago.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The rectal stump appears diffusely thickened, as noted previously.
COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis, [**2144-6-12**].
Findings suggestive of high-grade small-bowel obstruction  CT w/o contrast [**2144-6-19**]:  HISTORY: 82-year-old male with bladder cancer status post partial colectomy and colostomy, suspected ileus/obstruction.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the symphysis pubis without the administration of IV contrast.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Visualized heart and pericardium reveal no evidence of pericardial effusion.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is persistent thickening along the anterior right side of the bladder.
Previously noted metastatic nodule in the pelvis is not as well appreciated on this study likely due to technical reasons.

**FINAL REPORT [**2144-6-26**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2144-6-26**]):       STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
A CT ABD was done on [**2144-6-12**] and showed persistent dilatation of the small bowel, without a discrete transition point.
The NGT output decreased over the next several days and he began having scant thick brown stool output from the ostomy.
He had a NGT clamp trial and the NGT was removed on HD 5.
His abdominal exam was remarkable for significant distension, tympany and hypoactive bowel sounds.
VS: 95% NRB HR 71 142/76 RR 30.
ABG 7.41/27/107/18 and CXR showed no clear infiltrates but looked like left pleural effusion.
His coumadin was restarted and INR was 2.2 on [**6-21**].
An investigation of PE was not pursued as a clear cause of desaturation existed and hypoxia resolved.
CXR on [**6-21**] showed persistent cardiomegaly which was stable, bilateral pleural effusions and a left retrocardiac opacity.
Patient was weaned from NC O2 to room air with saturations of > 94%.
A repeat CT was performed on [**6-22**] showing  1.
A consultation was obtained for possible radiation therapy and this was not deemed to be a viable option due to the extent of the disease.
# Elevated INR: INR continued to be elevated despite administration of Vitamin K.  A hematology consult was obtained.
They felt the possible causes of the patient's elevated coagulation studies include Coumadin overdose, malnutrition, and excessive heparin response; less likely possibilities include liver failure and acquired coagulation factor deficiencies.
- No further VitK administration at this time as INR normalized following IV VitK.
With this regimen, patient's INR became subtherapeutic and pt was restarted on 5mg of coumadin QD.
Subsequently INR was elevated on [**6-25**] and [**6-26**] at 4.2 and 4.9 respectively.
His INR should be monitored and coumadin regimen adjusted to ensure target of 2 - 3.
Once the INR stabilized, he was restarted on his Coumadin dose and his INR was monitored closely (please see above for anticoagulation discussion).
The edema was likely related to metastatic disease, CHF (LVEF 25 - 30% from [**1-16**]) and low albumin.
His feet were elevated and foot care was performed.

Patient will also require PT/OT evaluation and treatment.

Release 24 hr [**Month/Day (2) **]: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
You coumadin was held during [**6-25**] and [**2144-6-26**] to allow normalization of INR (it was too high).
You will require daily INR monitoring and adjustment by the staff at the facility.
HTN and kidney disease medication - please HOLD your lisinopril dose until you follow-up with your PCP.
Pt required daily INR and coumadin dose adjusted as needed 2.
It is recommended that patient undergo PT/OT evaluation and treatment to improve functional status 6.
