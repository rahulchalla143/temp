MRI was obtained and demonstrated post surgical changes with residual enhancement.
ECG ([**2126-3-9**]): Sinus rhythm.
Early R wave progression  CXR ([**2126-3-10**]): There are low lung volumes.
EEG ([**2126-3-9**]): This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of runs of focal slowing involving both anterior quadrants with extension to the left posterior temporal lobe.
