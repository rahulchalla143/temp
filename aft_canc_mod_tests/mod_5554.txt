A preoperative stress echocardiogram on [**7-18**] showed a reversible moderate inferior wall perfusion defect, mild apical perfusion defect, ejection fraction of 48%, no wall motion abnormalities.
Review of systems reveals occasional dyspnea, questionable angina with exertion.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Captopril 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], atenolol 50 q day, isosorbide dinitrate 20 [**Hospital1 **], Senna [**Hospital1 **], Betoptic one drop OD [**Hospital1 **], Humulin N 30 units q am and 5 units q pm.
EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vitals:  Temperature 97.5, heart rate 60, blood pressure 142/80, respirations 16.
There is a dorsalis pedis and PT pulses are 2+ bilaterally.
Chest x-ray from the [**7-12**] showed a small right pleural effusion, a nodular opacity in the right upper field, bibasilar interstitial opacities, no evidence of congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia at 49.
Echocardiogram shows ejection fraction of 48% per the history of present illness.
Admit laboratories:  ALT 25, AST 10, alkaline phosphatase 113, amylase 51, lipase 49, total bilirubin 0.3, uric acid 5.9.
White count 6.4, hematocrit 31.2, platelets of 138.
PT of 13.0, PTT 27.0, INR 1.2.
Sodium 145, potassium 4.3, chloride 110, CO2 28, BUN 29, creatinine 1.6, and glucose 125, albumin 3.4, calcium 9.0, phosphorus 3.2, and magnesium 2.0.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent exploratory laparotomy and ileocolectomy at the ileocolonic anastomosis as well as a small bowel resection.
His blood loss is 300.
Postoperative, the patient's temperature is 95 po, his heart rate was 50-60, blood pressure 187/70, respirations 15 and again he was given IV Lopressor, nitropaste.
He was continued on his captopril and isosorbide and plan was to begin a nitroglycerin drip if his systolic blood pressure increased over 150.
Postoperative day one, the patient was continued on Lopressor, Captopril, and Isordil for blood pressure control.
His hematocrit was stable.
His blood pressure is in the 170s sinus tachycardia, ST depression in V3 through V5.
Cardiology saw the patient and recommendations were to cycle cardiac enzymes to rule out ischemia and to recommend aspirin from a cardiac perspective, to proceed with diuresis to control heart rate and blood pressure with beta blocker and ACE, nitroglycerin, and Morphine.
CK was 974 with a MB of 12 and troponin of less than 0.3.
Check his echocardiogram to evaluate for systolic function, diurese to goal of [**11-21**] liters negative for the day, follow CKs.
Echocardiogram obtained today showed an ejection fraction of 40%, 2+ mitral regurgitation, and anteroseptal hyperkinesis.
This morning he was on 60% and his saturations dropped to the low 90s throughout the morning.
