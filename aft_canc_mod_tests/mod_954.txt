Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-12-21**], left ventricular systolic function is now significantly worse with new anteroseptal and anterior akinesis/hypokinesis.
EKG [**2188-2-6**]: Atrial fibrillation Ventricular premature complex Modest nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T abnormalities Anteroseptal myocardial infarct, age indeterminate - possible acute/recent/in evolution Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities Since previous tracing of [**2188-2-5**], further ST-T wave abnormalities present .
Patient was also found to have a silent STEMI, with V3 elevation and elevated CE.
Upper GI bleed: Patient's UGI bleed was likely [**1-24**] NSAID use combined with recent prednisone for CHOP.
Patient was transfused several units while in the MICU for hematocrit drop from 29.9 to 20.8 on presentation.
Patient had an NG lavage performed, which did not clear after 1000cc NS were infused.
An emergent upper endoscopy demonstrated ulcers in the antrum and stomach body, lymphoid hyperplasia in the duodenal bulb, and mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus.
Biopsy wasn't performed at the time due to concern for increased bleeding.
He had serial hematocrits checked, and was stable for 48 hours prior to discharge.
Patient was scheduled for outpatient endoscopy to reassess the ulcers, and for biopsy of the lymphoid hyperplasia.
He will have serial hematocrits checked by home VNA.
Patient's cardiac enzymes were trended, and he was found to have continued upward trend in troponin to peak 2.24, with gradual decrease in CK and CKMB.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed, which showed global hypokinesis and a depressed EF from 40% to 30-35%, possibly from stunned myocardium.
He will need a stress test as an outpatient.
His electrolytes were monitored carefully and repleted.
