Status post lumbar puncture 2.
Right femoral popliteal bypass   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 66264**] is a 57 year old man with a history of melanoma status post excision in [**2181-7-14**], lung nodule on CXR 2-3 months ago, as well as history of deep vein thrombosis, peripheral vascular disease and hypothyroidism who transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-4**] for workup of a cold, blue right foot.
On Saturday [**11-4**], he went for an MRI of his right foot and leg.
Lung nodule on Chest CT 3 months ago at [**Hospital 487**] Hospital 3.
Deep vein thrombosis [**2179**] 4.

CT brain: 10/22/061.
An MRI would be of further utility in evaluating for additional nonvisualized metastatic lesions as well as infarction.
MRI [**2181-11-4**]: 1.
MRI [**2181-11-23**]: Left MCA stroke with underlying history of melanoma.
T1-weighted axial and sagittal images are performed through the brain following intravenous gadolinium administration.
Comparison is made to the prior exam from [**2181-11-4**].
The examination is significantly degraded due to patient motion and patient shaking during the exam.
This corresponds to the previously seen area of infarction from the previous exam of [**2181-10-14**].
The examination does not exclude the presence of metastatic disease.
A repeat examination would be recommended preferably with sedation for further evaluation of the brain parenchyma.
Overall, the exam remains degraded by motion artifact and repeat study with gadolinium administration using MP-RAGE protocol would be recommended for further evaluation.
Imaging studies demonstrated a subacute infarction in the left posterior MCA/PCA territory along with multiple lesions suggestive of metastatic disease, question melanoma.
Outside pathology confirmed incidence of malignant melanoma ([**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1105**]) on his back from that was removed with negative lymph nodes in [**7-19**].
A Neuro-oncology consult was obtained and workup for potential source of metastatic appearing brain lesions was performed.
On [**11-6**], a CT torso was negative; notably, it did not show evidence of the pulmonary nodules seen previously at [**Hospital3 **].
On [**11-7**], a bone scan was negative for osseious disease.
A brain biopsy was recommended.
A WAND study of the brain was conducted on [**2181-11-22**], and due to changes in the parietal lesion, which was more wedge-shaped and consistent with infarct, the decision was made to reimage the brain via MRI with and without contrast and MR spectroscopy with plan to discharge Mr. [**Known lastname 68587**] to rehab and have him follow-up with the [**Known lastname **] and Neurosurgical teams.
In regards to his initial presentation, seizures were considered a possible explanation for his behavioral changes.
EEG was abnormal but without epileptiform activity.
ECG showed changes suggestive of old infarct.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
Cardiac echo was unremarkable.
Urine, blood cultures and CXR were unremarkable.
CXR, urine cx, and blood cx from [**2181-11-20**] were also unremarkable.
