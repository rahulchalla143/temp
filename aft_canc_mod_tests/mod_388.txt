Head CT showed small area of hemorrhage over [**1-12**] gyri on the right infereior frontal lobe which was read as either artifact or possible extra-axial hemorrhage and neurosurgery was consulted who recommended repeat head CT in 24 hrs or with any clinical decline.

The remainder of the study is unremarkable with no other areas of intracranial hemorrhage.
A followup CT would be helpful for clarification.
CXR: FINDINGS: Single bedside AP examination labeled "upright" with excessive lordotic positioning dated [**2174-2-27**].
IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited study with bibasilar atelectasis, but no other acute process.
Repeat CT Head: FINDINGS: In comparison with the prior study, the previously described small linear focus of high attenuation adjacent to the right inferior frontal gyri is no longer visualized.
Ill-defined opacity in the periphery of the left lung base appears similar to recent chest radiographs but is new compared to the older study of [**2174-2-27**].
If there are classic symptoms of infection, recommend followup chest x-ray in four weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy.

On CT found to have scarring and emphysematous change.
Fevers/Leukocytosis/Urinary Tract Infection WBC count rose after transfer to floor.
Blood/urine Cx positive as above.
Given positive blood cx as above, pt was started on vancomycin, repeat cultures have been subsequently negative.
The sensitivities to the coag neg staph were pending as of this dictation but it was decided that the patient would complete a 14 day course of abx treatment (initially with vanc and cipro) transitioned to bactrim.
Cerebral hemorrage Initial imaging showed an area of attenuation concerning for extra-axial hemorrhage.
Repeat imaging showed resolution of these findings.
