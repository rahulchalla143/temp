In the ED, initial vs were: T: 99 P: 108 BP: 131/81 R: 16 O2 sat 99% on RA.
He had a CXR which showed mild [**Date Range 1106**] prominence but no focal infiltrates.
He had an xray of his right hip which was negative for fracture and a non-contrast head CT which showed no evidence of hemorrhage.

IMAGING [**11-5**] HIP XR IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation with degenerative changes at the hips bilaterally and extensive atherosclerotic disease with right femoral stents.
CXR Progression of mild pulmonary edema and redemonstration of large  cardiomegaly.
[**11-6**] CT HEAD 1.
CT UPPER EXT 1.
Focal thickening of the right aortic cusp that appears unchanged from prior study [**2174-3-14**].
[**11-9**] CXR As compared to the previous examination from [**2174-11-5**], a  PICC line has been inserted over the right upper extremity.
[**11-10**] MRI SPINE Though the evaluation for spine infection is quite limited in the absence of gadolinium and further, by the significant motion degradation of image quality, 1.
[**11-17**] CXR Cardiomegaly persists.
Left basilar and retrocardiac opacification is consistent with atelectasis although a pneumonitis from aspiration or infection can certainly be superimposed.
Peribrochial cuffing, cephalization, and a small left pleural effusion suggest continue volume overload/congestion.
MRI SPINE There is continued suspicion for question of septic arthritis of  the right facet joint at L4-5 level with a small epidural and paraspinal fluid collection.
Gadolinium-enhanced repeat study possibly under anesthesia is recommended to get better evaluation of the abnormality.
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at the time of interpretation of this study on [**2174-11-19**] at 12:30 p.m. .
[**11-21**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-3-14**], the regional left ventricular systolic dysfuntion is more extensive c/w interim ischemia.
MRI L-SPINE 1.
Suspicious finding on the recent non-enhanced examinations is demonstrated to represent a 2.5 cm (CC) relatively thick rim-enhancing fluid collection, centered at the L5 level, dorsal to and significantly compressing the thecal sac.
Pathologic T2-hyperintensity within the L3-4 through L5-S1 discs, without definitive discal enhancement or endplate destruction; this may be degenerative in nature.
CXR .
In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube, that extends well into the stomach.
[**11-22**] CXR In comparison with the study of [**11-21**], the monitoring and support  devices remain in place.
[**11-23**]  In comparison with the study of [**11-22**], the monitoring and support devices remain in place.
CT HEAD 1.
[**11-24**] CXR As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.
[**11-28**] CXR In comparison with the study of [**11-27**], there has been a substantial increase in bilateral pulmonary opacifications in this patient with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and evidence of midline sternal wires.
CXR Marked improvement of previously existing pulmonary edema.
The previously identified epidural collection at L5 level is not visualized in this examination, correlation with MRI is recommended, since CT is not able to provide the same anatomical detail in the thecal sac.
EEG [**11-22**] This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling showed a mild to moderately slow and disorganized background consisting of mixed theta frequencies.
Routine sampling showed a mild to moderately slow and disorganized background with occasional periods of burst suppression.
His cultures cleared after the first positive set and his SC joint infection improved clinically.
CT [**Doctor First Name **]/ortho were consulted but felt that he was not a good surgical candidate for debridment of the joint given his hx of CABG.
He will complete an 8 week course of Cefazolin 2g IV q8 (day1=[**2174-11-8**]) and should follow-up with ID on discharage and should also obtain weekly safety labs (CBC/diff, BUN, Cr, LFTs, ESR, CRP) while on antibiotics (next set of labs due [**12-10**]).
# s/p cardiac arrest: During MRI scan for assessment of back pain patient went into cardiac arrest.
EEG and head CT were unremarkable.
TTE was initially concerning for new wall motion abnormalities suggesting an ischemic etiology, but EKG showed no evidence of ACS and CE remained flat.
MRI was performed and was concerning for epidural abscess as well as R paraspinal muscle abcesses by MRI, however the study was inadequate.
Pt underwent MRI under anesthesia in attempt to obtain a better study, however arrested in MRI scanner.
# chronic atrial fibrillation: His coumadin was initially held on admission due to supratherapeutic INR and then [**2-14**] GI bleed.
EGD showed a single, clean base, 2.5cm x3cm non-bleeding ulcer with blood clot in the antrum.
His hematocrit subsequently stabilized and he had no further coffee ground emesis at the time of his transfer back to the floor, however his Hct was seen to slowly drift downwards and he received another unit of blood before discharge to the floor.
EGD and colonoscopy were deferred in the hospital given his instability, however he is scheduled for EG/colonoscopy on discharge and will also be discharged on a PPI.
His Metoprolol and lisinopril were titrated to BP control prior to discharge, pressures in 120s-130s on discharge however may need further titration as an outpatient for optimal control.
He was re-hydrated and his kidney function improved and remained normal throughout the admission.
Has had minimal insulin requirements as an inpatient, however QID blood glucose was initially continued due to poor nutrition and hypoglycemia.
#) Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Pt had some evidence of volume overload on CXR and by exam throughout the admission.
Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) 50,000 unit Capsule [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Capsule PO once a week.
Release 24 hr [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for nausea.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Bacteremia - Sternal/spinal MSSA osteomyelitis - Antral ulcer with bleeding - Acute blood loss anemia - Acute renal failure - Cardiac arrest  Secondary: - Right pleural thickening NOS - CAD s/p CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, and SVG-OM) - Chronic systolic heart failure (40%) - Atrial fibrillation - Small secundum ASD/PFO - Left retinal artery occlusion - Peripheral [**Hospital1 1106**] disease - s/p bilateral hallux amputations - Chronic right foot ulceration - Hypertension - Anemia of chronic disease - Diabetes mellitus type II   Discharge Condition: stable but frail   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for falls and you were found to have bacteria in your blood, therefore you were treated with intravenous antibiotics.
In the intensive care unit, you were stabilized and eventually returned to the medicine floor, where we decided to delay further imaging or surgery of your spine given the high risk of intervention.
[**First Name (STitle) **] BLOOD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**] Date/Time:[**2174-12-12**] 11:00 .
You will need safety labs including CBC/diff, BUN, Cr, LFTs, ESR, CRP on [**12-10**], and every week thereafter while on abx.
You will also need to be readmitted to the hospital in 6 weeks for follow-up imaging of your spine given your epidural abces.
