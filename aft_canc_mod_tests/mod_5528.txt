CXR [**9-6**]: Right hilar mass, with associated airspace opacity within the right upper lobe.
Further evaluation with a CT scan is recommended.
CT Pelvic [**9-6**]: 1.
Right hilar mass noted on chest x-ray was not imaged on this abdominal CTA.
Renal US [**9-6**]: 1.
Further evaluation with a CTA study is recommended.
CAROTID U/S [**9-8**]: No plaque or wall thickening of either carotid artery.
CHEST CT [**9-7**]: 1.
Lack of perfusion of right kidney secondary to previously identified thrombus.
Echo [**9-8**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
L-spine film [**9-10**]: 1.
Likely small fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm which was seen on the prior CTA abdomen of [**2144-9-6**].
CT Head with Contrast [**9-12**]: Single focus of low density within the white matter of the right frontal lobe likely representing chronic microvascular infarct.
CXR [**9-14**]: 1.
RUQ US [**9-14**]: No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
The CT scan found a 7cm mass in the right lung which invades into the SVC and right mainstem bronchus.
Thoracic surgery was consulted for a fine needle aspiration of the supraclavicular node for diagnosis and to see if she was a surgical candidate.
A bone scan was to be performed to look for bony mets on day of discharge, but this was discontinued secondary to a change in the patient's treatment goals (see below).
A chest x-ray showed pulmonary effusions and a RUL infiltrate suggestive of post-obstructive pneumonia vs lobe collapse.
The patient remains afebrile but her WBC was elevated to 20K on discharge from 16K and 18K a fews days prior.
Her hypercalcemia was causatively linked to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
Once they were within normal limits, her sodium levels dropped to normal range and she was no longer delirious.
She was cleared by a speech and swallow evaluation and placed on soft foods and thin liquids along with Boost supplementation per nutrition recommendations.
Her renal function is still within normal limits.
Leukocytosis - The patient's WBC was stable around 16K on levofloxacin and metronidazole for her diverticular abscess.
Work up showed no urinary tract infection (patient had foley cath in place for close monitoring of ins/outs for DI treatment) and a RUQ ultrasound showed no cholecystitis (patient had RUQ pain on exam on the day prior to discharge.
The chest x-ray the night prior to admission showed possible post-obstructive pneumonia which may account for her increased WBC.
Anemia - iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Her Hct remained stable throughout admission.
Rheumatoid arthritis - The patient was not taking medications at admission and treatment was defered.
During admission, the patient complained of lower back pain and a lumbar spine x-ray showed only an old compression fracture of L1.
A bone scan was to be performed to look for bony mets on day of discharge, but this was discontinued secondary to a change in the patient's treatment goals.
