PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission were a temperature of 97.4, pulse 60, respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 75/48, that increased to 93/51 after a 3 liter normal saline bolus, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, hematocrit 30.9 which was decreased from 40.9 on [**2188-8-8**].
He was also hyponatremic, with a sodium of 127, likely due to volume contraction from nausea and vomiting.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy done on [**8-26**] showed diffuse friability, erythema and edema, with nodularity and ulceration of the mucosa with contact bleeding in the pre-pyloric region and antrum, with narrowing of the pylorus secondary to edema.
Repeat endoscopy on [**8-29**] showed erosive gastritis with ulcerations as well as an ulcerated bleeding 3 to 4 cm mass of malignant appearance in the distal antrum causing a partial gastric outlet obstruction.
Biopsy results revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast revealed circumferential thickening of the gastric antrum, consistent with the patient's stated history of a pre-pyloric mass.
Electrocardiogram on [**9-1**] showed wandering atrial pacemaker with normal rate, sinus rhythm.
Bone marrow biopsy was done on [**9-4**], the results of which are still pending.
An echocardiogram on [**9-3**] showed an ejection fraction greater than 55%, essentially normal left ventricle, normal right ventricle, trivial mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion.
On examination, he had a temperature of 99.2, heart rate of 80, blood pressure of 110/70, breathing at a rate of 20, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
His rhythm was irregular, pulse in the 80s.
His lungs were clear to auscultation in the upper lobes bilaterally, but decreased breath sounds in bilateral lobes.
His laboratories on transfer showed a white count of 8.5, hematocrit of 31.8, platelets of 277.
PT 12.8, INR 1.1, PTT 20.8.
Sodium 137, potassium 4.1, bicarbonate 25, BUN and creatinine 16 and .7, glucose 144.
Calcium 7.5, phos 3.4, magnesium 1.6.
LDH 408.
For his deep venous thrombosis, the PICC line was removed, and he was started on heparin and Coumadin, to be titrated to therapeutic levels.
On discharge, the patient was stable, with a hematocrit of 26.3, which had been stable for several days.
We were aiming for a PTT between 50 and 80.
