In the ED, initial vs were: T97.7 rectal, P70, BP66/43 -> 93/53, R13-20 O2 sats 80s on RA, 100% on 3L.
Patient was given ceftriaxone and vancomycin; calcium gluconate, 1 gram, D50 and insulin, kayexalate 60 g, and levophed gtt started for hypotension.
BP in upper 90s.
Lab abnls included lactate 10, severe metabolic acidosis (bicarb 8, pH 7.24), WBCs 18.8 with 17% bands, elevated coags with low plts, ARF, hyperkalemia to 7.4, transaminitis with hyperbilirubinemia.
QRS 106 on ECG, no peaked T waves.

Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a small pericardial effusion  CT Torso: 1.
Limited study without contrast with significant progression of innumerable pulmonary and hepatic metastases with massive enlargement of the liver causing volume loss in the right lower lobe secondary to elevation of right hemidiaphragm.
Blood Cultures were negative throughout hospitalization.
Sputum culture only with MSSA.
Urine Cultures negative.
Lactate trended down during hospitalization and acidosis stabilized with stabilization of blood pressure and antibiotic treatment.
INR continued to increase during hospitalization.
Liver enzymes were followed during hospitalization and trended down after blood pressure was controlled.
TTE was negative for pericardial effusion.
On [**2-6**] EKG was performed for hyperkalemia which should 1mm ST Elevation in V1-V2 and ST Depression laterally.
Enzymes were checked and were minimally elevated.
Repeat ECG with resolution in the height of ST elevation in V1-V2.
