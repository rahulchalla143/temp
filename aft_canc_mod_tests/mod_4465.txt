CTA (wet read): left sided subsegmental pulmonary embolism, large right pleural effusion, right sided collapse.
Echocardiogram [**2171-12-24**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
CXR [**2171-12-25**]: Again seen is complete whiteout of the right hemithorax and worsening opacification of a previously seen small area of spared lung parenchyma in the right upper chest.
Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasounds [**2171-12-25**]: : Grayscale and color Doppler ultrasound were performed.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-12-25**], estimated pulmonary artery pressures are lower.
AP portable chest film, [**2172-1-8**]: Small to moderate right pleural effusion has minimally decreased.
All findings not present on previous CT scan from late [**Month (only) 462**] when she was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer.
No indications for lysis given that she was hemodynamically stable and BNP and troponins were within normal limits.
Echocardiogram without significant right heart strain.
labs showed iron deficient, no hemolysis.
We ADDED lorazepam 0.5mg every 8 hours as needed for anxiety.
