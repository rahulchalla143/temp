The patient was referred here for further evaluation and treatment.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs of 98.5, 96, 22, blood pressure of 146/82, oxygen saturation of 95%.
Neurological exam is remarkable for left facial drooping.
Chest exam reveals lungs are with crackles bilaterally at the bases.
HEENT exam shows bilateral carotid bruits and JVD.
Abdominal exam is unremarkable.
Extremity exam with 2+ edema bilaterally with shallow ulcerations on the medial aspect of both ulcerations.
Pulse exam shows palpable radial's and femoral's bilaterally.
Wound cultures were obtained.
The patient was transferred to the medicine service for further evaluation and treatment of congestive heart failure.
The patient an echocardiogram done which showed symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy with global and regional systolic dysfunction, consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease or other diffuse process.
The stress perfusion images showed a moderate reduction in tracer distribution involving the mid and distal inferolateral wall.
He rest perfusion images demonstrated this defect to be reversible.
Calculated ejection fraction was 29%.
Once the patient was compensated for her congestive heart failure and her renal function stabilized, she underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2179-4-13**] with documented 3- vessel disease with markedly elevated and right and left- sided filling pressures.
She underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/diagonal and an angioplasty to the LAD with partially successful PTCA of the right coronary.
Troponin levels were 0.59, 0.19, 0.08.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained immediately post cardiac catheterization.
The peak creatinine was 3.0.
The patient finally returned to baseline renal function with a creatinine of 1.9 on [**2179-4-21**].
The patient was pre hydrated with Mucomyst and sodium bicarbonate infusion and underwent a peripheral arteriogram on [**2179-4-22**].
She was without hematoma, and her creatinine remained stable.
Regular insulin sliding scale before meals and at    bedtime as follows: Glucose less than 150 use 1 unit,    glucose of 151 to 200 use 3 units, glucose of 201 to 250    use 5 units, glucose of 251 to 300 use 7 units, glucose of    301 to 350 use 9 units, glucose of 351 to 400 use 11    patient will be instructed regarding insulin usage and    administration prior to discharge.
Cardiac catheterization with intervention on [**2179-4-13**].
