He also had a Swan-Ganz catheter for the first five days postoperatively to assess his fluid status and manage his blood pressure medications.
His sputum cultures did reveal a Pseudomonas for which he was treated appropriately with double antibiotic coverage.
Postoperatively, the decision was made after approximately three and a half weeks, when it was clear that the patient was going to require a more extended of ventilatory weaning, that the patient would require a tracheostomy.
The patient's acute renal failure did not improve after five days, and as his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine continued to rise, it was felt that he would require hemodialysis.
