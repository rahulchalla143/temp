She was supratherapeutic with an INR of 4.1 and Coumadin was held.
CTA was negative for PE and revealed right mainstem stent with distal intraluminal narrowing or tumor effusion, mediastinal and subcarinal confluent metastatic lymphadenopathy.
She went for flexible bronchoscopy on [**3-30**] which revealed normal trachea, extensive tumor at carina obstructing both mainstem bronchi, extrinsic mediastinal compression of L mainstem and unable to visualize stent in right mainstem due to intraluminal tumor.
After approximately 2-3minutes of CPR, rhythm was checked and there was a palpable pulse with HR >100 and sbp >180.
Oxygen sats recovered into the 90s, right femoral a-line and left femoral CVL was placed.
On arrival to the ICU, pt was intubated and sedated with HR >100 and BP 140/90s.
Has been off chemo for the last 4 months "because CT scans have been stable."
Last bronchoscopy was in [**2165-12-23**] - small amounts of granulation tissue seen in stent.
Recent LUE DVT (mid-[**2166-2-20**]) - L arm port was changed, after which she developed dramatic swelling from shoulder to wrist; UENIs confirmed LUE DVT.
Lupus - diagnosed 8 years ago after work-up for painful knee and finger joints (L finger joints > R finger joints) - treated with "pills" but not prednisone 5.

Small cell carcinoma  [**2166-3-31**] Radiology VENOUS DUP EXT UNI (MAP Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of the left subclavian IJ axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins.
Pt thought to have had PEA arrest after rigid bronchoscopy was removed, subsequent to L main stent placement for SCLC and use of argon anticoagulation.
She underwent CPR immediately for <1 minute.
On admission the A-a gradient with pO2 was of >450 on 100% Fi02 and lactate was 1.7.
Repeat TTE was normal.
Unfortunately, she developped stridor and increase number of secretions in the upper airways with respiratory rate in the 40s and SpO2 in 70s.
Due to long standing disease with e/o hyperinflation on CXR and report of bronchospasm on presentation, she was also treated for COPD exacerbation with standing and prn nebulizers.
Pt was taken for flexible bronchoscopy which showed significant mucus, some of which was removed, and [**Female First Name (un) **] on the vocal cords.
Culture was still pending at time of discharge.
Anticoagulation was held prior to procedure and re-started 24 hours afterwards (with lovenox) given her malignancy and higher bleeding risk.
Per radiology, pt should undergo a repeat MRI in 6 weeks for further characterization.
She will need follow up MRI in 6 weeks for further charactization of a potential brain metastasis.
Follow up with primary oncologist within 2-3wks with a repeat MRI head and CT chest.
Bacteremia: Pt grew STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE from a-line, which was removed <24 after positive blood culture and started on Vancomycin (Day 1 [**4-2**]).
Unfortunately your breathing did not improve so you underwent another bronchoscopy which showed alot of mucus, some of which was removed.
The present plan is to continue you on blood thinners until we can obtain a repeat MRI to confirm a metastatic brain tumor.
