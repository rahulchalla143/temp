The patient came to the Emergency Department where he was found to have a hematocrit of 22 from a baseline of 37.
Nasogastric lavage showed coffee ground, which cleared with 500 cc of lavage.
Initially the patient's blood pressure was systolic in the 90s, which improved with intravenous fluids.
His baseline white blood cell count is approximately 2200.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs temperature 97.4.
Blood pressure initially 96/34 and increased to 125/52 after 2 liters of intravenous fluid.
Heart rate 102, which decreased to 90.
Respiratory rate 18.
HEENT examination significant for dry mucous membranes with a clear oropharynx.
Chest examination shows decreased breath sounds throughout with an increased I to E ratio.
Cardiovascular examination shows a regular rate with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Liver was 3 cm above the costal margin.
Rectal examination shows guaiac positive stool with melena in the vault.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  CBC significant for a white blood cell count of 73 with 20% neutrophils, 0% bands and 79% lymphocytes.
Hematocrit is 23 from a baseline of 37 with an MCV of 84.
Coagulation studies show an INR of 1.2.
Chem 7 53 and 48, bicarbonate of 19 and BUN of 117 and a creatinine of 1.9 increased from a baseline of 1.2 to 1.3.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus arrhythmia with a rate of 96 beats per minute.
Gastrointestinal was consulted and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done, which initially showed Dieulafoy lesion in the body of the stomach, which was treated with thermotherapy to stop the bleeding.
Subsequently the patient had a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which showed pinpoint areas of bleeding around the lesion site.
Repeat cauterization was not successful and so no further therapy was done.
The patient's hematocrit was monitored and it remained relatively stable for the rest of the hospital course.
As there was also bright red blood per rectum the patient would need a colonoscopy as an outpatient and this was set up by the gastrointestinal service for approximately one month after discharge.
Coronary artery disease:  While in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was on telemetry and he had one 12 beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
After the patient's hematocrit stabilized his blood pressure remained very well controlled and therefore he was not started on his antihypertensive during the hospitalization.
The patient should have a cardiology follow up as an outpatient for possible further workup of his episode of NSVT.
The patient also was subsequently noted to have an irregular heart rate and the electrocardiogram showed atrial ectopy, however, his rate was controlled and no further therapy was done at this time.
Oncology:  The patient has a history of CLL with a baseline white blood cell count approximately 2200.
On admission his white blood cell count was significantly increased to greater then 70,000 with a lymphocytic predominance.
Throughout the rest of the hospital admission the white blood cell count decreased and returned back to his normal baseline prior to discharge.
He is also told to hold his antihypertensive until his blood pressure was rechecked by his primary care physician whom he should follow up with in approximately one week.
The patient is also set up for an outpatient colonoscopy with GI on [**5-23**].
