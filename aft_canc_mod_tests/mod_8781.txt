Physical Exam: Vitals: 96.3 149/73 (140-150) HR 120 (110-120) RR 14 Sats 98% General: patient minimally responsive to name and noxiuos stimuli, NAD, deep respirations HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, 4 mm -> 3 mm reactive pupils, grossly clear OP, dry MM Neck: Cervical collar in place, no tenderness elicited Lungs: CTAB/l without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
Neurologic Exam per Neuro consult team: -mental status: Lying in bed with eyes open, mumbling incoherently.
Funduscopic exam was technically limited as the pt repeatedly forcefully closed her eyes on attempt to visualize fundus, but not overt papilledema.
Corneal reflex and nasal tickle present bilaterally.

CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI Head: IMPRESSION: Limited examination due to patient motion artifact.
MR C/s [**10-16**]: 1.
Ligamentous injury cannot be ruled out in the setting of limited examination due to severe motion artifact.
CT head [**10-16**]: IMPRESSION: Large right cerebellopontine angle meningioma with mass effect upon the fourth ventricle and brainstem.
CXR ([**10-17**]): Compared with [**2131-10-11**], an NGT is now present with its tip near the lower edge of the image in the proximal stomach, with the proximal sidehole marker below the GE junction.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
In the MICU, her electrolytes improved to a creatinine of 5.8 and a K of 4.3.
Her sodium rose slowly to 151 but she could not receive free water due to increased ICP.
She had an MRI confirming the large mass (see report below).
An NGT was unable to be placed [**12-28**] coiling in mouth.
EEG was done that was consistent with diffuse encephalopathy.
MRI C-spine was also recommended by neuro (C-spine unable to be cleared clinically) but was inconclusive to clear her c-spine.
Her bicarb gtt was changed to NS per renal recs, and was then changed just to PPN as she was felt to be euvolemic and did not require more fluid resuscitation.
There was concern for early sepsis since [**2-27**] blood cultures were positive for GPC and had MSSA in urine.
The patient had a NG tube placed and was noted to have blood returning from it.
Her hct was serially monitored and remained stable.
She was transferred to the floor when BP was stable.
At that meeting they were informed of her hospital course and overall poor prognosis and decided that the plan of care most concordant with her wishes would be to provide comfort measures only, stopping invasive interventions such as IV medications, antibiotics, feeding tubes, hemodialysis (should it have become necessary), endoscopic evaluation, vital signs and lab draws.
ARF - Baseline Cr 1.3.
Creatinine continued to trend down during this hospital course though no where near baseline, urine lytes [**10-21**] and renal US most consistent with intrinsic renal disease.
Surviellance cultures have been negative.
Blood cultures from [**10-15**] grew MSSA in [**2-27**] bottles.
Urine culture from [**10-14**] also with MSSA.
Surveillance blood cultures negative.
TTE showed no evidence of endocarditis.
Serial hct were followed in the MICU and remained stable.
NGT blood could be [**12-28**] trauma vs gastritis in setting of steroids vs PUD vs AVM.
Last colonoscopy in [**2127**] showed diverticula and hemorrhoids as well as polyp.Patient was noted to have both blood per rectum and blood return from NGT.
Stat CT showed slight increase in size of ventricle and neurosurg was contact[**Name (NI) **].
MRI confirmed larger mass, likely meningioma, with minimal edema.
HIT AB negative and unlikely DIC given normal coags, normal FDP and fibrinogen elevated.
Patient does have renal failure, MS changes and thrombocytopenia making TTP concerning, however no evidence of hemolysis on recent labs and no schistocytes.
Given this finding she was maintained in C-collar as could not be cleared until goals of care changed to comfort when collar was removed, CXR did not show any rib fractures.
9 C-SPINE NARROWING: MRI showed narrowing at C2-C3 and C3-4 and Increased T2 signal in the spinal cord at the same level, that could be due to chronic stenosis changes, however contusion of the spinal cord cannot be ruled out in the setting of trauma.
11 HYPERTENSION - patient was hypertensive on arrival in the unit, which may be due to mass effect seen on CT. Neuro recommends maintaining SBP<160, antihypertensive medications were held to allow autoregulation and her blood pressure actually became of hypotensive as described above.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Meningioma 2) Acute renal failure 3) Bacteremia 4) UTI 5) Gastrointestinal Bleed 6) Thrombocytopenia 7) Hypernatremia 8) Mental status changes   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please continue all medications as prescribed to achieve maximal comfort.
