Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
ABDOMINAL U/S [**2186-3-16**]: FINDINGS: The liver is normal in echotexture, without focal lesions.
Main, right, and left portal veins demonstrate normal directional flow and waveforms.
CXR [**2186-3-19**]: One portable view.
The retrocardiac area is suboptimally evaluated and a lateral view is recommended if further evaluation is clinically indicated.
She presented to OSH with syncope from bilateral PEs and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
?s), low UOP (10-20cc/hr), and echo showing right heart strain.
- Her LE dopplers showed DVT involving the right peroneal vein and superficial thrombophlebitis of the right great saphenous vein.
# Atrial Fibrillation: She had an episode of AFib with HR in the 140s overnight [**Date range (1) 88312**], but was asymptomatic and her BP remained fairly stable.
- She again went back into AFib the morning of [**3-19**], and was given 15mg total of IV lopressor, and then 1 hour after her last lopressor dose, she went back to NSR.
# Anemia: Her Hct on admission was 34.5, which was at her recent baseline, but then was dropping after admission to 26.6 on [**3-19**].
- Her MCV is elevated in the 100s with an increased RDW.
- Her B12 and folate levels on [**2186-3-7**] were normal at 1081 and 9.5 respectively.
Her Hct has fallen from 34.5 to 26.0 in the setting of receiving some IVF, but not enough to account for the observed fall in Hct.
- Her stools were guaiac positive and a mild GI bleed was suspected given her treatment with Heparin - She did not show any evidence of upper or lower GI bleeding once transferred to the floor, and her hematocrit rose back up to 30.5 on DOD - Her hematocrit will be followed closely on her anticoagulation treatment and any potential cessation of treatment or intervention will be avoided while she is still in the subacute phase of PE treatment  # Epilepsy: She has a history of epilepsy treated with Carbamazepine and Levetiracetam, so we continued Carbamazepine 200 mg PO TID and Levetiracetam 500 mg PO Q6H per her home dosing regimen.
We continued pancreatic enzyme supplements with meals, and continued lorazepam 0.5mg PO Q6H PRN anxiety or nausea.
