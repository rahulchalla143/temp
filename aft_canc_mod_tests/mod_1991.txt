PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, physical examination revealed vital signs with a heart rate of 54, normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure 108/74, weight 130 pounds, height five foot one inch.
Pulses - femoral right 2+ and left 2+, dorsalis pedis 1+ bilaterally, posterior tibial 1+ bilaterally, radial 2+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Echocardiogram performed on [**2183-9-24**], demonstrated an aortic valve which was heavily calcified with critical stenosis present, peak gradient was measured at 80 to 90 mmHg with a mean gradient of 53 mmHg.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery service for evaluation for aortic valve replacement.
On [**2184-2-16**], the patient had tracheal stoma dilation and a flexible bronchoscopy which was performed without complication.
The patient continued to do well after this procedure and magnetic resonance scan to evaluate the hemangioma was obtained.
Of note, the patient's sodium trended upward at 152, and this was treated with free water boluses via nasogastric tube.
The patient was started on tube feeds for nutrition and a HIT antibody was sent on [**2184-2-20**], since platelets had dropped from 113,000 to 67,000.
Upon transfer, the patient had a repeat echocardiogram to evaluate for aortic insufficiency in the setting of critical aortic stenosis which would also determine further management.
The ejection fraction was 40%.
The patient's sodium was 147 the following day.
The patient was pancultured which demonstrated an Enterococcus urinary tract infection, which was sensitive to Levofloxacin.
Of concern, one blood culture came back positive, which was determined to be coagulase negative Staphylococcus.
The patient remained afebrile and no other blood culture became positive.
