Pt admitted to CCU for monitoring - hemodynamically stable on admission.
# CORONARIES:  Patient with known CAD p/w worsening sx and reversible defect in the distal anterior wall on perfusion scan s/p 2 promus stent to prox and distal LAD and 1 stent to LM.
Repeated Echocardiogram (LVEF= 45 %, see report below) .
[**8-30**] TTE: The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
Intravascular ultrasound confirmed the LMCA-LAD stent to be well opposed with no uncovered dissection (see PTCA comments for further details).
Relook angiography at LMCA in 3months.
You were admitted to the CCU after your cardiac catheterization procedure.
Your heart artery was injured during the procedure and your blood pressure decreased as a result.
Your heart enzymes were normal which tells us that your heart did not suffer prolonged injury as a result of the procedure.
