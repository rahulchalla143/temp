Initial exam (extubated) showed patient was awake, slow to respond, but with language, sensation and motor exam intact.
CT did not show any evolving infarcts or hemorrhage though she has had an old SDH which may serve as a seizure focus.
She could not undergo an MRI due to a pacer.
Her exam remained reassuring and nonfocal, and a repeat head CT again showed no change in subdural hemorrhage and no new acute process.
Bedside EEG showed generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDS).

EKG showed some T wave flattening.
