An echocardiogram obtained on [**9-4**] showed a moderate to large pericardial effusion causing both right atrial and right ventricular diastolic collapse.
Physical Exam: VS: T 95.9 BP 134/74 P 76 RR 100 % RA Pulsus: 6 GEN: Elderly russian female, sitting in bed, alert and comfortable HEENT: NCAT, oropharynx clear and without erythema or exudate, poor dentition.
Pulsus of 6.

2- The patient developed a brief vagal episode with heart rate down from 90 bpm to 55-65 bpm and SBP down to 60-70 mmHg (down from 140-160 mmHg).
Limited removal of 7 CC of markedly viscous pericardial fluid.
Echo [**9-6**] post pericardiocentesis: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-9-6**], the effusion appears slightly smaller.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2164-9-6**]):       4+   (>10 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2164-9-10**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2164-9-10**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
[**9-7**] Blood cultures pending.
Low voltage on EKG c/w effusion.
Pulsus of 15 in clinic prior to admission, 6 on admission.
A repeat echo on [**9-6**] was without evidence of tamponade.
Cell count and culture results of pericardial effusion as detailed in results section.
The mixed flora in the fluid culture is concerning and blood cultures were obtained to r/o systemic infection.
The pt refused to stay in house for further monitoring and agreed to close f/u in case the blood cultures were to positive.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] understands that a postitive culture would need to be treated with IV antibiotics.
Blood cultures from [**9-7**] remain pending as of [**9-11**].
Pt will also f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name **], Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] as detailed below for further discussion of a pericardial window pending the final cytology results.

You had an attempt to drain the fluid around the heart however it was not able to be drained.
The culture of the fluid around your heart had bacteria in it which is concerning that you could have an infection, although you do not have any symptoms compatible with this.
We checked blood cultures to be sure that you don't have a blood stream infection but you did not want to wait for those cultures to be resulted.
Followup Instructions: 1) You have an appointment for an echocardiogram on Friday [**9-14**] at 2:00.
(Please try to keep this appointment as we would like you to have this echocardiogram before your appointment with the surgeon)  2) Please follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1532**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8786**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2348**] Date/Time:[**2164-9-18**] 10:30.
