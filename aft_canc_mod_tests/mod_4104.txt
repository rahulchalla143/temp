His blood pressure stabilized overnight and elevated lactate resolved.
Blood cultures were negative since [**2125-12-28**].
Chest X-Ray supported the diagnosis of LUL and RLL aspiration PNA.
On admission, his prior sputum cultures were reviewd and a culture from [**12-8**] was noted to have grown Klebsiella pneumonia sensitive only to Meropenem.
Repeat sputum culture on [**12-14**] also grew Klebsiella pneumonia with multiple resistances, sensitive to meropenem.
Urinary Tract Infection with Klebsiella:  Urine culture from [**12-13**] grew Klebsiella pneumonia.
Cardiovascular:  Blood Pressure:  Pt was hypotensive on admission in the Emergency Department with BP 90/60s.
As his blood pressure improved, the patient's metoprolol was titrated upwards to a dose of 75 mg TID.
His heart rate remained in NSR for the remainder of his hopsital course.
Per neurosurgery, the patient is more alert and interactive when his SBP is maintained >140.
Therefore, his target blood pressure should be greater than 140.
His enzymes were cycled on admission.
He did have an enzyme leak with a peak of troponin of 0.19 and CK of 293.
His TSH was 36 on [**12-22**].
He should have his TSH rechecked in 1 week for appropriate response.
The patient's electrolytes were monitored daily.
