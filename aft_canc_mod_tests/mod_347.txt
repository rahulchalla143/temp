#PATHOLOGY: [][**2143-7-5**] CT GUIDED CORE BX DIAGNOSIS: Omentum, "nodule"; CT-guided needle core biopsy (A): Adenocarcinoma, moderately to poorly differentiated (see comment).
Given the symptoms the pt underwent an EGD with biopsies was performed, which showed severe erosive esophagitis and a duodenal stricture of unclear etiology.
Pathology from gastric and duodenal biopsies was negative for malignancy.
To further evaluate the duodenal stricture, a CT torso with contrast was performed.
Unfortunately, the CT scan showed significant evidence of malignancy, with "extensive soft-tissue mass involving the greater omentum.
IR was consulted for biopsy of the omental-mass, and she underwent CT-guided biopsy on [**7-5**].
Special stains showed a primary tumor either from the breast, ovary, uterus or upper GI tract.
The Oncology team at [**Hospital1 18**] was consulted and they requested an MRI brain, which was negative and a transvaginal US which showed multiple cystic lesions in the left adnexa.
The patient had ongoing difficulty tolerating po's and a repeat EGD was done which did not show a stentable lesion.
The patient had a G tube placed on [**2143-7-18**] that relieved her symptoms of obstruction.
The initial attempt at placing a J-tube was unsuccessful and a repeat attempt was performed on [**2143-7-22**], with a repeat attempt on [**2143-8-1**], also unsuccessful.
CXR showed new RML and RLL infiltrates, and she was started on levofloxacin.
Her WBC was persistently elevated and her coverage was changed to vanco/CTX and flagyl which she continued for 10 days.
With chest PT and time, this has steadily improved.
She was tachypneic, but her blood pressure was holding.
She was given Dilt (out of concern that beta blockade would worsen her respiratory status), ABG was performed but revealed a venous gas.
Her pleural fluid was negative for malignancy and was transudative according to Light's criteria and did not grow any microorganisms.
Creatinine peak was 1.9 during this hospitalization and later downtrended to 1.3 before bumping back up to 1.9.
Quality of life was discussed and the patient voiced her preference to continue to pursue diagnostic tests and discuss treatment options.
