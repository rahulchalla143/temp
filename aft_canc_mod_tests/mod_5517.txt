In the emergency department, the patient was in atrial fibrillation with RVR (rate 140) and in respiratory distress.
Temperature 99.8 rectally.
Blood pressure intially normal but then dropped to 60's systolic.
Surgery was consulted for the abdominal pain and recommended CT abdomen, which was unrevealing.
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation with rates 90-110.
Blood pressures remained with systolics 110.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2124-6-5**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Echocardiography [**2124-6-5**] The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Bronchoscopy [**2124-6-5**] Oozing from multiple sites, blood seeping down trachea from above.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2124-6-8**] Gradual improvement in left lower lobe consolidation.

CTA negative for pulmonary embolus but showed lower lobe infiltrates.
He underwent bronchoscopy which demonstrated diffuse friability with oozing from multiple sites.
The patient was diuresed prior to admission with lasix but echocardiogram during admission showed no definite evidence of systolic or diastolic heart failure.
Cultures from bronchoaveolar lavage were negative at the time of discharge.
BP also stable (range 110s-140s/60's-90's).
Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed as above.
His epistaxis resolved and his airway secretions became progressively less bloody.
Echocardiogram was also unrevealing for a source.
Echocardiogram revealed dilated atria, LVEF 50-55%, 1+ AR, moderate pulmonary hypertension.
The patient was on Toprol XL as outpatient, and was given metoprolol in the ICU once his blood pressure stabilized.
The patient's hematocrit drifted down during admission likely due to dilution.
Baseline hematocrit is mid-to-high 30s, likely due to chronic disease.
Further work-up deferred as an outpatient.
Unclear etiology; nadir of platelets was 124.
Imaging was negative for an acute process as above.
Blood pressures remained well-controlled on the floor.
Hyperlipidemia: The patient's liver function tests were initially abnormal on admission and simvastatin was held.
The patient liver function tests subsequently normalized and simvastatin was restarted.
