[**2174-7-2**] ECG: NSR 88 bpm, V1-V3 TWI  Echo [**2174-7-5**]: The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
On subcostal supine and 45 degree head-up views, there is a <1 cm (in diastole) rim of pericardial fluid between the visceral pericardium/fat overlying the right ventricle and the diaphragm.
