Her MRI on admission demonstrated worsening cord compression.
An Xray was checked which demonstrated mild tracheal deviation but upon discussion with the radiologist this was thought to be unchanged from previous.
Immediate postoperative neurologic exam is she was able follow commands moving all atremities, able to lift both upper and lower extremities, sensation intact.
Her hematoctrit dropped 29.9 to 23.3 on the postoperative day one which she received one unit of PRBC, subsequent hct levels are improved.
Her Thoracis PA/lateral radiogaraph reveals posterior fixation rods are seen.
Her INR was elevated upon admission for unclear reasons.
The patient will have a CT torso for tumor staging post-operatively.
