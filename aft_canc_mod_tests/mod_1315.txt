CTA Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**5-10**]: 1.
Small volume ascites is new from prior exam with mild bowel wall thickening along the distal colon, likely indicative of colitis (inflammatory versus infectious, versus ischemic).
CXR [**5-12**]: Tip of the new left PIC line projects over the low SVC.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  # Acute respiratory failure, with post obstructive pneumonia and progressive tumor burden, and pleural effusion: Dr. [**Known lastname 22998**] presented with increased shortness of breath, with CT scan that revealed significant disease progression in his left lung, but no pulmonary embolism.
However, the findings on his chest CT were possibly infectious, but also most likely related to incresed tumor burden.
Cultures from thoracentesis showed no growth.
His CT showed evidence of distal descending & sigmoid colitis.
CT abdomen showed some mild bowel wall thickening along the distal colon, likely indicative of colitis (report said inflammatory vs infectious vs ischemic).
Other stool studies were negative.
# Anemia: Pt's hematocrit 24.3 (was in the 30s in [**3-12**]).
Other cell lines are not involved, arguing against myelophistic process.
# Coagulopathy: INR 1.8; pt not on coumadin.
INR was trended down when pt left the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (1.6).
Your CT scan showed mild colitis affecting the distal descending and sigmoid colon.
Stool studies were negative for infection.
