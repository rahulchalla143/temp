The patient's HCP also reports that he had fever last week and at dialysis 4D prior to admit ([**5-15**]) had blood cultures drawn which subsequently returned positive.
No fevers, chills, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting over this time.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-10-21**], left ventricular systolic function is now depressed (global), the mitral leaflets are thickened with a possible vegetation and mild mitral regurgitation is present.
If clinically indicated a TEE is suggested to better define the mitral valve.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2167-5-23**] 2:03 PM  CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  Reason: ?
COMPARISON: PET CT of [**2167-4-14**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial imaging was performed through the chest without administration of IV contrast.
Multiplanar reformatted images were essential for study interpretation.
Patchy densities that were seen in the left lung base on the PET CT of [**2167-4-14**] have improved.
The non-enhanced liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, stomach, adrenal glands and kidneys, as partially visualized, are unremarkable.
Found to have bacteremia on blood cultures drawn on [**5-15**] at dialysis center.
Echo here with vegetation on mitral valve.
Initiated vanc [**5-20**], serial surveillance blood cultures negative.
For pulmonary infiltrates, received chest CT on [**5-23**] which demonstrated interval improvement and no clear evidence of septic emboli, and initially received azithromycin for coverage of atypical organisms completed, along with vancomycin, as above.
aspirated after vomiting, and developed a new lll infiltrate consistent with pneumonitis, and required high flow oxygen to maintain oxygen sats in the 90s subsequent to this.
He was sent back to the floor the following day ([**5-29**]) as his oxygenation improved (90's on two litres nasal cannula, which he would not keep on, thus requiring restraint).
Swallow evaluation [**6-5**] showed silent aspiration but with counseling and observation he tolerated soft foods and thin liquids.
He was transferred to the ICU for management by an insulin drip, and was able to be transferred back to the general medicine unit on [**6-8**].
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1.
