LABORATORY DATA:  On presentation to [**Hospital6 649**] his white blood cell count was 12.8, 53% neutrophils, 27% bands, 10% lymphocytes, hematocrit 38.3, platelet count 610; PT 15.2, PTT 26.2, INR 1.5; sodium 133, potassium 4.9, chloride 99, bicarb 24, BUN 19, creatinine 1.8, glucose 132; ALT 61, AST 79, alkaline phosphatase 139, total bilirubin 0.9, amylase 22, albumin 2.3; urinalysis on [**9-25**] showed a large amount of blood with trace amounts of protein, ketones and leukocytes.
The patient was admitted to Surgery, made NPO with intravenous fluids, given intravenous antibiotics, and blood cultures were sent.
A percutaneous liver biopsy and biopsy to the mass of the liver were also planned.
Subsequently this liver biopsy revealed a significant amount of fibrosis and inflammation but no tumor etiology.
On the morning of [**9-27**], the patient was noted to have an increasing white blood cell count jumping to 19.6 from the admission value of 12.8.
The paracentesis revealed purulent fluid within his peritoneal cavity with increased white blood cells and increased red blood cells.
After being appropriately consented, the patient was taken to the Operating Room for exploratory laparotomy where lysis of adhesions were also performed.
These abscesses were unroofed, and biopsies were performed of the abscesses.
Cultures taken during the operations revealed scant growth of Streptococcus milleri, on the 26th, Streptococcus it was revealed that there was scant growth of Corynebacterium and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**].
A transesophageal echocardiogram on [**10-1**] revealed no vegetations consistent with endocarditis.
In addition, the left ventricular ejection fraction was greater than 55%.
A CAT scan on [**10-6**] revealed a new left rectus sheath hematoma.
Since the patient's hematocrit at this time was stable, this hematoma was managed conservatively and subsequently continued to drained out blood but soon dried up, and the drain was removed shortly after on [**10-6**].
Stool was sent for C-diff while the patient was on the floor but was negative.
A disposition screen was performed by Physical Therapy who stated that the patient would do well from a short stay in a rehabilitation facility.
Today the patient is afebrile, slightly tachycardiac at 108, blood pressure 150/94, 95% on 3 L.  He is tolerating a good p.o.
Heart rate regular, rate and rhythm.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Hemodynamic monitoring with Swan-Ganz catheter.
twice a day, hold for heart rate less than 60 and systolic blood pressure less than 110, Dilaudid 2-4 mg p.o.
