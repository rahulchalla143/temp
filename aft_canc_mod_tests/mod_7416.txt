History of Present Illness: 79M with past admission to the stroke service on [**2185-10-11**] for LUE weakness thought to be related to embolic CVA in a patient w/ atrial fibrillation (now on coumadin) and a hx of "partial quadriparesis" with weakness primarily in [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/p C6-7 fractures from an MVA in [**2171**].
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further investigation.

His INR at this time in the ED was 7. .
On initial neurology exam he could not move his leg, but one hour later he was able to move his leg and he noticed that the strength was gradually returning.
He underwent Abd/Pelvic CT to r/o retroperitoneal hematoma compressing plexus, causing leg sx.
He also had an MRI with DWI (stroke protocol) brain to look for new area of infarct and MRA to look for likely ACA territory abnl (ie, occlusion).
DWI images were significant for new embolic CVA in leg motor strip area.
INR was reversed with 2U FFP and he was x-fered to the MICU for stabilization.
Neurology also followed the patient and will take the patient on their service once the GI evaluation is complete and the INR is again in the therapeutic range.

A/P: 79 yo M with recent admission to Neurology for LUE weakness thought to be related to embolic CVA who presents with acute onset of LLE weakness found to have new CVA, likely embolic despite anticoagulation, also with GIB [**1-5**] elevated INR while on coumadin found to have rectal mass on colonoscopy [**10-26**].
Transrectal sono showed [**Name (NI) 102877**] lesion.
Transanal resection on [**2185-11-4**], which the patient tolerated well.
Post operatively, patient was started on a Heparin drip and PO coumadin (target INR [**1-6**]).
Hct was 31.2 & PTT was 54.7.
Hct was 32.2 & PTT was 37.1.
PTT was 69.8.
VS were stable and serial HCT suggested no acute loss of blood.
Goal is to keep INR between [**1-6**] in long term, required FFP for reversal prior to GI eval for GIB.
Have restarted coumadin INR 1.9-2.0, lovenox x1, now have d/ced coumadin today and started hep gtt incase patient will have procedure done in house.
