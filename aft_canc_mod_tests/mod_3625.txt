EMG done showed diffuse axonal pattern c/w neuropathy.
LP showed somewhat elevated protein (cytology sent).
CT of chest subsequently performed and found lung mass w/ nodal mets.
Pathology returned [**2-19**] with new dx of Small Cell Lung Ca.
Briefly transferred to medicine [**2170-2-20**] for further management.

Chest X-ray 1.
Abnormal mediastinal contour with marked convexity of the aorticopulmonary window has not appreciably changed compared to the recent radiograph.
This could also be further evaluated with chest CT.  CT chest without contrast and reconstructions [**2170-2-16**]: 1.
MRI would be preferred for definitive characterization.
Further evaluation with MRI is recommended at which time the renal lesion can be assessed too.

# Small Cell Lung Cancer, Metastatic - Given CT chest findings there was initial concern for metastatic lung cancer.
Pathology of lung biopsy verified small cell.
Upon discharge her paraneoplastic work-up was positive for Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] and Anti-Ri was still pending.
After an initial evaluation by the medicine service, she was transferred to Oncology for initiation of chemotherapy and consideration of radiation.
An MRI was then obtained for staging which revealed a liver lesion suspicious for metastatic spread.
Paraneoplastic work-up revealed positive Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibodies.
Anti-Ri antibodies were pending on discharge.
# Urinary retention - Prior to this hospitalization, had been treated with antibiotics for UTIs, however, most recent culture from [**2-16**] without growth.
Obtained initial x-ray which was nondiagnostic given cast.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Small Cell Lung Cancer Secondary: Left ankle fracture, gout, hypertension, paraneoplastic syndrome   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
Further evaluation revealed metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer.
