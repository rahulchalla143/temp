In the ED, initial VS: T 97.9  HR 81  BP 130/82  RR 38  O2 sat 98% on 12 L NRB.
Blood cultures x 2 were sent.
EKG, Portable CXR and CTA Chest performed.
In ED, maintained 95-100% NRB but when attempted 6 L NC --> O2 sat to 86%.
A CT scan done on [**2100-5-13**] showed a large right paratracheal mass and right upper lobe spiculated nodule.
Bronchoscopy on [**2100-5-17**] showed a negative brushings; however, a fine needle biopsy done in 4R station was positive for small cell lung cancer.
Staging PET CT done on [**2100-5-24**] showed FDG avid right upper lobe nodule measuring 16 mm with an SUV of 9.3.
Staging head MRI done on [**2100-5-15**] showed no evidence of brain metastasis.
Lumbar puncture on [**2100-5-31**] showed that the CSF was negative for malignant cells.
Quit smoking 5 years ago, but had smoked [**2-16**] ppd for 40+ years.

The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Brief Hospital Course: # Respiratory distress: Initially admitted to MICU, chest x-ray showed bilateral hazy opacities, lymphadenopathy, and a background of chronic interstitial lung disease.
Blood cultures and respiratory viral cultures were negative, and induced sputum was unrevealing/contaminated.
Echo revealed mild LVH.
Last labs were on [**10-15**].
Labs were discontinued after [**10-15**].
# Small Cell Lung Cancer: Lymphadenopathy on admission chest imaging was believed to be consistent with his known cancer.
With the change of focus to patient comfort, oxygen saturation goals were sat at >90%.
Eventually, the patient was made CMO and vitals/oxygen sats were no longer measured.
