She recently underwent exploratory laparotomy with tumor biopsy [**2146-5-25**] for evaluation of a pelvic mass with placement of bilaterel ureteral stents.
The surgery was complicated by acute renal failure with creat up to 2.6 from baseline 1.5 suspectedly due to ATN from ureteral obstruction although renal US revealed no clear obstruction and she was discharged [**5-29**] with creat improved to 1.9.
Abd CT revealed left sided mild hydronephrosis with no asymmetric stranding and diffuse lymphomatous involvment of the retroperitoneum extending up the ureters and involving the renal pelvises as well.
Sepsis line placed and she was started on vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl and given 3l NS for hydration with vital signs stable.
CT scan performed on [**2146-5-6**] revealed extensive ascites and peritoneal masses concerning for ovarian cancer.

CXR ([**2146-6-5**]): There has been interval withdrawal of the right IJ line, with the tip now in the distal SVC.
The remainder of the study has not significantly changed in comparison to the prior exam.
CT abd/pelvis ([**2146-6-5**]): 1.
Left proximal NU stent is in the proximal left ureter, and there is associated hydronephrosis.
Tiny foci of air within this, and also likely small extraluminal air, likely reflect changes related to prior biopsy and recent surgery.

CT confirmed hydronephrosis.
Subsequent blood and urine cultures were without growth.
She developed tumor lysis syndrome which was treated with high rates of IVF and diuresis to keep her urine output up.
Her hematocrit and coagulation studies were normal.
A renal ultrasound was performed on the day prior to discharge to eval for resolution of hydronephrosis.
