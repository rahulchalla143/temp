Red blood cell transfusion 3.
She has kept her oxygen at 4L, and knew she would follow up at clinic yesterday, at which time her oxygen saturation was 88% on 3L.
She was sent to the ED, where a CTA was negative for PE, but did show increased grown opacification.
Sarcoidosis/Pulm HTN - She remains on 1.5 L/min of O2.
Sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma, s/p L hemicolectomy with stapled colorectal anastomosis [**2175-6-9**]: mucinous adenocarcinoma (>50%) which was pT3, pN2 and M1 (stage IV) with metastatic disease to omentum and peritoneal implants.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Tm/c 100.5, BP 128/72 P 97 RR 18 sats 94% on 4l General: Pleasant female appearing stated age, resting in bed comfortably, in no apparent distress Neck: Supple, no jvd, no LAD Cardiac: RRR, nl S1, S2, no m/r/g Lungs: good air entry and movement, scattered bilateral mild rhonchi, no wheezes, rales, no dullness to percussion Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM appreciated.
CT chest: 1.
Findings are non-specific and diagnostic considerations include pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, or possibly infection.
Fibrosis, traction bronchiectasis, hilar and paraaortic lymph nodes consistent with known sarcoidosis again seen, not significantly changed from prior.
[**2176-10-10**]: ECHO The left atrium is elongated.
The CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism, but demonstrated bilateral focal area of ground glass opacification.
Echo showed no signs of heart failure or strained right ventricle, therefore, heart failure was not thought to be a significant contributing factor.
Repeat gas after an hour on CPAP (10/5/100%O2)revealed 7.23/88/99.
The patient tolerated this intervention very well and her platuea pressures decreased while her ventilation improved.
All blood cultures remain negative.
She was discharged on 2 L of nasal cannula, and may benefit from outpatient consult for sleep study (patient was noted to need more oxygen at night and reason for intubation was hypercarbia, so she could potentially benefit from CPAP, although her oxygen saturations stabalized during her stay).
As her steroids were tapered, her blood sugars trended downward closer to the normal range.
She has testing supplies for blood sugar monitoring at home, and was instructed, and expressed understanding, to monitor her blood sugars closely after discharge and follow up with her primary care physician.
Finger sticks Please check your blood sugar with finger sticks 2-3 times daily, and bring in your blood sugars to your follow up appointments.
Home oxygen Nasal cannula, 2L titrate to oxygen saturation 94-100%.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: - Pneumonia Secondary Diagnoses: - Small bowel obstruction - Pulmonary Sarcoidosis - Sigmoid adenocarcinoma - Pulmonary hypertension - Anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable.
A number of tests, including blood, sputum, urine, and imaging studies were completed.
Please contact your oncologist, primary care doctor, or go to the emergency room if you experience any fevers (greater than 100.4), chills, abdominal pain, chest pain, difficulty breathing, worsening nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, lack of bowel movement or ability to pass gas for more than one day, or other concerning symptoms.
