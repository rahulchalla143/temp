ACUTE ISSUES: # PNA/Bronchitis: Pt presented with acute onset SOB and cough and had CXR findings c/w multifocal PNA.
Rapid viral testing was sent which came back positive for parainfluenza virus.
Multiple blood cultures and urine cultures were drawn, all of which returned no growth.
He developed acute SOB with wheezing and rales on exam and dropped his O2 sat to 88% during the episode thought to be due to diastolic CHF.
The patient's most recent echo in [**12/2156**] showed preserved EF but moderate AS with LVH.
# SIRS/Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive in the ED but responsive to fluid boluses and did not require pressors.
Pt's residual volumes were 182-183 on bladder scan and it was determined that he Most likely required more fluids in the setting of insensible losses [**1-13**] fever and general decreased PO intake over the past few days.
A Foley was placed to monitor urine output during diuresis after pulmonary edema developed, which was succesfully discontinued prior to his discharge.
His INR was monitored while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and his Coumadin was dosed appropriately, keeping in mind that antibiotics can affect the metabolism of warfarin.
His INR was stable on discharge.
Home PT  Medications on Admission: MVI, Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID since [**2157-6-7**], Revalimid 15 mg PO for 21 days, held since [**6-7**], levothyroxine 25 mcg daily, omeprazole 10 mg qhs, oxycodone 5mg qhs, warfarin 5 mg tab, 2.5 mg while on Cipro for a goal INR [**1-14**].
You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] for low blood pressure and evidence of pneumonia.
You will need to continue to recheck bloods to monitor INR to see if the Warfarin dose needs to be adjusted.
