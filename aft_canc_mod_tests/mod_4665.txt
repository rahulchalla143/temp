Microbiology: Blood culture [**2173-7-27**] - no growth Urine culture [**2173-7-27**] - no growth Blood fungal cultures [**2173-7-28**] - no growth Sputum culture [**2173-7-30**] - GRAM STAIN <10 PMNs and >10 epithelial cells/100X field.
Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper respiratory secretions.
Bacterial culture results are invalid.
Blood cultures 8/11, [**8-1**] - no growth to date Catheter tip cultures 8/17 - pending .
Imaging: EKG: Sinus tachycardia, Nonspecific ST-T abnormalities Since previous tracing of [**2173-7-14**], rate is increased .
CXR [**2173-7-27**]: Slight increase in pulmonary vascularity without frank pulmonary edema.
CXR [**2173-7-29**]: INDICATION: Line placement.
CXR [**2173-7-30**]: Improving congestive heart failure.
Chest CT w/out Contrast [**2173-7-30**]: Two focal areas of consolidation, one in the left upper lobe and the other in the right lower lobe, which demonstrate a surrounding ground-glass halo.
The imaging characteristics are most consistent with invasive aspergillosis.
CXR [**2173-8-4**]: successful placement of right subclavian venous access device.
# Fever with Neutropenia: In the ED, the patient had a temperature of 102.9 with a WBC count of 21.1 with 1% Neutrophils (ANC ~210).
CXR was negative in the ED.
On [**2173-7-28**] the patient became progressively tachypneic to the 30s, SBP 140-150s, increasingly tachycardic to the 140s, diaphoretic with O2 saturation of 99% on 1L.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia with no evidence of ischemia, cardiac enzymes were negative x 1.
He continued to have high grade temperatures as high as 103 F. Blood cultures just grew gram positive cocci in clusters.
Initial CXR was negative for any infiltrate.
Repeat CXR the next day revealed a right lower lobe pneumonia.
CT scan was then obtained which showed two focal areas of consolidation, one in the left upper lobe and the other in the right lower lobe, which demonstrate a surrounding ground-glass appearance, most consistent with invasive aspergillosis.
His WBC count remained low with ANC between 300-400.
Pulmonary evaluation was obtained to evaluate the possibility of doing a bronchoscopy for the purpose of getting a tissue diagnosis according to the recommendations of Infectious Diseases.
Blood cultures were subsequently all negative.
Follow up CT scan in two weeks was ordered and the patient was scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the Pulmonary clinic.
ABG at the time revealed a respiratory alkalosis with a pH of 7.49, pCO2 17 with a concomitant non gap metabolic acidosis.
With improvement in his respiratory status, repeat blood gases showed a neutral pH and his bicarbonate began to rise steadily up to 17 on discharge, likely due to his resolving pulmonary infection.
Once back on the floor, formal renal consultation was obtained for further evaluation and guidance in treatment.
Upon discharge his Hct was 26.4 and his plts were 81K.
After stabilization the patient had a stable blood pressure and did not require any antihypertensive medications.
# DM - The patient was monitored throughout his stay with QID finger sticks with sliding scale insulin.
On the last two days of admission, finger sticks and insulin were discontinued.
