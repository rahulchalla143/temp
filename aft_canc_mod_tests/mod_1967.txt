[**2130-8-4**] Brain MRI : Gadolinium-enhanced images not obtained secondary to low EGFR limiting evaluation for metastasis.
If clinically indicated further evaluation can be obtained with gadolinium enhanced images following informed consent and consultation with renal service.
The neurology service followed her closely post-operatively, and a brain MRI was done to rule out metastatic disease.
After reviewing the study with the neurology radiologists, it was felt the picture was most indicative of a subacute stroke.
This prompted lower extremity venous studies and trans-thoracic echocardiogram to rule out a source of a thrombus, which were unremarkable.
NIFs and vital capacities were monitored daily for [**1-25**] days post-operatively.
Urine culture was pending at the time of discharge.
