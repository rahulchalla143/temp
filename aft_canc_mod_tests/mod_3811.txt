This patient also had a persistent pancreatic pseudocyst after his last colectomy, and his port has been recalled by the manufacturer.
He made good urine output but was noted to have a low systolic blood pressure approximately in the 80s.
His blood pressure appropriately responded with some IV fluids, and a repeat hematocrit was stable.
His serial hematocrits were stable and had no further complaints.
Had decreased drainage in JP 1 which was the medial drain had output that was slightly bile-tinged, where as JP 2 put out predominantly serosanguineous to a lesser amount of approximately 70 to 90 cc per day as opposed to JP 1 which put out 360.
A review of his IVs were done, and there was no other infiltrative or phlebitic peripheral line.
A chest x-ray was obtained which illustrated a retrocardiac pneumonia.
He was also noted to get a repeat a CT scan on the evening of the 14th to evaluate for a biloma or any other intraabdominal abscess.
The CT scan failed to illustrate any intraabdominal process that might be contributing to this gentleman's postoperative fevers.
Fortunately, at this point his cultures were all negative.
