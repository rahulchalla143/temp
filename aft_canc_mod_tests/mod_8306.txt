Lower extremity dopplers [**8-2**]: no DVT  EKG [**2123-8-6**]- sinus 101 bpm, slightly concave ST segments in II and V6 < 1mm, low precordial voltages, otherwise no ST-T abnormalities.
Same as admission EKG [**8-1**]   Brief Hospital Course: 51M with gliosarcoma, prior PE, now admitted with new PE.
No evidence of lower extremity thrombus on ultrasound study here.
Echo did show RV dysfunction, however patient was never hemodynamically unstable (aka no hypotension).
He was bridged with heparin for 6 days total, with therapeutic INR > 2 on the final 2 days.
He was on 5mg daily, with INR rising to 2.8 on day of discharge.
Dose will be decreased to 4mg on Sunday [**8-8**], and patient will follow up on Monday [**8-9**] with our [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital3 **] for dosing, until he returns to [**State 2690**] in a couple weeks.
Given he did not have persistent hypoxemia or hypotension, it was felt there is no indication for repeat CT angiography or further therapy of his PE aside from standard anticoagulation.
He had a CT head at OSH with no evidence of bleed.
Neuroncology at [**Hospital1 **] and outpatient rad onc both felt anti-coagulation was safe.
He may benefit from further eval of this and possibly a stimulating anti-depressant medication if appropriate.
