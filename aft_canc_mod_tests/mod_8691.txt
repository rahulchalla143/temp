The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
CT head [**2172-2-18**]  IMPRESSION: 1.
KUB [**2172-2-19**] FINDINGS: There is no free air.
Right UE ultrasound [**2172-2-25**] FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color son[**Name (NI) 493**] imaging of the right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins was performed.
Abdominal RUQ utlrasound [**2-25**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Mild gallbladder wall thickening appreciated on the prior examination has resolved.
Head CT was unremarkable.
Elevated LFTs likely shock liver during last admission, which might have contributed to the altered mental status.
Heart rate was controlled with PO metoprolol and diltiazem.
The decision had been made previously by his CPC not to anticoagulate him given a history of multiple falls and hx of difficultly controlling his INR as an out pt.
# Pneumonia: CXR showed RLL consolidation.
Blood and sputum cultures as well as urinary legionella antigen were negative.
Stool tests for c diff toxin were negative x 2.
# Systolic heart failure/severe aortic stenosis: Patient had a history of systolic heart failure, EF 30% on [**2172-2-4**].
Repeat echo showed slightly improved EF at 35% and worsening of valve disease (severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and moderate to severe aortic stenosis with valve area .8%).
# Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Patient had a history of CKD with baseline creatinine in ~1.5.
Creatinine rose to 2.2 with hyaline casts and FeNA <1% suggesting pre-renal and ATN combined picture.
# Elevated LFTs: AST and ALT were lower than last admission but AP and tbili higher, likely due to shock liver from hypotension.
He had already had an unrevealing hepatitis and autoimmune workup during last admission.
# Elevated INR: INR was initially 2.6, up from 1.3 at discharge on [**2172-2-11**].
INR trended toward baseline.
Ultrasound showed extensive upper extremity thrombis involving the axillary, brachial, and basilic veins.
He will need platelets checked on [**2-29**], (3 days after starting lovenox).
Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): hold if HR <60 or if SBP <90 .
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed: hold for loose stool.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
