He was diagnosed with melanoma in [**2180-3-2**] after an enlarging right axillary lesion was noted on pre-op workup for valvuloplasty.
Biopsy showed BRAF V600E mutated melanoma.
SBP subsequently dropped to 60s, given 2L NS with rapid improvement in SBP to 90-100s.
Labs notable for WBC 64 (near recent baseline), K 2.7, BUN 50, Cr 0.9, BNP 9469, trop 0.01, INR 3.7, lactate 5.4 -> 4.5 after fluids.
CXR showed innumberable metastases in bilateral lungs.
Most recent vital signs afib HR 95 102/58 99% 24-28 on BiPap.
On arrival to the MICU, he is on Bipap 10/5 which has improved his SOB, sats 94% on 50% FIO2.
Unchanged in size from non-con CT scan on [**2180-3-8**] (Hounsfield units 25 on prior non-con scan) - [**2180-3-23**] Biopsy of the R axillary mass and a pigmented R deltoid lesion revealed melanoma, BRAF V600E mutated - [**4-/2180**] Multiple admission for symptomatic CHF due to AS, underwent valvuloplasty.
Past Medical History: - CAD with RCA artherectomy in [**2167**], BMS to LAD in [**2177**] - Coronary artery disease s/p myocardial infarction in [**2169**], [**2177**] - Aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty in [**2180-4-2**] - Hypertension - Systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure - Benign prostatic hypertrophy - Prostate cancer- s/p cryotherapy - Bladder cancer- s/p chemoteherapy - Atrial Fibrillation - Hyperlipidemia - GERD .

[**2180-5-16**] CT chest: IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO [**2180-5-17**]: IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis.
Compared with the prior study (images) reviewed ([**2180-4-11**]), the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed and regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is more apparent.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old man with metastatic melanoma (to lungs, spleen and adrenals), severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.8 cm2) with recent valvuloplasty [**4-/2180**], CAD, systolic CHF with EF 30-35%, who presented with dyspnea and hypotension.
Imaging (CXR and CT chest) showed rapid progression of melanoma with extensive pulmonary involvement.
Echocardiogram showed increased severity of aortic stenosis and worsening left ventricular systolic function.
