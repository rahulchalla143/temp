Compared to the previous tracing of [**2142-6-5**] the rate is slightly faster and no longer bradycardic.
CXR [**2142-7-5**]: Likely left base atelectasis/scarring.
NC HEAD CT [**2142-7-5**]: No acute intracranial process.
BRAIN MRI [**2142-7-7**]:  There is an area of signal abnormality in the right basal ganglia which demonstrates high intense FLAIR signal as well as low FLAIR signal, indicative of a chronic right basal ganglia infarct.
Echo [**2142-7-9**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
BCx [**2142-7-5**]: NGTD, final result pending.
MRSA screen [**2142-7-6**]: negative  Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo F with PMH of 4v CABG ([**2137**]), PVD, ESRD on HD (TTSat) who presented to ED with complaints of HA x2 wks, nausea and emesis for x few days, hypertensive to 200's, and with reported coffee ground emesis in the ED.
Noncontrast head CT was done to rule out a bleed and neuro was consulted.
Nonfocal neuro exam per note and head CT was negative for a bleed, though there was a question of subacute or chronic infarct.
Her lisinopril was uptitrated to 20 mg as her SBP ranged from 140-170.
# ?Infarct: In the ED, head CT was done to evaluate for bleed.
Given the possible subacute infarct, neuro recommended SBP of 180-200s initially to maximize cerebral perfusion.
Recommendation was made for brain MRI and CTA of neck/head for further evaluation.
MRI brain w/o contrast was done to further evaluate, and only showed possible old infarct in basal ganglia without new or subacute infarct.
CTA of neck and head was not done as patient still makes urine and renal thought additional injury with large contrast load would not be advisable.
Neuro recommended blood pressure of SBP>110 as pt does not have evidence of acute stroke, and TTE only showed moderately dilated L atrium, mild symmetric LV hypertrophy and normal global/regional systolic function without septal defect.
Renal recommended SBP of 150-160 and she was continued on home dose amlodipine, metoprolol and mononitrate, and her lisinopril was increased to 20 mg daily for better blood pressure control.
# EKG changes: She had some EKG changes on admission without corresponding symptoms and negative cardiac enzymes.
)(s)* Refills:*2* 12. lisinopril 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
You also had headache, nausea and vomiting, and in the emergency department, had some vomit with blood in it, which cleared quickly.
You were admitted to intensive care unit for monitoring of your blood pressure and vomiting.
Your blood pressure was controlled with your home medications and also with intravenous blood pressure medication.
You had a scan of your head to rule out bleeding in the brain given your headache and high blood pressure.
The scan of your brain did not show any bleeding, but did show a possible old stroke.
You were continued on hemodialysis in the hospital and your blood pressure medications were adjusted to keep your systolic blood pressure in 150-160. .
