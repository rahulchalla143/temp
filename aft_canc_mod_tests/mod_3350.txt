Duplex U/S was done to evaluate noting patent hepatic and portal veins with slow flow in portal vein as on prior study.
Alk phos continued to stay within a range of 150-164 while other LFTs decreased.
He continued to cough and raise thick secretions using suction due to weak cough.
A Video swallow was performed on [**3-7**] showing aspiration of multiple consistencies.
On [**3-8**], a videostroboscopy was done that revealed evidence of significantglottic gap and lack of vocal fold tension, suspected secondary to fatigue, as well as glottic hyperfunction and posterior glottic changes consistent with chronic reflux.
Consideration of muscular strengthening exercises/voice therapy, with repeat evaluation as indicated.
He was maintained on his immunosuppressants with tacro levels checked daily.
