A CT demonstrated 1.large hematoma extending along the entire left posterolateral chest and abdominal wall with unusual cystic structure at the level of the seventh lateral rib with layering hematocrit level and layering contrast within this cyst, suggesting this to be the source for hemorrhage, although no imaging (of this region) was performed during the arterial phase to establish extravasation.
Multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma again noted and grossly unchanged from the prior CT abdomen of [**2201-1-28**].
Enlargement of the right adrenal gland, more prominent than on the CT abdomen of [**2201-1-28**].
Hct continued to drop and another arteriogram was performed which did not show any significant bleeding source.
