Bedside TTE revealed no evidence of pericardial effusion.
She had a CTA which was negative for PE.
She was c/o right LE pain and she had a CT which was negative.
CXR was negative.
In [**1-29**] CT head showed multiple areas of cerebral calcifications--however pt .
In [**2-27**] repeat CT of torso showed regression of all of her mets and she had decreased tumor markers.
PMH: 1. cardiomyopathy from Adriamycin.
TTE [**2142-2-16**]: There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
EF 25-30%.

TTE (Complete) Done [**2144-2-3**] at 3:30:00 PM The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-6-4**], the overall ejection fraction is probably similar.
The prior echo reported global mild hypokinesis, however the inferior and inferolateral segments appeared to have worse function at that time also.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 73 y/o female with metastatic breast ca (bone, liver, lungs, CNS) who p/w weakness and was found to have transient hypotension, initally admitted to the ICU for further evaluation of hypotension, then transferred to the Oncology service for further monitoring.
ECHO results where similar to those of last study.
Blood/urine cultures obtained and negative.
CXR without evidence of infection.
ECHO nondiagnostic for new abnormaliity.
Last treatment was [**1-29**] and also recieving Neupogen.
