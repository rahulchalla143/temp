A serum and urine tox screens were positive for alcohol, benzodiazepine, cocaine, and opiates.
A CT head and neck showed no fractures on wet read.
Ultimately cleared for MRI which showed no major concerning findings and c-collar was discontinued.
Patient was covered with vanco/ctx/flagyl initially and narrowed to CTX/flagyl after sputum cultures grew moraxella.
Patient extubated on [**2183-11-28**] with extended intubation generally atributable to need to obtain cervical MRI rather than respiratory distress.
Past Medical History: Alcoholism, chronic - (active drinker) Polysubstance abuse Intravenous drug abuse.
Family History: (per OMR) Positive for diabetes  Physical Exam: T 97, HR 109, BP 113/84, RR18, O2 98% on RA,  18 GEN: Pt sedated, breathing without respiratory distress, opens eye with sternal rub, no vocalization.

CXR ([**11-30**])In comparison with the study of [**11-29**], there is a decrease in the right basilar consolidation, consistent with resolving aspiration pneumonia.
CT Cspine([**2183-11-26**]): 1.
Exuberant ossification of the ALL, from C5/6 through C7/1, likely related to underlying DISH (based on limited single AP radiograph of the chest); though this is interrupted, there is no evidence of acute fracture.
CT Head ([**2183-11-26**]): 1.
CT T/L spine ([**2183-11-26**]): 1.
MRI Cspine ([**11-28**]): Ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligaments with associated degenerative chagnes, but without evidence of ligamentous injury or an acute fracture or dislocation.
Patient is protecting airway and ABG shows adequate ventilation.
Overnight prior to leaving AMA pt showed improvement on CIWA scale with a high score of 10.
Phenytoin level <0.6.
Head CT without acute process.
At discharge patient afebrile with CXR showing resolution in pneumonia ([**11-30**]).
