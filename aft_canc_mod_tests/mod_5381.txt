CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The lung bases reveal a moderate amount of infiltrate at the lung bases bilaterally.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum and sigmoid appear collapsed but otherwise unremarkable.
Osseous structures again reveal degenerative changes and a Grade II anterolisthesis of L4 onto L5.
AP AND SUPINE ABDOMEN: Diaphragms are not well shown to fully evaluate for free intraperitoneal air.
If there is high suspicion for small bowel obstruction, CT may provide a more accurate assessment.
