A bronchoscopy was performed and showed normal airways.
Her sputum grew out serratia and pseudomonas and she was treated with zosyn.
The patient was initially also treated with gentamycin for double pseudomonas coverage but her culture showed gentamycin resistance.
# Leukocytosis: in addition to the pneumonia as a source of infection, the patient had one blood culture positive for klebsiella on [**2144-3-18**].
Her blood cultures from [**2144-3-19**] were negative.
Her INR rose to 4.8 on [**2144-3-24**] and her coumadin was held.
On [**2144-3-25**] her INR was 4.2.
The presumption was that the increasing INR was secondary to antibiotics and decreased GI flora.
No external signs of blood loss and hct stable at 27.
Patient was discharged to an acute care rehab where her coumadin can be held and her INR can be rechecked in 2 days.
Plan to hold coumadin for an INR > 3.5.
Goal INR [**2-27**].
