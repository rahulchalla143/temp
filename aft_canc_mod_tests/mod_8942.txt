He presented to [**Hospital3 **] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where his INR was 4.7.
Relapsed in the form of abdominal LAD in [**2150**] causing hydronephrosis (has a ureteral stent), path showed follicular lymphoma, treated with 6 x RCVP resulting in PR, last cycle was in [**12-28**].
- Cavitating lesion found in left lung in [**2150**] on CT scan, underwent bronchoscopy after which revealed a likely a BOOP-like reaction although unclear to what (transient infection vs medication reaction).
He was never required to see pulmonology in follow-up - Hypersensitivity skin reaction and pruritis secondary to increased dose of amlodipine, [**2-/2153**] - left urethral stricture repair [**2153-7-3**] - hypertension - hyperlipidemia - CKD Stage III with GFR 43   Social History: Lives with wife.

CKD III who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with a hip fracture.
Pt was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] and had an open biopsy of right femoral neck and a right hip hemiarthroplasty (press-fit) on [**2153-11-30**].
Non-con CT of abdomen and pelvis did show bleeding through right thigh, but no large hematoma or collection that could explain the degree of Hct drop.
Hapto 214, fibrinogen 735, retic 1.3% on [**12-3**], which was low given hct drop.
Pt's Hct was stable at ~28 for 2 days, even after restarting his anticoagulation, initially with heparin drip, for his aortic mechanical valve (see below), and Pt was transferred back out to the floor on [**12-5**].
Pt had another HCT drop on [**12-6**], On the [**Hospital1 **], his hct continued to fall and his rt thigh was very painful, so a CT was repeated of the thigh, but no bleeding was evident.
Heparin should continue until INR therapeutic.
Would monitor daily CBC and INR for now.
Could use transfusion criteria for HCT <25, given heart disease, however given recent acute illness and ?transfusion reaction, would consider more conservative approach and transfuse for HCT drop and/or symptoms.
HCT on day of discharge 24.5. .
Patient's INR in ED 4.7 --> received Vitamin K 5mg IV x1.
His heparin drip was restarted on [**12-5**], then intermittantly stopped [**12-6**] (see above) and then again resumed when CT did not show evidence of acute bleeding.
Heparin drip continued and coumadin was added on [**2153-12-10**] after ensuring HCT stability.
Would continue heparin gtt until INR is therapeutic.
Repeat UCx, BCx, CXR were sent.
Pt did have a pyuria on his admission UA for which empiric Levofloxacin was started, but this was stopped after his urine cultures were negative after 2 days.
Given that CXR and cx's remained negative without further fevers, these antibiotics were dc'd and pt has remained afebrile without a leukocytosis for >48hours.
CT head did not show any concerning process.
Neurology evaluated and recommended MRI w/ DWI to rule out stroke, however patient and family have declined the study due to his severe claustrophobia and resolution of his symptoms.
Resolved back to 1.4 with fluids and clinical improvement overall including [**Month (only) **] transfusion following hct of 17 (see above).
Creatinine remained at baseline while on the medical floor.
Cr 1.3 on day of DC.
#CAD, s/p CABG: HTN, HL, afib- unclear why on both bb and ccb, had post-op afib that resolved.
Home diltiazem was not given during admission as pt did not require this for BP or HR control.
#PPX: --on heparin gtt, started coumadin .
FUROSEMIDE - 20 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth on days with chemotherapy PROPRANOLOL - 80 mg Capsule,Extended Release 24 hr - one Capsule(s) by mouth once a day WARFARIN - 10mg PO on Tuesday, Friday; 7.5mg all other days  Discharge Medications: 1. propranolol 80 mg Capsule,Extended Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule,Extended Release 24 hr PO DAILY (Daily).
IV Heparin drip IV heparin drip according to guidelines for bridging therapy while on coumadin and awaiting therapeutic INR for mechanical aortic valve.
A CT of your thigh did not show any bleeding or other post-operative complication and your anemia improved with [**Hospital1 **] transfusions.
