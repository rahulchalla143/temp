The patient's creatinine continued to rise.
Renal and IVC U/S showed wall-to-wall flow without evidence for thrombus in the IVC at the level of the liver as well as extending approximately 9 cm more inferior to this.
Creatinine peaked at 6.5 on POD 6 and started to trended downward.
On POD11 a CBC revealed a HCT of 20.2 and the patient was subsequently transfused with 3 units of blood.
Serial HCT's were collected q 6 hours, and a abdominal CT without contrast was obtained with the following read: Large mixed-density collection in the left nephrectomy bed consistent with hematoma.
However following transfusion the patients HCT remained stable and for this reason we assume that the hematoma noted on CT was not related to an ongoing bleed.
The patient was given explicit instructions to follow-up in clinic for a CBC,Chem 7, and INR on [**2126-8-2**] at 10am in the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Center and then for an office appointment with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 22714**] at 11:00 am of the same day.
