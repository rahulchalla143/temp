He had a CT scan at [**Hospital1 34**] which revealed diverticular disease, gastrohepatic lymph nodes, and subcentimeter hepatic cysts, as well as gastric distension and moderate splenomegaly.
He then had an EGD which demonstrated a mass at the GE junction that was actively bleeding.
His hematocrit was 50 on presentation, then drifted down to 27 last night.
After a unit of blood his repeat hematocrit was 26, at which point he received two more units of blood.

Admission labs were notable for a Hct of 54.4 with WBC of 22.5.
During his brief hospital course his Hct continued to drop (to a low of 26) warranting a total of 3 PRBC transfusions.
The patient was evaluated by both the Oncology and Gastroenterology teams and a upper endoscopy was performed on hospital day 1 - notable for a large bleeding mass located in the GE junction.
Biopsies were performed and given the high concern for malignancy the patient was prepared for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] SICU for further management.
His hematocrit dropped from 30.9 on [**6-19**] to 24.7 on [**6-21**], so he was transfused a unit of pRBCs.
His hematocrit stabilized and he was transferred to the floor.
On [**6-22**], he underwent a colonoscopy to evaluate for a lower GI bleed given his initial presentation.
The colonoscopy showed dark melenic-appearing stool in the whole colon and terminal ileum, non-bleeding diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, non-bleeding internal hemorrhoids, and otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum.
Also, an endoscopic ultrasound was attempted but failed due to patient agitation.
Throughout the entire time, the patients vital signs were within normal limits and stable, including oxygen saturation (once the measurement was obtainable - originally the patient was refusing pulse ox).
