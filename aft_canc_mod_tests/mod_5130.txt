At that time, a CT abdomen showed a liver with a hyperechoic foci.
She was then sent out to the floor with a plan for a liver biopsy but she developed acute change in mental status.
An MRI was performed that showed multiple acute and subacute embolic lesions.
Drinks 2 gin and tonics per year.

EKG NSR rate 87, normal axis, left bundle, no T wave inversions, Q III, F and STE in V1 V2.
CT [**12-25**]: 1.
MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging would be more sensitive for the detection of an acute infarction.
MRI/MRA Brain [**12-26**]: There are multiple small-to-moderate sized infarcts throughout the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres as well as the punctate left midbrain infarct.
A venous 2D time-of-flight study was derived from an angled sagittal slab.
Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasound [**12-26**]: No evidence of DVT bilaterally.
EEG [**12-26**]: This is an abnormal EEG due to the disorganized and slow background with bursts of generalized delta slowing.
Echo [**12-26**]: Asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Liver cytology [**12-28**]: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CSF [**12-28**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Over the course of the admission, her mental status continued to deteriorate; she became less responsive and her neurologic examination deteriorated.
A liver biopsy was consistent with signet ring adenocarcinoma.
Sedimentation rate < 30 x 2.
Her cholesterol panel high.
ECHO on [**12-26**] demonstrated wall motion abnormality in LAD territory, new compared to ECHO at OSH.
She was given metoprolol during her admission orally, and her blood pressure was managed with a labetalol drip.
Her hypertension was particularly labile, which was thought to be secondary to autonomic dysfunction.
# Rash: She developed a rash on her back, arms, and belly, thought to be consistent with contact dermatitis but other etiologies include vasculitis vs. PRES vs. drug rash were considered.
# Hyperglycemia: Blood sugar was high on admission, but was controlled with a regular insulin sliding scale.
Her electrolytes were monitored and repleted as needed.
