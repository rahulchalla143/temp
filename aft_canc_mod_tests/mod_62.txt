In the ED he was noted to have atrial fibrillation to 140-160s with SBP 145/65.
He had an echocardiogram that was done by ED staff that revealed a pericardial effusion.
He had a formal echocardiogram that showed a moderate pericardial effusion (2cm) and no evidence of tamponade, though limited by suboptimal study due to RVR.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] has not seen a doctor (with the exception for his eye and hearing issues) since age 16. .

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM AT ADMISSION: EKG demonstrated atrial fibrillation at 162 with normal axis, no LVH by voltage criteria, normal intervals, no ischemic changes.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2174-9-29**]): There is diffuse symmetric enlargement of the ventricles and sulci consistent with mild-to-moderate age-related atrophy.
Paranasal sinuses and ethmoid air cells are normally pneumatized and clear.
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2174-9-29**]): There is asymmetric interstitial septal thickening with some nodularity involving the entire right lung.
Study was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, but no abnormalities are identified.
.. ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2174-9-28**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
LV systolic function appears borderline depressed (difficult to assess to very rapid and irregular pulse).
LV/RV systolic function are preserved (difficult to assess due to irregular and very rapid pulse) .. ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2174-9-29**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-9-28**] LV function appear normal (largely secondary to a lower ventricular response rate in atrial fibrillation).
A repeat echo showed little interval progression.
We order a CT chest to evaluate his lung fields and possibly shed light on the etiology of the pericardial effusion.
We discussed the findings with Mr. [**Known lastname 1924**] and explained to him that further work-up to diagnose and potentially treat his condition would involve tissue biospy and additional imaging.
Furthermore, echocardiogram did not show any focal hypokinesis or akinesis to suggest myocardial infarction.
His echocardiogram showed a normal EF of 55-60%.
At time of discharge, his rate is 80-100 while lying in bed and increases to 150s when he is walking.
His systolic blood pressure and oxygen sat are 120s and mid to low 90s, respectively, during these episodes.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal and CT was negative for acute process.
Chest CT showed no infiltrate but did show diffuse nodules and adenopathy concerning for malignancy.
Blood and urine cultures were negative and there were no localizing symptoms.
White count was WNL with no bands on the differential.
Further work-up would require tissue sample of his pericardial effusion or mediastinal lymph nodes.
.. # RENAL FAILURE:  Urine electrolyes were consistent with prerenal azotemia.
.. # ANEMIA:  Iron, TSH, vitamin B12 and folate studies were normal.
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
We are sending you home and have asked a nurse to come to your house to check your blood pressure and heart rate so we know if the medicines are working.
