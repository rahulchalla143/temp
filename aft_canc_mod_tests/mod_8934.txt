CXR [**6-1**]: AP semiupright view.
Head CT [**5-24**]: FINDINGS:  Patient motion and positioning within the scanner somewhat limits assessment.
Ct scan of the facial bones suggested.
CT Sinus, prelim read: 2.4 x 1.4 cm expansile mass in the left maxillary alveolar ridge.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
The estimated pulmonary  artery systolic pressure is normal.
Urine Culture:  URINE CULTURE (Final [**2117-5-27**]):       PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA.
Pt became more arousable overnight with continued BIPAP, repeat ABG 7.38/65/188.
Repeat ABGs with pCO2 as high as 80, pH>7.30.
CHF exacerbation - EF 55-60% on TTE, evidence of diastolic dysfunction (see results above).
Difficult to evaluate fluid status on CXR although he did have marked LE edema on exam, and elevated BNP suggested CHF exacerbation.
# Mass L maxillary ridge- this was noted incidentally on Head CT performed in MICU.
It was followed up with a CT sinus, the prelim read of which showed a mass concerning for ameloblastoma.
Final read of sinus CT was pending at time of discharge and should be follow up by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
# UTI - treated with ceftriaxone and then cefepime in-house and discharged on the rest of a 12 day course (see urine culture above) .

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: COPD Exacerbation, Diastolic CHF, Frontal Sinus Osteoma .
Secondary: Type II DM, well-controlled HTN CAD Morbid obesity Decubitus Ulcer Hemorrhagic cystitis   Discharge Condition: Stable, O2 sats 88-92% on 4L (on home O2)   Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or go to the ER if you have any shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers, chills, cough, or any other symptoms that concern you.
