TBNA bx: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS  BM bx [**2190-12-17**]: consistent with possible myeloproliferative disorder.
History of Present Illness: The patient is an 83M with a history of CHF (with diastolic dysfunction, EF>55%), first degree AV block ([**Month/Day/Year 4448**] placed [**5-18**]), intermittent atrial fibrillation, RA on chronic prednisone, and diabetes, who now presents with decreased po intake, increased fatigue, weight loss, insomnia, and chronic intractable hiccups.
His w/u during the last admission included chest/Ab CT that showed hilar and paraaortic lymphadeopathy, and an abdominal ultrasound that was suspicious for cirrhosis.
Pt's BP improved to 95/50s, but no higher.
Last echo [**7-16**] w/ EF >55%, diastolic dysfunction.
Holter [**2187**]: SR w/ moderate PR prolongation, AEA w/ runs of atrial tachycardia, 2 beat run of VT 2.
Cirrhosis (consistent findings on recent ultrasound, but not seen on CT abdomen [**11-24**])   Social History: The patient lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) **] Corner.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: 96.6, 98/60, 80, 22, 97% RA Gen - thin, fatigued, somnolent but arousable, lying in bed HEENT - PEERL 3 -> 2mm bilaterally.
Reflexes 1+ paterally bilaterally, 0 ankle jerks bilaterally, babinski downgoing bilaterally, sensation intact to light touch in hands and feet.
DPs 1+ bilaterally, PTs not palpable bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: CT chest/abdomen [**2190-12-15**]: 1.
These are hard to compare to the prior study secondary to differences in the phase of contrast enhancement.
UNILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND [**12-21**]: No DVT.
CXR [**12-22**]:IMPRESSION: Minimal patchy left basilar opacity, most likely due to atelectasis.
CT neck and LUE [**12-23**]: prelim read showing crhonic occlusion of RIJV with abnormal filling of L subclavian and L branchiocephalic veins, awaitin gfinal report.

Also with worrisome intra-abdominal and mediastinal lymphadeopathy due to unknown cause, continually elevated alkaline phosphatase, hyponatremia, ARF.
In the MICU he remained afebrile and studies were negative for a source of infection.
Mediastinal and para-aortic LAD on CT chest [**11-24**].
Lung CA, colon CA, HCC, cholangioCA, lymphoma were on our ddx, though no lymphoblastic predominance or abnormal forms on peripheral blood smear.
- Abdominal u/s this admission found the LAD to be stable from previous scan, with no nodes amenable to CT-guided bx.
- pt had splenic U/S [**12-16**] which showed: enlarged spleen at 14.6 cm, innumberable hypodense foci, most subcentimeter in size, but up to 1-2cm, overall concerning for lymphoma.
- given splenic findings, heme/once was consulted, performed BM bx on [**12-17**] that was consistent with a possible myeloproliferative disorder (?CML) and not explanatory for his FTT - the interventional pulmonary service performed a BAL and TBNA on [**12-20**] that was also non-diagnostic, returning negative for malignancy cells - thoracic surgery has arranged for an outpatient appointment on [**12-28**] at which the pt and his family can learn about the risks and benefits of mediastinoscopy as the next step in attempt to get a tissue diagnosis.
There was an area of erythema on the volar side of his forearm which was concerning for cellulitis, but the pt's temp and white count remained normal, the area of erythma resolvesd, and there was no evidence of fluctuance.
LUE u/s done [**12-21**] was negative for DVT, and CT of the neck and LUE was done on [**12-23**] to rule out an obstructing lesion.
The read on that study was pending on the day of discharge.
Pt admitted with WBC 23.
- pt was given stress dose steroid peri-bronchoscopy and responded well - throughout his admission, he was monitored for signs of infection; his pulmonary status and abdominal exam remained stable throughout.
Very concerning on admission as BP was 80/40.
Further shock/sepsis workup was negative, including ROMI x3, CXR no PNA, UA negative, UCx no growth.
- his antihypertensives were held throughout this admission due to hypotension - he had a foley catheter to monitor urine output, it was d/c'd on [**12-22**] - CXR [**12-15**] showed improved CHF and no PNA, CXR [**12-22**] showed some atelectasis - pt was diuresed with lasix on [**12-16**] and [**12-21**], then restarted on his po home regimen of lasix 80 mg qd and spironolactone 25mg po qd.
- As per nutrition team's recommendation, pt was given sugar-free shakes with meals to supplement po intake which should continue after discharge - his electrolytes were repleted as necessary throughout his stay: his serum calcium never increased to a normal level over the course of his stay.
- sodium was stable at 130-131 over the last week of his admission.
On exam there was edema and erythema of L knee, with ternderness to palpation but normal ROM.
Liver and gallbladder unremarkable on abdominal CT scan.
Baseline Cr 0.9, bumped to 1.4, now back to 0.8-0.9 over the last week of his stay.
Medications on Admission: - prednisone 5mg po qd - furosemide 80mg po qam, 40 mg po qpm - spironolactone 50mg po qd - colchicine 0.6mg - metronidazole 500mg po tid x 9 days - atenolol 25mg po qd - prochlorperazine 10mg po prn hiccups - ASA 325mg po qd - insulin glargine - pantoprazole 40mg po qd - levofloxacin 500mg po qd x 9 days - nystatin swish and swallow prn qid  Discharge Medications: 1.
