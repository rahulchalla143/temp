However, she did state that on [**2175-11-1**] she experienced an atraumatic fracture of her femur, which was corroborated by accompanying records.
Her most recent hematocrit from the OSH is 20.2.
On [**2175-6-5**], CT scan of the pelvis and thigh obtained at [**Hospital1 83480**] showed a cavitated thick-walled soft tissue mass in the superficial soft tissues of the mid left thigh with air fluid level and a superior focus that appeared to be draining to the skin.
Pelvic images were said to be normal, with enlarged "hyperemic" lymph nodes in the left groin.
Additionally, an incisional biopsy of 1 of the mushroom-like masses was obtained.
The biopsy specimen measured  1.0 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm; the surface was "focally hemorrhagic and slightly friable."
Metastatic workup revealed adenopathy involing the iliac vessles and superficial inguinal region.
Within the left pelvis, although only one lymph node was positive, there was a second lymph node, which showed tumor within the afferent lymphatics but not within the true lymph node sinuses or parenchyma.
Iron deficiency anemia - During workup for her SCC she underwent an endoscopy and colonoscopy which showed no cause for her anemia.
She was treated with IV iron dextran and epo which brought her Hct to the low 30's.

Femur XRay ([**11-3**]): There is an oblique fracture at roughly the mid diaphyseal level with nearly one shaft width lateral displacement of the distal fragment.
CXR ([**11-4**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, a double-lumen Port-A-Cath has been placed in right pectoral position.
The pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis is less severe than on the previous examination.

She had a Hct 15.8 and INR 3.3.
She was taken emergently to the OR, where she underwent fixation with intramedullary nail, and bone biopsy (results pending) with minimal blood loss.
She was oriented and awake with SBP 115s; she recieved IVFs; morphine PCA.
Post op, she was found to have a leukocytosis of 18, Na 127, hct 20.5, and received Ancef.
Urine lytes were consistent with SIADH, which was thought to be secondary to post-op pain.
Na on discharge was 129. .
As she is Jehova's witness she refused any blood transfusions.
Her Hct on discharge was stable at 20.6. .
# Electrolytes: Patient had persistent hypokalemia to 2's and hypophosph to 1's.
Calcium levels remained stable at 9.2-10.4.
# Sinus Tachycardia: Patient was persistently tachycardic with HR in 130s-150s.
An evaluation for etiologies such as PE or infection was planned, and the importance of this was explained.
Patient refused blood cultures as an inpatient.
Please check blood cultures and a CT-PA upon arrival to [**Hospital3 **].
Urine cultures were negative and the patient refused blood cultures.
CXR not significant for focal parenchymal opacities.
Please check blood cultures upon arrival to [**Hospital1 6687**].
A LE U/S was planned, although the patient wished to pursue further evaluation at [**Hospital3 22439**].

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Left femur fracture Right shoulder fracture Anemia Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma   Discharge Condition: Stable: T 96.1; 124/68; HR 136; 95/RA   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because of your Left femur fracture.
Your hematocrit prior and after the surgery was low.
You refused blood transfusion and so we treated you with a medication called erythropoietin so that you can make more red blood cells.
Your electrolytes were low and so we repleted many of your electrolytes.
The following changes have been made to your medications: (1) We increased the dose of your MS Contin from 30mg twice a day to 45 mg twice a day (2) We have changed your Morphine pain medication from PO to IV, when you are able to tolerate PO medication you can switch back (3) We have changed your PO Zofran IV (4) We have started you on tylenol for pain and multivitamin (5) We have started you on lovenox for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis; this should be continued for four weeks (6) We have started you on erythropoietin 10,000U Mon, Wed, Fri.  You will receive your first dose at [**Hospital3 22439**] (5) We have restarted your labetalol, but have held your amlodipine.
They will also need to check your electrolytes as these were depleted during your hospitalization.
Your serum sodium should also be followed as these levels were low.
