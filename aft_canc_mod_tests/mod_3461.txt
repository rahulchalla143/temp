# Elevated INR/Anemia: Patient presented with a HCT 25.5(baseline Hct 25-29) and INR of 11.9 (coumadin for afib).
HCT dropped to 23 so patient transfused 1 unit PRBCs, and HCT appropriately increased to 27 however it dropped to 23 again the following day and patient again transfused with 1 unit PRBC and 2 units FFP with appropriate HCT improvement and INR down to 1.8.
CT scan was done without contrast that ruled out retroperitoneal bleed.
Patient remained HD stable with HCT >26 and was transferred to the floor.
After being transferred to the floor, patient's INR was 2.1.
As she has no clinical evidence of chronic liver disease, and her albumin is 2.6, her elevated INR was attributed to moderate malnutrition.
Patient is anticoaguated, INR on discharge is 2.6, on Warfarin 1mg daily - Check INR [**6-5**] and redose warfarin as needed - Continue Metoprolol .
baseline Cr 0.9-1.3 and presented with Cr 1.9.
tincture of opium was held in the ICU given altered mental status; patient was restarted on full outpatient diarrhea regimen (including tincture of opium and tylenol with codeine) upon transfer to the medicine floor, with rapid improvement in symptoms.
