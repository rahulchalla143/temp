Ambulatory saturations remained >93%.
High-grade Cardiac Lymphoma - The patient was due to have his third cycle of R-[**Hospital1 **] during the second week in [**Month (only) 547**].
Once the patient showed clinical improvement and his chest CT from [**Hospital3 12748**] was received by [**Hospital1 18**] and reviewed by radiology with a favorable comparison to his pre-cycle 2 CT, he was given a third cycle of R-[**Hospital1 **].
DVT - Patient had a temporary IVC filter placed during his last admission given the thought that he was too high risk for anti-coagulation.
