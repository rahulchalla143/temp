CXR [**2137-3-29**]: In comparison to study performed earlier the same day, lung volumes are decreased.
Repeat PA and lateral radiographs with better inspiration would be helpful for further evaluation.
CXR [**2137-3-31**]: Heart size remains normal.
Lung volumes are increased compared to the recent radiograph, and recently described new bibasilar opacities have nearly resolved with only minimal linear atelectasis remaining.
Poorly defined right apical opacity has slightly decreased in size since prior studies and is likely due to slowly resolving infection based on appearance on [**2137-3-2**] chest CT. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally.
The patient had a stable hematocrit and did not require any transfusions while in the ICU, but did receive 2U of PRBC for a Hct of 23.5 on the day of discharge.
