Large posterior osteophytes and PLL ossification at C3-C4 causing significant narrowing of the spinal canal in the setting of trauma, cord contusion cannot be excluded and if focal neurologic deficit, a MR for further evaluation is recommended.
[**2189-3-18**] Cardiac echo : The left atrium is elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

[**2189-3-18**] MRI C/T/L spine : 1.
Acute compression of the T3, T5, T6, T7, and T12 vertebral bodies.
[**2189-3-19**] Head CT : 1.
His GCS on admission was 15 however he soon became very agitated and eventually required intubation and sedation to keep him calm.
His chest xray showed a large right pleural effusion and he had a chest tube placed which drained about 1 liter of blood.
He had a small subdural hematoma and subsequent head Ct's showed no increase.
He had a speech and swallow evaluation and failed secondary to aspiration therefore a dobhoff feeding tube was placed and remains in place,  Hopefully as his mental status improves the study can be repeated.
