His CVL was flushed with 20 mL of NS prior to infusion but after his nurse tried to withdraw blood from the line his eyes rolled to the left side, he became extremely somnolent and was not able to move his left side.
He was taken emergently for CTA head which showed no focal abnormality of transit time or blood flow to suggest a focus of infarction/ischemia and no ICH.
He was then taken to MRI and this was unremarkable.

CT w/out Contrast Torso [**2111-9-6**] 1.
MRI w/and w/out constrast head  [**2111-9-5**]:  Interval development of non-enhancing white matter abnormalities predominantly in the right parietal and occipital lobes.
CT w and w/o Contrast of HEAD on [**2111-8-30**]: 1.
Please note that the head is not completely included on the CT angiogram study.
MRI w/o contrast of HEAD [**2111-8-30**] 1.
These may represent tiny foci of gas, with accurate assessment of the attenuation value on the prior CT being limited due to volume averaging artifact.
MRI w/o contrast of Head [**2111-9-5**]: Interval development of non-enhancing white matter abnormalities predominantly in the right parietal and occipital lobes.
CT torso w/out contrast [**2111-9-6**] 1.
MRI and CT of his brain did not show evidence of infarct but raised question of air emboli in right parietal lobe which was thought to be the cause of the initial event.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], Mr. [**Known lastname 33419**] was intubated and an LP was performed which was unremarkable.
A 24 hour EEG demonstrated slow right sided sharp waves which may have served as epilogenic focus, but no seizures.
Repeat MRI imaging demonstrated white matter lesions in the right parietal and occipital lobes with slow flow through the left transverse sinus which were not visualized on the first MRI.
An MRA/MRV was suggested but not completed due to the requirement of medication to have the study completed.
Coagulase negative Staphylococcus bacteremia:  Blood cultures from [**9-14**], [**9-15**], and [**9-16**] grew three different strains of coagulase negative staph aureus, all sensitive to vancomycin.
The tip culture likewise was positive for the same organisms.
# New pulmonary infiltrate on chest CT: A chest CT on HD 7 demonstrated new pulmonary infiltrates concerning for an aspiration event while Mr. [**Known lastname 33419**] was altered.
Mr. [**Known lastname 62232**] pulmonary exam was persistently unremarkable.
Because of concern that the cyclosporine could be contributing to his altered state, Mr. [**Known lastname 62232**] home cyclosporine levels were decreased and his home prednisone was increased.
micafungin was changed to oral posaconazole on HD 12 and LFTs were trended.
HTN: During his admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 33419**] was noted to have elevated blood pressures, with diastolic pressures over 100.
Upper extremity U/S demonstrated no evidence of SVC syndrome.
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Levsin/SL 0.125 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tablet Sublingual three times a day as needed for abdominal cramping: To be taken NO MORE than three times a day.
Mepron 750 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Ten (10) mL PO once a day.
Posaconazole 200 mg/5 mL (40 mg/mL) Suspension Sig: Five (5) mL PO TID (3 times a day).
CLL 3. coagulase negative staphylococcus bacteremia 4.
A CT scan and MRI of your brain did not show any signs of stroke, and we tested you for a possible infection of the brain which was also negative.
