His PSA nadired at 0.6 in [**2099**], but has been rising since, with a doubling time of about 2 years.
He recently had a bone scan that was negative.
Recently, however, on a CT scan from [**6-8**] the mass had been found to increase to 12 cm in largest dimension as compared to 6 cm in [**10-7**].
An MRI of the abdomen in [**8-8**] was consistent with hemorrhage into an angiomyolipoma, however a CT of the abdomen just 2 weeks later demonstrated an increase in size to 18 cm, with concern for transformation to carcinoma.
Also demonstrated on this CT were new scattered non-calcified b/l pulmonary nodules < 5 mm in diameter.
A repeat abdominal MRI done at the end of [**Month (only) 205**] confirmed the marked increase in size of the adrenal mass, additionally demonstrating at least 4 new focal liver lesions ranging in size from 6-8 mm.
On arrival to the ED on the day of admission, his vitals were 97.8, HR 72, BP 157/65, RR 26, 95% RA.
His labs were notable for a hct of 26, down from 33 on [**8-17**], as well as a mild leukocytosis of 14.
His INR was 2.3 (on coumadin).
An EKG showed AF, with mild T wave flattening and ?low voltage in limb leads.
He had a CT of the abdomen which revealed interval development of large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis, the overall appearance and bilateral nature of which was felt to be most c/w failure; interval development and increase in size of numerous pulmonary nodules, as well as a slight interval increase in the previously described large left adrenal mass.
An NG lavage was negative, though he was guaiac positive.
Past Medical History: 1) Chronic arthritis 2) Adenocarcinoma of the prostate in [**2097**], s/p radiation.
Adrenal myelolipoma, first noted on CT in [**2100**], relatively stable in size until large increase from [**2104**] to [**2106**].
3) Non-insulin dependent diabetes with peripheral neuropathy 4) Atrial fibrillation on coumadin 5) CVA x 2 6) Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance 7) Mitral regurgitation:  Last echo [**12-9**] showed EF 55%, moderately dilated RA and LA, 1+ MR, [**2-6**]+ TR, and moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension.
8) Gastric polyps:  Seen on EGD [**7-10**] with the appearance of recent bleeding.
Physical Exam: VS:  98.7, 66, 171/84, RR 24, 97% on 2L via NC Gen:  Cachectic caucasian male appearing slightly tachypneic with some accessory muscle use, but otherwise comfortable and conversant.
Neck:  JVP at approx 10 cm, no bruits.
Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion at both bases, mild rales just above dullness b/l.
[**2107-9-26**] CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS, IMPRESSION: 1.
The differential includes metastatic disease, although the rapidity of the change compared to the prior study makes this unusual, and infectious etiologies, particularly given the surrounding ground glass.
[**9-26**] CXR PA and lat:  IMPRESSION: CHF.
Had worsening respiratory distress on [**2107-10-3**]/ Oxygen saturations began dropping on non-rebreather.
