TECHNIQUE: Post-gadolinium contrast images were obtained in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes as per presurgical planning protocol.
Differential diagnostic considerations include primary CNS malignancy (such as GBM) or solitary metastases.
CT brain Wet Read: JXKc TUE [**2181-3-27**] 11:54 PM Post-op changes from right parietal resection with increase in vasogenic edema, and leftward shift of midline and subfalcine herniation of 10 mm (previously, 4mm).
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained without IV contrast.

On POD#1 pt was transfered to the floor with left neglect (old) with left drift/ CT stable.
On the early evening, pt with lethargy, Ct stable, dilantin changed to Keppra.
Second stat CT of the day showed increased edema with MLS.
MRI completed wihtout signs of stroke.
She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] / neuro-onc to formulate a plan as her pathology was finalized as GBM stage IV.
Her exam continued to improve.
On [**2181-3-31**] a routine CT was done to follow resolution and or improvement of edema.
On [**2181-4-2**] CT imaging was completed and she was cleared for d/c to home with services by Physical therapy.
?You will not need an MRI of the brain as this was done during your hospitalization.
