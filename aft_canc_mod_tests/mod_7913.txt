Imaging: Chest radiograph ([**2111-12-11**]): 1.
Recommend correlation with history of malignancy and chest CT for further evaluation.
TTE ([**2111-12-12**]): The left and right atria are moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid barrel and complete airway surveillance was done to subsegmental bronchi.
Brief Hospital Course: -please check CBC and CHEM 7 in 1 week to monitor for resolution of isolated thrombocytosis, check renal function, potassium after starting ACE-i .
79F w/PMH significant for bronchiectasis, afib s/o IR guided embolization for hemoptysis now called out from MICU for continued medical management of VAP; episode of chest pain during admission w/EKG changes, CEs negative x 3. .
She had a repeat bronch showing no bleeding but copiuous secretions concerning for a VAP which was treated as below.
Her hematocrits remained stable and after consultation with her PCP it was decided that she would no longer be an anticoagulation candidate but could be restarted on asprin 325mg daily for stroke prevention in setting of AFib with recent TIAs.
A bronch revealed no bleeding but copious secretions concerning for VAP.
She was treated with Vanc and Zosyn until sputum and BAL cultures grew out two strains GNRS and antibiotics were broadened to Tobramycin.
Had episodes of afib with RVR in ICU, now resolved.
Denied abdominal pain, N/V, remained afebrile; C. diff negative x 2 and no leukocytosis.
# Chest pain: 30 minute episode of L sided chest pressure [**4-1**] days prior to discharge, resolved with SLNG x 1, dynamic EKG changes notable for ST depressions in lateral leads, resolved when chest pain free.
Echo performed earlier this admission w/dilated atria, intact systolic function.
Patient was on atorvastatin 80mg as an inpatient, but switched to simvastatin 40mg on discharge in light of LDL of 119, lisinopril 5mg for improved BP control, cardiac/renal protection.
Sodium within known range, improved with 250cc NS bolus, free water restriction to 1L/day.
Na 136 on discharge.
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Outpatient Lab Work Check CBC and CHEM-7 in 1 week ([**2112-1-5**]) to monitor for resolution of isolated thrombocytosis & check renal function and potassium after starting lisinopril.
The bleeding was controlled and you did not have any more cough with blood after the breathing tube was taken out.
- INCREASE Toprol XL to 150mg daily by mouth for your heart rate and blood pressure - INCREASE aspirin to 325mg daily by mouth for your heart and to thin your blood .
- START simvastatin 40mg by mouth daily for your heart - START lisinopril 5mg by mouth daily for your heart and blood pressure - START quetiapine 12.5 mg at night as needed for anxiety/insomnia .
In 1 week ([**2112-1-5**]) you should get outpatient lab work to check a CBC and CHEM-7 in  to monitor for resolution of your high platelet count & check your kidney function and potassium after starting lisinopril.
