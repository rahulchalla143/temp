She developed a fever to 102 F, hypotension to SBP 90s today, and came to our emergency room.
In the emergency room, her temperature was 102.6 F, HR 130s (sinus tachycardia), and systolic BP 90s-100s (baseline SBP 120s-130s).
Her WBC was 0.3 with no neutrophils or bands.
Her U/A showed no WBC but there was nitrates and bacteria.
Her serum lactate was 3.9.
Blood and urine cultures were sent.
Her chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism, but there was mild left lung apical patchy ground-glass opacity; there was a question of atelectasis versus pneumonia.
She received oxygen at 7 liters via nasal cannula in the emergency room but her systolic BP persisted in 90s-100s.
Emergency Department did not start on sepsis protocol because her serum lactate was not > 4 and she was responsive to fluid, despite the elevated temperature, heart rate, and WBC.
Physical Exam: Physical Examination: Vital Signs: Temperature 102.6 F in Emergency Department; Current Temperature 100.2 F; Heart Rate 108; Blood Pressure 106/56; Respiratory Rate 16; Oxygen Saturation 99% on 2 Liters.
She has 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally Neurologic Examination:  Her mental status is intact.
Her motor strength is [**4-15**] motor in RUE; LUE examination limited due to pain at elbow.
Her reflexes are 2- but her ankle jerks are absent.
Sensory examination reveals normal sensory examination.
Coordination examination does not reveal dysmetria.

MRI of L elbow: MR LEFT ELBOW WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a moderate elbow joint effusion.
CT OF THE CHEST: There are no significant axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
There is a patchy ground-glass opacity in the left upper lobe near the apex that is new when compared to the prior study and of unclear significance.

Neutropenic Fever/Hypotension:  In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated, and her blood pressure responded without any pressor.
In the setting of neutropenic fever, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and azithromycin (for atypical pneumonia), as well as gentamicin x 1 dose in context of continued destabilization and need for double gram negative coverage.
Central venous pressure improved to [**6-23**] over the course of 48 hours, and blood pressures stabilized.
X-ray and MRI did not reveal osteomyelitis.
CXR showed small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
With incentive spirometry use, the patient's sat improved to 95% on RA.
Given on steroids, FS blood glucose was checked 4 times daily and they were mostly in the 100's, not requiring a long acting insulin.
Prophylaxis: Sliding scale insulin and finger stick blood glucose given on steroids; PPI, subcutaneous heparin, and bowel regimen were administered as well.
