She was complaining of abd pain and and noncontrast abd CT was done to rule out AAA.
There was no AAA on CT but there was diffuse stranding surrounding the colon consistent with pancolitis.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt's BP dropped again into the 80s and she given another liter of IVF.
Of note, pt was recently diagnosed with recurrent emdometrial carcinoma in [**4-10**] when she presented to the ED for abdominal pain and had a CT abdomen which showed extensive omental involvement.
During her hospital course she had several episodes of chest pain but cardiac cath was deferred.
CT showed new (from [**3-10**]) omental soft tissue infiltation c/w metastatic carcinomatosis, with ascites.
She underwent exploratory laparotomy, drainage of ascites,total omentectomy and radical dissection for tumor debulking [**2127-4-28**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**].
The omentum and ascending colon mass showed extensive involvement by papillary serous adenocarcinoma.

Repeat Abdominal CT: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 83 yr old female with hx of CAD, recurrent endometrial cancer s/p recent debulking surgery who presents with chest pain and abd pain, hypotension and found to have colitis on abd CT .
Serial abd exams were performed; surgery was consulted and felt that given clinical picture of diarrhea with toxic granulations, and pancolitis, most c/w C diff colitis, therefore recs po flagyl, no levo and nonoperative case.
We followed her lactate levels given concern for mesenteric ischemia, however lactate is WNL x 2, with guiaic negative, so less likely.
- On [**7-6**] she was looking worse and a repeat CT was performed, this showed worsening of her pancolitis.
There was some difficulty obtaining labs but when obtained she was noted to have a metabolic acidosis, felt to be due to diarrhea, and a stable HCT.
Attempts at a blood gas were unsuccessful.
An ABG was performed at that time which showed Po2 74* Pco2 23* pH 7.19 with a lactate of 7.0.
She was started on levophed, neosynephrine, and vasopressin, but despite all efforts her blood pressure continued to decline.
Despite all efforts, we were unable to support her blood pressure.
Her BP remained stable on the floor, and her central line was discontinued.
We ruled out MI with 3 sets cardiac enzymes negative.
EKG was without ischemic changes, telemetry monitoring was without arrhythmia.
ARF: On d/c 2 weeks ago, creatinine of 1.0 and now elevated to 2.3.
UA negative for infection and no new drugs to implicate AIN.
Creatinine trended down from 2.3, responding well to hydration.
Urine lytes consistent with prerenal azotemia.
Metabolic Acidosis: Pt with gap of 15 so pt with both gap and non-gap metabolic acidosis (based on delta-delta gap).
Her last carboplatin was [**6-26**].
Citalopram Hydrobromide 20 mg qd 3.
Clotrimazole 1 % Cream 9.
