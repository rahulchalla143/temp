His pathology sides have been reviewed here at the [**Hospital1 69**] and have shown a micro-papillary variant which tends to be very aggressive.
His cystoprostatectomy will be performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 986**].
He had a CT scan and bone scan in [**2118-10-13**], prior to his chemotherapy that showed no evidence of metastatic disease.
He had a recent prostate biopsy because of a prostatic nodule which showed no malignancy.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems on pre-surgical evaluation showed mild urinary urgency after BCG treatment and had decreased erectile function.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs were 130/88; pulse 78 and regular; respiratory rate was 16 and unlabored.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 6.7, hematocrit 35, platelet count 267, BUN and creatinine are 20 and 1.0.
Urinalysis dipstick was three plus glucose; otherwise unremarkable.
He had a preoperative CT scan repeated that did not show any evidence of metastatic disease at that time.
blood loss.
Urine output was not complete measured but was thought to be "very good" per the Anesthesia Record.
His postoperative hematocrit was 32.
Sodium was 138, potassium was 4.8, BUN and creatinine were 17 and 1.0.
His epidural was titrated back to help enhance his blood pressure.
X-rays showed no pneumothorax and he had a left subclavian line that was in appropriate position.
He was requiring significant fluid boluses to keep his mean arterial pressure in the 50s to 70s.
Central venous pressures were measured to be around 12.
Ultimately, his urine output through his suprapubic tube picked up.
His hematocrit at this time was 23.9.
Creatinine was 0.8.
His INR was 1.5.
His epidural was still being utilized, but it had been titrated back and he was now on a total regimen of epidural and PCA for pain control.
His post transfusion hematocrit was 27.3.
His BUN and creatinine were 12.0 and 0.7 respectively.
His examination was otherwise benign.
The [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] outputs had dropped off on the left side, but the right [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] was noted to increase immediately after the stent removal.
The fear for a possible urine leak status post stent removal was investigated and creatinine values on the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were drawn.
The patient did very well over the next couple of days and ultimately, by postoperative day number eight, he was afebrile with a temperature of 98.6 F., pulse 80, blood pressure 140/90; respiratory rate was 20 with 98% room air saturation.
His right [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] outputs were averaging 100 to 150 q. shift, and his left [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] out between 30 and 50 cc.
Blood sugars were adequately controlled just on diet, ranging 106 to 112.
His examination was otherwise unremarkable.
Steri-Strips were in place at this point postoperatively.
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] sites were secure times two.
The remainder of his examination was unremarkable.
He will have a cystogram to test the patency of the neobladder in approximately two weeks from time of discharge.
