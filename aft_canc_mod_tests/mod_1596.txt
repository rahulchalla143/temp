The VNA nurse took the patient's blood pressure, which was reportedly very low, and she was brought to the ED in an ambulance.
She had monoclonal bands in her unrine and her serum, and a bone marrow biopsy was performed as part of the workup for restrictive cardiomyopathy.
While VNA was at her home, the patient stood up this morning and her blood pressure decreased dramatically to 60/palpation, resulting in near syncope.
In the ED her blood pressure was 92/65, HR 74, RR 18, saturating 98% on 4L NC.
Her hematocrit was 36, up from 31.
CARDIAC HISTORY: Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure, thought to be restrictive cardiomyopathy (multiple myeloma versus cardiac amyloid) -CABG: none -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: none -PACING/ICD: none 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Hiatal Hernia - GERD - Syncopal episode in remote past   Social History: Lives at home alone, but has VNA services 3x/wk.
-Tobacco history: none -ETOH: none -Illicit drugs: none   Family History: No family history of CHF, sudden cardiac death  Physical Exam: Admission Exam VS: T=96.3 BP=100/66 HR=70 RR=20 O2 sat=98 2L GENERAL: Cachectic female.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Radial 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Radial 2+   Pertinent Results: [**2121-9-22**] 12:45PM   CK-MB-10 MB INDX-6.5* proBNP-[**Numeric Identifier 24248**]* [**2121-9-22**] 12:45PM   cTropnT-0.41* [**2121-9-22**] 12:45PM   CK(CPK)-154  Brief Hospital Course: HYPOTENSION/CHF: JVD, distant heart sounds, low voltage on EKG, enlarged RA and LA, lower extremity edema, pulm edema on CXR, suggest congestive heart failure,  possibly restrictive in nature.
Pt's "air hunger" and SOB was treated symptomatically with lasix and morphine.
# RHYTHM: Pt with first degree AV nodal block on EKG on admission.
EKG during hypotensive episode was bradycardic.
On this admission creatinine is 2.1-2.2 range.
