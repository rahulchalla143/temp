Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation, as seen on recent CT. Further evaluation with ERCP or MRCP is recommended.
CXR ([**10-4**]):  FINDINGS: There is progressive increase in diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities, consistent with rapid accumulation of moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.
Elevation of the right minor fissue is suggestive of volume loss/atelectasis in the right upper lobe.
Echo ([**10-3**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
A straight tip 0.035 in dreamwire was placed.
Biliary obstruction/cholangitis: The patient's CT and RUQ ultrasound both suggestive of biliary obstruction.
On [**10-10**] she underwent repeat ERCP to replace the plastic stents with a metal stent, as the previous stent had slipped.
Despite this replacement, it is possible that the blockage will recur, in which case repeat ERCP would be indicated to replace the stents.
On discharge, her LFTs were stable for 48 hours and abdominal exam remained benign.
Cytology brushings revealed adenocarcinoma cells, likely malignant.
Following immediate management, she was maintained in NSR with metoprolol and had no recurrence of the hypotension.
Her hematocrit was stable and there was no further sign of bleeding.
Diastolic heart failure:  The patient has a history of diastolic HF, but at home required no oxygen support.
Transitional Issues: - Please monitor liver function tests (AST, ALT, Alkaline phosphatase, Total bilirubin) daily until normalized.

Outpatient Lab Work Please obtain daily chemistry 7 panel along with daily AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin.
A CT scan showed dilated bile ducts, most likely due to an obstruction.
On [**10-1**] your blood pressure dropped to a dangerously low level, and you were transferred to our ICU.
You were given medications to control your heart rate, keep your blood pressure in the normal range, and reduce any extra fluid in your body.
You underwent a repeat ERCP on [**10-10**] to replace this stent.
You will have daily bloodwork at rehab for liver function tests to ensure that everything is stable.
