The patient's blood pressures and urine output were adequate and the dopamine and levophed were titrated off.
However, because of goals of care (family did not want major surgery and interventions), no cardiac catheterization was undertaken.
Pt has tachy, HTN and incr RR and lower sats in the 80s when these occurred.
His Cr improved around discharge.
