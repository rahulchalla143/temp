In the ED, she was HD stable with O2 Sats 100% RA.
At that time, MRI abdomen was notable for an irregular duct but no stricture at the pancreaticojejunostomy site.
By [**5-25**], her CA [**47**]-9 has risen from 13 to 143 as well as her CEA was elevated at 4.6.
She underwent an EGD and EUS which showed a 3 cm hypoechoic mass in the body of the pancreas in [**10-25**].
Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 132/79 , pulse 76 , temperature 96.6, O2 sat 100 RA, respirations 12.
JVP - flat.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation  bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: CXR - The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits, and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or other evidence of CHF.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2136-3-20**]: 1.
CXR [**2136-3-28**]: There has been further improved aeration in the left lower lobe since the recent chest radiograph of [**2136-3-26**] and more marked improvement when compared to the earlier radiograph of [**3-21**].
[**2136-3-29**] CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS: 1.
Ultrasound of the lower extremities was performed and negative for DVT.
CT of her abdomen and pelvis revealed IVC compression by obstructed afferent loop due to necrotic adenocarcinoma in tail of the pancreas.
EGD was performed but not amenable to stent across obstruction.
1) Hyponatremia:  Serum sodium nadired at 126 in the post-operative course.
On day of discharge, her sodium serum was stable at 131. .
3) Thrombocytopenia - Patient's platelets trended down from >500 on admission to 114.
A second test was pending at the time of discharge, and Lovenox was resumed.
Prior to her surgical intervention, she was found unresponsive with a blood glucose of 11; it is unknown how long she had been hypoglycemic.
Following transfer back to the Oncology service, her blood glucoses were persistently between 300-500, and she was restarted on a Humalog sliding scale.
