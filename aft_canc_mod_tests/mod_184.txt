His hematocrit was found to be 25 (down from 34) one month ago.
The patient had a nasogastric lavage which was positive for coffee ground material which did not clear with two liters.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed his temperature maximum was 99.5, his blood pressure was 100/49, his heart rate was 74, and his oxygen saturation was 96% to 99% on room air.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Neurologic examination was grossly nonfocal.
His INR was 2.5 on admission.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy done showed reflux from the duodenum/tumor area, but the scope could not be passed into the duodenum secondary to tumor.
A nasogastric lavage was repeated which showed coffee-grounds followed by fresh clots of red blood.
An angioembolization was done to the gastroduodenal artery on [**7-25**].
On [**7-26**], the patient's hematocrit was still slowly dropping.
The patient was sent for a repeat embolization on [**7-28**].
On [**7-31**], the patient had an ultrasound which showed a pseudoaneurysm still present in the left femoral area with flow through it.
His hematocrit was stable at that time.
On [**8-1**], the day following the patient being transferred to the floor, his hematocrit was dropping slowly to 28 with an expanding left femoral hematoma.
The patient's hematocrit was stable for the next three days at approximately 32.
His INR was corrected to 1.3.
A repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done on [**8-5**] which was negative.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable at approximately 30 until discharge.
The patient's blood pressure remained stable throughout his hospitalization.
COAGULOPATHY ISSUES:  The patient was initially admitted on Coumadin with an INR of 2.5 following reversal of anticoagulation with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K  while the patient was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Once the patient was transferred to the floor, his INR continued to increase to a maximum level of 2.9.
The patient again received 2 more units of fresh frozen plasma and 1 mg of intravenous vitamin K while on the floor and then placed on oral vitamin K to maintain his INR at less than 1.5.
The patient was discharged with an INR of 1.3 which remained stable following the initial reversal with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K.  5.
The patient had bilateral ultrasounds initially done showing no pseudoaneurysm on the right, just a hematoma, and a pseudoaneurysm on the left.
The patient had a thrombin injection performed and a repeat ultrasound which showed the pseudoaneurysm was still present that then began to expand with an expanding hematoma and a drop in his hematocrit.
