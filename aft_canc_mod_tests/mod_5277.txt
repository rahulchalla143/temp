Admission Date:  [**2158-9-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-9-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-1-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: Speech difficulty and seizure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Stereotactic brain biopsy   History of Present Illness: 73F with h/o breast CA who presented to OSH on [**2158-9-8**] with sudden onset of difficulty speaking.
Head CT there showed some effacement of left temporal and parietal lobes, suggestive of MCA occlusion per OSH radiology read.
OSH CT was reviewed with [**Hospital1 18**] radiology, and there was concern that the findings could in fact be a left post-parietal area mass lesion, as opposed to early infarct.
MRI was obtained here, which showed several enhancing masses of L parietal lobe (mets vs. primary glial tumor) and T2 hyperintensity of medial L temporal lobe (caused by seizure vs. involvement of glial tumor).
Consulted now for evaluation of brain masses.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **] was admitted to neurology ICU on [**2158-9-8**] for workup of speech difficulty and new onset seizure.
Her brain MRI +/- gado showed left parietal and temporal lesion and she was transferred to neurosurgery service and out of ICU to stepdown on HOD#2.
Neuro exam on [**2158-9-19**] without any deficits.
