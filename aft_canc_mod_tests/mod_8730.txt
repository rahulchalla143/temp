WBC was elevated at 22.7 and respiratory distress.
CXR showed increased pulmonary edema.
On [**6-13**], a TEE was done noting the following: The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Lasix was stopped as urine output dropped.
He appeared too dried out and IV fluid was given with improved urine output.
Creatinine slowly trended back down to baseline.
Repeat CXRs demonstrated improved effusions and elevated right hemidiaphragm.
O2 was removed with room air sats of 96%.
WBC was 7.6.
Urine culture was negative.
An abdominal CT scan was performed on [**6-24**] noting small-to-moderate ascites with no evidence for loculated intra-abdominal fluid collection to suggest abscess formation.
WBC increased to 20.2 on [**6-25**], but decreased to 14 on [**6-26**].
