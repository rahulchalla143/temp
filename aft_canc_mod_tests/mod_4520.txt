Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-8-1**], the left ventricular systolc function is now less vigorous (low normal) but without regional dysfunction.
Compared to the previous tracing ST-T wave changes are less prominent and the Q-T interval is shorter.
[**10-26**] RUQ U/S: The liver demonstrates no definite focal or textural abnormality.
[**10-27**] CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis- 1.
Small amount of new, intermediate density peritoneal and pelvic fluid, but no evidence of organized chest, abdominal or pelvic fluid collections to suggest abscess.
[**10-27**] CT Head- There is no evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage, large mass, mass effect, edema, or hydrocephalus.
[**10-30**] MRI R Shoulder- 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF >55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-10-25**], heart rate is slower.

OSH blood cultures were then found to be positive for S.aureus (within 12 hours) ([**2-26**]) and he received a dose of linezolid in addition to vancomycin.
He then was febrile to 102 and was found to be hypotensive to SBP 70s that was unresponsive to 1L IVF.
He was started on peripheral levophed and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
Joint space aspiration revealed 2500 leukocytes concerning for a septic joint.
His blood cultures from OSH grew out [**2-26**] MSSA.
TTE was negative for valvular vegetations.
A thoracic CT scan as well as head CT were performed to look for an indolent infection/abscess/phlegmon.
He underwent repeat chest CT when an CXR showed possible progression of the earlier opacities/nodules and this showed new predominantly peripheral nodules, a couple with cavitation, as well as increasing mixed consolidative and ground-glass opacity in the lingula concerning for septic emboli.
Patient underwent a repeat TTE to assess for valvular disease which was negative.
To Follow Up- - Patient will need repeat chest CT in [**12-28**] months to assess progression of nodules and ground glass opacities - urine histoplasma and galactomannan pending on discharge .
They tapped the shoulder- joint fluid showed 2500 leukocytes- elevated in the setting of leucopenia concerning for septic arthritis.
He underwent MRI of the shoulder which showed joint effusion, extensive subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis, extensive myositis of the shoulder girdle and a full thickness rotator cuff tear.
The patient's heart rate was better controlled for the remainder of his hospitalization and he was discharged on this medication.
RUQ US did not show any cholangitic or hepatic process/obstruction.
The source of your infection was believed to be your shoulder- an MRI showed inflammation and tear of the muscles as well as fluid in the joints.
We made the following changes to your medications: - START taking nafcillin for your infection - START taking metoprolol for your heart rate and blood pressure - START taking fluconazole to prevent fungal infection - CHANGE your dose of acyclovir to 400 mg every eight hours - STOP taking amlodipine for your blood pressure  Followup Instructions: Please follow up at the appointments below:  Department: INFECTIOUS DISEASE When: MONDAY [**2158-11-27**] at 9:50 AM With: [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**] Building: LM [**Hospital Unit Name **] [**Hospital 1422**] Campus: WEST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name **] Garage  Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: MONDAY [**2158-11-27**] at 2:00 PM With: [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**] Building: [**Hospital6 29**] [**Location (un) **] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: MONDAY [**2158-11-27**] at 2:00 PM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 12633**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 24**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage                                [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] MD [**MD Number(2) 3922**]  Completed by:[**2158-11-10**
