CT-guided biopsy consistent with renal cell carcinoma.
[**2158-2-7**]: MRI L-spine with T11 disease with persistent mass effect on thecal sac but no significant cord compression, and T9 and T10 disease, all likely unchanged.

# pneumothorax: Pt with evidence of pneumothorax on chest CT, thought to be secondary to possible communication between surgical site and pleural fluid.
Chest tube placed to water seal the following day althouhg evidence on cxr of enlarging pneumothorax was noted.
Tissue cultures grew sparse growth of MRSA and rare growth of acinetobacter, but given that her goals of care were to go home on hospice and she did not appear to be clinically infected, we decided not to treat with long-term antibiotics.
# metastatic RCC: Originally diagnosed in [**2142**] with lung mets in [**2156**] and bony mets [**2157**] complicated by spinal cord compression requiring stablization.
On discharge, her oral regimen of dilaudid and oxycontin was continued.
