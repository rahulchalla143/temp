Admision CXR showeed L white out and mediastinal/tracheal shift.
Pt needed CT scan, but unable to lie flat, so she was intubated.
Post intubation pt had immediate blood pressure drop responsive to fluids (2 liters), then continuing to have intermittent hypotension requiring bolusing despite minimum sedation and required norepinephrine x2days intermittently.
Pt also transfused 4U PRBCs for hct of 25 with inapropriate rise to 30 although blood loss was thought to be lost in serosanguinous CT drainage and Hct stable for last 24h.
Admission CT also showed small subsegmental RLL PE but anticoagulation held due to brain mets.
CT also showed enormous Left sided effusion with two fluid levels suggestive of hemothorax, mass effect w/ shift of mediastinum to Right.
In face of tenuous BP + possible hemothorax, CT [**Doctor First Name **] placed Left Chest Tube for volume drainage (2100cc removed).

[**12-13**]  Chest CT 1) Interval placement of left-sided chest tube with decrease in large left- sided pleural effusion with shift of the mediastinum back to the left.
CT placed in the ED as per HPI and pt intubated due to inability to lay flat for CT to evaluate effusion but was quickly weaned.
Pt has history of thrombocytopenia, and platelet count was slowly declining.
Pt had corasyn stim test to rule out adrenal insuffuciency which was equivocal at 18, so she was started on stress dose steroids.
PE-Pt with known subsegmental PE on admission CT. Pt with appropriate sats on room air.
Will restart chemo if Plat ct >100 per attg likely Iressa.
Chest CT shows no interval change in size of pulmonary nodules post chemo.
