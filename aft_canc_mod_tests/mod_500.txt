Admission Date:  [**2194-8-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-9-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2138-2-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Demerol / Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15519**] Chief Complaint: Labile blood pressure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Arterial line placement [**8-29**]   History of Present Illness: 56F with h/o Stage IV Ovarian CA , recurrent DVTs, morbid obesity and HTN who was sent to the ED from Oncologist's office with Creatinine of 3.2 after five days out from an Abd CT with IV contrast on [**2194-8-25**] to evaluate for peritoneal mets.
She was also taking increasing doses of MSContin for pain as her kidney fxn was declining.
Cardiology was called for Echo which revealed no evidence of tamponade, with nml EF.
A left radial A line was placed, she had persistent hypotension, with her blood pressure supported with pressors and IVF in the MICU.
Her Creatinine continued to improve, and at the time of her transfer to the floor, her Cr was 1.2, down from 6.6 on [**8-30**].
A LE doppler on [**8-29**] demonstrated no DVTs.
Exam limited by body habitus.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections are again demonstrated and not significantly changed in size or distribution compared to the prior study.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The bladder, distal ureters, rectum, and sigmoid colon are unremarkable.
CXR [**2194-9-3**]:  IMPRESSION: Resolving left lower lobe opacity which may relate to resolving atelectasis or improving pneumonia.
ECHO [**2194-8-30**]: Conclusions: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Her Creatinine responded appropriately, and her renal function demonstrated a downward trend in creatinine.
Her echo on admission demonstrated EF=60%, but suboptimal [**3-19**] anterior fat pad, so  tamponade could not initially be ruled out.
Her Head CT was wnl; and the pt was refusing MRI (to look for carcinomatous meningitis).
She can follow up as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15520**] regarding MRI for staging workup of the brain.
Furthermore, her sputum cx came back positive for MRSA.
We followed serial HCTs, without need for transfusion.
Initial Head CT negative.
Pt does not want further imaging studies despite our explaining our concern for increased intracranial pressure or carcinomatous meningitis.
