During a prior admission [**1-25**], she had a CT scan suggestive of fungal pneumonia with positive beta glucan and had BAL [**2130-1-26**] which grew Moraxella, MSSA, and Enterobacter treated with 21 day course of levofloxacin and started on voriconazole which was continued until this admission.
In clinic initially, oxygen saturation was 91% on room air and she complained of worsening cough productive of clear sputum and associated rhinorrhea and nasal congestion.
On the floor, patient underwent BAL [**2130-2-24**] which is negative thus far except for positive RSV.
Repeat chest CT [**2130-2-27**] revealed progression of bronchogenic infiltrates compared with [**2130-2-22**].
Dermatology was also consulted for evaluation of rash.
This am, patient had initially been satting high 90s on 2L but then progressively required more oxygen throughout the day (93-94% on 7 L face mask with ABG prior to transfer 7.54/35/72 with lactate 1.4).
Past Medical History: CLL Dx [**6-/2126**] w stage IV disease with cytogenetics notable for p53 mutation: - c/b autoimmune hemolytic anemia on presentation - 2 cycles of CVP starting in [**7-/2126**] - Rituxan added in [**8-/2126**] - [**11/2126**] started 13 wks Campath - [**9-/2127**] in setting of rising WBC, additional 2 cycles of CVP - [**10/2127**] d/t poor response to CVP, received fludarabine, Cytoxan, and Rituxan (had 3 cycles of this) - [**1-/2128**] had mini-MUD allo SCT - [**11/2128**] persistent disease by her [**Year (4 digits) 500**] marrow, marked lymphadenopathy and an elevated LDH: [**Year (4 digits) **] marrow biopsy showed approximately 80% of the marrow involved with her CLL/SLL.

She continued to worsen on the BMT service with progressive hypoxia and was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
Her severe thrombocytopenia persisted, and she developed oliguric renal failure secondary to shock and began to develop severe multiorgan system failure.
