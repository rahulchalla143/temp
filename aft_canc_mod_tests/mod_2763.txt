Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care on [**1-16**].
CT head showed possible L-pons lesion and MRI/A ([**1-17**]) showed watershed ischemia in R hemisphere.
INR also elevated at 11->8.
SBP initially 115s but became hypotensive to 80s/50s & transferred to ICU for closer monitoring & pressure support.

Neck: supple without Carotid bruits CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally + ASTERIXIS.

If clinically indicated, further evaluation with MRI could be performed.
The left kidney measures 10 cm and also does not contain hydronephrosis.
TORSO CT: CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The soft tissue window images reveal no significant axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
The lung window images reveal bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The study is limited due to the lack of IV contrast.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A large amount of free fluid is present.
IMPRESSION: Limited study due to lack of IV contrast.
Further evaluation is recommended.
Ascites tapped [**2197-1-14**], c/w transudate: 290 WBC, 21% P, Cx neg on levo.
Repeat urine lytes w/<10 Na.
Urine output was not improving after 3.8 liter tap on [**1-20**].
A CT scan of the thorax was done on [**2197-1-20**] w/o contrast which showed [**3-17**] small pulm nodules; moderate R pleural eff; cirrhotic liver; large ascites; pancreas & bowel unremarkable.
A repeat [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**1-20**] showed 750 wbc, 64% polys; gram stain neg.
Elev lactate 11.2->8->9 could be due to sepsis, hypoperfusion, or decreased breakdown due to cirrhosis.
Carotid dopplers ([**1-18**]) notable for 60-69%R ICA occlusion and L-vertebral not visualized (so could be occulded or hypoplastic)  6) Coagulopathy: Likely from cirrhosis.
7) Hyponatremia: likely related to fluid status -holding diuretics, free water restrict 8) CV: increased ectopy on tele [**1-18**]; An episode of PAF starting on [**1-21**] with HR up to 130-140s.
Pt INR already elevated and beta-blockers contraindicated due to hypotension.
