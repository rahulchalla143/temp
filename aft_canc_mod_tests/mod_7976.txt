A CT of chest without contrast was negative.
He had positive Troponin rise, negative CK, and possible new EKG changes with ST depressions.

If high clinical suspicious of pulmonary embolism, a repeat study is recommended.
Limited evaluation of lung parenchyma due to respiratory motion does not reveal lung nodules or consolidation.
Limited evaluation of the abdominal organs is unremarkable.
If high clinical suspicious of pulmonary embolism, a repeat study is recommended.
REPEAT CHEST CT [**2170-9-17**] FINDINGS: Equivocal subsegmental filling defects in pulmonary artery branches of left lower lobe that could represent flow artifact in this study with respiratory motion.
If high clinical suspicious of pulmonary embolism, a repeat study is recommended.
Limited evaluation of lung parenchyma due to respiratory motion does not reveal lung nodules or consolidation.
Limited evaluation of the abdominal organs is unremarkable.
If high clinical suspicious of pulmonary embolism, a repeat study is recommended.
Neuroimaging: CT [**2170-9-11**] Hyperdensity of the right caudate head and putamen, presumably reflecting hemorrhagic infarction, enhancement of infarcted tissue, or both.
Brain MRI/MRA ([**2170-9-12**]) 1.
He was seen by Cardiology, and CEs showed CK 123->116->94, CK-MB 1.5->1.8->1.2, TropT 0.02->0.04->0.03.
He returned to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] where CEs showed CK 164, CK-MB 5.1, and TropT 0.1, and EKG per report showed old q in inferior leads, some 1mm elevations, lateral ST depressions.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
He had a cardiac cathterization [**2170-9-10**] which showed known occlusions of SVG-OM1, SVG-OM3, SVG-PDA, LIMA-D1; and Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal SVG-LAD graft with a Cypher DES.
During the cath, he received Bivalirudin bolus and gtt, Fentanyl 200 mcg IV x1, Nicardipine 200 mcg IC bolus, Versed 1 mg IV x1, and Sodium Bicarbonate IV.
Head CTA and CTP showed complete occlusion of the cervical and intracranial right ICA and of the right MCA, the right ACA is patent, likely supplied by the anterior communicating artery, subtle loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation and a large area of matched decreased cerebral blood volume and flow in the right middle cerebral artery territory, consistent with a large acute infarction, no evidence of hemorrhage.
MRI/MRA head showed a large acute infarction with extensive hemorrhagic transformation in the right MCA territory, small acute infarction in the right ACA territory, and successful revascularization of the right ICA and MCA.
Repeat Head CTs showed increased mass effect and right uncal herniation, and he was started on Mannitol.
EEG [**2170-9-26**] showed asymmetry with low voltage activity over the right side, and overall diffuse encephalopathy.
At times during his stay, he complained of chest pain, but cardiac enzymes were always unremarkable and EKG was unchanged.
As this was concerning for pulmonary embolism, he underwent two consecutive chest CTA; both revealed a small lesion in the lower segment of the left inferior lobe.
Goal INR is [**1-28**].
He was noted to have a recent Lyme titer positive at his PCP's office and was treated with Doxycycline 100 mg PO bid to complete a 14 day course; discontinued on [**2170-9-19**].
He passed his swallow study but he was waxing and wanning in his mental status and not holding well the PO intake.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Two (2)  PO BID (2 times a day).
Your cardiac enzymes also started to decrease.
