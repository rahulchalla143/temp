His workup started on [**6-10**], after his PCP ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CXR for chronic cough, weight loss, chest burning and dyspnea.
The CXR showed left hilar mass and left upper lobe consolidations, and the patient was referred to the ED.
CT chest revealed a large spiculated left lung mass, bulky necrotic mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy, bilateral pulmonary nodules, pericardial effusion and pericardial mass.
He was subsequently admitted for one week, during which time he underwent pericardiocentesis for effusion with tamponade physiology, and bronchoscopy with biopsy revealing a mix of small cell and non-small cell lung carcinoma.
Pulsus was measured at 10, and bedside echo showed recurrent effusion.
Pericardial fluid grew gram positive cocci, and vancomycin was started.
Vancomycin was discontinued after his pericardial fluid grew out coagulase negative staph.
Labs this morning were notable for increase in creatinine from 0.9 to 1.3.
Urine lytes were consistent with perfusion-related kidney injury.
Prior to transfer from the CCU, vital signs were 97.9, 113, 94/76, 18, 95% 3L NC.
Family History: Noncontributory   Physical Exam: Admission PE: Vitals: T:96.8 BP:99/51 P:112 R:36 O2:96% 3LNC Pulsus: 4 General: Alert, no acute distress, sitting upright in bed, eating dinner HEENT: MMM, oropharynx clear, no conjunctival injection or icterus.

Successful pericardiocentesis with 400cc bloody fluid removed and sent for pathological analysis.
Drainage overnight with repeat echocardiogram tomorrow morning.
[**7-4**] CXR: In comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination of [**2176-6-17**], the patient is now intubated and has bilateral chest tubes as described without evidence of pneumothorax.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-7-19**], the pericardial effusion has increased in size.
[**8-5**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION: 1.
- continue to monitor Hct - transfuse Hct < 24 .
He had a pericardiocentesis which was successful, with drain placement.
# SVC syndrome: Chest imaging concerning for near-total attenuation of SVC by mass.
The patient had bilateral chest tubes placed, which were transition from suction to water seal on [**2176-7-6**].
Serial CXR were done for monitoring.
Cultures were sent, and no organisms were isolated.
The three chest tubes were then slowly able to be removed.
Most recent CT imaging on [**8-5**] demonstrated decrease in bilateral pleural effusions.
Recent repeat staging CT demonstrated potential response of lung lesion ([**2176-8-6**]).
He was set to be transferred back to the unit but was stabilized on the floor following a bedside echo so he stayed on the floor and was hemodynamically stable since that time.
