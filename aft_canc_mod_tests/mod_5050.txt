There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
EGD [**10-5**] No fresh or old blood was found.
Colonoscopy [**10-10**]: Diverticulosis of the whole colon Polyps in the distal transverse colon and rectum (polypectomy) Polyp in the proximal ascending colon Ulceration, erythema and granularity in the proximal ascending colon compatible with indetermined colitis (biopsy) Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum   Brief Hospital Course: 83yo deaf male with atrial fibrillation presenting with lower GIB in the setting of supratherapeutic INR on Coumadin, admitted to the ICU s/p 3 units of PRBCs with normal [**Hospital 63664**] transferred to floor with colonoscopy significant for diverticulosis, two colonic polyps, and non-specific colitis of proximal colon.
In the ED the patient received 2 units of PRBC's and 2 units of FFP for concern of GI bleed and anti-coagulation was reversed with vitamin K for supratherapeutic INR of 3.9.
Serial HCT were followed and continued to trend downward over the next 24 hours.
Colonoscopy was performed after patient was transferred to the floor, and showed extensive diverticulosis (no source of bleed), two small polyps, one in ascending colon and one in transverse colon (which were excised and specimen sent to pathology), localized inflammation in the proximal ascending colon, most suspicious for the source of pt's GIB (biopsy was sent to r/o lymphoma).
Pt had no further episodes of BRBPR and Hct was stable on the floor.
Repeat CXR showed worsening RLL airspace disease concerning for aspiration although time course of event remained unclear.
Cultures were negative and pt completed a 5 day course of Unasyn with low suspicion for pneumonia, more likely diagnosis aspiration pneumonitis.
CXR was also notable for pulmonary edema.
On [**10-5**] patient underwent TTE to evaluate cardiac function which showed no change from previous (normal LVEF > 55 % and mild 1+ MR).
# Heart Murmur: left parasternal systolic murmur evaluated with TTE which showed normal LVEF > 55 % and mild 1+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 63665**]s were trended and unremarkable.
You underwent an endoscopy which was normal, and a colonoscopy which showed inflammation of a part of your colon, two polyps in your colon, and diverticulosis.
Biopsies were sent of your colon and the polyps, and you will follow up the results of this with your gastroenterologist at your next appointment.
