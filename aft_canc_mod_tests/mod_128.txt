TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of abdomen and pelvis were obtained without administration of oral contrast.
Evaluation of the abdomen is extremely limited by lack of intravenous or oral contrast.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: Urinary bladder is collapsed around a Foley catheter.
A small locule of gas is seen on image 74 of series 2 in the anterior abdominal wall which may be related to medication injection.
BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate sclerosis and compression deformity of T8 vertebral body, incompletely evaluated.
Comparison is made to a non-contrast abdomen CT performed earlier today.
DUPLEX LIVER DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: There is a small right-sided pleural effusion.
Within the liver parenchyma, there are hyperechoic bands radiating in the periphery following portal vein branches that correspond to similar structures seen on the CT consistent with periductal fibrosis in this patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Patency of splenic vein, SMV, left portal vein with outflow via large umbilical vein, hepatic veins, and IVC.
TTE [**11-10**]  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
COMPARISONS: Chest radiograph dated [**2105-11-10**].
FINDINGS: A single AP portable supine radiograph reveals an endotracheal tube which terminates 6 cm above the carina.

Eventually the bleeding stopped and his hematocrit stabilized with medical measure including a Protonix drip and an octreotide drip.
