The patient had been lost to medical follow up for 40 years until he presented to [**Hospital3 **] previously with black stools, anemia to 20.4, early satiety and 20lb weight loss.
He was transfused 6 units PRBCs and his HCT remained stable in the mid 30s.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], where repeat EGD revealed a gastric mass that was positive for moderately differentiated gastric adenoma with lymphatic invasion.
CT torso revealed suspicious hilar lymph nodes and peritoneal carcinomatosis.
The patient had been doing well since discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] until he developed fatigue and SOB and presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2136-1-21**] with initial VS 66 152/60 RR 33 91% on NRB.
He underwent a CTA which revealed a massive saddle PE.
He also was noted to have a fib with RVR and hypotension to 80s systolic; was given adenosine without improvement.
He was then given IV dig and his pressures and rates improved and pt felt much better.
Because of his tenuous clinical status, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for evaluation for emergent embolectomy.
Past Medical History: 1) Lost to medical care for 40 years until [**12/2135**] when dx with gastric adenocarcinoma 2) Metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma diagnosed on EGD biopsy with likely diffuse pulmonary metastasis and peritoneal carcinomatosis.
3) Probable CAD with pMIBI from OSH showing inf lead Q waves and inferior wall motion abnormality and EF 35% 4) GERD 5) Possible h/o a fib, was told he had it 3 months prior to [**1-3**] admission 6) HTN 7) HLP  Social History: Semi-retired carpenter, lives alone.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2135-12-27**] the rate is faster and lateral ST-T wave changes are present.
DVT within the left popliteal vein.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-1-23**] inferior and anterolateral ST-T wave abnormalities persist.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo man recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after new dx of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma [**2135-12-31**] who was transferred from [**Hospital1 392**] ICU with saddle PEs and for evaluation for emergent embolectomy.
Patient was continued on heparin drip titrated to goal PTT of 60-80.
Patient underwent b/l LENIs which showed b/l thrombi, R>L (right distal superficial femoral vein, popliteal vein, and posterior tibial veins, left popliteal vein).
DIC labs were checked and were negative.
Patient underwent echocardiogram which showed severely dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle, as well as mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Hct were trended and remained stable, stools guaiac negative.
Hilar lymphadenopathy noted on CT. CT of the head did not demonstrate any metastases.
Digoxin level was checked and was within therapeutic levels.
Cardiac rhythm was monitored on telemetry and did not reveal any subsequent AF.
HCT trended and remained stable between 24-30.
His HCT at discharge was 30.8. .
#) HTN: Patient on metoprolol for rate control; patient's BP was stable prior to discharge in normotensive range.
LABS/STUDIES PENDING AT TIME OF DISCHARGE: None  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Patient was a full code during this admission.
-His brother [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3142**] is his HCP ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 90419**]) -Patient will need to have IVC filter removed.
You did not require surgery to remove the clot, as your heart rate and blood pressure stabilized with fluids and medications.
The blood clot in your lung caused you to develop a fast, abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, that was controlled with new medications.
Your blood counts were very low, and you a blood transfusion before you were discharged.
