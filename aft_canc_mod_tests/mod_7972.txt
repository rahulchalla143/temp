A CT could be obtained for further evaluation if clinically indicated.
- Abdominal ultrasound ([**2184-10-21**]):The portal veins and splenic vein are patent and demonstrate  reversed flow.
- CXR ([**2184-10-21**]):Stable lung opacities.
Abdominal ultrasound showed no flow in the portal system, which was a progression since [**2184-9-29**].
Blood and urine cultures were no growth to date.
The donor was a brain-dead, 66-year-old deceased donor who was hepatitis B surface antigen negative, hepatitis B core antibody positive, and hepatitis B NAT-positive.
The patient was almost 30 kg above his admission weight, urine output was initially low and his creatinine rose daily to a maximum of 4.1 on POD 6.
Over the rest of the hospitalization the urine output increased daily and his creatinine came down to 1.4.
He received several doses of Lasix, and his weight, maximum 110 kg was 98 kg on discharge and he was sent home on [**Hospital1 **] Lasix.
Duplex ultrasounds x 2 demonstrated normal hepatic flow in all vessels.
The lateral drain was scant and was pulled early in his course.
If you lose or gain more than 3 pounds in a day or feel very thirsty or notice your urine output dropping down, please call the transplant clinic as your lasix may need to be adjusted.
