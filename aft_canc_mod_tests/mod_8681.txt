MRI head (no contrast): Large frontal mass (4.5 x 7 cm), spanning L and R ant [**Last Name (un) **] spaces - consistent with  meningioma.
Out side MRI obtained by her neurologist showed bifrontal meningioma then referred to go to ED for neusurgical evaluation.The patient underwent a full work up including a CTA, MRV, and a 4 vessel angiogram which showed dense vascular supply to this lesion from both ethmoidal arteries, right sided anterior falcian artery arising from the ophthalmic artery, a supply from the R ECA and multiple sources of dural supply.
The patient underwent preoperative angiographic embolization and was taken electively to the operating room for bifrontal meningioma resection, pericranial allograft flap and duraplasty under general anesthesia without intraoperaive complications.
She was seen by cardiology for endocarditis in the past who recommened keeping HCT greater than 25.
Her hematocrit was was 25 on [**2-16**] and [**2-20**] for which she received 2 units of blood on those dates.
Her tegratol level was 5.1 and goal is 8.5 she received extra Tegratol on [**2-19**] she should have it rechecked in a week.
