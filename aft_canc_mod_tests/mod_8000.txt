Bronchoscopy with stent placement [**2144-9-14**].
Bronchoscopy with stent removal [**2144-9-15**].
Flexible bronchoscope showed patent distal airways.
Blood pressure 89/70.
Post-procedure CXR without pneumothorax.
Pt received IVF  without improvement in his blood pressures.
His blood pressures improved with attempted A-line, peripheral placements to peak SBP100.
While awaiting MICU bed, the patient had labs drawn (within normal limits, WBC 6.7 --> 10), blood cultures sent, received Vancomycin/Cefepime.
In discussions with IP, second CXR while in [**Name (NI) 13042**] suggestive of RML/RLL collapse after procedures with planned flex bronch by IP in the morning.
LMA removal/extubation occurred right away, but bipap was initially required upon transfer to ICU after this procedure.
Oxygen has been weaned down to nasal cannula, BP remained stable and t transferred to th eOncology floor on [**2144-9-17**].On th eoncology floor  pt reports he feels quite well, feels breathing significantly improved.
On MRI and MRA imaging studies NSMC:  An ill-defined mass in the right posterior orbit encasing the optic nerve extending into the right cavernous sinus with thrombosis of the RCA inside the cavernous sinus.
-- On [**2143-5-24**], given the concern for lymphoma, a CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed to assess for other lesions.
Otherwise, on imaging was found no evidence of lymphoma, a 6-mm bladder diverticulum.
-- On [**2143-6-12**], PET CT scan revealed 24 x 22 mm right retroorbital soft tissue mass which is FDG avid (SUV maximum 5) with FDG avid retrobulbar fat.
-- On [**2143-11-5**], PET CT noted a 2.2 cm right lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] nodule with a SUV maximum 8.24 with no FDG avid mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.
-- On [**2144-2-14**], he underwent a right lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] wedge resection, which revealed squamous cell carcinoma (2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm) grade 2 moderately differentiated T2a N0 Mx tumor which was invading the visceral pleura and had lymphovascular invasion.
Level 7 and 9 lymph nodes were negative for malignancy.
-- On [**2144-8-18**], CT of the chest revealed new right-sided effusions and new 3-mm nodules in the left upper and lower lobes, suspicious.
-- On [**2144-8-31**], PET CT revealed stable retroorbital soft tissue fullness.
A 3.4 cm right lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] FDG avid nodule (maximum SUV is 30), FDG avid lymph nodes in the right perihilar region measuring largest 2.5 x 1.4 x 5 cm maximum SUV 30 associated with marked narrowing of the bronchus intermedius, obstruction of the lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] bronchus with distal patency, and marked narrowing of the origin of the middle [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] bronchus.
There are two FDG avid rib metastases, anterior fourth rib (maximum SUV 37) and posterior eighth rib (maximum SUV 17) and a right sacral metastasis (maximum SUV 26).
Physical Exam: On transfer from MICU to oncology: T97.3, 130/56, HR 73, R20, 92% on 4L NC Alert, appropriate, breathing comfortably, no distress.
