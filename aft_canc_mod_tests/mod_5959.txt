Head MRI w/o & w/contrast: FINDINGS: Today's exam is correlated with head CT from [**2158-1-28**].
Repeat Head CT [**2158-2-2**]: Increasing edema since [**2158-1-28**].
Repeat Head CT [**2158-2-4**]: Overall no significant interval change in size of right large cerebral hemisphere intraparenchymal hemorrhage and associated mass effect since [**2158-2-2**].
EEG [**2158-2-7**]: ABNORMALITY #1: A [**3-16**] Hz slow and disorganized background rhythm was noted in the waking state, which increased by [**12-13**] Hz with external stimulation.
ABNORMALITY #2: The right hemisphere background activity was 1 Hz slower and of decreased amplitude compared to the left hemisphere activity.
Brief Hospital Course: 65yo man with metastatic cancer presenting as a transfer from an OSH with new left hemiparesis, decreased alertness, plts <100k, and a right frontal hemorrhage.
He had an MRI for further evaluation; it did not clearly demonstrate an underlying metastasis, though it did show a small lesion in the right centrum semiovale that might be a metastasis.
As his repeat head CT showed significant edema, the decadron was tapered only to 4mg q12hrs and he was discharged on this dose, to remain stable until his follow up appointment with neuro-oncology.

NSVT - improving with treatment of hypokalemia (see below) 4. hypokalemia - On transfer to the floor from the ICU, the patient was noted to have a drop in potassium over one day from 3.6 to 2.6.
The K improved and the daily KCl was gradually tapered.
As such, serum free light chain assay was sent and is pending at the time of discharge.
FEN - swallow evaluation was performed and he was able to tolerate pureed foods and thin liquids.
