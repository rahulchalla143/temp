A CXR at that time showed a RML pneumonia with a new ill-defined opacity noted overlying on of the mid-thoracic vertebral bodies.
A repeat CXR on [**11-30**] showed a persistent infiltrate/atelectasis in the RML; it also showed a mass-like enlarged right hilum and a new 8-mm nodular density projecting over the left lung apex.
The CT on [**12-7**] showed bulky mediastinal adenopathy with collapse of the right middle bronchus, occlusion of the right superior pulmonary vein, encasement/constriction of the right main pulmonary artery and inferior pulmonary veins, displacement/deformation of the left atrium, and narrowing/invasion of the superior vena cava.
Of note, a CXR on [**2167-9-15**] was normal.
In the ED, her vitals were T 96.9, HR 90, BP 150/90, RR 16, Sat 99% on room air.
Her exam was notable for wheezes in the right lung field.
Physical Exam: T 96.8  BP 156/100  HR 96  RR 20  Sat 96% on 2L Gen: mildly Cushingoid, pleasant, no acute distress HEENT: clear OP, no icterus, EOMI, PERRL Neck: no carotid bruits, no wheezing/stridor, no thyromegaly Chest: faint expiratory wheezing in right middle lung field Breasts: patient declined examination CV: regular rate/rhythm, normal S1S2, no murmurs, no S3 or S4 heard Abd: protuberant, soft, nontender, moderately distended, tympanic, ?dullness to percussion in R flank Back: no CVA tenderness Extr: no edema, 2+ PT pulses Neuro: A&O x3, CN 2-12 intact, [**6-17**] grip strength bilaterally, [**6-17**] arm and shoulder flexion/extension bilaterally, [**6-17**] hip/knee/ankle flexion/extension Skin: ?mild hyperpigmentation, no rashes/lesions  Pertinent Results: CT Chest ([**12-7**]): The hilar component of a 6 x 5cm, mass involving the right hilus and middle mediastinum, obstructs the right middle lobe bronchus, producing collapse of the RML, significantly narrows the upper lobe bronchus and protrudes into the bronchus intermedius, narrowing it as well.
Subcarinal adenopathy measures 3 x 4 cm.
CT head ([**12-8**]): No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
ECG ([**12-8**]): sinus rhythm at 101 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals, ST depression in II, V2-V5, no Q waves, no ST elevations   Brief Hospital Course: Pt's chest CT was concerning for malignancy.
Pt was seen by Interventional Pulm who placed a stent in her RML bronchus ~[**12-8**] and obtained a biopsy which revealed small cell carcrinoma.
Pt was transfused 2 Units of PRBC's on [**12-13**] with an increase in her HCT from 23 to 25 (HCT 40 on admission).
HCT was again 23.
Her HCT decreased from 30 to 20 over the next 24 hrs.
Of note on [**11-30**] she underwent an EGD notable for mild gastritis and a C-scope notable for several adenomatous polyps.
She had a RBC scan which was unremarkable on [**12-15**].
As such, lower GI source was suspected, given recent polypectomy on [**11-30**].
As such, GI deferred colonoscopy on [**12-18**].
Pt is also s/p recent negative tagged rbc scan on [**12-14**].
Hemolysis labs were obtained on [**12-18**] which was unremarkable.
Given pt was otherwise hemodynamically stable, decision was made to start neupogen on [**12-20**] and await WBC>=1.0 before proceeding with colonoscopy.
Pt was called out to floor on [**12-21**] as her hct had been stable for ~24-36hrs, to await colonoscopy.
Pt continued to require multiple transfusions to maintain HCT > 25, suggesting ongoing bleeding, thus she remained in the ICU and received an additional unit of PRBC on [**12-18**] and [**12-19**], in addition to 1 bag platelets.
CT abdomen on [**12-19**] was negative for RP bleed.
Given ongoing bleeding, and decsision to defer colonscopy, pt underwent nuclear scan on [**2169-12-22**] which showed ?focus of abnormal activity on RLQ.
pt was then discussed with IR, with plan for angiography +/- embolization if possible, however tagged rbc scan was negative.
On [**12-23**] decision was made to pursue colonoscopy given ongoing active bloody stools without obvious source of bleeding, which showed apparent several cm long region of infiltrating tumor ~60cm from anus, c/w  infiltrative folds, with a single very large ulcer was seen in the colon at the area of infiltrated-appearing folds at 60cm from the anus, suggestive of either metastatic disease vs primary colon cancer.
MRI Head negative for mets.
Given her neutropenia, cultures were obtained, and pt started on cefipime/vanco (day 1 [**12-21**]).
Per GI plan was to transfuse platelets to keep plt > 50 as this could be contributing to ongoing active bleeding.
Her potassium was aggresively repleted.
Her Na remained within normal limits once pt was encouraged to maintain PO hydration.
Good UOP after foley placement (pt was incontinent x 3 [**12-17**]), and creatinine remained at baseline throughout [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course.
no dullness to percussion on exam throughout [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course, and LFTs unremarkable.
As she was awaiting colonoscopy, plan is to advance diet to regulars until WBC > 0.5-1.0 before re-prepping.
