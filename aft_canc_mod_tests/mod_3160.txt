He had an abdominal CT, which revealed subcapsular liver hematoma and was guaiac positive.
Initially white blood cell count was 21.6, hematocrit was 29.7, INR 1.8, creatinine 1.7 with normal liver function tests.
The patient was intubated on [**2173-10-21**] and had a liver angiogram, because the CT with contrast revealed multiple liver masses and a cirrhotic liver with the largest mass bleeding.
A left subclavian was placed on [**10-21**] and then changed over a wire on [**10-24**].
The patient's hematocrit post procedure was noted to drop from 29.7 to 22.8.
He received a total of 10 units of packed red blood cells, 4 bags of platelets, 1 cryo, 17 units of fresh frozen platelets between [**10-20**] and [**10-21**].
The patient's blood cultures were positive for one out of four bottles of coag negative staph.
The patient began to spike on [**10-22**] to a max of 102.6.
He grew out gram negative rods consistent with E-coli in his sputum on [**10-22**] and was started on Zosyn and then was changed to Levo.
Repeat CT on [**10-27**] revealed no abscess, but revealed an interval increase in ascites and multiple liver masses.
The patient's antibiotics were then changed to Vancomycin and Zosyn based on MRSA positive sputum on [**8-16**] and [**10-27**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature max was 103.1.
Temperature current 100.8.
Pulse 77 current, range was 67 to 113.
Blood pressure 101 to 171/54 to 86, current was 119/60.
Respiratory rate 15 to 32.
Satting 100% on room air.
The patient was on SIMV vent, tidal volume 600, respiratory rate 14 to 24, FIO2 0.4, FIO2 pressures support 5 of PEEP.
CVP 11 to 19, current 11, PIP 26, plateau 24, ins and outs were 23, 20/11, 40.
2+ dorsalis pedis pulses and warm.
DATA:  Fibrinogen 378, INR 1.3, PT 14, PTT 28.4, white blood cell count 14.4, hematocrit 33.2, platelet count 218, neutrophils 86 bands, 7 lymphocytes, 3 monocytes.
Urinalysis large blood, 30 protein, urobilinogen 1, 11 to 20 red blood cells, 3 to 5 white blood cells, 0 to 2 epithelials, moderate bacteria, negative glucose, negative nitrite, negative leukocyte esterase, negative ketone, negative bilirubin.
Sodium 148, K 4.3, chloride 112, bicarbonate 30, BUN 44, creatinine 0.9, glucose 219, phos 1.3, magnesium 2.4, ALT 100, AST 109, alkaline phosphatase 123, amylase 14, T bili 4.1, lipase 30, LDH 641, AFP 3, 59.5.
Blood cultures pending.
Paracentesis was performed and was consistent with a transudate.
However, a bladder pressure was obtained, which ruled out compartment syndrome.
The differential diagnoses include MRSA, pneumonia, E-coli, necrotizing hepatic masses, ischemic bowel, SBP, diarrhea, endocarditis, deep venous thrombosis, PE, drug fever given that the patient was on Zosyn and has a Penicillin allergy, Atelectasis, endocarditis, DVT and PE were all ruled out.
SBP was ruled out based on peritoneal fluid analysis and the patient's fever curb trended down.
Pan cultures were obtained, however, and remained negative except for those mentioned above.
Acute renal failure:  The patient had acute on chronic worsening of his renal failure, but with hydration his creatinine normalized to the baseline of 1.3.
