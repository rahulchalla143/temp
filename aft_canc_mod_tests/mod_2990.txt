Patient had shaking chills while on the floor and his temp rose to 102.5.

CT HEAD [**2121-9-29**]: No mass or hemorrhage; stable L. occiptal bright area c/w calcification.
MPRESSION: No significant change from the prior examination with stable lesions as described above.
Echo [**10-3**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
IMPRESSION: No significant change from the prior examination with stable lesions as described above, likely representing old infarct with hemorrhage .
[**10-21**]: CT chest IMPRESSION: 1.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was treated  empirically for csf infection (ampicillin, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ayclovir), given IVF and stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 100mg iv q8h).
Once his blood pressure stabilized he was sent to the floor.
His LP in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] revealed WBC 33 w/L45% and negative for organisms.
His MRI showed lesions in the frontal and occipital lobes that had been present on previous scans, and looked improved.
His second lumbar puncture was significant for leukocytosis and lymphocytosis making viral meningitis likely (WBC: 150 rbc: 0  poly: 4, lymphs:80, monos: 16 and wbc: 170, rbc: 10, poly: 6, lymphs:86 and monos: 8).
Based on this while cx were pending he continued treatment for meningitis.
His work-up (CMV viral load negative, Urine legionella negative, Blood culture negative, Stool culture, Lyme Ab negative, Cryptococcal Ag neg, CMV viral load neg, Toxoplasma IgG neg, Toxoplasma IgM pos and CSF cytology neg for malignant cells) remained negative, and while he was on the acyclovir, ceftriaxone, vancomycin and ampicillin for meningitis, he was also started on clindamycin, leucovorin and pyrimethamine for possible toxoplasma reactivation (given his past history of infection and neurologic symptoms).
His HSV pcr was negative so his acyclovir was stopped.
Eventually, urine was positive for enterovirus which is a unifying diagnosis for meningitis and myocarditis.
When his enterovirus csf Pcr was positive, toxoplasma was unlikely so his treatment for this was stopped and he had a repeat MRI to rule out edema or worsening.
Dizziness/Nausea: MRI showed no masses that would be causing dizziness, and this was thought to be [**12-26**] post-meningeal infection.
The best regimen for him which relieved his dizziness was meclizine 50mg [**Hospital1 **] and ativan 0.5mg tid.
CT scan of chest was performed given concern for increased crackles on exam.
His cardiac MR was negative, and once he was found to have enterovirus this was considered the likely cause for myocarditis.
He had no significant telemetry events, and his troponin level was normal on this admission (elevated on past admission).
Dolasetron 12.5 mg/0.625 mL Cartridge Sig: One (1) Intravenous  every eight (8) hours as needed for nausea.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Enteroviral ([**Location (un) **] B) meningoencephalitis RUE cephalic vein clot Hypotension Pericarditis/myocarditis .
