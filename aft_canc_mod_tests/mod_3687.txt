HPI: Screening chest CT [**2165-8-2**] revealing a large pericardial effusion measuring 3.4cm in thickness which was new compared to CT scan [**2165-6-14**].
No evidence of clinical tamponade: pulsus 8-10 mm hg, no elevation in JVP, normotensive.
Echo yesterday confirmed large effusion, 1.5-2cm circumferential; + respiratory variation in inflow, brief RA invagination, no RV collapse.
Pericardiocentesis was performed and 320-350 cc of thin red fluid was withdrawn.
No hemodynamic evidence of cardiac tamponade was observed CO6.69, CI 3.61, PCWmean 4, RAmean 6, PA 13/10 mean 12, RV 30/5, SVC 71%, Ao 98%.
Post-pericardiocentesis ECHO showed resolution of effusion.
Smoked 5 ppd until age 29.

Volumes:    The TLC is mildly reduced while the FRC, RV and RV/TLC ratio are             within normal limits.
(Right lung and pleura, pneumonectomy and pleural resection) (B-AC): 1)  Diffuse malignant mesothelioma, epithelioid type (papillary pattern).
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
No color doppler performed across the aortic valve to assess for the presence of MR. 6.There is a moderate to large sized circumferential pericardial effusion.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade [**2165-8-8**] CXR: Patient s/p right pneumonectomy with large amount of fluid occupying the right hemithorax.

A pericardiocentesis was performed and over 400 cc of fluid was drained.
A repeat echo showed minimal pericardial effusion and drain was pulled after being in place for 24 hours.
His pericardial fluid was negative for malignant cells but did contain numerous lymphocytes, red blood cells, macrophages and rare reactive mesothelial cells.
MESOTHELIOMA: --The patient was maintained on folic acid during his admission and his complete blood count remained stable throughout the admission.
