MRI Head [**2189-2-18**] IMPRESSION: Subtle areas of FLAIR and T2 hyperintensity in the left frontal and parietal and occipital lobes bilaterally.
The findings are less prominent than on the previous study and could represent resolving posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**2189-2-18**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Interval progression of disease as demonstrated by the development of innumerable new pulmonary nodules in comparison to the torso CT of [**2188-12-1**].
Ground-glass nodular opacities at the lung bases, which could reflect atelectasis and underlying nodules, although lymphangiectatic tumor spread is not entirely excluded.
The patient's ACEI was held given planned contrast study and in this setting had elevated SBP up to 186 w/ question of mental status changes.
EKG was unremarkable.
Neurological exam remained stable throughout admission.
MRI [**2-18**] showed possible resolving posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy with no acute infarct seen on imaging.
CT Torso [**2-18**] shows interval progression of disease.
On admission he had a K of 7, which trended down to 5.3 with lasix, kayexalate, and sodium bicarbonate.
EKG was unremarkable, as above.
The patient had a urine Anion Gap +18 consistent with RTA, but urinary ph 5.5.
Creatinine remained stable throughout admission with no acute issues.
# Anemia: The patient has a history of normocytic, normochronic anemia with BL HCT in mid-20s.
