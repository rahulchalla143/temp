RADIOLOGY: [**2181-6-7**] CHEST PORT: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-24**], there are substantially lower lung volumes with atelectatic changes at the left base.
Abdominal distention was also noted and an NG tube was placed, with significant bilous return (approximately 2L).
A CT scan was performed on [**6-13**] (POD6) to evaluate for bowel obstruction which showed "minimal dilation of proximal loops of small bowel with transition point not clearly identified, questionable small bowel obstruction.
A KUB was done done on [**6-18**] (POD11) to assess for obstruction:"persistent dilation of the small bowel, most likely representing ileus".
The JP drain fluid was sent for gram stain and cultures which showed 4+ GNR, heavy growth, and 1+ GPC, moderate growth and sparse growth of probable enterococcus.
On POD12 a CT scan of the abdomen with PO and IV contrast was ordered for persistent failure to thrive and ileus on KUB with high JP amylase levels (2400): "thickening of a loop of small bowel just posterior to the [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain and adjacent to the anastomotic site with the pancreas is minimally increased since [**2181-6-13**] and may represent postoperative changes".
