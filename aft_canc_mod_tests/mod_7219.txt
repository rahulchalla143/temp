He has no documented coronary artery disease but had an exercise treadmill test with nuclear imaging in [**2140-1-7**] with moderate reversible inferior perfusion defect.
His last echocardiogram was also in [**2140-10-6**] with left atrial enlargement, normal ejection fraction, minimal aortic stenosis, one plus mitral regurgitation, one plus tricuspid regurgitation.
In the Emergency Room, he had a blood pressure of 75/46 and an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air on arrival.
His rectal examination showed a small amount of red blood.
A nasogastric lavage showed bilious fluid.
Initial hematocrit was 17 with a potassium of 1.7.
His CT scan showed a pancreatic mass.
A biopsy showed adenocarcinoma.
He had metastatic lesions to the liver with near complete portal vein obstruction, mild ductal dilatation of the common bile duct and intrahepatic duct, ascites on a CT scan from [**2142-4-5**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 98.6 F.; heart rate 84 laying down and 109 sitting up; blood pressure 102/49 laying down, 98/46 sitting up; respiratory rate 24; 97% on three liters.
Neck with jugular venous pressure of about 8 to 9 centimeters.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count of 8.0, hematocrit of 17.2, platelets of 181.
Sodium of 143, potassium 1.7, chloride of 122, bicarbonate of 15, BUN of 13, creatinine 0.3, glucose of 54.
INR of 1.9, PT of 17.
Calcium of 3.6, magnesium of 0.8, ALT of 60, AST of 41, alkaline phosphatase 264.
Total bilirubin of 2.5.
Chest x-ray showed bibasilar atelectasis, no pneumonia.
An EKG showed atrial flutter with a rate in the 100s.
He had a chest CT scan with angiography done which showed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli and possible pulmonary metastatic disease.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 59 year old male with a recently diagnosed pancreatic cancer who presents with shortness of breath found to have pulmonary emboli on chest CT scan, also with concurrent bright red blood per rectum.
The patient was also seen to have a question of a pneumonia based on a follow-up chest x-ray.
At the time of his discharge, his room air oxygen saturation was 95% sitting, although 87% ambulatory.
The patient underwent a colonoscopy by the Gastrointestinal Service, who did not find any lesions.
He was transfused appropriately and his hematocrit stabilized.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had a history of presumed coronary artery disease as he had had a prior positive stress test in the past and has been placed on Imdur to prevent any symptoms of chest pain.
The patient's blood pressure was not elevated while he was hospitalized, thus, his usual home Accupril was held.
It was thought that he would follow-up with his primary care physician when he would have his blood pressure rechecked and it would be determined whether he would need his Accupril or not.
The patient should follow-up with his primary care physician regarding his Accupril as his blood pressure was not elevated in the hospital.
Of note, his long-acting Cardizem was changed to a four times a day Diltiazem as his blood pressure had been on the low side and we felt that the patient should not be taking a sustained release tablet if he was feeling lightheaded; this can be also followed up by his primary care physician.
He needs his INR drawn by Visiting Nurses Association services and fax the results to Dr.[**Name (NI) 8949**] office.
He should have his INR checked on Tuesday, [**5-22**], and Saturday [**5-26**].
