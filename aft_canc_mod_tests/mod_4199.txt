Pineal mass, unchanged  [**1-20**] - [**1-22**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG due to the presence of a slow background which reached a maximum of a 6 Hz frequency.
He had an initial metabolic and infectious work-up that was negative including normal chem 7, CBC, LFT's, lactate, ammonia and urinalysis.
CT head completed at an outside hospital was reviewed with a local radiologist (images are in the [**Hospital1 18**] PACS system) and was felt to show unchanged chronic mild hydrocephalus with unchanged VP shunt position and no appreciable change in the pineal mass.
CSF cell counts were within normal limits and CSF cultures are thus far without growth.
Therefore an extended work-up was pursued.
EEG revealed generalized slowing consistent with encephalopathy.
His outpatient neuro-oncologist and neurology consult service evaluated the patient.
CSF was sent for cytology.
On 1.27 he underwent his shunt revision which was uncomplicated.
He was planned to have a PEG placed and free water was started through his NG tube for a serum sodium of 156.
His serum sodium decreased to 146 and free water boluses were discontinued.
The ventricles were persistently large on the MRI but stable.
On [**1-24**] he was officially transferred to the stepdown unit for further care.
Blood and urine cultures were obtained, which were pending at the time of discharge.
His UA dipstick was negative, and his CXR did not demonstrate any acute CP process.
