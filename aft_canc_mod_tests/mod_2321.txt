In the operating room her blood pressure was low and she was admitted to the ICU post-op.
Post-op EKG was normal.
By post-operative day 2 her blood pressure was stabilized but she experienced several oxygen desaturations leading to increased oxygen requirement.
She was started on albuterol and atrovent nebulizers, pulmonary toilet, advair and her CXR suggested volume overload.
A urine culture drawn in the ICU grew E.coli and she was treated on ciprofloxacin.
At discharge her oxygen saturation was 98% on room air, she was ambulating with some assistance from either nursing or physical therapy, was tolerating regular diet and her pain was well controlled.
