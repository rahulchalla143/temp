GI Endoscopy reports: [**7-12**]: Impression: moderate esophagitis Grade II Varices at the lower third of the esophagus Blood in the stomach body Medium hiatal hernia Normal mucosa in the duodenum Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: No clear source of upper GI bleed found.
Transfuse to keep hct around 25.
Recommend MR enterography to evaluate for the same.
[**2113-7-13**] EGD: Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus Esophageal stricture Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: -If rebleeds, will need to alert the liver service for glue injection of varices -Given no evidence of cirrhosis, change from ceftriaxone to ciprofloxacin for a total course of 5 days for prophylaxis -Will need repeat EGD with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks -Nonurgent video swallow to evaluate the esophageal ring in order to guide if further EGDs with banding device can be attempted -OK to stop PPI, but continue octreotide drip for now -Two peripheral IV's at all times, serial Hcts with goal Hct 25 (avoid overtransfusion in setting of portal hypertension) .
[**2113-7-12**] CT ABD: IMPRESSION: Limited assessment demonstrating cecal mass, no active site of arterial extravasation, cholelithiasis, splenic enlargement, and multiple liver metastases.
If there is concern for ongoing bleeding, repeat exam could be performed.
Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would better exclude small vegetations.

Presented with melena, lightheaded, HCT 19.
Video swallow to evaluate high-up (by upper sphincter) esophageal ring was negative.
Followed CBC [**Hospital1 **] while having melena.
Transfused for HCT <25, avoiding over-transfusion in setting of portal HTN.
Some improvement with FFP [**2113-7-13**].
# Bacteremia: Blood culture [**2113-7-12**] grew Strep viridans.
TTE negative for vegetations.
Followed CBC [**Hospital1 **] while still having melena.
You initially went to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and underwent upper endoscopy (EGD) [**2113-7-12**].
The endoscopy (EGD) was repeated the following day [**2113-7-13**] while you were intubated (on a breathing machine) to protect your airway from bleeding.
This seems to have worked as your blood counts remained stable.
A blood culture from the day you were admitted grew a bacteria called Streptococcus viridans.
Echocardiogram showed no bacterial growth on the heart.
YOU WILL NEED A REPEAT UPPER ENDOSCOPY (EGD) ON [**8-22**] AND REPEAT BLOOD CULTURES IN TWO WEEKS THROUGH YOUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN.
[**First Name (STitle) 275**] [**Doctor Last Name **] AT [**Telephone/Fax (1) 43120**] FOR AN APPOINTMENT IN TWO WEEKS AND REPEAT BLOOD CULTURES.
