At his primary care physician's office today, he had a chest x-ray which disclosed an enlarged heart and interstitial infiltrates.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done, as well as an echocardiogram which disclosed evidence of a pericardial effusion with tamponade.
The patient was sent to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital6 256**] for evaluation of the pericardial effusion and drainage.
His pulses paradoxes was 18.
The echocardiogram performed in the Emergency Department was consistent with cardiac tamponade.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97 degrees.
Pulse 86.
Blood pressure 124/63.
Respiratory rate 23.
Oxygen saturation 95% on three liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Anicteric, oropharynx clear, pupils equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact.
Chest clear to auscultation anteriorly, left lateral chest scar.
Note:  This physical examination was done after the patient underwent his cardiac catheterization.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 7.3, hematocrit of 41, platelet count of 294,000.
PT 13, PTT 23.6, INR 1.1.
After the procedure, esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a sinus rhythm at 82 beats per minute, normal axis, prolonged PR, T wave inversions I and aVL, biphasic T in V2, Qs in V1 to V2, increased voltage.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**11-16**] for pericardiocentesis.
Hemodynamics showed elevated and equal RA and pericardial pressures, 11-12 mm mercury, slightly lower than pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
There is preserved blood pressure with 15-20 mm mercury pulses paradoxes.
Repeat echocardiogram did not disclose recurrence of the pericardial effusion.
Patient underwent CT of the chest which disclosed diffuse interstitial infiltrates consistent with lymphangitic spread.
Echocardiogram disclosed atrial flutter.
His blood pressure was stable.
While on sotalol, his QTC interval was monitored and his potassium was kept between 4.5 and 5.2.
Repeat echocardiogram did not disclose re-accumulation of the pericardial effusion.
A Pulmonary Consult was obtained for further evaluation of the diffuse infiltrates seen on the CT.
Patient underwent an MRI of his brain on [**11-23**].
An abdominal CT was done on [**11-23**].
CT of the abdomen disclosed one lymphangitic spread of metastatic disease throughout the lungs was stable since the study one week before.
Although, colon appeared grossly normal, radiologist's caution that the study was not diagnostic for colon cancer.
Finally, pathology results from pericardial fluid were obtained.
Patient was given [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Heart's monitor so that his QTC interval could be monitored for an additional week while on sotalol.
Pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade.
