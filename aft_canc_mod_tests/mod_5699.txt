Status post exploratory laparotomy with left    colectomy and Hartmann's pouch and a transverse colostomy.
Abdominal wound dehiscence - status post re-    exploration and repair.
He presented on [**11-8**] with repeat episodes of bright red blood per rectum and some abdominal pain for which he was admitted to the Medical Service.
His temperature was 99.1 and he was otherwise hemodynamically stable with an oxygen saturation of 96 percent.
His admission white count was 8.3 with hematocrit of 34 and notably had 35 percent bands.
His BUN and creatinine were 25 and 0.9 respectively.
His EKG showed T- wave inversion in Lead III which was new.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Service and started on antibiotics which included levofloxacin and Flagyl for his bandemia and underwent a CT scan which showed some nonspecific circumferential thickening of the sigmoid colon.
This was a limited exam of the left colon due to lack of bowel preparation but blood was noted in the colon with significant diverticulosis.
Postoperatively, the patient continued to have significant abdominal pain and on further workup, was found to have free air in the peritoneum and therefore there was concern for colonic perforation.
This was subsequently sent for pathology and showed evidence of colitis, but no other malignancy.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed, but there wasn't any evidence of cholecystitis or bile duct obstruction and it was felt to be secondary to his septic state and cholestasis.
Renally, the patient continued to progressively develop acute renal insufficiency with rising creatinine which at the time of his death was twice his baseline.
His peritoneal fluid grew out gram- negative rods which included E. coli and were consistent with feculent material.
The patient was found to have multiple episodes of [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans growing on blood cultures even after his vascular access lines had been changed.
