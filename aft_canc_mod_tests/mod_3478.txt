MICROBIOLOGY: blood cultures from [**10-4**], [**10-5**], [**10-16**] and [**10-17**] NO GROWTH dialysis fluid cultures [**10-4**], 10/14/ [**10-17**] NO GROWTH TTE [**10-4**]: The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CXR [**10-4**]: 1.
LE Doppler (arterial) [**10-5**]: Doppler evaluation was performed on the bilateral lower extremity arterial systems at rest only.
The ABI was unable to be obtained and the pulse volume recordings are flat at the thigh, calf, ankle, and metatarsal level.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
[**10-11**] CT Aorta/Bifem/Iliac: 1.
Grade 3 spondylolisthesis at L5-S1 level.
Would favor low INR goal if possible, once patient is further stabilized.
[**2135-10-17**] CT Chest w/out contrast IMPRESSION: 1.
PET CT is recommended for further evaluation.
A TEE showed complex atheroma in his aorta and he was started on heparin gtt and coumadin.
On [**10-17**] he became hypotensive to SBP 70s-80s associated with an episode of coffee ground emesis and guaiac positive stool and he was transferred to the MICU.
He was given IVF and 1U PRBC and his anticoagulation was stopped.
An upper endoscopy showed erosive esophagitis at the GE junction but no brisk bleeding.
His Hct and blood pressure remained stable, and he was subsequently called out to the floor for further management.
He was monitored overnight- his HCT and vitals were stable, and he did not pass melena again, so given that his family was anxious to take [**Last Name (un) **] home, he was discharged with plan to follow up with his PCP the next day ([**2135-10-27**]) with his scheduled appointment.
A LLE MRI was negative for evidence of osteomyelitis (although the study was somewhat limited due to lack of gadolinium).
His blood cultures from [**Hospital1 18**] were never positive.
# LE NECROTIC TOES Patient's exam was notable for non-dopplerable DP pulses and dry gangrene of toes on both feet.
He was evaluated by vascular surgery with a CT of his aorta/iliac/femoral vessels and then by a lower extremity angiogram.
At the time of discharge the coumadin has been held given 1 episode of melena [**10-25**] and INR 2.8, goal INR 2-2.5.
His delirium was felt to be multifactorial, including infection, ICU admission.
Renal team planned to discuss dialysis with his PCP/nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
BB was held as his SBPs were ~100s.
C. PUMP Echo demonstrated preserved EF, though the patient was felt to have chronic diastolic heart failure.
He was transfused 1 unit pRBC, and hct responded appropriately 23 - 26 and remained stable.
He was monitored overnight, his HCT the next day remained stable around 26, he was hemodynamically stable and his family was insistent that he leave, so he was discharged home with plan to f/u with PCP the next day.
# lung nodule and duodenal polyps - were observed on CT (see report), recommended for PCP to [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u as outpatient.
History of Cerebral Vascular Accident   Discharge Condition: Patient was not having fevers and his vital signs were stable.
Please follow up with your PCP and nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Thursday [**2135-10-27**]                                [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 734**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 735**] MD, [**MD Number(3) 799**]  Completed by:[**2135-10-26**
