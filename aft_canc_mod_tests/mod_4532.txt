The patient was confused on arrival to the ED which was attributed to a post-ictal state with CT scan at OSH showing no evidence of stroke and no significant metabolic derangement on laboratory testing.
As part of the patient's seizure workup, an MRI was ordered which revealed two heterogeneously enhancing lesions in the left parietal lobe, with suspicion for a malignant glioma.
An EEG revealed diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy but no epileptiform activity was noted.
The information was presented to the patient and given the progressive nature of his Parkinson's disease and debilitated state he chose not to undergo any further evaluation of the brain lesions.
The patient clearly expressed the risks of not pursuing any further evaluation or treatment and was willing to accept the consequences.
A lower extremity ultrasound was performed and revealed a right posterior tibial vein thrombosis.
Vascular surgery was consulted and recommended repeat ultrasound in 48 hours.
Repeat ultrasound revealed presence of the thrombosis in the right peroneal and right popliteal veins in addition to the original location.
Post-procedure evaluation did not reveal any hematoma or venous hum at the site.
Urinary Tract Infection: The patient was admitted two days into a course of Ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection that was culture positive for Citrobacter, which was pan-sensitive.
Several days into his stay on the medicine floor, the patient's white count was elevated to 13.
A chest x-ray revealed a patchy left lower lobe opacity that was possibly increased over an outside film scanned into the [**Hospital1 18**] system and likely represented atelectasis vs possible early infectious infiltrate.
Given the location of the infiltrate on chest x-ray, there was low suspicion for an aspiration event but one could not be ruled out definitely.
The following day the patient's white count was down to 11.3 and was 8.8 the following day, the morning of discharge.
The patient received vigorous hydration in the ICU prior to transfer to the medicine floor and his hematocrit declined to 32.8 at time of transfer to the medicine service.
His hematocrit stabilized at approximately 30 and remained so for the next eight days until the time of discharge.
Iron studies were ordered and were consistent with anemia of chronic disease (calTIBC 142, Ferritin 894, TRF 109) which was consistent with the patient's underlying disease process.
