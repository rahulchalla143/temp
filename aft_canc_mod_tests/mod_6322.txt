===================== CT of chest abdomen pelvis: 1.
FDG- PET can be obtained for further evaluation but lesion is borderline in size for detection by FDG-PET.
Pulmonary edema and atelectasis limits evaluation for pulmonary nodules; dedicated repeat chest CT could be obtained after optimization of pulmonary status for better assessment.
MR of the abdomen can be obtained for further characterization.
Repeat LENIS sowed no remaing DVT.
# Anemia: Pt's HCT was in the 30s 1 mo ago; on admission, HCT was 23 and dropped to 21 with guaiac positive stool but no frank blood in stool.
EGD was performed which showed large hiatal hernia but no source of bleed.
Colonoscopy was performed, which showed a 6 cm fungating mass in the sigmoid colon which was the likely source of the pt's anemia.
Pt's Hct in 30-31 range and stable on day of discharge.
Reccommened checking CBC at least twice per week or more often if grossly bloody bowel movements present.
==CT chest/abdomen/pelvis was done for staging.
This can be further evaluated by pelvic ultrasound (US showed complex cyst which should be followed in [**1-23**] months).
MR of the abdomen can be obtained for further characterization.
# Hx of "mild CHF": pt was on Lasix at home, but this was held on admission due to GI bleed.
