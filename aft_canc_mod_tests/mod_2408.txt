She had a hematocrit of 21.
Her LFTs were elevated at that time.
Work-up at [**Hospital3 1280**] was significant for a CT which showed bilateral complex adnexal masses.
Blood cultures were positive for E. Coli and she was placed on antibiotics.
She had an abnormal echocardiogram and positive hepatitis A.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for further management.
Cardiac evaluation including a stress thallium was within normal limits and she was placed on Lopressor and aspirin.
Patient's hematocrit remained stable after transfusion and vaginal bleeding subsided.
Her white count came down to 14 and patient was continued on levofloxacin.
The patient's creatinine came down to 1.8.
With this history, she was sent to the Gynecologic Oncology Service for further evaluation of the bilateral adnexal masses.
Patient underwent a consultation with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1022**] on [**2121-12-4**] and the plan at that time was to undergo a exploratory laparotomy and potentially tumor debulking depending on the findings.
Her hematocrit was checked and was found to be 23%, a decrease from her previous admission of 29.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission:  Patient's vital signs were noted to be stable.
Heart rate 86.
Blood pressure 140/80.
Respiratory rate 18 and 98% on room air.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, masses were palpable in the pelvic region bilaterally.
Pelvic exam was limited by body habitus.
LABORATORIES:  Her laboratories were pending at time of admission.
IN SUMMARY:  She is a 46-year-old G0 with large adnexal masses ongoing anemia and bleeding, hemodynamically stable with hematocrit that was pending.
She was given a bowel prep at that time and serial hematocrits were planned to be checked.
Here electrolytes were monitored and her renal function was monitored as well.
On [**2121-12-19**], she was noted to have a hematocrit of 29.9 and a creatinine of 3.4.
She received five units of packed red blood cells at [**Hospital3 1280**] during the prior three days and her previous last serial hematocrit was 29%.
There was a notable elevated white blood count of 15, no signs of infection were noted.
She was afebrile and a urinalysis and a culture were checked.
A repeat creatinine was sent to further monitor her renal function.
Pelvic mass:  The plan was to proceed with surgery for evaluation of the pelvic masses.
Her repeat hematocrit was 31.8 and creatinine was 3.9 increased from 3.4.
A urine electrolytes and creatinine were sent.
Urinalysis CNS was sent.
Sediment, BUN and creatinine, urine osmolality were run, as well as a renal ultrasound.
Her hematocrit later that afternoon was 31.8, BUN was 33 and creatinine was 3.7.
Urine osmolalities were 181 with the rest of her laboratories pending.
Ultrasound obtained at that time showed a left ovarian mass, 10.9 x 11.3 x 11.3 which was septated, right ovarian mass which was 15.5 x 11.9 x 9.9.
The Renal Consult was obtained and recommended following her creatinine and re-imaging via ultrasound if the creatinine was falling and hydronephrosis resolved for evaluation of her elevated creatinine, as well as monitoring her ins and outs closely.
Renal:   She was maintained on intravenous antibiotics with renal dosing and her creatinine was monitored and noted to be 3.3.
Cardiovascularly:  A troponin level was sent at that time as she had a previous history of myocardial infarction.
Her fluids were maintained at 125 an hour to follow her urine output.
Hematology:  Hematocrit was stable after four units of packed red blood cells and they followed serial hematocrits overnight.
Infectious Disease:  She was maintained on Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl following her white blood cell and awaiting cultures from intraoperative pathology.
She had been improved on her postoperative pain control and her JP drain was still monitored with a moderate output.
Her renal output was appreciated and her creatinine was noted to be 3.4 at midnight and 3.5 at 5 a.m.  She had a negative troponin evaluation and her fluid, electrolytes were monitored closely over postoperative day one.
Her hematocrit was noted to be stable and she was continued on Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl.
Her creatinine had noted to be decreased to 2.9 and her electrolytes were within normal limits.
Her hematocrit was notable stable at 29.5 and she was overall doing well.
She was continued on Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl and her white blood cell had been decreased to 14.
Postoperative day three, she had a mild episode of chest discomfort which appeared most consistent with gastritis although with a history of a myocardial infarction, an electrocardiogram was monitored and CKs were drawn.
Patient's CKs were notable negative over the course of that day and her electrocardiogram showed no difference from her previous electrocardiogram.
Her chest discomfort resolved with the passage of gas.
Her creatinine at that point was 2.1.
A renal ultrasound was scheduled for further evaluation of her potential obstruction hydronephrosis.
Her exam was otherwise benign and she was continued to be monitored in her postoperative state.
Her electrocardiogram was normal and her CKs were negative.
Renal function:  Her creatinine decreased to 1.8 over this period of time.
The evening of postoperative day four, she underwent a renal ultrasound which showed a resolution of her hydronephrosis on her right and a near resolution on the left.
Her physical examination was benign.
Her vital signs were all within normal limits.
Her laboratories showed her creatinine to be 1.4 even down from 1.8 and returned to her baseline.
Hematocrit was stable at 30.
Hematocrit was stable and her central line was withdrawn.
Anemia:  Hematocrit was stable, renal function.
Her creatinine had returned to its baseline and she was overall well.
Her JP was pulled at that time as the output was minimal and she was maintained on the outpatient basis on Ciprofloxacin, Flagyl and dicloxacillin.
