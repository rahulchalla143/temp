CT ABD (OSH) ([**2116-7-5**]): Distal esophogeal diverticulum vs ulcerated mass.
Echo [**2116-7-6**]: EF 30-35%, Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior akinesis, inferolateral hypokinesis, and apical hypokinesis.
Peak troponin 0.54, this am down to 0.52.
Echo this hospitalization reveals 30-35%, severe diastolic dysfxn, Inf AK, ant apical HK.
In comparison to echo in [**7-15**], concerning for new ischemia, however, Echo in [**2112**], also shows same WMA.
After transfer to the floor she had an episode of hypotension, with normal EKG, that was thought to be due to hypovolemia in the context of a Hct of 21.
BP normalized over the next days.
* Pneumonia: The bil LL pneumonia was identified on CT abdomen when pt initially presented at OSH with abdominal pain.
The CXR at [**Hospital1 **] revealed multifocal pneumonia.
CXR ([**7-8**])shows improving consolidation in right lower lobe, likely pneumonia.
F/u CXR in [**6-18**] wks recomended to see resolution of findings.
Non-contrast CT abdomen at OSH negative.
[**7-5**] AST 28, ALT 34, Alk Phos 161, Total Bili 0.4, Alb 3.8, Amylase 61 and Lipase 27.
Pain was attributed to pleural irritation in the context of PNA.
last transfusion pn [**2116-6-25**].
Hct trending down during admission.
Pt also symptomatic with Hct 21.
* Possible esophogeal mass: Distal esophageal diverticulum versus ulcerated mass seen at the distal third of esophagus on CT abdomen/pelvis at [**Hospital 6136**] Hospital.
Will need CXR vs CT to f/u once PNA resolved.
