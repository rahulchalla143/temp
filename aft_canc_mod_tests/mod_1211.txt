CXR [**3-16**]:  No free air is seen under the diaphragms.
Renal US [**3-17**]: 1.
Moderate-to-severe hydronephrosis in the right kidney with associated parenchymal thinning, not significantly changed from previous CT dated [**2131-1-26**].
Cystoscopy [**3-19**]: There were noted clots within the proximal urethra and a notably high bladder neck that was also hypervascular.
CT abd/pelvis without contrast [**3-20**]: 1.
CXR [**3-22**]: 1.
An EKG was performed without any ischemic changes.
Based off of CXR, it was most likely that the pt's hypoxia was secondary to aspiration PNA vs. an aspiration pneumonitis.
As the CXR was also significant for vascular congestion, his IVFs were limited and he was diuresed with IV lasix.
His Hct also fell from 34.5 to 22.3 and his Cr climbed from 1.4 to 3.6.
Urology took the pt for cystoscopy in which a large blood clot occupying [**4-15**] of the bladder was evacuated and a large, high grade appearing R ureteral mass was biopsied and resected.
His oxygen requirement was weaned off and he was sating in the mid 90s on RA by time of discharge.
Of note, the pt had two seperate urinary void trials without success prior to d/c (bladder scan with 450 cc, 400 cc respectively).
A cytoscopy was performed in which a large blood clot was evacuated from the bladder and a mass was removed and biopsied from the R ureteral orifice.
