She also had an MRI showing 3 x 4 cm mass arising from the choroid plexus atrium of the right lateral ventricle.
She was watched closely with frequent neuro checks, and a post-op CT showed no bleeding or mass effect, with the tumor resected.
Neurology was consulted at this point, and an MRI showed probable acute infarct in the right posterior lenticulostriate territory adjacent to the ventricle, as well as postoperative changes with resection of mass without residual nodular enhancement.
A psych consult was obtained for persistent agitation and exacerbation of her schizoaffective disorder, who recommended a 1:1 sitter, and re-adjusted her psych meds, including adding seroquel and prn haldol.
A speech and swallow study was also performed, and she was cleared for PO ground solids and pureed food and thin liquids.
On [**9-2**], her sutures were removed.
