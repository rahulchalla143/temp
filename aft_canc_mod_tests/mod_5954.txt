He was then referred for a CAT scan of his chest which revealed a large right upper lobe spiculated mass suspicious for malignancy.
He was then referred for PET scan which was positive.
His blood, urine, and sputum were cultured with no growth at the time of discharge.
CT Head ([**12-23**]): There is a roughly 2.2 x 2.0 cm area of hypodensity (Hounsfield units 21) in the right medial cerebellum.
An MRI of the brain with gadolinium may be valuable in further characterization.
Brain MRI ([**12-24**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Hence, leptomeningeal enhancement cannot be excluded based on this appearance.
A selective right bronchial-intercostal arteriogram showed no abnormal blush or extravasation.
He was found to have a RUL PNA on CT scan [**12-23**], which was thought to be post-obstructive, and he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn).
# NSCLC/Hemoptysis: CT Chest showed that the right upper lobe mass has grown from 2.8 x 4.2 cm on [**2175-11-1**] to 4.3 x 5.7.
The patient underwent palliative XRT initially but after his brain biopsy came back negative for malignancy by preliminary report, he had definitive XRT.
# Post-obstructive pneumonia: CT chest showed RUL PNA, which was likely post-obstructive.
WBC peaked at 17.0, and he was febrile at OSH.
BAL Culture had sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora.
Blood culture with NGTD.
He was given a 12-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for broad coverage of post-obstructive vs. hospital aquired pneumonia.
CT head on [**12-23**] showed 2.2 x 2.0 cm area of hypodensity in the right medial cerebellum which did not demonstrate FDG avidity on the recent PET CT.  A follow up Brain MRI showed 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm enhancing lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere, representing a metastatic focus.
Neurosurgery was consulted, and the patient underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy on [**12-27**] which was negative for malignancy by preliminary report.
# Hypotension->Hypertension:  Patient was hypotensive at time of transfer, requiring levophed, however his blood pressure improved with cessation of sedation and extubation.
His CVP transduced upon admission was 4.
It was felt less likely that the patient had a sepsis from his pneumonia, and blood Cx showed NGTD.
Since extubation, patient has become hypertensive with SBP 190-200.
Amlodipine was held, however, and was to be added back by PCP when appropriate  Medications on Admission: Medications on transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]: Vancomycin 1g q12 Zosyn 4.5 q8 Fentanyl drip Midazolam drip Levophed drip Lansoprazole .
You also underwent a biopsy of a mass in a part of your brain called cerebellum.
The biopsy did not show any cancer involvement, by preliminary report.
