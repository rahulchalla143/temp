He also had a holter revealing afib (rate 40-100), nuclear stress ([**2163-11-1**])without ischemia and normal ECHO on [**2163-11-3**] (mild AS, mild MR).
Upon arrival to the ED he was found to be hypotensive with hyperkalemia and ARF (Cr ~4 from basline of 1.2)  He was sent to the floor, diuresed and then sent to the ICU after he was hypotensive requiring dopamine and vasopressin.
Swan numbers: RA: 25 RV: 55/20/10 PA: 55/25 PCW: 26 His L flank pain was evaluated with a CT Abdomen and he was found to have L nephrolithiasis and an exophytic cyst on the lower pole of the L kidney.
He was transferred for evaluation of his mediatinal LAD.

Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Lymph nodes, 4L, biopsy (A-C): Metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasm, most consistent with carcinoid tumor, in two of ten lymph nodes/lymph node fragments.
Lymph nodes, 7, biopsy (D): Metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasm, most consistent with carcinoid tumor, in three of four lymph nodes/lymph node fragments.
Lymph nodes, level 7, biopsy (E): Metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasm, most consistent with carcinoid tumor, in one of two lymph nodes/lymph node fragments.
Note: Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells are diffusely positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin and are negative for CK 7 and TTF-1.
INTERPRETATION: Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
There is overlapping opacification, which was seen on the previous film, in the left lower lung which might be postoperative, inflammatory, or malignant and further evaluation is needed.
[**2163-11-23**] CXR Post-Bronch:  FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the left lung is slightly better aerated.
[**2163-11-24**] CXR: PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Compared to recent studies of [**2163-11-23**], there is improved aeration of the left upper lung, without evidence of new pneumothorax.
[**2163-11-25**] CT Scan Chest:  IMPRESSIONS: 1.
Comparison with prior study if available could help differentiate between the two.
Dedicated imaging of the adrenal glands recommended for further evaluation.

Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper respiratory       secretions.
Bacterial culture results are invalid.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2163-11-26**]):    NO GROWTH, <1000 CFU/ml.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2163-11-29**]):    NO GROWTH.

Echo was performed which revealed severe diastolic dysfunction with ejection fraction of >70%.
On post-op CXR there was noticeable whiteout of the left lung field and the patient was kept in the PACU for observation.
Patient continued to have a significant oxygen requirement, satting 93% on 40% facemask, thus was transferred to the ICU for monitoring.
In ICU on [**11-25**], patient underwent upper airway suctioning, along with albuterol, ipratropium, and mucinex treatment.
Serial chest x-rays showed eventual clearing of his left lung.
His oxygen saturation improved to 100% on 4L.
He underwent a chest CT which showed a large right pleural effusion and left airspace disease possibly consistent with pneumonia.
His respiratory status continued to improve, and he was weaned down to 2L NC O2, and often maintained O2 sats > 94% on room air at rest.
These results were discussed with the patient and his outpatient oncologist.
diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: ECHO with EF of 75%, has severe dCHF.
This can be titrated up as his blood pressure allows.
His INR rose to the therapeutic range, and was 2.5 on discharge.
Diuresis minimized on the floor, received 40 mg IV lasix and 40mg PO lasix on two occasions with good diuresis, pt maintained blood pressures.
The pathology reports showed this was consistent with carcinoid.
A CT scan showed a mass on your left adrenal gland, this should be worked up as an outpatient, you should talk with your primary care doctor about further evaluation.
On a CT scan, you were noted to have a mass on your left adrenal gland, and they recommended dedicated CT or MRI for better characterization.
Follow up with your cardiologist  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41632**] [**Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 19666**], fax [**Telephone/Fax (1) 66057**] within the next 2-3 weeks for reevaluation and adjustment of heart failure meds as needed.
