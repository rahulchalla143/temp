Labs were notable for white count of 18.7 (21.2 on [**2117-11-11**]) and Hct 23.3 down from 27.7, troponin <0.01 and lactate 1.7.
Urinalysis had trace leuks, neg nitrates and WBC 14 with few bacteria.
She was given vancomycin 1g IV, cefepime 1g IV, and pulse dose of methylprednisone 125mg IV.
Blood pressures dropped to systolic 80s.
Vital signs prior to transfer were T 98.6, 109, 107/55, NRB @ 99%.
CXR was read as extensive metastatic disease to the lungs with right pleural effusion and right basal consolidation.

She failed to improve after multiple courses of antibiotics and eventually a CT scan of the chest on [**2117-7-27**] demonstrated consolidation of the right lower lobe and right middle lobe with narrowing of the bronchus intermedius.
[**2117-8-20**]: underwent a third bronchoscopy, biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma with LVI, and pathology from 4 lymph nodes also contained adenocarcinoma.
The patient had a CT pulmonary angiogram to rule out PE for complaints of worsening shortness of breath and it revealed substantial consolidation in the right middle lobe with the right lower mass, now measuring up to 15 cm, although some of that may have been collapse of the right lower lobe.
[**2117-9-3**]: MRI of the brain was negative.
She was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3460**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of Radiation Oncology and chest simulation was planned for [**Date range (1) 98517**]/11: While inpatient at [**Hospital1 18**] evalulation of R hip demonstrated intramedullary tumor in the femur, but the cortex was intact.

CTA chest ([**2117-11-16**])- As compared to the previous examination from [**2117-10-27**], there is no relevant change.
An area of consolidation at the left lung base has minimally increased.
CTA showed no pulmonary embolism, and no evidence of radiation pneumonitis, and so steroids were discontinued on HD2.
Paitent was rapidly weaned from pressors and her BPs normalized.
CTA showed stable diffuse pulmonary infiltrates without progression of disease.
