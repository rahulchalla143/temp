ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  CBC with a white blood cell count of 6.9, poly 72, lymphocytes 18, hematocrit 33, platelets 255, BUN 9, creatinine 3.4, K 3.5.
Echocardiogram done in [**Month (only) 956**] showed normal ejection fraction with mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation noted.
Vascular examination showed a pleasant male in no acute distress.
HEENT examination was unremarkable.
The lungs were diminished at the right base and abdominal examination had a palpable aortic aneurysm.
The foot examination showed a left foot cold with ischemic appearing black ulceration on the left medial heel and ankle with no erythema, fluctuance or drainage.
The pulse examination showed palpable femorals on the right, dopplerable on the left.
The dorsalis pedis pulses were absent bilaterally.
The foot x-ray showed no evidence of osteomyelitis.
Arteriogram on [**2113-3-30**] showed a abdominal aortic aneurysm with a left common iliac aneurysm with plaque.
Recommendations were to hold his Coumadin, normalize his INR, begin heparinization for goal PTT between 40 and 60, obtain MRI/MRA of the left leg and the aorta to evaluate the aorta and in flow disease, consider cardiac workup with echocardiogram and PMIBI, continue antibiotics broad spectrum, follow culture results and tailor as necessary.
Echocardiogram was obtained, which demonstrated symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The overall ventricular function EF was greater then 55%.
Compared to previous study on [**2113-1-18**] there is probably a similar aortic gradient that is slightly higher.
His nuclear portion showed an abnormal study with severe fixed defect involving the basilar portion of the inferior wall.
The ejection fraction was calculated at 54% and on visual inspection it is in the range of 65 to 70.
The patient had a CTA of the abdomen and pelvis to determine abdominal aortic aneurysm.
hold for systolic blood pressure less then 100, heart rate less then 60.
