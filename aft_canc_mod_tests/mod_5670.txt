Wound and blood cultures were taken immediately in the ED, and he was started on IV vanco, given his MRSA history.
An ECG was obtained which showed an SVT at 143, with lateral ST depressions.
His wound culture returned sparse MSSA, and he was switched from IV vanco to IV oxacillin.
Blood cultures were negative at the time of discharge.
He was ruled out for MI, with CKs of 37, 37, 33, and TnT of 0.07, 0.05 and 0.03.
On HD#3, he had an echo, which showed LV EF 30% and LV infereolateral akinesis (see echo [**2169-3-31**]).
He was maintained on IV vanco for 3 days, and then switched to IV oxacillin after wound culture grew sparse MSSA.
His blood sugar was relatively well controlled during this admission, with finger sticks ranging from 100 to low 200s.
