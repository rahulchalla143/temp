Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2138-8-1**]: Segment VII mass resection, cholecystectomy, intraoperative ultrasound thoracentesis x2 ([**2138-9-4**], [**2138-8-22**]) TIPS [**2138-9-8**] VATS pleurodesis [**9-12**] [**2138-9-14**] Doxycycline pleurodesis   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 49-year-old male with chronic HCV, Child B cirrhosis and history of alcohol abuse who presented to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital emergency room with abdominal pain approximately 2 months ago.
He presented to the emergency department again later that day with recurrent pain, and underwent a liver ultrasound on [**2138-5-11**], which demonstrated cholelithiasis, splenomegaly, several calcified splenic granulomas, and the liver parenchyma was heterogeneous, likely due to hepatocellular dysfunction.
CT scan of the abdomen on [**5-11**] demonstrated a subtle lesion measuring 2.7 x 3.5 cm in segment VII of the liver, with a 1.7 x 1.2-cm hypodense cystic component that was incompletely characterized.
An MRI of the abdomen on [**5-12**] demonstrated a 3.5 x 3.0-cm mass in the right lower liver, most consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.
An EUS on [**5-15**] demonstrated 1 abnormal lymph node in the celiac region, and FNA was negative.
A triphasic CT scan of the abdomen at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-11**] demonstrated a 3.8-cm lesion in segment VII consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.
AFP was 29.9, CA19- 9 was 35.
His HCV viral load was 43,800 international units/ml.
His preoperative AST was 106, ALT 78, alkaline phosphatase 156, total bilirubin 1.0, direct bilirubin 0.4, and albumin 4.1.
Cause of death was relayed to have been secondary to heavy alcohol consumption - details are unclear   Physical Exam: GENERAL: No acute distress; awake and alert; responsive; sallow complexion HEENT: Mucous membranes moist and pink; no scleral icterus; no occular or nasal discharge CARDIAC: Mild tachycardia with regular rhythm; grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur; no rubs or gallops PULMONARY: Decreased lung sounds at the mid and lower R. lung fields, otherwise clear to auscultation ABDOMEN: Soft, mild nonfocal tenderness, distended without appreciable fluid wave.
CT drain sites healing well c/d/i with sutures in place.
EXTREMITIES: Trace edema in the lower extremities bilaterally; palpable DP pulses bilaterally  Pertinent Results: Admission labs:  [**2138-8-1**] 05:22PM   GLUCOSE-237* LACTATE-6.4* NA+-137 K+-5.9* CL--101 [**2138-8-1**] 05:22PM   TYPE-ART PO2-195* PCO2-56* PH-7.26* TOTAL CO2-26 BASE XS--2 [**2138-8-1**] 05:25PM   FIBRINOGE-114* [**2138-8-1**] 05:25PM   PT-18.6* PTT-44.4* INR(PT)-1.7* [**2138-8-1**] 05:25PM   WBC-6.9# RBC-3.51* HGB-11.5* HCT-30.6* MCV-87# MCH-32.7* MCHC-37.5* RDW-16.7*  Discharge Labs [**2138-9-22**] 04:40AM BLOOD WBC-3.6* RBC-3.17* Hgb-10.5* Hct-30.0* MCV-95 MCH-33.0* MCHC-34.9 RDW-16.7* Plt Ct-57* [**2138-9-18**] 05:08AM BLOOD PT-21.3* PTT-42.8* INR(PT)-2.0* [**2138-9-23**] 05:48AM BLOOD Glucose-88 UreaN-7 Creat-0.8 Na-142 K-3.7 Cl-110* HCO3-23 AnGap-13 [**2138-9-20**] 04:40AM BLOOD ALT-31 AST-78* AlkPhos-38* TotBili-1.2 [**2138-9-18**] 05:08AM BLOOD Albumin-3.9 Calcium-9.4 Phos-2.5* Mg-1.6 [**2138-8-2**] 09:09AM BLOOD freeCa-1.13  Brief Hospital Course: 49 year- old male with chronic HCV, Child's class B cirrhosis, and history of alcohol abuse now with a segment VII liver mass consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.
On post-operative day 1 he received transfusions of another 2 units of PRBCs for a hematocrit of 23.6  On post-operative day 3 the patient had a fever to 101 with chest X-ray that failed to demonstrate focal pneumonia.
Blood and urine cultures were negative for growth.
High out-put of peritoneal fluid was also noted from his JP drains, medial > lateral which was repleted with IV fluids and albumin (begun on a regimen of 25mg of albumin q8hrs) to increase oncotic pressure within the vasculature.
The high JP out-put persisted, and the peritoneal fluid was sent for cytology on post-op day 7, which was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and failed to demonstrate micro-organism growth on culture.
Portal ultrasound was obtained and negative for acute change.
Drainage of acetic fluid and urine output was drastically improved with regimen of 40mg Lasix IV twice daily and 25mg 25% IV albumin q8hrs.
Chest X-ray was significant for R. lower lobe collapse.
Following this incident the patient remained afebrile with stable oxygen saturations and stable WBC count.
Serial chest X-rays demonstrated improved aieration of the R. lower lobe but subsequent collapse of the R. middle lobe.
The patient's edema/swelling returned to baseline with acetic fluid output decreased to less than 250cc/24hrs and on post-operative day 18 the medial JP drain was removed without any notable increase in drainage from the incision.
The following day the patient's creatnine was noted to abruptly increase (from 0.7 to 1.6) with hypotensive episodes to systolic blood pressures <90mmHg following Lasix/Aldactone administration and accompanying tachycardia.
Urine electrolytes were obtained, with FeNa+ calculated to be 1.2% (pre-renal) and the patient was re-started on fluids and albumin 25% TID.
A STAT chest X-ray was performed when the patient was noted to have oxygen desaturation on exertion.
Both this and a chest CT demonstrated a large R. pleural effusion.
The patient was transferred to the SICU for further management of likely hepatic hydro-thorax, and underwent thoracentesis with removal of 3.2L of fluid that did not demonstrate any microorganism growth on culture or in gram stain.
Serial chest X-rays demonstrated persisten R. pleural effusion, however the patient remained stable clinically and without shortness of breath or desaturation.
Despite the increase in diuretics, the patient's R. pleural effusion persisted although the patient continued to remain asymptomatic and oxygen saturations were 94-98% at baseline.
Psychiatric evaluation was obtained at that time, in addition to another evaluation on post-operative day 33 when the patient began reporting racing thoughts, "bad thoughts," and increasing insomnia.
Seroquel was decreased prior to discharge for excessive somolence  On hospital day 32 discussion between the hepatobiliary surgical and medical teams concluded in the decision to proceed with TIPS as the patient's hepatic hydrothorax was failing to demonstrate any improvement with conservative management and his renal function was not tolerant of higher doses of diuretic therapy.
A MRI was ordered for better evaluation of the patient's anatomy prior to procedure (due to the patient's segment VII liver resection, the L. hepatic vein -usual site of access- would not be an ideal choice and evaluation of the R. hepatic vein as an alternative site of access was warranted).
