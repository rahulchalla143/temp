FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-24**], there may be a tiny residual left apical pneumothorax.
Some increased opacification at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle is consistent with atelectasis and pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year old male admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] service after an ETT showed marked ST segment depressions in the inferolateral leads.
He was taken immediately for cardiac catheterization which revealed multivessel disease.
His medications were adjusted for afterload and cardiac remodeling reduction with metoprolol, and his statin was increased to a maximum dose.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
