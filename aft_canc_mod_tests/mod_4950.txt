Here her exam is notable for left sided weakness in in both upper and lower extremities.
Her CT shows significant amount of hydrocephalus with sulcal effacement.
Cervical spine CT fails to show any obstruction.
Repeat MRI imaging of both the head and cervical spine fail to elucidate the cause of hydrocephalus.
An LP was done that showed an opening pressure of 26 (not fully relaxed), with elevated protein of 292.
Post op Ct shows good placement of right VP shunt.
UA was negative but review of lab work showed a few bacteria on [**8-18**].
Urine culture was sent and is pending.
