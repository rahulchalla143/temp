Over the next 2 weeks, her cough progressed, was associated with fever to around 100 on-and-off, SOB with exertion, and on day of presentation to [**Location (un) 47**], had episode of nausea and vomiting.
During [**Hospital 228**] hospital course at [**Location (un) 47**], she had an admission CXR demonstrating large RUL and RML consolidation, mass like lesion in R hilum c/w pneumonia, ?post-obstructive, ?recurrent ca.
Patient also had ECHO done in the ED that demonstrated small pericardial effusion of 1.1 cm, no evidence of tamponade.
Follow up ECHO 5 days after admission demonstrated increase of her pericardial effusion, still no evidence of tamponade, and therefore patient was transferred for balloon pericardiotomy.
Hospital course otherwise notable for transfusion of 2 units pRBC that brought her Hct from 26-> 30.2.

CXR [**2-18**]: IMPRESSION: Interval development of marked right-sided upper lung volume loss.
These findings would all be better assessed with contrast-enhanced CT examination of the chest.
Echo [**2-18**]: Conclusions: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echo [**2-18**]: Conclusions: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo woman with PMH of lung cancer, diastolic dysfxn, CRI, who presented with pericardial effusion for pericaricentesis and pericardiotomy.
The fluid was serosanguinous, labs showed [**Numeric Identifier 102834**] RBCs, 3000 WBCs, 85 polys, 11 lymps, 2 monos, 1 eo, 1 macro.
Her electrolytes were within normal limits.
RUL and RML pna on CXR c/w possible post-obstructive pna.
On presentation, got repeat CXR that demonstrated severe consolidation of RUL, RML, upper part of RLL.
Chest CT performed at OSH, so not repeated here, but this was presumed to be post-obstructive pna.
Likely cancer recurrence as etiology of pericardial effusion as above, and w/ CXR findings from OSH and here, and references to Chest CT findings from OSH.
Plan to: - f/u cytology of pericardial effusion .
# Transaminitis: On admission, pt noted to have elevated transaminases (AST 76, ALT 123, Alk Phos 148, LDH 278).
Abd exam non-tender.
Consider abdominal CT if they trend up.
