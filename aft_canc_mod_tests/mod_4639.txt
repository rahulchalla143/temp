Her oncologic history began in [**2134**], after she underwent an MRI to evaluate back pain was incidentally found to have a left kidney mass.
A small liver lesion was noted during her yearly followup CT scans for which she underwent an ultrasound which did not reveal metastatic disease.
During an annual mammogram on [**2140-7-8**], she was discovered to have a new density in her right breast.
An ultrasound guided biopsy of this mass was performed on [**2140-8-11**], and pathology revealed the presence of an invasive carcinoma with clear cell features concerning for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
PET CT performed on [**2140-8-26**], showed the presence of a lesion in the medial right hepatic lobe, worrisome for a growing neoplasm.
She was planned for liver and breast resection on [**2140-10-28**], but her liver lesion was more extensive than thought prior to surgery and could not be resected.
She underwent right partial mastectomy with pathology from the breast and a repeat liver biopsy confirming metastatic kidney cancer.
She passed eligibility testing and presents today to begin cycle 1, week 1, high- dose IL-2 therapy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Thyroid cancer [**2131**], status post thyroidectomy and radioiodine treatment; renal cell cancer as above; status post tonsillectomy in [**2091**]; bladder surgery in [**2099**]; status post hysterectomy and bladder repair in [**2101**]; cholecystectomy in [**2118**]; multiple bladder repairs including a sling in [**2136**], and multiple rectocele repairs from [**2137**]-[**2139**]; arthroscopic left knee surgery in [**2127**].
VITAL SIGNS:  96 9, 78, 20, 142/70, O2 sat 96% on room air.
NEUROLOGIC:  Exam nonfocal.
LAB RESULTS:  White blood count 6.4, hemoglobin 12.8, hematocrit 37.1, platelet count 274,000, INR 1, BUN 16, creatinine 1, sodium 140, potassium 4.3, chloride 105, CO2 26, glucose 111, ALT 64, AST 54, LDH 209, CK 119, total bili 0.3, albumin 4.0.
Her admission weight was 91 kg and she received interleukin-2, 600,000 units per kg based on adjusted ideal body weight, equaling 40.1 milliunits IV every 8 hours x14 potential doses.
At that time her blood pressure was in the high 50s.
She initially stabilized with blood pressure in the high 90 to low 100s, and then again developed hypotension to the 70-80 range with additional IV fluids given.
Her hypoxia improved and she was treated with Lasix on treatment day #6 once her systolic blood pressure stabilized.
During this week she developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 3.3 improved to 2.9 at the time of discharge.
She had associated oliguria and metabolic acidosis with a minimum bicarb of 18 improved with bicarbonate replacement intravenously.
Electrolytes were monitored and repleted per protocol.
Strict I's and O's, serum chemistries were maintained.
During this week she developed transaminitis with a peak ALT of 55 and a peak AST of 71, both improved at the time of discharge.
She developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of 3.2, improved to 1.9 at the time of discharge.
She developed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count low of 103,000 without evidence of bleeding.
