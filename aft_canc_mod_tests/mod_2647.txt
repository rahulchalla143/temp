She was transferred from an outside hospital for evaluation and treatment of adenocarcinoma involving the transverse colon and gallbladder.
A CAT scan of the abdomen showed air-fluid levels in the gallbladder.
A HIDA scan at the other hospital did not show filling of the gallbladder indicating some sort of cystic duct obstruction.
The first imaging study that was done at [**Hospital1 18**] was a MRCP which revealed an enhanced thickened gallbladder wall consistent with chronic cholecystitis.
A differential according to the imaging included a fistula with adjacent inflammatory change but also carcinoma or adenomatosis.
Of note, at the outside hospital, an endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed.
The colonoscopy showed two polyps and also a region in the transverse colon that was biopsied.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was scheduled for an operative date on [**2191-8-23**] and over the next few days she was given a low-residual diet.
She had her belly cleaned with Hibiclens one a day and once an adequate preoperative evaluation was performed, she was given a bowel prep on Monday afternoon and evening in preparation for an exploratory laparotomy on Tuesday, [**2191-8-23**].
On the morning of [**2191-8-23**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a cholecystectomy, partial hepatectomy, partial lymph node dissection, a colocolostomy, partial colectomy, and in addition a gastrostomy and a feeding jejunostomy were also put in place.
