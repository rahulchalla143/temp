Admission Date:  [**2195-12-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2196-1-8**]   Service:  Thoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year old female who was first noted to have a right upper lung mass on chest x-ray in [**2194-12-17**] as she was preoped for a coronary artery bypass graft.
A computerized tomography scan was done then and then repeated in [**Month (only) 205**] showing slight increase in this finding.
A PET scan was then done and was positive.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 99.5, heart rate 80, blood pressure 122/80, saturations 93% on room air, weight 151 pounds.
It was therefore decided to proceed with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and a wedge resection of this right upper lobe mass.
It was also noted that she had a left lower lobe nodule which seemed benign on the computerized tomography scan and it was planned to remove that as well.
She was doing well on postoperative day #1 until in the afternoon and it was noted that her blood pressure were starting to decline.
Although this was teated, she eventually had blood pressure as high as 200 systolic and at the same time because tachycardiac and developed respiratory failure.
A similar episode occurred the next day requiring short-term intubation and at that point it became clear that the blood pressures were clearly associated with the occurrence of the respiratory failure and at this point chest x-rays also showed more clearly that she had developed congestive heart failure.
which at her current dose is controlling her blood pressures well.
Her blood pressure is well controlled with Captopril p.o.
Genitourinary - Her urine output is always maintained.
At some point during her stay here her creatinine had slightly bumped up to 2 secondary to aggressive diuresis.
Once we backed off on the diuresis, her creatinine bumped back down and prior to discharge her creatinine is 1.5 and should be followed.
At no time was she febrile and her white count was normal.
