On [**2131-11-20**] she underwent an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, resection of desmoid, enterectomy of ileostomy, closure of enterotomy and re-doing of ileostomy and repair of abdomial wall with [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex mesh.
Omn [**2132-2-26**], she had a complex revision of her ileostomy and debridement of granulation tissue.

Signed Electronically by [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] E on [**Doctor First Name **] [**2132-5-15**] 8:59 AM  Name:  [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]            Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 63862**]  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]                     Date:  [**2132-4-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-9-5**]        Sex:  F  Surgeon:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD 2362  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Gastrointestinal cutaneous fistula, desmoid tumor of abdominal wall and desmoplastic reaction throughout her abdomen.
The place where the fistula had leaked through the abdominal wall was oversewn and we opened up the abdominal wall to enter an abdominal abscess and also an abscess within the abdomen which was then drained.
The Vicryl which was still present was removed and was involved in the abscess cavity.
The abdominal wall was left intact.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3224**] stapler was then placed across the ileostomy about I would imagine 6 to 8 inches proximal and fired.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was then placed over the fascia, 3-0 Vicryl to the subcutaneous tissue and 4-0 Monocryl with subcuticular closure.
URINE OUTPUT:  415 cc.
First retrograde pyelograms were performed using the cone tip catheter in bilateral ureteral orifices.
These were sent for plain films and then attention was given to the right ureteral orifice.
Retrograde pyelogram was performed noting a very tight stricture at the mid and upper ureter.
She had  a fifth CT of the abdomen on [**2132-4-10**], which revealed an enterocutaneous fistula in the mid-abdomen.
She also had a fistulogram on [**2132-4-15**], which reveals the persistent enterocutaneous fistula between the ileum and the skin.
Midway through her hospital course, she had an increase in her fever curve and blood cultures did reveal Enterobacter cloacae and she has been treated with antibiotics.
With regard to her desmoid tumor, she has been on tamoxifen 120 mg daily and sulindac 300 mg daily for this and she has had some  decrease in size by the CT on [**2132-4-10**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature of 100.3, blood pressure 108/64, respiratory rate is 18, and pulse is 92.
PULMONARY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
GASTROINTESTINAL: Exam is abnormal with a large palpable mass of  approximately 10 to 12 cm in the right lower abdomen.
LABORATORY DATA: Today, white blood cell count is 5.1, hemoglobin 7.2, hematocrit 22.3, and platelet count is 326,000.
PT 14.9, INR 1.3, and PTT 28.3.
Albumin 1.9, calcium 7.4, TIBC 163, and ferritin 53.
Her ferritin is 53 in the setting of this active inflammation and bacteremia, which is probably falsely elevating it, so giving her a dose of iron with  a Fergon daily or b.i.d.
[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 63870**] MD  eScription document:[**4-/2132**]  cc:[**Hospital1 63871**]   Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 1154**] [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the surgical service of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2132-4-9**] with the diagnosis of an enterocutaneous fistula.
A CT scan on HD 2 showed no evidence for discrete rim-enhancing or gas-containing fluid collection/abscess within the abdomen or pelvis.
On HD 7, she had a fistulogram which revealed filling of the previously demonstrated enterocutaneous fistula, retrograde from the location of the ostomy site, consistent with a fistula between the ileum and the enterocutaneous fistula.
Her cultures had Gram negative bacteria in the blood (septicemia).
Her ostomy output was high (3225) and 1:1 fluid replacements were begun.
Her ostomy output was 1475.
On POD 8 her JP drain output increased to 925cc.
Her JP outputs decreased but her J-tube output continued to be heavy.
On POD 10, she developed acute onset upper abdominal pain and pleuritic chest pain.
A chest X-ray revealed a right lower lobe opacity.
A KUB showed improved obstruction, non-specific bowel gas pattern.
Since a PE was high on the differential, a CTA was obtained that showed  multi-subsegmental right pulmonary emboli.
A CT of the abdomen demonstrated marked diffuse abdominal inflammatory process with multiple fluid collections is grossly unchanged from [**2132-4-10**], without definite evidence for perforation.
A heparin drip was started (goal PTT 60-80).
On POD 11, upper and lower extremity ultrasounds were negative for DVT.
Her ostomy output was encouraging (275).
On POD 13 her ostomy output was 45 and her J-tube output was 1900.
Her fistula output was decreased (75cc) and her J-tube output was decreased (850).
On POD 19, her JP outputs were low (70 and 20).
On POD 20 her albumin was up to 3.4.
On POD 22, an ultrasound of her abdomen showed a right lower quadrant abdominal wall collection with echogenic fluid and a slightly thick wall.
This is approximately 50% smaller by measurement compared to prior CT scan of [**2132-5-2**].
A trace amount of fluid was aspirated from the abdominal wall fluid collection (this likely represents an organizing hematoma).
On POD 23, her ostomy output was increasing and her J tube output was decreasing.
On POD 24 her JP output was decreasing (30, 5).
Her J-tube was clamped as a trial 1 out of every 4 hours.
Her J tube put out 1100 and her ostomy put out 560.
Her J-tube clamp trials were stopped since the drainage was unchanged.
On POD 34, she had a renal ultrasound which showed bilateral grade 2 hydronephrosis, which is unchanged when compared to [**2132-5-2**].
Her JP drain culture showed Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas that was pan sensitive.
On POD 43 her J-tube outputs continued to rise with question of possible fistula with JP drain.
On POD 47 a fistulogram was performed which showed a RLQ enterocutaneous fistula that fills the bowel from the distal JP, with a small surrounding abscess.
A renal scan was also performed which showed hydronephrosis, left greater than right.
On POD 49 an abdominal CT scan was done showing no new abscess.
Cultures were taken and infectious disease was consulted.
On POD 69 her foley catheter was removed, a fistulogram was performed, and her J-tube was replaced.
She was afebrile, her nutrition was improving, and her JP output was decreased.
On POD 84 her repeat cultures had not grown out anything.
On POD 97 she was experiencing some RUQ tenderness.
An ultrasound was performed which showed biliary sludge in a non-distended gallbladder.
On POD 106 her BUN was 27, down from 31.
On this day, she spiked a temperature of 102.8.
Urine and blood were sent for analysis and culture.
Her Aztreonam was restarted and a CXR was ordered which was negative for infective process.
Her urine was found to be grossly costive for infection, with urine culture positive for yeast.
