Preprocedure, the patient developed atrial fibrillation, rapid to the 200s, with a blood pressure of 130/80, 02 saturations of 100% on 4 liters.
The patient was given Lopressor 2.5 mg IV times one and the heart rate dropped to the 150s.
Her blood pressure, respiratory rate, and 02 saturations were stable.
The patient was given Lopressor IV 5 mg times two and her heart rate went into the 100s to 120s and then went back up.
