She was taken for cardiac catheterization yesterday morning at OSH which reportedly showed stability of her known coronary artery disease; specifically, there was a 90% stenosis at the ostium of D1, 10-20% in-stent restenosis in the LAD, and a proximal 40% RCA stenosis which had negative pressure wire testing.
A head CT showed a 7 mm left-sided subdural hematoma along the cerebral convexity with 5 mm of midline shift at the septum pellucidum.
A head CT showed a 6 mm ??????subacute??????
Neurosurgery saw her and recommended serial examination, loading with phenytoin 1000 mg IV, and a followup CT in the morning.
She received IV morphine for complaints of a headache and became transiently hypotensive (SBPs in the 80s) with some worsening delirium; another head CT was unchanged compared to the one on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
Her repeat head CT showed no significant change in SDH, and her neuro exam had no focal deficits, so she was transferred to medicine floor for continued monitoring.

# Subdural hematoma:  Patient underwent 4 head CTs during this hospital stay, which showed stable SDH.
The last head CT done on [**2165-1-23**] when patient was restarted on aspirin showed improvement compared to the one obtained on [**1-19**].
Patient presented to OSH on [**2165-1-16**] with chest pain, and her cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**], at [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital, and she had a cardiac catheterization on [**1-18**] which showed stable coronary artery disease (90% stenosis at ostium of D1, 10-20% instent restenosis in LAD DES, and 40% stenosis in RCA).
EKG showed some dynamic changes, and trop-T increased from baseline 0.06 to 0.14 which then plateaued.
CK was flat.
Her blood pressure medications were later restarted, which include valsartan 160 mg [**Hospital1 **], isosorbide mononitrate 90 mg [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem XR 180mg qam, metoprolol (changed to toprol 100mg qpm).
# Chronic systolic CHF: OSH TTE from [**2163**] showed ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 35-40%) with severe tricuspid regurgitation and moderate mitral egurgitation.
Her outpatient nephrocaps and lanthanum were continued.
Her hct was stable during this hospital stay.
Wound care was consulted who recommended further workup to rule out osteomyelitis.
We obtained a foot x-ray was concerning for osteomyelitis, but in a different location than her diabetic ulcers.
The wound culture grew out MRSA, and patient has been getting vancomycin with hemodialysis session since [**2165-1-9**].
Patient's electrolytes were monitored and repleted prn.
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q 8H (Every 8 Hours).
The blood will most likely go away with time.
Your blood thinners including aspirin and plavix were initially held but aspirin was restarted after you developed chest pain.
We got an x-ray for your feet, which showed no obvious bone infection.
Please arrive at 2:00pm for a head CAT scan before you see him.
