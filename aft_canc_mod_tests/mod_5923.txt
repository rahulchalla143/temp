CT showed massive pericardial effusion, pericholecystic fluid, nonspecific RLQ stranding, normal appendix and right pleural effusion.
Hemodynamically stable, labs significant for alk phos 195, AST 79, ALT 51, Tbili 0.6, WBC 12.8, lipase 127.
ECG showing sinus tachycardia, relatively low voltage not meeting criteria, QT prolongation with QTc of 508.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] for further management of pericardial effusion.
On arrival here to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, vitals were T98.2 HR103 BP146/92 97% on RA.
Found to have pulsus of 30, bedside ECHO showed large pericardial effusion with some RA/RV compromise and evidence of tamponade.
On transfer, vitals were HR104, BP116/80, RR16 96% on RA.
On review of systems, she has a prior hx of stroke and DVT in the context of her viral meningitis in [**2137**].

Immunohistochemistry Report: Pericardial fluid involvement by kappa light chain restricted CD10-positive monotypic B-cell lymphoproliferative process.
Examination of cytospin reveals pleomorphic cells with vacuolated basophilic cytoplasm.
Correlation with cytogenetics and imaging studies recommended.
If a lymphadenopathy is seen, a biopsy will be helpful.
MICRO: blood cx P .
EKG ([**8-16**] 4:00): rate 100, NSR, NA/NI, low voltages, Q waves in III, no ST/T wave abn.
IMAGING: [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) **] RUQ U/S: stone impacted in neck, perichole fluid CT abd: massive pericardial effusion, perichol fluid, nonspecific RLQ stranding.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: TTE ([**8-16**]): Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed, see below) of [**2140-7-12**], there is now a large circumferential pericardial effusion with RV diastolic collapse.
Cardiac MRI [**8-21**]: 1.
A pericardiocentesis was performed and the fluid analysis was consistent with Burkitt's lymphoma.
# Pericardial effusion: A large pericardial effusion was found incidentally on an abdominal CT and there was evidence of tamponade physiology on echocardiogram and pulsus paradoxus.
Fluid analysis was suggestive of Burkitt's Lymphoma.
A subsequent lumbar puncture and bone marrow biopsy were negative for any involvement which made this a primary cardiac lymphoma.
A cardiac MRI showed a mass that was 3cm x 1cm on the lateral wall of the right atrium adjacent to the AV junction.
Tumor lysis/DIC labs were drawn every 8 hours and the patient was started on D5W with bicarb and allopurinol for prohylaxis.
