Her oncologist checked outpatient labs, which showed hematocrit 25, leukocytosis of 18, and glucose > 300.
Labs revealed elevated WBC count with left shift but no bandemia, stably low hct, mildly elevated creatinine to 1.1 and bicarbonate of 19.
Troponin was negative and BNP was > 4000.
ECG was initially thought to be sinus tachycardia, but repeat ECG was c/w atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction.
CXR x2 showed pulmonary edema, and CTA showed no PE but +small airways disease or atelectasis; note made of stale pancreatic mass and diverticulosis.
Bedside cardiac ultrasound showed a non-circumferential pericardial effusion, and "good squeeze."
On the floor, the patient reports feeling tired and weak, but denies any dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, fevers, chills, sweats, or abdominal pain.

Her echocardiogram showed mild LVH with EF>65% and no focal WMA and mildly elevated PASP.
#Atrial flutter: Patient presented with atrial flutter with ventricular rate at 150bpm.
On discharge patient had HR ~110 with stable blood pressure and without symptoms during ambulation with physical therapy.
#Locally advanced pancreatic cancer: Patient had an abdominal CT which showed stable pancreatic mass, but new fullness of the left adrenal potentially consistent with adrenal metastasis.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of an abnormal heart rhythm (atrial flutter) and a fast heart rate, which was likely the cause of your lightheadedness and palpitations.
You were admitted to the intensive care unit and given diuretic medications and your heart rate was reduced with a medication called Diltiazem.
Also, please monitor your weight daily and if you note an increase in your weight by more than 3 lbs over a [**1-25**] day period, please call your PCP as this may be a sign of increased fluid that can be treated with diuretics.
