Obstruction from pancreatic head mass is likely etiology of his jaundice with direct bilirubin in 18 -19 range now.
The patient underwent an endoscopic U/S and FNA of the pancreas, although biopsies were inconclusive.
His total bilirubin improved daily, although it remained elevated at the time of discharge.
Pathology from the IR-guided biopsy sample was pending at discharge, and the patient was given detailed instructions on how to call the pathology department (with the pathologist's verbal approval in advance) for the final result.
He was reportedly hemodynamically stable, but was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further observation.
Last INR 3 range.
The patient's INR was elevated during his stay, attributed to his liver synthetic dysfunction, but we did not feel this would be protective against further clotting.
[**State 2690**] but since he lost more than 140 lbs his blood pressures have been low to normotensive ranges and he has not been taking his usual lisinopril.
Recent weight loss may have impacted his need for Lantus 40 Units which he had taken at home.
