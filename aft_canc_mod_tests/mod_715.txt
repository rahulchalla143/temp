In the ED, initial vitals were T 99.6, BP 168/111, HR 94, RR 97% on 2L.
CXR unchanged with partial lingular collapse, L hilar mass and associated streaky opacity.
BP rose to a peak of 204/133.
Head CT revealed new vasogenic edema in b/l occipital lobes as well as new hypodensity in the bilateral cerebellum, thalami and corona radiata.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], her BP was 160-170s/100-120s.
- Core needle biopsy disclosed infiltrating poorly differentiated carcinoma; histologic grade III; with necrosis, probably lymphatic invasion, and possible DCIS - ER neg, PR neg, Her-2/neu neg - CT torso showed multiple enlarged left axillary nodes, several right lower lobe lung nodules - Bone scan showed no evidence of bony metastases - FNA of left cervical node demonstrated malignant cells, consistent with metastatic carcinoma (similar in morphology to those on her recent breast biopsy) - Commenced dose-dense Cytoxan/Adriamycin C1D1 [**2199-5-17**]; completed Cycle 4 [**2199-7-11**] - Taxol/Avastin started; last dose (C3D15) was [**2199-11-8**] - T8 transverse process biopsied [**2199-10-16**], demonstrated to have malignant carcinoma cells c/w primary  Additional Past Med Hx: 1. as above, recent admission for bronchitis 2. atrial tachycardia 3.
Pertinent Results: CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of [**2199-12-26**]: SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: Allowing for patient position and rotation, there is no change in partial collapse of the lingula and an associated streaky opacity emanating from the left hilum.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2199-12-26**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Recommend evaluation with gadolinium-enhanced MR to exclude intracranial metastasis when patient is able to co-operate with an exam.
EEG Study Date of [**2199-12-27**]: IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the slow disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2199-12-27**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Limited and incomplete study due to motion artifact.
A repeat study with gadolinium is recommended when feasible.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2199-12-28**]: IMPRESSION: Persistent lymphangitic carcinomatosis, unchanged.

MRI of brain on [**2199-12-27**] reveals inability to evaluate for metastatic disease in setting of imaging motion artifact.
Labetalol drip was started in hopes that controlling blood pressure to keep patient normotensive would allow for potential resolution of AMS if PRES was the culprit.
MRI tech revealed on [**2199-12-31**] that repeat MRI could not be re-attempted without intubation and sedation with anesthesia present as patient?????
Morphine drip was started and was titrated to patient comfort and RR of < 15.
