The patient's Port-A-Cath in the left chest was without any erythema.
She had a head CT which showed multiple brain metastases.
She had a follow-up MRI done on [**2107-9-27**] which showed residual brain metastases.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs showed a temperature of 98.8 (down from 101 in the Emergency Department), pulse of 108, blood pressure of 90/54, respiratory rate of 20.
Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat showed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The neurologic examination showed the patient to be alert and oriented times three.
Motor examination was notable for some weakness in the triceps and hamstrings at a level of [**3-31**].
Her reflexes were 2+ and symmetric throughout.
LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission showed a white blood cell count of 5.4, with a differential of 69% neutrophils, 20% bands, 6% lymphocytes, hematocrit of 26.2, platelets of 42.
Sodium of 135, potassium of 3.6, chloride of 98, bicarbonate of 27, blood urea nitrogen 26, creatinine 1.1, glucose 95.
PT 12.2, INR 1, PTT 26.3.
Urinalysis was positive only for minimal protein.
On microscopic examination there were no red blood cells, there were 0 to 2 white blood cells, occasional bacteria with 3 to 5 epithelial cells.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were obtained at the time of admission.
The blood cultures from the day prior to admission showed no growth to date.
A urine culture from the day prior to admission was negative.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray on admission showed the left subclavian central line to be in good position.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the O-MED Service for further evaluation and treatment of her fever.
Therefore, she was continued on Levaquin empirically, and her cultures were followed.
At that point, a room air saturation was obtained and was found to be in the low 80s.
A chest CT was obtained to look for possible infiltrates which could not be appreciated on chest x-ray, being most concerned with possible Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia given the patient's previous steroid treatment and recent tapering of her steroids.
The chest CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities which were consistent with possible opportunistic infection.
Her LDH was measured which also was elevated in the 700s.
An induced sputum was attempted but was unable to be obtained.
A repeat chest x-ray at that time showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates which were new compared with the three days prior.
An arterial blood gas done on 35% face mask showed a pH of 7.47, PCO2 of 29, and PO2 of 50.
A repeat chest x-ray was obtained three days after being transferred out to the floor, and she was found to have a 30% pneumothorax in the left lung likely secondary to underlying Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia as well as positive pressure ventilation in the unit.
By [**11-23**] the chest tube was without air leak.
Urine electrolytes were pending.
