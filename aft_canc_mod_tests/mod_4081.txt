Course: 66 year old woman with past medical history significant for COPD on home 02, OSA, TBM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, h.o PE, PNA who presents with hypoxia.
On admission, CXR and CT showed LLL collapse with occlusion of the L.mainstem bronchus.
Bronchoscopy was performed upon admission, which showed thick purulent material which was suctioned, severe tracheobronchomalacia.
Bronchial washing cultures showed now growth, however were felt limited by ongoing antibiotic therapy.
Respiratory viral antigen was significant for positive parainfluenza, however this was not felt to require therapy per pulmonary team.
Her HCT and oxygenation remained stable.
Given ongoing dyspnea, pt was taken for repeat bronchoscopy on [**2192-3-7**] which showed no evidence of pneumonia, minor clot at the site of tracheal stent, but no other obstruction.
at the time time of discharge, vital signs were 97.5  [**Numeric Identifier 52791**]  110  20  90%1L (with typical range of 1-3L, she was on 4L home O2 prior to admission) with finger stick 116.  she was otherwise continued on her regimen of theophyline, with increase in nebulizer therapy to Q3HRS per pulmonary recommendation.
given ongoing sensation of dyspnea, and persistent LLL collapse after initial bronchoscopy, IP service was consulted again, and repeat bronchoscopy on [**2192-3-7**] showed patent stent, without evidence of recurrence of pneumonia.
# history of pulmonary embolism: Patient is on coumadin at home in the setting of remote PE in [**2190**], with subsequent L UE DVT (though felt to be catheter related, pt and family elected to continue lifelong anticoagulation).
Pt was transitioned from coumadin to heparin for stent placement, then resumed coumadin, with INR= 4.2 on discharge, thus her daily regimen (decreased to 2mg qdaily), was held, and should be resumed at rehab once her INR is less than 3.0. .
# chronic renal insufficiency - baseline creatinine ~2, up to 2.6 in ICU, thus lasix was held, with improvement to 1.9 on [**3-3**], at which time she was restarted on lasix 80mg po qdaily, then titrated up to home reigmen 120mg po qam; 80mg po qpm.
On [**3-8**], her creatinine rose from 2.5->3.0, and her lasix was stopped.
She received ~2L of IVF on [**3-10**] and [**3-11**] with improvement in her creatinine to 2.0 on [**3-12**] and 1.6 on [**3-13**], day of discharge.
She should have strict daily weights, and should resume her usual regimen of lasix within 2-3 days, if her creatinine remains stable.
not clearly MAT based on ECG [**2192-3-6**].
HR remained 100-120, thus she was continued on her usual regimen as above.
HCT = 30 on admit -> 25 nadir, had single trace guaic positive brown stool [**3-1**], but otherwise, likely [**2-28**] poor nutrition, chronic disease, and iron, (on repletion), along with phlebotomy.
HCT down to 22 on [**3-11**], thus she recieved 1U PRBC with HCT 22->25, stable on [**3-13**].
Her HCT drop was felt also likely due to dilution in the setting of recieving 2L IVF on [**3-10**] and 2L IVF on [**3-1**].
Repeat CXR stable without evidence of pnuemonia.
CT ABD/PELVIS obtained given intermittent abdominal pain below, without acute process.
UA repeated which showed <10K yeast only.
UCx with 7K yeast colonies (imroved compared with prior UCx with >100K), so initially held off treating for yeast infection.
Given leukocytosis, repeat UA sent which showed yeast again, and elevated WBCs (691 on [**3-9**]), as well as persistant RBCs.
CT ABD/PELVIS obtained over [**2192-3-3**] given recurrent abdominal pain without acute pathology.
when pt lethargic during day, ABG and VBGs obtained showed stable PCO2 in 30s, however, pt encouraged to wear BiPaP during day when able.
# DM2 - pt covered with sliding scale insulin throughout her course, on [**3-11**], pt noted to have lower finger sticks (60-90), down to 50s overnight, pt asymptomatic, but eating poorly.
she was discharged home on a diabetic, cardiac diet, with instructions to remain well hydrated.
