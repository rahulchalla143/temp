Echo [**2123-10-9**]: Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-2-2**], left ventricular function has declined.
Right ventricular function is less vigorous.
Head CT [**10-12**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**10-16**]: Slight blurring appears to reflect respiratory motion.
Please note that the hazy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is new compared with the radiograph from [**2123-10-14**].
However, a similar appearance was present on a radiograph from [**2123-10-8**] and, at that time, a followup chest CT from [**2123-10-9**] showed some pericardial fluid and pericardial nodes in this location, which could contribute to the appearance of the right cardiophrenic angle on today's exam.
Cardiac Cath [**10-16**]: COMMENTS: 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP 18 mHg and mean PCWP 26 mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.35 l/min/m2.
PT: 13.4  PTT: 24.3  INR: 1.1    Brief Hospital Course: 79 year old woman with PMH s/f CHF, HTN, asthma and hypothyroid who presented with lethargy and hypoxemia, found to be hyponatremic to 118 down from 133 9 days prior to admission and a newly depressed EF of 15% from 45% in [**Month (only) 956**].
# DECOMPENSATED HEART FAILURE: Presented profoundly volume overloaded with substantial sacral edema as well as some physical examination and radiographic signs of pulmonary congestion.
# ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Admitted with creatinine of 1.6, likely due to decreased effective circulatory volume in the setting of CHF decompensation.
Her creatinine improved with diuresis and at discharge was 1.0. .
IV PPI was started and GI was consulted; their recommendation was for outpatient work-up since the patient's Hct remained stable and stool was brown 12 hours after the initial episode.
She will need another TSH in 2 months as an outpatient.
Hct remained stable this hospitalization and was as detailed above upon discharge.
Of note, she has received Epogen in the past for chronic anemia and may need additional doses if hct does not improve.

An echocardiogram showed that your heart function has worsened and a cardiac catheterization did not show any significant blockages in your coronary arteries.
Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 3733**] if weight increases more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
Your weight at the time of discharge is 133 pounds.
You had diarrhea and tests showed there was some blood in your stool.
You will need to have some blood labs checked on Friday, the VNA can do this at home and send results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1789**].
