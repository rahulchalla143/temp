A MRI done on [**2199-2-16**] demonstrated multiple small infarcts in the cerebellar hemisphere, left occipital, medial, left temporal lobe consistent with embolic events.
A transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated a large myxoma of the left atrium,  and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature is 97.3, heart rate 79, blood pressure 150/46.
Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Laboratory values include a white count of 3.7, hematocrit of 31, platelets of 182.
INR was 1.1.
BUN was 10, creatinine was 0.7.
Rest of her labs were unremarkable.
For imaging studies, she had a MRI done on [**2199-2-16**], which demonstrated multiple small acute and subacute infarcts in the cerebellar hemispheres, left occipital lobe, the left medial/left temporal lobe, the left thalamus, and the right midbrain consistent with shower embolic infarcts in the posterior circulation.
She also had a TEE on [**2199-2-18**] which demonstrated a 3 cm x 3 cm mass extending from the high intra-atrial septum of the left atrium.
She had underwent cardiac catheterization which demonstrated normal coronary arteries, normal cardiac index.
Echocardiogram done [**2199-2-19**] here demonstrated an EF of 60%, a mass in the left atrium, normal wall motion.
Chest x-ray had no congestion and no infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  After her workup by the neurology service, the stroke service, the cardiology team, and cardiac surgery team, patient was taken to the operating room on [**2199-2-21**], where she underwent an atrial myxoma removal and primary repair of intra-atrial septum.
Coumadin 2 mg per day and this will be adjusted according    to an INR level and discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 61120**].
Encourage ambulation and check INR on [**2-28**] and [**3-4**].
