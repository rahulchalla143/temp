Initial CXR was unimpressive, CTA was a suboptimal study but no large central PE.
Given obstructive pattern on LFTs, got non-con CT abd with no obvious obstruction, only a multinodular liver.

Widened mediastinum, which could in part be due to low lung volumes and AP technique.
Chest CTA [**2135-10-31**]: 1.
Suboptimal evaluation for pulmonary embolus, as above, although no large, central embolus identified.
CTA chest [**2135-11-2**] 1.
No evidence of central pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection, but limited study due to timing of contrast and motion.
Multiple pulmonary nodular opacities are incompletely evaluated on the background of ground-glass opacity and a followup chest CT after the acute pulmonary process resolves is recommended on an outpatient.
ECHO The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF 60-70%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT AB/PELV 1.
This is an unusual pattern for metastatic prostate cancer, and if appropriate, biopsy can be considered.
HEAD CT 1.
vancomycin trough [**11-6**]: 18.5  Brief Hospital Course: 57 yo M with metastatic prostate cancer (bone, liver mets) presents with episode of hypoxia and tachycardia, fever after starting estrogen-based therapy.
Patient underwent CTA which was non-diagnostic due to respiration artifact and poor contrast timing.
LENIS were negative for DVT.
Infection was also on the differential given high fever to 104 after presentation to the ED and CT chest showed upper lobe infiltrates.
Patient will need repeat chest CT once infection resolves ([**2-21**] weeks) to rule out underlying malignancy.
Heme-onc was consulted and recommended repeat CTA to rule out PE, since this diagnosis would be a contraindication for estramustine therapy.
Repeat CTA showed no PE.
Patient was placed on prophylactic dose Lovenox once INR normalized.
Patient had one positive blood cx, with MSSA, and all repeat blood cx were negative.
ANEMIA: Admission Hct 25.9 from prior 28.
Received 3 total units PRBC and Hct remained stable.
PSA was 223.
Tachycardia was attributed to underlying malignancy, since heart rate seemed to increase with increase in LFT's, indicative of worsening disease.
