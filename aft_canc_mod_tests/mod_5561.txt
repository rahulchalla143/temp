For this, he underwent an abdominal CT on [**2186-9-22**] to evaluate for possible small bowel obstruction or gastric outlet obstruction.
The CT at that time showed diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
The study was otherwise unremarkable.
His supine blood pressure was 159/79 with a heart rate of 70, seated he was 139/63 with a heart rate of 96 and standing he was 127/70 with a heart rate of 113.
His respiratory rate was 22.
His head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam was unremarkable with anicteric sclera, no conjunctival pallor.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes, rhonchi or rales.
His heart was mildly tachycardic, regular in rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
PERTINENT LABORATORIES:  Admission laboratories were significant for a white count of 8.6, hematocrit 40.3, platelets 195,000.
Sodium 135, potassium 4.2, chloride 102, bicarbonate 21, BUN 17, creatinine 1.1, glucose 231.
His PT was 13.5 with an INR of 1.2, PTT 27.9.
LFTs were:  ALT 20, AST 45, alkaline phosphatase 82, bilirubin 0.3.
His urinalysis was negative.
His electrocardiogram indicated normal sinus rhythm, axis of approximately 0 degrees with first degree AV conduction delay and an occasional premature ventricular contraction.
Compared with prior study of [**2184-1-13**], there were no new changes.
His hematocrit dropped from the admission hematocrit of 40.3 to a nadir of 27.2.
Colonoscopy was performed indicating diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, and ascending colon with a polyp in the colon.
The patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit stabilized at approximately 33.
FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2186-10-2**] and with Gastrointestinal with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 95912**] [**Name (STitle) **] on [**10-10**] for further evaluation of his colon polyp.
