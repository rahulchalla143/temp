In the clinic, she was given 1000mL Normal Saline and directly admitted to the floor (11R) prior to her labs returning.
During transport, a sodium of 113 and K 5.9 returned and ICU transfer was initiated prior to the patient arriving on the floor.
On [**2110-11-27**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] performed an open pancreatic biopsy w/ Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, open cholecystectomy, & gastrojejunostomy.
Pathology confirmed the presence of well-differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
She had CT torso [**2112-7-27**] notable for mild progression of multiple pulmonary nodules present since [**12/2111**], concerning for metastatic disease, along with 2 liver lesions also concerning for metastatic disease.
She then underwent Liver MRI [**2112-8-8**], and the lesions corresponded to areas of fatty infiltration.
She had repeat CT torso [**2112-10-28**] and this showed pulmonary nodules had increased slightly in size.
- Portal vein thrombosis - Psoriasis - Severe osteoporosis - Hip fracture after a fall in [**2109-3-10**].

She received intravenous fluid boluses and started on continuous infusion of normal saline for low blood pressure and low urine output.
Despite this, her blood pressure continued to fall and she required increasing doses of Levophed to maintain perfusion.
When her blood pressure continued to fall, vasopressin was added.
An echocardiogram was done that showed global systolic dysfunction consistent with toxic/metabolic insult.
Blood cultures from admission came back positive for gram positive cocci in pairs and chains on the first hospital day.
When the patient's blood pressure and oxygen saturations continued to decline, despite aggressive volume resuscitation, antibiotics, and non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, a discussion was held with family members.
