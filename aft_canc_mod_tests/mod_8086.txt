Lower Extremity Doppler [**2182-9-11**] No evidence of deep venous thrombosis within the bilateral lower extremities.
Echo [**2182-9-12**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Left ventricular systolic function is probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be excluded.
Mediastinal lymph node biopsy [**2182-9-13**] Lymph node, mediastinal (A-B): Classical Hodgkin lymphoma, see note.
The background reactive lymphoid infiltrate consists predominantly of small T-cells which are CD3 positive and TdT negative, along with scattered CD20 and PAX-5 positive B-cells.
Reticulin stain highlights fibrous tissue, separating the lymphoid tissue into vague nodules.
Immunophenotyping [**2182-9-13**] INTERPRETATION Immunophenotypic findings show a B cell population.
Bone marrow biopsy [**2182-9-14**] SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS:   Fibrotic bone marrow with involvement by Hodgkin lymphoma, see note.
CXR [**2182-9-16**] The left PICC line lies in the mid SVC.

Blood pressure improved with 500 cc IVF given by EMS.
Baseline BP 115-125.
Patient was fluid resuscitated and blood pressure improved.
Patient endorsed no respiratory symptoms and chest x-[**Month/Day/Year **] showed no acute processes.
Blood cultures were negative.
He had an inguinal biopsy the week prior to which showed benign lymph node with fatty replacement.
CT showing extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.
Thoracic surgery was consulted for mediastinal biopsy, which was performed [**2182-9-13**].
Biopsy consistent with Hodgkin lymphoma, as was bone marrow biopsy done [**9-14**].
An ultrasound showed a partially occlusive thrombus along the right PICC throughout the entirety of the right basilic vein, extending into the right axillary and likely right subclavian veins.
# Pancytopenia:  WBC 0.9, HCT 23.8 and PLT 58 on presentation secondary to underlying hematological malignancy.
He also received 3 bags of platelets (1 prior to biopsy [**9-12**], 2 with port placement).
Seems to have some Parkinsonian features, workup not done during this hospitalization.
You underwent a lymph node biopsy by the thoracic surgeons, and the biopsy results showed a new diagnosis of Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
