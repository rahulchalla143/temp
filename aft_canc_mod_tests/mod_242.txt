A 12-lead electrocardiogram was done at that time, but intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram showed inferior hypokinesis.
She was subsequently admitted to the CCU for further monitoring care currently.
CT appearance of the lesions suggested T4 primary, but no evidence of mediastinal lymph nodes spread or peripheral metastases.
Head CT was done previous to admission and spinal MRI was also done, both were negative.
Cervical mediastinoscopy was done on [**2166-5-17**] and frozen section analysis demonstrated it was poorly differentiated nonsmall cell lung cancer, mast cell was not adherent to the trachea or left main stem bronchus at that level.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature is 96, heart rate 62, blood pressure 123/69, respiratory rate of 10, and O2 saturation is 100%.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes.
Abdominal examination showed soft, nontender, nondistended.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Patient's white count is 6.1, hematocrit 36.4, and platelets of 191.
Chemistries:  149, 3.9, 111, 25, 11.7, 92, ALT of 14, AST of 12, alkaline phosphatase 64, T bilirubin 0.3, CK 54.
Albumin 3.7, calcium 8.8, magnesium 1.9, phosphorus 4.8.
EKG on admission showed sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, no left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria, LAA 0.3 mm, ST elevations in II, III, and aVF, T-wave inversions V1, V2, and aVL.
Chest x-ray on [**2166-10-1**] showed interval decrease in size of left aortopulmonary window mass with residual irregular opacity remaining.
Patient had cardiac catheterization on admission.
Physical Therapy continued to see her throughout her course, and patient's saturation was 97% on 2 liters on postoperative day four.
