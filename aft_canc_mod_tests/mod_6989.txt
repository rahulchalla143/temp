Per medical records the patient's blood pressure was 210 systolic pre-operatively and he received hydralazine, with a decrease in systolic blood pressures to 150-160.
Post-procedure his blood pressure increased again to 200/95 and his EKG was concerning for ventricular bigeminy.
He was treated with esmolol 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg IV respectively, followed by labetolol 10 mg IV and lidocaine 100 mg IV with improvement in his blood pressure and ventricular ectopy.
He was also noticed to have increased shortness of breath and oxygen requirement and had a CXR which showed pulmonary edema.
He underwent a STAT head CT which was negative for hemorrhage.
CTA was showed a likely superior division MCA embolic stroke.
His NIH Stroke Score was 23 upon arrival of the stroke team.

[**2162-8-27**] Cardiac Echo (TTE) - LA is mildly dilated.
LVEF ~ 45%.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-10-11**], the degree of pulmonary hypertension detected has increased.
Regional LV systolic dysfunction is more prominent than on the prior study (not reported on prior study but present).
[**2162-8-27**] CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE PORT - FINDINGS: Some mild wall thickening involving the right ICA and THE ECA.
The peak systolic velocities on the right are 109, 112 ,9, 53 and 100 cm/sec for the proximal, mid and distal ICA and CCA and ECA respectively.
[**2162-8-26**] CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS - FINDINGS: There is significant calcification of the bilateral carotid arteries in their cavernous portions.
No evidence for ischemia; however, MRI or dedicated non-contrast CT of the head would be more sensitive for ischemia.
EKG: === [**8-28**] EKG - Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing  of [**2162-8-26**] the rate and rhythm have changed.

As per neurology goal blood pressure initially was 180-200s.
Used combination of propofol for sedation and blood pressure control to titrate to goal SBP < 200 and > 160.
Repeat CT scan of the head demonstrated large area of infarct in territory of MCA.
Continued to manage blood pressure with goal of 160-180s 72 hours post-stroke and currently with goals 140-160s.
The remaining LV segmetns are hyperdynamic .
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
MRI of the head could not be completed secondary to foreign objects in patient's head.
Troponins were mildly elevated on admission to 0.10 and subsequently trended down.
CK and CK-MB were flat.
On admission, saturating well on 3L NC but exam concerning for harsh bilateral rales and tachypnea.
Hypertension:  Patient's blood pressures appear to have ranged form 140s to 160s as an outpatient.
pre and post-operatively patient BP in 200s systolic.
He was then transitioned to metropolol and lisinopril with good blood pressure control.
Patient was monitored on telemetry.
