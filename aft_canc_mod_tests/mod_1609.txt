Unable to cooperate with exam for asterixes.
CBD 2mm.
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**2113-10-27**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Her hypotension was stabilized with IVF, 4L at admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], however volume status was constantly difficult due to poor UOP and tachycardia with peripheral anasarca suggesting poor intravascular volume.
This intervention helped urine output but did not have an effect on her persistent tachycardia.
She was also temporarily given Vanc/Zosyn due to concern for sepsis as a possible contributor but she had no other signs of infection other than hypotension and when her cultures were negative, all antibiotics were discontinued.
A head CT was considered to evaluate for metastatic disease, however it was felt that patient's renal function was not adequate for contrast administration and that this was not an acute need to determine medical management.
DIC labs were normal.
