Foley at that time with 300cc urine in bladder, but exam showed normal normal rectal tone and no saddle anesthesia.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for MRI to r/o cord compression and for further evaluation of weakness.
Rpt imaging was significant for extensive metastatic lesions in the bone and liver.

Increased size of ventricles compared to the previous MRI with increasing temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] size and periventricular edema indicative of communicating hydrocephalus.
Findings were conveyed to the physician taking care of the patient at the time of interpretation of the study .
MRI Spine [**2175-7-14**]: -Multiple Thoracic and lumbar vertebral mets, no cord compression.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2175-7-14**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2175-7-16**] 11:45 AM FINDINGS: Compared to the recent CT examination, there has been interval placement of a ventricular catheter via a right-fronto-parietal approach.
Status post new ventricular catheter from a right-fronto-parietal approach compared to CT from 2 days prior.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2175-7-19**] 4:21 PM NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: Again noted is a ventricular catheter entering via right frontal approach with its tip abutting the septum pellucidum, unchanged.
CEREBROSPINAL FLUID CYTOLOGIC EXAM [**2175-7-15**] - Large atypical cells with round nuclei, variably present nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm.
Immunostains (S07-[**Numeric Identifier 59836**]) were technically inadequate.
MRI of spine revealed multiple spinal metastasis without evidence for cord compression, pathologic fractures of T12, L3.
Head MR revealed new communicating hydrocephalus, diffuse leptomenigeal disease.
Head CT revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular collection.
His mental status steadily improved with interval CT scan without evidence for further hemorrhage.
4) low voltage on ECG- An echo was obtained to rule out malignant effusion, it revealed LVEF 70%, 1+AR, trivial MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] effusion.
