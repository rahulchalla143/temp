He was taken to OSH where their work-up revealed a sizable IPH.

Preoperatively pt had CTA imaging to evaluate for an aneurysmal source for the bleed.
Showed Post operative CT scan showed Iiterval worsening of right frontal parenchymal hemorrhage and mass effect with now 17 mm left [**Hospital1 **] subfalcine herniation, compared to prior comparative measurement of 14 mm.
The preliminary review of the CTA portion of the study, demonstrates a 4 mm focal ectatic segment just proximal to the basilar bifurcation into PCA (3:252), The right PCA is relatively [**Name2 (NI) 79305**] and a ruptures circle of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 53283**] or AVM as a precipitant of fall could not be excluded.
Following surgical evacuation CT imaging was completed on [**2144-7-20**] which revealed new bleed extending beneath the surgical bed with worse vasogenic edema.
Physical exam remains consistent with fixed pupils.
