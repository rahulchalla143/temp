An underlying fistula, therefore, cannot be entirely excluded.
A compression fracture of L1 with significant vertebral body height loss is also noted.
A lumbar puncture was performed due to confusion (near his baseline) and a patechial rash on his shins, though it was negative for meningitis.
A CT torso was done in the setting of hypotension to evaluate a known aortic dissection, though this was stable.
He briefly required pressor support with aggressive fluids with normalization of his blood pressure.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Delerium is the most likely etiology, in this setting sepsis is the most likely etiology, though the patient is quite constipated on CT scan, and this could also precipitate delerium.
# BPH: - hold tamsulosin in the setting of hypotension  # CAD:  On aspirin and plavix  # Dementia: - continue memantine for now .
We did a CT scan which showed a mass in your colon.
You had a sigmoidoscopy to evaluate it and biopsies were taken.
The biopsies showed evidence of adenocarcinoma.
The mass showed evidence obstruction of bowel, local invasion into the bladder, and fistulization.
You are scheduled to have another imaging test of this vessel in 5 weeks.
