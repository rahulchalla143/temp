However, this patient does have a significant coronary artery disease history, so his main issue preoperatively was evaluation and cardiac clearance.
Echocardiograms in the past revealed an ejection fraction of 50% with an inferior posterior wall motion abnormality.
He had a Holter monitor examination which revealed ventricular ectopy, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, episodes of AV nodal Wenckebach for which he underwent an exercise echocardiogram which demonstrated that the patient could only exercise for two minutes and again had premature ventricular contractions, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and sinus bradycardia with Wenckebach.
Given all of this, it was felt that the patient had a sick sinus syndrome and AV nodal disease with significant chronotropic incompetence, for which he underwent Electrophysiology evaluation for pacemaker placement.
q.d., Mevacor, Prevacid, aspirin, glyburide, probenecid, and folate.
There was 100 cc of estimated blood loss, 1 liter of crystalloid was given intraoperatively.
He was also hypertensive requiring a nitroglycerin drip for control of his blood pressure.
Immediately postoperatively, he was on a nitroglycerin drip for control of his blood pressure.
He was transfused while in the Intensive Care Unit to maintain hematocrit in the 30 range.
He received a Cardiology consultation while in the Intensive Care Unit for assistance of evaluation of his cardiac status.
Cardiology recommendations were for beta blockers and conversion to nitroglycerin paste from nitroglycerin, as well as the addition of aspirin and Accupril for control of his blood pressure.
Recommendations were also to maintain hematocrit above 30 and for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement in the future.
