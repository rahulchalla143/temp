NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT ([**5-11**]): A ventriculoperitoneal shunt enters via the right frontal approach and crosses the midline terminating in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
EEG ([**5-12**]): ROUTINE SAMPLING: Showed a slow and disorganized pattern in the theta and delta range for the beginning of this recording with no clear lateralized features and with bursts of sharp waves in a generalized distribution with bifrontal predominance and sometimes also more focal sharp waves in the right frontal area.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.with occasional PVCs.
ECHO TTE ([**5-12**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to some dyssynchrony as well as hypokinesis of the basal septum.
ECHO TEE ([**5-18**]): No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Transgastric views not obtained given ongoing GI bleeding.
Moderate confluent periventricular white matter high-signal intensity on FLAIR imaging is most consistent with moderate chronic microvascular infarction.
EEG ([**5-15**]): ROUTINE SAMPLING: Showed a slow and disorganized background in the delta and theta range most of the time alternating with bursts of rapid suppression of the background lasting for one to three seconds.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with frequent  premature beats.
Portable CXR ([**5-16**]): PFI: New large left-sided pneumothorax and collapse of the left lung.
The left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, as well as one of the two brachial veins and the proximal left cephalic and basilic veins demonstrate occlusive thrombus with no evidence of flow.
CT TORSO [**2124-5-19**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Portable CXR: ([**2124-5-26**])FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-25**], the endotracheal tube has been removed and tracheostomy tube is in place.

A head CT was done that showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or ischemia.
Concern was for hypoxic injury given prior PEA arrest therefore MRI was done which showed no evidence of ischemia.
MRI did show slit-like ventricles and findings suggestive of chronic over-shunting therefore Neurosurgery was consulted however did not feel that intervention was warranted.
Her ventilator settings are as follows: Pressure support PSV: 15, PEEP: 5, FiO2: 40%, pulling Vt: 250-330, breathing at a rate of 20 (19-27), O2sat: 100%.
# Pneumothorax: On hospital day #5, a portable chest X-ray was performed to evaluate for pulmonary infiltrate due to low grade temperature and rising leukocytosis.
Pneumothorax stabilized radiographically and pigtail catheter was removed on [**5-23**] with stable chest X-rays after removal.
# UGIB: NGT placed at OSH was draining BRB with hct drop 36--> 27.
She underwent endoscopy upon arrival with identification of large adherent clot in the fundus below the GE junction.
Had melena subsequent to procedure, but no epsiodes of hematemesis and hematocrit remained stable.
A repeat endoscopy on [**5-18**] showed residual clot that had organized.
On [**5-24**] she underwent repeat EGD which showed NO residual clot.
However, she subsequently underwent trans-esophageal echocardiography which revealed that the patient actually has a MECHANICAL mitral valve therefore anti-coagulation was restarted.
Her INR goal will be 2.5-3.5 given her mechanical valve.
# LUE and Iliac DVT:  The patient was noted to have LUE swelling on exam and subsequent LENI revealed a LUE DVT.
She was incidentally noted to have a iliac DVT on abdominal CT scan.
The patient has been anticoagulated for this as well as for her mechanical valve.
She has been pan-cultured mulitple times during this admission and never had positive blood, sputum, stool or urine cultures at [**Hospital1 18**].
(Her urine cultures have only grown yeast.)
CT abdomen was negative for other occult source of infection.
She will need weekly labs while on vancomycin including: CBC, chem 10, LFTs, and Vancomycin level.
# Diabetes Mellitus, Type II: The patient is on a insulin sliding scale with long acting insulin and her fingersticks have been well controlled, ranging 100-176 in the past 24hrs.
Her blood sugar will need to be monitored more closely as tube feeds are intiated and her insulin regimen should be adjusted PRN.

She underwent endoscopy which she bleeding in the stomach which later stabilized.
She had extensive evaluation by neurology and has a very poor prognosis for neurologic recovery.
