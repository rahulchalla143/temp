15 mm right lower lobe nodular opacity which is new or increased since [**2160-7-27**] in an area previously obscured by right pleural effusion; given size, follow-up options include repeat chest CT within three months or PET-CT.
[**2160-12-2**] CT CHEST IMPRESSION:  As compared to the previous examination from [**2160-11-10**], there is evidence of diffuse fibrotic lung parenchymal pattern with bronchiectasis and spectral distortion as main morphological components.
Comparison is made with the next preceding AP single view portable chest examination of [**2160-11-17**].
[**2160-11-17**] CHEST X-RAY: Compared to radiograph of [**2160-11-14**], no significant interval change.
[**2160-11-10**] CT Chest, Abdomen & Pelvis IMPRESSION: There is no jejunal mass identified.
[**2160-10-30**] CT Abdomen & Pelvis IMPRESSION: 1.
Interval worsening of the right-sided pleural effusion (2;8) compared to the prior CT from [**2160-10-13**].
[**2160-10-30**] ECHO The IVC is collapsed suggesting underfilling of the right heart.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Although the tip of the nasogastric tube is not seen on the current study but does course below the diaphragm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2160-10-13**] heart rate has significantly increased.
[**2160-10-22**] ECHO The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Left ventricular systolic function is probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be excluded.
[**2160-10-17**] US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE OR (prelim) Two son[**Name (NI) 493**] grayscale still images were obtained during real-time evaluation of underlying perihepatic ascites for possible paracentesis prior to liver biopsy.
[**2160-10-17**] Tissue: LIVER CORE BIOPSY (1 JAR).
CD3 highlights a majority of small lymphocytes, which appropriately co-express CD5 and BCL2.
CD20 and PAX-5 highlight few scattered large B lymphocytes, which do not form aggregates.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6**] [**Last Name (un) **] RNA in situ hybridization study shows rare scattered positive nuclei within the lymphoid aggregates.
As in previous biopsies the findings in the current biopsy are felt to represent an EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disorder in the setting of persistent EBV viremia and in the background of an IgA deficiency/CVID phenotype.
[**2160-10-13**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Slight worsening of pulmonary edema compared to the prior radiograph from 3 days previous.
Overall morphology is very similar to the torso CT examination performed earlier on the same day.
[**2160-10-13**] CT torso: 1.
Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right, unchanged from the prior examination, and small on the left, increase in size from most recent CT chest examination of [**2160-10-9**].
On a background of fibrosis, there is increased septal thickening which is worse compared to the prior exam and likely represents mild pulmonary edema.
[**2160-10-13**] ECG Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2160-8-6**] low voltage is now present.
[**2160-10-13**] Tissue: immunophenotyping - pleural RESULTS: Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield.
A limited panel is performed to determine B-cell clonality.
B cells are scant in number precluding evaluation of clonality (2% of lymphoid gated events, <1% of total gated events).
INTERPRETATION: Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
[**2160-10-12**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or vascular territorial infarct.

More severe forms of liver disease including hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded.
Color and spectral Doppler evaluation of the liver demonstrates normal flow within the hepatic artery, hepatic veins, and portal veins.

The portable chest examination cannot be expected to give more detailed differential diagnostic results.

Found to have +CMV titer >17,000, and started on ganciclovir.
# Hypoxemia / respiratory distress: A CT of the chest demonstrated large pleural effusion at the time of admission.
Pulmonary drained 1.2L of bloody fluid from the chest and placed a chest tube x2 days.
Initial ABG was 7.43/36/49 on 5L NC.
Her acute decompensation was thought to be due to reaccumulation of known R pleural effusion since repeat CT showed no change in effusion size compared to the [**10-9**] study which was done prior to drainage of 1L pleural fluid via thoracentesis.
Bronchoscopy was performed, which showed very small amount of secretions and no significant amount of blood.
A bronchial lavage was sent for culture and cytology.
BL was negative for acid fast, fungal, and PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] spiked a T of 101 and urine/blood cultures were sent.
She was restarted on vanc and [**Last Name (un) 2830**], but abx were discontinued after 48 hours of blood cultures with no growth.
Her urine culture grew yeast and VRE.
Vancomycin and cefepime were started for presumed PNA, although CXR and CT chest showed no evidence of new PNA.
Sputum cxs were contaminated w/ oral flora.
Her persistent hypoxemia is due to persistent fluid overload, with interstitial infiltrates and persistent large pleural effusion.
Beta glucan was positive but fungal cultures negative.
CT head on [**10-12**] showed no acute intracranial process.
A bedside LP was attempted after the patient returned from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with Neuro Onc -- however it was unsuccessful.
A CMV titer was found to be positive to 17,600 on [**2160-10-18**] and the patient was started on ganciclovir.
CMV and EBV levels significantly trended down and were undetectable or negative prior to discharge.
TSH was normal, B12 high, and RPR non-reactive.
# Abdominal ileus: Abdominal x-ray [**11-2**] showed distended bowel loops.
Her stool output and pain improved.
Bone marrow bx from [**8-9**] showed increased macrophages with ingestion of cells and debris, as well as an increased cytotoxic T cell infiltrate with concurrent markedly elevated ferritin level.
She underwent a repeat speech & swallow evaluation, which revealed left vocal cord hypokinesis.
Her voice symptoms improved, and she was able to swallow and manage her own secretions.
# Transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia: Pt noted to have persistent transaminitis, direct bilirubinemia and elevated alk phos and LDH since admission.
RUQ u/s [**10-9**] showed borderline echogenic liver suggestive of fatty infiltration, no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation, normal flow within the hepatic artery, hepatic veins, and portal veins.
MRI abd [**10-11**] showed heterogenous signal within the liver parenchyma concerning for infiltrative process or infection.
CT abd/pelvis [**10-13**] showed generalized anasarca and simple-appearing ascites as well as mild thickening of the wall of the ascending colon.
Liver biopsy was reviewed and felt to be immune infiltrate with T cell predominance.
Surveillance testing negative for C. diff.
# Hx Hogkins disease: Extensive workup including multiple LN biopsies and marrow showed no evidence of recurrent disease last admission on [**2160-10-13**].
CT abdomen on [**10-30**] with possible recurrence, surgery was been consulted for biopsy, but would have to be a laparotomy which they do not recommend at this time.
A repeat CT showed stability of lesions, so a biopsy was not pursued.
# Abdominal lymphadenopathy: 2 mesenteric soft tissue masses adjacent to jejunum- 3.2 x 3.0 cm and 3.7 x 2.6 cm not present on prior scan.
However, EBV VL trended down and patient has been receiving high dose steroids.
Per surgery, biopsy requires laparotomy, which they do not recommend at this time.
Instead, they recommend a repeat CT abdomen at a later date to assess for interval change.
Repeat CT showed stability of the lesions, so a surgical biopsy was not pursued.
- need transvaginal ultrasound and possible endometrial biopsy in the future, will defer to outpatient workup for now.
We supported her with blood transfusions on as needed basis.
Her reticulocyte index was 1.2, suggestive of inadequate bone marrow response to level of anemia.
