On lifting the head of his bed, the patient went pale and dropped his SBP into the 50's, with concomitant loss of consciousness.
Though no cardiac rhythm or oxygen saturation could be obtained as his leads had been removed for transport, the patient was resuscitated with ambu bag and returned to consciousness without any focal neurological deficits within one minute.
EKG obtained shortly after this time showed no acute changes from preop baseline, and the patient ruled out by cardiac enzymes.
