Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 62 year old male with a pmh of Multiple Myeloma with multiple therapies and auto and allo tx s/p dli x4 most recently in [**Month (only) 216**], now with GVHD of the liver and skin.
His bilirubin continued to rise and was 12.5 on admission.
We started him on solumedrol 30mg IV BID, cylosporine 50mg [**Hospital1 **], and continued him on his MMF and budesonide.
A RUQ ultrasound was done and showed no evidence of thrombosis or obstruction.
He was started on 100mg IV BID and reached a peak level of 388 on [**2162-11-24**].
His transaminases began to downtrend [**11-18**], and initially thought the bilirubin would lag for 4-5 days.
He was found to have a pneumonia on chest x-ray (see below).
His CSA was decreased and eventually stopped on [**2162-11-27**] and levels were followed.
He had an LP done on [**11-28**] which had elevated protein, but no white or red cells.
Viral PCRs were sent and were unremarkable.
# Pneumonia: On [**11-22**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 28316**] a fever, and a chest x-ray revealed a new left lower mid lung field pneumonia.
A CT scan was done and showed a superior left lower lobe pneumonia.
His galactomanan came back negative from his BAL, and his beta-glucan could not be interpreted because of his bilirubin level.
He had a repeat chest CT scan on [**11-26**] because of his change in mental status, and it showed an interval increase in size of his left lower lobe pneumonia.
He maintained oxygen saturations of greater than 95% on RA.
His fever curve decreased and he defervesced (although he remained on high levels of immunosuppression).
On [**11-30**] he went into a-fib with RVR, and a chest x-ray was checked to evaluate for fluid overload as possible cause of his RVR.
The chest x-ray showed a worsening of his pneumonia.
His initial bronchoscopy had abnormal plasma cells reported.
An EKG was checked and he was in a-fib with RVR at 139 BPMs.
A lactate was checked and found to be 2.6.
His BP remained 110-130/60-75.
# Multiple Myeloma: Status post DLI #4.
His imuunoglobulin levels were all low, and his disease was thought to have been under good control.
Afib became rate controlled on this regimen with HR <100 consistently.
Bronchoscopy was completed which showed gram negative rods for which tobramycin (for double negative coverage) and ciprofloxacin (atypical coverage) were added to his vancomycin and meropenum.
His beta 2 microglobulin levels were high, but no plasma cells were seen on BAL.
