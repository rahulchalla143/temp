---- Date: [**2173-11-26**] Signed by [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 57715**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15102**], CCC-SLP on [**2173-11-26**] Affiliation: [**Hospital1 18**]   Title: REPEAT BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION:  HISTORY: Returned today to reattempt the consult for this [**Age over 90 **] year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2173-11-22**] for ARF and rapid ventricular rate a-fib, dehydration and pna.
EVALUATION: The examination was performed while the patient was seated upright in the chair.
HYPERVENTILATION: Was not performed due to the patient's clinical condition.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Was not performed because the study was a portable study.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Shows a wide complex rhythm with a rate of 90 bpm and frequent ectopy.
This finding suggests subcortical dysfunction in the these regions and it is a relatively non-specific finding with regard to an evaluation for  seizures.
A second cardioversion was performed on [**2173-11-16**].
His FENa was less than 1; therefore, his ARF was thought to be pre-renal.
His BUN and creatinine did not significantly respond to the IV fluids.
He was diuresed with a nesirite drip and added IV lasix to reach a goal fluid balance of net negative 1L each day.
His CHF improved over the course of his hospital stay.
Head CT documented stable, old left lentiform nucleus lacunar infarction, no new acute stroke, and no further change in a chronic bifrontal subdural hematoma that had previously demonstrated small interval increase.
Portable EEG documented a mildly abnormal EEG likely suggestive of subcortical dysfunction in the right fronto-central and deep midline subcortical regions but was non-specific for an evaluation of seizure.
The patient had no signs or symptoms of meningismus and an LP was not thought to be of clinical utility.
Urine culture was only positive for the presence of <10,000 organsims likely representing colonization from prolonged Foley catheter placement.
He ruled out with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes on admission.
Although an infiltrate was not present on the initial chest x-ray, he was treated with a 10 day course of levofloxacin for a probable pneumonia.
A urine culture grew between 10,000 and 100,000 enterococcus that was sensitive to ampicillin and vancomycin but resistent to levofloxacin.
He was started on a low dose of glucotrol XL and will require blood sugar monitoring during the week following discharge to avoid any hypoglycemia.
Anemia: The patient was seen to have an equivocally positive guiaic study of the stool but subsequent guiaic testing was negative.
KUB was ordered secondary to abdominal distention, which later improved on an increased bowel regimen.
His hematocrit stabilized thereafter.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
He has follow-up appointments scheduled and will, however require glucose monitoring in the week following discharge to monitor for hypoglycemia following institution of glucotorl XL as above.
Please monitor your blood sugars frequently within the first week of discharge as you were recently started on an oral drug to lower your blood sugars (glucotrol XL 2.5mg po daily).
