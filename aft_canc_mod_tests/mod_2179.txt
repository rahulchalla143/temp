Pain was well controlled with an epidural.
On POD 2 Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have an hematocrit drop of approximately 10 points from the intraoperative to the postoperative state.
However, due to the hematocrit drop and the chest x-ray finding, it was not possible to rule out a possible intrapleural bleed.
A chest CT scan was obtained and there was a fair amount of lung collapse on that CT scan, but it was not entirely possible to distinguish between what was consolidated or collapsed lung, and what possibly was pleural effusion or hemothorax.
His chest tube was taken out on [**8-29**] and his bulb was put to suction.
