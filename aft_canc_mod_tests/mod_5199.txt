MRI of the brain is recommended for further evaluation.
MRI [**2-2**]: There are multiple areas of enhancement identified in the brain including two lesions in the left frontal lobe, one in the medial right frontal lobe and one in the inferior right frontal lobe.
MRA head/neck [**2-2**]: normal  CT torso: 1.
CT showed hypodensities in the right cerebellar and right occipital lobe, with some crowding of fourth ventricle.
Repeat CT revealed slight hemorrhagic transformation of cerebellar portion, with stable mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
Further evaluation of the CT and imaging by MRI revealed the hypodensities to be more consistent with multiple masses instead of stroke, consistent with metastatic disease.
CT of the torso revealed right pulmonary nodules and hilar and mediastinal necrotic lymphadenopathy concerning for cancer.
Pathology from the biopsy was pending at discharge and will be followed by the neuro-oncologists.
