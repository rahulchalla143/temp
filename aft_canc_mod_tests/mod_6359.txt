He had a head MRI on [**2158-7-11**] that showed a large mass in the right cerebellopontine angle with compression of the fourth ventricle.
he also had a chest X-ray on [**2158-7-12**] that showed a right retrocardiac opacity.
His pulse is about 63.
Blood pressure is 120/68.
Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythms.
His muscle strengths are [**5-9**] at all muscle groups.
His reflexes are 2- bilaterally.
Sensory examination is intact to pinch in all 4 extremities.
See [**Hospital 1644**] hospital course for exam at discharge.

On gradient echo sequences, there are foci of "blooming" susceptibility artifact (6:8) suggestive of possible foci of hemorrhage as no areas of discrete calcifications were seen on prior CT examination.
Given the imaging characteristics, this very likely represents cystic degeneration within a large vestibular schwannoma.
CT/CTA Head [**2158-7-17**]: CT Head: There is a 4.7 x 3.0 cm mixed cystic and solid heterogeneously enhancing right CPA angle mass extending into the right IAC causing remodeling and enlargement of the porus acusticus.
MRI/MRV Head [**2158-7-20**]: BRAIN MRI: There is a large right cerebellopontine angle partially cystic and partially solid mass identified which is unchanged in appearance compared to the prior MRI of [**2158-7-11**] and CT of [**2158-7-12**].
IMPRESSION: Preoperative study demonstrates a large cerebellopontine angle schwannoma measuring approximately 4 cm in size in the transverse and superior inferior dimensions and approximately 4.5 cm in the anterior-posterior dimension.
MRV OF THE HEAD: Head MRV demonstrates normal flow in the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses as well as in the deep venous system.
Post-op MRI [**2158-7-21**]: FINDINGS: The patient is status post right occipital craniectomy with metallic mesh device in place at the site of craniectomy.
The cerebellum remains leftward deviated as does the brainstem and there is a persistent low lying right cerebellar tonsil (2:4) unchanged from preoperative examination.
There is prominence of the third ventricle, temporal horns and lateral ventricles, which appear stable to minimally increased compared to the preoperative MRI examination demonstrating persistent hydrocephalus.
Persistent enlargement of the temporal horns, third ventricle, and lateral ventricles, which appears stable to minimally increase and is representative of persistent hydrocephalus.
CT Head [**2158-7-24**]: FINDINGS: There is a right occipital craniotomy, now with mesh placement.
Compared to the previous exam it is more hypodense.
Chest xray [**2158-7-27**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a moderate improvement.
[**7-29**] CXR - FINDINGS: The ET tube has been removed.
CT head [**8-4**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence for hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute vascular territorial infarction.
There is slight prominence of the lateral ventricles and third ventricle and temporal horns which are stable since study five days prior.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the SICU after an MRI showed a showed a large mass in the right cerebellopontine angle with compression of the fourth ventricle.
As part of the work up a CXR showed a showed a right retrocardiac opacity a follow chest CT showed atelectasis without mass.
He was transferred to the surgical floor on post op day 2 his exam was stable .
Chest x-ray showed acute aspiration pneumonia.
Head CT was done and revealed marginally increased edema.
ABG was done and revealed poor pa02, and he continued to have increased respiratory effort.
NCHCT [**8-4**] showed no acute hemorrhage, unchanged postoperative appearance in the right cerebellar pontine region.
His HCT fluctuated between 24 - 29, he did not require a transfusion since [**7-21**].
HCT on d/c was 24, trending down from 27, will need follow up to ensure this returns to baseline (27-30).
He will need f/u appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] at one month with noncontrast head CT and at 3months with an MRI.
At time of discharge his exam was remarkable for: Miming commands, oriented x2, dysarthric (via interpreter), PERRL at 2.5-1.5mm b/l, EOMs itnact with exception of Right abducens palsy, resultant dysconjugate gaze, peripheral VII nerve palsy with R facial droop, Right sided dysmetria in UE and LEs, negative, 4+ in Delt/Biceps/Triceps b/l.

Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 mL IV Q8H:PRN line flush Peripheral line: Flush with 3 mL Normal Saline every 8 hours and PRN.
F.  Followup Instructions: You need to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1 month with a CT scan of the brain (non-contrast).
You will need an MRI with and without contrast at that time.
