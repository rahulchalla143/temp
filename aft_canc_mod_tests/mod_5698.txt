CXR [**4-4**]: 1.
There was a large ramus which had a 80% ulcerated proximal stenosis.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling pressures with PCWP of 22mmHg with depressed cardiac index and low systemic blood pressure.
the final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection and no embolisation.
CXR [**4-5**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-4**]: Pulmonary edema is markedly asymmetric, severe in the right lung, though improved since [**4-4**], and mild on the left.
Echo [**4-5**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
CXR [**4-13**]: IMPRESSION: Resolving asymmetrical combined alveolar and interstitial process, likely due to resolving asymmetric edema.
Echo [**4-18**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with inferior hypokinesis.
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-4-5**], LV systolic function has improved.
# Cardiac - Cardiomyopathy/systolic CHF - at presentation to outside hospital, pt was reportedly found to have both mitral and tricuspid severe regurgitation, , severely depressed LVEF and anteroseptal and inferoseptal hypokinesis.
Her cardiac enzymes had increased slightly, and her cardiac cath revelaed only a ramus lesion, which was stented with 2 bare metal stents.
Work-up for other non-ischemic causes of her cardiomyopathy reveal a normal TSH, iron labs showed Fe 326, TIBC 113, and although she had required some transfusions as outpatient since chemotherapy, this was not thought to be sufficient to cause iron overload or hemochormatosis type CM.
Echo on day before discharge showed markedly improved systolic function, suspect that this is related to the resolved tachycardia.
Started on lipitor 80mg initially in setting of MI, but outpt labs on [**1-14**] revealed normal lipids with LDL of 43, decreased lipitor to 10mg.
She was switched to coumadin, INR increased rapidly after 2 doses of 5mg, decreased to 2.5mg.
She did experience an episode of significant R sided anterior nasal bleeding while on heparin, however her PTT at this time was 41.8 and INR was 1.9.
This was thought to be most likely related to irritation from oxygen and the nasal cannula, however she may need to have a goal INR slightly lower of 1.8-2.5.
At time of discharge on 2mg of coumadin, INR 2.4. .
On previous CT images, she is noted to have a possible IVC thrombus, cardiac echo did not demonstrate extensive progression of this.
