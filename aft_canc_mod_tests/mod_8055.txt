In follow up she developed a deep lesion in the left lower lobe that on biopsy was positive for non-small cell lung cancer.
Staging workup was negative for metastatic disease and her pulmonary function was acceptable for the proposed operation.

CXR ([**2193-3-15**]): FINDINGS: The patient is status post left pneumonectomy.
On POD 1 she developed hypotension with systolic pressures in the 60-70 range.
EKG showed lateral T-wave inversions.
Cardiology was consulted and ECHO was obtained.
Serial cardiac enzymes were checked with peak trop of 0.11 likely demand ischemia, and cardiac enzymes trended down.
A repeat ECHO suggested low intravascular volume and a central line was placed to assist with fluid management.
Hematocrit was 24 and she was transfused 1 unit of blood.
An EKG was checked and was unchaged and the discomfort resolved spontaneously.
Pulmonary:  The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
The patient's electrolytes were routinely followed during this hospitalization, and repleted when necessary.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Hematology:  The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely.
She received 2 units of blood on POD2 for hematocrit of 24, with good response and then 1 unit on POD 6. .
