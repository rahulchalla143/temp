Admission Date:  [**2197-1-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2197-1-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2144-10-18**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Company 191**]  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 52-year-old woman with a history of cervical adenocarcinoma stage II, status post radiation in [**2187**] who was diagnosed with right lung adenocarcinoma with fine-needle aspiration in [**2196-6-6**] after CT scan revealed a right lung mass in the setting of elevated tumor marker with CEA up to 16.4.
The CT revealed a mass of 2.5 cm by 5 cm in the right upper lobe.
She had a PET scan which staged cancer as stage III A or B at [**Hospital3 7778**].
Hyphae was seen in cytology but the path was not sufficient for evaluation of invasive Aspergillus.
Her AFB studies had remained negative until bronchoalveolar lavage on [**2197-1-4**] which grew out positive atypical Mycobacteria (Gordonii) for which she was started on itraconazole on [**2196-12-17**] for possible invasive aspergillosis.
The triple regimen included Rifabutin, ethambutol, and Clarithromycin, but the CT scan showed progressive cavitary lesions in the upper right lower lobe and dense consolidation in the base of right lower lobe.
She had an EGD which revealed gastritis.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup of the right lower lobe process including possible open lung biopsy.
Since her symptoms had no response to the broad antibiotic coverage and her cultures here remained unremarkable, triple antibiotics for atypical bacterial infection were discontinued and meropenem and the vancomycin were switched to levofloxacin and clindamycin to cover likely postobstructive pneumonia.
After a long discussion between Infectious Disease, Pulmonary and Thoracic Surgery, the decision was made not to pursue open lung biopsy given her critical condition.
She was scheduled to go for a bronchoscopy on [**2197-1-20**] for both diagnostic biopsy and therapeutic stenting of the collapsed bronchial.
