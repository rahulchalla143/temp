The patients abdominal exam was benign at the time.
During the code the pt underwent CPR for approximately 5 minutes at which time a pulse was detected.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
No thrombus is seen but a left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be definitively excluded.
Partial cholangiogram showed normal biliary tree.
Echo [**2167-2-10**]: The left atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-2-7**], an apical thrombus is now identified (may have been present before, but less well-visualized).
Renal U/S [**2167-2-12**]: ULTRASOUND IMAGES OF BILATERAL KIDNEYS AND URINARY BLADDER: Right kidney measures 10.7 cm in length.
1.7 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm solid-appearing mass in the upper pole of the right kidney as seen on US exam of [**2-3**], [**2166**].
Hypoechoic lesion of the left kidney as described above can be further evaluated with an MRI or CT depending on the patient's renal function.

Brief Hospital Course: 83M AF on Coumadin, CMP EF 20% s/p recent ERCP with sphincterotomy complicated by upper GI bleed, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] s/p PEA arrest.
He will require repeat ERCP in 4 weeks to remove his stent.
Hct fell to 25 from 38 two days ago requiring massive resuscitation and triple pressors.
Pt continued to have melanotic stools in the ICU, but Hct remained stable (had bumped to 41) without further transfusions on [**2166-2-8**].
Repeat ECG showed improvement.
TTE showed EF 15-20%.
ARF: Likely secondary to hypoperfusion following hypotensive event, pt still produced 15cc/hr after event.
Creatinine continued to worsen, indicating likely ATN.
Urinalysis demonstrated volume depletion as well.
With gentle IVF his creatinine started to improve.
He should have repeat chem 7 in [**4-9**] days, and nephrology evaluation if no improvement.
Acute on chronic systolic CHF- TTE showed stable EF 15-20%.
They can be restarted once his creatinine improves.
ASA/Coumadin should be restarted as per above as soon as possible and GI issues stable .
This was discussed with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6643**] was mentioned on imaging at [**Hospital3 10310**].
Also, renal ultrasound demonstrated likely renal cell carcinoma.
