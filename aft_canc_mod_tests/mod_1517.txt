Upon presentation, the patient had head CT that demonstrated 2 discrete hemorrhages in L frontal and parietal lobes with no mass effect.
(Of note, the patient is known to have a left frontal meningioma discovered on CT done in [**2135**]).
DM - HbA1C of 10.2 in [**3-18**] but not on meds 4.

Physical Exam: ON ADMISSION: T 97.2 BP 173/64  HR 72 RR 16 O2Sat 100% RA Gen: Lying in bed, intubated and sedated.
Localizes to painful stimuli for both UEs but does not withdraw LEs to noxious stim.
Exam was otherwise pertinent for bibasilar crackles and mild non-pitting lower extremity swelling slightly worse on the right as compared to the left.

Imaging: MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ([**2137-10-22**]) IMPRESSION: 1.
Meningioma overlying the left frontal lobe, stable in appearance and size compared to the prior CT from [**2135**], when accounting for differences in technique.
CT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis ([**2137-10-25**]): Enhancing heterogenous mass in right lower quadrant, may represent a conglomerate nodal mass, metastasis, less likely a primary mesenteric neoplasm such as carcinoid.
Could reflect an infectious or inflammatory process, however given high risk for malignancy,dedicated follow-up chest CT within three months is recommended.
[**Month (only) 116**] be further evaluation with MRCP.
Long-Term Monitoring EEG ([**2137-10-23**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due four electrographic seizures in the right occipital region consisting of rhythmic sharp waves and at times sharp and slow wave discharge for 1-2 minutes in duration without obvious clinical correlate on video.
Would recommend further EEG monitoring given multiple subclinical seizures detected on this recording.
Long-Term Monitoring EEG ([**Date range (3) 25995**]): IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Background EEG showed a widespread encephalopathy.
Chest X-ray ([**2137-10-26**]): New left lower lobe retrocardiac consolidation and ill-defined opacities in the remaining left lower lobe are new worrisome for infectious process Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are unchanged.
Sputum cytology [**10-29**]: ATYPICAL.
CXR [**10-29**]: Overall, the examination is unchanged.
At the time of admission, an MRI of the head was performed to better characterize the lesion and identify contributory structural abnormalities.
The study revealed an acute hemorrhagic lesion in the left parietal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass effect.
Accordingly, a CT of the torso was performed to evaluate for malignancy.
The imaging showed an enhancing heterogenous mass in right lower quadrant, bilateral pulmonary opacities with multiple pulmonary nodules, endometrial fluid and right adnexal fullness, subcentimeter hepatic lesions, enlarged lymph nodes, pancreatic calcifications with mild dilation of the proximal pancreatic duct, and possible bony lesions.
Long-term electroencephalogram monitoring was also performed.
Because the telemetry showed electrographic seizures, the patient was thought to be at a higher risk of further events.
The biopsy was therefore arranged to be done as an outpatient with further outpatient oncology follow up depending on the pathology of the biopsy.
Exam and CXR were consistent with pneumonia so the patient was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.
Outpatient CT guided RLQ biopsy, PCP follow up, and neurology follow up with repeat head MRI were arranged prior to discharge.
Her blood sugars were also elevated in the 180-300 range.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw a CBC with differential and have the results faxed to Dr[**Name (NI) 16259**] office.

Imaging of your brain showed two lesions.
One of these lesions was a meningioma which was seen on prior imaging in [**2135**].
It was not clear what this area was composed of but, given your history of breast cancer and the appearance of the area on head imaging, a CT scan of your torso was done.
The CT showed several concerning areas in your lungs, vertebrae and abdomen.
Should you decide not to pursue the biopsy at that time, please call the radiology department to cancel or reschedule.
An alternative medication is called trileptal although this medication puts you at risk for low sodium.
You should have blood work checked in 2 days by your VNA to ensure you are not experiencing bone marrow suppression from linezolid.
These labs should then be faxed to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 16258**].
Your blood pressure was, at times, very high but you did not feel as though you tolerated blood pressure medications aside from a small dose of avapro.
While we continue to recommend that you have better blood pressure control, you are being discharged on avapro.
It is vital to have excellent blood pressure control as high blood pressure could contribute to more bleeding in your head.
You were scheduled for an ultrasound and went to the exam but you did not feel this was necessary so the exam was not done.
You are at high risk for a blood clot that could break off and go to your lungs given that you have been mostly in bed for several days.
Your blood sugars were also very high during this admission.
Followup Instructions: A biopsy of your abdominal lesion has been ordered.
The radiology department will call you once the study has been protocoled.
The study should be done in approximately 10 days.
You have an MRI of your brain scheduled on [**11-29**] at 7:30am.
The MRI is in the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building, [**Hospital Ward Name **] on the [**Location (un) **].
You should have a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate the endometrial and ovarian abnormalities seen on CT.
