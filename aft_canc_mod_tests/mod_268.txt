COMPARISON: Outside CT from [**2103-8-9**].
TECHNIQUE: Helically aquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung apices through pubic symphysis following the administration of 150 cc of IV Optiray.
Multiphasic images of the liver were also obtained.
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Within the apex of the left upper lobe, there is an ill defined mass present, measuring 2.4 x 3.2 cm.
The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, ureters, stomach, and loops of large and small bowel are all within normal limits.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, uterus, adnexa, distal ureters, and bladder are all within normal limits.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Comparison is made to the prior CT scan dated [**2103-9-17**].
CT head at the time indicated new metastases, effacement of sulci and herniation into the foramen magnum.
However, over the next several days, it was determined that the EVD was infected with coagulase negative staphylococcus, which was treated with both intravenous and intraventricular Vancomycin until cultures from CSF were negative for seven consecutive days.
Evaluated by Cardiology who felt that the rhythm was polymorphic, and likely catecholamine mediated VT which would be best treated with a beta-blocker.
At the time of discharge, patient's blood pressure and heart rate were stable without ectopy, and patient was discharged on 25mg Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **].
Sliding scale insulin administered while on daily decadron to good effect.
Repeat head CT showed residual blood in the ventricles, likely from removal of the EVD.
