He noted that the swelling had significantly enlarged, and a CT scan was obtained.
A prior CT scan on [**2160-6-6**] revealed a 2.3 x 2.6 x 3 cm mass within the superficial portion of the parotid tail.
On [**2160-6-20**], a fine-needle aspiration biospy was performed showing malignant cells consistent with mucoepidermoid carcinoma.
On [**2160-6-24**] an MRI neck showed a T2 hypointense lesion in the right parotid gland at the junction of the superficial and deep lobes measuring approximately 3 x 2.7 cm-- appearance was concerning for malignant neoplasm versus adenopathy from overlying skin malignancy.
He presented on [**2160-7-10**] and underwent right parotidectomy with supra-omohyoid modified neck dissection with nerve monitoring and with right abdominal fat graft.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM (UPON DISCHARGE): [**2160-7-21**]  VITALS: 99.2/98.8  BP 98/52  HR 57  RR 20  O2SAT 99%RA  HEENT: Normocephalic.
RESP: Clear to auscultation anteriorly, bilaterally with no adventitious sounds.
[**2160-7-13**] CTA CHEST  There are numerous filling defects within the pulmonary arterial vasculature, notably in the right upper pulmonary artery extending into the segmental branches.
[**2160-7-13**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in bilateral common femoral vein, superficial femoral vein, and popliteal veins.
The tip of the tube projects 6 cm above the carina, the tube could be advanced by 1-2 cm.
In comparison with the study of [**7-14**], the endotracheal tube has been removed.
Otherwise, lung fields, cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar silhouette, and pleural surfaces remain unchanged.

All other neck lymph nodes negative for carcinoma, see report.
On HOD#1 a rapid response/trigger was called in the AM given that the patient's blood pressure was in the 70s/40s range and he complained of being lightheaded when he attempted to stand-up or ambulate.
His EKG was unchanged from [**2-/2160**], with some residual evidence of P-R interval elongation.
RESPIRATORY: The patient was extubated at the end of the operative procedure and maintained his oxygen saturations without issue.
A cardiac workup revealed a troponin of 0.07, his EKG showed some right heart strain, and a CTA was obtained showing multiple pulmonary arterial filling defects compatible with acute pulmonary embolus--with evidence of right heart strain and patchy consolidation at the lung bases.
The patient also had a CT head which showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhaging.
His post-labs revealed a creatinine of 0.7 which remained stable.
His urine output was adequate throughout his hospital course.
His urine color restored to normal on HOD#7.
Repeat hematocrits were checked.
He again returned to the OR on [**2160-7-15**] for re-exploration of the right neck with evacuation of the right neck hematoma.
He was heparinized at a rate of 1200-1450 U/hr, without heparin boluses, for a goal PTT of 50 to 70.
PTT draws were performed Q6-8 hours, and adjustments to the heparin gtt were maintained.
Coumadin 5 mg PO daily was administered on HOD#8 and HOD#9, at which time his INR was maintained in the 2.0 to 3.5 range, with a goal of [**1-15**].5.
The patient's post-op hematocrit dropped after his first evacuation of right neck hematoma.
His hematocrit responded appropriately to transfusion each time, for a goal Hct > 25.
Upon discharge, his hematocrit had been stable at 32.6%.
PROPHYLAXIS: Pneumatic compression boots were maintained in the post-op period to prevent DVT/PE initially.
