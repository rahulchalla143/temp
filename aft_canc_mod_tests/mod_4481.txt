Cath revealed right dominant system with diffusely diseased mid LAD with 90% stenosis, 99% discrete proximal circumflex lesion, and discrete 90% distal RCA stenosis.
Left sided filling pressures were just mildly elevated, and LVEF was calculated to be about 45% with moderate inferior hypokinesis.
POD#1 he was transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
An outpatient study was arranged.
Cdiff specs were sent with negative results.
