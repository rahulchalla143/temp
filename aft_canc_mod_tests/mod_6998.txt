SBP rose to 100s after IVF.
At HD, 1L taken off, BP dropped to 70s, fistula was used.
Cards did a bedside echo which showed normal wall motion, rec no need for CCU.
Pt's BP dropped at HD last Saturday to 60s-70s [**Name8 (MD) **] RN (per records, in 80s) but he did not have any chest pain.
Per cards, no evidence of CHF and no regional wall motion abnormalities on echo - appears dry.

A three- month followup CT is recommended for assessment of stability.
Right ventricular systolic function appears to be normal but views were technically limited.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

SBP rose to 100s after IVF.
At HD, 1L taken off, BP dropped to 70s, fistula was used.
Cards did a bedside echo which showed normal wall motion, rec no need for CCU and to medically manage.
Given Hct drop, CT C/A/P performed.
NSTEMI - As above, the patient experienced an NSTEMI in the setting of hypotension and Hct drop.
His blood pressure improved on the floor and he was started on a BB.
Consideration for follow-up with cardiology and potential stress test can be made as on outpatient.
However, multiple co-morbidities may defer further evaluation or invasive procedures regardless.
On the floor his hematocrit remained stable and was closely followed and his iron studies revealed a component of anemia of chronic disease.
Pulmonary and Liver nodules, on CT are new however since last imaging.
His levels were sub-therapuetic with adjustment this admission.
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day).
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for nausea.
