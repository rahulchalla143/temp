CT scan at outside hospital showed a contained splenic rupture.

His history of myeloproliferative disorder was known and he had a CAT scan done at the outside institution which revealed severely injured and spontaneous rupture of his spleen, as well as significant amount of free fluid in the abdomen.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital6 256**] he had a hematocrit of 23, heart rate of 130 and blood pressure of 80/40.
Approximately 2 L of old and new blood quickly was suctioned out from the abdomen.
Using left hand, the ligamentous attachment to the spleen to the diaphragm and the posterior peritoneum, as well as the kidney were bluntly dissected free.
There was free fluid over the liver which was old blood and was suctioned out and irrigated.
After examination in 2 minutes it appeared that the bleeding had stopped.
Needle and sponge count were correct.
EKG showed what appeared to be multifocal atrial tachcardia.
His Rate was controlled with IV lopressor and then PO once he was tolerating a diet.
The catheter was removed and his urine was sent multiple times for UA and culture due to the cloudy appearence of it.
His cultures to date have all been negative.
Further clinical and laboratory studies are required for a nosological diagnosis.
RESULTS: three-color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield.
CD19-positive B-cells are scant in number precluding evaluation of clonality.
Cell marker analysis was attempted, but was non-diagnostic in this case due to insufficient numbers of B-cells.
Platelets and Hematocrit low, but at baseline and stable prior to discharge.
Blood sugars slightly elevated but home medications restarted prior to discharge.
If you need the prescription pain medicine, be sure to take it with food to prevent upset stomach.
