On T1W MP-RAGE and SE post- gadolinium sequences, there are several small enhancing vessels seen along the posterior aspect of the surgical resection bed, seen on the pre-operative study, which likely represent normal vessels at the margin of the surgical resection bed.

On POD#1, DVT prophylaxsis was started, and MRI of the head was performed to evaluate for residual tumor burden.
Post operative MR imaging was obtained routinely.
