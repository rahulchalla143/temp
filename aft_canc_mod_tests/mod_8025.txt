This remained in place until the morning of POD 6; after his swallow study was confirmed he was transitioned to PO pain.
CV: Initially he had some episodes of hypotension with systolic BP to the 80's in PACU; epidural was decreased and this resolved.
At discharge he is stable on room air with O2 sats >92% at rest and ambulating.
Of note his chest xrays did demonstrate increasing amounts of subcutaneous air, but there was no other evidence of leak and he remained clinically stable.
After negative swallow study on POD 6 his chest tube was removed and post pull CXR showed no pneumothorax.
CXR on day of discharge showed interval decrease in subcutaneous air from prior day.
Nutrition was consulted and determined his goal rate to be 115cc/h x18h of Replete full strength without fiber.
He had a swallow study on POD 6 with no evidence of esophageal leak; he was then advanced to full liquid diet.
ID: He remained afebrile; at time of discharge WBC is 4.5; urinalysis had moderate bacteria and so a urine culture was obtained, this has had no growth.
He will follow up in clinic in two weeks with repeat CXR at that time.
