CT head showed increased size of her left occipital mass with significant vasogenic edema.
- MRI [**5-/2188**] head revealed new brain lesions after new neurological symptoms of headaches, visual deficit of the right field, and right lower extremity weakness.
[**2188-2-24**] - CT of the chest for refractory cough reveals a large right upper lobe mass extending into the chest wall with probable/possible chest wall invasion, with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

MRI head - Concern of a single 4 mm left occipital mass, questionable metastases.

Stable appearance of the three known metastases in comparison to the prior exam performed 10 hours prior.
Stable mass effect on the left lateral ventricle with persistent  ventriculomegaly, unchanged from the prior exam performed 10 hours earlier, but increased from the prior MRI in [**2188-5-13**].
