He underwent a CT guided core biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass at [**Hospital3 19345**] on [**2189-10-6**].
At that time, his blood pressure was noted to be in the 210s and a nitro patch was given.
Pathology was reviewed at [**Hospital1 18**].
In addition, the submitted immunostains showed that the tumor cells are stained strongly positive for chromogranin and synaptophysin, and negative for cytokeratins (AE1/AE3, CK7, and CK20), CD 68, and CD117.
Laboratory studies performed in [**Month (only) **] were significant for increased plasma and urinary normetanephrine and metanephrine catecholamines (see under labs).
As part of the work up also, he underwent a MIBG, which was performed on [**2190-1-13**] at [**Hospital1 18**].
In addition, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to have an incidental thyroid nodule on the chest CT performed in [**Month (only) **] as part of the work up for the paraganglioma.
A subsequent thyroid US showed a dominant 3 cm solid nodule located on the left thyroid lobe.
Calcitonin level, which was WNL, was also checked to rule out medullary thyroid carcinoma.
Thyroid nodule  PSH: CT guided biopsy of retroperitoneal mass  Social History: Patient came to US in [**2173**] from [**Last Name (LF) 91211**], [**First Name3 (LF) 11150**].

ECHO [**2190-1-29**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT HEAD [**2190-2-5**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
If clinical concern persists for ischemic stroke, would recommend further evaluation with an MRI.
EEG [**2190-2-6**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG because of diffuse background slowing and intermittent bifrontal slowing.
CXR [**2190-2-6**]: FINDINGS: The feeding tube is in the first portion of the duodenum.
MRI HEAD W/ AND W/O CONTRAST [**2190-2-7**]: 1.

His surgery was complicated by volatile blood pressure due to the nature of the tumor itself, as well as excessive bleeding requiring transfusion.
His postoperative course was complicated by ileus, delirium, and acute SOB/tachypnea and he transferred to SICU on [**1-28**] for further monitoring.
Urine and blood culture on [**1-28**] grew pan sensitive pseudomonas.
A CT head and MRI were obtained and essentially negative for acute process or signs of infarct.
An EEG was also performed which did not show any focal seizure activity,  Speech and swallow evaluated the patient, with recommendations for aspiration precautions, honey thickened liquids and pureed solids.
Lancets Patient will need lancets to check his blood sugars.
