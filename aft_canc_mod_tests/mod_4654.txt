MRI Brain: MPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 45M hx metastatic RCC who presents with acute thoracic bandlike lancing pain centered in the RUQ and RLE upper motor neuron signs, CT thorax with T8 lesion that is nearly obliterating the cord.
#T8 cord compression: Has upper motor neuron signs on exam with radicular bandlike abdominal pain in the T8 area.
CT with concern for canal obliteration with anterolateral displacement of the cord.
MRI T/L spine confirmed severe cord compression.
His neurological exam was unchanged after laminectomy, with 8-10 beats of bilateral ankle clonus and lower extremity hyperreflexia.
#Diplopia: the patient complained of diplopia that started 2 days prior to admission, however he refused the majority of the exam on admission.
The patient was reintubated for MRI of the brain, which showed a clivus bone metastatic lesion in the area of the right abducens nerve.
