REPORTS: CXR [**2101-7-5**]: IMPRESSION: Large size central pulmonary right-sided hilar mass.
No previous chest examinations available for comparison.
Described findings would benefit from a chest CT for further delineation of the process.
CT ABD/PELVIS/CHEST [**2101-7-6**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Lung mass measuring 3.1 x 6.0 x 6.8 cm proximal to the right hilum with a single adjacent enlarged hilar lymph node concerning for primary malignancy.
MRI L-SPINE [**2101-7-5**]: IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous signal intensity mass involving the lateral mass of C2 vertebra, likely a bony metastasis.
Further evaluation with brain MRI is recommended.
CT HEAD W/OUT CONTRAST [**2101-7-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
FNA [**2101-7-8**] R HILAR MASS: DIAGNOSIS: FNA, Right hilar mass:    POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,   consistent with poorly-differentiated non-small cell   carcinoma with extensive necrosis.
CXR [**2101-7-11**]: IMPRESSION: No abnormalities to explain patient's symptoms within the limitations of this study technique.
CT HEAD W/OUT CONTRAST [**2101-7-12**]: IMPRESSION: No overt interval change on noncontrast head CT. MRI would be more sensitive for an acute infarction, if clinically indicated.
CT C-SPINE [**2101-7-12**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Multilevel cervical DJD is better assessed on the [**2101-7-5**] cervical spine MRI.
MRI SPINE [**2101-7-12**]: Impression: 1.
Preliminary pathology shows high grade poorly differentiated squamous cell.
He underwent C-spine stabilization and biopsy of his C-spine mass which showed metastatic lung pathology.
He will need radiation of his lesions, which is planned for 5-10 days of treatment with simulation and first treatment on Monday [**2101-7-18**] at 1030hrs.
# HEM/ONC: Mediastinal mass biopsy returns as a poorly differentiated squamous cell cancer, and C-spine biopsy returned as lung pathology making pt's sx likely related to metastatic lung cancer.
# ORTHO: Pt s/p c-spine stabilization on [**7-11**], biopsy was obtained intraoperatively.
Endo consult felt that his hyperthyroidism could not be evaluated while pt was acutely ill as thyroid studies are not accurate for inpatients.
