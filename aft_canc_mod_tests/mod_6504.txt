Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification.
She will need a repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] in [**3-21**] weeks for stent removal and possible sphincterotomy.
# Klebsiella and E coli septicemia, hypotension, UTI, biliary obstruction, clinical cholangitis - This improved on broad spectrum antibiotics and she was narrowed to cipro monotherapy, following an [**Hospital1 **] ([**12-31**]) to relieve obstruction (s/p stent).
Seizure disorder: Her imaging is stable from [**2153**]; EEG did not show seizure.
# Dysphagia: The patient failed speech and swallow evaluations on [**2158-1-3**] and [**2158-1-5**].
Repeat S+S eval on [**1-9**] revealed ongoing intermittent aspiration of her baseline ground solids and honey thickened liquids, consistent with or better than her previous baseline.
Limited fiberoptic exam demonstrated normal vocal cord mobility.
Also, at time of admission to [**Hospital3 2568**], LP was considered given mental status change, but neurosurgery evaluation there indicated that there would be significant risk with the mass.
Her previous neurosurgeons are at [**Hospital1 2025**].
