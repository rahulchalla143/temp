There he was noted to have a low-grade temp to 100.3 and hypoxic to mid-80s on a NRB.
The patient requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.1, P 133, BP 106/72, R 24, O2 sat 91% on NRB.
CXR showed a RLL opacity.
An outside hospital brain MRI showed a large right occipital hemorrhagic mass on [**2140-9-18**].
Torso CT showed multiple primary nodules, esophageal wall thickening and right renal mass.
Craniotomy on [**2140-9-23**] revealed adenocarcinoma that was CK20 and CDX positive for adenocarcinoma that was eventually evaluated and felt consistent with esophageal origin.
On [**2141-11-29**] torso CT showed continued evidence of progression of disease.
A torso CT earlier in [**Month (only) 116**] had shown no disease below the diaphragm, with only small pulmonary nodules that were slowly growing.
Chest CT: 1.
Small layering pleural effusions, probably due to cardiac decompensation producing minimal edema, progressed on subsequent chest radiograph of [**8-22**].
A TTE with bubble study showed no evidence of intracardiac shunt.
Tobramycin was added for double coverage after blood cx from the emergency department grew GNR, but was discontinued once sensitivities were back.
A thoracic CT w/o contrast confirmed diffuse metastatic disease compressing the bronchioles and the patient's respiratory compromise was largely irreversible.
#  Fever/Leukocytosis:  The patient's initial sepsis was attributed to bacterial pneumonia based on CXR and symptoms.
Urine culture was negative.
Blood cultures from the ED grew GNR so Tobramycin was added for double coverage.
On day 10, cefepime was switched to ceftazadime based on new antibiotic sensitivity profile from the patient's initial positive blood culture.
Over ICU course the patient defervesed and his WBC count returned to [**Location 213**].
Electrolytes were monitored serially and repleted as needed.
