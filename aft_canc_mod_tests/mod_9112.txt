The patient underwent an EEG which showed generalized slowing, however, no seizure activity.
The patient also had a lumbar puncture performed to rule out any infectious etiology or central nervous system involvement with cancer.
The lumbar puncture was unremarkable.
The patient underwent an MRI of his head on [**9-17**], which showed no bleed and no significant swelling and an infectious etiology was also considered; however, chest x-ray, blood and urine cultures remained negative.
The patient's encephalopathy and gait disturbance seemed most likely consistent with irradiation somnolence syndrome, especially given his terminal status for his Boron neutron capture therapy.
His MRI on [**9-6**], and also on [**9-16**], did not show any findings that would be consistent with a GBM as the cause for the patient's symptoms of change in mental status and gait disturbance.
The patient complained of headache on [**9-23**] and a head CT scan was done which showed no intracranial hemorrhage and little change from prior MRI.
The patient also underwent an MRI of his spine on [**9-26**] to evaluate his lower extremity weakness and search for a possible metastases.
This MRI showed no evidence for marrow edema, pathologic compression or extrinsic cord compression.
PULMONARY EMBOLISM / ANTICOAGULATION:  The patient had been transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit after an event consistent with myocardial infarction by symptoms, however, in the Cardiac Care Unit the patient was sent for a CT angiogram of the chest to rule out pulmonary embolism and multiple large bilateral pulmonary emboli were found.
Imaging was negative for a head bleed and for abdominal or retroperitoneal bleed.
The patient was continued on heparin and the platelet count increased during this therapy and was above 200 at discharge.
The phenytoin level was 7.0 on the morning of [**9-29**].
HYPERTENSION:  The patient's blood pressure was well controlled on Losartan 100 mg p.o.
