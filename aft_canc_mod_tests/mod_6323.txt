CT torso [**3-11**] notable for multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, including cavitary lesions involving RUL/LLL, multiple hypoattenuating liver lesions enlarged since [**10-27**], increased dilation of the visualized pancreatic duct; these findings were considered highly suspicious of metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Testing for potential infectious etiologies included sputum for AFB, beta-glucan, and galactomannen returned negative; however on [**3-24**] HMED service notified that sputum cultures had returned positive for AFB.
As arranged by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3-17**], pt underwent CT-guided biopsy of a soft-tissue mass in the gallbladder fossa earlier today, without reported complication.
He received 1 unit PRBC after a baseline HCT returned at 19.7.
Osteoarthritis 5.
Motor testing [**4-23**] throughout in deltoids, biceps, triceps, iliopsoas, quadriceps, hamstrings, ankle flexors/extensors bilaterally.

Pulmonary nodules,(new since [**2158-11-6**]) are better evaluated on CT chest performed 2 days prior.
The lesions are amenable to CT guided biopsy .

Sputum, blood cx negative Blasto, B Glucan, , Aspergillus, Histo, Quantiferon negative  Brief Hospital Course: 70M korean speaking, h/o peri-ampular pancreatic ca s/p resection [**10-27**], presenting with recently symptomatic anemia concerning for GIB, cavitary pulmnonary lesions with AFB+ culture, admitted after elective CT guided biopsy with acute HCT drop.
# hypoxia / bradycardia / WCT - on [**2160-4-4**] PM, pt transferred to ICU in setting of hypoxia, bradycardia during EGD.
per anesthesia, he received atropine for HR 30s, was never pulseless, though SBP 50s, requiring neo, with subsequent HR high 100s, and SBP 180s, with ?WCT requiring esmolol.
On [**2160-4-4**], pt underwent EGD after 3rd AFB smear was negative for TB, which revealed a papillary mass with clotted blood.
On the floor, his Hct remained stable at 28 and was maintained on a PPI [**Hospital1 **].
3 repeat AFB sputums obtained, which were ultimately negative.
hepatitis serologies unremarkable (hepB sAB positive).
on [**2160-4-4**], pt AFB negative x3 smears, therefore isolation precautions discontinued.
consideration given to possible CT guided biopsy of lung lesions to confirm malignancy before therapy.
His WBC dropped and his mTB regimen was stopped.
will hold off on additional testing until mTB probe testing done, if negative, may need bronch/ct guided biopsy of pulmonary nodules.
- trend LFTs on TB medications, which remained stable.
TO DO: - Oncology evaluation for metastatic ampullary cancer - Check CBC to ensure stability of Hct.
If has recurrent GI bleed must consider INR embolization for bleeding vessel near ampullary cancer - Has MAC infection confirmed by MA state lab, NOT mTB.
Consider treatment prior to chemotherapy - Can call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], ID fellow at [**Hospital1 18**] with any questions regarding this ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4170**] - continue medications  Medications on Admission: Medications on Admission Per Medication Reconciliation signed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 496**] [**2160-3-31**]: 1.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a biopsy of an abdominal mass near the gallbladder.
Endoscopy was performed which showed the cause of your anemia as gastrointestinal from a small vessel, which may be related to your canncer.
The culture grew MAC, which may require treatment prior to chemotherapy.
For your bleed you must take an acid blocker twice daily and monitor for signs of bleeding.
- the culture grew MAC.
