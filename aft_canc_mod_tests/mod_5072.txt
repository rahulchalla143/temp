Loaded with 300 mg amiodarone IV and started on gtt, given 4g IV magnesium, next rhythm check sinus rhythm, given 40 mEQ IV potassium.
Upon reviewing the old telemetry strip, it was felt that his rhythm strip was most c/w torsades.
His QTc was estimated to be 456 (or greater).
Initial vitals in ED: T98.4, 124/58, 76, 18, 99% 2L NC.
On transfer, VS: AF, BP 100/59, HR 71, RR 16, 100% 4L.
On review of systems, pt mentions mild dysphagia for solid foods, nausea, decreased PO, and syncopal spells.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: (-)Diabetes, (-)Hypertension 2.
-distal esophageal adenocarcinoma that is stage [**Doctor First Name **] by endoscopic ultrasound (on cisplatin, 5FU with last cycle [**2130-8-18**]).
Physical Exam: VS: T99.1, BP 115/62, HR 63, RR 13, 100% 4L.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 5 cm.
PULSES: Right: 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: EKG [**2130-8-28**]: polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with long QTc consistent with torsades.
TTE [**2130-8-29**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Head and facial bone CT (OSH [**Hospital3 15402**]): no intracranial injury, no definitive facial bone fx, there is deformity of the right orbital floor (probably related to old trauma), several small radio-opaque foreign bodies projecting superficial to the zygomatic arch of uncertain age.
CXR (OSH [**Hospital3 **]): R Subclavian CVL with tip in the SVC.

Echo was performed which was normal, and did not show any structural cause for prolonged QTc.
Patient was monitored on telemetry without any further events or arrhythmias.
His potassium was kept above 4 and his magnesium was kept above 2.
Pt should have his labs checked on Thursday [**9-7**] with results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36924**].
Patient was placed on neutropenic precautions and CBC was monitored while admitted.
Received 2 units PRBC and hct on discharge 31. .
Head CT at OSH negative for ICH.

Hepatitis C, untreated 3.
You were monitored on telemetry while you were admitted, without further arrhythmias.
NEW MEDICATIONS: -Spironolactone: to keep your potassium level up -MS Contin: to substitute for the methadone.
- Magnesium Oxide: to keep your magnesium levels up - Clonidine: to prevent symptoms of narcotics withdrawal .
