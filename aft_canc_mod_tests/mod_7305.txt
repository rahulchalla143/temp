She was hypotensive to SBP of 60 and was given 1L NS and started on dopamine.
Cardiac cath showed stable configuration of the native and bypass vessels, with no new lesions.
Of note, patient had a screening colonoscopy in [**2106-12-4**] which found a colonic polyp but no intervention undertaken at that time.
At [**Hospital3 4107**] rectal exam performed but guaiac status not documented.
At times she has required transfusions and was told by her cardiologist that she should not let her hematocrit go below 30%.
Past Medical History: Cardiac Risk Factors: - Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, - Hypertension  .
Cardiac History: CABG in [**2095**] with LIMA-LAD (atretic), SVG-PDA (occluded), SVG-OM patent per last cath in [**12-11**], s/p 15 stents .
Family History: There is significant family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death in multiple family members  Physical Exam: VS: T 96.6, BP 98/52 on 5.0 mcg/kg/min of dopamine, HR 63, RR 23, O2 100% on 3L NC Gen: WDWN middle aged female in NAD, resp or otherwise.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit;  Pertinent Results: Cardiac cath [**2107-3-29**]: 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no new critical coronary disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed low systemic arterial pressure with an SBP of 67 mm Hg off of dopamine with IV fluids wide open.
Dopamine IV gtt was increased to 10 mcg/kg/min with an SBP of 86 mm Hg.
CTA chest [**2107-3-29**] 1.
ECHO [**2107-3-30**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.

Cardiac cath did not demonstrate any significant new lesions.
Her blood pressure was systolic 80s.
Patient was discharged on her home toprol XL at 12.5mg daily, Imdur 60mg daily, lisinopril 20mg daily with strict instructions to be checking her blood pressure at home and to hold these medications if her systolic blood pressure was less than 100.
Her ECHO was repeated and showed EF>55 and abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with post-op state however early right ventricular volume overload cannot be excluded.
In terms of risk factors, Hb A1C was 5.3, LDL 145, HDL 33.
Patient ruled out for ACS by cardiac cath, PE by negative CTA of chest, and no indications of pericarditis by EKG and ECHO.
Repeat ECHO showed preserved EF and no gross wall motion abnormalitis.
Hypotension: Patient's blood pressure runs a the low-end of normal (in 80s) so initial drop was probably less-concerning.
She was initially started on a dopamine gtt but weaned off overnight and maintaining her pressures, SBP 80s.
She was discharged with SBP 80s, and patient knows to continue holding her BP medications for any hypotension.

You were evaluated by cardiac catheterization which showed no changes.
You also had an echocardiogram of your heart which showed good heart function.
Do not take the following medications if your systolic blood pressure is less than 100: - imdur - metoprolol - lisinopril  Please follow up with your physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 1-2 weeks of discharge from the hospital.
Please also call your physician if you have low blood pressures and are needing to hold your blood pressure medications.
