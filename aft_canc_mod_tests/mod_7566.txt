Pulmonary vasculature and interstitium is consistent with heart failure.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63y/o lady with pulmonary hypertension of unknown etiology, with subacute worsening of her dyspnea, who was transfered after 3 week admission to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for further workup of pulmonary HTN.
Her labs and ABGs suggested respiratory fatigue and systemic ischemia (rising lactate; antibiotics were started in case this represented sepsis).
