C.CATH Study Date of [**2136-1-20**] 1.
Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed: --the LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right-sided filling pressures with RVEDP 7 mmHg.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressures were high-normal with PASP 27 mmHg.
There was severe systemic arterial systolic hypertension with SBP 177 mmHg.
The cardiac output was preserved, with CI 2.6 L/min/m2.
Final angiography revealed a 30% residual stenosis in the RCA, no dissection and TIMI III flow.
Normal cardiac output with normal right-sided filling pressures and high-normal PA systolic pressures 4.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2136-1-20**] at 3:30:00 PM The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to dyskinesis of the basal inferior posterior wall and akinesis of the midventricular segments of the inferior and posterior walls.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-10-27**], there is now left and right ventricular contractile dysfunction.
CK peaked at 2111.
Echo with newly depressed EF of 30-40%.
Started beta blocker titrated to HR 60.
Lipid panel: Cholest 165, Triglyc 114, HDL 44, LDLcalc 98, so not at goal.
Pump: Systolic heart failure, acute - Euvolemic on exam.
Repeat echo on admission demonstrated new left and right ventricular contractile dysfunction with EF 30-40%.
You will need to have another echocardiogram in a month to check the heart function.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Plavix: to prevent blood clots 2.
Metoprolol: to slow your heart rate down and help it recover from the heart attack 3.
Aspirin: to prevent blood clots 4.
