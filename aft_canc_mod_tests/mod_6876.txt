[**2190-9-3**] ECHO PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %).
Right ventricular systolic function remains low normal.
The maximum pressure gradient through the valve is 12 mmHg with a mean pressure of 7 mmHg and an area calculated to be 1.7 cm2.
FINDINGS: Patient's condition did not permit examination in standard view therefore changed to AP and lateral view in sitting semi-upright position.
Comparison is made with the next preceding AP single chest view of [**9-5**], [**2189**].
She was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed less then 40% stenosis bilaterally.
She developed non-oliguria acute tubular nephrosis post operatively and creatinine peaked at 2.2.
All diuretics were discontinued and her creatinine had decreased to 1.6 (which was her baseline) at the time of discharge.
Coumadin was restarted at home dose for atrial fibrillation and her INR was monitored.
Dr [**Name (NI) 80890**] office was contact[**Name (NI) **] and will be following her INR levels on discharge from rehab.
