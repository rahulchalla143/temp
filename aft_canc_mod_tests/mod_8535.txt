He was then scheduled for colonoscopy this coming week to evaluate for GI bleed, last colonoscopy and EGD 5 years ago were normal per patient.

TTE [**2136-10-22**] Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-3-14**], the anterior septum is hypokinetic and the aortic valve is severely stenotic.
EGD [**2136-10-22**] Evidence of esophagectomy s/p gastric pullthrough.

ACTIVE ISSUES  #Respiratory distress: Initially the patient's dyspnea on exertion seemed to be consistent with symptomatic anemia given HCT 20.9 from baseline 39.1.
Given h/o severe AS, elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR were concerning for CHF and acute onset in the setting of increased emotional stress and raised concern for ACS, however troponins were negative x2.
TTE was obtained and showed mild regional LV systolic dysfunction w/hypokinesis of the anterior septum, severe aortic valve stenosis, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
However, while on the floor he had several endoscopic procedures, and following the endoscopy to place a capsule for eval of his GIB, he became acutely hypoxic and went into respiratory distress; CXR showed an extensive new process in his left lung, thought to be [**3-8**] aspiration event.
There was consideration of a chest CT to get a better sense of anatomy and question of possible emphysema given his large lung volumes despite his prior chest surgeries to help better determine his respiratory status, but the patient declined.
Last EGD and colonoscopy 5 years ago were normal per patient.
PPI [**Hospital1 **] was started.
However, food was noted to be retained in stomach, and he had repeat EGD/colonoscopy on [**10-23**] under general anesthesia which showed Barrett's on the endoscopy and normal colonic mucosa.
Hematocrit remained in the high 20s during the last days of his hospitalization and patient had no more clear episodes of GI bleeding.
#AS: Severe AS with EF 50-55% on [**Location (un) 620**] TTE 5/[**2136**].
He had a TTE which showed severe aortic stenosis again with valve area 0.8-1.0cm2.
EF was decreased from prior at 40-45%.
Patient was not interested in having a cardiac catheterization during this hospitalization for the aortic stenosis, but may be amenable as an outpatient.
# CAD:  Cardiology service felt that the new mild hypokinesis seen on his ECHO was secondary to ischemia, and they advised starting aspirin 81 mg a day.
He took it in the hospital and his hematocrit remained stable.
Transitional issues - needs hct checked at PCPs office; if he has ongoing GIBleeding without a clear source, he will need outpatient PRBC transfusions to keep hct above 25 given his CAD  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Information was obtained from Patient.
You received four blood transfusions, and your blood count stabilized.
You underwent multiple endoscopic procedures, which did not reveal a source of bleeding in your GI tract.
You were also started on aspirin and your blood count remained stable.
Cardiology advised a small dose of aspirin 81 mg daily Please take omeprazole 40 mg daily to prevent further bleeding  Followup Instructions: Name: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15048**], MD Specialty: Primary Care When: Friday [**11-2**] at 1:45pm Location: [**Hospital1 **] HEALTHCARE - [**Location (un) **] Address: [**Street Address(2) 10534**], [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 12541**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9347**]  Name: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] Specialty: Cardiology When: Wednesday [**11-14**] at 10am Where: [**Street Address(2) 3001**] [**Location (un) 620**] [**Numeric Identifier 3002**] Phone: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 8937**]  Department: DIV.
