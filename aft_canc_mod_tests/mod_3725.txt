MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITH GADOLINIUM: IMPRESSION:  Paraspinal mass with vertebral body involvement at T7-T8.
MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE: IMPRESSION:  First degree spondylolisthesis at L5-S1.
CT T-spine w/o contrast [**2100-11-30**]: Again seen is destruction of the inferior one-half of T7 and superior endplate of T8 with a large associated paraspinal mass.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2100-12-2**]: CT ABDOMEN:  The gallbladder is distended likely due to fasting.
TTE [**2100-12-6**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is top normal.
CXR PA/Lateral [**2100-12-6**]: IMPRESSION:  No evidence for pneumonia.
Further evaluation, either by follow up plain radiographs in approx 3 months or by CT is suggested.
A focal thickening of the left fissure is 4.3 mm in length.

MRI on admission showed an epidural mass at T7-T8 level with some moderate cord compression.
CT spine confirmed this finding.
Found to have elevated ESR to 102 and CRP of 216 concerning for infectious process.
Based on imaging the differential of the epidural mass was infection (bacterial abscess vs tuburculoma), vs malignancy vs AV malformation.
Serial neurological exams were performed looking for signs of cord compression and were normal.
On [**12-3**] the patient underwent CT-guided biopsy of the mass and tissue was sent to microbiology  and pathology.
Gram stain and culture returned positive for GPC.
He was continued on vancomycin with goal troughs 17-20.
TTE showed no evidence of endocarditis with no vegetations or abscesses.
A TEE was not performed given the patient would require a long course of antibiotics and TEE would not change the management.
A PPD was also placed given tuburculoma was in the differential and was negative.
Additionally, AFB smear and stain were both negative.
AFB culture is pending.
There was no evidence of granulomas on CXR or chest CT suggestive of old TB infection.
PSA was 1.0 and chest CT showed no lung nodules.
Path of epidural biopsy showed inflammation.
An EKG revealed lateral ST depressions.
His cardiac enzymes were positive with a troponin T peak of 0.27.
## Cardiac arrest - The patient's course was further complicated by a bradycardic arrest leading to asystole.
Fe studies suggestive of anemia of chronic disease.
His Hct stabilized after transfusion.
He was tested for C diff and found to be negative x3.
A C diff B toxin has been sent and will be followed up after discharge.
BP was initially labile and elevated readings seemed to correlate with pain.
When pain was better controlled the patient's BP remained elevated with SBP 140-150 at times.
His blood pressure was controlled as above.
## Upper Extremitiy DVT - The patient developed a clot in the right cephalic vein in the setting of a RIJ central venous catheter.
The patient had a CTA of the chest that was negative for PE.
## Enterobacter in sputum - The patient did have a sputum culture that revealed a pan-sensitive enterobacter cloacae.
Antibiotics, levofloxicin, directed at this bacteria were started when he was noted to have an infiltrate on CXR and some shortness of breath.
The fluid was exudative and likely related to the pneumonia although the gram stain was negative (he has been on antibiotics).
## Elevated Creatinine - Creatinine was 1.6 on admission.
He will receive standing potassium repletion and need potassium level checked shortly after discharge to adjust the dose.

You will need an outpatient colonoscopy in the future.
A CT scan of your abdomen saw some illiac artery dissections.
