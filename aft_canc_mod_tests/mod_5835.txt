The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.
IMPRESSION: Supine view of the entire abdomen and upright view of the upper abdomen show no evidence of intestinal obstruction or perforation.
Two large bore peripheral IVs were placed, blood was typed and crossmatched but pt did not require transfusion as serial Hct was stable.
BP was maintained with IVF with central venous pressure monitoring, and once CVP >12, norepiphrine was administered to maintain MAP >65.
Arterial line for BP monitoring was placed and central venous line for CVP monitoring and medication infusion was placed.
Pt received volume resuscitation with IVF to goal CVP 12 and then norepiphrine was administered to keep MAP goal >65.
A cosyntropin stim test showed relative adrenal insufficiency, so stress dose hydrocortisone was administered.
# Respiratory failure: history of developing respiratory failure after hematemesis suggests aspiration of bloody gastric contents, although admission cxr not impressive for pna.
