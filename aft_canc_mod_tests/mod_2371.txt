GRAM STAIN (Final [**2163-5-3**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2163-5-6**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
Red blood cells are normochromic and normocytic with anisopoikilocytosis including frequent burr cells, occasional elliptocytes, and macrocytes are seen.
The white blood cell count appears normal.
A subset of lymphocytes are atypical and display a cleaved nuclear morphology.
Platelet count appears normal and giant forms are not seen.
Aspirate Smear:  The aspirate material is suboptimal for evaluation due to paucity of spicules.
A  500 cell differential shows:  1% Blasts,  2% Promyelocytes, 6% Myelocytes, 5% Metamyelocytes, 30% Bands/Neutrophils, 1% Plasma cells,  35% Lymphocytes, 20% Erythroid.
It consists of a 0.9 cm core biopsy, trabecular marrow with a cellularity of over 90%.
[**4-24**] Peritoneal Fluid flow Cytometry FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING  The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR, FMC-7, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 3, 5, 10, 19, 20, 23, 45.
FISH analyses of interphase nuclei with the IGH@/BCL2 and MYC probes were interpreted as ABNORMAL for the IGH@/BLC2 probes, consistent with rearrangement of these loci with an additional fusion signal seen.
FISH DETAILS: FISH evaluation for an IGH@-BCL2 rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the LSI IGH@/BCL2 Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for IGH@ at 14q32 and BCL2 at 18q21 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
FISH evaluation for a MYC rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the LSI MYC Dual Color Break Apart Rearrangement Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 8q24 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
These FISH tests were developed and their performance determined by the [**Hospital1 18**] Cytogenetics Laboratory as required by the CLIA '[**38**] regulations.
B cells are scant in number precluding evaluation of clonality.
[**2163-5-4**] CXR In comparison with study of [**5-1**], there has been placement of a left Pleurx catheter with removal of substantial amount of pleural fluid.
One Light's criteria was met but was borderline (Pleural fluid protein / Serum protein >0.5), likely c/w exudate [**1-20**] lymphoma.
# Lymphoma - Paracentesis from [**Location (un) 620**] showed cells c/w follicular lymphoma, his lymph node biopsy was also c/w follicular lymphoma.
CT torso from [**Location (un) 620**] showed substantial lymphadenopathy throughout the abdomen.
Tumor lysis labs were followed and the patient was provided aggressive hydration.
Bone marrow biopsy performed [**4-24**] was consistent with follicular lymhpoma.
He underwent three diagnostic and therapeutic paracenteses during his hospital stay, the first two on the floor and the third with IR-guidance and removal of 4L ascitic fluid.
# Lower extremity edema (L>R) - ultrasound of the LLE ([**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]) showed no DVT.
CT showed massive abdominal and pelvic lymphadenopathy that likely caused venous compression leading to asymmetric edema.
Repeat RLE USS also showed no evidence of DVT.
#Paroxysmal AVT - Patient had multiple episodes of SVT to the 170s during his time in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Analysis of the fluid was consistent with follicular lymphoma, and no other malignant or infectious process was identified.
We made the following changes to your medications:  STOPPED -Valsartan  STARTED -Escitalopram for anxiety -Acyclovir and Bactrim to prevent infections -Metoprolol for blood pressure and heart rate -Senna and Sodium Docusate to help move your bowels -Ondansetron for nausea  Please continue taking your other medications as usual.
