If there is clinical concern for acute infarct, MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is recommended  MRI/MRA [**1-17**]: 1.
CT Perfusion [**1-21**]: No evidence of hemorrhage on head CT. CT perfusion demonstrates a large area of delayed time to peak without large abnormality on blood volume indicative of a large area of ischemia with a small area of infarct.
Over the course of 24 hours her exam fluctuated from expressive aphasia and plegia of the R arm to mild word finding difficulties and almost full strength of the right arm.
She had an MRI and MRA which showed a L MCA watershed infarct and very tight L MCA branch.
Her SBP was kept elevated with Neo.
Her LDL was 92 and her A1c was 5.6.
After a few days, her exam remained labile and a CT perfusion was done to evaluate the extent of her penumbra.
Her INR remained low on coumadin of 2mg [**Last Name (LF) 244**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] her dose was increased to 4 mg daily on [**1-29**].
On the day of discharge her hematocrit was 23.4 up from 21.8 on the previous day.
Warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO DAILY16 (Once Daily at 16): Please check frequent INR and titrate to between 2 and 3.
Most recent INR was 1.9 after getting 4mg on [**2116-12-29**].
