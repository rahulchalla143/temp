Initial workup, including an upper endoscopy and barium swallow, was unremarkable.
A CT colonography, performed in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year as a routine colorectal screening test, identified a 5 x 7 cm soft tissue mass in the region of the GE junction.
Further imaging confirmed this mass to be inseparable from the aorta and celiac axis and intimately associated with the distal esophagus and proximal stomach.
A CT scan of the chest ruled out metastatic disease to the lungs.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Pain was managed successfully with a PCA.
A CT abdomen/pelvis was performed on POD 8, demonstrating oral contrast extravasation into the LUQ in the region of the JP drain, with associated L pleural effusion and atelectasis.
An operative exploration for repair of the enterotomy was offered to the patient, who declined, and local control of the leak was managed with the existing JP drain.
Pt had a brief run of non-sustained VTach, asymptomatic, for which electrolytes were checked and cardiac enzymes were cycled (and negative).
She was noted on POD 11 to have orthostatic hypotension, Hct was found to be 22 and responded to 28 after transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs.
Repeat abdominal CT scan on POD 12 demonstrated minimal interval change.
She was transferred to the SICU with a Hct of 22, and transfused 2 units of PRBCs.
Her hemodynamics stabilized with good urine output, although her follow-up hematocrit was only 25.
During closure of her incisions, vital signs were lost and she expired on the operating room table.
