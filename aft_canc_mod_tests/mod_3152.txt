Subsequent workup including abdominal CAT, liver biopsy as well as multiple ERCPs as well as multiple interventional radiology interventions, concluded the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma at the head of the pancreas with liver metastasis as well as biliary obstruction.
During the past hospital admission patient underwent interventional radiology stenting for a biliary drain and had a routine staging chest CT prior to discharge.
Review of the CT revealed a pulmonary embolism in a proximal branch of the right pulmonary artery extending to the right lower lobe.
In the emergency department patient had a CT of the head done which showed no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass shift, shift of midline structures or enhancing masses seen.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission were temperature 99, heart rate 107, blood pressure 149/74, respiratory rate 28, O2 saturation 97% in room air.
Cardiac S1, S2, normal, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops or rubs, no elevated JVD.
On GU exam trace guaiac positive, but patient had positive hemorrhoids.
LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 138, potassium 4.1, chloride 102, bicarb 23, BUN 23, creatinine 0.8, glucose 150.
White blood count 18.9, hematocrit 30.1, platelets 431.
INR 1.2, PTT 23.9.
CEA 547, CA19-9 226,937.
CT of the chest inferior posterior margin of pericardium with a 7 to 8 mm nodular density.
The impression of the CT was that intraluminal filling defects within the pulmonary artery branches to both the right middle lobe and right lower lobe were consistent with pulmonary emboli.
CT of the abdomen multiple low attenuation lesions of the liver, low attenuation of the head of the pancreas.
CT of the head no intracranial or extracranial hemorrhage, no metastasis.
EKG sinus rhythm, rate 90 beats per minute, normal axis, no ST-T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2161-3-6**] patient had a head CT, no metastasis to the head, no intracranial or extracranial hemorrhage.
Additionally, interventional radiology saw the patient and took him to the IR suite for evaluation of his stent.
This evaluation revealed a patent common bile duct, however, a new diagnosis of stenosis proximal to the common bile duct stent was seen.
Secondary to the concern for retroperitoneal bleed/tumor bleeding/any further bleeding, CT of the abdomen was done stat to evaluate patient's abdomen.
The results of the CT abdomen showed again liver with numerous hypodense lesions consistent with metastasis, but there were no signs of intrahepatic ductal dilatation, no evidence of hemorrhage of the liver lesions and no evidence of bleeding into the abdomen/retroperitoneal area.
In addition, patient's white blood count increased from 19 to 28 and there was question of whether this was a stress response versus infection.
In the early morning of [**2161-3-9**] (2:00 to 4:00 a.m.) the patient became febrile to 101.7, blood pressure 90/40, heart rate in the 140s, respiratory rate 26, O2 saturation 96% in room air.
Blood cultures times two were drawn, patient began to be aggressively hydrated with fluids and patient was started on empiric ampicillin/levofloxacin/Flagyl for triple antibiotic coverage.
Patient's respiratory rate began to increase greatly to the upper 30s and an ABG was drawn.
Lactic acid level was 5.7.
EKG was done which showed sinus tachycardia, no ST-T wave changes.
Patient's CVP, urine output were followed and the goal CVP was between 12 and 14.
In addition, lactate, bicarb, hematocrit, urine output were followed closely.
The impression at this time was that patient had blood causing a blood clot which subsequently obstructed his biliary drainage, caused biliary fluid to back up causing ascending cholangitis and subsequent sepsis.
On the initial cholangiogram that was done there was a question of whether there was a biliary tract fistula with one of the pleural vessels.
However, on cholangiogram done on [**2161-3-9**] any apparent fistulous tracts were not identified.
White blood count began to decrease.
Blood cultures at this time showed initially a question of gram positive rods.
Biliary catheter appeared to be obstructed by a blood clot.
Patient's heparin was discontinued and patient was taken to interventional radiology for a tube check (cholangiogram) to check for effective drainage.
Additionally, blood cultures that were drawn on [**2161-3-9**] returned as Enterococcus with sensitivities and identifications still pending.
Patient's hematocrit was checked b.i.d.
There was a question of whether patient may need to have a repeat embolization if he continued to bleed or if there was another fistulous tract not identified.
Patient's coags were checked and INR was between 1.8 to 2.0, so he was not started on heparin and not started on Lovenox.
Levofloxacin was discontinued as the sensitivities from the cultures were back.
On [**2161-3-14**] the patient's hematocrit was checked b.i.d.
Vital signs were stable.
INR was 1.8.
hematocrit was checked.
Vital signs were stable.
INR was 1.4.
Hematocrit was checked b.i.d.
Subsequent to his embolization on [**2161-3-11**], there had not been any apparent episodes of bleeding in his biliary drainage bag and it appeared that the source of the bleeding had stopped.
Cholangiogram revealed good patency of the stent and no communication between the biliary ducts and any vessels.
The patient was hypotensive (blood pressure 90/50) tachycardiac to 140, respiratory rate in the 30s, lactate 5.6.
Blood cultures as well as biliary culture revealed Enterococcus faecalis sensitive to ampicillin, resistant to levofloxacin.
The patient's amylase and lipase were checked serially throughout his admission.
While he was in-house patient was hydrated aggressively with 125 cc of normal saline per hour while his enzymes were elevated.
Head CT was without metastasis or hemorrhage.
The patient's creatinine was within normal limits.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  If the patient starts having bloody stools, fever greater than 100.5, fast heart rate greater than 110, chills/sweating or dizziness with standing/walking, please go to the nearest emergency department.
Hematocrit is stable times four days (29 to 30) with two days on Lovenox.
Had a blood clot in the stent leading to accumulation (no drainage) of biliary fluid.
