Please note that CT does not provide intrathecal details comparable to MRI.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**2175-9-10**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Acute fractures involving L1 and L2 vertebra with superior endplate compression and associated retropulsion resulting in at least mild central canal stenosis.
CT T & L spine [**2175-9-12**] IMPRESSION:  1.
Fractures of T11 through L3, as described above.
Thoracic spine MRI with STIR images may be helpful to exclude additional subtle vertebral body compression fractures.
His spine fractures were managed non operatively; he was fitted for a TLSO brace which needs to be worn when out of bed at all times.
There was an incidental finding on CT imaging of the chest/abdomen which revealed bilateral adrenal nodules, which were incompletely characterized.
These statistically represent adenomas and further evaluation with CT or MRI may be obtained on a non-emergent basis.

You will need to follow up with your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]e from rehab for an incidental finding on your chest CT scan which revealed bilateral adrenal nodules.
A repeat CT scan on a non-urgent basis is being recommended.
