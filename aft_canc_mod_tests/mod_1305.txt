At that time, his blood pressure was 190/90 with a heart rate of 120 and a chest x-ray demonstrated florid congestive heart failure.
His blood pressure decreased to 80 to 90 systolic and the Nitroglycerin drip was weaned off.
Vital signs revealed heart rate 69, blood pressure 153/56, oxygen saturation 98% on 30% FIO2.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - The pupils are normally reactive, extraocular movements are intact.
Neck - positive jugular venous pressure to the jaw, neck supple.
Extremities - 2 to 3+ edema, dorsalis pedis pulses dopplerable bilaterally.
Right radial pulse is 1+, left radial pulse dopplerable.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 19.9, hematocrit 33.3, platelets 294,000, with differential of 89.2 neutrophils, 11.4 lymphocytes, 2.4 monocytes.
Sodium 137, potassium 3.8, chloride 93, bicarbonate 35, blood urea nitrogen 21, creatinine 1.1, glucose 154.
CK 156, calcium 7.8, phosphorus 4.0, magnesium 1.9.
INR 1.4.
Electrocardiogram ([**Hospital1 2025**]) showed sinus tachycardia at 110 beats per minute, primary AV block, premature atrial contractions and premature ventricular contractions, ST depressions in V4 through V6, Q wave in V1 and V2, T wave inversions in leads I and aVL.
Electrocardiogram on admission revealed sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute, normal axis, first degree AV block, Q waves in V1 and V2, T wave inversions in leads I, II, aVL, V4 through V6, ST depressions of 1.0 millimeter in V4 through V6.
Chest x-ray - congestive heart failure, nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube in place, left costophrenic angle with blunting.
His cardiac enzymes remained flat and electrocardiogram without changes, and therefore it was felt that the patient did not experience an acute ischemic event that triggered his congestive heart failure and therefore his Heparin drip was discontinued.
A cholesterol panel was checked and the patient was started on Lipitor.
The patient's blood pressure remained stable with a systolic blood pressure in the 130s.
Pulmonary - The patient was intubated at the time of arrival and his ventilator settings included SIMV, pressure support 10, PEEP 7.5, FIO2 30%, tidal volume 700 with a respiratory rate of 13.
However, the patient responded to this change with tachycardia, tachypnea and hypertension with a systolic blood pressure in the 200s.
The arterial blood gases obtained at that time demonstrated pH 7.25/81/71.
The patient was reintubated with a subsequent arterial blood gas of 7.45/51/163.
In addition, a CT scan of the chest obtained at that time also demonstrated partial collapse of the left upper lobe secondary to an obstructing [**Location (un) 21851**] as well as bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement, enlargement of both adrenal glands concerning for metastatic disease, and evidence of previous asbestos exposure with pleural plaques.
Therefore, given the combination of the patient's failure to wean off the ventilator, as well as the left upper lobe lung mass, a bronchoscopy was performed which revealed partial bronchial stenosis distally without intervention required as well as a left middle lobe and left lower lobe mass of which brushings and endobronchial biopsy were taken.
In addition, a thoracentesis was offered to the patient given the pleural effusion seen on CT scan, however, this was refused by the patient until he could discuss it further with his wife.
A thoracentesis was performed on [**2104-3-2**], which demonstrated a white blood cell count of 75, red blood cells 1,980, 27 polys, 33 monocytes, glucose 232, LDH 86.
Over the next few hospital days, the patient was attempted on a slow wean by decreasing his pressure support from 15 to 10 and then to 5.
Renal - The patient's creatinine was followed closely given his history of chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine of approximately 1.0 to 1.3.
His urine output was followed closely while the patient was diuresed aggressively at the initiation of his hospital stay.
The patient's creatinine remained stable despite diuresis and despite initiation of an ace inhibitor and was maintained at approximately 1.0 to 1.2 over the remainder of his hospital stay.
The patient's white blood cell count remained within normal limits and he remained afebrile at the time of discharge.
The patient had no growth in his urine or blood culture sent during the time of admission.
Hematologic - The patient's hematocrit was followed and was found to be low and remained relatively stable over the course of the hospital stay.
A colonoscopy was discussed, however, this was refused by the patient and his wife.
The patient's hematocrit did drop very slowly at one point, approximately one point per day, and he was transfused a unit of blood cells with an appropriate bump in his hematocrit which remained stable at approximately 31 to 32 over the remainder of the hospital stay.
Oncology - The patient was noted to have a mass in the left upper lobe on CT scan at the time of admission.
When the patient underwent bronchoscopy secondary to failure to wean and failure at extubation, an endobronchial lesion was seen and bronchial washings and biopsy were obtained.
Pathology of the biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma and, given that the CT scan showed a mass in the bilateral adrenals, it was felt that this was likely metastatic.
The biopsy results were discussed with the patient's wife given that the patient was sedated and intubated at this time.
A hematology/oncology consultation was obtained who suggested that given the patient's underlying poor function, he was not a candidate for palliative chemotherapy and given that the patient's family did not want to investigate the extent of the metastasis, there was no further metastatic workup performed.
FEN - The patient's electrolytes were checked on a daily basis and repleted as needed.
Prophylaxis - The patient was maintained on Heparin subcutaneous as well as Prevacid per his gastrostomy tube for prophylaxis during the hospital stay.
