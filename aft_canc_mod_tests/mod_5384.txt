Despite the chemotherapy, the mediastinal mass has not improved and it was felt that perhaps the area could be rebiopsied to confirm diagnosis (as first biopsy done in [**State 108**]).

Following admission, he underwent a left mainstem stent by the interventional pulmonary service on [**7-24**]; repeat bronchoscopy on [**7-27**] showed that the stent was patent and there was no need for a right mainstem stent.
The pathology was consistent with lymphoma (see attached report).
He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a repeat bronchoscopy and possible stent removal.
At time of discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 53636**]; he was provided with home oxygen for ambulation (given oxygen saturation 90% with ambulation).
2) Relative hypotension: The patient's blood pressures remained in the low 100s, possibly due to  poor intake due to nausea or IVC compression from mediastinal mass.
His blood pressure should be closely monitored as an outpatient, as his PCP may need to restart anti-hypertensive agents.
