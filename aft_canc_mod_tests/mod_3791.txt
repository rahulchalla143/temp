Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):       VIRIDANS STREPTOCOCCI.
IMAGING CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast [**2139-7-6**] Large amount of pelvic ascites is present.
CXR [**2139-7-5**] FINDINGS: The heart is normal in size.
KUB [**2139-7-6**] No gross evidence of change.
EGD [**2139-7-6**] Findings: Esophagus: Protruding Lesions 4 cords of grade II varices were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.
------------------ CT Torso [**2139-6-8**] CT Chest Thyroid and thoracic inlet appear unremarkable.
CT PELVIS Ascites as before.
CT BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion.
GI performed EGD with banding of 4 cords of non-bleeding, grade II varices that were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.
- After EGD pt was transferred from the ICU to the floor where his Hct was followed closely.
# GPC in ED blood culture, 1/4 bottles - possibly contaminant, however, pt was started on vancomycin while speciation and sensitivities were pending.
Final culture revealed S. viridans.
Cultures were obtained prior to EGD and pt has no lines of concern for infection.
Pt underwent Echo which showed no vegetations or signs of SBE.
Because all follow up cultures were negative and pt was afebrile and asymptomatic during his hospitalization the vancomycin was discontinued and he was startd on a two week course of clindamycin.
Pt responded well and had calcium of 9.1 on discharge.

When your calcium decreased to normal range and your blood counts were stable you were cleared for discharge.
The study showed no signs of any infection.
Please follow up with you primary care physician within the next week to check your blood counts and your calcium level.
Followup Instructions: Please follow/up with your primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 1 week to check hematocrit and calcium levels.
