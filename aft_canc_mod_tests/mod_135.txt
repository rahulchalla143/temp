Serial echocardiograms have revealed worsening aortic insufficiency and mitral regurgitation.
Cardiac catheterization in [**2194-5-31**] showed normal coronary arteries and an LVEF of 50%.
A transesophogeal echocardiogram in [**2194-10-31**] confirmed 3+ AI, 3+MR, with a 3x3 centimeter right atrial mass.
LVEF was estimated at 65%.
In preperation for cardiac surgery, he also underwent chest CT scan which revealed a dilated ascending aorta.
After extensive preoperative evaluation, he was admitted for cardiac surgical intervention.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more  depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The remainder of the exam is unchanged.
CXR INDICATION: Shortness of breath.
Lung volumes remain low, and cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in appearance.
His creatinine peaked to 1.7 on postoperative day two.
Over several days, his urine output and renal function improved.
His INR was to be followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] until his return to [**State 108**].
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR Friday [**2195-4-3**].
