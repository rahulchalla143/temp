MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2108-4-24**] Expected post-operative changes from subtotal resection of right  posterior fossa meningioma.
Head CT revealed no hemorrhage and almost complete resection of the mass.
On [**4-24**], her physical examination was significant for being afebrile, mild tongue deviation to the left, antigravity extremities x 4, following commands, and no drift which was her baseline.
EVD was continued at 5cmH20 and open cont with vancomycin, nafcillin & ceftazadime for prophylaxis & CSF was sent for cx, gram stain, prot & glucose.
On [**4-25**] she was transferred to the SDU for further care and her EVD was discontinued.
