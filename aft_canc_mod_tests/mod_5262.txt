ALT of 18, AST of 24, alkaline phosphatase of 119, total bilirubin of 0.7, total protein of 7.3, albumin of 4.6, globulin of 2.7, HbA1C of 5.7%.
RADIOLOGIC AND OTHER STUDIES:  Preop carotid series showed antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries and moderate plaque with bilateral 40% to 60% carotid stenoses.
Preop chest x-ray showed multifocal asbestos-related plaque with some calcified plaque in the left hemithorax with a suggestion of left atrial enlargement, but no other cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Preop EKG showed sinus rhythm at 62 with atrial premature depolarizations.
Preop echo showed an ejection fraction of greater than 60%, normal aortic root and ascending aorta.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate of 70, respiratory rate of 14, blood pressure on the right of 122/50 and on the left of 120/60, weight of 163 pounds, 5 feet and 6 inches tall.
Had no known varicosities, and his neurologic exam was grossly intact.
He had some short bursts of AFib, but was in sinus rhythm in the morning at 73 with a blood pressure of 123/48.
Postop labs as follows: K of 6.0, BUN of 16, creatinine of 0.9, white count of 16.7, PT of 14.3, with an INR of 1.4.
He was alert and oriented, and his exam was otherwise unremarkable; and he was transferred out to the floor in stable condition on an insulin drip in the morning of 0.5 units per hour.
He was in first-degree AV block at a heart rate of 65, maintaining good blood pressure.
A cardiology consult was requested for evaluation of his atrial tachycardia and first-degree AV block.
On postoperative day 3, his chest tubes had been removed.
He was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a low hematocrit, but remained hemodynamically stable as his heart rate rose to the 70s.
He went into atrial fibrillation that morning with a ventricular response rate of 57 and a systolic blood pressure of 107; was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of electrophysiology.
On postoperative day 6, he was back in atrial fibrillation but maintaining a good blood pressure of 127/58.
He had some hyperkalemia with a K of 6.0.
On postoperative day 8, he received a second dose of 5 mg of Coumadin with plans that when his INR crossed 1.5 he would be able to discharge home with VNA services.
His INR was 1.3 on postoperative day 8.
He went back into sinus rhythm and then back to atrial fibrillation on the day of discharge - [**9-30**] - with an INR of 1.8 on Coumadin therapy.
His blood pressure was 115/55, respiratory rate of 20, heart rate of 67, ventricular rate response, in atrial fibrillation, weight of 73.2 kilograms, saturating 98% on room air.
Coumadin 3 mg to be dosed of the afternoon of the 21st     and Coumadin 3 mg to be dosed on the afternoon of the     22nd with INR to be drawn by the VNA and then called to     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5017**] for continued dosing with a target INR of     2.0 to 2.5 for atrial fibrillation.
The patient was again instructed to have INR checked by VNA on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**10-2**], and call results to Dr.[**Name (NI) 44916**] office ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 5424**]) for further Coumadin dosing.
