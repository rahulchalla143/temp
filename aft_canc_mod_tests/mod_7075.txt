CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2119-4-28**] 3:24 PM Left frontal extra-axial mass with surrounding vasogenic edema and calcification.
CT angiography demonstrates some enhancement of the pial vessels in the region which could indicate supply from the pial vasculature.
The mass does appear to cause mild mass effect without midline shift  ECG Study Date of [**2119-5-4**]  8:43:14 AM  Atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular rate of 86.

Post-operative MRI brain with and without contrast [**2119-5-7**] IMPRESSION: Slight increase in hematoma in the left frontal lobe, recommend evaluation with unenhanced head CT. Small foci of acute ischemia/artifact from blood products as detailed above.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 37430**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-27**] after a seizure while at the dentist.
MRI at an OSH redemonstrated the known frontal lesion consistent with a meningioma.
Surgical intervention was recommended and possible XRT if pathology was atypical  His hospital course was otherwise uneventful.
The post-operative head CT was performed consistent with expected post operative changes.
the blood pressure paremeters were libralized to allow SBP 100-160.
His neuro exam continued to wax and wane.
a standing order for tylenol was wriiten and LFTs were ordered for the morning which were unremarkable.
The patient was Triggered for heart rate in 120s.
The patient's serum BUN elevated at 29 from the day prior at 24.
A post operative MRI of the Brain was performed which was consistent with a small foci of acute ischemia versus artifact along the medial and posterior portions of the left frontal lobe.
You will need a CT scan of the brain with contrast.
