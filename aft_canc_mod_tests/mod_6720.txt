Due to  abdominal discomfort, she recently underwent a RUQ ultrasound which showed multiple solid lesions in the liver, the largest being 14 cm.
Chest CT in [**2-24**] demonstrated no evidence of lung metastases.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a cavernous hemangioma in the left lateral segment which was unchanged and had been seen before.
MRI of the brain was negative.
A bone scan demonstrated no evidence for osseous metastatic disease.
Cardiac echo was normal.
Needle biopsy of the liver demonstrated poorly-differentiated carcinoma consistent with a breast carcinoma.
Following referral to [**Hospital1 18**], triphasic CT confirmed disease in the right lobe of the liver as well as medial segment and caudate lobe.

An ultrasound of the liver was obtained which showed the left portal vein with normal flow and waveform.
Repeat ultrasound indicated no flow problems to the liver.
Ct of the abdomen was unremarkable, not showing any fluid collections and having normal post surgical/ablation changes.
A head CT did not show any acute abnormality.
AST and ALT were at their maximum on POD 1 and 2 and trended down but not normalized by day of discharge.
The Total bili continued to climb throughout the hospitalization with maximum value of 19.6 on POD 21.
She was tolerating a regular diet at discharge and calorie counts revealed an average caloric intake around 1700 calories.
The Roux tube was capped on POD 19 following a cholangiogram demonstrating no evidence of leak.
The bilirubin took a small jump but did not return to its former elevated value of 19.
