Compared to the previous tracing of [**2192-11-8**] the ST-T wave changes are slightly more apparent and the other findings are similar.
[**2193-1-29**] EKG : rate 58-60, Baseline artifact.
ADDITIONAL IMAGING STUDIES: [**2193-1-19**] CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS W/O CONTRAST: 1.
[**2193-1-23**] CXR : New right picc line with tip in proximal svc.
[**2193-1-24**] CT ABD/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: Visualized portions of the lung bases are unchanged from the previous study.
Scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are visualized, none of which meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
This finding along with the enlarging pneumoperitoneum is indicative of a perforation, likely at the sigmoid colon.
[**2193-1-30**] CT CHEST : FINDINGS: The previously seen scattered ground-glass opacities, predominantly within the right lung have resolved.
This examination was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
[**2193-2-6**] PA ans LAT CXR: PA and lateral upright chest radiograph were compared to [**2193-1-29**] and chest CT from [**2193-1-30**].
[**2193-2-9**] CT ABD AND PELVIS: IMPRESSION: 1.
Portions of the fluid collection do appear amenable to percutaneous aspiration/drainage.
CT scan from yesterday showed a left pericolic abscess.
Laboratory values checked, INR was initially elevated, fresh frozen plasma was used to lower this to 1.5.
Under CT fluoroscopic guidance, a 10 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter was placed in the left pericolic abscess.
[**2193-2-15**] CT ABD & PELVIS W/OUT CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: 1.
Opacification of the Hartmann pouch shows no evidence of contrast leakage into the adjacent fluid collection.

CT of abdomen/pelvis at time of admission had showed small amount of pneumoperitoneum anteriorly and also around the liver.
Though she initially responded quite well to the IV antibiotics with significant improvement in her abdominal pain for the first [**2-19**] days, he patient's abdominal pain & overall appearance worsened on hospital day #4, and it was clear that she needed to be taken to the operating room for a exploratory laparotomy.
Repeat imaging confirmed perforated sigmoid diverticulum.
She was given FFP, Vitamoin K to correct her INR of 8, and 1 unit of PRBC and taken to the operating room.
On CT of the abdomen she was found to have loculated fluid collections which required post-operative IR drainage and a JP drain was left in place.
For enteric broad coverage she was started on Zosyn, Vancomycin, Caspofungin, and Gentamicin and her abdominal fluid grew pseudomonas which was fortunately sensitive to multiple agents.
A repeat CT was done on [**2193-2-21**] to assess interval changes and it appeared that there was continued decrease in size of the left flank and pelvic collections, Hartmann pouch showed no evidence of leak, and she also had complete resolution of bilateral mild hydronephrosis.
After this reassuring CT study the surgical team removed her one remaining JP drain on her left abdomen.
A repeat CT was set-up a few days prior to this appointment to allow for final review for any recurrent abscesses or collections prior to final removal of PICC and antibiotic discontinuance.
# History of AML: The patient's hematologic/oncology history dates back to fall [**2190**] after routine labs indicated persistent pancytopenia.
She had an initial bone marrow biopsy with myelodysplasia with no cytogenetic abnormalities and additional workup that was most consistent with MDS.
A repeat bone marrow biopsy showed acute erythroleukemia and she was diagnosed with AML.
Iron studies showed that she was not iron deficient.
Hematocrit at admission was 43 and she had nadir to 25-27 range and by time of discharge her hematocrit was back to 31-33 range consistently and she had no signs of any active bleeding.
A CT from [**2193-1-30**] showed new focal opacities in the RUL.
Blood cultures during her hospitalization were all negative.
# Coronary Artery Disease:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had history of CAD with prior inferior STEMI in [**5-/2192**] for which she underwent RCA stenting, and later had an endoscopic CABG x1.
#Hypertension: Metoprolol dose was decreased to metoprolol tartrate 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] as her blood pressure well controlled on this regimen and she was bradycardic at night when on a higher dose.
Post-surgery she was monitored with serial EKGs, and continuous telemetry and she was eventually converted back to NSR with Amiodarone therapy.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) 24712**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1568**]2 is normally exercise and diet controlled.
She had well controlled fasting and prandial fingersticks which required minimal to no SSI coverage.
At the time of discharge her LFTs were back to normal ranges with AST 39, ALT 33, ALP 82, LDH 199,  and total bilirubin 0.4. .
Discharge Disposition: Home with Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] of [**Location (un) 583**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Diverticulitis -Perforated sigmoid colon -Intra-abdominal abscess -Post-op hypotension-managed with fluid boluses -Post-op Atrial fibrillation-managed with IV to PO Amiodarone and Lopressor -Post-op fever/pneumonia managed with IV antibiotics -Post-op hyperglycemia-managed with insulin -Post-op fluid volume overload-managed with IV Lasix -Pneumonia -RSV .
At time of discharge the patient was tolerating a diabetic/heart healthy/low sodium diet well and her vital signs were stable.
Please call your doctor or return to the ER if you have abdominal pains, diarrhea, bloody stool or discolored stool in your colostomy, new chest pain, chest pressure, chest tightness, cough , wheezing, vomiting, fevers, chills or any new concerning symptoms.
Monitoring Ostomy Output/Prevention of Dehydration: -Keep well hydrated -Replace fluid loss from ostomy daily.

-If Ostomy output >1.5 liters in 24hrs, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
