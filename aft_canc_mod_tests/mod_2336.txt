Patient reports breathing is at his baseline though Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital1 **] sent patient to ED for evaluation considering PNA vs PE.
CTA negative for PE but did show b/l upper lobe opacities consistent with an early PNA vs. aspiration.

CTA Chest [**2168-2-5**] No PE or acute aortic syndrome.
RUQ US [**2168-2-5**]: Limited exam due to poor acoustic penetration.
CXR [**2168-2-5**]: Stable band-like opacity in the left lower lung is most compatible with chronic atelectasis.
Limited study without definite signs for acute interval changes.
MRCP [**2168-2-6**]: 1.
-Large amount of blood clots, tumor.necrotic tissues were extracted successfully using a balloon.
Chest x-ray [**2168-2-8**]: IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2-5**]: Greater opacification at the base of the left lung could be worsened atelectasis or developing pneumonia, either of which can be attributed to aspiration.
Lung volumes are low on the right, but not as severely and without focal consolidation.
ERCP [**2168-2-9**]: -A large blood clot was visible at the major papilla.
-Multiple irregular filling defects were noted in the CBD, the right and left hepatic ducts, the cystic duct and the gall bladder consistent with blood clots.
-Balloon sweeps were performed and large amounts o f blood clots were extracted from the bile duct -Due to the presence of blood in the biliary duct and due to the possibility of further bleeding, it was decided to place stents in the bile duct.
Video Swallow [**2168-2-10**]: Video oropharyngeal evaluation was performed in collaboration with speech and swallow therapist.

# Pneumonia: CTA showed new bilateral upper lobe opacities, concerning for early pneumonia vs. aspiration, no history of prior aspiration or concern from nursing at [**Hospital1 **] that he has been aspirating.
Respiratory status improved and on discharge, patient was had O2 sats in the mid 90s on rooma air.
Labs consistent with possible gallbladder pathology, elevated alk phos and t-bili compared to his admission 1 month ago where he had similar pain, however RUQ negative for cholecystitis.
Repeat ERCP was done and 2 stents were placed.
# Hyponatremia: PT was mildly hyponatremic to 129, urine electrolytes with fairly high osms but Na is 32.
Appeared dry on exam so there was likely a component of hypovolemia, additionally since he is on chronic steroids and currently stressed could be adreanl insufficiency.
AST/ALT werestable from his most recent admission, with no evidence of decompensation, no ascites on RUQ or encephalopathy will continue to monitor MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] LFT's.
Interval follow-up of this lesion on subsequent imaging study is recommended.
You had two ERCP procedures while here and stents were placed to open your bile system.
The x-ray to evaluate your swallowing showed that you were swallowing well, but need some accomodations to your diets: soft solids and crushed meds along with sitting upright while eating.
