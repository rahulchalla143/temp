This should be correlated with the recent surgery and if it cannot be explained by the surgery, further evaluation with CT can be performed to assess for perforation.
Unchanged bilateral retropharyngeal and masticator space lesions, with cystic/necrotic changes on the right side, previously demonstrated by neck CT on [**2108-7-19**], likely related with a history of hypopharyngeal cancer.

Left basal ganglia lacunes, age-related involution and mild small vessel ischemic disease.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-8-29**], a PFO is now detected.
[**2108-9-20**] CTA NECK IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2108-9-25**] CXR FINDINGS:Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of [**2108-9-10**].
The on previous examination identified paratracheal air and subcutaneous air in the left lower neck region, indicative of pneumomediastinum at that time, cannot be seen anymore.

MRI confirmed CVA suggestive of thromboembolism.
TTE showed no evidence of clot.
Repeat TTE with bubble study revealed a PFO and LE doppler U/S showed a RLE DVT.
A rechallenge with anticoagulation failed a second time due to bleeding from his tumor and trach site.
A loading dose (400mg/m2) of cetuximab was given [**2108-10-3**] and radiation started [**2108-10-10**] and will continue for 6 weeks total.
Post-op CXR was performed, which showed pneumomediastinum; this was not unexpected given recent open procedure.
Repeat CXR showed no change in pneumomediastinum.
LLL pneumonia on CXR treated initially with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole due to concern for aspiration.
CXR [**2108-8-21**] and [**2108-8-26**] showed worsening infiltrate, so abx changed to meropenem with vancomycin [**2108-8-26**], finished [**2108-9-3**].
# Zoster: VZV culture positive.
CTA [**2108-9-20**] showed soft-tissue swelling around the trach, but no active bleed.
# CVA/PFO: Left face drooping seen [**2108-8-28**]; MRI positive for CVA, likely embolic.
TTE negative for clot.
Repeat TTE with bubble study showed a PFO.
LE doppler U/S showed a RLE DVT, possible  source of CVA and [**Last Name (un) **] (paradoxical emboli).

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a biopsy of a tumor in your throat (hypopharynx).
The tumor biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) and you were transferred to the Oncology floor to start chemotherapy.
MRI of the brain did not show any cancer in the brain.
Video swallow evaluation showed severe aspiration of food and liquids.
All of your blood counts became very low from the chemotherapy.
The stroke likely originated from a blood clot in the right leg that traveled in the blood stream and passed through a hole in the heart (patent foramen ovale) and then into the brain and kidney also causing some kidney damage.
However, this was complicated by bleeding and the blood thinner was not able to be restarted.
Culture confirmed this was shingles.
As radiation therapy continues, your cough may worsen and require more suctioning.
