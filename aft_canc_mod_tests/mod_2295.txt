He also had noted enlarging groin lymph nodes, which he thought was related to a urinary tract infection.
He then presented to the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department where he was found to have a white count of 430,000 with 94% blasts.
His platelet count was 40,000 and the patient did have a normal head CT there.
His white count did decrease to 296,000 on hydroxyurea.
Blood pressure 130 to 145/50 to 60.
Heart rate 71.
Respiratory rate 11.
His HEENT examination is significant for periorbital ecchymosis over the right orbit with scleral hemorrhage evident in the right eye.
His neck showed large approximately 8 cm nodes in the anterior cervical region as well as submental cervical nodes.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
His groin revealed some inguinal adenopathy bilaterally as well as right pressure dressing was intact with a Quinton catheter had been for phoresis.
Neurological examination reveals a central blind spot only in the right eye with maintained peripheral vision.
His cranial nerves are otherwise intact with motor examination revealing 5 out of 5 strength in all four extremities.
LABORATORIES ON PRESENTATION FROM [**Hospital3 **]:  White blood cell count [**Pager number **] with a hematocrit of 26.3, platelets of 30.
Chem 7 notable for a creatinine of 1.8 and a potassium of 2.4.
His LDH was elevated at 3950.
His alkaline phosphatase was elevated at 231.
In addition, after several days in the Intensive Care Unit laboratories upon transfer to Four [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] are as follows:  White blood cell count 0.8, hematocrit 21.7, platelets 27, chem 7 was normal and notable for a creatinine of 0.7, INR of 1.7, PT 15.9, PTT 26.7.
Acute leukemia:  Because of the high white count of 430,000, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for acute phoresis for management of leukostasis.
He maintained O2 saturations in the low 90s on room air and had to be placed on 2 liters.
He had O2 saturations on the fourth hospital day in the 80s on 50% FIO2 face mask.
However, after some diuresis the patient responded very well with brisk urine output and room air sats of approximately 95%.
The patient had a good response to chemotherapy and his white blood cell count decreased.
Fever and neutropenia:  At this time the patient's blood cultures have been entirely negative.
An initial blood culture, which was showing a gram stain positive for gram positive coxae was retracted due to negative confirmatory test in the microbiology laboratory.
Acute renal failure:  Again as stated the patient presented with a creatinine of 1.8, which is felt to be due to lysis on kidney.
