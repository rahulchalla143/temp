Per reports, never had colonoscopy prior to NEBH colonscopy which showed  blood in colon although repeat colonoscopy on [**2145-5-13**] showed no blood.
Tagged red cell scan showed area of bleeding in sigmoid colon.
She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible embolization but upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] the patient was hemodynamically stable with hcts 28.5 and 27.5 over 12 hours so IR thought it would be unlikely they would find a bleed at this point as it appeared she was not bleeding profusely any longer.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], and her HCP, [**Name (NI) 1494**], all involved feel we have exhausted reasonable measures to stop the bleeding and we will focus on comfort care now.
CXR in am in ICU showed slight volume overload and fullness in right hilum.
CT scan was defered as goals of care are focused on comfort.
