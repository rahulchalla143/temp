Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2120-11-20**] - minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy   History of Present Illness: The patient is an 83-year-old gentleman referred to the thoracic multidisciplinary clinic by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for an evaluation of newly diagnosed esophageal cancer.
In the setting of a knee infection five years ago, he underwent a surveillance endoscopy that according to the patient showed [**Last Name (un) **] esophagus.
The patient did undergo an endoscopy at [**Hospital 27034**] Hospital that showed long segment Barrett's of approximately 12 cm in length.
A repeat upper endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasound was performed.
Endoscopic ultrasound revealed a mass at this area that involved the musculus propria.
There were two small but suspicious appearing periesophageal lymph nodes and therefore endoscopic ultrasound stage was T2N1.
Of note, biopsy nor FNA of the suspicious lymph node was performed during this procedure, as the lymph node was adjacent to the area of mucosal abnormality.
Subsequently, the patient underwent a PET CT scan here at [**Hospital1 18**], performed [**2120-10-19**].
The CT showed no obvious mass in esophagus.
However, there was noted to be a mass in the left upper quadrant adjacent to the splenic flexure with an SUV of 17.5.
In addition there was left iliac node with an SUV of 33.4.
