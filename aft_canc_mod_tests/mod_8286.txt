Pre-operatively: Her imaging was uploaded and reviewed with one of the radiology fellows.
Her tumor markers came back with a very elevated CEA of 206.
They recommended a sigmoidoscopy, which revealed no explanation for the pelvic mass.
She therefore underwent a colonoscopy, which also demonstrated no explanation for the lasrge pelvic mass seen on CT scan.
On [**5-22**], she underwent a laparascopy, which was converted to an open laparatomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, bowel resection x 2 with reanastomosis and repair of anterior bladder wall defect.
On [**2138-6-7**], her urine output decreased to zero for several hours, she was persistently hypotensive throughout the day.
