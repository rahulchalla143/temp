He has transfusion-dependent MDS, which did not respond to 3 months of Dacogen, and receives platelet transfusions  M/W/F and blood 2-3 units/week.
At that time, he was transfused platelets and had a HCT of 30.
He had a repeat CBC, which showed a HCT 22 and Plt 8, so the patient was admitted to the hospital.
HCT drawn after the first unit of pRBCs showed a drop from 22.4 to 20.1.
MDS on dacogen - presented in [**2143-9-28**] with pancytopenia, complained of dyspnea on exertion - cytopenias progressed and he had a repeat bone marrow done in [**1-4**] which showed a markedly hypercellular bone marrow with significant dysplasia in the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.
Flow cytometry demonstrated CD-34-positive cells comprised 4-5% of total blast gated events.
Cytogenetics revealed [**11-16**] cells have abnormal chromosome 12 and an abnormal chromosome 17 in a possible three way translocation.
- refractory to Procrit, at escalating doses and then became red blood cell transfusion dependent - Decitabine therapy was initiated [**2145-9-13**] but had to be discontinued due to a hematoma which developed at the site of a wound.
CT scan demonstrated perigastric adenopathy and EGD had a multilobulated mass with ulceration.
- Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated mildly hypercellular marrow for age with megakaryocytic dysplasia and occasional ringed sideroblasts (10%) without evidence of lymphoma.
