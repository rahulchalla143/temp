Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections using a 5 French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast injections.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by a member of the nursing staff.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI 3 flow.
Arterial time = 0 hour51 minutes.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic aortic normotension with an SBP of 126 mmHg.
Successful ptca and stenting of the proximal in-stent restenotic LAD lesion with a 3.0x16mm taxus stent which was post-dilated to 3.5mm.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow (see ptca comments).
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**Name11 (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].
ATTENDING STAFF: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] P.   ([**Numeric Identifier 105015**])      Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 71 year old diabetic male with h/o CAD s/p DES x2 to mid/proximal LAD, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presents with 2 days of chest pain, positive enzymes.
Patient underwent cardiac catheterization and a drug eluting stent was placed in his LAD (full report attached).
Post MI echo was significant for depressed left ventricular systolic function (LVEF= 40%) with apical akinesis, without obvious thrombosis.
During the hospital course, after cardiac catheterization, patient developed mild respiratory distress with O2 saturation as low as 85% however without subjective feelings of shortness of breath or changes in mental status.
We suggest further workup as out patient with sleep studies to rule out obstructive sleep apnea.
