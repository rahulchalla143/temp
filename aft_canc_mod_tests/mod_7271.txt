After transfusion with 2U pRBCs on admission, hematocrit became stable at 30 for >84 hours.
EGD revealed esophageal narrowing from 20 cm to 25 cm with focal superficial ulceration and granulation tissue.
There was a small amount of red blood oozing from this site.
The previous biopsies from the esophageal ulcers taken during the last admission were not diagnostic of esophageal cancer.
The current biopsy revealed no evidence of cancer as well.
They all finally agreed not to pursue endoscopic ultrasound with biopsies.
