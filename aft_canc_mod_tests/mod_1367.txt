Laboratories revealed hypercalcemia (14-15) and ARF (Cre 1.5; b/l 1.0), for which she was given calcitonin and IV fluids.
Head CT was negative for bleed but CT scan of the C-spine showed a C7 compression fracture (unclear if old or new).
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Abdominal U/S and CT revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes, likely a recurrence of her Hodgkin's disease.
MRI of the head was deferred and patient's mental status has improved with treatment.
