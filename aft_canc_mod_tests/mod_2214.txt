In the ED, he was still found to be unresponsive with the following vital signs: T 101.3, HR 144, SBP 72, RR44.
Initial WBC was 3.1 with 12% bands; eventually the count rose to 13.1 with 44% bands.
His sputum grew unspeciated yeast; gram stain showed rare squamous cells, few polys, few yeast, and no bacteria.
Otherwise, urine, sputum, and CSF cultures were negative for any growth.
Initial workup at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital included a negative head CT. LP at the OSH with traumatic tap had 3 WBCs in tube #4.
Gram stain and CSF cultures were negative for microrganisms and growth.
Coagulation labs were elevated on admission with PT 22.8 and PTT 130.0.
There was evidence of schistocytes on peripheral blood smear.
Prior to transfer to the ICU, the patient was panscanned; head CT at the OSH showed multiple areas of bilateral hypoattenuation.
A 2nd CT scan from the OSH demonstrated multiple brain lesions, some located in watershed areas, but no evidence of increased intracranial pressure.
Chest CT had large, dependent consolidations with air bronchograms and multiple foci of airspace opacity.
The patient was noted to have stable blood pressure on pressor support.
Vital signs in the ICU were the following: Tm 102.2 HR 97 BP 100/54 RR 31 96%O2 sat ABG 7.35/35/96 on AC.
Breath sounds were decreased at the bases.
Cardiac and abdominal exam were unremarkable.
Pupil equal round reactive to light, doll's eyes showed no movement, he was non responsive to painful stimuli, and had minimal corneal or gag reflexes.
A head MRI was performed to better evaluate the brain lesions.
Neuro exam @ OSH w/ evidence of brainstem findings, however, here, pt?????
Blood pressure was stable through most of MICU course.
Cultures at OSH and here were unrevealing, including tests for histoplasmosis, cryptococcus, and nocardia.
Creatinine trended down close to baseline while treated in the ICU.

[**11-29**] MRI head - The MR [**First Name (Titles) 29765**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4059**] areas of abnormal increased signal intensity on the FLAIR and fast spin-echo images that were seen as hypodense areas on the CT scan.
However, the remainder of the lesions are not locations typical for this etiology.The magnetic resounance arteriography study [**Last Name (Titles) 4059**] no significant abnormalities.
The bilateral globus pallidus involvement would suggest global hypoxia or hypoperfusion.
[**11-29**] Echo TEE - no vegetations, no sign of endocarditis The left atrium is normal in size.
[**11-30**] Portable Abd Xray The distribution of bowel gas is unremarkable.
The diaphragms and upper abdomen are not included on the film.
Please refer to the detailed Speech Pathology report in CCC for a comprehensive evaluation of this swallowing study including comments and recommendations.
[**12-16**] Echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2199-11-28**], the left ventricle is now hyperdynamic.
The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenals, and intra-abdominal large and small bowel are normal in appearance.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid, distal ureters, and bladder are unremarkable in appearance.
A collection of fluid is seen in the pelvis in the presacral area.
[**12-17**] portable chest xray The tip of the PICC line is in the region of the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC.
MRI showed a cerbellar/basal ganglia watershed infarct with other areas suspicious for an embolic event.
Carotid ultrasound and TEE were negative for thrombus, diminishing likelihood of septic emboli.
No organism was identified since blood, urine, CSF, and sputum cultures had no growth.
IV vancomycin was started [**11-27**] at 1g every day and was increased to 1g twice daily on [**12-17**] for a trough of 8.5 thought to be due to improved renal clearance.
Labs to be checked every 3-4 days in the [**Hospital1 1501**] including CBC w/diff and ANC, LFTs, chemistry panel that can be faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 35948**].
The patient's neutrophil count has trended downward and is now near pt's baseline per old clinic records given his underlying marginal zone lymphoma and longstanding history of leukopenia.
A repeat head and chest CT at the end of the antibiotic course has been scheduled for [**2200-1-8**].
He passed a swallowing study including videography and did not require PEG placement.
A heart murmur detected [**12-13**] that may have previously been muffled due to anasarca.
Repeat echocardiogram showed hyperdynamic LV function, so the changing murmur was likely due to fluid shifting as third-spaced fluid was mobilized and excreted.
Bilateral pleural effusions and multiple peripheral consolidations documented improving on serial chest CT before leaving the ICU.
There were no clinical signs or symptoms of pancreatitis and abdominal CT with oral and iv contrast (w/prehydration for renal prophylaxis) showed no evidence of pancreatitis or biliary obstruction.
Repeat abdominal CT scan with contrast is recommended in [**4-6**] months to evaluate for pancreatitis and for evolution of an incidentally identified  uniformly appearing small presacral fluid collection with adjacent hypodensity.
The patient's blood pressure was elevated in the 120-160s.
iron studies suggest chronic disease.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day).
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed.
Please check vancomycin trough, CBC with diff, LFTs and chemistry panel with renal function on [**12-19**] (prior to vanco dose) and fax to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] (infectious disease) at # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 35948**].
