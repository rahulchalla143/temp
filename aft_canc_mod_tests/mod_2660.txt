She was referred to a cardiologist for a nuclear stress test about 6 weeks ago which was normal per pt.
At the [**Hospital 11074**] clinic on [**7-8**], a chest x-ray was done which was significant for mediastinal widening.
At [**Hospital1 1562**], a Chest CT showed diffuse mediastinal adenopathy and multiple pulmonary nodules and splenomegaly.
An echo showed small- moderate pericardial effusion and increased tuerculation in RV apex c/w RVA thrombus.
V/Q scan - indetermingate - 50% chance of PE.
She was sent for a chest and abdominal CT which suggested a 5x4 cm mediastinal mass with precarinal lymph nodes, multiple smaller nodules throughout both lungs and a small-moderate pericardial effusion.
Migraine headaches - since age 8.

Evaluation of the central airways demonstrate patency to the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
Examination of the lung windows demonstrate a dominant 13 x 11 mm nodule within the right upper lobe, with a satellite lesion in the subpleural right apex measuring 7 mm in size.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Allowing for the noncontrast technique, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, stomach, and small bowel appear unremarkable.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The large bowel and bladder are unremarkable.
Examination of the osseous structures show no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with history of cervical cancer with pulmonary nodule and mediastinal mass and patient allergic to IV contrast for CT, for further evaluation to exclude metastatic disease.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial, and FLAIR, T2 and susceptibility axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 axial, sagittal and coronal images were obtained following the administration of gadolinium.
Brief Hospital Course: 37 year old female with h/o cervical cancer s/p TAH transferred from outside hospital with progressive chest discomfort, SOB, and weight loss with Left popliteal DVT, possible PE and chest xray/ CT evidence of mediastinal mass and multiple bilateral nodules with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Pulmonary nodules - On admission a chest xray suggested a small focal opacity in right upper lobe and right paratracheal opacity.
A chest CT the following day suggested a large mediastinal mass with precarinal and subcarinal lymph nodes with hypodense central regions suggestive of necrosis.
On [**7-11**] she had a MRI-brain, which showed two foci of signal abnormalities in the right frontal lobe with enhancement.
The frozen section was positive for non-small cell lung cancer; paratracheal lymph nodes were sent for pathology (still pending).
She will also have a bone scan to evaluate for bone mets also on thursday as an o/p.
On the last day of admission, the patient noted blurriness in left periphery; no deficit on visual fields or neuro exam; the patient was advised to have a head ct to reevaluate for mass effect or bleeding in the brain lesions, but she refused and wanted to go home with no further treatment.
Hypercoagulable state - DVT/PE/?RV thrombus - echo at outside hospital also with possible thrombus in RV; pt obviously hypercoagulable most likely secondary to primary lung malignancy; she was maintained on heparin throughout the admission and was switched to Lovenox and underwent Lovenox administration teaching prior to discharge  3.
Pericardial effusion - found on echo at [**Hospital1 **]; stable on chest CT at [**Hospital1 18**].Most likely secondary to the primary lung malignancy; patient did not experience any decreases in blood pressure, increased shortness of breath, or increased chest pain during the admission.
Fevers - low grade throughout admission; most likely secondary to the malignancy; fungal, blood cultures were negative; lyme antibody was negative; patient never mounted an increased white blood cell count.
10 year hisory of perimenopausal symptoms - FSH, LH within normal limits; no further work-up during the admission  7.
PPX - She was maintained on a multivitamin and zantac during the admission with colace and senna to releive constipation in the setting of narcotics.)
Enoxaparin Sodium 40 mg/0.4mL Syringe Sig: One (1) Subcutaneous Q12H (every 12 hours).
Followup Instructions: Please go for bone scan on Thursday, [**7-16**] at 9:30 am.
