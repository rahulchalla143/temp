They checked her blood pressure and noted systolics in the 80's so transported her to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
She underwent endometrial biopsy, which  revealed high-grade malignant tumor concerning for carcinosarcoma and a pelvic ultrasound revealing an echogenic area within the cavity measuring 4 x 4 x 4 cm.
Pathology revealed carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed Mullerian tumor) and cervix with squamous metaplasia.
Tumor 5.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm grade 3.
PT1a (Stage IA) 10% myometrial invasion, cervix negative, ovaries and  fallopian tubes negative, tN0, 0 out of 9 pelvic lymph nodes, and 0 out of 4 paraaortic lymph nodes positive for metastasis.

Past Surgical History: Gastric bypass in [**2125**] at [**Hospital3 **] with 135-pound weight loss (a 40-pound weight gain since menopause), thyroidectomy ([**Hospital1 1774**]), radical neck dissection for recurrent disease ([**Hospital1 1774**]), left total knee replacement in [**2130**] complicated by bacteremia and joint infection with recurrence after six weeks of antibiotics resulting in spacer placement and replacement of the joint again in [**2132**], tonsillectomy at age 5, carpal tunnel bilaterally in [**2122**], cholecystectomy, umbilical hernia repair  Social History: Denies tobacco and drug use.
She works in retail and has 6 grandchildren   Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: On admission: Vitals: 98.1 74 94/64 16 97 RA GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: soft, mildly tender to palpation in the LUQ, no hernias or masses, well-healed midline incision Ext: No LE edema, LE warm and well perfused   Pertinent Results: CXR [**3-1**]: new left-sided effusion with possible underlying atelectasis or airspace disease CT Abd/Pel [**3-1**]: enlarging complex ascites, hemorrhage without clear source of bleed; rapid progressive metastatic disease in pelvis, liver, splenectomy bed, stomach, mesentery, peritoneum CTA [**3-2**]: no active extravasation, loculated fluid, large complex masses in splenectomy bed, pelvis, omentum, peritoneum Abdominal XR [**3-4**]: no e/o obstruction, contrast in colon, pleural effusion CXR [**3-4**]: substantial L pleural effusion, compressive atelectasis, low lung volumes CXR [**3-5**]: no PTX, substantial decrease in L pleural effusion GIB study [**3-6**]: no evidence of active bleeding within the splenic resection bed CTA [**3-6**]: Acute pulmonary Emboli in RLL and RUL, new nodular opacity in R apex concerning for early PNA.
Extensive metastatic dz in abd, perihepatic ascites CXR [**3-7**]: PICC in place, L effusion returned CXR [**3-8**]: L effusion   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 6607**] is a 53yo woman with a history of metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma who was admitted from the emergency room to the ICU for hypotension secondary to hemorrhage into splenectomy bed lesion.
# Hemoperitoneum: In the ICU, she was transfused a total of 3 units of pRBCs with HCT increase from 25.1 to 32.4.
Due to concern for bleeding from her splenectomy bed, interventional radiology was consulted and recommended a repeat CT scan in arterial phase to identify potential vessels to embolize.
On hospital day 2, after receiving renal-protective bicarb infusion given her Cr 1.5, a CTA abdomen showed no active extravasation.
Since a repeat HCT was stable at 32.4 and 34.1, she was then transferred to the gynecologic oncology service where HCT trended downwards overnight from 34.1 to 30.4 to a nadir of 27.
During transfusion, her tachycardia improved to the 90s and her urine output improved.
Her post-transfusion HCT was appropriate at 32.
However, her hematocrit still continued to trend downwards and per ACS recommendations, we did order a tagged red cell scan, which showed no evidence of an acute bleed.
We therefore transfused her 2 more units of blood for a HCT of 25.7.
Her HCT did not show an appropriate rise and was 27.8 and she received another unit of blood.
Labs were discontinued after her code status changed.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Given her creatinine of 1.5 on admission, she received renal-protective bicarb infusion prior to her CTA abdomen.
After her CTA abdomen, her creatinine increased from 1.1 to 1.8, and she was oliguric.
A FeNa was 0.3% consistent with pre-renal acute kidney injury, likely caused by a combination of IV contrast and anemia.
Her urine output improved slightly and her creatinine decreased to 1.7 after her blood transfusion on hospital day 3.
However, she continued to be oliguric (10-15cc/hr) on hospital day 4 with creatinine of 1.8, so she was bolused 500cc crystalloid and her urine output improved slightly.
Her urine output continued to average 10-20cc during the course of her stay.
Urine output monitoring was stopped and her foley discontinued after her code status was changed.
# Pleural effusion: Chest x-ray in the emergency room showed a new left-sided pleural effusion.
Given the inability to wean her from oxygen and dyspnea on exertion on hospital day 4, a repeat chest x-ray was performed which demonstrated a substantial L pleural effusion, compressive atelectasis, and low lung volumes.
Post-procedure chest x-ray desmonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax.
However, she had a desaturation to 85%/RA prompting an evaluation with CT scan to rule out a pulmonary embolism.
Given her poor kidney function and creatinine of 1.8, we pre-hydrated her with sodium bicarbonate to prevent worsening nephropathy.
Her CTA showed Acute pulmonary Emboli in the Right lung vasculature, new nodular opacity in Righ apex concerning for early pneumonia.
She did have a PICC line placed because of her antibiotic requirement and for blood draws.
On hospital day 4, her final urine culture returned showing E.coli resistant to bactrim.
Her final blood cultures were negative and her ceftriaxone was discontinued on [**2136-3-7**]  # Metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma: In the emergency room a CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrated enlarging complex ascites, hemorrhage without a clear source of bleeding, and rapid progression of metastic disease in pelvis, liver, splenectomy bed, stomach, mesentery, and peritoneum compared to a CT scan performed a week prior.
EKG showed 1st degree AV block without any ST changes.
Serial troponins decreased to 0.06 and 0.03 and CPKs were within normal limits.
