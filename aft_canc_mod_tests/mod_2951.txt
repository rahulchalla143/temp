Physical Exam: BP 89/66 P 91 T 96.5 R 20 94%RA Heent: anicteric sclera, dry mucosa Neck: supple, trachea midline Nodes: no supraclavicular, cervical, axillary, submandibular adenopathy Lungs: rhonchi Bilateral.
Pertinent Results: Micro (summary): Stool cx [**9-3**] and [**2138-9-17**]: Adenovirus Blood: Adenovirus VL 3900([**9-23**])-> 5400([**10-1**])-> 600([**10-8**])-> <250([**10-9**]) Blood [**2138-9-14**]: MRSA Sputum [**2138-9-14**]: MRSA and Pseudomonas (Gent and Cipro resistant)  .
Imaging: CT abdomen [**2138-10-19**]: Large extracapsular liver hematoma with a large amount of intra-abdominal and intrapelvic hemorrhagic ascites which is highly concerning for active bleeding given the patient's coagulopathy and dropping hematocrit status post liver biopsy.
Liver biopsy [**2138-10-16**]: Marked cholestasis with associated balloon-cell degeneration.
Repeat US [**2138-10-14**]: No evidence of intraluminal thrombus within the left upper extremity venous system.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CT chest with contrast [**2138-9-14**]: 1.
The patient then was noted to have rising LFTs and direct bilirubin (total bili peaking at 23.3 with 18.2 direct fraction).
She eventually underwent US guided diagnostic liver biopy on [**2138-10-16**].
Her platelet count at the time of liver biopsy was 45-103.
Post-procedure, she was not getting transfused aggressively with platelets due to concern for TTP/HUS and her platelets went down as low as 11.
On the evening of [**2138-10-18**] she developed abdominal tenderness and urgent CT scan of abdomen [**2138-10-19**] showed hemoperitoneum.
Hct was 23 post-procedure but she subsequently required 2 units of pRBCs ([**10-16**]) then 2 unitsp RBCs ([**10-18**]) then 1 unit this am ([**10-19**]) and most recent Hct is 21.
Surgery was consulted and recommended conservative management with serial Hct, transfusion support and close monitoring in the ICU.
C. diff negative x 2, stool studies negative or pending.
Colonoscopy was performed which revealed no evidence of GVHD.
Sputum gram stains: 4+ GPC's in chains, clusters, pairs; 4+ GNR's, <10 polys (patient neutropenic); culture showed MRSA and Pseudomonas.
CT showed infiltrates in RUL, LLL.
Blood cultures 2/4 positive for MRSA; however, decided to leave port in for now unless gets acutely ill. By discharge and after Abx treatment, her symptoms resolved.
Repeat U/S revealed no evidence of thrombus and vancomycin stopped.
