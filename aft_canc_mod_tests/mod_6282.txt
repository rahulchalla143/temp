A chest x-ray was unchanged from previous admission.
The patient was placed on oxygen and [**Last Name (STitle) **] cultures were drawn.
A respiratory culture was done and the patient was found to be positive for parainfluenza.
A CT was done on [**2158-6-10**] which showed new peribronchiolar opacity in right upper and right lower lobe compatible with [**Date Range 2**].
An arterial [**Date Range **] gas revealed a PO2 of 43 and PCO2 of 48.
His rates were in the low 100's to 110's and systolic [**Hospital1 **] pressures were mostly in the 90's, consistent with prior admissions.
In the ICU, his rates were increased to the 130's, and his metoprolol was increased to 50 mg PO TID.
