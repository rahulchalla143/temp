LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 19.
[**2111**], hematocrit 40.6, platelet count 295, sodium 129, potassium 2.8, BUN 28, creatinine 1.5 and glucose of 174.
An echocardiogram at that time revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%.
A head CT was obtained at that time, which was essentially negative.
CT of the head remained essentially negative.
The patient had another bronchoscopy the following day for copious amounts of secretions and she was subsequently extubated.
CT of her head was repeated on [**5-19**], which was again negative.
At this point the Neurology Service strongly recommended an MRI to determine what the pathology was causing her neurological examination.
MRI of the head and neck were obtained and revealed multiple small fossae posterior infarcts, basilar artery infarcts, mild basilar artery stenosis and no spinal cord compression.
It was the Neurology Services recommendation to keep her systolic blood pressure above 120.
She also had copious secretions, which she became unable to clear possibly due to fatigue.
She underwent a bronchoscopy again due to copious secretions and she had a percutaneous tracheostomy performed at the bedside as well as a PEG for feeding purposes.
The following day the patient's white blood cell count peaked at 45,000.
She had some minor abdominal tenderness and went for chest, abdomen and pelvis CT scans, which were all negative.
The patient did have a remote history of lymphoma and the question was brought up as to whether the white blood cell count was in some way related to the lymphoma.
The patient has had some diarrhea and she has had two negative C-difficile examination on her stool.
The patient was intermittently placed on low dose neo-synephrine around the [**5-26**] for one to two days due to some mild hypotension in the one teens in attempts to keep her systolic blood pressure higher, because of her neurologic status.
Her Lopressor was increased due to a heart rate in the 90s.
The Hematology Service had signed off since her white blood cell count had subsequently been coming down over the last few days.
On [**5-30**] the patient underwent a repeat MRI of her head and neck at the request of the Neurology Service, which showed no change from her previous study.
The patient was also noted on chest x-ray after being placed back on the ventilator to have a left pleural effusion.
She underwent a thoracentesis on [**5-30**] for approximately 400 cc of serosanguineous fluid.
Repeat chest x-ray showed reexpansion of the lung with no pneumothorax.
Most recent culture data, on [**5-22**] the patient had one positive blood culture drawn from a peripheral A line for coag negative staph.
However, she subsequently had three blood cultures, which were negative and the line was discontinued upon receiving the information of the initial positive blood culture.
The patient had a gram stain of her sputum on the 18th, which was gram positive coxae, but the culture subsequently revealed no bacteria and some sparse growth of yeast.
Other recent laboratory values from [**5-29**] revealed a white blood cell count of 16.9, which has come down to 16.0 today on [**5-30**].
Hematocrit 30.2, platelet count 206,000.
The patient's physical examination today, neurologically the patient is very lethargic.
Coronary examination is regular rate and rhythm.
Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
with a target INR of 2.0.
to be held for a heart rate less then 60 or a systolic blood pressure less then 110.
This will have to be assessed on an ongoing basis due to the patient's nutritional status as she begins to take in more calories.
Coverage for blood sugar of 150 to 200 she gets 3 units of regular insulin subcutaneously for, 200 to 250 she gets 6 units, 250 to 300 she [**Last Name (un) 17927**] 9 units subcutaneously.
