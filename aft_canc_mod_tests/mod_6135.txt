Fevers persisted and his family brought him to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further workup and management.
Neurology was consulted, and L spine MR attempted but technically difficult.
CT scan of the thigh showed abscess in left proximal quads, the area where pain was concentrated.
Pertinent Results: Studies: ECG ([**2182-5-7**]): Sinus rhythm at 122 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals, 1 mm Q waves in inferior leads and V4-V6, no ST segment/T wave changes.
TTE ([**2182-5-7**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Left LENI ([**2182-5-9**]): Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.
MRI L-spine with/without contrast ([**2182-5-10**]): There was no sign for the presence of a disc or vertebral abnormality to suggest either an inflammatory process or other pathologic entity.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis/Thighs ([**2182-5-12**]): The visualized part of the liver, gallbladder, adrenal glands, right kidneys, and pancreas has normal appearance.
CT OF THE PELVIS: Urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter.
MRI Thigh ([**2182-5-19**] - prelim): There is edema and enhancement in the proximal left femur compatible with osteomyelitis.

Left hip joint fluid culture ([**2182-5-13**]): MRSA .
HIV Ab: negative HCV Ab: positive HCV viral load: 48,800 IU/mL  Brief Hospital Course: 27 year old male with history of IVDU presents with MRSA bacteremia, left thigh abscess, left hip septic srthritis, and left femur osteomyelitis.
His blood and wound cultures grew MRSA and a TTE showed no vegetations.
His fevers persisted and ID was consulted who recommended an MRI of his LS spine to look for osteomyelitis/discitis.
His blood cultures from [**5-9**] again came back positive for MRSA.
An ultrasound of his LLE showed no DVT.
He was having increased pain at his left thigh incision site and thus a CT of his pelvis/thighs was obtained which showed multiple fluid collections and possible evidence of necrotizing fasciitis, and thus he was taken urgently to the OR again late on [**2182-5-10**] for an additional washout.
Once vancomycin levels were therapeutic, his linezolid was stopped.
Due to his continued fevers and leg/groin pain (as well as ongoing leg weakness), he was taken for CT of his abdomen/pelvis/thighs to evaluate for septic thrombophlebitis versus spinal osteomyelitis/discitis versus epidural abscess (due to pain, he could not tolerate MRI).
The CT scan showed no evidence of spinal disease, but did show a new peri-articular fluid collection at his left hip concerning for a septic arthritis.
His fevers persisted through [**5-12**] through [**2182-5-17**] in spite of the fact that his last positive blood culture was [**2182-5-13**] and his vancomycin levels were therapeutic.
On [**5-19**], his intra-op wound culture from [**5-17**] was noted to be growing GNRs (in addition to MRSA); he was put on empiric meropenem, though this was narrowed to ciprofloxacin once the GNRs returned as pan-sensitive E. coli.
An MRI of his thigh done on [**2182-5-19**] was limited due to the patient's poor pain control, though it did show evidence of osteomyelitis of his proximal femur.
The patient was taken for a sixth washout of his thigh on [**2182-5-20**] with biopsy of his proximal femur.
Bone biopsy results were pending at the time of discharge.
Following the wound closure there was no further bleeding and his hematocrit was stable.
At the time of discharge, he had been afebrile for greater than 72 hours, was on PO Linezolid and Cipro, surveillance cultures were negative for greater than 10 days, had good pain control on PO pain medications, and was ambulating with assistance.
The patient was informed of this and underwent RUQ ultrasound with plan to follow-up in Liver Clinic for further evaluation and treatment of his hepatitis.
Will need outpatient repeat thigh CT to assess abcess prior to ID followup [**2182-6-26**].
He will followup with orthopedics clinic for evaluation of his wound and healing.
He will need regular follow-up with new PCP and arrangement of a chest CT to evaluate mid right lung pulmonary nodule seen on CXR.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17 gram (100 %) Powder in Packet Sig: One (1) packet PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
2) Infectious Disease - After you are discharged you will need weekly blood tests to monitor your infection.
You will also have a CT of your left thigh as an outpatient to evaluate your healing schedule on [**6-10**].
You had an ultrasound of your liver to look for signs of damage due to the virus.
You should follow-up in Liver Clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**2182-7-10**] at 11:00am to discuss your hepatitis test results, ultrasound, and any need for treatment.
