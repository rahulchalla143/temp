EF of 35% to 45%  ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to CELEBREX, causing swelling.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.7; pulse 77; blood pressure 108/68; respiratory rate 21; saturating 99% on four liters, 96% on room air.
Neurological examination is nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission revealed the following: CBC showing WBC 10.5; hematocrit 30.7 down to 33.8; platelet count 519; MCV 82; RDW 14.7; PT 25.9; INR 4.4; PTT 55.2.
Differential WBC 69% neutrophils, 22% lymphs, 5% monocytes.
Chem 7 on admission showed the sodium of 141, potassium 3.5, chloride 107, bicarbonate 25, BUN 44, creatinine 0.8, sugar 88, CK 29.
Chest x-ray showed residual left effusion.
Echocardiogram from [**3-/2106**] showed EF of 35% to 45%.
She underwent CT of the chest on [**2106-10-11**], which showed difficult evaluation SVC thrombus secondary to artifact from the stent and catheter, which runs through the SVC.
However, there were numerous collaterals seen within the chest wall suggesting venous thrombosis, which could not be proven by CT imaging.
This was followed by SVC gram on [**2106-10-12**].
Occlusion of the subclavian vein, brachiocephalic vein, and the brachiocephalic stent was noted.
As stated above, on [**10-15**] the TPA was stopped and Heparin was continued for PTT of 60 to 80.
However, chest x-ray remained clear and she did not receive further antibiotics.
At that time, sodium acetate was instituted, as well as IV fluids with 3 ampules of bicarbonate, and her serum bicarbonate level corrected.
She was noted to be extremely lethargic, and thus underwent a head CT to rule out subdural hematoma.
The CT was negative for bleed or any other processes, and Ms. [**Known lastname **] mental status eventually improved.
Of note, when Ms. [**Known lastname **] continued to have increasing lethargy, ABG was attained, which showed pH of 7.33, pCO2 of 38, pO2 86 on two liters of oxygen.
Repeat ABG was undergone on [**2106-10-20**].
On [**2106-10-21**], the pH was 7.24, pCO2 29, pO2 71, lactate, at that time was 0.9.
She was gradually weaned off oxygen on the floor, and was tolerating room air with saturation 94% to 97%.
Chest x-ray showed stable effusions and no further CHF changes.
The EKG was stable without sinus tachycardia or any other changes.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] has a history of CHF and EF of 35% to 45%.
At that time, she was placed on Hydralazine and nitrates, which were held secondary to hypotension to systolic blood pressures of 60s to 70s.
The blood pressure began to improve.
She was, overall, fluid overloaded, but her blood pressure would not tolerate further Lasix.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent CT of the abdomen, which showed increased retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy indicating likely further metastases of her cancer.
Alkaline phosphatase was also elevated to the 600s, likely indicating abdominal involvement.
GI:  Mrs.[**Location (un) 32259**] GI examination was stable throughout.
It ranged from tender to palpation with some guarding; however, abdominal CT showed no further abscess.
However, when her creatinine seemed to stabilize around 1.5 to 1.6 the Renal Department was consulted.
The urinalysis showed fungal UTI with total protein indicating possible nephrotic syndrome.
As stated above, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] also had hypotension to the 60s and 70s for two days, with her creatinine rising to a high of 3.0.
Repeat urinalysis continues to show fungal UTI treated with Fluconazole and continued nephrotic-range proteinuria.
