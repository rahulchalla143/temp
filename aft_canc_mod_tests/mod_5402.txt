Was in marked distress and sent to ER where CT was reportedly negative.
Was recommended for Dilantin, Nimodipine, strict BP control, CTA and MRI of spine.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
CT head showed findings c/w SAH, and CTA showed possibility of anterior comm artery aneurysm.
Registers [**3-30**], recalls [**3-30**] in 5 minutes.
Glucose 51, Protein 361.
Serum gluc 108.
While no definite enhancement is seen to suggest an alternative diagnosis for the foramen magnum lesion, such as a meningioma or leukemic deposit, after discussing the case with the attending neurosurgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25918**], consideration for a followup MR study using gadolinium enhancement was suggested, as well as consideration for standard catheter cerebral angiography.
Neuro:  OSH head CT negative for bleed however, head CT in ED showed regions of subarachnoid hemorrhage at the left cervicomedullary junction (level of foramen magnum) and bilateral posterior temporal lobes.
CTA head showed a 1mm sessile aneurysm from the anterior communicating artery and minor atherosclerotic calcifications involving the distal left internal carotid artery, immediately proximal to the carotid foramen.
Differential diagnosis included meningioma or leukemic deposit, after discussing the case with the attending neurosurgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], consideration for a followup MR study using gadolinium enhancement was suggested, as well as standard catheter cerebral angiography.
Patient was treated with triple H therapy including elevation of the blood pressure (induced Hypertension), Hemodilution to improve cerebral blood flow, and maintenance of high normal circulating blood volume (Hypervolemia).
Furthermore, he was told that his work-up was not completed and that he still needed an MRI of the brain with and without contrast and that neuro-oncology was asked to evaluate him.
