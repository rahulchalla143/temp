Today his L foot was noted to be cooler than the R, and an "arterial ultrasound" showed a "distal clot" (notes aren't more specific and the actual report isn't currently available).
Accordingly, he is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and management of ischemic L foot  Past Medical History: IDDM CAD s/p CABG '[**93**] s/p stents '[**04**] AFib HTN, hypercholesterolemia CHF orthostatic hypotension hyponatremia hypothyroid multiple myeloma thrombocytopenia MRSA bacteremia nephrolithiasis PSH: s/p CABG x4 '[**93**], s/p R CEA '[**08**] ([**Doctor Last Name 1391**]), s/p R rotator cuff surgery x2, s/p open appy (remote  Social History: married denies tobacco, ETOH or drug use  Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: PE: 97.9, 82, 104/56, 20, 96 on RA A&Ox3, NAD.

ECG Study Date of [**2112-2-4**]  1:46:12 AM Atrial fibrillation Premature ventricular contractions or aberrant ventricular conduction Nonspecific intraventricular conduction defect Poor R wave progression Nonspecific inferior/lateral T wave flattening Since previous tracing of [**2109-6-10**], no significant change  VENOUS DUP EXT UNI (MAP/DVT) Study Date of [**2112-2-5**] 2:22 PM FINDINGS: The left greater saphenous vein and lesser saphenous veins are widely patent throughout their course.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2112-2-9**] ventricular triplet is no longer present.
ECG Study Date of [**2112-2-12**]  8:28:06 PM Atrial fibrillation with PVC(s).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to dyskinesis of the basal inferior posterior wall, and akinesis of the interventricular septum.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Given that he was post-operative, he was transferred to the CCU for monitoring and for an evaluation for ischemia.
His CKs were flat 18-20 with troponin leak of 0.11.
Cardiology following- recs.-Echocardiogram was performed which showed- LA and RA markedly dilated.
During patient's angiogram it was noted there was a finding of extrensic compression of left external iliac artery.
