Pathology revealed a 10-cm tumor [**Last Name (un) 19076**] grade [**4-15**] with invasion of the adrenal gland.
Subsequent followup imaging revealed a lung nodule.
Followup imaging in [**2150-10-13**] demonstrated multiple small bilateral pulmonary nodules.
Pre IL-2 brain MRI revealed 3 small brain metastases.
Repeat torso CT showed increase in pulmonary nodules and he began cycle 1, week 1 high-dose IL-2 therapy on [**2151-2-25**].
Followup CT scans revealed disease regression in the lung.
Followup brain MRI revealed stability of the right cerebellar lesion, improvement in the occipital lesion and resolution of the frontal lesion.
VITAL SIGNS:  97.1, 97, 20, 150/88, O2 sat 98% on room air.
ADMISSION LABS:  WBC 14.8, hemoglobin 13.8, hematocrit 40.7, platelet count 393,000.
INR 1.
BUN 31, creatinine 1.6, sodium 139, potassium 5, chloride 108, CO2 23, glucose 99, ALT 25, AST 16, CK 21, total bili 0.5, albumin 4.2.
His admission weight was 92 kg and he received interleukin-2 600,000 international units per kilo equaling 55.5 million units IV q.8 hours x14 potential doses.
On treatment day #1 after his first dose of IL-2 he became unresponsive with a systolic blood pressure in the 60's.
He received 3 fluid boluses with systolic blood pressure over 90 and improved mental status.
At that time, he was found to be bradycardic in the 30's to 40 which improved to the 50's, normal sinus brady with improved blood pressure.
On treatment day #2 at 4:30 a.m. he developed systolic blood pressure of 80 without improvement with 3 fluid boluses.
On treatment day #5 he received his fifth dose of IL-2 at 8:00 a.m. and later that day developed rapid atrial fibrillation to the 200's with systolic blood pressure of 60 despite Neo-Synephrine blood pressure support.
During this week he developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 3.7, improved to 3.4 at the time of discharge.
Electrolytes were monitored and repleted per protocol.
Strict I and O and serum chemistries were maintained.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, status post cycle II, week 2 high-dose IL-2 therapy complicated by shock, acute renal failure, toxic encephalopathy and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 84751**] will return to the clinic in 4 weeks after CT scan to assess disease response.
