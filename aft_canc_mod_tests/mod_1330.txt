Admission Date:  [**2147-11-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2147-11-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2092-4-12**]     Sex:  F   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old woman with mastocytosis activation syndrome with one urine histamine of 9000.
Serial electrocardiograms at that time showed ST-T wave changes and a troponin of 20 which then decreased to 1.5.
An echocardiogram at that time showed akinesis at the base of fraction of 35%.
She notes that the Gastrocrom did not help her chest pain.
In [**2145-4-3**] she had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 16164**] procedure (uterine suspension) followed by increased lipase and liver function tests accompanied by abdominal pain.
In [**2145-10-3**], sural nerve biopsy, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography muscle biopsy, and liver biopsy.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2146-12-13**] showed prominent mass cells with granulation in the duodenum and mild esophagitis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 98, blood pressure was 120/66, heart rate was 60, respiratory rate was 20, oxygen saturation was 100% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed anicteric.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Rectal examination revealed no stool or blood, normal tone.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 5.1, hematocrit was 34.3, platelets were 231.
Electrolytes were within normal limits.
PT was 17.4, PTT was 32.1, INR was 2.
Creatine kinases and troponin were normal times three.
ALT was 22, AST was 32, amylase was 83, lipase was 93.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  CT revealed left lung base with a small nodule.
Electrocardiogram was notable for nonsloping ST-T wave changes, poor progression in V1 and V2, generally low voltage.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient's primary issue during her hospitalization was her chest pain.
Her chest pain in general did not seem to improve during her admission, in that it did not decrease in frequency or severity.
An echocardiogram was obtained and showed that her ejection fraction had rebounded to 75% from 35% on her last admission.
An Allergy consultation was obtained, and there was some suggestion that histamine release could cause coronary with muscle spasm; however, this was felt to be somewhat less likely.
Additionally as her repeat electrocardiogram showed no evidence of ischemia with chest pain, and her cardiac function was normal, we felt the patient's cardiovascular status was good.
GI was involved and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which was grossly normal.
However, biopsy specimens were taken.
In terms of the patient's lower gastrointestinal bleed, a flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed and revealed only hemorrhoids.
Her arterial blood gas after the episode causing the Medical Intensive Care Unit transfer was consistent with some degree of a panic attack.
A 24-hour urine was performed; however, it was unclear to what extent to the 24-hour urine was collected properly.
