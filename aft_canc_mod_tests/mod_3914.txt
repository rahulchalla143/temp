A hemoclip was placed and the area was tattooed with [**Country 11150**] ink.
EGD ([**9-18**]): -Hemorrhagic AVM in proximal jejunum identified and clipped with endoclip.
GI bleeding - On day of admission, pt underwent EGD with hemoclip placement on bledding AVM in 4th portion of duodenum and embolization of gastroduodenal artery.
After each, HCT decreased by [**3-20**] points and was treated with transfusion as indicated below under "treatment of anemia."
Following 2 episodes of melena on [**9-15**], patient underwent a Bleeding Study which revealed a faint area of increased tracer accumulation in LUQ that was possibly related to a slow bleed at 3rd-4th portion of duodenum.
Following melena on [**9-17**], pt underwent repeat EGD, during which a hemorrhagic AVM in the proximal jejunum was identified and an endoclip was placed; additionally, severe gastritis was observed and 7cc of epinephrine was injected into the most severe region.
MDS - Mr. [**Known lastname 58415**] has a lifelong Hx of anemia w/ superimposed MDS and refractory anemia and thrombocytopenia with excess blast type II (11% blasts and trisomy 8).
In hospital, PLT goal was > 20 due to ongoing bleeding and HCT goal was > 25 given CAD.
PLT 67-57-41-43 4 days prior to discharge and 31 at discharge.
Given this trend downwards, will need close follow up of PLT count s/p d/c.
#Treatment of anemia: patient recieved a total of 9 units of pRBCs while an inpatient to maintain HCT > 25.
Most recent transfusion of 2 U pRBC given 4 days prior to discharge.
HCT stable for 3 days prior to discharge at >29.8, and = 31.1 at d/c.
Cardiac: EKG at admission: Sinus bradycardia with nonspecific lateral ST-T changes w/ no previous tracing for comparison.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout course with pulse range 42-72 and BP range 100-160/50-77.
#Pump: Echo (TTE) on [**9-12**]: moderate [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1915**], LV EF = 60-65%.
)PUML: CXR at admission: well placed L PICC with L lung base atelectasis.
Severe gastritis was observed on EGD and H. pylori serology was +.
