He experienced confusion and agitation post-operatively which was treated with restraints and Haldol, an EKG was negative for ischemia, he was afebrile, and hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit of 29.8, the confusion had resolved by POD 1.
On POD 2 he had hypovolemia with decreased urine output which responded well to intravenous bolussing.
On POD 2 he had intermittent confusion with desaturation which improved on nasal cannula; chest x-ray and chest CT scan were negative for an embolus, he had a small right pleural effusion without evidence of aspiration.
On POD 4 he had +flatus and a bowel movement, his diet was advanced which he tolerated well, he had improvement in his mental status with orientation to person, time, and place.
On POD 8, he had an episode of emesis with desaturation, was transferred to the ICU for furher management of aspiration pneumonia confirmed by CT and X-ray, broad spectrum antibiotics were started, he was maintained on oxygen therapy, a nasogastric tube was placed, and he was NPO with initiation of TPN.
On POD 11, he required mechanical ventilation with intubation, was febrile with leukocytosis of 20k, received a transfusion for a hematocrit of 23; all microbiology cultures had been negative to date.
Post-operatively he required additional transfusions for a hematocrit of 24, with a good response.
The following day, he became hypertensive with SBP up to 200, ekg showed inverted T waves, and cardiac enzymes were cycled which were negative for myocardial infarction.
He had a swallow evaluation which showed aspiration of thin liquids.
On [**2117-1-1**], a CT scan was obtained for leukocytosis and abnormal drainage from the abdominal wound, which revealed an enterocutaneous fistula, most likely arising from the small bowel anastomosis.
TPN without sodium as well as D5W were infused to keep his sodium level less than 147.
Sodium levels were followed closely throughout the day and it remained stable at 143 at discharge with the D5W infusions.
His agitation improved, but he continued to remain confused.
Before discharge, the patient had another swallow evaluation and demonstrated signs of aspiration of thin liquids by straw sips and his diet was changed to a thin liquid, soft solid diet without the use of a straw.
A cdiff test was pending.
A UA was positive for UTI and the patient was started on a 7 day course of Cipro.
