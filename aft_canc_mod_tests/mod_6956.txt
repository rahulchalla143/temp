Her Dyspnea resolved on its own yesterday after 1 hr.
During that admission, she underwent repeat endoscopy and dilation on [**1-31**] with improvement of symptoms.
Biopsy of esophgeal nodule showed squamous cell CA.
She had CTA showing no PE, and questionable pna, so she was given: 3 L IVF, Levoflox, Vancomycin.
Formal echo performed by cardiology: pericardial effusion (new, small, no tamponade physiology).
Vitals prior to transfer: 98.3 128 135/77 22 99% 2LNC Pt transfered to the ICU for tachycardia, dyspnea.
Prior to that, she had no problems swallowing solids after her recent EGD and dilation on [**1-31**].
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: -presented with back & right sided flank pain & was found to have lung nodules on CXR, prompting chest CT that showed a LLL nodule and mediastinal & hilar lymphadenopathy.
Thoracic spine MRI showed expansile T9 lesion c/w metastatic disease.s/p palliative radiation to T7-11 spine & right ilium through [**2143-7-29**].
She underwent Brain MRI [**2143-7-30**] which was (-) for metastatic disease.
Dilation of the esophagus was attempted and complicated by acute perforation of distal esophagus, resulting in need for thoracic surgery for repair.

[**2-6**] ECHO: The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Findings compatible with disease progression compared to PET-CT [**2143-11-19**].
[**2-7**] Echo: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%).
Although frank cardiac tamponade is not present, the findings of tachycardia, brief right atrial diastolic invagination, and small ventricles warrant close clinical and echocardiographic followup.
MICRO STUDIES: [**2144-2-6**] 5:02 pm SPUTUM     Site: EXPECTORATED       Source: Expectorated.

There was a question of post-obstructive pneumonia on CT from enlarging lung mass compressing left lower lobe bronchus.
Metastatic NSCLC: CTA revealed mediastinal mass with multiple enlarging nodules.
Again showed new esophageal mass obliterating the lumen, unclear if this is a new primary to extension/mets of lung cancer (path on last biopsy was equivocal).
CT showed near complete obliteration of esophageal lumen from mass, even after recent dilation procedure.
Discharge Medications: 1. dextromethorphan-guaifenesin 10-100 mg/5 mL Syrup [**Year (4 digits) **]: Five (5) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for cough.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 13. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Name (STitle) **]: Five (5) mL PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Lorazepam Intensol 2 mg/mL Concentrate [**Name (STitle) **]: 0.5-1 mg PO three times a day as needed for standing dose.
Lorazepam Intensol 2 mg/mL Concentrate [**Name (STitle) **]: 0.5  mg PO every four (4) hours as needed for anxiety or nausea.
After consultation with the pulmonary team, and evaluation with a CT scan we believe the most likely cause of your shortness of breath is progression of your lung cancer.
