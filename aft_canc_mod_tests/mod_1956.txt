The patient underwent a bronchoscopy by interventional pulmonology to obtain the tissue diagnosis.
A bone scan revealed diffuse osseous mets.
MRI was negative for brain mets.
Electrolytes were within normal limits.
His antihypertensives were initally held, then restarted once his blood pressure recovered.
# Hypercarbic resp failure: The patient had an elevated CO2 on blood gas in association with the altered mental status and hypotension described above.
# abdominal pain - The patient presented with abdominal pain of unclear etiology, and had a negative CT abd/pelvis at an outside hospital.
The patient received a dose of pamidronate on [**2103-2-9**], after which the calcium level remained normal.
# Anemia: Hematocrit drifted downward slowly, and reached a nadir of [**2109-3-1**] (this in the setting of IV hydration).
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease (ferritin >[**2097**]).
Some of the decrease in hematocrit may also have been related to chemotherapy.
The patient received a total of 3 units of PRBC during the hospital course, after which his hct remained stable.
# DM: We continued metformin per home regimen, but discontinued glipizide when blood glucose levels became too low.
We checked QID fingersticks and covered with insulin sliding scale.
This was likely hypervolemic hyponatremia, in the setting of IVF and blood products.
