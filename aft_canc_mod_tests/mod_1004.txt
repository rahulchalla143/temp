His counts dropped as expected and he developed severe abdominal pain and fevers (discussed below).
# Febrile neutropenia / Fungemia - while patient was having fevers during his nadir, he had a positive blood cutlure growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**].
ID was consulted and the patient had an echo and eye exam, both of which were normal.
During this time, he was having severe abdominal pain, so with worries for hepatosleno candidemia, we did an MRI that did not show any involvement.
His abdominal pain improved, but he contined to have elevated LFTs despite switching antifungals.
# Elevated LFTs - after having fungemia, he had elevated LFTs which were thought to likely be due to med effect v. hepatospleno candidemia.
His MRI was negative, but he continued to have clinical signs of infection (although never spiked another fever once on antifungals).
Liver was consulted, and his LFTs started trending down so it was decided that a biopsy was not needed.
He had two CT scans that did not show any bowel infection or typhlitis.
# Enterococcus UTI: Diagnosed from urine culture in the ED and treated with cefepime.
He was presumed to have an anaphylactic reaction to his chemotherapy, and was given solumedrol 125mg IV X1, Benadryl 25mg IV X1, inhaled racemic epinephrine, and epinephrine .3mg IM X1.

His blood was sent for a transfusion reaction but none could be identified.
