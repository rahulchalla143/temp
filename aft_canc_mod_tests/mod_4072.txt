On admission to [**Hospital3 1280**], she was found to be pancytopenic with an ANC of 150; hematocrit of 20 and platelets of 56,000 and febrile to 101.6 degrees F.  She was started on Ceptaz and transfused packed red blood cells and platelets.
She underwent bone marrow biopsy on [**3-17**].
Results were positive for B cell antigen; positive DBA44, positive CD-4 5 RO, hypercellular marrow with 5% fat composed almost entirely of infiltrating small lymphoid cells, all consistent with the diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia.
Before starting any therapy for her leukemia, a PPD was placed which was grossly positive, despite the patient reporting a negative PPD two months prior for work.
A CT of the abdomen was obtained which showed massive splenomegaly.
A CT of the chest showed mediastinal adenopathy and multiple nodules.
She was bronchoscoped on [**3-23**] and had acid fast bacilli sputum negative times three.
The bronchoscopy showed no endobronchial lesions and washings were obtained.
Blood cultures eventually grew atypical microbacterium on [**3-17**] of one bottle; [**3-21**] two bottles; [**3-24**] one bottle and [**3-26**], one bottle.
On [**3-25**], she was also noted to have a rash which worsened on [**4-9**], spreading to her face, chest and extremities.
One skin biopsy showed a pathology report consistent with a vasculitis.
A repeat biopsy was performed on [**4-11**].
Cultures are pending at this time.
She underwent radiation therapy to her spleen on [**3-30**], [**4-2**], [**4-6**] and [**4-9**] and Interferon Alpha three million units, three times a week, q. Monday, Wednesday and Friday on the following dates:  [**4-3**], [**4-5**], [**4-7**], [**4-10**] and [**4-12**], in an attempt to stabilize her blood count.
Her blood cultures were sent to the state laboratory which determined that the microbacterium growing from her blood were not tuberculosis and not [**Doctor First Name **] and likely some type of rapid grower.
At the outside hospital, she had a TTE on [**3-31**] which showed trace mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid regurgitation, normal ejection fraction, normal wall motion, no vegetations.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission to the Intensive Care Unit, her systolic blood pressure was in the 80's.
Her oxygen saturation was around 96% on one liter nasal cannula.
Heart rate was slightly tachycardiac in the 120's.
Respiratory rate around 20.
Chest examination was notable for rhonchi in the left upper lobe posteriorly and rales at the bases bilaterally.
Heart examination was tachycardiac, soft, 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex.
Her pulses were all 2+.
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities and 3+ in the lower extremities with clonus bilaterally; down going toes bilaterally.
Her lactate was less than 2.
On [**4-13**], to monitor her CVP and to allow for intravenous antibiotics and intravenous fluids as needed.
The state laboratory was called regarding blood cultures sensitivities.
However, they did mention that her sputum culture has been negative at 14 days and the next read will be on [**0-0-0**].
The next blood culture read for acid fast bacilli will be [**2128-4-23**].
A TTE was performed on [**4-14**] and no vegetations were seen.
A body CT was performed to rule out abscess or other sources of infection and no abscesses were seen; however, she does have a left upper lobe pneumonia, possibly post obstructive.
There was a pulmonary nodule seen on the CT scan from the outside hospital.
They reviewed the bone marrow biopsy slide and agreed that this was consistent with hairy cell leukemia.
She should be treated supportively with transfusions, keeping her hematocrit above 25 and platelets above 10,000 or above 20,000 plus bleeding.
The CT scan of the torso that she had showed extensive lymphadenopathy in her chest.
Question of cord compression: this patient developed urinary retention, clonus and hyper reflexes in her lower extremities on [**4-15**] and a large bladder was seen on the CT of her torso.
A magnetic resonance scan of the spine was obtained which showed no compression in the thoracic or lumbar spine.
[**Doctor Last Name **] to complete his read of the magnetic resonance scan of the cervical spine.
Pancytopenia:  She was on neutropenic precautions; keep hematocrit above 25; guaiac all stools.
Desquamating raised plaque-like skin rash, sparing the mucous membranes:  Dermatology was consulted and a biopsy was performed showed preliminary no growth.
DIC laboratory studies were checked.
Her D-dimers were high but fibrinogen and FDP were within normal limits.
CT of the abdomen showed no liver masses or abscesses, unclear etiology.
We performed a CT of the head, which was negative for bleed or masses.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  We obtained a nutrition consult, put her on high protein Boost three times a day and neutropenic diet.
She has an albumin of 1.5 which is unfavorable.
This needs to be addressed with the family based on her prognosis.
Communication was kept with her sister, [**Name (NI) 54723**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 54724**]; her daughter, [**Name (NI) 32348**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 54725**] and husband, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 54726**].
