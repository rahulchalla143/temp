Pt decided to see her PCP who did an EKG revealing sinus tachycardia at 103 so pt was sent to ER for further w/u.
Pt denies any exertional chest pain, increased cough, pleuritic chest pain, syncope, recent confusion, back/joint pain, increased thirst, or change in urination.
Labs notable for WBC 13.0 with 84% N and no bands.
The pt had a CXR which demonstrated left upper lobe collapse, and subsequent CT chest w/contrast showed an approximate 4.6cm LUL mass causing complete collapse of the LUL, and concerning for primary lung cancer.
The patient was admitted for further evaluation and work-up of lung mass.
Vitals prior to transfer 97.0, 72, 102/68, 16, 100% RA.
She is hungry and anxious to get the work-up done so she can go home.

Recommend CT evaluation to assess for obstructing lesion.
CT Chest: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 58yoF, former smoker with no other significant PMH here with DOE for the past week and new mass on CXR/Chest CT concerning for primary lung cancer leading to left upper lobe collapse.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Patient will need to obtain a biopsy of this mass for tissue diagnosis that will determine potential treatment options.
Patient is scheduled for an IR biopsy for [**9-13**], though per IP, they will contact patient to try to obtain tissue via bronchoscopy  prior to this date.
Chest X-ray and CT scan of the Chest showed a mass that has caused collapse of part of your left lung.
