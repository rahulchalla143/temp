CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2194-12-1**] demonstrated: right dominant circulation LMCA: 20% distal lesion.
Final angiography showed a 30% residual stenosis of the PLB, a 50% residual stenosis of the mid RCA and no residual stenosis of the RCA origin, a type A dissection of the PLB with normal flow in the vessel (see PTCA comments).

Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 83F CAD w/ DES to RCA+RPL in [**2194**], EF 45%, a-fib not anticoagulation for GIB, now with post-op MI and afib s/p colectomy on [**5-10**]  CAD: The immediate post op course was complicated by SVT, hypotension, and low urine output and she was found to have an NSTEMI with CK peak 708 on [**5-12**].
Echo on [**5-15**] showed EF 45% with new WMA compared with previous echo: anterior, apical, septal HK.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 cardiology step down unit because her telemetry showed HR 110s, although she was quite well appearing satting 98% on RA.
Her heart rate is difficult to rate control.
The hct was trended and remained stable, she was transfused PRBC's for a hematocrit of 22.9 with appropriate response to 26, has remained hemodynamically stable.
She was to resume low dose Coumadin anticoagulation with a target INR of 2.0 at rehab.
CHF, EF 45% Currently euvolemic.
DM2: Sugars were monitored targeting tight glycemic control, episodes of hyperglycemia with euglycemia achieved with the addition of NPH and tight Regular Insulin sliding scale.
FEN/Hypophosphatemia: Electrolytes were monitored and repleted as necessary.
GU: Foley replaced secondary to intermittent leakage, urine culture without bacteria, to be removed at rehab when patient ambulating and able to toilet independently.
