Admission Date: [**2102-12-12**]        Discharge Date: [**2102-12-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2059-10-4**]        Sex:  M  Service:  MICU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, the patient is a 43- year-old male, previously diagnosed with metastatic renal cell cancer, status post nephrectomy of his right kidney with recent clinical course significant for T7 spinal cord compression and large right loculated pleural effusion with pigtail catheter drainage who presented from rehab with shortness of breath, lethargy, pleuritic chest pain, and decrease in hematocrit requiring transfusion.
Prior to transfer, the patient was noted to have systolic blood pressure of approximately 100, to be tachycardiac to 110, and to have continued dyspnea with desaturations to 80 percent on nasal cannula oxygen.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.8 degrees, heart rate 117, blood pressure 134/53, respiratory rate 20, and saturating 98 percent on nasal cannula oxygen.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  CBC, white count 4.5, hematocrit 25, and platelets of 85.
Cardiac enzymes negative.
LFTs significant for isolated alkaline phosphatase elevation of 168.
Chest x-ray, re-accumulation of previously seen right-sided pleural effusion with a density at the right lung base representing pneumonia.
CT of the chest, loculated pleural fluid collections on the right with air-fluid levels consistent with empyemas.
Arterial blood gas on 100 percent nonrebreather mask, 7.2/84/66/34/2.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially taken to Radiology for a CAT scan of the chest to rule out pulmonary embolus, at which time the patient became increasingly lethargic with a decrease in respiratory rate and was intubated for respiratory failure.
While at CT scan, the patient became increasingly dyspneic, the patient was then admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and his hypotension was managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation.
