Cell marker analysis was attempted, but was non-diagnostic in this case due to insufficient numbers of cells.
Brain biopsy pathology results: 1.
Brain, core biopsy #1 (A-B): Glioblastoma, WHO Grade IV.
Brain, core biopsy #2 (C): Glioblastoma, WHO Grade IV.
Brain, core biopsy #3 (D): Glioblastoma, WHO Grade IV.
STUDIES: [**6-2**] CT head: Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation within the right thalamus and posterior limb of the internal capsule, with mild mass effect, which is new compared with [**2138-3-4**], and may represent a recent infarction.
If clinically indicated, this could be better evaluated with MRI  [**6-2**] CT C spine: 1.
[**6-2**] CXR:  FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes, though clear lungs.
Very limited MRA examination demonstrating possible severe narrowing of the distal right M1 segment  [**6-4**] MRI with add'l sequences:  Multiple enhancing lesions along the corpus callosum as described above as well as in the suprasellar region, pineal gland, and right thalamus.
Differential diagnosis involves metastatic disease or lymphoma  CT chest/abd/pelvis [**6-5**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT head [**2139-6-10**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Similar distribution of metastatic lesions in the corpus callosum, suprasellar cistern, right thalamus, and left splenium, better depicted on preceding MRI dated [**2139-6-4**].
EEG [**2139-6-11**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of 29 brief electrographic seizures in the left parietotemporal region as is described earlier under continuous EEG.
A CT was done and revealed a likely subacute ischemic stroke in the right thalamus/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] neuro was contact[**Name (NI) **].
Following the neurology consult she received an MRI/MRA as there appeared to be persistent edema associated with the lesions on CT that would be atypical of a stroke.
The MRI revealed multiple enhancing lesions along the CC and elsewhere concerning for metastatic process versus lymphoma.
The patient was transferred to the neurology service for further work-up and evaluation.
An LP was attempted by the general service and the neurology service unsuccessfully.
The patient was taken for brain biopsy on [**6-10**] which was uncomplicated.
Post-op head CT showed a small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage in the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
CT head appeared stable from her post-op scan.
EEG showed frequent left-sided PLED's which occasionally evolved into runs of rhythmic theta.
EEG monitoring was discontinued on [**6-14**].
She was continued on decadron 4mg Q6hrs for her brain lesions.
Final pathology results revealed grade IV glioblastoma.
Coumadin was held for her brain biopsy on [**6-10**] and was not restarted given the change in her goals of care.
Once the pathology results from her brain biopsy returned and her poor prognosis was recognized, a family meeting was held involving her health care proxy (son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 95250**]), daughter, and close family friend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].
When it became clear that her son would not be able to obtain the necessary paperwork for several weeks the family decided to proceed with terminal extubation.
