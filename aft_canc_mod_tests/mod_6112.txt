He is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in Heme Onc for nasopharyngeal carcinoma diagnosed in [**8-/2183**] after one year of right-sided headache, diplopia, fatigue, and 20-pound weight loss.
Imaging showed nasopharyngeal carcinoma involving the bilateral prevertebral and veli palatini muscles, right foramen ovale, right cavernous sinus, right Meckel cave, and right orbital apex, right infratemporal fossa and carotid space, right petrous apex, and clivus.
He has since undergone XRT, cyberknife, and 3 cycles of cisplatin/5-FU with stable findings on his most recent MRI nasopharynx on [**2184-3-17**] and decreased FDG avidity of his nasopharyngeal mass on his PET-CT on [**2184-4-12**].
He went to [**Hospital3 **] where Hct was found to be 21 (baseline Hct 30).
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.2, P 84, BP 110/70, RR 18, O2sat 100% NRB.
Subsequent ABG was 7.32/52/507 on AC 400/20/10/100%.
Labs with Hct 24.8.
EKG showed sinus tach @ 101 and no ischemic changes.
CXR and CT chest showed peribronchovascular distribution of ground glass opacity c/w aspiration.
CT neck showed blood filling the nares and nasopharynx without active arterial extravasation.
VS: 89, 122/77, O2sat 100% on AC 400/20/10/50%.
The patient was a passenger and complained of mild headache and neck pain afterwards although experienced no loss of consciousness, dizziness, or bleeding; CT head and neck w/o contrast at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 392**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] negative for bleed or fracture.
S/p XRT and bolus cisplatin from [**Date range (2) 76684**], Cyberknife therapy [**Date range (1) 76685**], and 3 cycles of adjuvant cisplatin/5-FU - last on [**2184-3-19**].

Imaging: ======== CT neck: Interval intubation and NG tube placement with mottled air and fluid density compatible with hemorrhage filling the nares and nasopharynx.
There is a similar appearance of nasopharyngeal carcinoma as described on the [**2184-3-17**] MR accounting for differences in imaging technique, and if further evaluation for potential tumor progression is desired, MR is recommended.
CT chest: 1.
CT head: 1.
MRI would be more sensitive for an acute infarction, if clinically indicated.
Erosion of the right medial clivus and the medial margin of the right petrous carotid canal, as seen previously.
Although a GI malignancy is unlikely to appear over the course of 6 months, this focus of FDG avidity should be correlated with any recent sigmoidoscopy or coloscopy.
EKG: Sinus tach at 101 bpm, no ST-T changes, faster rate but otherwise consistent with prior ECG from [**2184-1-12**].
MRI Nasopharynx [**2184-4-22**] IMPRESSION: 1.
HCT on admission was 24.8 and patient received total of 8 units of pRBCs with HCT remaining stable at 31-32 subsequently.
He was taken for angio graphy which showed a pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the petrous and cavernous portion of the distal right ICA.
Post-procedure there was concern for possibility of hemorrhagic stroke and CT head was done which did not show any new infarcts.
Patient had a bronchoscopy with removal of blood (no clots of active bleeding seen), and subsequently successfully extubated on [**4-20**].
Repeat MRI shows interval decrease in size of nasopharyngeal disease with stable encacement of right carotid, invasion of foramen ovale/rotundum.
# Aspiration pneumonia: Patient was febrile to 102 on [**4-19**] and chest xray was obtained which showed infiltrate consistent with aspiration.
He underwent repeat evaluation with video swallow study which showed improvment though he continued to aspirate to a limited extent.
# Ischemic infarcts: MRI obtained to evaluate nasopharyngeal carcinoma showed apparently new right sided ishcemic infarcts, no new neurological deficits were noted.
Ultrasound showed non-occlusive DVT involving the axillary and brachial veins.
Received a total of 8 units of pRBCs, 3L IVF and platelet transfusion in setting of bleed.
WBC increased to 12 from admission likely due to aspiration of blood and possible pneumonia, started on unasyn as above for coverage of aspiration pneumonia.
He underwent MRI to evaluate progression of disease which showed interval decrease in size of nasopharyngeal disease with stable encacement of right carotid, invasion of foramen ovale/rotundum.
