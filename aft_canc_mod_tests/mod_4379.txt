Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Echocardiogram, transesophageal [**2144-4-17**]: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with global hypokinesis and regional akinesis to dyskinesis of the distal LV and apex.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-4-13**], the degree of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] detected has increased.
CT head w/o contrast [**2144-4-14**]: 1.
Otherwise, a followup study can be considered to assess stability/progression, given the lack of prior images  GI bleeding study [**2144-5-1**]: GI bleeding likely within the proximal small bowel present within first 15 minutes.
CTA Abdomen/Pelvis [**2144-5-2**]: 1.
The site of bleeding identified on the GI scan is not identified.
Small bowel enteroscopy [**2144-5-4**]: Mass in the lower third of the esophagus Normal mucosa in the stomach Normal mucosa in the duodenum and jejunum upto 120 cm Otherwise normal EGD to 120 cm  EGD/endoscopic ultrasound [**2144-5-6**]: Mass in the middle third of the esophagus (biopsy) EUS T stage: An exophytic esophageal mass involving the mucosa, submucosa.
CSF [**2144-5-4**]: Negative for malignant cells.
Esophageal biopsy [**2144-5-6**]: 1.
EEG [**2144-5-5**]: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling showed a diffusely slow and disorganized background consisting of mostly theta and delta frequencies.
At the outside hospital, treatment with furosemide dropped the patient's blood pressure to the 90s, and it was felt that inotropic support would be required for diuresis.
Between [**2144-4-13**] and [**2144-4-21**], the patient's fluid balance was negative 12 liters.
Between [**2144-4-21**] and [**2144-5-1**], the patient reaccumulated fluid in the setting of blood transfusions and fluid boluses for GI bleeding and low urine output.
TTE showed EF 20-25%.
# Esophageal carcinoma: An esophageal mass was incidentally noted on an EGD performed on [**2144-4-20**] as part of the patient's work-up for GI bleeding.
The mass was further evaluated with endoscopic ultrasound and biopsied on [**2144-5-6**].
Endoscopic ultrasound revealed invasion to the submucosa (T1).
Her hematocrit remained stable until [**2144-4-18**], when it began to fall, reaching a nadir of 19.4 on [**2144-4-19**].
EGD was notable for an esophageal mass that proved to be an adenocarcinoma but was not felt to be the source of the bleeding.
A GI bleeding study, done on [**2144-5-1**], was suggestive of a proximal small source.
The patient underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**2144-4-27**].
Mandibular culture grew [**Female First Name (un) **] and vancomycin-resistent enterococcus.
On admission, her albumin was 1.9.
# MRSA Bacteremia: Blood culture [**2144-4-12**] was positive for MRSA.
The patient also had a sputum culture from [**2144-4-13**] that grew MRSA and Proteus.
LP was performed and was notable only for minimally elevated protein.
EEG did not show any epileptiform activity.
