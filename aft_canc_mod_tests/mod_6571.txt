They decided to come to the ED tonight, where a Head CT demonstrated a new L parietal occipital mass with edema  Past Medical History: Neuroendocrine tumor resection  Social History: Married.

CT C/A/P [**8-12**]: MPRESSION: 1.
MRI Head [**8-13**]: MPRESSION: 1.
Diagnostic considerations include lymphoma, particularly if the patient is immunocompromised, neuroendocrine tumor metastasis, and glioblastoma multiforme.
Dilatation of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle is suggestive of trapping, given compression of the atrium of the left lateral ventricle.
MRI Head [**8-14**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head [**8-15**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the OMed service for further work up of this newfound brain mass, which entailed MRI imaging and neuro-oncology consults.
MRI revealed a large L-sided occipital mass with edema and entrapment of the lateral ventricle.
He tolerated the procedure well and went immediately to CT Scan, where no post operative hemorrhage was revealed.
MRI showed some evidence of residual tumor, but was otherwise intact.
On [**8-17**], patient's aphasia was slightly improving, his exam stable and he was transferred to SDU.
EKG was done and showed no changes from previous EKG.
Patient was asymptomatic, but cardiac enzymes were ordered.
His enzymes and ECG were both normal, and no further cardiac events persisted.
His expressive aphasia was improved since surgery, but consistent with his preoperative status.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
