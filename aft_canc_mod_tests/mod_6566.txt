Her VS were stable at the time (BP 148/78) She reports 3 bloody BMs at her nursing home after being given lactulose 2 am, another 2 at [**Hospital3 4107**], and 1 in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Pt was unable to report the consistency and color of the blood [**1-23**] her body habitus, but states she was told it was 'red and bloody' and clotted.
Her INR was recently supratherapeutic to 4.7 on [**4-28**] -> 3.6 on [**4-30**].8 on [**5-2**], and 2.0 on [**5-9**].
Labs significant for a Cre of 1.3, INR of 2.5, and Hct was noted to be 29.3 She had 2 PIVs placed and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Labs notable for Hct stable at 28.6 and Cre of 1.2.
GI was consulted in the ED, who recommended INR reversal and NPO for possible colonoscopy tomorrow vs. tagged RBC scan.
On transfer, VS were afebrile 66 161/62 14 94% on room air.
Pertinent Results: wbc [**6-28**] hgb 9->10s stable HCT 28->31 2U->29->32s stable BUN/Creat 31/1.2-->10/0.8 INR 2.2->1.3 LFTs wnl Trop 0.03->0.01  .
Imaging/results: CXR [**5-15**]: IMPRESSION: Technically limited study.
Ulceration in the anus-->biopsy Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum Recommendations: Follow-up biopsies.
Pt will need repeat colonoscopy in near future for removal of polyps.
Recieved 2U more prbc for active hematochezia and 2U FFP and Vitamin K for INR 2.5 at OSH.
Her HCT stabilized around 30s and she was transfered out of MICU [**5-14**].
C-scope showed diverticulosis, rectal ulcer (would not have expected such a brisk bleed), and polyps (nonbleeding)-->likely diverticular bleed.
Her HCT was above 30 for 4days before discharge.
Also her BP was not controlled and her lisinopril was increased to 10, dilt added as above, and lasix added as above.
Her BP was 120/80s but would go to 180SBP when she was anxious/upset.
Her O2 sats were okay 92% during day but she would desat at night, likely OSA, she has refused CPAP in past.
Acute GI bleed: Patient likely with lower GI bleed given history of diverticulosis and HDS while active hematochezia.
Hct 29-30 stable after total 3U prbc.
INR reversed with ffp and vit K. -C-scope [**5-17**] with diverticulosis, rectal ulcer (would not have expected such a brisk bleed), and polyps (nonbleeding)-->still suspect was a diverticular bleed -needs f/u C-scope for removal of polyps in future -GI will contact with biopsy of rectal ulcer to r/o bleed -EGD not done because high risk, again, very low suspicion for UGIG, d/c IV PPI, place on oral -resume coumadin in 1 week -can resume ASA now .
Pt is total body volume overloaded and has effusions on CXR -no more fluids -s/p lasix 40mg IV [**5-15**] and 20mg IV on [**5-16**], creat 0.8--> so far pt about negative 5L -start on lasix 40mg QD-can titrate to [**Hospital1 **] as BP and creat tolerates -lisinopril-titrate dose .
Atrial fibrillation/RVR: Rates were not well controlled while here.
-will resume coumadin in 1 week given they biopsied rectal ulcer yesterday--notify [**Hospital1 1501**] -dilt started and titrated to 240mg-->HR is now in 80s .
Chronic Pain: - continue home pain meds, including neurontin 900mg [**Hospital1 **]  and vicodin/tylenol prn .
EKG with non-specific ST-T wave changes.
FEN/Proph: HLIV, monitor and replete electrolytes, hold bowel regimen, diabetic diet, hold AC, SCDs, PO PPI, continue vitamins .
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
titrate dose for INR [**1-24**].
Calcium 500 + D 500 mg(1,250mg) -200 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
After some delays, you underwent colonoscopy which showed diverticulosis.
this also showed a rectal ulcer and a biopsy was taken which is pending at the time of discharge (GI will contact you with results).
Protonix was started to protect you from ulcers  Followup Instructions: Please arrange a follow up with a gastroenterologist of your choice to perform colonoscopy to remove polyps .
