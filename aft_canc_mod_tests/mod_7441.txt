CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast:  No evidence of retroperitoneal or groin hematoma.
Irregular and enhancing fluid collection in mid and left pelvis, which possibly represents the bladder and may be related to vesicovaginal fistula, but an abscess cannot be excluded.

She also received another two units of packed red blood cells, which brought her post transfusion hematocrit to 34.7.
The patient did require an addition two units of packed red blood cells after the hematocrit was noted to drop to 27.3.
The patient responded well to the blood transfusions and subsequently the hematocrit has remained stable.
