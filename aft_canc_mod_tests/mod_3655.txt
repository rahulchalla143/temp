HIs WBC trended downward however his oxygen requirment continued to increase.
He underwent CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which demonstrated extensive hilar, mediastinal, retroperitoneal, iliac and inguinal adenopathy.
He underwent CT neck which revealed stable LN dz in neck, and LN enlargement in mediastinum  He underwent echo with normal EF and was evaluated by cardiology who felt his symptoms were consistent with CHF.
His hospital course was complicated by the development of acute renal failure with a Cr of 4.6 and agitation requiring haldol.
He underwent diagnostic paracentesis which revealed atypical cells on cytology and WBC 14,030,  RBC 38,000, with 41% Neutropil concerning for SBP.

CTA was negative for PE as a potential source.
Course was further complicated by MRSA tracheobronchitis treated with Vancomycin ([**7-20**]-expected [**7-29**] to complete 10 day course).
Therefore he was started on activated protein C. His fibrinogen levels subsequently improved with stable coags and platelets.
Currently he is normotensive with BP 130's-150's/50's-80's without use of pressors - given improvement of hypotension with antibiotic treatment, likely etiology was sepsis.
Repeat ultrasound showed loculated abdominal ascites, not felt to be ammenable to paracentesis.
Repeat ultrasound [**7-13**] showed small amount of ascites.
He is currently with slightly distended, non-firm, non-tender abdomen, on Ciprofloxacin 400mg 1x/wk for SBP prophylaxis.
Treated with IVF, allopurinol and close monitoring of electrolytes.
# Pulmonary Hypertension -- an echo on [**7-2**] showed severe pulmonary HTN associated with 2+ mitral regurgitation.
rash started after starting multiple antibiotics, biopsy performed, felt to be drug rash associated with antibiotics most likely ceftriaxone, improved on steroids.
