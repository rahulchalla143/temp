Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.
TTE [**2199-4-30**] There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-4-30**], the severity of aortic regurgitation is now reduced.
TTE [**2199-5-2**] Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-5-1**], the appearance of aortic regurgitation by color flow Doppler is increased.
TTE [**2199-5-3**] The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-5-2**], no change.
TTE [**2199-5-6**]: PRELIM: The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).

He received a third unit PRBC on arrival to CCU for Hct 25 and bumped appropriately, after which his Hct stabilized and he required no further transfusions.
Bedside echo post-procedure showed moderate to severe aortic regurgitation.
CK and LFTs checked 8 hours post-procedure were normal.
He was monitored for PAD pressures with swan ganz catheter and gently diuresed for pressures consistently > 25.
blood pressure was optimized with nitro gtt (for HTN) and phenylephrine gtt (for hypotension) per study protocol during the post-op period.
Repeat echo on POD#4 showed mild to mod aortic regurgitation and on POD#6 showed mod AR.
He remained hemodynamically stable and repeat echo did show some improvement in AR.
Optimized BP and HR as above to manage this.
held lisinopril due to contrast load and expectation of contrast nephropathy.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - follow up AR with hemodynamic monitoring and echo - f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] re: [**Last Name (STitle) **] protocol s/p discharge - f/u patient status at home for safety  Medications on Admission: Levothyroxine 100 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Please get your INR checked when you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24717**] this week.
