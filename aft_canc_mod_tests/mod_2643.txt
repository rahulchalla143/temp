The appearance of the left ventricular myocardium suggests infiltrative disease.
While estimated pulmonary systolic pressures are normal, they are likely UNDERestimated (or the right ventricular function is so poor that it cannot elevate its pressure).
-renal/abdominal ultrasound - Echogenic liver compatible with fatty infiltration.
Abdominal wall metastases cannot be excluded on this study.
A CT scan is recommended for further evaluation.
Ideally, this would be with intravenous contrast; however, a non-contrast CT may still useful in the setting of acute renal failure.
Echocardiogram showed moderate symmetric LVH with moderately depressed systolic function, restrictive left ventricular filling, and a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle, and the appearance of the left ventricular myocardium suggested infiltrative disease (likely amyloid).
Pyrophosphate scan showed update throughout mycardium, suggestive of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis.
# Acute Kidney Injury/Pre-Renal - creatinine on admission was 2.2 (from baseline of 1.3 earlier in the week, per conversation with PCP).
This continued to rise during the first several days of the hospital course, elevating as high as 3.1 with anuria, but Cr began to decline and urine output began to improve with aggressive diuresis (lasix gtt).
Likely was pre-renal in etiology based on urine electrolytes and exam.
Creatinine at discharge improved to 1.0.
# Altered mental status - CT head was negative for acute intracranial process in the emergency room.
# Elevated troponins - there did not appear to be any acute ST or T-wave changes suggestive of ischemia, and her troponins trended down quickly after admission.
#Ventricular Ectopy/Non sustained Ventricular tachycardia- Patient has had multiple episodes of asymptomatic NSVT likely secondary to her infiltrative and restrictive cardiomyopathy.
# Thrombocytopenia - Patient's platelets initially dropped (200->85) while on Heparin SQ (prophylaxis).
CHRONIC ISSUES:  # Anemia - per PCP baseline hematocrit is in 30??????s.
HCT 28-33 range throughout admission.
In addition, TTR gene testing will be performed and run at [**Hospital 3278**] Medical Center or sent away, depending on Dr.[**Name (NI) 50760**] discretion.
# Patient's UTI was positive for Proteus mirabilis which was sensitive to ciprofloxacin which she was started on a 10-day course on [**6-4**].
Her tenderness on her flank subsided and her GPC coverage was meant for 10-days.
Information was obtained from Patient.
You came to the hospital for a fast heart rate and swelling in your feet.
