URINE CULTURE (Pending): IMMUNOPHENOTYPING - MEDIASTINAL MASS/EBUS TBNA Report not finalized.
Chronic systolic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%.
A chest CT was performed which showed that there was a large mediastinal mass which was compressing the right/left atrium, as well as the lower segment of the right lung, and esophagus.
The patient's heart rate was initially very difficult to control.
She had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate to the 140s-150s which did not result in hemodynamic instability or chest pain.
Her blood pressure tolerated this medication regimen and she remained in normal sinus rhythm with occasional asymptomatic PVCs prior to discharge.
Her anticoagulation, pradaxa, transitioned to UFH in order to obtain a surgical biopsy and subsequently transistioned to LMWH (Lovenox) in the event that she would require another procedure should the pathologic specimen obtained during biopsy (see below) be insufficient.
Since the etiology of the patient's problems were secondary to mass effect caused by the mediastinal neoplasm, tissue biopsy was necessary to inform future decisions on definitive oncologic management.
Interventional pulmonolgy performed endobronchial biopsy and exploration of the lung for tissue sampling and airway management.
FNA and tissue biopsy was obtained.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 2643**],  You were admitted for workup and evaluation of your atrial fibrillation.
It will most likely take another 4 or 5 days for the final pathology from your biopsy to come back.
There is a small chance that you will need a repeat biopsy for a definitive tissue diagnosis, however, this is unlikely.
