[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 216**], with subsequently decreasing hematocrit drop.
On arrival, the patient's blood pressure was 115/63, however, decreased to systolic 80s on two episodes.
Three plus mitral regurgitation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy seen on echocardiogram on present admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 99.0 F.; blood pressure 120/58; pulse 84; respiratory rate 20; weight 74.2 kilograms.
Pulmonary examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally with good breath sounds; no evidence of wheezing or crackles.
On cardiac examination:  Demonstrated a holosystolic murmur V/VI, loudest at the apex.
Abdominal examination nontender, nondistended.
The Gastrointestinal tagged red blood cell study on [**2188-2-14**], had demonstrated very small amounts of gastrointestinal bleeding in the left upper quadrant, probably within the small bowel.
As the patient's hematocrit stabilized and he was not having any more melanotic stools, he was transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the Medicine Floor, at which time the [**Hospital1 **] Team began his care.
The patient was maintained on the floor with close monitoring of his hematocrit status.
Although the patient's troponin were less than 0.1, they had trended up during that time to 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03, suggesting real demand ischemia.
On a separate occasion, the patient became very tachycardic and his heart rate was ranging between the 110s and 120s.
On a separate occasion when the patient's hematocrit was 28.1, he was being evaluated by Physical Therapy and walked approximately five feet before feeling lightheadedness and extremely diaphoretic.
As well, he underwent several studies with Gastroenterology including esophagogastroduodenoscopy and duodenoscopy on [**2188-2-19**], which demonstrated angiectasias in the second part of the duodenum; thermal therapy was applied.
Because of dropping hematocrits and recurrent melanotic stools, the patient also underwent a pill study on [**2188-2-22**] which demonstrated some fresh blood and active bleeding from arteriovenous malformations in the proximal small bowel.
Impressions of the study demonstrated erythema and nodularity in the antrum compatible with gastritis, angiectasias in the proximal jejunum at 1 meter.
Blood in the jejunum and otherwise normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy to the jejunum.
The patient's hematocrits were relatively stable for the next couple of days with no melanotic stools reported; however on [**2188-2-26**], the patient experienced one melanotic stool around 05:30 a.m.
According to the night float, the patient was pale with a blood pressure of 80/40, heart rate in the 90s.
The patient had two large bore intravenous lines; normal saline was started wide open with improvement in blood pressure to 135/80s.
Gastrointestinal lavage demonstrated two liters of normal saline with dark red material not fully cleared.
EKG demonstrated T wave inversions and ST depressions in V3 through V5, although difficult for comparison because his EKG at baseline is abnormal.
Cardiac enzymes were drawn at that time.
Hematocrit was drawn which came back at 27 from 31 the previous night.
