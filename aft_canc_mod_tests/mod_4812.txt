Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo male with ESRD on HD, RCC and prostate cancer, h/o dementia who was transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] for evaluation and treatment of a lower GI bleed.
#) GI BLEED: Mr. [**Known lastname 86684**] initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] with a BRBPR, and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
On [**2136-3-5**] he was started on a bowel prep for EGD and colonoscopy on [**2136-3-6**], he was able to tolerate the prep well.
Colonoscopy showed a 10 cm area of erythema, ulceration and diffuse oozing/friability from cecum to proximal ascending colon.
His hematocrit remained stable, so he was transferred to the general medicine floor.
#) LEUKOCYTOSIS: White count on admission was elevated at 19.5, given his loose stools prior to admission there was concern for a GI source of bleeding.
His stool was sent for multiple studies, due to concern for possible infection that could have led to a GI bleed.
In the work up for his leukocytosis urine and blood cultures were sent, the urine grew Strep viridans and he was found to have coagulase negative staph growing in his blood cultures.
All surveillance blood cultures drawn after that point were negative.
He also had a CT scan that showed colitis, for which he completed a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin.
#) ELEVATED TROPONIN: Given the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 47**] risk factors of DM and HTN, cardiac enzymes were trended.
The gastroenterologists did a colonoscopy that showed a large ulcer in part of your small intestine, but they could not stop the bleeding.
After your blood counts had been stable for a few days we were able to restart your blood pressure medications.
