Osteomyelitis: upon presentation, the patient was afebrile, with a WBC of 11.7, and a lactate of 0.7.
Foot x-rays were notable for osteomyelitis.
Initial tissue cultures grew gram negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs.
The wound was once again left open, and repeat foot x-rays showed no osteomyelitis.
Multiple cultures from the site revealed mixed flora, and patient was maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics at discharge; he is to follow-up with infectious disease and podiatry to follow-up with bone biopsy and for further antibiotic titration.
He completed a three day course of steroids and was monitored on telemetry.
Leukocytosis: throughout the patient's stay, his white blood count was persistently elevated, peaking at 21.2.
Liver function tests monitored and improved within normal range at discharge.
At discharge, blood glucose was well-controlled on the above regimen.
