General surgery was consulted and took the patient emergently to the OR on [**11-8**] for a right LE fasciotomy for an apparent fasciitis.An exploratory lap was also done and a gastrojejunostomy tube was placed.
Blood cultures were positive on [**11-8**] (POD # 13) for gram negative rods and Zosyn, ampiciliin and clindamycin were added for coverage.
Pupils became non-reactive without corneal reflexes on the eve of POD #16.CT scan done on [**11-11**] showed a catastrophic cerebral bleed with compression of the brainstem per neurology consult.
