He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 110979**] for evaluation and management of L pleural effusion/hemothorax.
His INR was also persistently high, despite having his coumadin held for his procedures.
Blood work was sent which showed a Hct of 22 and new leukocytosis.
In the ED, T96, BP 97/41, HR 68, RR 16, 96% 2L.
CXR, CT head, LLE LENIs performed.
They also have [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] in [**Location (un) 86**].
Physical Exam: VS: T 96.5, HR 100, BP 142/71, RR 38, 94% 4L NC Gen: awake, moaning, not answering questions, moderate work of breathing HEENT: anicteric sclera, MM dry, PERRL Neck: supple, RIJ intact Heart: tachy, irregular, no obvious murmurs Lung: Coarse BS diffusely with decreased BS at L base.

PT: 15.1 PTT: 38.2 INR: 1.3 .
[**2117-5-4**] Portable CXR - Continued left mid and lower lung opacification, unchanged.
[**2117-5-4**] CT Head - No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or large masses.
[**2117-5-4**] Left LENI - 1.
[**2117-5-5**] Echo The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[**5-6**] CT Torso w/o contrast: CHEST: There is consolidation within the right lower lobe.
The evaluation of the solid organs is limited by non-contrast technique.
PELVIS: Evaluation of the pelvis is limited due to extensive streak artifact from patient's bilateral hip arthroplasties.
[**5-9**] CT Chest FINDINGS:  Compared to the recent study, there is interval increase in the secretions within the trachea as well as within the left main bronchus, and left upper and left lower lobe bronchi with subsequent development of an atelectasis which involves almost entire left lower lobe with and a significant part of left upper lobe with sparing of the apex.
The rest of the right lower lobe and the right upper lobe is grossly unremarkable but note is made that the quality of the study is not optimal due to the presence of motion artifact.
The extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy is unchanged with lymph nodes in the aortopulmonic window, right upper and lower paratracheal area and prevascular location ranging up to 13 mm and the paraortic lymph node, 4:112, is 17 x 12 mm, all of them unchanged since the prior study.
The original dictation has been lost and the study that was done on [**5-9**], [**2116**] has been redictated today on [**2117-5-11**].
Hyperdense (25 Hounsfield units) right renal cyst.
[**5-10**] CT head FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
The ventricles and sulci remain prominent, likely due age-related parenchymal atrophy.
[**5-13**] IMPRESSION: AP chest 2:39 a.m. [**5-13**] submitted for review on [**5-17**] compared to [**5-12**]:  Left pleural effusion and left lower lobe consolidation improving since [**5-11**], consolidation at the right lung base and small right pleural effusion unchanged.
