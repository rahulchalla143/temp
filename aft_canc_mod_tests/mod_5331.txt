Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left sided high parietal craniotomy, with intra-operative imaging Evacuation of hematoma, resection of underlying mass, microscopic disection Duraplasty with allograft, cranioplasty with dural graft.
He was, therefore, seen at an outside hospital in the emergency room and was worked up including a CAT scan showing a left sided high parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management.
Repeat MRI scan showed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage with a questionable underlying mass and a second lesion anterior to it.
Reflexes 2+ bilaterally.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted images of the brain were obtained.
There was enhancement along the margins of the hemorrhage on the preoperative studies and there continues to be an ill-defined area of enhancement in the location of the most inferior component of the hemorrhagic mass - involving the white matter along the superior margin of the posterior left lateral ventricle.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 axial, sagittal and coronal images of the brain were obtained following the administration of gadolinium.
MRA OF THE HEAD:  The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.

TECHNIQUE: CT of the torso was performed using oncology protocol.
CT without contrast of the abdomen was performed, followed by images of the torso after contrast.
A total of 150 cc of Optiray nonionic contrast was given for this examination.
Nonionic contrast was used given single kidney status.
FINDINGS:  CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: The patient is status post right nephrectomy.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The large bowel, bladder, and distal ureters are unremarkable aside from diffuse diverticulosis.
Examination of osseous structures show degenerative changes of the hips.
Repeat MRI on [**2133-11-28**] showed  intraparenchymal hemorrhage with a questionable underlying mass and a second lesion anterior to it.
He was admitted to the ICU for further observation and work-up and was taken to the operating room on [**2133-11-30**] for decompression, evacuation of hematoma, resection of underlying mass and biopsy (for further details please see dictated operative note).
A chest/abdomen/pelvis CT scan was obtained to assess for metastatic disease (see results section) showing significant lung lesions as well as possible spine lesions.
Visual field testing was done on post operative day 3 and patient was discharged to rehab on post-operative day 4 with instructions for follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the neuro-oncology.
