Head CT without contrast revealed approximately 3cm left cerebellar hemsiphere mass and approximately 3cm left frontal pole lesion with associated mass effect and edema posteriorly.

TECHNIQUE: Helical acquisition of CT images performed from the thoracic inlet through the ischial tuberosities following administration of both oral and IV contrast.
There is a large 1.9 x 1.8 cm prevascular lymph node which extends to the AP window, as well as numerous non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal nodes, the next largest situated in a right precarinal location measuring 10 x 10 mm.
Specimen adequacy evaluation performed by S. McCune,   CT(ASCP) on [**2184-6-1**]:   Pass #1 - Inadequate.
Passes #[**1-26**] - Not evaluated.
Pass #5 - Adequate - Atypical cells present.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-5-29**] 9:03 PM There are multiple intracranial masses both supra and infratentorially.
Final Report CT TORSO ON [**5-30**]  IMPRESSION: Presumably stage IV lung cancer, with a large left upper lobe mass, enlarged mediastinal lymph node and bilateral adrenal masses, left much greater than right.
CT STEREOTAXIS W/ CONTRAST Study Date of [**2184-6-2**] 9:54 AM FINDINGS: Artifacts arising from the metallic base of the stereotactic apparatus obscure imaging detail within the posterior fossa.
However, the MR- demonstrated metastatic lesions are still visible, with the largest being within the left frontal lobe and the left cerebellar hemisphere, the latter lesion extending to the vermis.
CONCLUSION: Stereotactic planning CT scan, with redemonstration of multiple presumed metastatic lesions in the brain.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2184-6-2**] 5:56 PM FINDINGS: There has been no significant change.
MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST  [**2184-6-2**] 11:50 PM FINDINGS: The multiple enhancing metastatic lesions, in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and in the left frontal lobe, are redemonstrated, for surgical planning.
Limited evaluation of the brain, with planning axial MP-RAGE sequence.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-6-2**] 5:56 PM FINDINGS: There has been no significant change.
She underwent CT of the torso which revealed a large left upper lobe mass, enlarged mediastinal lymph node and bilateral adrenal masses, left much greater than right.
Instead she underwent a biopsy of the right adrenal gland on [**6-1**].
The pathology was consistent with non-small cell lung cancer.
Her post-op CT scan was stable.
