Admission Date:  [**2119-1-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-1-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-6-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8810**] Chief Complaint: Fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: A 68-year-old woman with a history of recurrent B-cell lymphoma, who is currently being treated on Protocol #08-164, A Phase 1/2a Open-label study of Praltrexate and Gemcitabine and Vitamin B12 and Folic acid Supplementation in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Lymphoproliferative Malignancies who received her C2D15 treatment on [**2119-1-23**].
In ED vitals were stable but she had a temp of 100.1.
Physical exam revealed no focal source of infection.
Labs revealed a borderline low wcc of 3.6.
Following recovery, she received one cycle of maintenance rituximab in [**10/2117**] with a followup PET scan in [**12/2117**] showed worsening adenopathy with biopsy consistent with her known lymphoma.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 103705**] underwent a restaging PET scan on [**2118-11-11**] which  unfortunately showed interval development of a single 21.7 mm focus of prevascular adenopathy.
Given that Mrs. [**Known lastname 103705**] has a history of agressive lymphoma and clonal T cell process along with connective tissue disease that can cause benign adenopathy, we arranged for a CT guided biopsy on [**2118-11-22**].
The biopsy results showed high grade diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and polymorphic T cell dominant lymphoid population that raised the possibility of concurrent T cell lymphoma.
CHF (most recent EF 60% on [**5-16**]/200) 4.

TTE [**2119-1-25**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-5-16**] the amount of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation have increased slightly.
CXR [**2119-1-25**]: A right subclavian Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium.
Digoxin level was elevated at 3.2.
EKG showed no ST changes, ECHO showed normal LVEF, no pericardial effusion or significant valvular abnormalities and CXR was suggestive of pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
She was started on Vanco/Cefepime for the pneumonia, which was later switched to Levofloxacin.
Finally, bilateral LENIs were negative for DVT and CTA chest (pt was premedicated for it given h/o allergy) showed no PE.
