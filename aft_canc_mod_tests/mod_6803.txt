Pertinent Results: Labs notable for WBC of 15.3 and Hct of 59.4.
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH WAS COMPARED TO [**2201-6-26**], AND CHEST CT FROM [**2201-6-26**].
The known right upper lobe spiculated lesion is again demonstrated suspicious for pneumonia as well as the right apical lesion, which was described on the recent CT torso but not optimally visualized on the current radiograph.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained through the brain without intravenous contrast.
Findings are concerning for underlying fractures and a facial bone CT is recommended for further characterization.
Moderate left frontal soft tissue hematoma and multiple fluid levels in the paranasal sinuses, concerning for underlying fractures.
A facial bone CT is recommended for further characterization.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2201-6-26**] 3:47 AM  CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  Reason: FOUND DOWN  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 85 year old man with found down in bathroom with lac on forehead, increasingly unresponsive.
COMPARISON: Noncontrast head CT performed concurrently.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained through the cervical spine without intravenous contrast.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2201-6-26**] 3:48 AM  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  Reason: FOUND DOWN, HX CA.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained through the chest prior to and following administration of intravenous Optiray contrast.
Additional delayed images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis.
CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: No filling defects are seen within the pulmonary arterial vasculature to indicate an underlying pulmonary embolus.
The spleen, adrenal glands, and unopacified loops of bowel are grossly unremarkable.
A 1-cm and 1.5 cm cystic lesion in the mid right and lower left kidney respectively do not meet CT criteria for a simple cyst and are incompletely characterized.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Multiple surgical clips are seen in the pelvis from previous prostatectomy.
1.5 cm cystic lesions in the kidneys which do not meet CT criteria for a simple cyst.
If clinically indicated, further evaluation with renal ultrasound could be performed when the patient's condition allows.
Bone scan could be performed if indicated to assess for additional foci of osseous metastasis.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2201-6-26**] 5:31 AM  CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIA  Reason: ?fracture  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 85 year old man with fall.
CT SINUS WITHOUT CONTRAST, [**2201-6-26**]  HISTORY: Fall.
Contiguous axial images were obtained through the paranasal sinuses.
No prior sinus imaging studies are available for comparison.
Comparison to a head CT scan of [**2201-6-26**] at 4 a.m.
COMPARISON: CT from [**2201-6-26**].
Additionally, 1.7 x 2 cm spiculated right upper lobe subpleural opacity only partially reflects the larger subpleural lesion well visualized on the recent CT.
Right upper lobe spiculated nodular foci as described above only partially visualized on the current study and were better evaluated on the recent CT torso.

Right upper lobe spiculated nodular foci as described above only partially visualized on the current study and were better evaluated on the recent CT torso.
He was supported in the ICU and his serial CT scans of the brain had improved.
CT of chest and pelvis showed: 1.0 cm right upper lobe nodule, spiculated mass in the right upper lobe and nodular thickening along chain sutures in the posterior superior left lung concerning for carcinoma.
