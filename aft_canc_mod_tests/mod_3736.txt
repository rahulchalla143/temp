She had an MRI which showed 4 enhancing cerebellar lesions, thought to be consistent with metastatic cancer.
She underwent a CT scan chest at OSH (read by our radiologists)which showed a RUL lung mass with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Initial EKG showed ST depressions inferiorly and laterally.
Repeat ECG showed ST elevations in V2 and V3 and post-procedure cxray showed moderate R sided pneumothorax.

LV systolic function appears depressed with spetal akinesis/hypokinesis and anterior hypokinesis (views are suboptimal).
Overall LV ejection fraction estimate is ?45%?
These may be inflammatory, but it is unclear if these preceded the current pneumonia as no prior CT exams are available for comparison.
Bone scan could be obtained if indicated for further evaluation.
Upon transfer to the oncology service, she was diuresed further but given mild improvement in her respiratory status a CT scan chest was done.
CT revealed multifocal opacities.
Tissues obtained during bronchoscopy was nondiagnostic.
Patient and family are still unsure about brain biopsy and further work-up will be deferred as outpatient once her respiratory status improves.
She remained hypertensive throughout her stay in the MICU and required her to be on a nitro gtt for better blood pressure control.
Urine electrolytes and osmolality were checked and confirm diagnosis of SIADH.
She was already on Vancomycin for her pneumonia, which was also appropriate coverage for her UTI.
Cultures were rechecked and showed resolution.
6)STEMI: Patient found to have ST depressions/elevations on EKG after bronchoscopy which have normalized since then.
Cardiology was consulted in the ICU and did not feel that her presentation was consistent with acute coronary syndrome.
