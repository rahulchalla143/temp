She was eventually seen when it has got such a big size and there was ulceration and exudation when an MRI showed a 9.7 x 7.1 x 7.9 cm mass in that shoulder, which was lobulated.
A CT scan on [**3-29**], [**2119**], showed multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules.
She had a staging brain MRI in [**2120-4-19**], which showed no metastatic lesion.
She went to the [**State 1727**] emergency room and had a head CT, which showed a posterior fossa mass.
She was sent to the [**Hospital1 69**] and an MRI was done.

MRI Head [**8-22**]: FINDINGS: As seen on the preceding CT scan, there is a mass centered within the anterior medial aspect of the left cerebellar hemisphere, demonstrating predominant T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity.
Overall dimensions are 1.4 x 1.5 x 1.8 cm.
Primary differential considerations would include metastatic disease or lymphoma, primary tumors such as hemangioblastoma and abscess.
