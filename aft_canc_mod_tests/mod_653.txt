Subsequently on [**8-2**] +5/5 blood cultures from admission returned MSSA sensitive to oxacillin and patient was switched from vancomycin to oxacillin.
He is currently on a low prn dose of oxycodone/  2.MSSA sepsis/bacteremia--Patient with MSSA sepsis secondary to epidural abcess/osteomyletis (+[**5-18**] for MSSA [**7-28**]--MRI w. gad), initially treated with vancomycin for 4 days prior to culture results sensitivity indicating MSSA, now on day 4 of oxacillin and subsequent surveillance cultures ([**7-31**], 7?20, [**8-3**]) have been negative.
Oxacillin can be continued with weekly LFT's, with the consideration that elevation of his LFT's are elevated in response to his resolving bacteremia/sepsis 3.UTI - E. Coli resolved on full course of Levoquin.

Renal U/S negative for other causes.UPEP/SPEP-no MM> 6.
GIB/anemia: hct 29.3 down from baseline of 35-39.
Neuro status/epidural abcess -as above: patient discharged with normal lower extremity examneurological exam--no sensory or motor deficits, although his exam is limited by pain--active hip flexion limited to 45 degrees.
Follow up treatement will require oxacillin until [**2101-9-11**], an MRI 1 month from this discharge and weekly LFT's to check for oxacillin tox--consider of resolving cholestatsis secondary tos sepsis.
