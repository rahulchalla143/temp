The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Upon admission to the floor, she was transferred to the MICU for ongoing respiratory distress and urgent bronchoscopy with extensive infiltrates seen on CT Chest.
She received vancomycin and cefepime prior to admission to the ICU and also underwent a CTA chest that was negative for PE.
Bronchoscopy was performed.
BAL culture grew Psudomonas aerginoasa sensitive to Cefepime and CIprofloxacin.
We also gave you IVIG because your antibody levels were low.
Please weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
Followup Instructions: You have you an appointment this Friday [**2173-6-11**] at 8:30 am in [**Hospital 3242**] clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
You will also have your labs drawn at that time.
