A head MRI showed a large dura-based mass in the right frontal brain.
A follow up MRI on [**2183-6-26**] showed a 0.5-mm dural based nodular enhancement and he was referred here for SRS.
Surveillance MRI on [**2184-12-8**] revealed growth of the meningioma in the superior margin of the surgical cavity invading the skull.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-7-15**], the findings are similar.
Head CT [**2188-8-31**]:  Multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered within the right frontal lobe with surrounding edema is relatively unchanged when compared to prior exam.
MRI [**2188-8-22**]: Status post interval resection of right frontal scalp mass and the contiguous extra-axial enhancing lesions.
There are findings suggestive of ischemia in the right frontal lobe which is new compared to the prior study of [**2188-8-21**].
Labs on Admission: [**2188-8-21**] 11:30AM BLOOD WBC-2.5* RBC-3.39* Hgb-11.0* Hct-29.7* MCV-87 MCH-32.5* MCHC-37.1* RDW-14.1 Plt Ct-202 [**2188-8-21**] 08:20AM BLOOD PT-23.0* PTT-33.7 INR(PT)-2.2* [**2188-8-21**] 05:45PM BLOOD Glucose-196* UreaN-15 Creat-1.2 Na-142 K-3.9 Cl-105 HCO3-26 AnGap-15 [**2188-8-21**] 05:45PM BLOOD Calcium-10.0 Phos-3.3 Mg-2.5 .
On admission, his coagulation studies were elevated, requiring the use of FFP infusion and vitamin K infusion to correct prior to surgery.
He also underwent an intraoperative TEE for further interrogation of this process.
On the morning of [**2188-8-30**], patient was given metoprolol IV 5mg x1 for atrial flutter with heart rate in 130s.
Patient was started on Acebutolol, Amiodarone 100mg qd and digoxin 0.125mg.
In 1 month need to discuss with Neurosurgery and Cardiology re-starting anti-coagulation **** .
# Hypothyroidism: Repeat TSH 1.3, however free T4 remained elevated at 1.9.
# Hematuria: Urine culture negative.
Condom cath did not work, patient currently incontinent.
When patient becomes more oriented can d/c foley - recheck Ua for hematuria in [**1-23**] months .
# DM: Morning NPH units increased to 14 from 12 as blood sugars slightly elevated.Can adjust sliding scale at rehab as appropriate.
Pepcid (Famotidine)(20 mg daily)  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Meningioma Atrial fibrillation with RVR .
