His fingersticks at this point had improved, however his blood pressure was found to be low with a systolic between 90 and 100 with his baseline being about 150 to 160.
At that point, he also had an anion gap of 24 and was believed in DKA.
His EKG showed new ST depressions in leads V3 through V6.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.4 F, blood pressure 101/42, heart rate 100, respiratory rate 16, saturating 100% on nonrebreather.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Pupils equal and reactive to light.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Include white count of 20.2, hematocrit 39, platelets 356.
Sodium 131, potassium 3.8, chloride 89, bicarbonate 18, BUN 31, creatinine 3.3, glucose 764.
He has an albumin of 2.9, positive acetones and INR of 1.2.
He responded very well to 14 units of Humalog q. two hours until blood pressure was normalized.
as his sugars were several times in the 60s to 80s.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  During his MICU stay, the patient had an episode of several hypotension with blood pressure about 70/palp.
A set of cardiac enzymes at this point revealed a troponin of 50 and the patient was taken for catheterization to the Cardiac Lab.
The catheterization there revealed a stenotic lesion in the LDA about 90% which was stented.
A following bedside echo following the MI revealed an ejection fraction of about 20%.
There are several options in the future such as doing a stress test to see whether the patient has symptomatic pain from the defects versus purely medical management versus cardiac catheterization in the future if the patient improves symptomatically.
We decided to obtain on the day of discharge, another cardiac echocardiogram now that his cardiac function has somewhat stabilized to assess his ejection fraction and to determine the for systemic coagulation if he has a low ejection fraction.
He had diarrhea during hospital course, but numerous samples were sent for Clostridium difficile and all of those were negative.
We obtained several imaging studies of his belly all of which revealed no evidence of obstruction or lesions to explain abdominal pain.
They performed a video swallow which revealed possible aspiration with some liquids, therefore their recommendation included thick and nectar consistency type diet while awaiting for improvement in his mental status and overall function before advancing to thin liquids.
The only evidence of infection was an equivocal urinalysis which revealed some white blood cells and bacteria.
The urine culture is negative.
An x-ray revealed no signs of fracture or dislocation.
Would of liked to obtain a MRI of his shoulder to further characterize this, but given patient's mental status, this is an unrealistic test at this point.
An EEG was obtained which showed changes consistent with toxic metabolic picture and no evidence of seizures.
His electrolytes remained well-controlled and there are no acute issues from a renal standpoint.
