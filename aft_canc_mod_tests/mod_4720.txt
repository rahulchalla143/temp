On arrival to ED, the patient's blood pressure was 130s/70s and he was tachycardic to 130.
BP trended down over 4 hours, at nadir, VS: BP: 89/61 HR 99 RR: 18 satting 95% 2L NC.
Labs demonstrated a WBC ct of 22, 93% neutrophils, no bands.
Abd CT showed large amount of ascitic fluid.
Paracentesis done revealed 10,325 WBC (94 poly, 1L, 5M), 450 RBC, 3 protein, 182 glucose, 228 LDH, with peritoneal fluid Gram stain 4+PMH, no microorganisms, fluid cx positive for few Enterococcus from broth ([**Last Name (un) 36**] to amp, levo, PCN w/ vanco pending), anaerobic bottle: GNR, beta lactamase pos.
Blood cx with NGTD.
During his stay in the MICU, he continued to improve, tolerating po, afebrile, WBC ct trending down.
Also of note, CXR and CTA chest showing small left pleural effusion, with RUL consolidation w/ cavitation.
HEENT: anicteric, EOMI, PERRL, OP clear w/ dry MM, no LAD CV: reg s1/s2, +1/6 systolic murmur loudest at LUSB, no s3/s4/r  Pulm: CTA B, no wheezes or crackles Abd: distended, tympanitic to percussion, 10cm vertical surgical incision in midline is well healed, several small scars lateral to central scar, +BS, soft, tender RUQ, no rebound tenderness, no [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign.
CXR ([**12-3**]): New small right pleural effusion and unchanged right upper lobe opacity, left basilar opacity and left pleural effusion .
CXR [**2120-12-9**]:  RUL cavitary lesion between 2.5 and 3.0 cm, unchanged in size, however, new four peribronchial consolidations suspicious for progressive infection.
[**2120-12-10**]:  Portable CXR showing no significant change.
[**2120-12-10**]:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2120-12-12**]: CXR AP chest compared to [**12-7**] and 29.
***CULTURES**** [**11-30**] Blood neg X4 [**11-30**] Peritoneal fluid pansens Enterococcus, anaerobic bottle: Bfragilis [**12-2**] Neg VRE Rectal swab [**12-2**] Neg MRSA [**12-6**] Blood neg X4 [**12-6**] Yeast >100K [**12-7**] Perionteal fluid no growth [**12-7**] Urine 10-100K yeast, fungal: yeast not C. albicans, AFB pending [**12-7**] Blood Cx neg X4 [**12-9**] Crypto neg in blood 11/30 Peritoneal fluid: no growth, no fungus, no mycobacteria .
**PATHOLOGY** [**12-11**] peritoneal fluid:  blood and inflammatory cells, cytology negative for malignant cells  Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 59-yo Russian speaking man w/ pancreatic CA s/p failed whipple and cisplatin therapy, HTN, DM2 admitted initially to MICU fpr pulmonary embolism and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, s/p IV heparin drip transitioned to lovenox subcutaneously, with SBP being treated with Zosyn.
WBC ct was trending down, pt remained afebrile X 3 days, tolerating po, and was transferred from MICU to medical floor.
WBC elevated on [**12-7**] to 19.7.
Concern for sepsis [**2-14**] to bacterial peritonitis from recent surgical procedure/instrumentation vs. questionable abscess on CT abd according to surgical opinion (again likely [**2-14**] to recent failed surgical attempt at removal off mass, CT showing free air/bubbles/septations/loculated ascites) vs. partial SBO/intermittent SBO causing translocation of enteric organisms across bowel wall.
Other potential sources included the cavitary lesion seen on CXR therefore there was a questions of a possible necrotizing PNA with his b/l pleural effusions (at the time felt to be less likely, most reasonable explanation is old TB infection but cannot r/out reactivation, especially given the new [**Name (NI) 65425**] pt was transfered to isolation room, 3 sputum cx sent, and were much later found to be positive for TB, infection control notified, as were the health care workers exposed).
The patient remained on Vanco/Zosyn for broad coverage including coverage of Enterococcus and Bacteroids growing from pleural fluid.
Portal vein compression- The patient had evidence on Abd CT of pancreatic mass nearly occluding portal vein.
A Liver Ultrasound completed with dopplers showed slow flow through portal vein, w/ significant ascites.
The liver team felt the pt would need palliative paracenteses periodically as he reaccumulates ascites.
He underwent his third and final therapeutic/diagnostic tap on [**12-11**] with cytology negative, fluid cx negative, neg for Mycobacteria or fungus as well.
His oliguria was most likely [**2-14**] intravascular volume depletion [**2-14**] prerenal etiology from poor po intake.
His FENa was <0.05%, consistent with prerenal etiology.
His ins and outs were strictly monitored during this admission.
His UOP returned to [**Location 213**], and the Renal consultants signed off.
Hypoxia: Throughout the patient's admission, he required 3L oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain sats above 95%.
His oxygen saturation was monitored closely.
On the morning of his death, the patient desatted to upper 70s, was given nebs, IV lasix, with CXR showing volume overload (and prior RUL cavitary lesion), ABG concerning, thus MICU consult was initiated.
Posthumously, the patient's TB sputum cultures came back positive for Mycobacteria tuberculosis.
Indeed, the pt's CXR demonstrated a concerning RUL cavitary lesion.
He was initially started on an IV heparin drip with goal PTT 60-80, then transitioned to lovenox prior to transfer to the medical floor from the MICU.
Also with mets on CT to adrenals and liver.
Hematology/Oncology at [**Hospital1 18**] was called, and stated that gemcitabine would be a possible option (as an outpatient), with 30% response rate, impossible to predict responders.
