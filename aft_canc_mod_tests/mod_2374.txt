An echocardiogram report showed a pericardial effusion with tamponade and pulsus paradoxus of 16.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 94.7 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate was 95 to 100, blood pressure was 91 to 110/35 to 58, respiratory was 18, oxygen saturation was 95% on 4 liters, and a pulse of 6 mmHg.
Her head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination was significant for pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Cardiovascular examination was significant for a regular rate and rhythm and without murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Lung examination was significant for rales one-third of the way up bilaterally.
Abdominal examination revealed positive bowel sounds, nontender, and nondistended.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory examination was significant for a white blood cell count of 13, hematocrit was 27.9, hemoglobin was 9.5, platelets were 187.
Differential showed 89 neutrophils with 3 bands and 4 lymphocytes.
Chemistry-7 showed sodium was 131, potassium was 5.6, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 12, blood urea nitrogen was 48, creatinine was 2.2, and blood glucose was 153, with an anion gap of 18.
Calcium was 7.9, phosphate was 7.2, magnesium was 1.7.
PTT was 37.6 and INR was 3.
Pericardial fluid showed 2+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes, white count of 550.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe pneumonia with atelectasis and consolidation.
Electrocardiogram showed low voltage with sinus rhythm at 106, diffuse minimal ST elevations, and question of electrical alternans.
Echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, with moderate-to-large pericardial effusion, and right ventricular diastolic collapse; consistent with impaired filling and tamponade.
The echocardiogram after pericardial drainage showed the effusion was resolved.
Cytology of the pericardial fluid showed malignant cells consistent with non-small cell carcinoma.
Digoxin 0.125 mg was given for this as the patient's high liver function tests prevented amiodarone, and the patient's hypotension prevented the use of calcium channel blocker and beta blockers.
The patient had episodes of oxygen desaturations to the middle 80s on room air and was maintained on 15 liters face mask at 96% and eventually was able to be weaned down to was 2 liters nasal cannula with oxygen saturations in the low 90s.
An ultrasound of the liver to evaluate for metastases was negative.
