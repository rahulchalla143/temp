LABORATORY:  The patient's white blood count was 9.4 with a hematocrit of 22.1 (over baseline of 36 to 38 in [**Month (only) 1096**]) and platelets of 357.
Sodium was 133, potassium 4.7, chloride 99, bicarbonate 20, BUN 50 and creatinine 1.2.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 88 with normal axis,normal intervals and T-wave inversion in AVR as well as Q's in V4 through V6, Tall R's in V2.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the MICU initially for workup of an upper gastrointestinal bleed.
He had no further episodes of hematemesis and his stool was brown throughout the hospitalization.
Given the low hematocrit and the patient's history of coronary artery disease he was ruled out for myocardial infarction with CKs of 41, 27 and 30 and Troponin's less than .3 each time.
On [**2200-3-14**] the patient underwent a esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed a single crater of 3 cm ulcer in the stomach body (lesser curvature) with thickened edematous edges and stigmata of recent bleeding although no blood was seen in the stomach or duodenum.
The patient's non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were stopped and these were not restarted.
He was hemodynamically stable, his hematocrit was stable in the 33 range.
For follow-up for the gastrointestinal issues the patient was scheduled for gastrointestinal follow-up with the Gastrointestinal service on [**2200-3-25**] and the patient was discharged to home in good condition on [**2200-3-17**] with the biopsy result and H. pylori results still pending.
