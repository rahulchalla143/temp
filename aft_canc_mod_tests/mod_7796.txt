At [**Hospital3 **] Hospital her labs were notable for a white count of 10.6, alk phos of 394, total bilirubin of 31.2, direct bilirubin of 28.7, Albumin of 2, AST of 102, ALT of 51, Cr of 2.95, bicarb of 14 and an INR of 7.0.
An ultrasound of her abdomen showed a heterogenous liver with nodular edge suspicious for cirrhosis, patent portal vein, thickened gall bladder wall, CBD dilated to 20mm and medium amount of ascites.
Labs here showed a t-bili of 36.6, d-bili of 29.1, AP of 379, Cr of 3.3, bicarb of 14, WBC of 12.6 (2 metas, 2 myelos) and an INR of 7.0.
A repeat RUQ U/S again showed a likely cirrhotic liver with CBD dilatation to 1.5cm and moderate ascites.

Microbiology: [**2150-9-9**]    URINE CULTURE (Final [**2150-9-11**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
blood culture ([**9-9**]):  pending .
Imaging: RUQ ultrasound ([**9-9**]): 1.
Query erosive changes at dorsum of radius - is osteomyelitis a clinical concern.
TTE ([**9-11**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
- Likely distal pancreatic duct stricture - Sphincterotomy was performed - Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush.
- Successful placement of a 7cm by 10 FR biliary stent - Successful placement of a 5cm by 5FR pancreatic stent - Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: - Follow for response and complications.
If any abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding please call ERCP fellow on call - Consider CT abd to further evaluate pancreas once renal function improves.
- Repeat ERCP in 2 months.
Renal ultrasound ([**9-12**]): pending IMPRESSION: Normal kidneys bilaterally, without obstruction  COMMON BILE DUCT BRUSHINGS Procedure Date of [**2150-9-10**] Distal common bile duct brushing: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with adenocarcinoma.
#) Hyperbilirubinemia: On presentation the patient had a high bilirubin level (36.6) and was obviously jaundiced.
Brushing was performed for cytologic study, which revealed cancer cells.
#) Acute Kidney Injury: On presentation the patient was found to have a Cr of 3.3.
Hydration did not improve her renal function, and she continued to have low urine output and her creatinine continued to rise.
