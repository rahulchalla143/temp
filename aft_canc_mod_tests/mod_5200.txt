MRI OF THE HEAD WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, MRA OF THE BRAIN.
COMPARISON: Prior CT of the head dated [**2133-2-27**].
MRI OF THE BRAIN.
Lamina papyracea fluid level is identified on the left maxillary sinus, associated with significant mucosal thickening, there is also mucosal thickening on the right maxillary sinus and in the medial aspect of the frontal sinus, significant amount of secretion is identified in the nasopharynx.
TECHNIQUE: Two-dimensional time-of-flight MRA was performed, coronal VIBE imaging was performed during infusion of intravenous contrast, rotational reformatted images were obtained.
IMPRESSION: There is possible moderate stenosis at the origin of both internal carotids in the cervical bifurcations, correlation with carotid Doppler ultrasound is recommended if clinically warranted.
CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2133-2-27**] 8:01 PM  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD W&W/O C  Reason: Primary tumor?
COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from [**2133-2-27**].
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after oral and intravenous contrast.
Non-contrast images of the abdomen and delayed images of the kidneys were also obtained.
CT OF THE CHEST: An endotracheal tube is seen terminating in the high trachea.
Within the paratracheal region in the AP window, subcarinal region, and in both hila, there are necrotic-appearing lymph nodes in conglomeration.
Elsewhere in the lungs, there are several other pulmonary nodules, including on images 3:10, 30, 31, 39, 52, and 32.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The liver, gallbladder, right adrenal gland, spleen, and pancreas appear unremarkable.
CT OF THE PELVIS: There is a Foley catheter within the bladder lumen.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the ICU from the ER intubated with a chest tube.
An MRI revealed a cerebellar mass and the patient was transferred to the NSU service.
Subsequently a CT of the torso was obtained which showed a lung mass.
This was biopsied by interventional pulmonology and the pathology was consistent with non-small cell lung cancer.
A cardiology consult was obtained due to his severe AS and they stated he would be very high risk for surgery with AVR.
It was placed to water seal on [**3-3**] but a repeat CXR showed the lung had fallen and the tube was placed back on suction.
The CT was removed on [**3-5**].
The family was called to the bedside and the decision was made to withhold further vasopressors and to initiate a morphine drip.
