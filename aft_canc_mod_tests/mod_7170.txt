Review of prior CT shows a rounded filling defect in the distal CBD, suggesting an obstructing mass.
[**2144-4-14**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  A Foley catheter is identified in the bladder.
On bone windows, there are extensive degenerative changes involving the lumbar spine.
The imaging appearance is consistent with C. diff colitis, although other etiologies such as inflammatory or ischemic processes cannot be excluded.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

Her hypotension did not improve with 3 one liter fluid boluses and she was transferred to ICU for care of sepsis.
Patient had CT scan after arrival to ICU showing pancolitis, ascites, and dialated gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid.
Her pressors were weaned off within the first 24 hours of arrival to ICU.
Patient continued to have improving abdominal exam and leukocytosis suggesting C.diff is improving.
She remained hemodynamically stable and her WBC count improved with antibiotics and the drain was kept in place to be addressed with [**Hospital1 18**] surgery at followup appointment later in [**Month (only) **].
