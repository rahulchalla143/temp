CT on [**10-18**] showed progression in size of liver mets and development of new right sided pulmonary nodules.
PET [**10-21**] showed widespread metastatic bone lesions which were stable in intensity and number.

Imaging: CXR ([**2138-1-24**]): Lungs are clear without infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax.
Abdominal CT ([**2138-1-25**]): Marked peripancreatic inflammatory change, with free fluid in the retroperitoneum, and extending into the pelvis.
[**2137-1-29**] Rib Film ([**2138-1-29**]): No definite lytic or sclerotic rib or shoulder metastases identified.
Bone scan is recommended for further evaluation due to its greater sensitivity for detection for metastases.
[**2138-2-2**] Blood culture(Final [**2138-2-5**]): AEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2138-2-5**]):       STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
Her amylase (825), lipase (2113) and WBC (32.2) were all elevated.
Abdominal CT showed marked peripancreatic inflammatory change, with free fluid in the retroperitoneum, and extending into the pelvis.
Patient's WBC, amylase and lipase continued to trend downwards, but she continued to have intermittant fevers (see discussion below).
At the time of discharge, the patient was afebrile and WBC, amylase and lipase were wnl and she was on only PO pain meds.
Rib films and bone scan swere negative for fractures or rib mestases that could be contributing to her pain, CTA was negative for PE, and, although CT scan showed small bilateral pleural effusion, their low volume prevented thoracentesis.
3)Bacteremia: Blood cultures from [**2138-1-30**] (resulted [**2138-2-1**]) grew two morphologies of coag (-) staph (1/4 bottles).
These were believed to be a contaminant, but given the patient remained febrile, she was begun on vancomycin ([**2138-2-1**]) pending subsequent blood cultures.
BCx from [**2138-2-2**] (resulted [**2138-2-3**]) also grew coag (-) staph.
Those blood cultures resulted on [**2138-2-5**] and grew gram + rods (coryneobacterium; likely a contaminant).
TTE was performed and was (-) for mass/vegetation (limited study).
Given concern for the possibility of portacath infection, blood cultures were drawn from the portocath, which were negative at time of discharge.
She will have repeat blood cultures drawn after completing this her antibiotic course.
She underwent a thorough infectious disease work-up which, aside from the bacteremia noted above, was negative.
5) Anemia: The patient's hematocrit dropped from 37.4 to 24.8, which was attributed primarily to hemodilution.
She received 4 units of blood, and her hematocrit has since remained stable in the low 30's.
Prior iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
On this admission, folate and vitamin B12 were found to be nl/high.
On HD 8, a PICC line was placed and the patient was begun on TPN on HD 9 to augment her nutritional status, which was discontinued on [**2-3**] after removal of her PICC line.
Outpatient Lab Work Blood cultures after completion of 10 day course of vancomycin ([**2138-2-13**]) 10.
Followup Instructions: 1) Primary Care Please follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1395**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2936**]) Wednesday [**2138-2-12**] 1:45 p.m. - you will need to have blood cultures drawn after you complete your 10 day vancomycin course ([**2138-2-13**]) to ensure that the bacteremia has cleared 2) Oncology Please make an appointment with your oncologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] within the week - chemotherapy should not be initiated until you have completed your antibiotic course and repeat blood cultures are negative    Completed by:[**2138-2-28**
