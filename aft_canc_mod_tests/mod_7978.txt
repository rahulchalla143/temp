Though she remains hemodynamically stable, her HCT decreased from 26 to 21, concerning for GI bleed.
Cauterization was considered, but no endoscopy was performed as she was hemodynamically stable without evidence of active bleed.
Depending on the findings, GI will dictate further workup and/or intervention.
You blood counts improved appropriately and given you are not having active bleeding, we feel you are now safe to return home.
