Portable AP view of the chest from [**2187-9-19**] is compared to the prior from yesterday.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2187-9-12**] 1:12 PM  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  Reason: IV CONTRAST; eval extent of lung mass Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 72 year old woman with recently dx lung ca [**8-1**] with increased SOB and outside report of lung mass compression of airway REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: IV CONTRAST; eval extent of lung mass CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
Multidetector CT images were obtained through the chest with contrast at 1.25 and 5 mm reconstructions in the lung algorithm.
COMPARISON: Portable chest [**2187-9-11**] and [**2187-9-12**].
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is a large mass within the left lung abutting the left heart border and invading the mediastinal airway and vascular structures.
Associated large bilateral hilar and mediastinal conglomerate lymph nodes, which encase the airway and the central pulmonary arteries.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound is recommended to confirm and further characterize this finding.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 72 year-old female recently diagnosed with NSCLC [**8-1**] undergoing cehmotherapy (last [**2187-9-4**]) transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital to Dr.[**Name (NI) 14680**] Interventional Pulmonology service at the [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2187-9-11**] for evaluation of central airway obstruction and possible stent placement.
On HD 1, she had an elevated WBC of 46.5 and her chest x-ray demonstrated complete whiteout of the left chest.
On HD 5, she underwent a flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration of retained secretions.
Her WBC count had progressively decreased to 11.4.
Patient will undergo a speech and swallow evaluation and pending her passing the evaluation, she will resume a normal diet.
