In the past, workups have been negative including head CT and lumbar puncture.
In the Emergency Department, the patient noted to have a blood pressure of 204/100 which subsequently went as high as 240/120 with heart rate in the 140s in atrial fibrillation.
The patient responded to intravenous Nipride and was changed to Nitroglycerin drip so that the patient could be admitted to the floor, however, blood pressure rebounded to 220 systolic despite 100 mcg of Nitroglycerin, Hydralazine intravenously, as well as Lopressor.
The patient was seen by neurology in the Emergency Department and head CT performed at that time was negative.
Polycystic kidney disease, status post cadaveric renal transplant in [**2140**], and [**2146**], baseline creatinine 1.5.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Heart rate 80 to 108, blood pressure 160/90, respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation 98% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination is normocephalic and atraumatic.
Funduscopic examination revealed sharp disks.
Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count 11.1, hematocrit 57.2, platelets 201,000.
Sodium 138, potassium 4.1, chloride 100, bicarbonate 25, blood urea nitrogen 23, creatinine 1.5, glucose 124.
Prothrombin time 25.8, partial thromboplastin time 41.7, INR 4.6.
Urinalysis shows trace blood, 100 mg/deciliter protein, no red blood cells, no white blood cells.
ALT 34, AST 34, alkaline phosphatase 124, amylase 70, total bilirubin 0.8.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation in the 90s, leftward axis, poor R wave progression in the precordium.
Q waves in aVF and III noted to be old compared to previous electrocardiogram in [**2147-1-30**].
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrate, poor inspiratory effort.
Head CT from the Emergency Department showed no cerebrovascular accident and old lacunar stroke.
The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with cardiac enzymes negative times three.
Because suspicion for underlying coronary artery disease was low, no further workup was performed at this time.
Pump - The patient with a previous echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction of 55% in [**2147-9-30**].
The patient's Coumadin was initially held while INR was elevated.
Once INR dropped down to low 2.0 range, the patient's Coumadin was restarted.
Renal ultrasound was performed on [**2148-4-19**], and showed no son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for renal artery stenosis.
In addition, 24 hour urine collection for catecholamines as well as catechol metabolites was performed with sample three submitted to the patient's outpatient primary care physician for analysis.
The patient was subsequently taken off the Nipride drip as the blood pressure was able to be controlled with p.o.
The patient's symptoms resolved completely by hospital day number two with the concomitant control of his blood pressure.
On admission, the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 57.0 which subsequently dropped to 52.0 on hospital day number two.
It was the feeling of the primary team that the patient's elevated hematocrit may be contributing to his symptoms and decision was to phlebotomize one unit of blood from the patient.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable in the high 40s for the remainder of his hospital course.
The patient's creatinine remained stable at his baseline throughout the hospital course.
The patient's Prograf level was checked and was noted to be low and decision was made to increase the patient's Prograf to 5 mg p.o.
The patient is to have Prograf level checked on [**2148-4-25**], as well as prothrombin time and INR as per regular monitoring.
Evaluation of intracranial vessel to be performed as an outpatient for any signs of aneurysm.
