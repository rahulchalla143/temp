He was scheduled to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in clinic [**2130-1-10**] but due to his continued worsening dyspnea he presented to his PCP at [**Hospital1 2292**] and was noted on CXR to have a left lower lobe infiltrate with and elevated WBC count to 19 with left shift, as well as an INR of 8.
At the time of presentation the patient denied chest pain, pleuritic pain, headaches, dizziness, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel or bladder habits, prolonged bleeding, easy bruising, or changes in weight did endorse continued decreased appetite.
Past Medical History: Oncology History: PET CT [**2129-8-10**]: FDG-avid LULlarge 49x40mm lung lesion is seen highly concerning for lung cancer.
There is a prominent lymph node in the left peritracheal area measuring 18x12mm (not FDG-avid) and non-specific  Bronchoscopy [**2129-8-22**]: obtained tissue for pathology which revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma (stage IIIa)  [**2129-9-9**]: left VATS and lymph node biopsy to complete staging work up.
No pleural metastases were noted but there were bulky level 6 lymph nodes, which were positive for metastatic carcinoma on frozen sections; final pathology showed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with extensive necrosis histologically similar to the prior lung sample.
No other history of cancer or blood clotting disorders  Physical Exam: GENERAL: No acute distress; alert and fully oriented; pleasant and cooperative HEENT: Mucous membranes moist and pink; nasal canula in place; no ocular or nasal discharge; no scleral icterus; no skin lesions CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm; normal S1 and S2; no appreciable murmumurs CHEST: Left thoracotomy incision healing well; no erythema or induration PULMONARY: Crackles at lung bases bilaterally; slightly diminished breath sounds on left side ABDOMEN: Soft, non-tender, non-distended; no palpable masses; no rebound or gaurding; healing vertical incision in sub-xiphoid region EXTREMITIES: Moderate bilateral lower extremity edema bilaterally   Pertinent Results: [**2130-1-9**] 09:48PM   PT-150* PTT-72.9* INR(PT)-15.7* [**2130-1-9**] 09:37PM   LACTATE-2.3* [**2130-1-9**] 08:13PM   TYPE-ART PO2-75* PCO2-27* PH-7.49* TOTAL CO2-21 BASE XS-0 [**2130-1-9**] 07:20PM   PT-150* PTT-74.3* INR(PT)-15.7 [**2130-1-9**] 06:52PM   LACTATE-3.5* [**2130-1-9**] 06:45PM   GLUCOSE-123* UREA N-33* CREAT-1.3* SODIUM-134 POTASSIUM-5.4* CHLORIDE-99 TOTAL CO2-21* ANION GAP-19 [**2130-1-9**] 06:45PM   estGFR-Using this [**2130-1-9**] 06:45PM   WBC-16.5* RBC-3.31* HGB-9.0* HCT-29.3* MCV-89 MCH-27.2 MCHC-30.7* RDW-16.2* [**2130-1-9**] 06:45PM   NEUTS-88.4* LYMPHS-6.7* MONOS-3.4 EOS-1.4 BASOS-0.2 [**2130-1-9**] 06:45PM   PLT COUNT-589  RADIOLOGY: CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST [**2130-1-10**]: Findings: A large pericardial effusion, with attenuation characteristics of bloody or exudative fluid has developed, impinging on the right atrium and right ventricle, suggesting cardiac tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient underwent a CT of the chest in the ED which demonstrated a large pericardial effusion impairing right ventricular function.
The pericardial fluid was sent for cytology and a drain was left in place.
The patient had improvement in his dyspnea symptoms, however a TTE performed the following morning was significant for a continued moderate pericardial effusion that was reported to be echo-dense and consistent with blood - despite the minimal output from his pericardial drain.
Cytology results of the pericardial fluid returned negative for malignant cells.
The patient was transferred to the ICU post-op for close cardiac monitoring, and a bedside ECHO did not demonstrate any significant re-accumulation of fluid on post-operative day 1.
The patient's post-operative course continued to be complicated by episodes of atrial fibrillation/ectopy with heart rates in the 120's while ambulating.
Additionally, Cardiology recommended ASA 325mg (daily) alone for anticoagulation due to his risk of bleeding and the low likelihood that his (presumed temporary) post-operative atrial fibrillation would pose a risk for thrombus formation.
Of note, the patient was temporarily placed on a Lasix regimen of 20mg daily for significant bilateral lower extremity edema, but had two episodes of mild hypotension on post-operative days 8 and 10 - both of which responded well to fluid boluses- after which time the Lasix was discontinued.
