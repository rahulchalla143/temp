Admission Date:  [**2195-1-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2195-2-2**]   Service:  CARDIAC CRITICAL CARE UNIT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84 year-old white female with multiple medical problems including hypertension, severe peripheral vascular disease, awaiting revascularization recently admitted to NABH for preoperative catheterization, which was complicated by severe groin bleeding.
She recently underwent peripheral vascular workup including noninvasive studies, which revealed right and left superficial femoral artery occlusion with collateralization on the left.
She underwent Dobutamine echocardiogram at NABH on [**1-21**], which had anterior and septal ischemia, which prompted an elective catheterization.
The patient's cardiac output was 4.7 on right heart catheterization.
She had altered mental status so she underwent a head CT, which was negative.
The patient was begun on a Diltiazem drip and nitroglycerin drip and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers b.i.d., Procardia XL 30 mg q.d., Clonidine .4 mg q week, Lasix 20 q.d., Prevacid 30 q.d., aspirin 81 q.d., Diovan 320 mg q day, Hydrea 500 mg q three days, Levoxyl .05 q.d., Digoxin .125 mg q.d., magnesium oxide 400 mg b.i.d., Diltiazem drip, nitroglycerin drip titrated to blood pressure.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 101.5, blood pressure 150/40.
Heart rate 90s.
Respiratory rate 18.
Oxygen saturation 99% on 4.5 liters.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 47.8, hematocrit 30, platelets 275, sodium 135, potassium 3.7, chloride 99, bicarb 25, BUN 10, creatinine 1.4, glucose 162, magnesium 1.2.
Chest x-ray borderline cardiomegaly, left hemidiaphragm obscurations, small pleural effusion on left side.
Electrocardiogram was pending.
IMPRESSION/PLAN:  The patient is an 84 year-old female, labile hypertension, severe peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure with a recent catheterization with left anterior descending coronary artery and left circumflex stenosis with catheterization complicated by groin hematoma requiring operative repair, transferred with hypertension and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for intervention of her coronary arteries.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient's left anterior descending coronary artery and left circumflex stenosis on catheterization [**1-22**], the patient will get cardiac intervention via Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] prior to lower extremity revascularization.
Will continue Diltiazem drip for now for blood pressure and heart rate control and will continue [**Last Name (un) **].
EF is not known, although cardiac output looks well on catheterization at 4.7, continue Lasix and [**Last Name (un) **], follow volume status, diurese as needed.
Will check electrocardiogram and monitor on telemetry.
Will check chest x-ray, urinalysis and cultures.
Hematology:  As per heme/onc at NABH, the patient received Epogen for hematocrit of less then 35, white blood cell count seems baseline for the patient.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had cardiac catheterization with intervention on [**2195-1-29**].
The patient's blood pressure medications have been titrated to maximum for better blood pressure and heart rate control.
The patient did have an EF measured at 45%.
Status post cardiac catheterization the patient did have a hematoma at the site of catheterization.
The patient's hematocrit is relatively stable.
The patient at rehab will need continued blood pressure monitoring for titration of blood pressure medications.
