FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
Imaging: CT head [**2149-10-11**]: 1.
Evaluation for possible intracranial infection is limited on this study and if there is clinical concern for an infection, MRI with contrast should be performed.
MRI/MRV head [**2149-10-12**]: 1.
MRI spine [**2149-10-12**]: 1.
Extensive abnormal but amorphous STIR-hyperintensity in the deep dorsal and the interspinous and supraspinous soft tissues from L2 to L4-L5 level, likely related to multiple recent attempts at lumbar puncture; correlate clinically.
CXR [**2149-10-15**]: Right PICC has been withdrawn.
EEG [**2149-10-14**]:  This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to generalized slowing with a maximum 4 Hz posterior predominant rhythm as well as bursts of generalized delta slowing, left more than right.
Head CT showed interval improvement in IPH and lack of abscess.
LP was repeated on [**2149-10-14**] and showed significant decrease in WBC count indicating positive antibiotic effect.
His first CSF culture grew out pan sensitive Serratia whereas repeat CSF culture (performed after he was started on antibiotics) had no growth.
Blood cx negative x 3.
MRI showed evidence of progressive leptomeningeal disease and stable surgical cavity.
EEG showed evidence of moderate to severe encephalopathy with no evidence of seizure activity.
He had a seizure while on the medical floor likely due to underlying Serratia meningoencephalitis that was responsive to Ativan.
Continuous EEG monitoring in the ICU showed no seizure activity.
He had no further episodes of seizure activity during his hospital course.
Most likely this was secondary to sedation boluses of versed and fentanyl that he received during the imaging study, but sepsis secondary to meningoencephalitis was considered.
BP stable for rest of hospital course  # Neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma: Patient is s/p tumor recention, c/b meningitis and recent rebleed.
# Anemia: His hematocrit has steadily declined, but remained stable in the low to mid 30s.
Iron studies revealed anemia of chronic inflammation.
His stool was guaiac + on the medical wards.
