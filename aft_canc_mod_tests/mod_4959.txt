MRI of his head at that time revealed progression of his disease and he was discharged on [**Hospital1 **] Decadron as well as a percutaneous epidural catheter, gabapentin, and multiple narcotics for pain control.
In the ED initial vital signs were 98.6  110/86   85   18   96% RA.
Initial labs showed mildly elevated lipase 62 and AST 46, hyponatremia to 126, and hyperkalemia 5.4 with lactate 2.4.
Redraw of the labs 4 hrs later showed resolution in abnormalities of LFTs, K, and sodium to 129.
There was no elevated WBC count and the Hct was stable at 39.8.
CT head was limited due to motion and showed progression of extensive numerous hyperdense lesions bilaterally consistent with known metastatic melanoma.
CXR showed small right pleural effusion and persistent right middle lobe lung mass.
He was guiaic negative from below and would not tolerate NG lavage.
A KUB was obtained but was a poor study therefore a CT torso was obtained.
Repeat Hct was stable at 39.6.
A CT of the abdomen on [**2148-10-31**] showed right lower lobe pleura-based nodule, that on further CT of the chest showed otehr pleura-based lesions.
-- He underwent a fine-needle biopsy on the largest lesion on [**2149-1-2**] showing metastatic melanoma.
-- He saw the Biologics Group on [**2149-1-7**] and his BRAF V600E mutation was positive.
-- gadolinium-enhanced head MRI that showed a small enhancing lesion in the right insula.

CT HEAD [**2149-7-29**] Limited study secondary to patient motion artifact redemonstrating progression of extensive numerous hyperdense lesions bilaterally consistent with known metastatic melanoma.
The SAH seen on CT may be contributing, however neurosurgery does not think so.
However, inital labs do not support infection or hepatic cause.
At 4pm vitals were taken and he was found to be hypotensive and tachycardic, he also sounded congested (and likely aspirated).
