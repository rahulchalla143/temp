The patient also had an eight beat run of ventricular tachycardia and was taken for cardiac catheterization the morning of admission to the CCU.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, vital signs revealed temperature 97.9, heart rate 101 with premature ventricular contractions, blood pressure 100/58, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 100% in room air.
Weight was 80.9 kilograms.
General appearance - The patient is a well appearing disheveled male in no apparent distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
The neck revealed no jugular venous distention, no carotid bruits.
Cardiovascular examination - regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 6.6, hemoglobin 14.0, hematocrit 39.6, platelet count 186,000.
Coagulation studies revealed prothrombin time 12.9, partial thromboplastin time 58.1, INR 1.2.
Chem7 revealed sodium 142, potassium 3.8, chloride 105, bicarbonate 25, blood urea nitrogen 15, creatinine 0.7, glucose 126.
The patient had two sets of cardiac enzymes at the time that he was seen.
The first set showed a CK of 169, MB 16 and troponin of 3.3.
The second set had a CK of 991 and MB of 156.
Lipid panel was pending.
Arterial blood gases on admission showed pO2 of 166, pCO2 28, pH 7.5, total CO2 23 and base excess of 0.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with ST elevations in V1 through V4.
Chest x-ray revealed no infiltrate, effusion or pneumothorax.
The patient's catheterization results showed moderately increased filling pressures, depressed cardiac index.
Left ventriculography was not performed secondary to his acute myocardial infarction.
An echocardiogram was performed to assess his left ventricular function which showed an ejection fraction of approximately 30 to 35% with septal, apical and anterior akinesis.
For his rhythm, the patient had one episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia the day after his myocardial infarction, however, after that, the telemetry strips were unremarkable.
