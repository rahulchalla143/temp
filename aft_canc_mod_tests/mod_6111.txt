Of note, she has a history of pericardial effusion found on Echo performed in [**Month (only) **] of this year as a prelude to a cardiac stress test.
At [**Last Name (un) 26580**], she had a repeat ECHO which showed a large pericardial effusion measuring 4cm posteriorly and 3cm anteriorly.
Her vital signs remained stable (124/70's and a HR 60-90's afib) and she was transferred for pericardiocentesis and further work-up of the effusion.
Given her elevated INR (4.1) she received 10mg of SQ Vit K as well as a repeat Echo prior to transfer.
The transfer note also reports that patient was ordered for a unit of blood prior to transfer for a HCT drop from 29 --> 26, but that she did not receive it prior to transfer.
She had a colonoscopy this year and had a polyp excised, but it was otherwise normal.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 12 cm.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-12-16**], the pericardial effusion is much smaller and tamponade physiology is no longer suggested.
TTE [**12-16**]: The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Cath [**12-17**]: 1.
Right heart catheterization prior to pericardiocentesis shows elevated and equalized diastolic pressure which were equal to the pericardial pressure (for details see above).
Subsequent to removal of 1100cc of pericardial fluid, pericardial pressure decreased to 1mmHg.
Left ventricular filling pressure remains elevated and unchanged with (22mmHg) greater than RVEDP (14mmHg) suggesting underlying diastolic dysfunction.
Pulmonary hypertension with PA systolic pressure of 49mmHg prior to pericardiocentesis and 56mmHg after pericardiocentesis.
SBP back up to 110s following fluid bolus of 500cc.
However, due to INR of 4.1 at OSH, pericardiocentesis held until [**2128-12-17**].
At the OSH she had an INR of 4.1 was given 10 mg sq vitamin k.  Here she was given 10 mg po vit K x 2.
Her INR was 1.8 when she was sent to the cath lab for pericardiocentesis with 1 unit of FFP to be given in the holding area.
Urinalysis c/w UTI, and thus being treated for 3 days with ciprofloxacin.
Urine culture + for pansensitive E. coli.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
The laboratory studies from the fluid is still pending.
