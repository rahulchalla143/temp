**************RADIOLOGY**************** CXR [**2147-2-3**] 10:23 PM IMPRESSION: No evidence for pneumonia.There is no significant change compared to previous.
MRI HEAD [**2147-2-3**] official read P, per neuro-onc there is no acute process or bleed  CTA chest [**2147-2-6**] 1.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2147-2-8**] 8:58 AM 1.
New susceptibility artifact, perhaps from the right side of the mouth since the prior study of five days ago.
Correlation with chest imaging is recommended.
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2147-2-10**] 12:44 PM Scattered tiny foci of soft tissue density in the frontal and ethmoid air cells.
CT ORBITS, SELLA & IAC W/ CONTRAST  [**2147-2-14**] 11:24 AM No abnormality in the region of the temporal bone facial canal is seen.
Given h/o headache, an MR head was performed that was negative by report.
U/A was clean, CXR unrevealing, peritoneal dialysis fluid was negative, and BCx negative.
An LP was performed out of concern for meningitis.
LP studies showed NL glucose and protein, 1 WBC in CSF, negative cryptococcal Ag, cultures negative, HSV negative.
On day of transfer to ICU, pt developed new hypoxia and fever, CXR was concerning for question of new retrocardiac infiltrate, vs effusion (volume overload with wt gain of >5 lbs since admission), so CTX was begun empirically (D1 = [**2-6**]).
A CTA chest was significant for LUL PNA along with LLL collapse and was negative for PE.
CXR was as above.
CTX was started.
As above, vancomycin and zosyn were started for treatment of HAP and CTA was negative for PE.
Neuro exam without deficits, head MRI was negative for acute stroke or tumor.
Given concern for intracranial infectious vs malignant process, patient had two LP with cultures as described above, all negative.
Ultimately evaluated with CT sinus/orbits to evaluate CN tracts and evaulate for other etiology.
Continued immunosuppression sirolimus and tacrolimus (levels checked [**2-5**] were not true troughs [**2-18**] timing of draw).
Repeat LP [**2-9**] with elevated inflammatory markers, lymphocytosis.
CT sinus and CTA neck: no dissection or tracking sinusitis.
Head MRI with contrast [**2-13**] without anatomical explaination.
s/s evaluation was ordered and revealed profound dysphagia with multiple diet modification.
Use strict aspiration precautions: - Thin liquids - Soft solids, add extra sauce or condiments to help keep foods moist and ease transition - Pills whole with water as tolerated  2.
PO intake only with use of the following aspiration precautions: - Left head turn with slight chin tuck - SMALL sips of liquid with bites of food - Alternate between bites of food and sips of liquid to help clear pharyngeal residue - No straws  Followup Instructions: Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 593**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**] Date/Time:[**2147-2-20**] 9:30  Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 26384**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**] Date/Time:[**2147-2-20**] 9:30  Provider: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 971**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 970**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] Date/Time:[**2147-2-24**] 9:30  Provider: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
