He also endorses worsening lower extremity edema but is not clear if his weight has changed.
Per notes, he usually tolerates a blood pressure in the 80s during dialysis.
He is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] for cardiomyopathy and was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) **] for evaluation of supraventricular tachycardia.
He presented to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**2106-11-26**] complaining of generalized weakness and fatigue where initial vitals were 98.2 82/53, HR 129, and 98%RA.
EKG revealed regular narrow complex tachycardia.
On arrival to CCU, blood pressure was 71/40, HR 140s regular narrow complex tachycardia, respiratory rate of 20 with O2 sat mid 90s on room air.
EKG showed narrow complex tachycardia with rate of 148 with long R-P interval.
Bedside TTE showed hyperdynamic LV and dilated RV with adequate wall motion and moderate/severe TR.
He was then given 2 mg versed and underwent DCCV 200J after which he transiently went into an atrial ectopic rhythm with rate in 80s and then atrial fibrillation with rates in 80s-90s.
His blood pressure improved to 88/50 and then later to 90s/50s.
Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy attributed to Velcade and Rituxin (with improved LVEF following discontinuation) 2.

MICROBIOLOGIC DATA: [**2106-11-27**] Blood culture - pending [**2106-11-27**] MRSA screen - negative [**2106-11-28**] Blood culture - pending .
IMAGING STUDIES: [**2106-11-27**] 2D-ECHO - There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-5-9**], there are now signs of worsening RV pressure and volume overload.
[**2106-11-27**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Bilateral effusions slighly increased since [**11-9**].
?s macroglobulinemia, and metastatic prostate cancer who [**Hospital 76343**] transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital with hemodynamically unstable supraventricular tachycardia with improvement in blood pressure following electrical cardioversion.
# SUPRAVENTRICULAR, NARROW-COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA - The patient presented with a regular, narrow complex tachycardia with predominantly no P (or P in QRS).
In the past he was not interested in formal EP studies and potential ablation but this was re-addressed this admission.
Following electrical cardioversion, his rhythm converted to atrial fibrillation with a HR in the 80-90 bpm range; he reverted back to an atypical tachyarrhythmia with a rate of 130-140 bpm within 1-2 hours following cardioversion.
He was prepared for an electrophysiology study on [**2106-11-29**] given his persistent rhythm issues.
His TSH on admission was 6.4.
We also initially held his anticoagulation (indication being atrial fibrillation) on admission, given that his INR was 5.4 - and he received 3 mg Vitamin K PO x 1 given his supratherapeutic INR and the need for an EP study.
# HYPOTENSION - The patient presented with hypotension in the setting of a supra-ventricular tachyarrhythmia, improved following electrical cardioversion initially, but then he spontaneously reverted to an atypical tachyarrhythmia with a blood pressure in the 70/50 mmHg range.
Culture data was obtained on admission, which was unrevealing, and we held off on empiric antibiotics.
His admission CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions with no evidence of consolidation.
# DECOMPENSATED HEART FAILURE WITH PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION - The patient has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with a previous ejection fraction of 50-55% on most recent echocardiogram (prior LVEF was 20% while on chemotherapy agents).
He has stage III/IV NYHA heart failure and appeared to be volume overloaded on exam when admitted (lower extremity edema, JVD in setting of moderate-severe TR).
His labs (elevated BNP) and imaging studies (pleural effusions, mild pulmonary edema) supported these findings.
HIT antibody was negative, and the patient has been receiving heparin at dialysis routinely, making HIT unlikely.
# ESRD ON HEMODIALYSIS - Thought to be secondary to light chain cast nephropathy from Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, on hemodialysis since [**2102**].
# ANEMIA/LEUKOPENIA - His anemia and leukopenia are stable compared to prior recent labs and are thought to be due to bone marrow involvement of his prostate cancer; less likely due to Waldenstrom's.
His counts were serially trended on this admission.
Will need INR monitored - was therapeutic at discharge and he will be continued on home dose of 1 mg daily 2.
Should have platelets monitored after discharge to ensure that he is not thrombocytopenic; given that he is going home on Amiodarone.
You were admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit because your heart was beating very fast and your blood pressure was low.
Your platelet count dropped and have now increased again.
Change metoprolol to tartrate and increase the dose to 50 mg three times a day to lower your heart rate 2.
START Amiodarone to slow your heart rate and keep you in a normal rhythm.
