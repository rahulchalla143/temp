In ED, T98.2, HR 120's, BP 123/83, RR 20, 96-100% on non-rebreather.
EKG demonstrated diffuse PR depressions and 1mmHg ST elevations.
CT chest demonstrated large pericardial effusion and possible RV diastolic collapse.
In Cath lab, RA pressure was mean 22mmhg (pre-drain), RV 37/19 mean 17, wedge 18mmHg, PA sat 39%, PA Pressure 46/25 mean 33, pericardial opening pressure of 20mmHg.
After 685cc sanguinous fluid was removed RA pressure was 4, pericardial pressure was 4.

Physical Exam: VS: T 99.3, BP 127/82, HR 114 Sinus , RR 28, O2 100 % on 4L NC, pulsus 7mmHg Gen: Middle-aged woman, uncomfortable appearing, diaphoretic HEENT: NCAT.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP    Pertinent Results: CTA chest [**2114-12-16**]: 1.
There appears to be compression on the right ventricle and right atrium and echocardiogram is recommended to assess for tamponade.
Slight enlargement of bilateral metastatic lesions since chest CT [**2114-12-3**].
Chest PA/Lat: 1.
ECHO [**12-16**]: Overall normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>50%).
Compared to the prior study of earlier in the day (images reviewed; [**2114-12-16**]), the pericardial effusion has nearly resolved and tamponade physiology is no longer observed.
ECHO [**12-16**]: Overall left ventricular cavity size and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
CXR [**12-18**]: 1.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-12-17**], the findings are similar.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-12-18**], the findings are similar.
[**12-21**] ECHO .
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2114-12-19**].
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-12-19**], no change.

The patient was sent emergently to the cath lab where tamponade physiology was confirmed with a R heart cath and a pericardiocentesis was performed with aspiration of 685 ccs of sanguinous fluid.
After pericardiocentesis, the RA pressure and pericardial pressures were 4.
She was then transferred to the CCU where a repeat TTE was significant for an absence of remaining pericardial fluid.
Pericardial fluid studies were significant for malignant cells consistent with non-small cell lung carcinoma.
A PPD was negative.
Serial EKGs, pulsus pardoxus, and TTEs were all negative for a rapidly reaccumulating pericardial effusion.
PPD was negative for w/u of her hemorrhagic pericardial fluid.
Hct decrease from 37 to 31 over 1 week, likely [**3-2**] hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.
Iron studies c/w ACD.
