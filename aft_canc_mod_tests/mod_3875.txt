At [**Hospital1 **], had elevate CK, MB, TnI and a CXR indicating possible pneumonia and mild CHF and was started on B-blocker, nitro drip, ASA, lasix, ceftazidime/azithromycin.
His OSH echo showed 35-40% EF, septal/apical/inf wall hypokinesis, mild MR, trace TR.
A CT of his torso showed mediastinal LAD, hilar LAD, B/L pleural effusions, multiple pleural calcifications c/w prior asbestos exposure, B/L LL infiltrates, RUL infiltrate, and a R inguinal fluid collection.
At [**Hospital1 18**], pt had a cath with cypher and hepacoat stenting of RCA, PTCA to LAD and LCx with hepacoat in LAD and distal LM, hepacoat to ostium of LM.

FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2187-8-16**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
Blood cultures -- No growth to date   Brief Hospital Course: 1.
A cath was performed on [**8-9**]: LM 60-80% ostial, 80% distal; LAD 99% ostial, o/w diffuse; LCx 50% ostial, 80% mid; RCA 80% ostial, prox, & mid; Cypher & hepacoat x3 to mid RCA w/20% residual; hepacoat x2 to LM/LAD w/no residual.
His sbp responded quickly to 250cc of normal saline, coming up to 110-120, where it remained for the rest of his stay.
Pt had echo at OSH which showed EF of 35-40%.
However, given hypotension and Cr of 1.2, his ACE-I was held, and he was kept 0.5-1.0 liters positive for two days with no compromise of respiratory status, as it was felt he was hypovolemic.
)Azotemia -- His Cr bumped to 1.2 with a BUN of 29 and a FeNa of 0.2%.
His Cr trended down with fluids to 1.0.
Diagnostic possibilities included pneumonia, infected pleural effusion, R. groin abscess secondary to a metastatic nodal site, and diarrhea/C difficile.
His blood and pleural fluid cultures were negative, his pleural fluid analysis had a pH of 7.46 making empyema unlikely, and his R. groin swelling had no pain, erythema, or pus.
An ultrasound of the right groin showed a fluid collection that could represent a hematoma or an abscess; surgery evaluated the right groin lesion and felt that it was unlikely to be infected.
His C. diff assay came back positive.
)Squamous cell carcinoma -- Initially diagnosed [**2187-6-21**] by excisional bx at [**Hospital **] hospital, CT torso at [**Hospital1 **] showed necrotic mass in right groin.
A CT w/ constrast showed bilateral pleural effusions with consolidation in the right lower lobe, representing a pneumonia, an ill-defined nodular lesion in the medial portion of the left upper lobe measuring 2 cm in diameter, associated with extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, multiple ill-defined patchy opacities with possible cavitations in left upper lobe, with underlying bilateral pulmonary edema(these ill-defined opacities can be a part of pneumonia, or pulmonary edema, or can be septic emboli, or metastases), multiple calcified pleural plaques suggesting asbesto exposure, and GB stones.
Systolic CHF, EF ~ 40%.
The RCA had serial ostial, proximal and mid lesions up to 80%.
