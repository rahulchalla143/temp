Patchular vascular invasion with preoperative Beta HCG 9 that remained elevated postoperatively.
Computerized tomography scan showed metastatic evidence to chest, neck and abdomen with both the retroperitoneal and subclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Chest computerized tomography scan showed no pulmonary embolism but did show bronchiectasis and interstitial fibrosis.
Pulmonary function tests showed decrease in his DLCO per the chart.
The patient had a 74% room air saturation and increased subcutaneous emphysema.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] on [**2-3**] where he had a respiratory rate of 27, saturations 83% on 3 liters to 91%, on 6 liters with an arterial blood gases of 754, 32 and 68, and was admitted to the Medicine Service.
Cultures including viral cultures were sent that were negative to date.
Chest computerized tomography scan showed pulmonary fibrosis and moderate left pneumothorax with pneumomediastinum emphysema, soft tissue enlarged pulmonary artery.
Echocardiogram was performed and broad-spectrum antibiotics with Bactrim, Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone were started empirically.
Cardiomyopathy in [**2182**], viral, also per chart from outside hospital in [**2189-10-19**] had an ejection fraction of 55%.
PA pressure is 25 to 30.
History of mild renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine of 2.5.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.4, blood pressure 120/80, heart rate 75, respiratory rate 27, sating 80% on 6 liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, mucous membranes moist.
LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent laboratory data revealed white blood cell count 20.9, hematocrit 41.3, platelets 192, white cell count differential is 97% polys, 2% lymphs, 2% monos.
INR 1.1, PTT 19.6, creatinine 1.5, potassium 4.3, LDH 362.
Chest x-ray [**2-5**], increasing left apical pneumothorax with 20% volume loss, left lower lobe atelectasis, left pigtail catheter in place, bilateral diffuse interstitial opacities, blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
Chest computerized tomography scan [**2-4**], small left pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema and intramuscular emphysema, extensive pulmonary fibrosis, left greater than right, right predominantly lower lobe.
[**2190-2-5**], echocardiogram, ejection fraction greater than 55%, no patent foramen ovale, by Bubble study, mild right atrial enlargement.
Electrocardiogram, sinus rhythm with a rate of 112, axis -36, T wave inversions in 3 and 6, biphasic Ts and AVF.
The patient had been on Amiodarone which has also contributed and the patient also had a spontaneous pneumothorax on chest x-ray which was managed with chest tube placement as per Cardiothoracic Surgery.
Subsequently, however, the patient had worsening hypoxia and on [**2-6**], after extensive discussion with the patient and his wife, the patient was subsequently intubated given his worsening respiratory status.
The patient continued to be intubated with worsening hypoxemia throughout the hospital course and on [**2-10**], an extensive discussion was made with the family and given the patient's inability to wean off of his FIO2 and with worsening hypoxia it was agreed upon that the patient should have comfort care as an ultimate goal for his hospitalization, and on [**2-10**], the patient was subsequently placed on Comfort-Measures-Only.
Renal - The patient's creatinine continued to rise, likely due to hypotension.
