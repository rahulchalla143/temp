The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
========================= CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Large pericardial effusion similar to last examination.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Bladder, distal ureters, small bowel loops are normal.
At [**Hospital1 18**], she was initially managed on the floor where ECHO showed no tamponade but CT chest showed partial collapse of the L bronchus by her hilar mass as well as a pericardial effusion.
In the ICU, she was treated symptomatically with morphine for her SOB with improvement and possible pericardiocentesis and tissue biopsy were discussed with the family.
