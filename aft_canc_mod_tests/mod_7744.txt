Suboccipital craniotomy for resection of right cerebellar metastases, opening greater than 5 cm, autologous duraplasty using pericranial graft.
Routine chest x-ray in [**2112-2-6**] showed multiple bilateral nodular opacities measuring up to 1-2 cm.
A left upper lobe wedge biopsy was consistent with metastatic melanoma.
A CT scan also showed a 10.5 mm pericarinal lymph node and MRI of the head showed two metastatic lesions, one in the left frontal and one in the right inferior frontal.
One month followup MRI on [**5-2**], [**2112**], showed resolution of the right frontal met to 50% decrease of the left frontal met.
On [**2112-8-25**], torso CT showed some progression of the lung nodules.
The abdominal and pelvic CT was negative for disease.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: His blood pressure is 126/74, pulse of 74, respirations of 16, and temperature of 97.6.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Funduscopic exam showed blurred disks bilaterally.
Sensation was intact to light touch throughout.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2112-9-4**] 4:00 PM CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A perforated ventricular drain is seen entering the right ventricle from the frontal aspect, terminating in what appears to be the medial aspect of the right thalamus.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of subacute infarct in right middle cerebral artery territory  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2112-9-5**] 11:45 PM FINDINGS: There is interval development of hemorrhage into a subacute right frontal lobe infarction, as indicated by new hyperdensity, and there is expansion of the affected area.
Blood pressure was maintained on a nitroprusside drip post-operatively.
He was noted to have a post-op hematocrit of 28, therefore he was transfused 1unit of PRBC on POD#0.
Post-transfusion HCT was 33.
A CT showed post-op changes in addition to a previously identified metastasis in the right posterior parietal lobe.
The patient was still minimally responsive and was noted to move his right side more than the left to stimuli, therefore a CT head was ordered on POD#2.
A repeat CT on POD#3 showed interval worsening of the infarct with new hemorrhage into that area.
