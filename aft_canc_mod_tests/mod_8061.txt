At that time she received 2 minutes of CPR and 1mg of epinephrine with ROSC, her heart rate remained in the 30's and they began to externally pace her.
Labs at [**Location (un) 745**]-[**Location (un) 3678**] were notable for an INR of 2.0, BNP of 285.1, K of 6.0, Cr of 2.5 (baseline 0.8-1.0), BUN of 69, AST of 60, ALT of 40, t-bili of 1.4, WBC of 8 (24N, 12 band, 44L, 10M, 2E, 2atypical, 1myelo, 4 blast, 7NRBC's), HCT of 32.4, plt of 84, troponin I of 0.11.
A CT of her head was negative.
In the ED, initial VS were: 36.3C, 81, 135/114, 93% on AC 16x400, PEEP of 5, FiO2 of 100%.
Cardiology was consulted who felt that she did not require treatment for an NSTEMI since her troponin was indeterminate at the OSH, they recommended adission to the MICU and they would see the patient in consultation.
Labs were notable for lactate of 6.9 that improved to 4.1, Cr of 2.3, INR of 2.0, HCT of 31.4, plt of 94, CXR showed her ETT in the proper position.
VS on transfer: 70, 118/64, 24, 100% on AC 100%, PEEP 5, 420 x 18. .

RUE US IMPRESSION: No DVT MICROBIOLOGY URINE CULTURE (Final [**2136-3-30**]):    NO GROWTH Blood cultures-pending C. difficile DNA amplification assay (Final [**2136-3-31**]):       Negative for toxigenic C. difficile by the Illumigene DNA       amplification assay.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-1-31**], the findings are similar .
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-1-27**] the ventricular rate is slower and the intraventricular conduction delay is more pronounced .
CXR [**2136-3-30**] Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
CXR [**2136-4-2**] IMPRESSION: Interval worsening of the left lower lobe consolidation is consistent with infection/inflammation likely secondary to aspiration.
As her renal failure and acidemia improved, her heart rate normalized and on arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER she no longer required external pacing.
She then subsequently became tachycardic, so beta blocker was slowly reinitiated for afib rate control.
Because her blood pressures were slightly low (90's systolic on [**4-5**]) prior to discharge, the metoprolol is being held again.
She then spiked a fever on [**4-2**] and CXR demonstrated new LLL infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.
She improved clinically the following day and was afebrile, so vancomycin was stopped (MRSA swab negative from earlier in the admission).
After being given many liters of fluid resuscitation for her hypotension, she did have some acute on chronc CHF decompensation, which signs of volume overload on exam and hypoxia.
Enalapril will need to be restarted as blood pressures tolerate.
SBP improved to 120's-130's on day of discharge.
The patient's heart rate improved and she was started on metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] which she tolerated well.
A US was done which showed no evidence of DVT or underlying fluid collection.
Ruled out for MI, EKG with no changes.
CHRONIC, INACTIVE ISSUES: # Myelodysplastic syndrome:  platelet count remained low but stable in the 90K range throughout her hospital stay, however her hematocrit trended down, finally to 29.5 on the day of discharge, requiring a PRBC transfusion.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - restart Beta blocker and enalapril as BP tolerates (not restarted due to frequent hypotension) - Flagyl and cefepime through [**4-9**], then pull PICC line - Donepezil stopped due to toricollis - Coumadin/INR monitoring - decreased warfarin from 1.25mg to 1mg while on abx - Patient made DNR/DNI during this hospitalization after lengthy discussion with patient and family  Medications on Admission: - escitalopram 20mg daily - potassium - lidocaine patch daily - warfarin 1.25mg daily - lasix 20mg daily - pravastatin 10mg daily - donepezil 10mg QHS - Flaxseed - vitamin D 1000units daily - enalapril 20mg daily - aspirin 81mg daily - bisoprolol 5mg daily - multivitamin daily   Discharge Medications: 1. metronidazole 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours): through [**4-9**] .
Gout  SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: - chronic systolic heart failure EF of 35-40% - atrial fibrillation, CHADS2 score of 3 - hypertension - hyperlipidemia - dementia - pseudogout - anxiety/depression - anemia - likely MDS, requiring monthly transfusions - history of breast cancer - osteopenia - carotid artery stenosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
