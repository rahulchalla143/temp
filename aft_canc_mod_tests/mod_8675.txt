Review of Systems: Pain assessment on arrival to the floor: 0/10 (no pain).
- Hypothyroidism - Stage III CKD - CVA - fractured pelvis in fall several months ago  Social History: She lives alone.
Physical Exam: Vital Signs: T 97.9 BP 101/66 P 77 RR 18 SpO2 100% on 2L Physical examination: - Gen: Well-appearing in NAD.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
JVP <5 cm.
Motor [**5-20**] in upper and lower extremities bilaterally.
Sensation to light touch intact in upper and lower extremities bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: [**2156-4-27**] 04:40PM   WBC-8.3 RBC-3.44* HGB-9.5* HCT-29.5* MCV-86 MCH-27.5 MCHC-32.1 RDW-16.5* [**2156-4-27**] 04:40PM   NEUTS-74.6* LYMPHS-13.7* MONOS-8.9 EOS-2.4 BASOS-0.4 [**2156-4-27**] 04:40PM   PT-20.0* PTT-47.3* INR(PT)-1.8* [**2156-4-27**] 04:40PM   GLUCOSE-72 UREA N-27* CREAT-1.4* SODIUM-134 POTASSIUM-4.1 CHLORIDE-99 TOTAL CO2-27 ANION GAP-12 [**2156-4-27**] 04:40PM   CALCIUM-9.5 PHOSPHATE-3.8 MAGNESIUM-1.7 .
EKG - AFib, LAD, unchanged c/w prior with exception that TW is upright in I instead of inverted.
She was taken to the GI suite on [**2156-4-28**] for endoscopy which showed an "ulcerated mass with necrotic base highly suggestive of carcinoma" in the cecum.
She had a CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis to assess for metastasis and further define the tumor.
It confirmed colonoscopy findings and did not show evidence of metastasis.
There was 500 cc of estimated blood loss.Please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 3377**] operative note for further details.
After a brief stay in the PACU she was transferred to the floor but over the course of the night had low urine output, her blood pressure dropped to the systolic 80s/40s and her atrial fibrillation frequently took her heart rate to the 120s-130s.
She was continued on antibiotic coverage and the plan was for volume resuscitation with close monitoring of other aspects of her clinical picture.
She was transfused one unit of PRBCs, volume resuscitated with crystalloid and albumin and eventually her systolic pressures returned to the 90s-100s systolic.
Cardiology recommended nitroglycerin PRN as well as cycling enzymes which returned at 0.05->0.05->0.04.
Her afib was monitored on telemetry and she was treated with 5 mg IV lopressor q6 hours when NPO and transitioned to 25 mg PO BID.
[**Name (NI) 153**] Course Pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**5-1**] for management of hypotension and low urine output in setting of recent colectomy.
Her BP improved to 90-110 wo pressors.
Her EKG was checked and at baseline.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and mildly elevated trop attributed to underlying CKD and possible demand ischemia [**2-18**] tachycardia on presentation.
Her transfusion goals were for Hct<30 per cardiology recs pre-operatively.
EKG in the ICU was rechecked and at baseline.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled (see above).
# CHF: Systolic EF 35% on TTE [**8-/2155**] and global LV hypokinesis.
Cards consulted pre-op w recommendation to gently diurese for vol overload on presentation - last given 20mg IV lasix [**4-29**].
Repeat urine lytes notable for FeNA = 0.1% indicating prerenal hypovolemic picture.
Urine output was monitored and responded to IVF boluses w increase to 20cc/hour.
12. levalbuterol HCl 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization [**Month/Day (2) **]: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Blood Draw  [**Month/Day (2) **]: One (1) blood draw  once, [**2156-5-10**]: Please check INR value for coumadin dosing.
Disp:*1 blood draw* Refills:*0* 16. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg Tablet [**Month/Day/Year **]: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
Followup Instructions: Patient needs to have her INR checked on Monday, [**2156-5-10**], and have her coumadin dosing readjusted per results.
