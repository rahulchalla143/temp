-CT C-spine (prelim): 1. no fx or malalignment 2. prominent posterior osteophytes @ C3-C4 with neural foramina narrowing and moderate spinal canal narrowing, placing pt @ increased risk for cord injury - if clinical concern for such exists, MR would be recommended -CT head (prelim): 1. no ich.
MRI HEAD without contrast - IMPRESSION: 1.
RUQ Ultrasound - Limited imaging of four quadrants was performed to evaluate for ascites.
EEG - Results pending.
Final EEG results pending at time of discharge although suspicion for seizure activity overall is low.
Seroquel, opiates, benzodiazepines and his home trazodone were held/avoided to prevent further confusion.
# Abdominal discomfort:  He was initially treated with ceftriaxone 1g daily for SBP prophylaxis, but due to persistent abdominal discomfort, he received a diagnostic paracentesis on [**2162-2-25**].
Peritoneal fluid cultures were negative, but he was empirically treated with ceftriaxone 2g daily for 8 days due to high suspicion for SBP and potentially negative cultures while on prophylactic antibiotic dosing.
RUQ ultrasound [**2162-3-3**] revealed a small amount of ascites and with mildly increased LE edema, his diuretics were increased to furosemide 40mg [**Hospital1 **] and spironolactone 100mg daily.
HCV viral load 6,300 IU/mL.

You will need a repeat endoscopy in 2 weeks to ensure the ulcer has healed and monitoring of your esophageal varices.
You had an MRI of your brain which showed that you have "advanced microvascular disease" which likely explains your residual confusion.
The dose of this medication may need to be adjusted based on your blood levels which should be checked in 1 week.
