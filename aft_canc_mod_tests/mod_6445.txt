Patient had a PET scan in [**8-20**] that was normal except a low attenuation lesion in R parietal lobe.
Outpatient brain MRI on [**2100-9-17**] showed 1.2 cm right parietal mass with extensive edema c/w sole metastasis.

[**2100-9-17**], MRI brain with or without contrast:  1.2 cm R parietal intraparenchymal enhancing mass with extensive vasogenic edema is hgih suspicious for metastatic neoplasm.
[**2100-9-19**], CXR:  Limited study not including portions of the lower lobes with suggestion of cardiomegaly without failure.
[**9-25**] Head MRI: IMPRESSION: Limited study with no post-gadolinium T1 images obtained for assessment of residual mass.
Blood products and postoperative changes in the right parietal region are as expected.
[**9-27**] Head CT /c contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
An initial speech and swallowing study obtained while the patient was recommended soft solids.
She had an MRI WAND study overnight on [**9-23**] for surgical planning with plan for OR [**9-24**] am.
The patient's post-operative neurologic examination remained unchanged.
Post-op MRI revealed no evidence of new CVA or residual tumor.
Post operative imaging was performed which revealed post operative changes and no hemorrhage.
