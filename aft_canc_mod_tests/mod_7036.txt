Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
An eccentric, posterior directed jet of The mitral regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm.
An epiaortic scan showed and anterior rim of calcification and the canulation and cross clamp site were adjusted accordingly.
LV systolic function appears marginally improved in the setting of inotropes (LVEF25-30%).
An agitated saline bubble study revealed no intraatrial shunt at rest of with Valsalva and release.
The study is otherwise unchanged from prebypass.
