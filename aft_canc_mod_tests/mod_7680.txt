This [**Month (only) 205**], he felt unwell again and had a temperature of 102F.
He had an outpatient work up which included ECG, stress test and TTE.
TTE on [**8-30**] demonstrated a pericardial effusion measuring 1.5-1.9cm posteriorly, 1.3-2.1cm anteriorly and 0.8-1.6 cm behind the right atrium.
There was also severely decreased LV systolic function with EF 25-30%.
CXR showed post-surgical changes in the left hemithorax, patchy opacity with interstitial markings in the right lung base, suggestive of chronic COPD changes with atelectasis, but no pulmonary vascular congestion.
Bedside echo showed trace pericardial effusion w/o evidence of tamponade.
Patient was walked and dropped ambulatory sat to 86% and HR jumped to 140s.
D-dimer sent and elevated at [**Numeric Identifier 15717**].
Patient underwent CTA which was positive for multifocal PEs, LAD, lytic lesions and soft tissue mass in chest concerning for metastatic disease.
Bone scan was performed and showed multiple lytic lesions including a large one in the left femur, and also in the thoracic/lumbar spine, pelvis, and ribs.

Patient has also had MRI of the brain which was limited but with no obvious metastases seen.

CT Chest with contrast ([**9-9**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
TTE ([**9-10**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
A repeated study may be attempted with pre-medication, if feasible.
Fine osseous detail limits evaluation of the osseous pelvis.

Microbiology: - [**2171-9-13**] Tissue Cx from LYMPH NODE MEDIASTINAL AP WINDOW showed GRAM POSITIVE RODS, rare growth.
-[**9-9**] MRSA screen negative  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4318**] is a 68yo man with h/o left lower lobectomy for AV malformation, COPD, dilated cardiomyopathy and recent hospitalization for pericardial effusion who p/w weakness and dyspnea and was found to have multifocal PEs, lytic bone lesions and lymphadenopathy on CT.
# Likely metastatic neoplasm of unknown primary:  His chest CT upon admission showed lymphadenopathy and lesions suspicious for malignancy in the chest wall, rubs, and lungs.
Bone scan showed multiple lytic metastases to Lspine and Tspine as well as large lytic lesions in superior and midshaft L femur, concerning for potential for future pathologic fracture.
Thoracic surgery and Interventional Radiology were consulted and recommended a staged biopsy approach.
At the time of discharge to home with hospice, biopsy results were still pending but were thought to be indicative of non-small cell lung cancer.
He was started on warfarin 5mg PO qday on [**2171-9-16**], and was discharged with one week of enoxaparin to bridge; his INR will be monitored by his PCP's office.
There was no e/o tamponade on repeat echo performed at [**Hospital1 18**], and pt remained hemodynamically stable.
- [**2171-9-13**] Tissue Cx from LYMPH NODE MEDIASTINAL AP WINDOW showed GRAM POSITIVE RODS, rare growth.
You initially presented with weakness and chest pain, and you were admitted for treatment of pulmonary embolisms and to receive a biopsy of the mass in your chest.
Your biopsy was performed on [**2171-9-13**], and we are awaiting the final pathology results.
You were stable after your biopsy procedure, and you can be discharged to home.
Oxycodone: 1 to 2 tablets by mouth every 3 hours as needed for breakthrough pain.
CHANGED: None  STOPPED: -Prednisone (course completed) -While you were here, we stopped your lisinopril and furosemide because your blood pressures were normal.
You will also need to use oxygen at home, as your oxygen levels were less than 90% without supplemental oxygen.
