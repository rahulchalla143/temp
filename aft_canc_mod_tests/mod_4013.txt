There is interval development of vascular engorgement/mild pulmonary edema since prior study obtained on [**2105-12-20**] increased opacification at both bases consistent with volume loss and infiltrate.
She was transferred to the PACU requiring CPAP [**10-15**] FIO2 60% and was later transfer to SICU for respiratory distress The FIO2 was increased to 70% for oxygen saturation 87-89% improved to 90-93%.
Respiratory: POD2 she weaned to TM, 12L 02 sats 88-92% which is her baseline.
Her Trach was changed back to fenestrated, [**Location (un) **] #4 cuff less with oxygen saturations 90-92% on 50% Trach mask (her baseline).
