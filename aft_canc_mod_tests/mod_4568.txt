Just prior to the EP procedure, patient was noted to have elevatd BPs to 230/160; he was intubated and sedated with fentanyl and midazolam which improved pressures to 170/100.
Head CT was done which showed no gross bleed though did show a few nonspecific scattered white matter hypodense areas of uncertain chronicity.
Pt vomited in the [**Last Name (LF) 13042**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was reintubated for airway protection and started on propofol for sedation, which helped lower blood pressures.

AP and oblique films of the lumbar spine were also obtained.
MRI/MRA head and neck [**2184-1-14**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT head [**2184-1-12**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrahge or mass effect.
Head CT was negative for bleed but showed a CVA of indeterminate age; pt has known hx of CVAs.
MRI showed no signs of PRES or CVA.
It appeared that pt was very sensitive to SBP< 120 or > 200 and mental status was clear with SBP 120-200. .
# Severe Hypertension Patient has history of labile, difficult to control blood pressures.
He mmanipulates the timing of his blood pressure at home to keep better control and checks his blood pressure frequently.
A brief workup for HTN was done.
Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis.
No acute changes were noted but the Ortho team felt pt would benefit from an outpt MRI of spine to r/o worsening of known spinal stenosis.
