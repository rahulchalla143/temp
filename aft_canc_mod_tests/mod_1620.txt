On CT angiography, note is made of occlusion of proximal M2 segment of right MCA just at the bifurcation.
No evidence of infarction visible on non-contrast CT within brain parenchyma, however, there is slight perfusion decrease in right posterior temporal lobe.
Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.
MRA OF THE HEAD:  The head MRA demonstrates narrowing of the flow signal in the lateral portion of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery with diminished flow signal in the sylvian branches of right middle cerebral artery consistent with a thrombus in the middle cerebral artery.
ABNORMALITY #2: The background is slow in the 7 Hz theta frequency range and those in the entire right hemisphere was mildly disorganized and shows some increased voltage gradient.
SLEEP: This study shows wakefulness progressing to drowsiness.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-12-29**], the RV cavity size looks slightly larger.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would better exclude a possible source of embolism.
GI BX 1 DISTAL ESOPHAGUS: Distal esophagus, mucosa, biopsy:  Squamous epithelium with mild active esophagitis.
EGD FINDINGS [**4-5**]: -Small hiatal hernia, displacing Z-line to 37 cm from incisors, with narrowing at 40 cm from the incisors -Grade 4 esophagitis with spontaneous bleeding in the middle third of the esophagus, lower third of the esophagus and GE jxn.
Also noted on CTA were enhancement of peripheral small vessels, likley to be collaterals, and on perfusion mapping, note was is made of slight decrease in perfusion in posterior temporal lobe on the right.
He was admitted to the ICU following TPA for close monitoring; blood pressure autoregulated and after 24 hours, aspirin was recommended, which he refused given his GI bleed history (including a large GI bleed following aspirin use).
His exam continued to improve, and at discharge, he had mild dysarthria and subtle left finger extensor weakness alone.
He was transfused for a drop in HCT, and underwent endoscopy, which revealed gastritis and esophagitis (see "results" section), with low gastric PH, raising the possibility of retained antrum syndrome following a Billroth II operation.
A gastrin level was sent and was still pending at discharge.
The risks and benefits of the medications were explained to the patient, an in the end, with equivalent risk profiles and coumadin providing better protection from another cardioembolic event considering his embolic infarct and atrial fibrillation, coumadin was started after protein C and S panels were sent (results of which were pending at discharge, but appear to be normal).
He was set up with the [**Company 191**] coumadin clinic to follow his INR on this medication, with the goal INR being the narrow range of [**1-15**].5 in order to protect him as much as possible from both GI bleed and stroke.
Warfarin 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO at bedtime: please check INR on Friday, [**4-9**]; call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2173**] for instructions (coumadin clinic).
Please check INR on [**4-9**] on [**Location (un) **] [**Hospital Ward Name 23**], [**Hospital1 18**]; follow up with [**Company 191**] coumadin clinic for further instructions ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2173**])  Followup Instructions: Please call for neurology appointment with Drs.
