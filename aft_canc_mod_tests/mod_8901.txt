Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed common bile duct 13 mm, distended gallbladder, no choledocholithiasis, no obstructing mass.
Blood pressure was about 170 systolic, heart rate in the 80s, with an hematocrit of 34.2, which dropped to 31.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography fellow was called and scoped in the AM.
Echocardiogram showed normal biventricular function, moderate MR, moderate to severe TR, and pulmonary hypertension.
VRE in [**2114-4-3**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission her temperature was 100.3, pulse 89, blood pressure 188/45, respiratory rate 20, 97% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular movements intact, sclerae icteric, pupils small, 2 mm, surgical, oropharynx dry.
Rectal examination showed guaiac-positive stools, brown.
Neurologic examination showed her to be alert and oriented x 3, moving all four extremities.
Ultrasound showed dilatation of intrahepatic and common bile duct 13 mm, distended gallbladder, no pericholecystic fluid, positive dilated bile duct, no choledocholithiasis, no obstructing mass, normal kidneys.
LABORATORY STUDIES:  On admission her white count was 25.7, hematocrit 34.2, platelets 506, sodium 130, potassium 4, chloride 91, bicarbonate 27, BUN 18, creatinine 0.8, glucose 115, ALT 316, AST 369, alkaline phosphatase 1097, bilirubin 8.7 with direct of 6, amylase 79, lipase 98, INR 1.3, and partial thromboplastin time 28.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which had demonstrated stenosed and ulcerated distal esophagus and a duodenal mass suggestive of cancer, which was biopsied.
The patient subsequently underwent CT of the abdomen for further staging, which demonstrated three hypodense lesions in the liver (the biggest at 13 mm) and an atrophic pancreas.
No other nodes or significant lymphadenopathy was noted on CT of the chest and pelvis.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable and on the day of discharge was noted to be 34.3 down from 38 on the day of admission.
The patient's white count also decreased and the patient will continue a course of levofloxacin for seven days after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography as prophylaxis.
Liver chemistries were noted to taper down and on discharge, ALT was 201, AST 179, alkaline phosphatase peaked at 1,402, but dropped down to 1,084, and total bilirubin was down to 3.1.
Oncology:  Biopsies from the periduodenal mass are still pending but likely a metastatic adenocarcinoma to the liver.
White blood cell count was noted to be decreasing from 19 on admission to 16.2 on the day of discharge.
Zestril had been held on admission but was restarted and the patient responded well, however was noted to have blood pressures ranging 140s to 170s systolic, and probably should be followed up in the next week or two for a possible increase of Zestril.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient was noted to have hypomagnesemia and was repleted with two to three days of magnesium oxide; also noted to be hypocalcemic, and will receive Tums x 3 days with meals.
