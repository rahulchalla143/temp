CXR with cardiomegaly.
Bedside echo here with large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
repeat echo with small effusion.

Blood and urine cultures negative [**12-11**]: Sputum culture: MORAXELLA CATARRHALIS.
Imaging: [**12-2**]: CT chest/abd/pelvis: 1.
Multiple bilateral large mediastinal, axillary, retroperitoneal, and mesenteric lymph nodes of unclear etiology.
[**12-2**]: ECHO (post procedure): The left atrium is elongated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-12-2**], the pericardial effusion is smaller and RA collapse is no longer seenh.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-12-2**], the pericardial effusion appears slightly smaller than immediately post-tap.
[**12-9**]: CXR post-thoracentesis: Previous moderate-sized left pleural effusion is now much smaller.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**12-10**]: CT Chest with contrast: 1.
Enlarging mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy, consistent with patient's history of lymphoma.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-12-12**], the findings are similar.
Pathology: Pericardial fluid: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a small population (2% of total events) of monotypic kappa light chain restricted B-cells.
[**12-21**] Echo: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly  depressed.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-12-15**], the pericardial  effusion is now probably slightly larger.
Culture of the fluid revealed coag negative staph for which she completed 7 days of antibiotics.
Serial echocardiograms were done revealing resolution of the effusion.
A repeat echocardiogram the day prior to d/c revealed a stable small pericardial effusion.
Appointments were made for her to follow-up with a repeat echo in 2 wks from discharge as well as with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Subclavian lymph node biopsy revealed lymphoma and the flow was consistent with lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma with transformation.
# Shortness of breath: This was thought to be multifactorial [**1-27**] her cardiac disease, diffuse lymphadenopathy, anxiety, and bilateral pleural effusions.
Her exam was consistent with fluid overload (elevated JVP and periph edema) so we aggressively treated with lasix.
At discharge, her ambulating sat was 100% RA and she was discharged on 40 mg PO Lasix QD.
She underwent cardiac cath which revealed significant stenosis in the LAD which was stented with a drug eluting stent.
# Cards Pump: A post-cath echo showed good cardiac function.
However, followup echocardiograms demonstrated an EF of 50% in the setting of mod/severe MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] SOB, as above, was thought to be partially related to her poor cardiac function.
Per CT surgery, she will need repeat echocardiogram in 2 weeks from discharge.
The serum and urine studies were consistent with a component of SIADH and a component of pre-renal physiology.
CT Chest showed worsening lymphadenopathy.
CT surgery felt there was concern for DVT, RUE U/S negative for DVT.
ISSUES PENDING at DISCHARGE: 1) Pt will have repeat Echo 2 weeks after d/c.
