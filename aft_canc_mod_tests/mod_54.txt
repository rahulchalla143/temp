FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2135-2-11**]):    NO GROWTH.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2135-2-10**]):    <10,000 organisms/ml Pleural Pathology: pending CT chest: FINDINGS: Bulky lymphadenopathy is present in the imaged portion of the lower neck, superior mediastinum, throughout the intrathoracic mediastinum, bilateral hila, and to a lesser extent within the axillary regions.
This corresponds to a rapidly growing focal opacity on serial chest x-rays between [**2135-2-8**] and [**2135-2-10**].
Exam was not tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region, but note is made of retroperitoneal or intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy as well as incompletely imaged splenomegaly.
Lucent spine lesions within the lower thoracic spine (image 53, series 3A and image 48, series 3A) are probably hemangiomas.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
An area of echodensity measuring 7.4 cm x 4.9 cm (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) is seen that appears to be contained within a small right pleural effusion.
Clinical correlation and consideration of a chest CT for further characterization suggested.
[**Doctor Last Name 3012**] score appears to be low -1 (+1 for malignancy, -2 for other cause of dyspnea).
Gram stain with no growth.
CXR with LUL infiltrate.
Urine legionella negative.
Blood cx: NGTD.
CT scan consistent with multifocal pneumonia; though question of fungal per radiology, clinical suspicion higher for pneumococcal pathogen.
At time of transfer to floor on [**2-11**], oxygen saturation was >94% on 3L NC.
ALSO RECOMMEND CT CHEST AFTER TREATMENT COMPLETED.
Patient with history of chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 1.5.
Creatinine on admission 2.7.
UA and urine culture without sign of infection.
Creatinine slowly improved with IVF and was 2.3. at time of transfer to the medical floor.
Labs notable for elevated WBC >20 since 4/[**2134**].
Lung fluid cytology is PENDING at discharge and will need to be followed up.
Also, we recommend a follow up CT scan of the chest once your symptoms resolve.
