Hematocrit was found to be 21 at the outside hospital, he was given 4 units of packed red blood cells at that time, and his Hct was 30.3 upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
An EGD was performed on [**2148-7-4**], which showed a stricture at the gastroesophageal junction which was attributed to either post-radiation changes, a recurrence of his esophageal adenocarcinoma or changes related to a recent endoscopy.
The patient's Hct was 24.1 on [**2148-7-6**] and he was transfused one unit of packed red cells before discharge from the hospital with close followup.

You were transferred here from [**Hospital3 12594**] because your red blood cell levels were low and you were found to have a bleed in your stomach.
While you were here, we gave you blood transfusions and put you on an intravenous medication (protonix) to decrease your stomach acid.
Your red blood cell levels are more stable now than when you came into the hospital, but we expect that you will continue to need close followup as well as red blood cell transfusions.
