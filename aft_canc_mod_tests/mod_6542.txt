CT suggested a LLL infiltrate with effusion.
Echo did not show right heart strain.
LE doppler U/S and V/Q scan were negative for clots, so enoxaparin was stopped.
Furosemide given for pulmonary edema and hypoxia, but then creatinine worsened, Nephrology consulted, and dialysis started [**2121-1-3**].
Repeat renal U/S did not show hydronephrosis.
Hemodialysis started [**2121-1-3**].
# Hyperkalemia: Initially resolved with insulin/D50 and sodium polystyrene sulfonate.
CT head showed improved cerebral edema.
Cardiac enzymes negative.
Blood and urine cultures negative.
Recurred after dialysis line placed [**2121-1-2**] (trigger for BP 78/47) and improved again with IV fluids.
Completed  pip/tazo [**Date range (3) 83279**], vancomycin [**Date range (3) 83280**].
Echo unremarkable.
- Needs thyroid function tests and CXR in 2-3wks for amiodarone monitoring.
- EKG weekly x2 to follow QT interval while on amiodarone and sunitinib.
# Hypoxia: Likely causes include acute pulmonary edema and pneumonia, both seen on imaging as well as RCC.
BNP 941.
Given V/Q, LE doppler U/S, and echo findings, enoxaparin stopped.

However, your blood pressure became dangerously low and your heart developed an abnormal fast rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
Your kidney function returned to your baseline and blood pressure modestly improved.
However, you were requiring more oxygen and CT of the chest suggested pneumonia, for which you were given a course of antibiotics.
V/Q (nuclear) lung scan and ultrasound of the legs were negative for blood clots, so blood thinners were stopped.
Chest x-ray showed fluid on the lungs (pulmonary edema).
Persistent high potassium levels and high phosphorous levels will be treated primarily by dialysis.
Sunitinib (Sutent) 50mg by mouth once daily, 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off (chemotherapy).
Stop tamsulosin (Flomax) because your kidneys no longer make urine.
Calcium acetate to treat high phosphorous levels.
