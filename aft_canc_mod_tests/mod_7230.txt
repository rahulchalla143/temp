Ultrasound-guided puncture of right common femoral artery.
Third-order catheterization of left superficial femoral artery.
Angiography of left common femoral and superficial femoral arteries.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 14 mmHg and severely elevated left sided filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 29 mmHg and a prominent V wave.
The cardiac index was depressed at 1.3 L/min/m2.
There was low normal systemic arterial systolic pressures with an SBP of 100 mmHg.
Left ICA less than 40% stenosis.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-10-30**], left ventricular function is now mildly depressed and bioprosthetic aortic valve is now in place.

Pre-op Issues: # CHF exacerbation: BNP 8563 on [**10-24**].
Pts sats dropped on the am of [**10-30**] with possible flash pulmonary edema.
Bedside echo noted worsening mitral regurgitation and significant tricuspid regurg and the decision was made to transfer the pt to the CCU, where he was electively intubated.
TEE showed severe mitral regurgitation secondary to posterior leaflet flail, no thrombus.
Cycle enzymes to ROMI and they remained negative.
Follow up in the [**Hospital 4695**] Clinic in 4 weeks with a Non Contrast Head CT with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 739**].
# Leukocytosis: WBC 12.3 and 88% PMNs on [**10-24**].
CXR [**10-24**] shows no acute process and pt was afebrile with no cough and satting well albeit DOE.
Lactate 1.6 on [**10-24**].
WBC remained elevated in the 11-12,000 range with left shift but pt was afebrile from admission to [**10-30**] when he was transferred to ICU.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in fair condition.
Initially on transfer to the CVICU, patient required multiple Inotropes and Vasopressor support with an extremely low mixed venous SaO2 at 48% and cardiac index of 1.5 with on Epinephrine and Levophed.
A transesophageal echo demonstrated inferior wall motion abnormalities and when the patient was not being paced, there were ST elevations in the inferior leads.
Neurology was consulted and a stat head CT was performed.
Head CT was negative for acute event, his mental status improved on reexamination in afternoon and appeared to be back at baseline.
UA and culture were sent.
Foley will remain in place and will need a voiding trial done at rehab.
11. warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO once a day: Adjust for a goal INR of [**2-14**].5 for atrial fibrillation.
Coumadin held [**11-12**] d/t INR of 2.9.
