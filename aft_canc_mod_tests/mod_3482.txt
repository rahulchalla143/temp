_____________________________________________________  CT Orbits IMPRESSION [[**4-24**]]: 1) A large defect within the left orbit from prior enucleation.
3) There is partial opacification of the mastoid air cells on the right, including the middle ear cavity, raising the question of mastoiditis  CT Head IMPRESSION [[**4-24**]]: 1.
The soft tissue and osseous changes within that area appear similar to those seen on the prior study from [**2111-10-30**].
Head MR IMPRESSION[[**4-24**]]: 1) Status post exenteration of the left orbit and ethmoid sinuses.
Echo Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably normal (LVEF>55%); focused views only so  regional wall motion abnormalities cannot be excluded.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade in limited views.
# Meningitis: LP in the ED significant for WBC 7200 with 97 polys, consistent with bacterial meningitis.
Given patient's extensive history of sinus and orbital infection, in addition to proven otitis media, highly concerning for contiguous spread of infection or spread from a strep pharyngitis since his blood cultures at [**Hospital **] Hospital gre out Strep pyogenes.
His MRI did not show any fluid collection that Neurosurgey would drain.
Repeat LP showed marked improvement with WBC 71 and GS without PMNs or MICROORGANISMS seen.
EEG was negative for seizure activity.
MRI with evidence of subacute CVA with distribution consistent with septic emboli.
LFT normalized during admission and no further workup indicated.
