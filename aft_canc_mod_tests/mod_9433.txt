upon stabilization of his blood pressure post diuresis.
This is to decrease his portal pressure which is presumably causing the varices.
His white blood cell count decreased following the initiation of clindamycin and the patient's left elbow was clinically improved with decreased edema and erythema.
The patient had an echocardiogram which demonstrated no significant right-sided heart failure.
He also had an ultrasound of the abdomen which demonstrated no reversal of flow in the portal system and normal flow in the inferior vena cava.
He had one brief episode of his blood pressure dropping into the high 80s systolic two days prior to discharge but this was presumed secondary to starting of Nadolol for ileostomy varices.
The patient received 1 unit of packed red cells on the floor and his hematocrit was otherwise stable, ranging between roughly 26.5 and 30.
q.d., held for systolic blood pressures less than 95 to be started on [**2105-3-16**].
