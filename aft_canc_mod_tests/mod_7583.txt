He was taken to an OSH where a CT head was done showing a right parietal lobar hemorrhage with extension into the right lateral ventricle.
He was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Normal bulk and tone bilaterally Left pronator drift Intact to light touch x 4 extremities Toes downgoing bilaterally  On Disharge: patient is AO x3, PERRL, face symmetric, tongue midline.
Pertinent Results: CT head [**2160-7-29**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Recommend MR imaging following resolution of acute hemorrhage for further characterization if not contra-indicated.
CT head [**2160-7-29**] post EVD: 1.
CT head [**2160-7-30**] 1.
[**2160-8-2**]  CT head post biopsy: IMPRESSION: Hemorrhagic mass centered in the splenium, and extending to the bifrontal lobes.
[**2160-8-4**] CT Head: 1.
[**2160-8-7**] CT Head: 1.
LENS [**2160-8-8**] No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.
His exam remained stable overnight however during the day on [**7-29**] he became more lethargic.
STAT head CT demonstrated progressive hydrocephalus and an External Ventricular Drain was placed at the ICU beside.
Post procedure CT head demonstrated catheter within the right lateral ventricle terminating within the 3rd ventricle without new hemorrhage.
MRI with contrast was completed on [**7-30**] which demonstrated a enhancing mass within the splenium of the corpus callosum.
Post procedure CT scan showed a R EVD placement without new hemorrhages or infarct.
His dilantin level was 11 so he was given a bolus with a goal in the upper teens.
Post-op CT head on [**8-2**] showed no new hemorrhage.
Head CT on [**8-4**] demonstrated stable ventricular size without evidence of new hemorrhage.
His mental status began to improve and so on [**8-5**] he was transferred out of the ICU to the Step Down unit and an EVD wean was inititated, the drain was raised to 20cm above the tragus.
A CT head was done in the am of [**8-7**] and was stable.
A CT head was done on [**8-8**] and showed no change in ventricular size.
His exam remained stable.
