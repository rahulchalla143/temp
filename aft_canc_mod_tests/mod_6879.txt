Evaluate for underlying mass as described on the prior CT of the head.
COMPARISON: Prior CT of the head without contrast dated [**4-28**], [**2187**].
TECHNIQUE: Pre-contrast axial and sagittal T1-weighted images were obtained, axial FLAIR, axial magnetic susceptibility, axial T2, diffusion-weighted sequences.
After the administration of intravenous gadolinium contrast material, the T1-weighted images were repeated in axial T1, sagittal MP-RAGE and multiplanar reconstructions.
In comparison with the prior CT dated [**2187-4-28**], again a focus of hemorrhage is identified on the left temporal lobe, measuring approximately 6.6 x 10.0 mm in size (4:11), the T2 and FLAIR images demonstrate multiple scattered areas of hyperintensity signal in the subcortical white matter, likely consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes, the sulci and ventricles are prominent, likely indicating atrophy and possibly involutional in nature.
Results of the echo are in the reports section of this summary.
Repeat images were obtained and were stable.
An MRI of the brain was done and ruled out underlying mass.
