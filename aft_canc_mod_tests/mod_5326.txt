Cultures from blood, pleural fluid, lymph node biopsy as well as sputums to the time of his discharge all ultimately grew MTB from culture despite have negative AFB smear.
Prior liver biopsy was consistent with GVHD, and his LFTs continued to be elevated since discontinuation of his TB meds.
Glucose level was normal, gram stain, AFB smear and culture, TB PCR and adenovirus PCR were negative.
During this admission he also had a chest CT which revealed bilaterally upper lobe infiltrates with nodules and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance.
Sputums were negative for AFB smear but poor sampling precluded concentrated smear.
The patient refused bronchoscopy at that time, and the plan upon discharge was repeat CT scan in one week.
He was seen in the [**Hospital **] clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who ordered a repeat level which remained elevated to 152.
Sputum cultures were negative for PCP on DFA (although these were poor samples), however bacterial cultures were positive for Stenotrophomonas.
His cough has been improving in the past few days.
CTA was performed which did not reveal PE; however a large pericardial effusion and bilateral effusions as well as mild ascites and cystic mass in pancreatic head.
TTE at the OSH was reportedly negative for tamponade, although the patient did have one episode of hypotension with SBP to the 70s which responded to a 500 cc bolus.
His platelet count was noted to be 17.
Per verbal report approximately 400 cc of dark blood was drained.
CT scan revealednecrotic lymph nodes in the superior mediastinum and periportalregion, and multiple low attenuation lesions in the liver and spleen concerning for microabscesses from a disseminated infection.
