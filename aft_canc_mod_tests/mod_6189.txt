Patient was admitted from [**Date range (1) 56895**]/11 for evaluation of hemoptysis.
In the ED, initial vital signs were 97.8 91 171/70 24 89% on RA.
Also received labetalol 10 mg for hypertension 213/102 with heart rates in the 120s.
EKG showed new left bundle branch block.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 96.7 BP 78/46 HR 67 RR 22 100% intubated General: intubated, sedated, no acute distress HEENT: intubated, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: coarse BS b/l, no rales or wheezes appreciated CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, prominent holosystolic murmur radiating from L AVF Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, excellent thrill in the L AV fistula   Pertinent Results: TT Echo: [**2-24**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
TE Echo [**2-25**]: Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
TT Echo [**3-3**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-2-24**], the severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are now lower.
C. Cath ESTIMATED blood loss: <100 cc Hemodynamics (see above): Coronary angiography:  right dominant LMCA:  No angiographically-apparent CAD.
Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse hemorrhage without purulence.
He required 2 units pRBC for hematocrit decrease from 31 to 23.5.
Etiology of hemoptysis was suspected to be new severe mitral regurgitation (not seen on TTE just 10 days prior); autoimmune workup from prior admission was within normal limits.
Nicardipine drip was initiated for blood pressure control/afterload reduction; he was subsequently transitioned back to home blood pressure regimen.
Patient underwent evaluation by cardiology and cardiac surgery.
For evaluation of hypokinetic LV papillary muscle (without rupture) with surrounding normal myocardium, he was initially planned for cardiac MRI to assess for amyloidosis - given risk of NSF on ESRD, this was not done.
Case was discussed with BMT service; repeat protein electrophresis revealed persistent monoclonal gammopathy.
Carvedilol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] was added to his blood pressure regimen.
He will also need a fistula-gram as an outpatient.
We controlled your BP agreessivly and your mitral regurgitation and shortness of breath improved.
Controlling your blood pressure will be an important part of preventing this from happeneing again.
