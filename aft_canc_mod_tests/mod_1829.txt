He was admitted and underwent stereotactic brain biopsy of the left frontal mass.
He underwent an excisional biopsy of a left axillary lymph node on [**2184-6-23**].
By immunohistochemistry, there were large lymphoid cells diffusely immunoreactive for pan B cell markers CD20+ with co-expression of BCL-2 and BCL-6.
Both pathology and immunohistochemistry were consistent with diffuse large B cell lymphoma with follicular germ cell center.
PET scan on [**2184-7-1**] was notable for innumerable foci of marked abnormal uptake of FDG within lymphadenopathy throughout the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
PET CT on [**2184-8-12**] was notable for decreased lymphadenopathy throughout.
A PET-CT after cycle 5 still noted a 3x2 cm left axillary LN (SUV 3.3).

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-12-14**] 1:01 AM FINDINGS: There are multiple masses in the brain.
CT STEREOTAXIS W/ CONTRAST  [**2184-12-15**] 3:56 PM FINDINGS: Corresponding to findings of the [**2184-12-14**] MRI, contrast-enhancing masses with surrounding vasogenic edema are noted abutting the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, within the left frontal lobe along the midline, and adjacent to the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
Pre-operative evaluation for stereotactic biopsy, demonstrating enhancing masses surrounded by vasogenic edema located adjacent to the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, and the midline left frontal lobe.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-12-15**] 7:20 PM FINDINGS: Two left, and one small right-sided mass and surrounding vasogenic edema are not significantly changed, allowing for differences in technique on this non-contrast enhanced study.
MRI shows new brain lesions with surrounding edema but no midline shift or hydrocephalus.
His urine was alkylanized and he was discharged when his MTX level diminished.
His post therapy scan showed a persistent node in his left axilla and he is currently undergoing XRT.
He developed above neurologic sxs and MRI done and found 2 new brain lesions, concerning for diffuse disease.
alkalynized urine with IV bicarb (3 amps at 150/hr) and oral bicarb (650mg po tid + 1300 mg po q2hr prn urin pH < 7.5).
His atenolol was continued and his lisinopril was restarted before discharge.
LDL 138.
Prilosec can be used to protect your stomach, though you can use protonox for two days while you are taking leucovorin  You should check your blood sugars at home before meals and at bedtime.
If your sugars remain consistently less than 200 then you can check only once or twice a day.
Please call your primary care physician if your sugars are consistently greater than 200.
