Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, anicteric sclerae, normal conjunctiva, pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation from 4 mm to 2 mm with extraocular movements intact without nystagmus.
Jugulovenous pressure is 4 cm at 45 degrees.
Heart:  Point of maximal impulse is in the fifth rib space in the midclavicular line.

Vascular:  Carotid, radial, femoral, dorsalis pedis pulses are brisk and equal.
Sensory examination:  Grossly normal, he had normal rapid alternating hand movements, the deep tendon reflexes were brisk and equal bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 10, 500, hemoglobin 14 mg/dl, hematocrit 41.1%, platelets 254,000/mcl.
Sodium 137, potassium 2.7, chloride 94, bicarbonate 31, blood urea nitrogen 33, creatinine 0.7, glucose 118, calcium 8.5, phosphate 2.8, magnesium 1.3.
ALT 200, AST 148, alkaline phosphatase 244, total bilirubin 10.2, amylase 40, lipase 24, carcinoembryonic antigen was 6.9.
Repeat hematocrit was 43.1.
The patient underwent abdominal imaging showing a mass in the porta hepatis as well as a calcified mass in the right upper pole of the right kidney.
Arrangements were made for him to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and possibly colonoscopy after the computerized tomography scan was obtained.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  After admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient had his INR reversed completely with a total of 4 units of fresh frozen plasma.
The patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
Intraductal ultrasound confirmed that the lesion was not a stone.
At the time of this dictation the results of those pathological examinations are pending.
On the day following his endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography he was found to have stable hematocrit, electrolytes had returned to [**Location 213**] as had his INR.
However, his amylase and lipase were markedly elevated (amylase was 1,062, lipase was [**Numeric Identifier 52792**]), however, the patient had no pain.
