A head MRI of the brain showed a tectal mass and three areas of nodular enhancement on the ventricular surfaces, concerning for brain metastases with ventricular seeding.
She underwent a stereotactic biopsy on [**2148-4-22**] which was consistent with high-grade B-cell lymphoma.
CT of the torso on [**2148-4-24**] did not show a distinct primary site, only some subcentimeter left axillary lymph nodes.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature is 98.8 F. Her blood pressure is 160/86.
Heart rate is 73.
Respiratory rate is 16.
Oxygen saturation is 98% in room air.
Funduscopic examination reveals sharp disks margins bilaterally, and there is spontaneous venous pulsations.
Her muscle strengths are [**5-27**] at all muscle groups.
Her reflexes are 2-.
Coordination examination does not reveal dysmetria.
MRI Brain, Post Methotrexate (Preliminary Read): Marked improvment in dominant midbrain lesion, now diminished to 3-4mm slightly heterogenously enhancing nodule with no hydrocephalus or aqueduct stenosis.
CT Torso: 1.
A follow up MRI showed diminished size of her midbrain lesion and overal edema.
