Reoperative right thoracotomy with right upper lobectomy     and en bloc right chest wall resection (ribs 3,4 and 5)     with [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex chest wall reconstruction and     decortication of right middle and right lower lobes   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 75713**] was initially evaluated for resectability of a locally-advanced right lung cancer.
At that time, he appeared to have a right chest abnormality which on fiberoptic bronchoscopy was cytologically positive for malignancy.
He underwent cervical and anterior mediastinoscopy that did not show any involvement of the mediastinal lymph nodes followed by a thoracoscopy and subsequent exploratory thoracotomy which defined a chest wall invasive lesion felt to be T3 if not, T4 because I presume a diffuse pleural involvement.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images of the chest are obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Multiplanar reformation images are reconstructed.
COMPARISON: Chest CT dated [**2100-12-1**], and multiple prior chest radiographs dating between [**2100-12-13**] to [**2100-12-27**].
The evaluation of mediastinal structures and great vessels is limited due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Multiplanar reformation images confirm above finding.
Limited study due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for assessment of mediastinum and great vessels.
The evaluation of the residual right lung is extremely difficult due to extensive pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum.
Please consider dedicated abdominal imaging for the assessment of metastatic disease.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
His blood pressure was well controlled.
On POD 3 he became more short of breath and his CXR showed white-out of the lower/middle lobe on right.
Secretion were sent for culture and eventually grew Serratia (see ID section).
He subsequently underwent bronchoscopy on [**12-24**], and [**12-28**] for mucus plugging.
On [**1-1**] the last chest tube was removed.
CXR showed a pneumothorax.
Serial x-rays showed the air collection to be stable > 24 hours.
ID:  In light of worsening respiratory status and chest x ray with some lung collapse and mucus plugging, patient was started on Vanco/Zosyn.
Following bronchoscopy on [**12-25**], BAL cultures returned with Serratia that was pan-sensitive.
Because of continuing secretions, sputum cultures were sent on [**1-1**].
