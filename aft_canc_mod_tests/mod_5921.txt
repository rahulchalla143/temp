LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-1-17**], a very small pericardial effusion is now seen.
Acute kidney failure - presented with Cr 4.8 with FeNa 3.75% and FeUrea 55.10%, arguing obstructive cause in setting of invasive bladder carcinoma.
However, creatinine responded well to iniital fluid trial, dropping from 4.8 to 4.1, and then large improvement after bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes.
Coronary artery disease - Presenting with ST elevation in inferolateral leads, troponin peak of 2.
Underwent cardiac catheterization that revealed coronary artery disease.
