Did have a bleeding scan that was unrevealing on [**3-3**] and underwent colonscopy on [**3-6**] which demonstrated small internal hemorrhoids and multiple diverticuli w/ mixed openings in sigmoid and descending colon.
Initially noted to be tachy to 120's but w/ systolic blood pressures in 110's.
Arrangements made for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] and upon ED arrival, noted to hypotensive to sytolic blood pressure of 60's and labs notable for crit of 22 (28.3 on [**3-7**]) and sodium of 123.
Systolic blood pressures running in 90's-100's.
Urine output noted to be 40cc over last hour.
Surgery consulted, suggested potential colectomy if bleeding persisted and pt hemodynmically unstable.
[**3-9**] Tagged RBC scan- Blood flow images show increased tracer activity beginning at approximately 40 minutes in the pelvis just right of midline projecting superior to the bladder.
It initially appeared by nuclear scan that bleeding was localized to the sigmoid colon.
NGT lavage neg in the ED.
Her crit improved from 22 to 30.
Pt's hematocrit did eventually drop further on second ICU stay from 30 back to 22 for which she required 4 units of prbc.
Hypotension: Pt initially presented to ED hypotensive to systolic 60's in the setting of massive lower gi bleed.
She was aggressively resusicated with IVF and multiple units of PRBC and her pulse improved to high 90's and low 100's.
Recheck of CBC demonstrated a new leukocytosis to 35K and pt was hypothermic later during HD1.
2 sets of blood cultures subsequently positive for MSSA (4 out of bottles) and uc w/ ecoli.
MSSA Bacteremia: Blood cultures from [**3-9**] have grown Methicillin Sensitive Staph Aureus in 4 out of 4 bottles.
Subsequent blood cultures from [**3-10**] and [**3-11**] are no growth to date.
In order to evaluates source, TTE was performed, which was negative for vegetations.
CT of T&C spine was negative for epidural abscess.
E.Coli UTI: Culture reveals EColi that was pan-sensitive, however her initial UA was not suggestive of infection.
