HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88 year old woman with past medical history of CLL, tuberculosis, status post nine months of medical treatment; nephrolithiasis; recurrent urinary tract infection; chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine between 1.5 and 2, who presented to the Emergency Department for malaise.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon arrival, vital signs reveal a temperature of 99.3; heart rate of 90; blood pressure 122/55; respiratory rate of 25; 100% saturation on room air.
LABORATORY DATA:  CBC showed a white count of 18.4.
The patient's baseline white count is around 20, secondary to her CLL.
Hemoglobin was 8.6; hematocrit was 27.7; platelet count of 55.
Chemistry 7 showed a sodium of 140; potassium of 4.8; chloride of 112; C02 of 10; BUN of 104; creatinine of 4.9 and glucose of 113.
Her calcium was 9.5; magnesium was 2.2; phosphorus of 7.5.
Urinalysis was cloudy, with moderate LE and positive nitrites, large blood; 30 protein; 21 to 50 white blood cells; 3 to 5 red blood cells; rare bacteria; 0 to 2 epis.
Urine culture was sent.
Urine electrolytes and osmolarity was sent, as well as urine eosinophils given the drugs that she was taking.
Liver function tests and TSH were also sent at that time.
Arterial blood gases on the Emergency Department was 7.26, 20, 104, 9, negative 15, with a lactate of 0.7.
She had a chest x-ray done in the Emergency Department showing bilateral patchy opacities that may be secondary to atelectasis or low lung volume.
A renal ultrasound was ordered at that time but was still pending.
An atrophic cortex was noted in that kidney.
The left kidney was not well visualized but in previous imaging done in [**2104-11-3**] had severe hydronephrosis.
CT non contrast of the abdomen was taken as well, which showed a very atrophic left kidney as well as right hydro.
She received intravenous fluids with b1 to attempt to compensate for her acidosis and her chemistries and arterial blood gases were monitored.
The patient's creatinine started to decline by hospital day number two to three, into the lower 4's.
She continued to have good urine output and was never oliguric.
Urinalysis clearly showed pyuria but cultures remained negative during the hospital stay.
This prompted a search later in the stay for urinary tuberculosis, which ultimately was negative.
The patient continued to receive intravenous fluids with bicarbonate as well as Ciprofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection and her creatinine continued to improve.
Her creatinine had clearly been climbing slowly over the last two years, in the setting of a chronic obstructive uropathy.
Repeated chest x-ray showed evidence of mild failure.
An arterial blood gases was performed on the 16th showing a pH of 7.35, PC02 of 50; P02 of 60; bicarbonate of 29 and base excess of 0.
Repeat arterial blood gases showed a pH of 7.06 and P02 of 120.
Anesthesia was called to the bedside for a stat evaluation and the patient was intubated.
The patient had a CT of the chest ordered which showed multiple, ill-defined nodules in the right upper lobe, with peribronchial wall thickening, possibly due to progressive infection, such as granulomatous disease versus tracheobronchitis, via neoplastic infiltration.
A bronchoscopy was considered.
There was a small pericardial effusion that appeared improved from previous examination and interval resolution of the left pleural effusion.
She had also had a VQ scan that was done just prior to unit transfer that was low probability.
An echo done on the 19th showed an ejection fraction of over 55% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy, 1+ aortic regurgitation, trace mitral regurgitation and no evidence of tamponade.
The pulmonary team remained unclear on the source of her CT abnormalities as well as her continued breathing difficulties.
The acute renal failure appeared to have completely resolved and her creatinine had fallen to 1.6.
Epo 5000 units subcutaneous three times a week.
