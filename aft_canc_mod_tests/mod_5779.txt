Finding is unchanged when compared with the chest radiograph obtained two hours prior.
Echo [**3-13**] The left atrium is normal in size.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.

Cardiac cath COMMENTS: 1.
The LMCA, LAD, and LCX were not injected.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 10 mm Hg and PCWP mean of 12 mm Hg.
The cardiac index with IABP and vasopressors was 2.5 l/min/m2.
Echo [**3-14**] There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-3-13**], left ventricular systolic function is improved.
Discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1060**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29932**] at 11:30 a.m., [**2197-3-15**].
EKG showed anterior and inferior Q waves, ST elevations of inferior leads and aVR, and lateral ST depressions.
His CXR showed complete white-out of both lung fields, thought secondary to pulmonary edema from cardiogenic shock, and aspiration pneumonitis.
Initial echo showed LVEF 15%.
Cardiac Catheterization from outside hospital showed severe three vessel disease, with collaterals from RCA to LAD, and active thrombus in the RCA.
He was therefore taken for cardiac catheterization and received BMS X4 to his RCA.
The following day, after coronary intervention, his echo had an LVEF of 40%.
ABG was 7.47/37/68.
CXR with possible increased left sided infiltrate.
ekg unchanged.
CT scan and CXR were consistent with Multi-lobar Pneumonia thought to be due to VAP.
Plavix was increased to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] for prevention of thrombosis of his BMS x 4.
A JAK 2 level was sent for evaluation of possible polycythemia.
#)ARF: Patient developed acute renal failure with progressively increasing creatinine up to 2.8 after being hospitalized for three days.
His renal function began to improve once the balloon pump was removed, and his creatinine decreased to a level of 1.0 prior to discharge.
Disp:*90 Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute STEMI- inferior MI s/p stent to RCA Ventilator associated pneumonia Systolic CHF with EF 40%   Discharge Condition: Stable, planning for CABG in next few weeks.
You had a cardiac catheterization to have a stent placed in the arteries of your heart to open them up.
