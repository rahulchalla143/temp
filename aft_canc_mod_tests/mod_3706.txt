On admission to OSH, she was afebrile with RR 26 and breathing 94% on room air.
Inital ABG was notable for pH 7.58/pCO2 23.4/pO2 54/HCO3 21 on 2L of supplemental oxygen.
Work-up at the OSH included an elevated d-dimer, a V/Q scan that was low probability for PE, a LE US negative for DVT, a CT-angiogram that was negative for PE with incidental finding of RUL infiltrates, and TTE which revealed severe pulmonary hypertension with mild R heart dysfunction and TR.
Follow up high-res chest CT showed progressive ground glass infiltrates in upper lobes bilaterally.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and pulmonary consultation.

CARDIAC CATH [**2176-7-1**] COMMENTS: 1.
A swan was placed using the right internal jugular vein.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated right-sided pressures with a RVSP of 90 mm Hg and PASP of 95 mm Hg with a mean of 58 mmHg.
Coronary angiography was deferred.
Cardiac output is reduced at 3.4 l/min with an index of 1.8 l/min/m2.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2176-7-3**] IMPRESSION: -No evidence of interstitial fibrosis.
-Ground-glass opacity in the upper lobes has improved from CXR of four days ago, consistent with an acute process.
ECHO [**2176-7-3**] IMPRESSION: Small secundum atrial septal defect with right-to-left flow at rest and with maneuvers.
Brief Hospital Course: Pulmonary hypertension: Diagnosed by TTE at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital, where chest CT showed no evidence of PE, only mild interstitial lung opacities R>L.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she was clinically stable, satting in the mid 90s% on 3-4L supplemental O2 by nasal cannula.
Testing for secondary causes of pulmonary hypertension included HIV, which was negative, scleroderma, which was weakly positive (see below), pulmonary function tests for COPD, which did not show any significant obstructive disease, and doppler abdominal ultrasound, which showed normal portal venous flow, making portopulmonary HTN unlikely.
She underwent right heart catheterization with Swan-Ganz cath placement on hospital day#3, which confirmed elevated pulmonary artery pressures (PASP 98, mean 58).
Following this, she was transferred to the MICU with a PA catheter for a monitored two-day sildenafil trial, which showed minimal response in PAP but more impressive symptomatic response in her exertional dyspnea and oxygen requirement.
Hepatology was consulted, and testing for other causes of liver disease besides past alcohol use included hepatitis A, which was positive likely from prior infection, hepatitis B, which showed no evidence of prior exposure, and hepatitis C, which was positive with a viral load of 28,500.
Other tests recommended by Hepatology included [**Doctor First Name **], soluble liver Ag, and ANCA, which were negative, and anti-smooth muscle antibodies, Scl-70, and ACE, which were mildly positive.
In the setting of HCV, these elevations of Igs and auto-Abs could suggest mixed cryoglobulinemia, although further evaluation and HCV subtyping was not pursued during this admission.
Consecutive CTs at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital revealed progressing ground glass opacities bilaterally.
Her sputum production improved over this time, and CT at [**Hospital1 18**] showed interval improvement of the opacities.
Sputum and urinary testing did not show any evidence of bacterial or legionella infection.
Oropharyngeal lesions: Initial oropharyngeal exam revealed non-painful, non-tender, white lesions on the soft palate that did not scrape off.
You should have an echocardiogram of your heart performed in 1 months time.
Please call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 19380**] to schedule an appointment for a repeat echocardiogram of your heart in ~1 month.
