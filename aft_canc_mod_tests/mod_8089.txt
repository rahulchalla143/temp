Pathology: [**2133-8-10**] SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: immunophenotyping - PB, necrotic neck mass INTERPRETATION.
A concurrent cytospin preparation shows numerous large lymphoma cells.
CXR [**2133-8-7**] There is an extremely large mass in the superior/mid mediastinum with  maximal overall  width of approximately 11.5 cm.
[**2133-8-10**] CXR There is interval increase in right pleural effusion.
The widened mediastinum is partially imaged on CT neck from [**2133-8-6**] demonstrating massive conglomerate encasing mediastinal structures and vessels.
No echo evidence of tamponade physiology.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. [**Known lastname 26248**] is a 38 y/o female with a history of depression who presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**8-6**] with worsening shortness of breath and recurrent headaches found to have a large pericardial effusion with ECHO findings conerning for tamponade.
A PET scan was done which showed extensive bulky FDG-avid lymphadenopathy involving the mediastinum, with additional FDG-avid disease seen in the bilateral lower cervical regions, supraclavicular regions, right axillary, hila, and paraesophageal region.
She remained afebrile and her WBC count on discharge was 4.1.
Tumor lysis labs were drawn twice per day, without any evidence of tumor lysis.
She underwent a pericardiocentesis which drained about 450 cc of fluid.
The fluid was sent for flow and cytology and chemistry.
The strongyloides, histoplasma and O+P were all negative.
