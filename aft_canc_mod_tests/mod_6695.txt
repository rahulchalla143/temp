Her WBC was 10.1 with 15% others.
She underwent remission induction therapy with 7+3 (daunorubicin 90mg/m2 days [**12-1**] and cytarabine 100 mg/m2 days [**12-5**]).
Her course was complicated by pulmonary infiltrates which were likely leukemia, fever/neutropenia with negative evaluation and thought to be possible drug fever and pericardial effusion/tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis.
The etiology of her pericardial tamponadewas not determined, though there were atypical cells in the fluid (thought to be reactive lymphocytes).
Her peripheral blasts did resolve with further recovery.
On [**2111-6-8**], she was noted to have a new rash on her torso and biopsy demonstrated leukemia cutis.
Bone marrow examination on [**2111-6-10**] demonstrated generalized dysplasia with 5% blasts.

Color Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] was performed, demonstrating patent left portal, right anterior and right posterior portal veins, SMV, IVC, and hepatic veins, with direction appropriate flow.
Evaluation of hepatic vasculature was suboptimal, due to patient's inability to breath-hold.
[**9-7**] CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS: CHEST: Left internal jugular line terminates in the distal SVC, and a right large-bore catheter extends from the internal jugular vein into the deep right atrium.
Lung volumes are low.
Limited non-contrast examination reveals no clear source of infection.
Her BP was 70s/40s when a Code Blue was called.
Her SBP again feel to the 70s and pressors were initiated.
Her antibiotic coverage was broaded and her BP improved to the point where she was no longer pressor dependent.
A post-intubation CXR revealed that the ET tube was in the right mainstem bronchus, the location of which was adjusted and confirmed on repeat CXR.
A RUQ ultrasound did not show ascites, venous occlusion, or hepatomegaly.
