A biopsy of the fundus was done via esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder.
Blood cultures were negative.
Creatinine was increased, and she was diagnosed with acute rejection.
On the night prior to admission she spiked a temperature of 102 and began to have diffuse abdominal pain.
She was sent to an outside hospital ([**Hospital6 33**] Emergency Department) where her creatinine was found to be 1.8 which was increased from 1.5 on discharge.
Urinalysis was bland except for trace blood.
An abdominal CT was done which revealed a small amount of free fluid but was otherwise negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission temperature of 101, blood pressure 144/80, pulse 130, respirations 24, 93% on room air, 97% on 2 liters.
Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Pulmonary was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Dorsalis pedis and radial pulses 2+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission were notable for a white blood cell count of 3, hematocrit of 18.3, platelets of 80.
Blood urea nitrogen was 25, creatinine was 1.9.
Liver function tests were within normal range, as were amylase and lipase.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A CT scan revealed stable masses in the transplant and kidney, consistent with post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder.
A renal biopsy was done which revealed an ischemic change and mild mesangial prominence, minimal interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, diffuse interstitial edema, and a mild diffuse/chronic inflammatory interstitial infiltrate with very rare foci of mild tubulitis.
While there was no overt cellular rejection on the biopsy specimen, there was interstitial edema and significant endothelialitis.
She continued to receive prednisone; however, her creatinine decreased until [**12-13**], and it began to increase.
POST-TRANSPLANTATION LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER:  The patient received her second and third doses of rituximab for this during this hospitalization, and she had a follow-up CT scan which revealed slight improvement.
She had numerous tests checked for possible viral infection including cytomegalovirus, [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus, HHB6, and parvovirus B19 PCR.
She also had neutropenic precautions, and she received 2 units of packed red blood cells on the day of admission because her hematocrit was low in setting of kidney biopsy.
