Absolute neutrophil count fluctuated throughout hospital course, but never rose about 200.
Vancomycin levels have been very elevated and was being dosed by levels.
The blood cultures have remained negative to date.
A chest x-ray did not show any infiltrates.
Urine cultures from [**7-28**] grew 10:100,000 enterococcus with sensitivities pending.
In addition, patient later developed a respiratory infection of unclear etiology as sputum gram stain and cultures were negative.
Her platelets were kept above 50 and her hematocrit above 25.
Although ultimately patient no longer passed melena, her hematocrit and platelets continued to trend downwards, requiring multiple transfusions of platelets daily and at least one unit of packed red blood cells every other day.
Abdominal CT scan without contrast revealed no peritoneal fluid, no free air, and no signs of bowel ischemia.
HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  The patient developed hypotension with mean arterial pressures in the 40s; asymptomatic.
?s blood pressure gradually fell again.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient developed acute renal failure with a creatinine of up to 3.2.
Urine sediment showed muddy brown casts.
The patient continued to be oliguric with improvement in the urine output with a low- dose dopamine drip.
Urine also showed eosinophils - possible acute interstitial nephritis from multiple drugs.
However, as the patient was weaned off of pressors, her urine output and renal function began to fail again, and was no longer restored with restarting dopamine.
?s renal function began to worsen acutely, with creatinine rising from 1.3 to 2.2, but it was felt that given treatment goals decided at this point by patient and family that dialysis was not indicated.
The Dermatology Service was consulted, and a biopsy was consistent with hypersensitivity reaction.
