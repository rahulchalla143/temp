Admission Date:  [**2123-6-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2123-7-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2058-7-31**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year-old male with a known history of three vessel coronary artery disease which was confirmed by cardiac catheterization in [**2123-6-3**] who was referred for coronary artery bypass graft procedure.
The patient first documented catheterization on [**2120-10-23**] which demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease, for which the patient elected to undergo medical therapy only.
Follow-up cardiac catheterization in [**2122-12-4**] demonstrated persistent and advancing coronary artery disease; at this point, the patient again declined bypass surgery, stating that he preferred to wait for the introduction of coated stents.
Repeat cardiac catheterization on [**2123-6-17**] demonstrated once again persistent three vessel coronary artery disease with 60-70% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery at its origin, 40% proximal narrowing in the obtuse marginal, up to 70% stenosis in the midvessel portion of the right coronary artery.
Calculated ejection fraction was noted to be 40%.
The patient's pericardium was left open; lines placed included an arterial line and a Swan-Ganz catheter; both ventricular and atrial wires were placed; both mediastinal and left pleural tubes were placed.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, intubated, for further evaluation and management.
On transfer, the patient's mean arterial pressure was 85, P80 18, [**Doctor First Name 1052**] 25.
The patient was noted to be in normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute.
While in the CSRU, the patient was noted to demonstrate progressively diminishing platelet counts, after which all heparin products were ceased and the patient was sent for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody screen which subsequently proved negative.
On postoperative day number four, the patient was noted to demonstrate a gradual dip in his hematocrit to 22.7, for which he received 1 unit of packed red blood cells which was irradiated and rendered leukopoor.
The patient subsequently demonstrated an adequate bump in his hematocrit and demonstrated no evidence of active bleeding.
