IMAGING: [**2184-3-6**] CT  Multidetector CT imaging of the chest was performed without intravenous contrast.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The major airways are patent to subsegmental levels bilaterally.
This study is not tailored for evaluation of the subdiaphragmatic organs, within this limitation, imaged portion of the liver and spleen are unremarkable.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2184-3-11**] at 11:32:35 AM      FINAL  GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2184-3-11**] 5:14 AM FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2184-3-11**] 2:52 PM Right internal jugular line is in place with its tip at the level of mid SVC.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2184-3-14**] 5:25 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-12**], there is little overall change.
Pt was initially admitted to the medical service for evaluation and treatment of her anemia which was presumably due to microscopic/macroscopic hematuria.
She was seen by urology for evaluation for suspected bladder cancer.
She underwent a cystoscopy which showed bladder masses that were biopsied.
She had no pulse during this arrest and a Code blue was called for PEA arrest with return of pulse after 2 cycles chest compressions and 1mg epi x2 and 1amp bicarb.
CXR in the unit showed white out of the entire right lung suggesting layering of her known pleural effusion (likely malignancy related, see below).
CXR also suggested some new widening of the mediastinum.
She did not exhibit much neurologic function; would respond to painful stimuli but no other responses.
EKG showed Right axis deviation.
Out of c/f PE heparin was started empirically.
