Axial images at T11-12, [**1-3**], [**2-3**], and [**3-7**] demonstrate mild degenerative disc disease with no evidence of canal or foraminal encroachment.
[**10-25**] CT head: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction.
[**10-25**] MRI/MRA of the head: MRI OF THE HEAD: IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of acute ischemic changes.
After the administration of gadolinium contrast, there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement.

The patient was rehydrated with IVF, continued on his florief and salt tabs, kept with his HOB > 30, and dressed with compression stockings.
He continued to have orthostatic blood pressure changes, with SBP falling from ~160 supine to ~100 standing, but he was  asymptomatic and these were stable findings.
Because [**Month/Year (2) **] dysfunction in the setting of MM may be caused by amyloidosis, a bone marrow biopsy was done on [**10-23**] which showed did not show evidence of amyloidosis.
He was brought to bed and a supine blood pressure was systolic 90.
For his hypotension, he was given 500cc of NS, SBP improved to 120, and his aphasia resolved.
Thereafter his SBP dropped to 110 and his aphasia returned.
MRI and CT head without evidence of acute stroke.
Carotid ultrasound showed no significant stenosis.
His blood pressure was  80/60.
He recieved a 500cc bolus with moderate improvement in his blood pressure to 115/65.
PTT from the morning was noted to be 55 and so a stat head CT was obtained which was normal.
On discharge, the patient continued to have orthostatic blood pressure changes, with SBP falling from ~160 supine to ~100 standing, but he was asymptomatic and these were stable findings.
Due to his increasing urinary retension, a MRI of his L-spine was done which showed multiple signal abnormalities in the bones, but no cord compression.
Your supine blood pressures are elevated on the midodrine in order to keep your standing blood pressures at a safe level.
