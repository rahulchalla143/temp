Bilateral perinephric and left periureteral soft tissue lesions are not well assessed on the present study and were fully described on recent MR [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**2137-11-15**].
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-11-21**], there is interventricular septal flattening consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-1-1**], the estimated PASP has increased slightly.
Subsequent blood cultures grew enterobacter and urine grew VRE.
Both sputum and urine grew yeast, later speciated as [**Female First Name (un) **] parapsilosis.
In the final days before he died, he had increasing requirements on the ventillator to maintain his sats, and chest xrays showed new infiltrates that were likely due to ongoing aspiration events.
# Renal failure:  found to be in acute renal failure, with creatinine continuing to trend up.
His liver enzymes began to rise slightly as septic shock set in, and his labs showed evidence of liver failure with decreased synthetic function (namely, an elevated INR).
