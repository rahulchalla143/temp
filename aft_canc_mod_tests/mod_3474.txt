CXR showed ?new LLL opacity.
Labs revealed ARF (k= 6.0 -> given calcium, insulin, glucose, kayexalate, no acute EKG changes).
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for HD.
En route SBP dropped (no documentation of SBPs), and pt was started on dopa gtt.
SBP down to 78/38 in ED.
- baseline HCT [**8-11**] WBC=4500, HCT 30, PLT 327, HgB 9.9.
- baseline creatinine 1.1 [**7-13**], 1.1 [**8-13**], [**7-27**] 1.38.
CT head: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
MRI with gadolinium is more sensitive in the evaluation for metastases.
Ultrasound: FINDINGS: Portable bedside evaluation was performed with limitations secondary to patient respirations.
CT abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Peripancreatic fat stranding which may be related to anasarca given the patient's recent normal lipase value.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
CT chest: 1.
Given the history the suspicion for malignant pleural invasion is high, especially given thick nodular soft tissue enhancement within the pleural effusions on the prior abdomen CT (not evaluated today due to absence of contrast).
CXR [**8-28**]: New bilateral perihilar opacities extending towards the lower lobes representing new pulmonary edema.
CT abd/PELVIS was negative for retroperitoneal bleed.
TTE was negative for tamponade, grossly normal EF, ?RV dilation.
Given concern for GI bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and ARF, as well as rapidly improving O2 status, PE was felt less likely, and heparin gtt was not started.
repeat CXR on HD#3 showed ?increasing pulmonary edema (felt unlikley given clinical improvement), however was concerning for new consolidations.
A CT CHEST was ordered to further evaluate, as given neutropenia she was felt susceptible for atypical infections (ie fungal).
All culture data was negative.
# Afebrile neutropenia: For neutropenia, pt empirically started on cefepime and vancomycin on [**8-23**] for 7 day course, and blood, urine, sputum cultures were negative.
Given unclear etiology of hypotension, cardiac enzymes were checked but were negative x3.
# ARF: Reportedly normal kidney function at baseline, presented with Cr 4.0.
Respiratory compensation was appropriate for metabolic acidosis felt [**1-9**] ARF.
# mental status changes -  pt midly confused on admission (A&Ox2), sluggish, and flapping.
most likely felt [**1-9**] uremia vs infection, however CT HEAD obtained to r/o intracranial bleed given thrombocytopenia, and conjunctival hemhorages concerning for bleeding.
Heme/onc consult assessed peripheral smear as negative for DIC or TTP.
DIC labs were followed q8h and felt unremarkable in setting of onc diagnosis.
Platelets were maintained initially at goal >50 for concern for bleeding, however given that her hct was found to be at her baseline, transfusion threshold was changed to 20.
# Elevated LFTs - tbil mildly elevated 2.6, pt s/p cholecystectomy however, though felt she could still have CBD stone, CT ABD/PELVIS [**Location (un) 1131**] negative for significant hydro, CBD dilation.
initial elevation of LFTs/TBIL thus felt more likely [**1-9**] chemo and shock liver, and started trending down slowly by HD#3.
INR was stable 1.2-1.3, suggesting intact liver function.
pt with ongoing n/v likely [**1-9**] chemo, however CT abd/pelvis did show ?peripancreatic stranding.
plan made to follow pt clinically, and obtain repeat imaging if she developed abdominal pain.
abdominal xray ruled out obstruction, and n/v attributed most likely to chemo.
also with diarrhea, stool sent for cdiff (though has h/o pelvic radiation).
