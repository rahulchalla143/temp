She denies any falls or head trauma during this period,however,head CT obtained at an outside hospital reveals left frontal parietal chronic subdural hematoma approximately 1.7cm in thickness with 1.2cm midline shift.
HEENT:Cerebral flap w/xeroform and gauze, depressed cranium Pupils: [**4-9**] bilaterally Neck: Supple.
An origin from the epidermis is not identified nor is there definitive morphologic evidence of squamous differentiation.
A large subpopulation of tumor cells are immunoreactive for cytokeratins as pankeratins (AE1/AE3/CAM 5.2), MNF 116 and focally for cytokeratin [**6-13**] and EMA, and to show strong nuclear reactivity for p63.
They are non-reactive for the melanocytic markers S-100, Mart-1, HMB-45, cytokeratins -7 and -20, CD79, CD34, Factor VIII, TTF-1 or the estrogen receptor.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2174-1-18**] 11:09 AM  Reason: f/u study  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 85 year old woman with s/p bifrontal craniectomy, in sicu REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: f/u study INDICATION: Status post bifrontal craniectomy, in CICU; assess interval change.
IMPRESSION: Essentially unchanged head CT from [**2174-1-16**].
Air-fluid levels are again seen in the sphenoid sinuses.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: FINDINGS: Ultrasound evaluation of the right and left lower extremity deep venous system using grayscale, color, and pulse wave Doppler reveals the veins to be fully compressible with normal color flow, Doppler waveforms, augmentation, and respiratory variation in flow.
Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
She self d/c'd NGT on [**1-1**]; she passed bedside swallow evaluation on [**1-2**] and her PO diet was resumed.
Repeat Head CT showed left frontal infarct/increasing SDH with increased midline shift.
Repeat CTH [**1-16**] with slight worse L SDH, and stable on CTH [**1-18**].
Discharge Instructions: -Pt may have [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drain pulled out when output<30cc/hr.
-Cranial dressing - may leave on Xeroform and change gauze dressing as needed -comfort measures as ordered by rehab.
