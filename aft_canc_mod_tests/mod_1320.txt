The patient reports that his CP is associated with stretching and positional changes.
A CT was done that showed a large pericardial effusion with signs of tamponade.
Cardiology was called and an ECHO was done which showed a new localized pericardial effusion with RA collapse and a small RV.
A pulsus on exam was 12.
The CT also showed worsening metastatic disease.

Following pericardiocentesis, he was found to have a pulsus of <10 (20 prior to procedure) and improved cardiac output to 5 (from 3.8).
His lovenox was initially held during the first day of admission, however a repeat echo demonstrated resolution of pericardial effusion and thus his lovenox was restarted.
His repeat [**Month/Day/Year 461**] showed the resolution of tamponade physiology and a very small pericardial effusion.
PET scan on [**2195-7-29**] showed marked uptake within supraclavicular pretracheal and precarinal mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well as minimal FDG uptake in the distal esophagus.
