Repeat TTE after removal of drain showed no further accumulation of pericardial fluid.
Gram Stain initially showed GPCs but lab later clarified that this may have been misread and may be debris; culture results negative to date, but patient had been on augmentin for pneumonia prior to pericardial fluid cultures, so 16S PCR was sent from pericardial fluid and is still pending.
Mycoplasma IgG and IgM were also sent and pending.
TRANSITIONS OF CARE: - Found to have ASD secundum on TTE; Needs Repeat TTE in 1 week to re-evaluate for pericardial effusion and to confirm ASD - PPD needs to be read on [**6-3**] - pending labs 16S PCR or pericardial fluid, mycoplasma IgG/IgM - start metformin as outpatient (PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 4939**])  Medications on Admission: Discharge Medications from [**5-27**]: - amlodipine-benazepril 5-10 mg PO daily - venlafaxine 37.5 mg PO DAILY - aspirin 81 mg Daily - albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation 2 puffs IH QID:PRN - omeprazole 20 mg Daily - Colace 100 mg PO twice a day.
An echocardiogram should be rechecked at your cardiologist's office in 1 week to make sure the fluid has not reaccumulated.
Your liver function tests were elevated because of your heart function but are not improving.
