On the wards, pt found to have UTI (though UA notable only for [**3-16**] RBC & postive nitrites, only 0-2WBC).
Urine cx grew pansensitive Klebsiella & Stenotrophomonas sensitive to Bactrim.
Her SBP trended down from 90s-110s to 80s which was initially responsive to IVF and then unresponsive.
In the MICU, blood cultures from [**6-12**] grew out pansensitive enterococcus as did her PICC tip.
EKG showed new TWI in inferior and precordial leads.
CEs showed elevation w/ TnT peak of 0.15 (on [**6-15**], and [**6-16**]) as well as CK peak of 204 ([**6-14**]) and MB of 17 ([**6-14**]).
Received 1 unit PRBCs on [**6-15**] for Hct 21 w/ guiaic positive stools.
CT head was negative for bleed.
Carotid u/s negative for stenosis.
MRI has not yet been obtained.
Also attempted to increase beta blocker but systolic BPs dropped to 90s which returned to the 100s with IVF.
# CHF: EF <20% on TTE [**6-15**] with HK and akinetic walls.
However, this was presumed necessary to augment her cardiac output given her poor stroke volume so there was no increase in her beta blocker dose made.
CT head and carotids negative.
MRI showed R frontal lobe punctate lesions the chronicity of which could not be determined.
Her facial droop slowly improved over the course of admission and her Neuro exam otherwise remained unchanged.
Neuro exam was unchanged except for facial droop as above and there were no other significant changes noted on MRI.
