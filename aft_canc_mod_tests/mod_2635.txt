Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 **] the pt was tachy to the 120s, tachypneic to 30, and satting at 96 on 4L nC.
ABG was 7.41/32/81.
The pt had a lactate of 4.2, WBC count greater than 40,000 and new ST-T wave changes (flattened T waves) in V3-V5 when compared to prior EKG.
The pt was also documented to have a troponin peak of 0.22.
The pt was initially empirically started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for suspected urosepsis, but his UA was negative and his urine culture on [**7-29**] grew out ampicillin resistant enterococcus.
Zosyn was discontinued and the Vancomycin (started [**7-31**]) is to be completed for a 2 week course after discharge.
CT angiogram on [**7-30**] ruled out pulmonary embolism and heparin gtt was discontinued at this time.
TTE on [**7-31**] revealed a normal EF, making CHF an unlikely cause of the pts symptoms.

His WBC dropped from [**Numeric Identifier 17451**] on admission to as low as 200 with an ANC of 70, and the pt was placed on neutropenic precautions.
