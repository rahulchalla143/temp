In ED afebrile, BP initially 99/60, dropped to 79/50, improved to 106/70 with 2L NS bolus.
Patient CXR was consitent with pulmonary edema.
She uderwent CTA chest in the ED which showed multiple segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the bilateral lower lobes and patient was started on IV heparin and admitted to the ICU.
Cortisol was sent in the ED.
ROS: Denies any HA, chest pain, currently no SOB, denies any abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: Hypertension S/P hysterectomy Iron deficiency anemia Basal cell carcinomas (largest on scalp; patient refuses to have treated per PCP) Recent MI [**12-18**] medically managed CHF most recent echo with LVEF 40% Critical AS: Peak velocity 4.0 and valve area of 0.5 Rectal mass (no workup)   Social History: Pt previously lived alone but most recently from rehab.

CHEST CT: 1.
Differential considerations include neoplastic, infectious, and inflammatory etiologies.
Followup with chest CT in [**2-20**] months time after acute symptoms resolve would be standard.
Furhter evaluation with ultrasound may be pursued if indicated.
ECG: Sinus rhythm Atrial premature complex Left anterior fascicular block Probable left ventricular hypertrophy Delayed R wave progression - may be left ventricular hypertrophy or possible prior anterior myocardial infarction ST-T wave abnormalities - could be left ventricular hypertrophy Clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2119-1-15**], no significant change   Brief Hospital Course: 1) Hypoxia: The patient has multiple subsegmental PEs seen on CTA last night.
In addition, chest CT showed multiple pulmonary nodules which had a broad ddx.
Although malignancy is possible, since pt does not want any further workup, this can be followed with serial imaging in [**2-14**] months.
Other etiology of hypotension could be from PE but this is unlikely given patient does not appear to have large central PE on CT scan.
Cortisol levels normal so unlikely to be adrenally insufficient.
On this admission, sodium improved with IVF so likely hypovolemic component.
Also patient with CHF and LVEF of 40%.
ACE-I held as was hyperkalemic but will need to be restarted in next several days if BP remains stable and hyperkalemia resovles.
