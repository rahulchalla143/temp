In the Emergency Department, he was normotensive, afebrile, and his oxygen saturations were in the mid-90's on 4L nasal cannula.
He was transfered to the Intensive care unit for further care given that he appeared septic since he was initially hypotensive with an elevated lactate.
In [**Month (only) 956**] [**2176**], he noted the gradual increase of his right neck mass, which showed follicular lymphoma on biopsy.
He was notd to have cervical spine involvement of imaging and was place in a soft cervical collar.
He underwent 2 cycles of [**Hospital1 **] salvage chemotherapy in [**7-4**] and [**8-4**].
Physical Exam: Vitals: Temperature:98.4 Pulse:100 Blood Pressure:125/70 Respiratory Rate:20 Oxygen Saturation:96% on 15L Non-rebreather.
Sensation symmetric to light touch bilaterally.

Sputum (induced) 4+ yeast with pseudohypae Blood Culture ([**9-27**]) no growth Urine Culture ([**9-27**]) no growth .
Urinalysis:small blood, trace protein, trace ketones, 0-2 RBC, 0-2 WBC, few bacteria, [**2-1**] epithelial cells.
Pneumonia: On chest x-ray, he had evidence of pneumonia.
On hospital day 3, his oxygen requirement increased and he spiked a temperature; therefore, his antibiotic coverage was broadened to include Flagyl, Caspofungin, and Bactrim.
An induced sputum showed budding yeast and was negative for PCP.
His lactate trended down with fluids and he remained normotensive.
Lymphoma: He recently underwent a cycle of [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy 2 weeks prior to admission.
Until a cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine MRI was negative for compression, he was maintained on high dose dexamethasone.
He will need his third cycle of [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy once he has recovered from his pneumonia.
Acute renal failure: On admission, his BUN and creatinine were elevated.
His creatinine returned to baseline with fluid resuscitation.
Anemia: On admission, his hematocrit was near baseline of 27-30.
His iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease and his B12 and folate were normal.
His hematocrit dropped to 18 on hospital day 1, which was likely secondary to dilution from fluid resuscitation.
His electrolytes were repleted.
