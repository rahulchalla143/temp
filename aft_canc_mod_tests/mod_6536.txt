The esophagus measures 13.5 cm in length and 1.3 cm in average diameter.
COMPARISON: No previous exam for comparison.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
A preprocedure timeout was performed using three patient identifiers.
The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the abdomen was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.
An Amplatz wire secured this site and provides stiffness for dilation of the tract.
ANESTHESIA: The patient was continually monitored by radiological nursing staff and 100 mcg fentanyl was administered for patient comfort.
Total intraservice time was 40 minutes.
IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound and fluoroscopic-guided placement of 12 french jejunostomy tube.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Nonvisualization of the left kidney, as noted on prior PET/CT from [**12-19**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Correlation is made to a prior abdominal ultrasound dated [**2147-5-25**] as well as a prior PET scan dated [**2147-1-10**].
The lack of IV contrast limits the evaluation of the solid parenchymal organs.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The bladder is partially distended and contains air, likely from prior catheterization.
If there is a clinical suspicion for anastomotic leak, a fluoroscopic study is recommended with water-soluble contrast.
This study was performed with Gastrografin injection into the J-tube per the referring team's request.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

A physical exam was performed.
His urine output was low and unresponsive to significant fluid bolus.
He was begun on vasopressin, low dose drip, which imptoved his renal perfusion and his urine output increased.
By POD 2 he became more agitated and he was cared for on a CIWA scale as he had a significant alcohol history.
He required a large amount of oxygen to keep his saturation up.
TPN was started on POD 8 and he had an ECHO which was unremarkable.
His creatinine improved significantly by [**6-8**] with hydration.
His atrial fibrillation responded well however given his distension he underwent a CT torso which showed a significant amount of ascited.
Given continued output from his JP drain each time he had a small amount of retching, it was assumed that he had a leak in his esophageal anastamosis, despite a drain study in radiology that had indicated otherwise.
His JP was progressively pulled back and ultimately d/c'ed on [**7-1**].
