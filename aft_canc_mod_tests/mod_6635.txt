He had an EGD on [**11-14**], which revealed a posterior dudodenal [**Month/Year (2) **] with visible vessel and active bleeding that was secured with clip, BiCap cautery, and epinephrine injection.
Presumably, he was transfused again on [**11-14**] to a Hgb of 10 that had fell to 8.6 today on [**11-17**].

He reported he felt well but was frustrated with the continued issues relating to this bleed and was asymptomatic with a HCT of 33.6 decreased to 28.5 this am.

Most recent EGD revealed discrete duodenal ulcers with visible vessel and persistent bleeding as well as oozing gastritis.
An endoscopy on [**2131-11-19**] showed a 25mm duodenal [**Date Range **] with visible vessels and this was clipped and cauterized.
The patient continued however to have melanotic stools and required additional blood transfusions although his vital signs were stable and he was asymptomatic throughout.
A repeat endoscopy on [**2131-11-23**]  showed active bleeding with blood clots at the previously clipped single bleeding [**Date Range **] in the pylorus channel.
His prednisone which he was taking for his pulmonary disease were tapered back to his baseline 10mg daily.
On [**2131-11-24**], the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, ligation of duodenal [**Date Range **] with biopsy, vagotomy and J-tube placement.
Because of his GI bleed,  he was initially started on lower doses of his beta blocker, however he did not achieve good rate control on  these lower doses, and so he resumed his home dose of metoprolol with effect.
Vital signs were routinely monitored.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required postoperatively.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet and tube feeds, ambulating, voiding with assistance, and pain was well controlled.
