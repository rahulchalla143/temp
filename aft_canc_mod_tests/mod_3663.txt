Vital signs were stable on arrival to the ED.
CTA was done and showed consolidation of middle lobe and suspicious lymph node in area of pulmonary artery bifurcation and bronchial tree.
Rigid bronch showed massive bleeding from left lower lobe.
Diagnosed [**12-7**] when presented with cough and noted on CT to have Left hilar mass and right renal mass as well as RP lymophadenopathy.
Bone scan and brain MRI were negative.
Colonscopy approx [**2179**] s/p polypectomy 7.

4) Unchanged disease status from the CT torso 5 days prior.
CXR [**2185-4-30**]: No evidence of pneumonia, pleural effusions, or hemothorax.
CXR [**2185-5-6**]: Persistent left lower lobe patchy opacity with small effusion, which may represent pneumonia in this patient with fever.
On [**5-1**], he underwent another bronchoscopy which revealed old blood clot and endobronchial mass in the superior segment of LLL.
Interventional radiology concluded that the endobronchial lesion seen on CT is unlikely the source of the bleed and therefore another rigid/flexible bronchoscopy was performed [**5-5**] for Argon coagulation of endobronchial lesion in left superior lingular segment.
His blood culture, urine culture, and sputum collected at that time were unreveling.
CXR was read as patchy LLL opacity with small pleural effusion for which pneumonia was in the differential.
Please call your doctor or return to emergency room for evaluation immediately if you start coughing blood, have fever, shotness of breath, or other concerning symtoms.
