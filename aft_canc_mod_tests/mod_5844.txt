There are associated air-fluid levels noted in the small bowel.
There is slight increase distention from supine portable radiograph from [**2154-7-9**].
An NG tube was placed for gastrointestinal decompression, which was later removed.
Gynecology was consulted after pelvic matter was seen in the vaginal on CT. She declined an exam in the hospital and it was felt that outpatient follow up with her regular gynecologist would be appropriate to further evaluate the bleeding and pelvic matter on imaging.
