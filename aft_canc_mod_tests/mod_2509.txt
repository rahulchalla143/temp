FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2140-7-31**]):    NO GROWTH.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
[**2140-7-28**] Non-contrast head CT: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or large acute territorial infarction.
[**2140-7-28**] CXR (AP portable): AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position.
Comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of [**2140-7-13**].
Similar findings consistent with chronic CHF and bilateral pleural effusion was already present on the previous chest examination of [**2140-7-13**].
There are a few subcortical foci of height and signal predominantly in the parietal and occipital lobes, which may be seen in the setting of PRES.
Brief Hospital Course: 59M with a PMH of T2DM on insulin, ESRD just started on PD [**2140-7-28**], HTN, HLD, CAD s/p 4 stents in [**2136**], CML, transferred from OSH with altered mental status, seizures and hypertensive emergency.
His carvedilol increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] but then decreased to 9.75mg [**Hospital1 **] due to asymptomatic bradycardia.
At the time of discharge his blood pressures were well-controled on carvedilol, lisinopril, amlodipine and furosemide.
MRI concerning for PRES, but head CT negative.
Corrected calcium was 10.9 on admission which decreased to 10.0 by the next morning and then remained within normal limits.
His calcitonin and calcium carbonate supplements were stopped.
After calcium normalized, Renal team advised that it was safe to restart calcium supplements.
# Patient will have repeat MRI in 3 weeks to evaluate for resolution of PRES.
Information was obtained from webOMR.
Doxazosin 4 mg PO HS Hold for SBP <100 6.
A CT scan of your head showed that you had no bleeding in your brain.
An MRI of your brain showed that your seizures may have been related to the high blood pressures.
Additionally, you should have a follow-up MRI of your brain in three weeks.
