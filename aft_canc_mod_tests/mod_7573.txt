He has undergone multiple brushings and biopsies of this lesion, which were all consistent with a benign stricture.
He was doing well until he was seen at the [**Hospital 8**] Hospital by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2161**] and [**Last Name (STitle) 1834**] a CT scan, which demonstrated what appeared to be metastasis in the right lobe of the liver.

CTA was performed on [**2186-3-27**] and was negative for pulmonary embolus, but did show a subdiaphragmatic fluid collection.
Cardiac echo was performed [**2186-4-10**] which revealed normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved regional and hyperdynamic global biventricular systolic function.
He continued to have a dropping hematocrit on [**4-14**] and  returned to to OR on [**4-14**] for abdominal washout, however no source of bleeding was determined.
Pleural fluid culture isolated pan sensitive E.coli.
CXR demonstrated apical pneumothorax.
TPA instillation was attempted, however, pigtail catheter became dislodge.
Culture of this fluid demonstrated 4+PMN, but was negative for microorganisms.
After review of CXRs , no further intervention was recommended as the thoracic surgery service thought the effusion was most likely reactive from the subdiaphragmatic collection.
He was weaned off oxygen and O2 saturations were greater than 93%.
CXR on [**5-29**] showed slightly decreased loculated right pleural effusion since the prior study still involving the major fissure and still with multiple air-fluid levels consistent with air loculations.
Creatinine remained stable at ~1.0.
While on Lasix drip, urine output remained excellent 100-400 cc/hr with urine output of >4-6L/day.
Blood cultures returned on [**4-7**] positive for Prevotella species, but surveillance cultures remained negative since this blood culture.
PICC line culture was negative.
LFTs slowly improved with values approaching normal limits with the exception of alk phos which remained in the low to mid 200s.
He continued to have anemia with stable hematocrit of 25.
Rehab screen was done per case management and [**Hospital3 **] in [**Hospital1 8**] offered a bed on [**6-1**].
