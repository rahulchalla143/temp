The course thereafter is not entirely clear, however, he presented to OSH again in [**8-22**] with septic left joint at which time he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and repeat arthrocentesis was performed with fluid showing 406,000 WBC with 91% PMNs.
Cultures at that time revealed joint fluid with MSSA but tissue with MRSA.
His UOP was 100cc throughout the entire case despite the above fluids.
Preop hct was 31.1 and was 31.6 postop after the 6 units prbcs.
?F) HR: 85 (62 - 87) bpm BP: 106/44(60) {70/30(50) - 141/50(74)} mmHg RR: 17 (0 - 20) insp/min  GEN: Intubated, sedated, intermittently diaphoretic.

[**10-31**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study of earlier in the day, left ventricular systolic function is improved.
His UOP was 100cc throughout the entire case despite the above fluids.
Preop hct was 31.1 and was 31.6 postop after the 6 units pRBC.
The patient's blood pressures were maintained on levophed and neo.
Pt WBC count continued to rise post-op and on [**10-31**] reached 48.8 with a lactate of 6.5.
Received 6 units prbcs with hct remaining essentially stable at 31 (no bump).
CXR essentially clear so no clear underlying pulmonary process (beyond ?
Echo in [**8-22**] showed preserved EF.
Off coumadin prior to OR with preop INR of 1.4.
