Past Medical History: - Stage IIIC poorly differentiated primary peritoneal serous carcinoma - Thalassemia - Hypertension (per patient never treated with home medication, only when in hospital or seeing doctors) - Gastritis/Reflux  Oncologic history - CT abd/pelvis on [**2182-2-28**] revealed a large mass centered in the sigmoid colon with pelvic lymphadenopathy, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and peritoneal carcinomatosis.
- A colonoscopy revealed a fungating, ulcerated mass within the sigmoid colon causing a partial obstruction.
The biopsy of this mass revealed adenocarcinoma with papillary formation, suggestive of an ovarian primary.
- [**2182-3-14**] underwent exploratory laparotomy, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, rectosigmoid resection with colorectal re anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy.
Pathology examination revealed serous carcinoma involving full thickness of the rectal wall.
Uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and ovaries were negative for malignancy.
- [**Date range (3) 88205**]: 5 cycles of chemotherapy with Carboplatin q21 days and weekly Taxol, [**2182-8-15**] 6th cycle of chemotherapy with Carboplatin and Taxotere in place of Taxol due to neurotoxicity - [**2183-7-12**]: MRI of the L-spine shows new retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy consistent with disease recurrence.
- [**2183-8-11**] started chemotherapy according to the clinical trial [**Company 2860**] #11-228 (Phase II, multi-center, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized study of ombrabulin in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer treated with Carboplatin/Paclitaxel)   Social History: Immigrated from [**Country 3587**] in youth.

CT torso on [**7-24**] documented disease recurrence.
Restaging CT torso performed on [**10-11**] showed no new lesions, but there is mild interval enlargement of right retroperitoneal lymph nodes and left external iliac chain lymph node which could reflect progression of metastatic disease.
QTc was monitored while receiving high doses of ondansetron and remained within normal limits.
