Head CT showed 4 mm leftward midline shift and a right insular intraparenchymal hemorrhage (later found to be old) and due to concern for these CT findings he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**].
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he underwent repeat head CT which was unchanged and chest X-ray showed atelectasis but could not rule out pneyumonia.
He had no further seizures and has passed [**Last Name (un) 8692**] Speech and Swallow evaluation on [**2103-2-6**] a.m.
[**Name (NI) **] triggered on [**2103-2-6**] when he desaturated to 80% on 4L and had worsening problems regarding [**Name2 (NI) 84003**] thick secretions improving with vigorous suctioning and chest PT and regular nebulizers.
Chest X-ray was relatively unchanged and indeed has been pretty unimpressive sice admission with certainly no florid consolidation to be seen.
On review post-extubation on the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission vitals were temperature 98.2 F, pulse 89, blood pressure 117/90, respiration 24, and O2 saturation at 96% on 6L O2.
On review he was on 4L O2 via NC and a shovel mask at 40% maintaining sats at 93%.

Physical Exam: Admission exam: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.4 F, blood pressure 120/77, pulse 87, respiration 20, and oxygen saturation 96% with 4L via nasal cannula.
no JVD but exam limited by pt habitus.

[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Examination: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.2 F, pulse 89, blood pressure 117/90, respiration 24, and oxygen saturation 96% on 6L of O2.
His muscle strengths are [**5-17**] at all muscle groups, except for proximal lower extremity weakness at 4+/5 strength on both side.
His reflexes are 2- bilaterally.
Sensory examination is intact to touch and proprioception.
Coordination examination does not reveal dysmetria.
DISCHARGE EXAM VITAL SIGNS:  Tm/Tc 97.5 F/97.5 F, blood pressure 122/90 (115-128)/(80-95), pulse 75 (20-88), repsiration 18-22, and oxygen saturation 93% 2L NC GENERAL:  Sleeping but easily arousable, NAD, breathing appears more comfortably SKIN:  Portacath intact without signs of infection; some bruising, skin irriation on legs from pneumoboots HEENT:  PERRLA.
no JVD but exam limited by pt habitus.
PULMONARY:  Examination limited by pt ability to comply.
His reflexes are absent, including the ankle jerks.
Sensory examination is intact to touch and proprioception.
Coordination examination does not reveal gross dysmetria.

Hyperdensity in the right insular region compatible with intraparenchymal hematoma is similar to the prior examination and demonstrates interval evolution of blood products from the examination of [**2103-1-25**].
Overall stable examination with interval evolution of blood products in the right insula and temporal lobe.
A right-sided port is in place with tip obscured on this radiograph.
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2103-2-6**] 10:10 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-5**], there are lower lung volumes.
XR HIP 1 VIEW	Study Date of [**2103-2-6**] 5:27 PM Single AP view of the pelvis and single view of the right hip were obtained.
XR PELVIS (AP ONLY)	Study Date of [**2103-2-6**] 5:27 PM Single AP view of the pelvis and single view of the right hip were obtained.
XR KNEE (2 VIEWS) RIGHT PORT	Study Date of [**2103-2-6**] 5:29 PM AP and lateral bedside images of the right knee show minimal osteophytic changes in all three compartments.
The decision was made for pt to undergo therapuetic and diagnostic bronchoscopy which was performed in the ICU with intubation and was quickly extubated.
Respiratory status was monitored and pt was stablized and able to return to the regular oncology floor.
BAL was sent for Gram stain, culture, fungal culture, AFB (possible concern for non-tuberculos mycobacteria); infectious workup has been negative to date (sample contaminated).
His O2 sat has remained in the high 90's on 4L NC, and his breathing is comfortable.
EEG was planned but because of logistical planning issues, it was not performed.
The decision was made to take you to the intensive care unit were a therapuetic and diagnostic bronchoscopy could be performed to help clear the secretions and determine if there was any other infectious process impacting your breathing.
