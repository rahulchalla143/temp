A CXR was obtained which showed a new moderate right pleural effusion.
Per report, an EKG was unremarkable from clinic.
The patient was admitted for further workup of this new pleural effusion and bilateral ankle swelling.
Given the progression of symptoms and counts a bone marrow biopsy was performed which demonstrated a monoclonal B cell population consistent with a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.

Comparison to echo of [**2120-1-24**], the right ventricle appears smaller and there is probable tamponade physiology.
Wall motion abnormalities could not be compared as the current study was limited.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-29**], the patient is no longer tachycardic.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

There was initially some concern for tamponade given that his BP had decreased from 150s systolic to the 100s.
A repeat TTE was obtained on HD6 ([**2120-1-29**]) which showed increased concern for tamponade physiology, however the effusion was too small for a pericardiocentesis.
A repeat TTE was obtained on HD7 which showed no tamponade physiology.
BP remained stable in CCU and when transferred back to floor.
Right pleural effusion: Unilateral pleural effusion on exam and CXR.
CXR otherwise clear, and he had no signs/symptoms of pneumonia (no fever, cough, leukocytosis).
ECG with no evidence of ischemia or right heart strain.
Albumin normal and UA showed no protein, suggesting that hepatic or renal source was less likely than cardiac etiology.
Echo showed pericardial effusion as well.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] attempted to obtain an EEG during this admission per outpatient provider request but was unable to be done.

We repeated an echocardiogram and your heart function was improved.
