The patient did undergo a cardiac echocardiogram which did not show evidence of CHF as the etiology of this.
The patient continues to have some dyspnea on exertion which is worsening and chest CT which was obtained to evaluate this showed a loculated right effusion.
He presents for evaluation of the etiology of this by lung biopsy and possible decortication.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient is 5' 8" tall and his weight is 175 pounds.
Vital signs:  Temperature 95.2, pulse 86 and regular, sinus rhythm, respiratory rate 20, SP02 97% on room air, otherwise blood pressure 155/76.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On the date of admission, the patient's white count was 6.5 with a hematocrit of 33.4, platelet count 203,000.
His admitting potassium was 4.0 with a BUN and creatinine of 33 and 1.3.
Cardiology had the patient undergo MI protocol and serial enzymes were obtained which did not evidence an acute ischemic event.
He also underwent an ETT-MIBI the next day which was performed and did not show any evidence of ventricular wall abnormality or ischemia and subsequently Cardiology cleared this patient for surgery.
It was noted that the patient subsequently went into a third-degree AV block and blood pressure returned to a rebound hypertension which required redosing of nitroglycerin.
The patient continued to remain in a heart block and bradycardiac and, therefore, transcutaneous pacing was initiated to which the patient did respond.
V pace was placed and the patient was V paced at 90 beats per minute and remained stable.
He did have an intraoperative TEE to guide the treatment which showed an EF of 40-45% with question of dyskinesis of the septum and anterior septal walls which was difficult to determine if it was related to previous cardiac surgery.
Notably, the overall time for CPR was 2-3 minutes.
When the patient arrived to the CSRU, he was in normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 120/70.
While in the CSRU, the patient continued with temporary pacing wires pending further evaluation by the Electrophysiology Service.
At the time of discharge, his hematocrit was 27.1 with a white count of 5.3 and platelet count of 255,000.
His potassium was 4.4 with a BUN and creatinine of 24 and 1.4.
Blood cultures remained negative throughout the course of his hospitalization.
The patient's chest x-ray showed some bilateral pleural effusions but these were described as small to moderate and noted to be improved.
