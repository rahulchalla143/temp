PROCEDURE:  Revision decompression of the lumbar spine from L2-L3 to L5-S1.
URINE OUTPUT:  450 cc.
SPECIMENS:  Both bone and soft tissue were sent for both pathology and microbiology.
A CT myelogram was performed as he could not have an MRI because of a pacemaker.
CT myelogram showed cutoff at the L3 level.
Due to the severity of the clinical findings as well as the CT myelogram it was felt that this was adequate although not optimal.
His lumbar spine was prepped and draped sterilely in the usual fashion.
This was taken down to known tissue and what was thought to be the L2 spinous process based on his CT scan.
The paraspinal muscles were dissected off the L2 spinous process.
A lateral radiograph confirmed the levels.
On the left side there appeared to be no bone laterally that could be stripped of soft tissue as was consistent with the CT scan.
Significant ligamentum flavum and hypertrophic ligamentum flavum had been removed at the L3-L4 level.
The discs and ventral dural sack could be examined at the L3-4 level to some degree.
URINE OUTPUT:  580 cc.
One specimen was sent to Pathology which was deep tissue.
A dural tear that was the size of approximately a 20     gauge needle tip on the right side at the level of the     inferior aspect of the L2 lamina as predicted on CT     based on CT myelogram.
Blood cultures grew out gram-negative rods.
The a spiral chest CT was negative.
Chest x-ray was negative.
CT of the head was also negative.
A lumbar puncture was positive for significant number of white cells as well as protein without glucose.
An aspiration of a fluid collection on a new CT of his lumbar spine also showed gram-negative rods.
Beta-2 transferrin levels were pending.
On review with the radiologist, the previous CT monitoring done on [**10-16**], there is a dural leak that was not previously present.
His lumbar wound was prepped and draped sterilely in the usual fashion.
Copious pulse lavage was used including 9 liters of fluid after tissue resection had taken place.

TECHNIQUE: CT head without intravenous contrast.
afib, CAD, s/p right flank hernia repair [**10-13**], L3 laminectomy with scar tissue excision [**10-14**], +bacteremia and meningitis, now with mental status changes REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Evaluate carotid arteries, hx.
The peak systolic velocities bilaterally are normal as are the ICA to CCA ratios.
AP CHEST 5:25 A.M. [**11-9**]  HISTORY: Acute shortness of breath and hypoxia.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-6**] and 26:  The patient is not intubated.
A CT scan of his thoracic/lumbar/spine was obtained with abnormalities found involving the L4-S1 levels which compared to last CT of [**4-16**] findings of L4-L5 were significantly worse correlating with his exam, an MR was recommended but deferred secondary to patient's pacemaker.
On HD 2 he had mild improvement in his right lower extremity, a CT myelogram was requested by the spine service to evaluate the area of maximal compression in planning for surgical decompression based on the CT findings.
A nephrology consult was obtained for clearance of CT myelogram secondary to his PMH of multiple myeloma, his creatinine was normal at 0.7 and he had adequate urine output; he was cleared to receive contrast and [**Date Range 1834**] a CT myelogram on HD 2.
On HD 3 he was extubated without difficulty and [**Date Range 1834**] a repeat CT myelogram with findings of improvement of spinal canal stenosis, with moderate degree stenosis remaining at L3/L4 level secondary to herniated disc.
On exam he had trace movement of his right and left hips but no movement distally, deep vein thrombosis treatment was initiated with subcutaneous Heparin.
He was intubated, broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated, he received fluid resuscitation, cultures were sent, a lumbar puncture was performed via fluoroscopy, and he was transferred to the intensive care unit.
He had leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18k.
On HD 10 he [**Date Range 1834**] a CT myelogram which demonstrated a dural leak, he was taken back to the operating room with findings of a infected dural leak, wound dehiscence with omental flap, and cauda equina syndrome; he [**Date Range 1834**] a laminotomy revision of L2, incision and drainage, and dural repair.
On HD 12 he was successfully extubated, the Ciprofloxacin and Vancomycin were discontinued after final sensitivities were reported, he was awake with diminished mental status function.
He was hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit of 26, tube feeds were initiated via a Dobbhoff tube, and he was receiving subcutaneous Heparin and pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, he had movement of his lower extremities at his thighs bilaterally; bilateral lower extremity ultrasound was negative for thrombosis.
On HD 14 his white blood cell count had continued elevation to 23k, his mental status was still without improvement, he was afebrile, oxygenating well on nasal cannula; a head, spine, and chest CT scans were done with nonfocal abnormalities and stable findings, negative for pulmonary embolus; stool cultures were negative for C. Diff although he was placed on empiric Flagyl, a repeat lumbar puncture was performed at the level of L2-L3 with no bacteria identified.
On HD 17 he had improvement in his mental status, his white blood cell count had decreased to 13k, an [**Date Range 461**] demonstrated his ejection fraction to be 70%.
On HD 20 he was found to be unresponsive to command with stable vital signs and a white blood cell count of 13k, a head CT scan was negative for acute changes or bleeding, an EKG and cardiac enzymes were negative for ischemia, an EEG showed mild encephalopathy without epileptiform; his Valproic Acid level was found to be sub-therapeutic, he was bolussed with adjustments made in his daily dose and improvement was noted in his mental status.
On HD 23 a carotid ultrasound was performed which was negative for carotid stenosis, Coumadin therapy was resumed.
On HD 28 he had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia which resolved spontaneously with desaturation to 90% on room air, EKG was without ischemia, chest x-ray was without changes or pneumothorax, his oxygenation improved with nasal cannula, he was afebrile without leukocytosis.
His back staples were to be removed on [**11-12**], he was discharged with the foley catheter which will be necessary for up to 6 weeks secondary to the Cauda Equina syndrome.
