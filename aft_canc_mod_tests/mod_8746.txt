Her workup included radiographs that demonstrated a mass in the left upper lobe and was confirmed by computed tomography scan.
The risk, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with her at length.
She underwent a preoperative evaluation including attempted snipping of her carotid artery by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1132**] here.
For the first two postoperative days, she was monitored in the Postanesthesia Care Unit for some (1) respiratory lability and (2) relative hypotension requiring [**Name (NI) 103585**] drip at low-to-moderate doses to maintain her blood pressure.
A chest x-ray demonstrated collapse of the remaining left lower lobe, and the patient was intubated.
She treated with prophylactic antibiotics, and several cultures did not prove her to have a pneumonia.
Her swallowing evaluation showed gross aspiration.
Around postoperative day twelve, she still manifested an increased white blood cell count despite being afebrile.
Her pulmonary status, however, continued to be tenuous requiring aggressive pulmonary toilet.
The culture did not grow out any bacteria on final analysis.
Cardiology was involved in her management, and pressors were needed to support her blood pressure.
The patient had an elevation in her troponin to a level of 18, and an echocardiogram which showed severe global dysfunction of her left ventricle.
This was a significant change from her preoperative which essentially showed a normal ventricle.
A cardiac catheterization was performed at that time which surprisingly showed completely normal coronary arteries.
Her repeat echocardiogram actually showed a normal left ventricle.
She had previously had a workup for this; both as an inpatient earlier in her hospital stay and as mentioned preoperatively (including an aborted attempt at stenting her carotid).
At this time, the treatment recommended was maintaining her blood pressure at a higher rate; and this was done with a dopamine infusion.
By [**10-13**], the patient was showing improvement with Physical Therapy, and Speech and Swallow evaluation showed significant improvement and no evidence of aspiration, and she was placed on a diet with aspiration maneuvers as described by the Speech Therapy Department.
It should be mentioned that the patient had an increasing interstitial pattern on her chest x-rays.
Her pathology showed bronchoalveolar carcinoma well differentiated as well as a noninvasive thymoma.
Immediately, invasive hemodynamic monitoring lines were placed including a Swan-Ganz catheter that was consistent with septic physiology.
Aggressive treatment was performed at this time to optimize her cardiac, respiratory, pulmonary, and renal function.
