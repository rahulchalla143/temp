If clinically indicated, follow-up studies are suggested.
CT torso [**3-27**] IMPRESSION: 1.
At least one subcentimeter nodular opacity which was not previously identified; recommend continued CT followup to exclude recurrence, and if possible IV contrast.
TTE [**3-30**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
PATHOLOGY FROM RENAL BIOPSY PENDING AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE   Brief Hospital Course: #.

Viral titers were not c/w acute infection.
Pt had repeat TTE after pericardial effusion removed (see above).
Pt had renal biopsy which showed TMA (by prelim path) which would be c/w HUS.
