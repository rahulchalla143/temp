He was admitted on [**2131-10-7**]/11 with CT chest showing new right lower lobe opacification abutting the paraesophageal mediastinum.
He underwent bronchoscopy which showed purulence in the right lower lobe, no evidence of obstruction or bleeding, culture growing gram positive cocci, and cytology negative for malignant cells.
His hemoptysis improved and he was discharged to complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin and clindamycin.
Chest CT on [**10-10**] showed right lower lobar consolidation with central area of hypoattenuation which could reflect necrosis.
CXR (PA/LAT) showed persistent but slight improved aeration of opacity with no new opacities.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2132-10-15**]):       SPARSE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Final [**2132-10-20**]):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       YEAST.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):  [**2132-10-14**] BLOOD CULTURE negative x 2  [**2132-10-18**] RAPID PLASMA REAGIN negative  [**2132-10-14**]  	Radiology	CHEST (PA & LAT) FINDINGS: There is slight improved aeration of the superior segment right lower lobe opacity previously noted.
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.
No significant change compared to the previous tracing of [**2132-10-6**].
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] wire was placed, which was exchanged for 7 French dilator followed by a 7 French double-lumen central line, the tip was positioned within the distal SVC.
Next, right lower lobe branches in the medial aspect of the right lower lobe, corresponding to recent CT findings were accessed and selective third and fourth order pulmonary angiography was performed in multiple projections using a 5 French catheter and ultimately a Transcend wire and STC catheter.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3056**] catheter was advanced and formed over the aortic arch and used to select the bronchial arteries.
This was accessed using a headliner wire and an STC catheter, which was positioned well into the branch.
Angiography was performed.
Pulmonary artery angiography demonstrated slightly abnormal tortuous branches within the right lower lobe in the area of consolidation and inflammation.
Pulmonary angiography did not demonstrate any contribution to a pseudoaneurysm.
LINE PLACEM As compared to the prior study obtained on [**2132-10-16**] at 01:32 a.m.
Right hilar mass and right lower lobe opacities and left basal opacities appear to be unchanged as compared to the most recent chest radiograph.
[**2132-10-21**]	Video Swallow Evaluation  ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Pt had penetration with nectar thick liquids x 1 on a cup sip of nectar thick liquids, cleared at the height of the swallow.
If his motility study is normal and he develops a repeat PNA, suggest returning to our department to trial further dietary modifications.
Of note his Hct dropped from 37-31.
He was transferred to the MICU for further evaluation and treatment.
After IR, bronchoscopy was performed and no obvious site of bleeding was observed.
Three subsequent Hct's were stable at 29.
CT chest showed a question of necrosis in R lower lobe given repeated infections / pneumonias and perhaps inflammation induced erosion through a bronchial vessel.
Vasculitis work-up however was negative.
Per pulmonary, Pt will need to continue levofloxacin 750 mg po daily and clindamycin 450mg po 6hrs for 4 more weeks and have pulmonary appointment in [**2-7**] weeks, who will arrange follow-up workup and repeat imaging.
Pt also had a workup for chronic RLL pneumonias, including negative HIV, a speech and swallow eval that showed only minimal aspiration w/ taking large gulps.
Our speech and swallow specialists recommended some behavioral modification but no dietary restrictions (see previous sheet for details).
Began tapering sertraline by 50mg q4-7 days per psych recs for bleeding risk, currently on 100mg daily since [**10-16**].
Medications on Admission: -clindamycin 450mg QID -levofloxacin 750mg daily -allopurinol 200mg daily -levothyroxine 200mcg daily -lovastatin 40mg daily -oxycodone ER 20mg TID -hydrocodone-acetaminophen 10/325mg TID PRN (but Pt always takes tid) -trazadone 100mg QHS -clonazepam 2mg PO QHS -pantoprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **] -sertraline 150mg daily -propranolol 20mg [**Hospital1 **]   Discharge Medications: 1. levothyroxine 100 mcg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO QAM (once a day (in the morning)).
You had several diagnostic tests, which showed that you continued to have a disease process in the lower lobe of your right lung.
Your red blood cell counts remained stable for several days and you did not show any signs of acute bleeding.
You had a video swallow study here which showed that you do aspirate materials when you take big gulps and mix solids and liquids.
