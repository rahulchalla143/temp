You were admitted to the hospital because you had a fever to 106 in the clinic and your blood pressure was low.
Your liver enzymes were also elevated and an image of your liver was taken to look for infection, but none was found.
Once your blood pressure had normalized you were transferred to the BMT service.
Your liver tests improved and all blood cultures taken after your initial culture did not grow anything.
Do not take neupogen after you leave because your white blood count has come back up.
