She underwnet a CT of the abdomen on [**2107-4-7**] in her area and revealed a double duct sign with dilation of the main PD to 4 mm along with dilation of the gallbladder.
Because of these findings, she had an EUS on [**4-26**] which was not too helpfull.
The EUS showed multiple small sub-centimeter cysts in the head of pancreas  without mass.
A biopsy to a polyp adjacent to minor ampulla was nondignostic.
All remaining systems were reviewed and symptoms were negative.
Compression deformities of T11, T12, and L1 which are not fully imaged on this study.

IMAGING ERCP [**5-10**] IMPRESSION: Limited exam due to inability to cannulate bile duct, however, partial filling of the bile duct demonstrated distal stricture with proximal dilation and pancreatic ductal dilation.
TTE [**5-12**] The left atrium is elongated.
CT chest [**5-17**] Moderate bilateral effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 78 year old woman who lives in [**Hospital3 **] and referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice.
He blood tests and examination were consistent with obstructive jaundice (AP: 504 Tbili: 17.4).
She underwent several studies including CT of the abdomen, EUS, MRCP, and failed ERCP (today).
Today, the unsuccessful attempt for an ERCP failed to achieve deep bile duct cannulation.
We will order bile and blood cultures.
We will also order CXR PA/lateral because of subtle hypoxia.
She was weaned from Neo prior to arrival to floor however required multiple IVF boluses with 2L normal saline and 2L LR to maintain blood pressures >100 sbp.
R radial arterial line was placed to monitor MAP with goal >65.
CVL in R IJ placed for additional hemodynamic monitoring of CVP and volume resuscitation.
# Resp failure: Pt developed worsening O2 requirement concerning for volume overload and worsening pleural effusions on chest xray after large volume fluid resuscitation.
Her chest xray supported volume overload with evidence of pleural effusions, compressive atelectasis and her exam was notable for crackles.
CT chest was ordered when her hypoxia did not improve after 3 days of diuresis.
Results of the cat scan were notable for extensive fibrotic changes throughout the lungs most likely c/w lymphangitic carcinomatosis related to her likely pancreatic ca.
She was initially started on unasyn, flagyl, and cipro for biliary microbial coverage; however, preliminary bile cultures revealed gpc's in pairs, gnr, gnc and so antibiotics were changed to linezolid and zosyn for better coverage.
Blood and urine cultures were and were negative during her stay.
Biliary drain output was monitored.
Biliary cultures as mentioned above grew pan-sensitive klebsiella.
Thereafter Hct was monitored closely and remained stable.
CT chest findings were felt to be lymphangitic carcinomatosis related to her underlying malignancy however it is possible for her to have had IPF with chronic symptoms at baseline.
You had an ERCP what was unable to open the compression in your bile system caused by the mass in your pancreas.
We obtained a CT chest when you didn't improve after taking off fluid and it showed extensive scarring either [**3-16**] chronic underlying lung disease or scarring related to an extension of your cancer.
