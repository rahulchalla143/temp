During his [**4-25**] hospitalization, sputum cultures grew GNR and MSSA.
During his [**6-25**] hospitalization, sputum cultures grew MRSA and he was treated with Vancomycin and later transitioned to Linezolid on discharge for a total of a 10-day course.
Two small perforations were found in the small bowel; these were repaired.
At 10/25 visit BP was low at 86/56 so the patient was told to take only half of his Toprol XL pill.

Physical Exam: --VS: Tc 97.1, HR 126, BP 130/76, RR 24, 99% 2L --General: Slim man sitting up in bed.
Dullness to percussion on the right side.
Urine clear and yellow-pink.

Sputum Sample [**12-4**]: - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2173-12-4**]):       >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
Urine culture [**12-4**]: No growth Blood culture [**12-5**]: Pending  CXR [**12-5**] (AP): No change from previous CXR.
CXR [**12-6**] (PA and lat): Status post right pneumonectomy.
Echo [**12-7**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion without echo evidence for tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**6-25**], a small circumferential pericardial effusion is now present.
In the ED/MICU ([**Date range (1) 50997**]): Upon arrival to the ED he was found to have a temp of 100.6, RR to 50s, HR to 150s, BP 170/108, and O2sats 82-85% on RA.
ECG showed sinus tachycardia, LBBB, and no ST changes (ischemic changes difficult to interpret in the settng of BBB).
CXR showed complete opacity of the right lung field s/p pneumonectomy, and an unremarkable left lung field.
ROMI with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes and telemetry were ordered.
The physical exam was also more suggestive of an upper airway process than a pneumonia.
The sputum sample gram stain showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, suggestive of a Strep species.
The culture grew oropharyngeal flora.
The patient's symptoms and exam improved during the hospitalization.
He continued to cough and produce white/yellow sputum, which he and his wife said was his baseline.
There was no CHF evident on CXR, but it was recognized that mild CHF might have been obscured by COPD, therefore a repeat echo was obtained during this hospitalization to evaluate his function and wall motion.
The echo during this hospitalization showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (unchanged at EF 35%) with hypokinesis of the inferior wall, basal inferolateral wall, distal septum and distal lateral walls, and apex unchanged from previous echo (better defined), consistent with multivessel CAD or another diffuse process.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild free wall hypokinesis, improved from previous echo.
His cardiac enzymes were flat.
His blood pressure was controlled with Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] while in the hospital.
A lipid panel was performed that showed LDL 89, HDl 38, and TG 83.
His Hct has been stable in low 30s during this hospitalization.
In addition, iron studies suggested an anemia of chronic disease.
His vitamin B12 was slightly low, so he was given parenteral B12 while in house, and discharged on B12 supplementation 1000 mcg daily.
--Elevated Serum Glucose: His serum glucose levels were in the 100-150s during this admission.
Left and right ventricular systolic dysfunction, depressed ejection fraction 35%.
