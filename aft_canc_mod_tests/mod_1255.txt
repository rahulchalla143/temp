CT scan was done which showed a large right upper lobe mass extending into the mediastinum, 7.2 centimeters by 7.7 centimeters, associated with right upper lobe collapse.
The patient was discharged and had an outpatient bronchoscopy performed which showed tumor invasion in the distal tracheal, right main-stem bronchus was patent at that time.
Repeat bronchoscopy was done on [**2148-3-15**], which showed complete obstruction of the main stem bronchus.
The patient underwent a staging work-up with abdominal CT scan which showed no metastases.
The patient underwent an emergency CT scan which showed progression of disease and compression of the trachea and main [**Last Name (un) 2435**] bronchus.
