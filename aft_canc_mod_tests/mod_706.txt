She has had a recent lumbar puncture and magnetic resonance imaging with no evidence of central nervous system lymphoma.
An echocardiogram was unremarkable.
The patient had a recent admission to the Neurology Service in [**2186-3-6**] with persistent temporal headaches.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, her pulse was 93, her blood pressure was 136/56, her respiratory rate was 18, and her oxygen saturation was 100% on room air.
Pulmonary examination revealed the lungs were clear to auscultation.
Reflexes were 2+ throughout.
The patient would be bradycardic to the 30s with blood pressures of 60/palpable with spontaneous resumption of her blood pressure to 100/60s without intervention except laying supine.
The Electrophysiology Service saw the patient on admission and performed a tilt table test on [**4-26**].
No supraventricular tachycardia with a baseline heart rate in the 40s.
Her blood pressure returned to [**Location 213**] with an intravenous fluid bolus.
Because the patient had been complaining of persistent left temporal headaches, with worsening over the past days, a magnetic resonance imaging of the neck was obtained which showed a soft tissue mass at the left skull base centered at the jugular foramen.
On [**4-29**], the patient was transferred to the Bone Marrow Transplant Service for further treatment and evaluation of possible lymphoma recurrence.
Telemetry monitoring showed her heart rate down to the high 20s and low 30s.
SOFT TISSUE MASS ISSUES:  The patient had a biopsy by Neurosurgery on [**4-29**] on the [**Hospital Ward Name **].
After this biopsy, the patient was returned to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit for further care.
Preliminary pathology from the soft tissue mass does show lymphoma; however, it appeared to be different than her previous non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
It was thought at the time of this dictation that the patient's mass was due to an [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus associated post transplant lymphoproliferative disease.
She was kept on telemetry during her hospital stay and maintained heart rates in the 80s and blood pressures at 120s/60s.
A thyroid-stimulating hormone was checked during this admission and was 2.3; so there were no changes to her medications.
