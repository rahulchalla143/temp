When she did not improve, she went to [**Hospital 8641**] hospital and her Neurologist recommended an MRI brain.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
She had a colonoscopy and mammogram last year without abnormal finding.

CT head [**2164-7-29**]  A large right frontotemporal mass with extensive surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect and leftward shift of midline structures to approximately 8 mm.
The above findings in conjunction with the prior MRI are concerning for a tumefactive multiple sclerosis or a primary malignant tumor (including primary versus secondary).
The above findings were discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3742**], at approximately 1:30 a.m. and immediately after the CT study.
Limited study for surgigal planning showing mild interval improvement in the ring-enhancing mass in the left frontal lobe with reduction in degree of mass effect.
[**2164-8-3**] CT head postop: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2164-8-9**] Chest X-ray (PA and lat) CONCLUSION:  New airspace consolidation at the base of both lungs, but more prominent in the right lower lobe, suggestive of multifocal pneumonia or aspiration.
[**2164-8-11**] CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON IMPRESSION: 1.
Her MRI was entered into our system.
CT head was done to rule out hemorrhage as her exam was dramatically worse then what was portrayed in the transfer notes.
Neuromedicine requested a biopsy due to the fact that review of OSH records revealed an LP that did not suggest MS.
Preliminary pathology was reviewed with Heme-Path and thought to be primary CNS B-cell lymphoma.
Postoperative CT head demonstrated mild pneumocephalus and small amount of acute blood products in the area of the biopsy.
Her exam remained stable.
Over the next several days her exam improved with improvement of her left facial droop and left-sided weakness.
Unable to perform CTA chest  given concern for contrast affecting renal function while dosing MTX.
CT abdomen showed no acute process.
Follow up: with oncology with readmission next week, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] for additional MTX 5.

A stereotactic brain biopsy was performed and found that you have CNS B-cell Lymphoma.
You developed a fever and a CXR showed that you probably have a Pneumonia.
