All of a sudden the patient became apneic and a chest x-ray was obtained which showed a right upper lung collapse which appeared to be secondary to some bronchial mucous plugging.
At that time it was decided to reintubate the patient and the patient was reintubated and a bronchoscopy was done and a significant amount of secretion/bronchial mucous plugging was removed.
A repeat chest x-ray was done which showed reinflation of the right upper lobe after the bronchoscopy.
In addition, the patient also became very hypotensive and was started on Lopressor, Neo, 1 mcg/kg/min and her blood pressure improved from systolic of 60s to 70s to 110s.
The patient also has a history of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization in the past and so the surgery team who did the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube replacement contact[**Name (NI) **] the [**Name (NI) **] Intensive Care Unit and asked the patient to be transferred to the [**Name (NI) **] Intensive Care Unit for further workup and evaluation.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 24.9, hematocrit 41.7, platelets 542, sodium 135, potassium 4.6, chloride 98, bicarbonate 25, BUN 27, creatinine 1.0, glucose 274, calcium 9.0, phosphorus 6.6, magnesium 2.0, PT 12.6, PTT 26.9, INR 1.1.
Chest x-ray, no evidence of pneumothorax, resolution of right upper lung collapse as compared to the previous x-ray that was done prior to the reintubation.
After the procedure the patient was extubated but became apneic and her oxygen saturation dropped and her chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe collapse, and so the patient was reintubated and a bronchoscopy was done with a significant amount of mucous clubbing, secretions were removed.
A repeat chest x-ray after the bronchoscopy showed reinflation of the right upper lobe.
Initially the patient was on assist control but then she would be switched over to pressor support of 15 or pressor support of 10, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, FIO2 of 35% and the patient would tolerate that well.
Her oxygen saturations were 96 to 98% on 2 liters through the nasal cannula  Cardiovascular - Rate and rhythm, the patient was mostly normal sinus rhythm and would get occasional premature atrial contractions and premature ventricular contractions.
Infectious disease - The patient is known to have a baseline white blood cell count between the range of 9 to 11.
Initially on admission to the [**Year (4 digits) **] Intensive Care Unit her white count was 25.6.
However, that was discontinued in one day or two when the white count came down significantly.
A Vancomycin trough level was obtained which was slightly elevated and so based on the pharmacy recommendations, her Vancomycin was changed to 1 gm q.
12 for pseudomonas coverage since her sputum grew out mild to moderate pseudomonas aeruginosa which was sensitive to Cefepime and mild to moderate Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Iron studies were obtained which were found to be unremarkable.
Since then her hematocrit had been in the range of anywhere between 25 to 30.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - As mentioned earlier the patient received multiple boluses since she was initially hypotensive.
Her baseline blood pressure is found to be anywhere between systolics of 80s and 90s.
Prophylaxis - The patient was on subcutaneous heparin and proton pump inhibitors.
Laboratory data the day before discharge revealed a white count of 11.5, hematocrit 29.7, platelets 537, sodium 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 101, bicarbonate 28, BUN 19, creatinine 1.0 and glucose 91.
Calcium 8.5, magnesium 2.0, phosphorus 4.9.
