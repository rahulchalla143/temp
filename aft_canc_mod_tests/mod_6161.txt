The right sided filling pressures were elevated (mean RA pressure was 15mmHg and RVEDP was 17mmHg).
The left sided filling pressures were elevated (mean PCW pressure was 21mmHg).
The systemic arterial pressures were normal at 106/52mmHg.
The cardiac index calculated using an assumed oxygen  consumption rate was 4l/min/m2.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stent, no dissection and TIMI III flow (See PTCA comments) FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Cardiac index was 4.l/min/m2.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
A slightly-eccentric, posteriorly-directed jet of mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
She is not status post cardiac cath with stenting to LAD.
ECG and cardiac enzymes were positive which signified that she had a second NSTEMI while in the hospital.
Durint the episode she was also noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate which likely contributed to her respiratory decompensation.
#C Diff - Patient tested positive for C diff on [**6-18**].
Her abdomen examination remained benign, and her diarrhea improved.
Blood pressures are now controlled on a regimen of Lisinopril 20mg daily and Metoprolol 100mg TID.
# Pump: Echocardiogram shows EF 40%.
Her home COPD medications were restarted and she continued to have good oxygen saturation on room air (95%) and no reported difficulties breathing.
A fistulogram was completed that did not demonstrate any evidence of fistula.
