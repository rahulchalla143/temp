Head MRI EXAM: MRI of the brain.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 axial and MP-RAGE sagittal images acquired following gadolinium.
FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
B. CXR CHEST RADIOGRAPH  INDICATION: Status post left shoulder repair.
Limited evaluation of the right cephalic and left brachial veins.
E. MRI C-spine ([**2139-10-29**]) IMPRESSION: 1.
The cervical cord, C3 through C7, does demonstrate subtle T2 hyperintense signal, possibly related to myelomalacia.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast cervical spine CT was obtained.
Multiplanar reformatted images were generated.
Given left humerus fracture, polytrauma was ruled out with CT Head not suggestive of bleed, CXR showed no evidence of traumatic injury, MRI of C-spine showed cervical spondylosis with a variety of abnormalities not suggestive of acute abnormality.
His baseline heart rate is 100 per old records.
PT/OT evaluation showed orthostatic hypotension with tachycardia to 160.
Previously in his hospital course, considerations were hypovolemia with heart rate responding to boluses.
[**Name (NI) 227**] confusing picture, neurology was consulted and felt based on additional imaging (MRI brain) that he had the sequela of chronic alcoholism.
# Tachycardia with trigger on [**10-30**] His heart rate was 100s-130s and as high as 160 during first the first 48 hours of hospitalization with SBPs 110s-160s.
Heart rate and blood pressure were not noted to respond to diazepam.
# Acute kidney injury secondary to elevated CPKs, pre-renal, resolved Cr at admission of 2.21 now down to baseline with CK and volume depletion likely contributers.
MRI was performed given point tenderness over spinous processes.
MRI of the spine showed no acute abnormality but some anatomical issues.
He had a nadir to 9.1 with subsequent transfusion of 2pRBC before going to the OR with interval climb of 10.2.
# Transaminitis: The patient has initial LFT elevation on admission (ALT 89 AST 260 LDH 459 CPK 4207 ALP 79 Tot Bili 1) with subsequent downtrend to normal range with remaining isolated LDH elevation.
# Pending tests - BCx x 2 ([**11-7**]), Bcx x 2 ([**11-5**]), JAK2 mutation  # Outpatient considerations - Uptitration of Abilify to 15 mg based on symptoms (akathisia would be main side effect that can be treated with ativan).
- re-check outpatient TSH as suggestive of sick euthyroid - re-check nutritional studies - outpatient substance abuse program or Alcoholics Anonymous - repeat liver enzymes - consider outpatient psychiatry  Medications on Admission: Fexofenadine 60mg [**Hospital1 **] Quetiapine 100 mg qAM, 300mg qPM  Discharge Medications: 1. folic acid 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
