- CXR (lateral decubitus): Single left lateral decubitus view of the chest was provided.
In the setting of continued clinical concern, MRI is more sensitive for metastatic disease evaluation.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
- CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: Extensive vascular calcification noted in the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries.
The right paratracheal lymphadenopathy is no longer appreciated.
- CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is interposition of a large bowel loop between the liver and the diaphragm, known as Chilaiditi's syndrome.
Non-contrast examination of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas is unremarkable.
- CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are numerous surgical clips seen along both pelvic sidewalls and the patient's prostate gland cannot be identified, presumed to be resected.
Furthermore, CTA was not pursued [**12-24**] to increased Cr, and VQ scan was thought to be inaccurate in the setting of his lung cancer.
Echo did not show right heart strain but did note some pHTN.
Pt's BPs stabilized in SBP 90s-100s.
Cultures were negative.
His O2 sats remained normal, and his cough subsequently resolved.
[**Month (only) 116**] have increased dead space secondary to atelectasis, possible PE, or possible hypoventilation.
Persantine MIBI in [**2109**] showed global hypokinesis with LVEF 40%.
Echo was repeated to evaluate for the heart function, which showed persistent poor function of 35-40%.
# Acute on chronic renal failure, most likely pre-renal azotemia due to poor PO intake and insensible losses through vomiting as suggested by urine lytes.
His Cr improved, but noted to have urinary retention of 600cc on [**10-18**].
Condom cath remained on and pt subsequently able pass urine.
His anti-hypertensives were initially held given hypotension on presentation.
The study was performed, which showed a superficial lesion, likely a post-radiation effect, however penile metastatic disease cannot be formally ruled out.
Tablet(s) 24. ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) 50,000 unit Capsule Sig: (1) Capsule PO twice per month.
You came to the ICU and your blood pressure improved, and you were subsequently transferred to the regular floor and continued to do well.
