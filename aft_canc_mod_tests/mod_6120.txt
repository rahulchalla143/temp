CT Head [**2126-10-21**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Please note, CT is not as sensitive as MRI in the detection of intracranial lesions or metastasis.
ECG [**2126-10-21**]: Sinus tachycardia.
CXR [**2126-10-21**]: Large left lung mass.
CTA Chest [**2126-10-21**]: 1.
Echo [**2126-10-22**]:  Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis with pulmonary artery hypertension probable main pulmonary artery thrombus c/w pulmonary embolism.
CXR [**2126-10-22**]: Since yesterday, mild bibasal atelectasis slightly increased.
CXR [**2126-10-23**]: No significant interval change was demonstrated.
The bilateral hilar enlargement might represent pulmonary hypertension due to massive pulmonary embolism.
CXR [**2126-10-23**]: In comparison with the study of [**10-23**], the left mid lung opacification has somewhat decreased.
CXR [**10-24**]: There is slight interval worsening in right upper lobe opacities which might represent developing pneumonia given its absence on [**2126-10-22**].
CXR [**10-26**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the left lung mass is unchanged.
CXR [**10-30**]: Previous large right upper lobe pneumonia is slightly improved since [**10-26**].
Mediastinal contour suggests adenopathy, better delineated by recent chest CT scanning.
Echo showed RV cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis with pulmonary artery hypertension probable main pulmonary artery thrombus c/w pulmonary embolism.Cardiac enzymes also elevated likely secondary to RV strain and PE.
She continued to have wheezes on exam and tachypnea at baseline but improved slowly during her admission.
She was kept on telemetry and remained tachycardic at baseline, however her blood pressure remained stable.
Her tachycardia improved as well, and heart rates in the 80's.
Started on argatroban, which was continued until her platelets hit 100, at which point warfarin was added.
On [**11-6**], her INR was was 4.4, and on [**11-8**] she completed 48 hours of overlap.
Her discharge INR was 4.5.
Her warfarin dosing should be adjusted appropriately for a goal INR [**3-3**].
# Pneumonia: Chest X-ray on [**9-26**] was suggestive of infiltrate.
CBC and differential was trended.
She has a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] on [**11-21**] for evaluation for further treatment.
