MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
The white blood cell count appears markedly increased and comprised of almost entirely of neoplastic promonocytes an occasional mature monocyte.
Platelet count appears decreased, occasional large forms are seen.
Differential count shows 5% neutrophils, 0% bands, 1% lymphocytes, 11% monocytes, 0% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 83% blasts and promonocytes.
Differential (500 cells) shows: 58% Blasts and promonocytes, 2% Promyelocytes, 6% Myelocytes, 3% Metamyelocytes, 8% Bands/Neutrophils, <1% Plasma cells, 13% Lymphocytes, 9% Erythroid.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2101-4-22**] Chest X-ray: The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum is grossly normal.
[**2101-4-26**] CT chest: Diffuse predominantly peribronchial parenchymal opacities suggesting recent infection.
Subtle changes described in the report of a [**2101-4-26**] CT scan are not appreciated on today's radiograph, question due to interval resolution versus limitations of radiographs versus CT.  [**2101-5-6**] BM cytogenetics: KARYOTYPE: 47,XY,+15,[**Doctor First Name 15**](15)(Q15Q24)[5]/46,XY[11] INTERPRETATION: Five of 16 metaphases contained an additional copy of chromosome 15 (TRISOMY 15) and an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15.
Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
The white blood cell count appears markedly decreased.
Differential count shows   2% neutrophils,  76% lymphocytes,  19% monocytes,  1% basophils, 2% plasma cells.
[**2101-5-9**] CT abd/pelvis: 1.
Clinical correlation with examination is advised.
Brief Hospital Course: 35 year old male with no past medical history with multiple month history of malaise and shortness of breath, presents with laboratory studies suggestive of acute leukemia, found to have AML.
Bone marrow biopsy was completed on admission and showed ...  Hydroxyurea was started on admission, and then discontinued once 7+3 chemotherapy was begun the following day.
Transthoracic echocardiogram was completed on admission prior to chemotherapy dosing.
Electrolytes, CBC, fibrinogen, uric acid, and LDH were checked initially every four hours, but then every six hours to evaluate for both tumor lysis and DIC.
CT sinus, chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to evaluate but did not identify a source.
There is a question of prostatis on imaging but without any clinical symptoms and with all urine cultures incl chlamydia being negative, but regardless was started on meropenem.
CT neck ordered to evaluate and negative for mastoiditis.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy done on day 14 revealed persistent cytogenetic abnormalities.
Bone marrow biopsy done on day 20 revealed no leukemic cells and pt was discussed at transplant meeting w decision to postpone additional chemo or SCT at this time w plans for observation.
# Thrombocytosis: Uptrend observed and splenomegaly appreciated on exam [**5-21**] w pt c/o mild abd discomfort w sitting.
CT abd showed no acute process.
Renal ultrasound was perfomed and showed enlarged kidney.
Tumor lysis labs were obtained at first every four hours, then every six hours.
DIC labs were initially obtained every four hours, then every six.
His INR has been elevated so he has received 3 courses of vitamin K 5mg PO x3 days.
Transfusions were given to maintain hematocrit greater than 21.
CBC was trended multiple times per day.
A baseline chest X-ray was obtained and showed no abnormality.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed before chemotherapy administration which showed no gross abnormalities of heart function.
ECG showed no abnormalities.

Repeat bone marrow biopsy done on day 14 showed a persistence of abnormal cells.
Bone marrow biopsy done on day 20 revealed lack of leukemia and we plan to observe you for now without additional chemotherapy at this time.
A catscan was negative for bone involvement and you were treated with Afrin.
[**Name2 (NI) **] had a cat scan of your abdomen which was negative.
