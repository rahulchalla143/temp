PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission this patient was afebrile with stable vital signs with a weight of 120.0 kilograms.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was normal.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal examination: Revealed mild ascites, non-tender throughout.
Extremity examination revealed 1 plus ankle edema.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit 38.5, white blood cell count 11.2, platelet count 140,000.
Sodium 143, potassium 3.4, chloride 103, carbon dioxide 34, blood urea nitrogen 16, creatinine 1.0, glucose level 50.
AST was 61, ALT was 52 and alk phos was 83.
Total bilirubin was 1.7.
His prothrombin time was 14.3, his PTT was 26.4.
His fibrinogen was 267 and his INR was 1.4.
CellCept, Solu- Medrol, Unasyn, fluconazole were started.
Urinalysis was performed.
A chest x-ray was performed and an electrocardiogram was performed.
A transesophageal echocardiogram had shown residual clot and adequate biventricular function.
A chest x-ray was sent and the patient was weaned off of FiO2.
The patient was also on a Foley catheter to follow urine output closely.
The patient was also transfused platelets, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate at this time and the patient began the immunosuppressive regimen with Solu-Medrol at 140 twice a day, CellCept 1 gram twice a day, ________ times one intraoperatively and, in terms of endocrine, patient was placed on a regular insulin sliding scale at this time with a plan to move to an insulin drip if glucose levels trended upwards.
An electrocardiogram was taken showing no ischemic changes.
Patient was receiving Nipride which was being held for systolic blood pressure less than 160.
Patient receiving CPAP and his total bilirubin and other liver function tests including ALT and AST continued to trend downward.
His liver function tests on this day were 155 for AST, 614 for ALT and 64 for alk phos.
The previous day on [**5-25**] were AST of 252, ALT of 309 and alk phos of 65.
As per their request after they reviewed the chart they noted that his prior regimen was likely suboptimal and that his insulin needs would be significantly different after this liver transplantation due to the effects of steroids and his new liver and they began to discuss outpatient regimens for the patient.
Ancef 1 gram every eight hours was started at this time and a full HUS workup was commenced and Hematology was consulted.
A blood smear was sent that was viewed by Hematology not to contain any schistocytes and that most likely a hemolytic-uremic syndrome workup was not necessarily warranted but that they would follow the results.
He continued to be followed by [**Last Name (un) **] for glucose levels and was continued on Ancef at this time.
His vital signs were stable and the patient was without pain at this time.
The patient continued to be followed by Nutrition, Respiratory Care and his liver function tests continued to trend downwards.
Cyclosporin levels were found to be therapeutic and it was determined again by Transplant staff that the patient would likely need rehabilitation.
Per Psychiatry's request, the lithium level was sent and found to be 1.9.
His lithium level and renal function were noted to be improving at this time.
On physical examination vital signs were temperature maximum over the last 24 hours of 98.4 degrees.
Blood pressure 132/71.
Respiratory rate of 20.
Oxygen saturation 94 percent on room air.
His weight was 123.3 kilograms.
His fingersticks were in the low 100's.
His cardiac examination revealed regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
His respiratory examination revealed clear to auscultation bilaterally.
On abdominal examination the patient was noted to be non-distended, normoactive bowel sounds, soft and non-tender throughout with a well-healing wound.
His laboratory values at this time were the following:  PT time 12.5, PTT 22.4, INR 1.0, fibrinogen 431.
On [**2158-6-8**], his cyclosporin level was 944.
His liver function tests revealed an ALT of 14, an AST of 15, alk phos of 127, a total bilirubin of 1.8 and albumin of 2.8.
White count at this time was 12.9, hematocrit 27.6 and platelet count 137,000.
Laboratory levels were to be drawn twice weekly to measure levels of immunosuppressive drugs and liver function tests.
Metoprolol 75 mg by mouth twice a day with hold for heart    rate less than 60 or systolic blood pressure less than    100.
Hold for    systolic blood pressure less than 110.
Again, labs are to be drawn on a twice weekly basis and levels to be followed by the Transplant team.
