[**2114-8-14**]: CTA CHEST W&W/O C: 1.
If there is continued clinical concern, a HIDA scan could be obtained for further evaluation.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
[**2114-8-21**] CTA chest:1.
Global cardiac enlargement, stable since [**2114-4-25**].
[**2114-8-21**] CT Head: Unchanged size and appearance of right frontal extra-axial mass, likely a meningioma, with unchanged surrounding edema and mass effect.

CT Head was negative for acute change, CT Chest Angio was negative for PE.
An echocardiogram revealed no changes.
Her wound culture grew MDR Pseudomonas.
Her urine culture was negative.
Plastic Surgery was concerned for possible gallbladder pathology and requested a RUQ ultrasound, which revealed a midly thick gallbladder with mobile gallstone and no other evidence of acute cholecystitis.
A Chest CT showed no change in her sternal wound, no evidence of fluid collection.
Her surveillance [**Month/Day/Year **] cultures were all negative.
She was kept on Pneumboots until her INR was consistently theraputic (goal [**12-27**]).
She will need continued [**Month/Day (3) **] work to monitor her INR and re-dose the Coumadin as appropriate to achieve INR goal of [**12-27**].
# Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has had a slowly increasing creatinine (1.1 on day of discharge, 0.5-0.6 baseline) secondary to poor PO intake and low volume status.
She will need monitoring of her kidney function by repeat creatinine measurements, and likely future re-initiation of her anti-hypertensives once her volume status corrects and kidney injury resolves.
Also, the patient has needed frequent repletion of her potassium and magnesium during her hospitalization, likely due to poor nutritional status and being on diuretics.
She will need monitoring of her electrolytes, and supplementation as needed, upon arrival to the skilled nursing facility.
Her hematocrit never fell below 21%, but given her cardiac history, and physiologic signs such as tachycardia, as well as endorsed dyspnea, she received one unit of packed red [**Date Range **] cells on two separate occasions, and responded appropriately.
Her CXRs were negative for pneumonia or signs of fluid overload.
Her oxygen saturation remained within normal limits on room air.
# HTN: The patient's [**Last Name (un) **] pressure ranged from systolics high 90s to 110s and diastolics from 50s to 60s.
Mag oxide 400mg [**Hospital1 **] 21.
KCl 20 meq daily 22.
APAP 650mg Q4h prn pain/temp 23.
We have made some changes to your medications, which are listed in detail in your instruction sheet.
Additionally, you will need close monitoring of your INR and coumadin dosing.
