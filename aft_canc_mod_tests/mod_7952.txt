Several rim-enhancing peritoneal implants are present in the right upper quadrant and midepigastrium (5:108, 5:99).
CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-8-26**] 2:46 AM FINDINGS: Right middle and medial basilar lobe atelectasis is unchanged since [**2117-8-3**].
No dilated or abnormally thickened bowel, though evaluation is limited without intravenous or oral contrast.
DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL Study Date of [**2117-8-26**] 10:54 AM CLINICAL INDICATION: Patient with known and previously ruptured hepatoma with invasion of the hepatic veins in inferior vena cava.
Color flow on pulse Doppler demonstrates full patency of the right, left and main portal vein although the main portal vein is somewhat narrowed as it courses over the segment I liver mass.
CONCLUSION: Multiple hepatic masses as described, with segment VII-VIII mass invading the right hepatic vein and inferior vena cava as noted on prior CTA study from [**2117-7-30**].

CXR [**2117-8-29**]: Large right pleural effusion has increased.
Cardiac size cannot be evaluated.
CXR [**2117-8-30**]: Unchanged appearance of right pleural effusion.
Patient was given IV fluids to neutralize acid levels which caused swelling in his lower extremities.
Lactic acid was markedly elevated out of proportion to patient's overall hemodynamic stability, and was thought to be related to lactate secretion by the patient's known hepatocellular carcinoma.
RUQ u/s did not demonstrate new thrombosis of portal vein.
#Acute renal failure: Admitted with Cr 1.5 from 0.7, thought to be hypovolemic, trended to 1.3 with rehydration.
Patient complains of minor epigastrium tenderness to deep palpation but not of pain.
CT scan does not show any evidence of  INACTIVE # CAD: Continued metoprolol .
