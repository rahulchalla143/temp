ECG in the ED was noted to [**Location (un) 381**] voltage, poor R wave progression, TWI in V5-V6; CXR showed BL pleural effusions.
Labs in the ED showed an elevated creatinine to 2.2 from a baseline of 1.9, an elevated BNP, and a troponin of 0.24 with negative CK.
Within 1 hour of receiving these medications, his SBP dropped to 70/50 (from the 110's systolic).
He was noted to have a pulsus of 5 and low voltage on ECG.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient's VS were T 97.3; BP 66/32; HR 55; RR 14; SaO2 98% on 2L NC.
Emergent bedside echo revealed moderate LVH, normal LV function, mild RVH and mild depressed/borderline RV function.

ECHO ([**2120-1-28**]) - The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
RENAL U/S ([**2120-1-28**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
Incomplete evaluation of renal vasculature.
A repeat examination can be obtained when the patient is clinically more stable.
ECHO ([**2120-1-29**]) - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**], moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased PCWP are now identified.
CARDIAC CATH ([**2120-1-29**]) - FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Please clinically correlate with patient's symptoms and a CT can be obtained.
Diagnostic considerations include atelectasis versus airspace disease.
Dedicated chest radiograph may be warranted.
Skeletal Survey - FINDINGS: Marked generalized inhomogeneity of the spongiosa, notably in the area of the right more than the left humerus.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 y/o M with history of HTN, COPD, dCHF (last EF 55% with LVH), admitted with suspected CHF exacerbation, found to be hypotensive shortly after admission and transferred to the CCU.
Echo on presentation showed biventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function.
However, ECG showed low voltage.
Patient's hypotension persisted, and he continued to required pressors.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2 with a recent baseline of 1.9.
Colonoscopy in [**2114**] was normal.
Your blood pressures stayed low despite our interventions and this made us consider that you might have an infiltration of the heart muscle called amyloidosis.
A biopsy of the fat pad from your belly showed that you did indeed have amyloidosis.
