She had a CT scan and abdominal U/S which showed "significant enlargement of fibroids and further areas of necrosis in left superior fibroids."
In addition, the patient [**Hospital 1834**] an MRI/MRCP which showed "unremarkable biliary and pancreatic ductal system and pancreatic parenchyma," per the discharge summary from the referring facility.
She reports a workup at that time which indicated that the likely source was her enlarged uterus.
She had a negative endometrial biopsy and opted for treatment with Uterine Artery Embolization on [**2180-1-13**] with hopes of decreasing fibroid size and thus releving the possible mass effect on the pancreas.
