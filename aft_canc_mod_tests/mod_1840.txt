Admission Date:  [**2144-11-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-12-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-9-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: CHF exacerbation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central Line placment Hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: 77-year-old male with history of DM Type II, CHF (last echo [**7-/2143**] with EF 20-30%, 1+ MR, 1+ AR, LAH), CAD s/p CABG [**2129**]/[**2132**] (unclear anatomy, not on file here), chronic LE edema, LE superficial ulcers, who presented with worsening dyspnea, increased abdominal girth x 2 days (baseline wt ~ 172 lbs => 176 on last check this week).
Of note, had episode of unheralded syncope on Monday; no aura or neurologic, cardiac prodrome; did not remember falling to ground, woke up on ground later after undetermined period, no bowel/bladder incontinence, post-ictal confusion, tongue biting.
p-MIBI in [**3-/2143**] Partially reversible, moderate-severe myocardial perfusion defect involving the entire inferior wall and the inferior portion of the lateral wall.
LV enlargement and global hypokinesis with EF of 21%.
Congestive Heart Failure: ECHO [**2-21**]: Lventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls and severe hypokinesis of the inferior septum.
Physical Exam: T: 96.5 BP: 118/64 HR: 61 RR: 18 O2sats: 98% RA Gen: NAD HEENT: NC/AT; MMM; OP clear without lesions or exudate; PERRLA ; EOMI NECK: Supple, No LAD, Thyroid smooth and not enlarged, JVP not distended Lungs: CTA bilaterally without wheezes, rhonchi or rales Heart: RRR, nl S1 and S2, no murmurs rubs or gallops Abd: Soft, NT, ND, NABS, no masses palpated Ext: No C/C/E; 2+DP/PT pulses bilaterally Skin: Warm and Dry Rectal: Normal rectal tone; brown guaiac negative stool Neuro: A&O x 3; CN II - XII individually tested and intact; strength 5/5 upper and lower extremities; sensation grossly intact in upper and lower extremities; 2+ reflexes in patella   Pertinent Results: ECHO [**2144-11-20**] Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared with the prior report (tape unavailable) of [**2143-3-1**], left ventricular systolic function is probably worse.
EKG - NSR at 100, left axis deviation, 1' AVB, delayed RWP (new), non-specific IVCD/LBBB likely lead placement (had been LBBB on prior EKG, likely lead placement) .
LABS on discharge: WBC 12.1 (improving), HCT 28.4 (received one unit of blood in dialysis after this lab value), PLT 356 Na 135, k 4.2, Cl 98, HCO3 25, BUN 51, Cr 4.6 INR 1.8 .
CHEST CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST ([**2144-12-3**]): Mosaic pattern of pulmonary perfusion is unchanged from [**2143-12-30**].
These were both seen on the prior study and are not changed in the interval.
Several other nodules seen on the prior study are not seen in the current study, either resolved of subsumed in the atelectasis in the right lung.
Followup non- contrast chest CT is recommended after treatment to confirm stability of these nodules.
Initial management was directed toward lowering his wedge pressure and further afterload reduction for resolution of his systolic heart failure.
Serum creatinine increased to mid-3 (3.3) from 2.8 baseline on admission.
Digoxin was restarted, with lopressor and nitrate held for further blood pressure room for fluid removal and amiodarone.
Given concern for conduction delay, tissue doppler imaging echo was obtained, which disclosed a septal-to-posterior wall motion delay od 306 ms; however, biventricular pacing was deferred given his pituitary adenoma (and likely reimaging) and active lower extremity ulcerations.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**11-20**] disclosed new aortic stenosis (valve area 1.0, though calculated in setting of low-flow, low-gradient), 1+ MR, global LV hypokinesis, with ejection fraction 21%.
Chest CT was obtained for evaluation of right pleural effusion, and it was felt that by imaging and ultrasound, the right pleural effusion was too small to tap.
He was transfused 2 units packed red blood cells, and re-started on lisinopril.
Given his low ejection fraction, he was started on coumadin for a goal INR [**2-20**], and should have a repeat INR check within 3 days of discharge.
Ceftriaxone (initially started in CCU for presumed UTI) was converted to ciprofloxacin given persistently positive urinalysis, and repeat urine culture was sent (pending on dischage); patient will complete ciprofloxacin 3 day course and, on INR check, should have a repeat urinalysis.
Spironolactone, lisinopril, amiodarone were continued, and he was started on renagel and nephrocaps as he initiated hemodialysis.
PTH and iron studies (requested by renal) pending on discharge.
Coumadin 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime: Please recheck INR on [**2144-12-6**] and adjust his dose as needed.
Goal INR = [**2-20**].
positive p-MIBI in [**3-/2143**] CHF with an EF here 21%, LV global HK Benign prostatic hypertrophy s/p TURP Sleep Apnea   Discharge Condition: Stable, on hemodialysis   Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
