The patient reports that his visiting nurse checked an INR on [**8-18**] (last dose of Coumadin) which was elevated to >4.
His Coumadin was held, and when it was checked again today it was elevated >5 and he was instructed to come to the ED.
In the ED his vitals were T 98.1 HR 104 BP 141/86 O2 - 98% on RA.
CT scan was done showing no evidence of RP bleed.
Nuerosurgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended no need to reverse INR at this point.

[**9-6**] --> Blood, urine and tissue cx --> Pan-sensitive Klebsiella .
MR Lumbar spine ([**8-14**]): 1.
On the post-gadolinium images a central area of low signal identified within the T12 vertebral body which could be due to changes from treatment.
CT Lumbar spine ([**8-18**]): Multilevel metastatic disease within the visualized lower thoracic and lumbar spine as described above.
These findings suggest a hemangioma of the L4 vertebral body with superimposed metastasis, recommend further evaluation with an MRI of the thoracic spine.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**8-21**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Multiple lungs nodules, likely representing metastases, smaller in size since [**65**]; however, the evaluation is limited on this abdominal CT. 4.
Multilevel thoracolumbar spinal metastasis with soft tissue and indentation into the spinal canal, which has been described in detail on recent MRI and CT of the lumbar spine.
Blood, urine, and tissue cx all showed Klebsiella.
