History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 10936**] is a 54yo M w/hx ESRD with failed tx on PD, DM-I, CAD, CHF with EF ~15% who presents to the ED with hypotension.
In the ER, initial vitals were T98.6F, HR 74, BP 70/37, RR 17 and oxygen sat 99% RA.
Blood pressures dropped to 56 systolic and he was given 2L NS and systolics came up to 70s-80, so he was placed on peripheral dopamine.
His PD fluid was sent for culture and cytology.
Cell count from the PD fluid showed 50 WBCs and 9% polys.
ECG showed ST depressions anterolaterally which are similar to prior ECGs.
On evaluation in the MICU, patient was very lethargic and attention waxed and waned during exam.
Arrived with right IJ in place and was on dopamine pressor with blood pressures stable at 118/67.
# Systolic CHF: LVEF 10-15%, akinesis of the inferior, inferoseptal, and inferolateral walls and severe hypokinesis of the other segments, RV dilation/failure, moderately elevated PA pressures, 2+ MR. # History of C. diff ([**2-27**]) # Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] # PVD # HTN # h/o Osteomyelitis of R 5th metatarsal in [**2128**] # s/p L toe amputation after ICU stay for sepsis/osteomyelitis (MSSA) [**1-26**] # Eosinophilic gastritis # Stoke in [**2123**] with right hand weakness, resolved on its own.

Baseline blood pressures were 90s-100s.
At 1:35pm, called to room with acute bradycardia down to HR 40s down from 90s.
