Imaging: CXR [**2186-12-24**]: port catheter, The lungs are clear.
CT Sinus/Mandible/maxilla [**2186-12-24**]: Large amounts of subcutaneous emphysema involving the right side  of the face as described.
CT SINUS W/ CONTRAST  [**2186-12-27**] IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in right face soft tissue emphysema with persistent inflammatory changes of the right cheek and buccal tissues.
ENT was consulted regarding air in soft tissues of right cheek seen on CT scan.
A repeat CT sinus showed interval improvement with no abscess.
Pt was noted to develop oral lesions, and n HSV culture of her oral lesions was performed.
Given concern of ophthalmic involvement of a possible HSV outbreak, ophtho was consulted, and there was no concern for eye involvement.
In-house bacterial cultures were all negative, so she was discharged with VNA services for antibiotics (clinda/dapto), with close ID followup.
Of note, her lower lip viral culture performed [**12-28**] did return as positive for HSV type I several days after her discharge.
EKG was without significant ischemic changes and cardiac enzymes were negative x 3.
Echo from [**2186-10-13**] shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%), so CHF is presumably [**1-27**] diastolic dysfunction.
