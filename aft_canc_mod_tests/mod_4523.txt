He was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital in [**Hospital1 1474**] with a Hct of 24.8 and INR of 1.5 and reports of BRBPR x wks.
He continued to pass clots per rectum and was transfused with 4U PRBCs and his INR was reversed.
A tagged red cell scan was performed, which showed active bleeding.
At [**Hospital1 18**], the patient continued to pass BRBPR (clots) and he was transfused an additional unit.
GI was consulted and performed a colonoscopy which did not show any active areas of hemorrhage, but did show multiple polyps, diverticulosis, and possible ischemic colitis.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit during his entire [**Hospital1 18**] admission.
On the day of d/c, the patient's Hct was 27.1 with INR 1.4. .
His pressures remained stable during the admission.
# Recurrent UTIs - The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs associated with his chronic in-dwelling foley catheter, which he has had for 5-7 years.
He was discharged on 10 U qpm but may require up-titration depending on his blood sugars.
Communication was with the patient and his wife, daughter - his health care proxy, and son-in-law.
Your blood pressure was never dangerously low, but you were transfused with 5 units of blood and your blood-thinning medication (Coumadin) was stopped and its effects were reversed.
You had a tagged red cell scan at [**Hospital3 417**], which indicated active bleeding and since it was felt that surgery was not in your best interest, you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Here, our radiologists did a study and did not see evidence of active bleeding.
Because you did continue to have lower GI bleeding w/ clots, our gastroenterology team was consulted; they performed a colonoscopy, which showed evidence of diverticulosis, multiple small colon polyps, and possible evidence of ischemic colitis.
Your red blood cell count remained stable during your entire admission at [**Hospital1 18**].
You should have your INR routinely checked in addition to your CBC.
It may also be beneficial for your goal INR to be from 1.5 to 2.5 instead of 2 to 3.
