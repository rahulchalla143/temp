Comparison is also made to scout radiograph from CT from [**2160-11-12**].
CXR [**2160-12-8**]- As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase in extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities.
Status post sternotomy, CABG, moderate cardiomegaly, the presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2160-12-9**]- Poor image quality.The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-8-28**], the degree of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] seen has increased slightly (degree of MR [**First Name (Titles) 12314**] [**Last Name (Titles) 102625**] on prior report).
CT Head [**2160-12-10**]- WET READ- 1.
Evaluation of small mass, however, is limited in the absence of IV contrast.
He spiked a fever and CXR was concerning for new pneumonia, so vancomycin, cefepime and levofloxacin were started.
His blood pressure remained stable with normal mentation and good urine output, and he did not require any fluid boluses or pressors.
A code stroke was called and a CT of the head showed a non-hemorrhagic stroke in the right MCA, adjacent to prior stroke.
