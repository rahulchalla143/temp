HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY:  On [**2150-7-11**], the patient received his first dose of cyclophosphamide and vincristine as well as packed red blood cells for a hematocrit drop to 19.
The patient received a total of four units of packed red blood cells for his hematocrit of 19.
It was unclear why his hematocrit had dropped to 19 on this day, since his hemoptysis was decreasing.
Later on, once a chest CT scan was done showing a renal hematoma, it was thought that this might have been the source secondary to the renal biopsy that was done recently.
A smear was reviewed at the beginning of his stay and no signs consistent with hemolysis, such as schizocytes, were seen.
His prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and INR normalized, making consumptive coagulopathy less likely.
On [**2150-7-8**], a urinalysis showed large blood in the urine but no red blood cells, so it was decided to check a CK to look for myoglobinuria.
His CK was found to be elevated at 4820.
This was thought to be secondary either to lymphoma infiltrating muscle or liver and it was decided to do a gallium study for further staging.
A bone marrow biopsy and aspiration were done on [**2150-7-10**], revealing negative cultures but findings consistent with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma infiltrating the bone marrow.
His platelet count was 50,000 that day, so a head CT scan was done showing no bleed.
His liver function tests were elevated on [**2150-7-11**] with an ALT of 125, AST of 308 and alkaline phosphatase of 124, suggesting possible liver etiology to his increased CK.
On [**2150-7-12**], he was started on Neupogen subcutaneously for a low white blood cell count status post chemotherapy.
On [**2150-7-15**], the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 26 in preparation for discharge.
RENAL/FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient's renal function continued to improve throughout his hospitalization stay.
On the day after transfer to the floor, the creatinine was 2 and the sodium and potassium were stable.
His calcium, magnesium and potassium were occasionally low and these were repeated as necessary.
It was fractionated on [**2150-7-10**] with a normal MB and an electrocardiogram was done, which was unchanged.
The troponin was less than 0.3.
On [**2150-7-10**], the patient's creatinine was 1.1.
A chest x-ray on [**2150-7-12**] revealed a subscapular left kidney hematoma on CT scan, probably secondary to his renal biopsy and this would explain the drop of hematocrit to 19 on the day that he was transferred to the floor.
His renal function continued to improve with a creatinine of 0.6 on [**2150-7-14**].
The patient's CK continued to remain high, going as high as approximately 7000 during this admission.
At this time, this seems to be slowly trending down with the CK on [**2150-7-15**] of 5228.
His chest x-ray after reaching the floor was much improved as compared with the last one showing resolved pneumonia.
On [**2150-7-10**], an infectious disease consultation was requested because of the growth of herpes simplex virus I on culture of his bronchoscopy aspiration on [**2150-7-6**].
There was no change on chest x-ray and his blood cultures and urine cultures were negative.
His stools were negative for Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Isospora and Microsporidium as well as being negative for Clostridium difficile twice.
His repeat sputum culture was negative for fungus, but viral cultures were showing herpes simplex virus-like effects again.
The question remains as to whether to continue him on ceftazidime, which is an intravenous medication for his neutropenia, until his absolute neutrophil count is greater than 500 and he is afebrile.
When the patient was first transferred to the floor on [**2150-7-6**], his hemoptysis seemed to be resolving.
A chest x-ray showed increased vascularity, so intravenous fluids were decreased a little bit to 100 cc/hour instead of 150 cc/hour.
On [**2150-7-11**], the patient had recurrent bright red hemoptysis and a pulmonary consultation was requested with a repeat chest CT scan ordered to see if there was any source for this recurrent hemoptysis.
Other possibilities included post extubation versus anti-GBM versus vasculitis.
However, the patient refused a repeat bronchoscopy on [**2150-7-13**] because he wanted to let his body heal.
His chest CT scan showed some pulmonary nodules, possibly consistent with lymphoma, and some right upper lobe ground-glass opacities, possibly consistent with infection.
It would be a good idea to repeat the chest CT scan after the acyclovir treatment is done to look for any resolution.
On [**2150-7-16**], the patient was given Baclofen for his hiccups, which seemed to work more effectively than the Thorazine, so he might consider either one of these as an outpatient if his hiccups do continue.
He was sent for cultures, ova and parasites and Clostridium difficile and these were all negative.
