[**5-1**] ECHO The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The right atrial free wall and right ventricular free wall appear markedly thickened with marked acoustic enhancement and impaired contractile function, suggestive of an inflammatory or infiltrative process.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-4-20**], a large pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade are now present.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-5-4**], the findings are similar.
Cytogenetics on initial bone marrow biopsy showed 54,XX,+X,+1,[**Doctor Last Name **](1)t(1;16)(q11;p11),+3,+4,+8,+14,+20,+21[20].
Day 14 bone marrow biopsy was delayed due to pericardial tamponade.
Day 16 bone marrow biopsy showed hypocellular marrow by report however on review of the slides, few early forms were seen.
Bone marrow bx was performed early on day 21 and showed early forms, cytogenetics showed normal karyotype in 20/20 cells.
Bone marrow biopsy was again repeated [**5-14**], results were pending at the time of discharge.
# Pulmonary Infiltrates: CT scan obtained on admission showed bilateral pulmonary opacitities in an interestitial pattern which were concerning for infection vs. leukemic involvement.
Pulmonology was consulted and bronchoscopy was performed which was culture negative and did not reveal malignant cells.
Repeat CT scan showed resolution of pulmonary opacities.
An initial ECHO showed a small perical cardial effusion and subsequent ECHO described the effusion as trivial.
On [**2111-5-1**] the friction rub was absent, EKG showed low voltage across the precordium.
Pulsus was 8mmHg repeat ECHO demonstrated tamponade physiology.
Cardiology performed pericardiocentesis which dropped right atrial pressure from 15 to 1 by draining 85 cc of pericardial fluid which was sent for viral, bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal culture.
Repeat TTE on [**2111-5-2**] showed resolution of tamponade physiology and normal systolic function.
The study also showed  possible thickening of the posterior parietal pericardium, with tethering of visceral and parietal surfaces consistent with constrictive pericarditis.
She had a cardiac MRI showing constrictive pericarditis, with a small circumfrential effusion, normal RV function though RV hypertrophy was noted.
Repeat ECHO showed no evidence of pericardial tamponade and findings consistent with constrictive pericarditis.
Potential sources included central line (removed and tip culture negative) pulmonary, pericaridal fluid or malignancy.
ID was consulted who recommended sending pericardial fluid for fungal, bacterial and viral (EBV, Coxackie, Enterovirus, adenovirus) culture and Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Cytologic exam; Cell Count and Differential; Enterovirus RNA, Qualitative, RT-PCR; EBV PCR, Coxackie PCR, Adenovirus PCR, all of which were negative.
CT Abd/Pelvis on [**5-2**] was performed for further infectious workup and showed bilateral pleural effusions and presacral soft tissue thickening without fluid collection which was of unclear significance.
She continued to have fevers to 101 and repeat CT scan showed resolution of soft tissue thickening and no other fluid collections or pulmonary findings.
You were found to have acute myelogenous leukemia and were treated with chemotherapy you had a repeat bone marrow biopsy prior to being discharged and the results are pending.
Your course was complicated by a fluid accumulation around the heart (pericardial tamponade) and you were admitted to the intensive care unit where the fluid was removed.
A repeat ultrasound and a cardiac MRI of your heart which showed that the fluid had not reaccumulated.
While your white blood cell count was low, you developed fevers and were treated with antibiotics, no source of fever was identified and the antibiotics were stopped.
