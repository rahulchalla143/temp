Microbiology: - C. diff neg x 9 - Blood cultures neg x 10 - Spinal fluid culture neg - RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2162-7-26**]):       SPARSE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Sensitivity testing performed by Sensititre.
Imaging/diagnostics: - CT chest wo contrast [**7-12**]: Linear opacity in the b/l lungs likely represents atelectasis, but underlying infection cannot be excluded.
Multiple lytic bone lesions involving multiple vertebral bodies/posterior elements, ribs, sternum could represent metastatic disease or multiple myeloma (new since CXR of [**2161-8-18**]).
MRI could be obtained for further evaluation if concern for cord involvement or compression.
d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 9:30 pm.
MRI spine [**7-13**]: Diffuse bone marrow replacement throughout the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine consistent with widespread osseous malignancy, most likely metastatic disease.
On the lateral projection of the thoracic spine, there is loss of vertebral body height and disc space narrowing seen at multiple levels of the mid thoracic spine which correlates with the lytic lesions and compression fracture deformities seen on prior CT and MRI.
ECHO TTE [**7-14**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
CT lumbar spine wo contrast [**7-14**]: Multiple new lytic lesions within the lumbar spine and bony pelvis may represent metastatic disease versus multiple myeloma.
Pathology ([**7-19**]): T3 tumor, corpectomy (A-B): Plasma cell myeloma (see note).
ECHO ([**7-21**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
MRI C, T, L spine ([**7-24**]): CERVICAL SPINE: FINDINGS: Compared to the prior study of [**2162-7-13**], no significant change is seen in the cervical spine.
THORACIC SPINE: The thoracic spine evaluation is significantly limited due to metallic artifacts.
The artifacts limit the evaluation of the spinal canal, but at T3 level, there appears to be mild indentation on the posterolateral aspect of the spinal canal and indentation on the cord with mild narrowing at this level.
At T6 to T8 level, there is no fluid seen in the paraspinal region which could be related to surgery, but CT could help for better assessment given the metallic artifacts limit the evaluation.
Evaluation of the spinal cord signal is limited due to artifacts.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis ([**7-26**]): Large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with bilateral consolidations.
Liver/Gallbladder U/S ([**7-28**]):Borderline echogenic liver, which might be seen with fatty change.
Right pleural effusion, as seen on same-day chest radiograph.
CTA chest w/ and w/o contrast ([**8-13**]): The study is limited due to suboptimal opacification of the pulmonary  arteries.
CTA negative for PE.
Chest CT showed lytic bone lesions in ribs, sternum, spine.
#Multiple Myeloma: Lucency on hip xray prompted tests for total calcium = 10.2, with positive SPEP and UPEP.
CT chest showed diffuse bony lesions.
IgG =6261 (monoclonal IgG lambda) Beta-2 microglobulin = 3.0 Serum Viscosity = 1.9  MRI spine showed compression at level of T3 and involvement of T7 vertebral body.
Spinal surgery was done on [**2162-7-19**], with T7-T8 transpedicular corpectomy, T1-L3 posterior instrumented fusion.
#Hypoxia: LLL opacity on CXR and new onset hypoxia to 87% on RA on admission.
At the time of discharge, patient oxygen saturation 98% on 3L NC.
#Dysphagia: Finding on CT chest [**7-12**] suggest food bolus stuck in esophagus.
Repeat CT chest showed mild esophageal dilation.
At time of discharge, blood pressure had been in the 130-140/60-70 range for one week.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with complaints of chest and back pain, and difficulty breathing.
Your chest xray suggested a left lower lobe pneumonia and compression of your lung space due to restricted breathing.
The compression of your lungs is likely due to shallow breathing from your chest pain.
You did not have a pulmonary blood clot which was confirmed with dopplers which showed no blood clots in your legs and a lung scan that was negative as well.
Your chest pain was attributed to the bone lesions from the multiple myeloma.
