Head CT ([**12-16**]): Intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the right caudate nucleus head, possibly hypertensive in etiology.
The septum pellucidum is displaced 11 mm leftward.

Chest CT :IMPRESSION: 1.
Once the patient's condition has been stabilized, this could be more fully assessed with a dedicated CT trachea study if warranted clinically.
On admission, his exam showed a L hemiparesis.
Right basal ganglia hemorrhage: His history, examination and Head CT findings suggest hypertensive basal ganglia hemorrhage as his pathogenesis.
His hemorrhage has been stable over the course of his hospitalization, confirmed by serial neurological examinations and serial head CTs.
The latest CT on [**12-23**] showed slight decrease in the size of hemorrhage and midline shift.
Upon admission the patient was administered Mannitol 25mg iv q6h and SBP was controlled <160mmHg and MAP<130mmHg.
His neurological examination showed progressive wakefullnes and attention.
His examination showed some expressive language abilities.
Motor function showed bilateral antigravity movement.
His c-spine was cleared with repeated C-spine CT (no fractures) and examination.
A chest CT showed supraglottic asymetric (L>R) edema and tracheobronchomalacia.
ENT was consulted and laryngoscopy was performed, showing mild upper airway edema which was attributed to trauma from intubation.
Repeat laryngoscopy by ENT showed resolving edema.
His blood cultures grew out contaminants (1/12 bottles with cornybacterium).
UTI: The patient was found to have a UTI with urine that grew out klebsiella.
