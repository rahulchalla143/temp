Admission Date:  [**2189-9-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-9-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-11-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12131**] Chief Complaint: pericardial tamponade  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac cath with pericardiocentesis for pericardial effusion/tamponade pericardial window  History of Present Illness: 6yoF with Stage IV non-small cell lung ca metastatic to brain s/p 2 cyberknife treatments and also with L pleurex and severe Parkinson's disease presents s/p urgent pericardiocentesis after echocardiogram showed tamponade.
Patient had echo done this AM, [**2189-9-11**], as ordered by his PCP for peripheral edema (as an outpatient), which showed tamponade.
Via non-invasive measurement, she had a pulsus of 25mmHg at the time, which was 45mmHg when measured invasively (with Aline in R femoral).
Right heart cath showed RAP 20mmHg, RVEDP 20mmHg, PAP 22mmHg, pericardial pressure 20mmHg.
Pericardiocentesis with micropuncture needle under echo guidance was done with pt in upright position.
Ultimately, 120cc bloody pericardial fluid was drained and sent for cytology/culture.
RAP fell to 14mmhg, pericardial pressure fell to 3mmHg, SBP increased from 100mmHg to 150mmHg, and pulsus decreased to 17mmHg.
Post-pericardiocentesis echocardiogram showed no fluid and no signs of tamponade, and the patient was admitted to the CCU.

Pulsus paradox of 45 mm hg all consistent with tamponade physiology.
RA pressure fell to 14 mm hg.
Pericardial pressure of 3 mm Hg.
SBP increased to 150 mm Hg and the pulsus decreased to 17 mm Hg indicating relief of tamponade.
Post procedure ECHO demonstrated removal of all fluid.
[**2189-9-11**] Echo The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function appears grossly normal (LVEF 60%).

# Tamponade:  Patient was admitted from the ECHO lab after routine imaging showed evidence of pericardial effusion of tamponade physiology.
Patient was sent directly to the cath lab where a right heart catheterization confirmed the diagnosis of tamponade with a Pulsus of 45 mg Hg.
# Metastatic NSCLC:  patient was admitted with a known diagnosis of stage IV NSCLC with metastatis to the brain, a large left sided effusion vs collapse on CXR and was s/p cyberknife therapy.
CXR showed complete white out of the left lung suggesting effusion vs. collapse and appeared worse from a prior CXR in [**Month (only) **].
Transitional issues: -cytology and pericardial biopsy were pending at time of transfer -pharmacy has raised concern that dexamethasone and erlotinib have possible interactions and dex taper may need to be shortened.
