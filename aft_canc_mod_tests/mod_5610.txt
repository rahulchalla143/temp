Microbiology: Blood Cultures 11/4 and [**12-21**]: No growth (final) Urine Culture [**12-19**]: No growth (final) Catheter Tip culture [**12-21**]: No growth (final) Influenza DFA [**12-19**]: Negative .
IMAGING: CTA Chest [**2104-12-19**]: The thyroid gland is unremarkable.
Although this examination was not intended for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, the partially imaged abdomen shows a granuloma in the right lobe of the liver and a calcified right adrenal nodule, unchanged.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2104-12-19**]: 1.
TTE [**2104-12-22**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2096-10-12**], the ascending aorta is slightly larger and mild PA systolic hypertension is now identified.
CXR [**2104-12-24**]:  In comparison with the study of [**12-19**], the cardiac silhouette is less prominent and the pulmonary vascularity is substantially improved.
However, he only required pressors transiently, and his blood pressure improved significantly with fluid resuscitation.
A morning cortisol was low, as was a cortisol stimulation test, raising concern for adrenal insufficiency.
Workup included urine culture, blood cultures, influenza DFA, CT abdomen and pelvis and CTA chest.
Additionally, the patient underwent TTE to evaluate for culture negative endocarditis, and no vegetations were seen.
He was ruled out for PE, and cardiac enzymes were negative.
He did have subtle ECG changes when he was hypotensive on admission, and he might benefit from repeat stress testing with imaging as an outpatient.
# Anemia - The patient had a Hct drop from 36 to 31; this was felt to be multifactorial from dilution after fluid resuscitation, phlebotomy and ongoing hematuria related to prostate cancer and recent prostate biopsy.
CXR showed interstitial edema and he received several doses of oral furosemide with good urine output.
At discharge, his oxygen requirement had resolved and his ambulatory O2 saturation was in the mid-90s.
