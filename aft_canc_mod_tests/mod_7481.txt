[**2110-1-1**] CXR : In comparison with the study of [**12-29**] and [**12-30**], there is again relatively the lower expansion of the left hemithorax.
Areas of loculated air and fluid are again seen on the left, though comparison is difficult since the current study is supine rather than [**Last Name (LF) 92555**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] that the air-fluid levels are not appreciated.
