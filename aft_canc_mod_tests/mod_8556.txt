U/A on admission did not show signs of infection and CXR was clear.
Urinalysis showed moderate bacteria, with 13 WBCs, +nitrites.

Platelets dropped to as low as 46 during this admission which was concerning for HIT.
HIT antibody was positive, and patient was started on argatroban drip.
Further information from HIT antibody revealed an optical density of 0.55, only weakly positive so low probability of being true positive.
Peripheral smear showed evidence of abnormal WBCs and nucleated RBCs concerning for MDS.
A serotonin release assay was sent as confirmatory test of HIT.
Creatinine remained around [**Last Name (STitle) 5348**] throughout the remainder of admission.
