The pathology was negative for cancer; however, she was recommended to have the lesion surgically remove due to the risk for converting to carcinoma.

On POD1 the patient developed hypotension and bradycardia with blood pressures as low as 60's/40'2 with a heart rate in the low 50s despite being completely asymptomatic.
She was aggressively resuscitated with IV fluids and were stabilized overnight with blood pressures in the 120s-140s.
On POD 2 she had blood pressures in the normal range but continued to have very loose/watery bowel movements over 20 times that day.
The patient remained afebrile and C.diff cultures were negative.
UrCx and BlCx were positive for GNRs (aerobic and anaerobic) and she was started on cefepime/flagyl.
POD 4 she underwent barium enema with fluoroscopy and was found to have a colonic leak at/near the site of anastomosis.
Her WBC became elevated and remained elevated despite antibiotic therapy; chest xray was negative for pulmonary causes of infection, but urine studies were positive for a coagulase negative staph sensitive to vancomycin.
She stayed on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl but continued to have persistent elevated WBC; a CT scan of her pelvis revealed a pericolic abscess that could be the culprit.
On POD 11 white blood count decreased to 16.0 and she was transitioned to PO augmentin.
CT guided drainage of the pericolic abscess was placed on hold indefinitely as she remained asymptomatic with downtrending WBC.
Wound culture of Ms. [**Known lastname 92754**] incision grew enterococcus, susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin; she will continue augmenting for a total of 3 weeks.
*Try to maintain ostomy output between 1000mL to 1500mL per day.
*If ostomy output exceeds 1 liter, take 4mg of Imodium, repeat 2mg with each episode of loose stool.
If your blood test is too high, you might be at risk for bleeding problems.
Your doctor has decided on a range on the blood test that is right for you.
The blood test used for monitoring is called an INR.
