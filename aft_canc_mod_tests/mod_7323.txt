Hypotension/GNR sepsis: The patient had his ERCP on [**9-7**] after which he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (Amp/Gent/Levo).
That evening his blood pressure was found to be 80/50.
He was given 1.5 liters of fluid and his BP imrpoved to 90/60.
His HCT was stable and he remained afebrile.
Blood cultures were sent, and the following day 3/4 bottles grew out gram negative rods (klebsiella, serratia) which were pan sensitive.
However, on [**9-8**] a CXR showed pulmonary edema/CHF and IV fluids were discontinued.
Biliary obstruction: The patient initally had a total bilirubin of 19.7 on [**9-7**], prior to his ERCP.
Post ERCP his total bilirubin rose to 21.8 on [**9-9**].
He was discharged with a total bilirubin of 17.9, possibly a new baseline for this patient per ERCP.
Respiratory: The patient had a difficult lung exam secondary to poor air movement.
Crackles were auscultated in the right mid lung upon transfer to the floor, and the following day a CXR was ordered to better evaluate the lungs; it showed stable nodules (mets) but also seemed c/w pulmonary edema.
The patient was discharged with a stable respiratory exam and good oxygen saturations.
Adrenal Insufficiency:  Cosyntropin stimulation test on [**9-7**] was positive for adrenal insufficiency.
On [**9-10**] his pain regimen was changed: his oxycontin was increased to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] and his morphine IV was switched to oxycodone orally for breakthrough.
Anemia: The patient had a chronic anemia with a hematocrit in the low 30s for several months.
Prior to this, in [**2171**], his hematocrit was normal.
His hematocrit was followed during his hospitalization and was stable.
He was discharged with a HCT of 35.4.
He was discharged with a creatinine of 1.1; earlier in the hospitalization it had been as low as 0.6 though pre-ERCP, the morning of [**9-7**], it had been 1.3.
Gentamycin was thought to perhaps have played a role in the creatinine bump from 0.6 to 1.1 so it was discontinued and ciprofloxacin started as above.
His anticoagulation was not reinitiated on discharge, but may be in the future as an outpatient.
PVCs: The patient had what was thought to be an irregular heart beat, therefore, and EKG was checked revealing sinus rhythm with PVCs.
IVF was discontinued when his CXR showed evidence of pulmonary edema (see above).
