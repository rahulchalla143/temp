REPORTED BY PHONE TO DR [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 29968**] [**Numeric Identifier 29969**] [**2195-8-9**] 910AM.
IMAGING: [**2195-8-7**] CXR 1.
The team considered aspiration PNA to be the most likely diagnosis, although PE was also considered (but patient's INR was supratherapeutic).
The gram stains on his blood cultures came back with GPCs in [**3-1**] bottles.
At that time, his blood cultures were growing enterococcus (Vanc-sensitive).
CXR showed progressing PNA.
His INR was supratherapeutic at 6.2, and his coumadin was held.
Coumadin was restarted at 1mg daily (home dose), and at the time of discharge, his INR was 1.8.
Still with some LV hypokinesis and mod decrease in LV function with EF 40-45%.
Patient's Hct was stable throughout stay.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with trouble swallowing and you were found to have an infection, which is most likely in your lungs due to aspiration.
