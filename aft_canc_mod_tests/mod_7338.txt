A workup ensued and found her to have biliary obstruction on account of a mass in the head of her pancreas.
This mass was ultimately visualized by CAT scan and seemed to be a resectable lesion.
It was finally analyzed by endoscopic ultrasound and a biopsy of this proved adenocarcinoma.

Imaging: [**2187-8-22**] Abdominal x-ray: FINDINGS: Study is suboptimal secondary to patient body habitus and patient motion.
In the PACU, the patient was noted to be tachycardic with a SBP in the 90's and a urine output averaging 10-15mL/Hr.
Immediate post-operative HCT was 37.
Serial hematocrits were followed, which progressively declined to a low of 24.1 by 1am on POD#1.
EKGs and cardiac enzymes were negative x2.
She received 2units of PRBCs and her HCT improved to 31.
Her pressures, however, remained in the 80s to mid 90s, despite being on two pressors.
She also became progressively acidemic, with her pH going from 7.2 to 7.13, with a base defecit of -12 and lactate of 9.
JP amylase was sent in the evening of  POD#6; the JP was discontinued on POD#7 as the output and amylase level were low.
The patient's blood sugar was monitored regularly throughout the stay; sliding scale insulin was administered when indicated, but the patient did not require insulin for home discharge.
