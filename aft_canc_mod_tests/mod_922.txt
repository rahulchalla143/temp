Pt coughed up sputum this am after waking (normal for him) but + blood clots, x 5 today, totaling [**1-20**] cup.
Chest CT today showed chronic PEs, mucoid impaction in right bronchus, and unchanged mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy.

Hematocrit and Cr were stable during this admission.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-1-28**], no major change is evident.
Chest CT [**5-27**]: 1.
Right adrenal nodule, which cannot be further characterized on this examination.
CXR [**5-27**]: 1.
[**5-31**]: Biopsy of R lung mass: Lung, right lower lobe, biopsy:  Organizing hemorrhage and scant bronchial tissue with squamous metaplasia; no malignancy identified.
[**2149-6-1**]: CXR: IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to chest films since [**5-27**], most recently [**6-1**] at 11:08 a.m.
Right ventricular pacer defibrillator and right atrial and ventricular pacer leads unchanged in their respective positions.
Right bronchial arteriography through the microcatheter was performed at two stations to confirm on going patency and inflow of blood into the bronchial artery, which was present.
CT images show multiple paratracheal/precarinal lymph nodes which have FDG avidity similar to the remainder to the mediastinum.
Sensitivity of examination for detection of neoplasm is slightly decreased due to the redistribution of FDG to the skeletal muscles.
[**6-12**]: CT Head with Contrast: CONCLUSION:  No significant changes since [**2148-12-20**].
Note that MR with contrast is more sensitive than CT for detecting metastasis .
[**6-12**]: CT Chest, Abdomen and Pelvis with Contrast: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is an apparent right-sided infrahilar mass which is seen compressing the right lower lobe bronchus and arteries and extends into the subcarinal region.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is an IVC filter in place.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no abnormal lymphadenopathy within the pelvis.
MICRO: URINE CULTURE (Final [**2149-6-6**]):       Culture workup discontinued.
Further incubation showed contamination       with mixed skin/genital flora.
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..          IMIPENEM sensitivity testing performed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3077**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3060**].
The patient underwent CT scan in the ED, which showed encasement of the right pulmonary artery/bronchus by a lung mass on admission.
A PPD was checked and warfarin was discontinued.
On HD #3 decision was made to defer bronchoscopy due to elevated INR.
On HD #4, he was taken for bronchoscopy with 2 units FFP pre-procedure (INR was 1.9.)
During the flexible bronchoscopy, he was found to have significant bleeding and his R bronchus intermedius was occluded by a blood clot, which could not be aspirated.
HD #[**8-27**]: In the interim, he has been oxygenating well on the floor (92-98% on 2-3L), his hct has been stable to the order of 28-29.
His biopsy returned as organizing thrombus.
At the beginning of the bronchoscopy, his SBP dropped to 60 in the setting of being started on propfol and remifentanyl and then his BPs responded to neo which was weaned off neo easily.
He underwent the transbronchial needle aspiration and biopsy and argon plasma coagulation procedure;  during the procedure, he was noted to have massive hemoptysis.
HD #[**10-31**]: Monitored in the MICU where he continued to oxygenate well and remained stable.
HD #15: Underwent embolization of R bronchial artery supplying superior segment of RLL.
HD #17: Underwent staging CT Head, Chest, Abdomen/Pelvis and PET-CT. See Results section for CT scan findings.
His PET CT suffered from diminished sensitivity because patient ate prior to scan.
Hence, he could be upgraded to a Stage IV if his PET scan scheduled as an outpatient shows distant metastasis.
- B12, folate wnl - low iron, increased ferritin, low transferrin c/w anemia of chronic disease -> hence no benefit of Fe supplementation.
chronic PEs/DVTs: - s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter.
Blood cultures were negative, but his urine culture grew out Enterobacter which was sensitive to Ceftriaxone.
Rate / Rhythm: Has BiV pacer, ICD - Dig level 1.1 - no events on tele while in house .
Pump: - continue carvedilol - Daily weights, I/Os, 1.5L fluid restriction - lasix was held during this admission.
Hyperthyroidism: Patient had a history of hyperthyoridism, but on admission , his TSH 21, T4 0.6, T3 78  - this was consistent with hypothyroidism.
An endo outpt f/u arranged for [**Month (only) **].
# L heel ulcer: - daily dressing changes - multipodus splints and vitamin C/Zinc .
- not currently on colchicine - was on 0.6mg QD at home.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**1-20**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed.
Insulin Regular Human 100 unit/mL Solution Sig: Per scale units Injection every six (6) hours: glc 150-200=2 units; 201-250=4units; 251-300=6units; 301-350=8 units; 351-400=10 units.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Followup Instructions: You have an appointment for another PET/CT imaging scan of your chest on Wednseday [**6-18**] at noon, [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] building [**Location (un) **].
