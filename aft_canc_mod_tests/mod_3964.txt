Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 27 mmHg in the setting of moderate to severe  systemic arterial hypertension.
There was evidence of moderate pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of 50/18/30.
The cardiac output was mildly reduced at 4.3 L/min.
Left ventriculography was not performed due to the patient's elevated filling pressures and recent non-invasive assessment of his underlying LVEF.
Distal aortography demonstrated moderate distal aortic disease as well as disease in the external iliacs.
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**Name11 (NameIs) 900**] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].
At cath, he was found to have 3VD and markedly elevated filling pressures with a wedge of 27 and moderate pulmonary hypertension and a IABP was placed in hopes that the patient would go the CABG.
Echo on admission revealed severe LV global hypokinesis.
His ACE-I and BB can be titrated up as his blood pressure and kidney function will tolerate.
Congestive Heart Failure - Given patients elevated filling pressures and chest x-ray consistent with failure, patient was diuresed in house.
He received a DDI pacer with a lower rate of 50 bpm and an ICD.
Since his mental status was unstable and it was felt that he would not be able to corporate with a colonoscopy or EGD, he was taken for a virtual colonoscopy which revealed a thickened area of his sigmoid colon.
He again had melana on [**10-5**] and his HCT dropped to 26.
He was transfused 1 unit and had an EGD and colonoscopy which showed gastritis and two non-bleeding angioectasias which were cauterized.
He will need to be on a high fiber diet as an outpatient and have a repeat colonoscopy in 5 years.
He should continue Protonix and have H. Pylori serologies checked as an outpatient.
Repeat ABGs did not revelad significant hypoxia or hypercarbia.
Sputum culture demonstrated MRSA.
His lung exam markedly improved and he was breathing with a O2 sat in the high 90s on room air.
Acute vs. chronic renal insufficency - The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.2, with his baseline unknown.
Over the last week of his hospital stay, his creatinine decreased to 1.6.
His hematocrit was 27 on day of discharge and he was transfused 1 unit.
