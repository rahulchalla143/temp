In addition, has been having visual hallucinations which he describes as appearing like a flying rubiks cube with wings and a light inside.
In the ED initial vitals were: temperature 97.6 F, pulse 73, blood pressure 124/87, respiration 15, or 98% in room air.
His laboratory values are notable for glucose 506 and an anion gap of 16.
His urinalysis shows glucose >1000 with presence of ketones.
He was given 5 units insulin for blood sugar of 502 SQ, spoke with attending and will give 10 units more prior to transfer.
CT head: there is a right frontal hypodensity 3.7 cm x 4.7 cm consistent with glioblastoma.
Vital signs on transfer: temperature 97.8 F, pulse 75, respiration 20, blood pressure 132/100, and 02 saturation 97% in room air.

Seizure frequency continued to decrease on the floor and as of the night of [**2125-8-13**] EEG monitoring revealed no more seizure activity through the time he was dischaerged home.
- Patient's home labetolol and clonidine were held on discharge as patient's BP has been stable off of BP meds while in house and pt has been bradycardic with heart rate consistently in the 40s.
Information was obtained from webOMR.
