At time of transfer, VSS w/ BP 111/56, HR90, RR18, T97.3, O2 sat 77%?.
During that admission she underwent EGD which showed four areas of AVMs in body of stomach and fundus which were anticoagulated with Argon beam.
In the ED, initial vs were: HR 95 BP 80/40 (triage), 106/58 repeat RR 30 O2 sat 99% RA.
Exam was notable for diffuse abdominal tenderness w/o peritoneal signs and melanotic stools in diaper.
Labs notable for hct of 19.3 (baseline 23) and WBC 12.4; BUN 69, creatinine 0.8.
Potassium was 5.9 with slightly peaked T waves on EKG, for which she received D50, insulin and calcium gluconate w/ improvement to 4.7.
KUB was performed which showed normal placement of PEG and CXR with worsened R pleural effusion.
Patient underwent CT Abd/Pelvis which was notable for new large retroperitoneal mass engulfing aorta, SMA, celiac, and renal arteries, as well as IVC and left portal vein thromboses.
VS on transfer were: 99.0, 90, 105/50, 18, 99% RA.

GI was consulted and an EGD was performed on [**8-11**] which revealed an ulcer around the G-tube.
She underwent a video swallow study.
Her hematocrit remained stable with eating.
If repeat Hct check after discharge is stable her home aspirin can be re-started.
# Retroperitoneal mass - A CT Abdomen and Pelvis performed on admission showed an impressive RP mass engulfing the aorta, SMA, celiac and renal arteries.
The CT also showed IVC and left portal vein thrombosis of unknown chronicity.
Per discussion with the patient's sister (her HCP), this was actually not a new mass but had been discovered by her oncologist at [**Hospital1 3278**] [**Hospital1 336**].
There was no fever or cough, and CXR showed only chronic right pleural effusion.
Cultures were sent to rule out infectious origin; these were negative at the time of discharge.
C. Diff stool toxin was checked twice and was negative both times.
A stool C.diff PCR is pending at the time of discharge, but her diarrhea improved significantly with adjustment of her tube feeding regimen.
Abx were not started as pt appeared asymptomatic.
A repeat UA and urine culture were sent after Foley was replaced and these were within normal limits.
Her Hct was monitored in light of bleeding.
She received a total of 2 units PRBCs during her stay, and responded well to these transfusions.
Pt was DNR/DNI, confirmed with HCP [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Name (NI) 284**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103891**], cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103894**])  Medications on Admission: Admission Medications (per nursing home records): levothyroxine 50 mcg Tablet PO DAILY lovenox 70 mg q12hr aspirin 81 mg ipratropium bromide 0.02 % 1 Neb q6HRs PRN albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) 1 neb Q6H prn bisacodyl 10 mg PR prn percocet 1-2 tabs q4hr prn lactulose 15 mL daily PRN famotidine 40 mg NG qHS loperamide 2 mg PO TID prn simvastatin 20 mg PO daily atenolol 50 mg PO DAILY multivitamin 1 Tablet PO DAILY ferrous sulfate 300 mg (60 mg iron) po Daily sertraline 50 mg NG daily senna 8.6 mg Capsule PO BID PRN docusate sodium 100 mg PO BID acetaminophen 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]   Discharge Medications: 1. sertraline 50 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
This should be restarted if your blood count remains stable.
A stool test was sent that is pending at the time of discharge and will need to be followed-up.
