CT scan showed a new 2.6 cm isodense lesion with a hypodense rim of right liver lobe anteriorly.
A repeat CT scan on [**2109-7-23**], demonstrated a 2.5-cm enhancing mass in the inferior aspect of the right lobe suspicious for neoplasm.
A CT guided liver biopsy was performed on [**8-2**] and showed a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.
She was referred to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  in Oncology who then referred the patient to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] who had performed an ERCP in [**2107**] for choledocholithiasis.
A chest CT did not show evidence of pulmonary metastases.
An abdominal CT demonstrated a 3.0 x 3.0 cm heterogeneous lesion within segment 5 of the liver where there is an arterial enhancement and subtle delayed phase washout consistent with biopsy-proven HCC.
Her LFTs were: AST 20, ALT 12, alk  phos 50, total bili 0.3, AFP 1.7 and CA19-9 6.
Hepatitis serologies were all nonreactive.
The patient underwent further workup in preparation for surgical resection.
PFTs were obtained because of her extensive smoking history, and showed: FEV1 of 0.86 (76% predicted), FVC 1.39 (77% predicted) and FEV1:FVC 62 (99% predicted).
A dipyridamole stress thallium demonstrated normal myocardial perfusion with no areas of ischemia.
An echocardiogram was obtained and showed mild pulmonary hypertension with pressures of 44 mmHg and with a normal EF of 65%.
