On chest CT Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] was noted to have bilateral pulmonary opacities whose appearance appeared most consistent with a fungal process, especially given his continued fevers on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
On transfer all of his microbiological diagnostic workup had been negative.
EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER:  Temperature is 97.4, T-max is 101.3 20 hours before transfer, his pulse ranges from 100 to 150s, blood pressure ranges 130s to 160s/60s to 70s, oxygen saturation is 91 to 94% on 40% face mask.
Cardiovascular exam is tachycardiac; irregularly irregular; no murmurs.
LABORATORY DATA ON TRANSFER:  His labs on transfer were notable for white blood cell count of 0.4, platelet count of 20, hematocrit of 34.4, and an absolute neutrophil count of 240.
His Chem-7 was notable for sodium 132, potassium 3.2, chloride of 96, bicarbonate 24, BUN 29, creatinine of 1.3, and glucose of 127.
His repeat sodium and potassium are 134 and 4.0.
His AST was 41, ALT 46, alkaline phosphatase 95, total bilirubin 1.0, albumin 3.5, calcium 8.5, phosphorous 2.7, magnesium 1.9, Vancomycin peak was 27.6.
It was felt that his rapid atrial fibrillation was likely secondary to the pulmonary infiltrates noted on his chest CT scan and that the pulmonary process was causing his irregular rhythm.
Unfortunately, Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] became hypotensive with both blood pressure and rate control agents on board and these agents had to be discontinued.
On the morning of [**2173-3-23**] with the Digoxin on board, Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] [**Last Name (Titles) 19065**] to normal sinus rhythm with the rate in the 60s.
Clinically, Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] appeared to improve with decreasing respiratory rate and improved oxygen saturations with decreasing oxygen requirements.
Oxygen enabled him to maintain oxygen saturations however, a repeat chest CT was done on [**2173-3-23**] to reassess a worsened chest x-ray.
The chest CT scan on [**2173-3-23**] showed marked progression of bilateral ill defined pulmonary nodular opacities throughout all lobes becoming more confluent at the left base.
CT scan was done to evaluate for a hemorrhagic infarct.
The head CT scan showed a subacute right MCA infarct.
Given that Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] was thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 14, his anticoagulation had been on hold.
Per Neurology he was initially started on Neo-Synephrine with intravenous fluids to maintain his systolic blood pressure in the 140s.
Further consult opinion could just slightly lower Mr. [**Known lastname 19064**] target blood pressure as long as his neurologic symptoms did not worsen.
He had a CT of his abdomen which showed hypoattenuation in his spleen.
Coupled with the progression of his chest CT, which was noted several days later, Infectious Disease service was also concerned that the hypoattenuation area could be invasive Aspergillosis.
Acute renal failure:  On transfer to the Intensive Care Unit Mr. [**Known lastname 19064**] creatinine was 1.3.
During his hospital stay his renal function deteriorated with a creatinine up to 2.1.
Over next several days his creatinine did improve to 1.7, which was the creatinine at the time of this dictation.
Once his platelet count was over 50, Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] was restarted on his aspirin for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease.
He should be restarted as his blood pressure improves and he stabilizes and his acute renal failure improves.
His platelets were monitored and he was transfused when his hematocrit dropped below 30 given that he had history of coronary artery disease.
