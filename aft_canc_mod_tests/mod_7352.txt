AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is a metallic tracheostomy tube.
Her cardiac enzymes were negative x 3.
LENI's were negative making PE less likely.
No V/Q was done because her CXR was poor quality because of the finding of consolidation vs atelectasis.
CTA was not obtained because the patient has renal failure and PE was not high on the differential.
Echo showed preserved EF and no wall abnormalities, making a cardiac process unlikely as etiology for the event.
Her telemetry showed no events that might have indicated a rhythm abnormality.
She was gently diuresed as some of her CXR findings and exam were consistent with CHF.
* COPD: The patient had wheezes on exam and evidence of infection.
On the day of discharge the patient's urine culture came back positive E.coli resistant to Levaquin.
Iron studies did not show iron, B12, or folate deficiency * DISPO: The patient was discharged home with close follow up.

Chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6)   Discharge Condition: Good, vitals stable   Discharge Instructions: Please seek medical services immediately if you should have any chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills or any other worrisome symptom.
