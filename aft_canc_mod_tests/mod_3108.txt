The patient continues to show evidence of bilateral lower lobe processes on chest x-ray and had physical findings in those areas as well suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
Chest x-ray was rechecked, which showed the possibility of another aspiration event mostly seen in the right lower lobe.
Blood cultures and urine cultures are negative to date from that previous spike to 101.
Since then his hematocrit has remained stable at around 30.
It is recommended that while at rehab his hematocrit is followed and that he is transfused if he drops below 25 as he has no history of coronary artery disease.
The patient is instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] three weeks after discharge with AP and lateral C spine films prior to that appointment.
