For serious infections, repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted if third generation cephalosporins were used.

CTA Torso [**2199-3-13**]: 1.
MRI lumbar spine [**2199-3-13**] Widespread metastatic infiltrative bone disease involving the lumbar spine, sacrum, and visualized lower T11 and 12 vertebral bodies without evidence of thecal compression or neural compromise.
Metastasis at the L5 vertebral body is increased, almost involving 80% of the L5 body.
CXR [**2199-3-21**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
EGD [**2199-3-19**]: Impression: Esophagitis at the GE junction Gastritis with edema and thickened gastric folds suggesting extrinsic compression but cannot exclude tumor infiltration (biopsy) Duodenitis of the bulb and 2nd part of the duodenum Deformity due to extrinsic compression of the duodenal bulb and second part of the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: The findings account for the symptoms Await pathology results Extrinsic compression at the duodenum is not amenable to duodenal stenting Further management per inpatient team   Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo M with Stage IV Gallbladder CA diagnosed in [**1-10**] most recently treated with FOLFIRI (cycle 4 on [**2199-2-13**]) who presented to ED with fever to 103, weakness, and hypotension .
His blood pressure normalized within the first 6 hours of his ICU stay.
# Fever: Blood cultures drawin in the ED on arrival rapidly returned with gram negative rods in one of two bottles.
His BCx grew out enterobacter that was cipro sensitive.
CT abdomen on arrival was concerning for SMA syndrome vs obstruction related to metastatic disease vs functional obstruction.
He was seen by GI after he was transferred to the oncology medicine floor, and an EGD was done on [**3-19**] which showed he was not a duodenal stent candidate.
Prior CT revealed obstructed metallic stent.
He was taken for MRI of lumbar spine which revealed progression of metastatic disease; however no spinal cord compression or evidence of cauda equina syndrome.
On discharge, he will need visiting nurse/hospice to continue to drain the catheter weekly.
# Right renal hydronephrosis: Admission CT abdomen showed right hydronephrosis without stone related to ureter compression from mass.
Creatinine was at baseline.
He was reluctant to do so and got 2nd opinion at [**Hospital3 328**] who had similar recommendations regarding hospice care.
# Anemia:  related to chronic disease, HCT was stable throughout hospital stay.
