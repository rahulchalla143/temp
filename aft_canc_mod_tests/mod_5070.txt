[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - normal; mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal; basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral - normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex - normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV hypertrophy.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
An epiaortic exam revealed no significant athermoa at the planned sites of cannulation, cross clamping, or proximal graft anastamosis.
Peak gradients on the mitral valve ranged from [**3-16**] with mean gradients of [**1-9**].
The remaining exam is unchanged.
Cross clamp time was 175 min, total bypass time was 220 mins.
His INR will be checked by the VNA on Mon., Wed., and Fri. and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12593**] will follow his coumadin dosing.
