Bone Marrow biopsy was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**6-15**] to reassess disease.
CBC Diff shows ~14% blasts which is elevated from prior, but counts 4 days ago showed 12% blasts.
Pt started induction chemotherapy on Tuesday [**2153-6-19**] with MEC which was dose reduced and given with HD support with the renal team.
He was incidentally found to have asymptomatic coag neg staph bacteremia in multiple BCx bottles and his chemo was stopped so he only received 3/5 doses.
Due to hypotension and fevers >103 he was sent to the ICU overnight with broad spectrum abx and pressors.
The remainder of his neuro exam was nonfocal.
He underwent CT head noncon which was neg for bleed or acute process.
An LP was performed which only showed RBCs with minimal WBCs (however given the pt's neutropenia it is unclear that he would mount a response).
His viral studies, Cxs, and flow were non contributory, acyclovir was switched back to prophylactic dosing.
On discharge he continued to be platelet and blood transfusion dependent, and will have frequent followups and count checks in outpatient clinic to transfuse as necessary.
Pulm was initially consulted as the pt was noted to have small nodules in his chest CT that were read as concern for 'acute infx' although per pulm consult team and ID it was thought to be low likely.
The pt's cough was stable and he was continued on his home PPI as well as Voriconazole.
Patient's basline creatinine 3.0-3.5 after temporarily requiring dialysis with previous induction therapy for AML in [**2151**].
As noted above the pt had HD support with his MEC doses which were also renally dosed.
Creatinine continued to drop and was at 2.2 on the day of discharge.
