Her symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain raised suspicion for an intrabdominal source, however her R PICC line was notably painful and erythematous and therefore thought to be the most likely source of infection.
She was transferred to the BMT floor where an upper extremity doppler ultrasound revealed total occlusion of the axillary vein extending into the cephalic vein.
TTE was obtained and did not reveal any valvular vegetations.
Prior to discharge, a nephrostogram revealed caudal stenosis, and was the tube was capped and left in place.
Stool cultures were negative for cyptococcus, giardia, microsporidia.
CT scan revealed perinephric fat stranding .
Bone marrow aspirate revealed wide spread infiltration with blast cells and peripheral smear prior to discharge revealed 10% blast cells.
