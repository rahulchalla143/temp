She was taken to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital where a CT scan showed a right renal mass.
A CTA and chest x- ray showed signs of CHF.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and she was given 20 of hydralazine as well as Lasix.
While she was on the floor, her blood pressure continued to remain elevated.
Her hydralazine was used only in cases of elevated blood pressure when the Lasix and her verapamil did not decrease her systolic blood pressure to less than 150.
She was ruled out for a myocardial infarction by having negative cardiac enzymes and negative CK MB and negative troponin x3.
A repeat EKG was also normal.
An echocardiogram was obtained on her third postoperative day, sixth hospital day, and that was negative.
A stress test was also obtained 2 days later and that was also negative for any heart disease.
Her blood cultures, urine cultures showed no growth through her day of discharge and she had mild fevers which was expected secondary to her embolization procedure.
