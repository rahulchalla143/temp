Later the chest pain came back and was more severe.
He underwent CPR for PEA arrest.
Upon arrival to the EW, chest compressions were in progress.
A rhythm check showed VFib rhythm and the patient was shocked.
Another cycle of chest compressions were given and the patient again was shocked with return of spontaneous circulation.
At times a wide complex tachycardia developed which cardiology evaluated and thought was secodnary to rate related right bundle branch block.
All EKG were evaluated by interventional cardiology attending and were not thought to be consistent with acute myocardial ischemia.
Due to this TTE was done which by report showed mildly dilated RA and RV with normokinesis and normal left ventricular function.
The patient had a CT Torso with contrast which was negative for pulmonary embolus or other acute event.
CT head was done which was negative for acute process as well although could not rule out mets.
His vitals on transfer were HR 88 and BP 137/75.

CT head [**1-6**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CTA Torso [**1-6**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**1-7**] ECHO: Conclusions Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
CXR [**1-7**]: FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in standard position.
Biapical scarring is difficult to compare to prior studies due to patient rotation.
Attention to this area on non-rotated standard PA and lateral chest radiograph prior to discharge would be helpful to ensure similar appearance to older radiographs.

You underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of one stent.
You also had a CT scan to check for blood clots in the lungs, which was normal.
MEDICATION CHANGES: - START Aspirin 325 mg daily - START Prasugrel 10 mg daily - START Metoprolol succinate 25mg daily - START Simvastatin 40mg by mouth daily - START Nitroglycerin sublingual 0.4mg tablet at the onset of chest pain, may repeat after 5 mins if continued pain ***This medication can cause low blood pressure.
Do NOT take this with any erectile dysfunction medications as this can cause an unsafe drop in blood pressure.
