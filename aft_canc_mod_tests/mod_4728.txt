INR, which stands for International Normalized Ratio, is a blood test that helps determine the right warfarin dose for you.
A high INR means you are more likely to bleed (your blood does not clot very fast).
All patients will have an INR goal depending on their medical condition(s), yours is [**2-12**].
Plan ahead when traveling by having enough warfarin and arrange for follow-up blood tests.
