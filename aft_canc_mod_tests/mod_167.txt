RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2170-12-19**]):       RARE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
Hepatitis serologies ([**2170-12-13**])- HBsAg negative, HBs Ab negative, HBc Ab negative, HAV Ab negative, IgM HAV negative  IMAGING: CXR [**2170-12-13**]: IMPRESSION: Subtle minimal ill-defined opacity within the right lung base may reflect an area of developing infection.
ECHO [**2170-12-14**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
CXR [**2170-12-15**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
The spinal cord demonstrates areas of high signal intensity on the fat suppression sequence, more evident at C2, C3 and C5 levels, likely consistent with demyelinating plaques.
Head CT [**2170-12-25**] Final Report INDICATION: 64-year-old male with MS presents with coagulopathy, respiratory distress and mental status change.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain without IV contrast.
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A tiny amount of hyperdense material is seen in a right frontal sulcus (2:20) and a right temporal sulcus (2:14) concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: In retrospect, the diffusely abnormal hyperintensity on the FLAIR sequences from the MR examination of [**2170-12-21**] was in the subarachnoid space, rather than cortically-based (as reported).
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
HEAD CT [**2170-12-26**] CLINICAL INFORMATION: 64-year-old male with MDS and MS, found to have intracranial hemorrhage and altered mental status, for followup.
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were acquired of the head without contrast and reformatted into coronal and sagittal planes.
Subtle hyperdensity within multiple sulci, likely reflecting resorption and redistribution of the diffuse subarachnoid blood seen on the MR study of [**2170-12-21**] is unchanged from the NECT obtained only 10 hours earlier.
There has been further ventricular dilatation since the remote MR study of [**2163-2-12**], but this more likely reflects progressive global, including central atrophy, rather than developing hydrocephalus.
BONE MARROW BIOPSY Cell culture was established to provide metaphase cells for chromosome analysis.
-------------------INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300 CELLS-------------------   nuc ish(D7Z1,D7S522)x1[43/100], (EGR1x1,D5S23/D5S721x2)[30/100],(D8Z1x2),(D20S108x2)[100] FISH evaluation for a 7q deletion was performed with the Vysis LSI D7S522/CEP7 Dual Color Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for D7S522 at 7q31 and CEP7 (D7Z1) (chromosome 7 alpha satellite DNA) at 7p11.1-q11.1 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
FISH evaluation for a 5q deletion was performed with the Vysis LSI EGR1/D5S23, D5S721 Dual Color Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for EGR1 at 5q31 and D5S721/D5S23 at 5p15.2 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
FISH evaluation for a chromosome 8 aneuploidy was performed with the D8Z2 DNA Probe (chromosome 8 alpha satellite DNA) ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 8p11.1- q11.1 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
FISH evaluation for a 20q deletion was performed with the Vysis LSI D20S108 Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 20q12 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
Note: The findings are highly suspicious for a myelodysplastic disorder best classified as refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB-2) based on the number of myeloblasts in the peripheral blood (a marrow aspirate could not be obtained) and the core biopsy immunostained with CD34.
However, given the clinical presentation of the patient with severe anemia and acute high output cardiac failure the findings in this marrow need to be interpreted with caution and a follow up biopsy is highly recommended, unless cytogenetic studies confirm myelodysplastic syndrome or other related myeloproloferative disorder.
The white cell count is decreased.
Multiple nucleated red blood cells are seen (50% of nucleated cells) and exhibit significant dyspoiesis including asymmetric nuclear budding, nuclear fragments and cytoplasmic nuclear dy synchrony.
Differential shows 54% neutrophils, 2% bands, 18% lymphocytes, 7% monocytes, 2% eosinophils, 4% basophils; 12% blasts and 1% myelocytes.
Biopsy and clot sections: Two cores are received both measuring 9mm in length.
Special Stains:  A CD34 stain highlights blasts comprising 10-20% of the marrow cellularity.
Previous biopsies:   	[**-1/5104**]  BON E MARROW CORE BX ILIAC CREST (1 JAR)   FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT  FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR, Glycophorin A, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11c, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 33, 34, 41, 56, 64, 71, 117.
One population is slightly dimmer than lymphocytes for CD45 and exhibits a phenotype consistent with myeloblasts (positive for CD45, CD34, CD33, CD11c, CD117 (dim), CD15, CD13 and are negative for CD14, CD41, CD56, CD64, and glycophorin.
A second population which express only low levels of CD45 lacks all lymphoid and myeloid markers but is positive for CD71 and glycophorin-a and represent erythroblasts.
Please correlate with the morphologic findings in the marrow biopsy and a blast count.
Note: This test was performed using analyte specific reagents (ASRs).
Differential included PE (patient with DVT found on LE ultrasound), transfusion associated circulatory overload [**2-14**] to rapid multiple transfusions, and less likely pneumonia.
CXR revealed a diffuse bilateral pattern.
Extubation was performed on HD 5, however patient was extremely tachypnic and required re-intubation.
Fluid was consistent with transudate and culture was negative.
A CTA was deferred given patient's initial acute kidney injury.
Blood pressures remained low normal throughout his hospitalization.
His systolic blood pressures were in the 100-110s at the time of discharge.
Bone marrow biopsy showed MDS with erythroblasts without evidence of leukemia.
Viral studies negative for CMV, HSV, HIV, EBV, and parvovirus.
An [**Month/Day (2) 4338**] was performed which showed increased numbers of plaques compared to [**Month/Day (2) 4338**] from [**2163**].
EKG showed an SVT (most likely AVNRT).
During theses episodes his blood pressure decreased to SBP of high 80s.
Each time he was given adenosine 6 mg once with return of sinus rhythm and improvement in his blood pressure.
A head CT did show a small focus of intraventricular hemorrhage in the left lateral ventricle and small foci of possible SAH.
Repeat head CT 7 8 hours later was unchanged and the patients neuro exam was stable.
Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended keeping platelets > 80 for 7 days and follow up in 1 month.
Infectious work-up including blood cultures and urine cultures were negative though the patient was undergoing treatment of pneumonia.
He will need repeat voiding trial in [**3-16**] days ([**1-1**], [**1-2**]) .
# Elevated INR - Patient noted to have INR elevated to 1.3-1.6.
His INR should be monitored at rehab with discontinuation of medication when INR is within normal limits.
# Urinary tract infection:  Urine culture was positive for pansensitive citrobacter from the urine.
Subsequent urine cultures were negative as were several blood cultures.
Hepatitis serologies negative, CMV negative, EBV, HIV negative.
