At ED, initial vital signs were 98.4 106 180/77 20 100% 6L.
Labs showed glucose 544, anion gap 33, K 6.0, Cr 1.5 (baseline 1.1), WBC 16.2.
U/A showed few bacteria; cxr was largely unremarkable  Patient endorsed headache and neck pain and stated that he fell at home.
CT head was done which showed vasogenic edema most likely [**2-25**] underlying mass or multiple metastases.
CT C-spine showed destruction of the left C2/C3 pedicle associated with a soft tissue lesion extending into adjacent epidural space, concerning for metastatic lesion.
On [**2162-10-12**] he presented to ED where MRI L-spine was performed showing acute/subacute compression fracture at L2; no cord compression or cauda equina.
Final read MRI also noted large heterogeneous mass involving the interpolar region of the left kidney.

Infectious etiology unlikely as U/A and CXR are reassuring, was afebrile.
- Metastatic lesions: CT head and C-spine concerning for metastatic lesions.
Previous MRI L-spine also showed renal mass.
He had a biopsy on [**2162-10-18**] prior to transfer from the ICU.
2) Renal cell carcinoma, suggestive of clear cell type - Mr. [**Known lastname **] underwent biopsy on [**2162-10-18**] demonstrating renal cell carcinoma.
An attempt for bone scan resulted in an acute delirious state with severe agitation - the scan was aborted (discussed below).
MRI revealed diffuse metastatic cerebral disease as well, as above.
Biopsy during this procedure revealed metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Biopsies of this site demonstrated metastatic RCC.
A series of head CT scans without contrast demonstrated stable cerebral edema.
Steroids were slowly tapered while hospitalized; repeat CT scans did not demonstrate rebound edema either to XRT or to steroid taper.
Plans for continued taper and steroid discontinuance were to be addressed at a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] of neuro-oncology (he will have an MRI on [**2162-11-29**] prior to this appointment).
On [**2162-10-20**], bone scan was attempted to determine sites of bony involvement.
Follow-up physical examination identified soft tissue swelling and tenderness to palpation of his left wrist.
A plain film x-ray identified fracture.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was hypercalcemic - likely secondary to a combination of bony metastases (major contributing factor) and paraneoplastic PTHrP (minor factor).
This did not yield significant improvement in his mentation, though it did return his calcium levels to normal ranges.
An EEG approximately one week prior to discharge was suggestive of diffuse metabolic encephalopathy.
Urine and blood cultures grew pan-sensitive Pseudomonas.
He did not spike more fevers, and follow-up blood cultures were negative for bacterial growth.
5) Glucose control - Throughout his stay, he demonstrated a wide range of blood glucose levels.
His blood pressure was then well-controlled while on the oncology floor.
- GLYCEMIC CONTROL: Needs gentle titration of sliding scale and long acting insulin for goal glucose 100-200 throughout the day.
