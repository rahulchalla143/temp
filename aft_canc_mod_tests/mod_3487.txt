Work-up at that time revealed a distal esophageal tumor.
In the ED, patient was found to be guaiac positive, and patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation given concern of GI bleed as hematocrit was found to be 23 on presentation.

---------- UGI AIR W/KUB  [**2115-8-28**] 10:06 AM No evidence of mechanical obstruction.
---------- ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2115-8-29**] 9:23 AM Gas-distended loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels in upper abdomen possibly secondary to partial high small bowel obstruction but previously administered contrast via jejunostomy tube has all proceeded into the colon.
Given a history of coronary artery disease and hematocrit of 23, patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells, responding appropriately to a hematocrit of 41.
Patient was observed for three days in ICU, then transferred to floor as hematocrit continued to remain stable following initial transfusion.
Radiographic studies were implemented to evaluate for distal obstruction leading to vomiting, and it was noted that J-tube placed during last admission was in place and operational.
Anti-emetic medications were further titrated as tube feeds were advanced, and tube feeding rate reached goal prior to the day of discharge.
On hospital day 7, patient's cell counts reached nadir (absolute neutrophil count was 150) as expected following chemotherapy prior to admission.
Neutropenic precautions were initiated, and patient's cell counts began to climb again over the next several days.
2) Patient's last admission was due to hematemesis secondary to vomiting from overaggressive tube feeds.
