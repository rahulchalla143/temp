CT Head: 1.
CXR: Stable chest x-ray examination consistent with prior lung resection and likely radiation therapy.
A CT of the head was done and notable for 16 by 16mm mass in R frontal lobe w/ associated edema and leftward midline shift of 1cm with subfalcine herniation.
She was started on dexamethasone 6mg q4hours, she was loaded w/ dilantin for seizure ppx, her Wellbutrin held due to increase seizure threshold.
An MRI of the head on [**2-13**] showed: Right frontal lobe enhancing mass at grey and white matter junction, measuring 1.5 X 2.4 cm, could represent metastasis given location.
On [**2-20**] her MRI imaging was reviewed, this was stable.
