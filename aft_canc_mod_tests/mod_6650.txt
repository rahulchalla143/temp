Presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital for evaluation of these symptoms and noted on CT scan to have left frontal mass.
Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.

An MRI with [**Date Range **] would be better in further evaluation.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2116-8-27**]: FINDINGS: As seen on the recent CT examination, there is a mass identified in the left frontal lobe region.

The functional MRI demonstrated the expected activation areas during the movement of the hand and feet, language and also movement of tongue at more than 1 cm from the lesion.
Final Report CT TORSO WITH CONTRAST [**2116-8-28**] 5:33 PM FINDINGS: CT CHEST: There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and liver are unremarkable.
There is focal fatty infiltration adjacent to the ligamentum teres (3, 54).
CT OF THE PELVIS: The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder is unremarkable.
HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST [**2116-8-31**]: There has been interval left frontal craniectomy and excision of a previously 3.5-cm mass in the left frontal lobe.
MRI [**2116-9-1**]: FINDINGS: The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy and resection of a previously identified neoplastic process involving the left frontal lobe, there is evidence of residual blood products within the surgical area, persistent and unchanged vasogenic edema and mild mass effect along the sulci in the right frontal ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
After administration of [**Doctor Last Name **] contrast, there is no evidence of significant abnormal enhancement, however, possibly it is too early to discriminate abnormal enhancement, correlation with a followup MRI once the blood product has been reabsorbed, is recommended for further assessment.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS([**9-2**]): On non-contrast, decreasing pneumocephalus, otherwise unchanged post-left- frontal-mass resection appearance; no new hemorrhage.
Area at the A1 segment bifurcation with acomm not aneurysm, likely infandibulum   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service on [**2116-8-27**] after her CT scan revealed a new brain mass in the left frontal lobe.
Her MRI of the brain revealved irregular areas of enhancement with rim enhancement in components of the mass.
On [**2116-8-28**] the patient had a functional MRI in preparation for surgery.
Her neuro exam was stable post-operatively.
Her MRI showed a gross total resection however there was a question of a small aneurysm seen at the junction of the ACOMM at A1 on the left.
The CTA showed that this area of concern to be an infandibulum and not an aneurysm.
The final pathology for the mass was Glioblastoma - WHO grade IV.
