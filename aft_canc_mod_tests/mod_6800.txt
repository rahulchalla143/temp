A followup CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was then performed on [**2179-7-8**], and this revealed once again the solid cystic and right adnexal mass measuring 15 x 12 x 8 cm.
The CA-125 level was elevated at 395 and a CEA level of 44.3 was noted.
A CTA of the chest revealed ascites with bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Her last Pap smear was obtained in 10/[**2177**].
Bimanual exam is dominated by a pelvic mass that extends over to the right side.
