Patient presented for outpatient CT scan for oncology f/u.
After CT scan she went for outpatient angio study to evaluate her port since there was no blood report.

BP during event was 200s systolic, HR in 130s and appeared to be sinus on monitor.
She was given 40mg IV lasix with urine ouput 500cc.

CXR [**2130-8-10**]: Final Report PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST  REASON FOR EXAM:  Recent acute diastolic heart failure, status post diuresis and left thoracentesis.
Right Port-A-Cath is in unchanged standard position.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mild depressed with inferolateral and basal inferior hypokinesis.
The patient's prior lymph node biopsy S12-7330  	 was also reviewed for morphologic comparison.
Brief Hospital Course: 74F with h/o recently dx pancreatic adenocarcinoma, DM2, type 2 DM who had standard outpatient CT scan, complicated with code blue for hypoxia, likely secondary to acute pulmonary edema.
Increased osmotic load after receiving IV contrast was also considered, as was ACS although EKG was not suggestive of this and troponin trended down from 0.12 to 0.11.
Due to a rise in the Cr to 1.3 and physical appearance of being dry, additional lasix was not given.
The echo revealed EF 55%, mild pulm HTN with PASP ~35, inferolateral and inferior basal hypokinesis.
Their assessment was that the event was most consistent with diastolic dysfunction and recommended initiation of labetalol and lipitor - in addition to the ACEI and aspirin she already was on.
Due to the Echo parameters of RA 0-5 mmHg, collapsable IVC and RA/RV collapse, rising Cr, additional diuresis was not considered necessary.
A lateral decub CXR was obtained and revealed L>R pleural effusion.
Fluid studies - including cytology - as noted above were negative for malignancy.
Should monitor Hct as outpatient, and consider endoscopic evaluation if does not improve.
Creatinine 1.1 on admission, 1.4 at discharge, with close follow up of renal function and lytes as outpatient.
# Access: Patient with port that was not having blood return during her outaptient CT prompting angio study.
Angio study revealed no issues, and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8817**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (IR access specialist) was closely involved.

Chest x-ray revealed fluids in the lung (pulmonary edema) and you were given intravenous diuretics to help eliminate the extra fluid.
With this, your oxygenation improved significantly and you were able to be weaned off the oxygen.
A number of studies were done to evaluate the cause of this acute event: an ultrasound of the kidneys revealed no abnormalities.
Ultrasound of the heart revealed good pumping function, but small amounts of fluid around the heart and an area of reduced motion in a segment of the heart wall.
