Recommend repeat film for further evaluation of interstitium.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2175-5-20**] 12:22 AM 1.
Lack of IV contrast limits evaluation for dissection or penetrating ulcer.
EKG [**2175-5-20**]: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2175-5-2**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
[**2175-5-21**]: CT spine IMPRESSION: Multiple lytic lesions seen throughout the cervical spine compatible with metastasis.
Multiple lesions throughout the spine, particularly in the thoracic and lumbar spines, may be consistent with multiple myeloma or metastases.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
urine [**2175-5-26**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
A preprocedure timeout was performed using two patient identifiers.
Using AP and lateral fluoroscopic technique, the L4 vertebral body was localized at the site for tissue sampling.
Position and orientation of the needles were confirmed with dynamic CT scan on the fluoroscopic table.
Using the dynamic CT scan, the positions of the needles were confirmed to be within the vertebral body and in the location of the lesions.
Renal U/S [**6-1**]: IMPRESSION: Interval resolution of left-sided hydronephrosis.
T8 vertebral lesion, biopsy (C): Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma involving bone.
The site of origin cannot be determined, but lung and head and neck should be considered.
[**6-5**] CTA chest:IMPRESSION: 1.
Combined withprior MRI and CT images, this finding suggests purely lytic metastases, such as from multiple myeloma.
CT head/neck:IMPRESSION: 1.
Bilateral pleural effusions, associated atelectasis, and severe emphysematous changes redemonstrated.
Comparison with prior studies is recommended and MR may be performed for further evaluation.
MRI t-spine:IMPRESSION: 1.
s/p biopsy of L4 on [**5-25**],  with non-specific pathology results.
Repeat biopsy T spine [**6-1**] showed metastatic sq cell carcinoma.
Biopsy was performed by spine surgery who followed the patient.
Tumor markers CEA, Ca 19.9, 27.29 and PSA were found to be within normal limits.
#altered mental status/delirium - Pt found to be somnolent a few days back.
Other possibilities included stroke/intracranial bleed or mets to the brain, however CT scans negative for acute process.
Infectious work up was negative and ABG did not show hypercarbia.
That same day pt was found to have cord compression after neuro consult and  repeat MRI of the T-spine.
Pt had hemoptysis and ?consolidation on Chest CT while in ICU.
LENI's negative and CTA negative for PE.
CXR showed small effusions with ?RLL consolidation.
Calcium levels were trended and have been normal.
Etiologies included narcotic overdose (but AAOx3/though sleepy), acute bleed (s/p OR [**6-1**]-has anemia at baseline/being transfused), sepsis (no white count/fever or other localizing symptoms), PE-on anticoagx2, CTA negative, ACS-EKG unchanged, CXR grossly unchanged.
Pt's creatinine was trended and remained baseline for the remainder of the hospitalization.
Hct stable, has not had any other episodes.
CT chest showed a possible RLL pneumonia with bronchograms, vs BAC.
Repeat CT chest with A did not show PE, but did show RLL consolidation.
Of note,pt had a recent egd ([**2175-4-4**]) which didnt show any source of bleeding, so unlikely to be GI source.
ANCA neg, anti-GBM neg to r/o a pulmonary-renal syndrome as a cause.
Pt underwent daily HCT, iron studies showed anemia of chronic dx, lysis labs were within normal limits.
ASA, Plavix held during prior admissions for hematuria, if HCT remains stable can consider restarting.

You were taken to the operating room for biopsy which found metastatic squamous cell cancer.
You also had some episodes of hypoxia for which you were ruled out for a blood clot in the lungs and were treated for a possible pneumonia.
