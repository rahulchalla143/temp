Repeat echocardiogram on [**7-26**] showed tamponade physiology with right ventricular collapse.
The patient was then transferred to the Medical ICU and taken to the catheter laboratory, where 450 cc of blood fluid was withdrawal and pericardial drain was left overnight; 25 cc pericardial fluid and drain was removed on [**7-27**].
The patient was then transferred back to the Bone Marrow Transplant Service after a [**7-28**] echocardiogram showed no changes since the drainage.
Repeat echocardiogram showed restrictive tamponade.
The patient was monitored with daily echocardiogram in the Medical ICU.
All cultures were negative.
Bronchoscopy on [**7-29**], revealed some evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in the left lung only.
Colonoscopy on [**8-5**], showed no evidence of graft versus host disease.
Heart rate was 96.
Blood pressure 108/64, breathing 20.
Heart examination was significant for S4, no murmurs, regular rate and rhythm.
Abdominal examination was benign.
The patient had a white count of 10.6, anemic with hematocrit of 29.6, platelet count 56.
