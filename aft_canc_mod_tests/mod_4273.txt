Per ICU attending there, his imaging/presentation did not seem consistent with PCP and serum LDH was normal at 230.
Of note, his nasal swabs at [**Hospital3 417**] tested positive for MRSA and VRE.

MRI Head IMPRESSION: Status post right pterional craniotomy for glioblastoma resection.
CT HEAD [**2103-5-29**] IMPRESSION: 1.
The right temporal tumor site and posttreatment changes are better evaluated on the head MRI from [**2103-5-28**].
EEG [**2103-5-30**] IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal extended routine EEG, due to the presence of continuous 0.5-1 Hz delta slowing seen over the right fronto-temporal region with rare associated sharp discharges (F4/T4).
OSH imaging suggestive of bibasilar atelectasis and consolidation.
Induced sputum was negative for PJP.
VPA level 133 prior to transfer from OSH and VPA dose lowered 1750 Q8H->1250 Q8H.
Patient developed worsening confusion [**5-26**] and given recently decreased VPA dose, concern was raised for non-convulsive seizures, 20 min EEG was obtained and showed no epileptiform discharges and only diffuse encephalopathy which had been seen on previous EEGs.
Neurological examination was unchanged.
Head CT was obtained which was negative for acute hemorrhage.
MRI head obtained 10 hours prior to the event (as part of oncologic work up) showed stable GBM.
A 24-hour EEG showed epileptiform discharges however the findings were relatively subtle and unlikely to cause convulsive seizure activity.
He underwent lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis, CSF culture was negative and cell count was not suggestive of meningitis.
(4) Sepsis:  On [**2103-5-29**], patient developed hypothermia and hypotension to SBP 90's.
A warming blanket was placed, blood cultures sent and an lumbar puncture was performed as above.
He appeared distended on [**2103-5-29**] and a plan film of the abdomen showed no evidence of obstruciton or megacolon.
Repeat studies for C. diff were negative.
MRI shows stable disease however concern was raised for progression of glioblastoma that cannot be seen on MRI.
His neurological examination remained unchanged and there was low suspicion for acute intracranial process.
Creatinine peaked at 1.5, and returned to baseline after one day.
21. valproic acid (as sodium salt) 250 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: 1250 (1250) mg PO Q8H (every 8 hours).
Your primary oncologist, Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 724**] noted that you seemed confused and was concerned that you were having a seizure, we performed an EEG which did not show anything to explain the confusion.
You were having diarrhea and we checked you for an infectious cause and the tests were negative.
