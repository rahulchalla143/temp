Admission Date:  [**2136-8-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-9-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2083-6-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4393**] Chief Complaint: Lab abnormalities/direct transfer from clinic   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 49552**] is a 52 year-old man with a history of HIV ([**4-18**] VL undetectable, CD4 266, toxo seronegative in [**Month (only) 958**]) and HCV cirrhosis (no varices, MELD 13 in [**6-17**]) who presented from clinic in setting of further work-up of recent diagnosis of brain masses.
This work-up was being done in the setting of a liver transplant evaluation.
Therfore, the brain mass evaluation was of secondary importance relating to his potential exclusion from liver transplant.
Given these negative lesions, brain biopsy was being considered as the next diagnostic option.

**FINAL REPORT [**2136-8-24**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2136-8-24**]):       ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE.
Trimethoprim/Sulfa sensitivity testing confirmed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3077**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3060**].
Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2136-9-8**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 53-year-old male w/ HIV ([**8-/2136**] VL undectable, CD4 226, toxo seronegative in [**Month (only) 958**]), HCV cirrhosis c/b ascites and recent diagnosis of brain masses that was a direct admission from clinic for evaluation of masses.
On [**9-20**] his foley was taken out in an effort to make him comfortable.
Urine in the bag was clear and yellow.
His blood pressure and HR remained stable throughout the episode of bleeding.
# Brain masses/Intracranial Hemorrhage The patient was admitted for further work-up of his brain masses with the differential being PML vs. lymphoma given two negative LPs excluding other causes.
An MRI was scheduled to track lesion progression.
On his way to CT scan he seized and was transferred to the SICU for intubation.
A CT identified a right temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Serial CTs were stable, and given his improving clinical picture, he was transferred to the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 679**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4869**].
On transfer his neurologic exam was evaluated and remained stable, with 4/5 strength of his right extremities, 1/5 strength of his left extremities.
His lactulose was titrated up and the patient's mental status improved: he was alert and oriented to person and place, oftentimes also to the date.
This downturn persisted through the remainder of his stay on the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 679**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4869**].
His HCV level was 2,550,000 IU/mL, down from 5,220,000 IU/mL in [**4-/2136**], making HCV infection less likely.
The keppra was changed to phenytoin, however his bilirubin continued to rise.
His bactrim and HAART therapy were discontinued on [**9-6**], after which his bilirubin stabilized around 20.
Over the rest of his hospital course, his bilirubin continued to increase and was at 30.5 the last day that labs were checked.
#PNA and Sepsis: Beginning [**9-7**], the patient began to spike fevers to 101 with a WCC of 11.7.
Urine, blood, and ascites cultures were sent.
A CXR demonstrated only minimally increased bibasilar opacities thought to be atelectasis.
His blood culture came back growing MSSA.
In the setting of the patient's altered mental status, the source was believed to be his lungs [**3-13**] to aspiration pneumonia.
A previous urine culture was noted to be growing Enterobacter, sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
However, given the patient's intracranial hemorrhage during this hospital stay, his anticoagulation was discontinued and his INR was reversed with vitamin K.  #Hypertension The patient was started on metoprolol for improved blood pressure control in the setting of an intracranial bleed.
