HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 46-year-old female with history of HIV (diagnosed two years ago, [**2150-1-7**], CD4 count equals 214 with an undetectable viral load), hepatitis [**Holiday **] developed headaches.
[**Name (NI) 6**] MRI on [**2150-1-30**], demonstrated an enhancing mass in the vermis.
The pathology was consistent with adenocarcinoma, she did not have a primary carcinoma identified at the time.
A recent CT scan on [**2150-1-31**], demonstrated hilar lymphadenopathy and a stable right middle lobe nodule.
On [**2150-3-5**], she presented to the Thoracic Clinic for evaluation of a cervical nodule, however, was found to be febrile with a room air oxygen saturation of 84% (temperature was 104 Fahrenheit, pulse 100-110, blood pressure 80/60), and she was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management.
Her last Pap smear was within this past year and was reportedly negative as well as mammogram.
Vital signs:  Temperature 100.1 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure 100/62, heart rate 88, respiratory rate 20.
Oxygen saturation 95% on four liters nasal cannula.
LABORATORY FINDINGS ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 7.2, hematocrit 38.5, platelet count 120.
Sodium 130, potassium 3.3, chloride 94, bicarbonate 19, BUN 22, creatinine 0.5, glucose 80.
PT 14, PTT 24.1, INR 1.3.
ALT 23, AST 14, alkaline phosphatase 57.
Total bilirubin 0.8, albumin 3.3, calcium 8.4, phosphorus 4.0, magnesium 1.9.
RADIOLOGIC DATA:  CT of the chest on [**2150-1-31**], demonstrating bilateral supraclavicular, anterior mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy.
She underwent a fine needle aspiration of the left cervical lymph node.
The final biopsy results showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Further investigation was obtained with bronchoalveolar lavage cytology that demonstrated atypical cells, however, was nonspecific.
A CT with contrast of the chest was obtained on [**3-7**] that was consistent with a picture suggestive of bronchoalveolar spread of carcinoma that was highly suspicious for a lung primary.
BAL culture data and multiple sputum samples consistent with Aspergillus fumigatus infection.
All other culture data from the BAL including acid fast cultures and viral cultures were negative.
Blood cultures times ten were negative throughout this admission.
Urine cultures times two were negative.
Stool ova and parasite cultures were negative.
Regarding her HIV, a repeat CD4 count was 48.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  Intermittently poor p.o.
Hepatitis C. 6.
