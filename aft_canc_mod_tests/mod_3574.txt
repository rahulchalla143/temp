A computed tomography scan obtained on [**2182-3-12**] showed a left lower lung collapse with abnormal soft tissue density in the left intrahilar area.
She underwent a bronchoscopy and was noted to have an obliteration of the distal portion of the left main stem at the level of the secondary.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical examination, the patient's temperature was 97 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 99, her blood pressure was 156/58, her respiratory rate was 22, and she was saturating 90% on 2 liters by nasal cannula.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased bibasilar breath sounds (left greater than right).
Examination was grossly intact.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories at the outside hospital showed a white blood cell count of 10.3, her hematocrit was 28, and her platelet count was 543.
Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 127, potassium was 4.5, chloride was 95, bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was 16, creatinine was 0.9, and her blood glucose was 119.
The patient's coagulations showed her INR was 1.
This was discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**], and the patient's pulmonary function tests were obtained with a question of repeat computed tomography scan and a positron emission tomography scan in preparation for potential surgery.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   On hospital day one, the patient had preoperative pulmonary function tests which showed forced vital capacity SaO2 of 84% on 4 liters.
Lung volumes were not obtained due to low oxygen saturations.
For further pulmonary function tests results, please follow up with report in the patient's record.
An electrocardiogram was obtained which showed no ischemic changes.
A urinalysis was sent which showed many bacteria, 6 to 10 white blood cells, and no urinary tract infection.
A chest computed tomography showed calcifications on the right lung and left lower lung collapse.
A head computed tomography showed calcifications in pons with no metastasis.
Her temperature maximum was 99 degrees Fahrenheit.
Otherwise, her vital signs were stable.
The patient was given Lasix, and a chest x-ray was obtained.
On postoperative day five, the house officer was called to see the patient for an oxygen saturation of 76%.
Obtained a chest x-ray which showed atelectasis, bilateral effusions, and congestion.
An arterial blood gas drawn showed a pH of 7.48, PCO2 was 42, PO2 was 52, bicarbonate was 32, and a base excess was 6.
Chest physical therapy was done, and the patient's saturations ranged in the 80% to 90% range.
The patient's laboratory values revealed the patient had a white blood cell count of 9.4, her hematocrit was 25.1, and her platelet count was 739.
Chemistries revealed sodium was 131, potassium was 5.2, chloride was 93, bicarbonate was 29, blood urea nitrogen was 22, and her creatinine was 1.3.
The patient's chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe collapse which was similar to previous.
The patient was also given normal saline boluses when her blood pressure would drop.
A chest x-ray showed white out of the left lung.
The Neo-Synephrine was weaned off for blood pressure support.
On postoperative day one, the plan was to remove the left chest tube, wean the ventilator, and start her tube feeds.
The patient's vital signs were stable.
On postoperative day five, the patient was again weaned to continuous positive airway pressure with a pressure support of 5 and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.
On postoperative day seven from pneumonectomy, the patient continued to do well extubated with oxygen saturations of 95% or better on 2 liters by nasal cannula or 50% shovel mask.
The patient's labile blood pressures persisted on and off Neo-Synephrine.
On postoperative day seven, the patient had burst of supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation to the 130s with labile blood pressures.
The patient was afebrile and her vital signs were stable.
On postoperative day ten, a repeat swallow evaluation was obtained.
The patient's vital signs were stable.
