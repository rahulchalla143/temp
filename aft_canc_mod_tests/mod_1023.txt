Markedly limited study due to motion.
Possible causes considered were: adrenal insufficiency (could be primary as he has h/o pheo, or secondary as he has had surgery on his pituitary gland, but this was not evidenced by his presentation or vital signs) as he has had labile BP recently, especially in the setting of hyperkalemia, or more likely volume depletion secondary to infection as his exam was consistent with volume depletion.
Also, hypothyroidism could be a cause, but his thyroid function tests were all normal.
He received 3% NaCl to correct his sodium and was started on intravenous antibiotics.
His sodium improved with these interventions.
#right middle lobe pneumonia- sputum culture not obtained, but empirically placed on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin IV.
His oxygenation remained adequate on room air and he was largely asymptomatic.
Blood cx remained  negative.
Cultures were however inconclusive ("mixed urogenital flora").
Ceftriaxone-Dextrose (Iso-osm) 2 gram/50 mL Piggyback Sig: Two (2) gm Intravenous Q24H (every 24 hours) for 10 days.
Your sodium was low likely secondary to infection and returned to [**Location 213**] levels on discharge.
Your white blood cell count was markedly elevated and is trending down on antibiotics and you are much improved.
Your levothyroxine was held but may now be restarted as your sodium and blood pressures have all normalized.
