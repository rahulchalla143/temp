C diff negative x3 Blood cultures no growth to date .
[**2150-7-10**] CXR (PA and Lat):  Cardiomegaly is stable.
[**2150-7-13**] CT Torso W/Contrast: 1.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>65%).
[**2150-7-13**] CXR: Low lung volumes with bibasilar consolidations, right more than left, could represent atelectasis, however, superimposed infection/aspiration is not excluded.
[**2150-7-13**] CT Head W/Out Contrast:  IMPRESSION: Normal non-contrast CT of the head.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
[**2150-7-21**] CXR (PA and Lat): Consolidation largely in the right middle lobe has improved since [**7-15**] though not entirely cleared.
Had CTA of torso that showed a chronic PE and multifocal pneumonia and CT abdomen showed ileus.
She was sent for a CTA which showed what was read as chronic PE and a multifocal PNA.
The patient had an ECHO done on the 23rd that showed EF of >65% and trace MR.  We continued the abx for her PNA, and for double coverage of pseudomonas, we started tobramycin.
# Abdominal Distension: ABd ct read shows ileus vs partial obstruction.
Out of concern of abdominal infx, we checked lfts and lipase which were wnl.
We dropped an NGT which was putting out up to 1L over 12 hours at first.
On the day of transfer, her NGT output slowed, and we were able to clamp it.
-We also checked a C-diff and started flagyl empirically, but d/c'ed it after the c-diff was negative .
We did a TTE which showed no RV strain.
We have had to transfuse her on the unit (transfusion threshold of Hct of 21) and received platelets x 1 for a PICC line placement, but our threshold is 20. .
Pt also had diarrhea after agressive treatment of her ileus but this improved with time and pt was C diff negative x3.
Echo showed no vegetations and nl EF.
Repeat CXR showed improving consolidation.
Repeat blood cultures were negative.
A follow-up CT of the abdomen and pelvis was declined by the patient.
You were found to have and blood clot in the vein in your leg.
