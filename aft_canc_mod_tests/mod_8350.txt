He was given [**Date range (1) **] 325 mg. EKG was reportedly unchanged from baseline, CXR was without pulmonary edema or infiltrate.
Cardiac enzymes were sent with a troponin slightly above recent values (0.17 from 0.14 last week).
Onc HX: [**12-11**] pre renal transplant CT scan chest noted enlarged RML nodule, w/ subcentimeter FDG avid scattered LNs.
Developed neck pain and found to have C2 pathological fracture, [**11-22**] cytology demonstrated poorly differentiated carcinoma.
CHF w/ EF 35% in [**11-11**] #.
MR - 2+ on [**Date Range 113**] in [**11-11**] #.
Parotiditis - [**12-12**] #.
CDiff - [**12-12**] #.
HCV - grade 1 inflammation and stage 0 fibrosis on bx [**2-9**]  Social History: lives with girlfriend, has 2 sons, used to work in construction, + smoker 1 PPD for many years quit recently, rare ETOH, no drugs.
Family History: Brother with CAD, and kidney disease requiring hemodialysis  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 97.0 BP 121/71 P 79 RR 20 SpO2 98% RA wt 169 lbs GEN: thin male sleeping, c/o neck pain when awoken.
LUE with fistula + thrill SKIN: extensive xerosis NEURO: a+o x 3  Pertinent Results: CXR [**1-19**]: Two views are compared with recent studies dated [**1-14**] and [**2198-1-12**].
CT NECK [**11-19**]: 1  Enlarged right parotid gland and right parotid duct.
CT HEAD WITH CONTRAST [**1-21**]: No hemorrhage or abnormal area of enhancement.
CTA OF THE CHEST [**1-21**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Right middle lobe spiculated mass with increased number and size of numerous pulmonary nodules, right hilar and  mediastinal lymphadenopathy, new right middle lobe bronchus encasement and obstruction as well as osseous metastasis (see below) all consistent with substantial progression of disease when compared to the CT of [**2197-12-24**].
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-12-4**], the left ventricle is now more dilated, left ventricular systolic function is now more depressed and mitral regurgitation is now more prominent.
[**2198-1-24**] MRI THORACIC SPINE: IMPRESSION: Signal hyperintensity in T4 vertebral body and right transverse process, consistent with known metastasis.
For further details on the cervical spine, please see the prior examination of [**11-16**].
[**2198-2-6**] MRI CERVICAL SPINE: CONCLUSION: Limited study due to the lack of intravenous contrast and due to artifacts arising from the fusion hardware.
[**2198-2-12**] CT C-SPINE: IMPRESSION: 1.
PATHOLOGY: [**2198-2-1**] T4 VERTEBRAL BODY, biopsy: Predominantly blood with rare degenerated malignant cells, consistent with poorly differentiated metastatic carcinoma; see note.
Further imaging was pursued, which showed complete destruction of C2, lateral C1 fracture, and anterior screw protrusion at C2.
The patient received navelbine for chemotherapy on [**2-6**] which was well-tolerated, but given findings of progressive metastatic disease despite chemo/ XRT it was decided that further chemotherapy would not be pursued.
A CT of his chest confirmed this progression over the past 4 weeks.
In addition the patient had a small non-occlusive, possibly chronic DVT and a thought was possible small PEs, this was not evident on CTA.
He was anticoagulated with heparin and bridged to coumadin for a goal INR [**1-7**].
CXR was unrevealing and cultures were negative to date by time of discharge.
BCX to date (unable to obtain adequate sputum or urine cultures to date).
He was anticoagulated with heparin and bridged to coumadin for a goal INR [**1-7**].
He was ruled out for MI several times with negative cardiac enzymes and no ischemic EKG changes.
An [**Month/Day (3) 113**] was repeated on admission, which did show an EF of 25-30% with 3+ MR (2 months ago his EF was 35-40% with 2+ MR).
PAROTITIS: stone passage 1 week prior to admission, repeat CT scan showed a small, 1-2mm stone in stentsons duct without obstruction.
Medications on Admission: Calcium Acetate 667 mg PO TID Nephrocaps Simvastatin 20 mg Daily Senna 8.6 mg [**Hospital1 **] Aspirin 81 mg Daily Clopidogrel 75 mg Daily Nifedipine 30 mg Tablet SR Daily Metoprolol Tartrate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] Lisinopril 20 mg Daily Isosorbide Mononitrate 30 mg SR Daily OxyContin 30 mg Tablet SR Q8 HRS Oxycodone 5 mg Q6HRS PRN Omeprazole Magnesium 20 mg Daily Docusate Sodium 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] flagyl 500 mg PO BID - for CDiff (needs to take for 2 weeks past levoflox and vanco courses) levofloxacin 250 mg PO Q48H - for parotiditis vanco 1 g QHD protocol - for parotiditis  Discharge Medications: 1.
Outpatient Lab Work please check INR on Monday, [**2198-2-19**] with results faxed to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5717**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4004**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Metastatic Non small cell lung cancer Deep Vein thrombosis Pathologic fracture of T4 Pathologic fracture of C2  Secondary Diagnosis: ESRD on HD CHF CAD HTN Pathological C2 fracture s/p C1-3 Fusion   Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile and VSS, in hard collar   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath which was likely due to having extra fluid.
For your heart failure you should weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
If you experience any fevers > 101, chills, shortnes of breath, cough, chest pain, palpitations, nausea/ vomiting/ diarrhea, weakness/ numbness/ paralysis, or any other concerning symptoms please contact your primary care doctor or go to the ER for further evaluation.
