In [**Month (only) 216**] of this year, she noticed the sudden onset of right sided pleuritic chest pain, a nonproductive cough and shortness of breath, and presented to the ED where a CXR was obtained that was consistent with PNA.
For this reason, a CT was obtained that showed subsegmental pulmonary emboli and other nodules.
The same CT scan of the chest revealed that in the upper right abdomen, there was a large right lower pole renal mass with renal vein invasion.
That prompted another CT of the abdomen which demonstrated this mass.
Regarding the CT scan, the location of most of these pulmonary nodular infiltrates was peripheral and less accessible to bronchoscopy.
She was transferred to CSRU on POD 3 and intubated for O2 sat 82% on NRB.
Chest CT that day revealed worsening lung opactities.

CTA [**12-19**]: 1.
CXR [**12-20**]: Interstitial edema has improved, more markedly in the left lung than the right partially obscuring multifocal nodules and mass like areas of consolidation.
Echo [**12-19**]: The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is >60%.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]

Bone scan [**12-15**] 1.
We eventually started her on a dobutamine drip to increase cardiac output and urine output.
Could be secondary to post op inflammation but more likely infectious as CT scan showed and new LLL opacity.
# Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease - guiac stools - will check iron studies - transfuse for large HCT drop, or goal HCT > 21 .
- follow lytes and replete Metabolic Acidosis/Acidemic pH: stable Etiology: Non Gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis secondary to fluid rescusitation (high Chloride load), renal failure (given poor urine output) - follow up chemistries and blood gases, continue LR prn for resucitation for more appropriate buffer .
CT scan reveals very poor prognosis and patient unlikely to survive long when extubated.
