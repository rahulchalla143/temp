Preoperative CT angiography demonstrates resectability and he now presents for a Whipple procedure.
AP CHEST, 6:23 A.M., [**10-17**]  HISTORY: Whipple procedure.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-14**]:  Small bilateral pleural effusion unchanged.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-10-17**] 6:08 PM  CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  Reason: 75 yo s/p whipple with n/v Field of view: 42  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 75 year old man with REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: 75 yo s/p whipple with n/v CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: Cr= 1.4  INDICATION: 75-year-old man status post Whipple with nausea and vomiting.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis was performed with oral contrast only.
Atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries is incompletely visualized as is calcification of the aortic valve.
CT OF THE PELVIS: The bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, and rectum appear normal.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2142-10-14**] atrial flutter with controlled ventricular response has appeared.

PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained [**2142-10-14**] at 09:44 hours and are compared with the prior radiograph performed on [**2142-10-12**].
The lateral view of the chest does, however, appears to show a drain or tube in the upper abdomen anteriorly.

[**First Name (STitle) 251**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *4.1 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.9 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm) Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.4 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 1.1 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)  Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 1.1 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 5.0 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 3.5 cm Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: 0.30 (nl >= 0.29) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 55% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: 3.6 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aorta - Ascending: 3.2 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.3 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2142-10-12**] 6:04 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: r/o cardiopulmonary pathology  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 75 year old man s/p whipple now with afib.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o cardiopulmonary pathology CHEST RADIOGRAPH  INDICATION: 75-year-old man status post Whipple procedure, now with atrial fibrillation.
The cardiac silhouette cannot be accurately assessed due to overlying opacity.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2142-10-15**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2142-10-17**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from the       site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus       aureus and beta streptococcus).
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
Outpatient Lab Work Check INR every day and give coumadin to keep INR [**2-16**].
