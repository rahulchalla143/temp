She was seen for her regularly scheduled medical oncology appointment today by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]  and a stat CT abdomen/pelvis was ordered showing a bowel obstruction with transition point in LUQ.
She was found to have disease progression by CT and CA-125 in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year.
Extremities: non tender, non edematous   Pertinent Results: IMAGING:  CT Abdomen/pelvis with contrast ([**7-18**]): FINDINGS: CHEST: The base of the heart is unremarkable without pericardial effusion.
Portable abdominal radiograph ([**7-19**]): FINDINGS: Portable supine and upright views of the abdomen are provided.
Portable chest radiograph ([**7-19**]): The lungs are low in volume and show bilateral lower lobe opacities.
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities could represent sequelae of aspiration or atelectasis   CT Chest/Abdomen ([**7-19**]): CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: The imaged portion of the thyroid gland is normal in appearance.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The liver is normal in appearance without focal lesion or intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Stomach is not as distended as on the prior study after decompression with nasogastric tube.
Proximal small bowel loops are dilated, slightly less so than on the prior study with likely transition point within the left upper quadrant and decompressed distal loops compatible with small-bowel obstruction.
Compared to the prior study, there is some passage of oral contrast administered at that time one day prior with contrast seen within loops of distal ileum as well as in large bowel.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Foley catheter is seen in the bladder with a large amount of air, likely related to Foley catheter replacement.
Portable Chest Radiograph ([**7-20**]): Left Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.
MICROBIOLOGY: Urine culture ([**7-19**]): no growth Blood cultures ([**7-19**]): no growth x 2  PERTINENT LABS: On admission: [**2171-7-18**] 09:15AM   WBC-9.8 RBC-3.62* HGB-10.9* HCT-32.5* MCV-90 MCH-30.1 MCHC-33.5 RDW-17.7* [**2171-7-18**] 09:15AM   NEUTS-74.6* LYMPHS-19.0 MONOS-5.9 EOS-0.1 BASOS-0.4 [**2171-7-18**] 09:15AM   PLT COUNT-234 [**2171-7-18**] 09:15AM   PT-11.8 PTT-18.6* INR(PT)-1.0 [**2171-7-18**] 09:15AM   LIPASE-19 GGT-38* [**2171-7-18**] 09:15AM   TOT PROT-6.3* ALBUMIN-4.5 GLOBULIN-1.8* CALCIUM-9.7 MAGNESIUM-1.9 [**2171-7-18**] 09:15AM   CA125-460* [**2171-7-18**] 09:15AM   LD(LDH)-242 AMYLASE-59 [**2171-7-18**] 09:15AM   UREA N-22* CREAT-0.7 SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-3.8 CHLORIDE-98 [**2171-7-18**] 09:15AM   GLUCOSE-153*  HD#2 ([**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer) Glucose 241 Urea Nitrogen 22 Creatinine 0.8 Sodium 136 Potassium 3.0 Chloride 100 Bicarbonate 28 Anion Gap 11 Creatine Kinase (CK) 27  Creatine Kinase, MB Isoenzyme 2 Troponin T <0.01 Calcium, Total 8.1 Phosphate 1.8 Magnesium 1.2  White Blood Cells 1.3 Red Blood Cells 2.68 Hemoglobin 8.0 Hematocrit 23.1 MCV 86 MCH 29.9 MCHC 34.6 RDW 18.1 DIFFERENTIAL Neutrophils 59 Bands 12 Lymphocytes 27 Monocytes 2 Eosinophils 0 Basophils 0 Atypical Lymphocytes 0 Metamyelocytes 0 Myelocytes 0  Day of discharge:  White Blood Cells 4.7 Red Blood Cells 3.63 Hemoglobin 11.1 Hematocrit 31.2 MCV 86 MCH 30.5 MCHC 35.4 RDW 15.8 Platelet Count 215  Urea Nitrogen 9 Creatinine 0.5 Sodium 141 Potassium 2.9 Chloride 100 Bicarbonate 28 Anion Gap 16 Calcium, Total 8.5 Phosphate 2.7 Magnesium 1.7   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1305**] was admitted to the Gyn-Oncology service for further management of a small bowel obstruction.
On hospital day #2, Ms. [**Known lastname 1305**] developed acute onset tachycardia, desaturation to 86%, temperature of 102, and altered mental status.
She was subsequently transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for 3 days where a thorough work-up was negative for bowel perforation, pulmonary embolism, and sepsis.
A chest radiograph and CT chest were consistent with what was likely an aspiration pneumonia and/or atelectasis.
All blood and urine culture data was negative.
She was given IV hydralazine as needed for blood pressure spikes.
An EKG performed during the acute episode on hospital day #2 showed non-specific ST changes which was likely secondary to her tachycardia at that point.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
As outlined above, a CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism.
Findings on this CT and a chest radiograph were suspicious for a possible aspiration pneumonia.
Patient's creatinine was stable throughout stay.
*) Hematology: During the acute episode on hospital day #2, Ms. [**Known lastname 1305**] was noted to have a hematocrit drop from 29.9 to 23.1 She was given 2 units of packed red blood cells in the SICU, with a subsequent improvement in hematocrit to 32.
On day of discharge her hematocrit and vital signs were stable.
Per oncology, this was likely related to her cisplatin treatment.
She will follow up with her oncologist to obtain labs to recheck her electrolytes on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**7-29**].
6. potassium chloride 20 % Liquid Sig: Fifteen (15) mL PO once a day: Please adjust according to potassium level check on [**7-29**], [**2170**].
* Please get your labs drawn on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**7-29**] so that your electrolyte levels can be followed up.
