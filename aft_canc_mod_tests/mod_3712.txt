He had a CXR done, which demonstrated a small LLL PNA.
His wbc was 1.2 with 29%N for an ANC of around 400, which is consistent with his recent baseline.
He noted, however, that the cross-reactivity for 3rd or 4th generation cephalosporins is <4%, and that a trial of such could be tried at full dose.
Past Medical History: PMH: Oncologic history: Patient initially presented in summer [**2116**] with easy bruising and dropping cell counts (pancytopenic) as well as some SOB/fatigue.
BMBx was consistent by report with myelodysplastic syndrome with presence of a 15-20% immature cells consistent with blasts; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt the pathology was consistent with MDS with excess blasts in transformation, suggesting acceleration of the disease towards acute leukemia.
Pt underwent induction and reinduction with single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] clofarabine per protocol 07-013, last treated in 09/[**2116**].
Since that time, he showed signs of dysplasia was dropping cell lines and bone marrow biopsy done in [**9-/2118**] showed blasts occurring in small clusters occupying an estimated 20% of the marrow cellularity.

- Repeat CT chest: Generalized ground-glass attenuation throughout both lungs and septal thickening particularly in the dependent lower lobes, increased since [**2119-10-7**], likely pulmonary edema, either cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic (including drug reaction), less likelyatypical infection.
Brief Hospital Course: 69M with AML, s/p completion of cycle 9 decitabine on [**2119-9-4**], also with COPD, presenting with worsening dyspnea over the last several days with non-productive cough, spiking fever in [**Hospital 3242**] clinic, with CXR showing minor LLL infiltrate.
Desensitization was notable for breath episodes of subjective throat tightness that resolved after treatment with hydroxyzine, benadryl, and famotidine.
CT chest showed emphysematous changes, fluid overload, but no obvious signs of pneumonia.
Bronchoscopy was done, and BAL cultures were all negative.
Two days prior to discharge (off antibiotics), patient was noted to develop another morbiliform rash, which was consistent with drug-rash per dermatology.
On room air, oxygen saturation is ~92%.
CT chest showed baseline emphysematous changes.
On discharge, patient had oxygen saturation >94% on room air sitting.
Three sets of cardiac enzymes were negative.

We did a chest x-ray and a CT scan to look at your lungs.
We checked lab tests and you did not have signs of heart damage.
We also asked the lung doctors to [**Name5 (PTitle) 788**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and they did a bronchoscopy, which did not show any abnormalities.
The culture from the fluid they collected did not show any growth.
