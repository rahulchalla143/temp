IMAGING: CT NECK [**12-23**]: FINDINGS: There is phlegmonous change throughout the retropharyngeal space extending from the C2 vertebral body level to the level of the T2 vertebral body at the level of the great vessel origins off the aortic arch.
An area of central hypodensity at the C4-C5 vertebral body level might represent a developing abscess within this phlegmonous collection (2;47).
Intracranially, there is a 4.3 x 5.1 cm meningioma within the left posterior fossa, which is not significantly changed when compared with MR examination of [**2177-8-1**].
Note, however, that the severity of the swelling appears to have improved substantially since the neck CT of [**12-23**].
The MR shows no evidence of such a collection.
The indurated tissue continues to causes anterior displacement of the airway, but again improved since the CT of the 17th.
If this is of clinical concern, correlation with a chest CT may be helpful.
However, this appearance has improved substantially since the neck CT of [**2180-12-23**].
CT neck [**12-29**] FINDINGS: There has been marked reduction in retropharyngeal soft tissue edema which was previously causing marked airway narrowing.
This lesion was far more edematous, and did not show contrast enhancement on the prior CT from [**2180-12-23**].
The remainder of the study is not markedly changed from the prior scan.
We recommend further evaluation with a barium esophagram (upper GI series), and repeat of the parathyroid scan.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

[**First Name (STitle) 3905**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3906**] Approved: SAT [**2180-12-30**] 9:19 AM  CT head [**12-30**] FINDINGS:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage, large vascular territory infarct or shift of midline structures is present.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Esophogram [**12-29**] FINDINGS: Lateral and AP serial radiographs were obtained while patient ingested Optiray and then thin barium.
It is difficult to determine whether this is intra- or extra-luminal, but correlation with previous studies suggests that this is secondary to retropharyngeal swelling.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Discharge labs:  [**2181-1-2**] 07:14AM BLOOD WBC-9.7 RBC-4.33 Hgb-11.9* Hct-37.3 MCV-86 MCH-27.4 MCHC-31.8 RDW-14.3 Plt Ct-209 [**2181-1-2**] 07:14AM BLOOD Glucose-80 UreaN-16 Creat-0.7 Na-140 K-3.5 Cl-105 HCO3-29 AnGap-10 [**2181-1-2**] 07:14AM BLOOD Calcium-9.2 Mg-2.0  Brief Hospital Course: 87 yo F p/w chest pressure, dysphagia ruled out for MI in the ED but found to have retropharyngeal deep space infection, now intubated.
A follow up MRI and then CT scan showed improvement in airway swelling compared to prior CT.
On repeat imaging, the phlegmon was thought to possibly be related to an esophageal diveritculum with micro-performation (which was ruled out with barium esophogram) versus a parathyroid adenoma rupture due to a lesion seen on previous parathyroid uptake scan.
Patient had parathyroid ultrasound which showed on preliminary read to have an enlarged right parathyroid nodule up to 2.5cm, thyroid nodules and a new left parathyroid nodule.
Radiology suggested repeat parathyroid uptake scan as an outpatient in approximately two weeks, after further decrease in edema, at which point they felt that it could still be determined if the etiology of this phlegmon was rupture of the parathyroid adenoma posterior to the trachea.
They also suggested parathyroid nodule and thryoid nodule biopsy which can be considered as an outpatient.
