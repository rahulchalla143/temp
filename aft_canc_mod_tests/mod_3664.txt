Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude) Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2126-11-5**], the pericardial effusion is now larger.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated an elevated mean right filling pressure along with a magnified right atrial "x" descent along with an attenuated "y" descent.
The pericardial pressure and waveform matched the RA pressure and waveform.
Following pericardiocentesis (removal of over 320cc of non-bloody fluid) the pericardial pressure dropped to zero with no change in the right atrial pressure or cardiac output.
Echogenic right kidney suggestive of diffuse chronic parenchymal renal disease.
[**12-6**] KUB: A limited portable supine AP view of the abdomen at 22:15 hours show no evidence of dilated bowel loops to suggest intestinal obstruction.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-12-4**], a small consolidated effusion (posterior) is now evident.
[**12-7**] KUB: A single supine portable abdominal film is compared to previous examination a day ago.
Exam of the left kidney was technically limited.
[**12-9**] Spinal fluid cytology: negative for malignant cells.
WBC count is decreased.
A 42-cell count differential shows:  60% segmented neutrophils, 17% bands, 7% monocytes, 2% lymphocytes, 14% basophils.
Platelet count appears decreased; giant forms are not present.
ASPIRATE SMEARS:           Inadequate for evaluation due to lack of spicules.
CLOT SECTION AND BIOPSY SLIDES The marrow biopsy is virtually acellular (<5%) and contains only are small clusters populated by maturing erythroid precursors.
SPECIAL STAINS Iron stain is inadequate for evaluation because it does not contain marrow spicules.
Gross:  The specimen is received in B+ Fixative labeled with "[**Known lastname 62516**], [**Known firstname **]",  the medical record number and "MO5-659", and consists of a core biopsy of bone marrow measuring 1.7 cm in length.
The patient developed a new murmur and increased dyspnea and chest pain, and on [**12-4**] an echocardiogram revealed a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology.
Her ambisome dose was therefore decreased and her voriconazole was changed to the PO formulation.
A head CT without contrast was negative for any acute abnormality.
EEG was consistent with encephalopathy.
MRI was negative for acute infarct, and MRA was negative for any vascular abnormality.
An LP was done which showed an opening pressure of 42; however, this was felt to be falsely elevated due to patient positioning.
Laboratory studies were not consistent with infection, and cultures were negative.
A bone marrow biopsy was done on [**12-9**] to determine the status of the patient's leukemia.
The patient's mental status did not improve, and so a repeat LP was done on [**12-9**] to confirm the opening pressure (which was again 40) and to obtain fluid for cytology.
(CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells.)
EKG revealed sinus tachycardia with no ischemic changes.
