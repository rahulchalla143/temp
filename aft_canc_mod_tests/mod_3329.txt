EGD and biopsy on [**2100-9-22**] revealed adenocarcinoma arising at the GE junction without Barrett's metaplasia seen, and  possible adenocarcinoma versus contamination at 25 cm.
Chest CAT scan on [**2100-9-27**] revealed mild fullness of the distal esophagus, scattered nonspecific small lymph nodes, and a  punctate nonspecific right lung nodule.
PET CT scan on [**2100-9-30**] revealed a small focal hypermetabolic area in the distal third of  the esophagus, without CT correlation with the biopsy of the area  of concern for malignancy.
He then underwent another EGD with ultrasound on [**2100-10-6**] here at [**Hospital1 69**].
Pathology revealed adenocarcinoma at the GE junction, infiltrating the muscularis propria, however, the esophagus at 25  cm was consistent with a squamous epithelium only.
Ultrasound revealed N1 status.
-Recent PE on coumadin - s/p recent Left lower extremity cellulitis, likely etiology from his leg brace.

Compared to prior study of [**2101-1-15**], this could be due to atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded.
COMPARISON: Scout film of CT from [**2101-1-3**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
EKG was normal without acute changes and he had negative cardiac enzymes x3.
CXR was stable and showed no pneumothorax.
He had a bedside grape-juice swallow on POD 7 that did not show leak into neck JP drain.
Cultures revealed ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE that was pan sensitive.
Subsequent examinations revealed erythema overlying the hernia repair left of midline.
