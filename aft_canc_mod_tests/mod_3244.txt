Small hepatic hypodensity, too small to characterize, unchanged from prior CT.  CXR ([**2144-2-11**]) - FINDINGS: In comparison with the previous study of this date, there is little change.
The patchy area of opacification in the right lung apex is unchanged and quite similar to recent chest CT examination.
ECG ([**2144-2-13**]) - Baseline artifact makes interpretation difficult.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2144-2-9**] artifact is more pronounced and makes interpretation difficult.
On the floor he was followed by the hospitalist service and underwent XRT [**2143-1-28**].
That evening, his [**1-27**] blood cultures grew out GPCs, and pt was also noted to be hypotensive to the mid 70s with minimal response to 80s after 1L of NS.
However, his GPCs were coag negative staph and thought to be a contaminant as subsequent cultures did not grow anything.
At times, when his heart rate would increase, he would have episodes of hypotension.
Once his rate was better controlled with metoprolol, his blood pressure became more stable.
CT scan was performed and showed malrotation of the cecum, which was concerning for mesenteric ischemia.
Stool cultures were sent and were again negative.
During this time that his rate was difficult to control, CTA of the chest was performed and revealed a pulmonary embolus (see below).
After transfer from the MICU to the oncology service, the patient was noted to have repeated episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate that was somewhat difficult to control  CTA of the chest was performed and revealed a pulmonary embolism.
Because of his GI problems, he was also placed on flagyl.
While he did have one positive blood culture prior to his neutropenia (a contaminant), no other cultures grew out any bacteria.
As his neutropenia improved and his fevers lessened, the patient?????
At the time of discharge, the patient was still anemic; however, his hematocrit was stable.
Iron studies were sent prior to discharge and did not show evidence of iron deficiency.
His platelet count was followed and ultimately recovered.
?s creatinine was elevated above his baseline, likely because of hypovolemia.
Of note, urine electrolytes also suggested some component of ATN to the patient?????
After your blood pressures stabilized, you were transferred from the ICU to the oncology floor.
Your [**Hospital 47430**] hospital course was complicated by anemia (for which you received blood), neutropenia (low white blood cells), low platelets, fevers (for which you were given bload antibiotics), a blood clot to the lungs, and some concerning findings on an abdominal CT scan.
You need to have a PET scan performed within the next 2-3 weeks.
