At our ED, a hip CT was obtained and ortho was consulted.
A spint was applied to the left elbow and the patient was admitted to medicine for preoperative evaluation.
Past Medical History: - Pathological L ulnar fracture and Right Hip Fracture - Primary hyperparathyroidism - Hypercalcemia - Vitamin D Deficiency - Thyroid nodules - Diastolic Heart Failure - Glucose intolerance - Acute Renal Failure - Blood Loss Anemia - Anemia of Chronic Inflammation - Hyponatremia - Delirium - Gout  Social History: denies tobacco/EtOH/illicits.
Neck: supple, 8 cm JVD Chest: crackles on right base, otherwise clear Cor: tachycardic no murmurs Abdomen: obese, umbilical hernia, soft NT ND + BS, no rebound Extremity: left arm in spint.
Right radial pulse 2+.
Strength 4/5 hip flexors, [**6-8**] hallux flexors and extensors.
Right arm flexors/extensors [**6-8**].
HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS RIGHT  [**2120-3-31**] 9:43 PM FOUR VIEWS, RIGHT HIP: There is fracture through the anterior and posterior columns and medial wall of the right acetabulum.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)  [**2120-3-31**] 9:42 PM There is mild cardiomegaly.
Compression of T12 vertebral body, age indeterminate.
EKG  Sinus tachycardia.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
PARATHYROID SCAN  [**2120-4-2**] Following the intravenous injection of tracer, images of the neck including anterior, pinhole and marker views were obtained at 20 minutes and 2 hours.
Initial images show diffuse uptake within the thyroid gland.
BONE SCAN  [**2120-4-4**] Whole body images of the skeleton obtained in anterior and posterior projections demonstrate intense tracer uptake at the right hip consistent with recent fracture.
The elbows/forearms were out of the field of view for the study and thus not evaluated.
A biopsy will be scheduled at a later date, as the patient's aspirin was discontinued only on [**2120-4-8**].
The bone scan is not available for comparison.
If this did correspond to the radionuclide bone scan abnormality, CT could yield additional information.
CT NECK W/ & W/O CONTRAST  [**2120-4-16**] 8:37 PM CT OF THE NECK WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The right parotid gland is significantly enlarged on axial view measuring 4.8 x 3.5 cm and appears infiltrated and edematous.
Inflammation involves the muscles of the right neck including masseter, platysmus and occipital musculature, which are notably thickened.
Limited evaluation of the brain parenchyma demonstrates no abnormality.

A repeat thyroid US showed spongiform nodule.
baseline Cr 0.8. increased upto 1.8. pt seems intravascularly dry and extravascularly overloaded.
