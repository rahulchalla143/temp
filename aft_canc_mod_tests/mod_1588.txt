He was sent for a CT of the chest [**2182-1-18**] which revealed findings consistent with lung cancer in the left field with metastases to the right lung, liver, bones and likely adrenal glands.
He subsequently underwent MR of the head and thoracic spine on [**2182-1-30**] which showed diffuse metastasis.

CTA CHEST [**2182-2-1**] 1.
Although severely limited evaluation of the abdominal structures, the non-opacified visualized portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates a hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver which may be representative of a metastatic focus.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Right lung is clear with the exception of some lower lobe alveolar infiltrate medially similar in appearance to the CT scan from the prior day.
There is a right lower lobe infiltrate, similar in size compared to the study from the prior day.
The scattered small metastases which were previously seen on MRI are not visualized on CT, even after the administration of intravenous contrast.
Known small metastases which were visualized on the recent MRI are not visualized on this exam.
TTE showed severe pulmonary artery hypertension, likely representing the conditions in both lungs creating back-pressure.
His blood pressure was maintained below SBP 140 and DBP 110 to help prevent intracranial bleeding.
Urine electrolytes were consistent with pre-renal process.
In the two days prior to discharge, his BP dropped slightly necessitating reduced regimen.
Transitional Issues: - follow BP and restart HCTZ, amlodipine as necessary to maintain SBP < 140, DBP < 110  Medications on Admission: AMLODIPINE - 10 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily CODEINE-GUAIFENESIN - 100 mg-10 mg/5 mL Liquid - [**12-31**] tsp(s) by mouth up to q 4 hrs prn cough HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE - 12.5 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily HYDROCODONE-ACETAMINOPHEN - 5 mg-325 mg Tablet - [**12-31**] Tablet(s) by mouth po q6hrs prn pain LATANOPROST [XALATAN] - 0.005 % Drops - 1 ou hs LISINOPRIL - 40 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily LORAZEPAM - 1 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth every 8 hrs prn anxiety SIMVASTATIN - 10 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily  Medications - OTC ASPIRIN - 81 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily DOCUSATE SODIUM - 100 mg Capsule - 1 Capsule(s) by mouth hs   Discharge Medications: 1.
Dx:  malignant pleural effusion due to lung cancer, pulmonary embolism 11. enoxaparin 100 mg/mL Syringe Sig: Ninety (90) mg Subcutaneous Q12H (every 12 hours).
You were also found to have a blood clot in the lung, a pulmonary embolism.
- STOP hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine, both blood pressure medications, as your pressures have been low.
- START folic acid - START Lovenox injections, an anti-coagulant - START senna for constipation - START Zofran for nausea.
