Gastric Lavage was done in ED, which did not reveal frank blood or blood clots.
EGD was done which revealed gastric changes consistent with gastritis and a well-healed, nonbleeding duodenal ulcer was seen.
At that time patient was transfused a total of 6U pRBC with increase and stabilization of Hct to 29.1.
While in hospital patient had a total of [**2-16**] episodes of melena, no vomiting, however vital signs were stable.
Hct continued to decrease to as low as 26 with continued requirements for blood transfusion, however patient's vital signs remained relatively stable.
Hct remained between 26-28 and as per GI, patient was scheduled for outpatient repeat EGD.
Upon admission, WBC was 68 with highest WBC being 80.
Heme-Onc was consulted, who came to see patient and indicated this transient increase in WBC above baseline was likely secondary to stress reaction.
Peripheral blood smear was evaluated and was negative for blasts, making blastic transformation of MDS less likely.
Urineanalysis was negative, chest x-ray was within normal limits.
Procrit 60,000U qo week 2.
