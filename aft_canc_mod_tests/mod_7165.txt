Reports: [**4-12**] CXR BEDSIDE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Accounting for patient rotation, cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are unchanged.
[**4-10**] CXR FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right and left basal parenchymal opacities, more extensive on the left than on the right, have slightly increased in extent.
Right pneumothorax, visible on the CT examination from [**2199-4-9**], as well as the subtle pneumomediastinum are not depicted on today's chest image.
Unchanged position of the monitoring and support devices.
EKG Sinus rhythm.
CT head  IMPRESSION: 1.
Otherwise the patient had her hematocrit trended and remained stable.
The patient had multiple repeat chest x-rays checked which showed resolution of the pneumothorax.
The patient had multiple repeat chest x-rays checked which showed resolution of the pneumomediastinum.
She does have a left shift with concern for aspiration on CT chest.
Urinalysis possibly suggestive of UTI.
Urine legionella was negative and so azithromycin was discontinued.
