[**2134-8-26**] Upper Extremity CT: 1.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
#Nausea and Vomiting: The abdominal CT revealed no mechanical obstruction; her ileus was presumed to be due to the high dose of narcotics she was on for her bone pain.
#DVT: On admission CT scan she was found to have a R common femoral vein DVT.
Hct 26 on discharge and stable.
Given her continued nausea and poor PO intake, a KUB was done and revealed an ileus.
A CT of her shoulder revealed significant lytic lesions, and rad-onc felt it was amenable to XRT as an outpatient (started [**9-2**]).
#Multiple myeloma: The abdominal/pelvic CT revealed a mass concerning for a plasmacytoma.
Her outpatient oncologist at [**Hospital1 2177**] reported that this was an amyloidoma, and has been known since her diagnosis 1.5 years ago.
Her lasix and amlodipine was held on [**8-21**] after a BP of 99/38 and poor PO intake.
Her metoprolol was continued given her a.fibb and the dose was adjusted to keep her BP stable and HR under control.
Subsequent AM glucose were 90-115, and her finger sticks were d/c'ed.
Her Hct rebounded and stablized in the low 30s, before dropping to 24.8 on [**9-2**].
Her hct then stabilized and her bleeding was thought to be due to her hemorrhoid.
An EKG revealed no ischemic changes or R heart strain.
A CXR revealed no focal consolidation.
An echo showed moderate LV hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40%), increased LV filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg), and no evidence of R ventricular strain or wall motion abnormalities.
Pt had urine lytes which showed an SIADH picture.

After an evaluation consisting of a history, physical exam, imaging and blood tests, it was suspected that it was due to your high levels of pain medications.
The CT scan showed no physical obstruction.
The CT of your abdomen also showed a blood clot in your right leg.
STARTED Lovenox injections - This is a medication for the blood clot in your leg.
