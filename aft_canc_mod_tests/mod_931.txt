On presentation, pt [**Name (NI) 4650**], stable Hct, and supratherapeutic INR 3.8.
Rectal exam with gross blood in rectal vault.
CXR showed pulmonary edema.
Given lasix IV but limited by hypotension this AM to SBP 70s.
Gave 200 cc IVF bolus ---> SBP 110.
Troponins now 0.04 --> 0.29 --> 0.38 (cutoff 0.5).
EKG initially in atrial fibrillation in ED and given cardizem x 1 with conversion to NSR.

Bedside echo was ordered, but no report yet.

STUDIES: OSH EKG [**10-17**]: atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response.
OSH PCXR [**10-17**]: R pleural effusion, pulmonary edema.
CXR (my read): slightly congested pulm vasculature, R pleural effusion, no overt infiltrate.
TTE [**2181-8-28**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-10-26**], pleural effusions are new.
CXR - PORTABLE CHEST, [**2181-10-21**] FINDINGS: Pulmonary vascularity appears engorged, but there is no overt evidence of pulmonary edema.
Bilateral moderate-to-large pleural effusions are again demonstrated with adjacent areas of basilar atelectasis.

Her blood pressure medications were titrated and blood pressure was well controlled on captopril and metoprolol.
Her creatinine returned to her baseline of 0.9-1.0.
You required breathing support with an endotracheal tube and also needed medications to reduce your blood pressure and reduce the fluid in your lungs.
