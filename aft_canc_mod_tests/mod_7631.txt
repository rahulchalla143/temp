Labs were notable for INR elevated at 3.9, Hct 39.7.
CXR showed increased nodularities consistent with increasing metastases, RLL ill-defined opacity and increased R pleural effusion.
Interventional pulmonology was consulted and recommended MICU admission for bronchoscopy and airway monitoring after non-contrast chest CT given contrast allergy.

Small right pleural effusion has increased when compared to the prior chest radiograph, with patchy ill-defined opacity in the right lung base which may reflect atelectasis though infection is not completely excluded.
The next day she had a repeat bronchoscopy with successful removal of the clot without incidental bleeding.
# Atrial fibrillation: now rate controlled, INR supratherapeutic on presentation.
She will likely need an evaluation by radiation oncology to prevent hemoptysis in the future.
