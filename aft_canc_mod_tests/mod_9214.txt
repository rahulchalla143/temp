Biliary mass:  The patient tolerated the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedure with stent well and liver function tests declined after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedure.
The 8D cells sampled on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography were found to be atypical, likely thought to be cholangiocarcinoma versus pancreatic cancer.
A CT with aortic protocol was performed.
The patient also underwent cardiac catheterization.
Right renal mass:  This is suspected to be renal cell carcinoma based on the CT urogram findings.
Cardiovascular:  Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the patient's echocardiogram showed systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction of approximately 30%.
A stress test was performed, which showed that the left ventricular cavity enlarged on stress images when compared to resting perfusion images.
Cardiac catheterization showed normal pulmonary wedge pressures again and ejection fraction of 30%, overall hypokinetic motion, no focal stenoses though diffuse disease in the right coronary artery and the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery as well as the proximal circumflex.
His anticoagulation, which had been held at the initial time of his bleed was held on discharge given his risk of bleeding from his biliary tumor.
MAJOR PROCEDURES:  Blood transfusions, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent, cardiac catheterization.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Biliary obstruction relieved with stent, hematocrit stable, appetite improved.
