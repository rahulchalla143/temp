Biliary Drainage from [**Month/Day/Year **] (Final [**2149-5-25**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa and       S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..   Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo woman w recently diagnosed inoperable pancreatic cancer thought to be metastatic to the liver s/p recent [**Month/Day/Year **] and placement of metal stent for enterococcal cholangitis complicated by septic shock who presented with fevers, increased WBC, RUQ pain, and jaundice along with a CT of the abdomen showing significant enlargement of CBD and intrahepatic biliary tree.
A specific organism was not isolated on culture so she was treated with vancomycin and zosyn.
Consistent with the belief that these lesions were metastatic, the patient began to develop worsening liver function with INR [**3-4**] refractory to vitamin k repletion.
The patient was hyponatremic with relatively elevated urine osms and urine sodium.
