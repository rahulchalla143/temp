Pathology revealed a 5.5 cm, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, firm and grade 3.
On [**2182-8-16**], CT scan reportedly showed no evidence of recurrent disease.
Followup CT scan on [**2183-8-12**], showed new pulmonary nodules, a soft tissue mass in the left renal fossa, as well as an enlarged retroperitoneal, necrotic lymph node.
PET CT done on [**2183-8-21**], showed avidity in the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes.
Brain MRI was negative.
On [**2183-8-25**], he underwent a CT-guided biopsy of a paraaortic lymph node, which confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
VITAL SIGNS:  95.7, 76, 20, 114/62, O2 sat 96% on room air.
ADMISSION LABS:  White [**Year (4 digits) **] count 13.8, hemoglobin 12.5, hematocrit 38, platelet count 382,000, INR 1, glucose 95, BUN 31, creatinine 1.7, sodium 37, potassium 5.1, chloride 102, CO2 25, ALT 15, AST 17, CK 33, total bili 0.4, albumin 3.6, calcium 8.9, phosphorus 3.5, magnesium 2.2.
His admission weight was 117 kg, and we dosed his  IL-2 using adjusted ideal body weight.
He was then switched to Neo- Synephrine with improvement in his heart rate and [**Known lastname **] pressure.
On treatment day #5 his urine output had improved, with a creatinine of 6.4, attributed to IL-2-induced acute renal failure.
His bicarbonate was closely monitored and repleted below 20.
Electrolytes were monitored and repleted per protocol.
Strict I's and O's, serum creatinine and bicarbonate were monitored b.i.d.
Non-rebreather was placed with course breath sounds noted bilaterally.
[**Name (NI) **] pressure was stable, O2 sats were in the high 90s on room air.
On [**2183-11-4**], his creatinine kinase level was elevated at 256, with a normal MB and troponin level, felt to be inconsistent with myocarditis.
FOLLOWUP PLANS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 20728**] will return to clinic in 4 weeks after CT scans to assess disease response.
