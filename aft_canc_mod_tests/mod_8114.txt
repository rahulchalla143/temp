# Acute leukemia: Peripheral blood smear showed many myeloid-appearing blasts, most likely c/w acute myeloid leukemia.
Bone marrow biopsy was performed.
Echo and line were placed on [**7-20**].
Her urine output was decreased on [**7-21**] and creatinine remained elevated at 2.7 depite continuous IVF with a 1L NS [**Last Name (LF) 1868**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] renal was consulted.
