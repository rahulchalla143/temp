In clinic today, he was using accessory muscles of respiration and was mildly diaphoretic, and his O2 sat on room air was 97%, dropping to 94% with ambulation.
Past Medical History: 1. metastatic carcinoid tumor, Dx'ed [**2123**] -was on a study drug for a year and a half (ended about a year ago) and was on octreotide for a few months earlier this year but stopped because of diarrhea 2. hypertension 3. hyperlipidemia 4. carotid endarterectomy [**2120**] 5. depression/anxiety 6. cellulitis 2 weeks ago, given Keflex IV at [**Hospital3 **], now resolved 7.
DM2/prediabetic state: random blood sugar was high, was on glyburide for a brief time but made his sugars low so stopped 8. anxiety attack [**2110**] (collapsed), diagnosed in [**2120**] as MI 9. basal cell carcinoma (chest, low back, MOHS on cheek [**3-31**] and [**7-1**])   Social History: Lives alone, has two daughters Distant tobacco use (25 pack-years, quit 30 years ago), distant EtOH use (quit 28 yrs ago), no drugs  Family History: early CAD   Physical Exam: VS: T 97.7, HR 97, BP 140/52, RR 20, O2sat 97% on RA Gen: awake, alert, conversant, elderly man, mildly short of breath HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM Neck: supple, JVP elevated (~8cm) Chest: fine cracles at left base, otherwise CTA CV: RRR, nl S1S2, no m/r/g, distant heart sounds Abd: S/ND, mildy tender to palpation in LLQ Ext: WWP, 1+ LE edema bilaterally, no c/c Neuro: nonfocal   Pertinent Results: [**2127-8-1**] 03:30PM   PLT COUNT-201 [**2127-8-1**] 03:30PM   NEUTS-69.9 LYMPHS-23.5 MONOS-4.8 EOS-1.1 BASOS-0.7 [**2127-8-1**] 03:30PM   WBC-9.2 RBC-4.68 HGB-14.6 HCT-42.0 MCV-90 MCH-31.3 MCHC-34.8 RDW-13.7 [**2127-8-1**] 03:30PM   TSH-4.0  [**2127-8-1**] 03:30PM   CK-MB-NotDone cTropnT-<0.01 [**2127-8-1**] 03:30PM   CK(CPK)-50 [**2127-8-1**] 03:30PM   GLUCOSE-125* UREA N-14 CREAT-1.0 SODIUM-138 POTASSIUM-4.1 CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-22 ANION GAP-19  Brief Hospital Course: 1.
CXR [**8-3**] 8am showed showed atelectasis with possible superimposed pneumonia.
Emergent TTE showed decreased EF (30%), anteroapical infarct with moderate-to-severe overall left ventricular contractile dysfunction; bicusapid aortic valve with at least mild aortic stenosis.
2. chest pain -MI (no ischemic changes on EKG) vs. GERD vs. anxiety vs. PE (CTA negative) Cardiac enzymes were negative.
He had clean coronaries on cath [**8-15**].
A repeat TTE on [**8-18**] showed no change from [**8-3**].
His hypoxia was attributed to a right lower lobe pneumonia and congestive heart failure given his new wall motion abnormality with an EF of 35-40%.
Some of these episodes were attributed to anxiety since his saturations improved with ativan.
A chest CT was performed to look for parenchymal disease that was not evident on plain films.
The CT showed bilateral pleural effusions with the right greated than the left.
Pleural cultures showed no growth at the time of transfer from the ICU.
His oxygenation improved post-thoracentesis and he was able to tolerate being on room air.
His pressure stabilized after fluid boluses during his first 24 hours in the ICU.
After resolution of the hypotension, his blood pressure was elevated and he required metoprolol to maintain adequate blood pressure control.
His FeUrea was consistent with pre-renal.
Renal felt that he had a resolving ATN in the setting of hypotension and recommended repleting half his urine output with 1/2NS for a resolving ATN.
He initially appeared to be volume overloaded on exam and aggressive diuresis was attempted once his creatinie returned to [**Location 213**].
Subsequently, lasix was used sparingly and his creatinine and electrolytes were followed closely.
An ultrasound showed old metastasis and fluid overload.
His hepatitis serologies were negative.
His AST/ALT peaked on ICU day 2 and his tbili peaked on ICU day 6.
There was no evidence of aute bleeding initially, but his hematocrit decreased 48 to 39 after two liters iv fluids.
Upon transfer from the ICU, his platelets, fibrinogen, and INR were returning to normal levels.
CAD:  He had a history of a previous MI and now has new anterior wall hypokinesis on echo and reduced EF 35%.
On ICU day 4, low dose metoprolol was started once his blood pressure was stable.
His blood glucose remained in good control generally between 110-160. .
His potassium overcorrected and he required repletion.
His magnesium and calcium were also repleted.
