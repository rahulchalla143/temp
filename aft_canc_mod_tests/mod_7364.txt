There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-2-8**], the pericardial effusion is slightly larger; still no evidence of frank tamponade, but careful serial clinical and echocardiographic followup is recommended.
#Dyspnea: CXR showed a large right sided pleural effusion of unknown etiology.
After his initial reaction to the rituxan, he was given lasix for diuresis which improved his saturation and his dyspnea.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # Chest xray shows large right pleural effusion of unknown etiology.
# Echocardiogram shows an increasing pericardial effusion that should be followed regularly.
