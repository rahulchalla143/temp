/ Theophylline / Nystatin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain, shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p Cardiac Catheterization (stable CAD, no intervention)   History of Present Illness: 76 year old female with history of CAD status post CABG in [**2145**] (SVG-LAD/D1), CHF (EF 30%), DM2, [**Hospital 109679**] transferred from [**Hospital1 56809**] for consideration of cardiac cath.
On arrival at Sturdy, she had mild rales, with CXR demonstrating mild CHF.
EKG demonstrated old LBBB, without new ST/T changes.
Initial troponin was < 0.02, with BNP of 432.
Her troponin rose from < 0.02 to 1.3, with CK and MB remaining within normal limits.
It was eventually decided to transfer her to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization to rule out ischemia.
Also of note, P-MIBI in [**4-17**] revealed a fixed large severe defect in the LAD territory, as well as a reversible small mild defect in the PDA territory.
She underwent catheterization in [**6-17**] which demonstrated an unchanged chronic 90% lesion in the non-dominant proximal RCA, diffuse disease in the LAD with a 50-60% mid-distal lesion, with likely total occlusion of D2, as well as diffuse disease in the LCx and LPDL.
[**2154**]: CATH:  Patient presented with recurrent angina and underwent catherization, which revealed moderate LAD disease, a 60-70% OM stenosis, and a 90% stenosis proximally in a diminutive non-dominant RCA.
She underwent DCA of the OM in lesion [**2155-7-8**].
[**4-17**] ECHO:  Patient underwent echo which showed overall left ventricular systolic function is moderate to severely depressed (EF 30%).
The cath showed the following results: LMCA demonstrated a 30% mid vessel stenosis, the LAD showed diffuse disease throughout the vessel with a mid-distal 50-60% lesion along with a likely total occlusion of the D2, the LCX showed diffuse plaguing with a 30% stenosis at two hinge points in the major inferolateral OM, the LPDA and LPL were small in diameter with diffuse disease, and the RCA was a very small non-dominant vessel with a chronic 90% proximal lesion.
Resting hemodynamic measurements showed elevated right and left filling pressures (mean RA 8mm Hg / mean PCWP 18mm Hg / LVEDP 25mm Hg)and mild pulmonary hypertension pulmonary artery pressure 48/17.
2) CHF:  Last echo [**4-17**] with resting regional wall motion abnormalities including septal, anterior and mid and apical lateral and apical inferolateral severe hypokinesis to akinesis, EF 30%.
2+ DP pulses bilaterally.

Echo ([**2167-7-17**]): Conclusions: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-4-14**], no obvious change in wall motion or overall EF.
MRA ([**2167-7-17**]): No significant renal artery stenosis bilaterally, however, the distal renal arteries are not well seen due to patient motion.
Cath ([**2167-7-20**]): 1.
The LAD demonstrated mild disease with a 50% mid vessel lesion along with a totally occluded D2.
The SVG-Lima was known occluded from prior catheterization and was not engaged.
LV ventriculography was deferred.
Renal Ultrasound [**2167-7-21**]: IMPRESSION:  Normal color flow to both kidneys.
CT chest/abd/pelvis w/contrast ([**2167-7-22**]): 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 year old female with history of CAD status post CABG in [**2145**] (SVG-LAD/D1), CHF (EF 30%), DM2, [**Hospital 109679**] transferred from [**Hospital1 56809**] for consideration of cardiac cath in the setting of recurrent episodes of shortness of breath and chest pain, thought to be acute pulmonary edema.
An echo was done ([**2167-7-17**]) prior to cath which showed no new changes except mild increased elevation PA pressure.
On [**2167-7-20**], patient sent for diagnostic cath only 2nd to febrile episodes.
Cath showed no new lesions and no further intervention was recommended.
EKG taken during episode showed no new changes.
Etiology likely due to anxiety, metastatic breast cancer or GI disease, which could be further worked up as an outpatient.
Urine cultures indicated S. Aureus coagulase positive, sensitive to oxacilin.
2 out 4 blood cultures grew coagulase negative staph.
Given her prior history of S. Aureus in her cultures, patient was sent for renal ultrasound, which was negative for renal abscess.
Additionally, TTE done on [**2167-7-20**] indicated no valvular diseases.
The department of Infectious Diseases was consulted and they indicated to repeat cultures and to label the sites from which they were drawn.
The positive cultures were determined to be skin contaminants.
All subsequent cultures have been negative and ID recommended stopping vancomycin.
Further, they indicated that the patient should have follow up blood and uring cultures drawn [**12-15**] wks and report those results with her primary care provider.
3) Chronic renal insufficiency:  Creatinine at baseline of 1.5, clearance is approximately 30.
Subsequent creatinine was found to be 1.3.
On [**2167-7-17**], it was decided to discontinue hydralazine and start Lisinopril 5mg qd and Bumex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
After [**2167-7-19**], patient's blood pressure was stable on the following regimen: Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], isorbide dinitrate 10mg tid, and Lisinopril 5mg qd.
Patient to follow up with primary care physician for INR checks.
INR goal is 2.0-3.0.
Hematocrit and hemoglobin stable and procrit to be continued at the discretion of outpatient physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
The patient's oncologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 109680**] recommended a torso CT scan with contrast to evaluate for possible additional metastases and other pathology.
CT scan was negative.
It was recommended by her oncologist to obtain CT scan of torso to evaluate for additional metastases.
CT scan indicated no new lesions.
