MRI Spine [**9-2**]:  Soft tissue mass involving L4, L5 and R psoas, extending into retroperitoneum.
CT abd/pelvis [**9-2**]:  IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**9-2**]:  ?LLL infiltrate.
Brief Hospital Course: ## Pancreatitis - pt found to have pancreatitis with elevation of amylase and lipase.
MRCP was done which showed proximal pancreatic duct obstruction by tumor with distal dilation.
After some improvement in abdominal pain and decrease in amylase and lipase, an ERCP was performed with stenting of her pancreatic duct.
Pt's abdominal pain gradually improved and amylase and lipase normalized.
## Pain control - pt was on a dilaudid PCA.
Blood cx's were persistently normal.
A UTI with enteroccocus on previous admission resolved and urine cx was negative.
Blood cultures remained negative.
Patient's foley was discontinued secondary to yeast which grew on urine cultures x2.
Repeat urinanalysis was negative for yeast.
Following pancreatic stenting, pt started taking clear sips and diet was advanced slowly as tolerated.
Pain was not well controlled on fentanyl patches and patient was resumed on original dilaudid PCA dosing from [**9-13**] prior to conversion.
