Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: The patient was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in [**2166**] after bone marrow biopsy was performed secondary to iron deficiency anemia workup.
Because of her debilitated state, [**Known firstname **] was not given any further treatment and she was sent home with increased support and to follow up with her local oncologist with a concern that her disease would relapse or progress further.
The feeling was that she developed issues with anal stricture after her cauda equina syndrome and radiation therapy along with a neurogenic rectum that did not empty fully.
She underwent an echocardiogram, which was noted for a drop in her ejection fraction to 35-40%.
She underwent an adenosine stress test, which did not show any evidence for coronary artery disease.
She did undergo a repeat echocardiogram on [**2175-6-12**], which showed improvement to about 40%.
There were no immature cells noted and white count, hematocrit and platelet count were normal.
Given the persistent change in her counts, [**Known firstname **] was seen today for further evaluation and was noted for 10% circulating blasts.
She underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and is being admitted for further evaluation and probable treatment.

nuc ish(DXZ1x2)[89]//(DXZ1,DYZ3)x1[111] FISH was performed on interphase nuclei with probes ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for DXZ1 (chromosome X alpha satellite DNA) at Xp11.1-q11.1 and DYZ3 (chromosome Y alpha satellite DNA) at Yp11.1-q11.1 probes.
A chimeric XX/XY hybridization pattern was observed, in which 89 cells were XX and 111 cells were XY.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**2-28**]: 1.
CSF [**2-29**]: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute leukemia.
CSF [**3-7**]: There is a minor population of CD34+ cells, which in conjunction with the morphology on the cytospin, are consistent with the patient's known leukemia.
CSF [**3-9**]: ATYPICAL.
CSF [**3-12**]: Cell marker analysis was performed, but was non-diagnostic in this case due to insufficient numbers of cells/insufficient amount of tissue for analysis and due to poor viability; however, morphologic assessment of the cytospin showed numerous blasts consistent with patient's known leukemia.
TTE [**3-1**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2172-4-1**], left ventricular systolic function is probably similar.
MR C/T/L spine [**3-1**]: 1.
CSF GRAM STAIN (Final [**2176-3-8**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2176-3-11**]):       SPECIMEN NO GROWTH ON REPLANT.
After C/T/L spine imaging, the patient's CSF was sampled and she was given IT MTX through an Ommaya biweekly for 2 weeks after her CSF cleared on [**2176-4-1**].
Peripheral blood smears showed resolution of peripheral blasts after 1-2 days of systemic chemotherapy.
History of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy: Repeat TTE showed improvement in EF from 35% in the past to 50% on [**3-1**].
Repeat echo on [**2176-3-27**] showed ER 40-45%, essentially unchanged from prior.
TSH was elevated upon admission although free T4 was within normal limits.
ECG was performed, and no obvious p-waves were noted.
Given her tenuous clinical status, respiratory alkalosis, and tachypnea, 15mg diltiazem was given x 1 with resulting improvement in her rate to the 70's.
Her blood pressure at that time was in the 70's systolic, and normal saline was hung wide open.
There was difficulty obtaining [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1131**] on the non-invasive blood pressure [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] phenylephrine was initiated to bring up the blood pressure.
Given the difficulty in obtaining an accurate blood pressure, several ([**6-5**]) attempts were made to place a radial arterial line to obtain arterial blood pressure.
During these attempts, her blood pressure ranged from 70-170 systolic (depending on the rate of phenylephrine infusion).
At 0121, her heart rate was noted to decline, and asystole was subsequently noted.
Within approximately 15 seconds, chest compressions were initiated.
ABG during code was 6.82/37/315/7.
A repeat ABG was 7.09/27/87/9 on FiO2 100%, PEEP 10, rate ~30, Tv 560.
Further MICU #1 ([**Date range (1) 31152**]) course:  # VRE in CNS:  Blood cx negative since [**4-11**], but now enterococcus in CSF, presumably the same bacteria.
Omaya port which was seeded has now been removed.
TTE was negative for vegetation [**4-15**], but given new finding of likely VRE in CSF, suspicion is high for endocarditis.
Meropenem was discontinued given low suspicion for gram negative process.
Differential includes sepsis, and her new leukocytosis would go along with this (although she is not neutropenic, on very broad abx coverage, and blood cx repeatedly negative).
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest, with ongoing primary metabolic alkalosis.
INR climbing, which may be secondary to synthetic dysfunction after hepatic injury.
Recent echo showed significant interval worsening of EF (40%-->20%) over the past 2 weeks without any focal wall motion abnormalities.
She will need a repeat echo in [**3-4**] weeks.
Speech and swallow evaluation recommended dysphagic diet, 1:1 observation.
# HYPONATREMIA:  Until [**4-23**] the patient had serum sodiums in the range of 135-137.
Her sodium declined to 125-127 until [**4-27**] when it began to further deline now to a nadir of 115.
Urine osms suggested SIADH, thought to be secondary to her  recent known intracranial empyema vs pulmonary processes.
# ANEMIA: received 2pRBCs w lasix in between to transfuse to Hct > 25.
Initial ABG 7.26/12/86/6 and written for ativan prn for anxiety.
Pt transferred for acute respiratory failure (s/p intubation on [**5-6**]), thought to be [**1-1**] shock - cardiogenic vs septic vs combination.
Diuresed as tolerated by blood pressure with lasix 40mg IV x 1 daily (required one dose albumin for support).
Blood, urine and sputum culture negative.
Video swallow study was deferred as patient was too weak and sleepy to cooperate.
During this time, the pt's pulse was maintained and chest compressions were not required.
Stat aline was placed in sterile conditions in R femoral and ABG obtained revealed 7.05/33/34/10 with lactate 8.5.
Pressors were turned off and pt's BPs decreased to 30/10s; however, she did not expire until ETT was removed several hours later.
