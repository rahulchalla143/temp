Hypoglycemia:  Patient had a recent CT on [**2134-8-12**], which showed progressive disease per primary oncologist.
On hospital day #3, the patient's IV Fluids were stopped, and his finger stick glucoses remained within normal limits.
Patient does not endorse any symptoms, and urine cultures grew Klebsiella Oxytoca.
An ABG was performed on the patient, which showed a normal pH, but a decreased CO2 to 20, significant for a chronic process.
It was recommended that the patient visit his urologist at his convenience to have a loopogram performed to assess the patency of his ileoconduit.
Patient's vital signs are stable, and his fingerstick glucose levels have all been within normal limits.
Your blood sugars remained stable on this regimen, so we took you off of the IV fluids.
Please return to the ED or your healthcare provider immediately if you experience confusion, low blood sugars, weakness, lethargy, chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, or any other concerning symptoms.
