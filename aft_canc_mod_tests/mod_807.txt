He was brought to the Emergency Room for evaluation of his change in mental status.
History of an L4-5 lumbar discectomy in [**2105-1-27**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of admission, prior to his seizure, the patient had a temperature of 99.9; pulse of 72; respirations 16; blood pressure 157/86; saturating 99% on room air.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  NCAT.
Pulmonary examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Reflexes were 2+ and symmetric throughout with flexor plantar responses bilaterally.
Sensory, coordination and gait testing were not able to be completed prior to the onset of his seizure.
He was then taken for a head CT which showed a hypodensity within the left anterior frontal lobe but no evidence of hemorrhage or shift.
He was then given more Ativan and sent for a magnetic resonance scan of the head, which again showed an abnormality in the left medial anterior temporal lobe.
The location and appearance of the initial magnetic resonance scan was concerning for possible HSV encephalitis, especially in the setting of low grade fevers, seizures and change in mental status.
He had multiple cultures sent which showed evidence of a urinary tract infection.
He had a lumbar puncture in the Emergency Room, which was traumatic with tube one which had 16 white cells and 13,800 red cells which were 86% polys.
Tube four had three white cells and 1,153 red cells with 90% polys, protein was 40; glucose 79.
HSV PCR was sent for the spinal fluid, which returned negative several days later.
He was also seen by neurology/oncology, who felt that the appearance of the lesion on magnetic resonance scan was more consistent with a low grade glioma or astrocytoma than with an infectious process.
He was also instructed not to restart his Wellbutrin as it can lower seizure threshold.
The patient was told to check his Dilantin trough in one to two weeks and was given a prescription for this purpose.
RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP:  He is to have MR spectroscopy imaging at 8:15 a.m. on [**2106-3-1**] on [**Hospital1 19583**] campus.
