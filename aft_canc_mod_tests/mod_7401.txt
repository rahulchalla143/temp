Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably mildly depressed.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of  [**2176-12-20**], regional LV systolic dysfunction is now suggested.

His sputum cultures then grew back Coag + staph sensitive to oxacillin and vanco was switched to oxacillin.
It was felt his resp distress was secondary to pulm edema/volume overload and we was therefore diuresed with PRN lasix 40 mg.  Over LOS in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was roughly -1.2 L.  An echocardiogram revealed the patient had deteriorated LV function and new wall motion abnormalities.
Repeat CXR revealed stable lower lobe infiltrates but almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema.
