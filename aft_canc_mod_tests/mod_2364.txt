Admission Date:  [**2178-9-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2178-10-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2142-5-20**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Blue Surgery HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 43972**] is a 36-year-old male with a past medical history of Hodgkin's lymphoma treated approximately 15 years ago with staging laparotomy, splenectomy and nodal sampling followed by x-ray radiation therapy, the subsequent diagnosis two years ago of ITP with evidence of splenosis by CT scan, which was treated with Prednisone IgG, and recently treated with Rituxan with good effect.
CT scan was obtained from an outside hospital which demonstrated a focal area of small bowel wall thickening, portal vein thrombosis and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis.
It was felt at that time that patient was experiencing worsening mesenteric ischemia and was admitted for exploratory laparotomy to assess the viability of his small bowel.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97, blood pressure 172/91, respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation 93% on room air.
Respiratory exam was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal exam showed a firm abdomen with right sided tenderness, no shake tenderness, no cough tenderness.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission the patient had a white count of 13.1, hematocrit of 39.1, platelet count 148,000.
Electrolytes, sodium 141, potassium 3.3, BUN and creatinine 14 and 0.9, glucose 112.
At the time of admission prothrombin time of 23.3 and INR was 2.0.
His liver function tests were all within normal limits with albumin of 3.2.
The CAT scan on admission from the outside hospital again showed small bowel wall thickening, portal vein thrombosis and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis.
The patient was taken for a repeat CT angiogram.
Given the severe pain and clinical exam as well as CT findings, consent was obtained to proceed with the exploratory laparotomy.
Exploratory laparotomy was performed with the preoperative diagnosis of ischemic bowel.
Upon admission to the surgical Intensive Care Unit the patient was noted to have laboratory values of white count 16.3, hematocrit 33.1, platelet count 99,000.
[**Name (NI) 2591**], PT 15.5, PTT 29.2, INR 1.7, BUN and creatinine were stable as were his liver function tests.
Systolic blood pressure was maintained with fluid boluses and he was left intubated.
His coag values were followed q 6 hours and Heparin drip was begun on the patient.
In the surgical ICU on [**2178-9-27**] values drawn at midnight showed a PT of 16.1, PTT 29.9, INR 1.8.
On the patient's Heparin drip PT was found to increase at 4 a.m. to 12.0, PTT was found to be 39.9 and the patient's INR was 2.0.
On exam the morning of [**2178-9-28**] the patient was found to be stable, good urine output, we continued to check hematocrit q 6 hours.
It was decided at this time to start TPN on the patient to increase his Heparin to maintain a goal PTT of 55 to 70.
On exam the patient's abdomen was found to be markedly distended.
We continued to check his hematocrit q 6 hours which was found to be fairly stable throughout his hospitalization.
During the day, however, his platelet count continued to decline to a value in the 50's.
On [**2178-9-29**] laboratory values demonstrated a platelet count of 30 with [**Date Range **] demonstrating an adequate PTT of 55.
The patient's hematocrit continued to be stable at 26.3.
On [**2178-9-30**] the patient's negative Heparin induced thrombocytopenia panel was felt that his platelet drop was most likely due to recurrence of his ITP and it was decided at that time to give IVIG of 1 gm/kg in a divided dose over approximately two days.
The patient's platelet count was found to respond to this IVIG regimen increasing to a value of 53.
His NG output was noted to be moderately decreased over the day and it was decided at that point to discontinue his Foley catheter and continue to try and get his Heparin to a therapeutic PTT value.
The patient's Heparin dose was running at a value of 2100 units per hour, PTT was found to be value of 52.2.
It was decided at that time to change his central line to check a clostridium difficile toxin assay.
Culture of the central line tip was negative.
It was decided at this time to increase the patient's Heparin drip to a value of 2400 units per hour, rechecking the laboratory values on the morning of [**2178-10-5**] demonstrating PTT of 60.6.
The patient's hematocrit was again noted to be stable.
He was tolerating full liquid diet, his pain control is with oral pain medications, he is therapeutic on a Heparin drip with a PTT value of 84 this morning.
From a GI standpoint the patient is status post exploratory laparotomy with resection of 50 cm of mid to distal ileum for mesenteric ischemia, most likely induced by venous congestion.
Pathology showed no evidence of recurrent lymphoma.
Until his Coumadin dose is therapeutic with an INR of 2.5.
