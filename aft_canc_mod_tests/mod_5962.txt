His blood pressure at baseline is 90/60 but he dropped transiently to the 70s and he was given 3.8 L IVF.
He had a diagnostic paracentesis which was negative for SBP.

CXR [**2180-8-17**]: IMPRESSION: Interval increase in size of a right-sided pleural effusion which is large.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Echocardiogram [**2180-8-17**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Paracentesis was negative for SBP with a SAAG > 1.1.
Abdominal and pelvis CT scan was negative for acute pathology.
No further workup was pursued.
Hypotension:  Patient's blood pressure transiently decreased to the high 70s in the emergency room but he was asymptomatic.
His baseline blood pressures run in the low 90s and s/p resuscitation he remained within his baseline.
He had an echocardiogram which showed a mildly depressed EF compared to priors but was otherwise not significantly changed.
No further workup was performed.
His blood pressures for the remainder of his hospitalization ranged in the low 90s to low 100s systolic.
He did have one transient episode of blood pressures in the 70s systolic during hemodialysis during which time he was asymptomatic and his hypotension resolved with a small fluid bolus.
Cytology was pending at the time of dischage.
Echocardiogram during this hospitalization showed mildly decreased LVEF compared to priors with severe tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
He had two stool samples which were negative for clostridium difficle.
Renal Cell Carcinoma:  Patient is s/p resection of renal cell carcinoma in [**2172**], now with new lesion on CT scan followed by urology.
The lesion was noted on CT scan and was felt to be related to the chostochondral junction.
No further workup was pursued.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 1,000 unit Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO once a day.
You had a diagnostic paracentesis which was negative for SBP and a CT scan which showed fluid in your abdomen but otherwise no acute abnormalities.
