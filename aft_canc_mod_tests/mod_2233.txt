Mildly distended loops of bowel in upper abdomen are incompletely evaluated on the chest radiograph examination which could be more fully assessed with standard abdominal views if warranted clinically.
Tachycardia was evaluated by EKG several times with no evidence of ST/T changes and negative troponins.
TTE was performed on POD#2 with no wall motion abnormalities and an EF of 55%.
On POD#5, Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8783**] TEE with no evidence of intraatrial thrombus and an EF of 55%.
