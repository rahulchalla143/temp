This was followed by chest wall XRT and adjuvant chemotherapy.

[**3-24**] CT Head w/o contrast: CT HEAD WITH CONTRAST: Compared to [**2190-2-1**], there has been significant improvement in the degree of metastatic disease burden with most of the previously identified enhancing lesions no longer seen.
[**4-12**] Pa/Lat IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2190-3-25**]:  Small left pleural effusion or pleural scarring is unchanged since [**2190-3-10**].
Lung volumes are lower exaggerating heart size, which is mildly enlarged.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Portal venous air is seen.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: The bladder, rectum, sigmoid are unchanged.
[**3-29**] Ct abd/pelvis TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast multidetector CT acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis.
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Lung bases are clear.
Compared to the prior exam from [**2190-3-26**], there is a marked to complete resolution of the previously described intramural gas within the stomach wall.
Small stable retroperitoneal lymphnodes are present, which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, bladder, sigmoid colon are within normal limits.
Compared to prior CT from [**2190-3-26**], there is a marked to almost complete resolution of the previously described intramural gas within the stomach wall.
[**4-8**] CT head w/o contrast: FINDINGS: The small focus of residual enhancement in the right frontal lobe medially (3:11) is unchanged.
# GI bleed: pt w/ lg hematemesis several nights prior to so was transfused 1 U PRBC and kept overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] but hct and BP stable so sent back to the floor.
GI aware but no plan for further work-up given prognosis.
KUB negative [**4-7**] for obstruction.
Head CT for increased masses/elevated intracranial pressure negative (stable disease) so likely not contributing to vomitting ([**4-8**]).
PRN zofran, ativan, zyprexa and phenergan also ordered with minimal relief.
An NGT was placed at one point [**12-18**] hematemasis but she states that she was more comfortable with it out.
Blood cultures pedning NGTD.
CT torso done and concerning for air in stomach wall and portal vein but f/u CT showed resolution.
CT head and torso demonstarte interval improvement of metastatic disease.
started on GCSF [**2-26**] with good response, d/c'd [**2-28**] as WBC 10.2, WBC then dropped to nadir 1.9. .
Possibly related to RP mets given abdominal CT [**2190-1-16**] showed enhancement adjacent to the right adrenal, which if larger could be causing this pain though no comment on this on CT [**2190-2-24**].
CT head with contrast noteable for decrease in mets from [**2190-2-1**] with no new lesions, no edema or mass effect.
