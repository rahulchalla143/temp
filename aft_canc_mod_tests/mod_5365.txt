She had a recent admission for debulking nephrectomy for her RCC however, it was never performed as she developed gram negative bacteremia (B fragilis in [**12-5**] bottles) and subsequent bowel perforation.

The patient was admitted to the MICU service for close monitoring and ventilatory support.
A thoracentesis was performed on HD2 for the large R pleural effusion, with removal of approximately 700cc fluid which was consistent with a transudate, and negative for malignant cells.
Was scheduled for debulking surgery during previous admission which did not occur [**12-22**] colonic perforation.
Tests for c diff sent which were positive and started Flagyl for treatment.
Ultrasound of the lower extremities was negative for DVT.
The patient's blood pressure was initially difficult to control, requiring a labetalol gtt which was eventually transitioned to PO.
However, after PEA arrest, her blood pressure has been low, so discontinued all antihypertensives.
The patient while on Tele on the floor was found to be agonal and bradycardic to the 30s without a palpable pulse; the patient was quickly intubated, CPR was intiated, and she received one dose of atropine with return of a palpable pulse and blood pressure.
A CTA was done and was negative for PE and serial cardiac biomarkers were negative as a possible etiology of the PEA arrest.
It was then noted that the pt's urine output dropped and her creatinine rose to 1.1, thought to be [**12-22**] contrast dye nephropathy from the CTA done previously, as well as the cardiac arrest/hypotension.
Renal u/s revealed new hematoma around her foley, so a three-way foley was placed and continuous bladder irrigation was done.
Renal Her creatinine slowly improved, and her urine output increased slowly.
For her anemia, iron studies were consistent with anemia of chornic disease likely [**12-22**] her renal cell carcinoma and was started on Epogen.
