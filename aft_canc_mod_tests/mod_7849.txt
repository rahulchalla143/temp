**FINAL REPORT [**2192-12-10**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2192-12-10**]):       MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH SKIN       AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.
On [**11-24**] her pain increased and she had a stat CTA which showed an unchanged appearance of SMA thrombus and no direct or indirect evidence of mesenteric ischemia.
Catheterization of aorta.
Abdominal aortogram with mesenteric angiography.
ACS then did an exploratory laparoscopy and found no evidence of bowel ischemia.
Her coumadin was restarted with an INR goal of 3.0-3.5 .
Her h/h had fallen and she was transfused for a hct of 25 on [**12-3**].
She responded appropriately but on [**12-4**] her hct was down to 25.1.
By this point she was having melena and her hct continued to fall.
She was prepped appropriately and had an EGD on [**12-5**] which showed erosive gastritis in the stomach body and antrum.
Then on [**12-6**] she had colonoscopy which showed a 20 mm polyp which was treated with an endoloop.
Her h/h was stable for several days, and her INR was therapeutic and discharge planning was initiated.
On [**12-11**], her hct was drifting down.
Her surgical issues were stable and the decision was made to transfer the patient to the medicine team for further monitoring and treatment.
As of 2300, her BP slipped into the 70s, though she continued to mentate normally without lightheadedness, chest pain or pressure.
Her bp meds were stopped and she received a liter of NS and her fourth pRBC transfusion of the day with improvement of her SBP to 100-105.
Her current INR was 4.3.
An EGD was performed that showed friability and erythema of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum.
Her hematocrit was routinely monitored and she was transfused as needed for Hcts in the low - mid 20s.
Given the persistence of her melena, however, she underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy and EGD on [**2192-12-20**], the results of which were notable only for a nonbleeding polyp in the sigmoid colon (previously seen on prior [**Last Name (un) **]) as well as some friability of the duodenum which was clipped and injected with epinephrine.
She remained on an argatroban gtt until her true INR was >3.0 .
Her true INR wasd 3.3 and she was not having any melena or other GI symptoms.
Her INR is therapeutic and she is scheduled for very close monitoring of her h/h and INR with her PCP.

BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING We stopped all of your BP meds (valsartan/hctz and toprol xl).
Please have your blood pressure checked several times per week.
Follow up with PCP regarding restarting your blood pressure meds   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Abdominal pain/ Mesenteric ischemia -Left Brachial artery emboli -GI bleed/ Erosive gastritis -Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia  Secondary: Bilateral Lower extremity ischemia with pain HTN Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You then had an exploratory laparoscopy to evaluate for dead bowel.
You had concern for GI bleeding and had an endoscopy and colonoscopy by the GI team.
The egd (upper scope) showed erosive esophagitis which was thought to be the cause of bleeding.
The colonoscopy showed a polyp in the sigmoid colon which was removed, and diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon.
Take Coumadin daily as directed - your INR goal is now 3.0 - 3.5 Do not stop Aspirin/Plavix/or Coumadin unless your [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Surgeon instructs you to do so.
