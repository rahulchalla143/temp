Blood and urine cultures were taken in clinic.
CXR  was done which was negative for an infiltrate.
On [**2-24**], Cefepime was switched to [**Last Name (un) **]/Vanco as his blood cultures grew out Coagulase negative staph and strep viridans.
Bm Bx done on [**3-9**] showed 50% plasma cells.
The patient remained AF post transplant, but had signs of worsening disease: (IgG increased to ?9000 and right middle lobe mass thought possibly to be a plasmacytoma showed increasing size on repeat CT.  Due to concern for recurrent disease, he was started thalidomide [**4-28**] for treatment of myeloma as his disease was previously responsive to this.
A pulmonary consult was called and a bronchoscopy performed on [**4-22**] which showed no endobronchial lesions and friable mucosa generally throughout the right middle and lower lobes.
Biopsy was performed which resulted in bleeding but hemostasis was obtained.
In the ICU he was diuresed and his bronchoscopy results demonstrated ASPERGILLUS SP.
The biopsy demonstrated Dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate containing fungal organisms (branched, septate), best see on PAS-reacted sections.
CXR on [**5-14**] showed worsening of his pulmonary findings.
After a long course in the hospital, on [**4-20**] his creatinine started to rise from a baseline of 1.2 and by [**5-3**] had progressed to 3.0.
His creatinine continued to rise and on [**5-10**] he began dialysis.
A head CT w/ and w/out contrast was performed which showed "large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right parietal-occipital lobe region,  with extension into the right lateral and fourth ventricles, effacement of the basal cisterns, right hippocampal and subfalcine herniation.
# Bacteremia: On cultures drawn on admission, he grew 2 bottles of coagulase negative staph and 1 bottle of strep viridans.
He was initially placed on Cefepime and Vancomycin, however after his cultures grew out he was changed to Meropenem and Vancomycin.
His fever curve trended back to normal.
Because of the culture positive for Strep viridans and question of possible endocarditis, an echocardiogram was done which showed a small fluttering echodensity on the aortic annulus which was stable from an echocardiogram three weeks earlier.
Multiple blood cultures were  negative and cefepime and vancomycin were stopped after he was afebrile for 2 weeks.
Transfusion reaction: A blood transfusion was stopped on [**2-24**], as the patient was febrile during the transfusion.
An investigation was done and the conclusion was that the fever was  likely due to the patient's bacteremia and was unrelated to the transfusion.
He was seen by dermatology who did a biopsy on [**2-24**].
# Transaminitis- patient has underlying fatty liver seen on RUQ US and MRI and then voriconazole was started which caused a rise  in his LFTs.
