At that time he refused a lung biopsy after diffuse nodular infiltrates were wound on chest CT and decided to be do not resuscitate/do not intubate.
He was admitted for workup of his shortness of breath for cardiac versus pulmonary causes.
He is now willing to undergo a repeat bronchoscopy as the lesions on his chest x-ray have now increased in size.
His blast count was 5%.
Diffuse pulmonary disease of unclear etiology diagnosed by chest CT in [**2196-10-6**] with shortness of breath and increased oxygen requirement.
A bronchoscopy was negative.
His ejection fraction was 50% on an echocardiogram in [**2196-4-5**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed an elderly man who was slightly short of breath at rest.
He was afebrile with a temperature of 97.6, a blood pressure of 122/58, pulse of 67, respiratory rate of 24, satting 94% on 5 liters nasal cannula.
His head, ears, nose, eyes and throat examination was unremarkable.
His neurologic examination was nonfocal.
His skin revealed petechiae along his bilateral lower extremities.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  His laboratories were significant for a hematocrit of 25.4, platelet count of 97, and a white blood cell count of 3.5.
His blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were at their baseline at 38 and 1.
His differential revealed 42% neutrophils, 16% bands, 25% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, 5% metas, 3% myelocytes, 4% blasts, and 1 nucleated red blood cell.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His chest x-ray showed an increased alveolar and interstitial markings bilaterally; especially, in the left middle and left lower lobe, corny background of chronic lung disease with question of alveolar hemorrhage versus multifocal pneumonia versus asymmetric congestive heart failure.
There was no change in his oxygen needs, and he continued at his baseline of 5 liters nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation in the lower 90s.
A high-resonance CT and echocardiogram were performed.
His CT revealed worsening diffuse interstitial an alveolar lung disease with progression in the left upper lobe, periphery of the right apex and right middle lobe, as well as in the anterior and lateral left lower lobe.
The Pulmonary consultation team stated that the lesions seen on CT could be biopsied by bronchoscopy.
However, his echocardiogram revealed moderate-to-severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with PAFP of 50 mmHg to 61 mmHg.
This was a new finding since his last echocardiogram in [**2196-4-5**].
As his pulmonary hypertension was so severe, transbronchial biopsy would be dangerous as an accidental injury to the pulmonary artery to lead to exsanguination.
After extensive discussion with the patient he stated that he did not want aggressive interventions such as surgical biopsy and understood that this would mean that the progressive lung process could therefore not be diagnosed.
