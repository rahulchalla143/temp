Head CT was negative at OSH.
* In our ED, she received lasix 60 IV x1 with minimal response, placed on propofol, and had a CT of her abdomen due to a distended abdomen.
CHF 3.
MRI abdomen: 1) Giant cavernous hemangioma of the right lobe of the liver measuring 27.2 x 21.3 x 21.1 cm.
CXR on admission showed bilateral retrocardiac opacity and later showed RUL opacity.
Sputum culture from [**6-26**] grew MRSA.
She was initially given Lasix 100 mg IV for a concern for CHF from pulmonary edema seen on CXR but was later thought unlikely since her CVP was only 10.
Her urine output picked up and now making adequate urine.
Her Creatinine normalized to 2.8.
She had episodes of SVT to 140's with hypotension to SBP 80's on [**2175-6-29**] of what appears as AVNRT.
Later, she started to make adequate urine, and her creatinine eventually came down to 2.7 which is where it stabilized.
Cr 2.7 is likely her new baseline per renal.
She passed swallow evaluation and was able to tolerate po diet with normal consistency and thin liquids.
Her EKG and rhythm strips were reviewed by the EP team who recommended medical management at this time with a beta-blocker.
Hct prior to discharge after the transfusion was stable at 28-29.
She needs to have her Hct checked frequently.
If she continues to have a decline in Hct despite increased Epogen dose, she would need an outpatient EGD + colonoscopy to rule out GI bleed.
The CT and MRI of abdomen again demonstrated giant mass that appears as hemangioma.
