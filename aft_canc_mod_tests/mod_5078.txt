The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] and underwent a CT scan which confirmed the finding at [**Hospital3 **].
Lysis of adhesions showed a transition point in the mid jejunum with some lysis of adhesions but this did not appear to be the cause for his bowel obstruction.
He continued to require labetalol and nicardipine to control his blood pressure.
Decompressive laparotomy showed massive dilated loops of bowel without specific obstruction.
On [**4-29**] the opened abdomen was removed and bowel was visualized and appeared to be pink and viable.
