He reportedly had a U/A and culture sent 3 days prior to admission which revealed VRE (reportedly only sensitive to macrodantin) and proteus.
He was, however, afebrile and systolic blood pressures were consistently in the 100s-120s.
His mental status declined overnight at the nursing home and he was transferred to the ED for further evaluation and management.
In the ED, his initial vitals revealed: HR 107 BP 98/28 RR 14 O2sat 100%on NRB-->RA; no temperature was recorded.
Labs demonstrated WBC count of 27 with 16% bandemia and an elevated lactate to 10.5 which decreased to 8.6 with IV fluids.
A CT abd/pelvis was obtained to rule out bowel ischemia and surgery was consulted.
CT abd/pelvis did not reveal ischemia of the gut, but did note thickening of perirectal and sigmoid wall believed consistent with chronic laxative use vs. infectious/inflammatory etiology.
A CXR showed a retrocardiac opacity thought to represent atelectasis vs. consolidation.
Blood and urine cultures were sent and he received vanco/levofloxacin/flagyl.
Given his altered mental status, a head CT was obtained which was negative for hemorrhage and mass effect.

Brief Hospital Course: #Urosepsis - ICU course: On presentation the patient met criteria for SIRS and sepsis: WBC of 27, tachycardic and a source of infection, thought to be most likely urosepsis given frank pus drainage from the bladder, history of recurrent infections and his foley found to be obstructed.
Per nursing home report, urine cultures from 3 days PTA grew VRE (sensitivities unknown) and proteus.
The CT of the abdomen did not appear consistent with bowel ischemia, but the patient was initially started on flagyl given colonic thickening.
A cortisol stimulation test was negative for adrenal suppression.
CVP was maintained between [**7-5**] with 500cc LR boluses on day 3, and the patient did not require additional boluses on day 4.
Blood cultures grew GNRs which were identified as proteus on day 3 (sensitivities above) ([**2171-6-27**]).
Multiple tests done to identify source of infection - MRI spine - no abscess or osteomyelitis, ECHO no IE.
ID was consulted and CT abd, HIDA done that confirmed acute cholecystitis.
WBC scan prior to dc was normal.
He is to complete a 2 wk course of IV aztreonam - day 1 [**2171-7-15**].
Patient may be advised if an SPC is desired to see Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] in clinic given recurrent UTIs and [**Last Name (STitle) 27285**] obstruction due to MS.  [**Last Name (STitle) **] disorder: The patient had a tonic-clonic [**Last Name (STitle) 862**] on the first night of admission, that resolved spontaneously within 2 minutes.
His phenytoin and carbamazapine levels were normal.
Given frank pus from bladder, ascending b/l pyelo was a concern, but CT A/P, albeit without contrast, did not show evidence of this.
Creatinine back to baseline 2-3 days after initiation of volume resuscitation.
Coagulopathy: INR was elevated to 1.5, then 2.2 in the absence of blood thinning agents.
Platelet count was normal.
D-dimer decreasing steadily, stable fibrinogen reassuring that DIC is unlikely.
- INR normalized with 3 daily doses of vitamin K .
MB index negative x2.
Ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes, cardiac ischemia was unlikely.
Repeat CT abdomen without evidence of pancreatitis, but GB distension and edema with stones.
