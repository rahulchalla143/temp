She was initially admitted to the ICU and her hematocrit remained stable and she did not require any blood transfusions.
She underwent an EGD which showed an ulcerating mass in the 3rd part of the duodenum.
Final pathology is consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Colonoscopy showed  severe diverticulosis.
Upon transfer to the oncology service, her Hct dropped to 27 and she required a total of 2 blood transfusions.
Angiography was an option but was deferred since patient was thought to have a slow bleed and this study would likely not be useful.
Her hematocrit remained stable during the rest of her stay and she had no further bleeding.
She was restarted on beta-blocker with some improvement but her heart rate still remained high.
She also found to have a UTI which may have contributed to her tachycardia.
