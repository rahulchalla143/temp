Since admission, Brain MRI done [**8-3**] was also suggestive of PRES but could not optimally assess for brain mets as this was done without contrast given the pt's acute renal failure.
She continues on the nicardipine gtt to achieve goal SBP <140, with hydralazine standing + PRN and labetalol PRN as well to titrate this off.

Her renal function was elevated since admission, with Cr in the 1.8-1.9 range, but she has been maintaining good urine output and this has trended down to 1.5.
Her FeNa was 0.7% on [**8-4**], suggesting a pre-renal etiology, so she has received significant IV fluids.
HIT Ab and Coombs were negative and ADAMTS13 was normal.
Finally, she developed a ventilator-associated pneumonia, with CXR showing a right hilar infiltrate and possible left lower lobe consolidation, and BAL sample showing GPRs, so she has been covered broadly with Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Ciprofloxacin.
A brain MR has been ordered to help determine etiology of patient's hallucinations and delusions and  demonstrated no acute changes and no evidence of intracranial metastases.
Head CT without contrast showed no acute changes.
UA and urine culture negative.
Blood cultures showed no growth.
Lumbar puncture was unsuccesful.
Creatinine has improved from that point.
Creatinine returned to baseline.
# Malignant HTN To anticipate eventual discharge home, anti-hypertensive regimen was simplified to Labetalol 300 mg TID, which controlled patient's blood pressure well.
CT scan given following quick-onset headache.
Kept on labetolol 300 mg TID, which controlled blood pressure.
Hematocrit remained steady during medicine course and patient had no complaints suggestive of anemia.
