A CXR was performed noted a new RLL consolidation.
She underwent an open biopsy of the left breast that showed infiltrating lobular carcinoma, ER negative, and Her2/neu positive.
Her neurological problems began in mid-[**2138-4-26**] when she experienced gradually worsening headaches.
Head CT and MRI showed a mass in the left cerebellum.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2141-11-6**] the rate is increased.
CXR ([**2143-11-15**]): 1.
NCHCT ([**2143-11-15**]): 1.
Mucosal sinus disease and opacification of the right mastoid air cells, grossly stable since prior MRI from [**2143-8-30**].
CTA chest ([**2143-11-16**]): 1.
A followup chest CT following treatment and resolution of symptoms is recommended.
TTE ([**2143-11-19**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
IMPRESSION: moderate pulmonary hypertension with a dilated right ventricle and moderate-to-severe tricsupid regurgitation  CT Head ([**2143-11-24**]): No acute intracranial injury.
CT C-spine ([**2143-11-24**]: 1.
Chest Xray ([**2143-11-26**]: Severity of the global pulmonary opacification has worsened since [**11-25**] indicating progression of a component of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage superimposed on extensive pulmonary metastatic involvement.
The CT did however show diffuse ground-glass opacities and septal thickening and small bilateral effusions, concerning for possible lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
She underwent speech and swallow evaluation and was found to have silent aspirations which was likely to exacerbate her hypoxia.
Because of a worsening respiratory status, she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management of hypoxia and respiratory distress.
Urine legionella, and influenza were negative.
Blood, and urine cultures were negative.
Induced sputum was negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] only grew normal oropharyngeal flora.
TTE showed moderate pulmonary hypertension with a dilated right ventricle and moderate-to-severe tricsupid regurgitation.
Given the patient's respiratory ditress, and per discussion with the patient and family, a transbronchial biopsy was not attempted.
Her neurologist, oncologist and primary care physician were notified.
Seizure: Patient had an EEG which showed no overt electrographic seizure activity, but suggested a possible focus of cortical irritability and potential for epileptogenesis as well as subcortical dysfunction in the left mid to posterior temporal region.
Prolactin levels were within normal limits.
