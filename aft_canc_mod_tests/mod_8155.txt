Imaging [**2111-1-29**]: CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS 1.
If the patient is postmenopausal, then a follow up pelvic ultrasound is recommended in three months for further [**Year/Month/Day 2742**].
CT HEAD IMPRESSION: 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm area of hyperdensity located within the posterior aspect of the right pons, likely hemorrhage, but an underlying vascular malformation (ie.
Recommend MR for further [**Year/Month/Day 2742**].
CT C-Spine IMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment.
MRI brain: Findings are most suggestive of a cavernoma with adjacent developmental venous anomaly.
Follow up MRI can be performed to assess for any change if clinical concern persists  Repeat CT head [**2111-1-30**]:  1.0cm hyperdense lesion in right superoposterior pons, likely a  cavernoma   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the trauma service on [**2111-1-29**] after a loss of consciousness which resulted in an MVC.
CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored and were normal.
A syncope work-up was initiated, including cycling cardiac enzymes (negative x 4), ECG on arrival (NSR) and monitoring on telemetry x 2 days (no significant arrhthymias noted).
The patient will need to have an echocardiogram as an out-patient to evaluate for wall motion abnormalities, valvular dysfunction or chamber enlargement.
Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

*In [**Hospital1 2742**] after your accident, you were found to have a lesion in your brainstem called a Cavernoma (a malformed vein).
*Given the loss of consiousness prior to your accident, you were kept in the hospital to evaluate your heart with continuous monitoring (to look for any abnormal heart rhythms) and blood tests (to look for a heart attack).
