Blood pressure is 100/70, heart rate is 96.
After CAT scan and surgical evaluation it was decided that she had an acute abdomen, and we decided to do a laparotomy.
On the laparotomy she was found to have extensive ganglion of her small bowel.
Most of her small bowel was resected, and an SMA thrombectomy was performed by the Vascular Surgery service at the same time.
A second-look laparotomy was performed the next day, and more small bowel resected.
Finally, due to lack of improvement in her condition, and as per her and the family's wishes, she was transferred to Hospice care.
