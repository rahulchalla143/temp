[**5-1**] ECHO: Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Subsuquent exam (45 minutes later): Patient on no vasoactive drips.
LVEF >55%.
Remaing exam unchanged.
The right hepatic artery could not be identified on this exam and a repeat ultrasound in 24 hours is recommended.
The patient lost 3L of blood and received 6units of pRBC and 5L crytaloid in addition to ffp and plt.
An Echo and EKG were unremarkable.
His hematocrit remained stable.
On [**5-1**], a liver ultrasound showed patent and appropriate portal veins and hepatic veins.
His hepB surface antigen was positive so he received 10000Units of HBIG in OR and 5000units daily for the next 5 days.
Due to this concerning study, a hepatic angiogram was performed, which showed a kink/bend seen at the site of the presumed arterial anastomosis of the hepatic artery.
A repeat US performed the next day ([**5-5**]) showed significant improvement in arterial flow since yesterday with normal sharp upstroke is identified today in the main hepatic artery and left hepatic artery as described above.
