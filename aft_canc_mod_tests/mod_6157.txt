Vitals on admission were HR 100 111/74 15 99%3L  On the floor, had A. Fib with RVR in 120's.
got 250cc bolus at that point with BP in 90's systolic.
HR increased to 130's with systolic BP in mid 80's.
Got further 500cc's, and BP improved to mid 90's.
HR still 110 so go another 500cc bolus.
At time of ICU evaluation patient with RR 24-26 on 5L via face mask and c/o shortness of breath.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2185-3-20**] no diagnostic interval change.
Comparison is also made with a CT chest from [**2185-3-20**].
[**2185-4-14**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation at a rate of 112.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2185-4-14**] these changes are similar to those seen at that time.
[**2185-4-14**] CXR: SINGLE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is unchanged severe cardiomegaly.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with septal hypokinesis (LVEF= 45-50 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-3-10**], findings are similar.
Small echodense structure seen on aortic valve in the prior study slightly more prominent in the current study but could be due to differences in image quality.
Increased diameter of the right pulmonary hilus is noted; however, when reviewing previous CT from [**2185-3-12**], it is seen that this is not caused by pathologic mass.
[**4-19**] CT Abd/Pelvis:   1.
Short interval followup is recommended with dedicated chest CT in three months.
This examination is not sensitive for the detection of colonic masses.
Emphysema, atelectasis, pleural effusions, and right atrial enlargement.
[**4-26**] CXR:  In comparison with study of [**4-25**], there is little overall change.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the proximal ascending colon.
# Bacteremia/Sepsis: Blood cultures drawn on admission grew Enterococcus faecalis.
A trans-thoracic echo was performed to evaluate for possible vegetation, which showed an echodense structure on the aortic valve.
To further evaluate, an transesophageal echo was obtained, which showed no endocarditis.
Subsequent cultures were negative, although the patient's VRE rectal swab was positive.
There was no evidence of pulmonary infection on imaging and urine legionella was negative.
His hematocrit dropped to 22.
He underwent CT angiogram of his abdomen, which was negative for aortoenteric fistula.
The patient subsequently underwent colonoscopy which was unrevealing for acute bleed, but erythematous mucosa was biopsied to evaluate for arteriovenous malformation.
His aspirin and warfarin had been held, but were restarted on his day of transfer to rehab, as his hematocrit had been stable with no further bleeds for about a week.
Urine culture with sensitive Klebsiella.
Sodium levels subsequently normalized.
He was anticoagulated with warfarin for thromboembolic prophylaxis with a goal INR of [**1-26**].
CLL: The patient's WBC count trended down from its baseline level (20-30K) when the patient developed bacteremia (see above).
Medications on Admission: Medications at time of transfer -Vanco 1 gram q12 -Zosyn 4.5 IV q8 -metoprolol 100 PO TID -atrovent -ambien -tylenol -senna -docusate -MVI -nystatin -diltiazem 30 QID -albuterol q2h PRN -tiotropium daily -aspirin 81mg daily -warfarin 4mg daily  Discharge Medications: 1.
Levalbuterol HCl 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) Nebulizer treatment Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for wheezing/SOB.
Your bleeding stopped, and your blood count was subsequently stable.
We made the following changes to your medicines: - Started AMPICILLIN to treat your blood infection.
