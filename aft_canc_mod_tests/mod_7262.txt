On admission, UA was grossly positive however urine culture returned with no growth.
A blood culture from admission grew pseudomonas, sensitive to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin (not [**Last Name (un) 2830**] or cefepime), and so antibiotics were switched to ceftazidime.
Daily blood cultures from the PICC were obtained and remained negative.
Urine lytes initially suggested kidneys were able to concentrate urine, however IVF resuscitation did not improve urine output.
Urine was spun and muddy brown casts were seen, suggestive of ATN.
Urine eos were negative.
At the time of transfer from the ICU, he was in atrial fibrillation with blood pressures in the 80s but per discussion with the family (see below) no further medications were administered as this was not in keeping with his goals of care.
