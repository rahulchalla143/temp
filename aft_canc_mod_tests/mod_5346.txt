On the floor, he was noted to have a serum bicarb of 45 and was somnolent.
An ABG was done which was 7.23/112/144.
CXR from 1 am showed increased left pneumothorax.

Imaging CT Head [**2188-6-30**] - FINDINGS: No hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally midline structures or evidence of major territorial infarction is apparent.
[**2189-6-30**] - UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
CHEST CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST [**2189-7-2**]: TECHNIQUE: MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images through the chest without administration of IV contrast.
Standard and lung algorithm images as well as coronal reformats were obtained.
This study was compared with chest radiograph of [**7-2**], [**7-1**], and [**2189-6-30**].
A small, layering, nonhemorrhagic, right pleural effusion is also present.
This study was not designed to examine the abdomen, however, no mass lesions are seen in the imaged portion of the liver, spleen, adrenals, kidneys, or pancreas.
Pleural fluid cytology: neg for malignant cells  EMG [**2189-7-3**]: FINDINGS: Motor nerve conduction study (NCSs) of the left median nerve were normal, including F waves.
Concentric needle electromyography (EMG) of the left vastus lateralis showed motor unit potentials (MUPs) of mildly short duration, small amplitude and increased polyphasia with early recruitment.
EMG examination of the tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius was normal.
EMG of right vastus lateralis showed MUPs of mildly short duration, small amplitude and increased polyphasia with early recruitment.
EMG examination of the left deltoid, biceps, and first dorsal interosseous was normal.
EMG examination of the right deltoid showed a mixed population of normal MUPs and MUPs of mildly short duration, small amplitude and increased polyphasia with early recruitment.
The study was prematurely terminated due to the patient's increasing respiratory distress.
There is no definite electrophysiologic evidence for a disorder of neuromuscular transmission, but the limited nature of the study precludes exclusion of this diagnostic possibility.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Though pt has no established history of lung disease, suspect that his hypercarbia has been a chronic issue.
His pco2 of 112 caused pH of only 7.29, and serum bicarb of 45, suggesting chronic process.
An EMG was performed which which showed mild, generalized myopathic process without denervating features; however, the study was limited.
CT chest was performed, which showed persistent hydro-pneumothorax as well as non-specific ground-glass opacities & tree & [**Male First Name (un) 239**] structures.
An A-line was placed.
