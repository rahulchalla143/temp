MRI revealed tumor progression.
CT imaging confirmed ventriculomegally, and the patient presented for evaluation of hydrocephalus.

Evaluation for recurrent disease is limited on this noncontrast exam and correlation with MRI is advised to further assess.
Chest X-ray [**3-7**]: CLINICAL HISTORY: 44-year-old woman with altered mental status, on chemotherapy for brain mass.
MRI Head [**3-7**]: COMPARISON: Comparison is made to MR of the head from [**11-15**], [**2124**], [**2126-2-18**] and a CT of the head from [**2126-3-7**].
Following administration of intravenous gadolinium contrast, axial T1, sagittal and coronal T1-weighted images were all obtained through the brain.
New from previous examinations is nodular diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, concerning for spread of neoplasm on the leptomeninges.
Post-contrast images were also notable for area of solid tumor enhancement, similar to that seen on examination from [**2125-12-18**], including the left temporal lobe and left insula.
Unchanged from the most recent CT exam is a thin rim of extra-axial fluid along the left cerebral hemispheres.
Head Ct [**3-8**]: IMPRESSION: Status post placement of ventricular catheter.
Serial head CTs revealed no evidence of ventricular dilatation or ICH.
