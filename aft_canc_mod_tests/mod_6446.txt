Patient had a PET scan in [**8-20**] that was normal except a low attenuation lesion in R parietal lobe.
Outpatient brain MRI on [**2100-9-17**] showed 1.2 cm right parietal mass with extensive edema c/w sole metastasis.
Her recent admission from [**Date range (1) 87323**] is notable for being continued on decadron and phenytoin.
Her temperature was 100.1 this AM.
Exam notable for dry MM, L facial droop, LUE 2-3/5, LLE 0/5, R-full strength, A&Ox3 (similar to discharge exam).
Labs notable for WBC 22.8, positive U/A, and lactate 1.5.
CT head performed which was in general similar to [**9-27**] images - slight decrease in pneumocephalus, no new hemorrhage, post-surgical changes in the right parietal lobe with decreased hyperdense component (blood products), edema overall stable.
CVL was placed in the ED for SBP in the 80s which rose to SBP in 90s with IVF.
