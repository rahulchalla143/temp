Patient was transfused with improvement in her Hct as above.
Her coumadin was held and her anticoagulation was reversed.
Colonoscopy showed a polyp that was sent for biopsy (found to be hyperplastic polyp).
No evidence of bleeding seen on EGD or colonoscopy.
On discharge, blood pressure slightly elevated, so patient instructed to restart Diovan.
Hct 32.
This was likely caused by the coumadin which you were taking.
You had an upper endoscopy (EGD) and a colonoscopy.
These tests did not reveal a source for the bleeding.
