Yesterday, he developed different left sided chest pressure that was substernal without relief, he took nyquil and went to bed, and awoke with the continued pain.
Of note, he recently had an echo for lower extremity edema on [**2112-1-7**] which showed preserved EF of 55% and no wall motion abnormality (normal).
Upon arrival to the ED, initial VS: 96.4 88 110/60 16 100% 2L Nasal Cannula.
EKG showed ST elevations in I/AVL and V4-V5 with ST depressions in the inferior leads.
During the procedure he had some hypotension and a HCT was drawn showing a crit of 19.9 from 26.7 prior to cath.
He complained of [**3-11**] chest pressure that had decreased from [**11-9**] previously.
He had one episode of melena during his last admission that resolved, with a HCT of 40 at discharge.

Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated severe single-vessel CAD.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left-sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 31mmHg.
Systemic arterial pressures were low-normal with a measured central aortic pressure of 99/54/64.
[**2112-1-31**] Echocardiogram Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function and regional wall motion abnormalities consistent with coronary artery disease involving a proximal lesion in a likely wrap-around left anterior descending coronary artery.
Compared to the previous study of [**2112-1-7**] (images reviewed), the regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and depression in left ventricular systolic ejection fraction are new.
[**2112-1-31**] CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis without Contrast 1.
Global decrease in blood density, suggestive of chronic anemia.
[**2112-2-1**] CXR 1.
Limited assessment of superior mediastinum due to lordotic positioning.
TTE showed EF 35% with depressed left ventricular systolic function.
Baseline HCT 40 most recently in [**2111-12-1**] after his myotomy.
One episode of melena after his surgery, however his HCT was stable and there were no further episodes of melena or BRBPR.
CT chest/ abdomen/ pelvis showed no evidence of RT bleed and his hematocrits remained stable despite starting heparin.
# CHF: no hx of CHF, last ECHO [**2112-1-7**] with preserved EF of 55% and no wall motion abnormalities.
TTE showed new depressed left ventricular EF, LVEDP high at end of cath suggestive of poor forward flow.
We monitored his fluid status and diuresed him gently given risk of GI bleed.
However, his ventricular ectopy improved over his hospitalization.

These medications have antiplatelet effects, which helps to prevent blood clots from forming inside your stents.
You will need your cholesterol and liver function tests repeated in 6 weeks.
It will lower your heart rate and blood pressure as well.
Your blood counts are stable at this time.
We changed your omeprazole (prilosec) to pantoprazole because it does not interfere with the clopidogrel.
The [**Hospital 197**] clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] will manage your Coumadin dosing and blood draws.
