In the ED, initial vs were: T 97 HR 100 BP 88/46 O2 98% ra.
She received 4L of IVF with good blood pressure response.
Her labs demonstrated leukocytosis, transaminitis, stable hematocrit.
CXR did not show an effusion or consolidation.
CTA ruled out PE, and CT abdomen/pelvis did not demonstrate an acute process.
Blood cultures were drawn.
Father: metothelioma - 75 first in his testes.

Chest Radiograph [**2166-7-5**]: IMPRESSION: Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis with CT angiogram of chest: IMPRESSION: 1.
Known hypoenhancing pancreatic head mass compatible with adenocarcinoma incompletely assessed in this single-phase study, but grossly similar to the CTA abdomen study one month ago.
Pelvic ultrasound can be performed if clinically indicated.
1) Cholangitis c/b gram negative bacteremia:  The patient presented with abdominal pain and an elevated bilirubin with no other obvious source of infection and discovery of displaced stent and pururlent material from her biliary tree.
She was treated initially with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin that was narrowed to just piperacillin-tazobactam once blood cultures returned with gram negative rod bacteremia.
She had replacement of her stent on [**7-6**] with rapid improvement in her bilirubin and resolution of most of her pain.
Surveillance cultures remain negative and on the day of discharge she was transitioned to PO ciprofloxacin with plans to complete a total of 14 days of antibiotics with day 1 being [**7-7**] (the day after stent replacement).
Of note, the patient did have a significant leukocytosis that remained after her procedure but given her overall improvement and the disappearance of bands this was thought likely due to leukemoid reaction.
3) Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Pt desatted in the ED but rapidly improved and CT chest without PE or pulmonary process.
4) Atypical chest pain: The patient presented with atypical chest pain but had unchanged, normal ECG and normal cardiac enzymes *2.
9) Code Status: Code Status was DNR/DNI  Transitional Issues: -The patient will follow-up with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-3**] days to recheck WBC count and see how she is doing -The patient has follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] in surgery -The patient will follow up with oncology on the [**Hospital3 **] -The patient will cancel previous appointment with ERCP given this was for follow up from temporary stent with possible replacement as stent was replaced during this procedure   Medications on Admission: Levothyroxine 125 mcg Tablet PO QD Lithium carbonate 300 mg PO QHS Diovan HCT 80mg-12.5mg qd Humulin 24 u qAM, 32 qPM Dorzol/timolol 2-0.05%OP PID Lumigan Calcium carbonate-Vitamin D3 600 Ca-400U D   Discharge Medications: 1. levothyroxine 125 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
