Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], she was "awake and nodding" but was intubated prior to CT for airway protection in the ED.

Pertinent Results: Microbiology: all blood cx's: negative for growth urine cx: [**9-4**] - pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 36**] to cipro and zosyn.
sputum cx: mssa and proteus mirabilis [**Last Name (un) 36**] to ceftriaxone c. diff: negative ([**9-5**])  EKG: Normal sinus rhythm with atrial premature complexes.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
MRI/MRA: MRI IMPRESSION: 1.
MRA IMPRESSION: 1.
Non-visualization of the distal vertebral and proximal two-third of the basilar artery could be due to occlusion or slow flow from high-grade stenosis.
Carotid U/S: FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
Head CT: IMPRESSION: 1.
This was discussed with the ordering physician by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21881**] when the study was obtained.
CXR: ([**8-31**]) IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe consolidation with small pleural effusion is very worrisome for aspiration, a component of atelectasis/collapse is suspected.. could be due to a mucous plug.
CXR taken on [**9-1**] and [**9-2**] remained unchanged.
Labs: CBC - Hct 48 on admission, nadirs to low 20s on [**8-29**] and [**Date range (1) 8967**] requiring blood transfusions.
WBC peak to 16.0 on [**8-31**], which decreased to 8s with initiation of antibiotics on [**9-2**] and was 7.7 on discharge.

Lactate: 2.0 (0n admission)   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 78 yo F w/ HTN, HLD found down at [**Hospital3 **] facility w/ L hemiparesis, found to have R basal ganglia infarct, likely 2' to uncontrolled HTN.
EEG was done to rule out non-convulsive status given her encephalopathy but only confirmed moderate/severe diffuse encephalopathy without evidence of focality or epilieptic activity.
She required 3 units of PRBC transfusion while in ED for anemia with hct as low as 10.9 at nadir.
She had repeat head imaging when her somnolence increased to rule out hemorrhage which showed no change since admission and her somnolence decreased with transfusion supporting metabolic etiology behind her encephalopathy.
Additionally, patient had elevated troponin (crested at 0.26) without signs of renal failure plus non ST-elevated EKG changes not previously seen likely supporting NSTEMI.
She was treated with ipratroprium and albuterol nebs, guafenesin as mucolytic, chest PT, and kept on aspiration precautions.
Her stroke work-up included a TTE w/o ASD, thrombus, or focal wall motion abnormality, a carotid U/S shwoing <40% narrowing of ICAs.
Lipid panel c/w hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia.
Received 3 U PRBCs during the course of her neuro ICU stay.
She had a hematocrit drop to low 20s (baseline is ~26).
Transfused 2 U PRBCs on [**9-4**] with increase in Hct to 30.
Her Hct was stable in the low to mid 30s on discharge.
She should be referred to GI by her PCP for an upper endoscopy as an outpatient after discharge/rehab.
Surveillence blood cultures negative.
Urine osms not overly concentrated, unlikely SIADH.
Vit A, C, and ZnSO4 for wound healing (should get 5 more days of ZnSO4 at rehabilitation, then med should be discontinued.)
#Hyperglycemia: Pt was kept on HISS for tight blood sugar control in setting of improved wound healing.
-repleted electrolytes aggressively to prevent refeeding syndrome -free H20 boluses (250 q12H).
