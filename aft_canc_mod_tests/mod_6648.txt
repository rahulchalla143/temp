Patient had a head CT performed at [**Hospital 40796**] which was reported as showing right temporal and parietal edema and small foci of hemorrhage, though the images were not sent with the patient upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
While at [**Hospital3 **], the patient had several abdominal films as well as an upper GI series which were reportedly unremarkable.
There was no improvement in his mental status following that intervention and he was intubated for ariway protection and head CT was then performed with results as above.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: *extremely limited due to intubated and sedated status of patient*  Past Medical History: 1) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Stage IVB with CNS involvement: - hospitalization from [**2144-7-11**] - [**2144-11-12**] - oringinally had Bell's Palsy, urinary retention, and LE weakness; transferred to [**Hospital1 **] with labs suggestive of tumor lysis syndrome - bone marrow biopsy demonstrated Burkitt-like high grade lymphoma - imaging showed lymphangitic spread to lung, stomach, ureters - severe scrotal swelling felt to be due to tumor involvement - LP demonstrated malignant cells.
Vincristine was stopped due to concern that it might be causing severe polyneuropathy - treatment complicated by mucositis and pancytopenia requiring neupogen - now in remission 2) Pituitary Macroadenoma 3) Acromegaly 4) h/o Respiratory Failure with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation [**2144-7-12**] to [**2144-7-30**] -- did well with PSV, had large TV (700-800) and MV (>10) 5) h/o Mycoplasma hominis PNA treated with cipro and doxy 6) Sinus Tachycardia with PVCs -- had significant work-up with TSH, TTE.

Limited study due to patient motion despite five repeat attempts.
Pituitary adenoma, not significantly changed since the prior examination when accounting for differences in technique, although dedicated imaging of the sella was not obtained today.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-8-13**], the LVEF is less vigorous.
[**12-27**] Chest Xray The endotracheal tube is no longer visualized.
On admission here, an LP was done that showed a high opening pressure (49) and multiple atypical cells concerning for recurrent CNS lymphoma.
