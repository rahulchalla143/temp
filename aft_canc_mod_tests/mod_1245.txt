No ptosis is noted, and on fundoscopic exam discs were hard to visualize.
Sensation was intact to light touch over face with no ext to DSS.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-11-12**] loss of R waves in lead aVF is new.
MRI with contrast [**1-4**] FINDINGS: Again seen are numerous intraparenchymal enhancing masses with associated hemorrhage.
The intraparenchymal lesions are new since that time, but appeared stable since the study of [**2111-1-3**].
1st CT [**1-3**]: FINDINGS: Again seen is a calcified meningioma measuring approximately 2.2 cm near the vertex in the right frontal region.
2nd CT brain [**1-3**]: There has been no change in the appearance of innumerable bilateral hemorrhagic lesions, likely hemorrhagic metastases.
CT TORSO: FINDINGS: Images of the lower thorax again demonstrate nodular thickening of the left pleura which is slightly increased since the prior exam of [**2110-10-16**].
The size of this collection has not significantly changed since an MRI from [**2110-11-14**].
Again noted is a 2.2 x 2.7 cm nodule in the right adrenal gland which was seen on the recent MRI at which time it likely represented an adenoma.
A nodule is present in the right hemipelvis measuring 2.8 x 2.3 cm best seen on series 2, image 62.
No dense material present within the abdomen on the current examination to suggest hemorrhage.
The pericardium is slightly thickened on the current exam as well but not significantly changed since the prior exam.
It was seen on a more remote exam from [**2108-2-3**].
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo woman with dm, htn, past malignancies including RCC and thyroid ca, and recent w/u with negative path for malignancy but concerning bone scan, mult known pulm nodules, adrenal nodule, who p/w right weak hand and left facial droop, multiple areas of hemorrhage on ct with no substantial edema or effacement of the grey-white jxn, no midline shift, vents open.
Initial exam showed left facial droop and right arm weakness; however, several hours after being in the ED, (hours after being given 10 mg IV decadron and 1.5g IV dilantin) she became unresponsive.
She was intubated and a stat head CT was repeated after acute change in MS, showing no change.
Acute change in MS, given no change on CT could have been sz.
BP was monitored with goal 120-150.
Neurosurg was consuted for workup of ?brain mets.
MRI showed lesions to be enhancing.
WBC was initially elevated with negative UA (except RBC's), CXR with no change.
[**1-5**]: Onc thinks lung>brain ca, [**Last Name (un) **].
Pulm will touch base with CT [**Doctor First Name **] ?look at lung bx option; tw neurosurg again- really not good bx options, is stereotactic brain (ie, frontal lobe lesion) feasible?
CT neck/chest today with increased pleural thickening and nodularity.
Foley replaced [**2-26**] PVR 400 and polyuria.
Percutaneous biopsy of pleura performed without complication.
Patient's NPH and metoprolol increased for improved blood sugar and blood pressure control.
Cardiac enzymes not sent.
[**1-12**]:  AFVSS with SBP 170 transiently.
FSG 383.
Allergies: IV CT contrast->rash  Discharge Medications: 1.
