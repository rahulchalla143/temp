She initially had a gap which closed.
Her gap closed and her FS trend was 600-> 255 -> 230.
Her ABG showed 7.49 pCO2 33 pO2 101 HCO3 26 BaseXS 2.
Her lactate was 7.1->5.4-> 3.8-> 3.4.
In the ED she was not encephalopathic, belly soft, CXR unremarkable, urine with small leuks/blood/nitrite nge/wbc>50/mod bacteria.
Her chest pain had resolved and her EKG was unchanged from prior.
On further questioning she denied diarrhea, epigastric pain, increased frequency of urination, pain with urination, hematuria, changes in vision, headache, increased SOB on exertion (baseline for last few months SOB after 1 flight of stairs), PND, orthopnea, CP prior to today, jaw pain, arm pain.

Microbiology: [**5-3**] urinalysis - positive, no urine culture sent [**5-4**] urinalysis positive, urine culture > 100K e coli Urine culture [**5-4**]:     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2140-5-6**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
[**5-3**] blood culture - e coli [**5-4**], [**5-5**], [**5-6**], [**5-7**] blood cultures - no growth to date .
Blood culture [**5-3**]:                       **FINAL REPORT [**2140-5-7**]**     Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2140-5-7**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Imaging: [**5-3**] Chest x-ray: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process .
[**5-4**] Chest x-ray: Mild vascular engorgement is new, though heart size is normal and edema if any is limited to a peribronchial cuffing.
[**5-5**] Chest x-ray: There are lower lung volumes but no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is seen with minimal atelectatic change.
COMPARISON: Pelvic ultrasound [**2140-3-2**].
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained and reviewed.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST AND RECONSTRUCTIONS: The thyroid gland is grossly within normal limits.
No filling defects identified within the pulmonary arteries, however, this study was not optimized to evaluate this finding.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST AND RECONSTRUCTIONS: Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
The abdominal aorta and iliac branches demonstrate moderate calcified atherosclerotic plaque without aneurysmal dilatation.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST AND RECONSTRUCTIONS: A 4.5 x 3.8 cm presumed exophytic fibroid is demonstrated within the left adnexa as depicted on pelvic ultrasound from [**2140-3-2**].
A focus of calcification is again demonstrated abutting the endometrium on the sagittal projection, also correlated on prior pelvic ultrasound.
Sepsis due to E Coli UTI/E Coli bacteremia/pyelonephritis: Patient presented with fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, positive urinalysis, urine culture with e coli, with subsequent blood cultures growing gram negative rods, consistent with urosepsis.
When urine and blood cultures grew out pan sensitive e coli, vancomycin was discontinued and she was maintained on levofloxacin alone.
Therefore a CT abdomen was obtained that demonstrated bilateral pyelonephritis, no discreet fluid collection.
Surveillance blood cultures were with no growth to date at time of discharge and she was discharged to complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin.
The pt was asked to check her fingersticks at varying times of day and to bring in these recordings with her to her follow up appointment with her PCP.
# Shortness of breath:  Patient noted some episodes of shortness of breath, initially had some wheezing on exam, chest x-ray with some evidence of mild volume overload.
Given continued symptoms, obtained a CT torso to rule out pulmonary embolism that was negative for any clot.
On [**5-5**] Creatinine started to trend up again to 1.5 on [**5-9**].
CT of the abdomen had shown no hydronephrosis, but +pyelonephritis.
Pts ARF was felt to be most likely due to pyelonephritis vs mild ATN from CT dye.
# R adnexal 2.1 cm lesion: Incidentally noted on CT scan--fluid attenuating lesion which may be a adnexal cyst.
Both were resumed once BP normalized, but HCTZ was again held in the setting of worsening renal function.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
You will need to check your fingersticks several times a day (twice a day at least---try to record some fasting morning fingersticks, some evening fingersticks, and some in the mid-afternoon when your sugars tend to run high (ie 3 PM).
