He was found to have early tamponade physiology on echocardiogram report from [**Hospital6 1129**] [**2153-9-12**] where echo revealed LV ejection fraction of 76% and a moderate to  large circumferential pericardial effusion with fibrin deposition  and impaired RV filling consistent with early tamponade physiology in setting of estimated PASP 36 mmHg.

Pericardial Fluid [**2153-10-3**]: GRAM STAIN (Final [**2153-10-3**]):       1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
Pericardial Fluid Cytology: Wetread - Malignant cells .
Pericardial Fluid Cell Block: Pending .
ECG [**10-2**]: Atrial fibrillation.
ECHO [**10-2**]: The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-9-12**], the pericardial effusion is now larger.
CXR Portable [**10-2**]: IMPRESSION: Opacification of the right middle lobe which may represent atelectasis versus possible pneumonia.
ABD XR [**10-2**]: FINDINGS: AP and left lateral decubitus radiographs of the abdomen were provided.
The previously seen right middle lobe opacity on the recent prior chest radiograph has resolved suggesting that this was due to atelectasis.
Duplex Doppler Abd/Pelv [**10-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Abdominal MRI is recommended for further evaluation.
Pericardial effusion with echo evidence of tamponade 2.
ECHO [**10-3**]: FOCUSED STUDY, POST-PERICARDIOCENTESIS: Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-10-2**], the pericardial effusion is smaller.
ECHO [**10-5**]: .
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-10-3**], the findings are similar.
CXR PA/LAT [**10-5**]: .
Correlation with prior reference CT is made.
Pericardial fluid cytology demonstrated malignant cells.
#Probable lung cancer: Review of chest CT from [**Hospital1 2025**] showed large bronchogenic lesion causing complete collapse of the right middle lobe as well as multiple hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes.
This may be readdressed after the fianl results of his pericardial fluid are known.
He also decline PT evaluation and visiting home nursing.
An abdominal US showed liver lesions likely metastases in this context.
#Probable Stage IV Lung Ca: Based on the CT chest findings from [**Hospital1 2025**] and the positive preliminary cytology for malignant cells, he likely has Stage IV lung cancer.
During this hospitalization, Mr. [**Known lastname 105142**] was not amenable to further staging workup including brain imaging, bronchoscopy for biospies, or further body imaging.
