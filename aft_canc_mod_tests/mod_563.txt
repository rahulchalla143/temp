Pertinent Results: 7.8/ 26.2/ 137 Previous CBC: 6.7/29.2/137 140/4.1/104/26/22/1.1/139 Ca: 8.5 Mg: 1.9 P: 3.3 INR 2.5 .
[**2148-11-30**] Head CT no ICH or mass .
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2148-12-3**] 10:49 AM CONCLUSION 1.
ECHO [**2148-12-2**] There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is probably borderline normal (EF~50-55%) but views are technically suboptimal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Repeat ECHO showed preserved EF 50-55%, tight AS valve area 0.6 cm2.
Baseline ECG reveals bifasicular block with prolonged PR.
Continued advair, ipratropium and albuterol NEB PRN.
Bleeds stopped with pressure bandages, FFP and vit K. Abdominal CT showed right groin bleed and no RP/intrapelvic bleed.
Hct now stable and patient off coumadin.
## [**Name (NI) 14572**] - Pt with h/o dvt (dx'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**2148-6-12**]) and anticogulated with coumadin on admission, INR was 2.5.
Please get your labs drawn on and have the your primary care physician [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] the results.
