EKG [**2129-6-22**]:  Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2129-5-20**] the ST-T wave changes are slightly more prominent in the precordial leads.
EKG [**2129-6-23**]:  Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2129-6-22**] no diagnostic interim change.
TTE [**2129-6-23**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
