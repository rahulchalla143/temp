They ordered labs on him which were concerning for a K of 7.0 and a Cr of 5.5(baseline 1.2 on [**2176-3-12**]).
EKG done without peaked T-waves.
He was then transferred to the floor when his repeat labs showed his K was down to 5.9.

- [**2175-12-15**], MRI of the thigh showing a lesion in the vastus intermedius measuring 5.2 x 2.7 x 2.2 cm, and a vastus medialis lesion measuring 4.3 x 2.6 x 2.2 cm.
- [**2175-12-21**], core needle biopsy of thigh mass demonstrating poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with known metastatic  bladder cancer.
- [**2176-1-5**]: CT torso and chest angio showing bilateral pulmonary  emboli in RML, RLL, LLL, disease progression with increased lymphadenopathy.
- [**2176-1-6**], Cycle 5, day 1 of carboplatin AUC 4 on day 1 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on day 1 and day 11.
- [**2176-1-17**]:  CT abdomen and pelvis showing no intra-abdominal or pelvic hematoma.
- [**2176-2-1**]:  Cycle 7, day 1 (C7 overall, but second cycle of overall therapy since restarting chemo) of cisplatin 70 mg/m2 on day 1 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on day 1.
- [**2176-2-11**] CT angio of the chest: no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
- [**2176-2-19**] CT torso: No axillary or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
- [**Date range (1) 8301**]/11: palliative radiation to right thigh, total 2000cGy in 5 fractions - [**2176-3-12**]: cycle 1 day 1 pemetrexed 500mg/m2 .

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 12279**] is a 46 yo male with metastatic bladder cancer with disease progression on chemo who went to a urology clinic appt [**3-20**] for suprapubic discomfort, had a foley catheter placed with minimal urine output and was found to have hyperkalemia and [**Last Name (un) **] in the setting of neutropenia.
On CT he has bilateral hydronephrosis which is the likely source of his [**Last Name (un) **].
On [**2176-3-21**] he had bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes placed with good urine output after the procedure.
Potassium, magnesium and phosphorus were all very elevated, HCT and sodium decreased.
His initial EKG showed peaked t-waves.
He was writted for an aggressive bowel regimen, and CT showed partial SBO.
After discussion with Oncology (given his neutropenia) it was felt the benefits outweighed the risks for using a suppository in an attempt to make him have a bowel movement, so he was given one still with no effect.
Last chemotherapy was [**3-12**], given permetrexed x1, plan was for repeat dosing every 21 days.
His HCT was stable during his stay in the ICU in the 22-24 range.
# Hx of DVT/PE's: Left DVT and bilateral PE's in [**12-28**].
