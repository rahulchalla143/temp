Discharge labs:  - ECG: Sinus tahcycardia to 125, NA, NI, ?LVH [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 19300**] criteria, no t wave changes or ST segment changes concerning for ischemia .
- ECHO OSH: EF 20-25%, with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild AR, severe aortic stenosis.
- CT from OSH [**2131-12-17**]:  CT CHEST: There are no filling defects in the pulmonary vasculature to suggest pulmonary embolism.
CT ABDOMEN: There is diffuse mesenteric fat stranding with trace fluid, as well as severe gallbladder wall edema.
CT PELVIS: The prostate appears to be near the upper limit of normal size.
CT BONES: The bones are diffusely mottled with apparent diffuse sclerotic infiltration.
ECHO [**2131-12-19**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with regional variation (contractile function of the basal inferior and posterior walls appears relatively preserved).
# Systolic CHF with critical AS, concern for cardiogenic shock: The patient was found to have EF 20-25% with severe AS at OSH which is confirmed on echo here with additional findings of smokey appearance of LV cavity (prelim read) concerning for possible developing thrombus.
BNP ~10,000, trops negative x 3.
The patient's heart failure was medically optimized, and he was started on metoprolol and lisinopril.
A carotid series was done, and the patient was also seen by dental.
CT from OSH shows evidence of pneumonia and he was started on Ceftriaxone/Azithro at BIDN.
CT from OSH shows evidence of pneumonia and he was started on Ceftriaxone/Azithro at BIDN  The patient did not have a clear infiltrate on his CXR here.
Of note, the patien initially had a lactate of 3.7 and anion gap of 16 on admission, that soon trended down.
All blood and urine cultures were negative.
Urine legionella negative.
# ?Prostate cancer/Malignancy work-up:  The patient was found to have PSA ~500s, with evidence of bony lesions on OSH imaging; CEA 2.2, CA19.9 <3, and alk phos of 1500 at OSH, also with hilar adenopathy on CT chest.
Retic of 2.9, corrected of 1.3.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute systolic congestive heart failure: EF 20-25% Severe aortic stenosis, bicuspid valve Community Acquired Pneumonia Likely prostate cancer with metastatic bone disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
