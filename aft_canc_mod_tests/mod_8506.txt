His initial vitals in the ED were T 99, HR 113, BP 87/72, RR 35, oxygen saturation 97% on NRB.
In the ED, labs were notable for hematocrit of 54, up from baseline in the mid to high 20s.
White count was 27, with 85% polys and 1% bands.
Other labs showed a creatinine of 3.7, up from baseline 1.5-1.7, BUN of 105, and sodium of 174.
Troponin was 0.48.
He had an electrocardiogram that showed non-specific st-changes in V2-V6.
A urinalysis showed many bacteria, negative leuk esterase and negative nitrite.
A chest x-ray showed multiple areas of patchy opacities consistent with possible aspiration pneumonia.
Vitals at time of admission were HR 83, BP 124/46, RR 24, satting 97% on non-rebreather.
While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] a PICC line was placed, his sodium slowly trended down to 166 and his IVF was slowed to 100 cc/hour.
Vanc level 13.7 thus gave another dose tonight with the plan to check an AM trough.
His O2 sat improved to 92% on 2L thus his presentation was thought to be most consistent with an aspiration pneumonitis.

CXR [**2122-1-19**]: In comparison with study of [**1-15**], the patient has taken a poor inspiration.
CXR [**2122-1-15**]: The tip of the right subclavian PICC line extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
It is difficult to determine whether there may still be slight coiling distally  HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2122-1-16**]: No evidence for acute intracranial process.
His end stage dementia is severe, and the irreversibility and severity was discussed at legnth with the patient's son [**Name (NI) **].
Palliative care was involved and a plan was made to give the patient some time from his acute illness to evaluate for any recovery.
