A drain is in the upper abdomen.
Her NG tube was pulled on [**2111-3-30**] and she had an upper GI study which showed no leak.
Diabetes:  Her sugars were controlled with sliding scale insulin, and the doses of long-acting insulin were increased as her tube feeds were advanced and as her diet was advanced.
Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit was intermittently monitored, reaching a low of 20.5 on [**2111-3-29**].
Effort was made to minimize the frequency of blood draws.
