Given the pt's positive blood cultures at the OSH, there was concern for an intra-abdominal infectious etiology for the pt's peritonitis.
Pt was subsequently taken to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy where it was revealed that the pt had a splenic abscess that had ruptured.
On post-op day 1, pt was able to be weaned off pressors and urine output did improve.
Pt remained in the SICU for further monitoring of his respiratory status and was transferred to the floor on post-op day 5.
On POD # 13, the patient was found less responsive, with gibberish speech, and able participate in limited neurological exam only.
The patient underwent head CT, which was grossly normal.

Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.
GU: The patient's urine output was closely monitored in the immediate post-operative period.
Surveillance blood and urine cultures were negative.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched.
Blood glucose levels greater than 120 mg/dL were addressed with an insulin sliding scale.
Postop complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required.
