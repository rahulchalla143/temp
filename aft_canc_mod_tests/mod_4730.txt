Past Medical History: - metastatic lung cancer (pt not a smoker) ** See onc note form [**2141-11-7**] for entire oncology hx - benign sigmoid polyps - Hernia repair on [**2141-5-19**].
metastatic lung cancer (pt not a smoker)-history below --[**6-1**] CXR that revealed a 4 x 4 cm right middle lobe nodule.
---[**7-1**] CT scan revealed a 4.5 x 4.8 cm right perihilar mass as  well as numerous confluent right upper lobe nodules and subcarinal lymphadenopathy.
--[**7-1**] needle core biopsy of the right lung mass, which revealed  adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, consistent with non-mucinous bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
--[**12-3**] He subsequently underwent radiation up to 20 Gy at [**Hospital 88830**] Infirmary and has done well with good control of the  lesion per outside hospital reports.
--[**2-/2141**] CT scan revealed persistent right perihilar lung mass measuring 4.1 cm, multiple nodules in a right perihilar distribution GGO RML, 8 mm nodule in the right hepatic lobe, a 1.5 cm nodule immediately adjacent in the right hepatic lobe in a  subcapsular location, as well as a stable hepatic cyst, suspicious lymph node in the region of the gastrohepatic ligament  measuring 9 mm in short axis.
CT scan revealed abnormal increased density in the inferior right hilum with a small right pleural effusion, a round area of decreased attenuation in the right lobe of the liver, which had the appearance of a cyst, and three rounded areas of decreased attenuation in the right lobe of the liver, which appeared to have increased in size when compared to the CAT scan done on [**2141-3-8**].
Pathology revealed a metastatic well-to-moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the hernia sac and contents with  strong positivity for CK-7 and TTF-1 and negative for CK-20.
---[**2141-5-29**] ultrasounded-guided core biopsy of the liver revealed a metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with a lung primary of a bronchoalveolar type.
--[**2141-8-8**]: started 5 cycles of carboplatin/alimta --[**2141-9-21**]: CT torso: Interval improvement in the size of the right lung nodules; perihilar mass 2.1 x 1.8 cm previously 4.2 x  3.4.
--[**2141-11-7**] started alimta maintenance --[**2142-1-19**] CT torso: Interval worsening hepatic metastatic lesions with increase in size and number of the metastatic deposits.
--[**2142-5-8**] started gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2.

Chest CT: 1.
Head CT [**6-24**]: 1.
Limited evaluation for hemorrhage given recent IV contrast bolus through prior study.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There are two tiny cortical foci, one left frontal, one right parietal (series 2 image 22 and series 2 image 23), that are hyperdense and appear cortical.
These findings would be best pursued with an MR examination including contrast.
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**6-23**] and [**6-24**]:  [**2142-6-24**] CXR Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved, most evident in the left lung.
This is confirmed in the right upper lobe on the chest CTA performed nearly concurrently.
The small lung nodules seen on that study are barely visible on this conventional bedside radiograph.
