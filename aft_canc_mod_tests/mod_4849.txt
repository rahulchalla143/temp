He notes that as the steroids were tapered his symptoms worsened and he required home O2 all day.
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was diagnosed with COPD in [**2152-3-13**] when he was hospitalized for several weeks for increasing shortness of breath and a CT scan revealed pulmonary edema, pulmonary nodules, and severe emphysema.
On [**5-31**] he had a sleep study and was started on BiPAP (settings 16/6).
On [**2152-6-16**], the day he developed his myalgias, he had f/u CT scan for his pulmonary nodules that showed extensive centrilobular emphysema, resolution of all but one pulmonary nodules, and some ground-glass opacities at the lung bases, that could represent inflammatory process or recurrent aspiration.
Presention to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED today revealed initial vs: T 100.0 P 80  BP 147/88  R 22 O2 91% NRB.
Breath sounds were decreased bilaterally.
A CXR showed bilateral Lower Lobe PNA.
He was initially placed on BiPAP for presumed COPD flare, with variable effect, then placed on a nonrebreather and his saturations remained at 96%.
WBC was elevated at 18.
Upon arrival to the MICU vs were: HR 110  169/88   RR 21   Sat 87% on 8 L nonrebreather.
ROS was negative for diarrhea, constipaiton, rash, anorexia, dysuria, chest pain, nausea, vomiting.
Physical Exam: Vitals - temp 99.4F, HR 121,118/79, 21, 97% on RA.

Images of the upper abdomen demonstrate a normal-appearing liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal diffuse ground-glass and nodular opacities noted predominantly within the bilateral lower lobes and the right middle lobe which have developed since prior CT of [**2152-6-16**].
Echo [**2152-6-26**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
CT scan showed Multifocal diffuse ground-glass and nodular opacities noted predominantly within the bilateral lower lobes and the right middle lobe which had developed since his prior CT one week earlier ([**2152-6-16**]).
He eventually required 100% FiO2 and high amounts of PEEP (24) and PIP (34).
Mechanical ventilation was unable to be weaned secondary to persistent profound hypoxia.
Cultres were obtained including sputum, BAL, blood, and urine but did not grow any microorganisms.
Due to monocytosis on CBC diff a bone marrow biopsy was obtained to rule out malignancy.
The biopsy revealed dense monocytosis in the bone marrow consistent with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia.
#  AML: As above, a BM biopsy revealed AML.
Tumor lysis labs were followed and he was treated with rasburicase on [**2152-7-2**].
He was found to have granular casts and his urine output decreased.
His creatinine peaked at 6.3.
His blood glucose was elevated and this was thought to have been due to the stress dose steroids or underlying inflammatory process.
