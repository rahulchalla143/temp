Over the course of six months, his white count began to rise and essentially doubled to approximately 130,000 with a rising in his LDH of up to 1400, and he also was noted to have worsening palpable lymphadenopathy.
He did again not have a significant response, though continued to have an excellent performance status, and he was ultimately switched to Campath therapy.
He did have resolution of his lymphocytosis, and his white count has come down nicely, but did not have much in the way of response in terms of reducing his bulky lymphadenopathy.

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ================================================================ [**Date range (3) 60072**] # Allo BMT - Day 0: [**2124-3-10**] from MUD ([**7-27**], mismatch at one HLA-A allele).
The patient was treated empirically for GVHD with steroids, which improved his rash, but when the steroids were tapered the patient developed severe watery diarrhea, up to 2L a day at times.
Biopsies of the sigmoid and rectum were non-diagnostic but consistent with GVHD.
Stool cultures for bacterial and viral pathogens and for C. diff were negative.
Dermatology biopsied the rash, and the pathology was consistent with GVHD.
Derm took a biopsy which showed results consistent with GVHD and unlikely for drug reaction.
Cultures remained negative and no source was identified.
C diff was negative on multiple occasions throughout this hospitalization.
His counts recovered ([**3-22**]) and antibiotics were discontinued.
# VRE bacteremia - The patient developed bloody diarrhea and underwent colonoscopy for evaluation ([**5-18**]).
The colonscopy was negative as was an EGD.
The following evening the patient developed a fever to 102 and blood cultures grew VRE bacteremia.
He had no symptoms and his vital signs remained stable.
# HHV6 infection:  The patient spiked a fever [**3-27**] when he was no longer neutropenic and he developed a splotchy and evanescent rash, which disappeared within 24 hours.
A serum HHV6 viral load was eventually positive, and HHV6 was felt to be the likely cause of the patient?????
Repeat testing a week later for HHV6 was negative.
# Strept Milleri Bacteremia: On [**4-15**] blood cultures were drawn as the patient appeared unwell and had borderline low blood pressures.
Blood cultures eventually grew Strep milleri.
TTE was negative for endocarditis.
The patient was deemed to high risk to undergo TEE so it was determined that he would complete a 4 week course from the first negative blood culture on [**4-18**] (D/C ON [**5-15**]).
Urine bacterial cultures were negative, but urine studies were positive for BK virus.
In addition, the patient was given IVIG on [**5-6**] to help boost his Ig levels in the setting of such high levels of immunosuppression.
Urology recommended an outpatient cystoscopy after discharge for further evaluation of microscopic hematuria.
An MRI was conducted which showed no pathology that would account for the mental status change.
Once his GVHD stabilized, he was diuresed with lasix which at one point caused prerenal acute renal failure with a creatinine peak of 1.7.
MRI shows possible embolic infarcts which raises concern for endocarditis as another possible source of sepsis.
LP was performed and suggestive of possible aseptic meningitis, etiologies include HSV and other viruses (CMV, HHV, number of others sent out) vs malignancy related as 99% lymphs on tap vs drug (chemo/immunosup) toxicity.
BMT/heme thought that the CSF lymphs were not likely malignant.
ID recommended coverage for empiric HSV with foscarnet (due to better coverage of HSV 6).
The pt reported having some loose stools but C. diff was negative and empiric flagyl treatment was d/c'd.
# Anemia: HCT 22 from 26, now stable 23.
He continues to be on cellcept 1500mg [**Hospital1 **], budesonide 3mg tid, and methylprednisolone.
During his most recent episode on [**2124-7-12**], his blood pressure also dropped to 90/60, and he was started on meropenem and daptomycin because of the possibility of sepsis.
The patient's blood pressure improved with boluses and antibiotics.
MRI head was negative, and LP glucose, protein were normal.
CSF was sent from [**6-26**] which also showed evidence of adenovirus.
However, repeat level on [**7-6**] showed decreasing adenovirus levels and cidofivir was not started.
A repeat LP was performed on [**2124-7-14**], HHV-6, CMV, Enterovirus, viral culture, HSV PCR, EBV PCR, [**Male First Name (un) 2326**], Adenovirus pending.
Blood adenovirus level also re-sent.
GVHD: By the beginning of [**Month (only) **], the pt did not have any GVHD associated rash and he was not having any significant amount of diarrhea, however he did have increases in his LFT's and total bilirubin (as below) that were associated with altered mental status, increased somnolence and decreased responsiveness (see below, AMS).
By d/c his LFT's were still increased, with a Tbili holding steady in the 6's.
On discharge, patient was kept on Methylprednisone 25mg AM/20mg PM, Cellcept 750mg every 8 hours and budesonide 3mg TID.
Pt was to get an MRI abdomen but was unable to sit still long enough to get it, therefore was sent for CT abdomen with and without contrast [**2124-7-18**], which showed an interval increase in his ascites, increase in his pleural effusions L>R, and chronic ileal wall thickening c/w GVHD.
Hepatology was consulted and a paracentesis was performed in early [**Month (only) **] that was essentially non-diagnostic, ascites cultures were negative, and the picture was essentially consistent with portal hypertension.
Liver Bx was recommended but was not performed because by this time the pt was clinically improving, waking up, and AMS was resolving.
An LP performed on [**7-14**] was non diagnostic and all viral studies from that procedure were negative.
MRI head [**7-14**] was also non diagnostic.
Neuro was consulted and recommended a 24hr bedside EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizures, however he eventually began to dramatically turn around though and became more awake, was conversational, able to express himself, was requesting food, and EEG was not felt to be necessary.
The pt's Metoprolol was d/c'd and his bp's began to improve from high 90's/low 100's to the 110's.
By the time the pt's mental status improved, his blood pressures and hypothermia were no longer an issue.
His vital signs remained stable and hypothermia/hypoTN were not an issue for several weeks leading up to discharge.
In fact, the pt's blood pressure and heart rate began to increase the week after Metoprolol was d/c'd and was added back in with a decrease in bp and pulse seen.
GI was consulted but felt the pt not stable for colonoscopy as the large ammount of ascites fluid would lead to infection.
Repeat level on [**7-6**] showed decreasing adenovirus levels at approx.
A repeat LP was performed on [**2124-7-14**], HHV-6, CMV, Enterovirus, viral culture, HSV PCR, EBV PCR, [**Male First Name (un) 2326**], Adenovirus were all negative.
Blood adenovirus level was present and found to be positive at titer approx.
A repeat measurement later in [**Month (only) **] showed a titer of 696, and no specific therapy was started.
BK viruria: The pt was noted to have RBC's in his UA during [**Month (only) **] and thus a BK virus assay was sent, which came back >5 million copies.
