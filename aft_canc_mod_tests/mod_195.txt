Chest X-Ray was unremarkable.
Pt was in a-fib with RVR and a rate of 130s-150s.
Due to recent PE, CT was obtained and showed decreased clot burden and stable infarct.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2163-6-30**] atrial fibrillation is new.
CTA ([**8-16**]): 1.
Although this may represent focal fatty infiltration, given history of malignancy, dedicated hepatic imaging is recommended to exclude metastasis.
Recommend DVT study for confirmation  ECHO ([**8-17**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
CXR ([**8-18**]): FINDINGS: There is new faint opacity in the left lower lobe which could represent early pneumonia.
His pressors were weaned off and his blood pressure was stable in the 90s-100s prior to transfer to the floor.
A CT was done given his recent PE, and it showed a decreased clot burden.
Echo was normal with a non-dilated LA.
Cardiac enzymes were negative, and a TSH was elevated (free T4 nl).
Pt was monitored on tele for24    hrs before d/c to [**Last Name (un) **].
Your low blood pressure was most likely from a combination of dehydration and the abnormal heart rhythm.
