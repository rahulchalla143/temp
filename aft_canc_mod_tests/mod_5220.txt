+ weakness  The morning of presentation, her daughter fed her, bathed her and took her in the car to her outpt chest CT recommended by thoracics.
She subsequently got a CTA of her chest which showed dramatic progression of her metastases vs superimposed infection, B pleural effusions (R>L).
The CT revealed a R mainstem bronchus intubation and the ETT was readjusted.
Metastatic renal cell ca: DOE in [**Month (only) 1096**]--> local ER--> new R pleural effusion; CT with L renal mass (5 x 6 cm, enhancing left renal mass) and B pulm nodules.
Had recurrent R pleural effusions since then  She had a biopsy of her left kidney on [**2101-1-3**], which showed renal cell carcinoma vs transitional cell ca with some granular and some clear cells features and a bone scan showed some skull involvement.

Bone scan was also done which had demonstrated increased uptake in the skull consistent with metastatic disease in the skull  2.
