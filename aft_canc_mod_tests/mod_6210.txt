His urine osms were greater than 350, urine sodium was 13.
It was believed that the low urine sodium was dependent on the sodium intake, and urine osms supported SIADH.
Serum sodium levels improved from initial 118 to 129 at which hypertonic saline was stopped and pt was started on 1L fluid restriction per renal recs.
Review of the most recent CT abdomen by radiology showed no new foci of necrosis that may have precipitated this repeat hyponatremia.
