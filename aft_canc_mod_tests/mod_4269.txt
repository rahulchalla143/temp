Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General [**Month/Day/Year 2947**] Service on [**2124-1-25**] for evaluation and treatment of periampullary adenocarcinoma.
On this date, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with open pancreatic biopsy, cholecystectomy, fiducial placement, gastrojejunostomy and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy for an intra-operative finding of ampullary cancer metastatic to common hepatic arterial lymph node, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
Post re-intubation CXR revealed a small apparent narrowing of the trachea just distal to the tip of the ETT, conceivably related to recent preceding intubation.
On [**2124-1-26**], a flexible bronchoscopy was performed, which did not show subglottic tracheal stenosis of the trachea endoscopically to any significant degree.
CXR on [**2124-1-27**] revealed that the lungs were grossly clear and hyperexpanded.
The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required.
