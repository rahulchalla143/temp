PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 1.
I now went ahead and explored this area more to find sclerotic, most likely tumor metastasis in and around the duodenum and the head of the pancreas which were not biopsied at this location.
She was profoundly icteric at the beginning of the operation without preoperative labs but I would estimate her bilirubin was at least 11 or 12.
We now irrigated and washed out the upper abdomen and then placed a 19 French [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain up in the right upper quadrant near the liver biopsy site and the cholecystojejunostomy anastomosis and the duodenorrhaphy to drain those three perilous areas.
The histologic features and immunophenotype are consistent with a breast origin.
Brief Hospital Course: [**2152-12-6**]: The patient had second ERCP attempted at [**Hospital1 18**] (first was [**12-5**] at OSH) which was complicated by duodenal perforation with a CT showing free peritoneal air.
