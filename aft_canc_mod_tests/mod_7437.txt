[**2124-3-28**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute large vascular territorial infarction.
[**2124-3-28**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO - No acute process in the abdomen or pelvis.
[**2124-3-28**] CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST - No acute fracture.
Minimal anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 is likely degenerative.
