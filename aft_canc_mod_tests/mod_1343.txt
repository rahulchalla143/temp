The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the time of interpretation of the study on [**2196-12-4**] at 11:30 a.m.  MRI C,T,L Spine [**12-3**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis or abscess in the cervical region.
No extrinsic spinal cord compression or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities  CT Head [**12-5**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head [**12-11**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Interval removal of ventricular drain, with stable right frontal subdural fluid collection, and no evidence of hydrocephalus or acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Multiple known metastatic lesions are much better-visualized on MR study of [**2196-12-3**].
Multiple known metastatic lesions are better characterized on prior study (MR [**2196-12-3**]).
Punctate dense focus along the lateral margin of the right lateral ventricle, not definitely seen on previous studies possibly a tiny focus of subependymal hemorrhage.
[**12-16**] head CT: IMPRESSION: Overall, minimal change from the comparison study done on the same date.
As before, the ventriculostomy catheter via the left frontal approach terminates in the parenchyma of the left frontal lobe and not within the ventricle.Subtle density right cerebellum represents metastasis seen on MRI of [**2196-12-3**].
Brief Hospital Course: 57 yo F with metastatic non-small cell lung CA and leptomeningeal disease s/p ommaya placement on [**2196-11-11**] s/p cycle 6 Pemetrexed completed [**11-30**], admitted [**Date range (1) 38706**] for staph meningitis treated with ~10 days of vancomycin and removal of ommaya, presenting to clinic [**12-2**] with fever 101/neck pain/HA, admitted for suspected recurrent meningitis.
MRI on [**2196-11-30**] shows progression of disease including lesions concerning for leptomeningeal disease.
Post operatively her CT dmonstrated good placement and no hemorrhage.
Follow-up CT stable.
Her EVD, which ahd been at 10cm H2O was raised to 15cm H2O with the continued goal of draining 10cc/hr and 80cc/shift.
A CT head was obtained and showed stable ventricular size and no subdural hematoma and her drain was lowered to 5cm above the tragus.
Her vancomycin was increased to 1250 [**Hospital1 **], and ther CSF cultures showed NGTD.
On [**12-14**], a lumbar puncture was performed, and CSF was sent for a final culture/gram stain.
Her neurological exam remained unchanged, and her repeat Head CT was stable.
She remained stable while there and a post-op CT of the head was routinely obtained which showed proper placement of the VP shunt catheter and Ommaya reservoir intracranially.
Discussions were had with the patient and her daughter [**Name (NI) 3235**] and the patient was offically made DNR/DNI.
?Your [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2729**] will be removed 7-10 days from your surgery.
