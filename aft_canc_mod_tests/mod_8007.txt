A speech and swallow evaluation was concerning for esophageal dysphagia; since this was known to be old by his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name (STitle) **], further evaluation was deferred for now; he was kept on a diet of ground solids and thin liquids.
A cardiology consultation was obtained; they recommended adding an ACEi to help maximize his medical management.
On admission, however, he was noted to have a markedly elevated INR which was presumed to be due to his concurrent antibiotic use.
His INR subsequently rose >9 and he was given 2 units of FFP while in the MICU.
On the day prior to discharge, his INR dropped to 1.8, which is below therapeutic level; he was bridged with treatment-dose enoxaparin on that day and his INR was 2.0 by the next day.
Medications on Admission: ASA 325 QD Metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] Insulin - humalin 70/30 15 U qam, 10 U qhs Imdur 120 qam Lipitor 80 qd Coumadin Amoxicillin 500 tid Colchicine 0.6 prn Dyazide 37.5/25 [**Hospital1 **] SLNTG prn   Discharge Medications: 1.
For your heart attack, you and your PCP have decided to maximize your medical management rather than pursue a stress test and possible invasiuve catheterization since it is unlikely that a catheterization would be of much benefit.
