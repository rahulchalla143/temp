MIBI in [**2152-6-23**] showed an ejection fraction of 50%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.5?????
?, blood pressure 161/47, pulse 74, respirations 14, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 L, 92% on room air.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission her white count was 6.4, hematocrit 37.5, platelet count 269, neutrophils 73, 22 lymphs, 3 monos; INR 1.1, PT 12.7, PTT 27.8; sodium 138, potassium 4.3, chloride 106, bicarb 22, BUN 36, creatinine 1.8, baseline 1.4-1.5; platelet count 151; calcium 10.6, magnesium 1.9, phos 3.1, CK 116, MB 5, troponin 0.04; Albumin 4.2; TSH 2.9; urinalysis with occasional bacteria, trace ketones, 30 protein.
Electrocardiogram was paced, lateral T-wave inversion, inferior T-wave inversion which new consistent with [**2152-6-23**].
Head CT showed three moderately large-sized mass lesions in the right posterior frontal, right anterior frontal lobe and left parietal lesion with significant edema.
Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, atelectasis, but no overt failure.
Knee films showed no fracture and no dislocation and degenerative changes with small right knee effusion.
Her Dilantin dose was increased to a total of 300 three times a day, given that her Dilantin level [**Company 2240**].i.d.
The patient will need her Dilantin level followed as an outpatient at her next appointment.
Hypertension:  The patient's blood pressures while in the Emergency Room were noted to be 200/100; however, once she was transferred to the floor, she maintained very good control on a combination of Clonidine, Hydrochlorothiazide and Minoxidil, Hydralazine, as well as Labetalol 400 b.i.d.
The patient's blood pressures were maintained in the 140s to 160s systolic, and it was decided that this was an appropriate range given that the patient needed to have adequate perfusion in the face of increased intracranial pressure.
Renal insufficiency:  Her creatinine remained at baseline between 1.4-1.5.
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction, and her electrocardiogram remained stable without any EKG changes.
Additionally her electrolytes were followed daily and were repleted as needed.
Her neurologic exam was significant for intact cranial nerves and the ability to move all extremities spontaneously.
Otherwise, the patient's exam neurologically was much improved.
