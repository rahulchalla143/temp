His INR was found to be supratherapeutic at 3.8.
The patient went to the Emergency Department with chest pain and received po and intravenous vitamin K, fresh frozen platelets and INR dropped to 1.0.

He received 250 cc bolus and blood pressure increased to 95.
The patient was sent for the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring of hypotension.
Hypercalcemia secondary to end stage renal disease and hyperparathyroidism with a PTH of 491 in [**2110-11-11**].
History of atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rate and primary AV delay in [**2110-11-11**].
Catheterization [**2110-11-11**] revealed one vessel disease in left anterior descending coronary artery disease approximately 50% stenosis of the left circumflex, impaired ejection fraction at 40% and 1+ aortic regurgitation and 3+ mitral regurgitation.
Heart rate 74.
Blood pressure 90/54.
Respirations 18.
Radial and dorsalis pedis pulses were 1+ bilaterally.
Lungs were clear to auscultation throughout.
PERTINENT LABORATORY STUDIES:  Anemia with a hematocrit of 30.7, white blood cell count of 13.6 with 95% neutrophilia.
Electrolytes significant for bicarb of 27, BUN 37, creatinine 6.3, and a potassium of 6.3.
Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute with lateral T wave inversions.
Electrocardiogram revealed no R wave progression and no R wave despite changes in lead placement.
Notably electrocardiogram sent from outside hospital taken on [**2-10**] three days prior revealed normal R wave and normal R wave progression throughout all precordial leads.
Blood pressure was increased in maps were maintained 60 to 65.
The patient persistent refused arterial blood gas and blood draws.
Bile was seen in the stomach and the esophagogastroduodenoscopy was normal to the third part of the duodenum and colonoscopy was recommended.
Blood pressure was stable and the patient was transferred to the floor.
CKs were cycled after initial event of chest pain and were positive with an MB index of 12.3.
Hematocrits were followed carefully.
Hematocrit continued to drop.
The patient received additional one unit of packed red blood cells when hematocrit dropped again to 30%.
Given the patient's change in mental status and frequent memory impairment he had a head CT to rule out subdural hemorrhage and there was no evidence of bleeding.
Colonoscopy on [**2-17**] revealed two ulcerations that were thought to be the probable sources of his gastrointestinal bleed.
Blood cultures were sent from his right femoral groin line.
Fem line was discontinued and the tip culture was sent and line was resighted to the left femoral vein with interventional radiology's assistance.
After being febrile the patient had persistent rigors and was found to have gram negative rods grow in his blood cultures.
Four out of four blood cultures were found to be positive for gram negative rods.
Antibiotics were changed to Levofloxacin po given sensitivities found on the gram negative rods.
Hematocrits were monitored carefully and were stable.
Final sensitivities of gram negative rods revealed Enterococcus faecalis and Salmonella.
The patient was maintained on Sevelamer and calcium acetate and aluminum hydroxide to keep his calcium phosphate less then 70.
He was maintained on a diabetic diet and glucose levels were less then 200 throughout his stay.
The patient was instructed to see a cardiolgoist for a myocardial perfusion study or catheterization to prevent additional myocardial infarctions.
The patient was instructed to have a colonoscopy on [**2112-8-12**] to evaluate for new polyps.
