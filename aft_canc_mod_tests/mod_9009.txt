The cardiac monitor shows an irregularly irregular rhythm.
[**2165-2-14**] Cerebrospinal fluid (lumbar puncture): NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CTA [**2165-2-16**] IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI showed at  least two small foci of "blooming" susceptibility artifact, centrally-located within a faint vascular blush related to an abnormal relatively superficial vessel.
Acute-chronic inflammatory changes involving, particularly, the left maxillary sinus and, to a lesser extent, the left anterior ethmoidal air cells; this appears worse since the recent outside study and should be correlated clinically.
Neither the MR nor the CT appearance is suggestive of cavernous angioma and, particularly given the association with abnormal vessel(s) in the region, hemorrhagic melanoma metastasis would be a very remote possibility; however, as he recommended, comparison with an even earlier MR study would be quite useful.
LP X 3 was performed following holding warfarin.
His cardiac enzymes were negative at OSH and Echo showed only LVH, no wall motion abnormalities.
Patient had a temp of 100.3F, w/ elevated WBC, and CXR concerning for possible aspiration.
)(s)* Refills:*2* 12. warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Neuro exam on discharge pertinent only for minimal (and improving daily) decreased strength in RUE.
Your CT scan and MRI images were reviewed: you were found to have changes in the blood vessels and lining of your brain.
We performed several lumbar punctures and EEGs: these studies were negative for malignant cells and seizure activity respectively.
The results will be forwarded to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] so that he can combine your outpatient work-up with this information.
