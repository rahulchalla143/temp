His current course was given from [**2-29**] to [**3-4**] and has been complicated by nausea/vomiting, encephalopathy, diarrhea, rigors, and desquamation, but also by hypotension in the 70s systolic requiring neo for 90 min on [**3-2**] and restarted again on [**3-5**], ARF with decreasing UOP (355 total cc's on [**3-5**], none on [**3-4**], + ~ 14L LOC but without detailed recording of his UOP), and progressive metabolic acidosis despite bicarb infusion.

A repeated CT with i.v.
[**2124-3-23**] MRI head 1.
TTE [**2124-3-6**]:  The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
TTE [**2124-3-8**]:  IMPRESSION: small pericardial effusion located mostly posterior to the left ventricle.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, which can be consistent with impaired ventricular filling but is more likely due to the irregularity of the heart rate.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-3-6**], this is a limited study.
CXR [**2124-3-6**]: Lung volumes are lower, pulmonary vasculature more engorged, and distended mediastinal veins, unchanged, pointing toward volume overload or cardiac decompensation.
CT head/chest non-con [**2124-3-7**]:  Slightly decreased vasogenic edema in region of known left temporal lobe metastasis.
CXR [**2124-3-8**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, a new central venous access line has been inserted over the left anterior jugular vein.
CXR [**2124-3-11**]: Tip of the endotracheal tube is no less than 48 mm from the carina, standard placement for patient of this size.
Portable Abdomen [**2124-3-10**]: FINDINGS: Supine AP abdomen radiograph demonstrates a nasogastric tube following a normal course and terminating in the distal stomach.

Echocardiogram as above, largely unremarkable.
Blood cultures eventually grew out MRSA, successive cultures negative until [**2124-3-10**], with [**2124-3-10**] culture growing vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
The patient's pressures stabilized and pressors were discontinued.
Repeat blood and urine cultures have been negative.
MRI head with improved findings.
An NGT was placed for 24 hours and the patient's MS cleared as did his SBO.
There was initially some concern for messenteric ischemia given guiaic positive stool, known necrotic fingers and subsequent CT abd findings, so GI and surgery were consulted.
Patient however soon improved clinically so further work-up with colonoscopy was not done.
The patient was called out to the OMED floor team for further managment.
K wnl, phos elevated though stable from last draw.
On the last days of admission he did not require diuresis and continued to auto-diurese with a creatinine of 1.1-1.3.
He was not continued on his anti-hypertensives as his SBPs were 130-140.
Mr. [**Known lastname 2795**] should have his renal function checked as an outpatient in the next 1-2 weeks.
Cardiac enzymes were flat, lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.
Repeat TTE showed no right heart strain.
CT head showed slight improvement in metastatic disease, less vasogenic edema.
Lumbar puncture was deferred given intracranial mass.
