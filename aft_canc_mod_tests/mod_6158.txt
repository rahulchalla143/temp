Blood culture drawn on [**2185-5-10**] at rehab reportedly grew GPC in chains.
On [**2185-5-12**] the patient was noted to have SBP in the mid-80s (baseline 110-130s) with tachypnea and increased oxygen requirement (baseline 88-90% on NC 3-5L).
In the ED, sBP 94, RR 26, HR 120s (irregularly irregular).
Blood, urine cultures sent.
On arrival to floor from ED he was hypoxic with oxygen saturation in upper 70s and was found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR (rate 120-130s), tachypnea, and increasd crackles.
Oxygen was increased to 6L by nasal cannula with rapid improvement of oxygen saturation to 95%.
ABG 7.50 // 30 // 58.

[**2185-5-12**] Chest X ray IMPRESSION: Left inferior hemithorax is excluded from the field of view.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-4-15**], the findings are similar, although no distinct aortic valve mass is identified on today's study.
[**2185-5-13**] Lower extremity ultrasound IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in bilateral lower extremities.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-4-18**], the severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced.
[**2185-5-19**] ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver is normal in size and echotexture.
[**2185-5-20**] MR OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV GADOLINIUM (MR ENTEROGRAPHY): T2-weighted dynamic images demonstrate normal peristalsis of the stomach and small bowel.
As demonstrated on the recent CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis is diffuse atherosclerotic plaque throughout the abdominal aorta.
These findings are stable over the short interval compared to the recent CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis.
MR OF THE PELVIS WITH IV GADOLINIUM (MR ENTEROGRAPHY): The pelvic portions of large and small bowel including terminal ileum and rectosigmoid are unremarkable without evidence of inflammatory change, wall thickening, stricture or mass lesion.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images generated on an independent workstation were valuable in assessment for source of infection or bleeding.
Atherosclerotic disease including infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm and right common iliac artery aneurysm not changed over the short interval compared to CTA abdomen and pelvis [**2185-4-23**].
[**2185-5-21**] CT chest: There is stable severe emphysema with bullous change at the lung apices as well as the right lung base.
The patient had an ECHO, which showed an EF of 35%.
Chest X ray showed bibasilar opacities and air-space opacities consistent with atelectasis vs pneumonia.
He had a sputum which only showed mixed respiratory flora.
LENIs were obtained and were negative for DVT.
Cardiac enzymes were also obtained and were negative x3 sets.
He remained 2 L negative per day for 5 days with only mild improvement in his oxygen requirement (low 80s on RA - 94% 4L).
Chest Ct was obtained and showed bilateral pleural effusions, stable severe emphasema, cardiomegally, and a new 7 mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
It was thought that his continued hypoxia was from acute CHF with a component of recent pulmonary events.
His first set of blood cultures obtained at [**Hospital1 18**] was positive for Enterococcus, pan-sensitive.
Because he had a recent positive VRE swab, he was empirically treated with Linezolid, but this was then changed to ampicillin after cultures showed it was sensitive.
Surveillance cultures remained negative until [**2185-5-16**] when they showed one culture positive for gram positive cocci.
A transthoracic and trans esophageal echocardiogram were performed and showed no vegetations.
Because he had recently had a colonoscopy that was negative for a source (colon cancer), an MR enterography was performed to investigate the small bowel.
This study was also unrevealing for a source of his bacteremia.
Coumadin was continued and he was found to have a subtheraputic INR during which time he was bridged with heparin.
His INR later became therapeutic and heparin was stopped.
His blood pressure remained in the SBP 100s-120s on this regimen.
His diltiazem was discontinued and he was aggressively diuresed as his blood pressure could tolerate.
Acute systolic CHF: The patient had an ECHO with EF 35%, similar to prior a study on [**4-2**].
As above, he should eventually start an ACE inhibitor if his blood pressure can tolerate it.
His WBC count was elevated between 13 and 19, which was lower than baseline.
# Pulmonary nodule: Seen on CT scan of the chest.
The patient should have a follow up CT scan in four months.
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).
Levalbuterol HCl 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: Three (3) ML Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for Shortness of breath.
You had tests which showed that it was not coming from your heart.
You also had an MRI which showed that there is no evidence of cancer in your gut that could have caused this.
It was thought that your fast heart rate and CHF caused you to be short of breath.
