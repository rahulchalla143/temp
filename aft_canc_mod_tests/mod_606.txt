The patient noted an increase in shortness of breath for a few days and a chest x-ray revealed a new left pleural effusion.
After the procedure, she was noted to be tachycardic to the 160s, with a blood pressure in the 80s.
This dropped her heart rate from the 150s to the 80s, but she had a transient decrease in blood pressure.
Blood pressure responded to IV fluids.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 92, blood pressure 119/74, respiratory rate 34, 99% on room air.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 4.9, hematocrit 34.8, platelets of 253, neutrophils 85%, lymphocytes 7.6, monocytes 6.7.
Sodium 137, potassium 4.4, chloride 100, bicarb 21, BUN 34, creatinine 10, glucose of 170.
Calcium of 9.3, magnesium of 2.2, phosphorus of 4.5, AST of 48, alkaline phosphatase of 91.
TSH of 1.4.
CK 35, troponin less than 3.
Pleural fluid demonstrated 20-50 white blood cells, 6,000 red blood cells, 6 polys, 33 lymphocytes, 21 monocytes, 20 mesothelial cells, protein 3.6, glucose of 112, LDH of 474 with a pH of 7.3.
Chest x-ray on [**10-11**] with decreased pleural effusion and increased aeration when compared to [**10-14**] which showed a left pleural effusion with collapse.
CT scan of the chest of [**2114-7-19**], nodule new left lower lobe, old lingular, in the left base increased ground glass.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 70-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer status post thoracentesis was admitted with increased heart rate and decreased blood pressure, was admitted for observation.
She was kept on Telemetry, her enzymes were cycled, and was given diltiazem as needed for blood pressure as well as rate control.
It was noticed on the day following admission, on examination patient had alternating loud versus soft heart sounds, bedside echocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated a pericardial effusion, the patient was emergently transferred to the catheterization laboratory, where a pericardial drain was placed.
At that point, equalization of RA and pericardial pressures was confirmed which diagnosed tamponade.
The catheterization report specifically said pericardial pressure was decreased from 20 mm Hg to less than 0 mm Hg, and the right atrial pressure decreased from 18 mm Hg to [**4-27**], P.A.
On [**10-15**], a therapeutic tap of the right pleural effusion was performed without complications.
On the 28th, a followup echocardiogram was also performed which demonstrated decreased size of pericardial effusion, without evidence of tamponade.
The repeat echocardiogram based on this episode of hypotension on the 30th, was negative for recurrent pericardial effusion.
The patient continued to have followup echocardiograms with no evidence of pericardial effusion reaccumulation.
The followup chest x-ray did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumothorax or effusion reaccumulation.
