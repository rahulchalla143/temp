She was originally sent to [**Hospital3 **] where labs were collected and she was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] without intervention.
Her BP was 100s/70s, HR 100s and 96% on 3.5 L. .
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED T 98.2, HR 118, BP 102/67, 15, 98% on 4L NC.
On exam she has decreased BL BS and dullness to purcussion.
CXR showed L > R pleural effision and possible RLL PNA.
EKG showed sinus tach and RBBB of unclear chronicity.
Labs significant for WBC of .6 with ANC of 420.
VS prior to transfer HR 107, BP 105/67, R 14, 100% Non Re-breather.
Gastric bx confirmed dx of metastatic breast ca and she was started on paclitaxel.

Stool C-diff negative x 3 .
Blood, urine, and pleural fluid cultures: negative .
Cardiac Echo Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
A sessile 12 by 16 mm globular apical mass is seen in the left ventricle.
New left ventricular apical filling defect, most likely represents a thrombus as it was not present on the CTA of [**2137-1-2**] but a cardiac metastasis could also have this appearance.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2137-2-12**] IMPRESSION: Possible focus of abnormal enhancement identified in the right frontal lobe, involving the right straight gyrus, measuring approximately 2.8 x 3.3 mm in size, with no evidence of mass effect or shifting of the adjacent structures.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2137-2-17**]  FINDINGS: Catheters overlie both hemithoraces.
Right Port-A-Cath is still present.
Hypoxia / hypercarbia: She initially required a non-rebreather to keep her O2 sats >90%.
Since her CXR showed a possible RLL PNA, we did cover for a simultanous HCAP with Vancomycin and Cefepime.
She will need follow-up with IP in 2 weeks with a repeat CXR in 2 weeks.
All cultures are negative and finalized.
Subsegmental PE: CTA showed a RLL subsegmental PE as well as a "LLL pulmonary arterial filling defect."
MRI brain showed a likely metastatic lesions, and she was therefore not anticoagulated.
Echocardiogram showed a mass suggesting vascularized tissue in left ventricle (a likely metastasis).
Palliative care was consulted to help patient to better cope with her illness, address goals of care, and provide an effective pain regimen.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a low white blood cell count and fatigue after getting chemotherapy.
You also had a blood clot in your lungs.
