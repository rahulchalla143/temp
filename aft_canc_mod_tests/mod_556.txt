In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was A&Ox2, CT of the head showed interval development of hypodensity within the grey matter of the bilateral posterosuperior parietal, possibly occipital lobes.
He was also found to be hypertensive with SBP to 180s, HR 40's.
EKG had no specific changes, but had possible new TWI in L, V6; TNT was elevated to 0.46 with flat [**Name (NI) **] (pt without sx).
LBP, s/p L4-5 laminectomy [**2108**] 5.  s/p Carpal tunnel release 6.
Imaging: CT head: interval devpt of hypodensity iwthin [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter of bilateral posterosuperior parietal, possibly occipital lobes, new from [**11-4**] .
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.

[**11-24**] MRI (full read):  FINDINGS: There are multiple new areas of T2 signal abnormality, involving the cortex and underlying white matter of the occipital lobes and cerebellar hemispheres.
The right occipital lobe enhancing metastasis is unchanged in size and less well seen on today's study than previously.
Overall, the post-gadolinium images are blurry due to motion artifact.
Gradient echo images demonstrate previously identified areas of susceptibility artifact.
MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates flow in both intracranial internal carotid arteries and in the anterior and middle cerebral arterial branches proximally.
MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] is limited but demonstrates flow in the major branches of this circulation, though flow is attenuated in the left vertebral artery.
Neuro: upon admission, pt had a head MRI performed which showed new multifocal cerebral and cerebellar infarcts which were believed to be responsible for the mental status changes and R sided weakness.
