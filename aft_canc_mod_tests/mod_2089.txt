CT of the torso on [**2134-8-13**] demonstrated two enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla.
Lymph node biopsy was performed [**8-16**] with excision of the right axillary lymph node.

Pertinent Results: LABORATORY DATA:  Today are significant for white blood cell count of 9.1 with a differential of 72% neutrophils, 20% lymphs, 5.5% monocytes, 1.6% eos, 0.3% basophils.
His hematocrit is 34.3 with an MCV of 85.
Glucose of 77, BUN is 12, creatinine is 0.8, sodium 135, potassium 4, chloride 105.
Calcium is 9.1 down from 13, phos is low at 1.0, magnesium is 1.6.
EKG: NSR at 67bpm, nl axis and intervals, small q's inferiorly with TWI in III  MRI of the brain shows no evidence of malignancy.

Patient was rehydrated with IVF and blood pressure meds were initially held.
Blood pressure improved and remained hemodynamically stable.
Lymphoma:  As mentioned, axillary LN biopsy results were c/w Burkitt's Lymphoma which correlates with the constellation of symptoms that the pt presented with.
The patient was continued on IVFs and tumor lysis labs were monitored initially q 6 hours, then [**Hospital1 **].
Given NTG SL x 2 with resolution of chest pain, then became hypotensive w/ BP in 80's/50's.
Pt received fluid boluses of NS and was given 15mg diltiazem which improved BP to 90's/50's-70's and decreased HR to 90's, remained in AFib.
Pt remained comfortable during ICU stay, BP remained stable at 90-100/50-70's, HR remained stable at 90's, and in and out of AFib.
Etiology of this new onset AFib is unclear - likely idiopathic vs. [**1-27**] ischemia (without infarct) as ST depressions anterolaterally seen on EKG during acute episode.
Patient did not demonstrate any symptoms of CHF, oxygen saturation remained 95-99% on room air.
BPH - No evidence of hydronephrosis on renal u/s.
