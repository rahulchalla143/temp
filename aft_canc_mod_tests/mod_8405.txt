IMAGING: CXR [**4-18**] - Since the prior study, there has been development of a vague opacity in the right mid lung.
Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.
CTA chest [**4-18**] - The right thyroid lobe is largely replaced by multiple nodules, the largest of which measures 18 x 18 mm, unchanged from [**2130-10-17**].
The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are normal in appearance.
Imaging of the upper abdomen is not sufficient for diagnosis.
Bronchial wash [**4-20**] - NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Barium swallow study [**4-22**] - 1.
EGD [**4-23**] - Small hiatal hernia, Schatzki's ring (dilation),Erythema and granularity in the antrum compatible with chronic gastritis.

1) Fevers: Due to multifocal PNA seen on imaging on admission.
The following day, a blanching maculopapular rash was noted over the torso and upper thighs, which was concerning for a drug rash.
Sputum cxs were negative for fungus, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] AFB smear negative.
Urine legionella negative.
There was a question of TE fistula on the admission CT scan after further review with the MICU attending, but there no evidence of TE fistula was seen on bronch.
A speech and swallow consult was negative for OP aspiration.
She was discharged in good condition and will complete the course of azithromycin at home and will come into the 7[**Hospital 1826**] clinic daily to receive an infusion of ertapenem to finish a 14 day course.
During the hospital course, the pt did not require any blood product transfusions to keep her hct > 25, plts > 10K.
GI was consulted who recommended a barium swallow study which showed distal obstruction at the GE junction.
She underwent an EGD the following day in which a Schatski's ring was dilated.
You also had an EGD to evaluate difficulty swallowing and had a dilation of your lower esophagus, where a stricture was found.
