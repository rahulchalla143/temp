Imaging: CT head ([**3-9**]): IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage.
CXR ([**3-9**]): 1.
If possible, lateral radiographs would be helpful in further evaluating this region.
CTA chest ([**3-10**]): 1.
CXR ([**3-10**]): Persistent left lower lobe consolidation and pleural effusion, consistent with the history of pneumonia.
Prominent left hilum, which could be further evaluated on a PA and lateral radiograph when feasible.
ECHO ([**3-10**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Microbiology: blood culture ([**3-9**]): no growth to date sputum culture ([**3-9**]): contaminated   Brief Hospital Course: 84F Chinese-speaking with PMH dementia, CHF, HTN, goiter, and large mass involving pancreatic tail with unresponsive episode while at Nursing Home, likely precipitated by hypoxia/infection in setting of LLL pneumonia/lung collapse.
Coumadin 5 mg daily, will need INR checked in [**2-15**] days.
Avoid benzos, anticholinergic agents 2.
History confirmed per [**Hospital1 336**] records as above; no further evaluation at this time for presumed incurable neoplasm.
REVIEW OF [**Hospital1 336**] RECORDS: DISCHARGE SUMMARY [**2147-12-5**] CHEST CT WITH CONTRAST [**2147-12-4**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Narrowed airway at the level of the vocal cords as well as thyroid with possible mass at the level of the left vocal cord, laryngoscopic examination is recommended.
There is a concern for a malignant neoplastic process, further evaluation is recommended.
Possible clot vs masses in left atrium, right atrium and right atrium/IVC junction, echocardiogram is recommended.
Echocardiogram did not confirm intracardiac clot/masses, LVEF 40% with mild global hypokineses as awell as 2+MR/2+TR.
Regarding pancreatic mass, "There was a family meeting including the patient herself and the decision was made not to pursue further workup as the patient was feeling well and did not wish to pursue invasive testing."
