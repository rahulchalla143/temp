At [**Location (un) 14078**] he was found to have 150 episodes of VT. Overnight he evidently had 10 episodes ventricular tachycardia (asymptomatic) and is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for EP study and possible ablation.
# CHF with LV EF of 25% # Ventricular Tachycardia: had pacemaker placed in [**2114**] for primary prevention (MADIT criteria); had [**Hospital1 18**] hospitalization [**3-26**] (started on amio; d/c'd due to "balance disorder/falls"), started on procainamide [**12/2116**]; decreased from 1000mg tid to 500mg tid with level 7.2 on [**10-15**].
Remote smoking history, no EtOH  Family History: Father died with CAD; healthy son; daughter with [**Name2 (NI) 95740**]  Physical Exam:  HR 63 (atrially paced); BP 104/76; T 98.1; RR 13 98% RA Gen: well-appearing elderly male in NAD HEENT: NCAT, MMM CV: RRR grade 2-3/6 mid-peaking systolic murmur heard best at RUSB and LUSB; No radiation to carotids or axilla.

Tx reaction w/u: negative .
LV systolic function appears depressed.
[**11-24**] eccho: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-11-23**], the size of the posterior effusion is slightly smaller.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P 82 yo with CAD s/p old IMI, 2 vessel CABG in [**2101**], NSTEMI in [**2113**] with stent to native L circ, CHF with EF 25-30%, VT s/p ICD placement presenting with recurrent VT.
The drain was pulled and repeat eccho initially showed some small reaccumulation which was subsuquently stable with no evidence tamponade.
Direct pressure and pressure dressing applied with good effect.
If this fluid reaccumulates you could have symptoms such as light headedness, severe fatigue, low blood pressure, lower extremity swelling, or difficulty breathing.
You will need to have your procainamide level checked and potassium and BUN, Creatinine checked.
