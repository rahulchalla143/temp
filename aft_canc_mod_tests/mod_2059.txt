The patient had a chest computerized tomography scan at the outside hospital which reportedly showed an extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
On [**2196-11-17**], a bronchoscopy showed abnormal mucosa in the bronchus intermedius, however, biopsies were nondiagnostic for malignancy.
A mediastinoscopy was then done which revealed a firm lymph node mass directly inferior to the innominate vein in the pretracheal and right paratracheal region.
Biopsy of the mass was consistent with nonsmall cell cancer and later reported as large cell lung carcinoma.
A repeat bronchoscopy showed narrowing of the trachea to 8 mm.
No report of the bronchoscopy was sent with the hospital discharge summary from [**Hospital3 **], therefore it is unclear where this narrowing was visualized.
Chest x-ray from the outside hospital was consistent with interstitial edema and bibasilar air space disease as per report.
Sputum cultures from the outside hospital, positive for gram positive cocci.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination temperature 95, heartrate 94, blood pressure 163/86, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturations 25% on 50% FIO2.
The patient came over on SIMV with title volumes of 700, respiratory rate of 10, pressure support of 5 and 5 with arterial blood gases of 7.39, 4, 5 and 70.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, neck appears swollen symmetrically.
Breasts, right breast with a peau d'orange appearance, however, no masses were felt.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies from outside hospital revealed arterial blood gases 7.27, 62 and 80 on SIMV 700, rate of 8, pressure support of 10 and 5, rate was increased to 10 after this gas was attained.
White blood cell count 5.8, hematocrit 35.7, platelets 82, MCV 95.
PT 15.3, PTT 34, INR 1.3, fibrinogen 381, D-Dimer 1, no range was given, however, this is marked as high.
Sodium 135, potassium 4.1, chloride 100, bicarbonate 29, BUN 15, creatinine .5, glucose 266, calcium 8.7, magnesium 1.8, iron 42, TIBC 249, ferritin 259.
Total bilirubin .3, ALT 24, AST 24, total protein 6.5, albumin 3.4, alkaline phosphatase 129, Vitamin B 12 910, Folate 10.6.
From [**11-17**], bronchial washings, gram stains a few polys, a few gram positive cocci and culture consistent with normal Flora.
Chest x-ray from outside hospital per report, endotracheal tube with tip carinii, cardiomegaly, right lower lobe infiltrate.
Chest x-ray from outside report on [**11-18**], mild interstitial edema, bibasilar air space disease.
The patient had a computerized tomography scan of the trachea on [**11-28**] after eight to nine doses of radiation which showed trachea that was patent with improvement in its caliber and less extrinsic compression seen on previous computerized tomography scan.
After it was established that the patient had a significant air leak, she had a bronchoscopy done by Interventional Pulmonology which showed extrinsic compression of the right middle lobe bronchus, however, significant air movement was seen in the right middle lobe bronchus and it was felt that the patient could be safely extubated without need of stent in the right middle lobe bronchus.
She required frequent suctioning due to secretions and required both nasal cannula and high flow oxygen to maintain a saturation above 90%.
It was also noted that the patient had a persistent elevated right hemidiaphragm on serial chest x-rays.
The patient also had vital capacities done both supine and sitting up.
The patient's vital capacity decreased 50% in the supine position.
By x-ray, chest computerized tomography scan, it appears that the patient may be suffering from aspiration as well.
The patient does not currently have a gag reflex, and a speech and swallow study is pending at this time.
On head computerized tomography scan no metastatic disease was found, however, the patient had significant sinusitis involving both maxillary sinuses.
Delta Multiple sclerosis - It was noted that post extubation the patient had confusion and delirium.
Oncology - The patient had a chest computerized tomography scan which showed a right middle lobe dominant lesion of approximately 2 cm.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient no longer has an nasogastric tube and is pending a speech and swallow evaluation.
Cardiac - Given that the patient has an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray and some evidence of interstitial edema an echocardiogram was obtained.
This showed global HK with an ejection fraction of approximately 45%.
Tubes, lines and drains - The patient has a PICC line, day #8 at this time of this dictation and she has a Foley catheter.
Prophylaxis - The patient is on heparin subcutaneous and Protonix.
Right diaphragm paralysis 5.
Sinusitis 8.
