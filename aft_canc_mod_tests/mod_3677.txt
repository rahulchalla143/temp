Admission Date:  [**2199-7-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-7-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2127-7-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Cephalosporins / Carbapenem  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension s/p cardiac arrest   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Rigid bronchoscopy with argon therapy 2.
Bronchial embolization: A-gram showed patchy blush in the region of LUL --> embolized with gelfoam.
Patient then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of persistent hemoptysis.
L lingular bleeding was treated with 3 rounds of argon laser coagulation which patient tolerated well.
CPR was initiated and patient received atropine and epinephrine boluses.
A femoral CVL was placed along with an a-line.
Pulses were regained but pressures remained low.
An intraoperative TEE showed air in the RA, RV, LV, aorta, and RCA.
She was noted to be in Afib at that time and was given 150 mg of amiodarone with conversion to sinus rhythm but also further drop in her blood pressures requiring increase in her epinephrine gtt.
Following resusitation, TEE showed resolutiion of air in RCA and improved biventricular function.
Past Medical History: # NSCLC (LUL) - dx'ed by biopsy - complicated by hemoptysis # Type 2 DM # h/o PE s/p IVC filter # HTN # hypercholesteremia # COPD # s/p tonsillectomy # s/p cholecystectomy .
Physical Exam: T: 95.9, BP: 181/88, HR: 120 , RR: 18, O2: 100% on 1.0 FiO2 Gen: intubated, sedated HEENT: Pupils fixed and dilated but equal.

QWs V1-2.
The procedure is being performed for airway evaluation and control of hemoptysis.
Initial evaluation revealed frank blood in the trachea and bilateral mainstem bronchi which was suctioned clean.
Evaluation of the right-sided airways did not reveal any evidence of active bleeding.
Using a flexible bronchoscope, an argon plasma coagulation probe was advanced into the left upper lobe and coagulation was performed x3.
The rigid bronchoscope was removed and she was easily intubated over a Cook catheter with an endotracheal tube #7.
The patient also received epinephrine and norepinephrine for blood pressure support.
CPR was performed for aproximately 1-2min, until spontaneous return of circulation.
A transesophageal echocardiogram performed in the operating room [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular failure, blood clot in RAand PA, gas in aorta and small PFO.
The patient was transferred in a critical condition to the intensive care unit for further care.
Lung Cancer 2.
HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2199-7-26**] HISTORY:  72-year-old woman status post air embolus in aorta and status post cardiac arrest, now with decreased mental status.
TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained without the administration of IV contrast.
COMPARISON:  There were no prior studies for comparison.
All hemodynamic parameters as measured by Swanz Ganz were in good standing.
broad spectrum antibiotic treatment begun - Tx with Levo, vanc, flagyl - treat air embolus with high flow supplemental O2 to maximize air diffusion through pulmonary vasculature - Cardiology consulted, no treatment given source of STEMI was air emoboli.
- minimize PEEP if possible to allow for air diffusion out of blood - hold antiplatelet agents and other anticoagulation given recent hemoptysis and air embolus presumed as etiology - levophed and fluids for goal CVP 8-12 and SBP > 140.
- hold anticoagulation as above - transfuse for goal Hct>30 - hold beta blocker in the setting of hypotension - Cardiac enzymes elevated but are trending down - serial EKGs .
-- consult Neuro for EEG and/or CT of brain/MRI brain -- CT Head result: severe diffuse cerebral edema, consistent with anoxic/low perfusion brain injury .
Further advancement obstructs RUL, and further removal, no longer selective intubation.
- hold anticoagulation - f/u repeat TTE to evaluate for presence of persistent RA thrombus .
# post-obstructive pna: presumed given CXR findings on admission.
