On arrival to cardiac catheterization lab at [**Hospital1 18**], patient was noted to be hypertensive 200/85.
Left heart catheterization demonstrated LVEDP of 40mmHg, LAD with diffuse disease and a 99% mLAD stenosis, LCx with diffuse disease, 50% pLCx stenosis, 90% mLCx lesion after OM1, 70% OM1, pRCA occlusion with large conus with 80% stenosis giving collaterals to LAD and RCA.
She was transferred to CCU for further management of blood pressure and CHF.

EKG [**2185-2-16**] - Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2185-2-15**] the rate has slowed.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Cardiac catherization - 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left sided filling pressures consistent with diastolic dysfunction, with LVEDP 40 mm Hg.
The systemic arterial pressure was elevated with central aortic pressure 184/79 mm Hg.
Patient was symptom free, and ECG done during catheterization showed resolution of ST segment changes.
# Chest pain: ST-elevations may have been secondary to aneurysmal changes noted on [**Hospital3 4107**] echocardiogram and confirmed on echocardiography today at [**Hospital1 18**].
STarted patient on Imdur 30 mg PO daily for both blood pressure and anginal control.
Echocardiogram with aneurysmal changes, possible thrombus in LV.
# Chronic renal failure - baseline unknown, Cr currently 1.5 and stable, potassium stable, continue to monitor.
Docusate 100mg [**Hospital1 **] #.
We did a catheterization which showed chronic heart disease but no clear signs of an acute heart attack.
We also did blood tests which showed that you did not have a heart attack.
Followup Instructions: We have made you a follow up appointment with your primary care physicin for Wednesday, [**2185-2-23**] at 11:00am with [**Last Name (LF) 61898**],[**First Name3 (LF) 278**] T. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 61899**], F. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 33401**].
