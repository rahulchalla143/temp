In the ED, his VS were T 100.0 (po), HR 103, BP 118/50, RR 16, O2 99% on RA.
His SBP dropped from >100 to the mid-80s and he received 4L of IVFs, and R IJ was inserted.
A urine sample was collected both the from nephrostomy site and 2nd from urine (post-neobladder).
[**3-/2150**] --> CT scan was reportedly normal, persistently abnormal urine cytology despite normal cystoscopies.
[**2151-3-30**] --> annual CT scan showed a 1.8 cm heterogeneous solid appearing left renal lesion and a 15 x 10 mm soft tissue lesion adjacent to the left psoas muscle in the upper pelvis, adjacent to the surgical clips and encasing the left common iliac artery, suspicious for recurrent disease.
[**2151-4-9**] --> underwent a renal ultrasound on which showed a 1.4-cm lesion arising from the mid pole of the left kidney with low-level echoes, new evidence of left sided hydronephrosis, and a 2.8-cm lesion arising from the anterior aspect of the liver.
He then underwent an MRI of the abdomen which noted severe left sided hydronephrosis and a small, rounded, hemorrhagic cyst in the lower pole of the left kidney measuring 1.6 cm.
MRI suspicious for liver lesion (subsequent bx [**6-29**] reportedly negative) [**5-/2151**] --> percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement on the left, followed by an attempt at antegrade stent in [**6-/2151**], but complicated by urosepsis per report.
[**7-/2151**] --> underwent PET scan in and the preliminary report showed an FDG avid soft tissue lesion around the left distal ureter in the mesocolon and left groin, likely representing recurrent disease; multiple FDG avid retroperitoneal lymph nodes; a 10 mm FDG avid sclerotic lesion in the left symphysis pubis; bulky left thyroid lobe; and an 18 x 15mm exophytic hyperdense lesion in the midpole of the left kidney, likely representing hemorrhagic cyst [**2151-9-29**] --> decreased output from L nephrostomy - tube replaced with good drainage .
Pertinent Results: Na 136, K 4.1, Cl 103, HCO 22, BUN 18, Creat 1.3, Gluc 98 .
WBC 12.0, HCT 34.5, Plt 222 (MCV 93) - N 87.5%, L 7.6%, M 4.1%, E 0.6% .
U/A (nephrostomy): mod LE, +nitr, tr protein, large blood, RBC [**6-1**], >50 WBC, few bacteria, many yeast .
Urine cytology [**2151-10-8**]: No malignany cells .
[**2151-10-23**] CT URO Abd/Pelv: IMPRESSION: Right hydroureteronephrosis.
Further evaluation with ureteroscopy/brushings is recommended.
Histiocytes, many neutrophils, fungal forms consistent with  	 [**Female First Name (un) **] species, and red blood cells.
Antegrade nephrostogram demonstrated occlusion at middle portion of the left ureter, mild hydronephrosis, and no filling defects visualized.
Multiple foci of increased tracer uptake within the pelvis with corresponding sclerotic lesions on CT worrisome for metastatic disease.
# Sepsis: Pt presented with leukocytosis to 12K, fever, and hypotension to SBP 80s intermittently.
A CVL (R IJ) placed in the ED, bolused total of 4L, SBP to low 100s without pressors.
[**10-23**] urine cultures grew back E. Coli with >100K colonies and Vanc was subsequently d/c'd.
The pt underwent an MR urogram on [**10-25**] that revealed Right hydronephrosis and hydroureter with area of narrowing  at the anastomosis between the distal right ureter and the chimney of the neobladder.
The pt underwent a renal scan that showed High-grade obstruction of the right kidney.
Creatinine remained at baseline at discharge.
# Bladder Ca: The mass seen causing the hydronephroiss as well as the bone lesions are concerning for recurrent disease vs a new primary.
BP remained stable off lisinopril.
# Code: Full code, confirmed with patient  # Comm: wife [**Name (NI) 17**] - (h) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 38945**], (c) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 38946**]   Medications on Admission: - Glipizide 5mg po daily - Lisinopril 10mg po daily - ASA 81mg po daily (not taking since nephrostomy tube placed) - B12 250mg po daily - MVI .
You were also found to have new masses in your pelvis and will need to discuss further evaluation and treatment with you primary Oncologists.
