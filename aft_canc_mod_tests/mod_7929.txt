IMAGING:  CT abd [**10-21**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Worsening ground-glass and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] nodular opacities in the lung bases concerning for an infectious process/small airways disease.
Attention warranted on followup CT after treatment.
CT chest [**10-23**]: IMPRESSION: Extensive lymphadenopathy in the thoracic inlet.
CT neck [**10-23**]: 1.
Pleural effusions, pulmonary opacities, and mediastinal lymph nodes are better assessed on the concurrent chest CT. .
INTERPRETATION Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a Kappa light chain restricted B-cell lymphoproliferative process which expresses CD10 and is negative for CD5, CD23 and FMC-7.
TTE [**10-24**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Renal US [**10-24**]: IMPRESSION: Normal renal ultrasound.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**10-24**]: IMPRESSION: Small area of possible focal gliosis is noted on the right frontal lobe, measuring approximately 10 x 6 mm in size, there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement in this lesion, other entities, including a non-enhancing mass lesion cannot be completely excluded.
Pathology [**10-26**]: DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal lymph nodes, incisional biopsy      Diffuse & Nodular large B cell lymphoma (See note) .
CXR [**10-26**]: Some atelectasis at the left base is seen but this was present on the prior chest x-ray of [**Month (only) **] the 11th.
CSF Cytology [**10-29**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Please upload preoperative imaging if available to PACS for comparison.
CT HEAD 9/30:1.
CT ABDOMEN [**11-10**]: 1.
Unusual globular appearance of the pancreatic tail which appears isodense to the spleen; consider ectopic spleen, which could be confirmed with sulfur colloid study or damaged RBC study on a non-emergent basis.
TTE for baseline cardiac assessment was grossly normal with EF>55% and no valvular abnormalities or focal hypokinesis.
Flow cytometry of CSF shows negative for malignant cells.
TLS labs were checked twice a day and the patient was continued on acyclovir prophylaxis and provided with caphosol mouth care.
Blood cultures drawn during sepsis grew pansensitve Klebsiella, and he completed a 14 day course of piperacillin/tazobactam.
Patient's LFTs normalized and when the biliary drain did not drain anything in 24 hrs, it was capped.
The drain was uncapped and 650 cc of cloudy fluid was drained with immediate relief of pain, recovery of blood pressure, and resolution of fever.
Upon discharge he was set up with a VNA to draw daily sodium levels and fax them to an endocrinologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4160**].
His hematocrit remained stable during admission and he was hemodynamically stable.
# Pituitary Mass/Panhypopituitarism:  Obtained [**Hospital1 3278**] records which showed patient was found to be panhypopit after presenting in severe malaise.
MRI brain showed abnormal enhancement of pituitary infundibulum.
Received transphenoidal biopsy, which showed normal bone in clivus and normal brain tissue in pituitary, no tumor cells.
He should have a repeat MRI in [**4-13**] weeks and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] (neuro-oncologist) to make sure no tumor appears.
Paraneoplastic syndrome was not likely since PTHrp was 26, within reference range.
FENa > 1% suggesting ATN.
Renal US showed no tumor involvement causing obstruction.
#Urethral bleeding:  Patient was catheterized early on transfer to the floor for DDAVP test and started to have mild urethral bleeding.
# Pulmonary Nodules:  Patient had CT chest that showed diffuse and partly clustered micronodules with tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] distribution, as well as airway wall thickening and mild irregularities.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please ensure that he continues to stay on schedule with R-CHOP cycles (cycle 1 completed during this admission) for his DLBCL.
He can have these at Cape Code Hospital with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] but he should not miss any cycles if he is able to tolerate them medically - Please ensure that he maintains his prednisone between 7.5 and 10 mg daily to ensure adrenal support - Please monitor his serum sodium daily for the next 2 weeks.
He has been stable on desmopressin 0.05 mg PO at night - Please check hematocrit, calcium, and creatinine at follow-up to ensure that these are remaining normal - He should have a repeat MRI in [**4-13**] weeks and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] (neuro-oncologist) to make sure no tumor appears.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw serum sodium levels daily.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw CBC with differential, serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine) every week.
