An echocardiogram on [**2151-2-18**] showed progression of aortic stenosis with aortic valve area falling from 0.9 to 0.6 centimeters squared between last year and this year.
Compared with [**2150-1-29**], LV systolic function was diminished and aortic stenosis thought to have progressed.
R heart cath and L heart cath was performed in addition to the valvuloplasty.
Hemodynamics showed baseline mean aortic valve gradient ~35mm Hg with calculated [**Location (un) 109**] 0.69cm2.
LV gram was not performed.
L heart cath revealed left dominant system: LMCA: dual ostia of LAD and LCx from aorta LAD: 50% ostial, otherwise normal LCX: normal RCA: normal.

Cardiac cath [**2151-3-8**] COMMENTS:   1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided filling pressures with very mild elevation of left sided filling pressure with PCWP and LVEDP of about 15mmHG.
There was no step up in oxygen saturations from SVC to PA. 3.
Following balloon valvuloplasty, the aortic valve gradient decreased to 30 mmHg with a calculated valve area of 0.8 cm2.

On POD 0, the patient spiked a temperature of 102.4, which was determined to be from atelectasis as his wounds looked and chest X-ray looked good.
Blood and urine cultures were subsequently negative.
He seemed to respond and his urine output was outstanding at over 100 cc/ hour.
He was assymptomatic, however an EKG showed A-flutter vs A-fibrillation.
On POD 2, he continued to require fluid boluses to keep his SBP above 90.
On POD 4, he was started on a regular diet which he tolerated well.
