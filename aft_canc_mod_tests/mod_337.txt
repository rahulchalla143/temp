MRI Head ([**1-24**]): TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.
Overall stable MRI appearance of the brain with redemonstration of posterior parietal and occipital lobe infarcts.
EEG ([**1-24**]): FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout this recording, the background rhythm  remained in the 5 to 6 Hz frequency range.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with average rate of 72 bpm.
Among the findings was an MRI that showed no focal findings, and an EEG that showed a toxic-metabolic picture.
She was also found to be hyponatremic on admission; all of these factors, along with her malnutrition in the setting of malignancy, likely contributed to her presentation.
The CXR showed findings c/w pulmonary edema, and the patient was felt by the ICU team to have developed flash pulmonary edema.
Her last Echo [**10-14**], showed a normal EF with some focal wall motion abnormalities.
EKG and cardiac enzymes were normal.
Her breathing remained stable on room air, and she was discharged on metoprolol and levo/flagyl with plan of a 10 day course.
