The increasing size and radiographic characteristics of the lesion suggested a cystic neoplasm rather than a pseudocyst and an endoscopic ultrasound with FNA biopsies was recently performed, which demonstrated adenocarcinoma rather than mucinous cystadenoma.
Local nodes obtained at the time were negative for malignancy, and the patient therefore presented to this institution for an elective pancreatectomy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99.1, blood pressure 105/58, pulse 99, respirations 20.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORIES:  The preoperative white blood cell count was 7.6 with a hematocrit of 40.6 and a platelet count of 296,000.
The postoperative white blood cell count was 23.9, with a hematocrit of 35.3, and a platelet count of 328,000.
On the evening of postoperative day two, the patient developed respiratory distress with oxygenation in the low 80s and respiratory rate to the 30s.
The post intubation chest x-ray demonstrated congestive heart failure which was treated with intravenous diuretics.
On postoperative day three, the patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 25.9%.
She also had an elevated temperature to 101.2 F along with a leukocytosis which is 28.5.
The white blood cell count subsequently decreased to 18.8.
Final pathology from her surgery was read as invasive pancreatic adenocarcinoma, T3 N0 MX.
