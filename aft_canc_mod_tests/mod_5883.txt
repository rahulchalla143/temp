The patient also states that she has felt "cold" for the past four days, with a temperature of up to 103 per patient report.
In the Emergency Department, the patient had a nasogastric lavage, which showed coffee grounds that cleared after one liter.
Her vitals there were a temperature of 98.1, pulse 106, blood pressure 182/81, and oxygen saturation of 92% on face mask.
HOCUM 4.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature afebrile, pulse 116, blood pressure 191/57, oxygen saturation 92% on nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination:  A small amount of dried crusted blood on lips.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation on the left, right side with significant decreased breath sounds throughout, with some inspiratory wheeze.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8.5, with a differential of 77.7 neutrophils, 0% bands, and 15.1% lymphocytes.
Hematocrit 35.6, platelets 218 .
Sodium 143, potassium 4.3, chloride 111, bicarbonate 22, BUN 21, creatinine 0.9, glucose 155.
PT 14, PTT 25, INR 1.3.
STUDIES:  Chest x-ray from [**2170-1-13**] showed right lower lobe and right upper lobe opacity which could represent atelectasis or consolidation.
Repeat nasogastric lavage was clear.
The patient received a chest CT, which was notable for a right lower lobe mass, read as concerning for malignancy vs pneumonia.
Endobronchial biopsy was performed, as well as lymph node sampling.
The patient's transbronchial biopsy results showed only inflammatory changes with atypia, and no signs of neoplasm.
Because the transbronchial biopsy is not always effective in picking up lesions, the patient will need to be rescanned within one month's time.
Chest x-ray showed a new left lower lobe process, consistent with effusion and potential mild congestive heart failure, and/or atelectasis.
The patient did not have any symptomatic improvement, nor did the chest x-ray change with the lasix.
The patient has been afebrile since admission, and her white blood cell count has decreased.
