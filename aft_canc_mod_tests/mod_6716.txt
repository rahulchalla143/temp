Admission Date: [**2129-1-7**]        Discharge Date: [**2129-1-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-8-14**]        Sex:  M  Service:  MED   CHIEF COMPLAINT: GI bleeding, AF c RVR, respiratory distress  MAJOR SURGICAL OR INVASIVE PROCEDURES: CVL [**2129-1-7**]; PICC [**2129-1-9**], [**2129-1-17**]; Paracentesis [**2129-1-13**].
He was initially triaged from MCI [**Location (un) 912**] to [**Hospital **] Hospital Emergency Room, and following initial evaluation there was subsequently transferred to the emergency room at [**Hospital1 **] Hospital with a concern for possible small bowel obstruction, as well as ongoing evidence of GI bleed.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 69**], the patient was noted to be hemodynamically stable with triage vital signs showing a blood pressure of 148/80, a heart rate of 92, a temperature of 97.1 orally, and a respiratory rate of 16, with an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.
Initial labs were notable for a hematocrit of 37.
He was seen by both Gastroenterology and Surgery, and a CT scan of his abdomen was obtained.
Examination of his chest revealed fine crackles at both bases.
His cardiac exam was notable for a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2.
he was alert and oriented x3 and his neurological examination was normal in detail.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory examination at the time of admission was notable for a sodium of 136, potassium of 3.7, chloride of 104, bicarb of 21, BUN of 16, and creatinine of 0.9, with a glucose of 131.
His alkaline phosphatase was mildly elevated at 126, the remainder of his LFTs were within normal limits.
His CBC revealed a white count of 13,000, and a hematocrit of 37% which dropped over the course of the next 24 hours to 33, and then nadir'd at 29%.
Platelets were 256 on admission and coags were normal.
In consultation with GI and Surgery, this was managed conservatively with antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and further examination for possible C. difficile infection or ongoing bowel ischemia, which was felt to be less likely.
He did not require transfusion and did not require colonoscopy or further invasive procedures to evaluate the course of his bleed, which resolved spontaneously.
His AF was eventually brought under control through initiation of Diltiazem first via drip, then via p.o.
The results of this included identification of both respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in his sputum, as well as gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters in his sputum.
An echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular cardiac function, mild mitral regurgitation and mildly elevated pulmonary arterial pressures.
Paracentesis on [**1-13**] was negative for any evidence of infection; his ascites was likely due to a combination of fluid overload in the setting of progressive right heart failure and underlying liver disease from hepatic congestion and HCV.
Given rising oxygen requirement over the course of [**1-9**]-26, a CT scan of the chest was obtained.
