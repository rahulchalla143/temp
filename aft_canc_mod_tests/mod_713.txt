On arrival, the patient had a cervical exam that was unfavorable and was given 1 dose of Pitocin.
At the time of the delivery, the patient had a blood loss of 450 cc and a small periurethral lac that was repaired with a 4-0 Vicryl.
At this time, a transabdominal ultrasound was performed which revealed a poorly defined endometrial stripe.
In light of the persistence of this postpartum hemorrhage with intermittent atony, the patient was recommended for dilation and curettage as well as exam under anesthesia to rule out retained products of conception.
Blood products infused at the time of surgery were 7units PRBC, 1 unit PLT, 2 FFPs, 1unit cryo.
MRI was ordered and was negative for stroke/brainstem injury.
Given demand ischemia in setting of intraoperative tachycardia, EKG was done and cardiac enzymes were cycled.
CK and troponin were found elevated.
Details of the echo results are available in the echo report.
