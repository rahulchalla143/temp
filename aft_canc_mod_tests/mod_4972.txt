A CT angiogram was performed to evaluate his aorta and iliac arteries, and a 2.7 cm lesion in the left lobe of the liver was noted incidentally.
An MRI on [**2148-5-23**] demonstrated a 2.6 x 3.1 x 2.4 cm lesion in segment 3/4A.
On [**2148-6-7**] a CT-guided biopsy of the lesion demonstrated hepatocellular carcinoma in the background of cirrhosis.
The patient underwent a preoperative cardiac evaluation.
During a myocardial stress test with nuclear imaging on [**2148-6-26**], he was noted to have 0.5 to [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in leads V5 and V6.
The IV dipyridamole stress test was negative for chest pain and the nuclear imaging demonstrated a large size, moderate intensity, anterior wall, septal wall, apex and inferior wall perfusion abnormality, with mild to moderate improvement on resting images involving the mid septal and basilar inferolateral walls.
The left ventricular ejection fraction was 37% post stress and 47% at stress.
These were all new since the prior scan in 08/[**2143**].
He underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated a right dominant system.
The left circumflex demonstrated a 70%, ostial stenosis and there was a large obtuse marginal 2 branch which had 80% stenosis.
He had an ejection fraction of 48%.
He did undergo a follow- up CT scan on [**2148-8-21**] that demonstrated an unchanged size of the 3 cm, biopsy-proven, hepatocellular carcinoma in segments 2/4A.
There was an additional, nonspecific, arterial-enhancing, 4 mm lesion of the dome of the liver that is likely focal vascular shunt, but will be assessed at the time of surgery with intraoperative ultrasound.
