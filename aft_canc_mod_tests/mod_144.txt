IMAGING: CXR Portable ([**9-11**]): IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for left lower lobe pneumonia.
CXR Portable ([**9-11**]): FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of a right IJ intravenous catheter with its tip projecting over the expected location of the lower SVC.
ECG ([**9-12**]): Sinus rhythm at a rate of 62 with prolonged P-R interval to 224.
CT Head ([**9-12**]): There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Evaluation with MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4639**]n-weighted sequence is recommended.
TTE ([**9-12**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**9-12**]): Left basilar atelectasis is again noted.
Evaluation of the bowel reveals mural thickening involving the sigmoid colon as well as a portion of the rectum.
In retrospect on the prior exam dated [**2134-9-12**], there is suggestion of distal sigmoid and rectal wall thickening to suggest chronicity _____ recurrence of this disease process.
Of note, this similar though less diffuse findings were identified on a prior CT scan dated [**2134-9-12**].
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]/MRA Brain ([**9-13**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CT abdomen/pelvis showed sigmoid and rectal thickening which is a nonspecific finding and may represent infectious or inflammatory etiologies as well as ischemia.
Serial exams showed a soft abdomen.
Stools were negative for C. difficile x2 and O&P x2.
She went for flexible sigmoidoscopy on [**9-14**] which showed erythema and edema in the mid-sigmoid colon and distal sigmoid colon compatible with colitis, and a polyp in the mid-descending colon which was not removed since the patient was on heparin SQ.
The patient was scheduled for a screening colonoscopy on [**11-6**] at which point the very small polyp, and any others can be removed.
# Hypotension: On admission, the patient's blood pressure was 113/44, then decreased to 81/38 in the ED.
A right IJ was placed, and the patient was transferred to the MICU with concern for pneumonia or UTI sepsis.
The MICU team reported that non-invasive BPs were 20 points below the arterial values.
TTE showed mild symmetric LVH, LVEF 60-65%, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x4.
Head CT showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage but did show a new and more conspicuous area of left frontal hypodensity, which may represent acute infarction.
Neurology was consulted, and they did not believe that the head CT findings were consistent with her presentation with bilateral upper extremity weakness.
MRI head/MRA brain showed no acute infarct, and FLAIR hyperintense foci were consistent with chronic microvascular infarcts in the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres.
Lactate was 3.4.
CXR was concerning for left lower lobe pneumonia.
Blood cultures were negative, and urine legionella antigen was negative.
UA showed positive nitrite, trace leukocytosis, [**2-6**] WBC, and moderate bacteria.
Urine culture showed fecal contamination, and the patient has a history of fecal incontinence.
# Hyperlipidemia: Lipid panel during this admission showed Chol 160, TG 182, HDL 36, and LDL 88.

Abdominal Pain, Diarrhea 2.
Fecal Incontinence 6.
You then underwent a CAT scan of your abdomen and a flex sig of your intestines.
Please have a repeat colonoscopy in several months/years as an outpatient.
