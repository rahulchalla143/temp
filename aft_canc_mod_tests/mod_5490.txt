Sepsis/hypotension:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] came to a clinic appointment on [**5-28**] and was found to have a BP of 72/50.
In the ED she was given an additional 4L with minimal response in BP and was found to be febrile to 101 rectally.
While in the unit she was afebrile and her blood pressures remained stable (110s/60s).
A UA and CXR were negative and it was felt that the likely etiology of her fever was an infectious process around her left axillary mass.
Her foley was d/c'd as she had good urine output and her IJ was d/c'd to prevent infection.
Blood and urine cultures have remained negative during her hospitalization.
A cortisol stim test done in the MICU showed inadequate response (13.4 to 19.5).
Anemia: Ms. [**Known lastname 54886**] baseline hct at [**Hospital1 18**] had been in the mid to upper 20s.
The patient's hematocrit has remained stable since that time and no additional transfusions were needed.
Pain control: She was maintained on fentanyl patch for comfort/pain despite the fact that it can lead to lower BPs, as well as methadone per outpatient doses.
She had a bone marrow biopsy to work this up in the past which showed a leukemoid reaction.
