It was also recommended that she receive her study drug under observation such as in the infusion clnic to monitor for possible reaction.
Tryptase was sent to evaluate for C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency and is still pending.
Home metoprolol was continued at 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 5mg daily started to help better control BP, as she had SBP 150-160s.
It is possible that this was from your study medication or it may have been due to the blood pressure medication Lisinopril that you had been taking.
