911 was called and he was brought to [**Hospital3 **], where a CT scan of the head revealed 1.7 cm R frontal hemorrhage and 3.9 cm L fronto-parietal hemorrhage with associated edema with local effacement of sulci without midline shift.
He received 10 mg of IV dexamethasone and 250 mg of Phenytoin and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval.
MRI [**2196-7-19**] showed 3 lesions - 2 in the left parietal and 1 in the right frontal regions.
A repeat MRI on [**8-3**] showed slight increase in the size of both tumors, and a third MRI [**9-5**] showed a new right parietal metastasis.

Pertinent Results: MRI HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2196-9-25**]: FINDINGS: The study is compared with very recent enhanced MR examination (with tumor volumetry) of [**2196-9-5**].
CT Torso [**2196-9-26**]: CT CHEST: Left axillary dissection changes are stable.
CT ABDOMEN: A 1 cm liver lesion in segment VII (2:42) enhances similar to the blood pool and are probably present since [**2195-9-27**].
CT PELVIS: The bladder, rectum, prostate, and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.
Segment VII liver lesion likely represents flash filling hemangioma given similar enhancement to blood pool, but is not fully characterized.
MRI suggested for more definitive characterization given history of malignancy.
MRI Head [**9-28**](post-op): FINDINGS: There is a new left parietal/temporal craniotomy, with associated post-operative changes in the overlying scalp.
An apparent 5 mm focus of slow diffusion along the anterolateral margin of the new resection cavity (image 12 of series 700 and series 702), most likely represents an artifact related to the post-operative blood products, although a small contusion or infarction of adjacent tissue cannot be excluded.
MRI Abdomen [**9-29**]: There is minimal dependent atelectasis at the right lung base.
There is a subcapsular lesion measuring 10 x 10 mm in segment VIII of the liver, corresponding to the enhancing abnormality on prior CT, which demonstrates uniform high signal on T2- weighted images, low signal on T1- weighted sequences and arterial phase hyperenhancement with continued enhancement on the dynamic series.
There are again demonstrated peripancreatic fluid collections which have high signal on T1-weighted sequences, low signal on T2-weighted sequences and demonstrate subtle rim enhancement suggestive of focal collections with hemorrhagic or proteinaceous contents.
An MRI Scan performed upon admission demonstrated 3 brain lesions, either hemorrhagic or increased size of tumors.
An MRI of the Head and Abdomen were ordered d/t concerning findings of a Segment VII liver lesion per CT Scan.
This MRI revealed mutliple small cysts that did not required acute intervention per the GI team.
?You will need an MRI of the brain on [**2196-10-13**] 12:20  You also have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**] on [**2196-10-19**] at 9:45am  During your hospitalization and imaging performed; multiple small cysts were identified on your liver.
