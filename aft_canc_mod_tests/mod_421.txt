On admission her CXR was significant for right sided pneumonitis.
At that point she had CT chest which showed dense consolidation of RUL with b/l ground glass air space disease throughout both lobes.
She underwent renal U/S at OSH which was negative.
Also during admission at OSH patient found to have 7mm left posterior parietal hemorrhage on head CT without mass effect.
She was seen by neurosurgery at OSH who felt hemorrhage unlikely after repeat head CT showed no change in mass.

Possible mediastinal lymphadenopathy - recommend Chest CT for further evaluation on a nonemergent basis.
In a patient with HIV, meningitis is not excluded and correlation with lumbar puncture is recommended.
Also, contrast enhanced study could be performed if patient's renal function improves, or hemodialysis can be arranged.
A hemorrhage in this area is not entirely excluded, and short interval followup with non-contrast CT was recommended.
[**2125-2-12**] CXR: Cardiac size is top normal.
An encephalopathic picture may result from infections, toxic metabolic abnormalities or medication effect.
[**2125-2-14**] CT HEAD: 1.
[**2125-2-15**] SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.
[**2125-2-18**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1.
[**2125-2-18**] CT HEAD: 1.
No significant change from most recent CT examination; however, current examination is limited due to motion artifact.
Bronchoscopy here with sputum negative for PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 11381**] negative x 3, urine legionella antigen negative, and viral screen negative.
Swallow evaluation was done during her admission due to her poor mental status and showed no evidence of aspiration.
Work-up was otherwise negative, including CT abd, CT head to reevaluate for progressive sinusitis, and repeat cultures.
The tip culture was negative.
# Abnormal MRI:  MRI done for altered mental status while in the ICU showed an abnormal FLAIR sulcal hyperintensity and an occipital density, thought to be a meningioma.
They suspect the occipital lesion is a meningioma given it is stable compared to a prior MRI in [**7-26**].
A repeat LP was done to send CSF for flow.
Creatinine improved to 2.0 by the time of discharge.
Repeat CD4 and HIV viral load sent prior to discharge.
EEG showed no evidence for seizures.
