In the work-up for the anemia, he was found to have a large gastric mass on EGD [**9-11**], which was not biopsied at the time of the inital study because the lesion was friable and his Hct was unstable.
He was transferred to the medical service for further workup of his gastric mass and multiple medical comorbidities.

CT chest [**9-14**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
New bilateral moderate pleural effusions obscure evaluation of previously identified right lower lobe opacity and further characterization is not possible at this time.
male with AAA, anemia and large gastric [**Hospital **] transferred to the MICU [**9-16**] for acute onset SOB, felt likely [**1-29**] vocal cord spasm.
#) Gastric Mass / Liver Lesions / Pulmonary Lesion: pt underwent biopsy of GI mas on [**9-14**] while on surgical service, diagnostic for gastric cancer, which showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring features.
CT C/A/P with hypodensities in liver, kidney, and adrenals, though not reported as metastasis at this time.
#) Anemia: baseline hct ~30,  some chronic component most likely 2/2 blood losses from the gastric mass; pt with acute bleeding after biopsy of gastric mass (hct down to 18) requiring 5U PRBC on [**9-10**] while in CSRU, stable Hct and vitals after transfusion s/p biopsy.
HCT remained stable for remainder of hospital course without additional transfusion with HCT ~30 again.
response to recent EGD instrumentation vs. traumatic foley insertion vs. reaction to blood transfusion (saw in note that there was some question of reaction on [**9-10**] and blood bank w/u initiated) vs. C. diff colitis vs. viral gastroenteritis vs. GI upset from unknown source.
# acute SOB: no history of lung disease, no CHF history, 65 pky smoking history with emphysema on imaging, was transferred from medicine floor to MICU on [**9-16**] for acute episodes of SOB and hypoxemia x2.
First SOB episode was at 3 pm earlier [**9-16**], SBP 170s, 100% 2L nc was switched to 100% NRB, patient was using accessory muscles with labored breathing, but could clearly state that he was having a hard time breathing.
At 6 pm, he had a second SOB episode, BP 176/111, HR 118, 100% 2L nc was switched to 100% NRB with ABG 7.31/39/64.
cardiac enzymes mildly elevated felt [**1-29**] mild elevation in creatinine.
You will also need to coordinate with the surgical oncology team for an exploratory laparotomy as an outpatient to further workup your gastric malignancy.
