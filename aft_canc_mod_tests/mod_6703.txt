Video Swallow Evaluation ([**2126-12-20**])  - ORAL PHASE: Oral phase was for the boluses given.
Propulsion of the thin and thick barium were reduced with significant retention.
- SUMMARY: The exam today confirmed the trace amount of a leak seen at the bedside yesterday and earlier today on exam, but this is likely accounted for by recent placement of the TEP and no liquid was entering the airway.
Speech and swallow performed a bedside evaluation that revealed a small fluid leak around the prosthesis but no other obvious fistulas.
A video swallow confirmed these findings.
ENT performed a laryngoscopy which revealed crusting of the trachea down to the mainstem bronchi.
