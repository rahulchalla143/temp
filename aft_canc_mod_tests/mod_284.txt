The patient presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion over the past two weeks and an oxygen saturation in the 80s on the day of admission at his oncologist's office.
Prior oxygen saturation in [**Month (only) **] had been 99%.
As noted, a chest x-ray in [**2142-3-29**] showed hilar lymphadenopathy and a bronchoscopy with biopsy showed metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
The patient went to his oncologist on [**6-11**] for an appointment and had low oxygen saturations to 83% and was sent to the Emergency Department.
In the Emergency Department, the patient responded to 3 liters of oxygen with oxygen saturations coming up to 92% but had an increasing oxygen requirement.
An arterial blood gas at that time revealed pH was 7.56, PCO2 was 38, and PO2 was 38.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation.
The chest x-ray on admission was consistent with congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Coronary artery disease with a myocardial infarction in [**2108**] and a normal echocardiogram in [**2138**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed temperature was 96.3, heart rate was 76, blood pressure was 190/80, the respiratory rate was 21, and the oxygen saturation was 80% to 92% on a 100% nonrebreather mask.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Pulmonary examination revealed the patient's lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally/anteriorly.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Extremity examination revealed no edema.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
Neurologic examination revealed no gross deficits.
Skin examination revealed multiple psoriatic plaques on the scalp.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on admission revealed white blood cell count was 8, hematocrit was 38, and platelets were 280.
Sodium was 139, potassium was 3.9, chloride was 92, bicarbonate was increased at 35, blood urea nitrogen was 34, creatinine was 7.2, and blood glucose was 111.
Arterial blood gas initially revealed pH was 7.56, PCO2 was 38, and PO2 was 38.
Arterial blood gas then improved to a pH of 7.42, PCO2 of 43, and PO2 of 62; this was on 100% nonrebreather mask.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray from [**6-11**] showed bulky lymphadenopathy with diffuse reticular nodular pattern and bilateral pleural effusions; consistent with congestive heart failure and metastatic disease.
Electrocardiogram was compared with [**2139-11-30**] with a rate of 75, normal sinus, left axis deviation, and normal intervals.
Just noting a computed tomography scan from [**6-8**], prior to admission, showed extensive mediastinal adenopathy with a node as large as 3.3 cm X 2.9 cm (which has increased in size).
HYPOXIA ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with hypoxia with an oxygen requirement, but his saturations improved on 100% nonrebreather mask to the 90s.
His saturations dropped, but when he coughed his saturations would improve.
However, on day two of admission the patient was sent for a computed tomography angiogram to rule out a pulmonary embolism.
Those two medications were held in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, and he was dialyzed again with a low bicarbonate solution, and his bicarbonate resolved down to 27 after that.
twice per day; however, this was not sufficient overnight, and the patient was placed on hydralazine 20 mg intravenously every six hours for blood pressure maintenance which worked well.
A recent echocardiogram from [**2138**] showed a preserved ejection fraction and left ventricular function.
The patient did have a small troponin leak by enzymes at approximately 0.2, but his creatine kinase levels were flat at around 50 to 60.
We had a low suspicion that the patient had a cardiac event and thought that this was more likely due to his respiratory distress and his end-stage renal disease.
However, the patient received another echocardiogram with a bubble study.
This echocardiogram on [**6-12**] showed a small right-to-left shunt across the atrium, left ventricular function was preserved and normal size, normal ejection fraction of greater than 55%, mild aortic regurgitation, and mild mitral regurgitation.
