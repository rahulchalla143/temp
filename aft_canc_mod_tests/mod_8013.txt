He had an echocardiogram performed there that showed decreased right ventricular function.
A chest x-ray was negative for congestive heart failure.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's temperature is 97.6 with a pulse of 90.
Respiratory rate 28.
Blood pressure 94/51.
Oxygen saturation of 91% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
On general examination the patient was a very ill appearing male in no acute distress, alert and oriented times three.
Neck examination revealed CVP of about 12 cm of water.
Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2.
Pulmonary examination revealed long E time, otherwise lungs that had decreased breath sounds at the bases left greater then right.
On abdominal examination the patient had slight tenderness in the left lower quadrant without rebound or guarding.
Extremity examination revealed 2+ edema with a right lower extremity having some erythema and warmth and multiple ecchymosis petechia and purpura all over his extremities from previous blood draws.
Neurological examination revealed the patient was alert and oriented times three.
Ileostomy looked pink and healthy with guaiac negative output.
PERTINENT LABORATORIES:  The patient had a white blood cell count of 23, hematocrit 30.5, platelets of 62.
Chem 7 revealed sodium of 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 98, bicarb of 34, BUN 37, creatinine 1.0 and glucose of 68.
The patient had a reticulocyte count of 7.1.
His iron saturation was less then 30%.
He had an LDH of 768 with a total bilirubin of 2.9 and an indirect bilirubin of 2.1.
His Cortisol was within normal limits as well as his TSH.
Calcium was 9.5, magnesium was 2.0 and phos 2.8.
PERTINENT PAST DATA:  The patient had an echocardiogram performed at his last admission with an EF of 75 to 80%, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension.
The patient had an upper gastrointestinal series, which showed massive spleen and inflammatory changes to the small bowel in [**2105-2-14**].
The patient had an abdominal ultrasound on [**2105-2-14**], which showed massive spleen, dilated portal veins and normal flow.
The patient had a chest x-ray at the outside hospital, which showed bilateral basilar infiltrates and effusions left greater then right.
Pulmonary:  The patient was transferred for further evaluation of his declining pulmonary status.
His clinical examination and repeat echocardiogram showed severe and progressive cor pulmonale likely secondary to severe pulmonary hypertension from pulmonary parenchymal disease.
An echocardiogram did not reveal any left ventricular component to suggest congestive heart failure, although he did hve very severe right ventricular dysfunction.
The patient had a CT scan performed, which showed endobronchial filling defect with question of tumor versus mucous impaction.
CT angiogram was performed, which did not reveal any evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Sputum culture gram stain cytology were sent and were pending at the time of this summary.
A bronchoscopy was tentatively scheduled to achieve a definitive diagnosis for an endobronchial mass.
Echocardiogram revealed no evidence of left ventricular dysfunction, although the possibility of diastolic dysfunction was entertained.
All cultures were negative at the time of this summary.
Hematology/oncology:  The patient started off with a white blood cell count of 20, which increased to 50 then to 70 then to 100 and then to 220,000.
Peripheral blood smear showed almost all lymphocytes.
On the final day of the patient's admission hematology oncology felt that the patient's CLL was progressing at a rapid rate and that he was unlikely to be treated given his other comorbidity conditions.
Renal:  The patient developed acute renal insufficiency in the setting of hypotension, hypovolemia and contrast from the CT angio.
