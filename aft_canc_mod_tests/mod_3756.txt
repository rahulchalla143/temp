A CT scan on [**2125-3-2**] at [**Hospital1 18**] confirmed a cecal mass and lymphadenopathy, as well as multiple hepatic lesions in both lobes of the liver.
He was then treated with a course of FOLFOX and Avastin chemotherapy, to which he responded quite well.
Serial CT scans demonstrated that there was a decrease in the size of multiple liver lesions with no new hepatic lesions and a decrease in the prominence of the cecal mass.
Embolization of the right portal vein was performed on [**2125-8-10**] and serial CT scans were also followed to calculate liver volumes.
The most recent study, performed on [**9-7**], demonstrated that the total liver volume was not significantly changed form prior studies at 1735 cc.
Blood transfusion early in [**2125**] for low hematocrit.
Physical Exam: Upon morning of discharge: Vitals: Tm 99.9   Tc 99.8   P 93   BP 98/75-111/77   RR 20 SpO2 98%RA General: AAOx3.
Pertinent Results: Upon admission: [**2125-10-1**] WBC-4.7 Hgb-12.0 Hct-33.6 Plt Ct-86 PT-17.5 PTT-59.7 INR-1.6 Fibrino-138 Glucose-129 UreaN-8 Creat-0.9 Na-137 K-5.1 Cl-108 HCO3-23 ALT-504 AST-470 LDH-646 AlkPhos-36 TotBili-1.5 DirBili-0.6 IndBili-0.9 Lipase-17 Albumin-2.0 Calcium-9.7 Phos-4.5 Mg-2.2 Lactate-1.6  Upon discharge: [**2125-10-10**] WBC-6.9 Hgb-10.5 Hct-30.8 Plt Ct-85 Glucose-91 UreaN-9 Creat-0.9 Na-137 K-3.7 Cl-107 HCO3-23 ALT-95 AST-46 AlkPhos-250 Amylase-1278 TotBili-1.2 Lipase-1870 Albumin-2.7* Calcium-7.9 Phos-3.3 Mg-2.3   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted on [**2125-10-1**] for the planned resection of the hepatic metastatic lesions.
The lateral drain was also noted to be bilious on postoperative day #6, confirmed with lab analysis of the drain output showing a bilirubin of 28.6.
The medial drain continued to be serosanguinous and had a bilirubin of 0.7.
An ERCP was performed on postoperative day #8, which showed contrast extravasation from left intrahepatic biliary duct branches at the site of resection.
The his amylase and lipase were markedly elevated postprocedure, the patient was completely asymptomatic.
He was therefore sent home with a weeks worth of acetazolamide, 250mg orally twice daily, while monitoring his weight at home.
Also of note, the patient's pathology was returned, which showed that an omental biopsy was positive for adenocarcinoma, a poor prognostic sign.
Carcinomatosis confirmed by omental biopsy positive for adenocarcinoma.
