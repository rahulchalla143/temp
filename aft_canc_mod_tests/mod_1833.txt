There, pt was found to have bilateral PEs that appear old (s/p anticoagulation, stopped several months ago) and a 2.5 cm circumferential pericardial effusion on CT. Pt had low blood pressure at OSH but responded to fluids.
Of note, PET CT in [**12/2189**] showed recurrence of RA mass.
Pt was hemodynamically stable and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.
In our ED, initial VS were T 98.5 HR 64 BP 114/68 RR 18 O2 sat 95%.
An EKG showed NSR 73, low voltage, no ST changes.
Labs were remarkable for normal WBC, plts for 67, Hct 34.
Chem was wnl, INR 1.6.
A bedside US showed a large pericardial effusion with RV bowing without tamponade physiology and pulsus paradoxus measured 14.
CXR showed a moderate pericardial effusion and metastatic pulmonary nodules.
TTE showed a large right atrial mass extending into the right ventricle and a large circumferential pericardial effusion with brief right ventricular diastolic collapse.
Past Medical History: # HCC - has a history of hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by grade II-III varices - initial surveillance CT performed at an outside hospital in [**9-/2186**] showed a 5-cm mass in the left liver as well as multiple satellite lesions.
AFP on [**2187-11-14**] was greater than 100,000 ng/mL.
- at [**Hospital1 18**] CT on [**2187-12-6**] showed a 9 x 6 cm enhancing mass in the left liver as well as innumerable pulmonary nodules, the largest measuring  9-10 mm.
AFP was >600,000ng/mL.
However, further imaging showed improved in infiltrating liver process and AFP decreased to 2177ng/mL on [**2188-2-25**].
- He was hospitalized in [**3-/2188**] with upper GI bleed, and echocardiogram during that hospitalization diagnosed a right atrial mass.
[**2189-3-13**] Exploratory laparotomy, mobilization of the liver, mobilization inferior vena cava, inflow occlusion.
Physical Exam: ON ADMISSION: VS: BP 114/60  HR 67  RR 17  O2 sat 98% on 3L NC GENERAL: chronically ill-appearing male, NAD.
