Liver US on POD#0 revealed patent hepatic vasculature, with no perihepatic fluid collections and 90cm/sec velocity in the donor main portal vein.
The patient was extubated following arrival to ICU and immunosuppression was initiated per protocol - FK 2mg daily, MMF 2g daily, and a steroid taper.
JP drain output was sero-sanginous and T-tube output bilious.
A CXR revealed low lung volumes, but aside from mild atelectasis at the left base, was essentially clear.
Repeat xray demonstrated persistent small-to-moderate right pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
Chest PT was initiated at this time, as well as aggressive pulmonary toilet.
An ECHO was obtained on [**9-19**], with no significant intrapulmonary shunting, but symmetric LVH.
As a result, CT chest was obtained on [**9-18**], which revealed an interval slight increase in moderate/large right pleural effusion.
A CT chest was then completed which revealed atelectasis and/or pneumonic consolidation in the right lower lobe, with new multifocal ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes.
The patient received a bronchoscopy on [**9-20**], which revealed small amount of mucoid secretions.
During the procedure, BAL was obtained for fungal, viral and bacterial cultures with an immunocompromised protocol.
Per ID recommendations, the patient was placed on ciprofloxacin, bactrim, fluconazole, levofloxacin, zosyn, and vancomycin while cultures were pending.
FK level was 12.1 on [**2171-9-26**] and the patient was given Tacrolimus 1mg po bid.
