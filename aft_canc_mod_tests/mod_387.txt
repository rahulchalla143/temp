He went to [**Hospital6 4287**] where he underwent a CT of the head which revealed a left parietal-occipital lytic lesion with edema.
Chest x-ray showed evidence of lung mass.
He received Decadron 10mg IV x1 and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up.

Differential considerations include infectious and neoplastic etiologies.
MR w/ gadolinium recommended for further assessment  -Vasogenic edema surrounding masses causing mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle.
-------------------- MRI head IMPRESSION:  Three cystic lesions are identified within the left parietal and occipital lobes with peripheral rim enhancement and no slow diffusion within the cystic portion of the lesions.
CT torso IMPRESSION:  1.
Consider bronchoscopic biopsy of the right hilar mass for histologic evaluation.
Multiple conspicuous mediastinal lymph nodes as described, although are not pathologically enlarged by CT criteria, are suspicious due their number.
[**2111-8-13**] head MRI post-op IMPRESSION:  Evacuation of the lower portion of the cystic mass with post-surgical changes including blood products and pneumocephalus.
CT torso also support left adrenal mass, consistent with  diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer.
