A CT scan at that time revealed a left renal mass with apparent tumor thrombus in the left renal vein.
A subsequent magnetic resonance imaging scan confirmed this finding and also noted that this mass extended into the vena cava.
A CT of the head and lungs, as well as a bone scan, did not demonstrate any obvious metastatic disease; however, there were several lung nodules which were not definitely excluded as representative of metastatic disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**2102-11-23**] and underwent an uncomplicated preoperative embolization of the left renal artery in the Interventional Radiology suite.
The patient's postoperative course was relatively uneventful with the exception of a transient elevation of her bilirubin thought to be secondary to a transfusion reaction from the 8 units of packed red blood cells that she received during the operative procedure.
Her bilirubin continued to normalize, reaching a level of 2.7 from a high of 7.5 on the day of discharge.
Her alkaline phosphatase, however, was slightly increased; again, thought to be secondary to transfusion reaction.
Amylase and lipase remained normal.
The patient's urine output throughout her postoperative course was excellent.
