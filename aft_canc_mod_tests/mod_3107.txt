MRI showed a large mass at C-4 (mass was initially seen on [**2112-9-29**], but was not causing symptoms at that time).
Chest x-ray showed patchiness at bases consistent with aspiration.
CT of chest was obtained which showed fatty infiltration of the liver with multiple lesions, largest 2.7 cm, no pulmonary embolus, bilateral consolidation in the lower lobes, severe calcification of the coronary arteries consistent with coronary artery disease.
On [**10-20**] a swallow study showed high aspiration risk.
On [**2112-10-23**] he was found tachycardiac and unresponsive with respiratory rate of 5, systolic blood pressure in the 80s.
Arterial blood gas was 6.99/138/197.
He was hypernatremic with sodium of 155.
Sodium was 145 on [**2112-10-25**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On [**2112-10-25**] temperature max equals temperature current equals 101.6; pulse 102 to 122, currently 102; blood pressure 130 to 174 over 72 to 90; respiratory rate 22 to 31; O2 saturation 92% to 98% on 4 liters O2 nasal cannula.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly.

On [**10-12**] WBC 9.4, hematocrit 34.7.
Platelets 221 on [**2112-10-27**].
On [**2112-10-23**] PT 14.0, PTT 23.4, INR 1.4.
On [**2112-10-13**] PT 13.6, PTT 23.7, INR 1.3; platelets 367.
On [**2112-10-27**] sodium 139, K 3.7, Cl 105, CO2 24, BUN 7, creatinine 0.4, glucose 259.
On [**2112-10-12**] sodium 139, K 5.0, Cl 101, CO2 27, BUN 23, creatinine 1.0.
Cardiac enzymes, CPK drawn on [**2112-10-23**] and [**2112-10-24**] was 57, 46, 49.
Troponin was less than 0.3.
On [**2112-10-26**] calcium 7.3, phosphate 3.0, magnesium 1.6.
Microbiology data included blood culture [**2112-10-25**] anaerobic bottle with gram positive cocci, aerobic bottle with coagulase negative Staphylococcus.
On [**2112-10-24**] blood culture no growth to date as of [**2112-10-27**].
Sputum culture [**2112-10-23**] positive for yeast, but appears to be contaminant.
On [**2112-10-20**] blood culture no growth as of [**2112-10-27**].
Significant imaging studies included on [**2112-10-13**] cervical spine x-rays showed complete destruction of the C-4 vertebral body, marked prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
CT of chest [**2112-10-19**] showed fatty infiltration of liver with some round, relatively hyperdense lesions within it.
Chest x-ray [**2112-10-19**] at lung bases bilaterally there are patchy opacities which are new in comparison with the prior study, question aspiration.
Chest x-ray [**2112-10-20**] in the interval there has been resolution of the previously visible right middle lobe and left lower lobe opacities, however, plate-like atelectasis persists at the bases.
Chest x-ray [**2112-10-25**] there is again evidence of patchy atelectasis at the left lung base and minimal atelectatic changes may also be present in the right lower lobe.
As of [**2112-10-27**] WBC count had fallen from 23.2 on [**2112-10-25**] to 14.6 on [**2112-10-27**].
Patient failed a repeat swallow study on [**2112-10-26**] and had severe aspiration of both thin and thick liquids.
Patient had blood sugars covered with insulin sliding scale while not taking oral intake.
