At that time, a head computed tomography was reported as normal.
His systolic blood pressure at that time ranged between 120 and 200s.
A repeat head CT was reported to be normal.
A lumbar puncture was performed on [**8-20**] at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital and showed normal values.
A MRI with diffusion- weighted imaging showed diffuse hyperintensity in the cerebral cortex (R > L) and both thalami.
At this point, the patient remained intubated and unresponsive and was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care.
A bone marrow biopsy was done in [**2106-8-11**] which showed no bone marrow involvement.
Most recent surveillance computed tomography scan revealed gradual interval progression of Hodgkin's disease with slightly large mediastinal lymph nodes.
A repeat LP on admission showed normal cells, glucose and protein.
A CSF sample was also obtained for viral cultures and different viral and fungal Ab titers (including West Nile Virus, Arboviruses, HSV, HBVs).
Routine cultures for bacterial, TB and other infectious agents were also normal.
The Pentobarbital infusion was titrated to obtain a burst- suppression pattern on bedside 24 h, EEG monitoring.
In particular, the EEG showed sharp waves complexes every 6 to 10 seconds.
Mr [**Known lastname **] condition did not improve and another magnetic resonance imaging examination ([**8-24**]) showed multicentric areas of T2 hyperintensity with more concentration in the right frontal as well as bilateral thalami.
A brain and meningeal biopsy was performed on [**8-24**] in the right frontal lobe.
All the tests performed on his tissues and fuids obtained under request of the ID team, had thus far come back normal.
Brain and meningeal biopsy were remarkable for an meningitic eosinophilic infiltrates and extensive ischemic cortical neuronal damage (red neurons).
