CT torso was completed without evidence of intraabdominal abscess.
An infectious cuase for the hypotension was never identified by culture or by serology.
Additionally, A workup was also completed including [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, and anti-cardiolipin out of concern for underlying autoimmune process that could explain the etiology of his fevers.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
Reticulocyte count was low.
His counts remained low throughout the hospital course and his WBC count continued to flucuated.
He had a BM biopsy prior to discharge and his last ANC was 790.
A skin biopsy was sent which was consistent with neutrophilic dermatosis.
Corticosteroid treatment was not initiated until multiple imaging studies confirmed that there was no infectious process or abscess in his abdomen after his recent surgery.
A bronchoscopy was also preformed after a CT revealed multiple opacities.
Subsequently, the BAL was only positive for yeast which was thought to be a non-pathological.
A non-contrast CT of the lungs demonstrated improvement of his multi-focal opacities, his skin lesions continue to heal, and he has been afebrile since the initiation of steroids.
Urine osms were consistenly elevated relative to [**Name2 (NI) **] osms.
His sodium level stabilized and he was no longer fluid restricted.
- Please keep blood glucose less than 180's.
It was believed to be sensorineural, and an audiology test confirmed the hearing loss in his R ear.
He had an MRI of the pelvis and legs which demonstrated AVN.
You also had numerous imaging studies which did not reveal an infectious collection of fluid.
After the biopsy results returned, you were started on steroids.
