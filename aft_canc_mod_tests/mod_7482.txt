CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis ([**2109-2-12**]): 1.
Paracentesis ([**2109-2-14**]): Technically successful ultrasound-guided diagnostic paracentesis Preliminary Reportwith 850 mL of clear serous fluid removed.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for [**Month/Day/Year **]: 58 year old F with Multiple Sclerosis with repeated admissions this month for AMS who was admitted to [**Location **] [**2-6**] for confusion after a fall and found to have UTI and bilateral DVTs transferred for continuous EEG monitoring d/t continued AMS found to have widespread ovarian cancer.
# AMS/Delirium: Likely toxic metabolic encephalopathy given marked improvement with antibiotics and EEG consistent with generalized encephalopathy and no e/o seizure or epileptiform activity.
CSF showed Tot Protein 47, Glucose 63, RBC 2140 (Tube 1), RBC 20 (Tube 4), likely representative of a traumatic tap.
HSV PCR and Cryptococcal antigen were negative.
Bacterial cultures were negative and antibiotics were narrowed and acyclovir was discontinued.
MRI was also performed at [**Hospital3 2568**] and showed periventricular [**Known lastname **] matter changes consistent with MS. On the floor her mental status rapidly improved, though she contined to wax and wane with occasional hallucinations and inappropriate responses to questioning, intersperced with periods of lucidity consistent with delerium.
RPR was negative and TFTs were normal.
CT C/A/P was performed due to concern for malignancy or IVC clot and showed a large pelvic mass with widespread peritoneal metastases consistent with advanced ovarian cancer.
# Ovarian Cancer: Large pelvic mass with associated ascites, omental caking peritoneal seeding and pleural effusion were seen on CT scan.
Ultrasound guided paracentesis was performed and cells were sent for cytology.
Cytology showed adenocarcinoma and Heme/Onc was consulted.
Final staining for pathology is pending at discharge.
For this she was transfused 1U pRBCs with appropriate response in her HCT from 23->28.
Her HCT remained stable for the remainder of her hospital course.
At [**Hospital1 18**] she was given Ceftriaxone; urine culture grew enterococcus sensitive to Ampicillin and Ceftriacxone was stopped and she was given a 7d course of Ampicillin.
CT C/A/P was then performed and showed a large pelvic mass compressing the bilateral ureters and mild bilateral hydronephrosis.
Her Cr and electrolytes were monitored and her Cr remained stable (1.2-1.3) throughout her course.
