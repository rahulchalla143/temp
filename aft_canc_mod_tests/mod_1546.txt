Follow up scans in [**2142-1-4**], revealed the left lower lobe lung nodule and a right upper lobe nodule with growth on follow up scans.
In [**2142-5-4**], he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] VATS of the lung nodule with pathology revealing lymphomatoid granulomatosis which was followed with close observation.
Follow up scans showed further progression and he began high dose IL-2 on [**2147-5-15**].
Vital signs: Temperature 95.8, pulse 112, respirations 20, blood pressure 155/91, O2 saturation 100% on room air.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission labs - WBC 9.9, hemoglobin 11.9, hematocrit 34.8, platelet count 304,000.
INR 1.2.
BUN 18, creatinine 1.1, sodium 136, potassium 4.7, chloride 105, CO2 22, albumin 3.4, calcium 8.7, phosphorus 3.4, magnesium 1.9, ALT 33, AST 24.
CK 21.
Total bilirubin 1.5.
His admission weight was 107.7 kg.
Repeat bicarbonate was 21 and he was dosed with his last dose of IL-2 on treatment day #5.
In the afternoon of treatment day #5, the patient became hypotensive with blood pressure in the 60s with pressors initiated.
His pressor requirement was dopamine 6 mcg per kilogram per minute and 3 mcg per kilogram per minute of Neo-Synephrine with blood pressure remaining in the 80/60 range.
At 9:30 p.m. on treatment day #5, he continued hypotensive with blood pressure below target despite maximum of pressor support.
Given the patient's acuity, he was transferred the to the intensive care unit for further monitoring on treatment day #5.
During this week he developed renal insufficiency with a peak creatinine of 5.7 improved to 3.9 at the time of discharge.
He developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of 7.9 improved to 6.9 upon discharge.
He also developed transaminitis with a peak ALT of 78 and peak AST of 86, both improved at the time of discharge.
He developed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count low of 61,000 without evidence of bleeding.
He did develop metabolic acidosis with a minimum bicarbonate of 11, improved with aggressive bicarbonate repletion.
FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 18890**] will return to clinic in 4 weeks after CT scans to assess disease response.
