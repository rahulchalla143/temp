HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, sclera anicteric, OP clear Neck: supple, no JVD (though difficult to estimate given her neck size) CV: reg rate, s1 s2, no m/r/g, nondisplaced PMI Lung: Not able to exam given pt just had cath need to lie on her back, CTA from front.
Coronary angiography of this codominant circulation revealed severe 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed only mildly elevated right and left heart filling pressures with an LVEDP of 12 mmHg, a mean PCW pressure of 15 mmHg, and a mean RA pressure of 9 mmHg.
The cardiac output was borderline low at 4.2 L/min.
Left ventriculography demonstrated preserved left ventricular  systolic wall motion with a calculated LVEF of 64%.
CAse complicated by failed Perclse device resulting in moderate size hematoma and hypotension (SBP 60 mm Hg) and bradycardia responive to IVF, atropine and brief infusion of dopamine.
Left Foot XR - no evidence of inflammation, lytic lesion, joint effusion, or fracture.
Femoral U/S - no pseudoaneurysm, AV fistula  LABORTORY: Hct 36.3-->29.7 stable >24hrs Cr 0.8, 2.1, 2.2, 1.6 (b/l 1.2) TnT <0.01 FENa 1.7%, FeUrea 50% UA no casts   Brief Hospital Course: 75 year-old woman recently dx with breast cancer undergoing cardiac eval prior to have chemo Rx found to have abnormal ETT.
She underwent a left heart cath that found 2 vessel disease with 60% LAD and 90% LCx.
Her Hct continued to slowly decrease however stabalized for >48hrs prior to discharge without further expansion of her hematoma.
Groin u/s showed no pseudoaneurysm or AVF.
She does have relatively severe diastolic heart failure and received IV hydration for cath and BP management.
4 days post cath, she developed acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 2.2.
Her creatinine was decreasing on day of admit.
Her baseline creatinine is 1.2.
She will need qod blood draws to monitor her creatinine, potssium, and hematocrit.
