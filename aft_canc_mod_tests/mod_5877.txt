Basic life support was called and found the patient with a respiratory rate of 2, oxygen saturation of 20%.
The patient was taken by EMS, and placed on 100% oxygen, with the patient subsequently with a respiratory rate of 40, and minimal responsive.
No arterial blood gas was obtained prior to intubation.
Lung nodule, which on [**2131-4-22**], was characterized as a right posterior lung mass, 3.0 cm x 2.0 cm x 2.5 cm, consistent with a hamartomata.
q.d., Combivent 4 puffs inhaled q.4 hours.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 110/60, heart rate 135, respirations 20, oxygen saturation 97% on pressure support ventilation (pressure support of 10, PEEP of 5).
Pupils 2 mm bilaterally, nonreactive.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 12.4, hematocrit 32.2, platelet count 693; sodium 141, potassium 6.2 (hemolyzed), chloride 103, bicarb 24, BUN 14, creatinine 0.6, glucose 182; calcium 9.3, magnesium 2.1; CK 66; ABG after intubation with pH of 7.33, pCO2 66, pO2 364 on the above vent settings.
Chest x-ray showed hyperinflated, hyperaerated lungs, endotracheal tube 4 cm above the carina, no infiltrates.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 160 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, normal [**Last Name (LF) 1754**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depression at 1 mm in V5, no change compared to electrocardiogram from [**2132-2-23**].
CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism.
An echocardiogram was done to evaluate for congestive heart failure exacerbating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 55% and no mitral regurgitation.
A CT scan of the chest was done on this admission showing a right lower lobe lung mass, 3 cm x 3 cm x 3 cm in dimension, with speckled calcification.
On comparison with a chest CT done at the [**Hospital6 1708**] in [**2130-7-22**], the mass was larger, and the adenopathy was new.
A Pulmonary consult was obtained with bronchoscopy and biopsy of the paratracheal lymph node.
Final pathology of the specimen is pending.
The patient was monitored on telemetry for the duration of her stay on the floor.
Hematology:  In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had a hematocrit drop from 28 to 22.
Hematocrit was stable for the remainder of the hospital stay.
An arterial blood gas was checked showing a pH of 7.42, pCO2 57, pO2 246 on 5 L nasal cannula oxygen.
The patient's heart rate was 108, and an electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia.
As the patient had a right lung mass suspicious for cancer, an MRI of the head was ordered to rule out brain metastasis with a seizure focus.
The patient's fingersticks were within normal limits upon transfer to the floor, and therefore the sliding scale was discontinued.
