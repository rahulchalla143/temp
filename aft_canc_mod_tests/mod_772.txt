Yesterday, she went for an INR check and felt lethargic and weak.
Her weakness was more notable on her left side, which is usually her stronger side.
She then went to bed, and per her husband, awoke later than usual in the morning, around 10 AM.
In the emergency department, her initial vital signs were: temperature of 98.1 F, blood pressure of 102/80, heart rate of 86, respiratory rate of 16, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.
While in the emergency room, her blood pressure flucuated from 67 systolic to 93 systolic.
A head CT was without a bleed or edema.
Her laboratories were remarkable for thrombocytopenia, anemia, and new renal failure.
An urinanalysis was unremarkable.
A lumbar puncture was not pursued as her INR was 4.2, and it was felt this was no consistent with her goals of care.
Of note, her last gemcitabine therapy was on [**2145-3-3**], with neupogen given on [**2145-3-4**] and [**2145-3-5**].
Per report from her husband, this therapy is no longer working, and a different therapy plan will be pursued in the coming weeks.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient's blood pressure was 102/46.
Review of systems is otherwise negative for fevers, recent illness, chills, nightsweats, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, chest pain, and shortness of breath.
Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 100.3 F, pulse 97, blood pressure 103/58, respiration 20, and oxygen saturation 98%in room air.
No meningismus, Kernig and Brudzinski signs negative CARDIAC: Regular, III/VI SEM best heard at RUSB, no rubs or gallops LUNGS: Clear to ascultation anteriorly and posteriorly with very occasional wheeze, few rales at bases ABDOMEN: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no dullness to percussion, no guarding or rebound tenderness GENITOURINARY: Rectal tone WNL (as assessed by nursing), patient appearing uncomfortable when temperature obtained, no inguinal masses or tenderness to palpation EXTREMITIES: Warm, bilateral ecchymoses over tibias, right leg slightly more edematous than left.
Grip [**4-27**] on left, [**2-25**] on right, upper extremity [**4-27**] on left.
Pertinent Results: Admission labs: [**2145-3-20**] 12:45PM   NEUTS-89* BANDS-0 LYMPHS-3* MONOS-6 EOS-2 BASOS-0 ATYPS-0 METAS-0 MYELOS-0 [**2145-3-20**] 12:45PM   WBC-5.5 RBC-2.16* HGB-8.1* HCT-23.5* MCV-109* MCH-37.7* MCHC-34.7 RDW-19.2* [**2145-3-20**] 12:45PM   GLUCOSE-111* UREA N-30* CREAT-2.3*# SODIUM-141 POTASSIUM-4.9 CHLORIDE-112* TOTAL CO2-19* ANION GAP-15 [**2145-3-20**] 12:45PM   CALCIUM-9.0 PHOSPHATE-4.6* MAGNESIUM-2.6 [**2145-3-20**] 08:16PM   PT-49.4* PTT-38.0* INR(PT)-5.6*  CXR [**3-20**]: 1.
Recommend repeat imaging after diuresis to excluded underlying infection.
Head CTA [**3-23**]: 1.
No CT signs of an acute infarction.
MRI would be more sensitive for an acute infarction.
Further evaluation may be performed by dedicated chest imaging.
CT of the head was negtive for CVA or TIA, bleed, or new edema.
She refused MRI given her severe claustrophobia.
CTA showed no evidence of intracranial thrombosis.
Her oxycodone was discontinued and her calcium was repleted.
Blood cultures were negative.
(3) Increased Liver Function Tests: RUQ was done for concern of rising LFTs given pt has liver mets.
Her baseline creatinine is 0.5.
Her creatinine on admission was 2.3 and fell to 0.6 when leaving the ICU.
(5) Hypotension:  Patient was hypotensive on admission to 67 systolic BP and she received fluid boluses.
Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as 80-90/50.
(6) Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets 68 on presentation.
Her thrombocytonpenia improved to the 130s on the day of discontinued from the ICU.
On presentation HCT was 23.5 and now is 32.
Her hemolysis labs were negative.
HCT stable at 28-30 thereafter.
(9) Bilateral Leg Pain:  This is likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
She subsequently had some pain and swelling in the right leg; doppler studies were negative for clot.
(10) SVT:  Patient had 2 episodes of SVT while in the ICU with HR up to 150 which responded to metoprolol 5 mg IV.
RLE doppler studies done to evaluate leg pain and swelling were negative for clot.
She was discharged with this dose and plans to follow up for INR check in 2 days.
