He was ruled in also for an MI with a peak troponin of greater than 50.
However, the next day, he developed peripheral eosinophilia and urine eosinophilia which was thought to be secondary to his Zosyn and so he was changed to levofloxacin for one dose.
He also had his Quinton catheter pulled out which he was using for his hemodialysis on [**8-19**] because an AV fistula was formed and there was a big left groin hematoma with a drop in blood pressure.
A CT angiogram was also done to rule out for PE, but that time, bilateral pleural effusions were found.
CT of the abdomen was unremarkable, except for polycystic kidney disease and liver metastasis.
The patient's sputum grew MRSA and Serratia.
The patient's blood pressure was volatile/fluctuating up and down and the patient was repeatedly spiking temperatures.
