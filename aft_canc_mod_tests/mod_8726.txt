CT Head: 1.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
# Acute kidney injury: Pt's creatinine was increased ten-fold on admission (baseline 1.5 to 11).
Did not appear volume overloaded and urine lytes revealed FeNa of 13%.
His complement levels were normal, but SPEP and UPEP were positive and remaining clinical picture was suggestive of multiple myeloma.
His creatinine improved to 2.8 on discharge, and he required IV fluid hydration while hospitalized, though his creatinine continued to trend down  even while drinking PO fluids alone.
His wife was instructed several times to be sure to encourage PO fluids at home, and he will have his chemistries recheck as an outpatient on Monday, [**2182-4-22**].
Lisinopril, gabapentin, and citalopram were all held on discharge, given the fact that his renal function had not completely normalized.
# Multiple Myeloma: Given patient's history of MGUS, acute renal failure, and increase in light chains, heme-onc was consulted for evaluation of progression to multiple myeloma.
Bone marrow biopsy was performed, and showed >20% plasma cells (preliminarily, close to 60% plasma cells).
Was eventually aroused, with blood sugar of 100, EKG within normal limits (rate of 60), and unremarkable ABG.
Telemetry strip showed possible junctional escape rhythm, and cardiology was consulted for possible pacer placement.
He was monitored on telemetry throughout his stay and had no other arrhythmias.
Head CT negative for acute intracranial process and has had a negative RPR in past.
# Murmur: Systolic murmur on exam had not been documented in recent outpatient notes.
He had an echocardiogram to evaluate for structural heart disease, but the echo showed only mild LVOT, which likely accounts for the murmur.. .
SBPs in 130s, 140s, sometimes to 160s/170s.
Follow-up BMP drawn on [**2182-4-22**] (with particular attention to sodium and BUN/Cr) 2.
Blood pressure check, consider starting hydralazine if not well controlled (avoid AV nodal blocking agents and ACE-i) 4.
Medications on Admission: AMLODIPINE - 10 mg Tablet - 1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth once a day CITALOPRAM - 20 mg Tablet - 0.5 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day for 1 week; then increase to 1 qd GABAPENTIN - 300 mg Capsule - 1 Capsule(s) by mouth three times a day LISINOPRIL - 10 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day.
PANTOPRAZOLE [PROTONIX] - 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
You will need to follow up as an outpatient with the kidney doctors when [**Name5 (PTitle) **] leave the hospital.
A bone marrow biopsy was performed and suggest you have multiple myeloma.
