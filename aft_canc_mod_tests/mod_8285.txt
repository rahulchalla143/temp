Urgent exploratory laparotomy, oversewing and repair of splenic artery, and placement of intra-abdominal drain.
Exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, and drainage of left upper quadrant intra-abdominal fluid collection.
She was hospitalized, and CT of the abdomen showed a ~2 cm cystic mass in the body of the pancreas, and evidence of pancreatitis in the pancreatic tail.
Work-up during her second hospitization was notable for triglyceride of 830, lipase of 782, and normal LFTs; MRCP showed no significant interval change in the pancreatic cystic mass, atrophy of the pancreatic tail, no biliary dilatation, no gallstones, no choledocholithiasis.
It was recommended that she undergo fine needle aspiration of the cystic mass with endoscopic ultrasound.
Since then, she's had another episode of pancreatitis, and GI performed FNA of the cyst, which was acellular with CEA of 43ng/Ml and amylase of 109,200.
The patient was advised on her options, including imaging surveillance, no surgery, repeat endoscopic ultrasound to test the cyst fluid CEA, and surgical excision.
During the first night after surgery, she became tachycardic, for which she received two 500cc LR boluses, and then a 1L LR bolus, and a hematocrit was checked that came back at 27.6, with a repeat hematocrit 4 hours later being 24.3.
Given her persistent tachycardia and falling hematocrit, she was transfused one unit of blood and received a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on the morning of [**2131-10-11**] that showed the presence of hematoma adjacent to the divided pancreas without evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma related to the inferior epigastric artery.
On [**10-18**] her creatinine bumped to 1.4 from a baseline of 0.4, so her Vanc and Zosyn were stopped given she had received a 7 day course of antibiotics and was now experiencing acute kidney injury.
A CT abdomen/pelvis was performed that showed a high grade small bowel obstruction in the LUQ in the area of the surgical bed, but given that she was only one week post-op it was felt that conservative management with NG tube and IV fluids would be the best course for the time being, and she was also started on TPN for nutrition.
Unfortunately, after 3 days of NG tube suction she developed coffee-ground output with intermittent episodes of bright red bloody output from her NG tube despite being on a PPI twice daily, became tachycardic, and her hematocrit began to fall despite receiving 1 unit of packed RBC's, with a nadir of 18.0 on [**10-24**].
Ms. [**Known lastname **] also failed to resume bowel function with consistently high NG tube outputs, and in combination with her new upper GI bleed it was now felt that she would need to be taken back to the OR for an EGD and exploratory laparotomy in the setting of a background concern for bowel ischemia.
Her pre-transfusion vital signs were: T=98 F, RR=30 on 2 L O2, HR=123, and BP=148/88.
At 15:35, her O2 sat dropped to 91% on 2L O2 and her oxygen was increased to 4L.
A chest x-ray showed worsened interval pulmonary edema with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
At about 20:00, her O2 sat dropped to 92% and her O2 was increased to 6L with duoneb treatment.
Her O2 sat dropped transiently to 60% at 7AM the following morning and she was placed on a face mask for better oxygenation.
Her O2 sat was stabilized and her interval chest x-rays showed no change.
Echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function without signs of volume overload.
By [**10-29**] her pulmonary infiltrates were resolving on her chest xray, her creatinine was trending down, and her hemodynamics were overall stable with some tachycardia and episodes of hypertension that were treated with and responsive to lopressor and IV hydralazine, and she was ultimately deemed stable for transfer back to the floor.
Her platelet count continued to be in the 1000-1400 range and her GI bleed was resolved, so she was started on aspirin 325mg daily for anticoagulation in addition to her subcutaneous heparin.
Her JP drain amylase was checked after she took in a full liquid diet and was found to be [**Numeric Identifier 15614**], but her JP drain output was consistently less than 10cc per day and it was felt that she was ready for a regular diet.
She was given prescriptions for her new medicines, notably her oxycodone, PPI, and stool softeners, and was instructed to follow up in clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks and to follow up with her primary care doctor as soon as possible, and was advised to call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with any questions or concerns.
We have added an additional blood pressure medicine to your home regimen, and you should see your primary care provider as soon as possible to follow up on your blood pressure control regimen.
JP Drain Care: Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever greater than 101 degrees).
