Patient was started on moxifloxacin for presumed pneumonia, but chest xray and cultures (unclear if blood or sputum) were negative, so antibiotics were stopped after 4 days.
Upper endoscopy was pursued which was negative.
During this admission blood cultures, CT torso, bone marrow biopsy and bone scan were all unremarkable, and patient was discharged without a definitive diagnosis.
He had a PET scan on [**4-15**] which was negative except for increased bilateral adrenal uptake.
In the ED, patient triggered on arrival for BP 71/47.Improved with fluids to systolics in the mid 80s, and per report this is not far from the patient's baseline BP.
Intial VS were 92, 80/53, 17, 96% RA, then 100% on 2L and then 96% 4L.
Labs revealed an AGMA, Cr of 1.5, thrombocytopenia to 47 and anemia to Hct 27 from baseline in the 30s.
EKG showed afib with a RBBB.
CXR was initially unremarkable.
UA was normal and blood cultures were sent.
CTA was negative for PE.
Patient was guaiac positive on exam with brown stool, and had an NG lavage which was negative.
Rectal temerpature was 101.6.
Transfusion was stopped, and repeat CXR showed mild pulmonary edema.
Saturation was maintained in the 90s prior to this on 4L, but after transfusion reaction patient became mottled and a sat was hard to obtain.
ABG on 100% NRB was 7.26/29/59/14, so intubation was pursued.
Periperhal neo was started and on transfer VS were 117, 83/50, 18, 100% on TV 470 RR 22 PEEP 5 FiO2 100%.

CTA CHEST [**2182-4-18**]: 1.
Bowing of the interventricular septum to the left, raising a question of pulmonary hypertension and correlation with ECHO could be performed.
If there are RUQ symptoms, an ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation.
Cardiac ECHO ([**2182-4-22**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for a second time after worsening respiratory distress on the floor, with CXR consistent with ARDS.
Skin lesions on buttocks were biopsied by dermatology service and found to be growing [**Last Name (LF) 23087**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] fungal coverage was changed to micafungin, bronch was done and showed no e/o PCP but patient was started on prophylactic dose of bactrim daily.
Initially thought to be [**2-20**] medication effect as he was on voriconazole, however even after stopping remained elevated, RUQ u/s showed no portal vein thrombosis, most likely elevation in liver enzymes due to HLH.
BP slowly improved over the next few days with these therapies and pt was stable on at home blood pressures at time of discharge to floor.
On the floor, BP remained stable, however was hypotensive after transfer to ICU, see course above.
ECHO was unremarkable.
On the floor, oxygen saturation remained in high 90s initially, however he was transferred to ICU again for respiratory distress, CXR was consistent with ARDS, for which he was intubated again, see ICU course above.
After transfer to the ICU for respiratory failure, he was placed on a diltiazem drip when BP tolerated for frequent episodes of RVR, see above for details.
Cyclosporine was discontinued on [**2182-5-12**] since pt's ferritin levels were elevated and his smear showed histiocytes with engulfed RBC.
His baseline weight prior to admission was 140s and his weight was as high as 200s.
Chemotherapy was initiated (etoposide dose was initially reduced when bilirubin was high) and liver enzymes normalized subsequently.
Liver enzymes started to trend upwards again when voriconazole was started for presumed aspergillosis infection, and after voriconazole was stopped they continued to uptrend, repeat RUQ u/s showed no portal vein thrombosis.
