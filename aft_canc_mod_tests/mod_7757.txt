Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
[**2134-1-22**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - No evidence of mass or mass effect in the brain, however, evaluation of the mass is limited due to lack of IV contrast.
Hence a negative DVT study in no way excludes a PE in this patient.
[**2134-1-23**] CXR - The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
MICROBIOLOGIC DATA: [**2134-1-22**] Blood cultures (x 2) ??????

contaminated specimen CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2134-1-25**]):       Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
In the ED, EKG demonstrating S1-Q3-T3 pattern, D-dimer markedly elevation with cardiac biomarker elevation (peak 1.59, CK-MB 30) and 2D-Echo demonstrating focal hypokinesis of the right ventricule with preserved LVEF.
A CXR showed some opacification at the right and left lung base which could represent early consolidation given his immunecompromise and healthcare exposure.
An acute component of COPD exacerbation and untreated obesity-hypoventilation syndrome is also likely given his hypercarbia.
Of note, his ABG demonstrated 7.30/60/69 with an A-a gradient of 7 - in the setting of his known obstructive sleep apnea, obesity and COPD history.
According to prior records his baseline saturations were in the mid 90s.
# HYPOTENSION - Presented with SBP to the 80s in the ED with Neosynephrine gtt started.
On the floor his blood pressure remained in the low 100s.
Evidence of sinus tachycardia to a rate of 127, normal axis, qIII, TWI III, no ST depressions/elevations noted on admission EKG.
We optimized his electrolytes and monitored serial EKGs.
His EKG showed frequent PACs and not atrial fibrillation.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY - Baseline creatinine in the 1.3 range with acute elevation to 3.0 on admission.
Urine lytes revealed FeNa 1.6% on admission (FeUrea of 29.34%) with concern for mixed intra-renal vs. pre-renal etiology and poor forward perfusion in the setting of hypovolemia, GI losses and volume depletion and evidence of shock physiology.
Following fluid resuscitation, creatinine remains stable at 2.1 and steadily improved to 1.7 at admission.
Stool cultures and C.diff toxin unrevealing.
ABG on admission demonstrated hypercarbia with acidemia, with suspected underlying hypoventilation with suspected baseline hypercarbia with compensation.
CT head negative for intracranial acute process.
# LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA - Stage IIIB (T2b N3 MX) currently receiving infusions of carboplatin and taxol, last dose received [**2134-1-21**].
# HYPERTENSION - On Lisinopril, HCTZ per home medication dosing; will hold anti-hypertensives in the setting of hypotension and renal failure.
He is currently scheduled to receive 31 total treatments.
We found that you had a blood clot in your lung.
