ECG showed AFib w/ RVR.
CXR showed no significant effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation.
She had a shock ultrasound that was negative and was started on Neosynephrine for her hypotension.

EKG [**2175-12-11**] Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
TTE [**2175-12-12**] IMPRESSION: Markedly dilated right ventricle with moderate global hypokinesis and relative sparing of the basal right ventricular segments.
RADIOLOGY: CXR ([**2175-12-12**]): FINDINGS: Large right thyroid masses again appreciated with calcification and leftward deviation of the trachea.
Double density with regard to the cardiac shadow is consistent with a large hiatal hernia.
CTA Chest ([**2175-12-13**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Chest ([**12-21**]): pending   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 83-yo woman w/ chronic dCHF (LVH, EF 75%), chronic A-fib on anticoagulation, severe pulm HTN, DM, HTN, HL, and metastatic thyroid Ca s/p CyberKnife therapy, p/w 20-pound weight gain x2 weeks and progressively worsening SOB and DOE, found to be in A-fib w/ RVR in the ED, hypotensive, and hypoxic, admitted to the CCU, improved w diuresis and transferred temporarily to regular floor.
PUMP: Pt w/ known chronic dCHF (LVH and EF 75%), p/w acute exacerbation in the setting of afib with RVR.
She was overloaded on exam and was responsive to a lasix drip with improvement in volume status.
TTE showed EF 70-75%, markedly dilated RV w/ moderate global HK, preserved LV regional and global systolic function, severe diastolic dysfunction, moderate to severe pulmonary hypertenion.
With improvement in her volume status, she was transferred to the regular floor, however, readmitted to CCU for hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Coumadin was continued but INR became supratherapeutic.
Now s/p diltiazem and esmolol drips on PO diltiazem and metoprolol with HR 90-100.
# HYPOTENSION: Pt w/ SBP 80s-90s in ED in the setting of RVR, and neosynephrine  was started for BP support while on rate-controlling agents.
Blood pressure improved with rate control and diuresis.
Urine lytes c/w prerenal physiology.
# SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR: Pt on coumadin for a-fib, but INR now > 6, unclear etiology.
