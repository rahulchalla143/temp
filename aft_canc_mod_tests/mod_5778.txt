In the ED, vitals were Tmax 102, BP 110/67, HR 124, 95% on 4L NC.
Cardiac enzymes were sent from the ED and she ruled in for NSTEMI (troponin 0.47, CK 81).
BNP on admission was [**Numeric Identifier 97173**], lactate 2.4.
EKG on admission with sinus tachycardia, RBBB, no ST or TW changes.
There was question of a pneumonia on CXR and Vanc/Levo were started empirically.
Check of vital signs at the time revealed hypoxia to 88% on 6L NC.
CXR showed worsening pulmonary edema bilaterally with bilateral pleural effusions.
Repeat EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, rate of 94, STE in V1-V3 and TWI in V4-V6, I, II, aVF, aVL.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35%).
EKG showed ST elevations in anterior leads.
ABG done on NRB showed pH 7.4/27/83.
Given EKG changes, CXR and elevated BNP on admission, patient is likely in decompensated heart failure due to infection +/- recent d/c of lasix and metoprolol.
Pulmonary edema resolved on CXR - Surface echocardiogram->EF 30-35% with inferior and anterolateral hypo/akinesis.
- Initial "pneumonia" seen on CXR may have been pulmonary edema, however MRSA growing in [**3-7**] sputum but not present on repeat sputum gram stain, likely colonization given absence of fever elevated WBC and or clear infiltrate on CXR.
3) Rhythm: Originally sinus tach, likely compensation decrease CO. Then had episode of a.fib with RVR and hypotension at 8pm [**2169-3-7**].
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: 2.5 Tablets PO DAILY (Daily).
You will need Pulmonary function tests and ophthalmology follow up.
