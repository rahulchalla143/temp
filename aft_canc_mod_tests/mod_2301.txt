Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (ejection fraction 30-40 percent) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior septum, inferior free wall, posterior wall, and lateral wall.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-12-12**], the left ventricular ejection fraction appears somewhat further reduced with more extensive regional wall motion abnormalities (but the ejction fraction may have been overestimated on the prior report).
Coumadin 5 mg qHS was started on [**12-24**] with an INR goal of 2.0 to 3.0.
Patient was switched to lovenox on [**12-25**] in order to bridge him until his INR is in the therapeutic range.
INR was 1.2 on day of discharge.
Pleural Effusion- CTA showed thick rind around the left pleural surface, most likely representing malignant pleural disease.
Blood cutures from [**12-22**] were pending upon discharge.
Sputum cultures could not be obtained.
Elevations most likely reflected CRI and cardiac strain in setting of PE rather than active ischemia.
Microcytic anemia- Baseline 30-36.

Enoxaparin 100 mg/mL Syringe Sig: Ninety (90) mg Subcutaneous Q12H (every 12 hours) for 7 days: Continue until your INR is therapeutic (2.0 to 3.0) for 48 hours.
Pulmonary embolism 2.

Discharge Instructions: Please call your primary doctor or return to the ED with fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, spontaneous bleeding or any other concerning symptoms.
Your INR should be checked two days after discharge and your coumadin dose should be adjusted according to an INR goal of 2.0 to 3.0.
For the first 1-2 weeks, your INR should be checked twice a week.
