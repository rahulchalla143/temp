He was taken to the OR on [**8-7**] by Drs [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who performed an orthotopic liver transplant with duct-to-duct anastomosis.
Over the course of the hospitalization the platelet count increased and the HCT remained stable.
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] evaluation of the liver revealed normal vasculature except the right hepatic artery.
A repeat U/S done on [**8-14**] showed all patent vasculature including the RHA.
An MR was initially suggestive of a Portal Vein stenosis and the patient was initiated on a heparin drip.
Portal venography was performed on [**8-15**] showing discrepancy in size between the native and donor portal veins with relative stenosis, but no significant pressure gradient across the anastomosis.
Drain Bili measured on [**8-16**] was 8.1.
The patient had one remaining JP at the time of this test which was putting out about 1-1.2 liters of ascitic fluid tinged with bile daily.
Liver enzymes (AST and ALT) which had briefly elevated at the time of the portal venography trended back to normal.
Alk phos remained slightly elevated in addition to serum bilirubin of 5.9.
On [**8-19**], an ERCP was performed for concern for bile leak as the JP bili was 25.7.
No extravasation of contrast was noted - high pressure cholangiogram was not obtained given recent transplant.
A CT without iv contrast was performed on [**8-20**] to assess for a perihepatic collection.
A collection was noted and this was drained in CT for 260cc of serosanguinous fluid.
The JP drainage was ~700-1400cc/day.
A gram stain and culture were submitted and he was started on Ancef.
Gram stain had 1+pmns without growth on the culture.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtain for assist with insulin management of hyperglycemia.
