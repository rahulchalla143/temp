RADIOLOGY:  - [**2139-1-1**] SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: IMPRESSION: Patchy opacities in both lung bases, which may reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Further characterization of the kidneys is limited by poor visualization   - [**2139-1-3**] RIGHT FOOT FILM: Three views.
[**2139-1-11**] CXR :As compared to the previous radiograph, the right medial lung base shows an area of increased density, consisting of peribronchial opacities associated with air bronchograms.
