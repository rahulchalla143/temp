Upon arrival at the outside facility a CT was obtained that showed a large parietal tumor with significant midline shift.
Toes downgoing bilaterally  Upon discharge: neuro exam intact, wound well healed  PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE: *******  Pertinent Results: [**4-1**] Head CT: 1.
[**4-6**] Brain MRI: IMPRESSION: Limited enhanced MR examination, re-demonstrating the uniformly-enhancing intraventricular mass centered in the left lateral ventricular atrium, with imaging characteristics most suggestive of meningioma.
[**4-6**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes with peri-operative appearance of left craniotomy and tumor resection.
Evaluation for residual tumor is limited.
Consider followup evaluation to assess stability/progression.
Mild mass effect with shift of the midline structures to the right side, with a moderate-sized pneumocephalus, which is seen to indent the left cerebral hemisphere,as seen on the prior CT study.
An MRI brain with contrast was obtained STAT.
SBP was kept less than 140 and she was preopped for surgery.
Post op head CT revealed good placement of catheter and no hemorrhage.
Head CT revealed post op changes.
Dilantin level was 3 therefore it was reloaded.
An MRI was obtained which revealed limited residual tumor.
?You have an appointment in the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic on [**7-18**] at 11:15AM on [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] 4 for MRI then at 1PM at The Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] of [**Hospital1 18**], in the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building, [**Location (un) **].
?You will need an MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium contrast.
You also require a blood test to measure your BUN and Cr within 30 days of your MRI.
