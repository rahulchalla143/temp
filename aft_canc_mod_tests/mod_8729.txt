In the [**Name (NI) **], pt AF, BP 119/86, HR 78, RR 22, O2 sat 92% RA.
EKG with a-v pacing, widened QRS, ST/T wave abnls but unchanged from prior EKG on [**2151-3-27**].
CXR with tiny R pleural effusion and changes suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension, R shoulder x-ray without dislocation or fractures.
Troponin elevated to 0.22 from 0.05 on [**3-28**], CK 128, MB 8.
Repeat cardiac enzymes revealed troponin 0.29, CK 111, MB 11, MBI 9.9.
Past Medical History: - Atrial fibrillation: off coumadin secondary to epistaxis - [**Month/Year (2) **] sinus syndrome: temporary pacer placed during [**11-20**] admission, was to return for permanent [**Month/Year (2) 4448**] placement, which was again deferred during [**1-21**] admission secondary to medical illness.
- hx of VT with torsades morphology in [**3-22**], was on amiodarone,  recently stopped for hypothyroidism.
- Aortic stenosis-> echo [**8-22**] showing peak gradient 76 mm Hg.

EKG - a-v sequential pacing @ 70 bpm, LAD, widened QRS, diffuse ST and T wave changes unchanged from prior on [**2151-3-27**].
CXR - There is no change in cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration.
R shoulder x-ray - The right shoulder is held in internal rotation.
TTE [**3-23**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated but quite elongated.
Cardiac cath [**3-23**] - 1.
(Left main 10%, prox LAD 10%, mid LAD 60%, distal LAD 30% occlusion, LCx no disease, RCA not injected known to be chronically occluded).
On repeat, troponin rose to 0.29, CK MB and MBI elevated to 11 and 9.9 respectively.
EKG essentially non-diagnostic given a-v pacing.
Recent cath [**3-23**] revealed 60% mid LAD disease, site of prior POBA.
P: With known h/o systolic CHF, EF 25-30% on TTE 1 month ago.
Currently appears slightly volume overloaded on exam but not acutely so.
Does have history of critical AS s/p valvuloplasty last month with decrease in peak AV gradients from 70 to 36 mmHg.
Repeat echo done here following hypotensive episode; severity of AS improved (though still severe) and EF now 30%.
Also cultured and given broad spectrum abx which were discontinued once cultures negative x 48 hours.
Shoulder x-rays showed DJD only.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**12-16**] Sprays Nasal [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
