At [**Hospital1 1474**], the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 96/56 at his baseline with a heart rate in the 160s, in atrial fibrillation without ischemic EKG changes.
of Diltiazem with the heart rate decreasing to the 100s and a systolic blood pressure decreasing to 78.
His heart rate was noted to be irregularly/irregular in the 110s with a systolic blood pressure between 80 and 95.
DVT in [**2147-1-14**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.4, BP 81-95/47-69, heart rate 98-129 (irregular), respiratory rate 23, 100% on room air.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White blood cell count 11.3, hematocrit 28.7, platelets 453,000.
Sodium 141, potassium 4.6, chloride 105, bicarbonate 33, BUN 8, creatinine 0.6, glucose 80, lactate 1.4.
INR 8.0 (at [**Hospital1 1474**]).
EKG revealed atrial fibrillation at 112 beats per minute, normal axis, poor R wave progression, no ischemic ST-T wave changes.
The patient was evaluated with an echocardiogram on [**2148-2-7**] which was significant for an ejection fraction of 30-40%, decreased from a previous echocardiogram.
Given his history of atrial fibrillation, the patient was also maintained on Coumadin with a heparin drip until his INR was therapeutic for 48 hours.
An MRI performed was significant for increase in fluid collection posterior to the body of S2 with residual fluid pockets posterior to the previous operative site.
The patient was also noted to have loose stools and a C. difficile toxin came back negative and the patient was treated with Flagyl.
The patient also has a history of a DVT and atrial fibrillation and was continued on heparin and Coumadin as noted above until her INR is therapeutic for 48 hours.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was placed on zinc and vitamin C for wound healing.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was performed and the patient did not respond appropriately according to the sepsis protocol and was placed on three days of stress dose steroids for potential adrenal insufficiency.
He also has a scheduled echocardiogram on [**2148-3-25**] at 2:00 p.m. and a follow-up appointment with cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**], on [**2148-4-1**] at 2:30 p.m.  Of note, the discharge medications and diagnoses are subject to change according to subsequent discharge addendums.
