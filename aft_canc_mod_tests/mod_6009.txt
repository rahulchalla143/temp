Pt states that he was in his usual state of health when he went for a biopsy of a left peritoneal lymph node last tuesday.
Labs were notable for elevated WBC to 18.9 with 92% neutrophils.
INR was elevated to 1.8.
CT abd showed retroperitoneal bleed, slightly enlarged from prior.
IR was contact[**Name (NI) **] and did not feel that the bleeding was excessive, however was concerned for possible pseudoanuerysm based on CT findings and therefore recommended angiogram in AM for further characterization.
20 gauge IV in L and 2 IVs in R. After 2 Ls NS in the ED, vitals were 100/59, HR 66. .

The known left perirenal left retroperitoneal hemorrhage is slightly larger and has higher attenuation, compared to the prior study done 5 hours earlier.
Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of [**2155-4-8**].
Review is also performed of a torso CT of [**2-12**], [**2155**], which demonstrated among other findings an inflammatory process in the left lower lobe.
This finding has decreased, but was not completely eliminated on the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of [**2155-4-7**].
If diagnostic difficulties persist, consider a PA and lateral chest examination or renewed CT to evaluate in more detail the previously identified pulmonary processes as seen on CT in [**Month (only) 404**].
Left retroperitoneal hematoma is poorly visualized and obscures evaluation of the left kidney.
[**4-9**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**4-8**], there has been placement of a right IJ catheter that extends to the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.
[**4-9**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1.
CT abd/pelvis revealed a left sided retroperitoneal hematoma with saccular hyperenhancing lesion anterior to the left renal artery, likely representing a pseudoaneurysm.
Was again noted to have falling HCT, and had repeat CT abd/pelvis which revealed increased size of left RP hematoma, indicating ongoing bleeding.
Urine culture obtained, but was negative.
When EKG demonstrated peaked T waves and K 6.7, he received CaGluc, Insulin+Glucose, and additional kayexalate with subsequent decrease in K.  Plan had been for HD, though initiation of HD deferred as above given goals of care to focus on comfort.
# Elevated WBC: WBC elevated in setting of recent intitation of steroid therapy.
Patient had blood and urine cultures sent; urine cultures negative and blood cultures negative to date at time patient expired.
CXR did not show any acute cardiopulmonary process, and showed marked improvement of the left lower lobe opacity seen on prior studies.
