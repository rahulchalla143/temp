Pertinent Results: CT Head [**2181-2-25**]: 1.
Limited examination demonstrates irregularity of the left vertebral artery at the level of the C2 fracture, much of which is thought to represent vessel tortuosity, though there are at least two concerning static images which could represent focal intimal injury with flap, without complete occlusion.
A follow-up examination is suggested to exclude the possibility of a minor vertebral artery injury.
Ct C-spine [**2181-2-26**]: 1.
Fracture to the base of dens extending through the left transverse foramen and into the left superior articular facet, with interval increase in craniocaudal distraction of approximately 2 mm and minimal leftward angulation of the dens.
MRA/MRI Brain [**2181-3-1**]: 1.
Abd X-ray [**2181-3-6**]: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern.
Chest X-ray [**2181-3-7**]: In comparison with the study of [**3-5**], there has been substantial  clearing of the volume loss at the left base with sharp definition of the hemidiaphragm.
An ICP monitor was placed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Her Chest X-rays consistently showed changed consistent with atelectasis/aspiration pneumonia/contusion.
Repeat CTA and CT on [**2-28**] showed no change in hemorrhage but suggestion of tortuosity of Left vertebral artery.
