The pt was hospitalized [**Date range (1) 61436**] at [**Location (un) **], and stated that he was given IVF hydration, stool studies sent, he underwent flex sigmoidoscopy showing "rectal ulcers" that were biopsied, with path pending per pt.
AML - Hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**]: [**Date range (1) 61437**]: Initial bone marrow biopsy showed marrow involvement by AML evolving in a background of myelodysplastic syndrome.
A repeat marrow on day +20 showed a hypocellular marrow with young cells that were thought to be of normal maturation.
His peripheral smear demonstrated few blasts, also thought to represent early cells of normal maturation.
His peripheral smear continued to show blasts and on day +28, his marrow was re-biopsied.
CMV VL on [**2176-2-29**] was undetectable.
AML (multiple cytogentic aberrations)- diagnosed [**1-21**], S/P 2.  alloSCT from sibling donor 3.
Pulm Aspergillus 8.
Wt 130 lbs, 66 inches.
[**2175-2-22**] BM Bx: Cellular myeloid-dominant marrow with markedly left-shifted myelopoiesis and increased myeloblasts (day 20 status post myeloblative chemotherapy) Note: Although myeloblasts appear increased on the hemodilute aspirate smear, an accurate count can not be determined due to poor specimen quality.
[**3-18**] BM Bx: biopsy consists of blood, cortical bone, and a few fragments of > 95% cellular bone marrow comprised almost exclusively of immature cells, consistent with myeloblasts.
MOST RECENT ECHO [**7-20**] EF >60%.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Imaging: [**2176-4-3**]: CXR CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: An opacity is present in the left lower lobe.
Pulmonary vascularity remains within normal limits.
Compared to prior study, the left lower lobe opacity appears slightly worse.
[**4-9**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-4**] and 24: Bibasilar pneumonia is clearing.
CTA [**4-9**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT ABD [**4-9**] IMPRESSION: 1.
A renal ultrasound is recommended for definitive characterization.
CT HEAD [**4-9**] FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
CT CHEST [**4-19**] IMPRESSION: Improving of the bilateral lower lobe consolidation   Brief Hospital Course: 59 y/o gentleman with h/o AML day 217 post allo SCT (HLA matched sibling) presents with 3.5 week h/o diarrhea, 13 lb weight loss, decr po intake.
He was started on levaquin, however, his PNA worsened with chest CT the following day showing bilateral lower lobe consolidations.
Pt's sats remained stable on face mask, now weaned down to 50% Fio2, upper 90s sats.
His Vancomycin was discontinued, and azithromycin was added empirically for Legionella coverage (although urinary antigen negative).
Repeat Chest CT on [**2176-4-19**] showed interval improvement in pneumonia.
His CMV VL was negative X 3, but do not suspect CMV PNA.
CMV VL at OSH neg, CMV VL here negative X 3.
Repeat CMV VL was sent which was positive but not within detectable range, and patient was re-started on Ganciclovir; he received treatment dose for 4 days and then converted to Valganciclovir maintenance dose.
Incidentaloma: CT Chest on [**2176-4-19**] showed low-density right kidney lesion which should be evaluated with ultrasound to exclude the possibility of complex cyst or malignancy.
