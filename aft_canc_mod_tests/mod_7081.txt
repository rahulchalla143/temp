A TTE on [**2117-9-30**] showed severe supravalvular pulmonic stenosis with RV hypertrophy and dilation, EF 55%.
Family History: Daughter with cervical cancer, mother with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer, father with DM  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 97.9  HR 80s reg   BP 110-144/80s-90s   RR 18   94-96% on RA ??????
Pertinent Results: -Chem-7 WNL -CBC WNL -CXR [**2117-9-30**]: unremarkable -Echocardiogram [**2117-9-30**]: possible extrinsic compression of the main pulmonary artery; severe supravalvular pulmonic stenosis; MR imaging or CT scanning recommended to delineate the cause of pulmonic stenosis -CTA [**2117-10-1**]: Low-density lesion in main pulmonary artery, measuring 2 x 3 cm in diameter, with extensive coarse calcification.
-TEE [**2117-10-4**]: normal LV systolic fxn (LVEF>55%).
RV fxn could not be accurately assessed.
-Repeat creat after CTA Chest and hydration with bicarb: 1.2->1.3 -Panorex films [**2117-10-5**]: WNL  Brief Hospital Course: 66F with h/o anxiety, renal cell CA [**26**] yrs ago sent to ED fr PCP's office after outpt echo showed severe pulm art HTN.
Admitted to medicine for evaluation of her pulmonary HTN and workup of the pulmonic stenosis.
Pt refused all closed MRI studies, even with premedication, due to fears of claustrophobia but pt agreed to a CT chest with contrast.
CT showed a 3.2 cm calcified mass in her main pulmonary artery.
Hematology-Oncology was consulted and suggested a renal U/S or CT to evaluate for a new RCC primary.
Renal U/S showed no definite evidence of disease recurrence within the right nephrectomy bed, although this study was limited by pt's body habitus.
Interventional cardiology was consulted and performed cardiac cath on [**2117-10-4**] to further evaluate new pulm stenosis.
Cath revealed elevated right sided pressures (RV 113/13 mmHg) and normal pulmonary pressures (PA 26/19 mmHg) with a calculated pulmonary valve area of 0.29 cm and a gradient of 35.68 mmHg between the RV and the PA. Intravascular ultrasound showed a significant and large calcific plaque distal the pulmonary valve.
# Renal: s/p nephrectomy; creat 1.1 w/1 working kidney; rec'd 75cc optiray for CT PE protocol on [**10-1**] + hydration.
Renal U/S ([**10-3**]): No evidence of mass in left kidney or R nephrectomy bed.
