# Sepsis / pneumonia: The patient presented with elevated WBC 73.9 (94.4% pmns), fever (T 100.8), tachypnea (RR 24), and CXR that showed interstitial opacities concerning for multifocal pneumonia vs CHF exacerbation.
Blood cultures taken at the time of admission showed NGTD.
EKG showed LVH, mildly increased from EKG [**2192-10-18**].
His cardiac enzymes were likely chronically elevated due to his ESRD, or from demand ischemia given his fluid overload; cardiology was consulted, and agreed with this assessment.
Other pertinent labs on admission included uric acid 6.4 and LDH 456 elevated.
His Hct 27.8 (baseline 21-29) and Plt 21.8 (19-26) are low but at his baseline since [**2191**].
Please obtain a repeat CXR to ensure that the patient's CHF has resolved.
Please check his weight and evaluate his fluid status.
