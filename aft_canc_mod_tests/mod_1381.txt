Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 70 188 76 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 34598**]1  CT Head [**6-5**](post-op): FINDINGS: There has been an interval left craniectomy with a wire mesh at the operative site.
MRI Head [**6-7**](Post-op): TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired before gadolinium.
Following gadolinium, T1 sagittal, axial and coronal images were obtained.
Comparison was made with the MRI of [**2138-6-5**].
Small areas of enhancement are seen in the right parietal and temporal bones which could be secondary to additional skull metastasis.
This finding is unchanged from previous MRI examinations.
