Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old male with possible cholangiocarcinoma, HTN, CAD, hypothyroidism, tachy/brady syndrome with recent CBD stent on [**5-1**] presenting after episode of unresponsiveness found to have a fingerstick of 6, found to have cholangitis.
1) Sepsis due to Cholangitis in the setting of a hepatic mass: The patient underwent an ERCP (see result section) which showed a dilated common bile duct at 15 mm.
The patient's Alk phos/Tbili remained elevated, likely due to ongoing obstruction related to known liver mass.
The patient underwent an MRCP which showed a new left lobe cystic fluid collection, likely incident to ruptured bile ducts (intrahepatic bilomas) due to marked obstruction.
2) Hypoglycemia: In the setting of a glucose <40, the patient's C-peptide and insulin levels were elevated, raising the possibility of insulinoma.
This may have been related to recent sepsis (see above), however a HIT antibody was positive (low titer).
4) Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine trended down to 1.1 from maximum value of  1.6.
