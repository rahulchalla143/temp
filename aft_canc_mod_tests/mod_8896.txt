Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations as well as subtraction images were essential in demonstrating multiple perspectives for this dynamic series.
[**1-30**] LIMITED ULTRASOUND OF THE ABDOMEN:  Comparison was made with the prior MRI dated [**2175-1-26**].
She remained stable overnight and had an ultrasound of her liver on the day of discharge which revealed moderate ascites.
As to our assessment she will need platelet suppression to prevent occlusion of the single draining collateral hepatic vein which could result in a disastrous acute on chronic Budd Chiari syndrome.
