Name:  [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname 2175**]                         Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 15491**]  Admission Date:  [**2184-5-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2184-5-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2107-12-3**]     Sex:  F   THIS IS AN ADDENDUM:  The patient had a troponin level which was 15.6, which was elevated.
This raised the suspicion for a prior myocardial screen was obtained which was negative.
Her initial INR was 4.6.
Her Dilantin level was less than 0.6.
On a head CT scan there was evidence of an old right frontal infarction with associated encephalomalacia and a new left parietal occipital region of edema within the white matter as well as evidence of a central abnormality suggestive of a  On MRI there was T2 hyperintensity in the same region as the edema seen on head CT scan, but there was also a well demarcated, heterogenous lesion in the medial parietal occipital region without evidence of susceptibility.
Examination demonstrated decreased withdrawal of her right upper extremity which suggested a left hemispheric lesion.
Pathology of the mass demonstrated a papillary adenocarcinoma.
A body CT scan was obtained that demonstrated an approximately 1 centimeter spiculated nodule in the peripheral left upper lobe.
This was not seen on the chest CT scan of [**2182-12-6**].
The presence of this lucency led to a bone scan that did not demonstrate evidence of metastatic disease.
The patient should undergo an outpatient mammogram to help exclude breast cancer as a possible etiology, even though there is evidence of a mass in the left lung.
An EEG was obtained that demonstrated slow and disorganized background activities with bursts of generalized slowing, as well as prominent focal high voltage sharp wave discharged in the left posterior quadrant that occasionally extended more generally.
Her liver function tests and amylase were followed intermittently through her hospital stay since she is taking Depakote; this should continue to be done as an outpatient to insure that there is not evidence of transaminitis or pancreatitis.
Her Depakote level on [**5-20**] was 60, and that was  a random level, and her Depakote trough on [**5-17**] was 58.
Her blood count indices should also be followed while she is receiving Depakote.
In regards to the patient's anemia, her hematocrit was closely followed through her hospital stay.
Given the patient's coronary artery disease and carotid stenosis, her hematocrit should be closely followed and blood transfusions should be performed as needed.
A left upper extremity ultrasound was obtained that did not demonstrate evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
She was also noted to have decreased movement of the left upper extremity and, although the etiology is not demonstrated on her prior imaging studies, this may reflect a small subcortical infarction.
In regards to nutrition, the patient received tube feeds through most of her hospital stay, and a swallowing evaluation was performed during which the patient frankly aspirated; this led to the placement of a PEG tube.
The patient should continue on tube feeds and may benefit from a swallowing study in the future.
An ENT evaluation was obtained to insure that the patient did not have evidence of vocal cord paralysis.
While intubated, she was noted to have excessive secretions and this led to a bronchoscopy and broncho-alveolar lavage that demonstrated many PMNs and Gram positive cocci.
A repeat head CT scan was obtained to rule out possible mass effect from edema, and there did not appear to be increased mass effect to account for her slightly increased lethargy.
An infectious work-up was obtained for additional causes of her lethargy and there is no evidence of ongoing infection.
Metoprolol 25 mg per PEG twice a day to be held for heart rate less than 55, for blood pressure less than 110.
Valproic levels should be checked q. week as a trough level, and the patient's amylase, liver function tests should be followed approximately every two weeks.
The patient's abdominal examination should be closely followed.
