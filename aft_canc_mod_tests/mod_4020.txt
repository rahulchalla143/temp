ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year old man who was seen in the Thoracic [**Hospital **] Clinic for evaluation of his esophageal adenocarcinoma which was found after he had initially presented in late [**2177-11-15**] with emesis and pancreatitis which were thought to be related to alcohol abuse.
At the time, he underwent an EGD which showed Grade 4 ulcerative esophagitis with severe dysplasia.
His weight was 142.8 lb.
He was otherwise afebrile with a pulse of 78, blood pressure of 140/88 and O2 saturation of 98 percent on room air.
Thoracic examination was unremarkable with clear breath sounds bilaterally.
Neurologically, his exam was unremarkable.
When he initially presented, his white count was 6 with a hematocrit of 45.
Platelets were 422.
His BUN and creatinine were 23 and 1.1.
His CEA was 2.0 and PSA was 2.4.
His PET-CT scan demonstrated a small focus of FDG uptake in the mid esophagus without any evidence of distant metastasis.
There was no note of intraoperative complication or excessive blood loss and the patient underwent a total esophagectomy which was thoracoscopically and laparoscopically assisted with an esophagoscopy and jejunostomy placement by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] and by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
His rate and blood pressures were controlled with low doses of Lopressor.
At the time he was evaluated, cardiac enzymes were sent but these were negative and therefore it was felt that he could safely continue his low dose Lopressor.
From a GI perspective, the patient was felt to do well in the initial postoperative period but during the first postoperative week, he developed a fever and there was a concern that there may be a small esophageal leak.
This was managed conservatively with broad spectrum antibiotics and the patient actually did undergo an esophagoscopy which did not evidence any visible leak and the anastomosis looked good during the esophagoscopy.
The swallow evaluation showed that he can take thick liquids and solids and soft solids.
His BUN and creatinine remained stable and he had excellent urine output throughout his hospitalization.
From an Infectious Disease standpoint, there was concern for an esophageal leak one week after the patient's surgery, given the fact that he had spiked temperatures to 102 degrees along with a rising white count which had been as high as 26.
Eventually, search for an infectious source led to CT scan of the neck, chest and abdomen which again showed no evidence of abscess or any sort of fluid collection.
There was a question of trace gallbladder wall thickening but the patient's LFTs were checked and these were all normal and he otherwise had no subjective complaints and no findings of pain on physical examination.
Therefore, this was not felt to likely be the source, but during the patient's second and third postoperative week, he remained essentially afebrile although he did still have moderate leukocytosis with a white count of 20 and 0 bands.
By the time of discharge, the patient's white count was 20.1 with a hematocrit of 38.3 and a platelet count of 867.
His urine was otherwise unremarkable and did not evidence any sort of infection.
In terms of his electrolytes, his BUN and creatinine were 22 and 0.9 prior to discharge.
