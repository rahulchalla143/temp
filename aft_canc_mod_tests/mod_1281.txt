Echo [**9-1**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF ?35%) with septal hypokinesis (the anterior wall and apex are not fully visualized).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-8-14**], findings are similar.
CXR [**9-4**]: The pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and right ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 75yo F with PMH of critical AS, systolic heart failure (EF 30%), complete heart block s/p pacemaker, hypothyroidism, aggressive B cell lymphoma s/p multiple rounds of reduced CHOP and many admissions over the past few months for dyspnea and decompensated heart failure in the setting of fluid resuscitation for chemotherapy and transfusions, who presented with [**Known lastname 9140**] dyspnea on exertion.
Her hemodynamic status was tenuous, as small fluid boluses to increase her blood pressure and improve her renal perfusion (to treat her actue renal failure) would lead to [**Known lastname 9140**] respiratory status.
Her blood pressures ranged sbp 70-100 and she had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] confusion, consistent with delirium.
