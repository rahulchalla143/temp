On [**2134-9-25**] she had an echocardiogram and began treatment with [**Hospital1 **].
She had an LP done on [**10-1**], which was positive for disease.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-10-29**], the findings are similar.
Abnormal septal motion was seen on the prior study also.
[**11-18**] CT torso: read pending at time of discharge, will be followed up at outpatient appt on Monday [**11-22**]   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 52**] is a 63-year-old woman with recurrent Burkitt's lymphoma who is D+15 of [**Hospital1 **] admitted from an OSH with hypotension and neutropenia after a syncopal episode at home.
She was fluid resuscitated to SBP of 70s by EMS and SBP of 90's by OSH ED prior to transfer.
Blood cultures were drawn and she was given cefepime and vanco and transferred to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**].
OSH cultures came back as VRE 1:4 bottles, sensitive to ampicillin, daptomycin, levofloxacin, and linezolid.
She was switched to ampicillin on [**10-12**] and her PICC was pulled.
She was switched to daptomycin on Monday [**2134-10-18**] because she had begun receiving hyper CVAD part B and amp interferes with clearance of methotrexate.
She had a TTE and TEE which showed no vegetations.
As she was being treated for the bacteremia, Ms. [**Known lastname 52**] again became hypotensive and febrile, requiring transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she required pressors.
Blood cultures were sent and ultimately returned positive with pseudomonas, believed to be associated with her central line.
An LP with intrathecal chemotherapy was performed on [**2134-10-14**].
LPs on [**11-18**], and [**11-11**] were negative for malignant cells.
She underwent MRI of her R shoulder which confirmed this finding and had 4 sessions of XRT as a palliative therapy.
Pt had CT of torso to evaluate for progression of disease, read at the time of discharge was pending but will be followed up at follow-up appointment Monday following discharge when pt will return for chemotherapy gemcitabine and vinorelbine.
Tachycardia was sinus in nature, up into the 140s with movement, and was attributed to an underlying cardiomyopathy (EF 45-50% on echo, last on [**10-29**]).
An ultrasound of the arm was repeated and was negative for clot.
