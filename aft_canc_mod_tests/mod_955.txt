Most of the ulcers were small and clean based.There was one large ulcer in the incisura, which was likely the source of bleeding and seen during the last endoscopy and had been previously injected and cauterized.
#GIB: Most likely cause for GI bleeding is gastric lymphoma, considering the malignant aspect of the lesion on prior endoscopy and worsening CT scan of the abdomen showing worsening retroperitoneal masses.
The patient underwent EGD and clipped/injected again ([**2-17**]).
He was initially maintained on a PPI infusion, which was changed to Protonix 40 [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
He received a total of 3 [**Location **] while in the ICU and his Hct stabilized.
A surgical evaluation confirmed that this patient is a poor surgical candidiate and that in the event of a re-bleed, angio would be the ideal modality for treatment.
In setting of high risk procedure and pt's wishes to not continue with further XRT and invasive procedures or surgery, no further EGD or gastric biopsies done.
His troponins peaked at .41 and trended down .31 prior to discharge.
