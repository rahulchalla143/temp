Echo: EF 30-35%, 2+MR, 3+TR, 1+AR.
[**4-24**] CT head: 1.
If high clinical suspicion, MRI would be more sensitive evaluation.
[**4-27**] CT abdomen/pelvis: 1.
Filling defects within the right colon seen on prior examination no longer visualized and likely represented stool that has passed in the interim.

She was found to have a lobulated mass in the cecum and ascending colon on CT torso and [**2-12**] blood cx bottles growing G+ cocci.
In the MICU, her blood cultures have grown 2/4 bottles of G+ Cocci, ucx negative.
Her abdominal CT showed lobulated mass in the cecum and ascending colon concerning for carcinoma.
Of note she was transfused with 1 unit of PRBCs for Hct of 24 with minimal response but no evidence of acute blood loss/hemolysis.
[**4-11**] blood cultures grew Gemella, unable to perform sensitivies.
All surveillance cultures were negative to date.
All other cultures were negative.
First CT showed a lobulated mass that was concerning for plasmacytoma vs. lymphoma vs. primary colon CA.
Blood pressures have been within normal limits; will slowly add back cardiac medications (atenolol, furosemide) and *gentle* diuresis as blood pressure tolerates.
TTE on [**3-24**] demonstrated decreased ejection fraction of 30-35% and biventricular hypokinesis.
At the time of discharge, a mixing study was pending; this should be followed up as an outpatient.
During the hospitalization, the patient complained of double vision; her cranial nerve exam was otherwise unremarkable.
CT head showed no evidence of mass, infection, or infarct to explain the findings.
Last iron studies ([**2136-3-8**]) consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
EKG showed resolution of T-wave and non-specific EKG changes.
Continued on insulin sliding scale, with close monitoring of blood glucose levels.
