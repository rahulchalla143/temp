She was given 1L NS on the night of admission and her Na trended down from 116->114.
Urine lytes then showed a patter consistent with SIADH.
She was then placed back on a fluid restriction, salt tabs and started on Lasix 20mg PO daily to reduce her medullary concentration gradient and her Na remained in the high 120s to low 130s.

CT chest/abdomen/pelvis on [**2114-5-22**] showed some improvement in disease burden, sugegsting that zelboraf is still eficacious in this patient.
If sodium level is above 132, please continue current medication regimen and check chem7 every 7 days to monitor her hyponatremia.
If sodium level is below 132, please consider restarting lasix and 20mg PO daily, then recheck sodium on [**2114-5-26**], then every 3 days until stable, and then every 1 week.
