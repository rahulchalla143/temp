Heart rate had been fast and pounding.
Took his pulse and noted it to be rapid and so activated EMS.
The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
In the ED, initial vitals were BP 118/92, RR 16, O2 99% on 2L NC.
The patient's exam was notable for bilateral wheezing and the patient was pale and ill-appearing.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] initial EKG was sinus tachycardia with a shortened  PR interval and a rate of 104 with no ischemic ST changes noted.
TTE Echo was performed which showed no evidence of pericardial tamponade, pulsus measured between 6-8mmHg on 2 occasions.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 10 cm.
PULSES:  Right Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ and Left Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: [**2138-9-20**] Admission LABS : GLUCOSE-79 UREA N-7 CREAT-0.5 SODIUM-137 POTASSIUM-5.0 CHLORIDE-100 TOTAL CO2-29 ANION GAP-13 and CBC: WBC-13.9* RBC-3.65* HGB-9.9* HCT-29.5* PLT 358 MCV-81* MCH-27.1 MCHC-33.6 RDW-18.0*  [**2138-9-20**]  Admission EKG: EKG showed sinus tachycardia with normal axis, normal intervals, no hypertrophy, no delta wave, small q-wave in III, PR depression in I, II and J-point elevation in V1, V2.
[**2138-9-20**] TTE 2D-[**Month/Day/Year **]: EF 50-55%, trivial pericardial effusion, moderate TR, mild pulm HTN, no tamponade.
[**2138-9-20**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS: No evidence of pulmonary embolism, Left lower lobe airspace disease with air bronchograms consistent with pneumonia, Bilateral loculated pleural effusions, Marked left-sided pleural thickening and a large loculated left subpulmonic effusion.
A separate hilar mass is felt to be less likely, but correlation with previous outside studies would be useful.
Given the patient's history, follow-up evaluation in [**2-20**] months to document stability is advised.

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-9-19**], the effusion may be slightly larger.
Serial evaluation is suggested.
[**2138-9-25**] REPEAT TTE : Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-9-22**], the pericardial effusion is more circumferential, but still primarily anterior to the RV.
Compared to the previous tracing left atrial abnormality is new.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-9-25**], the findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course: In summary, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of Hodgkins Lymphoma diagnosed in [**2127**] who was recently diagnosed with mesothelioma in [**2138-5-18**] after confirmatory biopsy at [**Hospital1 112**] /[**Company 2860**].
ABNORMAL RHYTHM: The patient's differential included aVNRT, WPW given his short PR interval on EKG and family history.
Initiallly, the main differential of his SVT was felt to be a form of AVNRT vs.AVRT.
He had a breakthrough episode of SVT on [**2138-9-27**] and his HR rose into the 160s range for less than 5 minutes.
Following this event the EP team was consulted for further review of the patient's EKGs and telemetry strips and felt that this SVT was a 2:1 atrial tachycardia with aberrancy and was slightly slower than the more rapid SVT the patient had experienced after admission.
The patient advised he will need to have follow-up LFTs and PFTs as part of his outpatient follow-up now that he is on Amiodarone.
EKG was suggestive of 2:1 atrial flutter.
Repeat TTE studies showed that his baseline pericardial effusion appeared more circumferential, but still remained primarily anterior to the RV.
Prior to cardioversion, anesthesia was called and the patient was sedated and given Propofol and Midazolam prior to intubation for airway protection and comfort as the patient was extremely anxious and respirations were in the 30s.
The patient became very sedated with low RR and repeat ABG showed a respiratory acidosis with pH 7.17 and pCO2 101.
The patient responded well and ABG trends improved and respiration rate climbed to appropriate range with ventilation assistance.
The patient's cyclobenzaprine and ativan doses were held and tubefeeds were supplemented for nutrition.
The patient had excellent urine output and self-diuresis s/p extubation and did not require any additional Lasix.
An ABG showed hypercarbia.
It was felt that a bipap titration could be performed, allowing him to be discharged to home with bipap at night and during the day while at rest.
ABG on [**9-30**] showed a pH of 7.16 and CO2 100.
PNEUMONIA: The patient's above respiratory distress was felt to be multi-factorial with contributing underlying poor lung reserve at baseline given his mesothelioma alongside a newly recognized LLL pneumonia on CT and CXR as well as his extreme anxiety and tendency toward tachypnea.
Further workup included sputum gram stain and culture, PCP smear, fungal culture , urine legionella antigen,and blood cultures.
MESOTHELIOMA: Based on above outlined chest CT and CXR results it is unclear whether that patient has progression of his underlying Mesothelioma process in light of overlying changes secondary to new PNA and infiltrates which may account for soem of the effusions on imaging.
The patient will plan to follow-up with his oncologist at [**Company 2860**] to discuss additional PET / CT scans and to manage his ongoing chemotherapy.
Of note, the oncology team felt that the patient's lung CT changes and decompensated respiratory status requiring intubation and cardiac ectopy was unlikely secondary to any drug/chemotherapy regimen.
An ultrasound was done which showed no underlying abscesses to be drained.
Additional DVT was ruled out by ultrasound as well.
UTI: At admission the patient had a routine UA done which showed WBC [**11-6**] with  trace leukocytes and negative nitrates but moderate bacteria was noted.
Follow-up urine culture was negative.
Goal potassium was >4 to avoid any additional pro-arrhythmic effects.
C. difficile studies were negative.
He was thus transferred to [**Hospital1 112**]/[**Company 2860**] for further oncologic care.
All test results to date and paperwork sent to [**Hospital1 112**]/[**Company 2860**] upon transfer.
Bismuth Subsalicylate 262 mg/15 mL Suspension Sig: Fifteen (15) ML PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for heartburn/indigestion.
Discharge Instructions: You had rapid heart rate called suprventricular tachycardia that was not controlled on the Metoprolol dose you were on.
This medicine will be managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and there are lung and blood tests that you will need in the next few weeks.
You also had a left lower lobe pneumonia shown on chest x-ray and an elevated white blood cell count and you were treated with antibiotics.
