Patient had a colonoscopy [**2185-4-29**] as part of an evaluaton for anemia which showed grade 1 internal hemorrhoids, a polyp that was removed via polypectomy and a cecal angioectesia that was treated via thermal therapy.
Labs were checked at her nursing home, which showed an elevated WBC of 16.
On the morning of her ED presentation the patient had a a bloody bowel movement with several large maroon colored whole blood clots that were passed.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**], HR 96.8, BP 163/114, HR 89, 99% on RA.
A CT scan was obtained which initially was read as only having diverticulosis.
The patient spiked a temperature of 102F at one point but then had fairly normal temperatures.
A chest x-ray showed a question of a retrocardiac opacity, so the patient was given levofloxacin/vancomycin in ED for PNA coverage.
The patient's hematocrit was stable from baseline.

After several large bloody stools/clots passed on [**4-25**] she had Hct drop to 21 which prompted MICU transfer.
She then needed 5 total units blood and 3+ liters of IVFs to correct her hypotension which reached a nadir of 50/palpation.
She was monitored closely in the ICU and her hematocrit recovered to 28-30 range again where she has remained since that time.
Hematocrits were intially checked q6-8 hours, then spaced to q12 hours and then qdaily as she had no signs of re-bleeding for days and her hematocrit has remained stable.
# Hypotension: Ms. [**Known lastname 34601**] has now fully recovered from a brief drop in her blood pressures in the acute setting of her GI bleed earlier in her hospital course.
#Leukocytosis:  Ms. [**Known lastname 34601**] had an isolated fever in the ED to 102F and a WBC count of 16 with a left shift noted at time of her admission.
She was placed on a few days of oral Vancomycin alongside IV Flagyl briefly but after two C. difficile stool studies returned negative these were stopped.
She was continued on PO Flagyl however after a CT done [**5-7**] noted some area that was consistent with mild diverticulitis.
After repeat CT Abdomen done [**5-15**] showed again mild diverticulitis she was started on a 7 day course of Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl, her last day should be [**2185-5-23**].
PNA was essentially ruled out as she had no cough or oxygen requirement and repeated CXRs showed no opacities.
A positive E.Coli UTI was discovered for which she was given IV Ceftriaxone x 7 days; completed on [**2185-5-16**].
CT Abdomen/pelvis had also revealed some necrotic, older fibroids which may be promoting WBC elevations.
Final CT abdomen read on repeat imaging done [**5-15**] showed a fat-containing mass anterior to the right psoas muscle.
Infectious workup to explain her elevated WBC count was largely unrevealing.
#Hypertension: Initially she had low to normotensive blood pressures and as above she became hypotensive in setting of GI bleeding so her usual HCTZ BP medication were held.
#Pelvic Mass: CT noted multiple degenerating fibroids with exophytic necrotic characteristics which were concerning.
Follow-up pelvic US done and also confirmed right adnexal mass and fibroids as above.
She needs follow-up imaging in [**7-4**] weeks with MRI or CT along with a gynecology outpatient follow-up which has been arranged for early [**Month (only) **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 34602**].
#Urinary Tract Infection: As above, she had an E.Coli UTI during this hospital stay which was treated for 7 days with IV Ceftriaxone, therapy ended on [**5-16**] and she has had no additional complaints of frequency , dysuria or suprapubic tenderness on exam.
#Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition: Advanced diet slowly from NPO to clear liquids and then to regular diet which she has been tolerating well.

You had worsening bleeding that caused some drop in your blood pressures and you needed blood transfusions and IVFs to stabilize your blood pressure.
The gastrointestinal team was called and you underwent a colonoscopy which was unable to show the exact source of your bleeding although the team felt it was from a lower abdominal source.
Several lab studies were done and imaging studies were done to try to find specific reasons for your high white blood cell counts but were normal.
Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2664**] .
**You should have a repeat CBC in 1 week to follow your white blood cell count.
