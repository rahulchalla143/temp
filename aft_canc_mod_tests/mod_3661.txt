Pathology (Skin path and immunoflouresence), [**2112-8-18**] 1.
Imaging: CXR ([**8-17**]) FINDINGS: Bilateral lung volumes are low.
TTE ([**8-18**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %), with regional variation.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CT Chest Abd Pelvis ([**8-18**]): 1.
CT chest ([**8-22**]): 1.
CXR ([**8-30**]): IMPRESSION: Worsening left pleural effusion and complete left lower lobe atelectasis.
CT chest ([**9-6**]): IMPRESSION: As compared to [**2112-8-22**], the pre-existing right upper lobe opacity is in the course of organization.
Overall, the examination is limited by respiratory motion artifacts.
U/S LUE ([**9-9**]): FINDINGS: A focused ultrasound examination was performed at the site of clinical concern in the right wrist.
CXR ([**9-13**]): Low lung volumes with increased right lower lobe atelectasis.
CXR ([**9-13**]): Increased left perihilar and stable right perihilar consolidations versus edema.
CT Chest w/o contrast ([**9-13**]): As compared to the previous examination, there are newly appeared right lower lobe opacities and a slightly more extensive left lower lobe opacity.
CT neck without contrast ([**9-13**]): There is no evidence of an exophytic mucosal mass.
Compared to the study on [**2112-8-5**], there is a new 2.3 cm x 1.8 cm x 2.1 cm enlarged left level 2, without evidence of necrosis or surrounding inflammatory change.
There is bilateral pulmonary opacities, described in the concurrent chest CT report.
CT Sinus without contrast ([**9-13**]): 1.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-8-29**], the overall left ventricular systolic function appears to have minimally improved, although the previously reported ejection fraction may have been an underestimate.
The absence of valvular vegetations/abscesses on transthoracic echocardiogram does not preclude its presence.
Limited mobile examination without cholelithiasis.
The line length is 15 cm.
[**9-22**] CT Abdomen and Pelvis w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**10-3**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION: Since [**2112-9-13**], bilateral multifocal pneumonia and ground glass opacification as well as bilateral lower lobes opacities representing either atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia have decreased.
[**10-3**] CT head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process .
[**10-6**] CT Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Interval increase in patchy ground-glass opacities throughout the upper lung zones since the [**2112-10-3**] CT examination concerning for worsening multifocal pneumonia.
[**10-9**] CT Chest: Multifocal ground-glass opacities and pulmonary consolidation in the upper lobes are unchanged.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-9-15**], the findings are similar  [**10-14**] CXR Left porta catheter and dual-lumen right central line catheter end in the upper right atrium.
Bilateral lung volumes are low.
There are no new lung opacities of concern  [**10-16**] Left foot biopsy Pan-dermal hemorrhage with focal organizing thrombus formation  [**10-19**] CXR In comparison with the study of [**10-16**], the tip of the endotracheal tube measures approximately 5 cm above the carina.
There is also a more focal area of opacification in the right upper and left mid zone, worrisome for possible supervening infection  [**10-20**] EKG Atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular rate of 160 beats per minute.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2112-10-19**] no diagnostic interval change.
[**10-21**] Rt Wrist Biopsy Abundant intravascular and interstitial fungal hyphae with thrombosis and secondary ischemic subepidermal bulla (see note).
[**10-22**] CT Sinus Interval increase in degree of sinus disease, with mucosal thickening and secretions present in the ethmoid air cells and nasal cavity, along with mucosal thickening increased in the bilateral maxillary sinuses.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax  [**10-23**] Left groin biopsy Skin and subcutaneous tissue, left thigh, biopsy: Necrotic skin and panniculus with abundant Gram positive bacterial cocci and thrombosed blood vessels (see note).
[**10-24**] MRI Rt wrist 1.
Serpiginous bone marrow signal abnormalities involving the base of the first metacarpal, distal radius and portions of the distal ulna, concerning for bone infarctions given the history of infectious vascular invasion  [**10-28**] CXR There are low lung volumes.
Blood, stool, and urine cultures were all sent and negative.
He was treated with linezolid, but due to extremely poor vascular access, HD and left PICC lines were not removed, but were treated with daptomycin locks.
Blood cultures cleared VRE by [**10-17**].
Unfortunately, during this time, a bullous right wrist lesion was noted to be expanding, and biopsy and MRI were consistent with invasive mucormycosis.
Additionally, further skin biopsies showed VRE growing within left groin lesion.
This was attributed to PNA seen on chest CT as well as metabolic acidosis secondary to renal failure.
Surveillance CMV viral loads demonstrated a marked jump in his CMV viral load to [**Numeric Identifier 58169**], and patient was changed to foscarnet due to likely resistance to ganciclovir.
CMV viral load on [**10-26**] was [**2091**].
CT torso to knees did not show evidence of necrotizing fascitis.
Two 4mm punch biopsies showed occlusive thrombotic vasculopathy, consistent with a scalded skin reaction, and his infection was initially treated with Vancomycin, but switched to daptomycin because of vamcomycin-associated [**Last Name (un) **].
Biopsy showed invasive mucormycosis.
MRI was suggestive of marrow infarction along with significant invasive diesease.
He was treated with ambisome and CT of sinus showed no evidence of maxillofacial disease, and BAL showed no sign of pulmonary disease.
Biopsy of left groin lesion showed VRE but no evidence of mucor.
PNA: Shortly after the patient's admission, he was noted to have signs of PNA on CXR and CT.
CXR [**8-30**] showed RUL infiltrate and LLL collapse.
Subsequent BAL on [**10-20**] and [**10-26**] showed no evidence of infection despite persistent consolidations and hypoxemia.
ENT was consulted and perrformed a scan and biopsy/ culture of sinuses.
He received numerous platelet transfusions to maintain platelet count >30.
By HD13 he had a Cr of 3.4 and was found to have a pH of 7.30.
As his blood pressures became lower, he was again transitioned to CRRT.
He received 2 units PRBC at OSH and his hct remained stable on admission.
Initial hemolysis labs were negative and there was no evidence of DIC.
His Hct improved initially, but declined as hospital stay continued, likely due to severe disease and recurrent bleeding.
Blood pressures remained stable during these episodes, and were treated with IV nodal agents as needed.
Fluid balance was attempted to be controlled by HD/UF and CRRT with poor results.
Na on [**10-28**] was 127.
