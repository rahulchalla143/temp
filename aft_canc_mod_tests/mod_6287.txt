Patient initially presented to [**Hospital6 **] with increased dyspnea, bedside TTE showed no pericardial eff, new ARF, with creatinine of 1.4 and k of 7.
VS initially in our ED were: T 97.2 HR 83 BP 105/63 RR 20 O2sat 100% on 2L NC.
Then , in our ED she felt acutely dizzy with BP 85/56 HR 106 AF and complained of SOB with RR 36 and O2 sat 100% on 4L NC.
CXR showed bilateral basilar infiltrates/effusions and she received one dose of zosyn.K was 6.2 and she received insulin and dextrose as well as calcium.
Repeat K was 5.9.
A bedside TTE showed no pericardial effusion.
VS prior to transfer to the floor were T 98.2 HR 105 BP 96/54 RR 19 100% on NRB .
Past Medical History: - Metastatic endometrial CA with lung metastases and recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions requiring QOD drainage via pleurex catheter - Upper extremity dvts on fondaparinux - Afib with RVR .
She had an endometrial biopsy which showed poorly differentiated cancer.
She underwent on [**2187-4-24**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2028**] an exploratory laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, total pelvic lymphadenectomy, periaortic lymph node resection and infracolic omentectomy and biopsies.
Omental biopsy was negative.
On the CT scan followup in [**2-/2188**], the patient had an  interval development of multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules associated with significant mediastinal adenopathy and left axillary adenopathy.

Micro: Urine culture pending DFA influenza: inadequate sample.
Respiratory viral cx pending.. Urine legionella Ag negative  Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 55yo F with h/o metastatic endometrial CA complicated by bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion requiring intermittent drainage via pleuradex catheter and bilateral upper extremity DVTs on fondaparinux and O2 (1L NC) at home admitted with SOB, ARF, Afib with RVR.
SOB: Initially CXR showed right-sided infiltrates worse from prior and concerning for HCAP vs aspiration PNA.
Pt maintained SBP in 110s overnight.
Therefore it was thought her ARF was multifactorial including pre-renal azotemia, supported by urine lytes, and contrast nephropathy.
A renal US also noted new right hdrynephrosis which was conerning to be related to pelvic massess and obstruction - it was unilateral  #.
