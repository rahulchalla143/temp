Head CT was apparently unchanged from prior imaging (showed left cerebellar encephalomalacia and evidence of atrophy by my read) and INR was 1.8.
He received 325 mg ASA x 1 and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Past Medical History: -Afib on warfarin -Reports 3 strokes in past, unclear  nature -CAD/CABG ~15 years ago -AAA s/p likely CEA many years ago -Anemia- recent GIB at [**Location (un) **] with Hct drop to 21 in setting of INR ~8.
Had EGD and colonoscopy with a possible mass at right hepatic flexure by one document, extent of bleeding not clear -Cholangiocarcinoma, s/p biliary stent [**9-29**] -Prostate cancer s/p resection and XRT   Social History: Lives with wife.

Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo man with a complicated PMH including Afib on coumadin, prior strokes, vasculopathy (s/p right CEA, CABG, AAA), malignancy (prostate cancer s/p resection and XRT, cholangiocarcinoma s/p biliary stent with possible metastatic disease, as well as colonic mass path pending), hypothyroidism, now off coumadin since [**2-27**] after a recent GIB with a Hct of 20 in the setting of significantly supratherapeutic INR ~8, who presents today with 5 discrete episodes of a non-fluent aphasia with reported return to baseline between events.
His INR at the outside hospital was subtherapeutic this afternoon at 1.8 and he was somewhat hypotensive there.
General exam reveals a systolic ejection murmur and bilateral lower extremity edema.
Neurological exam including language was normal, with the exception of slight right NLFF.
His MRI did not show any evidence of stroke.
His MRA showed mild-to-moderate atherosclerotic disease with probable ulcerated plaque at the left internal carotid origin.
The neurology resident witnessed a few of these episodes which were preceded by tachycardia on telemetry, otherwise no aura, characterized by abrupt onset of expressive aphasia during which he could only stutter syllables but no words, though comprehension was intact, vital signs normal, and remainder of neurological examination normal.
He proceded to have a cluster of at least five of these within a few hours, which were all stereotyped, and so after speaking to his [**Hospital3 **] Gastroenterologist who felt that his bloody bowel mvts were most likely related to hemorrhoids rather then the hepatic flexure polyp, we decided that the risk-benefit ration was in favor of anticoagulation for these presumed TIAs in the context of his vasculopathy to prevent stroke and so we started him on a Heparin drip with goal INR 50-70.
He had some mild BRPBR but vital signs were stable and Hct was slowly trending downward.
He eventually required transfer to the ICU after his Hct dropped further.
He developed fluid overload and was transferred to the cardiology floor for diuresis prior to GI surgery, which was acheived with IV lasix.
ECHO showed severe aortic stenosis with moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation, mild focal LV systolic dysfunction, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and massive biatrial enlargement.
On [**3-19**] he went to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, open cholecystectomy and his care was transferred to the general surgical service.
He was fluid resuscitated for hypotension and low urine outbut and was continued on lopressor IV for heart rate control.
His chest xray showed some increasing right pleural effusion.
On POD 8 ([**3-27**]), the ICU team performed a thoracentesis of his R pleural effusion with 800cc withdrawn.
His vital signs remained stable and he was able to get out of bed to the chair daily.
