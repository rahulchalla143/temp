#[**2132-10-12**] CT HEAD IMPRESSION:  No CT evidence for acute intracranial abnormality.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-1-1**], the findings are similar.
# [**10-15**] CTA CHEST 1.
# [**10-15**] TRANSTHROACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior complete study (images reviewed) of [**2132-10-14**], visualization of the right ventricle is suboptimal.
Left ventricular systolic function is more vigorous.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
On HD3, he was somnolent / confused, so an LP was done on [**10-9**].
CSF studies revealed elevated protein, concerning for viral / aseptic meningitis.
He was started on foscarnet empirically on [**10-10**], but this was stopped when CSF studies came back negative for HHV6.
CSF studies were negative for HHV6, EBV, HSV.
# Ph + ALLO s/p double cord transplant: On Protocol #11-085, reduced intensity conditioning with fludarabine, melphalan, and low dose TBI followed by double umblical cord blood SCT (D 0 [**2132-7-2**]).
- Scheduled bone marrow biopsy from [**10-8**] revealed no evidence of leukemia but hypocellular marrow with erythroid & megakaryocytic dyspoiesis  # Pancytopenia:  Chronic pancytopenia likely due to hypoproliferation and recurrent infections.
CT head was negative for hemorrhage.
Lumbar puncture was performed.
CSF studies were positive for elevated protein, consistent with possible aseptic meningitis, so he was started on foscarnet, but was discontinued when CSF HHV6 was confirmed negative.
