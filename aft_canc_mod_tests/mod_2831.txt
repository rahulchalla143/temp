Echo [**6-7**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
These are unchanged from prior CTA obtained [**2174-6-8**].
ECG: Atrial fibrillation Multifocal atrial rhythm Since previous tracing of [**2174-6-7**], irregular supraventricular rhythm seen  [**2174-6-13**] Cytology PLEURAL FLUID pending  CXR [**6-14**]: Compared with [**2174-6-13**] there is considerable interval clearing of the pulmonary edema and the pulmonary vascular engorgement.
Flow cytometry on peripheral blood: The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR, FMC-7, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 3, 5, 10, 19, 20, 23, 45.
RESULTS: Three-color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield.
Pt still occasionally spikes fevers but blood, urine and pleural fluid cultures have been negative.
Abd/pelvis ct was performed for staging.
We considered adding beta-blockade although there is some quetion of whether he also is in wenckebach [**Date range (1) 61876**] although official ekg read as afib w/ multifocal atrial rhythm.
b) pump: echo shows normal ef, decreased E/A ratio == dialstolic heart failure, pulmonary hypertension.
Creatinine is 1-1.1 at baseline.
