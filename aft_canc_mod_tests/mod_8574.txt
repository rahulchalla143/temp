[**2130-5-24**] TTE - The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**2130-6-4**] CXR -  As compared to the previous radiograph [**2130-5-31**], there is a mild increase in both cardiac dimensions and caliber of the intrapulmonary vessels.
AFib w/ RVR - The patient required trasnfer from the floor to the ICU on the afternoon of [**6-4**] when he developed AFib with RVR 130 - 140's in the setting of volume overload; he received diltiazem 20 mg IV x 2 with improved HR to the 110-120's, however he became hypotensive reportedly to a systolic in the 80's -90's.
On the morning of [**2130-6-6**] he became acutely tachycardic to the 140's -150's, was given IV dilt 10mg with improvement in HR to the 120's-130's, asymptomatic with BP stable throughout.
He again had to be transferred to the ICU when further Dilt pushes did not achieve adequate control on the floor.
Fever: The patient was started on levaquin empirically for low-grade fever, but blood, urine, and sputum culture data from [**6-4**] were unrevealing.
Glucosamine 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] 13.
Nephrolithiasis 7.
Retinal detachment [**6-/2129**] 8.
Psoriasis 10.
