Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2189-11-30**]):       REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Female First Name (un) 21956**] @2032 ON [**2189-11-29**].
ECRP: Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal Contents: Scar tissue and small amout of fresh red blood was seen in the incisura of the stomach.
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal Major Papilla: A single periampullary diverticulum with small opening was found at the major papilla.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-5-30**], a very small echogenic mass is seen on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve which may represent a torn chordal structure; however, cannot exclude small vegetation with certainty.
In addition, his PTT and INR began to increase and it was thought he developed DIC.
His Culture data from OSH was reported on [**11-29**] growing gram + cocci and gram - rods.
On [**11-29**] the patient's blood pressure had stabilized and he was taken off pressors and extubated.
His labs on [**11-29**] were not consistent with DIC as his fibrinogen was elevated and he did not have increased fibrin split products.
A TTE was obtained as patient has enterococcal bacteremia and has known valvular disease.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Post ERCP the patient developed a rising creatinine from 1.4 to 1.8 while hypotensive.
His creatinine levels did not improve with fluid boluses, suggesting that his renal failure is not pre-renal, but rather an intrarenal process such as ATN.
His creatinine was down to 1.6 on discharge (baseline 1.4), he will continue on amlodipine as [**Last Name (un) **]/ACE not well tolerated in the past.
His hematocrit remained stable.
His troponin began to trend down by [**11-30**] and adding metoprolol was considered.
PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE: Probable underlying lymphoma in one of the gastric ulcers, stable on PPI, no further work-up planned at this time.
ENTEROCOCCAL BACTEREMIA AND MITRAL VALVE ENDOCARDITIS: Given enterococcal bacteremia a known structural heart disease, a surface echo was obtained.
