The patient stated that she was scheduled for a MRI later in the week of admission for preoperative evaluation prior to potential myomectomy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 97.6 F, heart rate 76, blood pressure 144/74 and respiratory rate 20.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Sterile speculum exam revealed normal external female genitalia, 50 cc of blood in the vaginal vault.
Bimanual exam revealed a large fibroid uterus pressing the cervix open 0.5 to 1 cm with a bulge in the anterior lower uterine segment.
LABORATORY:  White blood count 5.8, hematocrit 33.7, platelets 262,000, MCV 83.
Multiple masses, again, were seen within the uterus and the largest fibroid was located within the lower uterine segment measuring 6.5 by 6.5 cm.
Hematocrit higher than hematocrit measured in [**2174-5-23**] which equaled 30, however lower than [**2174-7-24**] which the patient stated was equal to 42.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the GYN Service for IV fluid hydration, IV Premarin treatment, serial hematocrit checks and pad count to further describe vaginal bleeding.
The hematocrit on hospital day #2 decreased to 29%.
Her hematocrit continued to be stable at that point.
MRI of the uterus was obtained which revealed leiomyomata infiltration of the uterus.
There was evidence of distention of the endometrial cavity filled with blood products.
The results of the study were discussed with the patient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2262**] and decision was made to undergo myomectomy.
Subsequently, the patient's hematocrit decreased from 30 to 24.5 and the decision was made to transfuse her two units of packed red blood cells the night prior to surgery.
The findings were a 20 week sized uterus with cervix dilated to 1 cm on exam under anesthesia.
Intraoperatively, multiple fibroids were submucosal and approximately half were removed through anterior classical incision.
Due to the amount of fluid the patient received intraoperative as well as the blood product, the patient was maintained, intubated and brought to the PACU.
In the PACU, the patient's coagulation studies and DIC panel revealed an INR equal to 2.1, fibrin degradation products equal to 10 to 40 and platelets of 111,000 with a small amount of bleeding continuing.
Overnight in the PACU, the patient received another two units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 23.9.
Postoperative, the patient had a fever spike to 101.7 F.  Chest x-ray was performed as well as blood cultures.
Urinalysis and urine cultures were sent.
Chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia and cultures were negative for any growth.
Her hematocrit continued to be stable throughout the rest of her stay and was 29.5 on discharge.
