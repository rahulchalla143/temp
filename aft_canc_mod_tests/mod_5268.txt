Had upper and lower endoscopy which was negative.
Received tagged red cell scan which lit up in area of thigh lesion, but no other abnormalities.
Had bone marrow biopsy to investigate etiology of anemia, was told initially that it was normal, but later informed that it was abnormal.

([**2148-6-13**]) CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lungs are fully expanded and clear.
([**2148-6-14**]) Abdominal U/S: 1.
However, for confirmation, when clinically feasible, a multiphasic CT or MR is recommended to evaluate further.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in the setting of tachycardia and hyperdynamic LV function.
([**2148-6-13**]): Bone Marrow Biopsy --FISH: An expanded population of myelomonocytic precursor with increased myeloblasts (12% of total events) is present.
Cytogenetic studies may be very helpful in further defining this condition since translocation of PDGFR is present in a fraction of CMML patients.
ID was consulted for work-up and management of fever/wound.
No other localizing sources for infection could be found, CXR/UA/Blood cultures were without growth.
- HEME/ONC: Bone Marrow biopsy showed myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic overlap syndrome.
Tumor lysis labs were monitored closely.
Pulmonology team was consulted, felt that hypoxia was mainly attributable to fluid overload based on Chest CT findings.
Biopsy was not performed, but OSH report was obtained by dermatology, and picture was consistent with expected inflammatory infiltrate.
ECHO showed preserved EF with dilated left atrium.
Chest CT confirmed presence of fluid overload.
