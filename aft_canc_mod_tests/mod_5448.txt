Of note, he had recently received the 4th of a series of injections of a study drug to treat his recurrent meningiomas.
In ED: serum glu 1033, creatinine 1.9 (above baseline), was placed on insulin drip, IVFs and tranferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
In [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], head CT showed stable meningioma, continued Keppra 750 mg po BID (renally dosed); Piziritide (for his meningiomas) thought to be responsible for hyperglycemia [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]; Insulin drip stopped [**2201-7-6**], [**Last Name (un) **] recommended to keep on SSI (20U total today; highest glucose 323) for now without a fixed dose since it is thought to be drug related; He was seen by his neuro-oncologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] during the ICU stay.
Stereotactic biopsy consistent with possible grade II meningiomas (though some crush artifact, the MIB-1 was 16%, high for meningioma).

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-5-2**], heart rate is slower.
A head CT was performed and showed stable meningiomas.
#Hyperglycemia: Initially, the patient was started on an insulin drip for a blood sugar of 1033.
#Seizure prophylaxis: His Keppra was decreased to a lower dose in the setting of the acute kidney injury on admission, and was returned to his baseline dosing once his Creatinine returned to baseline (on discharge).
Echo done given h/o hypertension and to evaluate an aortic position murmur.
