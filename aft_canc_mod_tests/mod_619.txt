As part of his work-up, he was found to have metastatic disease in the liver of unknown primary on CT and ERCP confirmed an ulcerated necrotic mass.
In the ED, initial VS were: T98.8 P115 BP111/63 R20 O2 Sat 100%RA.
Labs revealed a WBC of 15.9 and a serum lactate of 6.0.
A CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrated constipation so he was disimpacted 700-800cc of guaiac positive brown stool.
A repeat lactate was 3.9.
Rectal: mild erythema around the anal verge, no ulceration Ext: cool, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: [**2185-2-6**] 07:40PM  CBC: WBC-15.9*# RBC-3.14*# Hgb-6.6*# Hct-23.4*# MCV-75*# MCH-20.9*# MCHC-28.1*# RDW-16.2* Plt Ct-441*  Diff: Neuts-84.9* Lymphs-11.4* Monos-3.5 Eos-0 Baso-0.1  Coags: PT-14.1* PTT-23.5 INR(PT)-1.2*  Chesmistries: Glucose-195* UreaN-62* Creat-1.6* Na-134 K-5.3* Cl-102 HCO3-17* AnGap-20 ALT-74* AST-71* AlkPhos-442* TotBili-0.4 Lipase-75* LD(LDH)-1163* Albumin-2.6* Calcium-7.7* Phos-2.5* Mg-2.1 freeCa-1.14  Iron Studies: Iron-18* calTIBC-346 Ferritn-72 TRF-266  Lactate Trend: [**2185-2-6**] 07:56PM BLOOD Lactate-6.0* [**2185-2-6**] 08:38PM BLOOD Lactate-6.3* [**2185-2-7**] 02:00AM BLOOD Lactate-3.9* [**2185-2-7**] 05:55AM BLOOD Lactate-2.5*  Micro: **FINAL REPORT [**2185-2-8**]**    MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2185-2-8**]):       POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS  Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2185-2-12**]):       ENTEROCOCCUS SP..

CT A/P [**2185-2-6**]: 1.
[**12-6**] blood cultures grew enterococcus sensitive to ampicillin and vancomycin.
It was thought that his bloodstream infection may have originated in his biliary tree vs a GI source.
He did undergo a TTE [**2-18**] which was unremarkable but a poor study.
# GI bleed/Iron deficiency Anemia: Patient has a baseline Hct in low-30's & MCV in mid-70's since [**2181**] by OMR records.
On admission patient with Hct below baseline to 23.4 and manual disimpaction revealed blood clots concerning for GI bleed.
Patient was tranfused 1U PRBC and his Hct increased appropriately.
EGD was planned, but later it was decided that an EGD was not needed given his goals of care, and overall prognosis.
He was given 2 more units of PRBC and his hematocrit was stable at 30 at his time of discharge.
# Malignancies: Patient with history of multiple malignancies including bladder, colon, and acoustic neuroma, now with report of an ulcerating necrotic mass seen on ERCP at OSH and a CT torso demonstrating multiple liver lesions, a large pericardial effusion, and stranding around the 2nd portion of the duodenum.
Oncology was consulted but given his poor performance status and multiple other co-morbities, they did not feel that systemic chemotherapy would not be recommended.
# AVNRT: Several episodes of AVNRT to HR 170s with BP 80-90s/50s-60s was noted when patient was sleeping.
A CCB was added with good effect.
Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4.
A Cr on admission was 1.6 and is 1.2 upon discharge.
On admissions, UA was negative and patient had no urinary symptoms.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 10 mL IV PRN line flush PICC, non-heparin dependent: Flush with 10 mL Normal Saline daily and PRN per lumen.
You also developed painful hemorrhoids which improved with steroid cream.
Given the slow decline of your blood count, this may be partially a result of frequent blood draws.
It was felt that further testing would be harmful to your health.
