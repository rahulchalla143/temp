EGD [**2150-5-26**] w/ gastritis/erosions; treated with PPI PO BID and repeat EGD [**2150-5-28**] showed interval improvement.
Sigmoidoscopy [**2150-5-26**] showed flecks of bled from unclear source.
Colonoscopy [**2150-5-28**] showed internal hemorrhoids and multiple sessile nonbleeding polyps 3-8 mm polyps in cecum, transverse, sigmoid, and rectum with granularity in cecum c/w polypoid tissue (biopsy showed focal hyperplastic changes, lymphoid aggregade and focal active inflamation with a few crypt abscesses).
Given recent right fem-posterior tibial bypass and right TMA c/b wound infection, he was covered with vanco/levo/flagyl and vascular surgery was consulted, who recommended right arterial duplex U/S.
His anticoagulation was changed from lepirudin to argatroban and he underwent a RLE arteriogram [**6-1**] which showed 80-99% stenosis at mid fem-posterior tibial argery graft; angioplasty performed X 2.
Given drop in HCT (26.3 from 33.1), drop in plt (33 from 106 on admit), argotroban was discontinued and hematology was consulted, who felt this was most likely secondary to septic physiology (no evidence of TTP or hemolysis).
Given [**1-7**] bcx [**6-4**] with coag negative staph, PM change was delayed until he finished 1 week course of vanco IV [**6-12**].
CVVH was not recommended, and patient was changed to bolus doses of chlorothiazide and furosemide with good effect.
His creatinine should continue to be followed to ensure stability.
4) Hypernatremia: At the time of transfer to the MICU, the patient's sodium was 150, likely secondary to aggressive diuresis.
His sodium will need to be monitored closely to ensure downward trend.
While anticoagulated, his hematocrit will need to be closely monitored given history of GI bleed, and current gauiac positive brown stool.
His Plavix and ASA were held with plan to restart once platelet count returns to baseline.
His drop in hematocrit (nadir 24) was likely due to acute GI bleed/ acute illness superimposed on chronic process (iron deficiency versus ACD).
He was started on erythropoietin (on darbopoietin as outpatient and his home iron was restarted.
His hematocrit will need to continue to be closely monitored as an outpatient to ensure stability.
Given multiple polyps in cecum, sigmoid colon, transverse colon, and rectum, the patient should have a repeat colonoscopy in [**2-8**] months off anticoagulation.
He was continued on his home dose of levothyroxine with a plan to recheck thyroid function tests as an outpatient once acute illness has resolved.
