ENT was consulted and a CT neck was obtained.
The patient received blood cultures and a swab of the left neck mass.

WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2105-9-15**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
Blood cultures: NO GROWTH .
IMAGING: CXR PA & LAT [**2105-9-12**] IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
CT NECK WITH CONTRAST [**2105-9-12**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Thyroid US [**2105-9-21**] IMPRESSION: Solitary 1.2 x 1.8 cm posterior mass in lower pole of right lobe of thyroid gland as was shown on recent CT scan.
# Left neck mass: Per aspiration Biopsy and PET-CT scan, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with multiple adjacent lymph nodes, involved hilar LN and pulmonary nodule.
Thyroid nodule US was done and given its posterior location FNA was not done.
Hgb on admission was 11.6 down to 8.4 on discharge.
No signs of active bleeding, vital signs were stable throughout her stay.
Head CT was negative for bleed.
# elevated blood pressures: this was noted on [**9-27**] with SBP to max of 190.
Transitional issues: - continue tube feeds - repeat CBC on [**9-30**] - to monitor WBC and Hct - Monitor vital signs daily - MD follow up at ECF.
- Pull foley on [**9-29**] for voiding trial - follow-up pathology results from biopsy on neck mass and pulmonary lesion - follow-up as below with oncology and radiation oncology - patient does not have a listed PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5001**] discharge home from rehab may call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1300**] to establish care at [**Hospital **] if interested.
You had an advanced imaging study that showed a mass next to your air-pipe concerning of a metastasis there.
We were concerned about your fall and therefore you had an CT scan of your head which showed no bleed.
