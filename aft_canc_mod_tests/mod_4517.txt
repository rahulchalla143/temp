At the OSH she was very agitated and combative, she was sedated and intubated to complete imaging studies and for airway protection.
A CT head at the OSH was negative, she had a fever to 101, found to be hypokalemic, hypomag and was given vanc/cefepime and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ER for further evaluation.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST: Large bowel and appendix as well as the uterus and adnexae appearing unremarkable.
Medications, toxic-metabolic disturbances and infections are common causes.
IF clinically indicated, a repeat routine EEG may be repeated once sedation is  lightened for further evaluation.
[**2108-7-13**] ECHO The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
A scant trace of fluid is seen in the perisplenic space.
At discharge: WBC: 8.8 H/H: 11.5/36.2 PLT: 816 ESR: 51   Brief Hospital Course: #) Hypotension/Shock: Presented with fever as well as abnormal cardiac enzymes and EKG consistent with [**Month/Day (4) **], as well as history of heave ETOH use.
#) [**First Name3 (LF) **]: EKG's have been evolving throughout her course, initial EKG at OSH showed sinus tach at 124bpm, with ST depressions in V2-V4, II, III, and she had negative cardiac enzymes at that time.
In our ER initial EKG showed ST elevations in V2-V3, and initial Troponin=0.46.
Her EKG again evolved to have STE in V2-V3 with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depressions in II, III, aVF as well.
Cardiac enzymes continued to trend up.
CE's peaked on HD 2 and ECHO showed hypokinesis in LAD distribution though some apical ballooning so takasubo also a concern.
Given sepsis and trend down in enzymes, cardiac cath recs were to determine the need for catheterization after pt was extubated.
Sputum culture grew strep pneumonia and given her penicillin allergy was given IV levofloxacin (not absorbing PO well), then transitioned to PO for total 10 day course.
Repeat CXR on [**7-22**] showed LLL PNA, but afebrile and decreasing leukocytosis.
#)Thrombocytosis: Etiology unclear, PLT wnl at admission, increased to 816 on day of discharge.
Thrombocytosis of unclear etiology 3.
Repeat CXR 6 weeks   Medications on Admission: Per OSH records: HCTZ 25mg daily Lovastatin 20mg daily Ativan 1mg [**Hospital1 **] Omeprazole 20mg daily  Discharge Medications: 1.
You were given fluids and medications to keep your blood pressure up in the intensive care unit.
