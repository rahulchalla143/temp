Other possible source given RUQ pain on exam would be hepato-biliary.
Cultures were sent, but with no clear source of infection.
RUQ ultrasound to evaluate liver/gallbladder showed no acute processes.
His oxygenation improved initially, as did his DIC parameters, after treatment with oxaliplatin and 5-FU.
His DIC parameters improved with transfusion of 2 bag of plts, 2U FFP, 5 IV Vit K, and 2x PRBCs and showed initial improvement after oxaliplatin and 5-FU in the ICU.
Hemoptysis His hemoptysis was most likely [**1-15**] alveolar hemorrhage from DIC given appearance on chest CT. Repeat cxr did not show progressive hemorrhage, but patient continued to have episodes of hemmoptysis.
Xray of the shoulder showed degenerative changes with no fractures.
