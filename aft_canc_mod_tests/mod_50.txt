She was admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] about 2 weeks ago to work up the falls and at that time had negative intracranial imaging (see detailed neurology note from [**2157-3-15**]).
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.1, HR 80, BP 104/56, RR 14-16, O2 99%RA.
Head CT showed no interval change in mid-line shift or size of SDH.
Neurosurgery recommended 6-pack of plt's, DDAVP, Vit K (10mg IV) and 2L NS.
At time of transfer, VS 97.8, HR 80, Bp 96/41, RR 22 O2 97% 3L NC, RA sat of 93-94%   Past Medical History: 1.
Seen by oncology for decreased counts on last admit and recommended to receive pulse steroids.

[**3-29**] CT Head: Evolution of acute-on-chronic right subdural hematoma with posterior layering of the acute component, now tracking along the tentorium.
[**3-28**] CT C-spine: 1.
Multilevel degenerative changes, predominantly at C5-6 and C6-7, unchanged in comparison to MRI [**2157-3-18**].
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg.
Vitamin K given for INR 1.3. ddavp given in ED given h/o aspirin use.
Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended transfusing plt's with goal of >80, received 1 6-pack in ED.
CT head and subsequent MRI/MRA were significant for stable SDH but chronic embolic events.
Neurology was consulted and an EEG showed spike and wave patterns consistent with pre-seizure activity.
