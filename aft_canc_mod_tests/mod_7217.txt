Pleural Biopsy #.
She was admitted to the ICU where she had a trach placed, a chest tube placed for a large Left pleural efusion and a pericardial window for malignant pericardial effusion with a pulsus paradoxus of 15 to 20 prior to pericardiocentesis and window.
On arrival to the floor, the patient had a pulsus of 10. .

[**2137-10-3**]: CT Chest - 1.
[**2137-10-1**]: CT Chest without contast: 1)  Multifocal areas of ground glass and consolidation in peripheral and peribronchial distribution.
Rapid progression and development of these findings favors an inflammatory or infectious etiology such as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, or fungal infection.
Compared with the report of the prior study of  [**2137-9-15**], the pericardial effusion has resolved.
[**2137-9-13**]: Chest CT: 1.
Discharge Labs: CBC: WBC-5.0 ; Hct-25.7 (before transfusion 1U PRBCs) ; PLT - 45 Chem: Na-140 ; K-3.7 ; Cl-104 ; HCO3-28 ; BUN-6 ; Cr-0.5 PT-20.8 ; INR-3.1 ; Fibrinogen-495  Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 60yo F with metastatic breast cancer who has received multiple chemotherapy regimens and radiation ([**8-22**]) for left brachial plexus tumor invasion with progression of disease.
Chest CT showed interval rapid accumulation of pericardial effusion over two weeks.
Pericardiocentesis was performed with drainage of 480cc turbid and bloody fluid, culture was negative and cytology revealed maligancy.
She underwent a left chest VATS, pleural biopsy, and pericardial window, and a pericardial drain was placed.
A recent CT performed on [**2137-10-9**] for a different indication (see below) revealed small pericardial effusion which was not seen on previous CT images.
The patient currently does not have a widened pulsus but has at baseline since her admission to the floor stable tachycardia (rate 100-115) and systolic blood pressures ranging from 90-115.
Patient has been working with PT and her exercise tolerance has been improving.
Patient's effusion will be followed with subsequent imaging and clinical exam by her oncologist on outpatient visits.
Additionally, as initial CT showed a large left pleural effusion, a chest tube was placed on [**2137-9-15**], which drained more than 1.4L of serosanguinous fluid.
Despite therapy, the patient's secretions continued and chest film demonstrated worsening opacities bilaterally without improving oxygen requirements.
The patient was diuresed with rapid improvement in her CXR and O2 sats.
However, on [**2137-9-30**] A CT chest was performed which demonstrated multifocal areas of ground glass and consolidation in peripheral and peribronchial distribution with differential as discussed by radiology as possible cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneuomonia, or fungal infection.
The chest CT was discussed with the pulmonary team whose impression was that it more likely represented a nosocomial pneumonia, although the exact etiology of this alveolar consolidating process is not currently clear.
A Lower extremity ultrasound was performed which demonstrated bilateral DVTs.
As the patient had known DVT as well as hypoxia that was not improving, the patient underwent a CT of the chest which demonstrated RLL pulmonary artery PE with extension into the subsegmental arteries as well as additional smaller subsegmental PEs on the right side.
The pulmonary team favored obtaining sputum cultures to see if a causative organsim could be identified before proceeding to Bronch.
Sputum cultures were performed and were found to be growing Acinetobaceter, multi-drug resistant, but sensitive to tobramycin and gentamycin.
However, the pulmonary team believed this was not the case and that this organism should be thought to be a cause of pulmonary infection given the CT findings and the fact that this is a virulent organism.
Repeat CT was suggested as well as starting cefepime 2gm q8hr with gentamycin 5mg/kg IV q24hr for a fever spike given the patient's known acinetobacter.
A repeat CT was performed which demonstrated resolution of previous ground glass opacities with development of a right hilar consolidation which was not thought to be infectious, but possibly representative of a drug effect vs. edema vs. bleed (per radiology report).
The patient had a pan-cytopenia secondary to myelosuppression requiring transfusion of 1U of PRBC for Hct of 23.5 with appropriate bump but did not require any platelet transfusions.
The patient was transfused one additional unit of PRBCs today on the day of discharge, for a Hct of 25.7.
She had C. Diff sent x 4, all of which were negative and the patient has remained afebrile with all stool cultures negative.
Nutrition: Patient had a video swallowing study and it was recommendedable that an appropriate diet would be ground solids and thin liquids originally after multiple procedures.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: .25 mg Injection Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed.
Pulmonary Embolism 8.
Patient is afebrile with persistent mild tachycardia 100-110, with stable blood pressure with systolics ranging from 90-110 without a widened pulsus.
Her oxygen saturation at rest off oxygen is 90%, with decrease to 88% while walking, but recovery to 90 to 92% with rest.
