He initially presented for evaluation of abd pain, nausea, 3-4 episodes of non-bloody, non-bilious emesis in the last day to day and a half, and subjective fevers at home.
In the ED, his initial vitals were remarkable for tachycardia to 130s, SBP 90s; he was afebrile.
Because he had reported subjective fever and was hypotensive, broad spectrum Abx (vanc and zosyn) were started and, because of his ascites and known pancreatic CA, CT torso was performed.
A CT torso showed that the patient had b/l PEs, and heparin gtt was started.
Strength 5/5 in upper and lower extremities.

Imaging: CXR ([**12-20**]):  1.
CT torso ([**12-20**]): 1.
Head CT ([**12-21**]): No intracranial hemorrhage or edema  Chest x-ray [**2140-12-29**]: Small left-sided pleural effusion with subsequent small left basal hypoventilation.
# Pancreatic cancer:  The patient completed a course of chemoradiation with 5-FU and EBRT on [**11-11**] which included 5 endoscopic US-guided intratumoral injections of TNFerade.
General surgery reviewed his CT scans with radiology and did not see any compelling signs of vascular invasion or varices that would explain his massive hematemesis, although CT has low sensitivity for this diagnosis.
# Bilateral PE: The patient was found on chest CT to have bilateral PE.
A wound consult was obtained and supportive care was given.
