Pathology: BMB [**6-28**]: DIAGNOSIS:      ATYPICAL LYMPHOID INFILTRATE CONSISTENT WITH LARGE CELL TRANSFORMATION OF CLL/SLL LEFT SHIFTED MYELOID PRECURSORS AND CIRCULATING BLASTS SEEN .
Close follow and clinical correlation along with a repeat biopsy/ aspirate study is recommended at an interval.
Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
They exhibit mild anisopoikilocytosis including burr cells, stomatocytes, red cell fragments - occasional tear drop cell.
The white blood cell count appears decreased.
Differential count shows 13% neutrophils, 5% bands, 11% monocytes, 65% lymphocytes, 1% eosinophils, 2% basophils, 3% large atypical lymphoid cells.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is suboptimal for evaluation due to absence of spicules; however, a 100 cell count was performed and reveals the following:  0% blasts, 0% promyelocytes, 4% myelocytes, 3% metamyelocytes, 7% neutrophils, 0% plasma cells, 66% lymphocytes, 5% erythroid, 15% large, atypical lymphoid cells.
Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate  for evaluation and consists of a 5 mm section of cortical and trabecular bone and periosteum.
CXR [**7-1**]: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
CT torso [**7-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
New areas of rarefaction and lucencies in T8, T9, and L5 vertebral bodies.
TTE [**7-4**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CXR [**7-5**]: IMPRESSION: No pneumonia.
Our heme-onc team performed a BM biopsy on [**7-2**], which showed atypical lymphoid infiltrate consistent with large cell transformation of CLL/SLL.
CXR negative, UA negative.
Blood cultures were sent, which returned no growth.
Urine cultures were sent, which showed no growth.
A legionella urine antigen was negative.
During the transfusion she began coughing, became hypertensive, developed fevers and her O2 sats dropped to 60% on RA.

You had a bone marrow biopsy that showed your CLL had changed to a high-grade lymphoma.
Your blood counts were low and you were given blood.
