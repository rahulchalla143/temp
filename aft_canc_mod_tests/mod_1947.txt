During that admission, she had an echo showing a pericardial effusion.

Conclusions: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2199-2-28**], the pericardial effusion is new.
Serial evaluation is suggested.
CTA Chest [**2199-5-8**]: 1.
Pericardial fluid cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CXR [**2199-5-15**]: Resolution of previously seen apical pneumothorax on the left.
She had a repeat echo, which showed a small pocket of apical fluid collection and resolution of the larger pericardial effusion.
GI Bleed: The patient was initially started on heparin drip due to concerns about the presence of PE; however, this medication was discontinued as her hematocrit decreased while on the drip.
She was transfused and her Hct remained stable following.
Given her hypercoagulability, she will likely need long-term AC, which may be re-initiated on an outpatient basis after the IVC filter has been removed.
She had had a nephrostomy tube placed in [**3-6**] obstruction of her R kidney and resultant ARF at that time.
On the weekend of [**4-4**], her urine output decreased and her nephrostomy output also decreased.
She was given large amounts of fluid as her CVPs were low (0-6), but her urine output failed to respond.
Her creatinine levels started to rise, and the etiology of her renal failure remained elusive.
However, her urine output remained low post-procedure.
Urine lytes were sent, with FeNa of 1.5% indicating intrinsic renal or post-renal disease.
Abdominal u/s showed resolution of prior R hydronephrosis, but was unable to visualize the renal arteries.
Renal artery u/s was done to evaluate for concerns of IVC obstruction of the renal arteries as an etiology of the ARF--pre-renal that eventually became ATN; however, this showed normal arterial and venous flow.
Urology was consulted and recommended a nuclear scan of the kidneys, which showed a possible L-sided obstruction.
After stent placement, her creat began to trend down and was 1.2 on the day of discharge.
The etiology was initially attributed to atelectasis/post-OP fever, but repeat CXR showed RLL haziness concerning for PNA (pt also had an elevated WBC).
Coagulopathy: INR increased to 3.6.
DIC panel was negative and liver function normal.
Also with possible contribution of ABX displacement of coumadin, although she is 7 days s/p stopping coumadin and INR is still rising, making this unlikely.
Vitamin K was held, given no evidence of bleeding; however, she receievd FFP prior to stent placement.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 27538**], who has followed pt in-house on prior admits, but who is NOT pt's primary oncologist (Dr.[**Location (un) 27539**]) discussed her poor prognosis with pt and family.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 27538**] recommended CT torso to restage pt; however, given her rising creat, this was postponed and may be done on an out-pt basis.
9) Dispo: Pt was discharged home with services once her creatinine was decreasing and she was afebrile and HD stable.
Please discuss obtaining a re-staging CT scan of the torso after your kidney function has improved .
Please discuss scheduling of brain MRI with gadolinium after your IVC filter is removed.
