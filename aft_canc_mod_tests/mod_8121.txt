Past Medical History: - Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma stage III: dx [**9-/2200**] - CAD - Mitral regurgitation: last echo [**2200-10-11**]: moderate/severe MVP - BPH - Strep Viridans bacteremia ([**9-/2200**] s/p 1 month course of ceftriaxone) - Extensive alcohol/tobacco use: no current use - Hx SIADH  PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Mr. [**Known lastname 112389**] initially presented to clinic on [**2200-9-10**], at which time he had five to seven months of pain in his throat and difficulty swallowing.
He had undergone a CT scan in [**Country 3396**] and was told that he had throat narrowing, which was causing him that difficulty.
According to his report, he had an endoscopy there, but no biopsy.
He underwent a CT neck on [**2200-9-10**], which showed some question of a mass-like lesion within the esophagus, but no neck abnormalities.
He underwent a CT torso on [**2200-9-11**], which showed proximal dilation of the esophagus with thickening of the esophagus distal to the level of the carina as well as some small pulmonary nodules.
He had a barium swallow on [**2200-9-12**], which showed a mid esophageal lesion concerning for esophageal carcinoma.
He went on to undergo an endoscopy on [**2200-9-16**].
Biopsy of the esophageal mass revealed an invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
He underwent a PET scan on [**2200-9-23**], which showed high-level FDG avidity at the site of the biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinoma as well as scattered subcentimeter mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes limited FDG avidity with an SUV mass of 3.7.

CT NECK AND CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**11-16**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Otherwise, CT appearance of the chest is little changed from [**2200-11-4**].
CXR [**11-25**]: FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
Very subtle basal parenchymal changes documented on the CT examination from [**2200-11-16**] and likely reflecting the sequela of chronic aspiration are not clearly seen on the chest x-ray.
CT CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS W/ CONTRAST: IMPRESSION:  1.
ECHO [**11-28**]: The left atrium is elongated.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-10-15**], no clear change.
If clinically indicated, a TEE is suggested to exclude endocardits and to better assess mitral/tricuspid anatomy and degrees of valve regurgitation.
[**2200-12-4**] Radiology FDG TUMOR IMAGING (PET) INTERPRETATION: Comparison is made to a prior PET-CT from [**2200-9-23**] and a CT of the torso from [**2200-11-26**].
It is unchanged in position since the most recent CT on [**2200-11-26**].
Just distal to the stent, there is mild esophageal fullness and FDG-avidity with an SUV max of 4.58.
A right hilar node measures 9 mm with an SUV max of 3.96 (image 65).
It previously measured 9 mm with an SUV max of 3.59.
A second right hilar node measures 5 mm with an SUV max of 3.65 (image 71).
A right paratracheal node measures 8 mm with an SUV max of 3.22 (image 60).
It previously measures 6 mm with an SUV max of 2.95.
A precarinal node measures 4 mm with an SUV max of 2.47 (image 64).
It previously measured 9 mm with an SUV max of 3.30.
Finally, a right hilar node measures 5 mm with an SUV max of 3.19 (image 69).
It previously measured 6 mm with an SUV max of 3.7.
Mild FDG-avidity in the right base with some ill-defined ground glass has an SUV max of 2.10 and is new from the prior exam.
A G-tube shows surrounding FDG-avidity, which is a normal finding.
Residual FDG-avidity around the esophageal stent may be due to residual disease, particularly the focus in the mid stent region with an SUV max of 6.87.
Alternatively, the FDG-activity could be related to inflammation around the stent.

Subsequent PET scan shows FDG avid area mid-stent as well as stable small FDG-avid mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.
Patient has history of multiple organisms found on blood culture during last admission, but none were isolated on current admission.
Recent echo showed possible tricuspid vegetation vs. leaflet thickening, but unable to have TEE due to esophageal mass.He was treated at various times during his long admission with vancomycin, meropenem, or zosyn.
# Tachycardia, possibly related to tumor burden: Sinus per EKG [**11-3**] and [**11-15**], however old EKG with SVT and lack of p waves suggesting possible re-entrant arrythmia.
