In the ED, vitals were T 101.6, HR 114, BP 117/75, RR 24, 96% on RA.
A CXR showed a retrocardiac opacity.
She could not recall what brought her to the hospital and was unclear about the reasons for her recent hospitalizations.
She had + blood cultures for pseudomonas from the OSH, but no sensitivities as of yet.

OSH Blood cxs: 4/4 bottles positive for Pseudomonas pan-resistant except to tobramycin  Repeat surveillance cultures: [**3-18**], [**3-22**], [**3-24**]: negative growth .
CT abdomen: 1. evaluation limited due to lack of IV contrast (IV infiltrated after 20cc, no access).
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted for sepsis, with initial presentation of fevers, leukocytosis and [**3-21**] blood cultures from OSH positive for Pseudomonas resistant to imipinem, quinolones and sensitive only to tobramycin.
After observation of continued hemodynamic stability, she was transferred to the floor, where surveillance cultures were negative X 3.
Culture of the tip was negative.
After determining culture sensitivities, tobramycin and cefepime were initiated.
Repeat surveillance cultures again remained negative.
Given the initial report of blood noted in ostomy, she was continued on IV PPI, but once her hematocrits were seen to be stable, she was switched to PO PPI.
Her coumadin, which was initially started several weeks prior to admission and then discontinued at time of GI bleed, was not restarted although she did have a CHADS score of 2 with her atrial fibrillation history, given that she was deemed too high risk for anticoagulation.
She will need troughs checked prior to each q48 dose with goal trough < 1.0.
You were admitted because you had positive blood cultures growing out a bacteria called Pseudomonas.
