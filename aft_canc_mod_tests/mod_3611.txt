As noted previously, the 3 mm nodule seen on CT is not evident on the radiographs.
Compared with the prior study of [**2168-2-12**], the findings are similar (the mobile echodensity is less well defined, but suggested on clip #[**Clip Number (Radiology) **]).
If clinically indicated, a TEE might be better able to define the aortic annular echodensity.
[**3-27**] Abd MRI 1.
[**4-2**] CXR 1.
LV systolic function appears depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-4-20**], left ventricular  function now appears similar in suboptimal views.
... CT Chest: IMPRESSION: 1.
Discharge labs   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54-year-old man w/ history of plasma cell leukemia/multiple myeloma who has hx of PE during treatment with Revlimid, s/p recent DPACE treatment here with febrile neutropenia.
Blood and urine cultures were taken in clinic.
CXR was done which was negative for an infiltrate.
On [**2-24**], Cefepime was switched to [**Last Name (un) **]/Vanco as his blood cultures grew out Coagulase negative staph and strep viridans.
Bm Bx done on [**3-9**] showed 50% plasma cells.
As well the right middle low mass that was thought to be a plasmacytoma showed increasing size on repeat CT.
Sputum cultures show aspergillus.
# Bacteremia: On cultures drawn on admission, he grew 2 bottles of coagulase negative staph and 1 bottle of strep viridans.
He was initially placed on Cefepime and Vancomycin, however after his cultures grew out he was changed to Meropenem and Vancomycin.
His fever curve trended back to normal.
Because of the culture positive for Strep viridans and question of possible endocarditis, an echocardiogram was done which showed a small fluttering echodensity on the aortic annulus which was stable from an echocardiogram three weeks earlier.
Multiple blood cultures were negative and cefepime and vancomycin were stopped after he was afebrile for 2 weeks.
Transfusion reaction: A blood transfusion was stopped on [**2-24**], as the patient was febrile during the transfusion.
An investigation was done and the conclusion was that the fever was likely due to the patient's bacteremia and was unrelated to the transfusion.
He was seen by dermatology who did a biopsy on [**2-24**].
# Renal insufficiency: The patient presented with creatinine of 1.6.
Per OMR, creatinine is often elevated with worsening of disease.
His creatinine continued to improve with hydration but again worsened when being diuresed for concern of volume overload.
Urine studies show likely secondary to myeloma.
# Transaminitis- patient has underlying fatty liver seen on RUQ US and MRI and then voriconazole was started which caused a rise in his LFTs.
