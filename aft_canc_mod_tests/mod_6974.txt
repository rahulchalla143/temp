Repeat chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax and clear lung fields except two perihilar masses.
Floor team noticed decreased breath sounds halfway up in the right lung field and a third of the way up in the left lung field with dullness to percussion with a respiratory rate at that time 25.
A chest CT was performed which revealed numerous metastatic processes within the lungs and mediastinum with some constriction of the right pulmonary artery.
The patient was seen once again by the Interventional Pulmonary team who checked a repeat chest x-ray which revealed rapid re-accumulation of effusion and at that time the recommendation was made to consider admission to Intensive Care Unit secondary to the patient's persistent tachypnea and relative hypoxia.

Ultrasound was performed by Interventional Pulmonary service to ascertain if he had re-accumulated any pleural effusion for further thoracentesis and it was found at that time that the patient's right diaphragm was greatly elevated which was the cause of his decreased breath sounds on the right.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and myself had a thorough discussion with the family, explained these findings and given the fact that the patient's pulmonary function was severely compromised due to metastatic process which could not be resolved it was thought that intubation and cardiac resuscitation would not be appropriate.
