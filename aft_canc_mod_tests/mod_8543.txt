In the ED, her vitals were: T - 101.1, HR - 96, BP - 97/44, RR - 14, O2 - 96% RA.
A CXR was unremarkable and a CT abdomen and pelvis showed persistent and worsened diverticulitis with no abscess or perforation.

Colonoscopy ([**2169-9-4**]): Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, descending colon and cecum Otherwise normal Colonoscopy to cecum .
Echocardiogram [**2172-9-22**]-Conclusions: The left atrium is elongated.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Pelvic ultrasound [**2172-9-30**]-IMPRESSION: 1.
#Anemia- Hematocrit dropped from 31.1 on admission to a nadir of 23.1 and was thought to be dilutional.
Hematocrit was 35.4 on the day of discharge.
Gynecology was consulted and a transvaginal ultrasound was obtained which revealed a fibroid uterus and a 5.7 mm endometrium  The bleeding was thought likely due to the subcutaneous heparin administered post-operatively for DVT prophylaxis.
An ultrasound was done that showed a fibroid in your uterus that is unchanged from before.
However, given that you do have mild thickening of your endometrium, you should have an endometrial biopsy to check for endometrial cancer.
You should follow-up with your primary care doctor regarding your [**Known lastname **] blood pressure.
