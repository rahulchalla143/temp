The patient was taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital Emergency Room where he was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage and an interparenchymal hemorrhage on CT scan without any midline shift and with normal ventricles.
At [**Hospital1 69**], a chest x-ray and pelvis CT scan were all normal.
Head CT scan showed multi-focal hemorrhage, both cortical and subarachnoid, nasal bone fracture as well as an air fluid level in the left maxillary sinus.
A repeat head CT scan the following day showed no change.
The EKG showed no changes at the time but CK were in the 300s with increased CK MB of 23 and troponin of 31.7, which subsequently increased to 47.3.
The patient was given aspirin, beta blocker, his Hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued and a repeat EKG showed biphasic T waves with no other significant changes.
An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 60% but the apex was not well visualized, which could be hypokinetic.
The echocardiogram was otherwise normal and the patient was transferred to the Medicine Service for management.
He had the biopsy due to a PSA of 5.2 in late [**Month (only) 404**] of this year; biopsy showed [**Doctor Last Name **] 8.
Negative bone scan, MRI or other metastatic work-up.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with a temperature of 98.6 F.; heart rate of 80; blood pressure of 112/60; respiratory rate was 14; 96% on room air.
CK MB 23, 26 and 19.
Troponin were 31.7 and 47.3.
He had a white count of 10.7, hematocrit of 39, platelets of 192, INR 1.1, normal PTT.
He had a creatinine of 1.0 and a phosphorus of 3.7, magnesium of 2.0.
The patient remained stable and a repeat head CT scan on [**10-20**] showed no change.
On [**10-20**], the patient received flexion and extension cervical x-rays which showed no cervical fracture.
The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization on [**2152-10-25**].
The cardiac catheterization showed mildly elevated left side filling pressures, infero-apical severe hypokinesis with no mitral regurgitation, left ventricular ejection fraction is about 50%.
Coronary angiography showed left dominant anatomy and a 99% mid-occlusion with extensive thrombus in the left anterior descending; otherwise normal.
The patient's labs remained stable and his hematocrit remained stable.
His CK continued to drift down to 58 on the day of discharge.
