He had a heart rate of ~38 (35-40 per report) and was asymptomatic.
In the ER his VS were T98.7F, BP 189/81mmHg, HR 40, RR 24, SpO2 97% RA.
His physical exam was normal; orthostasis, valsalva were not done.
He received aspirin 81 mg. Hct was at his baseline of 35, cardiac enzymes were CK: 103, MB: 7 and Trop-T: 0.27.
Prior to transfer to CCU: HR 34, BPM 190/80 mmHg, SpO2 99% RA, RR 18. .
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS - Temp 97.6F, BP 159/73mmHg, 42 HR, RR 13, O2-sat 98% RA GENERAL - well-appearing man in NAD, Oriented x3, comfortable, Mood, affect appropriate.
HEENT - NC/AT, PERRLA, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear, Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
LYMPH - no cervical, axillary, or inguinal LAD NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**5-16**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout, DTRs 2+ and symmetric, cerebellar exam intact, gait not assessed PULSES:  Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ (DP and PT not assessed due to wrapping, will do in am before procedure)  Pertinent Results: Admission Labs ([**2169-8-9**]): WBC-7.1 HGB-11.3* HCT-35.6* PLT-207 GLUCOSE-88 UREA N-24* CREAT-4.3* SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-3.9 CHLORIDE-98 TOTAL CO2-28 ANION GAP-18 CALCIUM-8.9 PHOSPHATE-3.2 MAGNESIUM-1.7 CK-MB-7, cTropnT-0.27*, CK(CPK)-103 PT-13.2 PTT-39.1* INR(PT)-1.1  CXR ([**2169-8-11**]): Compared with [**2169-8-10**], a single lead right-sided pacemaker is in place, with lead tip over right ventricle.
ECG ([**2169-8-9**]): Sinus rhythm with 2nd degree AV block with 2:1 conduction and occasional ectopic beats.
His heart rates were in the 30's-40's at this time.
His pacemaker was in the correct place via follow-up CXR and an interrogation the morning after the procedure showed a normally functioning pacemaker.
His BP was highest post-dialysis, as he does not take his medications the morning before dialysis.
His BP stabilized by the time of discharge on these medications, although he would likely benefit from outpatient BP monitoring.
# CAD -  Patient with history of coronary artery disease (last cath [**2155**] showed 50% lesion of ramus intermedius)who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia.
It was felt that his bradycardia was unlikely to be related to current ischemia, and patient's ECG was not suggestive of ischemia or infarct.
# Pump - Last echo in [**3-20**] showed mildly depressed systolic function, with LVEF = 55% and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
It was felt that his pump would benefit most from optimal blood pressure control.
# Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD - patient dialyzed MWF while in house, and has follow-up with dialysis clinic.
His electrolytes were monitored and repleted, and calcium acetate and nephrocaps were continued.
He missed an appointment for arterial studies (noninvasive) which he was an inpatient, and it was attempted to get these studies as an inpatient but they were not completed before discharge.
The studies were ordered again as an outpatient.
