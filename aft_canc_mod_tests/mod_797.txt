His INR was 3.1 and was given vitamin K and 2U FFP.
Cards consult was called and bedside echo did not show new WMA and no pericardial effusion.

S/P HEART CATH, HYPOTENSIVE, HEMATOMA ON CT  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 67 year old man w/R fem hematoma ?active bleed; s/p R groin entry for cardiac cath 2 wks ago; now hypotensive REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: duplex ultrasound of R fem art RIGHT FEMORAL VASCULAR ULTRASOUND  INDICATION: 67-year-old with right groin hematoma, question active extravasation, rule out pseudoaneurysm.
COMPARISON: CT and ultrasound performed earlier today.

BP 70s.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of abdomen and pelvis were obtained without administration of oral or intravenous contrast.
Eventration of the left hemidiaphragm is noted.
Non-contrast evaluation of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, right adrenal gland, pancreas is unremarkable.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is extensive diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
COMPARISON: Groin ultrasound, [**2120-3-13**].
Color Doppler and pulse wave Doppler images of the common femoral artery and vein in the right groin demonstrate appropriate flow in those vessels.
A benign-appearing lymph node is also identified in the right groin, which measures 1.8 x 0.7 x 1.2 cm.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
On the previous tracing of [**2110-6-16**] inferior myocardial infarction was noted.
TRACING #1    Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 86 [**Telephone/Fax (3) 17442**]/[**Medical Record Number 17443**] -141    Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old male with CAD s/p CABG and recent stent to SVG-PDA 10 days ago admitted from PCP's office with right leg pain and hypotension.
The source of his hypotension was a right femoral hematoma, as he just had a cardiac catheterization done the week before, and radiographic imaging revealed a right femoral hematoma without fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
The patient presented with a supratherapeutic INR of 3.5.
He initially presented with SBP in 80's, improved overnight to 100/60 after aggressive resuscitation with IVF and packed red blood cells.
His levophed was weaned off by HD#2, and his blood pressure remained stable throughout his hospital course.
The patient's blood pressure was WNl at discharge.
The patient had a recent cardiac catheterization in which his right femoral artery was accessed.
His INR at this time was 3.8, as he was discharged on lovenox and coumadin for his atrial fibrillation.
His hematocrit at presentaiton was 26.7.
Right groin ultrasound showed a hematoma without fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
CT abdomen/pelvis ruled showed a large intramuscular hematoma without retroperitoneal bleeding.
His INR eventually decreased to 1.7, and his hematocrit increased to 30.0, where it remained stable for the remainder of his hospitalization.
A repeat right groin ultrasound on [**3-15**] showed the hematoma was stable and not enlarging.
The pain began before he underwent cardiac catheterization during his previous hospitalization.
He had an initialincrease in CKs which were thought secondary to demand ischemia, they were followed and were trending down by HD #2.
He was started on metoprolol once his hematocrit stabilized, and there was no evidence of active bleeding.
His lisinopril was restarted once his blood pressure was stable.
# Pump: Bedside echo done in ED shows EF 45 with HK of the inferorior inferior, inferolateral and apical walls consistent with mutlivessel coronary disease, not significantly changed from [**2117**].
He presented with a supratherapeutic INR to 3.5, and his coumadin was held.
Creatinine on admission was 1.9, and decreased to 1.1 after fluid resuscitation.
His creatinine remained stable once he was fluid resuscitated, indicating that his acute renal failure was prerenal.
#Positive Blood Culture: Cultured from Right IJ, coag negative staph aureus.
Subsequent cultures have been negative.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right groin intramuscular hematoma within adductor compartment Coronary Disease Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure Myelodysplastic Syndrome Atrial Fibrillation Osteoarthritis   Discharge Condition: Good, tolerating PO.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure, and found to have a right groin hematoma.
You were administered IV fluids, along with blood transfusions.
Bleeding from your hematoma stopped, and your blood pressure and hematocrit normalized.
