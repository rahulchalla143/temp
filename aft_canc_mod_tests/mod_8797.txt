She was found to have pulmonary nodules on chest x-ray suspicious for lung metastases, guaiac positive stools, anemia, increased LFTs and also a bone scan positive for metastatic disease.
She was scheduled for a barium swallow on [**4-7**] and it is unclear whether this was done or not.
She had no other associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, chest pain, lightheadedness, melena, bright red blood per rectum or abdominal pain.
An intravenous pyelogram was done with tomography with finding of widened bladder neck, otherwise, normal.
The patient was sent from the Emergency Room where her vital signs were stable to the Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Suite where it was revealed an abnormal mucosa in the esophagus from 30 cm to 22 cm distally with adherent clot and moderate oozing.
Colonoscopy was not performed at that time secondary to active bleeding and she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for one night for observation.
Weight loss, dysphagia, anorexia, pulmonary nodules on chest x-ray guaiac positive stools, metastatic bone lesion on bone scan, increased LFTs, 3.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: Temperature 99.1.
Pulse 96.
Blood pressure 113/54.
Respiratory rate 14-18.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Anicteric sclerae, dry mucous membranes.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 12.5, hematocrit 26.8, platelets 361,000.
Neutrophils 87%, lymphocytes 8%, monocytes 5%, INR 1.1, PT 12.7, PTT 24.9.
Sodium 138, potassium 3.3, chloride 99, bicarbonate 26, BUN 23, creatinine .8, glucose 120.
WORK-UP PRIOR TO ADMISSION ON [**3-23**]:  Sedimentation rate 68, ALT 33, AST 71, alkaline phosphatase 296, T bilirubin .8, GGT 81, albumin 3.8, total protein 6.9, globulin 3.1, calcium 9.9, TSH 2.6, iron 3, total cholesterol 218, TIBC 280, B12 984, folate greater than 20, ferritin 245, TRF 215, HDL 65, cholesterol to HDL ratio 3.4, SPEP abnormal band in gamma region 2% of total protein, IgG 698, IgA 318, IGM 214, IFE monoclonal IgM cap was seen.
24 hour urine:  PH 5, protein 15, volume 380 cc, UPEP no Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] proteins, only albumin.
Urine culture on [**3-23**] negative.
CT of the head without contrast [**2196-6-26**]:  Moderate atrophy without significant abnormalities.
Mammogram [**2196-12-27**]: No evidence of malignancy.
Chest PA and lateral [**2197-2-24**]: Extensive pulmonary and right hilar metastases.
Left hip x-ray [**2197-3-28**]:  Normal pelvis and left hip.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy [**2197-4-10**]:  Normal stomach, normal duodenum, esophagus with abnormal mucosa with bleeding in esophagus from 30 cm where the TE junction is seen to 22 cm proximally, adherent clot, active bleeding and friability.
Biopsy performed at lower [**12-29**] of esophagus and middle [**12-29**] of esophagus.
She remained hemodynamically stable and hematocrit also bumped up appropriately to above 30 with the transfusions and remained stable throughout her hospital stay.
INR 1.5, PT 14.6, PTT 25.7.
She was started on Vitamin K subcutaneous injections times three days and her coagulation laboratories normalized by the time of discharge.
However, a CT scan was done of her torso showing mediastinal lymphadenopathy, right hilar adenopathy, dilation of esophagus with air fluid level in the distal esophagus and distal esophageal wall markedly thickened beyond TE junction suspicious for malignancy.
Given this, result of her CT scan, as well as what was done prior with definite metastatic disease, the patient's husband was seen by the Home Hospice Service and choose this as the next route management.
Other medications the same except for her Aricept, which was discontinued.
