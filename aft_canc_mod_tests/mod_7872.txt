Clinical correlation with symptoms is recommended, and if necessary, repeat supine and upright abdominal radiographs  [**10-7**] RUQ U/S: RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: There is diffuse distention of the gallbladder with 11 mm of wall thickening.
These findings were relayed to the Emergency Department dashboard at the immediate conclusion of the examination as well as discussed in person with the surgical team caring for the patient.
[**10-7**] CT ABD/PELVIS CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL, WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear.
The abdominal loops of large and small bowel are normal in caliber and contour.
CT PELVIS WITH ORAL, WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Oral contrast does not extend into the pelvis.
[**10-7**] CXR: PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Comparison is made to the prior chest radiograph dated [**2153-5-25**].
In the ED, the patient was hypotensive with a SBP in the 90's.
RUQ u/s was consistent with acute cholecystitis and a possible mass within the gallbladder.
Due to the patient's MPD and chronic dose of steriods and immune suppression, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] was consulted on HD2.
The patient was brought to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy with open cholecystectomy and intraoperative cholangiogram.
The patient's blood culture was positive for gram neg.
Steroids were tapered to PO prednisone 10 mg [**Hospital1 **], Cellcept was restarted, and hydroxyurea was to be used if platelets increased greater than 500,000.
The patient complained of difficulty breathing on POD2 and CXR revealed small infiltrate/atelectasis of the left lung base.
Blood cultures came back postive for E. Coli and bile culture was positive for enterococcus.
