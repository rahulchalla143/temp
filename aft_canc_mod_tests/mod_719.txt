Admission Date:  [**2169-2-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2169-3-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2094-4-2**]       Sex:  M  Service:  SICU  ID:  A 74 year old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the lungs with obstruction and transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for evaluation for a palliative stent, after persistent respiratory failure at an outside hospital with failure to wean.
Workup at the outside hospital included a spiral computerized tomographic angiography which was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed bilateral mid bronchus mass that was narrowing the airways.
An echocardiogram at the outside hospital showed an ejection fraction of 65%, biatrial enlargement, 2+ mitral regurgitation, and a small effusion.
He was transferred here for evaluation of placement of a stent palliatively.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed temperature 98.0, blood pressure 117/32, respiratory rate 23, pulse of 123, pulse oximetry 94% on EC ventilation 400 cc by 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure 5, 50% oxygen.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Extraocular movements intact.
Extremities:  Right PICC line, dorsalis pedis 2+ bilaterally equal, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 13.4, hematocrit 37.7, platelets 408, PT 13, INR 1.1, sodium 148, potassium 3.9, chloride 107, bicarbonate 32, BUN 51, creatinine 0.9. glucose 108, calcium 8.8, phosphorus 4.1, magnesium 2.
Arterial blood gases was 7.46 pH, pCO2 46, and pO2 was 97 on AC 400 by 14 by 5 by 50%.
Respiratory failure - We thought that the most likely cause of the respiratory failure was mucous plugging plus airway compression.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] did an initial bronchoscopy the day after admission which showed extrinsic compression of the left main stem bronchus.
He was started on a sepsis protocol with an initial lactate of 4.9, white count increased from 13.4 to 16.5 and the patient was in atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter.
Gram stain and sputum culture were sent off and came back positive for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Electrophysiology Service was asked to see him and they recommended adding a beta blocker and checking an echocardiogram and discontinuing the Digoxin.
Echocardiogram was done on [**2-23**], which showed an left ventricular ejection fraction of 70 to 80%, 1+ mitral regurgitation and 1+ aortic regurgitation and a small pericardial effusion.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was kept on tube feeds, Respalor.
Renal - Creatinine was initially up to 1.4 from baseline of .9, likely due to sepsis.
The patient was given fluids and the creatinine improved to .8.
Tubes, lines and drains - Right PICC was placed on [**2-10**].
Renal cell carcinoma, metastatic to lungs with extrinsic airway compression.
Lorazepam 1 to 4 mg intravenously q.
