Rash was also noted across face, chest, arms - non pruritic, non painful thought to be secondary to drug rash vs. reaction to blood transfusion.
Pt's blood pressure stabilized with fluid resuscitation and fever defervesced with Abx and Tylenol/Ibuprofen.
CXR revealed congestion and pt obtained diuresis with relief of [**Month/Year (2) **], thought to be due to flash pulmonary edema secondary to chemo induced cardiomyopathy.
Repeat CD4 count was 184 (previously 800), viral load >10,000.
All cultures still negative but patient became febrile to 102.
MRI of the neck did not show persistence/recurrence of abscess or osteomyelitis.
HBV, HCV sent due to rising LFTs all negative.
C. Diff, galactomannin and strongyloides sent and were negative due to persistent diarrhea.
CT torso of the abdomen was performed as a last effort to identify a source, which was unrevealing.
Wound cultures taken from the site of line removal grew resistant coagulase positive staph aureus for which he was empirically covered by Vancomycin.
CXR on presentation to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] demonstrated b/l pulm congestion vs. pneumonia.
EF on [**5-16**] = 55%, repeat EF on ECHO ([**6-27**]) = 40-45% therefore decreased likelihood cardiogenic pulm congestion, although still possibility of chemo-induced cardiac dysfunction given the newer lower EF, but could be pulm congestion [**1-19**] early sepsis w/ leaky capillaries or PCP.
Therefore, ECHO was obtained [**6-27**] and r/o for structural heart abnormality as cause of tachycardia - therefore was just monitored during ICU stay.
Appears to be drug rash in nature - [**1-19**] Cefepime vs. Levofloxacin vs. related to blood transfusion (pt transfused while febrile) vs. enteroviral infection.
Other stool studies [**6-24**] and [**6-25**] neg.
Pt with improved (decreased) stool output [**6-28**] and [**6-29**].
Viral stool cxs positive for adenovirus.
LDH= 194 ([**6-23**])-> 811([**6-28**]) as indication of tumor burden vs. related to transfusion of pRBC vs. ?PCP.
Hct monitored and remained stable.
HIV: Last CD4=800, viral load > 100,000 in past couple months.
