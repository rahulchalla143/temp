The patient was found hypothermic with a body core temperature of 86 degrees Fahrenheit and hypoglycemic with a fingerstick blood glucose brought to [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital where she was found to have a blood alcohol level of 320 with a persistent temperature in the mid 80s degrees Fahrenheit.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further management.
The patient was initially seen by the Trauma Surgery team, and a subsequent pelvic x-ray was obtained without evidence of pelvic fracture.
Initial blood work on admission was notable for a white blood cell count of 161,000 (with 90% lymphocytes on white blood cell different).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination on admission revealed vital signs (in the Intensive Care Unit) with a temperature of 98.6 (previously 86 degrees Fahrenheit in the field), blood pressure was 112/46, heart rate was 108, respiratory rate was 16, oxygen saturation was 94% on a 50% nonrebreather.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic with multiple contusions on the face.
Neck examination revealed supple with the absence of jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
Pulmonary examination revealed lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly with no wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.
Abdominal examination revealed normal active bowel sounds, soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were 1 to 2+ bilaterally.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient was noted to be somnolent but arousable with physical stimuli and oriented to name only; no gross motor or sensory deficits were noted on examination.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on admission revealed complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 160,000, hematocrit was 41.2, with a mean cell volume of 108, and platelets were 108.
White blood cell differential revealed 8% neutrophils, 0% bands, 90% lymphocytes, 1% monocytes.
Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 147, potassium was 3.1, chloride was 114, bicarbonate was 18, blood urea nitrogen was 16, creatinine was 0.5, and blood glucose was 16, with an anion gap of 15.
PT was 14.9, with an INR of 1.5, PTT was 28.3.
Liver function tests revealed AST was 39, ALT was 13, total bilirubin was 0.5, and LDH was 236.
Calcium was 6.9, phosphate was 2.7, magnesium was 1.3.
Fibrinogen was 258.
Initial cardiac enzymes revealed creatine kinase was 162, CK/MB was 6, and troponin was less than 0.3.
A chest x-ray on admission was notable for borderline congestive heart failure with no pulmonary infiltrates.
Electrocardiogram on admission revealed a normal sinus rhythm with no ST-T wave changes.
An arterial line and central venous access (left subclavian) were placed for close monitoring and rapid treatment.
HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY SYSTEM:  The initial laboratory work on admission was notable for a profound monoclonal lymphocytosis with a white blood cell count of 160,000 and 90% monoclonal lymphocytes.
The Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic was consulted and suggested chronic lymphocytic leukemia as the most probable diagnosis based on smudge cells found on peripheral blood smear, the absence of bands on white blood cell differential, and the absence of obvious lymphadenopathy.
However, Hematology/Oncology could not rule out other etiologies; and blood work was sent for cytology and cytogenetic studies.
Staging abdominal, pelvic, and thoracic CAT scans were remarkable only for small mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy without evidence of organomegaly (including liver and spleen).
On the day of discharge, both cytology and cytogenetic laboratory studies were pending.
The patient was noted to have a macrocytic anemia during the hospitalization with an initial hematocrit of 41, with a mean cell volume of 108; which, following intravenous fluid repletion, subsequently decreased to a hematocrit ranging from 29 to 31.
A subsequent vitamin B12 level (300) and folate level (6.1) were within normal limits; making nutritional causes a less likely factor.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable within the range of 29 to 31 throughout the remainder of the hospitalization, and did not require transfusion support.
While on heparin, the patient's PTT was noted to be supratherapeutic, and the patient's INR increased from 1.5 to 2.8.
Liver function tests were also pending to evaluate to synthetic function.
All blood cultures to date were without growth.
The thyroid studies were still pending at the time of this dictation with evidence of a normal hemoglobin A1c of 4.9.
A head CAT scan on admission was without evidence of acute bleed and/or mass.
There was no evidence of withdrawal with persistent CIWA scores of 0 to 2 throughout the 5-day hospitalization.
RENAL SYSTEM:  The patient presented with an anion gap, lactic acidosis, with an initial arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.17, bicarbonate of 18, a PCO2 of 39, and a PO2 of 147 on 2 liters nasal cannula, with a lactate of 5.5.
The patient's renal function remained stable with a creatinine ranging from 0.5 to 0.9.
