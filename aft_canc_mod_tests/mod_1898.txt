HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 45-year-old G2, P2 was admitted with recurrent vaginal cancer on [**2107-2-28**] for preoperative work up.
The patient was then seen by her gynecologist in [**7-/2106**] and her exam was significant for a large ulcerated vaginal lesion (7 x 4 cm) hovering the upper [**2-5**] of her vagina on the anterior surface.
A biopsy was performed at that time which revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
The patient underwent a CT scan in [**Month (only) 205**] which illustrated left sided hydronephrosis with obstruction at the ureteropelvic junction, cyst in the right inferior pole of the kidney, presence of an IUD, no evidence of bladder invasion.
The patient was then taken to the Operating Room in late [**Month (only) 205**] where she underwent an exam under anesthesia and a diagnostic cystoscopy.
The cystoscopy confirmed that there was no evidence of tumor invasion.
On [**2106-11-15**], the patient underwent a vaginal biopsy which showed no evidence of recurrent.
On [**2106-12-6**], the patient had a follow up CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis which was stable.
The patient's exam at that time revealed a firmness of anterior surface of the vagina.
A vaginal biopsy was performed and revealed recurrent or persistence of the invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
On [**2106-2-3**], the patient underwent an MRI of the pelvis which confirmed the findings of prior CT scans and did not show evidence of further disease.
The patient was admitted on [**2107-2-28**] for preoperative work up.
That day, she underwent a CT urogram which showed left hydronephrosis and no contrast spilling into the left ureter, persistence of the right renal cyst, small adrenal mass.
The patient's last PAP smear was in [**7-/2106**] at the time of her initial presentation which revealed squamous cell carcinoma.
Her prior PAP was three years ago which was normal.
The final pathology revealed moderate to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma involving the upper vagina extending into the cervix and invading the muscularis of the bladder.
PAIN:  The patient was initially on a morphine PCA which was changed to a Dilaudid PCA on postoperative day #4 for better pain control.
The Toradol was stopped for a period every two days and the creatinine remained stable throughout the hospitalization.
The patient's fluid status was monitored closely with the CVPs during the SICU admission.
The patient received 2 units of blood at the time of the surgery and one further unit of blood on postoperative day #2 when her hematocrit was 27.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient had a poor appetite through the majority of the hospitalization.
During the hospitalization, the patient's magnesium and phosphate were replaced on a daily basis, first through intravenous and then included in the TPN.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Beginning on postoperative day #10, the patient's white count was elevated to 11.2.
The differential showed 3% bands.
The patient had blood cultures drawn, a urine culture sent from the bilateral stents and the Foley catheter.
The patient also had a chest x-ray which was negative.
These antibiotics were discontinued on postoperative day #14, as the patient had no temperature spikes and all cultures were negative.
The tip of the central line was sent to microbiology and showed coagulation negative Staphylococcus which was thought to be a contaminant.
The patient's Dilantin levels were subtherapeutic.
