Given these findings, she was taken to the OR for exploration on [**2106-1-23**].
She was urgently taken to the CT scanner, with witnessed seizure activity within the scanner.
CT and MRI/MRA scan findings found no acute intracranial process, with no evidence of acute infarct or hemorrhage, a known, stable left parietal cavernoma.
While on the floor, she was monitored on telemetry and was found to be moderately bradycardic to the 40s, but asymptomatic and normotensive.
GI: Patient was kept NPO until gas and stool were expelled from her ostomy (POD#6).
She was stable from this standpoint, and her creatinine remained within normal limits.
She was bridged from heparin drip to lovenox/coumadin with an INR of 1.5 upon discharge with a goal INR of [**2-12**].
You have tolerated a regular diet while on oral pain medications, and your heart rate is controlled with oral diltiazem and metoprolol.
This was confirmed with both CT and MRI/MRA scans and was likely due to not receiving your carbamazepime (anti-epileptic) medication for several days.
