This was associated with upper quadrant abdominal cramps, which have since resolved.
A CT abdomen with contrast showed no obstruction or small bowel problem (though it did show a possible sacral mass).

Labs were remarkable for K 6.1 BUN/Cr.
FeNa was 0.3%, Renal u/s showed no hydronephrosis or stones, CT abdomen showed dialated loops of fluid filled bowel unchanged from [**2143-11-29**], consistent with mild chronic obstruction.

IMAGING: CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast ([**2143-12-9**])- 1.
CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast ([**2143-12-15**])- Multiple loops of fluid-filled dilated small bowel, slighty progressed since the [**2143-12-9**] examination, tapering somewhat near an area of surgical scar/remnant tissue at the rectal bed, concerning for partial small bowel obstruction secondary to presacral soft tissue to which the bowel appears adherent.
Renal ultrasound ([**2143-12-15**])- Normal ultrasound examination of the kidneys.

Initial blood pressure was 60s/40s with HR low 90s.
Her lisinopril was held and was not restarted prior to discharge.
Based on her blood pressures and renal function at follow up, her Lisinopril could be restarted at PCP follow up visit.
Stool culture was negative for salmonella, shigella, e.coli, vibrio, yersinia.
Stool guaiac was positive x 2.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
Gastroenterology was consulted and did an upper endoscopy which was notable for friable mucosa throughout the stomach and duodenum consistent with gastritis and duodenitis, in addition to two polyps which were biopsied.
GI suggested outpatient capsule study for visualization of the small bowel for potential source of bleeding.
Patient's hematocrit remained stable for 48 hours and she was discharged on [**Hospital1 **] PPI with close PCP and GI [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] scheduled.
Creatinine also improved with fluid resuscitation, returning from peak of 5.9 to baseline of 1.1 and remaining stable thereafter.
EKG showed no pr shortening or significant tenting of the t waves; no qrs widening.

Gastroenteritis 4.
Because of the large volume loss, your blood pressure was very low, and you were briefly in the ICU for medications and fluids to help bring your blood pressure up.
The gastroenterologists did an exam of your esophagus and stomach and found irritation of the lining in your stomach.
You should discuss the benefit of a capsule study during your follow-up appointment.
Also, you have a blood test pending to look for an infection in your stomach that could be causing the irritation and bleeding called H.pylori, you should discuss this result with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at your follow up appointment.
A CT scan of your abdomen noted a new mass in your abdomen, which is likely related to past radiation.
Please have this examination performed prior to your follow-up with your surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
