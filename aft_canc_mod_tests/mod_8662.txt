Gram stain did not reveal any organisms.
Lyme serology was negative for lyme antibody.
Tissue cultures and swab cultures did not reveal organisms on gram stain and showed no anaerobic growth to date as well as no fungal or acid fast bacilli.
Blood cultures have not grown anything to date.
Extensive discussion was given regarding repeat thoracentesis prior to discharge, but patient had good range of motion at the joint and felt pain had improved since admission, and it was uncelar what diagnostic benefit would be gained from a second thoracentesis.
- Patient will follow-up with PCP and Orthopaedics, Vancomycin levels to be monitored at HD.
Further, the decrease in platelets was felt not to be typical of HIT or reactivation of HIT in previously exposed patient.
DIC work-up also non-revealing.
Plan on discharge is as follows: - Please check platelet count twice weekly at hemodialysis - If platelets drop below 30K patient should be referred to hospital for evaluation.
She did complain of throat discomfort, which was felt to be related to her recent intubation.
