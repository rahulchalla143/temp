He was empirically started on levofloxacin after a CXR showed concern for PNA.
In [**Location (un) 620**], intial vital signs were 98.7 92 18 80/53 91% which decreased to 88% on RA, ultimately placed on a non-rebreather with improvement of his oxygenation.
His Hct was 39.9.
In ED VS were 98.6 97/64 90 24 99% on Non-rebreather which was ultimately weaned down to 3 liters.
Hct was 31.5.
non-con Ct showed Extensive consolidation involving the left upper lobe.

These findings have progressively worsened since the earlier chest radiograph of [**2147-8-16**] and are highly concerning for pneumonia.
Suboptimal study for assessing for pneumothorax as the lung apices are excluded from the field of view.
# Hemoptysis: His hematocrit at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], where he initially presented, was 39.9 with a blood pressure of 80/53.
He underwent rigid bronchoscopy, biopsy performed and could not stop the bleeding.
A repeat flex bronch was performed bedside the following morning and no signs of active bleeding were present.
He also required supplemental oxygen with a shovel mask initially, which was weaned down to 5 liters NC prior to transfer to the floor.
(As a note, pulmonary embolism was considered as an etiology for his hemoptysis and hypoxia - during this admission, lower extremity dopplers were done which were negative for DVT.
He will need repeat CT imaging to assess for underlying cause for the bleeding.
EKG not c/w ischemia.
His blood pressures were well-controlled off of medications.

Home oxygen 2L oxygen titrate to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 90%.
Hemoptysis 2.
You had a CT scan of the lungs that showed you might have a pneumonia.
