CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST ON [**2134-1-11**] IMPRESSION: Interval enlargement of lytic osseous metastases, specifically within the T6 and T11 vertebral bodies.
EEG ON [**2134-1-12**]: IMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal routine EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to mild right hemisphere slowing most notably in the central regions and particularly during drowsiness.
There is a new punctate focus of enhancement in the left frontal lobe adjacent to the genu of the corpus collosum seen only on the MPRAGE images ( series 1101 image 39; series 1100 image 54).
Minimal interval increase in size and surrounding vasogenic edema involving the right frontal lobe enhancing lesion when compared with the previous examination of [**2133-12-9**].
Please have the patient return for sagittal STIR/T2, and precontrast imaging for further evaluation.
CT showed increased vasogenic edema and mass effect when compared to the most recent [**Year (4 digits) 4338**] which could mean recurrence of mass vs. necrosis of the tumor.
