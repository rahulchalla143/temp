A V/Q scan to rule out pulmonary embolism was done as a workup for atrial fibrillation, and revealed marked decreased ventilation of the left lung.
A follow-up CT of the main stem bronchus with extensive mediastinal extension was discovered.
A bronchoscopy at [**Hospital1 1562**] on [**12-13**] revealed a soft tissue endobronchial lesion causing greater than 90% occlusion of the left main stem bronchus as well as extrinsic compression of the carina and extension to the right main stem bronchus.
An initial biopsy revealed results consistent with non-small cell lung cancer.
Oxygen saturations are 92 to 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
History of positive PPD, negative acid fast bacilli on bronchoscopy 4.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 97.6, heart rate 100, blood pressure 149/70, respirations 22, oxygen saturation 94% on 10 liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact, mucous membranes moist, oropharynx clear.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count 25.8, hematocrit 35.6, platelets 404.
INR 1.2.
Sodium 134, potassium 3.8, chloride 97, bicarbonate 24, BUN 13, creatinine 0.7, glucose 127.
Magnesium 1.9.
A CT of the chest done prior to this procedure had confirmed the left main stem occlusion extending into the right upper lobe bronchus, and additionally showed a small left pleural effusion, extensive right ground-glass opacities, septal thickening consistent with lymphangitic spread.
At baseline, she required 5 to 6 liters nasal cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation of 89 to 90%.
She received periodic Atrovent and albuterol nebulizer treatments, which increased her oxygen saturation when she would desaturate to the mid-80s.
It was felt that mucous plugging was partially responsible for this, as her oxygen saturations would improve after she coughed up mucous.
She had two follow-up chest x-rays which were consistent with the prior findings and revealed no interval development of heart failure or pneumonia.
On the evening of transfer to the floor, which was [**2138-12-17**], the patient returned to atrial fibrillation/flutter with a ventricular rate of 100 to 140 beats per minute.
Her rate was brought down with both oral and intravenous metoprolol.
The patient was initially in sinus rhythm following the procedure, but had two instances where she returned to what was felt to be a left atrial flutter rhythm with ventricular rates between 80 and 100.
Oncology:  The patient had been seen by a medical oncologist and a radiation oncologist at [**Hospital1 1562**] prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 69**].
The pathology from her bronchoscopy returned consistent with poorly-differentiated large-cell carcinoma.
The culture from her bronchial washings grew sparse oropharyngeal flora.
On discharge, her white blood count was down-trending from 19.0 on the 21st to 17.3 on the 22nd, to 15.4 on the 23rd.
Liver function tests drawn the day prior to discharge are pending at the time of this dictation.
A TSH drawn this admission was normal.
ADDENDUM Patient was set to leave for [**Hospital 1562**] hospital, howver it was noted on day of discharge she was noted to be veyr short of breath and CXR revealed lobasr collapse c/w stent obstruction.
