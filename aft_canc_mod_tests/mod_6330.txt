The patient initially presented to [**Hospital 7912**] on [**2112-11-5**] following an evaluation by ENT for sinus congestion.
Her daughter referred her to her own ENT who ordered a CT chest to evaluate for SVC syndrome.
The CT showed RUL and RML collapse due to a central obstructing lesion as well as bulky lymphadenopathy.
On admission she had a thoracentesis which did not show evidence of malignancy.
On [**2112-11-8**], thoracic surgery performed a rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy which showed non-small cell lung cancer.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
NEURO:  Unable to assess given sedation PSYCH: Listens and responds to questions appropriately, pleasant   Pertinent Results: From [**Hospital6 33**] CT Chest [**2112-11-2**]:  RUL and RML collapse, central obstructing mass, large right pleural effusion, bulky right paratracheal, subcarinal, precarinal and lateral vascular adenopathy.
MRI head [**2112-11-6**]:  Nonspecific small foci of increased T2 and Flair signal in the subcortical white matter likely represent small vessel ischemic change.
CT Abd/pelvis [**2112-11-6**]:  Large right pleural effusion, compressive atelecatsis, no liver lesions, no abdominal mass or adenopathy, 3mm right renal calculus, edema in the subcutaneous fat of the anterior chest wall as well as the right and left breast.
She had an initial bronchoscopy the day after admission which showed a large tumor burden obstructing the airways.
She then had a tracheostomy/PEG placed on [**11-21**] as well as a thoracentesis of 1.2 L of pleural fluid.
The fluid was negative for malignant cells.
Repeat CXR showed slow reaccumulation of pleural effusion, but her respiratory function remained stable with attempts to diurese her further.
Her settings were Volume Control TV 450, RR 16, PEEP 5, Fi02 50%.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer:  This was a new diagnosis immediately prior to admission.
Initial metastatic workup has been negative with negative abdominal and brain imaging.
She was also started on a Heparin gtt due to an SVC and IVC clot which was transitioned to Lovenox on [**11-22**].
Bleeding: On [**11-23**], she had an episode of bleeding from her PEG tube, increasing abdominal pain, and a hematocrit drop.
GI did an endoscopy on [**11-25**] and found an ulcer which was injected with epinephrine and her hematocrit remained stable, although dropped slightly (2 points of the day of discharge).
Her hematocrit should be checked daily for 2-3 days to ensure stability after discharge.
She had a video swallow study on the day of discharge which showed that she could not take po without aspirating and she chose to remain NPO except for ice chips.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]: One (1) Dose PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]: Ten (10) mL PO BID (2 times a day).
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]: 4-8 mg Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for nausea.
You were diagnosed with lung cancer, which was causing compression of the veins in your chest and causing your face and arms to swell.
You should have your hematocrit and Na checked after discharge daily for 2-3 days to ensure stability.
At the time of discharge, your hematocrit was 27.3 and your sodium level was 131.
