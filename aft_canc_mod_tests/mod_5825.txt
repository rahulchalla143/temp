CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2157-10-12**] 11:42 PM The heart, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged when compared to prior study.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2157-10-23**] 4:47 PM The previously seen patchy density in the right lower lobe is markedly improved and almost completely resolved.
Pulmonary vascular markings, cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2157-11-4**] 10:12 AM Supine and upright plain radiograph of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2157-11-6**] 2:24 PM CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST CHEST: There is no morphologically significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and the visualized portion of the large and small intestines are within normal limits.
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2157-11-9**] 3:45 PM There are patent nasal-antral ostia, bilaterally.
There are no air-fluid levels to suggest acute sinusitis.
Minimal sphenoid and ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening, without air-fluid levels to suggest acute sinusitis.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2157-11-18**] 3:59 PM New right middle lobe consolidation.
[**11-27**] BAL GRAM STAIN (Final [**2157-11-27**]):       1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
Gram stain is an equally sensitive means of detecting Nocardia in a       primary specimen.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2157-11-29**]):    NO GROWTH, <1000 CFU/ml.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
Cultures sent, Chest x-ray with likely pneumonia.
Pt febrile despite being on meropenem, vancomycin, caspofungin, acyclovir, with no blood cultures or catheter tip cultures positive to date.
Her QTc was monitored while on Procainamide.
UOP declined, lactate rose to 14. .
Later that evening, patient's BP and HR began to decline, and she passed away peacefully with family by bedside.
Family agreed to an autopsy to shed light on the cause for her hypoxia/pulmonary dysfunction as well as for the subacute worsening of hemodynamic status, decreased UOP, and elevated lactate.
