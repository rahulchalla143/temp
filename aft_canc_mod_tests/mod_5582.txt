ECG Study Date of [**2117-3-10**]  3:30:56 PM Atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response and a ventricular premature beat.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2117-2-28**] no significant change.
Patient was treated emperically with zosyn and vancomycin (1000mg given [**3-10**] 1900 and 1250mg given [**2117-3-12**] am) and his antibiotics were stopped on [**3-13**] as he had no signs of infection and a negative infectious workup including negative blood and urine cultures a CXR with evidence of pneumonia.

On Discharge his creatinine was 4.3, with a BUN of 113, and a bicarb of 19.
# Chronic diastolic and systolic heart failure per prior notes, though an echo from [**2117-1-31**] showed an EF 50-55% with [**Hospital1 **]-atrial ennlargement, RV enlargement and severe TR.
He had an ntBNP of 7000 similar to prior values.
He can resume torsemide on Monday [**3-15**] with close attention to his electrolytes and volume status.
Coumadin was held on admission as he had an INR of 3.4, and coumadin 2mg was resumed on [**3-13**] when his INR was 2.3.
**Both digoxin and metoprol held at discharge given concerns of bradycardia and hypotension with metoprolol, flucuating renal function in respect to digoxin (level 0.8 on admit) []Digoxin can be resumed per his PCP  # Hypothyroidism  continued on levothyroxine  # Myeloproliferative Disease His hydroxyurea was held in setting of ARF and was resumed on discharge.
Pharmacist confirmed that his prior dose is OK even with his creatinine clearance of [**11-15**].
We discussed code status, but the patient seemed to want his doctors to give [**Name5 (PTitle) **] a shot at CPR, even despite explaining how the majority of patients do not survive a cardiac arrest and with his illnesses it would be less likely and that cardiac resuscitation can be just as invasive or more than dialysis and if he survived he would need dialysis.
