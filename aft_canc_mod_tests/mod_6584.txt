Large pelvic mass with rounded components within it certainly could represent a fibroid uterus although the differential includes malignant etiologies such as uterine sarcoma or spindle cell lesion.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
ECG Study Date of [**2148-3-12**]  9:04:52 PM Sinus rhythm.

ECG Study Date of [**2148-3-13**]  4:51:38 PM Normal sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2148-3-12**] no diagnostic interval change except for slowing of the rate.

It was received fresh in the operating room and consists of a piece of tan-yellow tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm.
The cervix measures 2.6 x 2.2 cm and the ectocervix measures 0.6 cm with a slit-like os.
TEE (Complete) Done [**2148-3-14**] at 10:25:44 AM      FINAL Conclusions 1.

CT pelvis/abd- large pelvic mass, L CFV thrombosis, L renal infarcts.
Hematology consult for hypercoagulable evaluation- lab work-up sent.
LVEF 55%.
Repeated CT pelvis w/&w/o con- same large pelvic mass, clot identified in the descending aorta, multiple pulmonar emboli, multiple renal infarcts.
