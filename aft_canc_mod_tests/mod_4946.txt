She was originally admitted to [**Hospital3 **] from [**11-13**] - [**11-18**] for fevers, chills, and abdominal pain, and was found to have one blood culture positive for Strep viridans.
She re-presented to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 **] ER on [**11-23**] with chills, severe confusion, Temp 101.5 and HR 109.
Both of these ABX were discontinued on [**11-26**] secondary to negative blood cultures to date and the fact that they may have caused her to be nauseous.
She was thought to be fluid overloaded and was given lasix 40mg IV as well as 2 units of PRBCs for an Hct of 25.
On [**11-28**] she received a TTE which showed normal systolic function and no vegitation; ESR that day was 65 and CRP was 174.
On [**11-29**] she had temperature of 101 with rigors and had SVT with rate in the 170s.
MRI was obtained in part for her mental status changes which showed extensive metastatic disease but no acute pathology.
Per D/C summary, blood cultures from [**11-30**] had 2/4 bottles positive for Strep viridans and Zosyn was discontinued.
Her WBC count continued to increase.
The patient received one dose of Imipenam before transfer on [**12-4**] since Blood culture on [**12-1**] had one out of four positive for Klebsiella which was sensitive to Imipenam.
Workup in [**10/2196**] revealed breast cancer metastatic to the lymph nodes and bone (invasive carcinoma with lobular and tubular features), grade 1 ER and PR positive, HER-2/neu negative on FISH.
Liver biopsy performed on [**2197-1-3**] was consistent with moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with pancreaticobiliary tumor and not her breast cancer.
Imaging in [**4-/2197**] demonstrated excellent response of her breast cancer, particularly her bony metastasis; however, her liver mass was essentially stable.

#Bacteremia with Klebsiella and Strep Viridans: At [**Hospital3 635**] hosptial, blood cultures were positive for Klebsiella and Strep Viridans.
She also received a MRI abdomen / MCRP which demonstrated gallbladder carcinoma with invasion into the hepatic parenchyma with associated extensive biliary dilatation as previously seen, and four lesions which appear well delineated and are of fluid consistency seen within segments V and VI of the liver.
She was continued Vancomycin/Meropenem  based on culture sensitivities from [**Hospital3 **] hospital.
Since [**12-9**], LFTs were uptrending as was Tbili, suggesting an obstructive picture.
On [**12-11**], she had an ERCP which showed debris and narrowing of the lumen of the ampulla.
Given that she continued to [**Month/Year (2) **] with no clear source, the decision was made to aspirate the liver lesions for further characterization.
The patient had SBP up to 190s requiring labetalol which she responded well to initially.
An EKG showed questionable a fib vs a flutter and we started to use IV lopressor to bring down her blood pressure which she tolerated well.
