CXR (AP) [**2178-2-15**] FINDINGS: There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
Lung volumes are low.
CT ABD/PELVIS, NONCONTRAST [**2178-2-15**] IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2178-2-20**] KUB FINDINGS: Supine and left lateral decubitus frontal views of the abdomen demonstrate gas in multiple non-dilated loops of small and large bowel.
ECG [**2178-2-15**] Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats.
PROCEDURE NOTES [**2178-2-18**] ABDOMINAL ARTERIOGRAM W/EMBOLIZATION FINDINGS: 1.
SMA angiogram did not demonstrate any supply to the liver.
Common hepatic arteriogram demonstrated right and left hepatic arterial branches, GDA and cystic arteries.
Celiac arteriogram demonstrated significantly diminished flow to the right hepatic artery, with normal flow into the splenic, left gastric, left hepatic and gastroduodenal arteries.
Right femoral arteriogram demonstrated access of a normal caliber right common femoral artery with bifurcation well below the access site.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated hepatic angiogram and Gelfoam embolization.
Brief Hospital Course: 72M w/hx alcoholic cirrhosis & multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma who initially presented to OSH with sharp, sudden-onset right-sided abdominal pain and distention, found to have hemoperitoneum and Hct 17.
#HEMOPERITONEUM FROM BLEEDING RIGHT LOBE HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA LESION: Pt was admitted to [**Hospital3 7571**]ICU with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain, distension, and blood loss anemia with Hct 17 and CT-demonstrated hemoperitoneum from bleeding R lobe hepatoma.
He was hemodynamically stable on arrival but required w 2 units of additional PRBCs for initial Hct 22.7.
Hct was stable thereafter at ~33 at time of discharge.
When admitted he was found to have severe (asymptomatic) hypertension to SBP 190s-200s.
Blood pressures were ultimately better controlled after achieving better control of pain and nausea and hydralazine was successfully weaned and labetolol dose decreased after pt started on home amlodipine 10 mg QD plus PRN ativan.
Labs and blood smear showed no evidence for hemolysis.
[**Month (only) 116**] need blood pressure check and antihypertensive med adjustment at these follow-up appointments.
You required 6 blood transfusions, 2 at [**Hospital3 7571**]and 4 here.
