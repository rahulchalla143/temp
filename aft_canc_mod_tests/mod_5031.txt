- Levofloxacin and metronidazole given to cover aspiration pneumonia (day [**5-23**] on d/c) - checked ECG (no change) and ruled out for ACS - supplemental O2 to maintain saturation >91% given - CXR shows improvement of aspiration event .
- rpt Head CT stable SDH - will need repeat again in [**2-20**] weeks (discussed with PCP's office).
Per neurosurgery, no IV heparin, no coumadin x 1 week from event, SC heparin and baby ASA OK, will need repeat head CT with contrast once renal function allows in [**3-20**] weeks as above - although OK to restart coumadin by [**7-11**], will hold as pt high risk for repeat fall and bleed on coumadin -> defer to PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] not restart in-house (discussed with PCP's office) - restarted baby ASA at D/C .
Meningioma on Head CT - needs repeat head CT in [**3-20**] weeks for further evaluation and characterization in [**3-20**] weeks as above - this communicated to PCP's office.
# CV: Ischemia: No acute ischemic episode - ruled out MI with three sets of enzymes - no ECG changes - on rosuvastatin, metoprolol, baby ASA.
Followup Instructions: With your pcp [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 6 weeks; repeat head CT in two weeks (to be arranged by your PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] called him to notify).
