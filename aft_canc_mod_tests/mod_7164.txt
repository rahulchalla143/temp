Rate 74; PR 130; QRS 82; QT/QTc 448/472 [**2172-3-31**] Cardiology ECHO (TTE): The left atrium is dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-11-22**], findings are similar.
He was initially admitted to the ICU, where blood pressure remained stable after 3L of IVF in the ED without the use of pressors.
On arrival to the ED, respiratory rate was 24 and temperature in the ED was 101.1, meeting SIRS criteria.
He received 3L of IVF in the ED, and on arrival to the ICU pressures were stable with SBPs > 100.
Urine cultures from admission were negative, and the pt's cefepime was discontinued on HOD3.
The vancomycin was continued until blood cultures were negative for 48 hrs, and was discontinued on HOD4.
- recommend continuing PO vancomycin to finish 14 day course (last day of treatment [**2172-4-12**]) - recommend C. Diff precautions - recommend serial abdominal exams and standing aggressive bowel regimen .
His dyspnea slowly improved with diuresis, and serial CXRs remained reassuring against pneumonia or florid pulmonary edema.
From HOD10 to discharge the patient's respiratory status remained stable at his baseline (O2 sats 88 to 97% on RA, 94 to 97% on 2L NC).
The patient's home lasix was stopped in the MICU due to hypotension, and his creatinine trended down to 1.5 by HOD3.
Given that the pt's respiratory status improved substantialy with diuresis, an increase in creatinine was tolerated.
Creatinine increased to 3.2 by HOD12, and renal was consulted.
Creatinine stabilized by HOD13, and trended down by discharge to 3.1.
His Hct has ranged from 25 to 28 during this admission.
His crit was stable at 28 upon discharge.
#) Diastolic CHF Last echo [**11/2170**] showed preserved EF > 55%.
