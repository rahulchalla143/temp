HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient underwent a routine PAP smear which revealed high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and subsequently underwent a loop electrosurgical excision procedure on [**2189-6-1**].
Last mammogram was in [**2189**] and was normal.
Vital signs revealed a temperature of 37.5, pulse was 85 to 115, blood pressure was 110/55, oxygen saturation was 95% to 100% on 3 liters via nasal cannula.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.
Pulmonary was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
On postoperative day four, when trying to wean the patient off of oxygen, it was noted that her saturation dropped to the 70s and 80s.
Prior to this, the patient had a chest x-ray on postoperative day one.
This was done as the patient was requiring oxygen as previously mentioned, and the x-ray showed bibasilar atelectasis with patchy air space consolidation.
On postoperative day four, secondary to the patient's oxygen requirements and inability to wean off of supplemental oxygen, and an arterial blood gas that was 7.48/38/42/32/6, there was great concern that rather than this being venous that the patient might in fact be in respiratory compromise.
A CT angiogram was done, and the patient was noted to have pulmonary emboli in the right lobe and segmental branches to the right lower lobe, and a suggestion of thrombus in the left lower lobe vessels.
The patient was immediately started on a heparin drip for a goal of PTT of 60 to 100.
A STAT hematocrit was sent and was noted to be 19.5 with an INR of 3.5.
The patient was assessed to have an abdominal bleed, and an immediate transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells was started.
The patient's hematocrit stabilized after her 3 units.
However, on serial abdominal examinations it was noted that the patient's wound had cellulitis and that her incision was beginning to open up.
The patient underwent the procedure on [**2189-7-22**] for evacuation of 3 liters of hemoperitoneum.
The patient's Coumadin dose was adjusted between 2.5 and 7.5 to try and obtain an INR between 1.8 and 2.2.
The patient was also to see her primary care physician to have her INR checked every three days times one week after discharge.
At that time, the patient would have seen Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] and also her primary care physician for determination of how often the patient was to have her INR checked for a goal between 1.8 and 2.2.
