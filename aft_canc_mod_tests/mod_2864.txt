Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2153-6-1**], the size of the pericardial effusion has decreased and tamponade is gone.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis at the site noted on recent CT or elsewhere in the right lower extremity.
TTE was performed to rule out re-accumulation and was negative.
As a courtesy to the patient and his oncologist, torso CT was performed for staging.
Therefor, the patient's discharge was delayed overnight to allow for careful monitoring and LENI of the R leg, which was negative for thrombosis, notably including the site of visualization on CT. .
Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
