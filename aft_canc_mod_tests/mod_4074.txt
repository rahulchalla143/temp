Her ANC improved to greater than 500 on [**5-17**] and greater than 1000 on [**5-18**].
Further evaluation of these lesions will be determined in the future hospitalization course.
She had blood cultures sent, which were negative.
There was debates between Pulmonary, who was consulted for evaluation of this patient given her persistent nodules, serial CT scans during the month showed that she actually had some improvement in the ground-glass opacities as well as the hilar pulmonary nodules.
There was a concern for possible rebronching and evaluation of these nodules with a tissue biopsy versus a VATS to rule out fungal infection.
At the time of this dictation, the plan was to continue monotherapy for the atypical Mycobacterium with clarithromycin and followup serial CT exams for further evaluations and possible adjustment of her treatment.
The plan was if she continued to spike high fevers and had a hemodynamic instability, plan was to broaden antibiotic coverage and possible further invasive tissue evaluation.
A    repeat torso CT on [**5-21**] showed persistent pulmonary    nodules, but no evidence of bronchial compression.
They were biopsied and the cultures were consistent with gram-negative rods and Pseudomonas as well as a throat culture, which grew out Pseudomonas.
However, she continued to have new spiking fevers to 103 and a urine culture grew out vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus x2.
A torso CT was performed to evaluate for an occult abscess and in the setting, aztreonam and linezolid were empirically started.
Torso CT showed no hepatosplenic candidiasis, but resolving bilateral pulmonary disease and continued nodules of unclear etiology.
Dermatology was reconsulted on evaluation of this patient, and they recommended that this was likely due to a drug rash secondary to aztreonam and the patient was changed from aztreonam to ciprofloxacin as a result.
On [**5-26**], her ciprofloxacin was D/C'd and she was covered just on AmBisome and clarithromycin, however, further evaluation with Pulmonary and Infectious Disease consult regarding pulmonary nodules recommended discontinuing the AmBisome given the fact that the pulmonary nodules are likely consistent with either atypical Mycobacterium infection versus leukemia, and she was maintained on clarithromycin monotherapy with reimage with possible repeat CT.  A repeat CT was performed on [**5-31**], which showed stable pulmonary nodules and no interval change other than a left pleural effusion.
She had an acute hepatitis, which was unclear.
An abdominal ultrasound was performed that was unrevealing except for sludge in the gallbladder.
Further evaluation is pending, however, her transient transaminitis and hepatitis resolved without any intervention and her LFTs trended down over the next three days down to her baseline in the 80s.
She had a MRI of her spine back in    [**Month (only) 547**] without evidence of compression as she had no acute    issues during this hospital course.
Serial    Clostridium difficiles were negative and this resolved    acutely after Imodium was started.
She received doses of vitamin K during this    hospitalization stay with a stable INR in 1.4.
The patient's albumin was low during this    hospitalization stay.
Chest x-ray was performed, which showed improvement    of her right pleural effusion.
Urinalysis was negative    for blood.
An abdominal CT was performed, which showed    initially splenic, hepatic, and renal infarcts.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed with bubble study, which questioned an intraatrial shunt and paradoxical emboli given the splenic, hepatic, and renal infarcts seen and the abdominal pain associated.
A definitive transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, which showed no intraatrium septum, however, there was incidental note of a thickened aortic arch wall with question of clot.
A MRI was performed and obtained to evaluate this thickening and it was noted to be normal caliber for an aortic wall.
However, on [**5-21**], she subsequently had increasing pain in her left flank and a repeat CT was performed, which showed resolution of the splenic and renal infarcts, and question whether or not these were infarcts to begin with given the resolution.
She was started on Morphine PCA, which was changed to Fentanyl PCA, given some dizziness and was weaned off to an increase in her oxycodone dose, and this was subsequently D/C'd and changed over to Fentanyl patch.
General Surgery was consulted, and they evaluated this patient, and they did not feel that this was an acute abdomen given the fact that her abdominal  CT was unremarkable.
Biopsy results were consistent with a drug rash.
A punch biopsy was    attempted, however, this was aborted due to increasing    pain on her flank region and instead, Derm just swabbed    these cultures.
Cultures were negative for organisms or    polys at this time.
At the time of dictation, General Surgery was asked to consult and possibly due a surgical biopsy of these lesions.
Differential for these lesions was likely pus related to abscess formation in the setting of reconstitution of her counts, and persistent Mycobacterial-disseminated infection.
