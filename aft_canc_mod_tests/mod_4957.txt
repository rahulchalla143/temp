On [**2109-11-15**] she had lumbar MRI which was significant for multiple abnormalities including infiltration of L4 resulting in a compression fracture with retropulsion of fragments and moderately severe spinal stenosis, and infiltration of T11 with associated deformity of the right lateral aspect of the spinal cord.
On [**2109-11-20**] she had a core biopsy of L4 vertebra; malignant cells consistent with metastatic breast cancer.
On [**2109-11-20**] she also had body CT significant for widespread skeletal metastases, a 3cm left breast mass, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
She underwent left breast core biopsy on [**2109-11-28**]; grade 3 IDC, ER/PR+, HER2 equivocal by IHC and non-amplified by FISH.
