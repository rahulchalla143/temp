He had a CT torso in w/u showing no metastatic disease, but a thyroid nodule which, on u/s was shown to be a simple cyst.
He had a nuclear stress test in [**3-12**] showing a fixed, severe perfusion defect in mid and basal inferior wall and basal inferoseptum, and basal inferior wall hypokinesis with normal systolic function.
His baseline creatinine is 1.1.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to inferior hypokinesis and posterior dyskinesis; the other walls are hyperdynamic.
Abdominal aorta aneurism is incomplety imaged.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Further evaluation with arthrocentesis may be helpful.
Patent vasculature with resistive indices in the upper, mid and lower pole of the transplant kidney ranging from 0.74 to 0.83 somewhat increased from [**2092**].
[**9-16**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-9**], there are low lung volumes in this patient with intact midline sternal wires.

This was felt to be multifactorial - from a component of fluid overload (he was several liters positive during and after surgery), probable hospital acquired aspiration pneumonia (with new bandemia and fever) and compressive atelectasis.
At the time of discharge, he was euvolemic and had excellent oxygen saturations on room air.
His heart rate was well controlled on the beta blocker.
The patient did have new findings on echocardiogram of posterior LV dyskinesia but negative cardiac enzymes and he was felt NOT to have suffered any ischemic cardiac injury.
A head CT found possible hypodensity in the left thalamus.
The CT scan finding was not further worked up as it was unlikely to change management.
He may need a MRI of his head in the future.
The white count was borderline however, and as such orthopedic hand surgery took the patient for a wash out.
Cultures were followed carefully and these were no growth.
Once the cultures were negative, he was started on a brief prednisone taper.
His creatinine did increase to 1.6 two days after his foley catheter was discontinued.
Creatinine improved to 1.4, then worsened to 1.6.
He recommended that Mr. [**Known lastname 103570**] receive feraheme prior to discharge and be set-up to have a repeat injection on Monday [**9-27**].
He planned on seeing the patient at that visit, having repeat labs and managing his renal function from there.
Incidental: CT chest on [**2100-9-9**] showed a lesion in the right lobe of the thyroid gland.
