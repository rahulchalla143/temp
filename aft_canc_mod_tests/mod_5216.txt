Correlation is made to the recent head CT examination, performed 7 hours earlier.
As noted on the head CT examination, there is a large space-occupying mass lesion involving the right frontoparietal lobe measuring 6.3 x 5.5 cm and resulting in significant surrounding vasogenic edema and sulcal effacement.
The findings were conveyed to the emergency room physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 2 a.m. and discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by the resident when the CAT scan was obtained.
IMPRESSION: Displacement of the right anterior and middle cerebral arteries by the presence of the mass and subfalcine herniation as noted on the brain MRI report and the previously dictated CT report of the brain.
TECHNIQUE: CT of the head without IV contrast.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 51 year old man with fever 103 - s/p crani REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o aspiration - pt coming down for stat head CT sp fall - please coordinate AP CHEST, 1:43 P.M., [**9-5**].
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-29**]:  Lung volumes have improved and right lower lobe consolidation has cleared.
he was admitted to the ICU for close observation and frequent neuro checks as his Ct of the brain demonstrated MLS wtih vasogenic edema.
he was started on mannitol and decardon, and his exam improved over the course of a doay or so.
He was evaluated by the renal team for his CRI, as we needed a CTA of the brain to further evaluate the tumor bed for pre-op study.
His post op scans were stable.
Pt with fevers- cultures grew out pseudomonas in his blood and urine.
