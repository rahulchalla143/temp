Pt saw a new PCP today who noted large abdominal mass on exam and sent her to [**Hospital1 **].
US at OSH demonstrated a 20cm mass in abdomen as well as lab abnormalities including hyperkalemia (K 6.1) with ECG findings, renal failure (creatinine of 11.5), hyponatremia (Na 121), leukocytosis (WBC of 20.1) and anemia (Hct of 17 s/p one unit of PRBCs) leading to x-fer to [**Hospital1 18**].
In the ED, the pt underwent a CT scan which confirmed the finding of a 20 cm mass.
HEENT: temporal wasting, EOMI, anicteric, mm dry Chest: CTA bilaterally CV: rrr, s1, s2, no m/r/g Abd: large palpable hard mass in LLQ, which is dull to percussion, slightly tender to palpation.
Back: no CVA tenderness, no spinal or paraspinal tenderness Ext: wwp, no c/c/e   Pertinent Results: Pelvic CT [**2181-12-12**]: "1.
Nephrostogram confirmed good R nephrostomy placement, and it was felt that R kidney was probably more permanantly damaged from pyelonephritis as well as a more complete obstruction.
A Renal perfusion scan showed almost no flow on R, decreased flow L.  Her new baseline Cr ranges from 3.5 - 3.9.
Pyleonephritis with bacteremia: Pt grew pan-sensitive E coli from R nephrostomy tube and blood cultures, and was treated with a 2 week course of Levofloxacin.
CEA 2.8 (WNL), CA-125 73 (high).
A pre-op CXR showed no evidence of mass or PNA.
A MRI of the head was negative for metastasis.
Small bowel obstruction: The pt developed nausea and vomiting and increasing abdominal distention on [**12-21**], and a portable KUB showed evidence of partial SBO.
Anemia: Iron studies were checked, and this was felt to be [**1-17**]: #1 anemia of chronic disease, [**1-17**] low epogen from kidney invasion + #2 bleeding into the tumor.
The pt initially required multiple transfusions to increase her hct to > 30, which was Gyn/Onc's goal given anticipated blood loss in the OR.
Her hct was fairly stable after initial transfusions, though she did require 2 more units of PRBCs over the next week as her hct slowly drifted down, most likely [**1-17**] #2 above.
The pt was then transferred to the gynecologic oncology service on [**12-28**] for an exploratory laparotomy, resection of pelvic mass, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and lysis of adhesions.
She remained stable after transfer to the floor, with HR and BP well within the normal range.
Her O2 saturation remained stable on room air for the remainder of her hospital stay.
Heme: The pt received a total of 7u pRBCs, 4u FFP, and 1 6-pack of platelets intraoperatively.
Her Hct and INR were followed serially postoperatively, and she received an additional 3u pRBCs and 2u FFP in the ICU to maintain a Hct of 25 and a normal INR.
Her Hct remained stable at ~30 until POD#7 when it slowly drifted down over several days to a nadir of 26; she was transfused an additional 2u pRBCs to achieve a Hct of 30 in order to optimize her response to chemotherapy.
The pt's hematocrit remained stable around 28-30 for the remainder of her hospital stay.
A Gram stain of the fluid drained from her tumors grew sparse pan-sensitive E. coli.
Her NG tube was left in place postoperatively, and its output decreased to ~250cc in a day.
The pt underwent her second chemotherapy cycle on [**2182-1-30**] and was treated w/ both carboplatin and taxol given the pt's improvement in overall functional status.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed.
Fentanyl 100 mcg/hr Patch 72HR Sig: One (1) Patch 72HR Transdermal Q72H (every 72 hours): Please apply both 100 mcg patch with 25 mcg patch for total dose of 125 mcg every 72 hours.
