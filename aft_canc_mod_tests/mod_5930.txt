Of note, knowing that her abdomen was getting distended and a paracentesis might be needed, patient had stopped her daily warfarin 4 mg 2 days prior to admission.

Her INR was found to be 6.7.
Hct 21 (from 30 last week).

IMAGING: # CXR [**2104-12-15**]: No acute intrathoracic process.
Two subcentimeter liver hypodensities, not fully characterized, but concerning for mets.
# Abdominal pain: Abd/pel CT showing worsening ascites and possibly liver mets.
Pt received paracentesos on [**12-17**] with improvment in pain (2L off), and fluid culture was negative to date so no concern for SBP.
Given increased distension, there was concern for SBO and KUB showed partial obstruction likely [**2-26**] to peritoneal mets.
# Anticoaguluation INR: INR 6.7 on admission, likely from interaction between capecitabine and warfarin (on warfarin for H/O of UE DVT).
Her INR was allowed to trend down in the setting of parcentesis, and pt received 2 [**Location 16678**] prior to the procedure.
# Anemia: Admission Hct was 21 which was down from 30 the prior week.
Initially she had poor Hct response but after her 2 Units on [**12-18**] she had 6pt Hct increase from 22.5-->28.7.
We feel that her anemia is likely related to her chemo, as there was no obvious bleeding and hemolysis labs were negative.
#ARF:  Pt noted to have a creatinine bump to 1.5 from 0.9 with subsequent slow upward trend after this.
Urine lytes revealed a FeNa of 0.1% further supporting a pre-renal etiology and urine eosinophils were negative.
On [**12-21**] pt was noted to have poor urine output, so renal u/s obtained which showed No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Despite this, her creatinine continued to elevate.
# Goals of Care: A family meeting was held on [**2104-12-25**] with the Ms. [**Known lastname 10793**] sister, her HCP, as well as other family members.
