MRI brain with contrast [**2151-8-12**] FINDINGS:  Again noted are numerous intracranial enhancing lesions, of various sizes, compatible with the known extensive intracranial metastases.
CT head [**2151-8-12**] FINDINGS:  Since the previous MRI this morning, the patient is status post cranioplasty in the left posterior fossa.
MRI brain [**2151-8-13**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Intrinsic T1 hyperintensity limits evaluation for residual tumor.
CT head [**2151-8-13**] IMPRESSION:  Status post left frontal and posterior carinal fossa craniotomies with expected post-surgical gas and fluid within the resection bed and middle blood products; stable appearance of mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
MRI brain [**2151-8-14**] IMPRESSION: Status post left frontal and posterior cranial fossa craniotomy with expected post-surgical changes and gas, fluid within the resection bed.
LUE dopplers [**2151-8-15**] Non-occlusive thrombus of the left axillary and basilic veins.
CT Head [**2151-8-16**] Interval improvement of the post-surgical changes at the left frontal lobe.
Stable post-surgical changes at the left cerebellar hemisphere with mild to moderate mass effect on the fourth ventricle, unchanged from the prior study on [**8-13**].
Lateral ventricular enlargment stable since [**2151-8-13**], and slightly improved since [**2151-8-9**].
A posrtoperative CT scan and MRI scan showed expected post-op changes.
LOS fluid balance was about 1L negative so 500cc NS bolus was given.
LUE dopplers were ordered and showed thrombus in the LUE at the axillary/basilic.
A dilantin level was checked and was noted to be 15.6.
The patient had a CT head which showed improvement.
Currently, INR is 1.2.
