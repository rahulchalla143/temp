While obtaining a CT she began to vomit so she was intubated.
CT revealed a left parietal lesion.

Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance.
CT shows a partially calcified mass in the left parietooccipital region consistent with a meningioma.
CT angiography demonstrates increased vascularity in the region, but exact origin of this vascular structure is difficult to ascertain given the limited ability of the CTA, but there appears to be some meningeal supply from the superficial aspect of the mass.
[**5-25**] CXR preop: The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.
[**5-25**] MRI brain Wand: Unchanged enhancing extra-axial mass lesion along the left parietal region, with mild mass effect on the left parietal lobe and associated with perilesional edema.
[**5-26**] CT head: Expected post-surgical changes with a small amount of hemorrhage and pneumocephalus in the region of previously visualized left occipital mass.
Previously visualized calcified occipital masse is no longer seen  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2132-5-27**] 3:21 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2132-6-2**]: IMPRESSION:  Status post endotracheal tube removal and tracheostomy tube placement.
CXR [**2132-6-3**]: FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube in standard position.
She underwent MRI imaging which revealed a left parietal lesion, likely meningioma.
She was extubated and her neurological exam was nonfocal and so she was transferred to the step down unit.
Postoperative head CT showed post operative changes, but was stable.
MRI of the head was performed to evaluate for residual tumor.
