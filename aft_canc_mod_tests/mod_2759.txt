Blood pressure is 130/80, no abnormal laboratory results.
Mother was brought to labor and delivery on the day of delivery, following ATU evaluation, which demonstrated nonreactive fetal heart rate with variable decelerations and minimal variability.
Labor and delivery monitoring showed occasional small variable decelerations.
Apgars were seven at one minute and eight at five minutes.
Transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and treatment.
Repeat D stick was 23.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, heart rate was 150; respiratory rate of 44; blood pressure mean 40; oxygen saturation in room air greater than 90 percent and placed in nasal cannula oxygen for transitional marginal desaturations in the low 90's to high 80's.
Birth weight 2115 grams, 25 to 50 percentile.
Admission length was 44 cm, 25th percentile.
Discharge length 47 cm, greater than 25th percentile.
Admission head circumference was 31 cm, 25th to 50th percentile.
Discharge head circumference 33, 50th percentile.
Baseline heart rate 130 to 160.
Blood pressure stable with systolics in the 60's to 70's; diastolics in the 30's to 40's and means in the 50's.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Initially, the baby was npo and received a total of three D-10-W boluses, 2 cc per kg for hypoglycemia.
Infant had electrolytes on day of life three which revealed a sodium of 142; potassium hemolyzed at 6.4; chloride 108; C02 21.
Last electrolytes on [**11-2**] were 142 sodium; 5.8 potassium; 106 chloride; 26 C02.
Baby did exhibit physiologic jaundice, had a peak bilirubin on day of life two of 16 and was treated with double phototherapy which responded with a rebound bilirubin on [**11-7**] of 5.9, 0.5, 5.4.
Hematology:  Infant's admission hematocrit was 55.
Infectious disease:  Because of her premature delivery, she had an initial CBC and blood culture sent.
Her white count was 7.5; 40 polys, 0 bands, 43 lymphs, 35 nucleated red blood cells.
She was clinically well other than her hypoglycemia which was thought to be related to maternal risk factor of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Audiology screening was performed with an automated auditory brain stem response.
Ophthalmology: Examination not indicated, based on gestational age of greater than 32 weeks.
