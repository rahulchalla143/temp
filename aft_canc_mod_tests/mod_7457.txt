In the ED, T 98.9, HR 95, BP 142/59, RR 18, 97%RA.
His neuro exam was nonfocal.
Head CT showed no acute abnormality.
CXR and urinalysis unremarkable.
His labs were notable for Na 117, Cr 0.8, WBC 2.3 with 66% neutrophils, Hct 22.0, plt 194.
A maternal uncle had leukemia, and another maternal uncle had lung cancer.
Physical Exam: VS: T 99.8, BP 160/70, HR 102, RR 16, 95%RA GEN: Elderly man sleeping in bed but easily arousable, in NAD HEENT: EOMI, sclera anicteric, conjunctivae clear NECK: Supple CV: Regular, slightly tachycardic, normal S1, S2.

Prominent sulci and ventricles, most likely age-related involutionary changes.
CXR [**2178-3-25**]: 1.
CTA chest [**2178-3-27**]: (prelim) 1.
CXR [**2178-3-27**]: (prelim) Bilateral moderate sized pleural effusions.
Pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly.
Given this and his 2L O2 requirement, he went for CTA chest, which showed no PE, but large bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis.
He was agitated since the CTA, and around 6pm, he looked cyanotic and had a desaturation to 60% on 2L, improved to 93% on NRB.
He was given 20mg lasix IV with brisk urine output, as well as 0.5mg IV haloperidol and 10mg IV hydralazine (BP ~180/90) and transferred to the ICU.
Stat CXR showed diffuse pulmonary edema, and with his concurrent hypertension, he was started on a nitroglycerin drip.
His BP improved and overshot transiently down to 70/30, but rapidly improved to ~130s/80s with cessation of drip.
His O2 sats remained in the 90s on high-flow oxygen mask.
He was sent for CT head given his altered mental status and possibly new anisocoria.
Post-mortem exam was declined.
CT head with no acute process on admission and was planned to be repeated given anisocoria, but aborted given above events.
Anemia: Hct 22 on admission.
