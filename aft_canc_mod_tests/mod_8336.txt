CXR [**5-21**]: No pneumonia.
BONE MARROW BIOPSY ([**5-22**]): DIAGNOSIS: Acute myelogenous leukemia (see note).
Note: cytogenetic studies revealed that 20 of 20 cell analyzed have trisomy 11.
WBC count is decreased.
Platelet count appears decreased; rare giant forms are present.
Erythroid maturation cannot be assessed due to paucity of erythroid precursors.
Differential shows:  Blasts 60%, Promyelocytes 3%, Myelocytes 17%, Metamyelocytes 5%, Bands/Neutrophils 5%, Plasma cells 2%, Lymphocytes 5%, Erythroid 3%.
BIOPSY SLIDES The core biopsy contains periosteum on both ends indicating that it represents a tangential biopsy of the subcortical marrow space, which is frequently hypocellular and not representative.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**5-23**]): IMPRESSION: Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
CT SINUS ([**5-26**]) IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute sinusitis.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS ([**6-24**]): IMPRESSION: -A.
However, at this point, the amylase and lipase are normal.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**7-2**]): Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-5-23**], there is now a small pericardial effusion.
The left ventricular ejection fraction is now somewhat reduced.
MRI HEAD ([**7-9**]): Sagittal T1 and axial T1 images were obtained through the brain.
Further imaging was not performed as the patient declined completion of the examination.
The gadolinium portion of the examination was not performed.
IMPRESSION: Limited examination of the brain with pre-contrast T1-weighted images only performed.
CXR ([**7-9**]): IMPRESSION: No pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 15063**] is a 74-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer s/p mastectomy, radiation and chemotherapy; colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy; and HTN who initially presented with SOB and was found to have pancytopenia (WBC 1.6, Hct 16.4, Plt 30) with a subsequent bone marrow biopsy consistent with AML.
She initially presented with SOB and pancytopenia (WBC 1.6, Hct 16.4, Plt 30, ANC were 390) to the medicine team on admission.
Peripheral smear showed 30% blasts.
A bone marrow aspiration showed Acute Myeloid Leukemia with trisomy 11. .
Echocardiogram was done that showed normal LVEF >55%, minimal aortic stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation and Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
She was closely monitored for tumor lysis syndrome, but this never developed.
The day 14 bone marrow biopsy was not done since it was determined that the results would not change her management.
CT of the sinus was done which came back negative for sinusitis.
All blood cx and urine cultures remained negative.
Vancomycin was discontinued after 72 hours and given a lack of other focal signs for infection, it was thought that her fevers might be related to her underlying hematologic malignancy.
A CT showed acute cholecystitis.
A rash developed on [**6-10**], which disappeared after discontinuing ambisome.
Caspofungin, Flagyl, and Meropenem were each stopped on [**6-29**], and 28 respectively.
The PCA was discontinued on [**6-21**] as her pain had decreased and WBC and ANC had increased.
Urine osmolality was 364 and plasma osm 268.
Betablocker was started for blood pressure control.
Initial set of enzymes was negative.
EKG normal on admission.
Further SOB on [**6-15**] was likely due to fluid overload; she got IV lasix 20mg x 1, and albuterol neb.
A LE Ultrasound was negative for DVT.
It was subsequently changed over a wire on [**2183-5-28**] by IR for proper placement into the IVC.
CXR on [**2183-6-4**] for a fever incidentally showed that the central line migrated back to the brachiocephalic vein.
