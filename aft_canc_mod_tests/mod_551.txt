A CT scan was performed on that occasion and revealed marked progression of her GIST tumor as compared to [**5-/2153**] and within this tumor an area of central hyperdensity in a blush-like pattern was identified,concerning for active intratumoral extravasation.
The patient was made NPO, on IVF and a foley catheter was placed for urine output monitoring.
Overnight serial Hct were obtained and she was given 2U of PRBC and 1U FFP.
On HD 2 since her INR continued to be high (1.9)she was given 10mg of Vit K IV.
A selective angiogram was performed but no bleeding source was identified at that time.
Between HD2 and 3 the patient's O2 requiremets increased and her CXR showed minimally progressive pulmonary edema.
An echo was also performed on HD 3 and showed a mildly dilated L atrium, moderate symmetric L ventricular hyperthrophy and a LVEF >50%.
Her Hct had remained stable around 30 on repeated checks and she was therefore advanced to a clear liquid diet, which was well tolerated and transferred to the regular floor later that night.
Physical therapy was consulted for evaluation and she was cleared for home.
