C. diff testing was negative, and a repeat stool culture (prior from 12d prior to admission was negative) and ova & parasites were no growth to date at the time of discharge.
He should be re-evaluated for this in a few weeks (see follow-up appointments) and if his diarrhea has slowed (as his bowel recovers from broad spectrum antibiotics), his anti-diarrheals may be able to be tapered or stopped, and his oral potassium may be able to be stopped.
Echo [**2-/2195**] showed normal LVEF and no evidence of diastolic dysfuntion or R sided failure.
His potassium was stable and had only been repleted with oral medications.
