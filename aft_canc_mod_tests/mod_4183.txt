GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
See Conclusions for post-bypass data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of medications).
Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %).
Spontaneous echo contrast in noted in the LV, that resolved with systemic heparinization.
Provocative maneuvers were used, pt in trendelenburg, and BP 170/80, Eccentric anterior jet seen, billowing of the posterior leaflet and mild restriction of the anterior leaflet.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on the MR at 0830hrs.
He had an MSTEMI and had a Hct of 22.9 at the outside hospital.
He had an echo which revealed a 30-35% LVEF with global hypokinesis and 1+MR.
A capsule study showed 2 areas fof bleeding in the samll intestine but his Hct remained stable and he had a cardiac catth on [**3-11**] which revealed no obstructive disease in the LMCA, a focally calcified mid LAD lesion, 80% mid LCX lesions, and an 80% RCA stenosis.
The Epi was d/c'd on POD#1 and his chest tubes were d/c'd on POD#2.
