CXR demonstrated new L basilar infiltrate and bilateral pleural effusion.
CT abd/pelvis demonstrated known tumor, mildly distended stomach, with some fluid in the lower esophagus, could relate to partial gastric antral obstruction in the presence of symptoms.
CT abd/pelvis also showed pleural effusion, ascites, improved left hydronephrosis.
At time of transfer, patient had received 4L IVF and had a LIJ and two peripheral 18 gauge IVs.

- [**10/2166**] - CT abdomen w hypodense liver lesion and mesenteric band-like nodularity in the right upper quadrant concerning for peritoneal carcinomatosis, pleural thickening along the ascending colon.
- [**11/2166**] - colonoscopy w severe narrowing at the hepatic flexure [**12-25**] extrinsic compression, CT torso and MRCP demonstrated regular hypoenhancing mass centered within the gallbladder fossa and infiltrating portions of the right and left hepatic lobes, extending to hepatic flexure most c/w gallbladder cancer, also w loss of intervening fat plane between the extension of the tumor out of the liver and the hepatic flexure and duodenal bulb, intrahepatic bile duct dilation, extrinsic compression of the hepatic duct, and enhancing soft tissue nodules in the greater omentum consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis.
- [**2166-12-30**] - CT-guided liver biopsy carcinoma with clear cell features diffusely positive for cytokeratin cocktail and cytokeratin 7 and negative for Hep Par 1 packs 2 TTF-1, cytokeratin 20 and P63 most compatible with a tumor of biliary pancreatic or upper gastrointestinal origin - [**2167-1-5**] - KUB partial small-bowel obstruction - [**2167-1-9**] - Gemzar/cisplatin started - [**2167-1-20**] - Presentation w abd pain and elevated bilirubin, ERCP w 12mm long segment of severe narrowing, sphincterotomy and placement of WallFlex TM biliary RX uncovered stent .

[**2167-1-24**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Slight prominence of the hila, could be due to vascular engorgement.
[**2167-1-24**] CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON - Moderate-sized right and a small left pleural effusion, with bibasilar compressive atelectasis.
His CXR imaging demonstrated marked pleural effusions.
Possible sources of infection include: biliary obstruction or stent obstruction with gram negative or anaerobic enteric seeding vs. aspiration pneumonitis (CT imaging showed LLL opacification) or pneumonia vs. urinary tract infection.
Lactate 5.1 on admission, trending downward with IV fluid resuscitation.
His serial lactate and central venous oxygen saturations improved with broad spectrum antibiotics - Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Zosyn (started [**2167-1-24**]).
They recommended palliation with possible duodental stent placement in discussion with the gastroenterology team based on his imaging findings.
His imaging showed evidence of gastric antral obstruction.
# NAUSEA, EMESIS AND GASTRIC OUTLET OBSTRUCTION - CT imaging revealed tumor that extends to the gastric antrum and hepatic flexure with mildly distended stomach and some fluid in the lower esophagus; possibly related to partial gastric antral obstruction vs. delayed transit and slow emptying given his nausea and bilious emesis concerns.
# ACUTE RENAL INSUFFICIENCY - Patient presents with baseline creatinine of 0.7-0.9 now with admission creatinine of 1.4 in the setting of septic shock, hypotension and low urine output.
His RUQ ultrasound showed concern for no pneumobilia with possble obstruction at the level of his biliary stent.
