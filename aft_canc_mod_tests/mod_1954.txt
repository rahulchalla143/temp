CT [**2200-3-19**]: IMPRESSION:  1.
Limited evaluation of the more peripheral pulmonary vasculature due to patient respiratory motion.
Right lung base linear densities are unchanged since [**2198**], most consistent with chronic fibrotic changes.
ECHO [**2200-3-24**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
He was satting 95% on room air on discharge.
#DYSSYNCHRONY ON ECHO:  As per echocardiogram performed during admission, there is dyssynchrony between native heart beat and pacemaker.
CAD/TROPONIN ELEVATION:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a troponin elevation on admission--however, troponin was lower than on admission [**Hospital1 **] the week before (at [**Hospital1 3597**], troponin was 8.9).
Patient's platelet count should be re-checked in 3 days at rehab.
Extensive work-up completed on previous admission.
Patient was given low-dose haldol as needed for agitation (can be changed to an anti-psychotic with fewer extrapyramidal side effects if [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body is suspected) and will follow-up with geriatrics as an outpatient.
