AVR CABG in [**2110**] with [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tissue valve and    LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM.
Hematology workup was in progress when the patient was discharged with plans to follow-up with Hematology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], as an outpatient and return for CABG AVR when hematology issues and platelet issues were controlled.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient's blood pressure was 124/63, heart rate in sinus tachycardia at 94, respiratory rate 25, saturating 97 percent.
She was short of breath with talking and at the time she was laying flat for a chest x-ray with significantly increased shortness of breath and heart rate.
She had 2 plus bilateral radial pulses, 1 plus bilateral DP and PT pulses.
LABORATORY DATA:  The preoperative laboratories revealed a white count of 5.7, hematocrit 30.3, platelet count 83,000.
Sodium 142, K 4.0, chloride 105, bicarbonate 28, BUN 32, creatinine 1.1 with a blood sugar of 166, PT 13.9, PTT 28.4, INR 1.2.
ALT 22, AST 29, LDH 354, alkaline phosphatase 94, total bilirubin 0.8.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and CHF.
Bone marrow biopsy showed a question of early myelodysplasia syndrome.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU and was followed daily by Cardiology and was evaluated by the Cardiac Surgery team as we awaited her hematology workup to be completed and her platelet count to rise.
The patient received a transfusion of platelets preoperatively on the 15th.
The patient was also seen by Cardiology daily and received a second unit of platelets on the 16th for her significant thrombocytopenia which was 113 on the 16th.
On the 17th, the platelet count rose to 139 with a white count of 5.2 and hematocrit of 29.7, creatinine was stable at 1.1 and INR of 1.2.
On the 17th, the patient was transferred out of the CCU to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] III, the step-down floor, as her preoperative workup continued.
The patient had good pulses which returned spontaneously with blood pressure in the 120s/60s which had dropped to 80/60.
She had sinus tachycardia on EKG and stable diffuse ST changes that were unchanged since her recent EKGs.
Postoperatively, the platelet count was 253,000 with an INR of 1.5.
The white count was 21 and a hematocrit of 30.
The K was 4.8, creatinine stable at 1.0.
On postoperative day number two, the patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 26, platelet counts dropped again to 79,000.
A HIT screen was sent.
The examination was unremarkable.
On postoperative day number three, aspirin was decreased to 81, Zantac was changed to Protonix, Amiodarone had been switched to oral, milrinone continued to be decreased, Captopril was added in for blood pressure control.
The patient was in sinus rhythm in the 60s with a blood pressure of 112/38 and the last chest tube was discontinued.
On postoperative day number four, the patient had been transferred out to the floor, was hemodynamically stable with a platelet count that dropped again to 59,000 and a creatinine was stable at 1.1.
On postoperative day number six, the blood sugar rose to 344.
The patient continued on beta blockade with a heart rate of 80, in sinus rhythm with a blood pressure of 106/46 as well as intravenous Lasix.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult for diabetes management was called.
The patient was seen by the [**Last Name (un) **] fellow and evaluation and recommendations were reviewed.
The creatinine was stable at 1.1.
The hematocrit was 31.3.
Diamox was added and electrolytes were rechecked with plans to hopefully discharge the patient in the morning.
On postoperative day number nine, the patient was stable overnight with a hematocrit of 30.4 and creatinine 1.2.
The examination was nonfocal neurologically.
