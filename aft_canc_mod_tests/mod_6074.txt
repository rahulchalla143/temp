VS: 122/64 75 18 95% on 4L GEN: cachectic and pale, fatigued HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry mucus membranes NECK: supple, JVP to halfway up neck, no lymphadenopathy LUNGS: CTA b/l, no wheezes, good inspiratory effort CV: RRR no m/r/g ABD: soft, non-tender, non-distended, +BS, no masses palpable EXT: no edema, arm vitiligo SKIN: warm and dry, pale NEURO: CN 2-12 grossly intact, strength 4/5 in right arm and extensors, [**5-16**] right flexors and left arm, [**5-16**] bilateral legs, 3+ reflexes equal bilaterally  Pertinent Results: American Hospital in [**Country **], Endoscopy Report: Large mass in the distal esophagus and gastric cardia.
MICROBIOLOGY DATA: [**2115-10-31**] Blood culture - no growth [**2115-10-31**] MRSA screen - negative [**2115-10-31**] Blood culture - no growth [**2115-10-31**] Urine culture - Enterococcus, sensitive to Vancomycin .
IMAGING: [**2115-10-28**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - No acute intracranial process.
[**2115-10-28**] CT BRAIN PERFUSION - Acute ischemia in a small territory of the superior division of the left MCA with increased mean transit time but no significant abnormality of blood volume; this represents a significant "ischemic penumbra."
[**2115-10-28**] MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS - Small acute infarct in the left precentral gyrus.
LVEF > 55% .
[**2115-10-30**] VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWA - Marked pooling within the valleculae with delayed hypopharyngeal transit.
[**2115-10-30**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - No acute intracranial process, with known embolic infarcts not identified.
[**2115-11-3**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
[**2115-11-6**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - In comparison with the study of [**11-3**], there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary edema.
Opacification at the left base is consistent with effusion and atelectasis.

[**2115-11-6**] 09:37PM BLOOD Lactate-1.5  Brief Hospital Course: 75M with a PMH significant for recently diagnosed metastataic esophageal carcinoma, HTN, hypothyroidism who presented with acute respiratory failure found to have left ischemic stroke with incidental pulmonary embolus undergoing heparinization complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring MICU transfer due to presumed aspiration PNA .
The patient's staging work-up was completed in [**Country **] - with CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis, EGD showing a distal obstructing mass extending to the gastric cardia region, and a colonoscopy which was reassuring.
A RUQ U/S performed at American Hospital in [**Country **] was also performed.
A video swallow evaluation showed marked pooling within the valleculae with delayed hypopharyngeal transit.
A CXR showed pleural effusion with left basal and retrocardiac atelectasis, with concern for aspiration.
His hemodynamics stabilized, his fever curve was monitored and his WBC improved - he returned to the medical floor for further management.
# ENTEROCOCCUS UTI - The patient was without symptoms of dysuria or urinary frequency or urgency but given concern for sepsis in the setting of an underlying malignancy, his urine studies revealed an Enterococcus UTI, which was treated with 7-days of IV Vancomycin.
# NUTRITIONAL CONCERNS - Speech and swallow performed a video swallow evaluation showing recurrent aspiration attributed to history of throat radiation from prior H&N malignancy.
# PULMONARY EMBOLUS - Acute pulmonary embolism in the right upper lobar pulmonary artery branches was noted on brain perfusion study performed for his ischemic stroke event.
Pulmonary embolus 7.
