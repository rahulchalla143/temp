At home her temperature was 101.9.
n ECHO during that admission revealed an effusion but was negative for tamponade.
A CTA showed large mediastinal mass and cardiothoracic surgery did not feel there was any need for intervention as it was not felt to be hematoma.
A repeat ECHO during admission showed decrease in size of her pericardial effusion.
Following her discharge, she returned to the ED on [**2172-7-20**] for low BPs found by VNA services.
She had blood cultures drawn and received vancomycin and cefepime, as well as ibuprofen 600mg x 1.
Labs were significant for anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and a transaminitis, which has been stable and extensively worked up on a prior admission but exact etiology still unknown.
At that time CXR showed a large anterior mediastinal mass.
Flow Cytometry showed a non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile with diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by a B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma seen in specimen.
Physical Exam: On admission/[**Hospital **] transfer to the ICU the patient's Physical Exam was as follows:   Physical Exam: T: 98.8 BP: 104/54 HR: 104 RR: 16 O2 100% RA Gen: ill appearing, pale, anxious affect HEENT: + conjunctival pallor.
Pertinent Results: Pertinent Past Studies:  ECHO [**2172-7-14**]: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-7-10**], the pericardial effusion is smaller.
CTA Chest [**2172-7-10**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
No PE but limited study due to large anterior mediastinal mass.
[**1-/2172**]: liver Bx from [**Hospital1 1474**] in [**2172-1-24**] showed nonspecific minimal lobular and portal mononuclear cell inflammation w/ rare hepatocyte necrosis.
Current Admission [**2172-7-23**]:  EKG [**7-23**]: aflutter 2:1 block @ 125, right bundle pattern in V1-V2 and III.
CXR [**7-23**]: Wide mediastinum with known anterior mediastinal mass.

BLood, urine and throat cultures were negative and CXR remained without evidence of infiltrates.
UAs and cultures do not reveal any UTI sources to date nor are there any clinical symptoms to suspect GI source (no diarrhea, abdominal pains, occasional nausea likely chemo related).
Anemia may be contributing to afib/tachycardia also, thus was transfused 2 u pRBCs on [**2172-7-27**] - volume replete with NS IVFs - monitored UOP, keeping >35cc/hr - rate control attained through beta blocker, increased dose during ICU stay and continued home level Digoxin.
Her hematocrit was trended without further need for transfusion.
Hepatitis serologies were negative.
RUQ u/s showed only cholelithiasis.
