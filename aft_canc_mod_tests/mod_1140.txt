He underwent a thorough urological evaluation at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital that was apparently negative for urogenital anomalies.
On [**2193-2-13**], he underwent a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis that demonstrated a heterogeneous area adjacent to the gallbladder in segment V measuring 2.2 by 4.0 cm.
On [**2193-3-1**], he underwent an MRI of the abdomen with contrast which demonstrated an ill-defined mass in segment V to the right of the gallbladder fossa with associated segmental biliary ductal dilatation.
He has no history of smoking, IV drug use, tatoos, marijuana use, hepatitis, blood transfusions, or piercings.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.8, pulse 76, blood pressure 148/88, respirations 16, weight 173 pounds.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On [**2193-1-22**], a hematocrit of 48.7, white blood cell count 10.6, platelets 269,000.
AST 27, ALT 20, alkaline phosphatase 89, total bilirubin 1.1.
Laboratory studies on [**2193-3-7**] showed a hematocrit of 49.9, white blood cell count 9.5, platelets 267,000.
Sodium 142, potassium 4.6, chloride 104, bicarbonate 30, glucose 104, BUN 20, creatinine 1.0, AST 23, ALT 25, alkaline phosphatase 90, total bilirubin 2.1, direct bilirubin 0.3, albumin 4.8, PT 12.2, PTT 24.2, and INR of 1.0.
Intraoperatively, the patient had an approximately 5 liter estimated blood loss for which he received 5 units of packed red blood cells for blood loss anemia as well as 2 units of FFP to correct intraoperative coagulopathy.
Close monitoring of his urine output was undertaken to ensure good hydration.
A JP was left in the abdominal cavity for drainage of any fluid.
The patient was treated with Enalapril to control his blood pressure while n.p.o.
The patient was extubated successfully on postoperative day number one after a chest x-ray ruled out any significant pulmonary edema and the patient made good response on the lowest settings available of the ventilator.
During the patient's stay, the patient's liver enzymes including AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase which initially bumped postsurgically progressively decreased over the course of the patient's stay.
His total bilirubin, however, increased for the first few days postoperatively.
The patient did receive a right upper quadrant ultrasound which ruled out any vascular abnormalities to the liver.
Finally, at the end of the patient's stay, the patient's total bilirubin did start to decreased and on [**2193-3-16**], the patient was discharged in good condition, tolerating a regular diet.
