EGD:   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Pt is a 43yo male with intermittent NSAID use for low back pain who presents with episode of syncope secondary to orthostatics and low Hct and found to have upper GI bleed.
Following surgery consult, pt was transferred to surgery service under Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and admitted to SICU for close monitoring of possible re-bleed.
EGD revealed 3cm submucosal mass on anterior wall of stomach, not actively bleeding.
Pt underwent repeat EGD on [**10-21**] to re-assess mass and tattoo area around mass for guidance during surgery.
Serial hematocrits had been reassuringly stable, and so pt was transferred to floor.
On [**10-25**], hematocrit was noted to be 22.1, and pt felt subjectively quite orthostatic, and he was transfused with 2 units of PRBC.
