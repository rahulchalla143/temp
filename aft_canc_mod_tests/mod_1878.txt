Carcinoid syndrome: Patient was admitted with severe carcinoid symptoms but without blood pressure lability.
When her diarrhea did not resolve (see below), she was temporarily placed on an Octreotide drip, but was able to be transitioned back to subcutaneous.
Though C. diff toxin was negative x3, there was a high index of suspicion due to fevers and leukocytosis, so C. diff PCR was sent which was positive.
Multiple urinalyses showed yeast UTI; speciation was requested and was found to be [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.
A head CT was done and was normal.
The patient was intubated to protect her airway in order to perform an MRI and LP.
MRI head was negative for any signs of encephalitis as well as any brain mets.
EEG was performed and overall was consistent with toxic-metabolic encephalopathy but there was some localized temporal activity so per Neurology she was kept on Keppra.
ECG did show TWI in V3 only.
CK was elevated but CKmb and trop remained flat.
Cardiology was consulted and they did not think that there was any evidence of ischemia based on the EKGs and cardiac enzymes an further evaluation was not recommended.
CXR and physical exam reveal no evidence of pericardial effusion.
This resolved with IV fluid and at the time of discharge her creatinine was 0.6.
This was monitored and her LFTs trended downwards and were normal (<20) at the time of discharge.
Monitored with finger sticks and treated with ISS.
