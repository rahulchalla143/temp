Patient now transferred from OSH for further evaluation of leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and hypotension requiring neosynephrine/IVF.
The day of her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] she had [**4-18**] blood culture bottles positive for MRSA at the OSH and was started on Linezolid at that institution.
Blood cultures drawn here were also [**4-18**] positive on the day of admit.
She was started empirically on Flagyl for a brief course until 3 C diff toxin tests were negative.
Her BP was maintained with IVF and Levophed initially, though pressors were quickly weaned off in the first night.
They also recommended getting a head CT to r/o emboli prior to her likely needed surgery for abscess drainage.
CT [**Doctor First Name **] was initially recommended cath in prep for surgery given recent STEMI, but then after further review was not convinced that the pt had a true abscess requiring surgery.
CAD, s/p STEMI: In prep for her operation, the patient underwent a cardiac cath that revealed 90% stenosis of her LAD.
She refused to be intubated, so a BIPAP was placed on to improve her oxygenation, which helped.
Each time she did, it was in the setting of either too much fluid or a elevated heart rate and blood pressure.
Microembolic strokes: in prep for surgery, the pt underwent a head CT to r/o CVAs.
Given the risk of bleed from these lesions will anticoagulated from heparin on CP bypass, CT [**Doctor First Name **] was reluctant to take her to the OR but eventually agreed.
Supratherapeutic INR: pt had been on coumadin as an outpatient for a h/o PEs, but had not had a recent INR check.
Her INR slowly came down as we held her coumadin in house.
Will recommend evaluation as outpatient.
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: 1.5 Tablets PO TID (3 times a day): Hold for systolic blood pressure less than 100, heart rate less than 60.
Captopril 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): Hold for systolic blood pressure less than 100.
Furosemide 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): Hold for systolic blood pressure less than 100.

She needs a f/u echocardiogram in appx 4 weeks to re-evaluate her valves.
- Please check CK once a week.
- If renal function declines, please check creatinine clearance for re-adjustment for daptomycin dosing.
- In addition, hold Lasix for systolic blood pressure <100.
- Hold metoprolol for systolic blood pressure <100, or heart rate <60.
Please draw cultures should patient become febrile and consider broadening antibiotic coverage.
