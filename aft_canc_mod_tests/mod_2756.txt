Recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (3) 56873**] with fevers (after OSH admission starting [**2124-9-1**]); found to have MDS (RAEB-2) by bone marrow biopsy (at OSH, and then again at [**Hospital1 18**]).
Of note her bone marrow biopsy also showed granulomatous inflammation; Quantiferon was indeterminate, urine histo antigen was weakly positive.
Exam of neck concerning for abscess.
WBCs 1.7 with 37N and 21B.
CT neck done - small anterior abscess (9mm), likely at prior CVL site.
Oxygen saturation was 100% on NRB and she was not tachypneic.
Her JVP at 90 degrees was noted to be at the angle of the mandible.
Granulomatous changes also present in BMBx with micro stains, culture and PCR negative.

PATH [**10-15**] SKIN BIOPSY Skin, left digit, biopsy (A):     Interstitial granulomatous inflammation, see note and comment.
There is a case report describing elastophagocytosis in association with Sweet's syndrome, therefore, due to the neutrophilic component and mild papillary dermal edema, Sweet's syndrome (or due to the acral site - neutrophilic dermatosis of the hands variant of Sweet's) is possible.
Special stains were negative, however, if the process persists, a re-biopsy for culture may be helpful as culture is a more sensitive method to detect organisms than histologic special stains.
[**11-1**] SINUS BIOPSY DIAGNOSIS:  1.Left inferior turbinate, nose, intranasal biopsy (A):     1.
Respiratory-type mucosa, bone, and vascular tissue with mild chronic inflammation.
[**10-12**] CT NECK IMPRESSION: 1.
Overall, the thrombus has increased from the previous study of [**2124-9-15**].
Fluid G/S was positive for leukocytes and Gram positive cocci in pairs but culture was ultimately negative.
#UTI Infectious work-up revealed Vancomycin resistant/Daptomycin senstive UTI.
Sarcoidosis was suggested as a plausible diagnosis given granulomatous disease, EN, and mediastinal adenopathy; ultimately, rheumatology consult determined that the patient's cluster of symptoms and pathology findings of granulomas in multiple anatomic sites could be explained by a unifying diagnosis of Idiopathic Granulomatous Disease.
Repeat biopsy revealed neutrophilic dermatosis suggestive of Sweet?????
PNA identified on CXR was treated with antibiotics with good resolution of symptoms and successful extubation.
#ICU stay #2/EPISTAXIS Patient was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hemodynamic monitoring after she was noted to have spontaneous epistaxis that began [**10-27**] AM.
She was noted be tachycardic to 110s and hypertensive to SBP 160s.
Labs notable for WBC 2.1, Plt 193, INR 1.1 and K 5.7.
CT of the sinuses was done to rule out fungal infection which showed no obvious source.
She underwent maxillary sinus biopsy by ENT when her nasal packing was removed; this showed only non-specific inflammation of normal mucosa.
#LEFT ARM PICC-ASSOCIATED DVT PICC placed [**10-31**]; patient developed pain and swelling in her left arm overnight that night - doppler ultrasound showed DVT, which was seen to have been present (but smaller) on imaging earlier during this admission.
Stool studies were negative for C. Diff, bacterial, parasitic or viral infection.
*Hx HISTOPLASMOSIS INTERMEDIATE-POSITIVE URINE ANTIGEN Pt carried a diagnosis of histoplasmosis from previous admission for which she was being treated with voriconazole.
Her beta glucan and galactomanan levels were WNL and voriconazole level was therapeutic.
CT of the chest revealed overall improvement in previously seen opacities, although it was notable for some slightly increased adenopathy.
Blood cultures continued to be negative.
Biopsy was obtained out of concern for disseminated fungal infection, but culture revealed no growth of bacterial or fungal organisms.
MRCP [**10-24**] showed no biliary dilatation, no obstruction, and was most c/w chronic liver disease plus porta hepatis lymphadenopathy.
[**Month (only) 116**] need follow-up liver biopsy which was deferred to outpatient follow-up given lack of RUQ symptoms.
There was concern that her fevers might be due to transformation of underlying MDS, but BM biopsy showed no leukemia.
She required multiple blood transfusions to maintain Hct >21.
Needs follow-up labs to trend LFTs, possible liver biopsy 3.
Exam for recurrent/worsening skin lesions after stopping topical steroids at time of discharge (2 week course completed).
Calcium 500 500 mg calcium (1,250 mg) Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Calcium 500 500 mg calcium (1,250 mg) Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
All other studies including labs and imaging were negative.
You also had a biopsy of your palate (the roof of your mouth) which did not show infection.
You may also need a liver biopsy in the future.
You should have your liver labs checked soon by your primary physician or rheumatologist, and they can help you set up an appointment with a liver specialist if needed.
