From the rehab notes, new sputum culture growing pan-resistant Klebsiella that is sensitive to meropenem and ertrapenem.
Urine cx growing same species ([**1-19**]).

Pertinent Results: Studies: CT head: Left parietal and frontal subdural hematomas are again identified.
The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are stable with no evidence of hydrocephalus.
EEG done on [**1-21**] with abnormal focal sezire from L parasagittal area.
Pt also noted to have transaminitis, ultrasound showing hypoechoic lesions, and following abdominal CT showed multiple liver lesions.
The lesion was biopsied and the pathology was consistent with adenocarcinoma.
On [**3-20**], pt became febrile, BP 70-80/40's, HR in 120, got 4L IVF and 2 units of PRBC.
The following day, he got abd CT which showed small pericapsular hematoma but not big enough to account for the hypotension.
He was clinically stable until [**4-5**] when he had another episode of fever and hypotension, so Vanc/meropenem were re-started and IVF given to maintain his BP.
At that time he spiked fever, blood, urine sent for culture and chest x-ray obtained.
Chest x-ray with no change/evidence of infiltrate.
Urine came back with Gram negative rods.
BP responded to NS boluses and 2 Units of PRBC's.
BP since stabilized.
Per ENT, new trach will not necessarily limit further aspiration because always will have some cuff leak.
On [**3-20**] became hypotensive to 40/P and was febrile with temp of 103, so cx'd again x 2 with mycolytics and given 4 L NS and total of 2 u. PRBC overnight.
BP and Hct responded well and pt has been stable since.
Abdominal CT performed for ?
perf (s/p liver bx and possible primary colon ca as risk factors) some mild peri-hepatic hematoma with small amount of blood tracking down to pelvis but insufficient to explain the degree of hypotension.
Upright CXR showed no free air below diaphragm.
Troponin was down from baseline.
Wife of pt refuses MRI b/c believes would put the patient through excessive discomfort.
CT +/- showed multiple enhancing hypodense masses c/w metastatic disease or abscesses.
Pt received diagnostic liver biopsy on [**3-18**] consistent with adenocarcinoma.
EEG showing abnormal epileptiform waves, likely from the SDH and R MCA stroke.
CT Head unchanged x2 (repeat done on [**1-28**] given question of pt indicating HA.)
Repeat EEG showed no evidence of seizure while on dilantin.
Dilantin level was checked multiple times and corrections were made to keep corrected dilantin level <20.
Seizure/dilantin: Adjusted dose [**2126-2-28**] (after corrected dilantin level of 6.1) to dilantin 150mg [**Hospital1 **] and qhs.
Repeat dilantin, albumin labs on [**2126-3-2**] showed corrected dilantin ~7 and so dosing changed on [**2126-3-3**] to 200 [**Hospital1 **] and 150 qhs.
Levels checked ~[**3-21**] and dilantin level was high once corrected for albumin but this level was in the context of tube feedings being held, so will re-check.
Transfuse for HCT <25, Plts <50.
10.Trach care: aggressive suctioning and chest PT, maintain sats >93%.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One (1) 100mg PO BID (2 times a day).
