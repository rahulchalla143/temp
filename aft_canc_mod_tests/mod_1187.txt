Admission Date:  [**2162-5-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2162-6-8**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 203**] Medicine  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post nephrectomy and Intensive Care Unit stay, transfer for cardiac catheterization  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 89-year-old female who is status post a nephrectomy on [**2162-5-24**] for renal cell carcinoma.
She was originally admitted to the urology service and subsequently the Intensive Care Unit and then transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] for cardiac catheterization.
She did complain of mild shortness of breath, but denied cough, chest pain, chest pressure, had a good appetite, was slightly thirsty, was denying any urinary symptoms.
TRANSFER VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature was 98.9??????.
Blood pressure was 140/70.
Pulse was 79.
Respiratory rate was 18.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
TRANSFER LABORATORY VALUES:  White blood cell count 12.5, hematocrit 31.7, platelets 238.
PT 13.6, PTT 28.2, INR 1.3.
Sodium 142, potassium 3.8, chloride 104, bicarbonate 30, BUN 59, creatinine 1.6, blood glucose was 97.
Chest x-ray from [**5-30**] showed increasing left sided pleural effusion and a left retrocardiac opacity.
CT of the abdomen showed moderate bilateral pleural effusions, moderate ascites and a hematoma 12 x 7 cm abutting the kidney in the retroperitoneal area.
Echocardiogram from [**2162-5-26**] showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, ejection fraction greater than 50%, at least mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
Echocardiogram from the outside hospital was read as some evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had a cardiac catheterization which showed hemodynamics, aortic filling pressures of 164/65.
Subsequently, the patient started to have an increased oxygen requirement up to approximately 4 liters to keep O2 saturations between 92% and 94%.
Chest x-ray was performed which showed pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions.
Chest x-ray prior to discharge showed interval improvement in the effusions with diuresis.
Subsequently, once the patient's creatinine stabilized an ACE inhibitor was started and hydralazine was in the process of being titrated down.
PULMONARY:  Given the fact that the patient had these immune pleural effusions of unclear etiology, initially the thought was to try and tap the pleural effusions.
The family requested that the interventional pulmonology service perform the tap, however, they were unavailable at the time and subsequently, by the time they were available, repeat chest x-ray showed a decrease in the size of the effusion and the family requested that if it was not completely necessary that no further invasive diagnostic testing be done at the family's request.
Given the fact the pleural effusions had improved in size with diuresis, it was felt most likely they were related to congestive heart failure in the setting of diastolic dysfunction and mitral regurgitation and a fluid load prior to cardiac catheterization.
The patient's hematocrit was checked [**Hospital1 **] after the cardiac catheterization since she was heparinized for the cardiac catheterization and the patient's hematocrit remained stable.
Initially, the patient's creatinine was 0.8.
After nephrectomy, the patient's creatinine bumped to 1.3 and eventually up to 1.8, however prior to discharge, the patient's creatinine was 1.3 and stable.
