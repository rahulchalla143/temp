The LMCA, LAD, LCx and RCA had mild luminal irregularities only and no flow limiting stenoses.
After a ventricular premature beat, the tracings demonstrated the classic Brockenbrough-Braunwald sign (the peak systolic gradient increases after a VPC and the pulse pressure decreases - due to increased dynamic obstruction caused by the post extra-systolic potentiation).
Cardiac output was preserved.
Left ventriculography demonstrated mid-cavity obliteration during systole.
Overall ejection fraction was >80%.
MICROBIOLOGY  [**2199-1-25**] Blood Culture: negative [**2199-1-25**] Urine Culture: negative [**2199-1-28**] Catheter Tip Culture: negative  RADIOLOGY:  [**2199-1-28**] CXR: small left pleural effusion  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 62 year old female with a one-year history of lower GI bleeding secondary to arteriovenous malformations in the cecum refractory to several cauterization treatments who presents for operative management.
She was admitted on [**2199-1-18**] directly from her first surgical office visit when she was found to be quite anemic, with a hematocrit of 23.4.
Of note, her pre-operative work-up included cardiac catheterization, as she was known to carry a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
Catheterization on [**2199-1-22**] revealed no coronary artery disease, but significant outflow obstruction through her aortic tract (please see full report details, below).
She was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and was extubated without complication on post-operative day 1.
Her heart rate and blood pressure were well-controlled in the intensive care unit with lopressor and an esmolol drip, with goal settings for pulse in the 60s as recommended by cardiology and CT-surgery.
She was transfused 2 units on post-operative day 2 for goal hematocrit above 30.0.
