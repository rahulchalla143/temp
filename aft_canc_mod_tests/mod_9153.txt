GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient's condition stabilized and his bilirubin decreased following sphincterotomy of initial endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
The patient returned for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2186-11-28**], which revealed successful chemoablation of the biliary duct and irregular stricture of malignant appearance of 20 millimeters in length was noted in the lower post-obstructive dilatations compatible with malignance of biliary obstruction.
Based on all of the data accumulated including CA [**02**]-9 of 27,000, it was felt by the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography team that he most likely has metastatic pancreatic carcinoma and would not be amenable to further treatment.
The patient underwent renal biopsy of the right kidney on [**2186-11-30**], and the results of this are pending at this time.
His pathology initially showed diabetic nephropathy without active inflammation, but the IF and EM are pending at the time of discharge.
Prior to the patient's discharge, his creatinine stabilized at approximately 5.0 with stable electrolytes on multiple medications prior to discharge medications.
ANEMIA:  The patient's iron studies revealed iron deficiency anemia.
His hematocrit remained stable and he was ready for discharge.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient's mental status continued to improve mildly as the patient's bilirubin came down.
PULMONARY:  The patient experienced respiratory distress and desaturation to 70% following his endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
Insulin, NPH to be titrated for blood sugars, currently 12 units q. a.m. and 8 units q. h.s.
