His labs were significant for a WBC 17.4, Hct 34.0, Plt 108, BUN 86, Cr 4.24 (was 3.25 five days prior), uric acid 11.6, LDH 230.
Over the next two days he had improvement of BUN to 76, creatinine to 2.33 (eventual nadir 2.17) and worsening of thrombocytopenia (to 27).
He developed hallucinations and had a head CT that was negative.
CXR without evidence of acute infection.
Blood cultures revealed 4/4 bottles with staphylcoccus aureus (sensitivities pending) and he was started on vancomycin.
He became progressively altered and was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management.
In the ICU, head CT was done and was negative.
ABG was 7.57/32.9/89.
The day of transfer labs were WBC 5.4, Hct 22.3, Plt 12, BUN 102, Cr 2.22, albumin 1.3.
Vitals at time of transfer were T 97.8, BP 108/59 (per report baseline 140s), HR 110, RR 28, SaO2 92% 4L NC.
He was intubated essentially on arrival for CXR showing ARDS and poor O2 saturation on 6L NC and facemask.
30 mins s/p intubation patient then dropped his BP to 50's, was given IVF bolus, CVL was placed in R femoral artery emergently and patient was given peripheral dopa, then levophed through the central line, and 0.1mg of epinephrine.
His BP went up to 70's, then steadily increased to 160's, and pressors were weaned down.
His art stick showed acidemia and a lactate that increased from 2.6 to 8.2. .

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2130-2-21**] at 11:23:41 AM      FINAL  Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with inferior and septal akinesis/severe hypokinesis with mild to moderate hypokinesis elsewhere.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
MRI SPINE [**2130-3-5**] CERVICAL SPINE: 1.
ECHO [**2130-3-6**] Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-2-27**], the LVEF is lower and the LV cavity has increased in size.
MRI HEAD [**2130-3-3**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 62 year old male with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, plasma cell dysplasia with Kappa light chains and cryoglobulinemia treated in [**2127**], now s/p relapse and retreatment [**2130-2-6**] with resultant tumor lysis syndrome, acute on chronic kidney failure, and hospitalization at [**Hospital 22913**] from [**2130-2-10**] to [**2130-2-19**] complicated by development of MSSA septicemia, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
He had positive cultures for MSSA in blood from OSH, as well as urine, knee aspirate, and sputum cultures at [**Hospital1 18**].
His blood pressure and urine output improved and his need for pressors resolved.
Echo on [**2130-2-21**] showed 1.0 x 1.4 cm vegetation on his mitral valve.
Repeat echo showed that MV vegitation had lessened in size to 1.3 cm.
# Paraspinal fluid collections: MRI of the spine showed multiple fluid collections likely representing abcesses in the Cervical and thoracic spine.
Ultrasound was consistent with fluid collection, likely representing an abcess.
Concern for septic emboli was raised and he was sent for MRI brain which showed acute infarcts in right anterior centrum semiovale and right posterior occipital lobe but no evidence of abcess.
Chest CT on [**2130-2-20**] showed upper lobe consolidation and his sputum grew MSSA, for which he was continued on Nafcillin.
He was started on an IV PPI and transfused as needed to maintain a Hct >25 and plts > 50.
His TLS has since improved, with uric acid at OSH from high of 11 down to 2.3, however elevated >8 at [**Hospital1 18**].
His urine output was initially low, but after volume resuscitation he began to autodiurese with improvement in his UOP to greater than 100cc/hr.
He likely developed some degree of ATN given his hypotension, which gradually resolved.
His SPEP showed less than 1% total protein IgG Kappa chains.
No cryoglobulin was detected when checked on [**2130-2-20**] and his serum viscosity was just below the normal range.
