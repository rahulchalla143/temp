CT Head ([**2176-7-5**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
Non-contrast head CT is limited in evaluation of intracranial metastasis.
Gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI is more sensitive.
Urine cx grew e.coli resistant to cipro.
Given the poor appearance of his CXR and his tenuous respiratory status, the patient was continue of vancomycin/zosyn for an 8 day course to cover for HCAP.
He should complete a 14 day course of antibiotics to cover for urosepsis which is due to end on [**2176-7-19**].
