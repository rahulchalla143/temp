The patient underwent 2 CT scans of his torso to help evaluate etiology of fever which revealed LLL consolidation, likely PNA.

Flow cytometry ([**8-10**]): FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING The following tests (antibodies) were performed: HLA-DR, FMC-7, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 3, 5, 10, 11c, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 103.
They co-express pan B cell markers CD19, 20, 22, along with CD25, CD11c, CD103.

================================================== Imaging: Extensive Imaging from [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] summarized elsewhere CT torso on [**8-2**] ([**Location (un) 620**]) revealed bilateral lower lobe lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia, interval improvement on the left but worsening on the right.
CT chest ([**8-10**]):  FINDINGS: Consolidations in the medial and posterior basal segments of the right lower lobe are increased.
A 3-mm nodule in the anterior right upper lobe (4:102) is stable over greater than two years from the examination of [**2114-10-6**].
These were present on the exam of [**2113**], prior to the infection, however have now slightly increased in size.
Pericardial fluid is within physiologic limits.
A right-sided PICC is in place with tip in the SVC.
This study is not tailored for evaluation beneath the diaphragm; limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate slightly heterogeneous liver as compared to prior examinations which could be pathologic, though given timing of contrast, this is most likely perfusional.
On the left, the appearance on this examination could be entirely explained by atelectasis.
CT Chest ([**8-16**]): CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The imaged thyroid gland is normal.
There are bibasilar consolidations, left greater than right, which has slightly progressed compared to the prior CT and most likely represent atelectasis.
Atelectasis on the left extends adjacent to the aortic knob.
CT Chest ([**8-25**]): FINDINGS: The airways are patent to the segmental level.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Video Speech and Swallow [**2117-8-31**]: COMPARISONS: None available.
A barium pill was administered without hold up at any point of the pharynx of esophagus.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 620**] records, the patient was initially treated for a UTI but following multiple cultures and treatment modalities his UA cleared.
CT scan revealed multifocal infiltrates, treated with Vanc/Zosyn for possible pneumonia.
Urine culture revealed VRE, treated with linezolid.
Bronchoscopy with BAL was performed, revealed neutrophilic predominance in both lobes but no clear signs of infection.
Chest CT revealed consolidation similar to those seen in [**2114**] when he was diagnosed with pyoderma gangrenosum.
After consultation with Pulmonary and Rheumatology experts, his prednisone was increased to better treat presumed pyoderma flare.
His fevers were attributed to sepsis possibly from VRE UTI; urine cx [**8-23**] positive for VRE.
Based on bone marrow biopsy results, was also less concern that fevers were secondary to his leukemia.
CMV and fungal studies were negative, but a C.diff PCR was positive despite multiple negative toxin tests and the patient treated with PO vancomycin.
Patient continued to have fevers and a repeat urine culture grew both yeast and VRE.
A C diff PCR was sent and returned positive.
ABG showed 7.49/21/79 with a lactate of 9.6, and he was transferred to the MICU.
His oxygen was quickly weaned from NRB to NC to room air.
Repeat CXR showed minimal improvement, and has patient had not been improving on vanc/zosyn for possible HCAP, antibiotics changed to linezolid/meropenem.
# A fib with RVR:  The morning following admission, the patient became tachycardic to the 170s with BP 80s/40s.
Metoprolol IV was given with some effect, as his HR slowed to 120-140 and BP rose to 90s/50s.
In the MICU, he was loaded with amiodarone and subsequently converted to sinus rhythm, which was maintained with PO amiodarone 300 mg [**Hospital1 **].
This was initially decreased as his skin manifestations removed, but as his pulmonary symptoms increased there was concern for repeat disease in the pleura and lung.
The pathology slides from [**2114**] were obtained and reviewed by our pathology department.
Cyclosporine was at 75 mg [**Hospital1 **] at the time of discharge to be decreased to 75 mg daily on [**9-4**] then stopped on [**9-11**].
A bone marrow biopsy was performed to determine if the HCL had increased to the point that it would justify treatment to reduce fever and pyoderma.
Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated 10% of marrow composed of hairy T cells, and per Heme/Onc this degree of involvement does not warrant treament, especially due to risks of neutropenia with treatment.
Iron studies revelead an anemia of chronic inflammation as well as an iron deficiency with an iron saturation of 14%.
Tablet, Chewable(s) 2. levothyroxine 25 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

You had a bone marrow biopsy showing that your hairy cell leukemia was stable.
