CT CHEST, LIMITED There is a comparison exam from [**2157-2-23**].
PREPROCEDURE CHEST FINDINGS: Non-contrast images of the thorax demonstrate a large right pleural effusion and right middle lobe atelectasis as seen previously.
Post-procedure images demonstrated no pneumothorax.
This fluid was sent for the requested Gram stain and culture.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report [**2157-2-23**] 3:55 PM CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST Reason: evaluate for PE and/or RML consolidation/empyema Contrast: [**Hospital 13288**] [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 61 year old woman with worsening R effusion REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate for PE and/or RML consolidation/empyema CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CT OF THE CHEST There is a comparison non-contrast CT from [**2157-1-20**].
Based on the results of the recent (postoperative) bronchoscopy, this is presumably due to postobstructive collapse due to secretions.
PORTABLE AP CHEST: There is no change from prior radiograph obtained yesterday.
The right IJ catheter and the right-sided chest tubes are in good position.
