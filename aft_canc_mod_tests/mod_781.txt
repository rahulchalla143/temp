Blood cultures were drawn and these were negative.
Chest x-ray showed extensive involvement of tumor and bilateral pleural effusions, but no clear infiltrate to suggest pneumonia.
A cortisol level was 26.6.
DDx included worsening of metastatic disease vs re-accumulation of pleural effusions which appeared possible by CXR vs PNA vs PE given pt not currently on anticoagulation.
CTA was not pursued because patient would not have been a candidate for anticoagulation due to sanguinous pleural effusions.
His air hunger was treated with morphine and ativan which his blood pressure tolerated, as well as continued drainage of his pleural effusion via his pleurex catheter.
