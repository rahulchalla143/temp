LIMITED ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND  DATE: [**2162-2-26**].
COMPARISON: Liver ultrasound [**2162-2-18**], CT abdomen and pelvis [**2162-2-20**], chemoembolization [**2162-2-15**].
CLINICAL INDICATION: 60-year-old man with hepatitis C status post TACE procedure, elevated and rising bilirubin of unclear etiology.
TECHNIQUE: Multiple son[**Name (NI) 493**] grayscale images of the abdomen were obtained with select images supplemented with color Doppler and spectral waveform analysis.
This examination was not tailored to evaluate for liver lesions.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

COMPARISON: CT dated [**2162-2-16**] and MR dated [**2161-11-24**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired from the lung bases through the pubic symphysis following administration of intravenous contrast with multiplanar reformations.
Two subcentimeter hypodense lesions are seen within liver, segments [**Doctor First Name 690**] (2, 14) and IVb (2, 21), too small to fully characterize.
Additional lesions demonstrated on preceding MRI are not evident on current single phase exam.
Additional known liver lesions are better depicted on preceding MRI dated [**2161-11-24**].
He became hypertensive at the the end of the procedure, thought to be due to pain with BP up to SBP 200, controlled with dilaudid, toradol for pain and hydralazine.
His bilirubin and LFTs trended up.
non-contrast CT of liver done showed ethidiol in most of R hepatic lobe and additional mass, no extravasation.
CXR x 2 concernign for RLL opacification.
Head CT w & w/o was neg [**2-18**].
Amonia level was 177.
EEG did not show signs of epileptic activity.
Head CT stable without evidence of bleed.
MRI head was performed which showed only nonspecific signal abnormalities likely from small vessel ischemic disease, nothing acute.
Amonium level went down to 70.
Vanc/zosyn initiated, pt transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and was intubated.
# Coagulopathy: Pt with INR 3.3, thrombocytopenia, fibrinogen 64, concern for DIC.
Pt was given slow rate D5W with careful monitoring of electrolytes.
Blood/urine cultures unrevealing.
# Communication: wife [**Name (NI) 2048**]: cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91740**], H [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91741**] .
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:  # Patient will need LFT monitoring including Tbili for the next 5 days to evaluate stability.
# Patient will need Chem7 monitoring for the next 5 days to evaluate for hypokalemia or worsening renal function.
