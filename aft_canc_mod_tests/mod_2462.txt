ECHO [**2188-9-18**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-8-22**], there is no pericardial effusion on the current study (the prior study mentioned an effusion but this appearance may have been due to a fat pad).
CT HEAD: FINDINGS: Examination is stable in comparison to [**2188-9-25**].
CAROTID ARTERY U/S: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid arteries.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: Presented with HR 130s.
Patient's third admission for A Fib with RVR (120-130s), when converts enters sinus brady (40s-50s).
Discussed with Neurosurgery, can monitor meningioma with CT scan instead of MRI.
Troponin negative and no ischemia changes on EKG.
CXR no sign of infection.
Brief MICU course: Pt transfered to MICU for low blood pressure unresponsive to fluid bolus after increasing metoprolol to 75mg three times a day.
His blood pressure increased to 100-120/50-60 and his HR decreased to 60s.
His rate remained in the 120s-140s despite increaing his metoprolol to 100 three times a day.
The decision was made to ablate his atrial ventricular junction and have him be pacer dependant.
Coumadin was re-started for A Fib and DVT s/p pacer placement on [**2188-9-23**], bridge on Heparin drip.
Because of re-bleed on heat CT anticoagulation was stopped.
Ua demonstrated signs of infection (+ nitrates + leukocytes, 11 WBC, moderate bacteria).
Urine culture positive E. Coli.
A head CT revealed a new focus of hemorrhage.
After the CT he began moving all four limbs spontaneously.
A repeat head CT two days later showed no increase of the bleed.
If patient clinically improves and develops a will to eat, it would be reasonable to obtain a speech and swallow evaluation and try oral feeds.
