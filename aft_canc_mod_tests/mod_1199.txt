Given severe progressive weakness in both lower extremities and lumbar back pain, he had a lumbar MRI [**2104-5-15**] (ordered by his neurologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 23506**]), which showed a tight stenosis at L4/5 and metastatic lesions at multiple levels, predominalty L5 and S1 with epidural metastases.
MRI of cervical and thoracic spine revealed multi-level sclerotic lesions suggesting metastic disease.
A bone scane demonstrated muld lumbosacral uptake, along with uptake on left lower rib cage, left femur, and right humerus.
He was admitted and on [**5-27**] an MRI of the L spine was obtained showing metastasis.
Steroids were increased to 4 mg dexamethasone Q6 and XRT was continued.
He was transferred to ICU for further evaluation and management of his hypotension.

[**2104-5-26**] Head CT w/o contrast: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
NEBH [**5-21**] CT Abd GU protocol: There are small bilateral low-density adrenal masses, compatible with nonfunctioning adenomas.
There is a very large amount of streak artifact from the patient's bilateral THRs, which obscures the UVJs bilaterally.
[**4-15**] blood cultures on [**5-26**] + for MSSA; [**2-16**] bottle VRE urine from [**5-26**] + for staph aureus  [**2-14**] blood cultures on [**5-27**] +MSSA .
EKG with sinus tach in 110's.
# Endocarditis: Given his initial positive blood cultures (MSSA and VRE), he had TTE and TEE done, TEE was positive for endocarditis w/ perforated leaflet with severe MR.  Because of his widely metastatic cancer and septic shock, he was not an appropriate candidate for surgical interevention.
# Generalized weakness: He has known spinal canal/foraminal stenosis (cervical and lumbar) in addition to cervical, thoracic, and lumbar metastases, most prominent at L5/S1 with epidural extension.
Could also be mets even though head CT normal.
PSA 46.3 and CEA 2.
Spine metastases presumed to be secondary to prostate CA given elevated PSA, although pt also has large thyroid lesion and a history of colon cancer.
