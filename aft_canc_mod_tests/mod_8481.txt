The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Focused imaging of the posterior fossa would help for further assessment if clinically indicated.
MRA OF THE NECK: Neck MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.
Repeat CT head: IMPRESSION: Left middle cerebral artery territorial infarct.
High-density material identified along the left sylvian fissure could be due to enhancement from the recent contrast administration or could be due to petechial hemorrhages.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
However, bubble study not performed.
If clinically indicated, a focused study with contrast administration may allow for evaluation for intracardiac shunt.
He had a CTA performed which was consistent with a left M2 occlusion though there was an area of MCA which was hypodense.
PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the arteriogram suite and placed on the angiogram table in the usual supine position.
We therefore decided to stop the procedure as more than 6 hours had elapsed since the onset of symptoms and the patient had a demonstrable infarct on his preprocedure CT scan.
A neurologic examination could not be performed immediately due to deep sedation and muscle relaxants.
FINDINGS: Left common carotid artery arteriogram shows no significant stenosis of the left common carotid artery bifurcation.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Known firstname **] Approved: WED [**2148-11-20**] 3:00 PM  [**11-13**] Language evaluation: EVALUATION: A brief Aphasia screening evaluation was performed today at the bedside on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5.
SUMMARY: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 100404**] presents with nonfluent global aphasia with poor auditory comprehension and expressive language filled with neologisms and paraphasic errors which are mostly phonemic in nature.
was not managing his oral secretions and thus did not appear ready to pass a repeat Bedside swallow evaluation at this time, it was deferred.
He had a TTE which did not show a thrombus.
He was extubated without complications, and transferred to the stepdown unit for further workup.
His blood sugars in the hospital were within normal limits for the most part, and no new diabetes medication regimen was initiated apart from a standard insulin sliding scale (requiring no doses of insulin on this).
Total cholesterol was 130, HDL was 42, trig 125 and LDL was 63; his dose of Lipitor was thus not changed.
2D Echo was unrevealing as source of clot; though he had admitted to recent dental infection, cardiology felt that endocarditis was very unlikely and did not feel TEE was indicated.
1) Kidney biopsy results were followed up; pathology revealed papillary renal cell carcinoma.
No further workup of this mass was recommended, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25443**] felt that G-Tube placement should be safe.
This was replaced with a PEG tube, which was advanced into the duodenum, due to technical difficulties of placement.
5) At his family's request, an EEG was performed; this revealed left temporal slowing consistent with his known stroke, and no epileptiform activity was noted.
Warfarin should be continued daily with a PT and INR checked each day.
Coumadin dosing should be adjusted such that INR is maintained between [**2-24**].
