She had a right femoral angiogram which showed an occluded SFA and occluded dorsalis pedis.
By [**7-24**], which would be postoperative day number 11 from her operation, the renal attending that was consulting on the case, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**], felt that the patient was probably pre-renal secondary to worsening cor pulmonale, and recommended to attempt to diurese the patient.
Her albumin at this time was 2.5.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] did suggest to check troponin I for a question of a cardiac event, as covered in the perioperative period to precipitate this, to check for a fractional excretion of urea to see if this was consistent with a prerenal state, continue the diuretics, maintain blood pressure greater than 120 for renal perfusion, and to start optimizing her nutrition.
A Neurology consultation was obtained at this time also for her altered mental status.
Her neurologic examination was significant for inattention and somewhat lethargic, which might reflex a metabolic encephalopathy.
Their recommendations were to check a head CT scan to evaluate a large stroke or bleed.
Also, to check an MRI and diffusion wave images in an MRA.
Would defer if her staples are an issue.
Consider to stop her subcutaneously heparin since her INR was therapeutic.
Neurologically, a head CT scan was achieved that showed no evidence of large intracranial bleed.
The rest of her electrolytes were stable.
Neurology consult stated that an EEG that was obtained during her work-up was a flat line result from [**2130-7-26**].
They wanted to repeat the EEG to rule out any artifacts or rule out seizure for any reason to explain her persistent encephalopathy.
Bilateral carotid pulses were absent.
