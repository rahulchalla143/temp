However, given his continued symptoms, he was referred back to his local ED for evaluation of possible increased intracranial pressure, bowel obstruction, or infection, as the source of his symptoms.
Evaluation there revealed elevated LFTs with transaminases in the 300s, rising LDH to the 500s, new and enlarging frontal brain mets on head CT, and new lung mets on chest/abdominal CT.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS: Temp 96.4F, BP 115/88, HR 85, R 17, SaO2 95% RA.
Labs were notable for WBC 3.3 (78.5% PMNs), Hgb 8.5 / Hct 26.5, Plt 63; PTT 40.2, INR 1.8; Na 132, HCO3 21; ALT 363, AST 269, Alk Phos 199, TBili 0.9, and Lipase 57.
His OSH Head CT was reviewed by Radiology, with preliminary read showing "Persistent but decreased right parietal edema and stable-appearing left frontal edema with interval resolution of right parietal post-operative changes.
MR is more sensitive for evaluation of known metastases and evaluation for new metastases."
His OSH Abd/Pelv CT is being loaded to Radiology.
Subsequently, underwent a CT scan in roughly [**7-/2133**] showing a 7.5-cm mass in the lower pole of the right kidney, two other solid lesions in the right kidney as well.
Dominant lesion was 6.5 cm, the other two were 2.3 and 1.2 cm respectively.
One lymph node was negative as well.
- [**2134-6-14**] surveillance CT showed the presence of a small amount of pleural fluid on the right side.
- [**2134-9-5**] DOE and cough, CXR showed a large right pleural effusion.
He had a 5-liter thoracentesis, which was revealed negative cytology.
- [**2134-9-9**] CT showed numerous pleural based masses as well as remaining pleural fluid and he was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 13060**] in [**Location (un) 3844**].
- [**2134-12-28**] Week 7 CT with stable disease - [**2135-1-25**] Week 11 CT with reduction in size of mets - [**2135-3-7**] C2W1 received [**9-25**] doses, with 6 doses held due to development of shock and hypotension requiring pressor support.
- [**2135-4-19**] C2W7 CT with decreased pleural based mets, new concern for RV mass.
This was confirmed on [**2135-4-26**] echo showing 5.4 cm X 2.4 cm RV mass.
[**2135-5-3**] cardiac [**Month/Day/Year 4338**] with similar findings.
- [**2135-5-17**] C2W11 CT with stable disease, unchanged cardiac mass - [**2135-7-7**] cardiac [**Month/Day/Year 4338**] with increased intracardiac met size, otherwise stable disease.
- [**2135-8-2**]: CT showed progressive disease - [**2135-8-9**] C1 sunitinib 50 mg PO daily 4 weeks on 2 weeks off, tolerated well with mild diarrhea only - [**2135-8-23**] C2 sunitinib 50 mg PO daily 4 weeks on 2 weeks off, tolerated well with mild diarrhea and mild neuopathy - [**2135-10-18**] CT torso with stable to decreased size of the numerous pleural-based metastases.
- [**2135-12-16**] Resection of bleeding mets revealed a focus of residual tumor within the hemorrhage - [**2136-1-2**] [**Month/Day/Year 4338**] showed progression of multiple additional metastatic lesions involving the bilateral frontal and left occipital lobe - [**2136-1-10**] CT torso with significant progression of disease.
Progression of multiple lung nodules with multiple new nodules seen.
- [**0-0-**] whole brain radiation - [**2136-1-19**] developed shortness of breath and palpatations, found to have moderate to large pericardial effusion, tamponade requiring emergent pericardial window.

MR is more sensitive for evaluation of known metastases and evaluation for new metastases.
[**2136-2-16**] Abdominal u/s: No evidence of biliary dilation, solid metastases in the liver, or portal vein thrombus.
[**2136-2-20**] : Cardiac echo: Large circumferential pericardial effusion with echo findings suggestive of early tamponade physiology.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-1-23**], the pericardial effusion is now large with findings suggestive of early tamponade physiology.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 48yo man with metastatic RCC s/p nephrectomy, previously on Sutent for brain, lung, and cardiac mets, s/p WBXRT and recent emergent pericardial window, initially presented with two weeks of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness, found to have progressive disease and reaccumulation of pericardial effision s/p repeat window [**2136-2-20**].
#Pericardial effusion/tamponade s/p repeat window Large pericardial effusion seen on echo [**2-20**] with consideration for early tamponade.
Patient with previous pericardial window [**1-19**] with CT surgery.
# Anemia: stable, likely myelosuppression and blood loss.
His labs indicate possible iron deficiency so will start on trial of Ferrex oral supplement daily as an outpatient.
Your liver function tests were elevated but are returning to normal range now.
