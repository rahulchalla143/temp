HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old female with a past medical history significant for end stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on four liters of home O2 with O2 saturations in the low 90s, multiple intubations in the past, on chronic steroids, who is admitted for dyspnea.
She had a chest x-ray done which showed enlarging right pulmonary mass.
She had pulmonary function tests in [**2134**] which showed FEV1/FVC ratio of 48% predicted.
Calcium carbonate.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission she had a temperature of 99.0 F.; heart rate of 84; blood pressure of 120/72; respiratory rate of 24.
Cardiac examination was normal S1 and S2, no murmurs.
Abdominal examination was benign.
Extremity examination showed no edema.
Neurological examination was nonfocal.
LABORATORY:  She had a white blood cell count of 24.2, hematocrit of 39.2, platelets of 437.
She did have a chest x-ray done which showed an interval enlargement in right pulmonary nodule.
She had an EKG done which showed wandering pacemaker with a rate of 90; no ischemic changes.
Her pulmonary status remained stable until [**2138-1-26**], where she was found to have an O2 saturation of 80% on four liters nasal cannula.
This responded to an O2 saturation in the low to mid 90's on non-rebreather.
A repeat chest x-ray was done which showed enlarging mass of the lateral segment of the right middle lobe with near total collapse of the right lower lobe.
The patient did have a PET scan in [**2136**] for work-up of this mass which was negative for cancer, however, this interval enlargement is suspicious for a neoplastic process.
The patient did receive a bronchoscopy at that time while she was in the Intensive Care Unit.
Cytology specimens were taken, however, were not catalogued and analyzed, thus no cytology specimens are available.
The patient did have cultures sent on bronchial washings which were negative for infection.
She did not want to pursue any further diagnostic procedures such was repeat bronchoscopy or CT guided biopsy; however, the patient still requests to be intubated if needed and to be full code.
