In the ED today, pt had a fever of 104.2, was tachycardic to 134.
Her respiratory status remained stable with RR 19-25 and 95% 2L NC.
CXR yesterday showed small retrocardiac pneumonia, but per discussion with Radiology, today's CXR is much worse with LLL white-out and bronchograms, and RUL and RLL involvement as well.
ROS: +: as per HPI, and fever, chills/rigors, night sweats, anorexia, sore throat, chest pain with cough, minimal SOB, cough, headache several days ago (now resolved), mild myalgias - most notable lower back (pt states not uncommon for her), mild-moderate dizziness with standing - improved s/p IVF.
Family History: mother - denies father - OCD brother - OCD  Physical Exam: VS: 99.5  108/59  98  20  94% 2L NC GEN: AAOx3.

CXR [**4-3**] (per conversation with Radiology): Multifocal pneumonia, with dramatic worsening since yesterday.
CXR [**4-2**]: CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS: Dense retrocardiac consolidation is concerning for pneumonia of the superior segment of the left lower lobe.
[**2110-4-3**] Influenza A/B by DFA DIRECT INFLUENZA A ANTIGEN TEST-Neg; DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST-Neg INPATIENT  CT CHEST [**4-3**]: 1.
There are no CT findings to suggest an empyema, but correlation with thoracentesis may be helpful if this diagnosis is being entertained clinically.
LOWER EXTREMITY NON-INVASIVE [**4-9**] IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis.
CT CHEST [**4-9**] 1.
CXR [**4-14**]: Compared to the prior study, there is slight improvement in the left basal aeration with still present significant left retrocardiac consolidation most likely consistent with atelectasis with potential superimposed infection and small pleural effusion.
No evidence of pneumothorax is present in this supine radiograph, but repeated examination with upright radiograph is recommended to exclude the possibility of subtle pneumothorax given the history of pleural tapping.
On arrival patient required a non rebreather to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.
Initially, she had oxygen saturations of 80% on mechanical ventilation.
A CXR demonstrated diffuse interstitial markings, presumably from pulmonary edema.
Her ventilator oxygen concentration was steadily decreased, and her tidal volumes were decreased and respiratory rate was increased with the goal of ARDSnet low tidal volume ventilation.
Her airway was evaluated on [**4-12**] by bronchoscopy and found to be patent.
Sputum cultures grew normal respiratory flora.
Outpatient Physical Therapy Please perform evaluation & treatment of patient for deconditioning following hospitalization.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: 1. community-acquired multifocal pneumonia complicated by respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for pneumonia complicated by difficulty breathing that required a breathing tube and mechanical ventilation.
It is important for you to follow up in order for us to monitor your chest x-ray findings as well as your symptoms.
