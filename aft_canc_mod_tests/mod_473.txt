Infusion stopped and she was treated with Benadryl 50 mg x 1, prednisone 40 mg x 1, ativan 1 mg. Labs at [**Hospital1 **] with WBC 5.8, Hct 33.6 (MCV 83.6), Plts 278, and CK 215.
In our emergency room, her vital signs were stable.
Head CT was negative for acute process.
Biopsy at that time revealed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma and the patient underwent a mastectomy (tumor size was 4.5 cm, ER positive, and Her2neu positive).
Physical Exam: Vital Signs:  Temperature 98.1 F, Blood Pressure 128/80, Pulse 117, Respiration 20, Oxygen Saturation 97% in Room Air.
Cerebellar examination intact.
Pertinent Results: [**2182-4-23**] 06:00PM   GLUCOSE-101 UREA N-12 CREAT-0.6 SODIUM-142 POTASSIUM-3.5 CHLORIDE-104 TOTAL CO2-26 ANION GAP-16 [**2182-4-23**] 06:00PM   NEUTS-80.5* BANDS-0 LYMPHS-14.1* MONOS-2.9 EOS-2.5 BASOS-0.1 [**2182-4-23**] 06:00PM   PT-12.1 PTT-21.6* INR(PT)-1.0  MRI Head [**2182-4-24**]: FINDINGS: All of the sequences with the exception of the axial FLAIR sequence are so severely limited by patient motion as to be practically diagnostically useless.
MRI Head [**2182-4-26**]: FINDINGS: Again, two small enhancing lesions are seen in the left frontal cortical and subcortical region with mild surrounding edema.
Therefore, the differences on the axial images could be due to slice selection.
IMPRESSION: Overall, no significant interval change compared to the previous MRI of [**2182-3-27**].
EEG [**2182-4-25**]: IMPRESSION: Normal portable EEG.
Her electrolytes were within normal limits.
Head CT was negative for acute change.
MRI of brain on admission was poor due to patient movement but white matter edema in periventricular and left temporal lobe regions seemed similar to one month ago.
EEG was negative for epileptiform features.
LP was negative for any cells and culture was negative.
Repeat MRI [**2182-4-26**] showed left frontal cortical and subcortical enhancing lesions with mild surrounding edema unchanged from prior, 15 mm lesions left temporal lobe unchanged, and lesion adjacent to occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right ventricle unchanged.
Release 12HR Sig: Five (5) ML PO Q12H (every 12 hours) as needed.
Followup Instructions: 1 Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) 26**] [**Name8 (MD) 28**], RN Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**] Date/Time:[**2182-5-13**] 8:00 2.
