This prompted her to go to the ER where a head CT demonstrated a 2.7cm parafalcine meningioma with surrounding vasogenic edema and focal mass effect.
An MRI then showed a large extra-axial mass abutting and inseparable from the falx cerebri with mass effect on adjacent parietal lobe with white matter edema.

RUE 0/5, sensation decreased to light touch- began feeling some tingling to fingertips.
Pertinent Results: MRI Brain [**2117-10-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI Brain [**2117-10-8**] (Post-Op): IMPRESSION: Status post resection of left posterior frontal rim-enhancing lesion seen on the previous MRI.
EEG [**2117-10-9**]: No seizure activity noted.
Spine MRI (C-, T-, and L-spine) [**2117-10-13**]: No spinal lesions seen.
Grade 2 anterolisthesis of L4 on 5.
Her post-operative examination was minimally improved relative to her pre-operative examination.
Post-operative MRI revealed no evidence of new CVA.
On [**10-8**] an EEG was performed to rule out seizures secondary to concerns of "twitching"- no seizure activity was documented on EEG.
MRI brain was repeated.
You will not need a MRI since you had one prior to discharge.
