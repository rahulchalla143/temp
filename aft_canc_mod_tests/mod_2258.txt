On presentation to the Emergency Department, the patient was afebrile, tachycardic with a heart rate of 110, and blood pressure of 119/60.
Based on examination and chest x-ray findings of small bilateral pleural effusions, the patient was treated by the Medical team for presumed CHF exacerbation.
The following day the patient had an echocardiogram, which demonstrated a large pericardial effusion circumferential without any signs of tamponade physiology.
On examination was without jugular venous distention or pulsus paradoxus.
The chest tube output was minimal draining some serosanguinous fluid.
Patient  then had a chest CT on [**6-2**], which demonstrated right upper lobe opacities posteriorly, bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left and a moderate pericardial effusion that was present.
LAB VALUES ON TRANSFER FROM THE CCU TO THE MICU TEAM:  The white blood cell count was 9.5, hematocrit was 29.9, platelet count was 239.
On chemistry panel, the sodium is 141, potassium 3.6, chloride 101, bicarb 32, BUN 21, creatinine 0.6, glucose 170, calcium 8.3, magnesium 1.9, phosphorus 3.3.
Chest x-ray done postoperatively on the 16th still demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions, but no change from the prior day.
As far as microbiology data, the patient had no significant organisms grow from blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum cultures, or pericardial or pleural fluid.
Vital signs on transfer to the MICU team were a temperature of 96, pulse of 107, blood pressure 94/42, respiratory rate 20, and pulse oximetry of 96 percent on 10 liters of O2 by face mask.
Pulmonary exam: Breath sounds were audible bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the bases, occasional wheeze was noted.
Abdominal exam was protuberant, but nondistended, soft, positive bowel sounds, and nontender.
Extremities were warm with 2 plus pulses bilaterally bilateral lower extremities.
The bilateral chest tubes    had minimal drainage and it was felt that the right chest    was unsuccessful in draining the loculated pleural    effusion that remained towards the right base on the CAT    scan done on the [**12-3**].
It was noted by CT Surgery that no pleurodesis would be possible at this time.
A followup echocardiogram was also done two days after surgery, which demonstrated a small pericardial effusion, which was thus not thought not to be further contributing to the patient's dyspnea.
Given the fact the patient was not amenable to anticoagulation, we did get lower extremity ultrasounds done, which showed no evidence of clots.
