Paracentesis performed in ED showed hemorrhagic ascites with [**Numeric Identifier 890**] RBC and SBP with 6500 WBC, 83% polys.
EKG showed rapid atrial fibrillation vs. flutter but BP was low so he was bolused with 3L normal saline total.
A dIg level returned <.2 so he was dig loaded with .25 mg IV q6h x 24 hours.

CXR [**2109-2-18**]: Compared to radiograph of seven hours prior.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2109-2-18**]: 1.
ECHO [**2109-3-8**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-12-26**], pulmonary pressures are slightly lower (but still moderately elevated).
Given some more nodular componenets also seen within the lungs, followup chest CT is recommended after resolution of current acute symptoms.
Numerous cultures were sent from his blood, urine, stool, and sputum during his prolonged MICU course/infectious-sepsis work up, and positive culture data included sputum with growth of klebsiella pneumoniae and yeast.
His anasarca was minimally responsive to lasix boluses, followed by starting on lasix drip, which was not tolerated by his blood pressure.
Different measures were tried to control his heart rate, including nodal agents such as an esmolol gtt, but were not tolerated by his blood pressure.
Given his prolonged MICU course, surgery was consulted for possible trach and PEG placement, but felt that Mr. [**Known lastname 24441**] peri-operative mortality risk was > 60%, and therefore was not a candidate for these procedures.
