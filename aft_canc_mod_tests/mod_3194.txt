CXR showed worsening bilateral infiltrates.
Chest CTA that r/o PE and demonstrated diffuse b/l patchy airspace opacities and ground glass opacities (marked progression from previous CT [**7-13**]).
BAL washings were sent which were negative for bacterial,viral or fungal organisms.
Etiology of the patient's respiratory decompensation was not clear but was believed to be likely secondary to the ATG therapy or related to an underlying viral infection.
Pt was treated with diuresis as needed, standing atrovent inhaler (per pulm recs), steroids were tapered, platelets were maintained > 50, and oxygen was weaned as tolerated.
Pt improved with these limited interventions and repeat CXR on [**7-23**] showed marked improvement compared to earlier one on [**7-19**].
At discharge the patient's Hct was 28.7 and plts were 28.He was discharged on [**2123-7-30**] on prednisone and PCP prophylaxis [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/ bactrim.

At discharge the patient's Hct was 28.7 and plts were 28.
Repeat chest CT with diffuse, bilateral alveolar opacities thought to be ?drug toxicity, diffuse viral pneumonia, ?TRALI.
Echo repeated and was normal.
Today, patient acutely hypoxic, dyspneic on floor, requiring 100% NRB and high flow oxygen with sats in 80'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 153**] called for emergent transfer.
Past Medical History: PMH: **Hypoplastic MDS - primary oncologist- [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1557**].
BM bx was performed in [**2123-5-28**], that demonstrated normal cellularity of approx 30-40%, trilineage dysplasia, <1% myeloblasts (on nucleated cells).

1) Hypoxia/resp failure: ARDS w/ bilateral infiltrates on CXR and CT, P/F ratio 78.
The differential also included esophageal perforation, which was considered unlikely as the patient had no history of esophageal intubation.
Repeat CT still inconclusive for tracheal tear, no pneumothorax.
[**Date range (1) 48685**]: The patient's platelet count dropped as low as 6.
After transfusing 1 unit of platelets, platelet count remained at 6, and the patient was transfused 2 more units of platelets during the night.
CXR was taken and showed worsening bibasilar opacities, suggesting fluid or blood.
Patient was bagged and intermittently placed on the vent, but did not tolerate mechanical ventilation with sats dropping to low 80s.
