Pt does have a history of HCC with nodules measuring 2.9 x 2.2 cm and 1.3 x 1.1 cm (segment 8) with attempted EtOH ablation.
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 112**] from [**2142-6-22**] - [**2142-6-27**] for abdominal pain, jaundice, and melena.
Patient was transfused 3 units pRBC for Hct 20 on presentation.
His INR was 5.7 and rose to 11 on his day of discharge.
Due to worsening symptoms of lethargy and persistent melena, patient reported to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
On arrival, INR found to be 8.5.
Admitted to MICU for upper endoscopy, which only showed esophageal varices.
CT scan negative for any intra-abdominal bleeding.
He is receiving vancomycin for one blood culture positive for coag negative stap and cipro for SBP prophylaxis.

His oxygen saturation continue to decline despite ventilator support.
Cardio: Several echocardiogram performed to assess for pulmonary hypertension.
A non contrast CT of the liver on [**6-28**] revealed a cirrhotic liver with mild ascites and intra-abdominal and esophageal varices.
Following transfer to the floor his coagulopathy worsened with a peak INR of 8.5.
This required serial monitoring of coag labs and near daily transfusions of FFP, cryoprecipitate, and platelets with goals of INR<4, Fibrinogen >100, Plt>50.
Transplant criteria lab tests and studies were initiated upon admission to the MICU.
An echo was performed (results in pertinent results) and transplant studies were sent.
His bone scan was negative for mets and he was placed at the top of the transplant list.
# Acute Renal Failure -  The patient's baseline creatinine was up to 2.2 on admission from a baseline of 1.0.
Mr. [**Known lastname 3728**] creatinine trended down and was 1.6 at the time of transfer making hepatorenal syndrome less likely as he responded favorably to a fluid challenge and auto-diuresed.
On the floor the patient continued to autodiurese and his Cr corrected to 0.8.
Over the next several days his Cr was monitored and when below 1.0 he was given 10mg IV lasix doses in an effort to remove the large amount of fluid he was retaining secondary to his multiple transfusions.
On [**7-5**] he developed an O2 requirement  and a cxr demonstrated evidence of fluid overload.
To improve nutritional status, enteral feeding was initiated per nutritional recommendations.
# Low Hematocrit - The patient presented with guaiac positive stools and low hematocrit of 22.9.
His hematocrit dropped precipitously 3 points from his arrival in the ED to admission in the MICU.
The patient was transfused 4 units of FFP before a central line was placed and 1 additional unit of FFP, 2 units of PRBC and platelets were transfused overnight.
An upper endoscopy on the evening of admission, [**6-27**] revealed small varcies, gastropathy and no active bleeding.
A CT of the patients torso was performed on [**6-28**] and ruled out evidence of lower GI bleeding.
A colonoscopy on [**6-29**] showed no evidence of acute gastro-intestinal bleed.
The patient's hematocrit was stable in the low 20s with no acute drops.
No further transfusions were required and transfusion requirements were liberalized (INR>5, PLt <50 Hct < 21) as the patient was not actively bleeding.
Criteria were as follows - fibrinogen > 100, platelets >50, Hct>25.
Medications on Admission: Cipro 750 Q wk Folic acid 1mg daily lactulose 30ml  4x daily nadolol 20mg daily omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 **] spironolactone 50 daily MVI 1 daily thiamine 100mg daily   Discharge Medications: N/A  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Liver failure  Discharge Condition: CMO - expired [**2142-7-13**]  Discharge Instructions: N/A  Followup Instructions: N/A
