CTA [**2147-9-19**]: 1.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial pressure of 127/69mmHg.
Successful thrombectomy, PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with overlapping 3.0 x 15mm and 3.0 x 8 mm Vision BMS which were post dilate dto 3.0 with a quantum maverick.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stent, no dissction and TIMI III flow (See PTCA comments) FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT Chest ([**2147-9-26**]):  IMPRESSION: 1.
While this possibly represents sequela of prior radiation therapy, or inflammatory process, attention on followup CTA would be recommended to document stability.
A repeat ECG showed ST elevations in leads V2-V3.
She remained chest pain free and only slight episode of nausea after cath with sedation meds which she states "always happens with meds".
She was started on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Statin and BB, and a Post-STEMI echo showed hypokinesis in the area of her infarct.
HypoTN/Fever: CXR was unremarkable and she is w/o sputum production, UA with few RBCs in context of recent cancer Dx; on physical exam she is warm but her WBC is not elevated and lactate is unremarkable and does not appear toxic.
HCT dropped from 37 to 32, but remained stable thereafter.
Hct remained in the low 30's to high 20's with CBI.
