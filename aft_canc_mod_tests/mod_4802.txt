CTA showed no PE, but large pericardial effusion, left pleural effusion, and mediastinal adenopathy.
Vitals at this time were remarkable for HR in the 130s and Tmax of 101.5.
He had a bedside US done at [**Hospital1 **] which showed mild RV collapse at diastole but no hypotension was noted.
At time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], his vitals were 113 114.89 20 100% on 2L NC.
At [**Hospital1 18**], his vitals were 96.3 103 127/77 20 97.

ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 45 year old male with no significant past medical history presenting with 3 weeks of dry cough, tachycardia, and subjective dyspnea who was found to have cardiac tamponade and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma.
He was found on lymph node biopsy to have a primary b cell lymphoma.
Echo prior to discharge showed resolution of pericardial fluid.
It is recommended that a repeat Echo is conducted within 1 month of discharge.
Hypodense Liver lesions.He also had hypodense liver lesions that had been noted on abdominal CT.Liver MRI was limited, and liver lesions could not be assessed.
Repeat imaging may be considered as an outpatient.
# Lymphadenopathy: CT shows extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Patient also had lymph node in his neck and had excisional biopsy while in the hospital which showed primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma.
CT showed several lymph nodes as well as pleural and pericardial fluids in your chest and a biopsy was performed.
