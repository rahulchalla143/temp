TTE (Complete) Done [**2145-4-29**] at 8:59:16 AM The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2145-4-29**] at 4:44:04 PM Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-4-29**], the pericardial fluid has been removed.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2145-4-30**] at 12:00:00 PM Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The echo findings are suggestive but not diagnostic of pericardial constriction.

Two weeks ago on CT chest for staging purposes, she was found to have a small pericardial effusion and no pleural effusion.
On admission, she had no clinical evidence of tamponade, however TTE showed significant pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
Pulsus was checked 3-4 times a day with improvement following pericardiocentesis and is currently [**3-9**].
A repeat echo done on [**2145-5-4**] showed no recurrent fluid.
She was set up with repeat echo in about 4 weeks with follow up with Dr [**Doctor Last Name 11723**] scheduled.
Cytology was pending at the time of discharge.
Cytology from effusions was pending at time of discharge.
The echocardiogram will be done on the same day; you should receive a call about this.
