URINE CULTURE (Final [**2127-7-3**]):    <10,000 organisms/ml.
Speciation showed Klebsiella and antibiotics were further narrowed to ceftriaxone and metronidazole.
Her blood pressure improved without the need for pressors and patient was transferred to the floor.
There was no clear source for an infection with negative CT abdomen, urinalysis, chest x-ray, LFTs.
Given clogged J-tube and abdominal pain, intra-abdominal source was suspected.
Surveillance blood cultures were negative.
CT abdomen was unremarkable and LFTs did not indicate biliary obstruction.
Information was obtained from  Cooolidge House Nursing Facility.
