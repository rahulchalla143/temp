A full airway survey was performed down to the subsegmental bronchi.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2196-8-23**] at 3:27:22 PM The left atrium is normal in size.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended to more clearly define the apparent left atrial mass.

# Hemoptysis:  Following initiation of heparin, the patient was noted to have blood tinged sputum.
A bronchoscopy was performed which was without evidence of endotracheal bleed.
Her hematocrit was stable and her symptoms improved.
EKG was normal and there was no JVD or muffled heart sounds to suggest tamponade.
She was monitored on telemetry without any events.
Echo demonstrated the left atrial mass which appeared to originate from the pulmonary vessels.
CT surgery was aware of the patient and felt given the extent of her disease, surgical intervention would not be of benefit.
The patient was stable upon discharge and was to return for a follow-up ECHO in [**2-28**] weeks.
