Of note, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 35870**] for LE edema with was felt to be due to decreased lasix dose and hypoalbuminemia (LENIs neg, no pelvic vein compression on CT abd/pelv., TTE w/ mild worsening inferior hypokinesis).
He was seen for chemo treatment on [**5-21**], when his BP was 95/43.
Patient's labs were notable for WBC of 5.6K with 10% bands, HCT of 28, Plt of 180K, lactate of 2.3, positive UA, troponin of 0.03.
ECG showed NSR with RBBB and old inferior MI; no evidence of acute ischemia or electrical alternans.
CXR showed increasing L effusion and atelectasis.
Patient was given 500mg IV of ciprofloxacin, however was noted to have decrease in his BPs to 80s systolic, w/o response to 500cc NS bolus and 6mg IV of Zofran.
CVL was placed at RIJ and patient was changed to levophed.
He underwent Bedside US which showed moderate pericardial effusion, pulsus was not checked.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS 135 106/68 18 96% RA.

CXR [**2172-6-3**] 5:42 PM FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
CXR [**2172-6-4**] 12:11 AM FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, patient has received a right internal jugular vein catheter.
ECHO Due to [**2172-6-4**] suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-4-13**], the findings arppear similar, although inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis is not appreciated on today's focused study.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo M with Mantle cell lymphoma (on bendamustine and Rituxan), atrial flutter, tachy-CM (last EF 45-50%), recent UTI and episode of urinary retention, prostate cancer s/p XRT [**2158**] who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for LE edema, who presented from [**Hospital1 1501**] for an evaluation of LE edema, urinary retention and hypotension.
CT torso on [**6-14**] showed worsening lymphoma.
MRI showed no CNS disease.
However, after transfer to the cardiology floor, pt increasingly tachypneic, RR 26-30, HR 120s on tele, sats to 70s on 2.5Lnc, started on NRB wtih increased to 90-92%.
EKG showed increased rate but no acute ST changes.
TTE showed new moderate pericardial effusion, EF decreased to 45-50%.
Was fine on the floor for 5 days but after transfer to the MICU (see above) BP decreased to the 70s and he was started on levophed.
However, cath showed no abnormal pressure elevations in RV arguing against any tamponade.
