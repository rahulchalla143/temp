HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old right-handed woman with a history of angina and blocked coronary arteries seen as an outpatient for evaluation of visual problem and a cystic enhancing mass was found on MRI.
He ophthalmologist noted a field cut on the left side and she was sent to have a CT scan of the brain on [**2144-8-4**] and subsequently a gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain on [**2144-8-10**], for which a cystic enhancing mass was found on the right occipital brain.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for a skin rash, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat symptoms, other than the history of present illness, neck, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or musculoskeletal symptoms.
Her weight at the time of admission was 92-94 pounds and her height was 5' 2".
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The vital signs were within normal limits with a blood pressure of 190/94 consistent with hypertensive disease, but she was on Atenolol, heart rate 72.
The cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
The neurological examination revealed that she was awake, alert, and oriented times three.
Cranial nerve examination revealed that the pupils were equal and reactive to light, 3 mm to 2 mm bilaterally equal.
Visual field examination showed an incongruous left-sided field cut, worse in the left eye than the right.
The funduscopic examination revealed sharp disk margins bilaterally with spontaneous venous pulsations.
The motor examination showed a drift of the right upper extremity but no pronation.
Her muscle strength was [**4-26**] in all muscle groups except for the right iliac psoas which was 4+/5.
The deep tendon reflexes were 2+ bilaterally except for absence of bilateral ankle jerks.
The sensory examination was intact to touch and proprioception and gait was hemiparetic in the right leg.
Her vital signs were checked and considered stable when she was seen and it was considered that she probably had a likely vasovagal episode.
Her hematocrit at the time was 29.2, white count 14.3, platelets 245,000.
However, her sodium was 129 with potassium of 4.4, chloride 96, C02 23, BUN and creatinine within normal limits, and blood sugar 298.
CK 80 and CK MBs were pending at that time and were unremarkable when completed.
Due to the hematocrit of 29.2, a decision was made to transfuse if the hematocrit fell less than 29 and the patient remained stable then until later on [**2144-8-14**], at which time she complained of an episode of chest discomfort which was accompanied by EKG changes in the evening.
She subsequently underwent endoscopy which identified the source of bleeding on endoscopy.
Hematocrit at that time was 30.9, platelets 127,000, white count 12.6.
PT 13.5, INR 1.3, PTT 26.1 and CPK of 59.
The patient then was seen in consultation by the Thoracic Surgery Service after a CT scan of the chest and abdomen revealed lung masses as well as an adrenal mass.
This raised the question of a high likelihood of a metastatic lung lesion as the primary source of the brain tumor and arrangements were made for the patient to undergo a fine-needle aspiration and biopsy at a subsequent hospitalization.
