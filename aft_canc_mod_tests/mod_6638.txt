Patient had an abnormal chest xray which led to a CT scan that revealed 2.2 x 1.7 cm left upper lobe mass, several areas of right pleural density adjacent to RUL and RLL with the largest being at the lower lobe posterolaterally measuring 3 x 1.4 cm and a moderate left pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis.
She had a bronchoscopy at an OSH where there were no endobronchial lesions and the lesion in the LUL was biopsied (no malignant cells).
PET scan revealed FDG uptake within multiple pleural deposits as well as the slips of the diaphragm and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.

CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:    allergy to iodine    Final Report EXAM: CT chest [**2174-5-24**].
TECHNIQUE: Volumetric ct of the chest without IV contrast.
Several discrete pleural or pleural-based nodules marginate the left mediastinal pleura including 1.9 cm nodule (2, 25), 2.9 cm nodule (2, 28), and 2.1-cm nodule (2, 30).
No definite nodularity is seen in the right pleural effusion, though there is a serous density, 1.8 cm pleural-based nodule higher in the right hemithorax, located along the lateral right pleural surface (2, 20), and a 3.5 x 1.7-cm anterior, softtissue nodule (2, 44) difficult to differentiate between a very inferior pleural nodule and a subdiaphragmatic nodule.
Several small subphrenic lymph nodes are noted on the right (2, 41), and there are scattered retrocrural and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, none of which meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Comparison to previous imaging (per clinical notes a PET-CT has been performed) would be extremely helpful for correlating these findings.
CXR [**5-31**] The bilateral pleural effusion is present, left more than right, moderate to large on the left and small to moderate on the right.
She had a Chest CT that revealed a left pleural effusion with areas concerning for malignancy in the lungs and the abdomen.
She had a pleuroscopy with biopsy [**2174-5-24**].
The bx of the pleural showed malignancy as well as the plural fluid.
That night patient developed hypotension with BP down to 60 systolic tx with IVF 2 liters with improvement Creatine climbing on admission 1.1 up to 1.9.
