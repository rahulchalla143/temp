GI performed endoscopy on [**2204-5-7**] which showed non-bleeding esophageal and gastric varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and a bleeding polyp noted in proximal body of stomach injected with epinephrine with hemostasis, as well as a colonoscopy on [**2204-5-8**] and old blood.
He received 3 U PRBCs, his Hct remained stable at 27, and he was called out to [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**] on [**5-9**], where his stools were noted to clear prior to discharged home.

EGD on [**5-7**] with non bleeding varices at the lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction, portal hypertensive gastropathy, polyp in proximal body of stomach, and 8 mm non bleeding polyp adjacent to hepatico-jejunostomy.
The patient had an RBC scan, which showed no definite bleeding seen on 90 minute dynamic imaging, but activity in the rectum on left lateral is compatible with rectal bleeding.
Pt had a sigmoidoscopy the next morning on [**5-12**] that noted blood coating the colon, but no e/o active bleeding.
The patient's HCT remained stable at 34 prior to call out to the floor.
A tagged red blood cell study was repeated which showed no source of bleeding.
The decision was made between the patient and the team to proceed with an exploratory laparotomy and a possible endoscopy in the OR.
A colonoscope was advanced in from this location distally toward the terminal ileum and then withdrawn.
Hematocrit was trended, in the ensuing days he received a total of 4 units pRBCs.
A head CT was obtained which showed no evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
An LP was performed and infectious etiologies including cryptococcus were ruled out.
An EEG showed an abnormal routine EEG in the waking state due to a mildly slow and disorganized background with frequent theta rhythms.
He was covered with Vanco and meropenum, but never was febrile and all cultures were returned as negative and the antibiotics were discontinued.
He continued to have large volume ascited from the wound VAC and continued with albumin and fluid replacements, the albumin replacement will continue upon discharge and extra fluids are being instilled with tube feeds.
His UA was concerning for a potential UTI, and he was covered with ciprofloxacin.
His urine cultures eventually returned contaminated, and the ciprofloxacin was dicontinued.
Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine 1.4 on admission, likely due to decreased perfusion in the setting of bleed.
