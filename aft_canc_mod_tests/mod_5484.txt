CT OF THE PELVIS: There is a small amount of free fluid in the dependent portion of the pelvis.
The rectum, sigmoid, bladder, seminal vesicles, and prostate appear unremarkable.
ERCP [**2110-9-7**]: Five spot fluoroscopic images were obtained in the gastroenterology without a radiologist present.

On POD #15 ([**2110-8-20**]) he was taken to the OR for an esophagogastric leak where he underwent an anastomotic revision.
On [**2110-8-21**] during an exploratory thoracotomy, an intercostal muscle flap reinforcement of the esophagogastric anastomosis was performed.
On [**2110-9-8**] an EGD showed a chest tube in the esophageal lumen, which was pulled back and an ERCP was performed on the same date and a pancreatic stent was unable to be placed due to papilla edema.
A CT scan obtained on [**2110-9-11**] revealed a persistent esophageal leak.
On POD #57 he passed a bedside swallowing test and was started on clear liquids.
On [**2110-10-22**] the esophageal stent was replaced and the pancreatic stent was replaced.
Endocrine:  His blood sugars were well controlled with sliding scale insulin.
Another unit of PRBCs was transfused on [**2110-8-9**] after his hematocrit dropped from 32 to 27.
The PICC line was changed and the tip culture revealed no growth.
On [**2110-10-13**] the empyema culture grew klebsiella, enterococcus and [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
On [**2110-10-28**] after his chest CT he developed a temp of 102.3, was pancultured.
The preliminary cultures grew GNR and GPC in pairs, chains and clusters no change from previous cultures.
