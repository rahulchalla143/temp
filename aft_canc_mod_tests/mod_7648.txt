Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %) on low dose epinephrine infusion).
The apical, inferior, inferoseptal, inferolateral, and lateral segments appear severlely hypokinetic and the anterior segments appear mildly to moderately hypokinetic.
The inferior, inferoseptal, lateral and apical segments remain severely hypokinetic but the function of the anterior, anterolateral, and anteroseptal segments is improved.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is improved with an EF of about 25-30%.
Right ventricular systolic function is improved and is now mild to moderately globally depressed.
