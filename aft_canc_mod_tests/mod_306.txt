CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2180-8-12**] PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The lungs are hyperinflated and the dirapgrams are flattened, consistent with COPD.
The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess, due the presence of a large hiatal hernia.
IMPRESSION: 1) COPD 2) Large hiatal hernia 3) No chf 4) Small posterior effusion.
RENAL U.S. Study Date of [**2180-8-12**] FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.2 cm.
