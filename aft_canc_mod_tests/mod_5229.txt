She states that she feels that her abdomen has been growing slowly over the last 6 months, and had attributed it to weight gain, although she had only gained three pounds over this period of time.
In the ED at the OSH, she had an abdominal ultrasound which showed a ascites.
This prompted a CT scan which was notable for a complex cystic low abdominal and pelvic mass, measuring 16 x 16.5 x 11.5 cm, positioned superior to the uterus.
She was admitted to the OSH, and overnight, she developed a leukocytosis to 23,600, up from 11,000 on admission with a bandemia of 25%.
Her creatinine was noted to increase from baseline of 0.8 on admission to 2.8 ([**2-10**] at 6:45).
Her blood pressures transiently decreased to SBP of the 70s, and she was started on a dopamine gtt (1 mcg/min).

Comparison with prior studies if available would be helpful.

Respiratory failure In the MICU, she underwent evaluation to r/o pulmonary embolus given her rapid decompensation.
Given the likelihood of acute renal failure from CT contrast, she could not be evaluated with CTA.
As a result, she had LENIs that were neg and an echo that showed good ejection fraction with no RV strain.
Her respiratory failure was thought to be secondonary to mod/large bilat effusions seen on chest CT and large ascites, as well as volume overload from acute renal failure.
A CT of the head was performed to r/o neurological injury.
Acute Renal failure: On presentation to the MICU, the patient was anuric and her creatinine was significantly higher than at the OSH.
A CT of the abdomen on [**2-9**] showed no evidence of obstruction.
The Renal service was consulted and they recommended CVVHD dialysis which she underwent over the following 7 days with improvement in her urine output and creatinine measurement.
Blood, urine, sputum cultures were obtained that did not reveal any signs of infection.
The CXR had no evidence of infiltrates.
The abdominal ultrasound showed some cholelithiasis but no evidence of cholecystitis.
Her neuro exam was non-focal.
Once stable from her respiratory status, she underwent CT Head that revealed a small hyperdense mass in right cerebellum c/w meningioma.
She was recommended for further imaging with MRI.
No further work-up was done.
Pelvic mass: CT of the abdomen from OSH suggested a large pelvic mass.
On her second day, she underwent paracentesis under ultrasound guidance to improve her respiratory status and to R/O bacterial peritonitis.
Although the fluid seemed suggestive of peritonitis, this was not associated with bacteria on gram stain.
Her CA-125 was mildly elevated at 96, CEA as measured at 10, a 19-9 was significantly elevated at >[**Numeric Identifier 38500**] and her HCG was negative.
A chest X-ray revealed worsening collapse of her RLL and her RML.
An infiltrate could not be ruled out.
An ABG was performed that did not show evidence of hypoxemia.
Given her renal failure from CT contrast, she was not recommended for CTA.
Moreover, given her ventilatory defects, a VQ scan was not recommended either.
