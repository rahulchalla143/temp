At that time, an MRI revealed a new infarct around his right hemisphere and his left white matter, which caused him to have left hemiparesis.
He had a head CT on [**10-30**] showing an increased subdural on the left side and was brought to the Emergency Room with a fever of 103.8, and had a repeat head CT on arrival which showed increased interval change of a chronic left subdural, now with midline shift and mass effect.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temp on admission was 103.8, heart rate 119, blood pressure 148/54, 100 percent on room air.
He had a full fever panculture work-up and was started on empiric antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, ceftaz and Flagyl.
He had a chest x-ray which did not show any pneumonia at that time.
His blood pressure was kept strictly below 130.
Postoperatively, his head CT essentially showed little change of the blood evacuation on the left side, though he seemed to be somewhat more responsive neurologically postop.
His first blood cultures came back gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains.
On [**2125-11-3**], a repeat head CT showed little change in the amount of blood on the subdural site.
Infectious disease was consulted on [**11-5**], as his blood cultures showed Enterococcus in his blood, which was VRE 4/4 bottles, with 2 speciated as enterococcus, [**1-28**] with MRSA.
Ultrasound of his upper extremity showed no right internal jugular vein clot detected.
Echo results indicated a moderate risk for endocarditis, and they recommended prophylaxis, and he will be treated with linezolid for 6 weeks.
Surveillance blood cultures were also obtained on [**11-5**] and [**11-6**].
Due to the echocardiogram results, we had asked to have a TEE done; however, Mrs. [**Known lastname 3805**] did not want Mr. [**Known lastname 3805**] to [**Known lastname 19806**] a TEE at this time.
However, the goal was changed and tube feedings to Impact with fiber to a goal rate of 70 cc/h to provide 1680 kcal/D.
His blood cultures on [**2125-11-6**] were final for no growth.
He was seen by orthopedics who evaluated the patient, obtained an AP and lateral shoulder film which showed no acute fracture or dislocation, and recommended some physical therapy.
Mr. [**Known lastname 3805**] was noted to have skin breakdown over his coccyx area for which he has been having a DuoDerm placed.
A repeat head CT was done prior to discharge and felt that his left-sided subdural hematoma had much improved and was close to resolving.
