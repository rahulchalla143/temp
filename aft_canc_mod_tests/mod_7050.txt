He was previously admitted in mid-[**Month (only) 216**] after an outpatient CT scan of his chest showed a large right lung abscess and a small pulmonary embolism.
Bronchoscopy was performed but no drainage of the abscess was attempted due to perceived high risk of seeding, and he was initiated on broad-spectrum antibiotics for likely post-obstruction pneumonia complicated by an empyema in the hopes they would keep the infection at bay.
