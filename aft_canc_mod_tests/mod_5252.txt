[**9-20**] PET CT INTERPRETATION: There is focal abnormal uptake of FDG in a cavitary right apical mass with an SUVmax of 18.1.
The CT shows vascular calcifications, a left renal cyst (not FDG-avid; 4.5 cm diameter), a small right non-FDG-avid cyst and osteophytosis at numerous spinal levels.
MRI ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2131-9-22**] 5:37 PM MRI ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  Reason: MRI ADRENAL LEFT SIDE ONLY - please eval.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2131-9-22**] 5:37 PM MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  Reason: Eval.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images were obtained before gadolinium.
Following gadolinium no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement identified.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2131-9-24**] 8:25 PM CHEST (PA & LAT) Reason: eval for consolidation.pna  HISTORY: Right upper lobe mass and elevated white count.
Lung volumes are lower and there is interstitial abnormality at the right base exaggerated by overlying soft tissue.
On HD2, bronchoscopy showed scant bleeding from posterior segment of RUL; cytology sent and no malignant cells found.
Patient had MRI of the head and abdomen which showed b/l adrenal hyperplasia, left greater than right.
