An abdominal ultrasound on [**2161-8-18**] revealed gallstones and concern for a 4-mm gallbladder polyp without any evidence of cholecystitis.
She underwent a CT scan on [**2161-9-18**] that also showed gallstones with excessive calcifications in the gallbladder and an ultrasound was recommended for further evaluation.
Further imaging and work-up included a CT scan on [**2162-4-24**] that demonstrated ongoing cholelithiasis with a prominent gallbladder and common bile duct/gallbladder neck.
She underwent a laparoscopic-converted-to-open cholecystectomy performed by you on [**2162-4-30**] for persistent epigastric and right upper quadrant pain with gallstones and calcifications of her gallbladder seen on CT scan.
