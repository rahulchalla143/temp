However, no discrete aneurysm formation  [**2162-4-8**] CT Brain - Interval placement of ventricular drain with slight decrease in ventricular size.
[**2162-4-8**] MRI Brain w/w/o contrast - Abnormal enhancement is seen in the suprasellar region  surrounding the hemorrhage extending to the sellar region suspicious for a suprasellar mass.
[**2162-4-9**] CT brain - Postoperative changes related to right ventriculostomy catheter placement with fluid and air along its course.
Right lateral ventricular blood clot has been evacuated.
[**2162-4-10**] MRI brain - Status post resection of the suprasellar mass.
[**4-15**] CT brain - stable position of [**Month/Year (2) 5041**] drains bilaterally.
stable suprasellar hemorrhage  [**4-15**] CT brain - s/p [**Month/Year (2) **] removal.
[**4-18**] CT Head- Post-operative changes following right craniotomy for resection of suprasellar mass.
Overlying subgaleal fluid collection is noted, possibly increased from prior studies.
[**4-20**] CT Head: 1.
[**4-22**] CT Head: Stable ventricular size.
Angiogram was negative for an AVM or aneurysm.
An MRI of the brain with contrast revealed a small enhancing lesion above the pituitary gland.
Her sodium rapidly increased from 141 to 157.
Her sodium elevated to 162.
She had a post operative head CT and MRI which showed partial resection of sellar mass and post operative changes.
Bilateral [**Month/Year (2) 5041**] wean was begun on [**4-12**].
A stitch was placed and no further leakage was noted.
On [**4-15**] a repeat Head CT showed stable size of lateral ventricles without evidence of HCP.
Another repeat head CT deomonstrated no acute hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
Overnight, sodium decreased to 132 and given concern for SIADH patient was fluid restricted.
She then began putting out excessive amounts of urine and continued to be tachycardic so a CTA chest was performed which was positive for PE.
Repeat Na was trending up (157) so she was started on IVF per endocrine recs.
On [**4-20**] her serum Na continued to trend up to 160 and her urine output increased to greater than 300cc/hr for 2 hours.
She responded to an oral dose of DDAVP and her urine output dropped off.
She continued to receive IVF and her Serum Na started to downtrend.
Serum Na, OSM, Urine Na Osm and spec gravity were followed closely for DDAVP dosing.
On the evening of [**4-19**] it was noted that she had an enlarging subgaleal collection under the right craniotomy site and so a head CT was performed that demonstrated communication with the ventricular system.
A followup head CT was obtained on the morning of [**4-21**] that showed enlargement of the subgaleal collection.
Repeat head CT on [**4-22**] demonstrated no increase in ventricular size but did show residual fluid collection.
She was then followed with serial head CTs.
HEr subgaleal collection had slightly reaccumulated and her neuro status was stable so the collection was not drained.
She remained stable in the SDU on [**4-24**] and [**4-25**] and her neuro exam was improved as well.
Her subgaleal collection remained stable if not slightly decreased without headwrap.
Her serum Na continued to improve and the salt tabs were stopped and fluid restriction was lifted however on [**4-27**] her serum Na droppped to 131.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
