Postoperatively, on [**2175-9-4**], a CT scan demonstrated no evidence of metastatic disease, as did CT scans on [**9-10**] and [**1-9**], [**2175**].
However, a followup CT scan on [**2176-4-1**] demonstrated a new 5- mm hypodensity that appeared to be in segment V of the liver, too small to definitively characterize, but suspicious for a metastatic lesion.
A followup CT scan on [**2176-5-5**] demonstrated that the lesion in the right lobe had increased to 1.1 cm.
A CT scan on [**2176-6-2**] demonstrated no change in the liver lesion.
A followup CT scan on [**2176-7-19**] demonstrated a 2.3-cm mass that is hypodense with a surrounding rim of enhancement that was interpreted as being in Segment VII of the liver, and a small cyst in Segment IV.
The pelvic CT demonstrated no change in the presacral soft tissue density and areas of low density within the pelvis, some of which were thought to represent simple adnexal structures.

Pathology revealed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (2.7 cm), moderately differentiated and consistent with metastasis from the anal canal squamous cell carcinoma.
Following the procedure, UOP was 50cc/hr with Foley in place (Cr=0.6).
BP was noted to be low (90s/60s) and patient was given 500cc bolus LR, otherwise she reported adequate pain control, denied nausea/vomiting, and was tolerating sips.
On POD#1, liver function tests were elevated (ALT=4282,AST=4295,AlkPhos=150,TBili=0.9), and thus a liver ultrasound was obtained and labs were repeated.
Repeat LFTs were ALT=4319, AST=3688, AlkPhos=187.
She underwent celiac angiography via 6F [**Doctor Last Name **] 3 sheath and balloon angioplasty.
The patient received Heparin IV 4000U and 1U pRBC, sodium bicarbonate 150mEq (200cc bolus and then 100cc/hr x6h), and mucomyst x4 doses.
She was transferred to the SICU following thrombolysis and a CT pelvis w/contrast and CTA abdomen w/and w/o contrast were obtained to evaluate hepatic vessels and possible contrast extravasation from the angioplasty.
Serial Hct and LFTs were checked.
Due to temperature of 101.7, she was started on zosyn, vanco, and flagyl on POD #3, and blood and urine cultures were taken.
On POD#7, CT abdomen - triphasic with arterial reconstruction was obtained as followup to initial CT on [**2176-8-10**].
Heparin gtt was continued with goal INR 60-80.
She was scheduled to have PT, PTT, and INR drawn on Thursday [**8-22**].
