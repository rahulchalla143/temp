In the ED, patient became tachycardic, hypertensive and his oxygen satuartions hovered in the low to mid 90% range despite oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.
CT abdomen was negative for perforation, but the patient was admitted to the surgical ICU for further work-up and treatment.
Given his mental status changes, a head CT was performed which was negative for acute pathology.
CTA showed pneumonia but no PE.
The specific results are as follows: CT chest/abd/pelvis  1.
Not significantly changed in size or distribution  since the PET examination of [**2133-8-20**].
Suboptimal examination of the abdomen due to suboptimal patient positioning  An MRI of the spine was then performed as the patient had considerable lower extremity weakness.
The results of that study are as follows:  Further compression of the T5 vertebral body results in canal compromise and cord compression.
In advance of inguinal radiation therapy for his resected SCC, repeat PET scanning on [**2133-7-8**] compared to a [**5-1**] PET scan showed new uptake of FDG in left iliac, bilateral para-aortic lymph nodes, and T5 and L3 vertebral bodies.
(2) Additionally, he has had evaluation of high PSAs, with deep core biopsies on [**2133-7-8**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 892**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 55794**], with pathology showing adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland, [**Doctor Last Name **] 7 (3+4), currently undergoing lupron therapy.

PET scan from [**2133-8-20**] he had increase uptake in proximal femur.
X-ray of R femur/ knee were done to r/o pathologic/impending pathologic fracture which were both which were negative for signs of fx.
Repeat MRI of L spine was ordered on [**9-10**] which showed evidence of L3 compression fx and more retropulsion of fragments and reduction in the anterior/posterior dimension of the thecal sac by approximately 50% but CSF is still visible around the cauda equina.
He recieved aggressive pre/post chemo hydration, and chemo had no effect on creatinine during admission.
No further chemo was given during admission as plt were dropping (57,000 on [**9-17**]) and ANC of 1120 on [**9-17**].
Please get daily CBC with absolute neutrophil count(ANC) and chem-10 and fax results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 638**], daily.
Steroid taper as follows: 4mg TID from [**Date range (1) 4359**]; 4mg [**Hospital1 **] from [**Date range (1) 12903**]; 2mg [**Hospital1 **] from [**Date range (1) 55796**]; 2mg each day from [**Date range (1) 55797**] and then stop the medication.
3) PNA: PNA on admission both clinically and per CT chest.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have pulmonary edema on CXR on [**8-27**], likely secondary to aggressive IVF hydration for chemotherapy.
4)ID: Blood cultures from [**8-24**] - 2/4 bottles with GNR - Salmonella species sensitive to both levofloxacin and ampicillin - both of which he was already taking for PNA.
All further survellience cultures were negative.
Patient has had extensive imaging of head/abd/pelvis/chest since admission with no sign of active internal bleeding and stool guiaic negative.
Thrombocytopenia: Mr [**Known lastname 55795**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] dropped during admission after receiving chemotherapy.
HIT Ab test was negative and TCP was attributed to chemo regimen.
His platelets were stil trending down on discharge, with plt count of 57,000 on day prior to discharge.
SBP's on transfer to OMED were consistently between 170-200 likely secondary to pain and fluid overload, and his outpatient HCTZ and actopril were restarted.
Blood pressure was very well controlled on HCTZ(50mg each day), Quinapril(10mg each day) and metoprolol(25mg TID).
Continue to monitor chemistries and electrolytes and replete as necessary.
