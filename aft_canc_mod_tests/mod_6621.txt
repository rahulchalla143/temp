3D CT angiogram [**2133-8-31**] demonstrated a glomus vagale 4.1x 2.2x 1.8cm that extends from below the region of the carotid bifurcation and up to the skull base.
An octreotide scan had tracer uptake in the area of the left glomus vagale.
The SPECT/CT images also demonstrate a 5-mm nodule in the left anterior lung without evidence of tracer uptake.
She underwent preoperative embolization which was successful for an upper portion of the tumor, however, a separate portion which was smaller and inferior could not be embolized  adequately.
Pertinent Results: [**2133-11-11**] 09:01PM   WBC-16.0* RBC-3.58* HGB-11.2* HCT-31.5* MCV-88 MCH-31.1 MCHC-35.4* RDW-12.8 [**2133-11-11**] 09:01PM   PLT COUNT-251 [**2133-11-11**] 09:01PM   PT-12.8 PTT-25.0 INR(PT)-1.1  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 38 year old woman with history of bilateral carotid body tumors and left glomus vagale who was admitted pre-operatively on [**2133-11-11**].
She was taken to the ICU for first 24 hours for monitoring of neurological status, which remained stable, and was thereafter transfered to the floor.
The details of her hospital course are reviewed below by ststems:  Neuro: Postoperatively, the patient was taken to the ICU for closer monitoring of her vital signs and neurological function, given the proximity of the surgery to the carotid artery.
Her exam remained stable and she was transfered to the floor on POD 1.
Regarding her cranial nerve exam, post-operatively, she was noted to have some weakness with tongue movement to the left (left CN XII) as well as paralysis of the left true vocal cord, deceased peristalysis of left pharyngeal wall with some pooling of secretions on that side which was anticipated given intra-op resection of the left vagus nerve.
As a result of anticipated difficulty with POs, an NGT was placed on POD #1; on POD #4, after evaluation by speech and swallow, a diet was initiated with compensatory maneuvers (see below) for her nerve deficits.
CV: She had elevated BP to SBP 160-180 in the initial post-operative days which were attributed to pain and hemodynamic re-adjustment after carotid body removal.
Her blood pressure normalized by POD #5.
She was instructed to follow-up with PCP as an outpatient to have her blood pressure monitored.
Resp: The patient had oxygen saturations >95% throughout admission.
An NGT was placed on POD #1 and she was started on continuous tube feed diet with Replete with fiber @ 60 cc/hr.
Speech/swallow was consulted on POD #4 and she underwent a video floroscopic examination to evaluate pharyngeal swallowing mechanism and aspiration.
Please have you HR and Blood pressure checked at this time.
