ECHO [**12-24**]: Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-9-25**], anteroseptal hypokinesis with focal apical akinesis is now present.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2120-12-24**] 3:38 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Limited evaluation of the gastroesophageal pull-through and of the upper abdomen.

#SOB/fever: CXR on admission with bibasilar opacities; left side noted to be chronic.
CT chest from OSH and CT torso from admission reviewed with unchanged pleural effusion, new RLL and RML infiltrates.
Additionally, BNP elevated on admission and CHF was also considered (see below).
Pleural fluid was negative for malignancy, but recurrence was still highly suspected with elevated CEA and continued weight loss.
ECHO showed interval change from previous with moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent).
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
# Acute likely systolic CHF: Patient with new diagnosis of CHF with pleural effusion and EF of 30%.
# Anemia: Iron studies consistent with ACD .
While a tap of fluid around your lung did not show malignancy, we continue to suspect that you have a cancer recurrence.
