A STSG was then used to cver the rest of the defect.
His flap was monitored hourly by doppler of the venous and arterial anastomosis as well as with a continuous venous doppler that was sutured around the vein.
Over the next few days he continued to have low grade temps as well as persistent headaches, eventually we repeated a CT scan.
His pain meds were switched to PO, his IV was saline locked, and his venous doppler was clipped at the scalp.
