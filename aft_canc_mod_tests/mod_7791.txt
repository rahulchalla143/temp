Suboptimal evaluation of reported liver lesion.
CT abd [**2164-3-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
He also received propofol for sedation during the ERCP which may have contributed to transient hypotension.
His home metoprolol and finasteride were held and his blood pressures remained stable.
Sphincterotomy was performed and cytology samples were obtained for histology which was positive for adenocarcinoma.
After completion of these procedures, he underwent a liver biopsy by U/S guided approach.
Of note, he failed IR guided biopsy at [**Hospital6 89677**].
Of note, his CXR showed very large and multiple calcified lymphnodes.
We did a CT of the chest to rule out primary or metastatic lung cancer.
The CT showed no evidence of lung malignancy.
GI recommended against colonoscopy as his liver biopsy came back positive for adenocarcinoma suggestive of cholangicarcinoma.
Patient was continued on Zosyn for 2 weeks course ending [**2164-3-2**] (OSH blood cultures grew E-COLI resistent to Levofloxacion, Ciprofloxacin, Ampicillin, Gentamycin and sensitive to Zosyn, Bactrim, Ceftriaxone, Ceftazidime, Amikcin, and Imipenim).
Once transferred to the surgery service the patient's zosyn was continued and his LFT's were trended.
on HD 10 he received 1 unit of PRBC's [**2-15**] for a HCt of 23, after which his Hct stabalized.
his cardiac enzymes were cycled and were his Hct and chemistries.
An UGI w/ SBFT was done on HD 19 that showed a narrowing of the first and second portion of the duodenum and delayed gastric emptying due to the gastric outlet obstruction.
