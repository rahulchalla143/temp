Subsequently she had wide excision with rotation flap on [**2165-2-7**].
She was seen at an OSH for this and a CT scan showed bilateral PE's.
As stated in the HPI, she was mostly asymptomatic at the time of admission, breathing without difficulty and her oxygen saturations in the mid-to-high 90s on room air.
She continued to have normal oxygen saturations but her worsening clinical status prompted a CTA which showed the subsegmental PEs had now become a right lobar PE.
She was promptly transferred to the surgical intensive care unit where an echocardiogram was performed to rule out right heart strain and was negative and a head CT was performed to rule out metastatic disease in the head/embolic processes; it was negative.
Her respiratory status worsened and she required oxygen support of [**1-24**] L nasal cannula to maintain saturations in the mid 90s.
Vascular surgery and a hem/onc consults were obtained due to continued worsening of her PE while on anticoagulation, she was taken to the OR by the vascular surgery team and had an IVC filter placed.
Post-operatively, she returned to the ICU on a heparin drip before being switched over to argatroban in the possibility that she was HIT positive (her platelet count was 327 on admission, slowly trending downwards to 158 on HD 6 prior to being switched to argatroban).
The HIT panel returned positive as well as a serotonin release assay.
CXR showed gradual improvement in terms of aeration and her symptoms improved where she was ambulating, tolerating regular diet, no longer dyspneic and she no longer required oxygen, once again with oxygen saturations in the high 90s on room air.
She was therapeutic on HD 16 with an INR of 4.1 on the argatroban drip.
The argatroban drip was discontinuation with discussion with the Hem/Onc service on HD 17, day of discharge, when patient's INR was 4.7.
On day of discharge, she was no longer tachycardic with HR in the 90s and BP in her baseline systolic 100s-110s.
She was monitored on telemetry throughout.
They recommended ruling out acute sources of bleeding with a pelvic, transvaginal ultrasound which should only fibroids in the uterus with the rest of the study normal.
A TSH, HCG and prolactin level were checked and normal.
Heme: Her hematocrit was monitored throughout her hospitalization and was stable in the 30-35 range.
Her heart rate and blood pressure were unchanged from prior baselines (systolic BP as noted above in 100s-110s range, consistent with rest of hospitalization).
She was instructed to follow-up her Hct in addition to her INR with her PCP appointment on [**Name9 (PRE) 766**], [**2165-4-15**].
Blood Draw  Sig: One (1) Blood Draw  ONCE: Please check INR for coumadin monitoring and a Hematocrit.
You had an ultrasound which showed fibroids and other lab testing was normal.
Followup Instructions: Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**4-15**], at 9:45 AM to have your blood drawn and your INR and a hematocrit level checked.
Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 28434**] from Ob/Gyn on [**5-13**] at 10:00 AM in the Ob/[**Hospital **] clinic.
