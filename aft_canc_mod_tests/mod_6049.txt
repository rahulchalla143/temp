LABORATORY DATA:  CBC notable for a white count of 19.7, hematocrit 33.9, platelet count 503, differential disclosed 95 percent neutrophils, 0 percent bands, 3 percent lymphocytes; chemistries notable for a sodium of 132, potassium 5.4, chloride 94, bicarbonate 19, BUN 40, creatinine 1.8 from his baseline of 1.1, glucose 389, anion gap was 19, calcium 8.5, phosphate 3.9, magnesium 1; PT 14.1, INR 1.3, PTT 25.8; ALT 12, AST 19, total bilirubin 0.6, alkaline phosphatase 87, albumin 3.1; urinanalysis was clear, there was no evidence of infection; blood cultures and urine cultures were drawn.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 116 beats per minute, normal intervals, normal axis, evidence for left ventricular hypertrophy.
Chest x-ray disclosed an ill-defined left lower lobe opacity, most likely consistent with pneumonia.
He was administered metered dose inhalers, and sputum culture was sent to the laboratory.
Sputum culture grew oropharyngeal flora.
The patient was pancultured, and to date, cultures remain negative.
The patient also received 6.4 L of fluid in the Emergency Department to maintain his CVP greater than 10.
A cortisol stimulation test was done given that the patient chronically received steroids for his [**Name (NI) **] cancer.
Three days into his hospital course, however, stress-dose steroids were discontinued since the patient's blood pressures remained stable.
Acute renal failure:  On presentation the patient had a BUN and creatinine of 40/1.8 with a baseline creatinine around 1.
