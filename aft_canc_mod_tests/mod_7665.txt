CT head [**12-2**]: Multiple new hypodensities are noted throughout the right cerebral hemisphere, most concentrated in the centrum semiovale, and with regions of [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter involvement.
Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2146-12-6**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-11-28**], ventricular function appears similar.
# Hypoxemia/Respiratory distress - Patient with SOB and cough x 4 days, fever, hypoxemia and CXR showing diffuse bilateral infiltrates.
Chest CT demonstrated multifocal infection (RLL and RML consolidation likely from aspiration) vs lung hemorrhage vs leukemic infiltration.
Bronchoscopy reveals diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and no micro-organisms.
Platelets transfused to >50 for alveolar hemorrhage.
ECHO showed preserved LV function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Tumor lysis labs stable with K, phos, uric acid all within normal limits.
Transfusion goals hct>21, plt>50 given alveolar hemorrhage.
# CVA - Mass seen on CT head and MRI on admission, thromboemobolic right occipital infarct, most likely secondary to DIC as complication of APML.
Neuro exam significant for lack of withdrawal to noxious stimuli on left and + Babinski on the left.
Stat CT head showed multiple new hypodensities throughout R centrum semiovale with diffuse hemispheric edema.
SBP maintained below 180 in the acute setting.
MRI/MRA of the brain showed acute right hemispheric predominantly deep watershed infarct without occlusion in right MCA.
He was noted to have anisocoria briefly, with head CT showing cerebral edema surrounding evolving infarcts.
He was briefly treated with mannitol, until CT head revealed edema to be stable.
