Her electrolytes were repleted daily PRN.
Her blood pressure was adequately controlled.
An ECG showed no acute changes from baseline.
Serial cardiac enzymes were drawn and were negative.
Endocrine: Blood sugars were managed with both a RISS and her home dose of Lantus qHS.
Her blood sugar tended to bottom out late afternoon but peaked during cycled tube feeding at night.
Electrolytes: She developed a mild hyperkalemia (without ECG changes) and mild hyponatremia.
Her hyponatremia was likely caused by mild dehydration - with an appropriate increase in ADH - even though she had adequate UO and no creatinine bump during her postoperative course.
It will be important to continue to trend her electrolytes while at rehab.
