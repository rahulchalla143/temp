[**5-21**]: Bilat LENI's: Negative .
Questionable left anterior cerebral artery 2-mm dilation versus, possibly a vessel loop for which a repeat MR angiography when patient's condition improves would be helpful for further evaluation to more conclusively exclude an aneurysm.
[**5-23**]: CT head: Tiny chronic right parietal subdural extra-axial fluid collection.
[**5-28**] CT sinus/mandible: Sphenoid sinusitis.
[**5-31**] MRI C and T spine c gadolinium: 1)  No abnormal epidural fluid collections or soft tissue density in the cervical and thoracic spine.
This T12 compression deformity was identified on a CT from [**2125-4-6**].
3)  Diffusely abnormal signal throughout the cervical and thoracic spine vertebral bodies that are consistent with diffuse metastatic disease.
Location is difficult to assess on a single-view chest radiograph, and this may represent an intra- or extra-pulmonary finding.
If persisent, CT would be recommended.
He underwent head CT, brain MR, lumbar puncture, and EEG monitoring.
Head CT showed sphenoid sinusitis.
MR showed a small chronic subdural fluid collection.
Lumbar punction and EEG were unremarkable.
He was initially treated empirically for meningitis, but the antimicrobials were discontinued as studies of the CSF, culture and HSV PCR, returned negative.
He continued to require multiple transfusions of pRBCs to maintain Hct > 25. .
4) Metastatic Prostate cancer: Repeat bone scan showed increasing metastatic disease.
He was bolused c NS without much improvement in urine output.
12) T12 compression fracture - with retropulsed bone fragments extending to and narrowing the spinal canal.
vit b12 and folate wnl on lab studies.
16) Cardiopulmonary arrest: On [**2126-6-8**], medical team called in for pulse of 18.
