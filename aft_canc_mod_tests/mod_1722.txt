This was followed up with a chest CT on [**2113-5-23**] which showed an increase in size.
When previous scans were reviewed, the nodule can be found as early as [**2106**].
A head MRI was negative for metastases, PFTs revealed an FVC of 1.82 (66%), FEV1 1.42 (72%), and DLCO 12.52 (71%).
She also underwent a PET/CT scan, which revealed FDG avidity in the left lower lobe nodule with a max SUV of 3.4.
The left thyroid lobe had a nodule measuring 2.6 cm which showed max SUV of 15.7.
Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.2, pulse 91, blood pressure 153/79, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 95% on room air and weight 196.8 pounds.
RESPIRATORY:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.
A postop CXR showed left sided volume loss but no air leak was noted from the chest tubes.
She was still noted to be hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 90-92% on 4-5L NC.
A repeat CXR showed that the lung had further reexpanded witha small left pleural effusion.
An ABG the morning of POD1 was 7.40/46/79/30/2 and her oxygen saturdation remained stable.
However, she failed to void after the catheter was removed and a bladder scan showed only 100cc of urine in the bladder after 8 hours.
A small fluid bolus was given over 2 hours and her urine output improved.
Her oxygen saturation did not improve and she was requiring bipap.
On POD3 a bronchoscopy was done showing minimal secretions and she was saturating well on 3-4L.
