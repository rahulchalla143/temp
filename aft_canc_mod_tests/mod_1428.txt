The patient was seen in the hematology/oncology clinic on [**2105-9-10**], where her platelet count was found to be 26,000 and her hematocrit was 23.
A magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a large subdural hematoma on the left side with positive mass effect, with a midline shift.
Her peripheral smear showed schistocytes, however, hematology/oncology felt that it was secondary to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and not secondary to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
In the unit, the patient was started on Decadron and was transfused to keep her platelet count above 100,000 and her hematocrit above 30.
Neurosurgery believed that the hematoma would resolve as long as her platelet count remained above 100,000.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission, the patient had a temperature of 98.3, pulse 78, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 129/72 and oxygen saturation 96% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact, anicteric sclerae.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 12, hematocrit 28.3, platelet count 84,000, fibrinogen 158, FTP 40 to 80, d-dimer greater than 2,000, prothrombin time 13.5, partial thromboplastin time 24.3, INR 1.2, sodium 133, potassium 4.3, chloride 101, bicarbonate 21, BUN 16, creatinine 0.5, glucose 154, alkaline phosphatase 2,190, calcium 8, phosphorous 2.7 and magnesium 2.1.
Repeat head CT on [**2105-9-12**] showed that the hematoma was unchanged in size.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient required multiple blood and platelet transfusions during the rest of her hospital stay to keep her platelet count above 100,000 and her hematocrit above 28.
On [**2105-9-18**], the patient had a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head, which revealed that the size of the hematoma was again unchanged in size.
She is to return to the bone marrow transplant unit on [**2105-9-22**] for a blood draw to monitor her hematocrit and platelet count.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed to return to Four South on [**2105-9-22**] for a blood draw to monitor her hematocrit and platelet count.
