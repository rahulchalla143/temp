She was found to have a markedly elevated bilirubin of 9.4 and an alk phos level of 492.
Amylase and lipase were 195 and 283.
There was concern that her JP output was slightly bilious however there was no other evidence of leak reported.
CT abdomen demonstrated the drain in the appropriate position with mild peripancreatic stranding.
Her OR pathology demonstrated infiltrating adenocarcinoma with positive margins, signet cells and extensive perineural and lymphovascular invasion.
A CEA level was 2.2. .

She also underwent an ERCP with successful metal stenting for malignant strictures of her common bile duct and common hepatic duct.
On [**11-3**] she had a HIDA which demonstrated no bile leak.
She was noted to be oliguric with a rise in her creatinine from 2.9 to 8.6.
Given her CMO status, the line was then pulled, the vancomycin stopped, and no further labs were drawn.
Hematocrit was subsequently stable.
After this her rate remained sinus in the 80s with a stable SBP in the 80s and 90s.
