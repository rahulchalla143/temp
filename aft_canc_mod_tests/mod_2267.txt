CXR [**2137-3-12**] my read A nearly 4 cm wide heart-shaped mass in the right lower lobe may have enlarged since it measured 32 mm in greatest diameter on the coronal projections of the [**Month (only) 404**] torso CT.
At the medial margin, the enhancement extends towards and abuts the falx, also likely postsurgical, however, residual tumor cannot be excluded, and attention on follow-up imaging is recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 32 yo F with a PMHx of metastatic melanoma who has failed multiple treatments with measurable disease in multiple places including the left occipital lobe who p/f clinic prior to a scheduled resection of left occipital lobe brain lesion with a leukocytosis and increased LDH of unknown origin .
CT head post op revealed no hemorrhage.
POst op MRI was performed which revealed good resection.She was encouraged to be OOB and started on SQH.
