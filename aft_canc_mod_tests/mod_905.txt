However, his respiratory status did not improve and was noted to have a low-grade temp of 100.9, RR 30, HR 140, BP 155/88, SaO2 94% on supplemental O2 (unknown amount), prompting the NH to send the patient to the ED early this morning.
In the ED, he was noted to have a Tc of 103.8 (rectally), HR 134, BP 124/74, RR 42, SaO2 88%/NRB.
His labs were notable for a WBC of 27.9 (97% N, no bands) and lactate of 2.
His sats improved while in the ED and he was weaned down to 4 L NC.
ABG on 4L was 7.49/34/82/31.

For further details, please consult the speech and swallow pathology note.
CT Head: CLINICAL INDICATION: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma with somnolence, assess for intracranial hemorrhage.
CT Chest: Multidetector CT of the chest was performed without intravenous or oral contrast administration.
There is bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy on both sides of midline, with the right paratracheal lymph node measuring up to 3.6 x 2.7 cm and a left prevascular node measuring up to 2.5 x 3.0 cm.
Fluid level within the intrathoracic trachea is probably due to retained secretions.
The largest individual nodule is a poorly defined lateral segment right middle lobe nodule measuring 10 mm on image 31 of series 3.
Bulky mediastinal and upper abdominal lymphadenopathy consistent with metastatic disease.
Dedicated contrast-enhanced CT torso could be considered to more completely characterize the extent of metastatic disease if warranted clinically.
Blood and Urine Cx negative but sputum did grow MRSA.
To sort out whether the patient simply had aspiration pnuemonitis vs PNA, a CT scan of the chest was obtained.
#Acute Renal Failure:  during his hosptial course, his Cr rose from a baseline of 0.3-0.4 to a peak of 2.2.
Urine indicies not c/w pre-renal state, Urine Eos neagtive.
Renal team consulted; felt to be secondary to ATN, most likely from vancomycin.
#Cerebral Mets:  on CT scan, there was noted to me marked vasogenic edmema.
#ONC issues/goals of care:  after the Left mainstem lesion was discovered, both interventional pulmonary team and radiation team were consulted.
She understood that should the patient develop subsequent respiratory distress, she should not be brought back to the hospital but should be given morphine and ativan for comfort.
#FEN:  the patient had speech/swallow evaluation which showed moderate-severe oropharyngeal dysphagia characterized by reduced bolus control and formation as well as a significant pharyngeal swallow initiation delay with mild silent aspiration of thin liquids.
