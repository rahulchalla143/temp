MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2116-7-19**]  The patient is status post left occipital tumor resection in the left cerebellar hemisphere, the expected surgical changes are visualized consistent with blood products and air in the surgical cavity, this lesion has been decreased in size since the prior study and the surgical bed is filling with blood products and CSF.

A post-op CT demonstrated post-operative changes with hyperintensity in the surgical bed likely surgical material and mild hemorrhage.
