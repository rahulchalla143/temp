Admission Date:  [**2113-8-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-9-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-5-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**] Chief Complaint: fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardial window and chest tube placement-[**2113-9-1**]   History of Present Illness: 46 year old man with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 and viral load of 30,000 on HARRT (Darunavir/Etravirine/Truvada and Raltegravir) through a clinical trial who presented to OSH with shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever.
His EKG showed PR depression in the inferior leads.
An echo which revealed pericardial effusion.
He continued to have symptoms and his TTE showed rapidly increasing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
He continued to spike temp to 102 and his HR also increased from 110s to 140s, sinus tachycardia.
His UOP decreased overnight and recieved 40 IV lasix at midnight and has put out >2.5 L to that.
Two siblings both healthy  Physical Exam: General: pleasant, in NAD, sitting up in bed, well developed, well nourished, following commands HEENT:PERRL, EOEMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM Neck: JVP 8 cm Cardiovascular: RRR, normal S1, S2 with rubs Chest wall: No sternal chest pain, drain in place Respiratory: decreased BS in right base.
2+ DP pulses palpable bilaterally  Pertinent Results: [**2113-8-31**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-8-31**], pericardial effusion may be slightly larger.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-9-1**], the pericardial effusion size has decreased.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-9-3**] , findings are similar.
CT Head IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Abdominal Ultrasound: 1.
Essentially unchanged in size and appearance compared to the prior CT study, allowing the difference of technique.
CT chest with and without contrast 1.
No pulmonary embolism to segmental level, although determination of the distal pulmonary arteries is not possible due to inadequate contrast opacification and respiratory motion artifact.V/Q scan may be useful if clinically indicated 2.
A right renal pyramid with the questionable appearance on the prior ultrasound is less prominent on today's exam and does appear consistent with the pyramid.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.
On admission he had chest pain and EKG changes consistent w/ pericarditis.
TTE was done which showed a small pericardial effusion.
Pericardial fluid culture and tissue pathology revealed MRSA.
A thorough workup, with the notable exception of a CT abd/pelvis with contrast (given acute renal failure), was performed.
# Sinus tachycardia and hypoxia:  On post-op day 2 patient developed sinus tachycardia to 140s and hypoxia sats to high 80s.
Not thought to be haveing significant reaccumilation of pericardial fluid as pt had TTE that showed small pericardial effusion.
He was continued on his current HAART therapy including his study meds.
# Anemia: Patient's hematocrit was 40.8 3 month.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for temperature >100.4.
We performed an extensive infectious workup including blood and urine cultures, imaging, and PCR/antibody tests which did not reveal any infectious sources, other than the MRSA that was found in the pericardial tissue/fluid.
We would like you to continue to monitor your vital signs (Heart rate, temperature, blood pressure) at least 3x/day at home for the next 7 days and then follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 977**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
We started you on Aspirin 81 mg daily  We also need you to follow up with nerphrology for evaluation of your kidney function, cardiology for a repeat ECHO in [**12-30**] months, and hematology for evaluation of potential bone marrow biopsy.
