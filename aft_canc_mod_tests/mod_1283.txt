# Gastrointestinal bleeding and acute blood loss anemia: The patient presented with melena and was found to have a Hct of 20.8 when he came into the ED.
The pt who takes warfarin had an intial INR of 3.2 and a low platelet count of 113.
The patient underwent EGD on [**3-12**] that showed a Dieulafoy lesion that was clipped.
Per the gastroenterology team, the patient underwent a colonoscpy to rule out a lower cause of GIB, as he had been off warfarin and had a subtherapeutic INR.
He underwent a colonoscopy on [**3-14**] which showed a polyp in the sigmoid colon (s/p piecemeal polypectomy) and a polyp in the rectum (which was biopsied).
His warfarin and lovenox were stopped, and he was given 1 unit of pRBCs.
He was monitored off anticoagulation, but continued to have BRBPR and underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy on [**3-18**].
The sigmoidoscopy showed the previously biposed friable polyp with a pinpoint ulcer with no stigmata of bleeding at the area of prior biopsy.
# Coronary artery disease s/p anterior MI in [**2187**]:  The patient had a recent intervention w/ DES to mid-LAD [**2200-1-16**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Given his blood pressures remained well controlled off Lisinopril, he was discharged off lisinopril with instructions to follow up with his PCP to discuss further blood pressure management.
Transitional Issues: - GI f/u for rectal biopsy results ([**Last Name (LF) 25402**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely need removal after off anti-coagulation) - f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], cardiologist, regarding reinitiation of anticoagulation for afib in 2 weeks (appointment in place) - f/u with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: re-initiation of Lisinopril which was stopped in the setting of GI bleed  Medications on Admission: - Plavix 75mg daily - lisinopril 10mg daily - nitroglycerin 0.4mg SL PRN - pantoprazole 20mg daily - propranolol - PRN symptomatic - rosuvastatin 10mg daily - tamsulosin 0.4mg daily - trazodone 150mg QHS - vernicline 1mg [**Hospital1 **] (started recently) - warfarin - 5mg one day a week, rest of week (6 days) 3.75mg daily.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to dieulafoy lesion Colonic and rectal polyp Lower gastrointestinal bleed secondary to polyp biopsy  Secondary Diagnosis: Coronary artery disease Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had a repeat colonoscopy which showed a small ulcer near the prior biopsy site, presumably where the bleeding was coming from.
