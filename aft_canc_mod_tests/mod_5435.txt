HPI: Patient is a 57 y/o woman with a PMH of DM type II, HTN, obesity and hyperlipidemia who presented to an OSH on [**9-16**] with complaints of 5 days of intractable vomiting and fatigue.
A RUQ US was done which showed no cholecystitis.
3 days after admission the patient c/o LLQ pain and had some diarrhea so a CT abdomen was obtained.
CT showed diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis with a complex cystic solid mass in the left adnexa measuring 12x6x7cm.
Patient then underwent CT-guided intraperitoneal biopsy which was consistent with Burkitts lymphoma.
At the OSH the patient's Cr was found to increase to 1.9 and her uric acid level was 18.
Creatinine fluctuated between 1.1-1.5 during OSH stay and then rose to 1.9 on the day of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
CXR [**9-30**] with clear lungs.
On the morning of [**10-1**] the patient became hypotensive to SBP in 80's responsive to fluid bolus.
ABG 7.40/41/101.
The decision was made to transfer patient to ICU for close monitoring in the setting of hypotension, anuria and hypoxic respiratory failure.
Family History: Sister died of a brain tumor, unknown type.
No other h/o malignancy  Physical Exam: VS: T 97 BP 98/48 P 70 RR 20 O2 sat 92% RA General: pale, well-nourished woman lying in bed, NAD HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, mucous membranes dry, no lesions in OP Neck: supple, no LAD CV: RRR, no m/r/g Chest: Mild crackles at bases, otherwise CTA Abdomen: Distended, firm but no rebound or guarding, no palpable masses, normoactive BS Ext: LE wrapped in ACE bandages, 2 small non-helaing ulcers on each lower leg.
Skin: Psoriatic lesions on b/l LE and upper extremities Neuro: AAO x3, moving all 4 extremities, non-focal   Pertinent Results: WBC 9.6 Plt 473 Hct 27.1 Na: 138 K: 4.4 Cl: 98 HCO3: 25 BUN: 51 Cr: 2.2 Ca 8.2 Phos: 4.9 Uric acid: 17.6 .
CT abdomen: Diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis with high attenuation throughout omentum, complex cystic solid mass in the left adnexal region, large area of extensive massive soft tissue metastatic tumor occupying a vast majority of the left side of the abdomen, encasing some bowel loops.
Immunoperoxidase studies performed at the outside hospital show the lymphoma to be positive for CD20 and CD79a; there is strong co-expression of CD10; the MIB-1 fraction is estimated at >90%; CD3 and CD5 stain scattered admixed T-cells.
A bcl-2 stain performed at our institution stains scattered smaller lymphocytes, and rare larger cells.
The above histologic and reported immunohistochemical findings are consistent with a high-grade non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Heme/onc (Lymphoma): The patient presented with large ovarian and omental masses and the OSH did a biopsy and felt the patient had Burkitt's lymphoma.
During her course her cytogenetics returned and she was c-myc negative and her biopsy was consistent with high-grade non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma.
Her blood counts were closely followed, and she did not require any interventions after her CHOP.
Her serial CXR's revealed LLL infltrate and pleural effusion, that remained stable, though on [**10-14**] her CXR revelaed new increased infiltrate/pulm edema on LUL.
In addition to the above measures as she was noted to have a persistent cough refractory to many anti-tussives, we stopped her lisinopril on [**2120-10-26**] and switched to valsartan.
She had an ex-lap/small bowel resection/left salpingo-oophorectomy ([**10-2**]).
She was found on CT abdomen to have a fluid collection in the pelvis, but this was likely related to her post-op state.
They did not feel she needed amiodorone and thought once her chemo is finished and her hemotocrit, coags and platelets are stabilized coumadin/anti-coagulation could be readdressed.
In addition to the above, the patient's ECHO showed depressed EF from > 55% to 45%, she was thought to have mild CHF, but she imporved with diuresis.
Her sugars were followed closely as she was transitioned to a PO diet and she remained better controlled on lantus, SSI and a diabetic diet.
Creatinine fluctuated between 1.1-1.5 during OSH stay and then rose to 1.9 on the day of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Please continue to have your glucose closely monitored and have your insulin regimen adjusted to maintain goal Hemoglobin A1C less than 7.
