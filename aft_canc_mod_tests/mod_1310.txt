Rigid Bronchoscopy 2.
Of note, he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**7-28**] with hemoptysis (two small episodes) for which he underwent bronchoscopic evaluation which demonstrated a likelihood of suspicious lesions in the right upper lobe and left superior lingula with no active bleeding.
He saw an otorhinolaryngologist who at that time reported that he had neck swelling which was contributing to his snoring and which was likely related to a thyroid process.
He was started on coumadin in [**1-28**] for a PE and in the summer of [**2159**], the patient had two episodes of hemoptysis during exertion, which required a bronchoscopic evaluation and ablation of the lesion.
He was subsequently admitted with hemoptysis and underwent a bronchoscopic evaluation and control of his bleeding.
PET scan evaluation revealed a significant increase in his disease burden, as well as multiple sites of uptake in the skeleton.
A Thyrogen scan did not reveal Iodine uptake.
He was admitted to the MICU for further work-up and management after rigid bronchoscopy.
Past Medical History: Metastatic Thyroid Ca HTN Atrial Fibrillation Pulmonary Embolus [**1-28**] - Anticoagulated with coumadin; has two small lesions on MRI head c/w mets but not contraindications  to anticoag.

PET [**11-28**]: IMPRESSION: Diffuse abnormal FDG uptake in the lungs and bone consistent with metastatic disease, which compared to prior exam shows slight increase in disease burden.
Pulmonary angiogram on [**2160-1-18**] showed no active extravasation but multiple hypervascular masses, likely metastases.
Hematocrit remained stable overnight, and he was hemodynamically stable without further episodes of hemoptysis.
He will need further oncologic options discussed as his health improves.
The patient underwent pulmonary angiogram [**2160-1-18**] which showed no active extravasation but was notable for multiple hypervascular masses, thought to likely represent metastases.
As his hematocrit remained stable and he was without further episodes of hemoptysis x 48 hours, he was transferred to OMED for consideration of chemotherapy.
CXR prelim read with slight increase in diffuse fluffy bilateral opacities but otherwise unchanged.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for close monitoring and consideration of repeat rigid bronchoscopy, which was ultimately not pursued (his more significant problem in the [**Name (NI) 153**] was [**Name (NI) 5509**] as below).
It was restarted on [**2160-1-19**] when he developed tachycardia with HR > 200.
His HR improved to the 130 - 140 BPM range with 25 mg IV of lopressor and 20 mg IV of diltiazem; atenolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] was then restarted.
# h/o PE: The pt was on lovenox as an out-patient, which was held on admission in the setting of the bleed.
In the latter part of his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay his pressure was stable, and he had not required further fluid bolus.
On POD [**3-26**] his Hgb was stable at 8.5.
