Hypotension: Pt was admitted with SBP in 80s - likely [**3-2**] to hypovolemia and also persistent effects of anti-hypertensive medications that she had taken prior to admission.
SBP improved to 110s on discharge.
However, FS dropped to 30 with insulin.
K 4.7 on discharge.
Presumed meningioma: Pt had CT head at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] after being lethargic (although FS 30 at the time due to treatment of hyperkalemia with insulin/D50).
She will have a CT head with and without contrast and CTA head done at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2106-11-25**] at 1pm at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and will see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in Neurosurgery for follow-up on [**2106-12-2**] at 2pm on the [**Location (un) **] of the [**Hospital **] Medical Building at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**].

Can be restarted as an outpatient as BP tolerates - would consider decreased dose (e.g.
PENDING RESULTS: Will need to follow up final results of blood cultures from [**11-16**] and [**11-17**].
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR on Monday, [**2106-11-22**] and forward to attention of primary care physician for management of anticoagulation.
Your blood pressure improved with intravenous fluids and holding of your blood pressure medications.
