She completed right groin radiation therapy in [**2113-5-20**] and began interferon in [**2113-6-20**], discontinued in [**2113-9-20**] when a breast mass biopsy confirmed melanoma.
Follow-up CT scan showed disease regression.
VITAL SIGNS: 97.2, 80, 18, 102/52.
CHEST:  Resonant to percussion and clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ADMISSION LABS:  WBC 6.9, hemoglobin 9.3, hematocrit 28.8, platelet count 483,000, INR 1, BUN 17, creatinine 0.6, sodium 139, potassium 4.5, chloride 106, CO2 of 28, glucose 88, ALT 11, AST 10, LDH 183, CK 24, alk phos 92, total bilirubin 0.5, albumin 3.6, calcium 8.5, phosphorus 3.4, magnesium 2.2.
Her admission weight was 58 kg and she received interleukin II 600,000 international units per kilogram equaling 34.8 million units IV q.8h.
On treatment day #2, she was hypotensive overnight with systolic blood pressures in the 70s with initial response to fluid boluses.
However, at 08:15 a.m. after her third dose of IL-2, her systolic blood pressure was noted to be 50 at which point she was placed on dopamine with titration upward to a maximum of 6 mcg per kilogram per minute.
Initially her blood pressure stabilized in the 80s, but she became more hypotensive over the next several hours requiring the addition of Neo-Synephrine with dosage titrated upwards to 3 mcg per kilogram per minute with systolic blood pressure still in the 70s.
Blood cultures were drawn and broad spectrum antibiotic coverage was initiated with vancomycin and cefepime.
Chest x-ray was checked and lungs were clear to rule out pneumonia.
Her blood cultures revealed no growth and her vancomycin and cefepime were discontinued.
We will plan to re-check CT scans to assess disease response to her second cycle of interleukin-2.
Lorazepam 0.5 to 1 mg q.4h.
FOLLOW-UP PLAN:  Ms. [**Known lastname 66801**] will return for CT scans in 4 weeks to assess disease response.
