He localized the pain to the right side of his chest and described it as a pressure in his chest which remained constant until he presented in the emergency room at the OSH.
EKG did not demonstrate significant changes.
He was stablized and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.

The left sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (LVEDP was 17mmHg).
The systemic artery pressures were within normal range measuring 133/67mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2), best seen on image 101.
[**2159-11-2**] Head CT Scan: 1.
[**2159-11-7**] Chest CT Scan: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted under cardiology and underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed severe multi-vessel coronary artery disease, left renal artery stenosis and moderate subclavian stenosis.
Prior to surgical intervention, extensive preoperative evaluation was performed given his multiple medical issues.
Preoperative echocardiogram notable for moderate aortic valve stenosis and moderate LV dysfunction with an LVEF of 40-45%.
At discharge, his BP was 100/60 with a HR of 72.
PULMONARY: Preoperative chest CT scan notable for a left lower lobe nodule.
PET scan showed abnormal FDG-avidity in the left lower lobe pulmonary nodule highly concerning for lung carcinoma.
RENAL: Admission creatinine was 2.2.
Renal ultrasound showed normal left kidney and an atrophic right kidney.
Creatinine throughout his hospital stay remained in the 1.4 - 2.2 range.
His discharge creatinine was ********.
NEURO: Given history of cerebrovascular disease, he underwent carotid ultrasound which showed moderate disease of his left internal carotid artery(see result section).
Preoperative head CT scan was notable for chronic right frontal cortex and right basal ganglia infarcts with associated right ventricular dilation and right temporal lobe encephalomalacia.
ID: Admitted with leukocytosis, white count 16K.
At discharge, white count was *****.
Blood sugars were well controlled regular insulin sliding scale.
