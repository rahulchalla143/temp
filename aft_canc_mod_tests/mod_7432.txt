Parietal Mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**6-27**]: Stereotactic brain biopsy   History of Present Illness: Patient transferred from OSH after head CT revealed new right parietal brain mass.

MRI Head [**6-23**]: FINDINGS: There is diffuse edema identified in the right parietooccipital region extending from the periatrial right region.
Given patient's history of lung cancer, metastasis should be considered, but the appearances are not typical.
CT Torso [**6-23**]: CT TORSO: Prior to administration of IV contrast, helical imaging was performed through the level of the abdomen.
Subsequently, after uneventful administration of 100 mL of Visipaque, helical imaging was performed from the thoracic inlet through the pubic symphysis.
Three-minute delayed imaging was performed at the level of the abdomen.
COMPARISON: CT chest [**2114-6-20**], CT abdomen [**2109-12-11**].
MRI abdomen, [**2108-4-10**].
CT ABDOMEN: The spleen appears normal apart from an incidentally noted splenule (3:59).
Stomach and abdominal loops of small and large bowel appear grossly normal.
CT PELVIS: The bladder is unremarkable.
Head CT [**6-27**](post-op) FINDINGS: There is a hyperdense 3 x 2.5 cm mass in the right cerebral hemisphere causing significant vasogenic edema and approximately 6 mm of leftward shift of the septum pellucidum, unchanged since [**6-22**], [**2113**].
Paranasal sinuses, ethmoid and mastoid air cells are clear.
[**7-10**] Head CT IMPRESSION: 1.
CT of the Torso was obtained and found to have stable disease in comparison to previous imaging.
Given that the patient is a left hand dominant person with a right sided lesion; functional MRI was performed on [**6-27**] prior to biopsy, should resection become determined course.
Preliminary pathology revealed a likely metastatic pathology.
Post operative scan which was performed within 4 hours revealed some bleeding in the operative bed with extension to the third and lateral ventricles.
On clinical exam patient was easily arrouseable, but had some left lower extremity weakness with planter flexion.
Given our concern for the development of hydrocephalus, the patient was sent for a repeat CT scan within two hours, which was not concerning for hydrocephalus.
An ABG revealed a poor PaO2 of 60%.
Patient underwent a CTA of the chest to rule out PE and a noncontrast CT. CTA was negative for PE, and the CT of the head was unchanged from a study done on [**7-6**].
The bilateral lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT.

-You will not need an MRI of the brain as this was done during your acute hospitalization  Also; please call Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] office(general oncology medicine) at [**0-0-**] to schedule a follow up appointment approximately 4wks after surgery.
