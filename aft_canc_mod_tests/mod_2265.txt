Echo [**2160-10-20**] The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-3-16**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is lower and the severity of mitral rgurgitation is slightly higher.
