A liver doppler ultrasound was performed showing patent flow in the left portal vein, left hepatic vein, and left hepatic  artery.
On POD 3 he was noted to have worsening encephalopathy and repeat liver doppler ultrasound was done showing new ascites.
Due to difficult anatomy, the thrombectomy could not be done, and an attempt was made by interventional radiology with TPA.
He had a portal venogram suggestive of acute expansile thrombus within the main portal vein.
On [**12-2**], focal contrast extravasation from the right portal vein stump into the region of the JP drain was seen.
Micafungin was started for moderate growth of yeast from a sputum specimen on [**12-7**].
Platelats dropped as low as 57 on [**12-6**], a HIT panel was sent which returned as positive.
Serotonin release assay was sent and reported as borderline positive.
WBC was elevated around POD 8 ([**12-5**]), although he remained afebrile.
All cultures remained negative except PD fluid was positive for VRE.
He had all serologies and baseline exams completed.
On [**12-28**] he was brought back to the OR for Abdominal washout, Tru-Cut biopsy of the liver, reclosure of Silastic abdominal closure.
He was unable to be closed and then on [**2196-1-2**] he was taken once again to the OR with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for exploratory laparotomy, drainage of subphrenic abscess, liver biopsy and Vicryl mesh closure which was attached to the fascia for closure of the intra-abdominal wall.
Liver biopsy results from [**12-28**] showed Zone three hepatocyte apoptosis/necrosis with focal drop-out, consistent with preservation/reperfusion injury.
White count noted to once again be 21.5 (it had normalized previously) and blood cultures from [**1-1**] came back positive for VRE.
Because of the previous peritoneal fluid VRE positive cultures the patient had been on daptomycin, had remained on the micafungin for the sputum yeast and had additionally been on Zosyn.
Blood cultures were checked daily and did not clear until [**1-16**].
Cultures showed sparse growth of enterococcus.
GI was consulted and performed an ERCP on [**1-8**].
Cholangiogram revealed a tight curve/loop in the mid common bile duct, with possible evidence of a subtle stricture just above this curve with mild upstream biliary dilation, An 8cm by 10Fr biliary stent was placed across the mid-CBD.
The bilirubin was 21.9 at the time of the ERCP.
A repeat ERCP was scheduled for [**3-2**].
On [**1-22**] thyroid function tests were sent (TSH 13, T4 3.0) , he was found to be hypothyroid and was started on Levoxyl.
TSH decreased to 8.8 on [**2-6**].
Intermittent HD was performed and on [**1-28**] had successful uncomplicated placement of a 15.5 French x 23 cm tip-to-cuff tunneled hemodialysis catheter via right internal jugular venous access with the tip of the catheter terminating in the right atrium ready for use.
The patient had a head CT which showed no evidence of acute intracranial pathological process.
ID followed throughout and recommended a 4-week course of therapy, which changed to tigecycline, from the day of the first negative blood culture for VRE ([**1-16**]) and an indefinite course of fluconazole given his many anastomoses and high likelihood of recurrence.
Multiple c diffs were sent (all negative) for multiple loose stools.
Prograf levels have been followed throughout with dosing based on levels.
