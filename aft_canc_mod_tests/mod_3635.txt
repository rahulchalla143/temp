He was sent for an MRI in the ED but was unable to tolerate the study due to too many secretions in his trach.
He has had an LP which showed 19 WBC w/ a lymphocytic predominance and 1 RBC.
His MRI from [**2187-1-17**] suggests an interval increase in ventricular size with possible transependymal CSF migration.
No neglect but + apraxia bilaterally  CN I: not tested II,III: pt does not cooperate with formal VF testing but does blink to threat bilaterally, pupils 4mm->2mm bilaterally, fundi normal III,IV,V: does not bed sclera fully in any direction but this is symmetrical and he denies diplopia.
Motor exam limited due to motor impersistence however he appears to have full strength with maximal impulse testing    Delt [**Hospital1 **] Tri WE FE Grip   C5   C6 C7  C6 C7 C8/T1 L 5- -------------------> R 5  ------------------->     IP Quad Hamst DF [**Last Name (un) 938**] PF   L2  L3  L4-S1 L4 L5  S1/S2 L 5- -------------------> R 5  ------------------->    Reflex: No clonus   [**Hospital1 **] Tri  Bra  Pat An Plantar   C5 C7   C6   L4  S1 CST L 1-------------   0  Flexor R 1-------------   0  Flexor  -Sensory: unreliable, no deficits pinprick, but cold sensation, vibratory sense, proprioception are extremely inconsistent.

MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM [**2187-1-17**] Comparison is made with [**2186-11-25**].
[**2187-1-20**] MRI BRAIN with CSF FLOW STUDY: IMPRESSION: Flow is noted in the third ventricle, aqueduct, and enlarged fourth ventricle as well as at the 3rd ventriculostomy.
12/29/08Lumbar puncture: Openning pressure of 21.5, no evidence of infection.
His neurologic exam on admission revealed marked encephalopathy, characterized by lack of orientation and inattention but no paraphasic errors, dysarthria or difficulty naming.
Given unclear precipitation for his seizure (brain stem tumor is not epileptogenic), he underwent LP which showed pleocytosis (WBC 19~52) with lymphocytic predominance.
His MRI from [**1-17**] suggests an interval increase in ventricular size with possible transependymal CSF migration.
A repeat MRI with CSF PULSE SEQUENCE FLOW to assess the patency of the third ventriculostomy and CSF flow in general was obtained, this showed patent flow through the ventriculostomy.
MR head on [**1-17**] showed ventricular dilatation and a VP shunt was placed on [**1-26**].
A follow up CT scan was unremarkable.
A video swallow study on [**2187-1-24**] showed aspiration of nearly everything and patient was kept NPO with tube feeds via PEG.
# Acute renal failure: Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed ARF with Cr bumping up to 2.6 likely due to acyclovir +/- vancomycin given FENa 5%.
Following PEG placement pt complained of abdominal pain and CT was done which was not indicative of acute issues but patient did have bilateral free air likely due to insufflation during PEG replacement.
# Tracheostomy:  On HD#7, he also removed his own trach but because he had good cough reflex without respiratory distress, his trach was not replaced.
Repeat CXRs were improved.
A Pre-operative U/A showed 11 WBC and patient spiked fever to 100.7 and so treated with Bactrim for 7 days, ending the day of discharge.
Hematocrit remained stable.
Again failed VIDEO SWALLOW STUDY on [**2187-1-24**] -> needs to remain NPO.
Olanzapine 5 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve [**Age over 90 **]: One (1) Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)).
Alum-Mag Hydroxide-Simeth 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed.
Upon arrival, you were further evaluated including lumbar pucture and imaging.
An MRI of your brain and a spinal tap showed increased pressure in and around your brain.
A follow up CT was within normal limits.
RADIOLOGY MRI Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 327**] Date/Time:[**2187-2-5**] 1:55  Please follow up with your PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 2~4 weeks of discharge from rehab facility.
You should also follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 3 weeks and have head CT at that time.
The head CT will be done on the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] [**Location (un) 470**] at 3PM on [**3-1**].
