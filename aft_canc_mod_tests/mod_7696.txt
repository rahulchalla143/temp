However, because of his progression on CT scan, the Taxol was discontinued on [**2106-4-12**].
At that time, a renal ultrasound revealed mild left hydronephrosis.
The patient was given intravenous fluids and his creatinine decreased from a peak of 3.4 to a level of 1.8 at discharge.
His family phone in and he was transported to [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department where, on arrival, his blood pressure was 68/43.
His initial labs are significant for a total bicarbonate of 11 with an anion gap of 23, BUN of 52 and creatinine of 2.9.
A blood gas at that time revealed a pH of 7.24, pCO2 of 22 and pAO2 of 104.
The patient received three ampules of bicarbonate as well as three amps of D5W with a change in his blood gas to 7.28, 29, 80.
A CT scan of the head was negative for acute intracranial process.
Chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine of 1.2 to 1.5.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit his temperature was 95.6 F.; heart rate 95; blood pressure 107/56; saturation of 99% on room air.
LABORATORY:  On admission, CBC revealed a white count of 12.4 with 75% neutrophils, 0% bands, and 20% lymphocytes.
Hematocrit was 36.1 with an MCV of 82.
Platelet count was 402.
Sodium was 135, potassium 5.3, chloride 102, bicarbonate 12, BUN 48, creatinine 2.3, glucose of 95.
The anion gap was 21.
Calcium was 10.
Magnesium 1.6, phosphorus 6.8.
INR was 1.3.
Liver function tests were within normal limits except for an elevated alkaline phosphatase at 435, amylase was 76 and lipase was 52.
Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.020 with nitrites positive, 3 to 5 white blood cells, moderate bacteria.
Renal ultrasound showed a stable left mild hydronephrosis and right lower pole mass.
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of heart failure or pneumonia, but was positive for a small right pleural effusion.
CT scan of the head showed no hemorrhage, lesions, hydrocephalus.
HYPOTENSION:  The patient's initial hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 60s on arrival to the Emergency Department, was felt to likely be secondary to hypovolemia given the patient's recent history of decreased p.o.
In addition, a cosyntropin stim test was done which was positive.
His creatinine on the day of discharge is 1.7 which is essentially at his baseline.
As previously stated, a repeat renal ultrasound was done which showed stable mild hydronephrosis.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:   The patient has very poor p.o.
RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION:  Chest x-ray from [**2106-4-9**], showed bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with associated compressive atelectasis on the right side.
The patient maintained good room air saturations throughout this admission and there was no evidence of respiratory compromise.
