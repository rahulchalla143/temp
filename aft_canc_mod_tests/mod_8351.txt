Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-1-23**], the findings are similar, although regionality of LV dysfunction is less apparent on today study - LV systolic dysfunction now looks global.
CXR [**3-15**]: As compared to the previous examination, the right-sided pulmonary opacities appear less dense but more widespread than on the previous examination.
Brief MICU course: The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, which appeared to be subacute process over several days.
Symptoms were thought to be related to fluid overload given that the patient missed dialysis on day of admission and CXR was most consistent with pulmonary edema.
ACS was not felt to be likely as EKG and cardiac enzymes were stable (althouh CE were elevated [**1-6**] renal insufficiency).
When his repeat blood cultures failed to grow any bug, the coag negative staph was thought to be a contaminant.
He was switched to levofloxacin because of concern for pneumonia, but urine cultures (patient makes a minimal amount of urine daily) ended up growing E coli and vancomycin resistant enterococcus.
Given that his BP was well-controlled without nifedipine, his nifedipine was stopped.
A PTH related peptide was sent and results were pending at the time of discharge.
His INR should be monitored closely.
Hct remained at baseline of 28-30 with no evidence of bleeding.
The patient and his spouse understand that he has the option to pursue care with hospice if he changes his code status.

You were given dialysis and the extra fluid was removed.
