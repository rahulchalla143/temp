On the day of admission, VNA noticed an abscess on the left leg and sent patient to the Emergency Room, where he was found to be afebrile, but hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 95.
Head CT [**3-13**] showed new bleed around temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle and at tip of the inferior right temporal lobe.
[**2166-3-24**] he had a MRI for infertility.
Intracranial hemorrhage:  Repeat CT on [**3-14**] showed no change from the previous day.
The goal is to keep the systolic blood pressure less than 140.
Hematocrit dropped from 33 to 30 during this admission, which is felt to be insignificant.
Hypotension:  Patient was hypotensive on admission, but quickly responded to fluid challenge and blood pressure has since been greater than 100 systolic.
Also Inderal was held on admission, and has not been restarted as blood pressure has been less than 120 throughout admission.
Blood pressure is still borderline low, so Inderal was discontinued altogether.
Chest x-ray on admission was clear, but repeat chest x-ray two days later showed a small bilateral pleural effusion with a questionable infiltrate in the left lower lobe.
He is also to have a followup MRI on [**3-21**].
