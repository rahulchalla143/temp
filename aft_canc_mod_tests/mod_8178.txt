At [**Hospital1 34**], CT head, CT spine, and CXR were negative.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED VS 98, BP 140/98, HR 70, RR 19, Sat 98%2L.
Repeat CT head without new pathology.
He was noted to have a HR of 30 but this was false, it was related to PVCs in a bigemy pattern which would lead to a peripheral pulse or pulse oximeter recording a pulse of 30, but an EKG revealed a rate of 60."

CT HEAD [**4-9**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CXR [**4-9**]: One portable view.
Comparison is made with the previous study of [**2106-2-14**].
TTE [**2106-4-12**]: The left atrium is dilated.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study ([**Month/Day/Year **] echo - limited images reviewed) of [**2106-2-18**], the above mentioned wall motion abnormalities were present in a milder form on the prior echo.
Compared to the transthoracic echo of [**4-12**]/9, the anterior wall motion looks normal and the inferior wall is less hypokinetic.
In the ICU he initially required pressors, and his blood cultures became positive for [**Last Name (LF) 8974**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] his antibiotic coverage was changed to nafcillin.
Blood cultures then became positive in [**2-18**] bottles for [**Date Range 8974**].
Hand surgery was consulted for evaluation of the septic thrombophlebitis of his hand, an ultrasound was done that showed only superficial involvement, and they recommended conservative management.
His coumadin was stopped and his INR reversed in anticipation of his EP study, then his coumadin continued to be held through his ICU course, his coumadin was restarted prior to discharge.
Metoprolol was restarted as his blood pressure tolerated.
# Thrombocytopenia: During his course in the MICU, the patient's platelets gradually trended down to a nadir of 66 from an admission level of 141.
A HIT antibody was sent that was negative, and he clinically improved his platelet count increased and had returned to the normal range by the time of discharge.
