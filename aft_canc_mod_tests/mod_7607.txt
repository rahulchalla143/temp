Gastrointestinal bleeding in the large bowel is unable to be assessed on this examination secondary to recent oral contrast administration from CT examination performed at an outside hospital.

Colonoscopy ([**10-29**]): Findings: Flat Lesions - A single small angioectasia with stigmata of recent bleeding was seen in the 60 cm.
A single sessile 5 mm non-bleeding polyp of benign appearance was found in the rectum.
CTA Chest ([**10-30**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Extensive mediastinal, subcarinal, and contralateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
Possible early aspiration has occurred in the left lower lobe with bronchial wall thickening that appears similar to the CT study performed two days prior.
CXR ([**11-1**]): IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-26**]: Large right hydropneumothorax is new since [**10-26**], including substantial volume of right pleural fluid.
CXR ([**11-1**]): IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 7:01 p.m.: Moderate-sized right hydropneumothorax is still substantial, only mildly smaller following the insertion of a small-bore catheter in the right upper hemithorax.

An angiogram was unsuccessful in localizing a bleed, as PO contrast from a prior study at the OSH obscured the study.
After remaining with stable Hct and blood pressure in the ICU, the pt was transferred to the medical floor.
She then completed a bowel prep and underwent a colonoscopy on [**10-29**], which showed a single AVM with evidence of recent bleed, which was cauterized.
Given the size of the effusion, rate of accumulation and her oxygen requirement, Interventional Pulm was consulted to perform a thoracentesis.
Although her outpatient imaging studies had already previously shown the effusion, and was presumed to be a malignant effusion, no prior diagnostic thoracentesis had been performed.
A bedside thoracentesis was attempted by IP on [**11-1**], however, the patient developed a moderate sized pneumothorax and an anterior chest tube was placed at the bedside, with follow-up CXR showing good resolution of both the effusion and pneumothorax.
Pleural fluid analysis revealed an elevated LDH consistent with an exudate.
Pleural fluid cytology is pending at this time and showed atypical cells, but not malignant cells.
CTA showed no evidence of PE.
Called outpatient PCP and Oncologist offices, pt's baseline HR at previous office visits for the past year have ranged in the low 100's to 110's.
# Oral thrush: pt was noted to have some oral thrush on exam on [**11-2**] and started on Nystatin.
KUB on [**2181-11-8**] showed no obstruction or ileus.
During this hospitalization, you were transfused red blood cells and underwent a colonoscopy for your GI bleed.
A source of bleed was identified, and the bleeding was stopped by cautery.
You were also noted to have lots of fluid around your right lung, so you underwent a drainage of the fluid, which was complicated by partial collapse of the right lung, so a chest tube had to be placed.
