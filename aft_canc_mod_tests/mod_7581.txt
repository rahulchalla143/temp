ACTIVE PROBLEMS  # Pain control/nausea/anxiety/agitation/palliation - Patient with chronic abdominal pain, acutely worsened with cholangitis.
The palliative care service recommended palliative sedation, which was consistent with the patient's wishes.
Of note, cholangiogram during procedure revealed high grade obstruction of the distal CBD.
On the morning of [**11-9**] she re-developed fever and blood pressures began to drop to 90'/50's initially unresponsive to IVF bolus on the floor necessitating transfer to the MICU.
Microbiology cultures of blood, urine, and bile were notable for ampicillin-resistant enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin.
Repeat PTCA showed occlusion of stent.
Fluoroscopic and gastrograffin studies of the J-tube revealed functioning, but retroverted positioning of J-tube.
Further evaluation of J-tube revealed anterograde, funtioning tube.
PICC was replaced on [**11-14**] following >72 hours of negative blood cultures and TPN was resumed on [**11-15**].
Lymph nodes and omental margins were positive, but duodenal and gastric margins were negative.
Normocytic anemia, likely ACD, however had iron studies which were normal.
