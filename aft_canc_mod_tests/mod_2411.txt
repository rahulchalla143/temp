Incomplete evaluation of the intracranial arterial vasculature demonstrates no evidence of high-grade stenosis, aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformation.
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2155-3-15**].
The above-described findings might obscure infection and if clinically warranted further evaluation with chest CT might be considered.
TTE [**2155-2-27**]:The left atrium is normal in size.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-2-6**], the heart rate is now normal and LVEF is normal.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**2-/2155**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Heterogeneous signal and enhancement with associated mass effect within the right frontotemporal lobe -partly characterized on the recent CT scan and outside neck MRI from [**Month (only) **].
A hemorrhagic focus, cavernoma are likely; metastatic or infectious lesion remains possible despite the lack of solid enhancement, however less likely.
mastoid air cell disease bilaterally with air-fluid levels as well as partial visualization of the post-surgical changes within the right face.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
ABG at admission showed him to be in similar range as previously.
Due to jaw reconstruction and radiation changes, he had to be nasally intubated.
However, CXR more c/w bibasilar collapse with bilateral pleural effusions.
Similar findings had been partially visualized on a sinus CT in [**7-16**].
LP had 7 WBC but normal protein and glucose, less concerning for bacterial meningitis.
Patient was initially treated empirically with acyclovir and ampicillin until HSV PCR was negative and final cx ruled out Listeria.
Patient was asymptomatic with rates 150-160s.
Patient was transitioned to PO dilt as well as metoprolol was rate controlled with HRs 80s-110s.
Urine lytes were c/w pre-renal picture, however Cr continued to rise after diuresis was halted and he was felt to have ATN.
Vanco level was also found to be elevated at 94 which may have led to nephrotoxicity as well.
