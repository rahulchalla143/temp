This pregnancy was complicated by a diagnosis at 25 weeks gestation during an ultrasound of a pelvic mass in the fetus.
Further assessment at [**Hospital1 18**] with ultrasound and fetal MRI revealed pelvic lesions most consistent with sacrococcygeal teratoma, that was most pelvic in location with a combination of solid and mostly cystic components.
Blood supply was felt to not be robust.
The parents met with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 64492**] who presented the plan for assessment after delivery including further MRI imaging to plan the surgical approach for removal of the tumor.
The infant emerged vigorous with Apgars of 8 and 9 and the baby was transferred to the NICU for further assessment and treatment.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission showed an alert, appropriate for gestational age size 36 week gestation infant.
Weight 2725 grams which is 50th percentile, length 47 cm which is 50th percentile, head circumference 33 cm which is 50th percentile.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Intravenous fluids     were initiated on admission to the NICU.
Her most recent set of electrolytes was a sodium     of 144; potassium of 4.4, chloride 110; carbon dioxide of     23 on [**2163-4-13**].
Her most recent weight was 2600 grams on     day of life 3, [**2163-4-12**].
Gastrointestinal:  Due to the diagnosis of sacrococcygeal     teratoma, an abdominal ultrasound was done on [**2163-4-9**]     which showed bilateral hydronephrosis with more     hydronephrosis on the right versus the left and a     probable hydroureter.
A MRI was performed at [**Hospital3 1810**] on     [**2163-4-11**] to evaluate the sacrococcygeal teratoma.
An AFP     was sent on the infant and the AFP result was 1,772,400.
The hematocrit at birth was 42.8 with platelet     count of 353.
Infectious disease:  CBC and blood culture were screened     on admission due to the preterm labor at 36 and 2/7 weeks     gestation.
The CBC was benign with a white blood cell     count of 9,000, 32 polys and 0 bands.
The blood culture     remained negative.
A state newborn screen was sent on [**2163-4-12**].
