A swab from this wound grew out Group A beta hemolytic strep, and he was started on Vancomycin and Penicillin G IV.
He had several plain films and a CT scan of the leg to evaluate for necrotizing fasciitis, which were negative per report.
His blood cultures were positive for group A strep and his encephalopathy continued to worsen; surgery was concerned for osteomyelitis, but did not want to operate.
An NGT was placed to administer lactulose.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further work-up of his encephalopathy as well as for concern of impending sepsis given his positive blood cultures, altered mental status, poor urine output and oxygen requirement.
Cirrhosis w/u included abdominal ultrasound in [**2121-6-30**] that revealed no focal liver lesions or ductal dilation.
-Chronic thrombocytopenia -Hypersplenism -Cellulitis [**2119**] -h/o group A strep bacteremia -MVA [**2101**], surgery to R leg, multiple fractures to left leg  Social History: Social History: Denies IVDU or cocaine.
[**Hospital1 18**] films: CXR [**12-31**] (prior to discharge): Successful left PICC placement.
Liver U/S ([**12-28**]): CONCLUSION: Normal-appearing liver transplant Doppler study  Brief Hospital Course: #Sepsis - Patient was initially transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of his group A sepsis in the setting of severe liver disease.
While on these antibiotics his WBC count continued to increase.
On discharge, WBC was 3.8. .
A bone scan was done to evaluate for osteomyelitis which was negative, although the patient has exposed bone after the surgical procedure.
#ARF - Patient developed acute renal failure that presumably resulted from a combination of contrast nephropathy and hepatorenal syndrome.
On discharge, Cr was 1.5. .
#Anemia - Likely from chronic disease, although stools were guiac positive with small amounts of bright red blood observable.
Previous EGD with known varices s/p banding and portal gastropathy in [**5-29**], colonoscopy in [**2120**] with diverticulosis.
Iron studies consistent with acute inflammatory state.
The patient will likely need a repeat colonoscopy and EGD.
Liver enzymes trended down and he was noted to diurese well by POD#8.
