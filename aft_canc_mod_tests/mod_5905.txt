Her initial EKG showed ST elevations in V4 and the lateral leads.
Cardiac enzymes were within normal range.
Her cardiac catheterization demonstrated 10% occlusion of the right coronary artery, 20% occlusion of proximal LAD, 60% occlusion of mid LAD with possible dissection and residual unstable plaque, and a small fistula between the left circumflex and left atrium.
An echocardiogram demonstrated an EF of 25-30%, moderately dilated left atrium, severe mitral annular calcification with 1+ MR, 1+ TR, left ventricular hypertrophy to akinesis with some basal preservation of function, trace AR, and small pericardial effusion.
Her initial cardiac pressures were right atrium 5, right ventricle 35/1, PA 30/15, wedge 13, left ventricle 115/83.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization which was complicated by a right bundle branch block, probably secondary to placement of a PA catheter.
Her last bone marrow biopsy in [**2130-6-27**] showed 13% plasma cells.
Anemia:  The patient had a negative anemic workup in [**2130-5-28**].
She receives Procrit every two weeks to q. month depending on her hematocrit level.
Avandia 4 mg. 11.
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile, heart rate 82, blood pressure 130/68.
There was 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial bilaterally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The EKG pre catheterization revealed normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation, normal intervals, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in leads I and aVL, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depression inferiorly with poor R wave progression.
Post catheterization EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm at 86, left axis deviation, QRS at 126, left anterior fascicular block, T wave inversion in V1 through V5, II, and aVL, resolution of ST changes.
SVR [**2145**].
A few days after cardiac catheterization, she was started on an ACE inhibitor, however, the next morning her creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 1.6 and, therefore, the ACE inhibitor was discontinued.
The plan is for the patient to be restarted on an ACE inhibitor as an outpatient and see if her creatinine is effected.
The patient had a cholesterol panel, triglyceride elevated at 160, HDL 41, LDL 57, and cholesterol of 130.
In addition, the patient had baseline LFTs prior to starting statin that showed an ALT of 32, AST 53 (likely elevated from cardiac injury), alkaline phosphatase 103, and total bilirubin 0.6, within normal limits except for the elevated AST.
She will most likely need a repeat echocardiogram within a month or two to evaluate for function.
In the setting of multiple myeloma, the diagnosis of cardiac amyloid was entertained, however, multiple myeloma is extremely indolent according to her oncologist, unlikely to be associated with amyloid.
In addition, her echocardiogram did not show evidence of amyloid infiltrate.
As her creatinine trended down, an ACE inhibitor was started.
The day after the ACE inhibitor was started, her creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 1.6.
She was slightly volume overloaded on examination and, therefore, was diuresed.
Low ejection fraction 25%.
As an outpatient, she will be started on an ACE inhibitor as her creatinine tolerates and at that time, Imdur and hydralazine will be discontinued.
