Comparison is made with prior study performed 5 hours earlier.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Interventional pulmonary consulted and a thoracentesis performed.
A chest ultrasound also revealed left pleural effusion which was planned for another thoracentesis on the next hospital day.
Urinalysis and urine chemistries sent and pending.
EKG did not show any changes.
There was concern for pericardial effusion so STAT bedside ECHO was performed.
The patient's blood pressure initially improved with IV fluids, however on the evening of [**7-24**] the patient became anxious from a sensation of shortness of breath.
An ABG was performed which was re-assuring, showing a chronic respiratory alkalosis.
Attempts to get arterial access for blood pressure monitoring was unsuccessful, and the family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and called to the bedside.
