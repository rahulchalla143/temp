[**8-31**] RLE Duplex: FINDINGS: There is normal color Doppler signal, pulse Doppler waveform, compressibility, and augmentation within the veins of the left lower extremity, including the left common femoral, left superficial femoral, and left popliteal veins.
[**9-2**] CT A/P: 1.
[**9-5**] CT P: CT-guided needle placement in the right hip yielded no fluid; the hypodense area seen on the CT scan therefore likely represents organizing granulation tissue or phlegmon rather than a loculated fluid collection.
Osteomyelitis - Upon presentation, the patient had several decubiti that could be probed to the bone.
All antibiotics were stopped for approximately 2 days after an area of possible fluid collection was located in the patient's right hip.
There was discussion as to the potential benefit of bone biopsy if the patient continued to spike but the patient was resistent to this idea due to her protracted and complicated course.
They did not believe that she needed an MRI to assess for osteomyelitis, given presumed diagnosis as they were able to probe to bone.
She should follow up with him once her acute issues are under better control.
Lowest HCT was 22.4, however patient declined transfusions given that she is a Jehova's witness.
She was supplemented with iron, folate, and a multivitamin with stable hematocrit around 25.
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**1-19**] Sprays Nasal TID (3 times a day) as needed for congestion .

Septic shock 2.
Thrombocytosis 6.
Anemia with presumed beta-thalassemia trait   Discharge Condition: good, vital signs have been stable, afebrile for the last 7 days, eating, drinking without complaint.
Also, patient ambulates via wheel chair and has several decubitis ulcers and heel wounds which need constant attention and dressing as outlined in the discharge instructions.
A guardianship process was commenced, and your sister was formally appointed your guardian.
