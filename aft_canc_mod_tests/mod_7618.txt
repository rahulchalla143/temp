Her saturations were 92 percent on room air, 100 percent on non rebreather, heart rate was 132.
Work-up revealed a hematocrit of 15 with guaiac positive stools.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 100.7 temperature; heart rate of 116; blood pressure 117/54; oxygenating 93 percent on two liters.
Lungs: Rhonchorus breath sounds and crackles two-thirds of the way up bilaterally.
Breath sounds decreased at the left base.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count of 2.3; hematocrit of 15.6; platelets of 87; INR of 1.3; PT 14.3; PTT 34.1.
Sodium of 140; potassium of 4.0; chloride 104; bicarbonate of 22; BUN 13; creatinine .8; glucose of 135.
Urinalysis showed positive nitrates, negative blood, negative leukocytes, 0 to 2 red blood cells, 11 to 20 white blood count, few bacteria.
Lactate was .08.
Chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure, a left pleural effusion.
Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 140.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 15 and positive guaiac stools; hence, the patient was transferred to the medical Intensive Care Unit for further and close monitoring.
She responded appropriately to the five units of packed red blood cells and gastroenterology was consulted for further work-up of her gastrointestinal bleed.
She had a nasogastric tube lavage which was negative for an upper gastrointestinal source of the bleed.
The patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which was remarkable for mild erythema in the antrum.
She had a colonoscopy which was only remarkable for grade II internal hemorrhoids.
Her chest x-ray showed pulmonary congestion.
An echo was done to further evaluate her congestive heart failure.
Her left ventricle was noted to have an ejection fraction of 50 percent.
A CTA was done to rule out a pulmonary embolism and it was negative and did not show any evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Anemia:  We followed her hematocrit on a daily basis and it continued to decline.
Her anemia was worked up and was noted to be multi-factorial.
Her platelet counts, while in house remained stable; however, her hematocrit had continued to decline despite five units of blood transfusion.
She may need further blood transfusions.
No further work-up was done while in house.
Cytology was sent and laboratory chemistries were sent.
Her cytology will be followed up as an outpatient by her primary care physician.
Bony sclerotic lesions:  Bony sclerotic lesions were noted on a CT scan which are presumably from her myelodysplastic syndrome.
A U-pep and S-pep were sent which are still pending prior to discharge.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  She was placed on two gram sodium, cardiac healthy diet.
Electrolytes were checked on a continuous basis and replete as needed.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable but with decreasing hematocrit and otherwise negative gastrointestinal work-up, presumably secondary to her MDS.
She is to have her pleural effusion cytology, serum protein electrophoresis followed up by her primary care physician.
