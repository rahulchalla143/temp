She was admitted on [**2131-1-11**] for allogenic stem cell transplant per protocol DF05-279 and her conditioning regimen consisted of photophoresis, pentostatin, and TBI.
Cytogenetics-->Initial bone marrow showed deletion 7 associated with a poor prognosis.
However, repeat cytogenetics performed on [**2130-12-28**] at [**Hospital1 18**] show no such deletion.
Flow--> CD34-positive blasts are estimated at 5-6% Biopsy/Aspirate-->From [**2130-12-28**]: The blast count on the aspirate is 6%, and by CD34-immunostains is 6-10%, consistent with a diagnosis of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB-1) by WHO criteria.
The patient's chimerism showed 99% donor.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: .MDS - see history above .Mitral regurgitation - Echo in [**12-6**] showed: Mitral valve prolapse.
Physical Exam: VS: 98.1 93% 4L, RR 16, HR 126 BP 103/78 on levophed 0.3 Gen: pale, elderly, NAD.
[**2131-9-12**]: 1) Cholelithiasis without definitive evidence of acute cholecystitis.
8/340 ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
CXR [**9-1**]: relatively clear fields.
Colon bx [**5-7**]: GVHD CMV Viral Load: CMV was not detected on [**6-25**], but on [**6-29**] was 22,100 copies/ml.
MICRO: blood cx this admit NGTD [**2131-8-6**] wound cx: pseudomonas C diff neg x3 since [**8-20**] [**7-12**] urine w pseudomonas (cipro, tobra, gent res) and e coli   Brief Hospital Course: 62 year old female w/ allo SCT +>200 days, hx recent CMV infection and GVHD diarrhea admitted for worsening diarrhea.
CT scan of the left leg revealed extensive muscle edema but no clear evidence of necrotising fasciitis but it was unclear what type of inflammatory response the patient would mount given her neutropenia.
Blood and urine cultures were negative.
CXR at that time showed no evidence of infiltrate.
Renal Failure: During her MICU course the patient developed acute renal failure with her creatinine increasing from a baseline of 0.4 to a peak of 1.3.
Urine electrolytes were not consistent with a prerenal etiology and her urine output was not responsive to fluid boluses.
Her urine sediment had many granular casts.
CT of the chest did not reveal a clear fungal pneumonia.
She underwent MRI of the brain which showed an air fluid level in the sphenoid sinuses.
She underwent debridement of her nasal septum and turbinate on [**9-20**] and pathology results showed evidence of angioinvasive fungal infection.
She was treated initially with posiconazole and ambisome with close monitoring of her liver and kidney function.
Her beta-glucan and galactomanan levels were consistently monitored for signs of decreasing infection.
Chest CT showed bilateral pleural effusions but no clear evidence of infection.
Sputum cultures revealed aspergillus in two samples (non fumagatus/[**Country 11730**]/flavus species).
She underwent colonoscopy which showed granularity consistent with GVHD.
She did have evidence of CMV reactivation but CMV cultures from the colon were negative.
Stool cultures and clostridium difficile toxins were negative as well.
She also received one dose of IVIG when her IgG levels were found to be low.
DIC labs negative on multiple occassions.
She was found to have a decreased reticulocyte count and an elevated ferritin consistent with an inflammatory anemia.
She underwent TTE which was inconclusive for fungal endocarditis.
She had a repeat MRI on [**9-23**] which was limited secondary to motion, but ultimately read by Neuroradiology as no progression.
No further imaging was obtained, and she was never alert enough to perform a meaningful neurological exam.
EKG with no other significant changes.
Elevated INR/Elevated total bilirubin:  Throughout her MICU course the patient has had fluctuating liver function tests, INR and total bilrubin.
Multiple RUQ ultrasounds have been negative for cholecystitis and portal venous thrombosis.
Her LFTs and Tbili continued to rise, concerning for worsening GVHD, so her steroids were increased.
Viral load trended up from 2960 to 49,000 and finally started trending down when started on higher induction doses of gancyclovir dosed for her creatinine clearance.
Her last chimerism showed 100% engraftment.
DVT: CT of lower extremities from [**9-1**] shows bilateral DVTs.
