CT Torso [**5-1**]: 1.
CTA [**5-2**]: Right frontal mass, which appears to have a few tiny vessels within the substance of the lesion, but the majority of the anterior cerebral artery branches lie along the surface of the mass.
Bone Scan [**5-3**]: No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
An MRI was done which showed a complex solid and cystic mass within the region of the right frontal lobe.
Over the following days, she was evaluated by CT and Bone scan for other possible primary tumors but these results were negative.
On discharge, her neurological exam was only remarkable for a L lateral rectus palsy.
