She had a repeat CT scan on HD14 which revealed perinephric abscess.
Urology was made aware of her condition, but did not want to intervene further until her abscess improved.
A repeat CT scan was done on HD21.
Although the imaging revealed a resolved abscess, her drain was still putting out 20-40ml of fluid/day.
Her vancomycin was stopped because she did not grow out MRSA and her meropenem was changed to ertapenem for ease of dosing.
After that day she will have a repeat scan of her kidney to make sure the fluid did not re-accumulate.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] note, she has an aversion to all of the CT scans and IR Fellow [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] pgr[**Pager number 98787**] will protocol her scan to just the kidney rather than a full abdomen and pelvis.
Pt refused blood products d/t her religious beliefs (orthodox Rastafari).
CT scan showed no retroperitoneal bleed on HD15.
She had an INR of 1.8 on HD4 that was reversed with vitamin K.  Her anemia was microcytic, but iron studies did not reveal iron deficiency.
Her Hct was followed daily and was stable and slowly increasing on the last 9 hospital days (Hct 17--> 21).
Her ARF resolved after the nephrostomy tube was placed antibiotic therapy started.
Her Cr went from 4.0 on HD1 to 1.1 at discharge.
Her bilirubin, transaminases, and LDH were high at the time of admission.
Urology put in her left percutaneous nephrostomy tube, ordered a urine gram stain and culture which grew out Strep Viridians.
##Yeast in urine found on culture X2.
Stool sent for guaiac, cx, OP and nothing was found.
She had normal BM for 10days prior to discharge  ## Positive blood cultures.
The only positive blood cultures revealed organisms suggestive of skin contamination (propionibacterium and corynebacterium).
Repeat cultures with no growth for the remainder of stay.
