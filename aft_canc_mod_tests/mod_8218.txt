On arrival to the Emergency Room, he was hypoxic with oxygen saturation in the mid 80% on ten liters nonrebreather.
Initial electrocardiogram showed atrial bigeminy but repeat was in sinus tachycardia.
[**2189**] echocardiogram showed mild left atrial enlargement, ejection fraction greater than 55%, mild aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, normal pulmonary artery pressures, hypercholesterolemia and status post appendectomy.
Pulse 146 decreased to 120 after fluid resuscitation.
Blood pressure 127/52, after fluid bolus breathing 25, saturating 92-93% on ten liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat showed pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodations.
Distal pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
Neurological exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count of 15.1 with 31% neutrophils, 51% bands, 5% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes.
Hematocrit of 45.3, MCV of 94, platelets of 740,000.
PT of 21.6, PTT of 40.7, INR of 3.3.
Sodium 137, potassium 4.3, chloride 99, bicarbonate 19, BUN 33, creatinine 1.8, baseline creatinine 0.9, glucose 208, acetone was negative, legionella urinary antigen was negative.
Urinalysis was amber, cloudy 1.030, small blood, greater than 32 protein, small bilirubin, urobilinogen was 1.0 with no cells.
Arterial blood gases were 7.34, pCO2 of 38, PA02 of 60, bicarbonate 21, lactate was 2.2.
First electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 108, left axis deviation, QRS at .144, poor R wave progression, persistent S in V6, T wave inversion in V2, V3.
Chest x-ray showed large right lower lobe infiltrate with volume loss, small pleural effusion on right.
PTT normalized over the course of stay.
Sputum cultures were repeatedly sent which did not grow out a predominance of any specific respiratory pathogen.
Early on the morning of his third hospital stay, he desaturated to the 80s and then began to fatigue with arterial blood gases of 7.23, 61, 64.
His chest x-ray was unchanged.
His small right side effusion was tapped which was shown to be exudative with a pH of 7.35, 2.6 grams of total protein, 112 glucose, 279 LDH.
Serum LDH at that time was 180.
Had 5,750 white blood cells with 64% polys, 3% bands, 30% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, 35,750 red blood cells.
Gram stain was unrevealing.
Chest x-ray unchanged.
A bronchoscopy was performed which showed normal airways, sputum in the right lower lobe and right middle lobe.
Gram stain showed 2+ polys, 1+ squamous cells, 1+ oropharyngeal flora.
On the fifth hospital day, Infectious Disease consult recommended a CT to evaluate further for processes as he remained without microbiological diagnosis.
Multiple predominantly ill-defined nodules throughout the remaining irradiated lobes most likely areas of early consolidation, however, follow-up CT after appropriate antibiotic therapy and serial chest x-ray are recommended to exclude true lung nodules.
Culture data was still unrevealing at this point, and so on the 19th, the sixth hospital day, the patient underwent open lung biopsy.
Despite two bronchoscopies with BAL and culture and multiple blood cultures, sputum cultures, no microbiologic diagnosis was ever made, however, the pleural fluid grew out presumptive Peptostreptococcus, rare growth, two colonies.
Echocardiogram obtained the next day showed mild left atrial enlargement, however, showed global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 25-30% where as it had been greater than 55% in [**2189**].
Also noted on the second echocardiogram was a focal apical right ventricular akinesis.
On the sixth hospital day, the patient underwent a Swan-Ganz catheterization to estimate his cardiac status and fluid status.
His cardiac output was found to be 4.83, index 2.12, SVR 878, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 15.
When the pathology from the lung biopsy came back positive for adenocarcinoma of the lung, the family made the patient "Do Not Resuscitate" and approximately three hours later, patient had a decreased response to pressors on 100% FIO2 and he passed away at 6 p.m. on [**2192-12-17**].
Consent for postmortem examination was obtained by the family.
