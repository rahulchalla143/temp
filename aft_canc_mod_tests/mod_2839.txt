Patient was noted to have air leak in the right-sided chest tube and given the findings in the bronchoscopy done on [**2132-10-23**] the air leak was expected.
By postoperative day seven patient's air leak has decreased and patient was given a trial of Water-seal with a follow-up chest x-ray, PA and lateral.
Again, a repeat chest x-ray done showed no change in the expansion of the right lung and patient underwent removal of a second chest tube without any difficulty.
Patient again underwent a chest x-ray to verify that his lungs were remaining expanded and after a satisfactory finding on the chest x-ray patient was discharged on postoperative day ten.
Patient was deliberately kept on a lower dose of Betapace due to his blood pressure in the ranges of 100's/60's.
