Reflexes were 3+ in the biceps and brachioradialis, 2+ in the triceps, 3+  in the knees, 2+ in ankles with silent toes.
MRI revealed anterior cervical epidural collection, largest at C6/7, but extending both laterally and caudally (to T2/T3) with severe compression of the spinal cord at C6/7, likely representing abscess.
Per Op report, he recived 4 liters IVF, EBL 75 cc, UOP 200cc and procedure was uncomplicated.
However, he did receive phenylephrine intraoperatively to maintain his blood pressure in the systolic 160's to perfuse his spinal cord.
Blood cx and wound cx growing MSSA, switched to Nafcillin on [**1-10**].
Repeat MRI of c-spine showed "increased signal of the spinal cord from C5-T3 with cord swelling and effacement of the subarachnoid space" concerning for infectious, ischemic, or a combination of both.

Imaging: ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND [**2166-1-11**]: The liver is normal in contour and echotexture.
TTE [**2166-1-10**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CXR [**2166-1-14**]: Development of bilateral pleural effusions blunting the lateral pleural sinuses and extending in the posterior pleural compartments.
To exclude coinciding significant pulmonary abnormalities, a CT may be helpful.
Further evaluation with MRI without and with gadolinium is recommended.
CT neck [**2166-1-20**]: Three radiographs of the cervical spine demonstrate C1-C7.
CT chest [**2166-1-18**]: There is dense consolidation with volume loss of the entire right lower lobe as well as of the anterior, lateral and posterior segments of the left lower lobe.
Noncontrast evaluation of the mediastinum is unremarkable, except for a stent visualized within the right coronary artery.
Evaluation of the osseous structures is unremarkable aside from degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen is unremarkable demonstrating unremarkable liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen and adrenal glands.
ECG [**2166-1-15**]: Sinus bradycardia (55) Prolonged Q-Tc interval (468) - clinical correlation is suggested No previous tracing available for comparison   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 59 y/o M hx CAD s/p stent, GERD s/p endoscopy, hyperlipidemia who presented with C6 epidural abscess s/p decompression with C6-C7 fusion with persistent postoperative fevers, trending down, improving ARF and stable transaminitis.
Surveilance cultures have all been negative.
Urine negative to date.
Given no changes on ECG c/w significant perivalvular abscess no further cardiac imaging Had chest CT [**2166-1-18**] to eval effusions given fever [**2166-1-18**], ?
Over 48 hours prior to discharge, his temp curve came down with a T max of 100.0.
ARF: Creatinine went from 0.8 to 1.9 [**1-11**], peaked at 2.1 [**1-12**], then slowly trending down to 1.4.
Increased LFTs: All LFT's elevated on admission, albumin noted to be low (2.1), coags WNL [**1-17**].
These increased to max ALT 125 AST 102 alk phos 332 and bili 3.6 but then trended down below admission levels, to normal ([**2166-1-21**] ALT 33, AST 17 AP 149 Tbili 0.6).
Abdominal CT not helpful, liver parenchyma c/w fatty infiltration.
Anemia: HCT dropped from 38 to 28 post operatively.
Iron studies, B12, folate show anemia of inflammation, no evidence of hemolysis; hapto, LDH normal.
This hct remained stable and has not required transfusion.
Based on MRI read, there may be a continuing process in neck/C-spine.
Chest CT showed possible RLL process but ID not favoring this as culprit, no treatment currently for pna, they recommended tap L AC joint given TTP over this however IR unable to do so given size.
Hyperglycemia: No hx of DM, BS in 200's most likely [**2-14**] infection and recent OR (stress) though could have underlying impaired fasting glucose not yet diagnosed, started will need to contiue insulin with 8units glargine qhs and adjust this as necessary.
Quadriplegia: some UE motor function returning, none in LE, working with PT/OT, in hard cervical collar post-op (8 weeks), monitor neuro exam closely, guarded prognosis, will need PE ppx: filter vs. anticoagulation, risk of PE very high but as pt still had low-grade temp, did not favor placing foreign body.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check CBC with differential, ESR, CRP, AST, ALT, Alkaline phosphotase, total bili once per week and forward results to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 803**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]: fax ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1353**].
