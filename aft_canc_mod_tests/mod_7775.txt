Admission Date:  [**2113-2-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-2-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-1-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Anzemet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: febrile neurtropenia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 58 year old female with hypothyroidism, HTN, and recently diagnosed ALL(Precursor B-phenotype, [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome negative) discharged recently after an admission from ([**2113-1-6**]- [**2113-1-26**]) after induction chemotherapy consisting of hyper-CVAD- cyclophosphamid, mesna, mtx, doxorubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone 40 mg/d dys [**12-22**] and [**11-1**].
She continued to experience dyspnea, and CT scan performed on [**2-18**] showed bilateral infiltrates/opacities, concerning for infection (?
ABG at this time (on 3.5 L) was 7.53/33/56.
She was put on 100% NRP, and ABG on this was 7.55.37.175).
Her sputum was negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] did grow GNRs and GPC.
Past Medical History: 1) ALL, Precursor B-phenotype (Induction with Hyper-CVAD [**2113-1-7**], Negative for [**Location (un) 5622**] Chromosome) ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Obtained from chart review: 58 yo female with a h/o hypothyroidism who presents for evaluation of possible ALL.
After a few days, pt had vomiting, abdominal pain, and fatigue increasing for about a week until [**12-28**], when the pt went to [**Hospital1 3793**] for the above symptoms.
Bone marrow biopsy was suggestive of pre-B ALL.
She was discharged [**12-30**] in stable condition and followed up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] in clinic [**1-5**], and felt the biopsy should be repeated here to confirm the diagnosis and possibly begin treatment if positive for ALL.
Bone marrow biopsy was performed on admission and interpreted as markedly hypercellular bone marrow with involvement by Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Precursor B-phenotype.
Cytogenetics were negative for [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome.
A central line was placed, an trans-thoracic ECHO was performed on admission.
Her ECHO revealed cardiac function within normal limits.
Her course was complicated by febrile neutropenia with blood cultures showing vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus.
Screening blood cultures were subsequently all negative after initiation of vancomycin.
A TTE was negative for endocarditis.
98.0, 127/67, RR = 20, HR =80.
2+ DP pulses b/l .
CXR [**2113-2-19**]: Worsening appearance of the chest with an appearance which is suggestive of developing fluid overload or edema.
Chest CT with contrast [**2113-2-18**] When compared with the prior study from [**2113-1-24**], new small bilateral parenchymal opacities are noted associated with ground glass opacities and septal thickening.
Echo [**2113-1-25**] Left Atrium 4.0 cm x 4.5 cm, right atrium 4.6 cm, LV thickness = 1.3 cm, Ejection Fraction = 70% to 80%, nml TRTR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): 19 to 21 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg) Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and hyperdynamic systolic function (LVEF>70-80%).
A chest CT showed new bilateral parenchymal pulmonary opacities consistent with an infectious process.
No PE was seen on the CT chest.
An induced sputum showed gram negative rods but these were consistent with mouth flora per the microbiology lab.
Upon transfer back to the BMT floor, a repeat CT scan showed worsened, extensive bilateral ground glass opacities sparing the lower lobes which appeared to be consistent with an infectious process.
A B-glucan was found to be positive at > 500.
# Pulmonary edema: A chest xray in the MICU showed evidence of developing fluid overload or edema.
A recent echo was noted to have a normal EF.
She was initially covered with Levofloxacin and Cefepime given the GNR in her sputum culture but per micro lab these were consistent with normal oral flora.
This was discontinued in ICU after improvement in her oxygen saturation and a CXR not c/w fungal pneumonia.
A Beta-glucan was found to be positive with CT scan showing ground glass opacities sparing the bases.
A differential was checked to ensure that this was not [**1-20**] the patient's leukemia.
You will need to call Dr.[**Name (NI) 6168**] office on Monday at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 6179**] to set up an appointment to see them on Wednesday, [**3-1**] for a count check.
