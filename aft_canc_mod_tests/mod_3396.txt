MRI head FINDINGS: There is a large infiltrating enhancing mass centered in the right clivus and petrous bone, involving the right cavernous sinus, engulfing, displacing, and potentially obliterating the right cavernous carotid artery.
There is enhancing, thickened dura extending from this mass, and correlation with the prior CT demonstrates hyperostosis of the right aspect of the clivus.
Additionally, there is a small acute right convexity subdural hematoma, which appears new compared to the prior CT of [**2118-3-18**].
IMPRESSION: 1) Large infiltrating mass centered in the right clivus/petrous bone with contiguous thickened and enhancing dura, engulfing and potentially obliterating the right cavernous carotid artery.
MR characteristics and the associated hyperostosis seen on CT favors meningioma.
2) Small, but acute right convexity subdural hematoma, new from the CT of [**2118-3-18**].
2) Known right skull base mass not well evaluated on this study, see prior discussion from the MRI brain and CT sella/orbit.
..... CT head with thin cuts through clivus: IMPRESSION: 1) Soft tissue mass, better delineated on the prior MRI, centered adjacent to the right cavernous sinus causes extensive hyperostosis of the petrous apex, body of the sphenoid bone, and right aspect of the clivus, suggestive of a meningioma, though see differential diagnosis provided on the prior MRI.
CT head showed tiny subdural hematoma thought to be non-contributory per Neurosurgery.
LP was done and we are waiting for cytology/cytometry but if this is negative will likely need a brain biopsy per neurosurgery.
Transsphenoidal biopsy frozen section showed likely meningioma.
He was transfused for Hct < 25, and Plt < 10 or bleeding.
He had a cortisol stimulation test which showed adrenal insufficiency.
