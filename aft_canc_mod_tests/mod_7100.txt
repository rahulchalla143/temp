In the ED her vital signs included a BP of 162/86 and HR 82.
Rectal exam showed bright red blood but no rectal fissures, masses, or external hemorrhoids.
Her initial Hct was 30 but dropped to 22 after fluid resuscitation and the bloody bowel movement.
If she rebleeds, they recommeneded proceeding to tagged red blood cell scan.
Shortly after this she had another bloody bowel movement and was thus sent to radiology for a tagged RBC scan before coming to the MICU.

GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2105-2-7**] INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for minutes were obtained.
A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.
Blood flow images show normal opacification of the aorta and iliac vessels Dynamic blood pool images show no evidence for uptake within the bowel to suggest active bleeding.
CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST  [**2105-2-9**] 3:31 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2105-2-9**] 3:30 PM INDICATION: 59-year-old female admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding with colonoscopy demonstrating a large 5-cm circumferential sigmoid mass at the distal sigmoid [**Month/Day/Year 499**].
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Within the right lobe of the thyroid, there is a 1.3 x 1.1 cm hypoattenuating nodule.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is focal annular thickening within the distal sigmoid [**Month/Day/Year 499**] with several regions of projectile soft tissue masses suggesting extramural extension.
A focal region of hyperinhancement is detected centrally suggesing a central ulceration.
She received a tagged red blood cell study which failed to demonstrate an active site of bleeding, and then she was admitted to the MICU for observation.
Her vital signs were stable and she had no further episodes of bleeding.
The scope could not traverse the lesion and the examination was interrupted.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the sigmoid [**Doctor Last Name 499**] mass.
Her lap sites were C/D/I, abdomen soft.
Hypertension: She was started on HCTZ 12.5mg qd for BP management.
