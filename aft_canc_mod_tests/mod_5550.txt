Cardiac workup was negative, but EGD showed a duodenal abnormality.
Endoscopic ultrasound was performed on [**5-11**] and biopsies were obtained.
The patient elected for the definitive procedure to be performed on [**5-15**], with the intent of an open exploration and biopsy of this duodenal mass.

no cervical lymphadenopathy Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally Abdomen:  obese, soft non tender non distended with no masses Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: alert and oriented times 3, with normal motor strength and sensation bilaterally  On discharge, the patient had an open abdominal wound with a draining pancreatic fistula.
Lymph node, Whipple, biopsy (B-C):           One benign lymph node.

Persistent and unchanged amount of fluid and air within the resection bed, mesenteric, and omental fat, which are consistent with the recent surgery.
[**2142-6-25**]: CT abdomen The previously demonstrated collection has necessitated onto the anterior abdominal wall.

His incision was noted to be erythematous, and cultures were sent, and he was started on antibiotics for a suspected wound infection.
On post operative day 5 the patient had increaseing abdominal distention and a abdominal xray was not concerning for obstruction.
His JP amylase was 2816 on post opeartive day 9.
Several CT scans were obtained to evaluate placement of a drain, however the radiologists did not feel that a drain placement would be possible, and that the fluid collection actually decreased in size on the repeat scan.
Fluid sent from the wound demonstrated a very hisgh amylase and the drain output continued to increase, putting over 300-500cc/day out of the abdominal drain.
On post operative day 14, the decision was made to srate the patient on TPN and make him NPO, since the drain output was nearly 700cc/day on a regular diet and taking ocretotide.
On post operative day 16 the drain output decreased to 200cc over the 24 hour period.
His drain output decreased to a manageable level for a rehab facility.
