After outside records were reviewed, it was discovered that patient did not have dental evaluation as previously reported, but instead had CT scan which was concerning for airway compromise.
CT scan of neck and torso was performed here and revealed severe narrowing of the airway at the level of the oropharynx.
Left supraclavicular LN excision ([**1-14**]) was performed and showed CLL.
Initial biopsy plans had been delaye3d by hypertensive urgency thought related to her underlying difficult to control BP in the setting of steroids.
Bone marrow biopsy done ([**1-13**]) to re-evaluate etiology of thrombocytopenia in preparation for chemotherapy decision-making.
When transferred back to the oncology service, she was still complaining of some difficulty breathing, had severe thrush, had an NG tube in place, and her sodium was 149.
Her NGT was pulled and pt quickly tolerated a regular diet.
However, on [**1-19**] she developed fevers while on the vent, up to 101.3, and was treated for VAP based on gram stain showing GPCs.
An initial urine culture was positive, with sensitivities primarily to medicines we could not use because of the patient's apparent beta-lactam allergy; Whether this was really a significant UTI was unclear at the time of transfer from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
However, a repeat urine culture on [**1-23**] again showed >100K of ESBL E. COli, although she was assymptomatic.
Patient experienced new episode during this hospitalization after discontinuation of lisinopril after this was held for worsening renal insufficiency, in spite of addition of hydralazine PO PRN for SBP > 160 and Q4H vital signs.
An echo was done and showed mild pulmonary artery hypertension and preserved systolic function with LVEF >55%.
#) Atrial Fibrillation - on [**1-27**] pt was noted to be in an irregular rhyhtm and EKG confirmed Afib.
Renal ultrasound was obtained and did not reveal any obstruction.
Urine electrolytes revealed FeUrea greater than 40% and nephrotoxic drugs were stopped.
On the floor, with aggressive rehydration for hypernatremia (max was 151), her creatinine decreased to baseline.
#) Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Hct 27, plt 23 on admission, both of which are below her baseline.
Patient's hematocrit decreased to 23.5 and given transfusion of 1 unit of PRBC.
Patient received 2 units of platelets prophylactically for biopsy of lesions.
CBC's were checked daily with criteria for transfusion being HCT 21 and platelets of 10. .
#) CAD: Although patient experienced malignant hypertensive episode with associated chest pain, there were no ECG changes and cardiac enzymes were negative x 3.
Although TSH was high, T3 and free T4 levels were within normal limits.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Lymphadenopathy Causing Tracheal Obstruction  Secondary diagnosis: CLL CAD CHF CRI HTN Hyperlipidemia DM type II Hypothyroidism Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Good, stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with fever and jaw pain.
A CT scan was done which showed tracheal obstruction from buildup of lymph nodes in your chest and neck.
We did an ultrasound and it showed no clot there.
