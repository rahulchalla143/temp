TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images of the head were obtained without the use of IV contrast.
The initial Ddx for his seizures included brain metastasis of known malignancy, infection (given 91% PMNs on WBC), hyponatremia, or adverse effect of unspecified herbal medications taken in [**Country 651**].
Head CT was performed, and was negative for metastatic lesions or other etiology of seizures.
The etiology of his seizure remains unclear, but it is thought that morphine may have contributed to his confusion, which was being used to treat his discomfort.
An NGT was not placed due to concerns of his gastric malignancy and his recent severe GI bleed (while in [**Country 651**]) that required transfusion.
After his GI bleed in [**Country 651**], his oncologist took him off of anticoagulation, as the risk of severe bleed was too high.
