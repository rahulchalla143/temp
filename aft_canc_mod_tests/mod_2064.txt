HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 35803**] was recommended to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3314**] for evaluation of a rectal cancer.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Notable examination values were a hematocrit of 46.5.
A BUN of 31, a creatinine of 1.3.
7 liters of fluid of lactated Ringer's intraoperatively with 630 cc of urine output with 500 cc of estimated blood loss.
He was stable to the Postanesthesia Care Unit; however, the patient had difficulty with extubation and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he stayed overnight with ventilator settings of pressure support of 5, PEEP of 5, FIO2 of 60, and arterial blood gas of 7.35/36/161/21/-4.
The patient was successfully extubated in the morning following surgery with one notable laboratory value of creatinine of 1.7 with adequate, but borderline renal output, most likely secondary to hypovolemia.
His patient-controlled analgesia was discontinued, and the patient began to tolerate a clear diet, and eventually advanced to a regular diet.
The Pleurovac was discontinued, and his drain output decreased and were pulled.
An electrocardiogram was done and was negative for any acute changes.
