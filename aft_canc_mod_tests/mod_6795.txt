His son states that the pt had been complaining yesterday of not feeling well, and had had a HA, but his son took his temperature and he was afebrile at 98F.
He was brought to [**Hospital3 15402**] Hosp, where he was found to have a fever to 102.4 F, and repeat NCHCT showed significant L sided vasogenic edema and 6 mm shift.

Non-Contrast CT Head ([**2135-2-5**]) PRELIM: Interval enlargement in left basal ganglia lesion with worsening surrounding vasogenic edema and two similar appearing foci in the left frontal lobe concerning for underlying neoplasm rather than purely hypertensive hemorrhage.
Non-Contast CT Head ([**2135-2-8**]): IMPRESSION: Status post left basal ganglia mass biopsy, without significant hemorrhage.
TTE ([**2135-2-7**]): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-12-10**], trace aortic regurgitation is now seen in the presence of normal valve morphology.
Renal Ultrasound ([**2135-2-7**]): IMPRESSION: Multiple bilateral renal cysts, some of which contains low-level internal echoes and septations.
CT head [**2135-2-9**] FINDINGS: Again seen is left frontal burr hole with mild soft tissue swelling and associated gas in the soft tissues, biopsy tract, and within the biopsied left basal ganglia lesion.
CXR [**2135-2-11**]  FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac silhouette has minimally increased.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 487**] is a 57 year-old right-handed man with past medical history including hypertension, hepatitis C, cryoglobulinemia, CKD, and prior left basal ganglia hemorrhage thought to be concerning for underlying malignancy who presented to [**Hospital3 **] following seizure activity and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] after a non-contrast CT of the head revealed significant vasogenic edema surrounding the left basal ganglia mass lesion associated with midline shift.
NEURO Following his arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**], a non-contrast CT of the head was repeated to evaluate for evolution of the lesion.
The imaging was thought to show interval enlargement in left basal ganglia lesion with worsening surrounding vasogenic edema concerning for underlying neoplasm.
The Neurosurgery Team was invited to participate in the patient's care, and performed a stereotactic biopsy of the lesion on [**2135-2-8**].
Preliminary results of the frozen section indicate malignanct glioma and final pathologic review demonstrated a WHO stage 4 malignant glioma.
A routine EEG completed on [**2-11**] demonstrated diffuse encephalopathy without evidence of seizure activity or foci.
Upon learning news of the biopsy result, the antibiotics were discontinued, as was the infectious work up.
A c. dif was negative x1, LFTs were normal with the exception of an AST of 78 and lipase of 81, and a plain film of his abdomen revealed no obvious pathology.
A bladder scan revealed > 1000 cc of urine.
A urinalysis and CXR showed no obvious infectious proces.
Allblood cultures where negative.
The study revealed multiple bilateral renal cysts, some of which contained low-level internal echoes and septations.
His creatinine this hospitalization ranged from [**2-9**] which is consistent with his baseline and has been receiving gentle hydration.
CARDIOVASCULAR The patient has been somewhat hypertensive with blood pressures 160s-170s/100-110s.
A biopsy of the mass was found a malignant glioma, a type of brain tumor.
