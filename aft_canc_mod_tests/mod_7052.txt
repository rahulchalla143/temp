Initial ABG showed pH of 7.11.
She had a bronchoscopy which did not reveal any mucus plugs or bleed.
Her sputum and blood cultures were negative during her stay.
Her flu swab and culture were negative as well.
An ECHO was done to look for cardiac failure as cause of resp distress.
Her was LV mildly depressed with an EF of 45-50%, mild PA sHTN, and a moderate loculated posterior pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
She received q6h duonebs which gave her symptomatic relief.
Broncial washings, sputum culture, and blood cultures drawn on admission were all negative, her IV abx regimen of ciprofloxacin and linezolid was continued on the floor through day 10 with the plan to continue the IV regimen for 14 days.
Fluid rescussitation was started with fluid boluses.
the patient was hypertensive prior to leaving ICU and was transferred from the floor on labetalol and trandolapril and tolerated the regimen well, with a discharge of BP 113/65 this am.
Her Cr and UOP was monitored throughout ICU course.
Her goal INR is [**1-22**], and her INR was 6.3 upon arrival.
Heme final recs for ICU were to allow patient to trend down on own and to start lovenox when INR between 3 and 3.5.
Her INR drifted below 3 on the day prior to transfer to rehab so SQ lovenox at 120 mg [**Hospital1 **] was started per hematology recs.
Her hematocrit remained stable in the mid 20's throughout her stay on the floor.
Hypertension: On HD 7 she had an episode of hypertensive urgency with SBP in 190's.
