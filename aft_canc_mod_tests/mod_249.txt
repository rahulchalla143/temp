Hct was 25.2 on discharge a few days ago and negative sigmoidoscopy as above.
Abd exam unchanged and trace guaiac + per referring physician.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99 HR 96 BP:118/50 RR22 O2Sat:99 on NRB.
He underwent CT Abdomen and Pelvis which showed tree in [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in bilateral lungs and bilateral pleural effusions and consolidations consistent with recent HAP, no SBO.
Labs revealed HCT of 23.6.
New worsening renal function on labs and new trop in the context of ARF.
BPs in high-90s with tachycardia to low 100s in MAT vs Afib/PVCs so sent to the unit for better monitoring.
VS HR 115, 106/58, 23, 97% 3L NC.
Congestive heart failure with previous EF 25-30% in [**2137**].

The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-9-11**], the  findings are similar (heart rate is faster).
CXR [**2141-2-8**]: FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.
The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS [**2141-2-8**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Right pleural effusion is stable since the previous study and the left-sided pleural effusion is slightly increased in size.
ECHO [**2141-2-15**]: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-2-1**], no change.
CT CHEST [**2141-2-17**] IMPRESSION: 1.
A three-month followup Chest CT is suggested following appropriate interval antibiotic therapy to assess for interval growth and to also confirm resolution of the above-described airway disease.
Hepatic hypodensity surrounding a fiducial marker, which appears larger in size compared to prior study and is incompletely evaluated.
Discharge labs: Hct 26.2 Cr 1.9  Brief Hospital Course: 87 year-old man readmitted for evaluation of decreased hematocrit and question of GI bleed.
PICC line was pulled and a repeat ECHO was performed.
No vegetations were seen on the cardiac valves and only one set of blood cultures was positive (for Enterococcus) making infectious endocarditis unlikely.
Pt was admitted with a weight of about 175# and volume overloaded on exam.
Despite the tremendous diuresis, the patient was still requiring 3L O2 which prompted CT Chest to evaluate for other pulmonary pathology.
Repeat CT Chest revealed aspiration vs PNA and a new small nodule.
Pulmonary consultation was obtained which believes that most of hypoxia likely related to smoldering PNA vs aspiration.
Swallow evaluation obtained to evaluate for aspiration.
Continue Chest PT and incentive spirometry.
He will need his oxygen saturation monitored and weaned O2 as tolerated.
Will defer to PCP or oncology to determine if patient if colonoscopy to evaluate for colon cancer recurrence is indicated.
His last transfusion was on [**2-8**] and his Hct remained stable at 26-27 during his hospitalization.
Systolic CHF, EF 30-35%: Dry weight 155 lbs.
Please check Cr in 2 days to determine interval change.
Repeat CT Chest in 3 months.
Anemia [**12-20**] chronic GIB: Pt's hematocrit was more or less stable between the range of 26-28.
Blood cultures from the PICC with enterococcus (low grade).
EKG without significant changes and troponins remained stable.
Aspirin was restarted and Hct remained stable.
LLE Doppler study negative for DVT.
Duonebs Q6H PRN 8.
