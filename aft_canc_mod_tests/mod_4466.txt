A TTE was performed with the discovery of pericardial effusion.
Initial gram stain of this fluid revealed no organisms but cell count was >20,000 with 98% neutrophils.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Imaging [**2132-2-19**] TTE: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-2-17**], the effusion is larger.

Repeat TTE after admission showed small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for tamponade.
Blood and urine cultures were sent.
Imaging studies failed to reveal any abnormal connection between the esophagus and the pericardium, so the source of the pericardial infection remained unclear (possibly hematogenous spread from a pneumonia).
Despite aggressive resuscitation as described above and successful weaning of IV pressor support, the patient's renal failure failed to improve and urine output dropped of preciptitously.
