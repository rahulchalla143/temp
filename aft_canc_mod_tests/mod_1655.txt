Followup chest radiographs would be helpful.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CTA Chest [**2187-2-21**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST, FINDINGS:  Current studies viewed in conjunction with the prior exam of [**2187-2-11**].
Tumor cells are positive for PSA and keratin cocktail and negative for PSAP, keratin 7 and 20. b.  Patchy organizing pneumonitis with features of bronchiolitis obliterated-organizing pneumonitis (BOOP).
Initial work up ruled out cardiac ischemia with a normal EKG and negative cardiac enzymes.
When the patient continued to be febrile, ceftriaxone and azithromycin were started for community acquired pneumonia, and coverage was then broadened to zosyn and vancomycin to cover nosocomial pneumonia as the patient's infiltrates on chest xray were worsening while the patient was hospitalized.
A viral antigen screen was negative, ruling out influenza and several other viral infections.
The pulmonary service was consulted, and a bronchoscopy with BAL was performed.
The gram stain from the BAL showed no organisms, and the respiratory culture grew oropharyngeal flora.
Thoracics recommended repeat Chest CT before considering VATS, and when this showed improvement in GGO they recommended continuing antibiotics and steroids and deferring VATS.
was still very SOB, and the team was not confident that his SOB could be contributed to pulmonary edema and PE alone)  It was also noted that pt's decompensation happened after steroids were d/ced, and so a steroid responsive process like BOOP was considered.
Pathology showed BOOP + evidence of metastatic prostate CA in the lung.
In the end pt's SOB was felt to be multifactorial, from PE, lung mets from prostate CA, BOOP, which was most likely [**1-18**] pt's recent chemotherapy regimen, and from CHF with diastolic dysfunction.
Cr was stable around 1 for several days prior to discharge.
He was monitored on telemetry for a few days with no significant events.
#Anemia -- The patient's creatinine ranged in the high 20s, down from his baseline of mid to high 30's.
Laboratory studies were consistent with this etiology.
Given the patient's hypoxia, it was decided to transfuse the patient to maintain hct around 30.
