Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lung biopsy on [**2193-2-28**].
Vertebroplasty   History of Present Illness: 88 year old male with a history of prostate cancer, CVA, DM2, CEA and [**Hospital 2182**] transferred to the medicine service for further evaluation of a lung mass.
He also had a spine MRI which demonstrated a T1 compression fracture.
MRI of his brain showing no significant change from his post-stroke MRI per report.
His PSA remained flat at this time and a CT chest showed 2 LLL masses along with renal and thyroid cysts.
He was started on steroids and  sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further managment.
IP was consulted to perform a percutaneous biopsy of the mass and CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were performed.
A bone scan and CT head were ordered along with a MRI of C5-T4.
The patient was transfered to medicine for further work-up of his lung mass once acute neurosurgical issues were excluded.
GIB 7. carotid endarterectomy 8.
Labs: Remarkable for WBC 18.3 trending downward, Hct 27.9 baseline 32, INR 1.3. .
MR thoracic and cervical spine without contrast ([**2193-2-25**]): 1.
Bone Scan ([**2193-2-26**]): No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
Focal uptake in the lower neck likely correlates with T1 compression fracture on CT scan.
CT chest/abd/pelvis ([**2193-2-24**]): 1.
Bronchial brushings and washings ([**2193-2-28**]): Negative for malignant cells.
Lymph node biopsy ([**2193-2-28**]): Non-diagnostic, lymph node not sampled, likely reactive lymphocytes.
Echo ([**2193-3-1**]): The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular systolic function is grossly preserved although views are technically suboptimal (EF probably >45%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
CXR ([**2193-3-1**]): Large lower lobe consolidation.
CXR ([**2193-3-2**]): Increased airspace opacity involving both lungs is new when compared to the previous chest radiograph and CT.
CTA ([**2193-3-1**]): 1.
No short interval change in the left lower lobe masses previously detailed on the study from five days ago.
TTE [**2193-3-3**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular systolic function is grossly preserved although views are technically suboptimal (EF probably >45%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Thyroid Ultrasound:  1) Very limited study due to overlying brace and patient immobility.
Noncontrast CT Chest: 1.
No change in large soft tissue mass in the left lower lobe with extension/invasion into adjacent chest wall, pleural effusion, and infrahilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
CT Head ([**3-13**]) for mental status changes: 1.
Tissue biopsy at the time of vertebroplasty was unrevealing.
Incidentally found on chest CT on [**2193-2-23**].
Anemia of chronic inflammation: stable at his baseline hematocrit of 28-30. .
Medications on Admission: (on transfer): HSQ ISS Allopurinol 300mg Latanoprost 1 drop qhs CTX 1g Gentamycin 80mg [**Hospital1 **] Protonix 40mg Iron 325mg [**Hospital1 **] Propoxyphene-APAP prn FA Glipizide 5mg .
