Initial labwork revealed nl CBC, chem-7 (except for low potassium), but elevated LFTs - ALT 184, AST 217, alk phos 323, nl bilirubin, LDH 3000.
RUQ u/s was done to further evaluate which showed thickening of GB wall w/edema without frank cholecystitis; it also revealed multiple hypoechoic rounded liver lesions worrisome for metastases.
A CTA confirmed LAD but did not show evidence of pulmonary embolus.A HIDA scan was obtained, preliminary result negative per ED resident.
Blood cx, urine cx were obtained.
Of note, an abdominal CT was done as an outpatient for evaluation of abdominal pain which showed: .
IMPRESSION: 1) Diffuse enlarged lymphadenopathy throughout the hilar, paracardiac, paraesophageal, paragastric, porta hepatis, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, iliac, inguinal, and deep pelvic regions.
5) No suspicious lesions seen throughout the lung bases or osseous structures, though dedicated chest CT and bone scan is recommended if clinically warranted.
Additional hx from the patient noted that the patient has had a colonoscopy in [**2163**] with non-malignant polyps and her last mammogram was at an outside institution, reportedly normal one year ago.

These were further characterized on a recent CT scan.
There is no definite evidence of cholecystitis, though to completely exclude cholecystitis, a HIDA scan could be considered.
5) Large spleen with areas of focal hypodensity better assessed on the recent contrast CT from [**2167-3-26**].
Brief Hospital Course: # Lymphoma: Pt was found to have physical exam c/w lymphoma/LAD, as well as elevated LFTs, LDH >3000, diffuse LAD on chest/abd CT.  She had also been having low grade fevers at home.
Pt had biopsy of cervical LN which returned as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type.
With treatment, her LDH, uric acid, and lactate levels all fell to acceptable levels.
Her electrolytes were monitored closely, and she required phos binders for much of her stay.
This was stopped when her levels dropped to normal range.
Her LDH continued to trend down and while intubated, BMT started the patient on rituxan.
She had a diaphragm bedside study on [**4-10**] which showed no paradoxical movement of the diaphragm.
She remained intubated with failure to wean for 2 weeks despite diuresis and treatment of a LLL consolidation on CXR and confirmed by CT.
Viral Ag not detected with negative AFB, viral cultures also negative.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient had a repeat bronch on [**4-22**] which showed significant bronchitis only mildly improved since Friday and the patient was kept on caspofungin with fungal cultures negative as her airways resembled "rotting ground beef" and appeared fungal in nature.
After much diuresis and continued antimicrobial treatment, the patient had a RSBI of 27 on [**4-24**] and was successfully extubated.
With treatment, her levels fell back to normal ranges.
Multiple urine and blood cultures (as well as sputum) were sent which showed no growth.
- A CT torso showed splenic lesions c/w infarct, w/ no clear evidence of infectious source.
All other cultures negative to date.
They did not believe that this wound was currently infected, but it was watched closely and ppx vancomycin was administered and continued as empiric coverage with no positive blood cultures in the setting of her febrile neutropenia.
An echo was done which showed hyperdynamic EF and a mildly hypertrophic LV.
- A repeat echo was performed on [**4-9**] which showed an EF of >55% but it was suboptimal.
As a result, a CT of the head was obtained which showed a small subdural hematoma.
