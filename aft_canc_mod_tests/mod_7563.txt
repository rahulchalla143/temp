The biopsy showed some evidence of a recent ecchymosis but no evidence of active infection (special stains for microorganisms were negative) and felt that the patient could go forward with transplant at this point.

TTE [**2191-7-4**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-6-6**], the degree of mitral regurgitation has increased.
Liver Ultrasound [**2191-7-6**] for elevated LFTs IMPRESSION: 1.
CT abd [**2191-7-9**] for elevated LFTs & neutropenic fever IMPRESSION: 1.
No CT explanation for patient's symptoms.
CT chest [**2191-7-10**] for hypotension & neutropenic fever FINDINGS:  The thyroid gland is homogeneous.
Skin biopsy [**7-15**] The changes are not well developed.
Patient had a repeat marrow on [**2191-4-18**], that showed approximately 15% blasts, but still consistent with an MDS.
Patient underwent ablative Flu/Bu/ATG, followed by allogenic MUD SCT, with CMV negative recipient, CMV positive donor.
Tacrolimus levels were monitored closely, patient received prophylaxis with acyclovir and micafungin, and neupogen was stopped upon engraftment.
- Continue Acyclovir and antifungal prophylaxis - Continue 2mg [**Hospital1 **] Tacrolimus, goal level [**4-7**] - Follow up in hematology/oncology clinic  # Neutropenic fever: No source identified on CT of chest ([**2191-7-10**]) or CT abdomen/pelvis ([**2191-7-9**]).
Antibiotic course was as follows :cefepime8/3-8/11, meropenem [**7-10**], aztreo [**Date range (1) 19818**], flagyl [**Date range (1) 19818**], vancomycin [**Date range (1) 91833**].
All blood and urine cultures were negative.
On the night following graft infusion patient was tachycardic and febrile to 103F, with pressures 80s/50s, responsive to fluids.
Several hours later, and EKG for persistent tachycardia showed Afib with RVR.
Biopsy showed early changes with keratinocyte apoptosis (possible result of recent chemotherapy), possible evolving drug eruption, viral exanthem, and graft versus host disease.
- If the eruption progresses, rebiopsy of a more developed lesion may be further revealing - Will need suture removal [**2191-7-28**]  # Blepharitis: likely due to recent immune reconstitution, possible reaction to normal flora, vs conjunctival GVHD.
Cultures were negative and pathology showed scar tissue with red cell extravasation and abundant hemosiderin deposits, no signs of infection to delay transplant.
It was monitored on physical exam daily throughout his hospitalization.
Transitional issues: - Will need suture removal on [**2191-7-28**] from left chest skin biopsy - Tacrolimus dose 2mg PO Q12H - Target Tacrolimus dose 5-10 - Patient will be followed closely by outpatient hematology/oncology - Continuation of metoprolol to be determined by outpatient cardiologist - Will need to start bactrim for PCP prophylaxis on [**Name9 (PRE) **] +30 - Positive EBV titer from [**2191-7-18**]  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Information was obtained from webOMR.
When your heart rate was normal and your cell counts had recovered we stopped the antibiotics.
You will need your stitches from your skin biopsy removed on [**2191-7-28**] by one of your outpatient providers.
