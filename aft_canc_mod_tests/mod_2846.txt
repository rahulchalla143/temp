He presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**7-4**] with these complaints after his VNA noticed increased dyspnea on exertion at home; at [**Hospital1 **] he got a repeat echo which showed worsened valve area to 0.7 and EF worsened to 25%.
He was noted to have episodes of paroxysmal SVT with ventricular rates ~110s.
Given that adjustment of his pacer may be required, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
The patient does have a significant cardiac history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and known ejection fraction of 2%, and also mitral regurgitation and aortic incompetence and aortic stenosis.
