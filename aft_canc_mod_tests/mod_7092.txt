Echogenic mass in liver seen on US was not visualized on CT because it was done without contrast due to contrast allergy.
MRI showed a lesion in segment 6, but per outpatient PET-CT report from [**2166-11-10**], nothing lit up in the liver, so nontargeted US-guided liver biopsy was done [**11-26**].
CT scan here of the head showed a significant amount of bleeding, and it wais unclear if this is increased or stable from prior.
Patient's neuro deficit (left visual field cut) has been stable, repeat CT 24 hours after admission as well as MRI [**11-23**] showed stable lesion.
# Coagulopathy: INR elevated, likely from liver decompensation.
A CIWA scale was ordered but he did not require any benzos.
Hyperglycemia likely due to decadron, although given degree of blood sugar elevation, he likely had an element of undiagnosed diabetes before.
His INR was trending up, Hepatology was consulted and did not recommend reversing unless evidence of bleeding.
On discharge his neuro exam was normal with a flat affect, and short term memory problems.
YOU WILL NEED A CAT SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST THAT CAN BE SCHEDULED AT THE TIME YOU MAKE THE OFFICE APPOINTMENT.
