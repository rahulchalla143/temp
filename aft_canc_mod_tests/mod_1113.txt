[**Hospital1 18**] ED: Pericardial tamponade by ECHO (RA diastolic collapse and RV compression) with pulsus paradoxus of 18-20 and tachycardia.
Red cells show minimal anisocytosis and rare nucleated red blood cells.
WBC count is increased.
Platelet count appears normal; occasional large forms are present.
Differential shows: Blasts 90%, Promyelocytes <1%, Myelocytes <1%, Metamyelocytes 1%, Bands/Neutrophils 2%, Plasma cells 1%, Lymphocytes <1%, Erythroid 6%.
ADDENDUM: Immunostains reveal the blasts are positive for TdT, and negative for CD1a.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this peripheral blood express lymphoid-associated antigens CD5, 7, 8 (dim) and 71.
They lack CD2, 3, 4, 10 (cALLa), 11c, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 33, 34, 41, 56, 64, 117, HLA-DR, glycophorin A, kappa and lambda.
CXR ([**2137-12-13**]): CHEST, PA & LATERAL: There are no prior films for comparison.
CT CHEST ([**2137-12-13**]): IMPRESSION: 1) Anterior mediastinal mass extending along the paracardium and to the left lung pleura with superior mediastinal, supraclavicular, with left axillary lymphadenopathy and with large pericardial and pleural effusions.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Removal of 600 cc of pericardial fluid.
Resting hemodynamics deomonstrated elevated right and left sided pressures with blunted Y descent and elevation of pericardial pressures with equalization of RA and pericardial pressures (18 mmHg) consistent with tamponade.
Upon removal of pericardial fluid, RA pressure decreased 8 mmHg, and pericardial pressure decreased to 0 mmHg.
The cardiac index improved from 1.9 l/min/m2 to 3.1 l/min/m2 with removal of pericardial fluid.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CXR ([**2137-12-20**]): PA & LATERAL VIEWS CHEST: The left hilar mass is unchanged.

Admission labs revealed a WBC of 38 with 60% blasts.
Chest CT imaging revealed a left-sided mediastinal mass adjacent to the pericardium, as well as supraclavicular and left axillary lymphadenopathy.
A bone marrow biopsy confirmed T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia.
He underwent successful pericardiocentesis and drain placement, which was later removed.
Follo-up echocardiograms were essentially unremarkable.
A repeat ECHO in two to three months was recommended.
Your blood counts will be checked and you will be given an injection of Neupogen to boost your white blood cell count.
