Biopsy of distal esophagus revealed markedly atypical squamous epithelium highly suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma.
On [**2129-12-23**] endoscopic ultrasound showed an ulcerated, infiltrative circumferential mass at 30 cm causing partial obstruction, close to 2 cm in maximum depth.
Two peri-tumoral nodes were noted which were not sampled as they could not be sampled without traversing the primary esophageal lesion first.
Biopsy revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
In the right femur, 4 cm below the femoral neck was markedly increased FDG avidity (SUV 9.4) in marrow without correlative lesion on CT.  On [**2130-1-12**] she had CT-guided biopsy of the right upper lobe mass revealing squamous cell carcinoma, felt to be metastatic from her esophageal primary.

Her blood pressure was 110/70s.
She was given 20mg IV lasix on the floor and then her BP dropped to 84/40 and she was given 500cc IV fluid and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Her cardiac enzymes were positive, and cardiology was consulted.
