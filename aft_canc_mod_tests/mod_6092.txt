58F with a history of metastatic RCC complicated by extensive mediastinal mets requiring placement of bronchial stent who was recently admitted for near syncope where she had a work up including  head CT, which was without changes, a CTA of the chest which was negative for PE and showed stable masses and an Echo which showed mild hypokinesis and an 40-45%.
She had a T Max of 101.4 for which she was given rectal tylenol.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn, she was flu swabbed and she was started on Levofloxasin.
Her WCC was 1.4 and ANC 1275. lactate 1.1  Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: The patient was in USOH until winter of [**2181**] when she developed cold symptoms which did not clear with antibiotics.
Lung mediastinal mass was detected on CXR, which was followed by a CT scan, which confirmed a mass in the mediastinum.
This was further evaluated  with imaging studies of the abdomen, which showed a large left renal mass measuring 15 x 11 cm.
She was further evaluated with MRI which showed a left renal mass with no evidence of involvement of the left renal vein.
MRI scan showed a mass in the vertex of the skull measuring 5 cm in greatest dimension.
She underwent a bronchoscopy to evaluate the hemoptysis symptoms and biopsy the lung mass.
However, pathology from this study was inconclusive.
She underwent a biopsy of the left kidney mass, which showed renal cell carcinoma [**Last Name (un) 19076**] nuclear grade 1.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-8-28**], the LVEF has significantly decreased.
CT abdomen/pelvis 1.
EEG [**9-15**]:  This is a normal video EEG study.
EEG [**9-13**] This is an abnormal portable EEG due to continuous generalized rhythmic spike and slow wave activity at a frequency of 2.5 Hz for the first half of this record consistent with non-convulsive status epilepticus.
MR head: Compared to the previous MRI from [**2183-2-18**], the soft tissue component associated with the vertex frontal bone calvarial lesion has markedly decreased in size likely reflecting interval treatment.
[**9-19**] CXR (post-bronch):  Atelectasis in the left base has minimally improved.

An echocardiogram was obtained, and her LVEF was depressed at 20%.
Her depressed EF was non-ischemic in etiology and was thought to be due to either radiation or sutent.
An LP was performed, which showed a normal opening pressure, with no evidence of infection.
The patient received empiric ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and acyclovir which were all discontinued after cultures were negative.
An EEG on [**2183-9-13**] showed that the patient was in non-convulsive status epilepticus.
# Bronchial stents- The patient underwent a flex bronchoscopy on [**2183-9-11**] which showed increasing tumor burden in the left main stem bronchus.
Post-bronchoscopy, the patient was noted to have decreased breath sounds on the left, and a chest film showed a white out of her left lung.
A scheduled rigid bronchoscopy on [**2183-9-18**] was performed which showed an occluded left main stem with granulation tissue, dilation was performed and a stent was replaced in the left main stem with good effect and significant improvement in her chest film.
