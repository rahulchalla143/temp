Patient was found to have postive lesions on a PET scan in [**Month (only) 116**] and a follow up CT scan in [**2190-7-18**] showed a 6.2x5.2 cm lesion in the right lobe of the liver at segment VII and a 2.9x2.4 cm lesion at the junction of the right and middle hepatic veins in the caudate lobe.
Physical Exam: On [**2190-11-2**] PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Vitals: T: 98.4 BP: 112/70 HR 114 100% on CMV 51%Fio2, Peep 10, RR 14 TV 550 Gen: intubated sedated/paralyzed, anasarca, jaundice, scleral icterus HEENT: Scleral icterus.
[**10-24**] CXR: NGT in place [**10-24**] US RUQ: patent L portal vein [**10-25**] CXR: Increase in right pleural effusion and atelectasis as well as left retrocardiac density representing atelectasis and/or pneumonia [**10-26**] CT Head unchanged from previous [**10-26**] MRI head: most likely hepatic encephalopathy [**10-26**] Liver US: patent vasculature [**10-27**] Renal US: symmetric arterial flow, no hydronephrosis [**10-30**] CT liver triphasic venogram: hypoenhancing segment II and partially segment III, narrowing of the main portal vein adjacent to the suture site for the right portal vein, patent hepatic artery, left portal vein, diffusely hypoenhancing colon consistent with colitis [**11-2**] Liver US: Flow in the left portal vein remains hepatofugal.
Given his change in mental status, the decision was made to transferred patient to SICU on [**10-24**] for observation and work-up of his mental status change.
Patient was worked up on the floor including having cardiac enzymes which was significant for Trop of 0.23-0.26 NGT was placed for initiation of PO lactulose.
He [**Month/Day (4) 1834**] a duplex US which showed patent hepatic vasculature with no biliary dilatation and no hepatic collection.
MRI non-revealing diffuse diffusion weighted imaging abnormality in bifrontal cortex.
Lactate 7.7 -> 6.1.
Off sedation/paralytics still only exam was +corneals/PERRLA, no gag, no movement.
INR 2.1 -> 6u FFP -> 1.7.
On [**11-2**] renal recommended peripheral blood smear for schistocytes, heme-onc reviewed smear (occasional schistocytes) and assessed as unlikely TTP.
Liver US showed normal arterial flow but reversed flow in L portal vein.
Episode of a-fib with RVR (HR 160) converted with metoprolol 5 mg IV x 4 and diltiazem 10 mg. Demand ischemia with trop 1.44.
Returned to a-flutter with 1:2 capture, HR 110-115 with BP 110/70.
Final ECG showed no acute ST segment changes.
