Sodium of 134, potassium 3.3, chloride of 90, bicarbonate of 33, BUN 19, creatinine 1.5, glucose 101, ALT 15, AST of 39, alk phos of 88, total bilirubin of 0.6, calcium 8.3, magnesium 2.0.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a rate of 100, no acute ischemia.
Chest x-ray was significant for elevated left hemidiaphragm and minimal subsegmental atelectasis of the left lung.
CT scan done on [**2174-5-4**] was significant for no bladder wall or rectal wall thickening of any significance.
and patient underwent a barium swallow [**2174-5-13**].

Patient was restarted on his Coumadin on postoperative day number three and his current INR is 1.7.
He has been weaned off oxygen with O2 saturations in the high 90 percents.
Patient's hematocrit has remained stable at 30.
Patient's electrolyte balance has remained sable and kidney function has remained stable with his last BUN and creatinine being 33 and 1.0.
