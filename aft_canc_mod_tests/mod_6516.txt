Her complete hospital course is outlined as a timeline and by problem below: =============================== EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT/ORTHOPEDICS COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was seen in the ED by orthopedic surgery and her LLE compartments were measured.
The pressures (in mm Hg) were 45, 78, 35, and 38 for the posterior superficial, posterior deep, anterior, and lateral comparments, respectively.
Her HCT post-op was 24 and she was given 2 units of PRBCs for acute blood loss anemia.
She was given 10mg IV lopressor but her heart rate only came down to the 160s and SBPs were in the 80s to 90s.
The patient was transferred to the MICU and given adenosine, after which her heart rate came down to the 80s.
INR bumped to 6 after one dose of 5mg coumadin in the setting of concurrent Abx.
-Status post ablation on [**2188-12-15**], HR and BP have been stable since.
-Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was on warfarin 2 mg daily, INR on admission to medicine was therapeutic at 2.2; remained therapeutic at 2.7 at time of discharge (goal [**3-11**]).
