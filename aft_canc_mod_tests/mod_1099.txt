C DIFF [**4-17**]: negative RESP VIRAL SCREEN [**4-17**]: negative DFA FLU [**4-17**]: negative .
STUDIES: CXR [**2124-4-17**]: AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
CT HEAD W/O [**2124-4-17**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
CXR [**2124-4-18**] FINDINGS:  Some mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects minimal effusion and possibly some minimal atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: Pt is an 80 yo F with T2DM, CKD, CHF with EF 15-20% ([**10/2123**]), and asthma with hx of recent diverticulitis in [**Male First Name (un) **] c/b sepsis, has been at home for the last few days, doing well until the family noted her to be altered [**2-18**] morning, found to be hyponatremic and febrile.
CT head negative for intracranial process.
Possible sources of infection include abdominal process such as diverticulitis, PNA, viral URI, UTI, and less likely meningitis, or C. diff vs. endocarditis.
However, exam is benign without pain, making this less likely.
CXR unremarkable for consolidation, and given no cough, this was considered less likely.
Viral URI or influenza certainly possibly given high fevers.
Her Na+ was 127 on discharge.
# Chronic systolic heart failure: EF from [**10/2123**] of 15-20%, she appeared dry on first exam and was given IV fluids.
# CKD: Baseline Cr 1.3-1.4, and Cr on admission is 1.2.
Hct above baseline (Hct 30 on last discharge), but unknown if recently transfused in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**].
Last iron studies suggestive of ACD given elevated ferritin, low TIBC.
HCT was stable on this admission and 30.7 on discharge.
# Hypothyroidism: nl freeT4 and TSH, she brought in her [**Male First Name (un) 4982**] and her dose was revealed to be 88mcg daily and this dose was restarted on discharge.
Her electrolytes (Na+) should be rechecked on follow-up Friday.
If her hyponatremia persists, she should have SIADH workup including CT chest/MRI head.
IF diarrhea ongoing, would repeat stool studies and consider treatment for complicated course (7-10days Ivermectin)   [**Month/Day (2) **] on Admission: [**Month/Day (2) **] per most recent discharge: -fluticasone 50 mcg/Actuation Spray Two Spray Nasal [**Hospital1 **] -omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)
