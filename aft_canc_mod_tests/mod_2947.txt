His primary care physician ordered laboratories, CT and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was attempted at the outside hospital, however, this was unsuccessful.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2161-8-18**], for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent which was also unsuccessful due to blood and coffee grounds in the stomach, oozing and major papillae edema.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission, the patient was afebrile at 98.6, blood pressure 150/80, heart rate 78, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 96% in room air.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  His laboratories from the outside hospital included a CA of 34.3, CA19-9 pending, total bilirubin 15.0 and prothrombin time of 13.0, INR 1.3 and partial thromboplastin time of 32.0.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospitalist service and was sent for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2161-8-18**].
As previously mentioned, the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was unsuccessful.
On [**2161-8-19**], the patient received a CT angiogram of the abdomen.
On [**2161-8-20**], the patient went for a magnetic resonance scan to determine the nature of caudate lobe lesion.
During this magnetic resonance scan procedure, it was discovered that the patient had a large subcapsular hematoma of the liver.
At this time, his hematocrit was 31.3 and dropped to 29.6 over a matter of hours.
Hematocrit on admission had been 40.5 two days earlier.
The patient was taken to the angiography suite where mesenteric angiography was performed which showed no evidence of extravasation or hepatic artery injury.
However, the patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring of hematocrit and of vital signs.
He continued to improve and his hematocrit remained stable.
His hematocrit at this time was 28.7, however, the patient was asymptomatic.
The plan was to transfuse the patient to a hematocrit of 30.0.
