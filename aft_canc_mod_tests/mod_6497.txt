Pain was [**9-14**] at its worst.
Presented to OSH where EKGs were remarkable for STE and small q waves in II, III, aVF with reciprocal ST depressions in I and aVL.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Vitals at that time were HR 109, BP 128/68 RR 19 O2 sat 99%.
Cardiac catheterization showed a right dominant system with total occlusion of RCA, minimal disease in the remaining vessels.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 6 cm, positive hepatojugular reflex.

Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by a member of the nursing staff.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial pressure of 133/53mmHg.
A spiral CT must be obtained to r/o PE as this may have been a chronic TO.
The study is not tailored for precise characterization of subdiaphragmatic contents.
Extensive metastatic disease in the liver, better assessed by the prior CT torso on [**2174-2-21**].
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 88506**] is a 66 year old M w/ h/o pancreatic CA s/p sphincterotomy [**12-15**] and chemotherapy with gemcitabine and erlotinib, DM type 2, and CAD s/p MI and PCI/stent [**2167**] who was transferred from OSH with acute inferior STEMI.
EKG consistent with inferior MI.
Given findings on cath and history of intermittent pleuritic pain prior to today's episode cannot be entirely sure about the timing of the MI.
ASA 325mg and clopidogrel 75mg needs to be taken daily for as long as a year if he can tolerate, but no less than one month.
# Pleuritic chest pain: Thought [**3-9**] MI related pericardial irritation.
Chest CTA showed no evidence of PE.
He does have a friction rub noted on exam that persisted.
ECHO after MI showed EF of 40%, no pericardial effusion.
Urine culture was negative.
His leukocytosis resolved and pt remained hemodynamically stable.
There are 3 more sets of blood cultures pending at the time of his discharge.
You underwent cardiac catheterization and two stents were placed in one of your coronary arteries.
You will need to have your blood drawn weekly to check your liver and kidney function on this antibiotic.
