His edema and decreased urine output continued to progress, and he began to develop scrotal edema.
In the ED, initial VS T 97.5 HR 62 BP 99/49 RR 20 SaO2 96% on RA.
His creatinine was 2.6 which was an increase above his baseline of 1.5-2.
A Foley was placed, >600 mL of urine was drained.
A CXR showed vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions left>right.
An EKG showed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of 63, RBBB, LAFB, unchanged from prior EKG.
Bedside US showed bilateral pleural effusions.
Abdominal U/S showed free fluid and no hydronephrosis, but scrotal fluid.
His fluid balance was even over these two days.
His O2 sats remained >95% on [**1-22**] L/min O2.
His CXR at that time showed bilateral plueral effusions and vascular congestion.
His net fluid balance was negative 200 cc that day.
His insulin was further decreased to NPH 10 units QAM and 5 units QPM with sliding scale.
Patient was transferred to cardiology service for further management.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2122-5-13**] there is no significant change.
CXR [**9-3**]: The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.
Renal Ultrasound [**9-4**]: The right kidney measured 10.5 cm.
Echocardiogram [**9-4**]: The left atrium and the right atrium are moderately dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-12-12**], the findings are similar (prior study image quality was superior).
Chest X-ray [**9-12**]: Persistent cardiomegaly accompanied by slight improvement in degree of pulmonary edema and associated decrease in right pleural effusion, now small in size.
Bibasilar opacities appear similar to the prior study as well as a moderate left pleural effusion.

Hemodynamic catheterization revealed the presence of pulmonary arterial hypertension in the setting of moderately elevated left venticular filling pressures.
Right ventricular filling pressure was mildly elevated in the setting of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Vasodilator test wtih inhaled nitric oxide revealed no reversibility of the pulmonary hypertension.
Cardiac index was at the lower limit of normal.
Upper extremity U/S [**9-15**]: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral subclavian veins were performed; normal and symmetric flow was observed.
Chest, abdominal and pelvic CT [**9-17**]: CT OF THORAX: Prior median sternotomy noted.
CT OF ABDOMEN: Note is made of a fundal gastric diverticulum (2:50).
Repeat echo was similar to prior showing severe pulmonary arterial hypertension and resulting right sided heart failure, with EF >60%.
Right heart catheterization with inhaled vasodilator testing was performed which showed elevated pulmonary pressures that were not responsive to either 100% FiO2 or inhaled nitric oxide (PA 89/19/42).
CXR and CT scan of the chest demonstrated bilateral pulmonary effusions.
