He was then evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 57521**] (Hematology)on friday and had a bone marrow biopsy performed (reportedly drytap).
He reported to the ED at [**Hospital1 **] where his initial labwork revealed wbc 7.6, hgb 8.0, hct 24.2, plts 39, wbc diff 8.9 poly, 27.4 lymphs, 62.3 mono, 1.0 eos, 0.5 baso, PT 15.7, inr 1.7, t. bili 1.5.
He was further evaluated with a CT Abd showing massive splenomegaly with question of masses, ascites with possible hemorrhage in the pelvis, and several small retroperitoneal lymph nodes.

At one point this was accompanied by an 8-point hematocrit drop which was concerning for a rebleed in his spleen.
At that time he had an abd CT which ruled out an intraperitoneal bleed.
He had a total of 3 abdominal CT scans while he was on the BMT service all of which demonstrated lessening intraperitoneal fluid and either stable or less splenomegaly.
(Of note, one CT demonstrated possible clot in one of his iliac veins, and so he had negative lower extremity dopplers at that time.)
He was instructed on d/c to have labs checked when he returned to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] in clinic.
He did have some greenish nasal d/c and sinus pressure, and a sinus CT demonstrated minimal mucosal thickening.
It was also felt that his fevers could have been due to either his disease or his chemo, and so he was given Prednisone 20 mg po bid.
He had an abdominal and head CT at that time (given his massively splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia) which ruled out bleeds in his abdominen and head.
Initially it was more cholestatic-appearing, with an elevated direct and indirect bilirubin (his bilirubin peaked at 23.)
He had hepatitis serologies that were negative except for Hepatitis B surface antibody.
His liver tests continued to rise after this, and the Hepatology service was consulted.
They felt it was likely secondary to drug-induced liver injury although they were also worried about hepatic infiltration from his malignancy, and he underwent an ultrasound guided liver biopsy.
Essentially it was a bland biopsy felt by Hepatology to be c/w drug-induced injury.
His bilirubin and alt/ast slowly trended down.
