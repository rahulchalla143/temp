Lumbar puncture had been considered to rule out central leukemia and, prior to doing the lumbar puncture, re-imaging of the brain was performed to look for any central lesions, any increased intracranial pressure secondary to hydrocephalus, and also to look for any structural defects which may have predisposed to the bleeding.
This scan was performed on [**2154-12-3**], which revealed a "possibility of an abnormal vessel within the region of the mesencephalic hemorrhage."
Neurosurgery felt that no further workup, including angiogram, was indicated and recommended keeping the patient's platelets above 25,000 when performing further chemotherapy.
Neurology agreed that no further workup was necessary based on the findings.
Neurologic examinations concentrating on the cerebellar examination were performed before each dose of the high-dose ARA-C, and she performed quite well, given her previous deficits.
On [**12-8**], her white blood cell count was 12.8, which rose to 17.9 on [**2154-12-9**].
At the time of this dictation, her white blood cell count has fallen to 4.2 x 103, with a differential of 96.8% neutrophils, 2.2% lymphocytes, and 0.9% monocytes.
Neurology:  Her previously-described right frontal and mid-brain bleeds were unchanged as seen on the MRI performed on [**2154-12-3**].
Her neurologic examination continued to improve throughout her hospitalization.
No lumbar puncture was ever performed to rule out CNS leukemia, as the suspicion for that was very low.
The CT of the chest showed some dependent atelectatic changes at the bases bilaterally, but no focal parenchymal consolidations.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  After coming out of the Intensive Care Unit, the patient's electrolytes became much more easy to manage and required very little repletion of either potassium or magnesium.
