CXR on admission: Consolidation in bilateral lower lobes, which may represent pneumonia or aspiration superimposed upon underlying chronic lung disease.
Lung volumes are small due to low inspiratory level.
Later, the urine culture grew GNR.
The preliminary read of the patient's CXR was atelectasis, however, subsequent read suggested bibasilar infiltrates that could be consistent with pneumonia.
# Jaundice: The pt had a bilirubin that was elevated markedly from baseline, though alkaline phosphatase remained only somewhat elevated from baseline.
MRCP was obtained and showed extrinsic compression from a mass in the caudate lobe of the liver.
The pt had a fixed defect on MIBI but initial enzymes were negative by CK.
# CHF: reported EF 50-65% ([**2192**]).
Nebs were used as needed and azathioprine was held until creatinine decreased to normal range.
