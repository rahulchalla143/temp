Karyotype was 46 XY via amniocentesis.
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm without murmur noted.
The neurologic examination was nonfocal and looked age appropriate.
The patient has been intubated since day of life one and remains currently so with peak inspiratory pressures ranging anywhere from 17 to 23, with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 and a ventilator rate of 16 to 26.
Currently, as of [**4-6**], the ventilator settings were a PIP of 19, a PEEP of 5 and a respiratory rate of 18.
On [**4-6**], a chest x-ray was obtained due to lack of progress in being able to wean the ventilator.
That chest x-ray showed hazy lung fields with poor expansion likely from distention from below and the baby required a glycerine due to what appeared to be some buildup of stool.
The patient did receive hydrocortisone as noted above and had rapid improvement in both sugars and blood pressures.
Secondary to normal chromosomes, cortisol levels, subsequent glucoses, blood pressures and with a phallus size which they deemed to be within the range of normal, they felt that there was no further endocrine work-up needed at this time and signed off.
An abdominal ultrasound was done looking at internal structures.
On [**3-10**], there was a question of a mild hydronephrosis but a repeat examination on [**3-11**] due to concern about adequate windows showed that that examination actually was normal.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:   The patient was initially hypoglycemic requiring D10 boluses.
There was a peak bilirubin of 6.3 during this time.
The physical examination was completely benign.
The KUB showed normal gas pattern and a CBC was benign with only three eosinophils present.
A lumbar puncture was done and benign, and has not required any subsequent antibiotics since.
In addition, in combination with the Endocrine work-up, a urine CMV was sent which was negative.
The first head ultrasound on [**3-11**] was normal.
The second head ultrasound on [**3-15**] was also normal and the 30 day head ultrasound is currently scheduled for [**4-8**] and is pending.
The patient has not had a hearing screen to date and has not had any ophthalmologic examinations.
