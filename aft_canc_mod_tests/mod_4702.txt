Labs were notable for a leukocytosis with bandemia of 9%, lactate 3.7 --> 3.1, and sodium 131.
CXR and CT revealed a large right pleural effusion.

[**2-6**] CT Head: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse.LV function is preserved with an EF of >55%.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Pleural Fluid cytology showed rare atypical epithelioid cells with enlarged nuclei and prominent nucleoli, too few to characterize.
Pericardial Fluid cytology showed predominantly blood with lymphocytes, neutrophils, and few mesothelial cells.
Work-up revealed large right pleural effusion, which was drained after pigtail catheter placement.
Course c/b by aspiration event, hypercarbic respiratory failure and acidemia requiring intubation, hypotension in setting of probable sepsis and cardiac tamponade, s/p pericardiocentesis.
Initial differential included cardiogenic vs. septic vs. adrenal inusficiency.
Bedside echo revealed evidence of pericardial effusion and possible cardiac tamponade, and after cardiology consulted patient taken to cath lab for pericardiocentesis.
A restrictive cardiogenic process was considered, given hyperdynamic heart and preload dependence.
Effusion likely malignant; pleural fluid analysis showed atypical cells on cytology and was negative for infection/empyema.
CTA was negative for PE and LENIs also negative.
Patient continued on broad spectrum antibiotics, with regimen later broadened to include cipro for pseudomonas double coverage as patient was continuing to spike fevers and WBC was trending up.
#Adrenal Insufficiency: Patient has known adrenal mets, and given eosinophilia on WBC differential, was concern for adrenal insufficiency.
Previous PET CT did not show any evidence of metastases.
Plain radiographs of left hip obtained and will need MRI for further workup.
Patient has had recent MRI of lumbar spine in [**12/2168**] which showed multiple levels of canal stenosis and bilateral severe neural foraminal narrowing.
This slowly trended down as he clinically worsened until on the evening of [**2-11**] his urine output ceased entirely in the setting of hypotension and worsening sepsis.
