Comparison with the previous study done [**2163-2-12**].
CT chest/Abd/ Pelvis [**2163-2-11**] IMPRESSION: 1. lnterval improvement in extensive bilateral pulmonary consolidation and ground-glass opacities, which may represent multifocal infection or diffuse lung injury.
No adrenal tumors or abdominal pathology identified to explain the patient's hypertension.
Small left renal infarct or scar  [**2163-2-5**] CT head IMPRESSION: 1.
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] underwent diagnostic cerebral angiogram which did not demonstrate intracranial arterial or venous abnormality to explain the intraventricular hemorrhage.
On correlation with the MRI of the brain obtained same day at 2:47 a.m., this lack of filling of the left transverse sinus is consistent with a congenitally hypoplastic sinus vs chronic occlusion.
[**2163-1-24**] CTA head/neck IMPRESSION:  Extensive intraventricular hemorrhage and dilated third and lateral ventricles.
He has serial CT heads and a cerebral Angio which failed to demonstrate an etiology in terms of underlying structural abnormalities.
With regards to his blood pressure.
He was placed on 4 antihypertensive agents but this has been changed daily as his blood pressure has been under better control.
His medications should be titrated to SBP 95-160 goal.
Because he had high blood pressure a screening test for pheochromocytoma was initiated but an endocrine consult stated that the tests are not interpretable during this acute phase and recommended they get tested once he is no longer infected, stable, and off a beta blocker.
A CT of the chest abdomen and pelvis was completed and failed to show a pheochromocytoma.
