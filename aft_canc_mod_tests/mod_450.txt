#Iron deficiency anemia due most probably to chronic gastrointestinal bleeding: Patient was found to have a hematocrit of 17 and was noted to have ST depression on EKG that resolved with transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells.
Labs were notable for iron deficiency.
The patient was seen by GI and had an upper endoscopy and colonscopy which could not identify a source of bleeding, but colonoscopy had poor prep.
Therefore, the patient was discharged to follow up for a repeat scope in 3 weeks.
Her lisinopril was held and her lasix was continued.
#Probable CAD: Patient had ST depressions with hematocrit of 17 that resolved with transfusion of red cells to hematocrit of 27.
This was not restarted on discharge, but could be restarted in the outpatient setting if hematocrit remains stable.
Additionally, stress testing was deferred, but this could be considered in the outpatient setting as a positive test may reduce threshold for addition of a betablocker to the patient's hypertension regimen.

Discharge Instructions: You were referred to the hospital for evaluation of anemia and hyperkalemia in addition to treatment of your COPD.
You were seen by the Gastroenterology team and had an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy to evaluate for cause of GI bleeding.
Your upper endoscopy did not show evidence of bleeding but did show abnormalities.
These were biopsied and the GI team will inform you of these results when they return.
Additionally, your colonoscopy did not show evidence of bleeding but you had a poor prep.
Additionally, when your blood counts were low you had EKG changes which suggest possible underlying coronary artery disease.
Lastly, your blood sugars were noted to be low during this admission.
