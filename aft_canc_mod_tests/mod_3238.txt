The patient was admitted [**2190-4-19**] through [**2190-4-23**] for Cycle 2 [**Hospital1 **], which was deferred as the patient was complaining of diarrhea and was noted to be C. difficile positive.
CMV viral load was negative during admission.
The patient had an abdominal X-ray from clinic the day of admission that was negative for obstruction.
Her first positive C. difficile stool study was on [**2190-3-13**] and she initially was treated with flagyl.
She had negative C. difficile stool studies on [**2190-3-27**] and [**2190-4-9**].
Past Medical History: Non-Hodgkin's follicular lymphoma: diagnosis of lymphoma in [**2173**], initially low grade that transformed to large cell - Status post autologous stem cell transplant - Relapsed s/p Rituxan ('[**86**]-'[**89**]) - Subsequent progression, s/p bendamustin (5 cycles, discontinued due to nausea & vomiting) [**2189**] - Persistent pleural effusions and right-sided chest mass (local radiation) now s/p pleuridesis [**2-17**] - Pleural biopsy showing B cell lymphoma--> [**Hospital1 **] cycle #1: [**2190-3-17**] - Received Rituxan on [**2190-4-15**] .
Narcolepsy 5.
Physical Exam: VS T 97.3 P 84 BP 160/80 R 18 O2 sat 96% RA General: Moderate discomfort HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM, OP without lesions Neck: Small nodule (old scar), no lymphadenopathy Heart: RRR, S1S2, faint 2/6 SEM LUSB Lungs: Decreased breath sounds right base, clear right Abdomen: NABS, soft, NTND, no rebound/guarding, well-healed scar in lower abdomen Back: Tenderness to palpation in right flank Extremities: Right upper extremity is markedly edematous, without erythema or warmth.
Pleural tissue biopsy [**2190-3-8**] Impression: Extensive infiltration by large B cell lymphoma.
TTE [**2190-3-8**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-1-28**], no change.
CT torso [**2190-4-28**] showed improvement in disease.
The patient had two episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate 130s-140s.
Thyroid function tests were within normal limits this admission.
CT torso showed no concerning findings.
CT torso showed no concerning findings.
UA negative/urine culture pending to rule out pyelonephritis.
Chest x-ray showed fluid overload and question of gith middle lobe infiltrate.
Ultrasound negative for DVT on recent admission.
This likely represents lymphatic obstruction as CT torso showed persistently enlarged axillary nodes.

Transformed B-cell lymphoma status post Cycle 2 [**Hospital1 **] 2.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate 4.
