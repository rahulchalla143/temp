Recommend MRI for further evaluation.
MRI Head [**7-1**]: FINDINGS: There is an extraaxial mass identified arising from the left sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] measuring approximately 3.7 x 3.2 x 2.7 cm in anterior posterior x transverse x superior inferior dimensions.
CTA Head/Neck [**7-1**]: NECK CTA: The aortic arch appears normal.
Post-op Head CT [**7-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI Head ([**7-10**])-Post-op: FINDINGS: Patient is status post recent resection of the known left sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] mass lesion representing a meningioma.
Blood products are noted in the left inferior frontal lobe.
A close f/u study for better assessment can be considered.
Enhancement within the surgical resection cavity is difficult to assess given the pre-contrast T1 hyperintense areas related to the blood products.
blood products, edema or infarction- close f/u MR for better assessment.
She had CTA of head and neck that was negative for aneurysm, however a left sided spendoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] meningioma was identified.
MRI of head was also done to evaluate extent of surgical resection.
She was discharged on dilantin with instructions for a blood level to be drawn by PCP and faxed to the neurosurgery office.
