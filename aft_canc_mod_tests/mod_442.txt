Subsequent MRI showed a large ill-defined heterogeneous mass concerning for an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with multiple satellite nodules.
She does admit to decreased appetite, abdominal fullness, and persistent right leg swelling.
She has been taking all of her medications and her last INR was 2.5 2 days prior, and notably has never been subtherapeutic since starting this coumadin.
Past Medical History: -Lower extremity DVT -PE anticoagulated on Coumadin -Pulmonary nodules -Live mass concerning for malignancy -Hypertension -Hypothyroidism status post thyroidectomy on levothyroxine -Cholecystitis status post cholecystectomy -Scoliosis -Hypersensitivity to heparin -H/o intracranial and cervical spinal meningioma s/p posterior fossa decompression, C1-C2 laminectomies, tumor resection and grafting([**2107-12-17**])  Social History: Patient is origally from [**Country 651**].
SKIN: dark, no rashes; scoliosis noted NEURO: CN 2-12 grossly in tact, no gross neurological abnormalities, moving all extremities  Pertinent Results: [**2110-5-9**] 05:10PM   PT-24.4* PTT-29.4 INR(PT)-2.3* [**2110-5-9**] 11:00AM   UREA N-21* CREAT-0.9 SODIUM-136 POTASSIUM-3.9 CHLORIDE-101 TOTAL CO2-24 ANION GAP-15 [**2110-5-9**] 11:00AM   ALT(SGPT)-13 AST(SGOT)-35 CK(CPK)-47 ALK PHOS-257* TOT BILI-0.6 [**2110-5-9**] 11:00AM   CK-MB-2 cTropnT-0.01 proBNP-3016* [**2110-5-9**] 11:00AM   CALCIUM-9.0 PHOSPHATE-3.0 MAGNESIUM-1.8 [**2110-5-9**] 11:00AM   WBC-9.9 RBC-4.03* HGB-10.8* HCT-34.1* MCV-85 MCH-26.8* MCHC-31.7 RDW-15.0 [**2110-5-9**] 11:00AM   NEUTS-84.5* LYMPHS-8.6* MONOS-3.8 EOS-2.8 BASOS-0.2  Studies: [**2110-5-21**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-4-7**], the pericardial effusion appears larger.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-5-2**] atrial ectopy appears somewhat more frequent and the overall ventricular rate is marginally increased.
[**2110-5-9**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: .
Right common femoral, superficial femoral, and deep femoral veins thrombosis as seen on recent lower extremity ultrasound.
Patient's right leg appeared quite swollen on presentation and an ultrasound was performed.
A CT torso was then performed which showed extensive clot burden with a large thrombus in the lower infrarenal IVC extending into the proximal bilateral common iliac veins.
A CXR revealed progressive accumulation of effusion and she requires a thoracentesis which drained 1.2 Liters of transudative effusion.
She was then able to be weaned to 2L oxygen to maintain her sats and was transferred back to the floor.
Given the need to decompress the patient's bile ducts to reduce the risk of cholangitis with a liver guided biopsy, an ERCP was performed [**5-14**].
On [**5-16**], patient underwent an IR guided liver biopsy without any complications.
Biopsy showed adenocarcinoma consistent with pancreatico-biliary origin.
She will need repeat thyroid studies in 6 weeks.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 392**] Rehabilitation & Nursing Center - [**Hospital1 392**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Cholangiocarcinoma DVT/PE Pleural Effusion  Secondary: Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
A filter was placed in your large vein to prevent further clots from reaching your lungs.
You also had a sample of tissue taken from your liver mass.
START Lasix 20mg by mouth daily CHANGED levothyroxine to 125mcg by mouth daily  You should also have thyroid studies checked in approximately 6 weeks.
