She responded to IV fluids and was easily weaned off her dopamine drip with her systolic blood pressures consistently in the 130s with concomitant transfer from the ICU to the medicine floor.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were drawn.
The urine culture was negative and the results of the blood culture are still pending at this time.
We did not find evidence for a cardiogenic etiiology of her hypotension since her cardiac enzymes were normal and there were not ECG changes.
The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiey was also considered by her electrolytes were normal making this less likely.
Upon completion of fluid resucitation and the maintenance of a stable of blood pressure, the patient was evaluated by PT and was considered to be safe to go home.
