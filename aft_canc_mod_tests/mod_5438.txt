The patient's home anti-hypertensive medications were resumed on POD#[**4-13**] once his pressures responded to fluids.
His ABG revealed evidence of hypercarbia and carbon dioxide retention post-op and he required re-intubation on POD#0.
Pulse oximetry was monitored closely and the patient maintained adequate oxygenation.
He had a CXR on POD#5 which showed some right lower lobe atelectasis, but otherwise was reassuring.
Serial abdominal exams were performed, and once flatus resumed, the patient was transitioned to a clear liquid diet and their IV fluids were hep-locked on POD#[**4-13**].
His WBC was elevated to 21, he spiked low grade temperatures and had new-onset tachycardiac (with stable EKG findings) which raised the concern for anastomotic leak or intra-abdominal bleeding.
On POD#4, an upright abdominal X-ray revealed no free air and a CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed only a simple peri-hepatic fluid collection with post-operative changes and no extravasation of contrast or perforation.
He was closely monitored with serial abdominal exams, which were reassuring.
GENITOURINARY: The patient's urine output was closely monitored in the immediate post-operative period.
The patient's intake and output was closely monitored for urine output > 30 mL per hour output.
The patient's creatinine was stable.
HEME: The patient's post-op hematocrit was stable and trended closely.
ID: Their white count was 21 post-operatively (POD#4) and their incision was closely monitored for any evidence of infection or erythema.
Blood and urine cultures were obtained for low grade temperatures.
Blood cultures revealed [**3-16**] bottle positive for gram negative rods which speciated E.coli that was pan-sensitive.
Blood glucose levels greater than 120 mg/dL were addressed with an insulin sliding scale.
