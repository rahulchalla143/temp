History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year old male with a 30 pack-year smoking history who had workup for some small volume hemoptysis that started in [**2136-12-6**] and was found to have a 2.8 cm right hilar mass seen on chest CT suspicious for malignancy.
In addition, on the CT scan the tumor appeared to encase the superior pulmonary vein and it was felt that the patient would likely require a pneumonectomy.
His preoperative staging showed no evidence of distant or nodal disease and his pulmonary function tests were acceptable for pneumonectomy.
