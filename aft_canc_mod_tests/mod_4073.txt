Presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2128-3-18**] with complaints of fevers, cough, headaches, decreased weight of approximately 9 pounds over the last four months, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.
On admission laboratories at [**Hospital1 **], she was found to be pancytopenic with a white blood cell count of 0.9, hematocrit 24.3, platelets 49 with differential 21% neutrophils, 3% bands, 65% lymphocytes, 10% atypical cells.
Absolute neutrophil count was 187.
While at [**Hospital **] Hospital, first few days of her hospitalization, she spiked a fever to 101.6 F.  She was started on ceftazidime and supportive blood products.
Chest and abdominal CT scans demonstrated marked splenomegaly and diffuse hilar lymphadenopathy with multiple pulmonary nodules.
Biopsy was consistent with positive B-cell antigen, positive DBA 44, and positive CD45 RO all consistent with hairy cell leukemia.
Sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli were negative x3.
However, blood cultures from [**3-23**] and several other subsequent blood cultures grew out atypical rapidly growing mycobacterium.
Skin biopsy by the Dermatology staff at [**Hospital1 **] showed pathology consistent with vasculitis and inflammatory infiltrates, mononuclear cells, and mixed eosinophils and rare neutrophils.
Infectious workup including a transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated no evidence of vegetations.
Interferon alpha 3 mIU subQ q Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
Central venous pressure was followed.
Skin biopsy and culture will be performed.
HTLV viral serologies were sent as well, which were negative.
She underwent repeat CT scan of the head, abdomen, and chest for staging purposes, which demonstrated extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
Also noted on these imaging studies were splenomegaly, anasarca, distended bladder.
CT scan of the head was within normal limits.
In light of the bladder distention and clonus on the neurological exam, she underwent a MRI of her complete spine, which showed only abnormal marrow consistent with leukemic infiltrate, but no evidence of cord compression, diskitis, osteomyelitis, or abscess.
PHYSICAL EXAM UPON ADMISSION TO THE BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT UNIT:  Vital signs showed temperature 100.6, blood pressure 120/60, heart rate 71, respiratory rate 18, and oxygen saturation 91-97% on room air.
Head and neck exam was normocephalic, atraumatic.
Jugular venous pressure was flat with no cervical lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac examination was regular, rate, and rhythm, S1, S2 heart sounds auscultated, no S3, S4, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Skin exam was remarkable for a desquamating erythematous papular rash with also plaque formation of her face, trunk, and extremities.
LABORATORY DATA:  Remarkable for complete blood count with WBC of 0.5 with ANC of 150.
Hematocrit 25.2, platelets 49.
Serum chemistries showed a sodium of 144, potassium 3.5, chloride 103, bicarbonate 37, BUN 5, creatinine 0.4, glucose 79, calcium 6.5, magnesium 1.9, phosphorus 2.4.
Liver function tests showed ALT 48, AST 18, alkaline phosphatase 191, total bilirubin 0.9.
Coagulation profile showed PT 15.1, PTT 31.4, INR 1.5.
She was initially treated supportively with blood transfusions to keep her hematocrit above 25 and platelets greater than 10.
She had a bronchoscopy during this admission that demonstrated submucosal tumor infiltration as well as chest imaging that was concerning for lymphangitic spread of her tumor.
She was cultured repeatedly for temperature spikes including cultures of her blood, urine, stool, sputum.
At the time of dictation up til [**2128-5-1**], all of these culture results were negative.
Her initial blood cultures that were positive at [**Hospital1 **] were evaluated by the [**State 350**] State Laboratory.
Therefore, linezolid, amikacin, moxifloxacin, and clindamycin were discontinued.
History of left upper lobe infiltrate with bronchus compression:  On transfer to [**Hospital1 188**] from [**Hospital1 **], patient had a CT scan, which demonstrated a left upper lobe infiltrate with bronchus compression.
Her hypoxia and subjective sense of breathing improved on this regimen.
Workup included HIV testing, which was negative, transthoracic echocardiogram, which is negative for vegetations.
CT scan of the sinuses, which demonstrated minimal mucosal thickening.
Bronchoscopy with brochialveolar lavage, which demonstrated submucosal infiltrating tumor, but no evidence of infection in any of the lavage samples.
Hypoxia:  On [**2128-4-29**], the patient had an episode of an acute desaturation going from 96% oxygen saturation on 2 liters nasal cannula to 80% on a 100% nonrebreather face mask.
Chest x-ray was concerning for possible acute respiratory distress syndrome and worsening of a left upper lobe pneumonia.
It was felt that a pulmonary embolus is possible, therefore the patient went for lower extremity ultrasounds, which are negative for DVT.
She responded to fluid boluses, and did not require intravenous pressor support.
She failed a cortisol stimulation test on [**2128-4-14**] and was started on hydrocortisone and Florinef.
At the time of this dictation up til [**2128-5-1**] her blood pressure was stable with hypotension resolved.
HTLV viral serologies were also evaluated and were negative.
Stool cultures are negative for any infectious etiology including Clostridium difficile.
A CT scan of the abdomen to rule out liver involvement including masses or abscess was performed that was negative.
Patient's transaminase enzyme levels decreased after discontinuation of AmBisome and her anti-tuberculosis medications.
