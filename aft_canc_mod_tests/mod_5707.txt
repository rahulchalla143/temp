Recently her bilirubin has been elevated and she has undergone several ERCP's with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] who was unable to remove all of the sludge distal to the stents.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a balloon catheter using a free-hand technique.
Cholangiogram showed partial stent occlusion with a normal right hepatic system.
Recurrence in [**2152-12-14**] with liver and lung metastasis.

Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a balloon catheter using a free-hand technique.
Cholangiogram showed partial stent occlusion with a normal right hepatic system.
[**6-21**] CXR There is a large mass (4.7 x 5.7 cm) at the left lung apex.
A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.
Dynamic blood pool images show increased uptake throughout possibly small bowel seen only in the delayed images (60-90).
[**6-25**] CT Abd/Pelvis: CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are multiple lung nodules at the lung bases.
The subcapsular mass in the lateral right lobe which previously measured 2.1 x 2.2 cm is now ill- defined, perhaps secondary to phase of contrast administration, but measures approximately 2.2 x 1.2 cm.
Lymph nodes within the porta hepatis, some with mucinous calcification are unchanged.
Cysts in the right kidney are also unchanged.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, bladder, and uterus are unremarkable.
[**6-30**] CXR IMPRESSION: 1.
The CT scan did not show progression of disease.
However, after multiple ERCP/IR procedures (detailed below), her bilirubin started to trend down by discharge.
- On [**6-18**], she underwent successful ERCP during which they dilated the distal CBD stent stenosis.
A bleeding scan suggested an upper-GI bleed.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and an EGD was performed which showed a slow bleed from around the site of entry of the CBD into the duodenum, thought to be secondary to prior procedures.
Her hct was stable and she did not require any transfusions during her hospital course.
CXR did not show a PNA and UA did not show a UTI.
On approximately [**6-27**], Vancomycin was stopped and she was switched to unasyn, based on sensitivities (her biliary fluid grew out enterococcus and K.
- On [**6-26**], IR performed another cholangiogram as her bilirubin was persistently elevated and her drains seemed only to be intermittently draining.
They stated that they could offer her a surgical procedure to attempt to provide better drainage but based on the fact that here bili began to trend down and her drains seemed to be working, she decided to defer surgery for now.
# Metastatic colon cancer: tx per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] covering initially and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] took over her care prior to D/c) - her colon cancer does not appear to be very agressive but she likely cannot receive any further chemotherapy [**2-15**] hyperbilirubinemia - [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] will continue to follow her bilirubin/CBC as an outpatient.
Outpatient Lab Work Total Bilirubin to be drawn every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
