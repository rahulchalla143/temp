She re-presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] [**2194-5-5**] for LLQ abd pain, nausea, dry heaves and lightheadedness and melanotic stools and was found to have GI bleed.
She subsequently had a syncopal episode while on the commode, and was transferred to the intensive care unit for SBP of 84.
She was transfused 2 units of PRBCs with post-transfusion crit of 23, was therefore transfused an additional 2 L PRBCs.
Blood pressure was stable with SBP greater than 100, upper endoscopy was negative therefore bleeding scan was performed and showed small bowel bleed.

CT enterography: IMPRESSION: 1.
Prior to transfer, endoscopy had failed to reveal a bleeding source, and a tagged RBC scan demonstrated that it was likely small bowel bleeding source.
She was hemodynamically stable on admission with a HCT of 27.
Massive transfusion protocol was activated, and she received 8 units of blood, 2FFP, 1 unit platelets.
Her HCT remained relatively stable thereafter requiring [**5-8**] one unit PRBC for HCT 28.
Conversations with radiology/GI suggested CT enterography to further elucidate the source of her bleed, which showed nonspecific findings s/p embolization procedure.
Serum chromogranin was sent and was within normal range.
Urine 5-HIAA could not be sent due to patient drinking tea and a special tube for serum serotonin was not able to be obtained.
Given her GI anatomy, routine iron studies were sent and detected low iron and B12/folate levels (likely secondary to malabsorption), so she was discharged with supplementation.
Her leukocytosis trended down over the hospitalization.
# Follow-up:  She will follow-up with Gastroenterology for further imaging studies in a few weeks following discharge.
One of the imaging tests revealed that the bleeding site was around one of the connections of bowels created during your gastric bypass surgery.
