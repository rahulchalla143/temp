On arrival to the ER, pt's HR was in the 140s with an SBP in the 70s.
After 2L of fluid, pt's SBP was still in the 70s so a femoral line was urgently placed for pressors.
He was then cardioverted with resumption of sinus rhythm and improvement of his SBP to 110s.

CT Abd/pelvis s IV contrast (po contrast only): 1.
TTE [**7-9**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old man with a history of metastatic colon cancer to liver s/p lobectomy, CAD s/p MI, and CVA with residual weakness who presented to the ED on [**7-16**] with fever, weakness, diarrhea; found to have BPs in the 70s with HR in the 140s.
He received 6L NS IVF resuscitation and transferred to the unit for further management.
Of note, he had a CT abd in the ED which showed diffusely edematous bowel edema c/w enterocolitis.
His stool output continued to worsen on [**7-20**], and the MICU was contact[**Name (NI) **] at 1900 regarding a BP of 62/P in a patient who had lost IV access.
A R SC line was urgently placed and patient received 1L IVF bolus which raised his BP to 110/68 prior to transfer to the ICU for further observation.
Placed CVL and given 2L NS resuscitation with improvement of BP to 110/68 prior to tx to ICU.
CVP 6cm.
HR the patient's diastolic dysfunction improved and BP remained stable.
c.dif toxin B was sent and is still pending.
Stool output tapered off but diarrhea did not completely resolve.
TTE showed a small LV cavity and hyperdynamic LV with EF>75% Patient initially appeared slightly volume overloaded on CXR but was intravascularly dry given hypotension, CVP of 6cm and response to IVF.
Urine lytes showed FeNa <1% consistent with prerenal azotemia.
His hypotension was not responding to IVF and the patient was started on pressors again to maintain SBP>90.
