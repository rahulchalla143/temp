Urine culture ([**4-17**]): no growth Surveillance blood cultures: BCx x 2 [**4-17**] - NGTD BCx [**4-18**] - NGTD Cath tip [**4-20**] - NGTD  Imaging Studies:  CT abdomen/pelvis ([**4-17**]):   CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the visualized thorax, there is a new small right pleural effusion with associated relaxation atelectasis.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is a right fluid-containing inguinal hernia (series 2, image 95).
CXR PA and LAT ([**4-17**]): CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Heart size, hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.
Duplex doppler ultrasound liver ([**4-17**]): RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver again demonstrates a coarsened echotexture, although without focal masses definitively identified.
DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: Color and Doppler ultrasound was used to evaluate the hepatic vasculature.
Blood cultures from ED grew out GNR which speciated as klebsiella that were pan sensitive.
A diagnostic paracentesis showed transudative fluid without evidence of SBP, his CXR showed no evidence of infection, and his UA was negative so no source was identified.
Surgery was consulted for a possible G or J tube placement but his CT scan was without obstruction, however he stated that he felt his ascites was hindering his po intake and given his recent infection surgical options were not further pursued.
Diagnostic paracentesis, as above, was consistent with transudate.
HIT Ab was sent and is pending, but he has a low likelihood of HIT.
His ventricular rate was well-controlled with fluid resuscitation.
# Guaiac positive stool: Hematocrit was initially slightly above baseline, appeared hemo-concentrated, and dropped from 34 to 28 after hydration.
Serial hematocrits showed stability in the high 20-low 30s, which is his baseline.
