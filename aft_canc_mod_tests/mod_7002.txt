She contact[**Name (NI) **] her PCP who requested [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CT scan which revealed a extra-axial midline mass.
She underwent stereotactic brain biopsy in early [**Month (only) 958**] and the lesion was found to be a meningioma.
[**5-4**] CT head - 1.
[**5-5**] MRI brain with and w/o contrast - 1.
There may be subtle diminished hypodensity of the white matter surrounding this hemorrhage, suggesting minimal edema without significant mass effect.The ventricles are unchanged in size compared to the prior study and are not enlarged.
The non-contrast CT of the head does not demonstrate new intracranial hemorrhage, new mass effect, or territorial infarction.
The CTV demonstrates patent internal cerebral veins, vein of [**Male First Name (un) 2096**] and the superior sagittal, transverse, and sigmoid sinuses.

She had her MRI and was extubated shortly there after.
Her diet was advanced and her exam improved as well.
On [**5-6**], the patient neurological exam was improved.
The corrected serum dilantin level 9.5 was 11.
The patient retained urine overnight and was straight cathed.
On [**5-8**], The ventricular drain was clamped at 0900.
The corrected serum dilantin level was 9.3 and a Dilantin bolus of 250mg intravenous was given.
A Head Ct with angiogram was obtained which demonstrated no change in size of the ventricles.
INR on Discharge is 1.1 and should be followed daily until she is therapeutic and then weekly while she is on coumadin.
