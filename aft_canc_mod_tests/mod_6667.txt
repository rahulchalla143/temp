Prior to his presentation, he reportedly had not had any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, or altered mental status.
An abdominal CT showed a 3 cm RUQ fluid collection at the distal tip of the VP shunt.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation given the concern for VP shunt infection.

There is a postoperative cavity in the left parietal lobe with blood products within it, which appears to be relatively stable in terms of size and mild associated enhancement.
[**2181-8-4**] CXR There are low lung volumes.
[**2181-8-6**] CT CHEST: 1.
[**2181-8-6**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT 1.
However, CT has significantly limited sensitivity in this regard, compared to MRI.
Further evaluation of tumor burden may be performed by MRI.
[**2181-8-8**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT The patient is status post right VP shunt removal with a small locule of air noted non-dependently within the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] in addition to a trace amount of likely post-surgical intraventricular hemorrhage noted dependently within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Mild mucosal thickening within the ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinus is stable as is partial opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2181-8-16**]):       1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):     FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):   Brief Hospital Course: #Hypercapnic respiratory failure - Secondary to COPD exacerbation in the setting of narcotic analgesia and aspiration pneumonitis.
Treated with mechanical ventilation followed by noninvasive ventilation, high-dose corticosteroid taper, nebulized bronchodilators, incentive spirometry, and antibiotics as above.
#RUQ fluid collection - Ultrasound-guided drainage of this collection at the OSH reportedly revealed purulent material, most likely an infected pseudocyst which formed at the distal site of the VP catheter.
Peritoneal fluid was not consistent with peritonitis and culture grew lactobacillus.
#Metastatic NSCLC - Most recent MRI [**2181-7-9**] showed stable metastatic disease in the cerebellum.
#HTN - The patient did not carry the diagnosis of hypertension prior to admission but had BP 160-180/80-100 in the setting of corticosteroid therapy.
Blood pressure should be closely monitored during steroid taper, and amlodipine may be decreased or discontinued accordingly.
Please call your physician or return to the Emergency Department if you experience fever, chills, sweats, dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, confusion, aversion to light, changes in vision, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, back pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, bloody or dark stools, leg pain or swelling, numbness, weakness, tingling, or falls.
