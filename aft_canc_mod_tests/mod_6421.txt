Imaging: Serial CT scans: CT W/CONTRAST [**2201-6-21**]: Inflammation associated with the duodenum, extending along the retroperitoneum.
CT ABD/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2201-6-22**] 6:04 PM: 1.
Regarding pancreatitis or renal pathology, recommend correlation with labs since this may be a secondary inflammatory process.
No conclusive evidence for perforation but given the inflammatory changes around the duodenum, the appropriate clinical setting, could consider a repeat scan in [**1-30**] hours to evaluate for extravasation and perforation.

Thrombosis of the left basilic vein with no upstream extension.
Most recent portable CXR [**2201-7-12**]: There are low lung volumes which slightly limits assessment, particularly in the lower lungs which have some associated volume loss.

This study done on [**2201-7-15**] at 03.43Am is available for review on [**2201-7-15**] at 9.30am and wet rea dwas given to the physician as mentioned above.

Labs On Discharge: [**Month/Day/Year 34887**]:  WBC 4.9 HBG 9.6* HCT 27.7* Platelets 377 COAGS:  PT 14.6* PTT  28.3 INR 1.3* Chem 7:  Gluc 91 BUN 16 Crn 0.8 NA 138 K 3.8 CL 101 HCO3 25  Brief Hospital Course: In brief, Mr. [**Known lastname 78266**] is a 49-year-old male with a history of APML s/p multiple rounds of chemotherapy who recently underwent MIDAM chemotherapy, being treated with ATRA and was admitted with febrile neutropenia and diarrhea and found to have GNR sepsis and duodenitis.
# Febrile Neutropenia, GNR sepsis: The patient was initially covered empirically with vancomycin, aztreonam, and flagyl with concern for a GI source given his recent diarrhea and history of anal fissures.
He had no respiratory or urinary symptoms on presentation and initial chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia.
Initial CT scan on [**6-21**] was concerning for duodenitis and the patient's antibiotic regimen was broadened to include ciprofloxacin and micafungin and [**5-2**] blood cultures from the previous day were positive for gram negative rods.
An abdominal ultrasound was obtained and showed no evidence of [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease or intrahepatic duct dilatation.
The patient's LFTs continued to rise during the day, his INR and PTT also rose, and additional labs were concerning for DIC.
A repeat CT scan in the evening with gastrograffin demonstrated increased inflammation, but negative for duodenal perforation.
As his lactate was rising and his platelets remained very low despite several transfusions in the context of a neutrophil count of 0, he was then taken to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
In route to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], a CT ABD was done which showed extensive inflammatory changes in the peritoneum and retroperitoneum.
The cause was unclear but thought perhaps to be related to his ATRA, which was held.
Repeat CT the following day showed progression of intra-abdominal free fluid and minimal change in the overall degree of intra-peritoneal stranding.
Blood cultures grew Proteus and E Coli from [**2201-6-20**].
Infectious work-up involved mini-BAL negative gram stain; multiple negative blood cultures and urine cultures; negative B-glucan and Aspergillus; C. Diff negative X 3; diagnostic para negative gram stain and cultures negative.
He was initially transfused to keep his platelets > 10K.
The patient was given protamine and vitamin K. Head CT showed small subarachnoid hemorrhage and Neurosurgery was consulted.
Repeat head CT the following day did not show change in the hemorrhage.
The patient should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] in 4 weeks with repeat head CT at that time.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of abdominal distension.
