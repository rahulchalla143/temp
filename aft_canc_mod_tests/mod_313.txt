In the ED, initial vs were: T 101.5 HR 88 BP 160/110 RR24 O2Sat:100.
A chest X ray showed an opacity so she was given ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.
She was sent for a CTA, which revealed a moderate pericardial effusion showing effusive constrictive pattern but no tamponade.
An echo was obtained which showed a moderate pericardial effusion without signs of tampenade.
Vitals prior to transfer were: 99 136/78 24 100% on 100% FiO2 BiPAP .
GERD 5. hemorrhoids 6. depression 7. sciatica  Social History: Non-smoker.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
The echo findings are suggestive but not diagnostic of pericardial constriction.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, mild fluid overload, small bilateral pleural effusions.
Large pericardial effusion, apparently new compared to chest radiograph [**2109-2-5**].
Focal opacity in the right lung apex, which appears to have been present on chest radiograph of [**2109-2-5**], and most likely reflects a scar.
However, serial chest radiographs could be considered to exclude indolent infection if warranted clinically.
# Acute leukemia: Patient's initial labs showed anemia, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis which was concerning for hematological malignancy.
Her diff showed 40 "other" cells which were eventually found to be blasts.
It was decided not to undergo a bone marrow biopsy and chemotherapy was not consistent with her goals of care.
She underwent bedside echo which confirmed this.
Pulsus paradoxus was not elevated at 10 mm hg and she had no evidence of hemodynamic compromise (although she did have transient hypotension in the ED that was responsive to a small bolus of IV fluids).
Given the presence of blasts on peripheral blood, and no ST changes on EKG or elevated troponin, it was thought that the effusion was most likely malignant.
Her chest x ray showed evidence of cardiomegally with widened mediastinum and cephalization of blood vessels and peribronchial cuffing consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.
# Hyponatremia: The patient was found to be hyponatremic on admission with sodium of 122.
Fena was 2.5 which did not support hypovolemic hyponatremia.
# Hyperkalemia: The patient was found to have an initial potassium of 5.6.
Her EKG showed no evidence of peaked T waves or prolonged PR or QRS.
It was thought that she may have pseudohyperkalemia in the setting of thrombocytosis (which corrects at 0.15 per 100K platelets above normal) however, hyperkalemia resolved while her platelets were still elevated which does not support this.
# Anemia: Hct was 27.9 which was 10 points lower than it was in [**1-8**].
Iron studies  were consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
Hemolysis labs were unimpressive.
The patient was monitored on telemetry and had no other events.

After discussion with hematology/oncology and your family, you decided that you did not want to pursue further testing or treating.
Your breathing improved and your blood pressure got better and you were safe for transfer to the medicine floor.
