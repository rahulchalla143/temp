CXR ([**12-10**])- Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
EEG ([**12-9**])- Largely normal EEG in the waking state.
MRI ([**12-9**])- Leptomeningeal deposit seen in the right high anterior frontal region and positive enhancement in the posterior portion of the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
These are new findings from the MRI on [**9-14**].
On the day of admission, the pt had come in for blood work.
Pt had a head CT which was negative for any acute process.
Pt had a CTA which was significant for interval development of multifocal areas of angiocentric ground glass attenuation predominantly in the upper lobes.
Her sat was 88% on 6L NC (had been 92% on 4L NC).
Pt was placed on a 7L face mask with an increase in her oxygen saturations to 90-93%.
She was given 40 mg IV Lasix after which she put out 1200 cc of urine in 30 minutes.
An ECG was checked but there were no changes.
CXR was obtained and showed an increase in bilateral fluffy infiltrates.
ABG was 7.52/26/57.
