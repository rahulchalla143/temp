Two weeks after discharge from [**Hospital6 1129**], he was admitted to an outside hospital in early [**2149-2-7**] with severe anemia with the hematocrit of 23.
The patient had inferior myocardial infarction with peak CK of 1000 in the setting of this GI bleed and anemia.
At that time he had a hematocrit of 26 and he was experiencing melena.
Catheterization at that time showed 100% chronic occlusion of his left circumflex with collaterals and 80% nondominant PDA lesion.
On echocardiogram, the patient was noted to have an EF of 45% to 55%, moderate MR, mild AR and inferior akinesis.
Colonoscopy at that time revealed polyps with tubular adenoma, which was excised.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 4419**] with a stable hematocrit on [**2149-3-13**].
Today, on the day of admission, the patient was receiving a blood transfusion for a hematocrit of 25 down from 30, when he developed chest pain and shortness of breath at approximately 3:30 p.m.
Blood pressure was noted to be 90/58, heart rate 56, 100% on two liters.
Blood pressure remained low in the ER in the 70s systolic.
EKG in the ER showed some ST changes inferiorly.
Blood pressure subsequently increased to a systolic in the 120s and the patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for possible MI/GI bleed.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45% to 50%.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife, came from [**Hospital3 4419**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following: Temperature 98.9, blood pressure 115/37, heart rate 65, respiratory rate 23, 98% on three liters.
HEENT:  Examination revealed normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils equal, round, and reactive to light, extraocular muscles are intact.
Anicteric neck, soft, supple, no JVD.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following: WBC of 16.2, hematocrit 25.5, platelet count 67,000.
Differential 79%, 14% lymphs, no bands.
Sodium 143, potassium 5.7, chloride 106, bicarbonate 26, BUN 64, creatinine 1.4, glucose 104, PT 13.4, PTT 26.0, CK 17, troponin less than .3, calcium 8.4, albumin 3.0, phosphate 5.0, magnesium 2.3.
Q-waves in 2, 3, AVF; .5-mm to 1-mm ST elevations in 2, 3, and AVF; 1-mm ST elevations in V1 through V3; biphasic Ts in 2, 3, and AVF; LVH by voltage criteria, and good R-wave progression.
Chest x-ray:  PA and lateral showed good inspiration, questionable mild congestive heart failure versus retrocardiac opacity.
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with cardiac enzymes negative times three.
The patient underwent stress test on [**2149-3-25**], which showed findings consistent with a likely fixed perfusion defect in the inferior wall, ejection fraction of 39%, global hypokinesis of the left ventricular wall.
Based on these findings, cardiac catheterization was deferred.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was initially evaluated by the GI team and it was felt that in light of recent endoscopy at [**Hospital6 1129**] that followup esophagogastroduodenoscopy would be performed in two to four weeks.
The findings from the endoscopy included moderate-to-severe distal esophagitis, erosions at the GE junction and erosions in the fundus of the stomach.
Then, on hospital day #2, the patient was transfused an additional two units to bring the patient's hematocrit above 30.
In addition, the patient was noted to have a thrombocytopenia of 57 and a hematology consultation was obtained.
Based on the hematology team's serial DIC, panels were sent and followed with the patient remaining in a low level of DIC.
Based on concern for a possible occult malignancy, CT of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained with the following findings: Bilateral adrenal masses, mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy; complex lesion of the left kidney, which is likely infarction; multiple lesions within the liver, which are likely cystic; small lobulated left pleural effusion; and bilateral DVTs.
Based on the findings of these adrenal and renal masses, a CT guided biopsy was arranged.
In addition, further recommendations of the oncology and radiology team that a CT of the chest be performed to also rule out a lung cancer primary with metastatic disease to the adrenals.
At the time of discharge, it was planned that the patient would receive the biopsy and the CT of the chest as an outpatient.
VASCULAR:  As from the CT showing bilateral DVTs, lower extremity Dopplers were obtained, the finding of which included a DVT of the left popliteal vein extending into the mid calf, but no evidence of a DVT in the common or the superficial femoral veins.
The patient was hydrated and with several units of transfusion periodically, the patient's creatinine improved to a baseline of 1.1 to 1.2.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT:  The patient is to followup at [**Hospital1 1444**] for CT-guided biopsy and CT of the chest on [**2149-4-11**].
