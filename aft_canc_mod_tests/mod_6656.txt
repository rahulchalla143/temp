She had been feeling well during the week prior to admission before having a temperature of 100.4 on [**8-2**].
She awoke [**8-3**] with a temperature of 102 F with chills as well as dizziness and "eyes burning."
In the ED temp 102.7, HR 124, BP 98/52, RR 20, O2 Sat 100% RA.
In the ED her lowest SBP was 86 and after fluid HR improved to 100. .
Bone marrow biopsy at that time revealed T-cells.

Because of bone marrow infarcts during her last cycle G-CSF was held and her counts dropped.
She later was treated with G-CSF and her counts improved.
However, her fevers returned and all her cultures were negative.
The second and third LP showed atypical cells that likely represented CNS disease.
After receiving high dose methotrexate she again began to have fevers and chills leading to another infectious work-up which was negative except for an enterococcal bacteremia (see below).
She also had slightly elevated liver enzymes so repeat MRI of the abdomen was obtained and showed no focal involvement of the liver.
Her brain MR was negative for focal findings but additional work up with lumbar punctures revealed CNS disease and required additional treatment with [**Hospital1 **] and intrathecal methotrexate on day 1 and high dose methotrexate on day 10.
Her blood pressure responded to fluid bolus of 1L NS.
A cortisol stim test was WNL on [**2148-8-6**].
Neuro-onc suspected neoplastic involvement of the nerve and MRI of the right arm did demonstrate this.
CT on [**8-14**] showed possible GB wall edema.
A further workup revealed a normal liver MR and her LFT's resolved.
A right upper extremity ultrasound on [**2148-8-22**] revealed a right cephalic vein thrombosis with no extension of time.
You also had paralysis of one nerve and a scan of this area revealed involvement of your lymphoma.
