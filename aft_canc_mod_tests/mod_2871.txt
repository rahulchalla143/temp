The  colonoscopy was finally done on [**2179-2-24**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who found several polyps which he resected and 1 mid sigmoid which was clipped at 40 cm appeared to have a cancer in the stalk and a pathological examination did prove this to be the case.
The descending, transverse, and ascending colon, and the 3 cm polyp, the one that was deemed to have malignancy in it by pathology was deemed suspicious for adenocarcinoma.
According to the exam by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] he stated that he was a big man, looking younger than his stated age with a weight of 210 pounds, blood pressure was 160/96, temperature was 96.8.
His heart rate  was 92.
He described his chest as barrel, his diaphragm moved 3-4 cm.
IMPRESSION:  Dr.[**Name (NI) 6275**] impression at the time of his office evaluation was carcinoma of the sigmoid colon, residual carcinoma, following polypectomy with a return, he would be admitted to hospital for sigmoid resection.
Postoperative check, the patient was afebrile 99.5, 98.8, 95, 140/64, 20, 97 percent on 2 liters, n.p.o.
His heart rate was 80, 110/70, 17, 95 percent on room air.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Their assessment was that the patient was a 78-year-old status post sigmoid colectomy who presented, that he was doing well, was ambulating, and needed follow up for transfer training and functional mobility and improved endurance.
The patient was 99.1, 98.8, 116/78, 78, 20, satting 93% on 2 liters at the time of urologic evaluation.
The patient's white count was 11.3, his hematocrit was 41.8.
CT from [**4-9**] was reviewed by them which showed multiple simple renal cysts.
His T-max was 99.2,  T-current was 97.4,96, 142/70, 20, 94% on 2 liters.
He was afebrile, 98.6, heart rate was 78, he was 124/80, and he was satting 93% on 2 liters.
He had made 1,550 cc of urine over the 24 hours.
His O2 sats were in the mid 80s.
Dentures were removed and given to the RN and a rapid sequence intubation was used, passed easily through the vocal cords.
His heart rate had gone up to 110 and at 5:00 p.m. he had another large loose stool and had reported increased weakness, increased shortness of breath, and his respiratory rate increased to approximately 40 and his heart rate to the 120s.
The patient was afebrile at the time of the event 97.1,  heart rate 120 though.
Blood pressure was low in 80 to 60 range and the patient's respiratory rate was 30 and he was satting between 87 and 94% prior to the EKG and ABG being performed.
After intubation the patient's oxygen saturation rose to approximately 97 %.
Chest x-ray was okay.
A- line was started and the patient was started on Levophed for hemodynamic support .The patient's ABG at the time of preparation for intubation was 7.34, 91, 27, 15, with a base deficit of 9.
Repeat ABG was 7.28, 34, 450, 17, and -9 and a lactic acid of 6.1.
There was concern for sepsis versus a potential pulmonary emboli, also vascular surgery was notified and an ultrasound was performed because there was a known history of a AAA.
Cardiology came and saw the patient, because the patient had acutely developed tachycardia, respiratory distress, and had continued to be hypotensive despite Levophed with blood pressure 73/88 in the ICU on pressor medications.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**], the attending surgery staff, evaluated the patient, gathered all the appropriate information and realized the patient was on pressors and his abdomen was distended and he had guarding and rebound and he wrote that barring some other septic foci which is not apparent at this time, it was likely that an anastomotic leak was the cause and recommended emergent exploration.
The procedure was an exploratory laparotomy  with a wash out and the patient was left with a left transverse colectomy and ostomy and drains were placed x4 and the abdomen was left open.
Postoperative day number zero on [**2179-4-19**], in the early morning in the ICU and postoperative day #6 from the original surgery, the patient's temperature is 101.1 T-max, current was 95.8.
He was 113/67 and had sustained pressures as low as 89/57 overnight.
Pulmonary artery pressure was 34/14.
His CVP was 15.
His gas was 7.11,39, 271,13 -16.
He was on AC 100 percent, tidal volume was 650, rate of 25, PEEP of 5.
His white count was 7.5.
His hematocrit was 38.
His lactic acidosis had come down from 9.7 to 7.6.
Cardiac, check enzymes and attempt to wean Levophed when able.
His Apache score was described as 32.
Procedure performed was an exploratory laparotomy and completion total colectomy, abdominal washout, omentectomy, and end ileostomy creation.
