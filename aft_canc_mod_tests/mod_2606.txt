The patient is status post local excision and sentinel node biopsy in [**2184-8-17**], status post needle biopsy with emergent craniotomy at [**State 792**]Hospital in [**2187-8-17**], status post gamma knife radiosurgery on [**2187-10-25**].
He went to his dermatologist who performed a biopsy and amelanotic melanoma at site of vaccination on his right shoulder was found.
A local wide excision and sentinel node biopsy was performed and a lymphoscintigraphy was performed on the morning of surgery which revealed no uptake in the nodal areas other than the right axilla.
His primary care physician recommended [**Name Initial (PRE) **] head CT and MRI of the head which was performed on [**2187-9-14**] which was an MRA and revealed a 2.8 by 2.8 by 3 cm left frontal hemorrhagic mass with a large vasogenic edemic area.
A CT scan of the brain the next day confirmed a hemorrhagic mass in the left frontal region measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.
The patient had a needle biopsy and when this procedure was performed, a hemorrhage was found and an emergent craniotomy was performed.
Chest CT was performed on [**2187-9-25**] which revealed suspicious nodules on the right lung, one measuring about 1 cm in diameter, the other 8 mm.
In the meantime, the patient had follow-up with a brain MRI at [**Hospital 792**]Hospital to ensure eligibility for the I-[**Doctor First Name **] trial.
The MRI was done the next day and was inconclusive for recurrence versus post gamma knife changes.
He was taken on [**2187-12-11**] to [**State **]Hospital where a spiral CT was performed to rule out pulmonary embolus.
On the day of admission, shortly after waking up at 5:00 a.m., he had sharp stabbing pain which seemed to originate in his abdomen and spread upwards to his chest and neck.
Vital signs:  Temperature 97.0, pulse 83, blood pressure 120/70, respiratory rate 16, saturating 98% on room air.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Initially during his hospitalization, however, and while getting chemotherapy, the patient developed temperature spikes and chest radiograph was consistent with a right lower lobe pneumonia.
The patient had a CTA of the chest which revealed the following:  Pulmonary-no intraluminal filling defects and heart great vessels were unremarkable.
Differential considerations include congenital versus traumatic versus neoplastic.
An MR of the head was performed and revealed the following:  Status post left frontal craniotomy, an irregular peripherally enhancing mass extending from craniotomy into the left frontal white matter and the superior aspect of the left basal ganglia including caudate nucleus.
His blood cultures were pending at the time of dictation.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Electrolytes were repleted p.r.n.
