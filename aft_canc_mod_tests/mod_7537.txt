ECHO had shown newly depressed LVEF of 30-35% with akinesis of the apex and distal LV.
Repeat ECHO showed probably (suboptimal quality) normal LV systolic function wtih EF of 50-55%.
At OSH, initial VS were: T 100.3, BP 167/77, HR 98, RR 22, 93% on RA.
Exam was sig.
CXR was red as no infiltrates, no CHF.
WBC was 15.6, 84% neutrophils, 6% lymphocytes.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vital signs were: afeb, 102, 170/100, 30, 97 on 3L.
for bibasilar rales, expir wheezes, and 1+ pitting pedal edema.
for WBC of 15.1, CK 92, TropT 0.06, BNP 4000.
EKG showed STD in V4-6.
CXR showed ?RLL infiltrate.
Currently, VS are 111/59, 104, 38, 94% on RA.
UOP of 500cc of urine.
He underwent biopsy of this on [**2200-1-3**], and pathology showed high-grade aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, staining positive for CD20, bcl-2, and bcl-6 in a small subset.
Cells were negative for cytokeratins, CD138, bcl-1, and |bcl-6.
MIB fraction was 95-100%.
Bcl-2 co-expression and lack of CD10 argued against Burkitt's lymphoma; however, FISH studies were positive for c-myc rearrangement.

ECHO [**4-23**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably normal (LVEF 50-55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-4-21**], the LVEF has probably improved (suboptimal image quality and distal LV/apex porrly seen on current study).
If clinically indicated, a repeat study with echo contrast (dDefinity) may help evaluate regional and global LV systolic function.
CTA chest [**4-20**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Perhaps slight decrease in size of cardiac mass compared to CT from [**2200-3-26**], with persistent mass effect on superior vena cava.
STD in V4-V6 and TWI in V3-V6, new since [**2200-4-21**].
ECHO [**2200-4-30**] Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-4-23**], image quality has improved.
In addition, he likely had a component of acute on chronic CHF given sxs of orthopnea, increasing pedal edema, and elevated BNP.
Repeat ECHO actually showed resolution of Takosubo physiology with improvement in patient's LVEF.
On CXR there was no evidence of new infiltrate however due to symptoms of productive cough he was started on treatment for HAP with vanco/zosyn.
Blood and sputum cutlure showed no growth.
His BP had then improved, and he was observed overnight without issue and transfered back to the floor.
EKG showed STD in V4-6.
Cardiac enzymes continued to trend down from last hospitalization.
Your blood pressure improved with fluids and a unit of blood.
