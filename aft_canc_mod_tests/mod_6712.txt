The pt was found to have HR 148 BP 138/81 FSG 149 satting 100% NRB.
He was noted to be combative with staff with intermittent confusion, responsive to painful stimuli and opened eyes spontaneously.
Labs showed hct 34, wbc 11.9, cr 1.9, trop 0.11.
CXR showed increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs, potentially due to interstitial edema with more discrete consolidation at the lung bases, potentially atelectasis however developing infiltrate could also be considered.
Head CT with no acute intracranial process.

Imaging:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2199-2-28**] 4:35 PM IMPRESSION: Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs, potentially due to interstitial edema with more discrete consolidation at the lung bases, potentially atelectasis however developing infiltrate could also be considered.
Two-view chest x-ray may offer additional detail.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2199-2-28**] 4:59 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
TTE ([**2199-3-5**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The LV ejection fraction appears markedly depressed (20 percent) secondary to a combination of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate, ventricular interaction with a pressure- and volume-overloaded right ventricle, and possible intrinsic left ventricular contractile dysfunction.
Renal US ([**2199-3-7**]): 1.
Bilateral hydroureter and mild fullness of the right collecting system.
Upon arrival to the ICU, the dilt gtt was stopped and HR was better controlled with IV metoprolol.
We did not pursue pre-amiodarone lung function tests or thyroid tests given that his prognosis is poor and the lung/liver/thyroid toxicity from amiodarone are a concern with longer-term theray.
The pt had a CT head in the ED that ruled out acute bleed.
In [**2194**], he was noted to have an EF ranging from 10-30% int he setting of poorly rate controlled AF, tought to be tachyarrhythmia induced cardiomyopathy.
[**Name2 (NI) **] appeared only mildly volume overloaded on exam and was satting well on room air.
He will have his electrolytes checked Thursday [**2199-3-15**] and his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
# Neutropenia: After transfer to the cardiology service and approximately 7-8 days after his second cycle of doectaxel, his WBC trended down with an ANC nadir of 325 on [**3-8**].
# Displaced nephrostomy tubes: On HD8, the patient noted that he partially dislodged his left nephrostomy tube, urine output was noted toslow after this happened.
Renal US showed that both tubes were out of the renal collecting systems.
Creatinine this admission was initially stable in the 1.9-2.2 range and his colchicine was held because GFR was less than 30.
His urine output was low (400-500cc per day) towards the end of this admission but was trending up after his obstruction resolved.
#Code status this admission: FULL CODE (confirmed with patient)  #Transitional issues -Will have Chem-7 checked Thursday [**2199-3-15**] at rehab to monitor lytes and BUN/Cr, results faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] (PCP) -Tolerating HR up to the 130s if he is asymptomatic, he is in the process of being loaded with amiodarone for rhytm control -Urine output has been low since he is recovering from obstructive uropathy after his nephrostomy tubes were displaced, he has been making 200-500cc urine per day, left nephrostomy tube always makes more than right -Will need repeat TTE after HR well controlled to assess for recovery of systolic function -Patient was not requiring a fentanyl patch at discharge, pain was controlled with oxycodone, tylenol and Lidoderm patch.
We decided to start a medication called amiodarone which will help slow your heart rate as well as help keep you in a regular rhythm.
We discussed with you that while there is a risk of stroke by converting you from atrial fibrillation into regular rhythm without blood thinners, however our team felt this was the best option for managing your fast heart rate after discussing with you, your daughter, your cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5858**], and your oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
An ultrasound showed that both tubes were outside the kidneys.
