Her [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome is positive.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99, blood pressure 145/79, heart rate 80, saturation 100%.
General physical exam is unremarkable.
Mental status exam - she is mildly inattentive.
MRI obtained at the time of admission showed multiple small acute and subacute infarcts.
She had diffusion weighted imaging restriction in several areas of her left middle cerebral artery distribution following both the cortical and subcortical region, some of which were also positive on FLAIR, indicating a subacute presentation.
Head MRI shows a flow signal graph in the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries bilaterally, loss of flow signal in both proximal and middle cerebral arteries, left greater than right, with occlusive disease suggested in the bilateral internal carotid arteries.
MRA imaging of her carotid arteries was also performed on [**3-4**] which showed no evidence of high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis.
On exam on [**3-2**], she was started on a heparin drip because of concerns for arterial stenosis.
Cranial nerve exam was significant for a very mild right facial weakness.
The EEG shows persistently focal, moderately severe slow wave abnormality in the left hemisphere, but no clear epileptiform discharges.
She also had an echocardiogram obtained on [**3-2**] which showed a very tiny patent foramen ovale which was present at rest.
Her ejection fraction was greater than 55% and was normal.
As the patient improved, a bedside swallowing evaluation was obtained on [**3-9**].
Because the patient's hematocrit dropped and was low during this admission, she did require a transfusion of packed red blood cells.
A bleeding study was done with technetium-99 and showed that there was no evidence of acute GI hemorrhage, but GI was consulted and would like to see her in follow-up for a GI endoscopy.
Her stools were guaiac positive, and she was put on Protonix prophylaxis while she was here, which should be continued while she is on any sort of blood thinners because of this history of GI bleed.
The patient's heparin drip was adjusted with a goal to keep the PTT between 50 and 70 with frequent checks.
Ideally, we would like to keep her blood sugar in the 130-150 range.
A PT and OT evaluation suggested that the patient will benefit most from acute level rehab, to improve on her motor skills prior to returning to her house.
