She was doing well until [**2157**] when she was admitted for work-up of a left lower lobe mass.
LN Biopsy revealed an anthracotic node and lung wedge bx showed only patchy areas of scarring and bronchial metaplasia, with no malignancy identified in either tissue.
Biopsy revealed findings  c/w diffuse large B cell lymphoma with high-grade features, given the proliferation fraction of ~90%.

Exam was not tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region, but no  substantial changes are identified in the upper abdominal region on this  limited assessment with persistent atrophy of the superior pole of the left kidney.
Echocardiogram [**2165-9-24**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=30 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-9-17**] (outpatient), the pericardial effusion is slightly larger.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Abdominal Ultrasound ([**2165-9-25**]): 1.
Enhancing lesion noted on prior CT suggestive of a hemangioma does not display son[**Name (NI) 493**] characteristics to support this diagnosis.
If a more definitive diagnosis is needed, a dedicated MRI abdomen with BOPTA contrast would be recommended.
MRI of the abdomen [**2165-10-2**]: There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, which are also seen on the recent CT. Anasarca is present.
There is a 2- mm probable cyst in the left lobe of the liver on series 1603, image 15, which is probably present on the previous MRI.
Pleural based 1 cm nodule in the right lower lobe is stable since the CT of [**2162-2-23**].
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations delineated the dynamic series with multiple perspectives.
MRI head [**2165-10-2**]: There is diffuse mild pachymeningeal enhancement, which is new since the prior MR study of [**2165-4-22**].
A vague area of enhancement in the left cerebellar hemisphere on the axial spin echo post-contrast images reflects pulsation artifacts and has no correlate on the FLAIR sequences.
The MP-RAGE post-contrast images are limited due to motion artifacts.
Echocardiogram [**2165-10-3**]: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
USG of left arm [**2165-10-5**]: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, and brachial veins were obtained.

Infectious, obstructive and cardiac etiologies were considered.
Ms. [**Known lastname 95142**] required ICU care for invasive monitoring and pressure support.
When patient stopped spiking high-grade temperatures and her intravascular volume was repleted she improved and we were able to re-start spironolactone (25mg QD) and carvedilol (3.125 mg [**Hospital1 **]).
Patient had CXR showing bilateral pleural effusions (R>L) that were tapped and showed a transudate by lights criteria and were negative for infectious agents and malignant cells.
Blood cultures, including mycolytics were negative.
Toxoplasma titer was IgM positive and IgG negative in the setting of multiple blood transfusions.
Patient had EBV viral load of 400, which went up to 1000 in teh setting of steroid administration in the ICU and down to 400 afterwards.
Patient was negative for HSV-6, CMV, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Histoplasma, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, Brucella, head sinuses cultures (fungal, viral and bacterial) and stool studies as well.
Patient was evaluated by ENT for sinusitis and pt also had negative LP (WBC 3, normal protein and glucose with negative cultures).
She had vaious epiosdes of neutropenic fevers, which were treated with meropnem.
CMV, HSV were negative and HIV is pending (will need follow up).
Sinusitis: MRI showed signs of sinusitis/inflammation as well as CT scan.
Repeat CT shwoed congestion in right maxillary sinus and patient was re-cultured.
patient required multiple RBC transfussions as well as HLA-matched platelets to fullful our targets of HCT >25 and PLT >10,000.
Patient was discharged with stable HCT of  28.7 and PLT of 32,000 with CBC scheduled for 1 day after discharge.
CVD: Patient was followed by echocardiogram and her EF was stable from her baseline at 30-35% with moderate to severe left global hypokinesis.
Diarrhea: Patient with diarrhea 1 week prior to discharge and was c diff negative x3.
However, since she was so fragile and her ANC up and down it was decided to give her a 2 week course of PO vancomycin.
TSH was 2.8.  .

Lab draw Please do on Fri [**2165-10-25**] CBC with differential and absolut neutrophil count, chem-7 and fax to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 51492**].
A bone marrow biopsy showed similar findings that before, compatible with Myelodysplastic syndrome.
Your blood pressure was very low and your fevers very high suggesting sever infection.
Your echocardiogram was unchanged, but still shows some fluid around your heart.
You also had an MRI and CT of your sinuses.
All cultures were negative.
