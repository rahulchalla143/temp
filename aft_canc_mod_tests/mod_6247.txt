MRI Head [**11-26**]: IMPRESSION: Approximately 3 x 3.5 cm intraventricular mass attached to the septum pellucidum with characteristics as described above.
Other changes as described above, specifically, decrease in size of the ventricles compared to the previous CT after interval placement of the bifrontal intraventricular drains.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**11-26**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Further evaluation with MRI can be performed if needed.
EKG [**11-28**]: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2163-11-25**] no change.

Head CT [**12-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CxR [**12-8**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-7**], the Dobbhoff tube has been somewhat pulled back with the tip just distal to the esophagogastric junction.
CT head [**2163-12-23**]: Bifrontal ventricular catheters are again noted with little change in position.
Head CT was peformed, which revealed a large intraventricular mass, with resultant obstructive hydrocephalus.
She subsequently had CT of her torso which was unremarkable for primary disease identification.
She underwent stereotactic brain biopsy on [**11-30**], and final pathology identified a WHO grade IV glioblastoma multiforme.
She was discussed at brain tumor conference and the decision was made to place a Rickham reservoir due to her enlarged temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], which was placed on [**12-19**].
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Ten (10) mL PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
You will also need an MRI around the time of your appointment on [**2164-1-23**] - you will be contact[**Name (NI) **] with this appointment time at a later date.
