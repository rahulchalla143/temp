CT of the abdomen at OSH ([**2192-5-15**]) showed a 5.5cm right renal tumor with extension into the renal vein and IVC.
- MRI of the abdomen at OSH ([**2192-5-21**]): Thrombus locally intrusive into the IVC but does not extend up to the hepatic area or right atrial area.
She went to an emergency room there and was found to have an elevated D-dimer, and on CAT scan was found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli.
She was then admitted to [**Doctor Last Name 63883**]Hospital and was begun on anticoagulation and further work-up proceeded.
However, she had a CAT scan of the abdomen that showed a 5.5 cm right renal mass with extension to the renal vein and inferior vena cava.
She also had a PET scan there that was noted to show some increased uptake in the hilum of the left lung.
An MRI of the head was also performed that was found to be unremarkable and to show no signs of metastases.
She was anticoagulated at the outside hospital, and her INR was noted to be therapeutic upon her discharge and transfer to [**Hospital6 256**].
The INR was 2.3 at this time.

In the operating room, the patient received 4600 cc of crystalloid, 14 units of red blood cells, 6 units of FFP, 1 unit of platelets, 750 cc of albumin.
Chest radiography was obtained and confirmed good re-expansion of lungs without pneumothorax, and atelectasis at the bases bilaterally.
On discharge, INR was 1.2 after one dose of 2mg and one dose of 5mg.
[**Last Name (STitle) 63886**] in [**State 1727**] this Friday for INR measurement and adjustment of her anticoagulation.
Alternate coumadin dose between 5 mg and 7.5 mg and have Dr. [**Name (NI) 63887**] office check your INR on Friday, [**6-8**].
Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 63886**] to check your blood pressure.
