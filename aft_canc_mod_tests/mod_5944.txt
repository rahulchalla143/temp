[**2138-8-6**] Neurophysiology EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal waking EEG because of generalized slowing and infrequent generalized slow sharp waves.
She continued to have significant blood drainage from JP over first 12-24 hours, which subsequently decreased.
Hematocrit was checked every 6 hours initially until blood volume stabilized.
Patient was transfused as needed to keep HCT >10.
She was given fluid boluses to maintain a MAP over 65 and blood pressures improved.
Volume status and electrolytes were monitored.
These medications were restarted after volume resuscitation as systolic blood pressures increased to a max of 200.
Hemodyalysis was performed the following day and systolic blood pressures improved.
Information was obtained from Patient.
