# Increase in LFTs: Initial labs with AST elevated from baseline and ALT at baseline, this was associated with an elevated LDH and total bilirubin.
RUQ ultrasound revealed non-occlusive portal vein thrombus.
#Acute Kidney Injury: Baseline creatinine of 0.9 though discharged most recently at 0.6.
Initially presented to ED with creatinine of 1.4.
Renal ultrasound ruled out obstruction, leading to concern for HRS vs. ATN.
#Hyponatremia: Baseline sodium in low 130's, admitted with value of 127.
Diuretics were held, Albumin challenge given and she was free water restricted with a low Na diet.
# UTI:  UA positive for UTI, culture pending.
