A head CT on [**2186-5-15**] was negative, but a head MRI on [**2186-5-18**] demonstrated multifocal signal abnormalities scattered throughout the cerebral sulci, with no evidence of septic emboli.
A torso CT on [**2186-5-19**] demonstrated bilateral ill-defined nodular densities within the lungs, a moderate-sized hiatal hernia, and unusual appearance of thickened folds within the proximal small bowel.
A repeat CT on [**2186-5-23**] demonstrated interval worsening of multiple patchy areas of ground-glass opacity and multiple ill-defined bilateral nodular densities within the lungs and bilateral pleural effusions consistent with an infectious/inflammatory process.
A CT on [**2186-6-6**] demonstrated bilateral pulmonary emboli, involving the left upper, left lower and right lower lobe.
Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate were performed, and results were consistent with ALL (Ph negative, positive for translocation 4:11.
She had a troponin leak to 0.09 in this setting (again, thought to be in the setting of tachycardia.
A CT on [**2186-6-3**] demonstrated a focal filling defect within a segmental branch of the right main pulmonary artery in the right lower lung zone, which represented a segmental pulmonary embolism.
The morning after the PE was discovered, the patient became acutely hypoxic and had a brief episode of hypotension.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] again, and BP improved with fluids.
A CT on [**2186-6-6**] demonstrated bilateral pulmonary emboli, involving the left upper, left lower and right lower lobe, which was felt to be a possible etiology for her worsening respiratory status.
CXR was felt to be possibly c/w fluid overload, and the pt was given over 120mg IV lasix and UOP was more than 6L, but she remained with worsening respiratory status on BiPAP.
