1) Sepsis/ Cholangitis: In the emergency department, he was hypotensive to the 70s systolic despite 4L IVF and his WBCs were found to be 21.
A central line was placed for administration of fluids after which time his blood pressure improved to 127/4.
After his transfer, he was afebrile and his blood pressure remained stable with a systolic blood pressure on the low 100s.
An ERCP was performed which revealed a previously placed biliary metal stent whic was blocked with debris and sludge.
Previous FNA biopsies have been unrevealing and current metal stent preclues a biopsy with subsequent ERCP.
He has been seen by surgeon Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] who deemed the mass unresectable on the basis of CT findings of a pancreatic head mass causing near complete encasement and narrowing of the superior mesenteric vein and abutting both the portal venous confluence, as well as the duodenum.
His metoprolol was initially witheld due to hypotension but was restarted upon transfer to the floor.
You were admitted to the intensive care unit and started on medications to control your blood pressure.
You had an ERCP which showed blockage in the stent in your bile duct.
