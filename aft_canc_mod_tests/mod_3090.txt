The patient's biopsies at that point demonstrated high grade PIN, but no evidence of malignancy.
Following examination by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 365**], patient was deemed to be a suitable candidate for radical prostatectomy and was subsequently scheduled for elective prostatectomy on [**2200-3-31**].
Patient's intraoperative urine output was approximately 300 cc.
Following the procedure, the patient was deemed stable for transfer to the PACU for further evaluation and therapy.
Postoperative laboratories were unremarkable including a hematocrit of 33.5.
Measured blood pressure at the time of unresponse is 60/palp; O2 saturation was noted to be 85%.
The patient was subsequently intubated and aggressively resuscitated with volume, after which point, he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further care.
Although the patient's pressure and heart rate was noted to improve following resuscitated, subsequent hematocrit checks demonstrated divergent reports ranging from 24-15.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, and was subsequently transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.
On subsequent postoperative check, the patient was noted to be afebrile and stable with a blood pressure of 108/73 and a heart rate of 87.
Due to an initial arterial blood gas demonstrating blood pH of 7.32, the patient remained intubated postoperatively, and was subsequently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit team.
Serial hematocrit checks on postoperative day #1, demonstrated a diminution in hematocrit from 28 to 24, instigating the transfusion of 2 additional units of packed red blood cells on postoperative day #1.
Subsequent hematocrit checks demonstrated an appropriate hematocrit response.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable throughout the duration of his stay.
A followup CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was negative for any evidence of additional bleeding or perforation.
The patient remained afebrile with vital signs stable and was successfully advanced to a full regular diet through [**2200-4-5**] at which point his JP drain was successfully removed without complication and he was cleared for discharge to home.
