On HD2 pt underwent rigid bronchoscopy with airway biopsies which showed no evidence of tumor (only inflammation) at the hilum.
Despite vanc and zosyn for pneumonia, pt continued to spike fevers, but all cultures were negative.
PFT's and quantitative V/Q scan suggest 75% of function remains in left lung, which implies adequate reserve to tolerate resection and pneumonectomy.
ECHO was negative for mitral or aortic valve vegetations.
UGI showed a 2mm left-sided esophageal diverticulum seen approximately at C6 level, but no obstruction or stricture.
As expected, his Cr rose secondary to acute pre-renal failure.
Vanc levels were checked daily and dosed as needed.
Renal US was negative for hydronephrosis.
His urine output continued to be adequate.
On POD1, the chest tube was removed and post-pull CXR was negative for PTX.
By POD 10 pt was stable and discharged home in stable condition with VNA services, evaluation of home services, specifically physical therapy.
