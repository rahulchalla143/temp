He was initially evaluated at [**Hospital1 **] where a non-contrast CT of the head demonstrated a small right subdural hematoma.
He was admitted to the geriatrics service for evaluation of syncope (as a potential cause of the fall).
He apparently went downstairs to the front desk in his pyjamas at about 6 am on the morning of evaluation to seek help (although the details are unclear).
The family, instead, contact[**Name (NI) **] the PCP who coordinated an outpatient non-contrast CT of the head.
He was referred to the ED when the imaging showed acute progression of hemorrhage, which is now bilateral and associated with sulcal effacment and shift.
Osteoarthritis 8.
Pulmonary: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
* V: Facial sensation intact to light touch in the V1, V2, V3 distributions.
Pupils 2.5 to 2 with light bilatterally.
Motor exam has varied over his course (some volitional component) but today has [**6-15**] in bilateral deltoids, triceps, and biceps.

It is less dense and slightly smaller in size compared to most recent study on [**2186-9-27**].
The subarachnoid hemorrhage seen in the left temporal lobe on prior study is unchanged in appearance.
A routine EEG was done that showed EEG seizure activity (no clear clinical correlate) for which the patient was started on Keppra 250mg po bid (renally dosed).
