Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Hickman placement-changed over wire on [**2200-8-19**] Chemotherapy Stem cell infusion Bronchoscopy Intubation x2   History of Present Illness: This is a 65 year old woman with recurrent large cell lymphoma first diagnosed in [**6-10**], s/p 6 cycles of R-CHOP in [**12-12**], recurrence in fall of [**2198**], s/p ICE x 3 and ESHAP ([**1-13**]).
She was recently discharged from our [**Month/Year (2) 3242**] for auto-[**Month/Year (2) 3242**] in [**3-13**] (CBV), but showed residual disease on PET with a large retroperiotneal mass (bx c/w follicular lymphoma).
Patient was seen by her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had a biopsy of the node c/w non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type, and underwent therapy with R-CHOP, with six cycles completed in [**2198-12-8**].
After completion of her ICE, patient had a PET scan performed, which showed presence of persistent disease, with no change in aortocaval lymph nodes and increased uptake in the parotid area.
Hydration, antiemetics, and supportive care were give per [**Month/Year (2) 3242**] protocol.
A repeat PET scan revealed a large retroperitoneal mass (bx c/w follicular lymphoma).

Radiology: CXR ([**2200-6-11**]): The heart size is normal.
[**7-27**] CXR - Diffuse bilateral hazy patchy opacities with blunting of diaphragms and CP angles.
[**7-25**] CXR - There is increasing radio opacity generally overlying a background of micro nodular opacities suggesting some pulmonary edema.
As far as I can see, there has been no CT for the evaluation of questions of small lung nodules raised on prior interpretations of plain radiographs since [**7-7**].
Tip of a left supraclavicular central venous dual channel catheter projects over the SVC.
CT chest [**7-27**]: Diffuse confluent ground-glass and airspace opacities are seen within the entire lungs bilaterally, with peripheral sparing at the lung bases.
Diagnostic considerations include diffuse infectious process from fungal or atypical etiologies, ARDS, or alveolar hemorrhage.With the absence of effusions, failure is thought to be less likely.
TTE [**7-7**]: EF 55%.
TTE [**2200-8-4**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably grossly normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-7-7**], mitral regurgitation is probably slightly increased.
Chest CT [**2200-8-13**]: Significant interval improvement of diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities; given the current CT findings and prior comparison studies, findings may represent partially resolving alveolar hemorrhage or ARDS.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: There are faint diffuse ground-glass opacities bilaterally, but much improved from [**2200-8-13**].
Again seen is a soft tissue mass encasing the right renal hilum extending to the right psoas muscle, which is not well evaluated on this non-contrast study but has decreased in size compared to [**7-29**], [**2199**].
CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The rectum is normal.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 65 year old woman with recurrent NHL, first diagnosed with large cell lymphoma in [**6-10**], s/p 6 cycles of R-CHOP in [**12-12**], recurrence in fall of [**2198**], s/p ICE x 3 and ESHAP ([**1-13**]), s/p auto-[**Month/Year (2) 3242**] in [**3-13**], found to have new lymphoma by PET (bx c/w follicular lymphoma) and radiation, admitted to [**Date Range 3242**] unit for reduced intensity-allogenic [**Date Range 3242**].
She underwent allo-[**Month/Day (4) 3242**] with day 0 [**2200-6-18**].
Eventually discontinued due to toxicity - MTX 10mg/m2 IVB day +1, +3, +5 - GCSF 300mcg/day started on day +6, discontinued when ANC was >1000 - Patient was on cyclosporin [**Hospital1 **] dosing, discontinued due to DAH thought to be [**1-9**] cyclosporin - ANC started trending up on [**7-5**], now engrafted ANC 3880 [**2200-8-29**] - CT on [**8-27**] showed interval decrease in size of mass.
# Fever- Her post-[**Name (NI) 3242**] course was relatively uneventful until [**6-27**], when she started spiking fevers with unclear source.
started Cefepime, continued on Fluconazole, and acyclovir; spiked again on [**7-1**], vanc started; spiked again on [**7-2**], vori started; spiked [**Last Name (un) 59331**] on [**7-2**] and [**7-3**] am, new non-blanching petechia noted on [**2200-7-3**],  flagyl started on [**7-3**]; continued to spike on [**7-4**] to 103.5, a hypotensive episode on [**7-4**] am, responsive to IV fluids (500ml resuscitation), BP stabilized throughout the day, received >4gm tylenol for fever, rash worsened, CXR clear, RUQ showed no evidence of VOD; [**7-5**]: Rash worse on the chest, face and arms, GVHD vs drug rash, d/C'ed cefepime, and started aztreonam; Cxs continued to be negative to date, CXR has been clear to date, currently on Aztreonam, vanc, acyclovir (PO per ID), vori, flagyl, chest CT (non contrast) on [**7-5**] showed no evidence of infections .
On [**7-7**] she became dyspnic and febrile, and CXR demonstrated new central bilateral ground glass and alveolar opacities suggestive of pulmonary edema vs. engraftment syndrome.
She was then found to have diffuse alveolar hemorrhage by bronchoscopy on [**7-10**].
CSA was held given possible DAH [**1-9**] this.
Initially on the floor the patient continued to require 4L NC to maintain sats in 90s and with diuresis she was eventually weaned off oxygen.
CT chest on [**8-13**] showed significant improvement in her intersitial disease.
Renal duplex to check for renal artery stenosis was performed [**8-10**] but was a suboptimal study and could not rule out the possibility of RAS.
Renal thought that the high blood pressure was more likely caused in the setting of ARF while in ICU.
BP on the floor was well-controlled.
Hydralazine was discontinued and metoprolol was changed to [**Hospital1 **] dosing and her BP remained stable.
MRA to evaluate the renal arteries was deferred as the renal team thought that ARF was more likely cause than stenosis of the renal arteries since her BP noprmalized.
The etiology of her thrombocytopenia was unclear, however BM biopsy on [**8-19**] did show reduced megakaryocytes in her marrow.
On dapsone the patient's LDH increased and her hct dropped, concerning for hemolysis so she was put back on Bactrim but on a M,W,F schedule.
Platelets currently 36 and stable.
Her electrolytes were monitored daily and repleted based on the oncology sliding scale.
