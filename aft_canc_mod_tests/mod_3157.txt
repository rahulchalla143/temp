Admission Date:  [**2158-10-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-11-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-12-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Lisinopril / Cefepime / Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**] Chief Complaint: fever and hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: placement of Triple Lumen Catheter / central line (ICU) PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 58 year old gentleman with a past medical history of suspected sarcoidosis vs autoimmune granulomatous disorder, prior splenectomy, PCV, recurrent diverticulitis leading to sigmoid resection with a complex course of anastomotic leak requiring multiple surgical interventions and prolonged antibiotic therapy who presented for a planned abdominal CT today.
The CT was performed as previously planned without contrast given recent new renal faillure.
EKG was checked with a sinus rate of 96 ST depressions in II rSR'.
CXR was checked and revealed no acute source of infection.
He was treated with vanco/ertapenem until [**6-28**] when a repeat scan on [**6-28**] showed resolution of the previous colonic anastomotic leak, complete collapse without residual fluid involving both abscess cavities.
MRI eval the same day was c/w tedinopathy.
bone marrow biopsy on [**2153-3-1**] consistent with myeloproliferative disorder...abnormal karyotype with deletion 20q in 3 out of 20 metaphases.
Baseline Cr 1.9 - 2.
(8) Gastritis, detected on EGD in [**2153-6-30**].
(10) h/o thrombophlebitis in left leg (11) uveitis (12) C4-C5 radiculopathy (13) HLD (14) HTN (15) recurrent autoimmune pericarditis (16) h/o benign pancreatic cyst s/p resection .
EKG [**10-20**]: Sinus rhythm with baseline artifact.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2158-5-4**] the rate has increased.
CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast [**2158-10-20**]: CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Centrilobular nodular densities are again seen in the right middle lobe of the lung, unchanged compared to [**2158-5-5**] and gradually increasing in conspicuity since [**2157-12-10**].
A couple of nodules adjacent to the greater curvature of the stomach, one of which is calcified (2:31), also unchanged, may represent calcified lymph nodes or small splenules.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Suture line in the rectosigmoid junction is compatible with prior colonic anastomosis.
Non-contrast CT findings are suggestive of cavernous transformation of the portal vein.
CXR [**2158-10-20**]: FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.
The cardiac and the mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
MRI Cervical Spine ([**10-22**]): FINDINGS: On the sagittal images, there is no malalignment or loss of vertebral body height.
Axial images at C2-C3 demonstrate no significant abnormality.
Degenerative changes appear to have progressed slightly since the previous examination of [**2158-1-17**].
Degenerative end plate irregularity at C4-C5, appears to have progressed compared to the prior examination with a Schmorl's node at C5.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast ([**10-24**]): CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Thyroid gland is normal in appearance with symmetric enhancement.
The abdominal wall defect is again noted with close proximity of multiple loops of small bowel beneath the cutaneous surface and diastasis of the rectus musculature as previously mentioned.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Foci of air in the bladder suggest prior catheterization.
Echocardiogram ([**10-27**]): Similar to prior study on [**2157-9-2**].
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF 65%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Fine needle aspiration is recommended.

medical including a history of complicated abdominal abcesses and presumed sarcoidosis presenting with fever, hypotension and leukocytosis.
Systolic BPs at lowest were in the 80s.
All blood cultures have been negative to date as well as urine and stool.
Blood smear was not suggestive of blast cells.
Hepatitis serologies were negative.
Imaging studies including echocardiogram, 2 CT scans, and MRI of the c-spine, and CXR have been unrevealing.
PET scan was performed as well showing FDG avidity in the thyroid nodule as well as some areas of musculature (rectus, serratus, gluteus).
However, corresponding imaging of these areas did not suggest abscess/infection.
Quantiferon gold is still PENDING at the time of discharge.
In addition, he will follow up with rheumatology to continue evaluation for his underlying granulomatous disease ?sarcoid and to continue to consider whether this process is involved in current presentation.
Urine lytes c/w Pre-Renal etiology.
Creatinine returned to baseline.
Did receive IV contrast for CT scan on this admission and was given pre- and post-hydration with sodium bicarbonate.
Creatinine has remained stable and was 1.8 on discharge.
HCT goal is less than 45 which the patient is currently at.
He was seen by Rheumatology Consult, and in reviewing his case, they suggested  to consider a pulmonary or renal biopsy to attempt to confirm  his diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
His diagnosis had previously been based on the constellation of uveitis and granulomas seen on prostate biopsy from his radical prostatectomy.
#Portal vein thrombosis - INR was 4.0 upon admission.
INR returned to 2.0, coumadin was resumed on [**11-1**].
INR monitoring as previously schedule.
Outpt MRI suggested tendinopathy.
However, outpt MRI did not suggest infection and PET did not suggest infection of this area.
TSH WAS NORMAL.
PT IS AWARE THAT HE WILL NEED OUTPT THYROID U/S AND BIOPSY OF  THIS AREA TO R/O MALIGNANCY.
HOWEVER, CT OF THE CHEST REMARKED THAT THE THYROID WAS NORMAL APPEARING.
#macrocytic anemia-baseline appears to be 26-30. last b12 and folate were normal.
Hct on discharge 27.7 .
plt count 383 on discharge.
Prophylaxis - INR > 2 .
He will need repeat chest imaging to monitor the CENTRILOBULAR RML OPACITY seen on CT scan (seen on prior imaging as well).

You were placed on broad spectrum antibiotics, although the work-up has been negative for a specific infectious source at this time.
You underwent multiple imaging studies, including CT scanx2, echocardiogram, and PET scan during this admission as well as multiple laboratory studies searching for infection.
