She was kept on aspiration precautions, had S/S evaluation showing that she can tolerate soft solids and should have nutritional supplement with meals and 1:1 supervision during eating.
Assumed fistula between GI tract, abscess, and skin; however pt not a surgical candidate given poor nutritional state.
She was therefore treated with 3 wks of vanc/zosyn with no further signs of infection.
Pt was discharged off of her bblocker given risk of bradycardia, and HRs in the low 100s were tolerated.
She had an echo while admitted that showed EF 60% but with some evidence of diastolic failure through elevated pulmonary pressure.
Hct 27 and stable on discharge.
