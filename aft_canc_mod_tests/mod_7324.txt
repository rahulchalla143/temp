# Septic Shock: Pt initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with systolic blood pressure in the 60s.
His blood cultures from [**Location (un) 620**] and [**Hospital1 18**] on admission grew out MSSA.
With agressive care his creatinine returned to baseline and LFT's and troponins downtrended.
Will need repeat TTE at end of course of therapy per ID recommendations (to be arranged by ID).
He will also need repeat blood cultures following his antibiotic course prior to replacing his port ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8817**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] RN).
# dCHF and severe AS:  In the MICU pt had hypoxia with bilateral crackles with a chest x-ray consistent with pulm edema.
ECG was checked during and post chest pain, without any noticeable changes.
He will need 1-2x weekly CBC and transfusion for HCT <24 or platelets <20.
Per wound care: "The wound bed is grey in color measuring 1.5 x 3 x 2cm.
Due to MDS, patient often bleeds with each dressing change and will need direct pressure to be applied after dressing change.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Still appears volume overloaded, he needs continued diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO BID.
Check lytes and creatinine and adjust lasix dosing accordingly - Patient should have surveillance cultures 2 weeks after completing antibiotics in order to make further decisions regarding the need for port replacement - Should have repeat TTE after completion of IV antibiotics - Can consider prophylaxis if he becomes neutropenic  Medications on Admission: - Allopurinol 100 mg once a day - furosemide 40 mg once a day - metoprolol 12.5 mg once a day - neomycin/polymyxin eardrops - niacin 750 mg once a day - simvastatin 40 mg once a day - nitroglycerin sublingually p.r.n.
