He had an out pt barium swallow which showed an ulcerating mass at the distal esophagus.
During this hospital stay ([**Date range (1) 43748**]), he had an EUS which revealed T3N2 disease with a 3x1 cm mass in the lower third of the esophagus and GE junction involving the mucosa, submucosa, the muscularis and adventitia.
