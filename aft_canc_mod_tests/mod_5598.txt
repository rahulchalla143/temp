Micro: blood cx [**10-3**] - NGTD sputum cx [**10-2**] -    GRAM STAIN (Final [**2131-10-3**]):       >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.

CXR [**9-26**]: 1.
CXR [**9-27**]: Rapidly improving left basilar consolidation.
CT chest [**9-27**]: 1.
In the setting of history of breast cancer, bone scan is recommended for further evaluation.
EKG [**9-27**]: A-V dissociation with ventricular paced rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2130-10-4**] atrial sensed ventricular paced rhythm has been replaced by the A-V dissociation with ventricular pacing.
ECHO [**9-28**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
Thyroid U/S [**9-28**]: Scans through the right surgical bed of the thyroid shows no evidence of residual thyroid tissue, masses or lymphadenopathy.
The left lobe of the thyroid is virtually completely replaced by a large solid and cystic mass, which is moderately vascular in the solid portions.
Large solid and cystic mass in the left thyroid corresponding to the lesion on CT scan.
CXR [**10-2**]: The shape of the chest and relative hyperlucency of the lungs suggests COPD.
CXR [**10-2**]: 1.
ECHO [**10-2**]: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2131-9-28**], there has been no significant change .
Labs on discharge [**10-10**]: WBC 5.5, Hct 31.4, Plt 170, MCV 86 Na 146, K 4.2, Cl 96, HCO3 39, BUN 5, Cr 0.4, Glu 82 CA 7.6, Mg 1.8, Ph 3.5 PT 13.0, PTT 136.9, INR 1.1  Brief Hospital Course: #.
She became hypotensive for several days and her cardiac enzymes remained negative x3 following that episode.
Her BP remained in the high 90s-110s for the remainder of her hospital course so her antihypertensives were not yet restarted.
She was given Lasix 10mg PO BID to aid in her diuresis and her BP was well controlled on that medication.
HYPOTENSION: Ms. [**Known lastname 98288**] developed persistent, refractory hypotension on the evening of [**10-1**] with her systolics in the 70s.
Her urine electrolytes were checked and the FeNa was 0.1, but in the setting of fluorinef usage, they were uninterpretable.
Fluorinef was discontinued and her urine output picked up.
THYROID LESION: On CT scan, a lesion was found in her thyroid.
PNEUMONIA: On admission, her CXR and physical exam were consistent with focal pneumonia involving the LLL.
Her cough improved, she remained afebrile, and never developed an elevated WBC.
Her sputum cultures were negative for anything other than oral flora.
Blood cx and urine cx also remained negative.
Her oxygenation was frequently monitored and remained stable throughout her hospital course.
Her electrolytes were checked daily and were repleted daily, to the goal of keeping K > 4 and Mg > 2. .
Calcium 600 + D(3) 600-200 mg-unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
T 97.2, BP 114/54, HR 66, RR 18, sats 96% on 2L.
UOP 4600 in last 24 hours.
