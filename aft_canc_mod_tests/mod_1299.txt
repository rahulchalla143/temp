Coronal, sagittal, and oblique reformatted images were obtained.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Left-sided [**Month (only) 4448**] with single lead in the right ventricle is unchanged.
In the right hilum at an area of previous opacity with tiny air bubbles on the [**2-10**] study, there has developed an air-filled cavity with surrounding opacity measuring 2.1 x 1.7 cm as seen on the coronal images (series 688B, image 23).
Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology in this case (grade 3).
