CT abdomen showed cholelithiasis, thickening of GB wall, peri-cholecystic fluid, intrahepatic duct dilation, CBD at 9mm, concerning for choledocolithiasis.
This CT scan also showed extensive lymphadenopathy concerning for lymphoma as well as a massive peri-umbilical hernia containing fat and colon.
Mixed venous sat in upper 80s but remained hypotensive (BPs in 80s systolic) so was started on levophed.
CVP 14 (per report from resident although RN quoted it at 9)and h/o CHF so ED concerned about cardiogenic shock after the 5L NS but O2 sats stable (100% on 5L NC).

CXR on admission to our ED: slightly suboptimal due to resp motion.
suggest repeat PA and lateral views as clinically indicated.
CXR (my read): RIJ in SVC (after pulling back from prior XR) with left-sided pleural effusion/consolidation as noted previously.
Brief Hospital Course: 75yo F with h/o CHF admitted with cholecystitis, impacted gallstone on CT Abd at OSH, with PNA clinically and on CXR initially seen here in septic shock likely from biliary source.
She underwent ERCP on [**2122-4-13**] and a fungating mass was identified at the ampulla, which was biopsied; a stent was placed in the common bile duct, restoring bile flow.
Biopsy demonstrated a high grade undifferentiated malignancy, and immunohistochemical stains were pending.
Further workup was deferred given overall prognosis and goals of care.
Her serum lactate increased to 7.1 and she developed acute renal failure with a metabolic acidosis and bicarbonate of 11.
A central venous saturation was 88 consistent with septic shock.
She still became hypotensive to SBP 70s.
