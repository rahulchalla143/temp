With no resolution of symptoms from the antibiotics the patient underwent a CT abdomen that revelaed multiple nodules within his liver as well as an IPMN of his pancreas which was confirmed on MRI.
Na noted to be 129.
He was noted to have normal LFTs (ALT 28, AST 21) and hypoalbuminemia 3.1).
At 9:30 this morning the patient underwent an ultrasound guided liver biopsy.
Initial exam notable for right basilar crackles, distended non tender abdomen.
Initial labs notable for Hct 36.9, Na 130, Plts 207, INR 1.1.
At 11:30am he was noted to have an SBP of 145.
CT Head did not reveal large mass.
After discussion with the vascular and general surgery teams, the heparin gtt was discontinued and an IVC filter was placed by general surgery, the heparin gtt was not restarted, with the thought of waiting 48 hours post procedure to reduce the risk of bleeding.
His blood pressure improved overnight and he received 2 units PRBC's and then his hematocrit remained stable so he was called out to the floor.
Otherwise NAD HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck:  JVP 7cm.
CT head [**2196-8-17**] 1.
If there is clinical concern for intracranial metastatic disease, an MRI of the brain with and without intravenous contrast is recommended.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: Incidentally noted are degenerative changes of the cervical spine with anterolisthesis of C2 on C3 and C4 on C5, with retrolisthesis of C3 on C4.
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**2196-8-17**] 1.

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2196-8-20**]): FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU course: 80M with HTN, Dementia presenting with chest pain following liver biopsy and found to have bilateral PEs on exam and hypotension.
The patient also likely bled into the liver biopsy site after being started on anticoagulation (see above CT abdomen report).
His hematocrit dropped from 36.9 to 29.3.
# Submassive Bilateral Pulmonary Embolism: After a non-contrast head CT was negative for large intracranial pathology the patient was started on a heparin gtt and admitted to the MICU.
LENIs showed significant clot burden so an IVC filter was placed by general surgery on [**8-17**].
# Clostridium Difficile colitis: prior to discussions of goals of care, a stool sample was sent for C diff toxin assay, which returned positive.
