[**2163-3-6**] CTA HEAD/NECK: 1.
Focal encephalomalacia in left periatrial white matter, with dystrophic calcification, which may relate to previous hemorrhage.
These findings are better demonstrated on the [**Hospital3 **] chest CTA obtained the previous day.
Lung volumes have returned to [**Location 213**].
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

Patient had his stroke risk factors evaluated with LDL 64 and HbA1c 6.3%.
The patient had a TTE which did not demonstrate a PFO/ASD, thrombus, and had normal systolic function.
#Urinary Tract Infection with Bacteremia: Patient complained of dysuria and had a Urine Cx with pan sensitive Klebsiella Pneumonia.
He did not have a resolution of his fevers and was found to have 1 blood culuture positive with Klebsiella Pneumonia.
A renal U/S was performed (see full report above) and did not show any abscess or hydronephrosis.
TSH was WNL.
It was recommnded that he could have an U/S on an outpatient basis for further work-up with the PCP.
On your imaging scans we identified an old bleed on the left side of the brain, this is concerning for an underlying abnormality in the blood vessels in the brain.
You should discuss this with your primary care provider for further workup (you may need an ultrasound of your thyroid gland).
