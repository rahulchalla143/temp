BP --> 16:45 225/119 --> 17:00 179/100 Patient was somnolent but arousable.
Neuro exam somewhat limited by Pt's lack of participation, pupils pinpoint CN 2-12 intact.
CT head w/out contrast: vasogenic edema unchanged, but right parietal hyperdense lesion is more conspicuously hyperdense and slightly increased in size than on the prior.
Repeat BMS x 2 to same RCA lesion in [**4-/2106**] 2.

Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2107-9-4**] the atrial premature beats are new.

[**2107-9-13**] CT HEAD W/O CON: Increased size of the hyperattenuated focus with a more amorphous appearance raises suspicion for a possible intralesional hemorrhage of the right parietal metastasis.
The other masses demonstrated on the previous MR are not well identified on this nonenhanced CT study.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2107-9-13**] the findings are similar.

CT scan was suspicious for intralesional brain hemorrhage in the right parietal metastasis and notable for an unchanged degree of vasogenic edema in that same parietal lobe.
# HYPERTENSION: She presented with systolic blood pressures in the 220s.
She was started on 6 mg Dexamethasone every 6 hours per neurosurgery recommendations, and her systolic blood pressures normalized to 110s to 140s.
