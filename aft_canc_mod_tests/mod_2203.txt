He had episodes of SVT with HR 160s that self-resolved with EKG showing rate related ST depressions in V2-V4.
CXR showed possible aspiration PNA.
He also had diffuse abdominal tenderness; CT abdomen was performed that was unremarkable.
CT head was also performed for altered mental status that was unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course: 82M hx severe dementia, DM, CHF, PVD (stent x2, most recent [**5-/2101**]), reported recent NSTEMI on [**2-10**], recent admission from [**Date range (1) 4177**] for a fib with RVR as well as [**Date range (3) 42387**] for CHF exacerbation presenting with tachycardia and hypotension.
However, patient also with notable elevated WBC count, grossly positive UA, and CXR suggestive of possible PNA so patient was covered broadly with vancomycin and cefepime.
Patient was initially started on flagyl as well given patient's questionable endorsement of abdominal discomfort on presentation but as CT Abdomen was negative, flagyl was discontinued on HD #3.
Blood cultures remained negative.
Though his lactate trended down, his central venous O2 sats were greater than 70 indicating persistent septic physiology despite appropriate antibiotic treatment.
Initial CXR showed bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis vs aspiration and cultures confirmed MRSA pneumonia.
Despite agressive fluid resuscitation and pressor support, patient's urine output remained minimal and his creatinine failed to improve.
His electrolytes remained within normal limits but he became progressively volume overloaded, failing to respond appropriately to diuresis with a lasix gtt partly due to persistently low blood pressures.
# Tachycardia: Pt with sinus rhythm in the low 100s on arrival to ED.
CT abdomen does not show any acute abdominal process.
Initially EKG shows afib, ST depressions in V1-4, worse when tachycardic, likely due to demand.
Patient had one episode of a large, bloody bowel movement so he received 2u pRBCs and underwent EGD which showed no signs of active bleeding.
