ICU evaluation was requested for hypoxia.
The patient had a CXR which did not reveal a clear etiology of her hypoxia.
ABG was 7.37/51/64.
She underwent an outpatient work-up including normal nuclear stress test and CT abd/pelvis with mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
On [**2164-3-8**] she was admitted to a hospital in [**Location (un) 78617**], FL for laparoscopic biopsy of a mesenteric node, cecal mass and omentum.
Biopsy was reactive and benign.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 16549**] and on [**2164-4-30**] underwent an excisional biopsy of a right axillary lymph node which confirmed high grade small cell lung cancer.
CTA at [**Hospital6 **] revealed right lower lobe bronchus compression with right lower lobe collapse, diffuse lymphadenopathy, small bilateral pleural effusions and by verbal report to have invasion of the SVC with associated SVC thrombus.
She denies fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, diarrhea, rashes, arthralgias or any other concerning symptoms.

The following morning, she was increasingly hypoxic to 83% on NC 6L.
The patient also probably had a component of volume overload as seen on CXR and consistent with a recent history of volume rescucitation.
Her oxygenation did improve somewhat and the patient left the ICU on 15L 40% high flow mask.
She was reimaged on [**2164-5-18**] and in comparison to previous CT scan showed 40-50% reduction in tumor burden post-chemotherapy.
A repeat CT scan on day #14 after this chemotherapy showed regression of previously extensive hilar adenopathy.
Her oxygenation status continued to improve and at time of discharge she was satting 95-97% on room air.
Urine lytes revealed SIADH, likely [**12-24**] paraneoplastic effect of small cell lung ca.
Her white count was monitored closely after second cycle of chemotherapy and became neutropenic with lowest measured ANC of 144 at time of discharge.
She will need to have a recheck of her white count on Friday, [**6-15**] prior to starting her third cycle of chemotherapy on Monday, [**6-18**] to ensure that her counts have recovered.
# UTI: A screening urinalysis with culture showed enterococcus in the urine on [**5-26**] and vancomycin was given empirically.
Final culture results showed sensitvity to macrobid, ampicillin and vancomycin and patient was started on IV ampicillin.
Diarrhea resolved one-day after initiation of antibiotics, however C. difficile toxin assay was negative x3 and antibiotics were discontinued.
