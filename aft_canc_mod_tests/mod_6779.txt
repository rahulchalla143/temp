EMS VS en route to [**Hospital3 3583**] were BP 142/74,  HR 90, RR 20, 100% 2L.
At OSH ([**Hospital3 3583**]) her vital signs were 97.4, HR 68, RR 20, BP 78/56, 99% 2L.
Subsequently she was noted to be hypotensive to SBP 60s, she was given 1.5 liters IVF with SBP to 80s and started on dopamine gtt.
A head CT at OSH showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

<b><u>IMAGING/RADIOLOGY<B><U> EKG on [**2198-7-30**]: Normal sinus rhythm with indeterminate axis.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2198-7-13**] QRS voltage is lower throughout.
(When compared to previous EKG's from OSH from as long a [**8-3**] mos ago no significant changes) .
TRANSTHORACIC ECHO ([**2198-7-30**]): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Persantine Stress Test [**2198-8-1**]: IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ST segment changes in response to dipyridamole infusion.
# PUMP/HYPOTENSION:  Per OSH records, she had hypotension to SBP 70 and subsequently received a 700 cc bolus of NS with bump in SBP to 100 at time of transfer.
Upon arrival, she received an additional 2L of NS by repeated 500 cc boluses and her SBP came up to 110-120.
A TTE on night of admission showed LVEF 30-35% and regional systolic dysfunction in the distribution of the mid-LAD.
Cardiac enzymes, as below, were down-trending.
Her blood pressure increase in response to fluid boluses suggested that the main cause for her hypotension was hypovolemia in the context of generally well compensated systolic heart failure.
This was supported by her bump in creatinine at presentation, which resolved with IVF.
Ultimately, we were able to obtain outside EKGs, which showed Q waves suggesting her MI had occurred greater than six months ago and that her decreased EF and systolic heart failure had been well compensated to this point with minimal symptomatology especially given her sedentary lifestyle.
She was also restarted on ACEI and restarted on a BB when her blood pressure recovered for her hypovolemia as part of a good CHF regimen.
As above, her echocardiogram was strongly suggestive of apical ischemia and showed Q waves suggestive of old MI.
A persantine stress test was performed prior to hospitalization and showed no reversible ischemia.
# RHYTHM:  She was monitored on telemetry throughout hospitalization.
Given her abdominal exam remained benign and the quick resolution of her hypotension we became less concerned for C diff and/or toxic megacolon.
# POSITIVE BLOOD CULTURE:  On admission she had blood cultures drawn as part of a general hypotension work up.
On hospital day two one out of two of these cultures turned positive for gram positive cocci.
This was discontinued when the culture was speciated as coagulase negative staph as this organism in [**11-22**] blood cultures is likely to represent a contaminant.
# HTN:  When her blood pressure permitted, we restarted her outpatient BB and started her on an ACEI for its cardioprotective effect.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because your blood pressure was low and some of the enzymes in your blood were elevated indicating that you may have suffered a heart attack.
Your EKG showed an old heart attack so your couamdin (warfarin) was discontinued.
Your stress test did not show any evidence that your heart is not getting enough blood flow at present.
