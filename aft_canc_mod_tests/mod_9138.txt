For this reason, the patient was diuresed aggressively, treated with high-dose steroids and transfused to keep her platelets greater than 50,000 to avoid bleeding.
As mentioned, a repeat echocardiogram revealed a    new global hypokinesis with an EF of only 25 percent.
The    plan is to repeat an echocardiogram later in her course.
The patient felt acute renal failure going from a    creatinine of a baseline of 0.4 to a peak of 1.2.
For this reason, the patient had serial    ultrasound studies with Dopplers, which were all normal    showing no reversal flow in the portal system and no    evidence of ascites.
