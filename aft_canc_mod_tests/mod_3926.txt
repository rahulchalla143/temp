Repeat bone marrow  biopsy was positive for AML.
Repeat BM Bx in [**5-/2142**] showed a hypocellular marrow with blasts.
History of chemotherapy induced cardiomyopathy with EF 25%, improved w/ EF 50% on echo [**8-/2142**]; cardiomegaly on CXR since [**8-31**] 6. b/l knee pain due to erythropeoitic conversion versus leukemic infiltrate on MRI 7.
Pertinent Results: Pertinent labs:141 | 103 | 15 / 97    AG=17                3.9 | 21  | 0.5\ Ca: 8.2 Mg: 2.0 P: 3.9 MCV 80 WBC 1.8 HGB 11.2 PLT 15 HCT 30.4 Gran-Ct: 70 PT: 13.1  PTT: 22.7 INR: 1.1 .
CTA: PE study inadequate due to patient resp motion.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF  50-55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
No color doppler studies were performed to evaluate either mitral or aortic regurgitation.
Hypoxic respiratory failure: A large pericardial effusion was noted on echo and CT.
TTE showed large retrocardiac pericardial effusion, but no tamponade physiology.
A CTA was done to evaluate for PE and showed no saddle embolus, but was inadequate due to respiratory motion.
Patient was stabilized on 4-6L NC with O2 sats of 100%.
