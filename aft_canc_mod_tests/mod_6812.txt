Additionally, she noted ankle edema, and continued chest pain.
Diagnosis: pericardial effusion  ED Course (labs, imaging, interventions, consults): Upon arrival in the ED from [**Hospital 1562**] hospital, initially pt was tachy to 150, RR 23, BP 132/56, 97% on 4L NC (92% on 2L on admission) with a pulsus of 20mmHg.
EKG was obtained which demonstrated sinus tachycardia.
Bedside echo demonstrated RA and RV collapse.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes - , Dyslipidemia - , Hypertension - 2.
Bilateral breast biopsy demonstrated invasive lobular carcinoma.
The left breast lesion was T1C M0, ER/PR positive, HER-2/neu negative without lymphovascular invasion and grade II.
[**7-/2108**]:  Oncotype DX assay revealed a recurrence score of 21, which was in the intermediate risk group.
The last bone mineral density scan in [**7-/2108**] revealed osteopenia at the left femoral neck   Social History: Retired teacher, taking writing courses, married lives with spouse.
Genetic testing for BRCA 1 or 2 mutations was performed and was negative.
NECK: Supple with JVD at 3cm above clavicle at 90 degrees CARDIAC: Hyperdynamic precordium, PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.

They are negative for CK20, CEA, Leu-M1 (background staining of neutrophils and macrophages), GCDFP, ER, PR, Calretinin, and WT-1.
CXR AP [**2112-4-11**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Unchanged small left pleural effusion  ECHO [**2112-4-4**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Brain MRI [**2112-4-18**]: Preliminary ReportIMPRESSION: 1.
# Pericardial effusion: On admission, found to have effusion with tamponade physiology; s/p drainage of pericardial effusion on [**2112-4-3**] complicated by RV puncture and transient need for levophed (~3 minutes).
Pericardial window performed [**4-4**].
# Atrial Fibrillation - First noted following pericardial window, felt to be secondary to pericardial irritation; no evidence of PE on CTA chest (although not protocoled for PE).
# Pleural Effusions - During hospital stay, noted to have enlarging R pleural effusion, on [**4-8**] underwent tap, with conversion to pleurex on [**4-11**].
Of note, patient was never officially ruled out for pulmonary embolism (had CT chest w contrast that was not protocoled for PE), but as this would not change management (already on therapeutic lovenox as above) CT PE was not obtained.
