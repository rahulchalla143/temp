Vomiting and wretching continued intermittently and he became increasingly SOB and thus, presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
In the ED, initial vitals revealed T 101.9, HR 139, BP 88/palp, RR 23, O2 sat 89% RA.
He received 3L IVFs to which his SBP improved to 90s.
ca) and EKG revealed minimal ST depressions in lateral leads; CK negative and troponin 0.02.
His hct was noted to be 24 in the ED and out of concern for possible ischemia, he was ordered for 2U prbcs.
A CTA chest was performed which showed no e/o PE, but did reveal what appears to be esophageal microperforation.
In [**7-/2103**], Mr. [**Known lastname 13144**] began to experience difficulty swallowing, evaluation revealed local recurrence.
Developed PE [**2103-11-18**], since then is on Lovenox.
Changed to Taxotere [**1-2**] due to insufficient palliative response in esophagus despite apparent systemic control; currently s/p Cycle 1 Week 3 of Taxotere.

If clinically indicated, further characterization with chest CT using Esophotrast oral contrast could be performed.
[**2104-7-5**] pleural fluid analysis: 3+PMNs, no microorg, cytology negative for malignant cells .
[**2104-7-5**] Barium swallow shows widely patent esoph in proper place with no evidence on barium swallow of communication between esophoagus and air.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  53yoM with h/o esophageal ca s/p esophageal stents p/w 2-3days of N/V, fever, and worsening SOB found to have ?esophageal microperforation on CT chest and increasing size of right pleural effusion admitted to ICU for further management.
Analysis was negative for microorganisms, with cytology negative for malignant cells.
Pt was pancultured with all cultures negative to date.
# Esophageal cancer: CT scan performed on [**2104-6-26**] that showed interval increase in the right-sided pleural effusion, stable pericardial effusion and no significant change in the esophageal wall thickening and mass nor in the intraabdominal and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
[**7-5**] barium swallow shows widely patent esophagus with adequate stent placement.
There was initial concern for microperforation of the esophagus on CT scan, however, barium swallow showed widely patent esophagus in proper place with no evidence of communication of the esophagus with the air.
EKG was obtained in the ED which was largely unchanged from prior, but ED sent cardiac enzymes out of concern for possible very mild lateral lead ST depressions (<1mm V4-V5 on review of EKG).
CEs were negative x 2 (pt was ruled out for MI).
Suspiscion very low for ACS and CTA negative for new PE to suggest as cause of pain.
While you were in the hospital you also had an upper endoscopy when showed that your esophageal stent was open.
