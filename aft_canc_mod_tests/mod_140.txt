Exploratory laparotomy and hematoma evacuation 3.
Cystoscopy & retrograde ureterogram   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 29-year-old G5 P1-1-3-2 thin African-American female with a large symptomatic fibroid uterus, complaining of prolonged menometrorrhagia as well as severe pelvic pain, who presented with severe anemia with a hematocrit of 25.
Iron studies revealed severe iron-deficiency anemia, however the patient was not compliant with p.o.
Given the source of anemia was likely due to her fibroid uterus, the patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells 1 day preoperatively, as well as 125 mg of Ferrlecit IV to try to improve her iron stores and blood supply.
The patient was offered to delay the surgery to improve her iron stores with p.o.
The risks of infection with blood transfusion, as well as the side effects of blood transfusion, were discussed with the patient at length.
Her IUFD at 6 months was successfully delivered vaginally with an induction of labor.
