She had an EGD on [**2130-6-1**] that was successful on the third attempt and tissue biopsy at that time revealed an invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
CT showed no evidence of metastases or local invasion.
In addition, she had a CT of her neck, which was concerning for perforation.
She was noted to have a left upper lobe cavitary lesion on the CT scan.
She underwent a wedge resection on [**2130-1-11**], which revealed carcinomatous plaques on the pleural wall.

Echocardiogram [**2131-3-28**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
CXR [**2131-4-26**]: Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2131-3-22**].
If clinically warranted, further evaluation with chest CT might be considered.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2131-3-28**]: 1.
Soft tissue density mass posterior to the tracheostomy catheter was seen on prior CT scan and is consistent with patient's metastatic esophageal cancer.
CT Neck: Ill-defined soft tissue associated with the esophagus in the post-cricoid region and hypopharynx in the area of prior FDG avidity.
Based on ENT evaluation, patient's airway narrowed to 1-2 mm.
She had an emergent bronch which showed patent airways.
She was trainned in multiple days to use her tracheostoy and how to release the inner canula.
She also dropped her pressures and was started on levo (weaned off on [**3-29**]) and boluses IVF to maintain a MAP> 65 and a CVP>10.
Her fevers resolved and her clindamycin was d/c after 6 doses.
Her sinus tachycardia did not respond to fluid resuscitation in the ICU.
# Metastatic esophageal cancer: with mets to lungs, recent PET scan showed increased disease in lung, upper esophagus, and paratracheal region.
# HCT: Pt received 2 units of packed RBCs for HCT of 23 and bumped appropriately.
