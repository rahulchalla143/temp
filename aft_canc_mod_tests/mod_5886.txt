A CBC was drawn, which was significant for thrombocytopenia of 7.
A staging CT in [**2198-4-27**] showed widespread lymphadenopathy involving the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with a large conglomeration of mesenteric lymph nodes.
CLL as above Hypercholesterolemia Hypertension .
Vitals T100.5, HR 94, RR 20, BP 102/46, Sat 96%RA General: No acute distress, thin elderly woman HEENT: EOMI, left eye with conjunctival hemorrhage, 2cm ecchymosis below left eye; multiple confluent petechiae/ecchymoses on hard palate Neck: Anterior cervical lymphadenopathy appreciated Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Heart: RRR normal S1/S2, no murmurs appreciated Abd: Soft, non-tender, no discrete splenomegaly appreciated, normal active bowel sounds Ext: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally, no edema .
Gran-CT - 20 .
HCT ( low 20 ) .
CXR ([**7-5**]) - Severe elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is more pronounced consistent with severe eventration or phrenic nerve palsy.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis: ([**7-18**]) 1.
CXR ([**7-19**]): Compared to the prior study, tip of the left PICC line is in the proximal SVC.
DIC labs were sent on the floor and revealed elevated fibrinogen, no FDP.
She was aggressively repleted with IVF to achieve goal CVP 10-12.
[**2-28**] Blood cultures have grown GNRs-->pseudomonas.
Urine culture is negative.
BP stable off pressors, CVP responded appropriately to aggressive IVF repletion.
Cortisol was elevated to 190, 188.8 on repeat.
This was followed by a similar progression of erythema, edema on her arms b/l, also thought to be related to her gram negative sepsis.
On [**7-19**] she spike a fever again, and blood cx showed gram negative rods and yeast and her PICC line was D/C'd.
However, no evidence of hemolysis by labs nor on smear (reviewed by hem/onc team).
Received additional 4 units during her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay for goal platelets > 20.
# Pleural effusions: CXR ([**7-8**]) showed b/l pleural effusions.
- continue to monitor O2 sat - low threshold for more diuresis, pt is likely volume overloaded given aggressive fluid repletion on transfer to ICU .
No abdominal tenderness on exam or h/o GI symptoms.
Hct was 23.6 on admission and dropped to 19.6 this am and received some fluids overnight (amt.
Hemolysis labs were negative and smear showed no e/o schistocytes per hem/onc review so as not to suggest process such as TTP/HUS (w/ renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia).
Given septic, will check mixed venous O2 sat and transfuse as needed to maintain hct >30 if O2 sat <70%.
Received additional 3u prbcs for hct 21 with goal > 30.
Hct stable, 28.7 today.
- follow daily cbc - goal crit > 21 .
FeNa 0.2% and urine Na 10 c/w prerenal etiology (likely in the setting of her hypotension).
Lipitor 10mg daily Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily Fosamax 70mg weekly Calcium Allopurinol 300mg daily (d/c'd [**2198-7-4**]) .
