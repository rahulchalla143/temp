Opening pericardial pressure was 5mmHg.
PRE PROCEDURE ECHO [**2153-10-24**] There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**10-5**]/201, the pericardial effusion has increased in size.
POST-PROCEDURE ECHO [**2153-10-25**] Limited views.
No diastolic collapse of RA as seen on echocardiogram prior to the pericardiocentesis on [**2153-10-24**].
ECHO [**2153-10-26**] There is no pericardial effusion.
The the drain output was less than 80ccs and the drain was pulled the next day.
Post procedure echos showed resolution of the effusion.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: #Pericardial effusion: He should undergo repeat echo to ensure the effusion has not recurred prior to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**3-7**] weeks.
