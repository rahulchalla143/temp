CT OF THE CHEST W/IV CONTRAST: Soft tissue window image demonstrate multiple lymph nodes within the mediastinum, within the pretracheal, subcarinal, and perivascular spaces.
Lung window images demonstrate innumerable nodules within both lungs diffusely, likely representing metastatic foci.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN W/IV CONTRAST: There is massive ascites.
CT OF THE PELVIS W/IV CONTRAST: A large amount of pelvic fluid can be seen.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology.
Further evaluation of the liver with a multiphasic liver CT is recommended.
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: No intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, or subdural hemorrhage is seen.
Peritoneal fluid cytology: Peritoneal fluid, cell block:  Highly atypical scattered cells mostly seen in cytology preparation (see cytology report C05-[**Numeric Identifier 39373**]).
Immunohistochemical studies for AE1/AE3, CAM 5.2, CEA, Leum1, Calrentinin, B72.3, Hepar-1, CD10 are non contributory.
His primary malignancy was likely hepatocellular, as CT chest/abd/pelvis demonstrated large lesions in the liver as well as innumerable pulmonary nodules.
