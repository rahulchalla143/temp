The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Left ventricular systolic function is probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be excluded.
Pulmonary artery pressures could not be assessed.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-9-4**], the right ventricle is now dilated and hypokinetic with evidence of RV pressure/volume overload.
Echo revealed new right heart strain.
However, pt had 82% O2 saturation while ambulating and was set-up for home O2.
All cultures were negative.
Fever was most likely [**1-27**] to inflammatory response from DVT and PE.
Pt's blood pressures are about 120s/80s.
