CXR [**2143-4-25**]: PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Accounting for differences in patient rotation and lower lung volumes, there appears to be no significant interval change.
In that light, there are several additional areas of low absorption, each under a centimeter in size within both cerebral hemispheres that were likely seen on the prior study and could represent chronic small vessel infarcts as well.
**FINAL REPORT [**2143-4-26**]**     DIRECT INFLUENZA A ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2143-4-26**]):       Positive for Influenza A viral antigen.
DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2143-4-26**]):       NEGATIVE FOR INFLUENZA B VIRAL ANTIGEN.
Blood Culture [**2143-4-24**]: No growth to date Blood Culture [**2143-4-27**]: No growth to date   Brief Hospital Course: Brief Hospital Course: ====================== In the ED, the patient had diffuse exp wheezes, was hypoxic w/ O2 sat 88-90% on RA.
He was given O2 5L/m by NC w/ O2 sat increasing to 91-93%.
ABG was 7.25/84/57.
CXR was normal, CTA was done to investigate for PE and was normal.
Rectal temp was 101.4F.
A dx of meningitis was considered, but LP was not performed due to INR 5.5; instead, he was empirically treated w/ levoflox 500mg, vancomycin 1gm, and meropenem 1gm IV.
However, influenza cultures came back positive for influenza A and it was felt that this explained his fever, respiratory distress and altered mental status.
Rapid rate controlled with metoprolol.
Enoxaparin 100 mg/mL Syringe Sig: One (1) syringe Subcutaneous every twelve (12) hours: Use until your primary care physician tells you that your INR is between [**3-1**] and you can stop taking lovenox.
Last room air oxygen saturation was 85% at rest.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw INR on Friday [**2143-5-3**] and on mondays thereafter and fax results to:  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2411**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4027**], Coumadin Nurse ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 59424**]  15.

You also likely have emphysema based on your exam, chest x-ray and chest CT, however you should have pulmonary function tests once you are completely recovered from the flu to help clarify your lung status.
You should have your INR level checked frequently until the level has stabilized.
The visiting nurse will draw your level and fax it to [**Doctor First Name 2411**] at [**Hospital 27252**] Medical Center on Friday and again on Monday.
