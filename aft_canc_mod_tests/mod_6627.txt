The patient presented after his fall to [**Hospital6 302**] where he was noted to be in atrial flutter with RVR, rate of 150.
He then underwent a CT of his head which was concerning for a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
He underwent an MRI without contrast at [**Hospital 15405**] and was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER.
In the [**Hospital1 **] ER he underwent repeat CT and this read as negative, his MRI was read as possible gyrohyperdensities in the L parietal lobe which could be infectious versus malignant.
Repeat MRI with contrast was recommended.
He had a CXR with a L pleural effusion and was given vanc/zosyn/azithro.
In the ED, initial VS:  T 96.8 HR 80-110 BP 92/47 RR 16 O2 sat: 98%.
VS prior to transfer to the floor: T 96.7  GBP 97/59  HR 103  96% on 4L.

[**2172-3-3**] MRI Brain w/ contrast: Focal enhancement and edema centered around the left postcentral gyrus is concerning for a mestastasis given the location and large pulmonary mass on the chest CT. Additional differential considerations would include infection or a primary brain tumor.
A repeat study with the leads removed and addition of perfusion sequences would be useful in further evaluation.
[**2172-3-3**] CT Chest w/o contrast: 1.
Pulmonary metastases in the ipsilateral and contralateral lungs.
CTA Chest w/ & w/o contrast: 1)Large infiltrating mass in the left hilum extending along the occluded left pulmonary vein into the left atrium and circumferentially encasing and infiltrating the left mainstem bronchus with compression of the lingular bronchus and subtotal compression of the left lower lobe bronchus causing atelectasis.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The left atrial mass has a broad base measuring 2.5 x 0.8 cm with a miobile, stalk-like aspect measuring 3 x 0.7 cm- ?
[**2172-3-5**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
A repeat diffusion images will also help for further assessment and differentiating mass lesion versus infarct in this location.
Squamous cell carcinoma of lung: New diagnosis found on imaging and subsequent lung biopsy after bronchoscopy.
Atrial & Ventricular Ectopy:  He developed atrial flutter in the MICU.
He had one episode of desaturation to 80s on [**3-15**] and CXR showed new collapse of LUL near recent stent placement.
His exam remained unchanged.
EEG was performed twice ([**3-3**] and [**3-4**]) and both showed findings consistent with mild to moderate encephalopathy that was improving.
His celexa was decreased to 20 mg daily (from 40 mg) as patient developed SIADH of unclear etiology.
His labs were consistent with SIADH.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Five (5) mL PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
A CT scan of your chest showed a large mass in your chest as well.
You were given medications to slow your heart rate down.
