No pathologic nodes were identified on CT scan.

The bolster was removed on POD#5 and the skin graft showed 100% take.
###CV: He was tachycardic postoperatively, and after his heart rate did not respond to adequate IV fluid boluses (as measured by an appropriate urine output), a medicine consult was obtained given his history of DVT/PE and cardiomyopathy.
An EKG showed sinus tachycardia, and a PE-protocol CT was performed.
Troponins were negative x3.
###Pulm: He was diagnosed with a right lower lobe pneumonia after the PE-protocol CT on POD#1.
Sputum culture eventually grew Citrobacter koseri and Enterobacter aerogenes, both sensitive to fluoroquinolones; commensal respiratory flora was absent.
They also recommended a video swallow evaluation, which was done on POD#7.
His creatinine remained stable at his preoperative baseline (1.2-1.4).
###Heme:  His post-operative hematocrit dropped to 31, where it remained stable.
On POD#3, it was noted that he had asymmetric edema of his upper extremities, and ultrasound examination revealed a DVT in his left arm.
His INR was therapeutic on POD#6 and the lovenox was stopped.
###Endocrine: The patient's blood glucose was controlled with a regular insulin sliding scale, which he tolerated well.
A TSH was checked for the tachycardia workup and was normal.
His CT scan showed incidental findings of left axillary lymphadenopathy and small pulmonary nodules.
Wound care: trim the dried edges of the Xeroform on the left leg as needed to keep them from getting caught on clothing - this will eventually fall off on its own.
