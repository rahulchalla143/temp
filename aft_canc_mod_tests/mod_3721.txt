GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined  MRI of brain: Residual mass within the left lateral ventricle demonstrates patchy enhancement that has decreased in size compared to the preoperative study, now measuring approximately 2.7 x 1.8 x 1.8 cm, previously 2.9 x 2.2 x 2.8 cm.
A CT showed no hemorrhage, he spent overnight in the PACU was started on Decadron.
His BP was kept less than 140 overnight.
on [**12-16**] CTA chest showed consolidation in the lower lobes bilaterally as well as less prominent in the upper lobes.
An Echo showed an EF 70%, LV and RV nrml, valves nrml.
