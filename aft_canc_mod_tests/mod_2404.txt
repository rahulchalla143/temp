Ct of the head showed an area of hemorrhage in the left temp/ parietal lobe and an MRI revealed two lesions one in the right and one in the left temp.
Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission: [**2159-5-7**] 12:20AM BLOOD WBC-10.3 RBC-4.61 Hgb-13.9* Hct-40.4 MCV-88 MCH-30.2 MCHC-34.5 RDW-13.2 Plt Ct-361 [**2159-5-7**] 12:20AM BLOOD Neuts-87.4* Lymphs-9.2* Monos-2.2 Eos-0.8 Baso-0.4 [**2159-5-7**] 12:20AM BLOOD PT-14.1* PTT-27.5 INR(PT)-1.2* [**2159-5-7**] 03:30AM BLOOD Calcium-9.4 Phos-2.4* Mg-2.1  Labs on Discharge: XXXXXXXXXXX  Imaging: CT Torso [**2159-5-7**]: CT CHEST: The left thyroid is enlarged and heterogeneous without focal lesion.
CT ABDOMEN: The gallbladder, spleen, adrenals, and pancreas are unremarkable.
CT PELVIS: The bladder, rectum, and prostate are unremarkable.
Head CT [**5-7**]: FINDINGS: In the right frontotemporal region, there is a 2.5 x 3.3 cm hypodensity with fine hyperdense rim and surrounding vasogenic edema (series 2, image 19).
MRI Head [**5-11**](post-rsxn): FINDINGS: The patient is status post left parietal craniotomy, in comparison with the prior study, the previously described left frontal lobe mass lesion, has been resected.
Restricted diffusion is noted adjacent in the posterior margin of the surgical area, blooming artifacts and magnetic susceptibility changes are visualized in the surgical bed.
Head CT [**5-14**](post-rsxn) FINDINGS: Again noted are left parietal craniotomy changes, with air seen within the surgical bed, similar in appearance to prior study.
Head CT [**5-16**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been no significant interval change since one day prior.
Postoperative hemorrhage is stable measuring 5.7 x 4.1 cm.
There is stable minimal shift of midline structures, of approximately 3 mm leftward shift.
Head CT [**5-17**]: FINDINGS: Patient is status post bilateral craniotomies.
No significant interval change from the prior study in the postoperative hemorrhage within the right temporoparietal lobe resection bed.
LENIS [**5-15**]: BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color Doppler imaging of the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal veins demonstrate normal compressibility, augmentation, waveforms and flow.
EKG [**5-7**]: Sinus rhythm Modest ST junctional depression is nonspecific and may be within normal limits, but clinical correlation is suggested No previous tracing available for comparison   	Intervals	Axes Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T 89	156	98	366/416	28	-25	5   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service on [**5-7**].
On [**5-9**] he went to the operating room for a left sided craniotomy to resect the first of two brain lesions.
A head CT was immediately done and there was new bleeding identified in the right sided resection cavity, as well as increased vasogenic edema.
He did not worsen neurologically that day, so head CT was again repeated on [**5-16**].
He was evaluated by neuro-oncology and was scheduled for a Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic appointment.
?You will not need an MRI of the brain as this was done during your acute hospitalization    Completed by:[**2159-5-22**
