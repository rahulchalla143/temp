In the Emergency Room was found to be 74% on room air, was placed on a non rebreather with increased sats to 94-95% and chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions, right greater than left with interstitial edema.
The patient also had an emergent echo done in the Emergency Room which showed PA pressures of 97, severe right ventricular dysfunction and patient was then sent for a CT angiogram which showed extensive clot burden of the bilateral pulmonary arteries.
MEDICATIONS:  As an outpatient, Coumadin, Advair, Combivent, Ibuprofen, Folate and Multivitamin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission, heart rate 77 with blood pressure 110/80, O2 saturation 97% on Bi-PAP, respiratory rate 26.
Temperature 96.5.
Neck with JVP increased.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 6.7, hematocrit 38.9, platelet count 285,000, MCV 69, sodium 137, potassium 6.5, repeat was 4.3, chloride 109, CO2 21, BUN 23, creatinine 0.7, glucose 66.
Arterial blood gases on the non rebreather, PH 7.45, PCO2 28, PO2 42.
INR 2.8.
However, the patient had CT angiogram with large clot burden bilaterally, no evidence of extension of clot into the right atrium on echocardiogram.
The patient tolerated this well and patient's oxygenation improved rapidly while on the inhaled regimen.
During the course of his stay, the patient had repeated echocardiograms including echocardiogram with a bubble study which did show improvement in his PR gradient from 97 on admission to 84 as was noted from his previous discharge summaries from [**Hospital1 2025**], was noted to have elevated PA pressures on echocardiogram a year prior to this and had chronic history of pulmonary hypertension.
The patient otherwise had good LV function but did have a bubble study which showed stretched patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect which was likely a shunt secondary to patient's chronic right heart failure as a compensation.
Echo study also showed severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis which was also consistent with previous echocardiogram reports from his [**Hospital1 2025**] hospitalization including a right heart catheterization during that hospitalization.
His echocardiogram did show presence of pericardial effusion which was determined to be stable in size and asymptomatic and which was continued to be followed.
The patient was tried on a non rebreather mask which was more comfortable, however, his oxygen saturations remained in the low 80's during this.
Patient's PCP did note that on office visits, the patient's room air saturation was rarely greater than 80 and on his two liters patient's oxygen saturation was rarely greater than 86%.
Eventually patient was transitioned from a non rebreather mask to nasal cannula which was more comfortable and eventually at 5:55 p.m. the patient's saturations decreased and patient was pronounced dead secondary to respiratory failure, secondary to chronic pulmonary hypertension, secondary to chronic thromboembolic disease complicated by acute on chronic pulmonary emboli.
