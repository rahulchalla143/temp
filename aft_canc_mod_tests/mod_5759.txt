CT head was negative.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis was concerning for pneumoperitoneum and likely anterior pelvic abscess abutting bladder dome.
Cystogram was performed but results were pending on transfer.
Vitals signs prior to transfer were HR 60 BP 95/37 18 100%.

CXR [**2138-9-12**]: Bibasilar (right greater than left) opacities might represent multifocal pneumonia, aspiration, or atelectasis.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2138-9-12**]: 1.
Conventional or CT cystogram may be pursued to confirm.
CT Head [**2138-9-12**]: No acute intracranial process.
CT Cystogram [**2138-9-12**]: Small contained fistulous connection between the bladder dome into the region of the intraperitoneal air collection.
CXR [**2138-9-13**]: Frontal view of the chest is compared to the prior study from [**2138-9-12**] and additional previous studies.
LUE ultrasound [**2138-9-15**]: No evidence of DVT.
ECG [**2138-9-16**]: Atrial fibrillation.
CT head [**2138-9-19**]: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
CXR [**9-24**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change.
Also found to have pneumoperitoneum and pelvic abscesses on CT scan, likely secondary to bladder cancer and recent resection.
He was placed transiently on Levophed to maintain his blood pressure which was weaned off after fluid recussitation.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: His creatinine was elevated to 3.1 from his baseline of 1.7-1.9 felt to be due to hypovolemia and severe infection.
BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA: Hct decreased 25.2 to 19.2 in the setting of hematuria.
Hemolysis labs were negative and it was felt that this was most likely due to bleeding from his urogenital tract.
He was transfused 2 units PRBCs and his hematocrit increased appropriately and remained stable.
Hct was stable.
PNEUMOPERITONEUM: The patient had a CT which showed pneumoperitoneum.
Stat CT cystogram confirmed small superior dome intraperitoneal leak.
