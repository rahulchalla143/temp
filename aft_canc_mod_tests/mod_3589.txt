CT PERITINEAL DRAIN EXCLUDING APPENDICEAL  [**2159-9-25**] 3:50 PM Under direct CT guidance, an 18-gauge [**Last Name (un) 4300**] needle was advanced into the patient's right-sided abdominal fluid collection.
Through this, a wire was introduced followed by serial dilation before placing a 10 French drainage catheter.
The specimen was sent for Gram stain and culture.
Radiology Report CT PERITINEAL DRAIN EXC Study Date of [**2159-10-2**] 11:08 AM Using CT fluoroscopic guidance, an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter was placed into the splenic fluid collection utilizing Seldinger technique.
A few cc of fluid resembling old blood were aspirated from the catheter and sent for culture and stain.

His ostomy was still working.
A CT was done on [**9-25**] and Under direct CT guidance, an 18-gauge [**Last Name (un) 4300**] needle was advanced into the patient's right-sided abdominal fluid collection.
Through this, a wire was introduced followed by serial dilation before placing a 10 French drainage catheter.
The specimen was sent for Gram stain and culture.
A repeat CT on [**9-30**] showed Decreased right subhepatic fluid collection with a pigtail catheter in place.
Stable left perisplenic fluid collection measuring 7 x 4.5 x 4.5 cm.
There was successful placement of a drainage catheter into the perisplenic fluid collection A few cc of fluid resembling old blood were aspirated from the catheter and sent for culture and stain.
A repeat CT was performed on [**10-16**] and showed multiple loculated fluid collections with pockets of air.
The oral contrast passes through to the ileostomy bag and also continues to the distal small bowel and left colon.
A EGD on [**2159-10-18**] showed No evidence of gastric outlet obstruction.
A Barium enema on [**10-22**] showed No evidence of leak at the ileocolonic anastomosis.
A PASSY-MUIR VALVE was attempted and he was tolerating this for short periods of time.
A CXR revealed worsening of bilateral pleural effusions with probable adjacent atelectasis versus consolidation; worsening volume overload vs CHF.
