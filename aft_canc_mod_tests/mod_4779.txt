Right upper lobe ground-glass parenchymal opacity, suggestive of pneumonia.
Extensive mediastinal, hilar, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and iliac lymphadenopathy and massive splenomegaly.
[**11-15**] CT Head- 1.
Although there is no CT evidence of large intracranial mass, MRI with gadolinium is superior in evaluation of such lesions and can be considered if not contraindicated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
No evidence of hydronephrosis, with resolution of the mild hydronephrosis seen on CT [**2137-11-15**].
Nonvisualization of left renal interpolar region indeterminate lesion seen on CT scan [**2137-11-15**], due to limited visualization.
For further evaluation,if clinically relevant, an MR could be performed.
In comparison with the preceding single view examination, it is possible that these parenchymal densities have progressed slightly and thus, further followup chest examinations in this patient with history of lymphoma is recommended.
[**12-4**] CT Chest: 1.
If the apppearance may be clinically significant based on laboratory data or clinical presentation, then MRCP could be considered or follow-up CT or ultrasound.
Extrinsic compression by lymphadenopathy that is not imaged on this study is a possible, though somewhat unusual, possibility.
[**12-4**] CT Head: 1.
MR (if feasible) would be more sensitive than CT for detection of metastatic lesions.
Mediastinal position, contour, and width are unremarkable and stable.
The abnormalities demonstrated on prior chest radiograph and chest CT appears to be grossly unchanged except for may be minimal progression at the level of the left lower lobe and right upper superficial area as well as interval development of minimal amount of pleural effusion on the right.
Initial labs in the ED were remarkable for lactic acidosis with HCO3 of 15 and a lactate of 7.9.
On the medical floor, he was found to have a uric acid of 13.5 and an LDH of 604 in the setting of normal calcium/ phosphate/ potassium.
A heme-onc consult was called and an axillary LN biopsy showed prelimary path c/w aggressive lymphoma.
Bone marrow biopsy eventually showed diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
Lactic acidosis was attributed to tumor mass necrosis vs. infection and patient was started on vanc/zosyn/azithro for pneumonia visualized on CT chest (see below).
He received [**Hospital1 **] for treatment of his lymphoma and tumor lysis labs were monitored q6 given his spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome on admission.
# Pneumonia- Patient had chest CT with ground-glass parenchymal opacity, suggestive of pneumonia.
Repeat imaging with CT scan showed widespread peripheral consolidations concerning for an inflammatory etiology such as eosinophilic pneumonia or organizing pneumonia, but ultimately attributed to resolving pneumonia in the setting of a reconstituted immune system as the patient was asymptomatic and appeared well.
Patient will need repeat imaging in [**12-22**] weeks after discharge to assess progression.
His weight increased 10 lbs over several days secondary to fluid retention.
CT head w/ and w/o contrast was negative for bleeds and metastatic disease.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 87754**],  You were admitted to the hospital with chest and abdominal pain.
You had a CT scan of your chest, lymph node and bone marrow biopsies which showed that you have diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
You will need to have a repeat CT of your chest in [**12-22**] weeks to assess the improvement of this infection.
Followup Instructions: Please come to the 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] Outpatient Clinic at 10:00AM on Friday [**12-13**] for tests to check your blood counts and your chemistries.
