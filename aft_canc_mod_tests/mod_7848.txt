CXR showed bilateral infiltrates, and she was given lasix with little response.
Cr rose from baseline 1.0.
WBC normal and patient afebrile.
A Swan was placed, showing CVP 8 w/ wedge 12 to 15, so patient volume resuscitated.
HIDA scan showed no gall bladder uptake.
Post-op, her urine output and oxygenation worsened, so a vasculitis work-up was started, showing  RF>500 and low complement.
BPs have been stable, 120 to 150s.
Patient had an initial concern for vasculitides, 1st bronch appeared to be bloody but upon second bronch and repeat imaging there was no signs of pulmonary hemorrhage.
Finally, Patient had a TTE done in the hospital, which showed preserved systolic function, mild MR. .
Hematology was also on board, smear not consistent with MDS.

IMAGING [**12-14**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**12-14**] CT chest: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2107-12-21**] RENAL ULTRASOUND IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 69yo female w/ h/o non-Hodgkin's lymphoma c/b an unclear h/o cutaneous vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia and chronic kidney disease with [**3-/2107**] renal biopsy showing membranous profilerative glomerulonephritis consistent with cryoglobulinemia, transferred from an OSH with respiratory failure and acute on chronic renal failure.
Initial bronchoscopy showed some blood in the bronchi, so the patient received 24hrs of high-dose steroids.
However, repeat bronchoscopy showed a small amount of blood that cleared easily with lavage, making pulmonary hemorrhage less likely.
CT scan of the chest was also more consistent with fluid overload.
She was aggressively diuresed with IV Lasix to reduce the fluid overload, estimated at over 30L.
Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has a known history of MPGN per prior renal biopsy, presumably associated with her hemstologic malignancy, however the Nephrology team did not feel that her fluid overload could be attributed to this disease, but this may have contributed to her response to the aggressive hydration in the weeks prior to her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Urine sediment analysis revealed muddy brown casts consistent with ATN; this was thought to be due to vascular congestion / fluid overload.
Given concern for h/o cryglobulinemia/vasculitis, a panel of rheumatology labs revealed high inflammatory markers and low complement levels, rhematoid factor ~120, consistent with known cryoglobulinemia, but not consistent with a pulmonary/renal syndrome, and given muddy brown casts, Nephrology felt a nephritic/vasculitic picture less likely.
Her renal function remained stable, with creatinine peaking at 4.0.
Her creatinine dropped to her baseline of 1.1 at the time of discharge following auto-diuresis and recovery from ATN.
A renal ultrasound was performed and showed no sign of renal artery stenosis.
The Cardiology and Renal teams felt that her hypertension could be explained by fluid overload, and recommended reassessment once her fluid balance was corrected.
Echo showed new mitral regurgitation, but intact ventricular function.
As her fluid overload is corrected, it is anticipated that she will return to her home regimen by restarting spironolactone and losartan, tapering off hydralazine and isosorbide mononitrate, reducing clonidine to her home dose, and reducing Lasix to her home dose.
Continue diuresis until euvolemic, as above  Medications on Admission: Medications (home): - spironolactone 25mg QOD - simvastatin 20mg daily - amlodipine 10mg daily - carvedilol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] - clonidine 0.2mg [**Hospital1 **] - lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] - losartan 100mg daily - Aspirin 81mg daily .
However, you will need further fluid loss to get back to your normal weight.
Throughout your stay, your blood pressure was high relative your to normal level.
We have made several adjustments to your home medications to control your blood pressure and to avoid damaging your kidneys.
During one of your imaging studies (CT scan) it was noted that you had a small nodule on your thyroid.
MEDICATION CHANGES: - STOP spironolactone due to your reduced kidney function - STOP losartan due to your reduced kidney function - INCREASE clonidine to 0.3mg twice a day - INCREASE furosemide to 40mg IV twice a day.
- START hydralazine 50mg three times a day for high blood pressure - START isosorbide mononitrate 90mg daily for high blood pressure - START Tylenol, oxycodone, and lidocaine patch for pain.
