She had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2141-7-4**] at [**Hospital1 18**], which revealed a small amount of ascites.
Her weight has been stable.
She had a colonoscopy several years ago which was normal per her report.
She reports that she had a chest CT several months ago which revealed a question of an enlarged lymph nodes and was to have followup for this.
Last mammogram was recently abnormal but followup was recommended.
Bimanual and rectovaginal examination revealed a large firm mass in the cul-de-sac which was somewhat immobile.
Pertinent Results: [**2141-7-19**] 08:35PM BLOOD WBC-11.5* RBC-3.28* Hgb-10.1* Hct-30.7* MCV-94 MCH-31.0 MCHC-33.0 RDW-13.2 Plt Ct-498* [**2141-7-19**] 08:35PM BLOOD Glucose-150* UreaN-12 Creat-0.6 Na-139 K-4.1 Cl-105 HCO3-25 AnGap-13 [**2141-7-19**] 08:35PM BLOOD Calcium-8.2* Phos-3.9 Mg-1.5* .
Lymph nodes, peri-aortic, biopsy (P-S):      Metastatic carcinoma in three lymph nodes ([**2-18**]).
Cecum, tumor, biopsy (U):      Carcinoma in fibrous tissue.
Blood vessels with lymphoplasmacytic and granulomatous "vasculitis".
Lymph node, peri-aortic, biopsy (AB-AG):      Metastatic carcinoma in seven lymph nodes ([**6-24**]).
Blood vessels with lymphoplasmacytic and granulomatous "vasculitis".
Blood vessels with lymphoplasmacytic and granulomatous "vasculitis" and vascular thrombus.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
[**2141-7-25**] Echo: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) The right ventricular cavity is dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-7-21**], overall rtight ventricular contractile function appears somewhat improved.
There was no evidence of acute blood loss as her HCT remained stable post-operatively.
Her urine output was adequate.
Her SBP was maintained > 90 with aggressive fluid management.
Her EKG was unchanged.
When the hypotension did not resolve after capping the epidural an Echocardiogram performed which showed focal right ventricular hypokinesis.
She had a positive troponin which peaked at 0.2 on post-op day two.
Troponin bumped to max of 0.20, then trended down slightly to 0.06.
MBI negative x3.
EKG when in NSR in the setting of hypotension did not reveal evidence of ischemia, but w/ atrial fibrillation now has new TWI in I, aVL which may represent demand ischemia in LCx distribution.
A statin, BB, and ASA were started for risk factor modification per cardiology.
# Right ventricular hypokinesis:  Severe free wall motion hypokinesis on echocardiogram likely represents small RV NSTEMI.
Repeat TTE [**2141-7-25**] showed somewhat improved RV contractile function.
Remains in NSR with HR 70s - 80s.
An attempt to transition her to Coumadin was abandoned after her INR was noted to be 4.7 after three days of Coumadin at 5mg qd.
She was given vitamin K, her HCT was monitored serially, and there was no evidence of acute bleeding as her INR returned to baseline.
CXR does show evidence of b/l pleural effusions and possible LLL opacity vs. atelectasis, o/w without significant pulmonary edema.
# Leukocytosis:  WBC was max 17.0 without left shift with pt afebrile.
Treated with 3 days of Cipro for presumed UTI, however urine cx showed no growth.
Postoperatively hct has been 24-27, without evidence of bleeding.
