DERM: Left forehead lesion with hypopigmentation and two nevi   Pertinent Results: Bone Marrow Biopsy [**2167-12-19**]: BONE MARROW EXTENSIVELY INVOLVED BY A HIGH-GRADE B CELL LYMPHOMA Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by: a Lambda restricted B cell lymphoma that co-expresses CD10.
MRI L spine [**2167-12-30**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Repeat imaging at the T10 through L1 levels, with T1 and T2 pre- and post-gadolinium images is recommended.
PE [**2167-1-13**] CT abdomen with contrast: IMPRESSION 1.
Please note, this examination was not tailored to evaluate the remainder of the pulmonary arterial vasculature.
If clinical concern remains for acute cholecystitis, a HIDA scan may be of diagnostic benefit.
Probably no interval change in extent or appearance compared to CT of [**2167-12-29**].
# Mantle Cell Lymphoma, blastic variant: The pt had biopsy of his retroperitoneal mass on admission, and the biopsy revealed a high-grade lymphoma.
Further pathology revealed likely Mantle Cell Lymphoma, blastic variant.
Developed febrile neutropenia, CT torso demonstrated no areas of abscess, pt.
Sent for Abdominal CT and incidentally found RLL embolus, started on heparin prior to cholecystecomy.
Surgery consulted, mass was felt on physical exam on RUQ.
Staging MRI of the spine was acquired prior to intrathecal therapy and did demonstrate an improvement.
Cultures drawn 2 days prior during a febrile episode turned positive for yeast, later found to the [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**].
