CXR [**2155-1-8**]:  increased number of lung metastases, small bilateral pulm effusions   Brief Hospital Course: 85yo woman with h/o metastatic follicular thyroid cancer s/p tracheostomy c/b tracheomalacia, with recent treatment for pneumonia and CHF, transferred for trach revision.
Her last echo showed an EF of 55%, but prior to that it had been noted to be 25-30%.
She underwent repeat bronchoscopy, and it was found that the trach was again abutting the area of tracheomalacia.
She received anesthesia with fentanyl and versed during this procedure, which caused her blood pressure to drop.
After the sedation was lifted her blood pressure normalized.
Her NIF was checked and was noted to be 6.
Despite this, her INR continued to rise, so warfarin was not restarted given concern that she would become supratherapeutic.
Goal INR is [**1-25**].
Her digoxin level was therapeutic at 1.0. .
