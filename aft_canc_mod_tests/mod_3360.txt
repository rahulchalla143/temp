# UGIB: Patient found with significant HCT drop from most recent admission 45-->23 and BRBPR on admission.
EGD in unit per GI on night of admission showed a large 3.5cm ulcer was found on the posterior duodenal bulb with a very large adherent clot.
Pt was transfussed 3UPRBC for HCT goal>30 given melena and HCT drop on 1st night of admission.
The patient's Hct continued to trend downward; however, this was difficult to interpret in the setting of the aggressive IV fluids he was receiving to treat his hypotension/tachycardia.
On the evening of [**8-10**], his Hct was found to be 21, so he was transfused 2 units of PRBCs, which he tolerated well.
Hct remained stable in 30s on discharge.
By [**8-11**], his BPs were at his presumed baseline (110-140 systolic), though he was found to be slightly volume overloaded on lung exam.
# Acute on CRF: Patient w/ baseline cr of 1.1 - 1.9, sustained acute renal failure secondary to hypotension in setting of UGIB.
Urinalysis showed [**2-24**] WBC and moderate bacteria.
Continue seroquel, paxil, clonazepam and prn haldol on discharge.
At discharge, blood sugars ranging 78-130 and not requiring any insulin sliding scale coverage.
Electrolytes were monitored and repleted prn.
