He went to [**Hospital3 **] in Methuan where he was found to have fever 101.2 and leukocytosis of 14.
INR was 1.1 and hematocrit 58.6.
Head CT was obtained and showed an intraventricular bleed.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up and management.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, repeat CT head was obtained without change from the OSH study.
EEG showed encephalopathy but no seizure activity.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2199-1-6**] IMPRESSION: 1.
There is a possible tiny, nondisplaced, fracture of the left parietal bone, seen on images 43 and 44 of series 3.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2199-1-6**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Interventricular hemorrhage as described on head CT scan.
ECG Study Date of [**2199-1-6**]  2:43:56 AM Technically difficult study Atrial fibrillation Early R wave progression Extensive ST-T changes Consider left or biventricular hypertrophy .
4) Previously questioned left parietal fracture is not seen on today's study and thought to most likely have represented a small venous channel.
CTA CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2199-1-9**] IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI/A BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2199-1-10**] IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with interventricular hemorrhage.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2199-1-16**] IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO Study Date of [**2199-1-25**] Conclusions: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
The patient's imaging and neurologic exam was stable during hospitalization.
Repeat CT head one week after admission showed decrease in size of intraventricular hemorrhage with stable appearance of enlarged ventricles.
The patient will follow-up with neurosurgery in four weeks with repeat CT head at that time to monitor.
Renal insufficiency: Creatinine elevated on admission to 1.7 and BUN 55, thought pre-renal with response to fluids.
The decreased creatinine later in admission likely represented decreased muscle mass and was not a true increase in glomerular filtration rate.
The patient subsequently had multiple positive blood culture bottles for MRSA from [**Date range (1) 71521**].
The persistently positive blood cultures were believed secondary to an endovascular source; hematoma at site of PICC or seeding of the AAA.
Left upper extremity ultrasound was ordered and showed a hematoma the site of previous PICC.
CT abdomen performed to evaluate AAA negative for change or signs of infection.
The patient should complete an eight-week course of antibiotics from the first day of negative blood cultures, [**1-28**], to treat the bacteremia complicated by hematoma and possible endocarditis or bone spread.
TTE was negative for signs of endocarditis and the patient did not tolerated TEE.
CXR negative.
Platelet count on admission 229 with drop in platelets [**1-24**] from 179 to 109.
The patient was initially on C-spine protection but this was discontinued per orthopedic recommendations when bone scan showed the fracture was chronic.
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime): First dose PM of [**2-9**] with recheck of PT/INR daily, goal INR [**2-9**].
THIS WILL COMPLETE 8-WEEK COURSE FROM TIME OF NEGATIVE BLOOD CULTURE ON [**2199-1-28**].
MRSA bacteremia/septicemia 8. thrombocytopenia/HIT antibody positive .
