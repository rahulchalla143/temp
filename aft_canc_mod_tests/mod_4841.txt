Transplant surgery aspirated 300ccs from the fluid collection and sent for gram stain and culture.
After fluid resuscitation and normalization of blood pressure, the patient again became hypotensive to the 80s, asymptomatic, but the decision was made at that time to admit the patient to the intensive care unit for closer monitoring.
The transplant surgery team came to the ED to drain the fluid collection, approximately 300cc serous fluid was drained.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2154-7-9**]):       2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.

-BCx x2 - NGTD at discharge -UCx - No growth final  Imaging:  CT Abd/Pelvis: ([**2154-7-8**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Further evaluation is limited without IV contrast.
Cirrhosis, splenomegaly, and abdominal varices are similar to prior.
TTE ([**2154-7-10**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Baseline blood pressure appears to be in the 80-90s which is likely a result of her cirrhosis.
Repeat urinalysis was negative for infection.
Blood culture results are pending at discharge.
Cardiac enzymes were within normal limits.
Her BP improved to the 100s systolic upon arrival to the medicine floor and were stable at discharge.
She will have lytes and BUN/Cr checked Monday [**2154-7-15**].
Cr was 2.0 at admission from baseline of 1.1-1.5.
After fluid resuscitation, Cr improved to 0.9 at discharge.
# Crypotgenic cirrhosis: LFTs remained at baseline and her MELD was 7 at discharge.
She received 2 units PRBCs this admission and her Hct was 26 at discharge, baseline is in the mid 20s.
A TTE was obtained which showed only depressed free wall contracility in the right ventricle and pulmonary hypertension.
# Code status this admission: FULL  # Transitional issues: -F/u blood cultures which were pending at discharge -Has VNA arranged to re-apply Wound Vac on the day after discharge, wet-to-dry dressing in place at discharge -Chem-7 and CBC to be checked on Monday [**2154-7-15**], results faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] [**Name (STitle) 85863**] on lower doses of Lasix and spironolactone (20mg and 50mg, respectively).
Outpatient Lab Work Please check Chem-10 and CBC on Monday [**2154-7-15**].
Your blood pressure improved with fluids and was stable at the time of discharge.
Please have your labs checked on Monday [**2154-7-15**], the results will be faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**].
