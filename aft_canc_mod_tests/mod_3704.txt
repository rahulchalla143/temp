After several courses of antibiotics an CT of her neck was done in mid-[**Month (only) **] showing a large mass/collection.
A CT scan was done showing a large abscess/mass causing deviation of the toungue and airway.
A biopsy was done at that time and she was transferred to the ICU postop intubated.
Past Medical History: None  Social History: non-contributory  Family History: Mother deceased from metastatic leiomyosarcoma of the lung  Physical Exam: 99.5   50   158  14  98% on AC 550 x 12, 40%, PEEP 5 Intubated and sedated JP right neck w/ serosang drainage.
FOM soft, oral cavity unremarkable Lungs clear bilaterally Regular rate, bradycardic to 50's abd soft, non-tender  Pertinent Results: [**3-7**] CT Neck: CT NECK WITH IV CONTRAST: A large, heterogeneously enhancing submandibular mass is identified which measures roughly 8.7 x 7.1 cm in greatest axial dimensions.
When compared to the previous CT from [**2195-3-3**], there has been significant interval increase in size.
Note: Tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin and negative for mucicarmine, TTF-1, LCA, p63, S-100 and thyroglobulin.
Left submandibular, tissue biopsy (S07-4674; [**2195-3-3**]):  Atypical epithelial cells, suspicious for adenocarcinoma (see note).
[**3-12**] CT TORSO: CT OF THE CHEST: There is a large incompletely visualized heterogenous poorly marginated mass in the left neck extending into the supraclavicular region.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The liver, gallbladder, adrenal glands, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and loops of bowel appear normal.
CT OF THE PELVIS: The bladder, uterus, and adnexa appear normal.
Large incompletely imaged left neck mass, which is better evaluated on the recent CT of the neck.
Labs at Discharge: [**3-17**] CBC: WBC: 16.1, Hct: 29.8, Plt 367 Chem 10: Na: 142, K: 4.1, Cl: 102, CO2: 30, BUN 24, Cr 0.6, Gluc 96, Ca 9.4, Mg 2.3, Ph 4.5  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transfered to our insitution on [**2195-3-7**] when she was admitted to the SICU, intubated, with a stable ABG.
On HD#3 she underwent an FNA of the neck mass followed by a tracheostomy with the thoracic surgery team.
The pathology from the biopsy at the outside hospital was also reviewed and was felt to show atypical epithelial cells consistent with adenocarcinoma embedded in an inflamed, reactive fibrotic stroma.
A CT of her chest and abdomen was done to assess for sites of metastases or for a primary malignancy for the remote possibility that the neck mass itself was a metastasis.
The scan found no other malignancies and was significant only for a small, 3mm RML pulmonary nodule.
A thyroid ultrasound was attempted to evaluate a thyroid nodule noted on the CT of her neck for possible malignancy.
Once at goal tube feeds her BUN and sodium were noted to be slowly rising.
Her electrolytes should be checked at the rehab facility in order to reassess her hydration status and adjust the free water boluses.
Her WBC count at discharge was noted to be 16 which was slightly increased from 14 several days prior.
A CBC should be checked at the rehab facility at the end of this week.
She will follow up for a PET scan on [**3-19**] and will be readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Ward Name **] on [**3-23**].
