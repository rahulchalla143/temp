Hypodensities in the liver, spleen, and kidneys, unchanged.
[**2164-5-12**] Chest Xray: Pleural effusions are difficult to compare due to positional differences, but a large right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusion are again demonstrated with adjacent basilar lung opacities.
**FINAL REPORT [**2164-5-12**]**     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2164-5-12**]):       Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
The presumed etiology was sepsis, as her blood cultures drawn at [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 8**] (her rehab) were positive for E. coli.
The antibiogram indicated that it was Zosyn, CTX-sensitive, and FQ/Bactrim resistant.
This time her blood cultures grew Enterobacter.
Subsequent blood cultures were all negative but she continued to have low-grade fevers to 100.0-100.5 in the evenings.
Ultrasound was performed which showed no abscess formation.
Urine electrolytes indicated FeNa < 1% but she had little improvement in UOP to fluid challenge.
Renal was consulted and advised a renal ultrasound, which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Her serum creatinine remained stable, and her urine output spontaneously improved after 24-48 hours.
Her urine output increased to normal range.
Power PICC placed for a CT Torso to be performed with desensitization protocol.
It was discussed with her multiple times that her prognosis is poor and further chemotherapy is unlikely to help her disease course.
Since hematocrit was stable, this was restarted prior to discharge.
Prednisone was given prior to CT as patient is allergic to the dye.
# Rash: She had yeast in her urine culture and was started on fluconazole.
