FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position.
When comparison is made with the next previous portable chest examination of [**2166-2-24**], the previously present wide caliber internal jugular vein sheath has been removed.
When comparison is made with the preoperative PA and lateral chest views of [**2166-2-20**], the now increased heart shadow is consistent with postoperative pericardial changes and moderate degree of postoperative mediastinal widening.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
An epiaortic scan was done to identify the aortic cannulation site.

He was transfered to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic monitoring.
On the first post operative day his creatinine increased to 2.5 and renal was consulted.
Based on lab data he was found to be pre renal, no evidence of ATN and received intravenous fluids and allowed blood pressure to be increased due to baseline 150-180.
Creatinine was continued to be monitored and progressively improved over the next few days.
Lasix was resumed and creatinine remained stable.
Plan for coumadin 6mg daily with INR check [**2-28**] for further dosing with goal INR 2.0-3.0.
Warfarin 6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: please check INR friday [**2-28**] and adjust coumadin for goal INR [**3-4**].
