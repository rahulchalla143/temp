His last dilation was [**2164-4-2**].
Unfortunately the esophago-gastric anastomosis biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma.
Today, a family member took his vitals and noted HR 125 and RR 28 prompting referral to the ED by his oncology fellow.
A chest xray revealed a RLL opacity concerning for pna.
2) atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion [**2163-8-19**] 3) RLL PE in [**7-4**] 4) right axillary DVT [**2163-8-17**] 5) LUL PE in [**2164-1-17**] - while on coumadin.
Onccologic History: - [**2163-5-30**]: EGD with large circumferential mass at GE junction.
Biopsy showed adenocarcinoma.
- [**2163-5-31**]: CT abdomen/pelvis with distal esophageal mass and a 3 cm partially necrotic lymph node in the hepatogastric ligament.
EUS staging on [**6-6**] - Tx, N2, Mx.
- [**2163-6-8**]: PET with FDG avid left paratracheal lymph node immediately anterior to esophagus at level of aortic arch, 7 mm, SUV max 4.5, multiple small (2-6 mm) pulmonary nodules too small to fully characterize, and a large 2.9 cm lymph node in the gastrohepatic ligament with SUV max 11.4.
- [**Date range (2) 6545**]: chemoradiation with cisplatin (75 mg/m2, D1 and D29) and 5-FU (1000 mg/m2/day D1-4, D29-32) - [**Date range (1) 6546**]/11: admission for PE (RLL segmental) causing pleuritic chest pain; therapeutic lovenox initiated - [**Date range (3) 6547**]: admission with new atrial fibrillation and acute right axillary DVT.
CT showed improving PE.
Brain MRI showed solitary 1.9 cm left frontal lobe mass.
CT torso with segmental LUL PE (new since [**2163-10-26**]), stable 9 mm right hilar lymph nodes and right upper lobe pulmonary nodules, no clear metastatic disease.
Resection of brain mass on [**2164-1-20**] ([**Doctor Last Name **]) showed metastatic adenocarcinoma, CK7/CK20 positive, TTF-1 negative, consistent with upper GI origin.
- [**2164-2-7**]: Cyberknife to resection cavity - [**3-7**]: dilation of anastomotic stricture - [**2164-3-27**]: CT chest with 7 mm RUL subpleural nodule (previously 5 mm) and new 7 mm LUL nodule, and increased right hilar and mediastinal adenopathy (may be reactive) - [**2164-4-2**]: J-tube placement, dilation of stricture, biopsy of gastric conduit revealed adenocarcinoma - [**5-4**] MRI brain: Marked decrease in enhancement at left frontal resection site.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2164-6-23**]):       SPARSE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
sensitivity testing performed by Microscan.
PERTINENT IMAGING  1.
CXR ([**2164-6-15**]) IMPRESSION:  There is continued opacification of the right lung base, possibly reflecting a combination of pleural effusion with atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.
Upper GI Series ([**6-19**]) No evidence of fistula formation.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis ([**6-20**])   No bowel obstruction.
No CT explanation for patient's presentation.
CXR showed RLL opacity but there was a question of chronicity as this has been seen on prior imaging.
He had a swallow study as well as upper GI series and CT abdomen, none of which saw evidence of a fistula.
There was some concern for reflux of his tube feeds exacerbating his risk for aspiration, however the CT abdomen showed no evidence of reflux of tube feeds into the esophagus.
The swallow study showed one aspiration event with thin liquids and new PO recommendations were made.
One of these sputums grew gram negative rods, so he was switched to Zosyn.
Due to have CT torso in [**Month (only) 205**] with anticipated discussion for further surgical intervention versus restarting chemo.
We uptitrated his metoprolol to 50 [**Hospital1 **] and these episodes resolved.
He will f/u with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1060**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1520**] of [**Company 191**] for further management.
