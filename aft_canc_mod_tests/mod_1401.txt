MICROBIOLOGY (positive studies) [**2145-1-7**] 11:44 am BLOOD CULTURE      Source: Venipuncture.
Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2145-1-11**]): GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2144-12-6**] 8:27 PM Images of the brain appear normal.
MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2144-12-8**] 12:53 PM FINDINGS: Vertebral body height is grossly preserved.
Right uncovertebral joint osteophytes are larger than the left, resulting in severe right and moderate left neural foramen narrowing.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2144-12-16**] 5:37 PM FINDINGS: There have been no significant changes since the previous study.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2144-12-18**] 1:51 PM CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: Moderate ascites is present.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: Rectal tube and Foley catheter are present, with a decompressed appearance to the bladder.
Examination of osseous structures does not show lytic or sclerotic lesions concerning for malignancy.
Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are seen, with a focal scoliosis with an S-shape in the lumbar spine, left convex at L3 and right convex at L4-5, with transitional vertebral body anatomy and slight anterolisthesis of L3 on L4.
Multiplanar reformatted images were also reviewed in our interpretation, supporting these findings.
Grade 1 anterolisthesis of C4 over C5 is again noted and unchanged.
There is mild compression on the posterior aspect of the cord, C3 level, from the orientation of the ligamentum flavum thickening, which is unchanged.
Persistent moderate indentation/compression on the posterior aspect of the [**Last Name (un) **] cord at the level of C3, as seen on the sagittal sequences, not well assessed on the axial sequences due to hardware artifacts.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2145-1-16**] 3:00 PM FINDINGS: Comparison was made with the previous MRI of [**2144-12-23**].
There is mild prominence of extra-axial spaces with prominence of pachymeninges which is unchanged from previous CT examination of [**2145-1-11**].
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormalities or change seen since the previous MRI of [**2144-12-23**] and CT of [**2145-1-11**].
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW Study Date of [**2145-1-25**] 9:35 AM FINDINGS: Video oropharyngeal swallow evaluation was performed in conjunction with the speech and swallow division.
Thin liquid, Nectar-thick liquid, pureed consistency barium, & one-half of a cookie coated were administered.
The pharyngeal phase demonstrated vallecular and piriform sinus residue.
He underwent bronchoscopy which showed thick, pus-like mucus in the airways which grew out oral flora.
A single blood culture grew Fusobacterium and he was treated with PCN.
He developed anuric renal failure which was treated with mitodrine, octreotide, albumin, and IVF and ultimately recovered to baseline renal function.
w/ marked asterixis on exam on admission.
CXR, UA, UCx, and BCx were WNL.
To rule out other causes of ataxia, B12, folate, and RPR were obtained which were all normal.
underwent an MRI of head which showed a normal brain, but incidentally provided evidence of C4,5 [**Month/Day (2) **] cord compression.
MRI of spine showed extensive [**Month/Day (2) **] cord compression w/ myelomalacia at C3 to C7 levels.
Developed tachypnea, hypertension, tachycardia and low grade temps.
CK > 1400, but pt had been w/ persistent thrashing for ~ 1wk.
QTc 450.
Ultimately believed to be consistent with NMS [**12-21**] haloperidol.
CPR was initiated promptly, the patient was intubated and given epi/atropine.
Early in the morning of [**1-8**] the patient became hypotensive, received several IV fluid boluses, and eventually required levophed to support his blood pressure.
Cardiac enzymes trended down post-arrest.
Echo was hyperdynamic without evidence of cardiogenic shock.
The patient had an EEG after his PEA arrest that showed a severe encephalopathy.
CT head was unremarkable.
An MRI on [**1-16**] head showed no evidence of anoxic brain injury.
# Renal Failure: Post cardiac arrest the patient was anuric.
# Fusobacterium bacteremia: One of two blood culturs drawn on [**1-7**] grew out Fusobacterium.
Smear on [**1-14**] showed no evidence of DIC.
Lithium 600mg [**Hospital1 **] per pharmacy, but 450 CR [**Hospital1 **] in OMR, which is a more appropriate for [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray [**Last Name (STitle) **]: [**11-20**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed: for nasal dryness.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization [**Month/Day (2) **]: One (1) treatment Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
An MRI of your brain and neck were done to determine whether the abnormalities in your gait an the tremors were due to problems with your brain or the [**Hospital1 **] cord.
