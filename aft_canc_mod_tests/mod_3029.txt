Per patient report, his blood sugars have been "harder to control lately", despite compliance w insulin 70/30 regimen and diet; reports feeling well, denies fevers, chest pain, dyspnea, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dysuria.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vital signs were  97.7 102 194/64 16 100%RA.
Labs were significant for WBC 11.6, Hct 21.7 (was 38 5months ago), platelets 212, Cr 2.7, INR 4.7.
EKG demonstrated SR at 97 w LBBB unchanged from prior.
CXR did not demonstrate acute abnormalities.
Patient was transfused 2 units blood and was admitted to MICU given concern for his history of CAD and poor EF in setting of GI bleed and resuscitation; vital signs prior to transfer were 98.6 92 160/44 26 97%RA.
On arrival to the floor, vital signs were 95 97/73 18 99%RA.

Diff toxin [**2204-10-9**]- negative .
CXR PA and LAT ([**2204-10-9**]) In comparison with study of [**10-8**], there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure in a patient with previous CABG procedure and elevated right hemidiaphragm.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis ([**2204-9-26**]) CT ABDOMEN: A few patchy airspace opacities in the lung bases are nonspecific but could represent early infection.
Relative myocardial [**Name2 (NI) 13215**] to the blood pool is compatible with severe anemia.
CT PELVIS: The bladder and distal ureters appear within normal limits.
CT Abdomen Pelvis ([**2204-9-27**]) FINDINGS:  CHEST: The base of the heart is enlarged, no pericardial effusion is detected.
The ground-glass opacities that were seen on previous examination is now less clearly identified.
CT Abdomen Pelvis [**2204-10-8**] FINDINGS: Interval decrease in the sigmoid colon wall thickening and in the intramural/intraluminal hemorrhage.
TTE ([**2204-9-26**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2204-4-9**], left ventricular function is probably similar but technical limitations may have led to underestimation of the LVEF in the prior report.
TTE ([**2204-9-29**]) The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2204-9-26**], left ventriuclar systolic function appears similar.
TTE ([**2204-10-10**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Compared with prior study dated [**2204-9-29**], findings are similar.
Findings consistent with a mildly complex cyst corresponding to prior CT abnormality in the lower pole of the right kidney.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo male with complicated cardiac history including CAD s/p CABG ([**2196**]), DES to RCA and protected OMCA ostium in [**2199**] and sCHF with EF 35-40% who p/w lethargy, melena, and hyperglycemia thought to have GI bleed complicated course including hemoperitoneum managed medically w/ bowel rest and decompression, as well as acute on chronic renal failure and UTI/ bacteremia .
# Microcytic Anemia - Pt a/w Hct 21 (most recent prior values 34-38), guaiac pos brown stool; despite patients history of significant CAD, patient asymptomatic on presentation; guaiac pos stool in setting of microcytic anemia was concerning for GI loss especially in patient on coumadin, ASA, plavix; It was unclear if this would be lower or upper GI source.
The patient's hematocrit drifted down to  nadir 22.
GI was following the patient with plan to perform EGD and colonoscopy after bowel prep on Monday, [**2204-9-24**] did not show a clear source of bleeding.
His HCT remained stable while on the floor and was 27 at the time of discharge.
Repeat CT  in the setting of increased abdominal distension showed an increase in the size of the blood collection and the patient was transferred to the Surgical ICU on [**9-27**].
Bladder pressures were increased in the 20-30s however clinically the patient denied pain and was making urine which was made abdominal compartment syndrome unlikely.
The patient did have residual suprapubic tenderness and began to pass small amounts of blood per rectum however a third CT showed resolution of his hemoperitoneum.
# Supratherapeutic INR - on coumadin for LV thrombus, but w INR 4.7 on admission, uncertain etiology.
The coumadin was held and INR gradually drifted down to 1.0.
His increased INR was felt to likely be due to poor nutritional status as the patient also had a low albumin.
Repeat TTE showed no LV therefore coumadin was not restarted.
# Hyperglycemia - Pt reporting elevated sugars at home ~500 without recent change in diet or change in medications; no anion gap; no signs infection on CXR; EKG of limited use given LBBB; no CP to indicate ACS, although given DM, atypical presentation of ACS is possible but cardiac enzymes were trended and ultimately negative.
Urinalysis was negative for infection.
Blood sugars remained elevated and his morning 70/30 was increased to 20 units with some improvement in glucose control.
# Chronic sCHF - Patient appeared euvolemic on exam so his carvedilol was continued.
This was increased from 25 to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] for better blood pressure and rate control His diuretics were initially continued but were eventually held in the setting of increasing creatinine.
# Acute on Chronic renal failure:  Patient had CKD with known baseline creatinine of 4.0.
Over the course of this admission his creatinine peaked at 4.0.
Urine lytes and FeNa (3.3%) were consistent with a intrinsic or post renal etiology.
Renal US did not show hydronephrosis.
His creatinine trended downward and was at baseline at the time of discharge.
#Hypertension: Pt initially hypotensive with SBP in the 100s in the setting of GI bleed.
Now hypertensive with blood pressures as high as the 160s the SICU.
Urine and blood cultures were negative.
Blood and urine cultures were both positive for GNR and ultimately grew  Bacteroides Fragailis in the blood, Klebsiella Pneumonaie and Enterbacter clocacae in the urine.
Repeat TTE was done to r/o endocarditis in the setting of a murmur on exam was negative.
# Hypernatremia: Patient noted to have sodium of 155 while in the ICU believed to be secondary to free water deficit in the setting of poor intake.
Sodium trended downward and fluids were discontinued as the patient increased his oral fluid intake.
EKGs remained unchanged and echo showed left ventricular function that was similar to what was seen on a TTE done in [**4-13**].
He was monitored on telemetry throughout admission and was noted to have a lot of ventricular ectopy.
Repeat TTE showed no evidence of thrombus therefore coumadin was not restarted.
