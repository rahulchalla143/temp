Hyponatremia Profoundly dehydrated on admission, with Na 130, Cl 88.
Serum Osm 260, Uosm 600 which makes SIADH most likely.
Thrombocytopenia Due to chemo regimen; s/p 1u plts in ED prior to CT placement .
Elevated WBC: No evidence of PNA on CXR  Likely due to chronic steroid therapy.
Bcx, urine cx and pleural fluid cx were all sterile, except for 2 bottles on Bcx that showed mixed flora, which was presumed to be a contaminant.
