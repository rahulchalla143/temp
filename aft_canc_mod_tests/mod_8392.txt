IMAGING [**6-10**] CXR FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: A right-sided tunneled line terminates at the upper right atrium, unchanged in position since [**2112-12-13**].
An overlying EKG lead along the left neck limits evaluation of line placement in this region.
A repeat study could be performed with improved EKG lead placement and better patient positioning.
[**6-17**] EEG FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: The background consists of a low voltage, disorganized, delta frequency rhythm seen throughout the recording without any clear state changes.
CT Chest abdomen pelvis FINDINGS:  CHEST:  Left subclavian dialysis catheter terminates in the deep right atrium.
Grade 1 anterolisthesis at L4-L5, with broad-based posterior disc bulge.
Multilevel moderate facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum thickening, resulting in mild-to-moderate canal and foraminal stenoses.
His CXR was not notable but UA showed may WBCs and he was initially started on ceftriaxone.
Later his urine culture grew only yeast so ceftriaxone was stopped.
Repeat chest xray was again not notable, UA again with many wbcs but culture only grew yeast.
The catheter tip culture did not grow anything and multiple rounds of blood cultures were negative.
He then underwent a CT of his chest abdomen and pelvis which did not show any focus of infection.
Fevers from his HCC or from medications were also considered.
An NGT was placed to continue lactulose.
An EEG was performed which did not show any seizures and was most consistent with toxic metabolic etiology.
Because of his decreased diet his blood sugars decreased and we stopped his lantus.
#Blood cultures: some results are pending at the time of discharge  #Notable labs on last check: WBC 11.8, Hct 37.0, Plts 149.
