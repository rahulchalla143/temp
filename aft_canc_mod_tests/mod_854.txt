Admission Date:  [**2104-2-19**]       Discharge Date:   Service:  Medicine/Medical Intensive Care Unit  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 88-year-old female of Philippina origin with a history of bronchial adenocarcinoma, status post right lower lobe and right middle lobe resection in [**2101-12-5**], without chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and with a questionable cerebellar mass, possible metastasis diagnosed in [**2102-6-5**] by head CT which has remained unchanged, and history of mild baseline Alzheimer's dementia who was living at home and fully capable of activities of daily living two days prior to the date of presentation who has a more recent past medical history significant for an appendectomy in [**2103-9-5**] with a perioperative non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, a left femoral popliteal to common femoral lower extremity deep venous thrombosis diagnosed in [**Month (only) **], hypertension, recurrent urinary tract infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus urosepsis in [**2103-10-6**], was in her usual state of health significant for a recent weight loss of approximately five pounds, down to a weight of 65 pounds, until two days prior to admission when she had begun to have a cough productive of some mild sputum and general feeling of malaise with some mild nausea without vomiting, who continued good p.o.
Prior to this presentation, the family did not note any complaint of chest pain, abdominal pain, headache, fever, chills, bright red blood per rectum, seizure activity, urinary or fecal incontinence, and no signs of focal weakness or neurologic symptoms.
A head CT without contrast was obtained which showed no acute changes, per report.
Electrocardiogram showed new right bundle-branch block, first heart sound, Q3, precordial T wave inversions, with no ST elevations or changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia.
Chest x-ray with an official read of mild interstitial edema, questionable right upper lobe infiltrate.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was notable for a temperature of 96.7 upon arrival, a heart rate of 68, blood pressure of 52/41, respiratory rate of 28, satting 86% on a nonrebreather.
General examination revealed a cachectic, anicteric, intubated patient responding to painful stimuli in all four extremities, slightly cyanotic in the fingers, perioral region and toes.
Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat examination revealed left pupil to be post surgical and difficult to evaluate.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a tachycardic regular rhythm with a 3/6 systolic murmur at the second intercostal space on the left side.
Rectal examination revealed normal tone, guaiac-positive.
Neurologic examination was limited by the patient's mental status but revealed 2+ deep tendon reflexes throughout, moved all extremities spontaneously.
The patient had previously been without signs of recurrence by surveillance chest x-ray.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Pertinent examinations on presentation in the Emergency Room revealed a chest x-ray with right pleural effusion, bilateral interstitial edema, and question of no nodules, no clear V-lines, no hilar prominence.
Head CT without contrast was unremarkable for an acute event.
Electrocardiogram as discussed above.
Most recent echocardiogram on [**2103-10-11**] which showed an ejection fraction of 60% with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Pertinent laboratories upon arrival revealed a white blood cell count of 11.9, hemoglobin of 12, hematocrit of 39.3, platelets of 240, a sodium 138, a potassium of 7.3, a chloride of 99, a bicarbonate of 24, a blood urea nitrogen of 94, and a creatinine of 2.2 (up from a baseline of 0.7), glucose of 205.
Coagulations revealed a PT of 15.7, a PTT of 22.9, and an INR of 1.7, fibrinogen level of 520.
Creatine kinase level was 49.
Troponin was 3.
Amylase was 147.
Urinalysis was notable to 6 to 10 red blood cells, status post Foley placement, 0 to 2 white blood cells, and was negative otherwise with 3 to 5 squamous epithelial cells, and 0 to 2 hyaline casts.
Significant question of mass pulmonary embolus on admission with continued hypoxia and oxygen saturations in the middle 80s on 100% FIO2 via endotracheal tube.
Given her history of deep venous thrombosis a CT angiography was obtained on the evening of admission which showed a significant consolidation, questionable large pleural based mass in the right lower thorax.
Status post bronchoscopy, the patient's saturations markedly improved to 100%, and her peripheral cyanosis resolved, and her arterial blood gas essentially normalized.
By the following morning on FIO2 of 40% showed an arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.43, a CO2 of 43, and O2 of 132.
On assist control of 350 cc X 14 with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 7.5.
However, the patient's compliance was low at 12 with a peak inspiratory pressure of 35 and .................... of 31.2.
The patient continued to improve over the subsequent three to four days of her hospital admission but was difficult to wean off the ventilator with moderate secretions, continued low compliance, and low volumes; although, her arterial blood gases remained relatively normal.
The patient continued in relatively stable fashion from a pulmonary point of view, weaning down her pressure support until hospital day 10 when she had increased white count.
Endotracheal cultures at this time were positive for stenotrophomonas and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive Staphylococcus.
Chest x-ray at this time had evolved to show a new left lower lobe infiltrate while the right upper lobe infiltrate had begun to clear.
Her arterial blood gas at that time showed increasing hypocarbia with a pH of 7.3, CO2 of 88, and 02 of 109.
A post reintubation film showed that the patient had collapsed her right upper lobe in the peri-extubation period.
A subsequent film within six hours showed the right upper lobe to be re-expanded.
Her white blood cell count on presentation was normal; although, she was hypothermic, and hypotensive, and with a history of diarrhea diagnosed as a presumptive diagnosis on admission of community-acquired pneumonia.
She continued to be afebrile with a stable white blood cell count until hospital day 10 when she started to have a slight increase in her temperature to a temperature maximum of 101, and with a rising white blood cell count to 17.9 on hospital day 9, and increased sputum production.
Sputum culture at that time were positive for 4+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters and 4+ gram-negative rods which were subsequently identified as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and stenotrophomonas as above in the Pulmonary history.
Throughout her hospital stay the patient's urinalysis had been negative with no other locus of infection was identified or suspected.
She had negative line tip cultures, negative blood cultures, and negative urine cultures throughout her stay.
By hospital day three she was 13 liters positive; however, in the setting of a small presenting body weight of 65 pounds, the patient began to develop moderate edema in her hands and feet; although she never showed signs of being significantly intravascularly volume overloaded.
Electrocardiogram on admission as discussed in the history of present illness.
Subsequent repeat electrocardiograms showed no changes from the prior.
The patient's creatine kinase enzymes which were cycled at the time of admission were negative.
Her electrocardiogram had normalized by the morning on hospital day one.
The patient was restarted on the captopril for afterload reduction on [**2-24**] and titrated up to a dose of 25 mg p.o.
A repeat echocardiogram obtained on [**2104-2-28**] to assess for cardiac function revealed a left atrium that was normal in size with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular inflow pattern suggested delayed relaxation phase, possible degradation of diastolic dysfunction with mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension of approximately 35, estimated, small pericardial effusion.
Left pleural effusions was noted compared to the previous echocardiogram from [**2103-10-11**]; this tricuspid regurgitation and degree of pulmonary hypertension were decreased.
The patient's remained hemodynamically stable with a stable blood pressure and stable heart rate.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION/RENAL:  The patient presented with baseline chronic renal insufficiency as indicated by a baseline creatinine of 0.7; given her body weight.
However, with hydration the patient continued to have adequate urine output, and her creatinine steadily fell during the first four days of hospitalization.
By [**2104-2-20**], her creatinine was 0.6 and remained in the 0.6 to 0.7 range for the reset of her hospital stay with adequate urine output ranging from 30 cc to 100 cc per hour.
KUB films obtained at these times were both negative and within normal limits, and these episodes of mild abdominal pain resolved with bowel regimen and subsequent bowel movements.
Liver function tests were also obtained during the slight abdominal discomfort which revealed essential normal values with an ALT of 19, an AST of 21, and an alkaline phosphatase of 88, an amylase of 20, and a total bilirubin of 0.5, and a lipase of 23.
On completion of her procedures, on [**3-6**], the patient was restarted on her Coumadin in anticipation of discontinuing heparin once her INR reached therapeutic levels.
A right upper extremity ultrasound obtained on [**2-26**] due to a concerning asymmetrical aspect of the patient's upper extremity edema revealed a small amount of obstructive retracted clot within the right internal jugular vein with patent flow around the clot.
LINES:  The patient had received a left femoral triple lumen central venous catheter in the Emergency Department on the day of admission which was discontinued on hospital day 15 for concern of the patient's rising white blood cell count in that period, although there were no local signs of infection, and culture of the catheter tip was negative.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient had a random cortisol level of 113 on the day of admission to rule out adrenal insufficiency.
The patient received periodic glucose monitoring and fingerstick blood sugars which were within normal limits to slightly elevated, but never above 180.
