In the Emergency Room he had junctional bradycardia to the low 40's and that EKG was fast by the cardiology fellow on call.
By report from the ER resident, the rhythm was felt to be most likely metabolic in origin and patient was referred to the MICU for evaluation of his marginal blood pressure and overall tenuous status.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature was unmeasureable, heart rate 40, blood pressure 95/43 with a map of 63, sats 99% on room air.
Anicteric, dry mucus membranes, no oral lesions, no JVD, no lymphadenopathy.
SMA 7, 154, 4.4, 110, 25, 95, 3.0, 69.
Coags 11.5, INR 0.9, PTT 32.1.
ALT 59, AST 61, alkaline phosphatase 78, total bilirubin 0.5, amylase 132, lipase 17, TSH was pending at the time.
Albumin 3.2, calcium 9.3, phosphorus 7.4, magnesium 2.7, CK 470, CK MB 37 and the index 7.9.
Patient's urinalysis showed 30 mg/dl of protein, [**7-18**] red blood cells, 0-2 white blood cells, rare bacteria, less than one squamous epithelial cell.
Chest x-ray showed hazy bibasilar opacifications, also with peripheral right opacification, no cardiomegaly, no effusions, left subclavian line was placed in the SVC.
CT of the head showed no acute intracranial processes.
Echocardiogram done on the patient found him to have a decent cardiac function with a normal LV up to 55% with left ventricular wall thickness cavity and systolic function being normal.
His initial ABG was 7.33, 44 and 56, went up to 7.36, 44 and 54 and chest x-ray done on the 17th showed new bilateral pleural effusions with mild volume overload CHF, persistent left lower lobe opacity and right lower lobe opacity.
While in the MICU the patient also received a nasogastric tube placed and confirmed by chest x-ray to be in appropriate position.
Cardiovascular:  Coronary artery disease, the patient ruled in for myocardial infarction but the echo showed no wall motion abnormality, likely from metabolic stress, therefore no angiography was indicated.
The heart rate eventually moved to sinus rhythm and the patient was functioning normally.
Congestive heart failure, the patient had significant pleural effusions, likely believed to be secondary to diastolic dysfunction.
That improved as the patient's heart rate improved over time.
His oxygen saturation improved over time and the patient had a thoracentesis, diagnosed and therapeutic, on [**3-30**] where over a liter of the patient's thoracentesis fluid was removed and it was determined to be of a transudative nature consistent with the diastolic dysfunction believed from a cardiac analysis.
Sodium was checked and eventually the sodium was brought back to within normal limits.
The patient's renal function corrected quite nicely so that by the time of discharge his BUN and creatinine were within the range of 19 and 1.3 respectively which was considerably improved from his admission levels of 95 and 3.0.
The patient's urine output perked up as well.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  In addition, there was also Atenolol 50 mg po q day which will be started once the patient's blood pressure reaches sufficient criteria of having a systolic blood pressure greater than 110, heart rate greater than 55 on a consistent basis.
