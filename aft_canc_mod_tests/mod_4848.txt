Apparently had called EMS herself and was taken to [**Hospital **] hospital where on initial evaluation was noted to have BP of 175/89, exam notable for being alert, oriented, following commands and moving extremities symmetrically and to have a visual field cut.
She underwent a CT head w/ showed a R P/O 5.8x2.9 cm hemorrhage w/ surrounding edema.
INR was 2.0.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], VS were [**Age over 90 **]F 155/97 90 14 on CMV/AC.
She received versed 2mg prior to repeat CT and was restarted on gtt.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to extensive severe anterior and apical hypokinesis/akinesis, and hypokinesis of the septum and inferior free wall.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
CT head [**2126-2-20**] IMPRESSION: Large right occipitoparietal lobar hemorrhage with surrounding edema and mass effect on the lateral ventricle, unchanged over the short- interval.

K and FFP for INR 2.0, fosPHT 1g, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], but not before being intubated for transport.
Remainder of exam is notable for anisocoria of R < L by ~ 1mm, but reactive, impaired L VF (unable to assess visual fields formally), crossess midline to reach to the L arm to clap, R/L confusion, L pronator drift, LLE UMN weakness ~ 4 to 4-, upgoing L toe, ext.
HOB was elevated at 30 degrees, SBP was maintained 120-160 and MAP < 110.
Her serum osmolarity and sodium were essentially unchanged and mannitol was discontinued.
A non-contrast MRI brain was performed and post-contrast imaging showed a small calcified meningioma, and an unchanged parieto-occiptial infarct.
MRI showed no signs of amyloid.
This was discussed with Neurosurgery, and it was recommended that she undergo repeat screening of this in 1 year.
Exam on discharge was notable for a left field cut, with upper quadrant sparing and a left pronator drift.
CV; The patient had a troponin peak of 0.12, which trended down to 0.04.
Her EKG showed T wave inversions in the inferior and lateral leads.
Echocardiogram showed a depressed EF as well as anterior and inferior hypokinesis.
Her baseline EF is not known.
A liver ultrasound showed fatty infiltration.
