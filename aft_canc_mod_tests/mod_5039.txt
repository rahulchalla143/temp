CAROTID ULTRASOUND [**6-5**]: Less than 40% stenosis of the proximal internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
Neuro consult obtained: His exam was notable for anisocoria but reactive pupils and asterixis.
Otherwise, EEG could be considered non-urgently.
Vascular issues are also very low probability, given that he is lying in bed during the events, has a normal blood pressure, and has no other abnormalities suggesting brainstem localization on exam (other than anisocoria, but normal EOMs).
