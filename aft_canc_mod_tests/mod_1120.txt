HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74 year old man with a pituitary adenoma resection in [**2084**], and hypertension, who was transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] for evaluation of a left parietal occipital lesion with edema and minimal hemorrhage with a midline shift on CT.
He was ruled out for myocardial infarction, VQ scan and was sent for pulmonary function tests after discharge.
Head CT emergently done showed the above lesion in the parietal occipital area.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature is 98.9, blood pressure 108/64, pulse 66, respiratory rate 20, 96% on two liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat was grossly normal.
Pulses 2+ in upper and lower extremities and no lower extremity edema.
At that point, he was readmitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for poor saturation and had an arterial blood gases of 7.5, 33, 44, 24 and 0, and was given BiPAP treatment for about forty-five minutes per day.
At that time, he had a normal CT angiogram and chest x-ray.
On [**2105-8-30**], the patient was transferred back to the floor, continued on Decadron taper, had improved oxygen saturation and was continued on his antihypertensive medications.
The CT angiogram again was negative and lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative.
Bubble echocardiogram was performed that showed an aneurysmal interatrial septal shunt with a right to left shunt but a right heart cath showed that there was no increase in left atrial saturation with oxygen and VQ scan was negative.
It was decided by the pulmonary team after multiple examinations and days of notes and discussions that it was OK to tolerate an oxygen saturation over 86% in this gentleman.It was felt that atelectasis could be part of the issue ?
