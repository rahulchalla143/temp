Pertinent negatives include normal CSF, CT scan unchanged without any acute bleed or midline shift.
She had orthostatics which showed an 18mmg difference between systolic blood pressures standing and sitting, and was given a fluid bolus of 1L.
EEG for 20 minute showed short runs of sharp waves concerning for seizure activity, and so 24-hour EEG was recommended.
Urine and blood cultures were sent.
The 24 hour EEG study was undertaken and no seizure activity was noted.
She was started on valproic Acid to prevent further seizures which she will take once discharged.
CT scan ruled out acute bleed or midline shift.
