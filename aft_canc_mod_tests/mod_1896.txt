Abd CT [**11-9**] HISTORY: 66-year-old male with colon CA and known lung metastases.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast and contrast enhanced axial CT imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was reviewed.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There are numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules, the largest measuring 2.5 x 2 cm, slightly diminished from prior examination where it measured 2.2 x 3 cm within the left upper lobe.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: The liver enhances homogenously and again identified is a small 6 mm hypodensity in the left lobe (segment III), unchanged from prior examination and a larger well defined hypodensity within the inferior tip of the right lobe measuring approximately 11 x 15 mm on current examination, previously measuring 21 x 14 mm which are concerning for metastases.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient is status post diverting colostomy.
His sats and blood pressure remained stable during this time.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring.
Post-extubation c/b emesis, NGT was placed, KUB showed no evidence of obstruction.
Hct was stable after embolization.
- Blood Cx still negative to date .
