Normal barium swallow examination of esophagectomy and gastric pull-up, with no evidence of leak.
[**2197-3-27**]: Chest CT 1.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Chest Xray [**2197-3-31**] In comparison with the study of [**5-29**], there has been an apparent gastric pull through producing soft tissue and gas to the right of the mediastinum.
When the patient arrived on the floor on POD 3 he was doing well, ambulatory, tolerating his J tube feeds and his NGT remained in place with minimal output.
On Post-op day 5 the patient was seen in the morning and his NGT was removed, he was found to be talkative, appropriate and able to sit up in the chair.
On review of telemetry in less than 15 seconds his heart rate decreased from the 60s to the 30s and then he went asystolic.
His pressures responded to a one time 500cc bolus of LR and the following morning, POD 6, when the sedation was weaned, he responded to commands.
An extensive workup for the cause of his asystolic arrest was initiated immediatly after his admission to the ICU -> A bronchoscopy did not show any gross aspiration event.
Cardiac enzymes were normal, as were his other labs.
An echo demonstrated an EF of >55% and did not show any focal wall abnormalities, valvular problems or ventricular dilation.
A CT head was negative for an acute bleed or defect.
A CT Torso was performed that was negative for dissection/embolic filling defect.
The abdomen and pelvis CT images were unremarkable.
His esophagus was negative for leak he was started on a full liquid diet which he tolerated.
