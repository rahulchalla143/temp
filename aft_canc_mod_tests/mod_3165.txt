During her latest admission at [**Last Name (LF) 1562**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] abnormal V/Q scan prompted a CT scan, which revealed a soft tissue mass compressing the left main stem bronchus.
The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for rigid bronchoscopy and stent placement.
Chest x-ray and CT were concerning for postobstructive pneumonia, right upper lobe bronchus occlusion, lymphangitic spread of the cancer.
A Cardiology consult recommended Amiodarone and long-term warfarin for the atrial fibrillation with discontinuation of the flecainide.
A bronchoscopy with stent placement was performed on [**2138-12-16**] without complications.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature maximum 97.9, heart rate 73, blood pressure 112/50, respirations 23, oxygen saturation 89% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count 17.3, hematocrit 34.8, platelets 459,000.
Sodium 134, potassium 4.3, chloride 98, bicarbonate 25, BUN 19, creatinine 0.7, glucose 103, calcium 8.5, phosphate 3.9, magnesium 2.0.
X-ray post stent revealed significant re-expansion of the left lung, resolution of consolidation and infiltrates in the left lower lobe, lingula with patchy infiltrates in the right lung.
Telemetry monitoring after this procedure revealed intermittent periods of sinus rhythm with atrial fibrillation.
On [**2138-12-21**], the patient dropped her oxygen saturation to 83 to 85% on 6 liters nasal cannula and was placed on a nonrebreather mask.
On [**2138-12-23**], the patient underwent a repeat bronchoscopy which revealed tumor tissue in the left main stem bronchus just proximal to the proximal end of the stent.
