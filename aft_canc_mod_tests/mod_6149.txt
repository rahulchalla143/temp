[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 39933**] records: per the wife he awoke yesterday am feeling weak w/ difficulty getting out of bed.
He was taken to [**Hospital3 4107**] where he was evaluated with a "normal" head CT and then transferred here for further care.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: -S/p cath [**2191-8-4**]: mid LAD 40% lesion with an ostial D1 40% lesion, unchanged from elective cath in [**2188**] -S/p cath [**2188**]: mid LAD 40% lesion with an ostial D1 40% lesion 3.

Mediastinal lymphadenopathy measuring up to 13 mm in short axis diameter.
Given a history of bladder cancer in this patient, close followup or further evaluation is recommended.
[**10-10**] MRI Brain IMPRESSION: 1.
No definite intracardiac shunt was identified by agitated saline contrast study (but views are technically suboptimal).
Numerous smaller recent infarcts seen on the MRI are not visualized on this exam.
Recommend short interval follow up CT for reassessment.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
A TTE did not reveal a cardiac source of embolus.
[] Intracerebral/Intracranial Hemorrhage - During the course of anticoagulation for embolic stroke, the patient was noted to have a PTT that elevated quickly from the 71.7 to 103.9 with possible suggestion of petechial hemorrhages on an NCHCT obtained to evaluate the area of completed infarction.
A subsequent NCHCT revealed that he developed a left frontal lobar hemorrhage that did not correspond to a prior area of infarction seen on prior imaging.
In discussion with Radiology, his MRI on further review showed subtle signs suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, the most likely etiology of his hemorrhage.
Further discussions with his HCP and family indicated that he would not want aggressive measures to be taken, and thus he was extubated and made Comfort Measures only.
