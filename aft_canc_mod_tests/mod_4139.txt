Smear c AML-  REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: R/o Infection v/s neoplasm, right hip pain- please evaluate CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
TECHNIQUE: Axial images through the chest, abdomen and pelvis with oral and IV contrast.
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There are bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, ureters are normal.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The distal ureters and bladder are normal.
There are small subcentimeter bilateral inguinal lymph nodes, not meeting CT pathologically pterion.
[**1-4**] CXR Overall interval improvement in the previously visualized multifocal opacities, with residual opacities in the left retrocardiac region and left lung apex opacities.

FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT    FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING    The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR, Glycophorin A, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens:  2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11c, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 33, 34, 41, 56, 64, 71, 117.

Platelet count appears decreased; giant forms are not present.
A 100-cell differential shows:  Blasts 59%, Promyelocytes 6%, Myelocytes 1%, Metamyelocytes 2%, Bands/Neutrophils 10%, Plasma cells 13%, Lymphocytes 8%, Erythroid 4%.

There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2132-11-25**], the overall LVEF has improved (normal).
Evaluation at his PCP revealed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] WBC of 3 with 74% blasts.
He was transferred here for further evaluation where bone marrow biopsy demonstrated AML.
Following HIDAC therapy in late Noevember, he had a rebound in his platelets, but his WBC count remained low.
A repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**1-8**] revealed bone marrow cellularity of 10% consisting mostly of an infiltrate of immature mononuclear cells consistent with blasts, present in small clusters, with very limited erythropoeisis and abnormal appearing megakaryocytes.
His chest CT when he presented showed extensive disease.
The patient was called out of the unit and gradually improved to the point where his abx were weaned to meropenem and fluconazole was substituted for ambisome.
His LFTs were stable and a CT torso showed no abdominal pathology to explain his pain.
His ambisome was initially decreased to 3 mg/kg, but was eventually discontinued on [**1-4**], with his creatinine reaching a peak of 1.6 before trending down to 1.2 with fluids.
He was discharged on meropenem with a CXR on [**1-4**] showing overall interval improvement in the previously visualized multifocal opacities, with residual opacities in the left retrocardiac region and left lung apex opacities."
FENA was 2.2% indicating that patient was not pre-renal.
Creatinine reached a peak of 1.6 but decreased to 1.2 with fluid rehydration.
Patient has follow-up appointment on discharge from hospital with dermatological surgery for excisional biopsy of nevus, and will need to make a follow-up skin exam with dermatology in 6 months.
Hypertension and tachycardia - Throughout his admission, he was found to be tachycardic from 90-110 and was initially hypertensive with SBP in the 150s.
A repeat echo was ordered prior to discharge and his EF was found to have normalized.
Please make a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital 2652**] clinic in 6 months for follow-up skin exam [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1971**].
