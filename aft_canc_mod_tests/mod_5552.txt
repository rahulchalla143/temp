When EMS saw the patient she had a heart rate in the 160's with a systolic blood pressure in the low 100's and the patient was brought to [**Hospital1 69**].
In the Emergency Room as part of the work-up, the patient received a VQ scan which was markedly positive for a pulmonary embolus showing no perfusion of the entire left lung and of the right lower lobe.
The stage is T2, N0, M0 grade 3 with estrogen receptor negative and her 2/neu positive.
4) Coronary artery disease with a question CHF from diastolic dysfunction with a normal EF on echo pre chemotherapy in [**2111-5-29**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation to the medical ICU vital signs, temperature 98.7, heart rate ranged from the 140's to 160's, blood pressure systolic 100/50's, respiratory rate 36-40, oxygen saturation 93% on 70% cool neb.
Neck exam, JVD approximately 9-10 cm above the sternal notch and it was bounding.
Cardiac exam, she was tachycardic to the 150's, S1 and S2 were normal.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal exam soft, nontender, non distended, positive bowel sounds.
GU exam, femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ on the left, trace on the right.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 11.5, hematocrit 29.9, platelet count 339,000, SMA 7 with sodium 139, potassium 4.2, chloride 102, CO2 17, BUN 10, creatinine 0.6, glucose 204.
PT 13.6, PTT 26.8, INR 1.2, CK 27.
Differential on the white count, 85 neutrophils, 8 lymphs, 7 monos, .1 eo, .4 bands.
On the red blood cells her RDW was 18, her MCV was 75, there was 2+ hypochromia and 2+ anisocytosis and 3+ microcytosis with 1+ poikilocytosis.
There were no red blood cells, there were 33 white blood cells with few bacteria and 9 epithelial cells.
Free T4 and TSH levels were pending.
Chest x-ray, enlarged heart, perivascular haziness right greater than left, likely asymmetric CHF.
CT head without contrast.
CT head with contrast, unofficial read showed an 8 mm basilar tip aneurysm on the left.
VQ scan showed decreased ventilation to the right lung diffusely, abnormal perfusion to the left lung and right lower lobe.
EKG showed supraventricular tachycardia at a rate of 164.
There was an S in lead 1, a Q in lead 3 and an inverted T wave in lead 3.
To obtain an echocardiogram to assess RV function.
Heparin with a target PTT of 60-80.
Neurologically the CT with contrast showed no metastatic disease in the brain, however, an 8 mm aneurysm at the left basilar tip was shown.
We will pursue an echo to assess for RV function.
We will cycle CK's and obtain serial EKGs.
The patient will be started on Heparin and a hypercoagulable work-up will be pursued with the test that can be sent on Heparin.
