A head CT was obtained and showed a right pareital stroke as well as 3 old subcortical strokes.
Of note, during his last admission neurology was consulted for concerns with difficulties with complex spatial tasks and a recent fall.
His exam was notable for mild inattention, difficulty with calculations, mildly unsteady tandem gain, left neglect with spatial tasks and signs of apraxia.
MRI showed bilateral parietal gyriform enhancing lesions of unclear etiology with etiologies ranging from subacute stroke to leptomeningeal metastasis to cerebritis.
An LP to rule out infection (WBC 1, RBC 90 with 0 polys, 57 lymphs and 43 monos, protein 67 and glucose 60) and cytology to rule out malignant cells in CSF was recommended.
ASA 325mg daily was also initiated with further stroke evaluation (carotid dopplers MR angiogram) to be completed.

CT PERFUSION HEAD: CT perfusion of the head demonstrates a large defect within the right middle cerebral artery territory on mean transit time with a corresponding blood volume abnormality indicative of a large area of evolving infarct.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY HEAD: CT angiography of the head demonstrates complete occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery at the M1 region with subtle distal flow in the sylvian branches.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates subacute infarct in the right parietal lobe seen on the previous MRI of [**2150-8-5**].
CT angiography of the head demonstrates near complete occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery at M1 region with minimal distal flow as described above  MRI/A: There is an acute right middle cerebral artery territorial infarct identified as seen on recent CTA examination.
There are linear areas of susceptibility abnormalities identified in the right parietal cortex at the site of previously seen infarct on the MRI of [**2150-8-5**].
In addition, signal abnormalities are seen in the left parietal lobe and also along the medial aspect of the left parietal lobe on diffusion images, some of which were present on the previous MRI and could be subacute infarcts.
However, the abnormalities in the medial aspect of the left parietal lobe on diffusion were not clearly seen on the previous study and could be interval infarcts but they are difficult to assess on ADC map secondary to motion.
MRA HEAD:  The head MRA demonstrates non-visualization of the right middle cerebral artery beyond its proximal M1 portion.
MRA shows complete occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery in the M1 region without visualization of the distal branches.
Patient was monitored in the ICU and there was no complications, with stable head CT at 24 hours.
CT brain on [**8-24**] did not show evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
On [**8-25**], ASA 81 qd was started.
The speech and swallow evaluation determined he could have po feeds under 1 to 1 supervision.
