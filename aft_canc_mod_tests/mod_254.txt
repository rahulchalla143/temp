She then developed hydrocephalus and had VP shunt placed on [**1-6**] and repeat VP shunt operation on [**1-14**] secondary to her failure at clamping trials.
Prior to discharge she was noted to be febrile to 103 on [**11-13**] temp spiked to 101.5 with a productive cough, influenza was negative so she was discharged on levofloxacin, completed course [**1-21**].
Three sets of blood cultures and urine culture negative.
Got CXR, cultures, urine and shunt tapped.
ID was consulted who recommended holding on Abx given lack of source, did not feel that VP fluid cell count was indicative of shunt infection, more likely blood.
