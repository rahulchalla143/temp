An area of T1 hyperintensity adjacent to the ring-enhancing structure may represent an area of hemorrhage or a second area of enhancement  CT Head [**2-22**]: Status post left craniotomy with moderate pneumocephalus and small amount of hemorrhage in the surgical bed.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**2-22**]: Postoperative changes status post resection of a left parietal lobe mass, with a tiny focus of possible enhancement along the inferior margin, which could represent a tiny focus of residual disease versus artifact related to volume averaging.
CT Head [**2102-2-24**]: 1.
Compared to the prior CT from [**2102-2-22**], there has been interval collapse of the surgical cavity and decrease of the pneumocephalus.
No evidence of new sites of hemorrhage, hydrocephalus or transtentorial herniation  CT Head [**2102-2-28**]: 1.
A CT Torso was obtained and ruled out other lesions.
Post-op imaging showed a gross total resection.
Her neurological exam remained stable.
A stat Head CT was performed, which demonstrated a slight increase in edema near the surgical bed, but now acute hemorrhage or infarct.
