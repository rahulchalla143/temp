Chest x-ray revealed on [**2196-11-25**], increased interstitial and alveolar opacities.
Subsequent chest CT showed worsening of diffuse interstitial and alveolar lung disease with nodular densities in different locations, progression of septal lines, ground glass and consolidation.
Open lung biopsy was recommended but the family opted not to proceed.
His oxygen saturation was in the 70s on 100% nonrebreather.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 98.7, heart rate 90 to 94, respiratory rate 22 to 30, blood pressure 99/60, oxygen saturation 78 to 82% on BiPAP.
The chest showed tachypnea, using accessory muscles, poor air movement, diffuse crackles over all lung fields.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 50.0, hematocrit 38.1, platelets 135,000, 75 neutrophils, 5 bands, 16 lymphocytes, 1 monocyte.
Prothrombin time 14.6, partial thromboplastin time 41.0, INR 1.5.
SMA7 revealed sodium 136, potassium 4.6, chloride 93, bicarbonate 33, blood urea nitrogen 31, creatinine 1.1, glucose 187, calcium 8.6, phosphorus 4.8, magnesium 2.2.
Troponin was less than 0.3, CPK less than 40.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, heart rate up to 100, left axis deviation, ST depressions in I, aVL, V3 through V6, ST elevations 1.0 millimeter V1 through V2.
Chest x-ray showed increased right pleural effusion with interval worsening and air space disease.
The patient was maintained for as long as possible, however, his oxygen saturation eventually decreased, underwent cardiopulmonary arrest and died on [**2196-11-27**].
