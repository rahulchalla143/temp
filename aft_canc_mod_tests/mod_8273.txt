CT Chest [**9-30**]: 1.
These can be re-evaluated after treatment with follow-up chest CT. 4.
For her MDS, per primary oncologist baseline WBC 30s, HgB ~8.5, Plt 30s.
Guaiac was not done due to lack of bowel movements.
Creatinine on admission was found to be 1.6.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  -PNA/HYPOXEMIA: Transferred from OSH [**9-29**] with respiratory distress after 3 days of ceftriaxone, azithromycin and lasix for treatment of PNA vs CHF in the context of hypoxemia (79% RA-->90% 3L NC), bilateral infiltrates on CXR, lower extremity edema and BNP 1780 .
There was also concern for leukostasis given her h/o MDS and WBC elevation (51.4k from baseline 20-30k).
Echo showed EF 55-60% with mild AI and MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Name (NI) 153**], pt alert, appeared comfortable, but inital sats in low 90s on 5-6L simple facemask with desats to mid 80s.
CT chest [**9-30**] showed small bilateral pleural effusions, diffuse ground-glass opacities suggestive of hemorrhage, infection, or drug reaction.
Oncology consulted, peripheral blood revealed marked monocytosis but few blasts so pulmonary leukostasis less likely than PNA.
Outpatient transfusion threshold Hgb<8.
LDH high, but in setting of malignancy this is unreliable.
On d/c HgB was 8.5, which per outpatient oncologist is near baseline.
Fractional excretion of urea not suggestive of pre-renal etiology.
Cr trended 1.6-1.2 over ICU course.
No dysmorphine RBCs on urine sediment.
Over admission creatinine hovered at between 1.3 and 1.5.
She recieved gentle hydration on the floor and was discharged with Cr 1.5.
Plts 31 on admission (15-30 baseline), increased to 80 with 1 unit plts prior to PICC line placement which trended down to 23 day of discharge.
Bone marrow biopsy would be indicated as outpatient.
INACTIVE ISSUES: GLAUCOMA: continued on home medications INSOMNIA: on Lunesta at home which is non-formulary; treated with PRN trazodone HTN: on amlodipine and lisinopril at home; home meds held for SBP 100-120s throughout ICU stay, lisinopril also held for [**Last Name (un) **] DEPRESSION: continued on home Lexapro  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:  # FULL CODE # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: On 3-4L O2 requirement on d/c.
f/u guaiac to r/o bleed as cause of inappropriate response to previous transfusions, although lack of bowel movements from blood catharsis is reassuring.
Plt found to be 23 on day of discharged so was transfused one unit of apheresis platelets on way out.
f/u CBC twice a week to trend f/u CBC twice a week to trend (PLEASE FAX RESULTS TO ONCOLOGIST [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] AT [**Telephone/Fax (1) 112228**]) # Will need followup with Primary Oncologist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2048**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 112227**] at [**Hospital 23925**] [**Hospital 47799**] Hospital  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Information was obtained from Patient.
1 DROP BOTH EYES Q8H 2.
We did a CT scan which showed changes consistent with an infection, although it does not rule out other causes of low oxygen.
We started you on antibiotics that cover a wide range of bacteria and your oxygen saturation improved.
Speaking to your primary oncologist, we found that your baseline white blood cell count was in the 30s, hemoglobin is around 8.5 and platlets are around 30k.
