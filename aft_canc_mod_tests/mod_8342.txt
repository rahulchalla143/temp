Pertinent Results: EKG [**2130-11-25**] Wide complex regular tachycardia consistent with ventricular tachycardia.
Ventricular rate is about 170.
EKG [**2130-11-27**] Demand ventricular pacing with ventricular premature depolarizations and underlying atrial fibrillation.
Compared to previous tracing of [**2130-11-26**] increased ventricular ectopy is now noted.

[**12-5**] CHEST X RAY S/P THORACENTESIS ON LEFT: In comparison with the study of [**12-4**], there has been removal of a substantial amount of pleural fluid on the right.
ECHO [**11-27**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-4-28**], the pericardial effusion is new.
