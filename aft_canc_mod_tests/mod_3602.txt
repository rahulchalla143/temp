Diagnostic abdominal aortogram and celiac arteriogram, supra selective left hepatic artery catheterization with microsphere embolization of bleeding arterial branch.
Exploratory laparotomy, evacuation large amount of intra-abdominal blood and hematoma, cautery of right hepatic lobe ruptured hepatoma  3.
HCT was 27.
CT scan of the abdomen revealed a 3x3 cm right lobe hepatic mass with 1.4 cm vascular aneurysm and active extravasation of blood into peritoneum and a large amount of blood in peritoneum.
She was intubated, fluid resuscitated, and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
ABNORMALITY #2: The background was slow, typically in the 5 Hz range, and disorganized.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an average rate of 96 bpm.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, infection, and anoxia are among the common causes of encephalopathy.
The degree and evolution of the encephalopathy is uncertain and should be correlated with clinical exam or if follow up EEG if necessary.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2113-11-22**] 4:49 PM  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 79 year old woman with abnormal EEG, altered mental status, vent dependent REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please evaluate for structural cause of altered mental status CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
COMPARISON: CT head from [**2113-11-9**].
Diagnostic abdominal aortogram and celiac arteriogram, supra selective left hepatic artery catheterization with microsphere embolization of bleeding arterial branch.
Her hypothermia was normalized as was her coagulopathy.
Over the next several days her hematocrit stabilized and acidemia improved.
Drain outputs diminished and she was diuresed with Lasix with good response.
Because of concern for aspiration a Speech and Swallow evaluation was obtained on [**11-6**] and showed "silent" aspiration with severe oropharyngeal dysphagia.
ENT service was consulted and their exam showed senechii and dried blood with some areas of erosion overlying the mucosa.
A CT scan of her head was obtained ( [**2113-11-9**]) and showed no acute pathology.
On POD 8 a RUQ ultrasound was obtained and showed normal vascular flows and cirrhotic liver.
Blood, sputum, urine and line cultures were sent and eventually returned with MRSA from her sputum as well as blood.
Hematocrit continued to be stable.
