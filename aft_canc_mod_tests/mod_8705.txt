She is s/p mediastinoscopy complicated with mediastinal hematoma s/p evacuation and electrocautery control of a bleeding lymph node vessels as well as a right sided hemothorax s/p pig tail placement and removal with pathology of all lymph nodes negative for carcinoma.
Her right sided pleural effusion is small and stable on chest radiograph from [**2162-11-29**] following removal of the pig tail catheter.
C-section x2.
Lymph node, level 5, excision (F): No malignancy identified.
[**2162-12-2**] ECHO: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF ?60%).
[**2162-12-2**] CXR: Comparison is made with prior study performed the day earlier.
[**2162-12-3**] CXR: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again increased opacification in the left mid and lower zones consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis.
14 mm nodular opacity overlapping posterior end of right seventh rib is better evaluated on the prior chest CT.  An irregular nodule in the right upper lobe seen on chest CT is beyond the resolution of the radiograph.
Her chest xray showed a large left pleural effusion and atelectesis and subsequent CTA of the chest ruled out PE and confirmed a large right effusion.
She required BIPAP for periods during the day and over night after extubation but that was short lived and eventually she was weaned off of oxygen completely with room air saturations of 94%.
Patient was kept overnight with heart rate well controlled and ambulating with nursing on POD9 with heart rate not exceeding 95 and was allowed to be discharge home with visiting nurse care.
