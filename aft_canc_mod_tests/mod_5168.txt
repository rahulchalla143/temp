Pertinent Results: CT [**2131-5-14**]: FINDINGS: Patient is status post bifrontal craniotomy for extirpation of extensive metastatic (melanoma) involvement of the cribriform plate and paranasal sinuses.
MRI Head [**2131-5-12**]: FINDINGS: There is an enormous collection of gas, with a 2-tiered fluid level, with T2 hyperintense components superiorly and T2 hypointense components on the more dependent side of the fluid collection.
However, review of the preoperative study appears to show some clival enhancement extending towards the right porus acusticus.
The fluid may have blood components accounting for the two-tiered appearance, noted above.
