His CP occured with hct of ~24 (baseline 36) and resolved with blood transfusion and his hematocrit remained stable ~35.
EGD in the MICU revealed short segement of Barrett's esophagus, non-erosive gastritis and non-bleeding dudenal polyps.
Pt then moved to the floor where he underwent bowel prep and had a colonoscopy which revealed 2 sessile benign-appearing polyps 7-8mm in size that were not removed given the pt's anticoagulated state.
He is no longer bleeding and his hematocrit is stable.
Pt is paced, so it is impossible to definitively rule out acute STEMI, but his serial ekg's did not meet sgarbosa's criteria.
