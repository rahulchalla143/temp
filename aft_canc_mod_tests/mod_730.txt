[**2116-2-18**] head CT scan: 1.
[**2116-2-18**] neck CT scan: 1.
[**2116-2-18**] Abdominal X-ray: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern, no evidence of small bowel obstruction.
CSF immunophenotyping [**2116-2-23**]: Review of the cytospin shows few scattered large atypical cells, morphologically highly suspicious for involvement by the patient's previously diagnosed large cell lymphoma.
CT abdomen & pelvis [**2116-2-26**]: 1.
Renal USG [**2116-2-28**]:  Study was somewhat limited due to labored breathing of patient and inability to hold breath.
MRI Head w/o contrast [**2116-3-3**]: 1.
Limited study in the absence of gadolinium and in the presence of patient motion.
Further imaging with contrast recommended to assess interval change.
UNRESPONSIVENESS: Given known CNS lymphoma, the pt's altered mental status was concerning for hemorrhagic event or critical mass effect, which were not found in the original CT scan and appeared  unlikely given overall regression on imaging and lack of systemic anticoagulation.
After a two week delay in chemotherapy (because of multiple systemic issues) a repeat MRI of her head showed a small increase in size in her hypothalamic and right frontal periventricular lesions.
Her SpO2 was always >95% and her respiratory rate was within normal parameters.
On [**2116-3-12**] her respiratory rate increased as well as the snoring.
Hypernatremia: The patient was diagnosed with central DI supported by urine osms and lytes which required DDVAP and later improved.
Her UOP was adequate and matching fluid input.
All the infectious work up was negative at this time, including urine cx, blood cx, and c diff.
Her dilantin was originally held due to supra-therapeutic levels.
Dilantin takes several days to reach steady state so on Dilantin levels were on target at 12.6 (total dose corrected for albumin).
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The pt has a baseline creatinine of [**12-12**].3.
Her creatinine peaked to 3.6 and was slowly trending down.
# HTN: Early in the hospitalization, blood pressure was controlled with alpha-methyl dopa.
