At the OSH, he received a MRI of the cervical spine on [**2-24**] that showed an enhancing, likely malignant extradural lesion at the level of mid C5 to mid C6 displacing the sac and cord posteriorly.
Pt also underwent a MRI of the brain that showed diffuse age related changes but no evidence of malignancy.
He is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further oncologic and neurosurgical care.
Melanoma: as above; initial diagnosis in [**2100**], 2nd lesion in [**2103**], 3rd [**2106**]; never had staging CT 2.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a hypodense lesion in the segment 7 of the right lobe of the liver that measures 2.7 x 2.1 cm and could represent a liver metastasis.
It measures 50 Hounsfield units in the noncontrast images and could represent metastasis, but is not well characterized in this study.
In the abdomen, there is a lymph node in the left paracolic gutter (series 4 image 46) that measures 8 mm and is of a normal significance.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, distal ureters, prostate, and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.
There are small mid iliac lymph nodes that do not meet CT criteria for pathology.
IMPRESSION: 1) Innumerable pulmonary nodules consistent with metastasis.
[**2-27**] MRI cervical spine: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Small axillary lymph nodes, but none of them meet CT criteria for pathology.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a hypodense lesion in the segment 7 of the right lobe of the liver that measures 2.7 x 2.1 cm and could represent a liver metastasis.
It measures 50 Hounsfield units in the noncontrast images and could represent metastasis, but is not well characterized in this study.
In the abdomen, there is a lymph node in the left paracolic gutter (series 4 image 46) that measures 8 mm and is of a normal significance.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, distal ureters, prostate, and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.
There are small mid iliac lymph nodes that do not meet CT criteria for pathology.
IMPRESSION: 1) Innumerable pulmonary nodules consistent with metastasis.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility, and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained.
Small amount of air is seen in the lateral ventricle and frontal subarachnoid space, which could be also postoperative in nature.
[**3-6**] head CT: COMPARISON: MRI performed 3 hours prior.
[**3-8**] CTA chest: CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The pulmonary arterial vasculature is well visualized down to the segmental branches.
The heart, pericardium and great vessels are visualized within normal limits.
Additionally seen are multiple small bilateral pulmonary nodules, which are not significantly changed since the prior examination, consistent with metastatic disease.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were essential in delineating the pulmonary arterial vasculature.
IMPRESSION:  1) No definite CT evidence for pulmonary embolism.
4) Stable appearance of hypodensity within the right lobe of the liver suspicious for a metastasis  [**3-10**] MRI C-spine: PROCEDURE: An MRI of the cervical spine with and without contrast.
COMPARISON: Comparison is made to previous examination of [**2106-2-27**].
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal and axial T1 and T2, as well as post-gadolinium, T1 axial and sagittal images of the cervical spine were performed.
MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: There has been interval resection of the previously described intradural extramedullary lesion at the C5-C6 level.
Spinal cord edema at the level of resection, seen on previous exam but unclear whether increased as the spinal cord had been severely compressed.
COMPARISON: Head CT [**2106-3-10**].
FINDINGS: The study is being compared to prior examination dated [**2106-3-16**].
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change compared to prior exam dated [**3-16**], [**2106**].
[**3-25**] MRI T and L spine: INDICATION: A 71-year-old man with metastatic melanoma, recent resection of cervical spine intradural mass, now with possible incontinence.
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1, T2, inversion recovery images of the thoracic spine; multiplanar T1, T2, and inversion recovery images of the lumbar spine.
Thoracic spine MRI: No cord compression seen.
[**3-17**]: LP positive for malignant cells-melanoma   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 26122**] is a 71 year-old man with past medical history significant for melanoma (3 separate lesions) s/p wide local excision who presented on this admission with recurrent melanoma and a probable met from mid C5 to C6 displacing sac and cord posteriorly.
Posterior cervical laminectomy, C4, C5, C6, resection of extramedullary intradural spinal cord tumor was performed.
Repeat head Ct's did not demonstrate evidence of hydrocephalus and serial neuro exams were unchanged.
Staging CT on admission showed extensive metastatic disease throughout chest and abdomen.
MRI of L and T spine obtained on [**3-25**] and demonstrated drop mets in cauda equina.
LP on [**3-17**] returned positive cytology for melanoma.
After extensive work-up including infecious, negative CTA for PE, ultimately felt to be due to pneumonia, most likely aspiration.
He was largely asymptomatic, exam was much improved and repeat chest x-rays demonstrated resolution of pneumonia.
Post operatively while on neurosurgical and MICU services, patient's blood pressure became difficult to control.
Patient's blood pressure becoming more labile over [**Date range (1) 26123**].
Patient had extensive work-up at that time including repeat head CT, LP, EKG, ABG, toxic-metabolic work-up which revealed no significant new cause of altered mental status.
Large number of red cells also consistent with prior surgery and blood in ventricles from surgery.
Hyperactive bladder-Detrol was initially continued, but then stopped.
Thought to be secondary to hit, although hit antibody negative x 2.
Serotonin assay sent and pending at this time.
