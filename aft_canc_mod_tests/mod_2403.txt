IMAGING ============== HEAD CT [**2139-9-30**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  [**2139-10-10**] There are mild bibasilar atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 year-old male with a history of cerebal palsey, mild mental retardation, atrial flutter s/p cardioversion, Pulmonary embolisms in [**2134**], [**2138**] on coumadin admitted with bleeding from a peripheral blood draw site with INR 19.
He was treated with vitamin K and given lovenox bridge when INR <2.0, his course was complicated by pneumonia, and rectus sheath hematoma.
Hematocrit remained stable.
Head CT was negative for acute hemorrhagic stroke.
Patient underwent ablation of inferior epigastric arteries, though no active rectus sheath bleeding was noted on IR.
Subsequent serial HCTs were stable and increasing to 37.3 on discharge.
Sputum sample was unable to be islated as patient was unable to produce forceful cough.
Ileus: On [**2139-10-8**] he had abdominal distention and worsening abdominal pain, plain film showed ileus.
Hct was checked and noted to be down 32->24, but the stool was guaiac negative.
INR was 3.0.
CT scan showed a large rectus sheath hematoma without evidence of active bleeding.
Because repeat Hct did not appropriately increase after transfusion, he was given an additional 1 unit PRBC and transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.
This was performed and once patient's INR was therapeutic ([**2-5**]) he was discharged.
EKG did not reveal U waves.
# EKG changes: admission EKG was remarkable for ST Depressions in V4-5 which appeared more prominent in comparison to EKG from [**2138-11-21**].
Serial EKGS showed persistence of ST Depressions in V4-5.
Given his obesity, cerebral palsy, and other co-morbidities, lifestyle modifications may be difficult or impossible, and his primary care physician may consider [**Name9 (PRE) 44072**] him on a metformin regimen.
# Anticoagulation: The patient was noted to have a stable INR 2.8->2.8->3.0 when taking 2mg warfarin daily.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR on Monday [**2139-11-2**].
We checked your blood level and found that you had not lost a significant amount of blood.
We stopped your coumadin, gave you a blood transfusion, and your blood level stabilized.
