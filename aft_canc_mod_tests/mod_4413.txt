HCV VIRAL LOAD (Final [**2200-7-25**]): HCV-RNA NOT DETECTED.
A large fraction of the cells contain a single, centrally located, prominent nucleolus.
By immunohistochemistry, the lesion cells are diffusely positive for the pan-B-cell markers CD20 and co-express CD10 and BCL-6, but are negative for BCL-2 and CD30.
IMAGING ======= CT CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST ([**7-25**]) HISTORY:  61-year-old male with cirrhosis, awaiting liver transplant, now found to have B-cell lymphoma on the lateral aspect of the tongue, now in need of staging.
STUDY:  CT of the torso with contrast; MDCT images were generated through the chest, abdomen and pelvis after the uneventful IV administration of 130 cc of Omnipaque intravenous contrast.
FINDINGS:  CHEST:  The visualized portion of the thyroid demonstrates a 21 x 12 mm evidence nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid and an 11 x 8 mm nodule in the right thyroid lobe, similar to prior exam (2:3,7).
Hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver is not changed since prior exam and measures 10 mm (2:60); an additional hypodensity in the left lobe of the liver measures 10 mm, and is unchanged from prior exam (2:57).
Recommend multiphasic CT or MRI as clinically indicated.
