Pager#[**Serial Number 24741**]   Brief Hospital Course: *This patient passed away on [**8-12**]* Mr. [**Known lastname 24413**] is a 73 yo M with multiple medical problems including DM II (admissions for hypoglycemia), HTN, HL, DVTs and afib on coumadin, dCHF, CKD (Cr 2.2), EtOH abuse, who recently presented [**2148-7-29**] to [**Hospital1 18**] after having a mechanical fall in the setting of new persistent anorexia, generalized fatigue, weight loss (unknwon amount), and RLE cellulitis and was admitted to the MICU after becoming hypoxic to the 70s in the ED and needing to be placed on nonrebreather.
He was found to have a right pleural effusion on CXR with findings concerning for HAP.
Mr. [**Known lastname 24413**] was found to have signifcant pulmonary edema on CXR and a renal consult was obtained to help guide diuresis.
Thoracentesis performed in MICU showed Labs were consistent with transudative effusion: serum Protein ratio 0.45, LDH ratio 0.43, 375 WBC, pH 7.42.
Serologies negative for HCV, HBV, but AFP was elevated at [**Numeric Identifier 24742**].
He was diuresied but serum Cr increased.
Serial exams did not indicate an acute intraabdominal process.
Exam was non-tender.
An abdominal U/S on [**8-1**] demonstrated liver masses, which in the setting of cirrhosis and transaminitis with AFP of >14,000 is particularly concerning for HCC.
A CT biopsy was delayed because of his coagulopathy with a climbing INR of 3.2 likely [**2-13**] liver dysfunction.
In addition, an abdominal MRI was also delayed becuase of his tenuous renal function with a climbing Cr of 4.1. .
Per their recs, a biopsy was not necessarily needed to diagnose HCC in this gentleman with known cirrhosis and AFP of 15,000.
Labs were not drawn after [**8-9**] and goals of care concerned primarily for comfort and palliative medical management.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: During his ICU stay, his serum creatinine began to climb from his baseline of 2.2, up to 4.0.
Upon transfer from 2nd MICU stay back to medicine floors, his creatinine and BUN continued to climb.
His sodium was trended, pt remained asymptomatic.
His serum glucose was actively titrated with insulin while admitted to the MICU.
Fingerstick schedule was reduced to QAM and QPM monitoring for pt comfort.
# Iron deficiency anemia: His hct remained stable, with no s/s of bleeding.
His EKG had ST depressions, but he was asymptomatic.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Liver malignancy - metastatic, likely HCC Acute on chronic renal failure Recurrent pleural effusions  Discharge Condition: Deceased   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 24413**],  It was a pleasure taking care of you during this hospitalization.
