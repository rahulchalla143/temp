ED labs showed HCT of 15.1.
NGT aspirate showed no frank blood suggestive of brisk bleeding.
HCT s/p transfusion stabilized at 28-29.
An EGD showed a gastro-jejunal anastomotic ulcer oozing blood, which was treated thermally.
The patient's BP increased to SBP to the 140s-150s, and she remained non-tachycardic.
She was transferred to the medical service with continued HCT and hemodynamic stability.
Thus, though an upper GI source is likely for this presentation, concomitant lower GI pathology cannot be excluded and rpt colonoscopy or flex sig should be persued.
[**Year (4 digits) 8304**] Pain: The patient reports several types of pain: (a) [**Year (4 digits) **] back pain secondary to lumbar instability, s/p lumbar spine fusion in [**2162**], (b) [**Year (4 digits) **] oral pain s/p several dental implants over the last 10 years, and (c) "gas" pain s/p gastric bypass in [**2177**].

)(s)* Refills:*1*  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Blood loss, anemia .
In the emergency room, laboratory tests and studies showed that you had lost a significant amount of blood over the last 4 days but were not actively bleeding.
You also had an endoscopic study, which showed an ulcer at the connection made between your stomach and small intestine during your gastric bypass surgery.
Your symptoms continued to improve, and your blood tests and clinical condition suggested no further clinically significant bleeding.
A blood test looking for a bacterium called H. pylori, which can increase the risk of stomach ulcers, is still pending at your discharge.
CONTINUING CARE: As we discussed, you will need to repeat an endoscopic study in 8 weeks.
Please STOP taking the following medications: Losartan Atenolol Your blood pressures were normal in the hospital without these medications, but your primary doctor may start you back on these medicines if your blood pressures rise in the future.
Your blood pressure was well controlled on this lower dose while you were here.
You will need a repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks.
You are also overdue for colon cancer screening and evaluation of your lower gastrointestinal tract.
