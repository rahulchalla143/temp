Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission laboratory studies that were pertinent include CBC with a white count of 5.8, 90% polys, hematocrit 28 down from baseline of 30.
Chemistry panel revealed a sodium of 128, potassium 6.1, chloride 98, bicarbonate 22, BUN 57, creatinine 1.6, glucose 102.
PTT 2.7.
Subsequently, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital 1739**] Medical Service on [**2128-12-16**] and an arterial Doppler of the lower extremities on [**2128-12-17**] revealed a significant flow deficit to both ankles.
Her initial ICU course was notable for CT of the chest revealing right lower lobe consolidation, bronchoscopy with bronchial alveolar lavage yielding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus for which she was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin.
The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] Medical Intensive Care Unit course was significant for repeat bronchoscopy that yielded similar findings to prior with Staphylococcus aureus islet.
Repeat blood cultures that were final were negative on final determination.
