CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis on [**2154-2-18**] revealed generalized lymphadenopathy beginning at the crural lymph nodes and extending inferiorly into the periaortic, mesenteric, celiac, pararenal, common iliac, and external iliac chains.
He was referred for a CT of his chest on [**2154-2-19**] which showed prominent adenopathy, principally in the left supraclavicular and left axillary regions, with the largest mass measuring 2.6 cm in his left axilla.
Based on that, he was referred for excisional biopsy of the right inguinal adenopathy on [**2154-2-26**] which revealed follicular lymphoma with partial marginal zone differentiation, grade I-II by large cell quantitation.
These cells were CD19 and CD20 positive and also co-expressed CD5 and CD10.
His lymphoma was felt to represent a transitional state between follicular lymphoma and marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.
He underwent a PET scan on [**2154-5-1**] after the third cycle and this continued to show extensive FDG avid disease.
He underwent a second PET scan on [**2154-6-12**] which showed little significant change, with hyperactive adenopathy at the left axilla and extensively below the diaphragm in the mesentery, para-aortic and pelvic regions.
He underwent a second excisional biopsy on [**2154-7-2**] which again showed follicular lymphoma, grade I-II.
The decision was made to hold on further R-CVP as his lymphoma was no longer responding to the current therapy.
CYTOGENETICS  CD19 and CD20 positive, also co-expressed CD5 and CD10, and kappa light chain restricted; no expression of CD-23 or cyclin D1; Ki67 was 20-30%.
CHEMOTHERAPY HISTORY  [**Date range (1) 83066**]: He received cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone plus rituximab (R-CVP) x 3 cycles; the vincristine was discontinued due to neuropathy.
[**2154-5-1**]: PET Scan showing extensive FDG avid disease  [**Date range (1) 83067**]: continued on R-CVP for two additional cycles, but after the fifth cycle, he noticed the recurrence of right inguinal lymphadenopathy.
[**2154-6-12**]: repeat PET - little interval change  [**2154-7-2**]: repeat lesion biopsy - similar findings  [**2154-8-5**]: transferred care to [**Hospital1 **], presented with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy; received 4 cyclyes R-Bendamustine by local oncologist at time of transfer; planned for two more cycles of R-bendamustine  [**2155-1-22**]: Mobilization HiDAC, final cumulative CD-34 yield of 5.19 x 10e CD-34 cells/kg over three days, discharged on Cipro, Neupogen and Compazine.

Given that the etiology of these findings is unclear, whether there is true portal vein reversal or possibly more proximal thrombus, we would recommend focused MRI of the abdomen including 2D time-of-flight sequences (with saturation bands to determine directionality of flow) through the portal vein to clarify this issue.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2155-5-2**] 12:31 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-4-21**], the findings are similar.
CT TORSO:  [**2155-5-23**] 1:53 PM CHEST CT: Bilateral small pleural effusions, on the left increased as compared to the prior study and the right slightly increased as compared to the prior study.
Limited evaluation of the liver due to lack of i.v.
Limited evaluation of the liver due to artifacts.
CXR: [**2155-6-6**] FINDINGS: Indwelling support and monitoring devices are similar in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 56 year old male with PMH of follicular lymphoma transitioning to a marginal zone lymphoma s/p R-CVP admitted for BEAM auto-SCT (C1D1 ([**2155-3-26**]) and as per BMT protocol, initiated carmustine day -7, followed by etoposide/cytarabine on days -6 to -3, then melphalan on day -2 ([**2155-3-31**]).
Respiratory distress - The patient was tachypneic to the 40s on admission to the ICU and had an increasing oxygen requirement, thought to represent attempted compensation for metabolic acidosis and low lung volumes with atelectasis.
CT imaging was unremarkable for an infectious source.
Although cortisol levels were normal, suggesting against adrenal insufficiency, the patient was trialed on a three day course of steroids, which temporarily improved his pressures and removed his pressor requirement.
A cortisol stimulation test was performed to better assess for impaired adrenal response, did not reveal any significant abnormal findings.
For the rest of his ICU course, the patient was maintained off of pressors and perfusion was monitored by assessing mental status.
He mentates well with a blood pressure of 60s systolic.
Autonomics recommended continuation of midodrine and a trial of florinef to be started at rehabilitation.
Florinef will be started at low dose (0.1 mg daily) and can be uptitrated based on patient response to a maximum of 0.4 mg daily.
Leukocytosis - Elevated WBC count beginning [**4-13**] with persistent hypotension.
Much later in the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, a re-elevation in his white blood cell count corresponded with a new positive sputum culture for Pseudomonas.
A large volume paracentesis was performed with fluid sent for cytology and flow cytometry, which was not revealing.
It is felt that this was a colonizer only as surveillance blood cultures were negative.
Transaminitis/Hepatic Failure - Right upper quadrant ultrasound and abdominal MRI demonstrated reversal of flow through portal vein, suggestive of cirrhosis.
Rising INR and worsening mental status were suggestive of progression to hepatic failure.
Liver biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease.
The patient was then started on a defibrotide treatment protocol on [**2155-4-9**] with close monitoring of coags, plts, hct, fibrinogen due to concern of bleeding (goal INR < 1.5, plts > 30, Hct > 30, Fibrinogen > 150).
LFTs peaked [**Date range (1) 14806**] with TBili 10, then trended down gradually.
After 25 days of treatment for defibrotide, a head MRI revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which necessitated discontinuation of the treatment.
The patient subsequently continued to show gradual, mild improvement in functional status, but continued to have large ascites on exam requiring periodic taps.
Currently he is requiring paracentesis every 10-14 days and his ascites should continue to be monitored and tapped PRN.
Through his ICU course, his LFTs gradually improved; however, his bilirubin did remain elevated at 2.9 on discharge.
He was started on low dose amphetamine salts at 5mg [**Hospital1 **] to increase his energy and blood pressure.
Abdominal x-ray and CT scan were negative for obstruction.
Midodrine was started in an effort to improve the patient's blood pressures so that he could be transitioned to HD.
Neutropenic fevers - On admission, patient was kept on broad spectrum antibiotics for neutropenic fevers (vancomycin/cefepime/ganciclovir/micafungin).
Patient was culture negative and no source of infection was identified.
Hyperglycemia: Patient with blood sugars persistently between 200-300.
He will need ongoing monitoring and upon discharge from rehabilitation center follow-up with his primary care provider.
Blood pressure: SBPs 50-80s with good mentation.
If concerned about blood pressure, monitor for change in mental status.
