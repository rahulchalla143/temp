Admission Date:  [**2110-8-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-9-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-9-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Fatigue and pancytopenia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bone marrow biopsy  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 21540**] is a 57 year old with a PMH significant for HIV with a recent admission at [**Hospital1 34**] for pancytopenia.
There he was found to be pancytopenic with WBC 1.9, Hct 16.5, Plt 11.
His bili, AST/ALT were also mildly elevated.
He presumably underwent bronch which was neg for PCP (per patient).
CT chest/abd was only notable for fatty infiltration of the liver, spenomegaly, and mild atelectasis.
After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was thus transferred for further work up.
Repeat labs performed the day prior to admission at [**Hospital1 34**] demonstrated WBC 1000 (WBC 1000 - 23 poly, 65 lymph, 12 mono, 1 nuc.rbc), hgb 7.9, hct 22.8, platelets 21.
He was readmitted and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of pancytopenia.
Of note, bone marrow biopsy slides were sent to [**Hospital1 112**] for further read.
In the ED, T 98.1, HR 100, BP 107/70, RR 18, 96%RA.
Physical Exam: VS Tm 99.3 Tc 100.7 105/26 92 20 99%RA Gen: NAD, lipodystrophy changes HEENT: perrl, eomi, sclerae anicteric, MMM, op clear without lesions, erythema, or exudate.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).

During workup for pancytopenia, DIC labs were sent and were negative, as were peripheral smear for schistocytes, as well as hemolysis labs which were consistent with a moderate amount of hemolysis.
PCR of parvovirus returned negative and IgG Ab was found to be positive and IgM was negative.
Ehrlichiosis serologies were still pending at time of admission from OSH records.
A chest CT in the OSH has shown no airway disease.
The patient was transfused two times since admission for a Hct less than 21.
On [**8-30**], pt underwent bronchoscopy for the evolving hypoxia.
ABG performed at the time was relatively unchanged from prior, showing a respiratory alkalosis and possibly worsened A-a gradient (PO2 83.)
CXR showed no consolidation/pneumothorax.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he transitioned back to 4LNC, satting 96% with reassurance by his partner and nursing, suggesting a likely anxiety component to his acute SOB, as respiratory rate improved from 40s to high 20s.
CTA was obtained to rule out PE.
Unfortunately, he again became increasingly hypoxic and chest x-ray on [**2110-9-2**] showed rather rapid progression of bilateral parenchymal densities and his respiratory state decompensated to the point of needing intubation and vent dependency.
During this time he also had dramatic ARF indicated by rapidly rising BUN/Cr and LDH levels >[**Numeric Identifier 7923**] and markedly rising LFTs indicating rapid multi-system organ failure.
