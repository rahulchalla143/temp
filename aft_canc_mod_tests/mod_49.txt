There was no clear evidence of pneumonia or other primary pulmonary process on chest x-ray or on examination.
Hypotension:  The patient was hypotensive on admission with blood pressure as low as 60 over palpation in the emergency department.
In addition, cosyntropin stimulation test was performed to evaluate for adrenal insufficiency.
She displayed labile blood pressure during her entire admission and required occasional fluid boluses to maintain her mean arterial pressure greater than 60.
Upper GI bleed:  The patient was admitted with hematocrit of 22 and signs of GI bleed including bright red blood per rectum.
EGD on [**2172-7-5**] demonstrated a bleeding mass in the stomach suspicious for malignancy of the linitis plastica type.
On admission, the patient was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells raising her hematocrit to 27.
Hematocrit was monitored closely during her hospital stay and the patient was transfused an additional time to raise her hematocrit to greater than 30.
Her hematocrit remained stable at 30 during the majority of her hospitalization, indicating that GI bleed had stabilized after her admission.
After this decision was made, the patient's blood pressure was observed to trend down slowly and the patient's respiratory status was maintained with ventilation.
