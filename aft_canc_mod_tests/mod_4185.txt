At presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED vitals were: T 98.4, HR 120, BP 146/80, RR 30, O2Sat 96% (10 L neb).
CXR was obtained.
An ABG was performed and was 7.16/125/120 (was sent under wrong patient's name).
Patient subsequently became more somnolent and repeat ABG showed 7.21/116/70.
Due to somnolence, head CT was performed and prelim negative.
Vitals prior to transfer to the ICU were: HR 107, BP 122/83, RR 14, O2Sat 98% (CMV, VT 400, RR 14, FiO2 60%, PEEP 7).
Past Medical History: 1) COPD, largely emphysema (FEV1/FVC 29, FEV1 24% pred [**6-/2113**]) - s/p bullectomy with RUL resection in [**2106**] - 4L of oxygen at baseline 2) Colonic polyps 3) History of embolic stroke which had hemorrhagic conversion s/p heparin [**2110-7-22**] (frontal and occipital) 4) History of PFO 5) Factor V Leiden heterozygosity 6) Hyperlipidemia 7) Inguinal hernia 8) Right ventricular dysfunction, likely due to pulmonary hypertension 9) Polycythemia, likely due to hypoxemia 10) Eczema   Social History: Worked as a security guard (vs computer scientist) at [**University/College **] library.
Physical Exam: VS: T 99, HR 91, BP 117/65, RR 16, O2Sat 91% (intubated with AC VT 400, RR 14, PEEP 7, FiO2 60%) GEN: NAD HEENT: PERRL, does not track movement, oral mucosa moist, NECK: No [**Doctor First Name **], no JVP elevation PULM: Coarse, but diminished breath sounds with crackles and left anterior base, prolonged expiratory phase with inaudible air movement in expiratory, copious thick secretions suctioned from ET tube CARD: RR, nl S1, nl S2, no M/R/G ABD: BS+, soft, non-tender, non-distended EXT: No C/C/E SKIN: Diffuse dry skin with some icthyosis of BLE and some psoriatic skin changes around face NEURO: sedated, pupils reactive   Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: 11.8>13.9/44.0<258 N81.0, L8.7, M9.6, E0.4, B0.3  PT 52.8, PTT 46.5, INR 5.8  142/4.4/98/42/17/0.5<132 proBNP 299 Trop T <.01  7.21/116/70  Studies:  [**2113-11-10**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-8-10**] the rate has increased and intraventricular conduction delay is now present.
Though he had no history of fevers, cough, or chills, his elevated WBC count to 11.8 with 81% neutrophils as well as CXR findings of patchy opacities consistent with a pneumonia.
At discharge, he was on face tent with Fi02 55% with O2 sats 89-92%.
Patient needs repeat CXR at 6 weeks to ensure that bilateral lower lobe opacities seen on imaging this admission resolve.
If these imaging abnormalities are not resolved on repeat CXR, he will need high resolution chest CT to further evaluate his lung parenchema.
Coagulopathy: He had elevation of his INR to 5.8 at admission.
Negative head CT for bleed in the ED was reassuring.
Hct remained stable and his Coumadin was restarted at his home dose prior to discharge.
He will need INR checks after discharge and his dose may need to be readjusted.
Goal INR is [**1-10**].
Diastolic heart failure:  He was given IV fluids on admission and during his stay for hypotension.
He was then aggressively diuresed as his chest xrays looked like pulmonary edema.
His ECG was unchanged and he was ruled out for MI.
Recon Soln(s) 5.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Hypercarbic respiratory failure Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Pneumonia  Secondary Diagnosis: Chronic diastolic heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Has transferred from bed to chair since extubation, requires assistance   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath.
You have been wearing a face mask to help the oxygen levels in your blood.
You should have your INR checked after discharge and your Coumadin dose should be changed accordingly.
You should have a follow-up chest xray in 6 weeks to assess for resolution of your pulmonary edema or stability of your lung disease.
