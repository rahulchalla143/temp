His CT showed left MCA sign and his CTA shows left ICA occlusion( can not rule out carotid dissection) and MCA occlusion.
his CTP shows increased mean transit time and reduced cerebral volume and decread CBF.
He was given tPA at 323am, but tPA was held due to severe vomiting and headache( also noticed trace blood in the emesis).
His exam then worsened at 430am and he had hemiplegia and worsening aphasia.
His score is 18.
