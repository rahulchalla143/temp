Work-up at that time consisted of a CXR as well as bloodwork.
On admission to the BMT service, the patient underwent head CT, which showed a 1.3 cm hemorrhage in the left cerebellar hemisphere.
Past Medical History: - History of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with a MIB fraction of approximately 100%, but no features of Burkitt's.

Imaging: ======== CT HEAD [**2150-5-12**]: New parenchymal hematoma in the left cerebellar hemisphere, with minimal surrounding edema and minimal mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
CXR [**5-20**]:  No previous images.
CT abd/pelvis [**5-14**]: 1.
Stable small gastrohepatic, celiac and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are not enlarged by CT size criteria.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 y/o F with PMHx significant for diffuse large B cell lymphoma, sarcoidosis, who was admitted earlier today with ataxia and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after head CT revealed cerebellar bleed.
# Cerbellar Mass: When she first presented head CT revealed a left cereballr bleed.
Subsequent MRI revealed an underlying mass.
She had an LP with the CSF showing many white blood cells many of which appeared malignant and flow cytometry revealed B-cell origin cells with CD20 expression, suggesting CNS involvement of her lymphoma She was started on high dose methotrexate on [**5-16**] and tolerated this well.
Her ataxia and left side dysmetria improved.
Her last treatment was in 12/[**2147**].
You will likely need a repeat LP at that time.
