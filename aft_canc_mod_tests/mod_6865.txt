She underwent a right middle lobe wedge resection of a lung mass on [**2145-2-19**], with pathology revealing a 2cm atypical carcinoid tumor with satellite lesions.
In [**8-1**], a CT showed disease progression with an enlarging right upper lobe mass, a stable right hilar mass, and a liver mass that had increased in size.
Her most recent CT scan on [**2146-7-12**] demonstrated a small increase in the size of her right lung mass with an increase in both the size and number of her hepatic metastases.
She is now considering treatment with RAD-001 plus a novel [**Doctor Last Name 360**] on a clinical trial which is expected to open this summer.
