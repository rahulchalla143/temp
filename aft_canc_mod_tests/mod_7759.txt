After transfer from the MICU, the patient's blood pressure remained stable in 100-120's.
Persistent fingersticks less than 70 while in within the MICU.
Morning cortisol was <7 with cosyntropin stimulation test elevation from 4.2 to 17.1.
Given hypotension and potential infection, would anticipate higher cortisol levels.
Although after transfer from the MICU, his blood sugars were monitored and the patient remained normoglycemic.
History of pulmonary embolism:  per prior notes, had evidence of EKG changes suggestive of PE as well as an echo with right ventricular hypokinesis/dilatation and a D-Dimer >[**Numeric Identifier 6085**].
In house, initial concern for PE given admission hypoxia and hypotension, but hypoxia resolved as well as issues with hypotension and CT scan was not pursued.
Lung Cancer: Currently receiving chemotherapy on carboplatinum and taxol.
COPD:  Maintained on inhalers with goal O2 sat of 92-96%  #.
Flonase 50 mcg/actuation Spray, Suspension Sig: [**11-23**]  Nasal once a day as needed for allergy symptoms.
