History of Present Illness: 72 F with h/o small cell lung cancer s/p chemo/XRT (finished [**3-/2106**]) and recent LLL wedge resection ([**2106-6-22**] with biopsy +adenoca at [**Hospital1 34**]), COPD, [**Hospital 2754**] transferred from [**Hospital3 5365**] where she presented with frontal headache x 3 for cerebellar mass.
She had a head CT that showed cerebral mass.

CT Torso [**2106-7-16**]:  IMPRESSION: 1.
Prominence of the intrahepatic biliary ducts and common bile duct may relate to gallbladder resection, however, correlation with liver function tests is recommended to exclude obstruction.
MRI Brain [**2106-7-16**]: FINDINGS:  There is a heterogeneously enhancing mass centered in the left cerebellar hemisphere measuring 4.1 x 3.6 cm (10:7).
CXR [**2106-7-19**] The Port-A-Cath catheter has been inserted through the right subclavian approach with its tip at the level of superior mid SVC.
CT head [**2106-7-20**] Expected small amount of blood at the surgical site in the left cerebellar hemisphere with expected postoperative pneumocephalus.
MRI [**2106-7-21**] Post-operative changes related to left suboccipital craniotomy and resection of the left cerebellar mass.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 F with h/o small cell lung cancer s/p chemo/XRT (finished [**3-/2106**]) and recent LLL wedge resection ([**2106-6-22**] with biopsy +adenoca at [**Hospital1 34**]), COPD, [**Hospital 2754**] transferred from [**Hospital3 5365**] where she presented with frontal headache x 3 for cerebellar mass.
On [**7-16**], she had a Brain MRI/WAND study that confirmed the cerebellar mass, associated edema was noted, but the 4th ventricle remained patent.
On admission, her serum NA was 127, she was given IVF but her serum NA worsened, going down to 125.
A CT torso was done which was negative.
On [**7-17**], her serum NA remained low (126) and IVF were stopped and she was fluid restricted.
Her serum NA came up to 130 by the evening.
On [**7-18**] her serum sodium was stable at 131 and she awaited OR planning.
On [**7-19**] her serum sodium was rechecked and she was found to be at 138.
She had serum Na 130 on [**7-22**] and fluid restrictions were restarted.
She had a follow up CT which showed no hemorrhage.
Repeat Na check was stable at 127 so she was started on salt tabs.
On [**7-24**] the patient was neurologically stable but her Na dropped to 121.
On [**7-25**] 800cc fluid restriction was continued and the patient's Na continued to improve.
Information was obtained from Patient.

OxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  5-10 mg PO Q4H:PRN pain 8.
