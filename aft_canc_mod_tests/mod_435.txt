HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Sixty-year-old male with history of renal cell carcinoma with recent CT scan showing right subcranial/hilar mass 6.9 x 3.5 cm with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction and right lower lobe collapse presented on the admission date to Interventional Pulmonary for bronc.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history is significant for renal cell carcinoma, diagnosed in [**5-/2104**], radical right sided nephrectomy, RAF, left renal mass, two cycles vial II.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs on admission, temperature 99.3 F, heart rate 60, blood pressure 164/88, respiratory rate 22, O2 saturation 93% on five liters nasal cannula.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory studies on admission, white blood cell count 5.8, hematocrit 34.4 with previous one 34.7, platelet count 159,000, INR 1.2, PTT 23.7, sodium 132, potassium 5.0, chloride 97, bicarbonate 21, BUN 34, creatinine 1.6, which was 1.3, the last check, glucose 238, ALT 38, AST 45, alkaline phosphatase 99, total bilirubin 0.7, albumin 2.5 and the blood cultures were drawn and were pending at the time of admission.
Chest x-ray showed right lower lobe collapse/consolidation and large right pleural effusion questionably on preliminary.
HOSPITAL COURSE: His course was respiratory alkalosis, post-obstructive right lower lobe infiltrate with strep pneumo in two out of two blood cultures from admit.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] plan is to wean him off his O2 nasal cannula, once he gets admitted to the rehabilitation to keep O2 saturations greater then 92%.
Prior to his discharge, he had an ultrasound done, which was with a questionable right sided effusions, which were found not to be effusions and mostly tissue and no need for tap at the time by IP service.
The patient was planned on following up with Oncology later on and to continue his Levo-Flagyl since his cultures have been negative so far.
His acute renal failure that he presented on admission has resolved and he is now down to 0.7, it was thought to be probably most likely secondary to pre-renal state, given BUN and creatinine ratio close to 20 and also the patient being dry on examination.
In terms of heme, his hematocrit has remained relatively stable.
He has normal LFT's normal platelets and he refused digital rectal examination but we are guaiacing all of his stools.
We repleted his electrolytes PRN and his tachycardia has remained sinus tachycardia since admission and on discharge date, he still continues with the mild tachycardia.
