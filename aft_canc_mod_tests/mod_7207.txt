As for her cancer diagnosis, CT of the chest in [**Month (only) 958**] revealed pulmonary embolus but also findings consistent with locally advanced lung cancer.
She had a CT guided needle biopsy on [**3-28**] and that showed poorly differentiated nonsmall cell cancer.
It was CK 7 positive, TTF-1 positive, and CK 20 and S 100 negative consistent with primary lung cancer with elements of large cell lung cancer with some squamous features.
She underwent a bone scan and an MRI of the brain, which were all negative.
In the ED, a CT revealed a large pericardial effusion and ECHO revealed tamponade.
Her SBP was in the 60s but rose to the 80s with 4 Liters of fluid.
Slight progression of a right paratracheal lymph node was noted on CT [**2110-12-8**], as well as a node anterior to the SVC.

CTA [**5-9**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Pericardial Fluid Exam [**5-9**]: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS consistent with metastatic   non-small cell carcinoma of the lung (patient's slide of lung cancer [S06-[**Numeric Identifier 96473**]] reviewed).
Right ventricular systolic function is  normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-5-9**], the pericardial  effusion has resolved.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: The patient is an 82-year-old female with recently diagnosed nonsmall cell lung cancer who underwent pericardiocentesis and window for large pericardial effusion seen on CT and ECHO and tamponade now stable in the CCU.
She did quite well with no chest pain and repeat ECHO revealed no further fluid accumulation.
The fluid showed malignant cells, hence was secondary to her underlying stage III lung cancer.
She had a slight temo on [**5-10**] and Levofloxacin was commenced and cultures sent.
A repeat ECHO showed resolved effusion around the heart.
# Pleural Effusions: She was breathless at times with effusions on CXR and CTA.
The fluid revealed  rare atypical cells of uncertain significance, Mesothelial cells, scattered lymphocytes and neutrophils.
# Tachycardia: Per OMR notes, pt had HR 99 in [**Month (only) 958**].
Her blood pressure was stable and she was oxygenating well on room air.
