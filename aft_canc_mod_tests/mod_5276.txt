Initial head CT at [**Hospital3 **] noted a hyperdense lesion in the right posterior temporal lobe with suggested intraparenchymal hemorrhage versus metastatic lesion.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation of possible intraparenchymal bleed.
Additional medications received at [**Hospital3 **] include zofran 4mg x 1 and fosphenytoin loading dose.
Neurosurgery evaluated patient and found her exam concerning for unresponsiveness and posturing, although with no other acute surgical issues.
