[**Hospital1 **] tumor lysis labs were monitored without evidence of acute tumor lysis syndrome.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**6-11**] showed NO DISEASE.
HiDAC therapy was complicated by a morbilliform rash, thought to be [**2-25**] ara-C, as pt had similar rash during 7+3 induction chemo, for a which a biopsy was consistent with chemotherapy-induced reaction.
He developed new fevers on [**5-18**] and metronidazole was started after abdominal CT on [**5-20**] showed concern for panninculitis.
Due to increasing delerium, LP was performed on [**5-24**].
CSF showed no evidence of infection.
At this time, additional sources of fever included right subscapular pleural effusion, which was unable to be sampled due to need for CT guidance and patient's clinical status.
There was concern raised on head CT for mastoiditis, but clinical evaluation of mastoids did not correlate with CT finding.
A left subclavian central line postdated the start of these fevers, and did not appear infected clinically nor did blood cultures drawn from this line grow positive.
Multiple viral PCR's, including CSF HHV6, CMV, EBV, and HSV along with serum EBV, CMV, and HHV6 were negative as well.
The only positive culture data was when the pt grew rhinovirus on BAL so was given IVIG.
The patient had a right heart cath on [**5-14**] which showed evidence of tamponade physiology which did not improve after drainage of approximately 250 cc fluid.
Repeat echo on [**5-17**] could not exclude constriction but no tamponade physiology noted, EF 65%.
Repeat CT scans and TTE on [**5-26**] showed resolution of pericardial effusion but persistent constrictive physiology due to pericarditis.
# Hypernatremia: Developed hypernatremia [**5-24**] with Na rising from 143 to 149.
Urine osms were notable for appropriate concentration of urine.
C diff and CMV were repeatedly negative.
Patient was evaluated by GI who performed an EGD and flex sig which did not show findings consistent with his symptoms.
His creatinine was trending downward around [**6-13**], at which time he received another dye load.
His creatinine improved to 1.3 at the time of discharge.
INR was back to baseline at the time of discharge.
