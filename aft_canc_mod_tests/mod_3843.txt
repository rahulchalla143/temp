Superinfection w/ syphilis, viral exanthem, and ricketsial disease were also entertained.
* Floor team called [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team with concern for sespis, given persistent low grade temp, ongoing tachy/low bp as well as rising wbc to 19.7 w/ 21% bands and concern for sepsis.
Night float intern/resident called [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] again for evaluation - however, patient remained stable.
Also of note, echo was normal during this admission w/o vegetations; normal EF.
An EXTENSIVE workup was done during this admission.
In brief, the main findings in this patient were a CD4 count of 6 and a VL of [**Numeric Identifier 18318**].
He was also found to have an HBV VL of [**Numeric Identifier **] in his blood stream and thrush via an EGD.
Multiple other blood, urine and stool cultures were negative.
He had a bone marrow biopsy, skin biopsies and cecal biopsies which were all negative as well as an EGD (which showed the thrush).
The cecal biopsy and the multiple stool cultures were sent because of the patient's copious diarrhea during this admission.
By the time of his discharge, his diarrhea had decreased in quantity and frequency and his fevers decreased to low grade and he was afebrile [**Company 5249**] of 98.7 upon discharge.
Biopsy x 2 did not reveal any pathogens.
Bone marrow biopsy indicated that HIV myelopathy.
