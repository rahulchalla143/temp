He does not have pain in his leg although this leg has felt heavy for the past 2 months which prompted his initial CT scan which diagnosed his brain metastases.
He was referred to the emergency room directly from oncology clinic for evaluation of potential DVT.
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 94.1 P: 90 BP: 120/80 R: 18 O2 sat 100% on RA.
He had a CTA which was preliminarily negative for pulmonary embolism.
He had a non-contrast CT of the head which showed three hemorrhagic metastases (unclear how these compare in size post-radiation).
Given findings on CT head he was not started on anticogulation.
Strength 4/5 in the left lower extremity, [**6-4**] in the right lower extremity, sensation intact throughout, reflexes 2+ in the upper extremities, 1+ in left lower extremity, 2+ right lower extremity, decreased tone in left lower extremity.

HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST ([**2126-9-11**]) Multifocal high-attenuation foci with the perilesional vasogenic edema, in setting of known metastases suspicious for hemorrhagic intracranial metastases.
If further evaluation is desired, please consider gadolinium-enhanced MRI.
# LLE DVT and small PE: DVT found in LLE with small subsegmental PE, but patient also has hemorrhagic brain metastases shown on head CT preventing anticoagulation.
# Metastatic Melanoma: Hemorrhagic brain metastasis with surrounding vasogenic edema demonstrated on CT head.
On admission to ICU neurologic exam was notable for left lower extremity weakness and decreased reflexes.
Neuro exams were performed every 4 hours.
Given 1 L IVF, calcium monitored with decrease to 9.0 at time of discharge.
Platelets monitored with plt of 101 at discharge.
