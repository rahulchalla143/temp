In ED, found to have BP 80's/50's responded to IVF.
CTA was neg for PE, but showed a possible adrenal met and a lytic/sclerotic density in a compression fracture of T7 with probable posterior epidural extension of mass into spinal canal (seen on MRI [**3-22**]).
Got 2L IVF, 2.5 mg metop x3 with HR dropped to 115's.
CT guided biopsy showed non small cell lung CA.
She had a PET and an MRI and found to have a T7 likely metastatic lesion.
- EF 55% based on echo [**3-20**] - hypothyroidism   Social History: She is retired from working in [**Company 2486**].
Physical Exam: Vitals: Tm 98.5 Tc 98.5 BP 95-127/53-78 HR 99-123 R 25 Sat 99%RA I: 1027 O: 1850 Gen: well appearing female lying in bed in NAD HEENT: NC/AT, anicteric, OP clear, MMM NECK: supple, no LAD CV: tachy, s1 s2 distant heart sound, no murmur appreciated.
Pertinent Results: CXR [**4-25**]: There is a large lobulated mass in the right upper lobe measuring about 9 cm in greatest dimension and without change from the prior radiograph.
An MRI exam would provide better evaluation for cord compression.
EKG was most c/w sinus tachycardia.
Initially, titration of pts metoprolol was been limited by pts blood pressure.
Her EKG was faxed to cardiology who confirmed this was sinus tachycardia.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was performed given her recent dexamethasone course, but this was WNL.
TTE was negative for a pericardial effusion.
The pts metoprolol could not be increased back up to her prior dose of 100 [**Hospital1 **] given that her blood pressure remained low (SBP 90-100).
# Filling defect on right upper lobe pulmonary vein: CT chest shows a RUL pulm vein filling defect at the inferior margin of the large RUL mass which may represent venous tumor invasion or thrombus.
Her INR was therapeutic at the time of discharge.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.She was continued on ASA, BB, statin.
This can be restarted as an outpatient as her BP tolerates.
# COPD (FEV1 0.56, 25% predicted; FEV1/FVC 34 (46% predicted); Continued albuterol/atrovent/flovent   Medications on Admission: Metoprolol 100 mg po bid Imipramine 50 mg p.o.
