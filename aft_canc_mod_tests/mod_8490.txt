CT Abd/Pelvis [**2138-9-8**]: 1.
Recommend followup CT with intravenous contrast (with premedication) or MRI to assess patency of abdominal vasculature and better assess tumor burden.
Bone Scan [**2138-9-11**]: 1.
CXR [**2138-9-13**]: In comparison with study of [**8-19**], there is extensive patchy opacification involving much of the left lung, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of widespread pneumonia.
Left Hip X-Ray [**2138-9-18**]: Limited examination due to body habitus.
CXR [**2138-9-22**]: There has been interval partial clearing of the infiltrate in the left mid lung.

CT on admission confirmed interval increase in size and number of intraperitoneal metastases, as well as increase in paraaortic lymphadenopathy, consistent with disease progression.
CXR showed a left-sided infiltrate, and the patient was started on broad coverage for hospital-acquired PNA vs. aspiration pneumonia.
Her oxygen was weaned, and the patient was transferred back to the floor in stable condition.
At time of discharge, she was afebrile, without chest pain, SOB, or cough, and CXR showed improvement in left lobe consolidation.
# Colon cancer: CT abdomen showed increased size and number of intraperitoneal metastases, as well as increase in paraaortic lymphadenopathy masses throughout abdomen.
Her WBC had previously peaked at 48.4 in setting of her pneumonia, then trended down to as low as 11.3 on [**2138-9-17**].
There was no evidence of infection at her surgical site, no clinical evidence of pneumonia, blood cultures were negative, and the patient remained afebrile.
Her stool tested negative for C. diff x2.
She will be discharged on a pain regimen of acetaminophen 1000mg PO TID, gabapentin 400mg [**Hospital1 **], methadone 2.5mg PO TID, naproxen 375mg [**Hospital1 **] (to be continued through [**2138-10-1**]), with oxycodone 15-30mg Q3 prn breakthrough pain.
Her renal function should be closely monitored in setting of NSAID use.
Given her rising white count and antibiotic use, she was tested for C. diff infection, but testing was negative x2.
