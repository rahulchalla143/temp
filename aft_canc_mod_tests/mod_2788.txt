CLINICAL DATA:	 PREVIOUS SPECIMENS: [**2194-1-9**]	 	[**-1/4060**]	 	BRONCHIAL WASHINGS [**2194-1-9**]	 	[**-1/4060**]	 	BRONCHIAL BRUSHINGS [**2192-12-27**]	 	[**-1/4097**]	 	THIN LAYER PREP PAP SMEAR WITH IMAGING  DIAGNOSIS:	 EBUS-TBNA, Left upper lobe mass:  	  	 POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,  	  	 Consistent with adenocarcinoma.
MRI showed multiple brain metastases most prominantly in left occipital lobe with significant vasogenic edema and given this, she was started on high dose dexamethasone.
CXR showed a large left suprahilar lung mass indicating the likely primary site.
Her examination improved during the course of her admission.
CT-CAP showed left suprahilar mass with innumerable pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, bulky cervix (with uterine fibroids only seen on U/S) and a lytic lesion within the right supra-acetabular region indicating likely metastatic lung cancer.
Radiation oncology recommended whole brain irradiation and she had her first session on [**1-7**] and had further sessions on [**10-16**].
IP performed a lung biopsy of her large lung mass on [**1-8**] and post procedure CXR was stable.
On discharge, her examination had improved with only a mild right homonymous hemianopia present (predominantly in the inferior right field) in addition to slowed [**Location (un) 1131**] and writing errors.
Bronchial brushings and washing results have returned in keeping with lung adenocarcinoma and final pathology is still awaited.
She will have her last sessions of whole brain XRT on [**1-10**] and [**1-13**].

You had an MRI of your brain that showed several masses in your [**Last Name (un) **] with associated swelling and you were started on a medication called dexamethasone to reduce this swelling and keppra an anti-seizure medication to reduce the risk of having seizures.
You also had a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis which showed a left lung mass and enlarged glands in the lungs in addition to a likely tumor deposit in your right pelvis.
You underwent 3 courses of whole brain radiotherapy from [**Date range (1) 29694**] and had a biopsy of the lung mass on [**1-8**] and results are pending.
