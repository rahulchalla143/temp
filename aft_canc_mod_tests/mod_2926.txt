PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was afebrile, vital signs were stable.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2192-7-27**] where a subtotal gastrectomy and liver biopsy was performed.
The pain service was also consulted for epidural placement and epidural management, which again he did well with.
However he was able to be weaned from the ventilator and his blood pressure increased due to the significant volume administered through the operation and postoperatively.
