Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronch/med/ left thoracotomy bullectomy, talc pleuradesis [**2195-8-18**] trach/peg [**2195-8-31**]   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 68 year-old male with a history of severe COPD, emphysema and bullous disease, who was recently diagnosed with a left hilar mass, two biopsies of which were negative.
Two biopsies were done with TBNA and were negative.
The patient was admitted electively to undergo a bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy and, in case it was negative, he would undergo a thoracotomy with possible resection of his left hilar mass.
His preoperative PFT's were borderline and it was obvious that he would not tolerate a left pneumonectomy but he would do well with a left upper lobectomy.
