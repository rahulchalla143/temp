Bone marrow biopsies [**2102-4-3**] & [**2102-5-3**] 2.
VATS [**2102-5-5**] 4.
The patient underwent chemotherapy with the FLAG protocol, which included Fludarabine, Ara-C and GCSF.
A repeat bone marrow biopsy was performed on [**5-3**] that showed markedly hypocellular marrow with increased lymphocytes, plasma cells, and with background eosinophilic debris.
His ANC trended up to 350 by [**5-9**], and 750 by [**5-12**], which was unfortunately due to increasing blasts to 37, and relapsed AML.
He started cyclosporine infusion [**5-29**] for GVHD prophylaxis, and stem cell infusion began [**5-30**].
Concurrent with the start of chemotherapy, Mr. [**Known lastname 10304**] ANC decreased from a peak of 720 on [**5-28**] to zero on [**6-5**].
His GVHD was ultimately controlled on steroids and cyclosporin, which was gradually increased to maintain a serum level between 450-500.
Discharge cyclosporin dose was 324gms/day on 25mg Prednisone [**Hospital1 **] to prevent GVHD.
He was given blood transfusions in-house to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 25 as well as platelet transfusions to be greater than 10.
There were no schistocytes on a smear, and a HIT ab was negative.
Levaquin was added once his ANC was less than 500.
A CT of the sinuses on [**4-26**] did not demonstrate sinusitis, but did show 2 nodular opacities in the L lung apex.
A CT of the chest on [**4-26**] showed several ill-defined nodules in both upper lobes, mostly centrally located, with a single ill-defined nodule in the RML.
Additionally, he continued to spike and was found to have [**12-25**] blood culture bottles positive for diphtheroids on [**4-24**], sensitive to vancomycin.
A repeat CT scan on [**4-30**] showed worsening of the lung lesions, and ID recommended discontinuing flagyl and cefepime, and starting meropenem, in addition to a pulmonary consult.
A CT scan on [**5-3**] showed rapid progression of bilateral nodular masses which were then quite extensive in the upper lobes, L>R, as well as interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions, and thus voriconazole was added to the antibiotic regimen.
Galactomannin on [**4-27**] was negative.
The patient had a VATS on [**5-5**], the biopsy of which showed patchy acute and organizing pneumonitis with patchy accumulation of intraalveolar macrophages and fibrin, without evidence of malignancy, viral inclusions, or granuloma.
He continued to spike fevers up to 102, and had a repeat chest CT scan on [**5-10**] that showed continued increase in the size of the bilateral consolidations most prominent in the upper lobes, which was felt to be most consistent with continued progression of an infectious process such as aspergillus, [**Month/Year (2) 10305**], or PCP.
His sputum cultures were persistently negative.
PFTs on [**5-10**] demonstrated a mild restrictive ventilatory defect with reduced diffusing capacity suggestive of an interstitial process.
A repeat CXR showed worsening of the L pleural effusion with LLL consolidation and RLL consolidation.
A repeat CT scan on [**5-21**] showed interval decrease in size of the bilateral consolidations most prominently seen in the upper lobes, with interval increase in size of left sided pleural effusion, with interval resolution of the small right sided pleural effusion.
He had a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis on [**5-23**] that did not show any organisms.
His fever curve trended down on [**5-10**], and he was afebrile through his reinfusion on [**5-30**].
A CT of the sinuses was repeated, which demonstrated new opacification of the posterior left sphenoid sinus, which appeared consistent with mucosal thickening.
A CT of the chest/abd/pelvis at the same time showed persistent multifocal pulmonary opacities, most extensive in the upper lobes, slight decrease in the size of left pleural effusion, with persistent loculation in the upper left hemithorax, hepatosplenomegaly, and no evidence of colitis or enteritis.
A nasal swab at this time was negative for parainfluenza, adenovirus, RSV.
A sputum gram stain on [**6-6**] demonstrated gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters, however he was already on vancomycin.
IV Bactrim was started on [**6-13**] for stenotrophomonas coverage after he spiked a temp of 102.4 and became hypotensive requiring further pressors, however it was discontinued when his blood cultures came back negative and his platelets dropped.
Cerbralspinal fluid culture was without growth.
On [**7-24**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a temperature of 100.5 axillary.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn but were negative, and a CT of the thorax was performed to evaluate the status of the pulmonary nodules.
The CT thorax showed possible new lung nodules, however it was not clear as the study was difficult to compare to the previous CT scan.
CMV viral load was negative on [**7-31**].
CARDIOVASCULAR:  On [**4-27**] the patient complained of some chest pain and continued to spike a fever, therefore an echo was performed on [**4-28**] to assess for pericarditis, which was normal, without evidence of effusion or vegetations.
EF 60%.
CK was within normal limits.
Additionally, he had to be intubated on [**6-10**] secondary to seizures with respiratory rate into the 40s and labored breathing.
An EKG while in the ICU demonstrated decreased amplitude, however an echocardiogram on [**6-9**] did not demonstrate an effusion.
His metoprolol was held, pacer pads were left on his chest, and atropine was kept at his bedside.
Head CT ruled out brain stem lesion.
Echo on [**7-6**] showed moderate pericardial effusion, increased in size, but no evidence of tamponade physiology.
An EKG at the time showed NSR, and he was given 5 mg IV Lopressor x 1 which brought his heart rate down to 110.
An EKG at the time showed atrial flutter.
He was given IV Lopressor x 2 and his rate came down to 110 with the second dose.
A repeat echo will be performed should the patient go back into a-flutter, to investigate the status of his pericardial effusion.
He has been in NSR since, with a rate between 100-110.
His clonidine patch was tapered to 0.2 mg on [**7-22**], however his pressures were slightly higher to the 160s and 170s, therefore metoprolol was increased from 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**7-24**].
A CT scan done on [**7-25**] to evaluate Mr. [**Known lastname 10304**] pulmonary nodules demonstrated an increased size of his effusion.
An echo was done on [**7-26**] that showed a large pericardial effusion with right ventricular invagination, right atrial collapse, and impending tamponade, therefore on [**7-27**] the patient had a pericardiocentesis that removed 500 cc of serosanguinous fluid.
The fluid was sent for culture and cytology - no evidence of infection or malignant cells were found.
A suveillance echos, the latest on [**8-10**], showed a stable small to moderate pericardial effusion.
[**Last Name (un) **] Occlusive Disease: On [**5-6**] the patient was noted to have a rising total bilirubin to 2.6 with abdominal distention and a palpable liver edge.
Additionally, his INR rose to 2.0.
A RUQ US on [**5-9**] showed hepatosplenomegaly, as well as a large amount of sludge within the nondistended and otherwise unremarkable gallbladder.
On [**5-14**], his total bilirubin decreased to 0.8 and his coags normalized.
His INR climbed to 2.4 that night, with elevated PT and PTT, and total bili of 5.3.
His platelets were 11 (up from 6 the day before) and he had an episode of epistaxis.
His fibrinogen was 491, however his D-dimer was 1513, and there was concern for DIC.
His total bilirubin, however, rapidly climbed, his edema increased, and his urine output decreased.
On [**6-9**] he had to be transfered to the ICU secondary to hemodynamic instability with blood pressures falling to 90/30, and heart rates into the 140s.
His bilirubin was 17 on transfer, climbing to a peak of 23 by [**6-10**].
Normal flow [**7-14**] U/S and CT.  On [**7-29**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have an acute elevation of his LFTs - AST 65, ALT 107, ALP 469, LDH 234.
An US of his RUQ showed a new small to moderate amount of ascites surrounding the liver, with patent hepatic vasculature.
DIARRHEA:  The patient had loose bowel movements from [**Date range (1) 10308**] that were negative for C. Diff.
CMV viral load titers were negative.
RENAL: At the same time that his bilirubin trended up, day 7 s/p MUD transplant, his creatinine was also noted to be rapidly increasing.
His creatinine reached a max of 3.3 on [**6-10**] and he received a very brief CVVH through his Hickmann catheter.
Thereafter it slowly began trending down and his urine output was good, suggestive of non-oliguric ATN.
His solumedrol was increased to 70 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**6-13**].
A CT of the head on [**6-10**] was without incracranial pathology, however it was a poor study.
An MRI on [**6-11**] also demonstrated no acute intracranial pathology.
An EEG at this time showed frequent bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing with a low voltage theta frequency background, consistent with a moderate encephalopathy.
He was noted to be talkative and interactive s/p extubation, and his altered mental status was thus attributed to his hepatic and renal impairment which was resolving at the time of his improvement.
An MRI on [**7-11**] negative for mass lesion.
A repeat CT of the head was performed on [**7-22**] which showed hypodensity of the white matter in both parietal and occipital lobes, right worse than left.
An MRI of the head was performed on [**7-23**] to further evaluate these findings, however the patient was uncooperative and it was therefore a poor study - it did again demonstrate hypointensity in the occipital and parietal lobes bilaterally.
Cyclosporine was discontinued on [**7-23**] because of cyclosporin toxicity as suggested by an MRI on [**7-23**] showing questionable edema in the occipital and parietal lobes bilaterally.
A repeat MRI on [**7-26**], which was not limited by pt uncooperation like the first study, showed no abnormal signal in the white matter to suggest cyclosporin toxicity.
Cyclosporin was soon restarted and pt was d/c'd on 324mg/day continuous infusion.
DIET, FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient was maintained on a neutropenic diet initially.
His magnesium (3 amps) and phosphate (15mmol) were repleted intravenously daily.
VERTIGO:  The patient experienced a one time episode of vertigo while getting blood and while getting high dose ARA-C. Otoscopic examination was unremarkable.
He had an MRI with gadolinium which was negative for any abnormalities except for mastoid and sphenoid fluid.
They recommended an orbital MRI to rule out leukemic infiltrate.
The patient had a fine cut MRI of the orbits which was negative for a leukemic infiltrate or mass effect.
