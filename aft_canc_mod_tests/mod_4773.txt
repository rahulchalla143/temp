At the outside hospital he underwent a cardiac cath on [**2157-4-5**] which revealed 3 vessel disease.
He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further intervention and underwent stenting of the distal SVG-RPDA.
He had an EGD and barium swallow that showed dilated esophagus with erosion but no Zenker's or strictures.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8579**] recommended performing a Persantine thallium test which showed moderate size lateral wall ischemia extending to portions of the anterior and inferior walls; with preserved LVEF.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.

Pulmonary fibrosis/asbestosis - thought to be from work related chemical exposure although TB was entertained and dismissed at one point 4.

Follow-up imaging in three months is recommended to ensure stability (at which time, the questionable findings #1, above, could be re-assessed).
There are no findings that specifically suggest underlying communicating hydrocephalus, and "normal pressure hydrocephalus" is a clinical, not an imaging diagnosis.
Multifocal T2- and FLAIR-hyperintensity within the white matter are a nonspecific finding, but may represent sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemia, given the patient's age and possible evidence of additional punctate acute infarcts.
[**4-30**] EEG This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and disorganization of the background rhythm consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
Medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infection are common causes.
A CT thorax is recommended for further evaluation.
He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for repeat cardiac cath.
Brief highlights of this extended hospital stay are as follows -  He was initially admitted to the cardiology service where further history indicated a subacute progression of his exertional SOB; which ischemic MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1902**] were considered ultimately focus shifted to failure to thrive workup and evaluation of weakness and swallowing difficulties.
Patient subsequently underwent EGD which was notable for gastric ulcers.
Bronchoscopy was also done at that time.
He was seen by the neurology service for evaluation of a possible neurologic cause of his decline - no definitive diagnosis was established during this hospitalization.
MRI of the brain showed evidence of chronic microvascular disease.
EEG showed diffuse slowing.
CSF analysis was limited by small volume of fluid that could be obtained.
