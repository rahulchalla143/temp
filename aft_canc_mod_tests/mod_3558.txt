A CT at that time revealed a mass in the pancreas w/extension to the Left adrenal and kidney with biopsy revealing mucinous adenocarcinoma.
Her next scheduled cycle was to begin Wednesday, [**2118-10-5**], but may be postponed given current symptoms.
The patient's elevated INR was reversed w/ 1 U FFP for possible LP.
However, the patient's MS improved w/3L NS with improvement in her blood pressure and an LP was not performed.

Radiology: [**2118-9-29**]: Chest Pa/Lat: CHEST AP:  Surgical clips are visualized over the right lateral upper chest.
A left-sided Port-A-Cath is visualized with its tip in the proximal SVC.
Flow study through the port was suggestive of either a fibrin sheath, or less likely, a small catheter leak.
[**2118-10-4**]: CT Abdomen + Pelvis: The lung bases are clear.
This could represent postoperative thickening but correlation with any prior imaging is advised to exclude the possibility of local recurrence.
Multiple sub cm ovoid hypoattenuating areas mainly in the left lobe ,these may represent small cysts but are too small to characterise on CT and should be correlated with prior imaging or interval follow up as small hypovascular metastases cannot be excluded.
CONCLUSION: 1)Fluid filled non-thickened non-distended [**Month/Day/Year 499**] .This may be related to current episode of enteritis depending on current clinical correlation.

Hypotension/Diarrhea - On presentation, the patient's presentation was assessed to meet criteria for SIRS with a septic like picture on presentation.
The patient was febrile, hypotensive with altered mental status in the setting of an ANC of 590.
However, after hydration the patient's mental status was noted to significantly improve and an LP was not attempted at this time.
The patient had a lactate of 1.8 with good response in blood pressure with hydration.
In the 24 hours after admission, the patient was assessed to have a GI output of about 2800cc.
However, given that the patient had an ANC < 1000 at that time, the decision was made that invasive catheters should likely be removed.
The patient continues to have a significant non-gap acidosis secondary to diarrhea with serum bicarbonate levels of 11 to 14 over the last three days prior to discharge.
The patient has had multiple stool and blood cultures sent during this admission (see pertinent results) which have demonstrated mild to moderate Leukocytes in the stool but cultures, O+P and C. Diff have been negative multiple times.
As the patient reported some mild LLQ tenderness a CT of the abdomen was obtained to detect any occult abscess or other infectious process.
CT results demonstrated soft tissue density a the site of the patient's known prior pancreatic mass but revealed no abnormal large or small bowel loop dilatation.
CT demonstrated many of the small bowel loops to be mildly prominent, measuring up to 3 cm in diameter and revealed the [**Month/Day/Year 499**] to be fluid filled throughout, thought to be related to the patient's ongoing enteritis.
DVT - The patient on admission was being treated with 2.5mg po qhs of coumadin qhs for known DVT diagnosed in 08-[**2117**].
The patient's INR on presentation was 3.4 which was partially reversed with 1U FFP in anticipation of possible LP.
The patient's INR was 6.0 on [**2118-10-2**] for which she received 2.5mg PO Vitamin K with good effect, and reduction of her INR to 4.2 the next day.
Her INR was again elevated to 6.3 the day prior to discharge.
As the patient's INR was greater than 5, but without any evidence of any ongoing bleeding, the patient's coumadin continues to be held and an addiitional 2.5mg PO Vitamin K was administered.
A fibrinogen level checked previously was 543 on [**2118-10-3**] and repeat fibrinogen am of discharge, [**2118-10-6**] was 418, not consistent with DIC.
The patient should continue to have her INR carefully monitored at the receiving hospital with consideration towards additional Vitamin K SC/IV for reversal of INR > 5.0 or FFP with any signs of bleeding.
A flow study was performed which demonstrated fluid flow proximal to the catheter tip suggestive likely of a fibrin sheath vs. a possible catheter leak.
The port was used once on the floor prior to the results of the flow study being revealed and the patient reported some burning at the port entry site with the infusion of some fluids with potassium.
