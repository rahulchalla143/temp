He went to an OSH where he was found to have a platelet count of 7, lactate of 11.3, and WBC of 11.5 with 9% bands.
His head CT revealed right SAH.
CT torso revealed a splenic infarct as well as infarct of the mesenteric vessels.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Repeat CT head showed parietal and temporal SAH, stable since OSH imaging.
CT torso showed splenomegaly and wedge shaped infarcts in the the spleen and kidneys.
Given platelets of 7, INR 1.9 and petachaie on exam, patients as presumed to be in DIC.
Max temperature during ED course was temp of 104.
Neurosurgery evaluted the patient and advised transfusing platelets to 50, transfusing FFP to INR 1.4, Q1H neuro checks, and repeat head CT in the AM.
Family History: mother breast ca   Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.5 BP: 98/61 P: 93 R: 18 O2: 97% AC 530 x 12 PEEP 5 FIO2 50% CVP 12 General: Intubated, appears comfortable HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, pupils reactive 3->2 bilaterally Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly SKIN: bilateral LE petechaiea Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, but 1+ bilateral pedal edema   Pertinent Results: CT HEAD FINDINGS: Again seen is subarachnoid hemorrhage along the right hemisphere.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Evaluation is limited due to the respiratory motion throughout the entire exam.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The spleen is massively enlarged.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is noted within a decompressed bladder.
Further evaluation for a right to left cardiac shunt with echocardiography is recommended.
ABDOMINAL U/S: 1.
TTE ([**2-24**]) Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-2-15**], the degree of TR and pulmonary hypertension detected have increased.
CXR [**2153-2-26**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.
Blood cultures were sent and he was emperically started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Cultures grew out MSSA.
Trans-thoracic echo confirmed aortic and tricuspid valve vegetations.
The CT surgery team was consulted but no surgical management was undertaken.
The patient develpoed renal failure (see below) Repeat TTE one week after the initial ultrasound demonstrated new severe tricuspid regurgitation.
EKG was checked daily to monitor for PR prolongation, which remained stable.
Repeat cultures following treatment for MSSA bacteremia were negative.
Over the course of this admission, INR and bilirubin continued to trend up, until MELD was > 30 near the time of his demise.
DIC labs were monitored twice daily.
#SBP: He underwent a paracetntesis with cell count consistent with SBP.
Neuro exam was nonfocal, and CT was unchanged between here and OSH where SAH was originally noted.
Repeat imaging on [**2-16**] showing continued interval slight decrease in density of SAH since earlier in the day.
