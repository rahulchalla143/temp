Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2150-12-11**]: Neurosurgery of the spine with T5, T6 and T7 bilateral laminectomy, Anterior decompression with removal of disk material and soft tissue, Posterior instrumented fusion T4, T5, T6, T7 and T8 using pedicle screws, rods and cross-link (EBI spine array), with Autologous graft and Allograft.
CT scan was performed at 7:30PM on [**2150-12-9**] demonstrating severe compression of the T6 vertebral body, resulting in a kyphotic angulation of the spine, with significant retropulsion of bone fragments into the spinal canal at this level, which reduces the diameter of the spinal canal by approximately 50%.
His prior workup is notable for history of persistent tachycardia with heart rates in the 150s, with two prior CTAs (one on [**2150-11-24**] and one on [**2150-12-4**]) both of which were negative for PE.
Patient was directly admitted to the floor, but triggered upon arrival due to HR in the 150s, which initially was sinus tachycardia, but which quickly escalated to 210s with stable blood pressures and oxygen saturations, with telemetry findings consistent with SVT.
CV: Tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: A+O X 3.
Pertinent Results: OSH CT abdomen/pelvis [**2150-12-6**]: Findings raise concern for a mid small bowel early or partial obstruction, exact site uncertain.
OSH CT head [**2150-12-7**]: There is a 1cm enhancing mass at the grey-white matter junction of the posterior left frontal lobe, with some associated edema but no significant mass effect.
OSH CT thoracic spine [**2150-12-9**]: severe compression of the T6 vertebral body, resulting in a kyphotic angulation of the spine at this level.
OSH CT lumbar spine [**2150-12-9**]: Moderate compression of L2, L4, L5, appearance of osteoporotic compression fractures.
Retropulsion of the posterior aspect of the vertebral body into the spinal canal resulting in severe spinal canal stenosis and moderate degree of compression on the spinal cord at this level.
Pathologic compression fracture cannot be completely excluded.
Please see other details in the CT chest report.
[**2150-12-11**] C Spine MRI IMPRESSION: No evidence of cervical metastases on this examination on this limited, incompete examination.
He briefly received steroids for a random am cortisol of 13 but this was stopped by time of discharge from MICU without significant consequence.
Formal testing revealed significant cognitive deficits that call into question the patient's ability to make complex medical decisions.
# Dysphagia and aspiration risk: On [**2150-12-24**] formal speech and swallowing study showed the patient to be at risk to aspirate all food consistencies, but particularly thin liquids.
Sputum culture was negative.
# Cardiac rhythm: While on the floor, pt noted to have narrow complex SVT's to the 200's which were intermittently treated with beta blockade.
# UTI: The patient had a urine culture positive for pansensitive klebsiella during his prior admission at the OSH.
Repeat urine cultures were negative and the patient completed a full course of levofloxicin.
Disp:*40 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 6. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1)  PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 9. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO twice a day: hold for systolic blood pressure below 100 or diastolic blood pressure below 60.
You had surgery for your cord compression and steroids that improved your pain, but these only minimally improved the strength in your legs.
Followup Instructions: F/U with Neurosurgery, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], on [**2150-1-26**]: CT scan of thoracic spine at 8:30 am, [**Hospital Ward Name **] clinical building, [**Location (un) 9158**].
