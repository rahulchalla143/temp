Neurology was consulted and felt that initial exam was consistent with global encephalopathy secondary to being chronically sedated on fentanyl, versed and propofol in a person with a large body habitus.
A CT brain was performed on admission that was unrevealing and on [**2168-5-18**] a CTA head was performed which was also unremarkable.
72 hrs of continuous EEG monitoring was done and did not show any epileptiform activity but did show moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction of non-specific etiology.
An MRI was performed that revealed no acute/subacute intracranial process, potential evidence small vessel disease.
# [**Name (NI) 16630**] -  Pt was spiking fevers earlier in hospital course, now has normal BP.
Sputum growing MDR Klebsiella sensitive to [**Last Name (un) 2830**] and cefepime.
Blood culture from [**5-19**] revealed no growth.
On admission his CRP and ESR were markedly elevated, and we were concerned for possible flare of PMR.
#Atrial fibrillation - On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], pt was not being actively anticoagulated for his known afib.
- A repeat EEG should be performed for the patient's altered mental status.
