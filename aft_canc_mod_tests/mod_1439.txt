>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..          Trimethoprim/Sulfa sensitivity testing confirmed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3077**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3060**].
On post-op day 2, the patient became hypotensive with MAP 55-60, had an increased oxygen requirement, and was tachycardic with heart rate 120-150s.
The patient was intubated without incident for his increased oxygen requirement and received blood transfusions for a Hct of 21.8.
A chest x-ray obtained at that time showed bilateral pleural effusions.
An esophagoscopy showed pink and well perfused mucosa ruling out graft ischemia/necrosis as the cause for the patient's tachycardia and increased oxygen requirement.
On post-op day 4, a CT scan was obtained which showed a moderate to large sized right pleural effusion.
A neck CT scan showed an abscess at the superficial margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
Serial chest x-rays showed stable basilar atelectasis and consolidations with no evidence of increasing pleural effusion.
There was concern for aspiration and a video swallow exam was obtained which indeed did show moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids when he swallowed with his head upright.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Check residuals q4hr.
You must sit upright at 90 degrees and tuck your chin when swallowing.
