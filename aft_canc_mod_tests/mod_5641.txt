The patient had stable repeat head CT's on [**2-26**] and [**2-27**], but developed episodes of somnolence and verbal unresponsiveness followed by behavioral outbursts with violence.
An EEG showed evidence of non-convulsive seizures, and she was loaded with Levetiracetam 1 gm and continued on 500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
The last noted seizure on EEG was [**2-28**], and subsequent EEG on [**3-2**] showed evidence of encephalopathy and discharges but no further seizures.
LENI's on [**3-2**] were negative, and Neurology suggested considering an MRI head to r/o stroke, but the Neurosurgical team felt that the patient's waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] delirium was not consistent with a stroke and an MRI was not ordered.
Most recent Head CT on [**3-6**] was stable.
An infectious workup was initiated with CXR, UA, and blood cultures.
The UA on [**3-5**] returned positive, and the foley was discontinued and a repeat UA/UCx were sent.
CXR was negative, blood cultures are negative to date.
Urine culture from [**3-6**] returned positive for >100,000 Enterococcus, but did not receive antibiotics.
While on the neurosurgical service, there was a concern for aspiration and an NGT was placed on [**3-3**].
On [**3-6**], the patient's NGT was pulled and diet was advanced after the patient had a speech and swallow evaluation that recommended pureed solids and thin liquid.
Tube feeds were re-started pending a repeat speech and swallow evaluation.

[**2161-2-26**] CT head postop: Status post right frontotemporal craniotomy with evacuation of subdural hematoma.
[**2161-3-2**] Chest Xray: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.
Renal Ultrasound [**3-9**]: The kidneys are normal in size with the right kidney measuring 11.3 cm and the left kidney measuring 10.8 cm.
There are scattered bilateral simple renal cysts, measuring up to 2.0 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm on the right and 4.7 x 3.9 x 5.0 cm on the left, increased in size compared to prior CT from [**2155-5-8**].
CT Head [**3-9**]:  Stable appearance of left subdural hematoma and mild effacement of left frontal sulci.
Also with fever and white count secondary to enterococcus UTI.
Head CT in the ED showed a left subdural hemorrhage.
The OR course was uncomplicated, and a subgaleal JP drain was placed, which was later discontinued.
Post-op CT head showed a small, stable residual temporal subdural hematoma.
She was transfused 2 units PRBC for a post-op hematocrit of 21 in the setting of her cardiac history.
On POD3 ([**2-28**]), EEG showed frequent seziure activity in the left spreading to the right, and Dilantin was increased, Keppra load was given, and Keppra and Ativan were started.
Repeat head CT remained stable.
On [**3-4**], the Epilepsy team reviewed her EEGs which were negative for seizure activity.
She was continued on Keppra and Dilantin, and has been having daily Dilantin levels which were corrected for her low albumin.
Since transfer to the medical service on [**3-7**], the patient has remained stable per Neurosurgery evaluation and repeat CT head on [**3-9**] in the setting of full anti-coagulation (on Heparin gtt for afib/flutter).
The patient will have follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in Neurosurgery in 2 weeks with noncontrast head CT at that time.
Of note, the patient's Dilantin levels were low, and her Dilantin level was increased on [**3-11**].
On [**3-5**] she spiked a fever to 102 F. Chest X-Ray [**3-6**] and [**3-7**] were negative.
Blood cultures from [**3-5**] and [**3-7**] are pending.
Urine analysis was positive on [**3-6**] with few bacteria, 62 WBC, <1 epi.
Repeat urine analysis on [**3-6**] had a negative dipstick but as not sent for microscopic exam.
However, the culture from the urine sample on [**3-6**] returned positive for >100,000 Enterococcus, sensitive to Ampicillin, which she has been on since the evening of [**3-7**].
Her fevers are most likely due to her enterococcus UTI, and her fever curve and white count have been down-trending on Ampicillin.
However, given she was still having low grade fevers of 100.6 this morning with a white count of 12, a renal ultrasound was obtained to rule out perinephric abscess or renal calculi causing hydronephrosis, which was negative.
Her blood cultures have thus far returned negative, but she does have two blood cultures from [**3-7**] and [**3-8**] that remain pending on discharge.
# Thrombocytosis:  The patient has had a progressively increasing platelet count, and has thrombocytosis today, [**3-12**], with platelets of 692.
She will be discharged on a Lovenox bridge until her INR becomes therapeutic, with goal INR of 2.5-3.0.
She subsequently passed her speech and swallow evaluation while on the Neurosurgical service, but when she was started on a PO diet, nursing had concerns regarding aspiration given coughing episodes with drinking water.
Speech and swallow was reconsulted and the patient underwent a repeat video swallow study after transfer to the medical service.
The patient had also pulled out her NGT, but failed her repeat video swallow study, which showed slight penetration with no aspiration but significant abnormalities with swallow putting her at risk for aspiration.
She was cleared for a diet of nectar thickened liquids and pureed solids, with plan for re-evaluation in the future when she is further out from her craniotomy.
