Sensation: Intact to light touch  Toes: Upgoing left  Handedness  Right  Upon discharge: Awake, alert, oriented, slight left pronator, LUE weakness -[**4-16**] otherwise full  Pertinent Results: CT Head [**3-28**] There is an area of mixed density with surrounding vasogenic edema extending from the right frontal cortex into the right basal ganglia and right insula, with 11 mm leftward shift of normally midline structures and possible uncal herniation and narrowing of the right perimesencephalic cisterns.
MRI of the brain may be useful in further characterizing the lesion.
MRI Brain [**3-28**] 1.
CT Torso [**3-28**] 1.
CT head [**3-28**] IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of a large right frontal mixed attenuating mass.
No new mass effect is seen since the 2:10 a.m. examination  MRI brain with and without contrast [**3-29**]: Right frontal lobe mass again identified for surgical planning with surface markers.
CT head [**3-29**] postop: Status post right frontal mass resection and post-right craniotomy changes with expected subcutaneous pneumocephalus with minimal fluid and blood products in the surgical bed; right hemispheric sulcal effacement and 8 mm of right to left midline shift.
MRI [**3-30**] postop: Since the prior study, the patient has undergone resection of previously seen enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe.
CT head [**4-1**] postop: IMPRESSION: Status post right frontal craniotomy with expected subcutaneous gas and pneumocephalus; resection cavity consists of fluid, gas locules and blood products, but no acute extra-axial hemorrhage is identified.
MRI [**4-2**] postop: 1.
Post-surgical changes in the right frontal region and in the right frontal lobe with blood products and fluid levels along with areas of enhancement in the periphery and on the medial aspect.
Surrounding vasogenic edema has significantly increased compared to the prior study with increase in the leftward shift of midline structures.
Frozen pathology came back as malignant Glioma.
Her postoperative Head CT demonstrated expected changes without hemorrhage.
MRI demonstrated moderate residual tumor and she was transferred to the regular floor in good condition.
Postoperatively she was extubated and transfered to the ICU for frequent neuro checks and systolic BP control less than 140.
Postop Head CT was negative for hemorrhage.
Post op MRI was performed and revealed post operative changes.
?You will not need an MRI of the brain with/ or without gadolinium contrast.
