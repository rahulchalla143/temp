The etiology was initially thought to be secondary to diverticulosis, however, a repeat colonoscopy revealed a bleeding ulcer at the polypectomy site which was clipped (The patient had a polypectomy x 2 on [**2168-5-13**]).
She will need a follow-up colonoscopy within 3 months with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**] to remove the ascending colon polyp.
During this hospitalization, she had an abdominal CT for follow up of a prominent submucosal lymphoid aggregate with mucosal infiltration found on biopsy of on of the polyps on [**2168-5-13**] for further characterization of possible lymphatic tumor.
The initial CT results showed normal bowels with no thickening or abdominal lymphadenopathy.
The patient did not require further transfusion and her last bowel movement was yellow/brown (no melena).
You had a CT of your abdomen because one of the resected polyps had increased Lymphoctes.
The final results of the CT are pending at the time of your discharge but the bowels looked fine.
Please follow up with your PCP and your GI specialist early next week regarding the results of the CT. You will need a follow-up colonoscopy within 3 months with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**] to remove the ascending colon polyp seen on this last colonoscopy.
