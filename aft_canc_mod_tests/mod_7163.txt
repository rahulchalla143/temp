A CT of the spine and a MRI were performed at OSH, which showed a pathologic fracture at T8 and a large tumor that has almost completley destroyed T8 vertebra with cord impingement.
Heme/Onc was also consulted for evaluation of tumor  Neurosurgeons at OSH feel the fracture is unstable and will need spinal surgery to stabilize, but are not comfortable preforming biopsy/stabilization procedure.
Neuro exam is currently nonfocal; motor and sensation (including normal rectal tone) are intact.
VS prior to transfer from OSH were T: 97.5 BP: 144/64 HR: 69 RR: 16 O2 Sat: 97% RA.
LFTs noted to be elevated on admission and per CT a/p note of cirrhosis.
Neuro: CN 2-12 intact, strength 5/5 in UE and LE bilat, reflex 1+ bilat patella, sensation to light touch intact, FN intact.

Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Pathology (spinal mass Bx - [**9-12**]): Results Still Pending **> Will Need Outpt Follow-Up<**  Brief Hospital Course: ID: This is a 81 yo male with a history of prostate cancer, CHF, COPD, DM, new diagnosis of cirrhosis, who presented to OSH with back pain and found to have tumor causing fracture in spine transferred her for NSURG evaluation.
Multiple lytic spinal metasrases from initially unknown primary: Transferred from OSH with multiple lytic lesions causing significant back discomfort, T8 and T12 compression fractures, and on CT scan, concerning for spinal metastases.
Primary tumor unknown and limited evaluation at OSH showed a low PSA and negative SPEP.
Patient was initially monitored with neurologic exam q 8hrs and maintained on decadron 6mg IV q 6hrs to reduce edema.
Final pathology was pending at the time of discharge and will be followed up as an outpatient.
Infectious evaluation with CXR, [**Hospital1 **] cultures, U/A and culture were negative; neurologic exam was nonfocal with OSH CT head showing no signs of metastases.
Diastolic CHF: Upon admission, patient appeared euvolemic with ECHO showing hyperdynamic LV with an EF of 75%.
CT scan of abdomen consistent with cirrhosis.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital for Continuing Medical Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: 1)Spinal/paraspinal masses - tissue diagnosis pending 2)Delirium  Secondary Diagnosis: 1)Transaminitis with liver cirrhosis 2)Balantitis 3)Urinary retention   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 **] for neuro-surgical evaluation of your spine.
There was concern that your spine bones would become unstable because of these masses and a surgery was performed to stabilize your spine and to obtain a biopsy of the tissue to allow diagnosis of the mass.
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 26774**], and schedule a follow-up appointment to be seen within 1-2 weeks of being discharged from the rehabilitation facility.
