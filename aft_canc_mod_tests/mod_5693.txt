PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Heart rate 100, blood pressure 90/56, respiratory rate 18.
Breath sounds were equal bilaterally.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 15.6, 82 neutrophils, 1 band, 8 lymphocytes, hematocrit 28.2, platelets 913.

Chem-7 revealed sodium of 137, potassium 4.1, chloride 101, bicarbonate 22, BUN 11, creatinine 0.5, glucose 86.

The patient remained afebrile until postoperative day 15, at which time she spiked a temperature to 102.6.
In addition, blood cultures, urine cultures, and chest x-ray were sent, and the patient was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and Flagyl.
Her temperature maximum at this time was 104.6.
Blood cultures at the time the patient spiked grew out coag-negative Staphylococcus resistant to oxacillin.
In addition, a urine cultures grew out greater than 100,000 colonies of enterococcus and greater than 100,000 colonies of coag-negative Staphylococcus.
The ceftriaxone and Flagyl were discontinued after two days given that the patient defervesced nicely, and there was a known source from the blood and the urine coag-negative Staphylococcus which the vancomycin would cover.
Subsequent blood cultures and urine cultures were negative.
At that time, imaging revealed a left arm with central venous occlusion and venous outflow through numerous collaterals, and in the right arm central venous occlusion at the right axillary vein.
The patient's superior vena cava symptoms did resolve during the hospital course.
A head CT was obtained which was negative for a bleed.
A head MRI was also obtained which was negative for stroke.
Toxic metabolic workup including complete blood count, urinalysis, liver function tests, and chest x-ray were all unremarkable.
The chest x-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions; however, no evidence of infection.
An electroencephalogram was obtained which showed diffuse swelling with right temporal spikes consistent with a epileptogenic focus but no seizure activity.
There were issues of low urine output immediately postoperatively, and the patient did require albumin; however, her urine output improved and was adequate throughout the rest of the hospital course.
