He was admitted for evaluation of low grade fever.
Restaging PET scans revealed progressive disease both above and below diaphram.

CT TORSO W/O CONTRAST  [**2168-5-31**] 2:27 PM CT CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes have slightly increased in size and number.
Lung windows continue to demonstrate biapical scarring.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Numerous hypodense splenic lesions have increased in size and number.
The pancreas, abdominal loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The 7-mm calculus at the right ureterovesical junction is unchanged in size and appearance.
Of these, B cells are extremely scant in number precluding evaluation of clonality.
INTERPRETATION Cell marker analysis demonstrates an extremely scant population of B-cells.
CT CAP: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT AP [**2168-7-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Ultrasound examination is recommended to confirm the presence of multiple subcentimeter hypodense lesions as this is a new finding.

WBC recovered well, but with persistent low platelets concerning for slow engraftment v. autoimmune phenomena posttransplant v. disease-related issues, or GVHD (though there were no other signs of GVHD to support this).
Given CT findings of increased size and number of [**Doctor First Name **], increased LDH, and BM read, concern for recurrence of disease v. hemophagocytic syndrome.
CT torso ([**6-7**]) to eval for further progression and for abdominal pain etiology noted unchanged to slightly larger LNs and liver lesions.
MRI negative for leptomeningeal disease, LP results positive for HHV-6, otherwise, non-diagnostic study given paucity of cells.
CT of CAP showing progression in liver and splenic disease as well as increase in size of lymphanopathy.
Imaging, cultures and screens for c. diff were unrevealing and he had been transitioned to fluconazole, acyclovir and bactrim for prophylaxis.
