Her VS in the ED were: 99.6 (Tm:101),124/91, 20, 96% 4L Nasal Cannula.
She had a head CT that did not show evidence of acute CVA.
Unfortunately due to IV access issues (it could not be determined whether she had a power port), she could not obtain a CT chest with contrast to evaluate for PE.
A chest CXR showed worsening pul edema, but given extensive lung mets, a consolidative process could not be ruled out.
[**2156-7-14**]: CT torso (done because of elevated alk phos) showed 1.5 and 0.6 cm left upper lobe nodules.
[**2156-8-26**]: Left upper lobectomy showed two foci of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
[**2157-5-4**]: MRI of T/L spine with disease at T10, T11 vertebral bodies, soft tissues T10-T12, and L3 body.
CT-guided biopsy consistent with renal cell carcinoma.
[**2158-2-7**]: MRI L-spine with T11 disease with persistent mass effect on thecal sac but no significant cord compression, and T9 and T10 disease, all likely unchanged.
[**2158-2-13**]: CT torso with interval marked progression of innumerable pulmonary mets since [**2157-8-2**].
CT torso showed osseous mets in spine and left ibs, with interva lincrease in size in soft tissue component at T11 encasing thecal sac, invading cord, and invading more than 50% of the spinal canal.
[**2158-4-19**]: C1D1 08-184 (avastin/temsirolimus) [**2158-6-7**]: CT torso with significant decrease in size of bilateral pulmonary lesions and stable osseous disease with decrease in soft tissue mass at T11 - [**Date range (3) 10263**]: admitted for PNA, mental status changes, found to have frontal CVA, taken off study - [**2158-8-9**] CT TORSO: stable disease Other Past Med Hx: - Hypertension - Breast Cancer s/p resection - gout  Social History: She lives with her 3 sons who assist with her medical care.

[**2158-10-22**] CT Head w/o contrast: No acute intracranial process or evidence.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Fluid collection is identified in the upper lumbar posterior soft tissues at L1 level measuring 3 x 2.5 cm which likely is postoperative in nature, but MRI appearances alone cannot help in excluding infection in this postoperative collection and clinical correlation is recommended.
[**2158-10-26**]: CT T/L spine: 1.
In order to visualize if this is a CSF leak, a CT myelogram would be a more appropriate study.
Possible kink in the centralv enous catheter on the scout, unchanged from prior CTA Chest - d/w RN taking care of pt by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2158-10-27**].
PENDING STUDIES: - Pleural fluid cytology - TSH - Pleural fluid beta2-transferrin and protein electropheresis - [**10-22**] Blood cultures pending, no growth to date - [**10-26**] Pleural fluid culture, no growth to date  Brief Hospital Course: 68 year-old female with history of bilateral breast cancer and metastatic kidney cancer with extensive osseous and pulmonary metastases who was discharged to NH from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2158-10-19**] after an admission during which she was diagnosed with extensive bony metastasis, and was treated with T9-L1 posterior fusion for unstable T11 metastasis.
Hypoxia: She has extensive pulmonary disease as evidenced by her CXR and CTA.
She responded well to one dose of lasix but further doses were deferred as she was on room air most of the time and refused further labs draws.
Urine culture grew E Coli and Klebsiella both sensitive to cipro and Bactrim.
She had multiple imaging studies that showed a fluid collection around the wound.
The neurosurgery team will follow-up these studies as an outpatient and decide if a lumbar drain is needed.
Hemolysis labs were unremarkable.
She refused a chest film to confirm patency of indwelling chest port.
There was also some concern that the line was kinked on her CT chest.
Blood return was achieved and line was patent on DC.
She refused all labs and xrays over the last 1-2 days of her admission.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Pending studies: TSH, blood culture, pleural fluid culture, cytology, beta2 transferrin and PEP - Needs neurosurgical/ortho-spine followup for her wound in 2 weeks.
Medications on Admission: - anastrozole 1 mg Tablet 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day (Not Taking as Prescribed: no prescription now so not taking) - levothyroxine 50 mcg Tablet 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day - lorazepam [Ativan] 0.5 mg Tablet [**1-15**] Tablet(s) by mouth three times a day as needed for anxiety - ondansetron 4 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve 1 Tablet(s) by mouth every 8 hours as needed for nausea - oxycodone 5 mg Tablet 1 Tablet(s) by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain - oxycodone [OxyContin] 10 mg Tablet Extended Release 12 hr 2 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day - prochlorperazine maleate 10 mg Tablet 1 Tablet(s) by mouth every six (6) hours as needed for nausea/vomiting - simvastatin 10 mg Tablet 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day - valsartan [Diovan] 160 mg Tablet 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day hold for bp < 110 - acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet 1 Tablet(s) by mouth every 6 hours (OTC) prn - aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily - docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule 1 Capsule(s) by mouth   Discharge Medications: 1. anastrozole 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to fevers, confusion and low blood pressures felt to be related to an urinary tract infection (UTI).
It is still leaking significantly and you have labs that are pending to determine the source of leakage.
