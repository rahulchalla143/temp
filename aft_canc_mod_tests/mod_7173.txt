Of note, admission workup revealed guaiac positive stool and continued hematuria, w/ occasional clots passed in the urine.
The decision was made to transfuse 1 unit PRBCs to bolster the pt's baseline HCT, then treat w/ heparin for PE and monitor HCT closely.

MRI abdomen ([**2128-8-18**]): 1.
Atypical hemangioma vs. metastatic disease of L5 for which correlation with bone scan or CT may be obtained.
Chest CTA ([**2128-9-1**]): 1.
The embolus may represent tumor fragments, which is likely given visible tumor thrombus in the L renal vein.
Abdominal CT did not reveal any retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Diagnosis was supported by as supported by decreased serum sodium after normal saline administered in the ED (likely hypoosmotic compared w/ urine osm).
Hematocrit was followed closely.
Goal hematocrit of 25 was maintained via transfusion of 1unit PRBC's on admission.
A chest CT which was obtained at our institution had demonstrated a pulmonary embolus.
On the floor, Ms [**Known lastname 4610**] was carefully monitored for cardiac complications and endocrine dysfunction.
The endocrine team saw her and requested for an 8am cortisol test two days in a row; her cortisol levels were normal and aldosterone levels are still pending.
A cortisol stimulation test was advised, but failed on two attempts, however it was felt that her 8am cortisol level was sufficient.
Initially, her oxygen saturation would drop (lowwest of 78%) during exertion; however, this improved over the course of 3 days until she was able to walk on her own, without oxygen supplmentation and assistance.
They also reccomended for an echo, which did not show any evidence of right heart strain.
Instead, per pulmonary consult, anticoaguation with coumadin was decided on with a target INR between [**3-12**].
Upon discharge, the coumadin dose the prior night was held and her INR was 4.2.
She was told to hold coumadin the night of her discharge, and VNA was arranged in order to monitor the INR levels in the next week.
