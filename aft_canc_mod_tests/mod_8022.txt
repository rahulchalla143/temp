Upon discharge plan was for cardiac catheterization and evaluation for aortic valve replacement if his symptoms did not improve.
He was admitted for evaluation of aortic valve replacement.
Past Medical History: # history of rheumatic heart disease # aortic stenosis [**1-3**] ECHO - Moderate-severe AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2).
# hypertension # osteoporosis # Diabetes mellitus, type II, HbA1c 7.2 [**1-3**] # h/o cirrohsis - Pt says it was noted during his CCY.
Physical Exam: On admission - VS: 98.1, 105/55, 87, 16, 96%RA, BS 118 GENERAL: NAD.
ALT: 22 AP: 67 Tbili: 1.0 Alb: 3.4 AST: 53 LDH: 241 Dbili: TProt: .
============ Microbiology ============ Urine culture [**6-6**] [**2168-6-6**] 5:15 pm URINE      Source: CVS.
Blood culture 5/11x2 and 5/12x1          STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with anterior and anteroseptal akinesis with hypokinesis elsewhere.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-5-25**], left and right ventricular function have now significantly deteriorated.
C. Cath [**2168-6-9**] FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Aortic valvuloplasty with 20 and 23mm balloons.
CTA [**5-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: #  Critical [**Name (NI) **] Pt's recent echo showed valve area 0.5mm2.
Pt had an extensive pre-op assesement, but in the end CT [**Doctor First Name **] did not believe pt was a surgical candiate.
Patient was bolused with IVF and culture data revealed MSSA bacteremia and UTI.
ABG revealed worsening acidosis likely responsible for lack of efficacy to pressors.
# Renal Failure - Patient initially developed renal failure in the setting of sepsis but Cr corrected to 1.0 prior to cardiac cath as hemodynamics improved.
After Cardiac cath Cr elevated to 3.0.
Urine sediment showed white cells which may have been due to infection or AIN.
Repeat ECHO in setting of r/o infectious endocarditis revealed EF now = 20%.
Documented on MRCP as well as CT abdomen.
#  [**Name (NI) 1069**] Pt had loose stool on [**6-4**], and a fever 101.2.
Pt also had hypotension last admission pt underwent CTA which was negative for PE.
# Code - DNR/DNI (briefly reversed for valvuloplasy and then re-initiated DNR/I)  Medications on Admission: - Vitamin K 5mg daily - MVI - Glipizide 5mg [**Hospital1 **] - Lasix 20mg daily - Fluticasone 50mcg [**Hospital1 **] - Lomotil 1 tab q6h prn   Discharge Medications: none  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - Critical aortic stenosis - Atrial fibrillation - Bacteremia  Secondary diagnosis: - cirrhosis - diabetes - systolic heart failure   Discharge Condition: expired  Discharge Instructions: none  Followup Instructions: none.
