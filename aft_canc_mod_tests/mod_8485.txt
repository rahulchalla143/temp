Past Medical History: Lung cancer, stage IIIa (T1b, N2, M0) - [**4-1**] persistent nonproductive cough, chest x-ray at that time, which demonstrated a hilar mass - [**2166-4-14**] chest CT confirmed the presence of a lobulated, left suprahilar pulmonary mass with a large, left hilar and aorticopulmonary window nodal conglomerate - [**2166-5-1**] PET scan demonstrated FDG avid left upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] mass and 2 FDG-avid left hilar masses, and left mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well.
- [**2166-4-30**] head CT negative for evidence of metastatic disease.
-- [**2166-5-9**] mediastinoscopy --> two left-sided (2L and the 4L ), ipsilateral lymph nodes were positive for metastatic undifferentiated carcinoma.
Tumor cells stained positive for TTF-1, cytokeratin 7, synaptophysin, were focally positive for chromogranin and negative for CK20 and LCA, consistent with a carcinoma of lung origin.

An MRI with contrast is recommended for further evaluation.
CT head with contrast [**2-22**]: 1.
If clinically feasible, MRI is more sensitive to detect small lesions and leptomeningeal disease.
MRI with and without contrast [**2-23**]: Supra- and infra-tentorial as well as intraventricular metastatic disease, notably involving the left insular cortex, right cerebellar hemisphere, and third ventricle.
MRI C/T spine [**2-24**] 1.
Compression fracture, with mild loss of height of the Thoracic T5 vertebral body with marrow edema pattern.
Correlation with radionuclide studies and CT is recommended.
A 3.3 x 3.5 cm nodular lesion in the lower neck/upper mediastinum, new since the prior CT chest of [**2166-11-27**].
This needs further evaluation with CT chest, including the lower neck.
MRI [**Doctor Last Name **] [**2-26**] FINDINGS: Since the prior study, the patient has undergone biopsy of the right cerebellar hemispheric lesion.
Status post biopsy of right cerebellar mass with expteced intralesional hemorrhage.
A small- to moderate-sized hiatal hernia is evident.
Nonspecific ground-glass opacities with minimal associated architectural distortion identified in the left lung apex are increased compared to prior study and likely represent post-radiation changes.
[**2-27**] CT CHEST FINDINGS: There is a new left paratracheal mass measuring 3.8 x 3.4 x 2.2 cm causing mild deviaiton of the trachea and left carotid artery concerning for a lymphadenopathy due to metastasis.
A small- to moderate-sized hiatal hernia is evident.
Nonspecific ground-glass opacities with minimal associated architectural distortion identified in the left lung apex are increased compared to prior study and likely represent post-radiation changes.
The non-contrast head CT findings are unchanged compared to [**2167-2-27**].
CT head demonstrated a large mass in the R cerebellum and a smaller lesion in the third ventricle.
Her exam remained stable and post operative head CT showed no hemorrhage.
On [**2-26**] she had a routine head CT for preoperative planning and this showed no change from previous scans.
Postop MRI demonstrated residual cerebellar tumor and so on [**3-4**] she returned to the OR for craniotomy for excision of residual tumor.
Her exam remains stable; SQH was started as well.
