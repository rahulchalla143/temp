At OSH, BP 209/103 on arrival, had left facial droop and "expressive aphasia" but moved all extremities per ED note.
INR was 3.0, head CT with round posterior parietal bleed.
He was also given 4mg ativan  for agitation, loaded with 1gm dilantin, and started on labetalol gtt for blood pressure control, though BP remained elevated in 180s-200.
Blood pressure still quite elevated.
He is also getting an additional 4U FFP for INR 2.2.

Head CT [**10-14**]: unchanged; evidence of mild brain atrophy and patchy decreased attenuation c/w microvascular angiopathy.
Head CT [**11-3**]: resolving area of hemorrhage; possible ectatic basilar tip  MRI of brain (w/ susceptibility) [**2110-10-30**]:  This study is severely limited by motion artifact.
The left parietal hematoma measures 45 x 23 mm in size, with a thin rim of hypointensity on gradient echo images, consistent with a hemosiderin ring.

His hospital course is detailed per system, as follows:  NEURO: Exam at OSH was notable for somnolence and expressive aphasia; however, when awake, he appeared to follow commands and had some fluent spontaneous speech.
On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], he was admitted to the ICU for blood pressure control (209/103), to reverse INR w/ 6 U total FFP and 10mg vit K, and for airway protection.
A repeat CT on [**10-13**] showed stable hemorrhage, and on [**10-14**], CT revealed a slight increase w/ very small extension into the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of L lateral ventricle.
MRI of the brain was attempted, but there was too much motion artifact for adequate interpretation.
A full neurological exam could not be completed until approx 2 weeks after admission as pt remained lethargic: He was found to have UMN pattern on R side w/ strength 4-/5.
There was no evidence of hemorrhage, but his MRI showed extensive white matter ischemic disease.
His carotid duplex and TTE did not show embolic source; he was started on coumadin in [**1-29**] for ?emboli from his paroxysmal Afib.
At his best, he can say several words and [**2-27**] word sentences at times, but his exam varies greatly depending on time of day and physical state.
He was given ativan, and dilantin loaded, with a post-load level in the range of 14 and with a level of 7.0 the following morning, corrected to 11.4 by albumin, prior to maintenance dosing of dilantin 100 mg tid.
An EEG was performed on [**11-17**] which revealed: "mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy manifest mainly by the slowing of the background frequency.
CV: Pt's BP at OSH was 209/103; by the time he arrived at [**Hospital1 18**], his SBP was 180s to 190s.
He was transferred to the ICU on nicardipine drip which helped to decrease his BP to the 130s - 140s.
He was switched to lisinopril and metoprolol (pt was on lisinopril and atenolol prior to admission), and his BP dropped down to high 90s.
Eventually, the ACEI was discontinued, and later the BB was also stopped for BP in low 100s.
RESP: CXR initially showed mild pulmonary edema; was intubated for ?agitation and somnolence on [**10-14**].
On [**10-21**], CXR showed multifocal infiltrates c/w aspiration PNA after emesis [**10-20**].
Likely [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing - pt's O2 sat remained 99% during these episodes.
Last CXR on [**11-3**] suggested resolution of both his pulmonary edema and aspiration pneumonia.
Chest xray at that time showed a new left lower lobe infiltrate.
A repeat chest xray performed later that night for vomiting tube feeds showed some resolution of the former left lower lobe opacity, which was now being called "atelectasis."
However, the patient's symptoms suggested new pneumonia, and he was started on Levaquin and Flagyl (initially Vancomycin, which was discontinued after two doses) to target gram negative and anaerobic pathogens.
His sats remained in the high 90s (97-100%) both on room air and 2L O2.
A Dobhoff was re-inserted (after pt pulled out NG on [**11-5**]) on [**11-7**] to ensure adequate nutrition until his swallow function can be re-evaluated in the next week or so.
A repeat U/A on [**10-29**] showed that he still had infection, now resistant to Bactrim.
He continues to have >50 WBC which may reflect chronic inflammation from XRT and TUNA for rectal CA and BPH, respectively.
On [**11-11**] he spiked a temperature of 101, but no clear source was identified.
UA was negative, and blood cultures were negative as well.
Once again on [**11-17**] he had a low grade temperature and cough; cxr suggested pneumonia and he was treated with Levaquin and Flagyl for aspiration risk and lower suspicion resistant nosocomial pneumonia.
UA was negative at the time.
Creatinine has been normal, thus this was not considered related to intrinsic renal disease.
HEME: Initially, INR was 3.0 at OSH - he had not had regular INR checks.
On admission, he was given FFP and vitamin K for full reversal to INR 1.3 on [**10-13**].
His urine was positive for blood (x2), but his Hct remained stable and hematuria was attributed to manipulation of his bladder previously.
Prophylaxis - Pneumoboots, Protonix, SC heparin, colace were instituted throughout the admission.
DNR - discussed w/ family - HCP.
