ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED.
He was initially treated with Levaquin and ceftazidime until his initial sputum culture was positive for ESBL E. coli.
Bronchoscopy revealed unmarkable right and left mainstem bronchi, BAL performed on LLL and RUL segments.
SBP noted to be in the 200s given lopressor 5 mg IV x 1 and hydral 10 mg IV x 1 with SBP subsequently in the 140s.
Also given lasix 20 mg with ~ 1L urine output.
Pt was started on NVPPV which was followed by SBP to 70s.
BAL cultures subsequently grew 2 strains of resistant pseudomonas, sensitive to Tobramycin and Zosyn, antibiotics were changed accordingly.
The patient's clinical picture continued to improve dramatically but CXR continued to show diffuse patchy alveolar opacities in the right upper zone, right infrahilar region, and in the left upper> mid zones as well as worsening of existing left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
Patient continued to be on AC and [**6-11**] a trial of PSV 15/PEEP 5 was done which patient tolerated well for several hours.
On [**6-12**] a SBT trial was done which the patient failed.
He was aggresively diuresed and PSV was decreased  to PSV 5/PEEP 10 over [**Date range (1) 30711**].
Blood gases showed that he was retaining CO2.
He was re-started on his BiPAP at night [**10-21**] which he did well on.
#Pain control:  A CT scan performed on admission showed a new sternum fracture and several compression fractures from chronic steroid use.
Repeat lower extremity ultrasounds showed no change in his DVTs since [**Month (only) **].
He was found to have urine that was positive for BK virus.
#Urinary retention - upon discontinuation of the foley, the patient had some urinary retention and was unable to void.
Worsening infection, post-procedure increased inflammatory response and relative adrenal insufficiency (on chronic steroids, not started on stress dose pre-procedure) may have all contributed in the acute setting.
After hypotension resolved and pt was weaned off pressors his BP started to rise steadily.
On [**6-13**] SBP was consistently in the 130-180s and metoprolol 25mg TID was started ([**11-19**] pt's reg dose), BP remained high and on [**6-14**] metoprolol was increased to 50mg TID.
# Anemia: While patient was in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he had 2 episodes in which his Hct dropped acutely.
His Hct continued to increase steadily w/o intervention.
The second episode was on [**7-17**] Hct dropped from 29.2-->25.1.
Hct recovered w/o intervention Hct 27.0 on [**6-18**].
# Transaminitis: Patient had AST, ALT, AP and LDH that were mildly elevated from previous measurements.
MRI liver negative for acute process.
