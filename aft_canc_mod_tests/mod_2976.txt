Diagnostic considerations include prior granulomatous disease or possibly treated lymphoma.
If indicated, consider non-urgent outpatient chest CT for further characterization.
Initially there was concern for Sweet's; however, pathology from skin biopsy was not consistent with this.
Pathology prelim with edema and perivascular neutrophilic infiltrate (similar to urticaria, but not consistent with clinical picture).
Rheumatology was consulted following biopsy results (as could be consistent with Still's); felt to be non-rheum in nature.
The following serologies and additional studies were obtained during her admission:  Parvovirus IgG/IgM negative, Mycoplasma IgG pos/IgM neg, RPR neg, Lyme neg, monospot neg, resp viral antigen neg, Rubella and Rubeola IgG pos, ESR 115, RF 20, [**Doctor First Name **] neg.
Blood and urine cultures negative.
Her rash improved significantly (in intensity and distribution) over the course of her admission without any intervention.
She had repeat echo without significant change (normal LV function, no evidence of RV strain, normal atrial size).
No underlying pulmonary disease, though did have new pulmonary edema on CXR (despite normal LV function on echo) which may have triggered the arrhythmia.
BNP was elevated at 3855. .
She should have repeat CBC as an outpatient.
