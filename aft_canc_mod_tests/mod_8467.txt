GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is globally moderately depressed.
LV systolic function is slightly improved.
COMPARISON: MRIs on [**11-28**] and [**2156-11-24**], [**1-26**], [**2151**].
Troponin positive with EKG changes and signs of CHF.
Echo done as part of w/u which revealed severe prosthetic aortic valve stenosis with [**Location (un) 109**] 0.4 cm2, peak gradient 131/mean 83, EF 20%, [**Doctor Last Name **], 1+ AI, 1+ MR, 2+ TR, moderate MAC, ascending aorta 3.9 cm, and severe PA systolic hypertension.
CT torso also revealed mesenteric /mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Cath done [**11-19**] showed a 50% diagonal lesion.
[**Month/Year (2) **] /oncology consult also done with recs for abdominal node biopsy to r/o malignancy.
Carotid US did not show any significant stenoses.
HIT panel sent for decreasing platelet count to 91K and all heparin stopped but was ultimately negative.
Node biopsy specimen was nondiagnostic, and general surgery was consulted for possible laparascopic node biopsy.
CT brain done for confusion which did not show any intracranial pathology.
He had a brief episode (less than 1 hour) of A Fib today, with a ventricular rate of 80/minute, which converted spontaneously to NSR.
