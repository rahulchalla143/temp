In the ED, initial vitals were T 100.3, BP 112/89, HR 94, RR 18, 100% NRB.
He was noted to be in AFib at a rate of 135-160 which improved without intervention.
BP dropped to 76 and he was given 5L NS and started on levophed.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Mr. [**Known lastname **] initially presented in early [**6-/2197**] with fever, weight loss, and muscle and joint aches.
He was febrile to 101.6 with a heart rate of 126.
CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on showed multiple low-attenuation lesions within the liver, spleen, and kidneys with characteristics felt atypical for lymphoma.
A follow-up MRI of the abdomen showed hypovascular masses in both kidneys and spleen of various sizes consistent with lymphoma.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] then underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2197-7-26**], which showed extensive necrosis with focal involvement by a high-grade B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type.
FISH translocation was notable for c-Myc and Bcl-2 indicating a "double hit" lymphoma characterized by a Burkitt's-like lymphoma.
Follow up CT imaging on [**2197-8-5**] showed stable lymphomatous lesions in the kidney, spleen, and abdominal nodes.
Readmitted on [**2197-8-18**] for his second cycle of [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy, which was delayed for two days due to hypotension and cough.
A CT of the chest showed bilateral lower lobe opacities, right greater than left, concerning for infection and he was treated with a course of Levaquin.
Follow up PET scan on [**2194-9-6**] showed no evidence for lymphoma but was notable for multiple peripheral base pulmonary opacities with rims of soft tissue density and relative central lucencies most of which were new.
He underwent CT of the chest for further evaluation, which showed multiple filling defects within the segmental and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe arteries compatible with pulmonary emboli.
Admitted on [**2198-1-15**] for IVAC (originally admitted for high-dose MTX, but PET scan showed progressive disease).
However, PET scan prior to admission was concerning for rapidly progressive disease and CT torso on admission agreed with these findings and his LDH continued to rise.
Polymyalgia rheumatica diagnosed in [**2197**] and managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], although further treatment on hold while getting treatment for lymphoma and unclear if his symptoms were related to lymphoma and not PMR.

[**2198-2-3**] CXR: AP chest compared to chest radiograph since [**1-28**], and a chest CT scan [**1-29**].
There is substantial atelectasis at the base of the postoperative right lung and perihilar consolidation which could be atelectasis.
Urine and stool cultures (including multiple C.diff's), and urine Legionella antigen were negative.
CXR and CT showed RML/RLL pneumonia (management of pneumonia is discussed below) and micafungin was added.
All blood cultures were negative.
# Pneumonia: Patient was found to have a RML/RLL pneumonia on CXR, confirmed by CT chest.
There was concern for aspiration so he underwent a video-assisted swallowing study which did not reveal any aspiration, though he was switched to thin liquids and soft solids with aspiration precautions.
A repeat CT chest on [**2-8**] showed new cavitary lesion within the pneumonia.
Post-op course was complicated by a hydropneumothorax which required placement of a pigtail catheter on [**2-22**] which was later removed.
# Increased stool output: Unclear etiology, but all of his stool studies negative, including numerous C. diff toxins.
He is scheduled for a follow-up PET scan on [**2198-3-12**].
