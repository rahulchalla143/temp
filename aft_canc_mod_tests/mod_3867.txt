The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT Abd/pelvis ([**2107-3-28**]): 1.
CXR [**3-28**]: Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in size.
CXR [**3-30**]: Single upright AP chest, comparison [**2107-3-28**], demonstrates interval increase in the retrocardiac opacity with blurring of the hemidiaphragm and aortic interface.
An echo did not show any new wall motion abnormalities or CHF.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and he was ruled out.
CXRs showed no recurrence of pulmonary edema but persistent lower lobe consolidations.
Abdominal distension: On HD#3, developed progressive abdominal distension with initial concern for SBO despite the patient having flatus and passing BMs.
A CT abdomen/pelvis was recommended.
The CT demonstrated contrast reaching the rectum with no evidence of an SBO.
Serial exams revealed improving distension, patient had multiple bowel movements, and patient was tolerating PO diet at time of discharge.
He presented on coumadin, which was held given an initially supratherapeutic INR (3.1, 3.8, 4.0).
Labs were not consistent with DIC.
He was given 2mg of SC vitamin K and his INR decreased to 2.2.
Coumadin was restarted [**3-29**] and INR remained subtherapeutic at 1.7.
CAD: Ruled out acute MI with serial cardiac enzymes.
Pump: Clinical exam initially consistent with left sided heart failure and has some improvement after aggressive diuresis.
However echo with no obvious ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction with an LVEF >50%.
Responded well to a one time dose of IV Lasix and did not require further diuresis once his BP was controlled.
Elevated Indirect bilirubinemia: There were no signs of cholecystitis on exam or imaging.
His hematocrit remained stable throughout and there were no signs of significant hemolysis.
His Tbili trended down throughout admission with normal LFTs throughout and no abdominal pain.
Hct was stable throughout.
