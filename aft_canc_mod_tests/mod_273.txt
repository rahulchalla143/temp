MRI head shows that residual pituitary lesion.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch  On Discharge: EO, oriented to self and hospital.
Inc c/d/i  Pertinent Results: [**2125-10-31**] CT head demonstrates expected postop changes, no hemorrhage, moderate hydrocephalus  Pathology Report Tissue: Right sellar tumor.
MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST Study Date of [**2125-10-31**] 6:07 AM IMPRESSION: Stable residual neoplasm in the right side of the sella extending into the right cavernous sinus, and encasing the cavernous segment of right internal carotid artery.
MR PITUITARY W&W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2125-11-1**] 7:53 PM  IMPRESSION PER RADIOLOGY:  The study is limited due to motion artefact.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-2**] 4:34 AM IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2124-12-13**]:  Moderately severe opacification in the left mid and lower lung zones is probably edema, also affecting the right lower lung and accompanied by a moderate right pleural effusion.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2125-11-2**] 8:11 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Expected postoperative changes related to right craniotomy  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-2**] 7:02 PM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-2**] at 4:33 a.m. and 1:08 p.m.:  New endotracheal tube in standard placement.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-4-15**], biventricular systolic function is more dynamic (and the heart rate is higher).
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-3**] 10:07 AM  IMPRESSION: AP chest submitted for review at 4:53 p.m.:  Moderate pulmonary edema unchanged since [**11-3**].
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-3**] 1:03 PM IMPRESSION: Dobbhoff tube with a wire stylet in place ends at the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced at least 5 cm to move the entire weighted tip into the body of the stomach.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-4**] 10:06 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-2**] through 10: Minimal edema persists in the left lung.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-5**] FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube sits 4 cm above the carina.
The lungs continue to demonstrate heterogeneous opacity in the right mid and lower portion, which may represent an area of scarring.
Additionally, more scattered punctate densities throughout the right and left lung are compatible with calcified pleural plaques as confirmed by the visualized chest portion of the abdominal and pelvic CT from [**2125-2-9**].
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-6**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
Unchanged course and position of the monitoring and support devices.
MRI BRAIN WITH & WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2125-11-7**] FINDINGS: The patient is status post right frontotemporal craniotomy for resection of pituitary mass.
EEG [**2125-11-7**] IMPRESSION: This continuous recording shows what appears to be an evolving diffuse encephalopathy.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-7**] Right mid and lower lung and left lower lung opacities concerning for multifocal pneumonia have worsened since [**2125-11-6**].
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-8**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the entire upper part of the chest missing on the current image.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-9**] Extensive infiltrative pulmonary abnormality in the right lower lobe, and overlying pleural calcification are longstanding, but previous pulmonary edema in this location has improved if not resolved, leaving behind a small residual right pleural effusion.
EEG [**11-8**]- [**11-9**]: This is an abnormal continuous ICU video EEG due to diffuse attenuation and slowing of background consistent with a moderate  encephalopathy.
EEG [**11-10**]:  [**2125-11-10**]: CXR portable: New right PICC line tip terminates at the level of mid SVC.
[**2125-11-11**] CT head: 1.
Prominent hypodense bifrontal hygromas, unchanged over multiple prior examinations, including the most recent MR examination from [**2125-11-6**].
Postoperative head CT demonstrated expected postoperative changes with minimal pneumocephalus.
Postoperatively the patient was monitored with frequent Serum Na and Osm checks and frequent Urine specific gravities, Na and Osms and close Urine output monitering for signs of Diabetes Insipitus.
On POD 1, 24 hours after surgery, the patient's Serum Na started trending up and urine specific gravity trended down.
Urine output consistently was between 150 and 300cc/hour.
Overnight on [**11-1**] into [**11-2**] Serum Na trended up to 156 and the patient became agitated.
Urine Specific gravity was 1.005.
He was given DDAVP and IVF boluses to match urine output.
He underwent postoperative MRI overnight that demonstrated expected postoperative changes without evidence of stroke.
A repeat head CT was perfomed and found to be stable.
The serum sodium was NA 153.
The urine specific gravity was 1.021.
The urine output was decreased and there were crackles at bilateral bases.
On [**11-4**], The patient was not thought to be in Diabetes Insipitus (the urine specific gravity was 1.018) per endocrine consultation.
The serum sodium has improved to 148.
There were copious secretions and a mini BAL was sent which was positive for hemophilus and Gram Positive Cocci.
LENIS were performed due to prolonged bedrest and there was No Deep Vein Thrombosis present in both lower extremities.
The patient underwent a bronchcoscopy today and there were copious secretion and mucous plugs and a BAL was sent for culture.
The urine sodium, specific gravity and osmolaity /serum osmoality and sodium were changed to every 8 hours from every 4 hours.
On [**11-6**] an MRI was performed and was negative for stroke or significant edema.
His  neurological exam was stable.
He was on CPAP and ABG was within normal limits but BAL from [**11-4**] revealed multiple organisms therefore an ID Consult was requested.
Na was 145 and urine was WNL therefore free water was decreased to 200ml Q4hrs.
He also had another bronchoscopy and washigns were sent for culture and evaluation.
The patient underwent a lumbar puncture which was negative for infection.
EEG monitoring continued to be negative for seizure activity.
A repeat head CT was done to evaluate bilateral hygromas seen on MRI.
Head CT showed stable hygromas and patient was then transferred to the step down unit.
On [**11-12**] he had a swallow evaluation and his diet was advanced.
Labs continued to be followed Q12hrs.
He will need Routine labs checked to evaluate for hypo- and hypernatremia.
No further imaging will be needed before this appointment.
