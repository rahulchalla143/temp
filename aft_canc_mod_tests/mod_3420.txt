She should record her fasting blood sugar in the morning and her blood sugar 2 hours after each meal.
However, your course was complicated by an irregular heart rhythm called atrial flutter which required a transfer to the ICU.
As your heart rate was not controlled by medications alone, you underwent cardioversion in the ICU.
The steroids did cause your blood sugars levels to be high, so you will need to be on insulin for now.
The following changes were made to your medications: - START amiodarone for heart rhythm abnormality - START prednisone for low steroid levels - START levothyroxine for low thyroid levels - STOP diltiazem - STOP metoprolol - CHANGE lovenox to 150 mg injected twice a day  Please take all medications as prescribed.
You should record your fasting blood sugar in the morning and her blood sugar 2 hours after each meal.
Please avoid foods that will increase your blood sugar, such as candy, cake, cookies, and juice.
Followup Instructions: Please follow up at [**Last Name (un) **] at 1pm on Tuesday with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NP for teaching about how to check blood sugars.
