Pulmonary function tests at that time revealed mild restrictive lung disease and flow volume loop revealed extra thoracic obstruction.
Chest x-ray was found to be negative.
Given the patient's previous history of pulmonary emboli a CTA was performed, which showed no PEs.
The patient was evaluated at that time with laryngoscopy and it was noted that there was significant edema and erythema of the false cords and folds bilaterally.
Given the question of a supraglottitis versus laryngeal mass CT of the neck was performed simultaneously with the CT angiogram and showed fullness and thickening of the vocal cords bilaterally with narrowing of the airway.
Congestive heart failure last echocardiogram from [**2166**] shows biventricular enlargement, systolic dysfunction with an EF of 25%, moderate mitral regurgitation and pulmonary artery hypertension.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.2.
Heart rate 50.
Blood pressure 144/85.
Respiratory rate 26, 98% on 2 lites.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 19.3, hematocrit 49.4, platelets 227.
Chemistry 136, 4.8, 94, 29, 35, 1.0 and glucose 221.
Digoxin level .9, calcium 9.7, phos 3.8, mag 2.0, PT 16.9, PTT 25.8 and INR 1.9.
Chest x-ray showed no pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
Neck and CTA showed no PE and fullness and thickening of the bilateral vocal cords with narrowing of airway as described above, no discreet mass or lymphadenopathy.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with frequent premature ventricular contractions.
This was compared with electrocardiogram from [**2169-12-18**].
Repeat fiberoptic examination on [**1-7**] revealed mild epiglottic edema, bilateral false vocal cord edema, limited PVC motion and limited visualization of the left posterior vocal cord.
Repeat echocardiogram showed an EF less then 20% with severe left ventricular dilatation.
At times he dropped his rate down into the 40s, but with over symptomatic or dropped his blood pressure.
Following the biopsy it was known that the edema was more consistent with tumor and therefore the Ceftriaxone was discontinued.
A repeat laryngoscope was performed on [**1-11**] through the ET tube.
The nose, tongue base and epiglottis were all found to be stable.
The larynx showed some edema, but decreased erythema.
An ultrasound revealed a deep venous thrombosis in the left axillary vein extending to the brachial veins.
secondary to his previous INR goal for atrial fibrillation.
The patient's INR should be followed given his recent change in Coumadin dose and recent antibiotic Ceftriaxone.
The patient's sodium should also be followed.
