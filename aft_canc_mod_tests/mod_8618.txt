He was found to have anemia to hct of 22, requiring 3 units of pRBCs.
Cardiac markers were negative x3, but note made of prolonged QT on EKG.
Overnight on [**12-20**] to [**12-21**], pt appeared fluid overloaded with dyspnea, so furosemide was started.
He was also started on methylprednisone for possible wheezing and concern for developing shock and ?adrenal insufficiency (BP 84/51).
He said he had a cough yesterday, producing brown, non-bloody sputum, but this was the first time it was productive.
On transfer, initial vs were: T 98.8 P 84 BP 121/65 R 21 O2 sat 92% on 100% non-rebreather.
MICRO: BCX [**12-21**] - pending Legionella Ag [**12-21**] - pending  .
IMAGING: CXR [**12-21**]: New extensive parenchymal opacities have been demonstrated throughout the lungs with significant worsening of the left lower lobe consolidation and new right upper lung consolidation as well as diffuse opacities.
His dyspnea was thought to be due to to PNA as evidenced by new purulent cough and infiltrates on exam, also suggested by CXR with worsening consolidation in LLL and new consolidation in RUL.
In terms of the workup for the resp failure, Sputum Cx, Blood Cx, legionella Ag were sent, which showed AFB on smear.
OSH CT chest was reviewed, showing diffuse GGOs.
OSH microdata showed no growth.
A second sputum smear was sent and was negative for AFB, but given earlier indeterminate result a PCR probe was nonetheless sent to the state lab.
Initial and repeat BAL failed to grow bacterial organisms, and were negative for PJP via immunofluorescence, as well as legionella, fungal, and viral cultures.
Serum studies showed negative beta-glucan and histo Ag.
A quantiferon gold was sent given concern for MTB and was negative.
MTB PCR came back negative and patient was taken off TB precautions.
# pancytopenia: Patient initially presented to OSH with Hct of 22, with guaiac positive stools, but not frank bleeding.
On initial presentation, Hct 27.7, from 22 at OSH per report, s/p 3 units PRBC's.
Hct was checked q6hr and was stable.
Hemolysis and DIC were ruled out, and HIT was thought to be unlikely.
An UE U/S showed no DVT, and given cellulitic appearance and pain, the picc was pulled.
Q4 neurovascular checks were initiated to monitor for compartment syndrome.
