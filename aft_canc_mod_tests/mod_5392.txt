EXAMINATION: CT abdomen.
FINDINGS: A CT of chest and abdomen was performed with axial images taken from the lung apices to the symphysis pubis.
On the CT of thorax there is some soft tissue in the apices bilaterally which may represent apical scarring.
IMPRESSION: Status post perforation from recent examination most likely secondary to EGD.

These have included a colonoscopy with BICAP of angiodysplastic lesions in the cecum, as well as removal of a sigmoid polyp.
She originally did well, but then developed the sudden onset of abdominal pain and had free air under the diaphragm, confirmed both by upright chest x-ray and CT scan.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 4427**] had been admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-23**] under the medical service for a colonoscopy secondary to her inability to tolerate the oral contrast and a history of congestive heart failure and anemia, along with her age of [**Age over 90 **] years.
The colonoscopy demonstrated multiple diverticula and angioectasias which were cauterized.
An abdominal x-ray showed free air under the diaphragm.
An abdominal and pelvic CT scan was done which showed free intraperitoneal air and perforation.
Ampicillin was added on POD 4 after a nasal swab confirmed Staph Aureus Coag + and was completed after four days of treatment and a repeat culture showing no growth.
Her creatinine was found to be elevated at 1.7 which was thought to be related to the CT scan contrast.
On POD 2 a Levophed drip was started to maintain her systolic blood pressure greater than 110 and a renal consultation was initiated.
An echocardiogram was also done in the setting of her history of congestive heart failure, her central venous pressures of 16 and low urine output.
This showed her systolic function to be >55% along with mild pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid, and mitral regurgitation.
An arterial blood gas demonstrated respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
A chest x-ray confirmed pulmonary edema.
Hemodialysis was also started on POD 3 by the renal service after her persistent anuria and a creatinine of 3.7.
On POD 6 the dialysis was stopped secondary to an increase in urine output but was resumed on POD 7 after her weight was noted to have increased, she was anuric, and pulmonary failure was noted on chest x-ray.
On POD 6 and 7 she was transfused a total of two units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 24 and 21 with no active signs of bleeding, with a good response in her hematocrit.
On POD 9 the Levophed was discontinued and hemodialysis was stopped secondary to improvement in her renal function; her serum creatinine was 0.7, and her urine output was satisfactory.
POD 12 a diet was resumed, she remained afebrile, and her central venous catheter was removed secondary to an increased white blood cell count of 15.5k; the tip was cultured with no growth found.
Diuresis continued with daily Lasix with a good response in her urine output.
She had completed her antibiotic course and her white blood cell count was stable at 12.9k.
The Lasix was continued daily with the dose decreased from 40mg to 20mg, her BUN was 29 with a creatinine of 0.9.
She was hemodynamically stable at the time of discharge with a hematocrit of 25.2.
