This could be further evaluated with abdominal CT if clinically indicated.
CXR [**2163-9-29**] Extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the neck, supraclavicular regions and small pneumomediastinum is better seen in subsequent CT of the chest as well as collapse of the left lower lobe and almost complete collapse of the right lower lobe.
CT Neck/Chest [**2163-9-29**] 1.
Further evaluation with dedicated abdominal imaging is recommended.
Renal US [**2163-9-30**] 1.
The marked peripancreatic stranding that was seen on prior CT was not evaluated with ultrasound.
CT AP [**2163-10-1**] 1.
If prior imaging is not available elsewhere to demonstrate long term stability, characterization with contrast enhanced CT scan is recommended when clinically feasible.
On the images obtained there is no evidence of thrombus in lower extremity.
[**2163-10-1**] CT abd INDICATION: 74-year-old male with pancreatitis and persistent fevers.
EXAMINATION: CT of the abdomen and pelvis without intravenous contrast.
COMPARISONS: Renal ultrasound from [**2163-9-30**] and CT of the chest from [**2163-9-30**].
FINDINGS:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY:  There is a small left and moderate right pleural effusion.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY: A rectal catheter is demonstrated in place.
If prior imaging is not available elsewhere to demonstrate long term stability, characterization with contrast enhanced CT scan is recommended when clinically feasible.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CT chest, abd [**2163-10-3**] FINDINGS:  CHEST: Moderate left and small right pleural effusions are similar in size to [**10-1**].
The pancreatic head enhances normally, but only minimal enhancing pancreatic tissue is seen in the body and tail, consistent with pancreatic necrosis.
Comparison made to CT [**2163-10-3**], [**2163-10-1**] and renal ultrasound [**2163-9-30**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained without the use of intravenous contrast.
The lack of intravenous contrast limits evaluation of the solid parenchymal organs.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CT abdomen at [**Hospital1 18**] showed severe pancreatic necrosis, extensive stranding and fluid around the pancreas but no discrete drainable fluid collections.
