Specifically, his rectal pain was worsened with bowel movements and associated with constipation and LLQ crampy pain, and he noted scant red blood in his stools after bowel movements.
He presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2181-2-5**] where a CXR showed a right sided pneumonia, for which he received levofloxacin, zosyn, IV solumedrol (long smoking history and concern for COPD), and nebulizers.
A rectal exam revealed a new mass, which was biopsied under general anesthesia, results are pending.
A CT abdomen and pelvis showed mild diverticulitis.
On the fourth hospital day, he had new, volumnious diarrhea, with 15 bowel movements each night.
Stool was sent for C. diff, which was positive on the third set.
His WBC count climbed over his hospital course, however, from 40 on admission to 109, in the setting of CMML, PNA, C. diff, and steroid treatment.
Heme-onc was consulted, and performed a bone marrow biopsy, which [**Name8 (MD) **] MD sign-out showed "mild blasts on flow cytometry"; however, it was felt that this was likely demargination from steroids, C.diff, and PNA.
A d-dimer was negative, though it was performed while the patient was already started on empiric anticoagulation with heparin for presumed PE, and a V/Q scan was indeterminate.
CT Chest [**2181-2-8**] : borderline LNs in mediastinum, large spleen, bilateral patches of feathery infiltrates, no consolidation, small bilateral pleural effusion .
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2181-2-5**]:  inflammation posterior to proximal descending colon with small fluid in pericolic gutter suggestive of diverticulitis; mild splenomegaly; small AAA .
CXR: [**2181-2-5**]:  limited exam, LLL infiltrate [**2181-2-7**]:  partial clearing of LLL infiltrate, small bilateral pleural effusions [**2181-2-11**]:  no acute cardiopulm process [**2181-2-14**]:  no acute cardiopulm process [**2181-2-15**]:  no acute cardiopulm process [**2181-2-18**]:  new RUL airspace disease, minimal LUL airspace disease, these findings consistent with pneumonia, lung bases are clear .
Echocardiogram [**2181-2-8**]:  LVEF 55%, 1+ TR, 1+ MR .
V/Q scan [**2181-2-17**]:  multiple subsegmental matched perfusion defects, no unmatched perfusion defects, indeterminant result .
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f [**Hospital 80861**] transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
He was empirically started on vancomycin and zosyn, and though he had a negative D-dimer and V/Q scan at [**Hospital3 3583**] an ECHO and LENIs were attained and demonstrated no evidence of right heart strain or DVT.
A Broncoscopy was down and viral cultures were RSV postive.
He was also started on hydroxyurea to prevent leukostasis, though the heme/onc service thought that this was unlikely to be the etiology for his hypoxia and CXR infiltrates.
Pulmonary function test were performed which showed mild restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect and reduced diffusing capacity.
Leukocytosis:  Patient's WBC count increased from 40K on admission to [**Hospital3 3583**] to 104K at time of transfer.
Steroids were discontinued and hydrea was started with improvement in his white count to 30 at discharge.
Blood cultures were negative.
The mass was concerning for squamous cell carcinoma per report and the biopsy results are pending at the time of discharge.
MRI of the pelvis was performed and showed extension into the distal rectum, levator muscle as well as iliac lymph nodes.
The patient underwent anesthesia pre-op evaluation prior to discharge on [**2181-2-28**].
An MRI showed extension into your muscles and rectum.
You will have surgery with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1120**] on Monday, [**2181-3-5**].
