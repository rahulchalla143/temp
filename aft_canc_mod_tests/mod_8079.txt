Per Atrius records, a chest x-ray was taken on [**2132-3-5**] at [**Location (un) 1459**] [**Location (un) **].
The radiologist described an irregular left upper lobe parenchymal opacity and recommended a chest CT.  She returned on [**2132-3-6**] where CT chest revealed a 2.5 x 4 cm thin walled air containing cyst, which contains a mural nodule laterally on the left.
The above imaging was followed up with PET here on [**2132-4-17**] which revealed FDG avid RUL, LUL, left axillary, left lung base and pleural thickening.
Blood tests from previous workup show negative Quantiferon TB gold, aspergillus fumigatus 2 bands positive, concerning for possible fungus ball, elevated esr with +[**Doctor First Name **] and DS-DNA+.
Labs notable for WBC 11 (WBC 10), Hct 32.3 (most recent Hct 29), plts 536, lytes wnl.
ECG showed SR 76, no ST changes, no priors for comparison.
Vitals prior to transfer: 98.4 115/73 71 16 96%RA.
Past Medical History: LUL mass (Per Atrius Records) Elevated sed rate positive [**Doctor First Name **] abnormal CT with LUL mass, hilar lymphadenopathy   Social History: Lives with husband, mother is in from [**Name (NI) **] to help with her care.
PER PATIENT--DO NOT DISCUSS DETAILS WITH PT'S HUSBAND - PT WILL NEED SW CONSULT in house.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM on admission: VS - Temp 98.2F, BP 110/70 , HR73 , R 18 , 98O2-sat % RA GENERAL - middle-aged woman, crying, complaining of severe L sided chest pain.
Exam limited by lack of Pt participation, but Pt denied any numbness of bilateral upper extremities.

Left paratracheal and AP window FDG avid nodes.
[**2132-4-23**] Radiology CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on the pre-contrast acquisition.
Upon retrospective review of the prior CT (from PET study), although the masses cannot be visualized due to incomplete imaging through the head, unenhanced nature of the scan, and low-dose acquisition technique, there is some evidence of cerebral edema, suggesting that the masses were present at that time.
IMPRESSION: Several intracerebral white matter lesions with very thin rim-enhancement and extensive vasogenic edema; the differential diagnosis includes metastatic disease, or less likely, based on imaging characteristics, an infectious processes, such a pyogenic abscess.
[**2132-4-23**] Radiology MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS - read pending.
Prelim examinations shows extensive lesions and edema consistent w/ prior CT head.
prelim PATH: poorly differentiated lung cancer  Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2132-4-24**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of excessive drowsiness.
Given the time of day that this study started, it still may be within normal limits.
There were no significant focal abnormalities to go along with the clinical examination and history.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2132-4-24**] 11:40 AM IMPRESSION:  Overall stable mass effect from the multiple intracranial lesions causing significant distortion of the midbrain, which continues to raise concern for impending downward transtentorial herniation.
Correlate clinically and labs and rec.
Pt's alterness and interactiveness improved by mid-day [**2132-4-23**], but CT head w/ contrast showed extensive rim enhancing brain lesions and edema as described above, concerning for brain mets versus less likely infection.
Neuro-oncology was consulted and felt that imaging was consistent with metastatic disease, but could not rule out infection.
Over the following 3 days she did not have any substantial improvement in her confusional state and her exam waxed/wanned between acute agitation with yelling, pulling at clothes/hair, and sedation.
#LUL mass:  Lung biopsy during this admission returned showing poorly differentiated cancer with squamous features.
# RUE, RLE numbness and weakness:  Atrius records suggest RLE/LUE sensorimotor neuropathies, but unable to discern on exam due to lack of Pt participation.
Bilirubin, haptoglobin, and LDH are all normal.
