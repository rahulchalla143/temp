A Pap smear and biopsy of a right vaginal apex thickening on [**2172-5-21**] revealed recurrent adenocarcinoma.
A PET CT [**2172-5-29**] showed no evidence of metastatic disease.
Multiple cultures returned with no growth (bacterial or fungal) after [**6-27**]; a RUQ ultrasound and HIDA scan were neg for collections.
Multiple CT torso scans showed sinusitis (cx by ENT was negative), possible fungal ball vs collection in the R renal collecting system (f/u renal U/S was negative); echocardiogram was negative for vegetations.
Aspergillus was negative but the beta glucan was moderately positive.
Re-exploration for partial abdominal closure on [**7-7**] and re-exploration total closure on [**7-18**] also yielded no significant collections.
A pigtail catheter was placed [**7-29**] to drain a pelvic collection seen on CT, which also yielded negative cultures.
On [**8-25**] CT-guided drainage of the pelvic collection yielded 8 cc of purulent fluid.
Repeat CT of pelvis on [**9-14**] showed decreased size of fluid collection.
On [**9-3**] urine culture grew Serratia.
Repeat urine culture on [**9-7**] was [**Last Name (un) **] positive for Serratia.
Urine culture on [**9-10**] showed no growth.
Klebisella grew from blood cultures on [**9-3**].
Subsequent serial blood cultures showed no growth to date.
Of note, she was noted to have decreased gag reflex [**7-5**].
A head CT on [**7-5**] was negative for bleed/ischemia.
Echo [**6-29**] showed global biventricular hypokinesis likely from sepsis, EF 20%.
Serial echos showed improvement to an EF of 50-55% on [**7-17**].
Pulmonary effusions: Pt developed significant pulmonary effusions immediatley postop, which was tapped on [**7-15**].
CT surgery was consulted for possible U/S guided thoracentesis, but the effusions dramatically improved and the thoracentesis was cancelled.
GI: a. Liver shock: Pt's ALT and AST rose as high as the [**2165**] and her total bilirubin as high as 10 during her septic shock, which slowly resolved over her hospitalization but remained somewhat elevated.
RUQ ultrasounds and HIDA scans were negative for significant pathology.
CT scan on [**7-28**] noted worsening left hydroureter and hydronephrosis.
Per urology, a urogram was done on [**7-30**].
Neupogen was given [**6-28**] and her WBC rose appropriately to as high as 20s.
b. blood loss and dilutional anemia: Hct was kept above 21, which required multiple PRBCs.
