Although the biopsies were negative, the positive PET scan and positive washings make this lesion highly suspicious for lung cancer.
Pain Score: 0.

She had some sinus bradycardia intraop therefore had cardiac enzymes cycled post op.
Her troponin were normal x 3 and she had no EKG changes.
A bronchoscopy was done on [**2113-10-13**] to evaluate her airway and thick tenacious secretions were found in the bronchus intermedius and removed.
They felt that her neuro exam was that of MCI (mild cognitive impairment) as opposed to Alzheimer's as she had no functional impairment and was not dependent.
Her chest xrays were followed daily and she underwent another bronchoscopy on [**2113-10-16**] and had secretions in both the right and left main stem which were aspirated.
Her culture grew >100K Citrobacter.
Her WBC has been as high as 27K and as low as 15K post op, currently 20K without any bands in her differential.
Information was obtained from Patient.
Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain 7.
