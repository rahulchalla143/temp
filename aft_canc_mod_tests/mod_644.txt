A chest x-ray ordered by her PCP demonstrated [**Name Initial (PRE) **] suspicious spiculated LLL lung nodule, and CT scan revealed a 5.2-cm juxtahilar superior segment spiculated mass and left hilar lymph node enlargement, as well as esophageal thickening consistent with primary esophageal neoplasm.
Subsequently, she underwent PET scan which revealed a dominant FDG-avid left hilar mass, SUVmax 13.6, centered in the superior segment of the left lower lobe, compatible with bronchogenic carcinoma, as well as low-level FDG-avid nodules at the base of the left upper lobe and in the right lower lobe and FDG avidity in and around the distal esophagus with a thickened wall.
Biopsy obtained on EUS revealed adenocarcinoma, positive staining of the tumor cells with CDX2, variable staining of the tumor cells with cytokeratin 7 and few scattered tumor cells staining with cytokeratin 20, with tumor cells nonreactive with TTF-1.
Biopsy obtained on EBUS revealed NSCLC, positive staining of the tumor cells with cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1, few scattered cells show positive staining with p63, with tumor cells non-reactive with CK20 and CDX2.
