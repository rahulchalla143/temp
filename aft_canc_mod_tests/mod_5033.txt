Was found to have a pulsus of 15, HR 120, SBP120.
ECHO at OSH demonstrated tamponade physiology with RV collapse.
In the ED T 98.8, HR 114, BP 131/79, RR 29, 100% on 3 LNC and facemask.
At 5:00 pm, underwent multiple sub-xyphoid punctures - 240 cc of bloody fluid drained.
Initial pericardial pressures were 13 mm and were nearly 0 after removing the fluid.
Pulsus was then 11 and HR 117.
ECHO was done following the procedure.
Upon Admission to MICU [**6-26**]: VS - T98.3, BP 117/88, HR 118, O2 95% 6L General - sedated, barely arousable female in NAD, breathing heavily; awakes to loud voice and follows commands only after repeated stimulation HEENT - pupils small and minimally reactive, patient not opening mouth Neck - enlarged area of left parotid with surrounding erythema CV - 2-3/6 holosystolic murmur loudest at apex.
CK 23 Trop I < 0.04 .
[**2151-6-4**] ECHO: LV hyperdynamic systolic function, EF 75-80%, left strium - normal, right strium - normal, aortic root - noral, pericardium - moderate sized pericardial effusion with organized material on the visceral pericardium, consistent with thrombus or tumor, aortic valve - thickened, mitral valve - thickened, tricuspid/pulmonic valves - normal, trace TR .
[**2151-6-25**] CT Neck - 1.
Shortly after her admission to the MICU, the patient became diaphoretic and developed acute respiratory address (RR 30's, O2 sats 80s), and was intubated due to increased work of breathing.
However, evaluation for other sources of infection included CXR, cultures of blood, urine, sputum, stool for c. diff, and parotid gland.
RUQ and abdominal ultrasound were unremarkable for hydronephrosis, cholecystitis and ascites (small amount, insufficient to tap).
Evaluation for cardiogenic sources of shock included enzymes (unremarkable), EKG, and repeat ECHO.
In addition, the femoral TLC (felt to be dirty) was replaced with a subclavian TLC, and a right arterial line was placed.
- continue levophed/vasopressin to maintain MAP > 60.
# PAROTITIS: No stone seen on CT scan.
Parotid gram stain shows GPR.
However, given history of course of nafcillin for LLE cellulitis, urine examined for eos (AIN).
Other casues include post-renal obstruction (ureter mets from ovarian ca), however abdominal usn was negative for hydronephrosis.
- EKG [**6-14**] showed q-waves in III and avF suggestive of prior MI.
- given pts recent episode of hypotension, serial cardiac enzymes were performed to r/o a cardiogenic etiology, and were unremarkable.
- ECHO ([**6-18**]) LVEF >55%.
