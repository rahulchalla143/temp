Evaluation of hilar structures is limited given lack of IV contrast, however, there is fullness adjacent to the left upper lobe bronchus with suggestion of a mass measuring 1.9 x 2.6 cm, may relate to patient's known malignancy (2:19).
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Livery demonstrates fatty  infiltration.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is marked soft tissue thickening and fullness in the deep pelvis effacing the normal fat planes and limiting differentiation between bladder, prostate and residual rectum.

10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..          SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON CULTURE # 279-0219P [**2101-9-17**].
The patient had a positive urinanalysis and urine cultures revealed Pseudomonas growing in both of his nephrostomy tubes which is sensitive to Cefepime.
Metastatic colon cancer: A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed extensive metastases.
Anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia: The patient remains and lab values reveal an anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia.
His Fe/TIBC ratio is less than 5% and his iron levels are low (Fe=9).
His hematocrit remained stable (Hct on discharge=28.2).
Once antibiotic treatment ends on [**10-6**], check a urine culture.
If the culture still has yeast growing, contact a physician to consider treating the yeast.
