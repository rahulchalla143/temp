Bilateral DVT's were discovered on ultrasound ([**12-5**]) and Mr. [**Known lastname 10321**] was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
In the ED, vitals were T 97.8 HR 119 BP 129/97 RR 24 SaO2 98%RA.
Chest CT confirmed massive bilateral PEs.
He was evaluated by his neurosurgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who recommended starting heparin at 1000 units/hour without bolus and repeating a head CT once the patient was therapeutic (PTT 50-70).
ECHO at that time showed RV free wall hypokinesis and abnormal septal motion with a dilated RV.
He remained on [**3-13**] L nc with oxygen sats > 95%.
Head CT (once PTT > 50) showed no acute bleeding.
On admission to the [**Hospital **] medical service his vitals were T 97.7 HR 105, BP 124/82 R 24 SaO2 97%RA.
Physical exam was notable for reduced lung sounds at the bases bilaterally (L>R) with inspiratory wheezes and mild crackles appreciated at the mid right throax and lower left lung base respectively.

The findings of this study were communicated with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and and placed on the ED dashboard at the time of initial review.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2118-12-6**] The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).

Coumadin was started when platelet count rose to above 150.
There was a greater than expected response to coumadin after two doses of 5 mg daily, leading to INR 16.
The patient was started on coumadin 2 mg daily [**2118-12-14**], with INR 3.5 on discharge.
Goal INR is 2.5-3.5, to err on the side of supratherapeutic INR rather than subtherapeutic INR.
The patient's platelet count is 551 on discharge.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Two (2) PO BID (2 times a day).
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule  PO TID (3 times a day).
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**2-9**] Sprays Nasal  QID (4 times a day) as needed for dry nasal mucous membranes.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every six (6) hours as needed for fever or pain: all HO if temp >101, max dose 3g daily.
Chest CT scans on [**12-5**] and [**12-6**] confirmed one large PE in the left pulmonary artery and a second large PE in the inferior branchs of the right pumonary artery.
Serial PT/PTT/INRs were measured and coumadin was added [**12-9**] as per protocol.
Speech/Swallow monitoring was also performed while you were here and showed increased risk for aspiration of thin liquids.
The following were the changes to your medications: Coumadin was started with an INR goal of 2.5-3.5 Dilantin changed to Keppra 1000 mg PO BID Acetaminophen not to exceede 3g/day in setting of daily coumadin.
