The CT perfusion study demonstrates ischemia in the distribution of the inferior division of the left middle cerebral artery.
It is not clear whether the blood volume in the posterior temporal portion of this territory is slightly reduced, i.e.
Questionable focal loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation in the posterior left temporal lobe on the non-contrast CT scan is also inconclusive with respect to the presence of an acute infarction.
CT head negative for acute process done 1 week after stroke  CXR [**3-22**]: Large left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Patient is an 83 yo man with pmhx of DM, HTN, CAD, CHF with EF 20%, Afib, HCC here with acute MCA stroke managed with [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Head CT without acute changes [**3-20**].
Patient's INR climbed despite holding coumadin to 8.6.
2.5 mg vitamin K which resulted in a trending down of the INR to 2.3.
Given the difficulty with his INR, lovenox was started when his INR was 2.3.
Speech and swallow initially thought he was an aspiration risk because of his poor mental status, but as his mental status improved, he was able to eat purreed food with thickened liquids and per nurse was not aspirating at all.
This may be able to be advanced as he continues to improve and regain strength so he will need repeat assessment at some point.
Repeat CT head was negative.
He was noted to have a UTI and was hypernatremic so these were the likely causes.
Will need periodic labs to assess electrolytes especially if his po intake declines.
# UTI: treated with ceftriaxone for 5 days, UA negative on discharge so antibiotics were discontinued .
Cont to monitor chem-7 every few days .
# ARF: His creatinine climbed to 1.5 and his exam was volume overloaded.
On discharge his creatinine was down to 1.1.
# CHF with EF 15-20%: Patient received fluids after his stroke and lasix was held.
We also continued asa, carvedilol and added 5 mg lisinopril once his creatinine normalized.
# AFib: rate controlled with carvedilol without any rvr, started lovenox for anticoagulation once his INR was between [**3-5**] as his INR was difficult to manage for the above reasons on coumadin.
# FEN: restarted pureed diet with thick liquids per s/s eval [**3-22**] and per nurse, no aspiration events.
