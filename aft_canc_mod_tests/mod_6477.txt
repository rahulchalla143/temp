TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT followed by CT angiogram of the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**] with sagittal, coronal, axial slices as well as volume rendering in multiple projections.
Paranasal sinuses, orbits, mastoid air cells are unremarkable.
CT ANGIOGRAM: There is a 6 x 4 mm right MCA aneurysm at the M1-M2 bifurcation.
The basilar artery measures 4 mm on sagittal image 20, series 400B without definite aneurysm.
IMPRESSION: [**Known firstname 122**] [**Known lastname 79930**] underwent cerebral angiography which revealed two mirror aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery bilaterally and a smaller aneurysm at the takeoff of the anterior temporal branch of the right middle cerebral artery.

Provisional Findings Impression: RXRa FRI [**2153-11-2**] 6:32 PM In comparison with the prior examination CT of the head dated [**2153-10-31**], no significant changes are visualized in the interim, persistent amount of blood is identified on the left frontal ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**], however, on the left occipital ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**], apparently has been resolved.
COMPARISON: Multiple prior examinations of the head, the last one CT of the head dated [**2153-10-31**].
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain.
FINDINGS: When compared with a prior CT of the head dated [**2153-10-31**], there has been minimal interval decrease in size of the lateral ventricles, there is no evidence of transependymal migration of CSF.
IMPRESSION: In comparison with the prior examination dated [**2153-10-31**], there is evidence of mild decrease in size of the lateral ventricles, the previously intraventricular hemorrhage identified on the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is no longer visualized.
Final Report TYPE OF EXAMINATION: Chest AP portable single view  INDICATION: Status post PICC line.
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with a preceding similar study of [**2153-10-21**].

On admission, CTA head was performed which showed multiple intracranial aneurysms.
An EVD was placed prior to undergoing angio.
HD6 ([**10-5**]) Patient was taken to angio suite where an angiogram was performed with verapamil injected into the vessel to treat spasm.
Patient spiked a fever and pan cultures were sent, including CSF which grew out coagulase negative staphlococcus.
HD8 ([**10-7**]) ID curbsided for coag neg staph and repeat CSF cultures sent.
HD10 ([**10-9**]) Repeat CTA continued to show vasospasm.
ID continued to follow for fever and recommended therapy with Nafcillin for 4 weeks from the last positive CSF culture which was on [**10-7**].
Pt was doing well neurologically and CTA [**10-14**] showed no significant change.
He was transferred to the step down unit and maintained on telemetry which noted V tach on [**2153-11-5**] / cardiology was consulted and their recs were followed / He is now on Verapamil 80 TID and metoprolol has been adjusted and will continue with Metoprolol XL 100MG daily.
You haven been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), you will not require blood work monitoring while on this medication.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to your appointment.
