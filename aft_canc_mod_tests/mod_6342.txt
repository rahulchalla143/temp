BP was 70/palp and NG lavage was reportedly negative, so he was transfused 4 units PRBCs and 2 units FFP, and given Vitamin K and 2.5 L NS.
Hct was 34 at [**Name (NI) **] (unclear when this was in relation to transfusions).
He had a CT to evaluate his endovascular AAA repair, which was intact.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2182-8-25**] where SBPs were stable in 90s, HR 80s.

Follow-up full colonoscopy at 3 months for elective polypectomy - patient has been scheduled for [**11-26**] at [**Hospital1 18**]..   Brief Hospital Course: Studies:  Colonoscopy: Diverticulosis.
Will have f/u colonoscopy on [**2182-11-26**] for polypectomy.
ECG - A-fib @ 72bpm, LAD, nl intervals, +Qs in III,aVF, TWF diffusely, poor R-wave progression, no prior for comparison .
CXR ([**8-24**]) - mild cardiomegaly, retrocardiac opacity (atelectasis vs. infection), normal pulmonary vascularity, small left pleural effusion .
OSH CT-scan ([**8-24**]) - (prelim) aortobiiliac stent in place, no periaortic hematoma; cholelithiasis and suspected CBD stone w/o e/o cholecystitis; diverticulosis w/o diverticulitis; suspected nonobstructing right renal calculus.
80-M s/ MMP incl dementia, CAD, chronic Afib, CHF, CRI, and diverticulosis, p/w multiple episodes of BRBPR with dropping Hct and HD instability manifesting as hypotension.
CT to eval AAA s/p endovascular repair reportedly negative.
Anti-hypertensives were held initially given hypotension and patient was given gentle hydration given CHF history.
He had no further episodes of bleeding and his HCT remained stable until discharge.
Coagulopathy - Pt w/ INR 1.4 on admit, after receiving 2units FFP and Vit K at OSH.
His final INR on discharge was 1.2 .
Most recent TTE done in [**2178**] per PCP who state EF 45%, last persantine study [**2181**] with EF 55%, patient not currentyl on ASA or plavix, has been very stable recently from CV perspective.
# Chronic atrial-fibrillation - Pt's ECG afib, rate-controlled w/BB but not on any anti-coagulation.
# AAA s/p endovascular repair - Pt had CT at OSH to eval endovascular repair of AAA, which was negative, no leak.

Your blood pressure was low when you were evaluated and you were given blood transfusions and stabilized for transfer to [**Hospital1 **].
The colonoscopy showed that you have some internal hemorrhoids as well diverticula, which are small outpouching in your colon.
You were observed in the Medical ICU after this procedure and had no further episodes of bleeding and your blood counts remained stable.
All of your labs remained normal and you were deemed stable and ready for discharge.
