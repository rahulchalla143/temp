Two days prior to admission to [**Hospital6 256**], she developed dyspnea with oxygen saturation decreasing to the 80s in room air.
Her blood pressure improved with fluid administration.
She was found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli on CT angiogram.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further management.
At [**Hospital6 256**], review of chest CT disclosed segmental bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Cardiac  catheterization in [**2128-8-12**]:  Ejection fraction 57%,  inferior hypokinesis  4.
Vital Signs:  Afebrile, heart rate 90-105, respiratory rate 20-29, blood pressure 84/36, saturation 97% on 2 liters.
Laboratories from the outside hospital showed a white count of 68, a hematocrit of 39.2, a glucose of 123, a sodium of 132, a potassium of 3.5, a chloride of 98, a bicarbonate of 30, a BUN of 5, a creatinine of 0.6, a glucose of 105, a calcium of 8.1 and a magnesium of 2.3.
She was found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli on CT angiogram.
CT angiogram from [**Hospital3 **] was reviewed by radiology.
The patient underwent lower extremity Doppler ultrasounds which were negative.
Her oxygen saturation was stable on [**2-15**] liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.
Cardiovascular:  On admission, the patient was hypotensive and required fluid boluses to maintain her systolic blood pressure over 80.
An arterial line was placed, and it was noted that her systolic pressure was significantly greater with the arterial line [**Location (un) 1131**] than with the non-invasive pressure.
The patient's blood pressure should be checked in the right arm.
The patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled and found to be negative.
The patient also underwent mediastinoscopy which was negative for metastatic disease to the lymph nodes of the mediastinum.
Hematology:  On [**2129-3-13**], the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 24.8.
