Portable CXR [**2200-11-10**]: IMPRESSION: Large left pleural effusion with associated lower lung atelectasis.
Portable CXR [**2200-11-10**]: Previous left pleural effusion has nearly resolved following thoracentesis.
TTE [**2200-11-11**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
CT chest w/o contrast [**2200-11-11**]: FINDINGS: Extensive calcifications of the aorta are noted.
Small amount of pleural effusion on the current study appears to be decreased as compared to [**2200-11-10**] and most likely unchanged since chest radiograph obtained after thoracocentesis.
Portable CXR [**2200-11-13**]: FINDINGS: Since the most recent examination, there has been interval increase in now a small-to-moderate left layering pleural effusion.
Pulmonary vascularity is not increased.
Mild improvement in multifocal ill-defined nodular opacification, as better characterized on CT from [**2200-11-11**].
MRI head w and w/o contrast [**2200-11-14**]: FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate a small area of high signal in the right occipital lobe near the midline without corresponding enhancement.
Given the faint enhancement and T2 abnormality, the differential diagnosis includes a small deep white matter subacute infarct versus a metastatic lesion.
A followup study in two weeks would help for further assessment.
Chest x-ray was significant for a large left pleural effusion.
Analysis showed 300 WBC with 33% PMN.
Light criteria negative for exudate.
Gram stain was negative.
TTE was performed that showed EF >75%.
BNP was [**Numeric Identifier 1199**] on admission but dramatically decreased to 3694 after thoracentesis.
Repeat chest x-ray was consistent with intersitial edema and questionable consolidation in the left lower lobe.
Repeat CXRs showed slow re-accumulation of left pleural effusion.
Cytology of the pleural fluid returned positive for malignant cells, showing metastatic adenocarcinoma.
Prior to discharge, the option of performing a repeat thoracentesis to drain remaining fluid was discussed with the family.
She will need 24 hour care at home, home oxygen at home for oxygen saturation below 90%, and a wheelchair.
The MRI showed a focus of hyperintensity in right occipital lobe that could represent small acute infarct as well as abnormality in left centrum semiovale consistent with either subacute infarct vs metastatic lesion.
Her LDL was 108.
Cr was at baseline 0.6 by time of discharge.
#Hyperglycemia/DM type 2, uncontrolled, without complications: Patient with a history of diabetes and on glimepiride at home presenting with serum glucose of 394.
ABI showed bilateral aortoiliac and likely infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease .
Given overall limited life expectancy, further work-up for PVD was not pursued.
# Bacteremia: Blood culture on arrival to ED [**2200-11-10**] grew GPCs in clusters; she was started on vancomycin empirically.
It was felt that this one positive blood culture was most likely contaminant as pt was afebrile and with downtrending WBC.
Subsequent blood cultures showed no growth.
#Poor po intake: Family was concerned with pt's minimal oral intake, which had been an ongoing problem prior to admission.
She was seen by swallow therapist who performed a bedside evaluation and found no risk of aspiration.
An MRI of the head also showed a possible stroke and possibly spread of cancer to the brain.
