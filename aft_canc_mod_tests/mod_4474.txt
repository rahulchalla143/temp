There is a circular lucency of the left clavicle that appears new from previous chest radiographs though radiograph from [**Month (only) 216**] shows a circular lucency likely linked to the lung.
We repeated his video swallow after that procedure before d/c but swallow function was c/w previous exams and he remained safe for thin liquids and soft foods with extra sauce and gravy.
TTE ([**2136-10-12**]): The left atrium is elongated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-6-15**], no change.

COMPARISON: [**2136-10-26**] CT chest; MR thoracic spine [**10-29**], [**2136**]; CT abdomen and pelvis [**2136-10-31**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the chest were obtained without the use of intravenous contrast.
Subsequently, axial images were obtained after the uneventful administration of 100 mL Optiray intravenous contrast.
Evaluation of distal subsegmental branches is slightly limited secondary to incomplete opacification with contrast.
There is focal narrowing of mild degree in the left main pulmonary artery, unchanged from prior examinations (3:16).
Fluid-filled and dilated esophagus, new from the prior examination which may relate to esophagitis or possibly early stricture formation.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CXR post trach showed no complications with larger lung volumes.
Heart rate was better controlled with amiodarone, but attempts to transition to po amiadorone were hindered by persistent dysphagia.
Patient failed video swallow study and patient had G tube placed by IR on [**10-29**].
During this stay, he complained of persistent dyspnea and CXR showed a new worsening pleural effusion on the right.
CT of the chest on [**10-26**] showed multiple liver mets, T6 collapse, enlarging rt upper pulm nodule, new LLL nodule, equivocal lft pleural based nodule, prominent mediastinal nodes, and moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right.
Heme/onc was consulted who did not feel chemotherapy or further imaging was indicated.
Diagnostic thoracentesis of rt pleural effusion was considered, but patient could not be properly positioned.
MRI of the spine was ordered, and spine consult planned at this time.
Patient developed persistent dyspnea during hospital stay, and CXR noted bilateral pleural effusions.
CT of the chest on [**10-26**] showed multiple liver mets, T6 collapse, enlarging rt upper pulm nodule, new LLL nodule, equivocal lft pleural based nodule, prominent mediastinal nodes, and moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right.
Heme/onc was consulted who did not feel chemotherapy or further imaging was indicated.
Diagnostic thoracentesis of rt pleural effusion was considered, but patient could not be properly positioned.
MRI of the spine was ordered, and spine consult planned at this time.
He then had an EGD and gastric emptying study.
His gastric emptying study was normal.
EGD showed stricture in his upper esophageal sphincter, abnormal mucosa in the esophagus, erythema in the stomach, medium hiatal hernia.
CXR, blood cultures, urine culture were unrevealing.
To ensure that esophageal stricture was not still contributing to his symptoms, he had a video swallow study which was none revealing of contributory pathology.
CT scan of thorax to eval progression of pleural effusion noted compression fracture of T6.
# Atrial fibrillation: He was noted to have asymptomatic atrial fibrillation with RVR on [**10-11**].
TSH was checked and normal; TTE showed elongated LA but was unchanged from prior TTE.
His Hct responded appropriately to 1 unit PRBC [**10-8**].
# Thrombocytopenia: Plt count began trending down from 403 on [**10-21**] to 120 on [**10-30**].
Status: full code  OMED COURSE ([**10-31**] - [**2136-11-15**]): # fevers/PNA: Pt febrile on [**11-11**] with CXR concerning for pneumonia, witnessed aspiration of bilious content.
Sputum Cx positive gram negative rods (pseudomonas-[**Last Name (un) 36**] to zosyn and stenotrophomonas-[**Last Name (un) 36**] to levo/bactrim).
# AF with RVR: rate was well controlled eventually on amiodarone 200mg daily.
Albumin administration from [**Date range (1) **] did little to improve anasarca and pulmonary edema.
4T's score was 3 and workup with HIT antibody was currently not indicated.
A CTA was obtained and a HIT antibody was sent.
The CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism, and the HIT antibody was negative.
Thrombocytopenia likely [**2-15**] tumor invasion of marrow vs. drug effect.
