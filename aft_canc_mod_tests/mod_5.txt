Overall LV systolic function is moderately-to-severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, and extensive apical akinesis.
The estimated PA systolic pressure is normal.

[**2131-7-9**] MRI Abdomen IMPRESSION: 1.
Hypodense flat subcapsular lesion within segment IV-B on prior CT from [**2131-7-6**], demonstrates a slight delayed enhancement; however gross stability since [**2129-4-9**] CT abdomen and pelvis suggest a benign lesion.
Vague 1.3 cm lesion in segment 7 on prior CT from [**2131-7-6**] is not clearly visualized.
However, this examination is motion limited and a small lesion within this vicinity cannot entirely be excluded.
