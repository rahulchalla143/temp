Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2105-1-19**]  12:31:40 PM Ventricular bigeminy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2104-12-31**] right axis deviation and ventricualr ectopy have newly appeared.
TRACING #1 Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 91 140 108 400/448.71 85 96 61  Echo [**1-21**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
LV systolic function appears depressed with inferior/inferolateral/apical akinesis/hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Chest X-Ray [**2105-1-22**]: IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized left-sided pleural effusion with retrocardiac opacification likely due to atelectasis.

A cardiology consult was placed for further management of the NSTEMI.
CV: Echo demonstrated depressed LV systolic function with inferior apical hypokinesis.
She was started on beta-blockade, and transfused PRBC's to maintain her hematocrit > 30.
POD 7, she developed atrial fibrillation with hypotension which responded to an Amiodarone drip, she was then transitioned to oral Amiodarone.
Cardiology determined that she would benefit from anticoagulation therapy, she received one dose of Coumadin, her INR increased to 4.8.
She was given 1u FFP with f/u INR of 3.5.
Coumadin was then held and her INR trended down slowly over the remainder of her hospital stay.
Skin: POD11 a 4cm diameter pressure ulcer was found at midline upper back.
