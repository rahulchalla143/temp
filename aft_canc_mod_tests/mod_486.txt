Post op Head CT [**2-4**]: 1.
MRI [**2-5**]: IMPRESSION: Status post resection of right cerebellar mass without residual nodular areas of enhancement.
There is mass effect on the fourth ventricle which has not increased from previous study and there remains mild dilatation of the ventricles.
The work up of this posterior fossa mass continued on HD #1, as the patient had an MRI and a CT Torso to rule out any further metastases.
An EVD was placed prophylactically in the event of significant post-operative vascogenic edema.
Her post op Head CT did not demonstrate any acute hemorrhage.
