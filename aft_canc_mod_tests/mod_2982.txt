Upper chest/lower neck calcifications, 5:19, most likely representing prior surgery and given the known parathyroid adenoma most likely related to that reason.
[**2122-6-6**] CT Chest 1.
Brief Hospital Course: Course on the Onc Floor: Mr [**Known lastname 50155**] was on [**2122-5-27**] admitted patient with history of Wegener's granulomatosis, MDS/AML, recently on Revlimid therapy, pancytopenia, and poor functional status, presented on  with malaise, fever, and acute on chronic changes to his chest CT with increased size and number of areas of consolidation.
Platelet transfusions were given for platelet counts <50 and PRBCs were given for HCT <21.
On [**6-6**] a repeat CT showed large lung lesions compressing mediastinum with a large pericardial effusion, left pleural effusion, large heart thought to be due to infection vs wegeners w/ hemorrhage.
Interventional pulmonary, CT surgery and interventional radiology were contact[**Name (NI) **] about a biopsy of the lung mass.
Given his thrombocytopenia, risk of bleeding and poor functional status, it was felt that a biopsy carried a high risk of morbidity and mortality.
They declined a autopsy but agreed to a post-mortem bronchoscopy to biopsy the lung mass found on CT.
