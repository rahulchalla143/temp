CSF Gram Stain and Culture ([**2188-5-26**]):    GRAM STAIN (Final [**2188-5-26**]):       4+   (>10 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2188-5-29**]):          ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis ([**2188-5-27**]): 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CXR [**6-1**]: Lordotic positioning and low inspiratory volumes.
A left-sided chest tube is present at the left lung base.
There is upper zone redistribution, pulmonary vascular plethora, and vascular blurring, suggesting CHF, but likely also accentuated by technique.
CXR [**6-2**] AM: Patient has been extubated but overall the lung volumes, though small, are maintained, with persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.
CXR [**6-2**] PM: FINDINGS: The tip of left subclavian line ends at mid SVC.
Severe Sepsis due to Enterococcus faecalis Meningitis and Bacteremia: He presented with AMS and sepsis from bacterial meningitis in the setting of immunosuppresion for his kidney transplant.
His peripheral blood revealed a leukocytosis at 14.6 with 94.9% PMNs.
CSF studies revealed a WBC count of [**Numeric Identifier **] with 97% PMNs and 2% bands, protein of 490 and glucose of 3.
CSF and blood cultures ultimately grew Enterococcus faecalis.
A repeat lumbar puncture on hospital day 3 revealed a WBC count of 100 with protein of 121 and glucose of 33.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was negative for evidence of an intra-abdominal infection.
His peripheral blood WBC count also improved to 9 but after several days into his ICU stay it trended back up to 11.1 and he developed a fever to 101.8, at which time ID recommended the addition of linezolid.
Hypotension:  He was initially hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s.
His blood pressure improved with fluid administration and antibiotics.
He briefly required norepinephrine on [**2099-5-31**] for blood pressure support.
This was followed by CXR without full resolution.
It was felt that his hypertension was in part due to agitation so he was switched from propofol to dexmedetomidine, with some improvement in his blood pressure.
His lisinopril continued to be held given concerns for potential renal injury in setting of gentamicin administration.
PKD s/p Renal Transplant: He received a living donor renal transplant in [**2181**] and has been immune suppressed on Cellcept and Rapamune.
His creatinine on admission was close to baseline range of 1.3-1.5 and remained so throughout his ICU stay.
Transitional Issues: - rapamycin dose increased to 2 mg daily - cellcept dose decreased to 250 mg twice daily - d/c'd home on gentamicin Q48H dosing and Q4H amp with survailence labs sent to the [**Hospital **] clinic - patient is a full code - lisinopril was held at the time discharge - would consider surgical evaluation for removal cystic kidneys as possible source of recurrent infections.
Outpatient Lab Work Q72H Gentamicin trough (drawn before Gentamicin dose) and rapamycin level (prior to morning dose), BUN and creatinine for 1 week.
You will receive IV antibiotics at home through a visiting IV medication company that will also draw weekly labs that will be sent to our infectious disease experts.
We made the following changes to your medications: - STOP lisinopril until you have completed IV antibiotics - STOP metoprolol - START labetalol 200 mg three times a day, a drug related to metoprolol - START ampacillin 2 g IV every 4 hours for 5 additional weeks - START Gentamicin 420 mg every 48 hours for 1 week - REDUCE your dose of CellCept to 250 mg twice daily until you have completed IV antibiotics - INCREASE your sirolimus to 2 mg daily from 1 mg daily  Please follow-up with your physicians as listed below.
