UA showed RBC 64, WBC 37, Bacteria few, Leuk mod, Nitrite negative.
CXR (prelim) shows atelectasis, no acute process.
ECG showed sinus tachycardia.
CT abd/pelvis showed new L paraspinal muscle hematoma likely [**3-14**] Lovenox, no active extravasation, IVC filter w/ unchanged R common/ext iliac clot.

Lung volumes are low, there is continued left lower lobe opacity with partial silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm, corresponding to atelectasis on prior CT. Small left pleural effusion is also present.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CT ARTERIOGRAM: There is no evidence of active arterial extravasation.
CT VENOGRAM: There is no evidence of venous extravasation.
The portal, splenic, superior and inferior mesenteric, and hepatic veins are widely patent.
# Anemia: On [**Known lastname **] hct 22.3, down from 27 on discharge on [**2109-2-18**].
Likely primarily due to new left paraspinal muscle hematoma seen on CT (7.1 cm TV x 5 cm AP x 9.2 cm SI, spanning the L1 through L4 levels).
[**Month (only) 116**] also be due worsened by acute blood loss (see above) and DVT.
Her HR decreased with blood transfusion and IV fluids to 90s-100s.
Metoprolol was held briefly for concern of further GI bleeding, however HR increased to 120s without further evidence of bleeding so metoprolol was restarted at 25mg TID just prior to trasnfer to medicine floor.
Last hospitalization several days prior to [**Month/Year (2) **] showed urine culture of ampicillin sensitive enterococcus.
Urine cultures here grew ~5000 yeast.
Infectious work-up was unrevealing.
Lumbar puncture was not done, as she had had a complication (hematoma) from an LP during a previous hospitalization, and findings of LP were very unlikely to change management.
Bedside EEG was done -showed generalized encephalopathy, but no seizure activity.
