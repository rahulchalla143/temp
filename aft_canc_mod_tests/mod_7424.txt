Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is again seen with atelectatic changes above it in the retrocardiac region.
BNP was elevated (29,000's), making clinical presentation most consistent with acute on chronic hear failure, and thus she was diuresed.
Subsequent CXR were unimpressive for an infectious cause.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and remained negative.
She remained stable from a respiratory standpoint with oxygen saturations in the high 90s% on room air.
# Atrial fibrillation: Heart rate noted to be elevated to 130s on night of admission.
She was found to have an INR of 1.4 that was subtherapeutic, we continued on her home dose coumadin given renal failure and concurrent antibiotics.
Electrolytes were trended daily and creatinine eventually trending back down to her baseline.
Creatinine was 1.6 on discharge.
Creatinine and electrolytes were trended daily.
Dilantin level checked and found to be within normal limits.
