She met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis > 12K, RR>20 and it was felt most likely to be a pulmonary source of infection.
She had subcutaneous nodule on her abdomen and elevated liver enzymes and was found to have a left hilar lung mass suspicious for a lung cancer primary on CT scan.
# Congestive Heart Failure:  She had some evidence of volume overload on exam and chest xray but was not diuresed due to likely septic shock.
She had a TTE on admission that showed a preserved EF but hypocontractile right ventricle with severe pulmonary hypertension.
# Anemia: On admission she had a hematocrit of 25 and was given 2 units PRBCs.
Her hematocrit subsequently remained stable.
