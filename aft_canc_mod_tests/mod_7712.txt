In the ED, initial VS were: HR 138, RR 28, 80% on RA.
CXR in ED revealed pneumonia on the right.
CXR on [**2161-1-23**] showed RLL infiltrates and he was treated with Levaquin for pneumonia.
CT c/a/p on [**2160-2-14**] at [**Location (un) 2274**] showed a 3.5 cm right infrahilar abnormal soft tissue density appearing necrotic  and with central cavity which extends along the pleural surface medially into the right middle lobe.
CT also showed a 4.9cm enlarged left adrenal gland compatible with metastatic lesion, possibly necrotic given its low density.
CTA and CT a/p at [**Hospital1 18**] did not show PE but emphysema.
CT also showed a cavitating pulmonary mass adjacent to the pericardium within the right medial lower lobe; Mediastinal and bihilar lymphadenopathy; an enlarged left adrenal gland.
MRI brain did not show brain lesions.
PET CT demonstrated FDG-avid lesions in the right lung, bilateral mediastinal LN's, left adrenal, right 11th rib and T-spine (T8, T11), all c/w with a primary lung cancer with metastatic disease.
He then underwent a bronchoscopy with EBUS with biopsy of 3 mediastinal LN's, with all 3 samples being non-diagnostic.
Thoracic Surgery was consulted to evaluate for possible VATS or mediastinoscopy, however, Thoracic  Surgery recommended to continue with less invasive measures first, and recommended a CT-guided biopsy of the left adrenal mass.
He underwent CT-guided biopsy on [**2-27**] and tolerated the procedure well.
No clear infiltrate on chest x-ray other than right-sided lung mass.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**2161-9-24**]:  1.
If there is no resolution, CTPA should be obtained for evaluation of the pulmonary arteries.
Evaluation of this region is limited without IV contrast and, unless contraindicated, future exams should be obtained with contrast.
CXR [**2161-9-23**]: IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe pneumonia with equivocal involvement of lower and middle lobes with small accompanying parapneumonic effusion.
Last MRI L spine showed possibility of leptomeningeal disease.
Counts are up from his previous values closer to chemo which were [**8-22**] when Hct was in low 30s.
