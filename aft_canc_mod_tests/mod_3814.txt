Cell marker analysis was attempted, but was non-diagnostic in this case due to insufficient numbers of B-cells for analysis.
Examination of cytospin preparation reveals collection of histiocytes, suggestive of granulomata along with increased eosinophils.
Spinal fluid [**11-12**] NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
============ Radiology ============ CT Head [**11-8**] No hemorrhage or fracture.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**11-9**] 1.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**11-10**] 1.
CT Head [**11-12**] 1.
CT Head [**11-13**] Status post right frontal lobe biopsy with interval increase in size of the ventricles and leftward midline shift.
CT Head [**11-14**] Interval effacement of the cerebral sulci, which could be related to debris deposited in the leptomeninges likely infectious in nature.
CT Head [**11-14**] CONCLUSION: Status post ventricular catheter placement with decompression of hydrocephalus.
============ Neurology ============ EEG [**11-10**] IMPRESSION: Abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of a slow background.
Given his change in mental status a non-contast CT was performed (details above).
Given evidence a non-communicated hydrocephalus, an LP was performed (details above) that has an opening pressure of 22cm on H20 and revealed an eosinophilic meningitis.
The patients mental status slowly [**Month/Year (2) **] and on the third day of admission the pt underwent a second LP, this time with an opening pressure of 11.
Following the LP and MRI of the brain was peformed (details above) that described numerous peri-ventricular lesions.
The pt underwent EEG revealing a toxic encephalopathy.
Monday the patient underwent a stat head CT and subsuently a third LP (Opening Pressure of 17).
The pt was sent for repeat stat Head CT and transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Subsequent CT scan demonsrated interval noncommunicating hydrocephalus with effacement of the sulci.
Neuro exam at that time was concerning for worsening CNS function.
Pupils were fixed and dilated, patient was minimally responsive to painful stiumuli and corneal reflexes were absent.
CSF was again consistent with eosinophilic meningitis.
Brain pathology was discussed at hem-pathology rounds, and was felt to be consistent with Hodgkin's of the CNS.
Culture data was negative (although brain biopsy showed GPC, this was reported as a contaminant).
UA and culture were negative .
# Anal Fissures: No evidence on exam for infection.
