MICROBIOLOGY: B-Glucan and galactomannan - negative Blood cultures (multiple) - no growth MRSA screen (x2) - negative Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture (x2) - negative and no growth Catheter tip cx (CVL)- no growth Throat culture - negative for b-strep Viral culture - no HSV growth Stool studies + C. diff - negative CMV VL - undetectable ................................................................
Based on a 500 cell Differential: 91% Blasts and Promonocytes, <1% Promyelocytes, <1% Myelocytes, <1% Metamyelocytes, 1% Bands/Neutrophils, 1% Lymphocytes, 2% Erythroid, 5% Monocytes.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation, and consists of fragmented trabecular bone, which appears osteopenic.
The marrow cellularity is 80-90% and comprised mainly of sheets of large cells with abundant cytoplasm, vesicular and folded nuclei, and prominent nucleoli.
Note: FISH was performed on a concurrent sample of neoplastic blood assessing for rearrangements of 15;17, 8;21, and 16q22.
The majority of the cells from this peripheral blood are located in the monocyte/promonocyte gate and express immature antigens, HLA-DR, myeloid associated antigens CD33, CD13 (dim), dim CD15, CD117 (subset), monocyte associated antigens CD14 (variable subset), CD11C, and CD64, as well as CD56 (subset), CD71 and the lymphoid associated antigens CD4, CD7.
Cells lack lineage specific B and T cell associated antigens, are CD10 (cALLa) negative, and are negative for CD34 and CD41.
The possibility of an underlying panniculitis cannot be fully assessed.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of fragments of trabecular bone that appears osteopenic, with an overall cellularity of <10%.
Cytogenetics: Tissue cultures were established to obtain cells for cytogenetic and FISH analyses.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Left ventricular systolic function is probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be excluded.
[**2179-2-9**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new right-sided double-lumen dialysis catheter and a new left internal jugular vein catheter.
[**2179-2-9**] U/S Bilateral LE Veins: 1.
[**2179-2-12**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: 1.
Hypodensities within the spleen as described, differential includes either infarctions or involvement with this patient's AML, unfortunately no prior studies to allow assessment for interval change.
Lung bases appear unchanged compared to the chest CT from one day earlier, including findings raising the suspicion of pulmonary infarctions.
[**2179-2-12**] CT NECK W/CONTRAST: Multiple enlarged lymph nodes compatible with history of AML.
She was found to have a leukocytosis of 194K concerning for acute leukemia, so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and was found to have AML.
# AML: Admission labs at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed WBC 185K with differential notable for 83% blasts.
Bone marrow biopsy from [**2179-2-8**] was consistent with AML M5 with NPM-1+ and Flt-3- cytogenetics.
TTE was normal.
She had a 3rd bone marrow biopsy on [**2179-3-18**] but results are pending at this time.
A CT chest was performed given her hypoxia, which showed PE with basilar infarcts.
Viral culture was ultimately negative.
She remained afebrile and all cultures were negative so the antibiotics were eventually stopped.
# Hypoxia/PE: She was initially diuresed with gentle IV furosemide boluses as her high respiratory rate and CXR findings were felt secondary to fluid overload given aggressive hydration as part of chemo.
She had negative bilateral LE dopplers and a CT of the neck and CT abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of venous thrombosis peripherally or in the more central veins.
# Anemia/Thrombocytopenia/Menorrhagia: Initial platelet count was 103 but she became profoundly thrombocytopenic after initiation of chemotherapy.
Blood bank was consulted who recommended infusion of only O+ platelets.
GYN was consulted and a transvaginal U/S showed multiple fibroids and a hypervascular endometrium.
They deferred endometrial biopsy due to her neutropenia, and deferred hormonal therapies given the prothrombotic risks in someone with a PE.
C. diff toxins, C. diff PCR, and stool studies were negative throughout hospitalization.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine peaked at 2.7 and the nephrology service was consulted.
Urine sediment showed muddy brown casts, consistent with ATN, but urine electrolytes were more consistent with contrast-induced nephropathy vs. pre-renal etiology.
Her creatinine began to improve markedly and trended toward baseline as her condition improved.
Discharge creatinine was 1.0. .
Admission glucose was 256 and subsequent blood glucoses were significantly elevated.
She was briefly started on glyburide [**Hospital1 **], but due to poor appetite and PO intake, her blood sugars were low and the glyburide and insulin was stopped.
She will require close follow up and blood sugar monitoring once her appetite improves and she is eating regularly.
# Pending Results: bone marrow biopsy from [**3-18**] .
Secondary diagnoses: - Pulmonary emboli - Acute kidney injury - Diabetes mellitus - Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Lab testing and a bone marrow biopsy showed that you have leukemia which was treated with chemotherapy.
Your blood sugars have been high suggesting that you likely have diabetes.
We started the following medications: - Acyclovir for your leukemia - Fluconazole for your leukemia - Metoprolol for your blood pressure - Prochlorperazine for your nausea  Followup Instructions: Department: BMT/ONCOLOGY UNIT When: SATURDAY [**2179-3-20**] at 8:30 AM [**Telephone/Fax (1) 447**] Building: Fd [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] Building ([**Hospital Ward Name 1826**]/[**Hospital Ward Name 1827**] Complex) [**Location (un) 3971**] Campus: EAST Best Parking: Main Garage .
