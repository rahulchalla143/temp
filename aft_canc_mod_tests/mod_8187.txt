Interphase FISH assays were most consistent with the presence of a tetraploid or near-tetraploid clone.
Interphase FISH did not detect a BCR-ABL1 rearrangement or an MLL rearrangement.
[**2107-10-4**] CSF Cytology NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
FISH DETAILS: FISH evaluation for a BCR-ABL (BCR-ABL1) rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the  LSI BCR/ABL Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for BCR at 22q.11.2 and ABL at 9q34, and is interpreted as normal.

Patient's anemia and pancytopenia were profound, and while in the ICU, he received pRBC to maintain a HCT > 21 and platelets to maintain platelets >50 given recent retinal hemorrhages.
An echocardiogram was normal.
Platelets were maintained > 30,000, fibrinogen > 100,000, and HCT > 21 with transfusions.
ATIII levels were checked weekly to ensure activity > 30%.
At the end of the induction cycle, patient had a repeat bone marrow biopsy to determine whether he is in complete remission.
A blood culture from his PICC line (one bottle) grew GNR's at 83 hours.
His ulcers were swabbed and were negative for HSV.
Hyponatremia: Patient's labs were consistent with SIADH, which was most likely secondary to vincristine or MTX.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Complete Ertapenem (through [**10-21**]) - Follow-up final bone marrow results to assess for complete remission - New PCN allergy (rash while on Zosyn)  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Information was obtained from PatientFamily/Caregiver.
Ibuprofen 400 mg PO Q8H:PRN pain 2.
Your blood counts have also gotten better.
