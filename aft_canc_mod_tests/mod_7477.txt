VS prior to ER transfer was 130/70, HR 86, pOx 99 % on RA.
CXR was unchanged from prior.
ECG showed deep T-wave depressions in lateral leads.
CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality and known lung mass.
He had left hip and left rib Xray which did not show fractures but a 5cm LUL lung mass.
CT on [**2198-1-2**] showed a spiculated 5.5x5.1cm mass within the apical posterior segment with encasement of the left upper lobe pulmonary artery.
No evidence of significant mediastinal adenopathy but extensive coronary arterial calcification on CT scan.
[**2198-2-26**] EBUS biopsy of LUL lung mass showed squamous cell lung carcinoma.

However, on the current examination the lingular bronchus is also encased and occluded which is new.
Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates calcified and noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque involving the aorta and the visualized branching vessels.
[**2198-3-23**] ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is well preserved (LVEF 60%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**2198-3-22**] CARDIAC CATH 1.
The LCX mid 80%, 100% distal (filling via left to left collaterals).
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated systemic arterial pressures at the central aortic level 158/58 mmHg.
CTA performed on [**3-25**] showed no evidence of PE.
A CTA repeated yesterday shows interval enlargement of lung cancer, with possible adrenal met and compression of pulmonary arteries as well.
# Benign prostatic hypertrophy with obstruction A foley was placed earlier in [**Month (only) 958**] due to obstruction after lung biopsy was performed.
You also had a CT scan to evaluate your lungs.
