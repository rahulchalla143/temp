His valproic acid level was 95.
KCl 20 mEq p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature was 96.4 F.  Pulse was 58.
Blood pressure was 120/60.
Respiration was 18.
Saturation was at 98% on room air.
Deep tendon reflexes were decreased throughout and flexor plantar responses bilaterally.
LABORATORIES FROM THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White count of 2.8, 65 neutrophils, 7 bands, 2 lymphocytes, 5 atypical lymphocytes, 2 metamyelocytes, and 9 eosinophils.
Hematocrit 29.5, platelets 70.
Sodium 139, potassium 4.3, chloride 100, bicarb 29, BUN 19, creatinine 1.3, glucose 86, calcium 8, magnesium 1.4, albumin 2.9, AST 29, ALT 28, alkaline phosphatase 55, and total bilirubin less than 0.5.
Blood cultures x 2 were negative growth to date.
A head CT showed small areas of hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe, which is likely consistent with residual lymphoma.
An EEG was obtained, which showed nearly persistent polymorphic theta frequency slowing seen over the left frontal and temporal lobes.
A repeat EEG was obtained the following day.
A MRI of the head was obtained, which was abnormal on FLAIR.
Lumbar puncture was obtained.
CSF was remarkable for a white count of 1, no red blood cells, protein of 91, glucose of 41, and LDH of 30.
CSF cytology was pending at the time of dictation as was beta-2 microglobulin.
Gram stain was negative.
Sepsis workup was undertaken with the LP negative for acute infectious process.
A swallowing study was obtained.
Patient had a tremor, which was thought to be secondary to high levels of valproic acid.
(2) Metastatic CNS lymphoma:  Due to the MRI and CSF profile provided evidence for disease progression, a staging CT of the torso was done, which showed the patient had a right sided pulmonary embolism.
PTT was maintained in the 80 to 100 range.
Heparin drip was discontinued 24 hours prior to discharge after the patient's INR was therapeutic.
A sodium was stable for several days prior to discharge.
(5) Oncology/systemic lymphoma:  CT of the torso did not show significant progression of the disease.
His white count decreased over the next few days.
The patient has cutaneous manifestations of his lymphoma with red blotchy areas on his back, right pelvis, and arm, which seem to come and go.
