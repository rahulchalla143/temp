An EGD performed during that admission did not reveal a source of bleeding, and a capsule study was attempted but terminated early secondary to equipment malfunction.
She reports "feeling anemic," as she has in the past when her hematocrit is low.
She reports pain in the center of her stomach which is [**2-22**], "small zaps" and like "champagne bubbles."
Physical exam was significant for black guaiac positive stool.
Her labs were significant for Hct 18 (discharge Hct 31), WBC 11.3, creatinine 0.6.
She refused an NG lavage.
Vitals on transfer were significant for BP 132/75 HR 90s.
On arrival to the ICU, vital signs were T 100.4, HR 105, BP 124/78, RR 16, 100% on RA.

During last admission, no source was located in the upper GI system, however capsule study was not performed.
As recent EGD was negative and patient has no risk factors for UGIB (no NSAID use, infrequent alcohol use), low suspicion for esophageal or gastric source.
Initially planned repeat EGD, but patient preferred less invasive study given recent negative EGD.
Therefore, a tagged RBC scan was performed, which showed slow bleed in the distal jejunum/proximal ileum.
She was transfused 2 uPRBCs pre-operatively for a Hct of 20.2.
Her post-op hematocrit was 27.5.
Patient required 2UPRBCs at the time of admission and hematocrit responded appropriately.
Hemolysis labs were negative and reticulocyte count was appropriate.
GIB workup as below.
Post-operatively, she had no bleeding and her hematocrits were stable until discharge.
