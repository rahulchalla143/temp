Soft tissue attenuation conglomeration in the pancreaticojejunostomy bed is not as well evaluated on the current study but is not significantly changed and likely represents loops of jejunum.
Peribronchovascular ground glass opacities may represent infection, inflammation and less likely edema.
During the case there was some concern about her oxygenation particularly in the early portion of the operation where she required 100% oxygen saturation in order to maintain a appropriate saturation rate level.
There is no evidence of any pneumothorax, and she had a bronchoscopy in the case which was nonrevealing.
