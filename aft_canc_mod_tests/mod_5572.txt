[**First Name (STitle) **] R. [**Doctor Last Name **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 35% to 39% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: 2.4 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: mid anterior - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; apex - hypo;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
LVEF now 45%.
RV systolic function is normal with normal RV apical wall motion.
LV diastolic function is improved post bypass on inotropes.
[**Location (un) **] PHYSICIAN:     Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 449**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2183-6-11**] for a cardiac catheterization.
A carotid duplex ultrasound was obtained which showed a 40-59% right internal carotid artery stenosis and a less than 40% left internal carotid artery stenosis.
A liver biopsy was obtained which showed changes that were consistent with chronic viral hepatitis with grade 2 inflammation/activity and stage 3-4 fibrosis.
An ultrasound of her abdomen was obtained which showed  a coarse liver with no change in a hyperechoic lesion in the right lobe of liver which may represent a granuloma or a scar from previous trauma.
A CT scan was obtained and showed no significant abnormalities or changes.
A colonoscopy and upper endoscopy were performed which showed gastritis and diverticuli.
A biopsy was obtained which showed an adenoma which will need to be addressed following her heart surgery.
After her white blood cell count returned to [**Location 213**], she was cleared for surgery.
