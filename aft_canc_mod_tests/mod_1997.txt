In the ED he was noted to be hemodynamically stable with pulse 55, BP 127/67.
Initial hct was 31.1 from 38.6 on the prior day when he was seen in the ED for dizziness.
He underwent tagged red cell scan which revealed a colonic bleeding source at the hepatic flexure.
He was taken for colonoscopy which showed severe diverticulosis but no active bleeding.
He was scheduled to have a repaeat conlonscopy on [**3-10**] for a polypectomy.
He had one more episode of a small volume of BRB after his colonoscopy, but not large enough to pursue repeat angiography.
Given his risk factors for TIA and stroke, he likely should be restarted on his plavix if his HCT remains stable after one week post repeat colonoscopy.
He was discharged to home with VNA services for HR, BP, and HCT check, to be followed up by his PCP.
