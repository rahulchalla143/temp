pCXR [**2151-3-17**] 5:01am: FINDINGS: No prior comparisons.
pCXR [**2151-3-17**].
ETT 4 cm above the carina with NG tube advancement into the stomach.
EEG [**2151-3-18**]: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
Trans-thoracic echocardiogram [**2151-3-18**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
pCXR [**2151-3-19**]: Mild left lower perihilar opacification has improved, probably resolving edema.
pCXR [**2151-3-20**]: Increasing opacification of the lungs could be due to mild pulmonary edema and multiple micrometastases, worsened slightly since [**3-19**] at 10:57 p.m. Heart size is normal.

WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary):       Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from the       site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus       aureus and beta streptococcus).
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2151-3-18**]):       [**9-9**] PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2151-3-20**]):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2151-3-20**]):       >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
[**3-20**]- Catheter tip (IV): WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2151-3-21**]):    No significant growth  Brief Hospital Course: 30 yo F with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary who presented to OSH [**3-1**] with pseudomonal urosepsis, vaginal bleeding from tumor extension/anti-coagulation.
# Neurologic - The patient was seen by the Neurology consult service and underwent MRI head which revealed lesions suspicious for metastases, possible hemorrhages, and findings consistent with hypoxic brain injury.
EEG was performed and revealed encephalopathy.
The patient's neurologic exam (performed after sedation removed >48 hours) revealed intact brainstem function without evidence of higher cortical activity.
She had some metabolic abnormalities which were corrected  (hypernatremia, hyperphosphatemia), but neurologic exam was unchanged.
CXR [**3-17**] revealed ?
Insulin Regular Human 100 unit/mL Solution Sig: 2-10 units Injection ASDIR (AS DIRECTED): per sliding scale for blood sugars > 150mg/dl.
Midazolam 1 mg/mL Solution Sig: 1-2 mg Injection Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for comfort.
Pseudomonal sepsis, completed antibiotic course 4.
Your antibiotics were stopped [**2151-3-21**] (Vancomycin 1000mg q24 and Aztreonam 1000mg q8) as your micorbiology data has been negative and your course for pseudomonal sepsis has been completed.
If you continue to have fevers, blood cultures should be repeated.
