Of note, the patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy in [**2183-5-21**], for workup of melanotic stools that demonstrated prior peptic ulcer disease, diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and polyps in the rectum and hepatic flexure.
The gastrointestinal workup was after two cycles of Gemcitabine and Cisplatin which were stopped for the gastrointestinal evaluation.
Occult gastrointestinal bleed [**2183-5-21**], status post esophagogastroduodenoscopy [**2183-6-7**], and colonoscopy [**2183-6-17**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, temperature is 99.3, heart rate 94, blood pressure 134/47, respiratory rate 25, and oxygen saturation 99% in room air.
Head and neck examination - pale sclera.
Jugular venous pressure to midneck.
Cardiac examination - regular rate and rhythm, II/IV crescendo decrescendo midpeaking murmur at the right upper sternal border radiating to the carotids and a II/IV holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla with laterally displaced point of maximal impulse.
Pulmonary examination - bilaterally expiratory wheezes with no crackles.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was 2.9, hematocrit 13.0 and platelets 51,000, MCV 94.
Sodium 140, potassium 3.2, chloride 107, bicarbonate 23, blood urea nitrogen 38, creatinine 1.1 and glucose 141.
Complete blood count differential 31 neutrophils, 3 bands, 53 lymphocytes.
Prior studies on [**2183-6-10**], esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a normal esophagus and normal duodenum.
The colonoscopy dated on [**2183-6-17**], showed diverticulosis of the sigmoid, polyps in the rectum and polyps in the hepatic flexure.
Electrocardiogram done on [**2183-7-13**], showed normal sinus rhythm, 95 beats per minute, normal axis and normal intervals.
[**Street Address(2) 2811**] depression in V3 through V6.
Chest x-ray on [**2183-7-13**], showed no infiltrates and no heart failure.
He was transfused a total of seven units with his hematocrit stabilizing in the low 30s.
CT of the abdomen was reported as negative for metastatic disease.
The vital signs were unchanged.
Electrocardiogram at that time showed normal sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute, normal intervals, normal axis, V4 to V6 with normalization of ST as compared to admission electrocardiogram which showed 2.
[**Street Address(2) 2811**] depression in V1 to V6; otherwise was unchanged.
His cardiac panel at that time showed a CK of 97, followed by 132, 128, CK MB 12 and then 10, CK MB index 9.1 and then 7.8 and troponin of 15.0 and 15.8.
An echocardiogram was done which showed the left atrium mildly dilated with left ventricular cavity normal.
Overall left ventricular function was mildly depressed with posterior hypokinesis.
The patient had thrombocytopenia with platelets on presentation of 51,000.
During this point, his hematocrit was 30.8, platelets were 151,000.
The patient had no further gastrointestinal events and no further cardiac events and was ready for discharge, however, the patient then spiked a temperature and was found to be neutropenic with white blood cell count of 1.1 and absolute neutrophil count of 350.
The patient also had some crackles on the left lower base during lung examination and was given a chest x-ray which showed left lower lobe consolidation possibly consistent with atelectasis or infiltrate.
The white blood cell count increased gradually from 1.1 to 4.3 and then to 8.5.
His neutrophil count came up from 350 to [**2129**] and then 5320 after doses of GCSF.
The patient was considered to be stable for discharge and was discharged on [**2183-7-20**], with follow-up recommended on [**2183-7-21**], with his outpatient oncologist in order to get a blood draw to check for his current ANC and white blood cell count levels with possibility of needing another injection of GCSF.
