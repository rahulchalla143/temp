She developed a temperature to 100.5 after one unit of blood transfusion.
She was followed expectantly with stable asymptomatic disease -[**9-/2170**] she developed back pain, anemia and an IgG level to the mid 3000 range.
Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated approximately 40-50% plasma cellularity.
MRI revealed an expansile lesion in the left iliac crest.
-[**2-/2173**], she was noted to have a rising IgG level with progressive bone pain -bone marrow biopsy performed in [**4-/2173**] showed 90% plasma cell cellularity with amyloidosis by [**Country 7018**] red staining comprising approximately 40% of the marrow core.
Denies significant tobacco use - smoked about [**2-7**] ppd x2-3 years, quit 20y ago.

[**12-27**]: CT sinus-IMPRESSION: 1.
Features consistent with invasive fungal sinusitis involving primarily the bilateral ethmoid sinuses and the nasal cavity, which are filled with presumably necrotic non-enhancing material, and extension into and post- septal involvement of the medial aspect of the right orbit.
There is extensive opacification of the paranasal sinuses with minimal aeration of the sphenoid sinus, the maxillary sinuses, and up to the ethmoid air cells as seen on the CT from [**2-15**].
[**3-4**] CT chest: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**3-5**] CT chest: IMPRESSION: 1.
ENT evaluation revealed necrotic turbinate and microbiology and pathology preliminary evaluations demonstrated hyphae.
A sinus CT on [**1-24**] showed worsening disease.
Serial CT sinus and MRI orbit/head showed continued sinus infection, but no significant bony erosion on posaconazole and ambisome combination therapy.
Last bone marrow showed 95-100% plasma cells with amyloid.
On [**2175-2-10**], pt remained neutropenic on G-CSF, repeat bone marrow biopsy done, appears that marrow remains fibrotic with collagen deposition, not nearly as cellular as previous marrow.
On [**3-1**]- repeat MRI sinus/orbit with marked distention of L nasolacrimal duct and continued extensive sinus disease, but no extensive bony erosion, pt decided to continue with BMT.
However, in prep for BMT on [**2175-3-4**], pt developed hemothorax [**3-10**] right sublavian central line placement and was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] ([**3-5**]).
# Pseudomonal pneumonia: Had pseudomonas on sputum culture from [**4-22**].
Blood cultures positive from [**4-18**] showing enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin.
Cath tip from A line grew coag negative staph but PICC/CVL cath tip cultures negative.
Altered MS: Previous work-up negative, including MRI with no parenchymal involvement of mucor, HSV-6 negative, HSV 1,2 negative from CSF.
Head CT [**4-3**] negative.
Previous meds thought to potentially be related are gancyclovir and acyclovir which were d/c'd without much improvement.
Continued to transfuse for HCT >25, PLT >10.
