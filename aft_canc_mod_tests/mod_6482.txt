She was seen in the [**Hospital 3242**] clinic for evaluation and initial vitals were BP 89/58 HR 105 T 99.6.
She was given 1 liter NS, had blood cultures drawn, and she was given 2 grams of cefepime.
Her blood pressures remained 90s/50s in the outpatient clinic and the patient was transferred to the ED for evaluation.
CXR demonstrated bilatral consolidations consistent with pneumonitis.
She was given an additional 1 liter bolus with improvement in her BP to 110s.
Her BP was 99/60 at transfer.
Her oxygenation improved to 95% on 5L NC at the time of transfer.
She was briefly on a nonrebreather, but other than the [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 1131**], no oxygen saturation values under 92% were recorded.
CT-guided biopsy showed plasmacytoma.
Work-up at the time revealed a modest IgG kappa and a question of light chain in the urine.
She had a bone bone marrow biopsy, which showed 10% plasma cells with abundance of kappa staining and evidence of plasma cell aggregates and plasmablast.
The patient underwent a repeat skeletal survey, which showed new punched out lesions in  the skull as well as a calcium of ~10.4-10.9.
At [**Hospital1 18**], bone marrow biopsy showed plasma cells accounting for approximately 20% of the cells with kappa restriction.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2114-5-22**]: Asymmetric edema versus multifocal pneumonia.
CT CHEST [**2114-5-24**]: 1.
Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient Based on clinical symptoms and CXR were consitent with a multifocal PNA.
Hypotension - Patient had brief episode of hypotension to SBP 88, otherwise ranged from 90-100.
You will need follow up imaging in the form of a chest x-ray in [**6-29**] days and a CT scan of the Chest in 4 weeks.
Followup Instructions: Please call to schedule an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9572**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3236**] on Thursday, [**5-31**].
