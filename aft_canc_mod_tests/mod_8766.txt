No findings to explain hematocrit decrease.
Subpleural interstitial changes are noted and are most likely consistent with chronic interstitial changes rather than acute infection, and as was mentioned, improved compared to the prior images.
Hip X-ray [**2128-3-8**]: IMPRESSION: Fixation of right femoral subcapital fracture with unchanged alignment.
Her heparin was reversed with IV protamine, a STAT CT Abd/Pelvis was obtained, and she was transferred to the ICU for ongoing care.
CT scans were without evidence of any significant bleed.
Hemolysis labs were sent, with very low haptoglobin, elevated LDH.
Her H/H and haptoglobin levels were followed, which continued to improve and stabilize.
Once her HCT was reasonably stable, but she was noted to have a slight decline in her hematocrit in the setting of dark guaiac positive stools.
The patient underwent EGD and colonscopy several days after initiation of a PPI that revealed a large duodenal ulcer that was likely the source of bleeding.
H pylori serology was sent and was ultimately negative.
Her urine grew Enterobacter and Enterococcus.
Her repeat urine culture was negative.
WBC improved by the time of discharge.
