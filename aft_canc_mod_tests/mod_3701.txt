He underwent biopsy of L main bronchus which showed espohageal adenocarcinoma along the wall.
One day PTA patient CXR showed opacification of L chest and had bronch on [**2112-3-3**] which showed LMS obstruction.
Past Medical History: Prostate Ca s/p XRT (dx 10 years ago) Esophageal Adenocarcinoma s/p Ivor-[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 72182**] [**4-12**] with recurrence [**2110**] s/p chemo ([**2112-2-4**]) GERD  Social History: Lives with family; vacuum system mechanic, + etoh use (4 cans/day); + tobacco history quit in [**2096**]; 25 pack/year history;  Family History: unable to obtain (intubated/sedated)  Physical Exam: T 98.6 BP 88/44 (on 0.10 levophed) HR 78 O2Sat 90% Vent AC Tv 430 FiO2 100% PEEP 15 RR 28 7.38/42/181 Gen: Patient intubated and sedated Heent: ETT tube in place with OG tube Neck: no bruit; +2 carotid Lungs: Bronchial Breath sounds ant/lat Cardiac: RRR S1/S2 no murmurs Abd: soft, midline scar Ext: no edema Neuro: sedated  Pertinent Results: Bedside TTE ([**2112-3-4**]): There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with septal, anterior and apical akinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
Cardiac cath ([**2112-3-4**]): Bronchoscopy w/ biopsy ([**2112-3-4**]):  [**2112-3-8**]: ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Pt O2Sat dropped to 70-80s and he was intubated.
A CXR was obtained which was consistent with b/l pulmonary edema.
An emergent TTE was done which showed severe LV systolic dysfunction with LVEF < 20%, no tamponade, perserved RV systolic function.
Swan was placed and hemodynamics showed PAP 45/30 Ci 1.1 CO 1.5-2.0 and SVO2 55-60.
He was maintained on norepinephrine and dobutamine drips overnight to maintain his BP in the setting of his cardiogenic shock.
repaet echo was done which showed improved EF 40-45%.
