Chest CT with Methylene Blue via chest tube showed a mediastinal leak.
On postoperative day #10 repeat CT scan showed gross extravasation of contrast with apparent anastomotic collection and a large right pleural effusion.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further care.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white cell count 10.9, hematocrit 25.8, platelet count 230,000, sodium 144, potassium 4.6, chloride 109, CO2 25, BUN 44, creatinine 1.7.
He underwent a CT of the chest and a CT fluoroscopy guided NG tube placement.
On CT chest the findings were a right lower lobe collapse, two small anastomotic leaks decompressed by chest tube.
He also underwent a bronchoscopy which showed mucus plugs and was otherwise normal.
He was noted to have elevated LFTs on the initial lab work with a total bilirubin of 11.9 and also raised BUN and creatinine.
He also underwent a right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed minimal edema in the gallbladder wall and a small amount of fluid around the gallbladder consistent with ascites.
He underwent another chest CT at this time which showed a small amount of fluid at the area of the previously seen anastomotic leak.
The CT also showed persistent ground glass opacities scattered throughout both lungs.
His total bilirubin had gone down to 10 and the creatinine was 1.4 and urea 27.
Post extubation he was noted to be tachypneic with a respiratory rate between 28 and 45.
On [**7-7**] his right chest tube was accidentally pulled and it was replaced under sterile condition.
He continued to have diarrhea and his fluid was sent for C. diff.
On the morning of [**7-12**] it was noted that he was somnolent and his chest exam showed he was wheezing.
He also underwent a CT angiogram to rule out PE and contrast was given to evaluate for a leak.
The CT also showed small bilateral pleural effusions with a loculated component at the right upper lobe posteriorly.
A laryngoscopy at this time revealed no evidence of upper airway obstruction.
Blood culture, aerobic and anaerobic bottle, no growth.
[**7-1**]:  Bronchial washings, gram stain 3+, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 4+ gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
Culture showed staph aureus coag positive, Oxacillin resistant, also sparse growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
[**7-3**]:  Urine culture negative.
Sputum [**7-3**], gram stain more than 25 PMN's, 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
Culture positive for staph aureus coagulase positive.
Blood culture [**7-3**], no growth.
