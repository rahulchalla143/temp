She was scheduled for elective tracheostomy on [**2101-4-25**] after a CT chest on [**2101-4-21**] demonstrated a probable mass involving the larynx on the left.
Her son called EMS, and an oxygen saturation was noted to be 89%.
The oxygen saturation was 100% on nonrebreather mask after suctioning and nebulizers.
PHYSICAL EXAM AT ADMISSION:  Temperature 94.6, heart rate 102 and regular, blood pressure 188/67, respiratory rate 20, satting 100% on a 10 liter face mask.
PULMONARY:  Hoarse voice and stridor on inspiration, fair air movement, clear to auscultation posteriorly in all lung fields.
INITIAL DATA:  White blood cell count 21.2, with 82% neutrophils, 9% bands, 6% lymphocytes, hematocrit 32.1, platelets 401.
Chest x-ray demonstrates consolidation of the left lower lobe, likely aspiration pneumonia, also with overinflation, flat diaphragms, consistent with emphysema.
EKG - sinus rhythm at 108 beats per minute, axis normal, QT segment mildly prolonged, specific number no[**Serial Number 29325**], poor R wave progression in V1 through V3, slight ST segment depressions of less than 1 mm in the inferior leads.
CT scan without contrast demonstrates probable mass involving the larynx in the left, low attenuation within the isthmus and left lobe of the thyroid gland, severe atherosclerotic disease with occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, and stenosis of the right internal carotid artery with mural thrombus within the proximal descending aorta, emphysema, tiny noncalcified nodule in the right lower lobe of the lung, multiple cysts within both kidneys which cannot fully be characterized on this study.
CT neck with IV contrast - low attention within the left and right lobes of the thyroid, slightly prominent, slight irregularity of the mucosa inferior to the anterior commissure on the left and the right posteriorly at the level of the false cords, unusual calcification in the right cricoid cartilage suggestive of prior injury.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE - 1) AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION:  The ENT service was consulted and given the patient's declining oxygen saturation and extensive involvement of her squamous cell CA of the left pharynx, it was their impression that she would require placement of a tracheostomy tube.
A genetic probe was sent to the [**State 350**] State Lab for further DNA analysis by direct probe.
PPD was placed and read as 5 mm which would be negative in this patient for whom a threshold of 10 mm was set, given her history of malignancy.
A BAL was performed on [**2101-4-26**], and the BAL demonstrated moderate growth of oropharyngeal flora, but coag-positive Staph aureus that was sensitive to oxacillin.
This should be continued for a 14-day course, given the patient's slight increase in progression on chest x-ray of [**2101-5-3**], and underlying risk factor for complicated pneumonia.
However, given the patient's current goals of care and lack of therapeutic significance, no further work-up will be recommended at this time.
5) ABDOMINAL PAIN:  Her abdominal pain was chronic and well controlled with liquid percocet, as well as DTO.
An abdominal ultrasound was performed which was negative for any evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
She was started on metoprolol which was gradually titrated up until adequate blood pressure and heart rate control were achieved at a dose of 37.5 mg po bid.
Flush with 60 cc of water q 8 h.  Initially, there was some concern for drainage around the ostomy site.
The ostomy nurses were consulted and did change the dressing, and also placed a stoma cap at the skin site to prevent leakage--please see above for further recommendations regarding follow-up with the surgeon who initially placed this G-tube for possible revision.
These include resuscitation, CPR, intubation, pressors, prolonged antibiotics, any painful procedures which include any revisions of the tracheostomy.
