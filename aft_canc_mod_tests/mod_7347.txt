Her initial serum glucose was 900 and she was started on an insulin drip.
A CT scan was done which showed pancreatic stranding around the head and gallbladder sludge.
AN ECG was note to have some QRS widening (120) comparred to prior (100)  Upon review of previous notes in OMR, the patient intermitantly threatens noncompliance with her insulin therapy and has a length history of impulse control problems, for which she sees psychiatry.

[**11-18**] CT Spine - IMPRESSION: 1.
Intubated patient, with the tip of endotracheal tube projecting 1 cm from the level of the carina, this should be withdrawn for appropriate positioning vs re-evaluated with chest radiograph.
[**11-18**] CT Head - IMPRESSION: 1.
Air-fluid levels within multiple paranasal sinuses.
[**11-18**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis - IMPRESSION: 1.
[**11-19**] ECHO - IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal regional and global systolic function.
[**12-1**] Endoscopy - Impression: (dilation, biopsy) Abnormal mucosa in the lower third of the esophagus (biopsy) Blood in the fundus Polyp in the fundus (polypectomy)Granularity and friability with shallow ulceration in the duodenal bulb (biopsy)Medium hiatal hernia Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum     Brief Hospital Course: 60F with lengthy psychiatric history with impulse control and difficult to control t2DM, now presenting with hypothermia, extreme hyperglycemia, and severe metabolic acidosis.
Initial thought was given to emergent dialysis, but the acidosis corrected with fluid boluses of D5-1/2NS + 3 amps of bicarbonate.
Toxicology screens and cultures were unrevealing in finding a cause for her extreme acidosis.
Sputum cultures grew out MRSA.
Her leukocytosis has waxed and waned, with peak on admission of 30 and a nadir of 5.5.
# Acute kidney injury: The first few days of her admission saw an acute rise in her creatinine from baseline and oliguria to anuria.
After her initial insulin resistance with high-dose insulin drip, her blood glucose seemed to be better controlled with close monitoring.
GI bleed was treated initially with IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], but this was felt to be less likely and hematocrit were trended and stable.
# CT findings - Pancreatic stranding and gallbladder sludge: Non-specific finding with normal lipase.
