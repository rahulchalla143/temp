Follow-up marrow results done to show if there was appropriate recovery of the bone marrow were still pending, though clinical picture suggested that the normal cells have returned; though, the question as to whether there are additional leukemoid cells has not yet been determined.
The patient received multiple platelet and blood transfusions as supportive treatment for his ablative process as associated with his chemotherapy.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient's primary issue was that he developed a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis infection in his blood which showed positive growth from [**4-21**] through [**4-25**]; thus, five days.
From [**4-26**] through [**4-29**], all cultures were subsequently negative.
The patient will undergo 14 days of therapy of Synercid, dating from the point at which he was found to have negative blood cultures on [**Month (only) 116**], so that he will have his last day of Synercid (as mentioned before of 600 mg intravenously q.8h.)
It should be noted that stool culture also showed vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis; however, his catheter tip remained negative.
Fungal cultures were negative.
The patient was Clostridium difficile negative, and he did not have any vegetations founds on his heart valves by both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms; making us confident that he did not have endocarditis.
