His course was complicated by a DVT and PE at the time of his diagnosis, and he was on anticoagulation particularly while receiving thalidomide and Decadron.
In [**Month (only) 547**]/05, he was noted to have a drop in his white blood count, and repeat bone marrow biopsy showed increasing plasma cells with 20% involvement.
Following this therapy, he had increasing pain with increasing IgG levels and SPEP with a poor response to therapy, he was switched to treatment with Velcade and Decadron.
A repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy revealed CD138 staining of plasma cells for approximately 10% of the cellularity.
Followup evaluation of his disease at 2 months post-transplant at the end of [**10/2115**] showed approximately 10% involvement by plasma cells by CD138 staining.
An x-ray of the area did not show any evidence for fracture or lesion.
He did undergo an MRI as well, which showed a lesion near the groin area with no pathologic fracture.
He had been requiring increasing platelet transfusion support prior to beginning Velcade as well as during the course of Velcade with a platelet count less than 20,000 as well as red blood cell transfusion support, his IgG level had increased to 7 g with his SPEP now representing 50% or 4900 mg/dL of the total protein.
He does coach a girls basketball team and tries to keep active although since his most recent admission, he has not been keeping up with this.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-5-22**], left ventricular systolic function now appears slightly more vigorous.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2116-6-2**] no significant diagnostic change.
[**6-13**] CT CAP: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-6-2**], there is no significant change.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade, although there is brief right atrial diastolic invagination.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-6-14**], the loculated pericardial effusion appears somewhat larger.
Opacity in right lower lobe, which may be due to atelectasis, however, the evaluation is somewhat limited on this portable exam.
[**2116-6-18**]: CT CHEST BEFORE AND AFTER CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: 1.
Otherwise, no significant interval change since examination of [**2116-6-13**]  [**2116-6-19**]: CHEST AP: IMPRESSION: Stable pulmonary edema.
[**2116-6-22**]: CXR - Interstitial edema has cleared though pulmonary vascular redistribution persists.
[**2116-6-28**] Right Upper extremity ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of left upper extremity DVT.
[**2116-6-28**] CXR: FINDINGS: Comparison is made to prior study from [**2116-6-23**].
There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity and bilateral pleural effusion, which are stable.
[**2116-7-1**] CXR UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: A left PICC is present with tip in the distal SVC.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-6-18**], there is no significant change.
[**7-20**] MRI of C-spine and T-spine: CONCLUSION: T11 vertebral body collapse, unchanged since [**3-22**], [**2116**].
[**7-21**] CT Chest w/o contrast: IMPRESSION:  1.
On [**6-7**] blood cultures grew MRSA.
He had a chest x-ray and CT scan that demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Platelets were transfused to keep > 50 prior to procedure.
Ultrasound was performed on the right side and effusion was seen.
A chest x-ray was performed and demonstrated new right pleural effusion.
His hematocrit had decreased to 15 (approx 8 point decrease) and concern for hemothorax.
A contrast CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis was performed.
Given concern for contrast administration in patient with Multiple Myeloma, he was given 4 doses of mucomyst immediately following the CT scans.
His LFTS were noted to be increasing, and especially his Bilirubin (direct bilirubinemia).
His weight had not been increasing, though.
An ultrasound with dopplers was performed on [**6-20**] and was normal with normal blood flow.
He continued to have serosanguinous drainage from chest tube site while he was neutropenic, but this stopped when his blood counts started rising.
An ABG on the BMT floor showed hypercarbia (ABG: 7.27/58/89/28) with stable vital signs and a PE notable for poor respiratory excursion.
He was given 125mg Solumedrol and 1U plts/1U blood were transfused.
His MS appeared to have improved.
It was felt that his hypercarbic resp failure was due to DAH, and he received He was noted to develop ARF with his Cr rising to 2.0 from 1.0 over the span of a few days.
It was thought that this was likely iatrogenic in nature rather than prerenal azotemia as he was fluid overloaded on exam, with nml vital signs and urine lytes c/w ATN.
His acyclovir was held and his CSA dose was decreased to prevent further nephrotoxicity.
His oxygen requirements continued to go up such that he was on 100% FiO2 and was satting in the low 90s and was persistently tachypneic in the 30s-40s.
On the night of [**7-25**], in light of increasing oxygen requirements/decreasing sats and upon consultation with the BMT team and his wife, the decision was made to withdraw life support due to dismal prognosis and his wife's feeling that he had fought and suffered long enough.
He was maintained on his Acyclovir ppx until his creatinine rose to 1.8, and this was held.
