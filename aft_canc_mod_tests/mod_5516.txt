She called 911 and he was brought by EMS to [**Hospital3 10310**] Hospital, where his blood pressure was 212/111 with hr 102, and where his exam was documented as revealing equal pupils, "unresponsive," and right sided weakness (unclear how much the weakness represented a change from his baseline neurologic exam).
He had a head CT there which revealed significant vasogenic edema of the left hemisphere and small areas of hemorrhage at the left frontal pole and the right occipital region (?within ventricle or mass).
Upon arrival at the ED here he was still hypertensive to 190/90's, with hr 106.
His temperature was 100 rectal.
He had a repeat head CT which revealed the areas of hemorrhage to be unchanged, but increased rightward shift compared to the scan from earlier this evening.
The patient was then admitted to the Neurology ICU service for further monitoring and treatment.
