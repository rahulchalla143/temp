LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Had a white count of 12.9 with neutrophils 83% and bandemia of 11.
Hematocrit was 32.9 and platelets was 231.
PT and PTT was 13.2 and 27.6 with INR of 1.2.
Chemistries showed a sodium of 134, potassium 4.0, chloride 98, CO2 of 26.
BUN and creatinine of 20 and 0.8, glucose of 148.
ALT was 331 on admission with alkaline phosphatase of 716, total bilirubin of 10.3 and direct bilirubin of 8.2.
Amylase and lipase of 49 and 61.
Temperature at the time was 102.5, pulse rate of 92, blood pressures 120/80, respirations of 20, and she was saturating 91% on room air, and 98% with 2 liters nasal cannula.
The bile culture and the blood culture also came back with Klebsiella oxytoca and Serratia marcescens, which both were pansensitive.
Patient was also found to have a hematocrit which was drifting down to 25.5.
Patient was started on Unasyn and was emergently taken for EGD and decompression of the biliary system.
EGD showed blood in the stomach and two erosions in the second part of the duodenum.
On presentation to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was febrile at 101.2, tachycardic at 114, blood pressure of 75/42, and respiratory rate of 12.
Patient's blood pressure stabilized at 114/69 with pulmonary artery pressure of 46/31, wedge of 15, and CVP of 25.
Patient was intubated to protect the airway, and patient was resuscitated in the first six hours receiving total input of 7.2 liters including two units of packed red blood cells.
The hematocrit improved on 25.5 to 30.6, but again was drifting down to 26.4.
On hospital day four, the patient received three additional units of packed red blood cells, and underwent a repeat EGD which showed oozing at the sphincterotomy site.
Hematocrit remained stable, and patient was transferred to the floor on hospital day six.
Her amylase at the time showed a level of 108 with lipase peaking at 522.
CT scan of the abdomen showed minimal stranding around the pancreas.
Patient went to the operating room on hospital day three, underwent open cholecystectomy, common bile duct exploration, or choledochoscopy, Roux-en-Y side-to-side hepaticojejunostomy, and biopsy of the porta hepatis area.
Frozen section biopsy of the fibrous tissue around the porta hepatis came back positive for malignant cells, and cystic and a common bile duct node were also positive.
The final pathology came back with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder with full thickness involvement and positive cystic ductal margins, the common bile duct and cystic duct were also found to have adenocarcinoma cells.
Bile cultures on hospital day 18, postoperative day five came back with Cipro resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens, which was resistant to tobramycin and intermediate resistant to gentamicin.
Patient was switched over to Zosyn when the culture results came back on postoperative day eight.
Patient underwent a tube cholangiogram study and the T-tubes were capped on postoperative day seven.
Postoperative day 15, patient underwent upper GI with small bowel follow-through which showed a near total gastric outlet obstruction and EGD study showed mucosal edema of the proximal part of the second part of the duodenum.
Patient is also to undergo a repeat UGI at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital within 7-14 days of discharge.
