Images: CT torso with contrast [**2128-8-10**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2128-8-10**]: Large right-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, cannot exclude developing infectious infiltrate, aerated right and left lung are within normal limits, levoconcave scoliosis .
ECHO [**2128-8-11**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (??
LVEF 50%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade (based on absence of respiratory variation of MV/TV inflow as RV could not be well visualized).
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CXR [**2128-8-12**]: AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: Hickman catheter terminates in the upper SVC, as before.
The cardiac silhouette cannot be evaluated in the setting of large right pleural effusion.
She was admitted to ICU for further evaluation of her tachycardia.
CT showed no pericardial effusion.
TTE was obtained to evaluate compressive physiology, however the images were of poor quality and some details were not possible to evaluate.
TTE showed most likely a normal ejection fraction with no evidence of tamponade.
EKG with ST abnormalities and no prior for comparison.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
She was monitored on telemetry and notable only for tachycardia to 110s.
Blood cultures sent and are still pending to this date.
Her saturation was high 90s on room air.
Hct and Hgb was trended daily and labs sent for vitamin B12, folate and iron studies which revealed normal B12 and folate, however Iron studies were suggestive of Anemia of chronic disease, most likely due to her malignancy.
CT scan of your chest in concern of a clot in your lung vessels.
Fortunately, the CT scan didn't show any clots in the vessels of your lung.
However, your CT scan did show evidence of your known cancer.
