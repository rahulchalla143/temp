Went to OSH were CT scan revealed T5 and L1 compression fractures, thoracic spinal cord compression, and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
MRI showed pathologic compression fracture at T5, with diffusely abnormal signal intensity involving vertebral body, pedicles, and laminae.

MR C,T,L SPINE W& W/O CONTRAST - [**2137-12-1**] 1.
Several scattered focal lesions of increased signal intensity on the STIR sequence and enhancement on the post-contrast images in the spine, including the sacrum, representing metastatic lesions.
CT torso can be performed for this reason; evaluation for bony details for the spine can be better performed with sagittal and coronal reformations on the same.
Otherwise, CT of the spine- thoracic, and if necessary, cervical and lumbar regions can be considered for better evaluation of bony details.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, with collapse/consolidation of the adjacent portions of the lung, which can be better evaluated with CT chest.
Small 0.8 cm T2 hyperintense lesion, in the left kidney, may represent a cyst but can be better evaluated at time of CT torso.
L- Spine: [**2137-12-1**]: In comparison with the previous study of this date, an extensive  surgical procedure has been performed with multiple rods and hooks extending from C6 through L2.
CT or MR would be necessary to exclude this possibility.
Pathology T5 and Lipoma of Left Hip: 1)  Soft tissue, left hip, excision: Mature adipose tissue consistent with lipoma.
By kappa/lambda light chain immunostaining, plasma cells are kappa restricted.
Tissue: Immunotyping, Lymph node: Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by a non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
Bone Marrow Biopsy ([**12-6**]): Cellular marrow with increased plasma cells.
Correlation with clinical, radiologic, and other laboratory studies are needed for definitive confirmation/categorization.
A SPEP was then performed which demonstrated an elevated IgA level.
The patient underwent a bone marrow biopsy on [**12-5**], which demonstrated multiple myeloma.
# Hypophosphatemia: The patient had a phosphate level of 1.2 on admission.
She received 30 mEq of K Phos which increased her level to 2.7.
Medications on Admission: Calcium - On Occasion  Discharge Medications: 1.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Multiple Myeloma Plasmacytoma  Secondary:   Discharge Condition: Good.
