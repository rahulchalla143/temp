CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2132-1-19**]: 1.
Mesenteric vessels are patent and without abnormality evident, though evaluation is limited because of respiratory motion.
CXR AP [**2132-1-20**]: Lungs are low in volume but clear, exaggerating heart size which is probably top normal.
Further work up revealed negative head CT, negative LP with negative blood, urine, and CSF cultures.
CXR showed ?infiltrate with likely aspiration etiology therefore was started on vanc/levo/flagyl.
However, initially pt's mental status did not dramatically improve (was very somnolent) and also had RUE and RLE flaccidity and weakness (had been lying unconscious on his R side for >24 hours) and therefore neuro was consulted who recommended EEG and MRA head/neck completed on [**2132-1-21**] which were negative.
He spiked a temp to 101 on [**2132-1-20**] and blood, urine, and sputum cx were sent.
Concern persisted for compartment syndrome, ortho was consulted who did compartmental manometry, which was completely negative; his R arm swelling improved with elevation.
A formal psych c/s was called to evaluate the patient.
MRI head/neck and EEG wnl.
Did have an initial WBC of 15, but once he cleared the secretions, his CXR revealed no further infiltrate and he had no O2 requirement.
