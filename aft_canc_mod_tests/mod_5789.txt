T9 CT guided biopsy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 96829**] is a 55 yo M w/long history of autonomic dysfunction complicated by urinary retention and suprapubic catheter placement who has multiple hospitalizations for recurrent UTI, most recently 2/[**2133**].
In the ED, a WBC was 8.5, lactate 1.2, temp was 99.4   Past Medical History: - autonomic dysfunction c/b urinary retention requiring indwelling Foley catheter, with recurrent UTIs - CAD: s/p MI [**2107**], tx with angioplasty - diffuse interstitial pneumonitis - anemia - autoimmune hepatitis - autoimmune thyroiditis - autoimmune peripheral neuropathy - intradural t10 mass - s/p cholecystectomy - chronic pain - depression  Social History: Pt lived with wife and 30-year-old daughter prior to prolonged hospital/[**Hospital1 1501**] stay; disabled, but formerly a truck driver; uses wheelchair at home w/ bedside commode [**1-8**] autonomic dysfunction; Previosly smoked 1ppd x 20years, then quit for ~10 yr, restarted and now quit since [**10-12**]; no alcohol or IVDU.
Comparison is made to prior radiographs dated [**2133-10-28**], [**2133-4-12**], and prior CT dated [**2132-9-26**].
AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Since most recent film there appears to be interval appearance to multiple ill-defined pulmonary nodules projecting over the right and left lower hemithoraces with the largest ill-defined opacity within the left mid hemithoraces measuring approximately 3.6 x 3.9 cm.
Recommend further evaluation with CT of the chest.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2134-2-17**] 10:53 AM  CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  Reason: please eval for masses  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 55 year old man with nodules seen on CXR, concerning for mets REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please eval for masses CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
Contiguous 5- and 1.25-mm thick axial and 5-mm thick coronal images were presented for interpretation.
COMPARISON: Chest x-ray [**2134-2-16**] and CTA chest [**2132-9-26**].
NON-CONTRAST CT OF THE CHEST: A new 1.6-cm nodule with somewhat irregular borders is seen in the right upper lobe.
This exam is not optimized for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
4.4-cm solid left lower lobe mass and 1.5-cm right upper lobe nodule are new compared to CT from [**2132-9-6**].

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-11-19**], the findings are generally similar.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast and contrast-enhanced multidetector CT acquired axial images of the chest.
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
CT OF THE CHEST: The previously identified nodule within the right upper lobe and mass within the left lower lobe is unchanged compared to recent CT from [**2134-2-17**].
Small mediastinal lymph nodes are seen which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
The smaller hypodenisity in the left lobe of the liver (series 3,image 86) is not worrisome, however, the subtle hypoenhancing lesion in the right lobe of the liver, better seen on prior CT from [**2134-2-17**] is concerning and should be further evaluated with ultrasound.
Compared to the prior CT from five days ago, there is no significant change in chronic interstitial lung disease or pulmonary mass/nodule.
Subtle hypoenhancing lesion in the right lobe of the liver, better seen on preious CT from [**2134-2-17**] and recommend ultrasound for better characterization.
Despite the teams best efforts the patient suffered irrepairable anoxic brain injury as revealed by an extremely limited physical exam and the findings on EEG.
