Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2190-11-18**]  2:14:44 AM Atrial flutter with moderate ventricular response.
Compared to the prior tracing of [**2190-11-12**] the ventricular response has slowed.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 86 0 82 344/389 0 3 16 .
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2190-11-23**] Conclusions: The left atrium is elongated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
His blood sugars were checked QAC&HS.
His bloods sugars were stable during the past 3-4 days on CC6.
He should continue to have his blood sugars checked at least daily, and treated as needed.
Cardiology was consulted because he was in aflutter with HR in 150s on [**2194-11-25**].
He underwent an ECHO (refer to results section).
INR/COUMADIN: His goal INR is [**2-6**].
