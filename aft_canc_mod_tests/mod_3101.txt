MDS on dacogen - presented in [**2143-9-28**] with pancytopenia, complained of dyspnea on exertion - cytopenias progressed and he had a repeat bone marrow done in [**1-4**] which showed a markedly hypercellular bone marrow with significant dysplasia in the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.
Flow cytometry demonstrated CD-34-positive cells comprised 4-5% of total blast gated events.
Cytogenetics revealed [**11-16**] cells have abnormal chromosome 12 and an abnormal chromosome 17 in a possible three way translocation.
- refractory to Procrit, at escalating doses and then became red blood cell transfusion dependent - Decitabine therapy was initiated [**2145-9-13**] but had to be discontinued due to a hematoma which developed at the site of a wound.
CT scan demonstrated perigastric adenopathy and EGD had a multilobulated mass with ulceration.
- Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated mildly hypercellular marrow for age with megakaryocytic dysplasia and occasional ringed sideroblasts (10%) without evidence of lymphoma.

# BRBPR: Requiring admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for Hct of 18, pt improved with IVF and PRBCs.
However he developed melena, raising concern for upper GI bleed, so he underwent EGD on [**5-17**], which showed an ulcerated, malignant-appearing mass in the antrum of the stomach, with stigmata of recent bleeding.
Biopsies were pending on discharge (will need f/u in outpt setting), but given the likelihood of recurrent MALToma, the pt also underwent XRT to the stomach to aid in stopping the bleeding.
He was discharged with instructions to f/u [**Hospital1 **]-weekly with heme onc for blood cts, neupogen injections.
Pt was treated with platelet transfusion x2 and PRBCs x2.
Followup Instructions: Please follow up on [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] 7 on Wednesdays and Fridays for blood draws and neupogen.
