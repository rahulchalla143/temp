A head ct was performed consistent with significant right hemispheric edema and possible right sided brain mass.
There was a chest xray that was consistent with a possible mass in the left lower lobe.
The post-gadolinium images are motion degraded and no obvious other lesions are seen.
[**2130-7-23**] CT Torso IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2130-7-23**] Xray Left wrist and forearm: FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2130-7-22**].
[**2130-7-25**] chest Xray: FINDINGS: In comparison with the outside study of [**7-22**], there is little overall change in the appearance of the large left lower lung mass laterally consistent with the opacification seen on the CT that was felt to represent both a left lower lobe superior segment and left lower lobe mass representing either bronchogenic carcinoma or metastases.
[**2130-7-26**] L wrist xray: IMPRESSION: Nondisplaced distal radial fracture with largely unchanged from prior study.
[**2130-7-28**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the neurosurgery service for further workup of Right parietal brain mass seen on CT scan.
An MRI was obtained and this showed an enhancing R parietal mass with surrounding vasogenic edema.
A CT torso was obtained for further metastatic workup that demonstrated bilateral lung lesions, two in the left lower lobe and one small lesion in the right lower lobe, as well as necrotizing right paratracheal nodes.
Neuro-oncology, radiation oncology, hematology/oncology and Thoracic surgery were consulted due to her metastatic disease.
Post operative CT revealed no hemorrhage, moderate post op pneumocephalus and moderate edema.
