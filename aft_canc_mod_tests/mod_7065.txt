Fatty infiltration of the liver  CT Abd [**2197-2-2**]: 1.
Please also see chest CTA of the same day showing patchy opacities throughout the lungs concerning for penumonia.
CXR [**2197-2-4**]:  There is dense opacification involving both lungs, somewhat more pronounced in the upper zones bilaterally.
CXR [**2197-2-5**]: Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.
Allowing for differences in technique, the findings are very similar to those on the chest x-ray from one day earlier.
CXR [**2197-2-7**]: Improving alveolar infiltrates which represents improving pneumonic infiltrate or CHF.
EKG [**2197-2-2**]: Normal sinus rhythm, without diagnostic abnormality.
EKG [**2197-2-7**]: Sinus rhythm.

Her oxygen requirement continued to increase until she was requiring 6L via face mask to maintain adequate O2 saturation; she was therefore transferred to the ICU for further monitoring on POD#3.
ID: The pt spiked a fever on POD#[**3-17**], and a CTA showed a multifocal pneumonia.
She continued to spike temperatures in the ICU, and a CT of the abdomen was obtained, which showed no abscesses or postoperative fluid collections.
She continued to have fevers along with her desaturations on the floor, and official ID consult was obtained on POD#5; they recommended adding Vancomycin and Zosyn for more broad coverage for her pneumonia.
GU: The pt had low urine output on POD#[**2-14**].
The pt's creatinine rose on POD#11, presumed due to the nephrotoxicity of the IV contrast she had received, as well as the Vancomycin.
Heme: The pt had baseline anemia with a Hct of ~27 as an outpt, etiology unclear.
Her Hct rose to 27 during the course of her hospital stay.
