After bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry confirmed suspicion for APML, patient started 7+4 with daunorubicin and cytarabine.
Pt also started on dexamethasone 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] as prophylaxis against ATRA syndrome, as on [**7-15**] the patient became short of breath and CXR showed pulmonary congestion.
His cell counts dropped subsequent to this, and he was supported with PRBC and platelet transfusions.
On [**2109-8-15**], BM biopsy showing no morphologic evidence of myelogenous leukemia.
Etiology felt to be plt count of 7 on admission.
On repeat imaging [**2109-8-13**], prior ICH noted to be "resolving small left occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage, without evidence of new hemorrhage or other acute intracranial abnormality.
Patient had intermittent fevers throughout hospitalization, most likely felt to be from multifocal pna vs. side effect of ATRA, as his microbiology and bronchoscopy work-up were largely negative.
Bronchoscopy washings for cytology done [**2109-8-23**] showing "clusters of atypical epithelial cells with enlarged nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli, favor reactive pneumocytes."
ENT evaluation did not reveal any mucosal changes.
Barium esophagogram on [**2109-8-27**] normal.
Patient declined evaluation with EGD.
R ankle imaging showed no fx, effusion, or soft tissue abnormality.
Rheumatology was consulted and performed joint tap, which was negative for septic arthritis/infection and no crystals were noted.
# Hemoptysis/alveolar hemorrhage: bronch [**7-25**] for hemoptysis showed increasingly bloody return suggestive of ?alveolar hemorrhage, although CT with predominant pathology in left lung which would be unusual for DAH.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 10 mL IV PRN line flush PICC, non-heparin dependent: Flush with 10 mL Normal Saline daily and PRN per lumen.
SECONDARY: 1. multifocal pneumonia 2. gout 3. pulmonary embolus 4. genital herpes simplex virus type 2   Discharge Condition: good, without shortness of breath, ambulating well, tolerating food without difficulty, pain controlled   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital and diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia after bone marrow biopsy.
NEW MEDICATIONS/MEDICATION CHANGES: - stop hydrochlorothiazide - stop sertraline - stop sildenafil until genital lesions resolve - stop valsartan - increase oxycontin to 30 mg by mouth twice a day - increase oxycodone to 5-10 mg by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain - start valtrex 1000 mg by mouth twice a day until genital herpes lesions are gone.
Finally, you will have a pulmonary/lung appointment in [**2-6**] months time for repeat bronchoscopy with non-contrast CT scan of chest.
