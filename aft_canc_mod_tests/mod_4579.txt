The day prior to her nadir she has a fever and LLQ pain, which  appeared to be mild diverticulitis/sigmoiditis on CT scan.
CXR was negative, urine culture was negative.
Stem cell culture had no growth.
All symptoms improved with the return of her WBC and abx coverage was narrowed to cipro and flagyl which were discontinue several days prior to discharge.
Patient spiked to 100.6 on [**2150-11-3**] and CXR and CT showed ground glass opacity in RLL, suggestive of PNA.
At that time  normal Cr and hematocrit, IgG 1360 [**11-30**]: creatinine 0.6, M-protein 0.2 g/dL [**2148-3-29**]: creatinine 0.9, hct 32.3, M-protein <0.2 g/dL [**2149-6-2**]: cr 1.12, hct 33.2, M-protein <0.2 g/dL [**7-3**]: routine dental x-rays showed new mandible lesion.
[**2149-7-22**]  oral biopsy of mandible from tooth #20 area showed extensive infiltration by monotonous population of intermediate sized cells with round eccentrically located nuclei; lesional cells CD[**Pager number **] positive, kappa restricted, consistent with involvement by  a plasma cell neoplasm.
[**8-2**]: cr 0.88, hct 34.1, M-protein <0.2 g/dL, beta-2 microglobulin was 3.38, IgG 294, IgA <7, IgM <9.
Urine with kappa 760 mg/dL and 24 hour collection revealed kappa light chain of 10.6 grams/24h.
[**2149-8-12**]: skeletal survey negative [**2149-8-15**]: bone marrow bx: 100% CD138 positive kappa restricted cells ("sections of the biopsy and clot show a marrow which has  been almost entirely replaced by a population of plasma cells.)
[**2150-2-5**]: bone marrow bx: monoclona kappa plasmacytosis comprises  approximately 70-80% total bone marrow cellular elements [**2150-2-17**]: changed to velcade (increased to 1.3 mg/m2), revlimid (10 mg daily, 2 weeks on/1 week off), cytoxan (500 mg/m2 D1 and  D8), dexamethasone (10 mg twice weekly).
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1) Port a cath placement [**2149-9-25**] 2) Left 2nd and 3rd toe surgery (to fix RA deformity) [**2144**] 3) Left 5th finger surgery (for RA deformity) [**2141**] 4) bilateral breast reduction [**2122**]   Social History: She worked as a social worker at [**Name (NI) 87665**] extended care long term acute care hospital.

Bones of the skull and of the visualized cervical vertebrae show heterogenously hypointense marrow signal on T1-weighted images, which likely represents diffuse marrow infiltration by multiple myeloma  [**11-11**] EEG: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of rhythmic and sharply contoured epileptiform discharges which evolve in frequency consistent with non-convulsive status epilepticus.
[**11-11**] CSF flow cytometry: No CD56 and CD138 double cells are seen.
CT of the neck with contrast could be helpful for further evaluation, if feasible.
[**11-23**] EEG: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of slow alpha rhythm, mild diffuse background slowing, and brief bursts of generalized delta activity.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-8-27**], the findings are similar.
Neuro exam nonfocal.
Patient with negative microbiologic work up during last hospital stay, Blood and Urine cultures NGTD from [**11-9**].
CXR without signs of pathology, abdomen benign.
CT abd WNL, diverticulitis from last admission resolved.
Blood cultures drawn.
Head MRI showed no acute pathology.
Neuro consulted and lumbar puncture performed showing slightly elevated protein and 88% lymphocytes.
Given change in mental status, patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and EEG performed suggested patient was having seizures.
Repeat MRI head again did not show any abnormality, and repeat 24 hr EEG [**Date range (1) **] did no show sign of seizure but generalized mild slowing.
She required 2 units PRBCs and 1 unit plts throughout her stay to keep hct >21, plts >11.
Her WBC and Hct began to recover slightly, however her platelets remained low, prompting some concern for secondary thrombocytopenia.
Echocardiogram was normal.
She was started on metoprolol at 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with improved control of her rate and pressures.
TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: - Needs a follow up dilantin level sometime between [**Date range (1) 87667**] (5-7 days after last change in dosage) - Will need to follow up with neurology for further care and monitoring for her seizures - Follow up BP and HR control on metoprolol  Medications on Admission: 1. levofloxacin 750 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q24H (every  24 hours) for 3 days: take on [**2150-11-9**], [**2150-11-10**], [**2150-11-11**].
)(s)* Refills:*2* 7. acyclovir 400 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours).
Disp:*300 ml * Refills:*2* 10. phenytoin sodium extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO every AM.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw phenytoin (dilantin) level, and please note the time of the draw and time of last dose.
We took many blood and urine cultures, chest xrays, and tests on your spinal fluid, and no source was ever found.
Medication changes: START fluconazole 200 mg daily (for thrush) START levetiracetam (keppra) 500 mg twice daily (anti-seizure) START phenytoin (dilantin) 100 mg in AM, 75 mg in PM (anti-seizure) START metoprolol tartrate 25 mg twice daily (for heart rate and blood pressure)  Followup Instructions: Neurology follow up appointment: This appointment is still in the process of being made.
