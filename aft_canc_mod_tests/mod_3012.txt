He had a scan of his head which was negative for any acute process.
He was transiently hypotensive with SBPs in the 80s, with good response to fluid boluses.
We investigated the possibility of fundaparinux, however it was contraindicated in him because of his weight (under 50kg).
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for a fast heart rate (supraventricular tachycardia).
We gave you a medication called adenosine to help break the rhtythm, and your heart rate and rhythm went back to normal.
