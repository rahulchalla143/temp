An ambulance was called and it was noted that the patient's blood sugar was decreased at 52.
The patient was admitted to the medical floor but on arrival to the floor, she was noted to be hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 80s prompting Intensive Care Unit evaluation.
Head CT was done which was negative for hemorrhages or mass lesions.
On [**2122-2-16**], echocardiogram showed dilated left ventricle, akinesis of septum/apex, severe hypokinesis of lateral/posterior walls, ejection fraction of 20 to 25%, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation.
Echocardiogram from [**2122-2-24**], showed ejection fraction of 20 to 25%.
Echocardiogram from [**2122-7-13**], showed ejection fraction of 20 to 25%.
Vital signs revealed temperature 97.0, heart rate 80, respiratory rate 24, blood pressure 80/60, oxygen saturation 100% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Jugular venous pressure is eight centimeters.
Lymph - No axillary lymphadenopathy.
LABORATORY DATA:  Arterial blood gases revealed pH 7.45/25/88 in room air.
Chem7 revealed sodium 132, potassium 4.2, chloride 99, bicarbonate 18, blood urea nitrogen 52, creatinine 1.8, glucose 66, calcium 8.7, phosphate 3.9, magnesium 1.8.
ALT 37, AST 66, alkaline phosphatase 124, amylase 14, total bilirubin 3.0, direct bilirubin 2.2.
On [**5-24**], total bilirubin was 0.9 and on [**4-24**], total bilirubin was 1.6 and [**3-24**], total bilirubin was 3.6.
First CK was 43, troponin less than 0.3.
Complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count 6.4, hematocrit 33.7, platelets 163,000, neutrophils 84%, bands 14%, lymphocytes 2%, monocytes 1%.
Prothrombin time was 15.0, partial thromboplastin time 29.2, INR 1.6.
Chest x-ray revealed four chamber cardiomegaly and subsequent atelectasis at the left base.
Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, poor R wave progression, no ischemic changes .
At that time, it was thought that the patient's congestive heart failure was secondary to Adriamycin resulting in an ejection fraction of 20%.
The patient did have wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram and was to have a cardiac catheterization planned for the future to rule out coronary artery disease, however, the patient has never had documented evidence of coronary artery disease in the past.
Antibiotics with Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin and Flagyl were started before blood cultures were sent.
She was hypotensive to systolic blood pressure of 80s.
Urine culture was positive for pansensitive E. coli, however, no other source for sepsis was found.
Repeat echocardiogram showed no tamponade, 4+ tricuspid regurgitation and 4+ mitral regurgitation with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%.
The patient's SVR was in the 400 range and cardiac index was approximately 2.1.
Bilateral thoracentesis was done and 500 ccs was removed on the right and 800 ccs was removed on the left.
The pleural effusions were consistent with exudates by LDH and had 700 to 1000 white blood cells.
Her peak creatinine was 2.6 and continued to improve despite aggressive diuresis.
Infectious disease - No source for the patient's sepsis was ever found and infectious disease was not convinced that the positive urine cultures could be responsible for the patient's septic physiology.
CT of the abdomen was negative but could not definitively rule out cholecystitis.
The patient's total bilirubin peaked at approximately 7.6 on [**2122-10-11**], and improved with diuresis.
HIT antibody was sent which was negative.
Neurologic - The patient presented with delirium and lumbar puncture was attempted but was unsuccessful.
Psychiatry - As an outpatient, the patient has noted to be anxious and has been on low dose benzodiazepines, however, these benzodiazepines were avoided during her Intensive Care Unit stay due to her acute renal failure and mental status changes.
They, however, recommended a Transesophageal Echocardiogram to rule out embolic event, however, the Medical Intensive Care Unit felt that the probability of emboli was low and a Transesophageal Echocardiogram was not performed.
