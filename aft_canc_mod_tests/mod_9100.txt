The dose of the cyclosporin continuous infusion was adjusted based on serum levels which were drawn every one to two days.
On day plus six, the patient did have some nosebleeds likely secondary to the fact that his platelets were low at 22.
Given his low platelets and bleeding, a noncontrast head CT was done to rule out intracranial hemorrhage.
The CT done on [**2118-9-21**] was normal.
The patient began to show signs of engraftment approximately day plus ten at which time his white cell count began to increase.
The patient had a continued increase in his white cell count and was not longer neutropenic.
The patient continued on these antibiotics until his neutropenia resolved and his white count began to increase.
Prior to discharge, hepatitis B viral load was sent and there was a plan to resume treatment of his hepatitis B with Lamivudine after discharge.
Several urinalyses were done which did not show any evidence of hemorrhage cystitis or urinary tract infection.
Numerous head CT scans were done which did not show any cause of the headache.
He was taken for a stat noncontrast head CT scan which showed a very small inferior frontal lobe subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The patient was immediately transfused two bags of platelets and he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring and management.
A repeat head CT scan was done the evening after this event which did not show any change in the size of the hemorrhage.
General Surgery was consulted and saw the patient to suture his head laceration.
Another repeat head CAT scan was done approximately four days after this event and this showed apparent resolution of the subarachnoid hemorrhage with no new lesions or hemorrhages.
After this repeat head CT showed resolution of the subarachnoid hemorrhage, the Dilantin was discontinued.
The head CT scans also showed a fluid collection in the sphenoid sinus that may be consistent with sinusitis.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was maintained on IV fluid hydration as per the transplant protocol throughout the hospital admission.
