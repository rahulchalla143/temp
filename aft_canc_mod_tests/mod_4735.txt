CXR [**11-30**] (post procedure, prior to transfer to ICU) Peristent collapse of left lung/opacification of left hemithorax, R lung clear, maybe some increased pulm vascular congestion on R  Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo female with a history of COPD and small cell lung cancer s/p chemo and XRT who was admitted on [**11-28**] for a scheduled placement of a tracheal stent complicated by migration of the tracheal stent and repeat IP procedure with creation of a piece-meal Y stent now stable and being called out of the MICU.
# Small cell lung cancer:  The patient had a CT on [**11-24**] showing compression of the distal trachea and was admitted for monitoring after her initial bronchoscopy where she had tracheal and left mainstem stents placed.
Calcium 500 + D  Oral 10. fluticasone-salmeterol 500-50 mcg/dose Disk with Device Sig: One (1) inhalation Inhalation once a day.
Unfortunately one of the stents moved causing you to feel short of breath so you underwent another bronchoscopy where the stent was repositioned and an additional stent was placed to your right main stem bronchus.
After the second procedure your oxygen saturations were transiently low and you were watched overnight in the intensive care unit.
Your oxygen saturations have stabilized on [**1-13**] L of oxygen.
An appointment was made for you to follow up with your oncologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 636**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 116**] on Monday [**12-5**] at 1 pm.
