He was loaded with Plavix and underwent cardiac catheterization which again confirmed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Given the findings, cardiac surgery was consulted and further preoperative evaluation was performed.
Echocardiogram showed normal LV function and only mild mitral regurgitation.
His preoperative chest x-ray revealed an approximately 5 mm rounded nodular opacity in the lingula that could represent a pulmonary nodule.
A chest CT scan was performed on POD 3 to evaluate the 5mm nodule that was noted on his pre-op chest x-ray.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and they requested follow up CT scan in 6 months and follow up with [**Doctor Last Name 1533**], [**Name8 (MD) **] MD after the CT.  On post-operative day 5 he was stable and discharged to home.
