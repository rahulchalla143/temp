IMAGING: CXR ([**2170-6-25**]): One view.
ECHO ([**2170-6-26**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-3-14**], the right ventricle is now dilated, and moderate pulmonary hypertension is now present.
[**2170-7-5**] CXR (PA/lateral): 1.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 40 year-old man with a history of C5-quadriplegia following a motorcycle accident at age 17 and a recent episode of ESBL UTI/urosepsis who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with hypotension concerning for pneumonia or urosepsis.
Urine culture from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] grew out ESBL Klebsiella consistent with the patient's prior presentation (in [**2170-3-24**]).
He was continued on meropenem for a 9 day course, discontinued on day 9 because of an episode of pancytopenia (WBC 1.6; Hct 22.5; Plt 34), thought to be due to drug toxicity.
However, his recovery while on meropenem, a urinalysis showing ESBL Klebsiella and pyuria, along with a negative sputum culture, suggest that the primary infection was a UTI.
He was put on 3 L O2 and his saturation returned to the mid-90s.
His oxygen requirement (typically 2-3 L during these acute episodes) would resolve after chest PT and active suctioning of his secretions.
At the time of discharge, he continued to have saturations in the mid 90s on room air.
he is hypothermic at baseline with temperature around 94 and his white count is typically low, around [**12-29**].
Once resuscitation began at [**Hospital1 18**], his creatinine was consistently in the 1.6-1.7 range.
His creatinine on discharge was 1.7. .
# ELEVATED LFTs: On admission to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU, the patient was noted to have transaminitis (ALT 456, AST 760, LDH 558, AKP 441).
However, these values had not returned to [**Location 213**] by discharge- ALT 102, ASt 225; AP 241, LDH 306.
Hepatitis serologies were sent given his history of multiple transfusions and were pending on discharge.
# MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROME: Throughout this hospital stay, the patient demonstrated pancytopenia (consistently, WBC below 3, hemoglobin in the range of 8, and platelets in the range of 40s-50s).
As mentioned above, he did have one pancytopenic drop when he was on the medicine floor, which brought his WBC to 1.6, hemoglobin to 7.6, and platelets to 34.
Following discontinuation, his blood counts returned to their respective baselines as mentioned above.
On discharge WBC 2.4, Hct 23.4, Plt 34.
We recommend a recheck of his CBC on [**7-9**] in the rehab center.
# S/P APPENDICOVESICOSTOMY/ACE-[**Location (un) **]: The patient underwent urinary catheterization four times daily through the appendicovesicostomy.
His sodium improved, but this problem recurred.
He should have his Na rechecked at the rehab center on [**7-9**].

You were treated with antibiotics, fluid rehydration, and blood pressure support.
You had some episodes of when your blood oxygen levels dropped low which were related to poor clearance of your secretions in your lungs.
