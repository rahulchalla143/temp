Admission Date:  [**2131-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-2-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-12-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Latex / Adhesive Tape  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: DOE - Hodgkin's Lyphoma   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Chest Tube Placement/VATS   History of Present Illness: This is a 38 yo female with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma (diagnosed in [**2123**]) that involves her lungs, who presents with worsening respiratory function.
She was seen in clinic today and noted to have DOE with walking short distances, RR 40 and hypotension with BPs 82/64.
Her O2 sat was 95% at rest.
She is normally seen at an OSH and per reports PFTs showed FEV1 of 0.8 (25% of expected).
She was given a 500 cc NS bolus, blood cultures were drawn, and she was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
She had an autologous BMT in 4/[**2128**].
In [**2-/2130**] (about one year post transplant) a CT evaluation revealed recurrent disease in her chest and abdomen.
Anterior mediastinal adenopathy was in the field of prior radiation.
She underwent a biopsy of her anterior mediastinal adenopathy that revealed recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Father diagnosed just recently with pancreatic, liver and colon CA (primary ca not known)-also states father has cancer from asbestos   Physical Exam: VS: Tc 96.5 HR 145 BP 104/70 O2 sat 98% on 2L Gen: Young female with dyspnea while talking, but able to speak in full sentances HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric sclera, MMM, clear oropharynx Neck: supple, no LAD Cardio: tachy with reg rhythm, nl S1 S2, no m/r/g Pulm: CTA B but with decreased breath sounds on left side about halfway up lung with dullness to percussion as well, decrease breath sounds at right lung base Abd: soft, NT, +BS, mild tenderness in LLQ Ext: no edema Neuro: CN 2-12 intact, Muscle strength 5/5 in b/l upper and lower extremities Sensation to light touch intact   Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2131-1-10**] CXR - Large amount of left pleural fluid which is worse in comparison to the previous study.
[**2131-1-11**] Chest CT - Large left pleural effusion responsible for near-complete collapse of the left lung.
Right supraclavicular, paratracheal, subcarinal, paraesophageal, and diaphragmatic lymphadenopathy.
[**2131-1-12**] Echo - The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
[**2131-1-14**] Unilateral breast U/S - No fluid collections.
Unchanged bilateral masses and chest wall mass consistent with known metastatic disease  [**2131-1-17**] CTA - No pulmonary embolism.
[**2131-1-20**] CXR - Overall stable appearance of the chest with no pneumothorax identified.
[**2131-1-21**] CT Abdomen - Marked retroperitoneal and retrocrural lymphadenopathy.
[**2131-1-25**] CXR - Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions are again demonstrated with apparent loculation on the left.
Overall, since the recent radiograph of earlier the same date, there has not been a significant change in the appearance of the chest.
[**2131-1-28**] CXR - Left subclavian line tip in the superior vena cava is unchanged.
[**2131-1-29**] ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is a small, echo dense, organized pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-1-14**], the small pericardial effusion is more evident on this complete study.
[**2131-2-1**] CXR - No interval change in pleural effusions.
[**2131-2-5**] CXR - Mild pulmonary edema improved since [**1-28**] and 9.
Contraction of the left hemithorax is longstanding, and left lower lobe atelectasis has been stable since [**1-28**].
On discharge her WBC was 1.2 with an ANC of 840.
Recent PFTs done as outpatient showed FEV1 of 0.8, which suggested obstructive disease.
Imaging done here with CXR and chest CT showed diffuse disease in chest and left sided pleural effusion with almost complete collapse of left lung.
She had a CTA to evaluate for PE and was negative.
It was felt that the only way to further improve her symptoms was to treat the underlying disease.
Repeat X-rays showed improving pulmonary edema after lasix treatment.
Her coumadin was held during the early part of her admission because she was scheduled to have a thoracentesis and then VATS and required an INR of <1.5 for these procedures.
Breast ultrasound showed no fluid collections.
Blood and urine cultures were checked and were negative.
CXR showed large left pleural effusion and she was started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin for now for broad spectrum abx coverage to cover for possible PNA hidden behind the effusion.
A speech and swallow evaluation was done and then a video swallow that showed the patient was not aspirating.
