His postoperative HCT was 23.1 down 8 units compared with pre-op.
2 units of PRBCs were given and patient was bolused with IVF to help improve urine output.
His BP actually improved to 100 systolic after these interventions, but the patient soon became unresponsive.
Due to h/o AAA, Vascular was consulted and recommended keeping SBP between 100-140.
An abdominal ultrasound was performed on [**2172-3-4**] to rule out splenic/ portal vein thrombosis and it showed no evidence of thrombosis.
On [**2172-3-5**] a CT scan was performed to evaluate for subdiaphragmatic collection due to persistent hiccups.
No collection was seen on CT and patient's hiccups were improving upon discharge.
The patient was kept well hydrated and serial Cr levels were measured.
His Cr came down appropriately and was 1.1 at time of discharge.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
HEME: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; After initial operation, the patient's HCT dropped to 23, down 8 units from pre-op.
Serial HCTs were checked and on [**2172-3-1**], patient was noted to have a HCT of 22.3.
He was given 1 unit of PRBCs and his HCT improved to 26.4.
A CTA was performed on [**2172-3-3**] that again showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
Coumadin 5 mg Tablet Sig: Five (5) Tablet PO once a day: Please adjust dose for goal INR of [**1-16**].
