PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam patient's temperature is 98.1, pulse 102, BP 135/61, respiratory rate 20, satting 100 percent on room air.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count of 1.9, hematocrit 0.6, platelets 95.
Her sodium was 132, potassium 4.5, chloride 99, bicarbonate 12, BUN 21, creatinine 1.0, glucose 94.
ABG was drawn.
Lactate was 1.9.
However, the differential diagnosis was still broad and    stool studies were sent and were essentially negative.
The patient on night of admission spiked a temperature of    104.3.
The following day the patient was given broad antibiotic coverage as her neutrophil count was continuing to fall from the chemotherapy.
The patient was extubated within 12    hours and her electrolytes continued to improve.
She was on telemetry for the duration of her admission, and there were no further telemetry events.
Moreover, while in the ICU she had an echocardiogram that was essentially negative for any structural disease.
Breast cancer:  The patient had a torso CT to help stage    her malignancy.
The CT torso showed interval increase in    the size of a left hepatic lobe metastasis and diffuse    osseous metastatic disease.
In addition, the patient was    noted to have this questionable tracheal compression on a    chest film, so she had a CT trachea which showed widely    patent airways, more extensive osseous metastatic disease,    and pleural thickening in the right hemithorax likely also    looked metastatic disease.
Heme:  During her Intensive Care Unit stay her INR was as    high as 2.1 likely possible secondary to poor nutrition.
