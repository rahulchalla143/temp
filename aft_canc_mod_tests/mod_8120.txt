Pt underwent EGD showing SCC of the esophagus.
He had undergone a CT scan in [**Country 3396**] and was told that he had throat narrowing, which was causing him that difficulty.
According to his report, he had an endoscopy there, but no biopsy.
He underwent a CT neck on [**2200-9-10**], which showed some question of a mass-like lesion within the esophagus, but no neck abnormalities.
He underwent a CT torso on [**2200-9-11**], which showed proximal dilation of the esophagus with thickening of the esophagus distal to the level of the carina as well as some small pulmonary nodules.
He had a barium swallow on [**2200-9-12**], which showed a mid esophageal lesion concerning for esophageal carcinoma.
He went on to undergo an endoscopy on [**2200-9-16**].
Biopsy of the esophageal mass revealed an invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
He underwent a PET scan on [**2200-9-23**], which showed high-level FDG avidity at the site of the biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinoma as well as scattered subcentimeter mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes limited FDG avidity with an SUV mass of 3.7.

Heart size and mediastinum are stable.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**10-23**]: CONCLUSION:  1.
Tenosynovitis of the flexor hallucis longus associated with a small right subtalar joint effusion.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST [**11-4**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
On [**10-11**], one day before finishing this course, he spiked a fever and BCx grew out Abiotrophia (a nutrient deficient enterococcus).
A surveillance culture subsequently grew out Capnocytophagia (GNR).
His sodium was noted to be trending downwards so urine lytes were obtained and found a picture consistent with SIADH--likely either cisplatin toxicity or from tumor effect.
CT chest performed that noted bilateral new consolidation in right lower lobe, lingula and right middle lobe is compatible with large scale aspiration and/pneumonia.
Repeat Na was 127, and hypertonic saline stopped.
WBC down from 17 to 16.
Pt underwent EBUS [**10-6**] which showed no evidence of endobronchial lesions.
Pt started XRT and chemo (cisplatin/5FU) [**10-7**].
# Hyponatremia: His sodium levels stabilized in the 130s by the time of discharge.
Wound culture was performed.
Repeat TEE showed tricuspid leaflet thickening so this was switched to Amp/Gent.
Surveillance culture subsequently grew a GNR later speciated as Capnocytophagia and so antibiotics were broadened to Gentamycin/Zosyn.
# HEMATEMESIS: At baseline patient had normocytic anemia with iron studies c/w anemia of chronic disease.
On [**10-20**] patient developed hematemesis of bright red blood and clots also with blood found on G-tube draws during residual checks.
Hematocrit dropped and so pt was transfused several units of blood.
# HYPOTENSION-->SEPSIS: Patient's baseline is SBP 140s but over course of admission ran mostly in 100-110s.
After his endoscopy on [**10-21**] it was found that his sodium was recovering so fluid restriction was removed.
On [**10-23**] became tachycardic to the 140s with fever spiking to 102 and continuing relative hypotension with SBP in the 100s.
Urine lytes showed high osmolality and salt wasting and this was eventually attributed to SIADH from cisplatin effect.
Due to this patient developed low level of [**Last Name (un) **] with creatinine as high as 1.5 on [**10-21**].
Patient was taken off fluid restriction and hydrated which subsequent recovery in creatinine and Na.
# Urinary Retention: 2 days prior to discharge, he developed urinary retention > 900ccs in the setting of having discontinued his doxazosin for his blood pressure.
He was also started on tamsulosin, with less blood pressure effects per pharmacy.
# Hyponatremia: His sodium levels stabilized in the 130s by the time of discharge.
Wound culture was performed.
Information was obtained from Family/Caregiver[**Name (NI) 581**].

About one month before your admission, one of your blood cultures grew the bacteria Streptococcus viridans.
Towards the end of this treatment you developed a fever and a repeat blood culture showed two new bacteria in your blood stream.
During your admission, we noticed that your blood sodium level was low.
We performed an endoscopy to look at the site of bleeding and found that it was associated with your tumor.
