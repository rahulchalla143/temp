A CT scan last wednesday ([**6-11**]) revealed volume overload with increased pleural and pericardial effusions, pulmonary and periportal edema and ascites.
An echocardiogram that afternoon revealed an EF of >70% and early signs of cardiac tamponade (collapsed right atrium but not ventricle).

Labs and imaging were significant for Na 131, Cr 0.9 and ALT 51.
Her urinalysis was negative.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-6-18**], post tap resolution of the pericardial effusion is seen.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
She underwent pericardiocentesis with drainage of 500cc ([**2127-6-19**]) with serosanguinous exudative fluid.
In the CCU, the patient was hemodynamically stable with pulsus ~8, which was within normal limits.
An echo done on [**6-21**] showed no reaccumulation of fluid.
Repeat TTE on [**6-23**] showed a very small pericardial effusion, but no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Pericardial fluid cytology was still pending at discharge.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: - F/u pericardial fluid cytology - TTE planned for 7 days post discharge; will need to be arranged - Cardiology appointment - Oncology appointment .
Oncologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] was emailed regarding prognosis and treatment options and his thoughts were to do what was necessary (including pericardial window placement if indicated- ultimately was not needed).
Her serum and urine indices were consistent with SIADH which is likely [**3-5**] to her malignant pulmonary involvment.

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management of your shortness of breath.
Work-up of your symptoms revealed a collection of fluid in the lining surrounding your heart.
It is important that you follow up at the cardiology appointment below- you will need a repeat echocardiogram (ultrasound of your heart) in one week to assess if there is reaccumulation of the fluid.
