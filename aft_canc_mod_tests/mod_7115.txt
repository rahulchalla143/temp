Blood Cultures x 4 no growth to date  Pathology: Procedure date     Tissue received [**2129-6-23**] [**2129-6-23**] [**2129-6-28**] DIAGNOSIS: Left Parietal pleura, biopsy: Negative for malignant cells.
[**2129-7-6**] Chest X-Ray intraperitoneal air decreased.
[**2129-6-24**] Chest X-Ray IMPRESSION: Interval reaccumulation of moderate-sized pleural effusion on the left with loculated air at the apex.
[**2129-7-5**] Chest CT; 1.
Chest tube in place coursing through pleural fluid collection with question largely unchanged from previous study from CT [**2129-6-30**].
Decreased intraperitoneal free air as compared to CT from [**2129-6-30**].
Reactive lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules and lateral chest wall inflammatory changes, recommend followup CT once acute process has resolved to evaluate for interval course.
[**2129-6-30**] Chest CT: 1.
Expansion of left lateral chest wall musculature with adjacent fluid and soft tissue stranding as well as high attenuation foci of hemorrhage.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would better assess for prosthetic valve endocarditis.
[**2129-7-4**]: Abdominal Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of two periportal hemangiomas.
A postprocedure x-ray disclosed that the lung did not expand and placement of a left chest tube.
Transferred to the floor with 2 left chest tubes to LWS draing serosanguious fluid, a foley and Dilaudid PCA pain and pneumoperitoneum catheter and 500cc instilled.
Her Hct was 23.9 and she was transfused with 1 unit of PRBC.
POD#3 Her HCT was 21.7 for which she was transfused with 2 units of PRBC to a HCT of 22.6.
The chest x-ray showed a consolidation likely blood, therefore tPa was administered through the chest tube with a good response.
POD#4 Her HCT remained low and was transfused with 2 units of PRBC to a HCT of 27.
POD#5 Her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and she was given iv lasix with a good response.
POD#6 CT chest without contrast revealed a marked decrease in left pleural effusion following the decortication and placement of two left chest tubes, with residual moderate partially loculated effusion.
The patient's chest tubes were left to suction.
POD #7 Patient's heparin adjusted to 1300 units overnight.
POD#9  An echocardiogram was performed and showed no aortic vegetation.
An abdominal ultrasound was done and revealed no acute cholecystitis.
A repeat Chest CT showed possible pneumonia verses hemorrhage.
Follow-up chest x-ray revealed a loculated left pleural effusion.
Warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: as directed to maintain INR 2.0-3.0.
INR Goal 2.0-3.0 Daily weights: keep log.
Report to the [**Location (un) 861**] Radiology Department for a Chest X-Ray 45 mintues before your appointment.
