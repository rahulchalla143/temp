Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal, and the cavity is small.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%), without regional wall motion abnormalities.
A repeat transthoracic study to reassess the mid-cavitary gradient and determine severity of aortic stenosis may be performed following an intravenous fluid challenge.
