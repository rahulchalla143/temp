She had a CT with visualization of the stricture as well as with dilation of both the pancreatic and common bile ducts.
Her urine was reportedly "gold" colored and she is was urinating about every hour, with frequent burning.
Repeat lab tests showed increased bilirubin (from 25 to 30).
She was readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for another ERCP on [**2128-7-16**] and scheduled for surgery on [**2128-8-3**].
Lab results showed significantly elevated LFTs -- ALT/AST 2229/2919 up from 231/336 the day prior.
Bilirubin was 17.8 up from 13.7.
A serum ammonia level was tested and returned at 24.
A UTI was suspected based on UA dipstick and ciprofloxacin was started but stopped the next day after the urine cx returned no growth and no clinical signs of infection.
Her INR was 1.8 (from 1.9 the day prior) and her potassium was 2.9 (from 3.5 and 4.0 previously).
Her liver function tests, however, were consistently trending downwards with ALT/AST/TBili from 1590/1450/18.2 (POD 2) to 561/157/14.3 (POD 4) to 117/42/10.8 (POD 9).
Her INR went down to 1.1 on POD 2 and remained at 1.1 on POD 3.
Her potassium levels remained persistently in the low 3s with interspersed values of 2.6 and 2.8.
Her phosphorous was 2.2 and 1.8 on POD 1 and 2 respectively prior to normalizing to 3.8 and eventually 3.1 on POD 9.
Her physical exam was unchanged: the incision was clean, dry and intact, her abdomen soft, non-tender and with minimal distention, unchanged from prior exams.
During this process, labs indicated that Mrs.[**Known lastname 87583**] hematocrit was 11.9 (last checked value was POD 9 at 30.3 and had remained stable at approximately 30 during her entire post-op course) and had an INR of >21.
CT scan done that night showed a large intraperitoneal bleed, mostly clotted, with no active extravasation of contrast.
It was decided to manage her non-operatively with close monitoring with serial hematocrits, with fluid resuscitation and a low dose neo drip.
She was hemodynamically stable, responding appropriately to the blood transfusions, with her hematocrit going from 11.9-->13.7-->28.8 overnight.
Her hematocrit remained stable in the mid 20s.
Her bladder pressures were normal and measurements were stopped [**8-18**].
The pressors were titrated accordingly to maintain increased renal perfusion and urine output.
She was transfused 2units on [**2128-8-16**] to a post-tx hct of 28.9, her remained stable at INR 1.1, her pressors were weaned and her Cr was 1.6.
Her pressors were turned off entirely on [**2128-8-17**] and she remained hemodynamically stable for the next few days and her renal function improved gradually(1.2 on [**8-17**] to 0.6 on [**8-22**]).
She had some low blood pressure issues (SBPs in the 80s) and low urine output (20 cc/hr, Cr bumped suddenly to 1.7 from 0.6) for which she received a IVF boluses including both crystalloid and albumin, eventually had pressors restarted for a short period of time then dc'd after her toes were found to be blue then restarted after her toe ischemia resolved and pressures dropped again, this time with limited change in color of the toes.
A lasix drip was started on [**2128-8-26**] and diuresis was successful (she was negative almost 800 ml as opposed to daily positive in I's/O's since ICU admission) but her blood pressure did not tolerate it and it was dc'd shortly thereafter.
Her Cr remained elevated at 1.8 on [**8-27**].
She failed to regain any meaningful neurologic function two days post the PEA event, even with sedation weaned and turned off.
Neurology was consulted and suggested a head CT to rule out a brain hemmorrhage which could have been an additional etiology leading to the PEA arrest.
They additionally recommended a monitoring EEG to rule out seizure activity.
The EEG revealed  nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and she was treated with keppra and ativan starting [**2128-8-17**].
The NCSE continued on EEG for the next several days, ultimately ceasing in NCSE activity by [**2128-8-20**] and showing slight improvement on exam but with no wakefulness and continued guarded prognosis.
[**8-22**] repeat CT Head showed no interval changes and no evidence of hemorrhage or hypoxia.
EEG monitoring, however, showed a burst suppression pattern which was thought to be an indicator of poor prognosis.
EEG monitoring was stopped on [**8-23**].
Her WBC count was 13.7 immediately post-operatively and remained in the 11-18 range before gradually increasing to the mid-to-high 20s range in the ICU.`  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: 1.
