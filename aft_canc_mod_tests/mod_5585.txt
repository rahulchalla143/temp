Patient doesn't remember the fall, but she had just taken several pain medications (incl dilaudid, which she takes every 4 hours 4 mg without fail) and per her daughter and husband she often gets confused after taking her medications.
She had a workup at [**Hospital **] hospital which showed no fractures or other process, and was discharged within a few hours to [**Hospital 5682**] ECF again.
ED exam with diffuse ttp mainly over the RUQ/RLQ.
Labs notable for WBC 26.1, Hct 27.7 (at baseline), ALT 131, AST 51, Na 132, HCO3 19, alk phos 1452.
CT abd/pelvis with Left lower lobe opacification compatible with pneumonia, decreased mid abdominal collection.
Surgery consulted in ED, recommended CT abd with contrast, CT abd was done which showed abscesses largely unchanged but LLL PNA.
She underwent CT guided drainage of that major collection and cultures grew [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans and [**Female First Name (un) 29361**], VRE.
In the setting of a persistent leukocytosis, she was found to have a new liver abscess on [**7-30**] and underwent CT guided drainage with fluid growing VRE, MRSA and yeast.
CT of the abdomen on [**8-17**] showed an increased fluid collection in the caudate lobe of the liver measuring 2.1x2.3cm.
Patient had CT guided drainage of the fluid collection on [**8-19**] and culture results grew Klebsiella pneumoniae that was pansensitive.
Decision was made to maintain the patient on Meropenem on discharge instead of ertapenem for coverage of Enterbacter which grew previously as she seemed to have improvement in her abdominal pain, transaminitis, and remained afebrile with Meropenem.
Antibiotic course: [**Date range (1) 90350**] Daptomycin, Ertapenem [**Date range (1) 3047**] Daptomycin [**Date range (1) 90351**] Linezolid [**Date range (1) 90352**] Meropenem [**Date range (1) 29023**] Tigecycline (switched due to abd cramping) [**Date range (1) 90353**] Micafungin [**8-11**] abx changed to Daptomycin, Ertapenem, and Fluconazole on discharge [**8-18**] Daptomycin and Fluconazole continued from previous discharge and Ertapenem changed to Meropenem .
She had a CT of the abdomen on [**11-1**] which showed some minimal improvement in previously seen fluid collections near the liver though a new 2cm fluid collection was found in between the loops of the jejunum (not amenable to percutaneous drainage).
