ASA, Plavix, and IV heparin were started (pt already on coumadin for afib).
Bone marrow biopsy done on [**2152-10-30**] showed a marrow cellularity of 28-30%, interstitial infiltrate of plasma cells occurring singly and in clusters.
By CD138 immunohistochemical staining, plasma cells were 5-10% of marrow cellularity.

IMAGING: CXR [**2155-2-22**]: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
ECHO [**3-4**]: No evidence of endocarditis   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4460**] is an 80 year-old man with multiple myeloma who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with ARF [**1-14**] ATN from UGIB related hypotension vs myeloma related nephropathy.
# Acute renal failure on stage 3 CKD secondary to multiple myeloma: Mr. [**Known lastname 4460**] had chronic kideny disease secondary to his multiple myeloma.
His renal function deteriorated and pt became uremic with BUN >110.
# Bacteremia: Pt remained afebrile without leukocytosis throughout admission but given concerning fluid from portacath, blood cultures were drawn and grew coag negative staph and 2 strains of strep viridans on [**2-25**].
Repeat blood cultures were all negative as were line tip cultures.
ECHO ruled out endocarditis and pt should complete a 14 day course of Vancomycin, last day [**3-12**].
He underwent an EGD at OSH with [**Known lastname **] bleeding ulcer injected (biopsies not taken).
His HCT rose from 25->29.
His HCT was stable for the remainder of the hospitalization.
Administration of 500cc IVF and Metoprolol 25mg helped rhythm return to sinus.
Anticoagulation was held while concern was for bleeding (s/p reversal of INR with FFP at OSH as per HPI).
There is no need to monitor on telemetry or treat tachy or bradycardias unless pt symptomatic.
You had an endoscopy to visualize the bleeding vessel and had the area cauderized which stopped the bleeding.
You will need frequent monitoring of drug levels as your kidney function improves as high levels can be toxic and low levels are not effective.
