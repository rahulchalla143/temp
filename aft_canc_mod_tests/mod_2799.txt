Over the course of six months, his white count began to rise and essentially doubled to approximately 130,000 with a rising in his LDH of up to 1400, and he also was noted to have worsening palpable lymphadenopathy.
He did again not have a significant response, though continued to have an excellent performance status, and he was ultimately switched to Campath therapy.
He did have resolution of his lymphocytosis, and his white count has come down nicely, but did not have much in the way of response in terms of reducing his bulky lymphadenopathy.

No acute infarct or abnormal intracranial enhancement   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57-year-old gentleman with CLL and large cell transformation ([**Doctor Last Name 6261**]) s/p MURD SCT on [**3-10**], recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to rehab, now readmitted for increased diarrhea, abdominal pain, and waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status.
EEG was negative for seizure activity.
BILATERAL SUBDURAL HEMATOMAS:  A CT head from [**9-7**] showed small bilateral hematomas.
A repeat head CT on [**9-9**] showed no interval change in the hematomas.
Possibly secondary to an endocrine source, but patient is on steroids and a cortisol stimulation test would be inaccurate.
Thyroid studies were consistent with a sick euthyroid picture.
His hematocrit remained stable during these bleeding episodes.
Patient's hematocrit remained in the low 20s throughout admission, and he was transfused on a "as needed" basis.
We tried to keep his platelets above 30-40 in light of GI bleeding and subdural hematomas.
His urine output increased appropriately.
Overnight he was placed on a bair hugger and his temperature increased to the 96 range rectally.
After his initial warming his temperature remained around 96 on the bair hugger and he was deemed medically stable for transfer back to the floor.
Finger BS was in the 130s.
He was briefly started on norepinephrine for blood pressure support.
The underlying etiology of his altered mental status was unknown, as multiple blood and urine cultures exihibited no microbial growth.
Head CTs repeated on [**10-27**] and [**9-19**] showed no interval change in his subdural hematomas and no new intracranial hemorrhage.
A full infectious work-up for mental status change revealed no acute pathology so MRI was performed.
MRI done on [**9-20**] did not reveal any additional abnormalities.
Neurology was consulted, repeat EEG was done on [**9-20**] but this showed low voltage background consisting of diffuse slow polymorphic delta activity.
