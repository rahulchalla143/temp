While admitted, the patient had at least 2 tonic clonic seizures, which is abnormal for her.

EEG ([**6-20**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG monitoring study due to one seizure characterized clinically by behavioral arrest and electrographically by electrodecrement and fast activity over the right hemisphere.
The remainder of the study showed frequent multifocal left hemispheric epileptiform discharges mainly in the left temporal and central regions as well as occasional right central and temporal epileptiform discharges consistent with multiple active underlying epileptogenic foci.

*ENDOCRINE: Endocrine was consulted and her Hydrocortisone was increased to 25 [**Hospital1 **] for the first two days of hospitalization, however this was generally empiric to cover her for potential infection or increased seizures and not meant to specifically improve her temperature stability.
A screening WBC, UA and CXR would be reasonable if there was any other clinical concern for infection (O2 demand while awake, change in HR or RR, etc),  *PULMONARY: O2 sats were monitored and she was given supplemental O2 as needed (hx of OSA not on CPAP).
There were a few nights when her O2 sat would dip into the low 90s, high 80s and she was placed on nasal cannula.
consideration should be given for a screening CBC, CXR and UA.
If these are normal, her temperature fluctuations should be treated with regular NSAIDs.
Plan for seizures: - wipe [**Hospital 15741**] magnet for any seizure - please keep record of all seizures and bring to any neurology/epilepsy appointments - seizure precautions - Ativan prn for any seizure longer than 5 minutes or more than 3 in one hour  Medications on Admission: Lamictal 400 mg daily 8am/350 mg at 8pm Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (8am, 8pm) zonisamide 350 mg daily at 8pm ativan 0.5 mg Q HS synthroid 112 mcg daily Cortef 15 mg qAM (8am), 10 mg qPM (4pm) progesterone 100 mg TID tums metamucil, senna, colace vitamin C, D, MVI tylenol prn  Discharge Medications: 1.

She was admitted to the ICU where an extensive infectious work-up was negative.
consideration should be given for a screening CBC, CXR and UA.
If these are normal, her temperature fluctuations should be treated with regular NSAIDs.
