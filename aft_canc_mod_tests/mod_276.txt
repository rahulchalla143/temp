On postoperative day one, the patient was noted to have an abnormal duplex ultrasound and an angiogram demonstrated a hemodynamically insignificant 40 percent stenosis of the hepatic artery.
Over the subsequent week, the patient had improving Doppler ultrasound studies and was treated for acute allograf rejection with steroids.
However, his liver function tests increased and a repeat duplex ultrasound demonstrated decreased wave form and lack of arterial flow within the hepatic parenchyma.
Angiography demonstrated a near-complete occlusion of the hepatic artery near the anastomosis with a small amount of clot on either side of the anastomosis, but there was still preserved flow.
