Blood cultures were taken.
Chest radiograph demonstrated no acute process.
CT head without contrast demonstrated large left frontal extraxial mass, with associated mass effect.

- Outside Hospital CT Head without contrast [**2107-2-6**]: Prelim read: Large left frontal extraxial mass, with associated mass effect, and djacent white matter edema.
- CT head without contrast: There is a 5.6 x 6.5 cm extra-axial mass which is relatively homogeneously hyperdense without calcifications centered in the left frontal convexity and exerting mass effect on the adjacent frontal lobes bilaterally with a small amount of surrounding edema.
MRI with contrast is recommended for further evaluation.
[**2108-2-8**] - CTA Head: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Redemonstrated is a large extra-axial left frontal mass measuring 7.1 x 6.5 x 6.0 cm (CC x AP x transverse).
CTA HEAD: There is mild calcific arteriosclerosis of the carotid siphons.
The regions of low intensity within the mass are better seen today compared to the prior examination and likely represent regions of cystic degeneration.

Her CXR was negative.
UA was negative and Ucx showed yeast, likely [**2-22**] colonization given Foley catheter.
Blood cultures were no growth to date.
ABG showed mild respiratory alkalosis but PaO2 > 80% is less suggestive of PE.
MI was ruled out given negative cardiac enzymes and EKG.
TSH was within normal limits.
MCV 82, borderline low.
Iron studies shows Fe/TIBC ratio to be 5%, Fe is low, MCV/RBC ratio ~ 20, and ferritin is unexpectedly low.

Her initial EKG showed elevated J points in V2-V4 and small [**Doctor Last Name **] waves.
Her Hgb was also elevated as expected with her initial temperature.
Her temperature returned to goal at the end of [**2108-2-6**].
Her temperature was noted to be 94.4.
A bear hugger was initiated and her temperature returned to 99.
Her troponin remained flat.
Her CK level peaked at 2109 on [**2108-2-7**] at which time Crt also peaked to 0.8.
She was given IVF to maintain urine output of 200-300 ml/hr.
Her CK trended down to normal by [**2108-2-11**].
She was treated with IVF with urine output goal of 200-300 ml/hr, and her creatinine was 0.5 on the day of her surgery.

She tolerated the procedure well and went directly to the ICU for Q1 hour neuro checks and strict BP control to <140.
She underwent an MRI which showed resection of the mass.
Her blood sugar was checked and found to be 29.
She quickly responded with a blood sugar of 230 and was back to baseline neurologically.
The remainder of her blood sugar checks on [**2-22**] were in the normal range.
Her neurological exam remained intact, and she remained on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
-On [**2-23**] [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for assistance in managing her blood glucose leveles which have been fluctating as well as for assistance in long term management as her HgbA1C was 13 upon admission.
A KUB was ordered, which demonstrated no acute abnormality.
