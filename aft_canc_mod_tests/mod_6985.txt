The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are within normal limits.
Brief Hospital Course: 69yo female with breast and lung cancer on active treatment, who presented with orthostatic symptoms in the setting of 12 point drop in HCT to 14 and BRBPR noted on rectal exam.
An NG lavage was negative.
The patient was initially admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment.
She received a total of 4 units PRBC (1 in ED), 2 units platelets, and 1 unit plasma (all in ED), with rise in HCT to 33.4 from a nadir of 13.7.
Platelets rose from 37 to 152, and were >200 at time of discharge.
An EKG was checked and showed no evidence of ischemia, and cardiac enzymes were negative.
Serial HCTs were stable so the patient was called out to medical oncology floor.
HCT peaked at 38.0 on [**2153-9-1**], but was slowly trending down again prior to discharge (32.5 on day of discharge [**2153-9-4**]).
She will have VNA services at home, and her HCT will continue to be closely monitored.
There was initially some concern for pulmonary edema in setting of transfusion, however CXR did not show evidence of overt edema or consolidation.
Of note, CXR did show bilateral pleural effusions.
She also maintained sats in the mid-90s on room air following ambulation.
Her counts were closely monitored in setting of recent chemo, and as above she was transfused with both PRBCs and platelets during this admission.
The patient's anti-hypertensives were held during the admission, especially given hypotension and acute bleeding on presentation.
She should have her blood pressure monitored in the outpatient setting, with her anti-hypertensive regimen adjusted accordingly.
