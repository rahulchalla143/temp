Cardiac Cath ([**4-/2128**]): 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed minimal disease of the LMCA, widely patent prior LAD stents, mild restenosis of OM1, and 100% occluded RCA that fills via LCx collaterals.
Arterial bypass angiography revealed 100% occluded SVG->R-PDA.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated and equalized right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP, mean PCWP, and LVEDP of 20 mm Hg.
Systemic arterial pressure was moderately elevated.
Cardiac index was preserved at 2.7 l/min/m2.
Left ventriculography revealed 1+ mitral regurgitation and LVEF of 50% with inferior hypokinesis.
EKG ([**2128-10-14**]): Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing  of [**2128-10-7**] the inferior ST-T wave changes are not as apparent.
CT chest/abd ([**2128-10-14**]): No evidence of focal fluid collection in the abdomen or pelvis to suggest an abscess.
Bilateral LENIs ([**2128-10-15**]): No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
Echo ([**2128-10-15**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-4-16**], left ventricular systolic function is now depressed.
CXR [**2128-10-18**]: Moderate left pleural effusion with subpulmonic component slightly increased from previous imaging on [**2128-10-15**].
The patient also had a CTA to rule out PE.
Low dose metoprolol was restarted as patient's blood pressure stabilized at baseline systolic values of 90s-100s.
Chest CT revealed a left-sided pleural effusion.
CXR on [**10-18**] showed moderate left lower and middle lobe effusion, slightly increased from previous imaging on [**10-15**].
Saturations remained in low 90s on 4L NC, which is his home O2 regimen.
Fever: Patient presented with fever, but given negative blood and urine cultures, and no consolidation on CXR, infectious etiology was not thought to be the precipitant.
Acute renal failure: The patient presented with acute renal failure and a creatinine elevated to 2.3 on presentation.
Over time, the patient's creatinine gradually trended back down to normal.
NSTEMI: The patient presented with a troponin of 0.60, CKD 258 and EKG with worsening TWI and ST depressions suggesting ACS although MB fraction was low.
Enzymes were cycled and CK peaked at 477.
Hx PE/DVT: off coumadin but INR 1.8 on admission.
LENIs were negative for DVT.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
20. oxygen Home O2 by nasal canula at 3-4L/min at all times.
Kidney function back to baseline, saturating at baseline on home O2 requirement, and blood pressure to baseline 90s systolic.
Due to hypotension, your cardiac enzymes, liver function, and renal function all showed evidence of temporary hypotension, which resolved with IV fluids and holding your blood pressure medications.
You are being dischared on a lower dose of your blood pressure medication: please take metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID.
