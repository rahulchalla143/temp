A skeletal survey showed a right distal humeral metastatic lesion as well.
A CT head to look for increased ICP was done and was negative and additionally the known cerebellar lesion seen on MRI was not seen.
Patient had CT torso while in the unit which showed adynamic ileus, no large/small bowel obstruction, new pulmonary, mesenteric, right adrenal metastases.
Patient was transferred to the floor on [**2-10**] with NGT which is now clamped with low residuals of about 100 cc every four hours.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter in the urinary bladder.
[**2-8**] ct head  FINDINGS: There is no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or change in the size of the ventricles.
Her abdominal exam remained with some slight tenderness in the LUQ and periumbilical region, but there was no rebound or guarding.
She appeared clinically volume overloaded, although CXR was difficult to interpret [**12-31**] her size.
She also had audible wheezes on exam although she states she has no h/o asthma or COPD.
## Rad Onc: attempt was made to get an MRI to prepare the patient for SRS.
Rad onc decided that her brain met was not critical at this time and the pt could possibly undergo the MRI at a later date when she was feeling better.
Her BP should be monitored and if it trends back up the ACE and BB should be restarted.
## ID: Pt had a urine cx with enterococcus and GPC.
No evidence of bacteremia - blood cultures were negative.
Her K was stable after adjusting her TPN accordingly.
She may need further adjustments to keep up with her electrolytes.
