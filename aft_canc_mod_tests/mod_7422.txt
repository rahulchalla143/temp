He was loaded with Dilantin, and his INR was immediately reversed with FFP and Vit K for a goal INR < 1.4.
He was extubated in the morning, and on his exam he was following commands and MAE.
A Head CT with contrast on [**11-13**] demonstrated a right temporal hamorrhage and was read as having no underlying mass.
