CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2116-5-14**] 4:16 AM FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2116-5-15**] 4:09 AM FINDINGS: Mild and hazy opacities in right lower lung is either atelectasias or combination of small effusion and atelectasis, unchanged over last 24 hours.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2116-5-15**] 4:45 PM FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip at the clavicular level, approximately 6.2 cm above the carina.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2116-5-16**] 4:36 AM IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**5-9**] through [**5-15**]: Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion and small right pleural effusion have worsened.
On [**5-15**], he continued to have afib with RVR into the 140s, with a Hct drop to 19 and a developing flank/bacl hematoma.
The hematoma drained 1500-1700 cc and patient transferred back to TSICU.
Digoxin was initiated and within 24hrs his HR was well controlled with resting rates in the 70s-90s from 120s-150s prior to Digoxin.
The rehab facility was given instructions to restart his home dose of Valsartan and Furosemide with careful monitoring of his kidney function and blood pressure.
Furosemide 20mg daily and Valsartan 320mg daily should be restarted in [**12-30**] days with careful monitoring if his renal function and blood pressure daily 3.
We increased the dose of two medications to help decrease your heart rate and added a medicine called Digoxin for heart rate control as well.
