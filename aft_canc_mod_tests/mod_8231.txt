She says that on the day prior to admission, while walking with a home physical therapist, she felt extremely weak and her pulse was found to be 40, with a BP of 85/40, per report from the patient.
She came in for her scheduled echo on the day of admission and again felt lightheaded.
Her pulse was noted to be as low as the 30s at times, and she was sent to the ED.
The patient denies recent medication changes, and says that her weight has been stable.
In the ED her HR ranged in the 30s to 50s, with sbp 80-100.

Echo [**2158-4-6**]:  Conclusions: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
CXR [**4-6**]:  IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
A follow-up PA and lateral set of radiographs might be helpful if there is continuing clinical concern for pneumonia.
EKG [**4-6**]:  Sinus bradycardia with top normal P-R interval of 200 milliseconds.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2156-11-11**] cardiac rhythm is now sinus mechanism.
Renal US [**4-7**]:  RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 9.7 cm.
EKG [**4-7**]:  Sinus bradycardia.
CXR [**4-9**]:  Temporary transvenous femoral pacemaker terminates in the region of the tricuspid valve.
CXR [**4-10**]:  IMPRESSION: Satisfactorily placed cardiac pacemaker.
R Hip x-ray [**4-12**]:  IMPRESSION: No evidence of right hip fracture.
EKG [**4-12**]:  Atrial paced rhythm.
Intraventricular conduction delay - probable atypical left bundle branch block.
CXR [**4-13**]:  IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
In brief, she had an AV pacer placed in house, with normalization of her blood pressure and renal function subsequently.
She was hypotensive to systolic of 80s on admission, however asymptomatic, and was therefore kept on the floors overnight with an attempt at bringing up her blood pressure with IVF, and awaiting clearance of the beta blocker.
Unfortunately the following morning she was becoming hypoxic from fluid overload, and her heart rate had not improved.
The patient was therefore transferred to the CCU, where she was started on a dopamine drip with little resultant increase in blood pressure or heart rate.
2) Pump:  Her echo on admission showed normal EF, however it may actually be lower given her MR.  She had massive LE edema, with chronic changes, however this did improve significantly during the hospitalization, implying that she was volume overloaded on admission.
The patient was hypotensive even on the dopamine (although this was likely [**1-4**] inability to increase the heart rate), and was given large amounts of fluids to maintain her BP while in the CCU.
Shortly after pacer placement she began auto-diuresing (polyuric phase ATN--see below) and became quite negative (4.6L Urine output on [**4-10**]).
However, on transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] she remained fluid overloaded by exam and CXR and therefore received 1 more dose of IV lasix prior to being switched over to her usual daily dose of 40 mg PO BID, which she will be discharged on.
She had an oxygen saturation of 98% on RA on the day of discharge, and did not desaturate with ambulation.
4) Acute renal failure:  Her creatinine had increased from 1.8 in [**11-5**] to 3.3 on admission, most likely in the setting of decreased renal perfusion from hypotensive bradycardia.
Upon pacemaker placement, her urine output improved and her creatinine decrease back to around her baseline of 1.6 - 1.8.
Given that her kidney has just recovered, she was sent home on half of her usual dose of lisinopril (20 mg daily) - additionally, her blood pressure was well controlled on the lower dose.
6) Anemia:  The patient was anemic throughout the hospitalization, with hct ranging around 30.
Given that her renal function has improved markedly since her pacer placement, to 1.4 which is better than it has been in over a year, she may not continue to require epogen.
She will have her hematocrit checked by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] when he sees her in clinic,  and monthly thereafter while she remains on the epogen.
7) R Hip Pain:  The patient complained of R hip pain with weight bearing, however there was no tenderness on palpation of the region, and a hip x-ray was negative for fracture.
Coumadin 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day: The coumadin clinic will change your dose according to your blood tests.
This medication will help to keep your blood level up.
