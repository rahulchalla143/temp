He also received two units of PRBCs for a post-operative hematocrit drop from 33.1 to 24.3.
These interventions resulted in stabilized blood pressure, improved urine output, and good hemotacrit response with a discharge hematocrit of 30.5.
On POD#6, the JP drain was discontinued, and staples were emoved with steri-strips placed.
The patient's blood sugar was monitored regularly throughout the stay; sliding scale insulin was administered when indicated and the patient was started on long-acting Lantus when tolerating diabetic clears.
