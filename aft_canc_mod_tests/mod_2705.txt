G0 referred to triage for evaluation of increasing abdominal girth, lower extremity edema.
She was seen at [**Hospital3 **] for evaluation, and had a transabdominal ultrasound [**1-3**] (pt refused transvaginal u/s) which showed 2 large fundal pedunculated fibroids.
The pt was originally scheduled for OR w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] next week, but was referred for evaluation presently given rapidly progressing physical findings.

The CT demonstrated two dominant and large pelvic masses, the right measuring 11.7 x 18.5 x 22.0 cm in size.
Given the question of stomach-thickening on CT scan, GI was consulted to rule out a GI primary prior to proceeding w/ an exploratory laparotomy.
The pt underwent an EGD on HD#2 at which point an ulcerated, fungating and infiltrative mass w/ malignant appearance was noted in the stomach body and cardia.
On [**2163-4-13**], the pt was taken to the OR and an exploratory laparotomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and peritoneal biopsy were performed.
The pt did receive a large amount of IV fluids intraoperatively, and a CXR obtained in the PACU demonstrated moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions.
