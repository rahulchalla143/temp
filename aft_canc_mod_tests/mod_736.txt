[**2136-6-27**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**6-22**], there is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, suggestive of pleural effusion.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
[**2136-6-16**] CT LEFT PROX LEG: Sclerotic foci in the right L5 vertebral body (2:7) measuring 10 mm (previously measuring 9 mm), left ilium (2:7) measuring 13 mm (previously measuring 14 mm), left greater trochanter mixed lytic and sclerotic (2:57) measuring 5 mm (prior measuring 5 mm) and left proximal femur mixed lytic/sclerotic (2:67) measuring 13 mm (prior measuring 11 mm) are essentially unchanged in size to slightly increased in appearance compared to the prior examination.

MRI [**2136-6-17**] demonstrated inflammation of his left iliopsoas muscle and a left hip effusion.
Infectious Disease was [**Month/Day/Year 4221**] and Interventional Radiology aspirated the left hip, which showed a WBC > 20,000 and GPCs (eventually speciated to MSSA).
Repeat MRI did not show any remaining joint effusion.

Echo [**2136-6-21**] negative.
Repeat ESR and CRP still elevated.
Repeat cultures no growth to date.

However, MRI revealed a severe infection of the hip joint (septic arthritis) and surrounding muscles (myositis).
Wound Care: - Keep Incision clean and dry.
Enoxaparin (Lovenox) 70mg subcutaneous injection 2x a day until warfarin (Coumadin) is therapeutic (INR 2.5-3.0).
