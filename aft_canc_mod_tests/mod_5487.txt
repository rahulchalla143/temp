The WBC rose today, however, and an abdominal CT was planned, but the pt became acutely hypotensive, tachypneic, and diaphoretic this morning.
EKG showed q waves and 1 to 1.
Labs showed CPK 68, Trop 3.570, Cre 2.8, lactate 1.9.
ECHO with LVEF 30-35% with akinesis of the inferior, inferoseptal, and inferolateral walls (no priors for comparison).
With a diagnosis of acute inferior myocardial infarction, the patient is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 86**] for cardiac catheterization.

[**11-12**] ECHO - EF 35% 12/13 CXR - some increase in the lung volumes [**11-13**] RUQ US - large amt of R intraperit ascites.
[**11-14**]: CT abdomen: anastomatic leak; pelvic drain superficial, likely just subq [**11-16**] CXR: continued opacification in the retrocardiac region consistent with volume loss in the left lower lung [**11-17**] ECHO: similar to prior study from [**11-12**].
LVEF 35% 12/18 CXR: redemonstration of small pleural effusions and increased density in the retrocardiac area c/w atelectasis or consolidation.
[**11-18**] CXR: No significant interval change [**11-18**] KUB: Limited study demonstrating findings consistent with ascites [**11-19**] CXR: Small stable bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectases with continued mild pulmonary edema [**11-21**] CXR: Increased bilateral pleural effusions, increased moderate pulmonary edema [**11-22**] CXR: maybe mild increase in extent of R pleural effusion.
[**11-23**]: kidney US shows: no hydronephrosis and color Doppler flow to the kidneys bilaterally [**11-25**] CXR: no other relevant changes .

Brief Hospital Course: The patient was transferred from [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 86**] for management of the MI, for which he underwent a cardiac catheterization involving placement of 5 bare-metal stents by interventional cardiology on [**2181-10-24**].
The following day an abdominal CT showed a pre-sacral abscess insufficiently controlled by the operatively-placed JP drain, for which a CT-guided pigtail catheter was placed by interventional radiology on [**2181-10-26**].
The patient's mental status was slow to awaken, Head CT on [**10-29**] was negative for acute pathology, all sedation and narcotic medication was held, and eventually his mental status improved to permit extubation, and eventually transfer to the floor on [**2181-11-6**].
High ileostomy outputs revealed CDiff enteritis, for which IV Flagyl and later vancomycin via both NGT and enema (via the distal limb of the ileostomy) were instituted.
LFTs were mildly elevated, with INR ~2.0; a RUQ U/S was negative and presumably due to malnutrition and sepsis.
A gastrograffin enema on [**2181-11-7**] revealed no anastomotic leak; the JP drain was subsequently discontinued.
A bronchoalveolar lavage revealed a klebsiella PNA, resistant to zosyn, so the zosyn was switched to cefepime.
Abdominal CT scan revealed persistence of the the anastomotic leak, a residual sacral collection, and dislodgement of the pigtail drain.
The recent CT also revealed large-volume ascites; abdominal exam revealed significant distension and the ventilator pressures were increased as well.
[**Name (NI) 1917**], pt developed worsening abdominal distension as well as grossly bloody ileostomy output, with a Hct that was now 17 from 27, and rising pressor requirements.
The ileostomy output ceased but he developed worsening abdominal distension, increasing peak inspiratory pressures, increasing pressor requirements, consistent with an abdominal compartment syndrome.
He was taken emergently to the OR on [**11-16**] for decompressive laparotomy, evacuation of 6500cc of clot, but no bleeding source could be identified; no bowel ischemia was noted.
In light of holding the aspirin and plavix, cardiac enzymes were cycled and noted to be rising.
Echocardiogram revealed no evidence of new MI and cardiology consult agreed, with recommendation to resume antiplatelet therapy once able, which was done one week later.
Later, his renal function declined with rising creatinine and progressive oliguria, leading to worsening volume overload.
