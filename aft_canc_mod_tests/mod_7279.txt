When the patient is able, an ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation of this finding.
This finding is abnormal for the patient's age, and when the patient is able, pelvic ultrasound should be performed for evaluation of this finding.
If there is a prior history of malignancy, a 3 month CT is recommended for followup.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST 1.
Again, pelvic ultrasound may be useful for further evaluation once the patient is able.
Consider a followup examination with diffusion-weighted images.
Infectious etiologies were ruled out on the night of admission as lumbar puncture revealed no organisms and minimal white cells (2).
MRI revealed only bilateral thalamic lesions consistent with infarcts vs. Wernicke's, however neurology consultants felt that decreased level of consciousness was more likely due to diffuse anoxic brain injury endured during episode prior to presentation.
After several days of continuous EEG, which showed no signs of seizure.
