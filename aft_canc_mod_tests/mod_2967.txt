In [**2-/2130**] (about one year post transplant) a CT evaluation revealed recurrent disease in her chest and abdomen.
Anterior mediastinal adenopathy was in the field of prior radiation.
She underwent a biopsy of her anterior mediastinal adenopathy that revealed recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Extensive retroperitoneal adenopathy that is better assessed on a recent PET CT. .
[**5-17**] CXR IMPRESSION: Apparent slight enlargement of bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, which may be accentuated by lower lung volumes on the current study.
[**5-18**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-4**] through [**5-17**].
[**5-22**] CT chest w/o contrast IMPRESSION:  1.
[**5-23**] CXR IMPRESSION: 1.
[**5-30**] CXR IMPRESSION: Mild improvement in left upper lung aeration.
[**6-1**] CXR IMPRESSION: 1.
[**6-14**] CT w/o contrast of chest, abdomen and pelvis IMPRESSION: 1.
Multiple mediastinal and chest wall masses, relatively unchanged, but new pulmonary nodules in the right middle lobe are identified.
[**2131-6-14**] CT head w/o contrast IMPRESSION: Bilateral frontal subcortical white matter hypodensity, more prominent on the left.
MRI of the brain without and with gadolinium is recommended for further evaluation.
Her donor is a male who is CMV positive with blood type A+.
Her Mini allo-MUD [**Date Range 3242**] occurred on [**2131-5-22**].
A CT chest continued to show progression of the pt's lymphoma, and given the pt's high tumor burden and poor prognosis, lack of further options for treatment, and persistent respiratory failure, the decision was made during a family meeting to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].
Furthermore, the pt was grossly positive during her length of stay which also likely contributed to inability to wean off vent.
A LP done by IR on [**6-20**] was significant for a bloody tap not concerning for bacterial infection; however all viral cultures eventually came back no growth.
CT and MRI of brain were both concerning for PML/encephalitis/toxicity from chemotherapy.
A repeat MRI showed decreased instensity of parietal lobe abnormality; per neurology, pt's mental status changes likely [**12-28**] reversible luekoencephalopathy.
The pt had several episodes of hypotension during CVVHD and was unable to be transitioned to HD during hospital course.
