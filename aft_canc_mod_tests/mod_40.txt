Chest x-ray obtained in the AW showed mild failure and a retrocardiac opacity.
Blood cultures times two were obtained and he was given one dose of Levofloxacin.
His initial ABG was as follows:  7.49/32/38.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs, temperature 103.0 (rectal), pulse 109, blood pressure 98/44, respiratory rate 26, O2 saturation 96% on 15 liters partial non rebreather mask.
Extremities, 1+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally, trace bilateral pitting edema up to the knees.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 21.5, hematocrit 41.2, platelet count 311,000, neutrophils 92%, bands 7%, lymphs 0%, basos 1%, sodium 137, potassium 4.5, chloride 100, CO2 20, BUN 33, creatinine 1.7, glucose 100.
PT 20.7, PTT 41.5, INR 2.8.
Urinalysis, yellow, clear, specific gravity 1.014, no nitrites, no red blood cells, no white blood cells, no bacteria, no yeast.
Chest x-ray #1 perihilar edema bilaterally, #2 left retrocardiac opacity, effusion vs infiltrate.
His oxygen saturations were in the mid to high 90's on this and his tachypnea began resolving quickly.
The patient was ruled out for an MI by cardiac enzymes and serial EKG's and he was started on 500 mg IV q d of Levofloxacin.
His blood pressure in the MICU was initially 80/40 and there was concern that central access would need to be placed to evaluate the etiology of his hypotension.
However, his blood pressure responded well to normal saline boluses of 250 cc each.
On day #2 of his admission he began to diurese well on his home regimen of Lasix and his oxygen requirement was quickly weaned from 15 liters partial non rebreather mask to 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen.
On day #2 of his admission the blood cultures came back 4/4 bottles positive for pneumococcus which was pansensitive.
Theory then to explain his acute and severe hypoxia was that his gas exchange was impaired by pneumococcal pneumonia and a transient bacteremia which may have dropped his SVR and caused him to temporarily decompensate from a cardiac standpoint.
In order to further evaluate his cardiac function, a transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained which was most notable for a normal LV wall thickness and cavity size and an ejection fraction of 30-40%.
This is in contrast to an echocardiogram done in [**2146**] which showed an anteroapical aneurysm in the LV and an ejection fraction of less than 20%.
His initial AP chest x-ray was followed up with PA and lateral to further evaluate this retrocardiac opacity and the lateral appeared more consistent with an infiltrate than an effusion.
On day #3 of his admission the sensitivities came back on the blood cultures, strain of strep pneumonia was sensitive to Penicillin and so the patient's regimen was switched to 2,000,000 units q 4 hours of Penicillin G.  The patient tolerated this well, showing no acute allergic reactions.
