Exam revealed jaundice with distended, tender abdomen.
Labs revealed hyponatremia to 122, hyperkalemia to 6.1 (nonhemolyzed), WBC 23.5, Hct 30, lactate 2.2, and Cr 2.5.
LFTs showed Tbili of 13.
Diagnostic paracentesis in the ED was cloudy & blood, w/400 WBC (29%neutrophils 36%lymphocytes 35%macrophages).
Given 1 L NS, ceftriaxone 2gm for suspected SBP (before peritoneal fluid diff returned) and kayexelate for K 6.9.
Urine cultures sent but no blood cultures.
On transfer, vitals were T99 HR103 113/55 20 98%RA.
Additional from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 110525**] and faxed [**Hospital1 2025**] records show he was admitted there in early [**2143-4-14**] for abdominal discomfort, increasing girth, pain.
Extensive workup showed abdominal discomfort likely a result of previously-undiagnosed tuberculous peritonitis.
Peritoneal fluid showed lymphocytic peritonitis, bacterial and AFB cultures negative.
CT Abd/Pelvis findings raised concern for peritoneal TB, so he had surgical laparotomy for omental and peritoneal biopsies which showed granulomatous infiltration, giant cells concerning for TB.
No cough, and chest imaging not suggestive of pulmonary TB so [**Hospital1 2025**] did not get induced sputums.
In addition, all abdominal imaging at [**Hospital1 2025**] (MR, CT, US) showed nodular cirrhotic liver and ascites.
Abdominal CT also showed 3.7 cm lesion in liver concerning for cholangiocarcinoma (CA19-9 66 (normal 0-36)) but IR-guided biopsy was nondiagnostic.
GI consult performed an EGD which showed grade I varices and gastritis, no active bleeding.
Daily labs by DOT VNA on [**5-7**] showed mildly increasing LFTs, tbili 10.1->10.8 alkphos 173 ALT 29 AST 78.

H pylori samples sent (pending)     Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 97865**] is a 40 year old Peruvian gentleman with recent diagnoses of alcoholic hepatitis and TB peritonitis, hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2025**] [**Date range (1) 110528**] for these problems, admitted with increasing abdominal pain and distention after not taking his medications for several days, now being treated for TB peritonitis, with MICU course c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] concerning for HRS and decompensated liver cirrhosis.
Diagnosis initially suspected due to pt's when CT scan was suggestive of peritoneal TB,  TB-spot and quantiferon gold positive and peritoneal/omental biopsies demonstrated granulomatous inflammation.
CT chest at [**Hospital1 2025**] showed "upper lobe pulmonary nodules" not further evaluated.
Sputum AFBs were sent x 3 and were negative for TB.
We discussed his treatment plan with Department of health who requested he stay on treatment for TB until his cultures from [**Hospital1 2025**] return negative which may take many months.
Upon discharge from [**Hospital1 **] he should follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 794**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 110525**] - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 110529**] (cell phone), [**E-mail address 110530**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] infectious disease.
Disease likely longstanding as pt has cirrhosis/nodular liver demonstrated on all imaging studies at [**Hospital1 2025**] (MRI,CT,US).
Na 124, consistent w/recent labs at [**Hospital1 2025**].
Hct stable, ~30.
EGD last week showed only 1 cord grade 1 varices.
His HCT trended down slowly over the course of his hospitalization which most likely was attributed to continued phlebotomy more than GI blood loss.
A diagnostic paracentesis was obtained and was concerning for SBP.
# Abdominal Cellulitis- During this hospitalization the pt developed a cellulitic rash on his abdominal wall that was spreading outside outlined boarders.
