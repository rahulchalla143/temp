The patient was noted at [**Hospital1 **] to have an INR of 8.7 on [**5-30**] with a hct of 19.7 from 32 on [**2200-5-22**] with a BP of 80/p.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
2 PIV and a RIJ CVL were placed, and she received 2L IVF, 5 mg IV vitamin K, 1 unit PRBC, 1 unit FFP, and 40 mg IV protonix.
A CTAP demonstrated a 3 mm right mid-ureteral stone with dilation of the proximal ureter but no hydronephrosis.
GI, urology, and general surgery were consulted, and the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

Pertinent Results: HCT 19 on admission-->s/p 9U prbc-->30 on discharge Creat 2.3->1.9 BUN 69-->30 K 3.9  Mag 1.8 Na 147-->153-->151->147->151-->149-->141->143-->147 INR 5.4->1.1 Alb 3.3 .
Imaging/results: GI bleeding study: [**6-3**]: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were obtained.
A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.
Blood flow images show no active bleeding.
Dynamic blood pool images show no bleeding after 90 minutes.
EGD [**6-2**]: Three sessile polyps of benign appearance and ranging in size from 2mm to 3mm were found in the stomach body.
CT c/a/p [**5-30**]: No RP bleed.
Renal US [**6-2**] CONCLUSION: Echogenic kidneys consistent with chronic medical renal disease.
Head CT [**5-30**]: 1.
CXR [**5-31**]: Decreased lung volumes.
CXR [**6-5**]: prelim: improved basilar opacities.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 year old female with schizophrenia, HTN, CKD III (1.5-1.6), h/o DVT and ?afib on couamdin, chronic DI, PAD admitted for malaise found to have a hct of 19 and active GI bleeding with hypotension/ARF in setting of elevated INR.
Got Vit K and ffp to reverse INR and many units of blood (see below).
Underwent EGD/C-scope [**6-2**] unrevealing of source (C-scope required two preps.
Given HCT still downtrending at that time, ordered bleeding scan on [**6-2**], which was done when pt finally stopped bleeding on [**6-3**], thus was negative.
In total, has required 9U prbc, with HCT now stable X3days w/o any evidence of further bleeding.
In the future if recurrent bleeding, she should undergo repeat cscope or consider pill endoscopy.
Her CT scan showed b/l iliac aneurysm, she has known vascular disease and is followed as outpt, she can f/u with vascular on nonurgent basis.
Trazadone, oxycodone, flexeril all stopped given pt has not required them entire time here and unclear indication.
GI bleeding scan [**6-3**] was negative for acute bleeding, but clinically patient has stopped bleeding as well.
-note, needs repeat EGD and c-scope for biopsy of polyps on discharge.
Per nursing home, most recent creatinine ranging 1.9.
Back on lisinopril 5mg (note creat stable and K has been low), if BP remains elevated, would increase lisinopril to 10mg as outpt .
-repet CXR prelim no infiltrates -likely malaise due to long hospitalization.
-encourage water -tylenol, neurontin -pt does not want oxycodone .
PVD: Holding ASA and pentoxyfilline in setting of GIB, will likely hold on discharge with plan to resume if no further GIB on repeat HCT in 1 week.
