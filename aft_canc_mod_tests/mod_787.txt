She was dialyzed yesterday to dry weight of 60kg.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.7 P 68 BP 83/43 R 22 O2 sat 99% on NRB.
Her lowest systolic 60s improved to the systolic in the 80s.
Labs were notable for calcium 14.2, INR of 7.2.
CXR showed a worsening pleural effusion and CTA chest was performed which demonstrated stable chronic changes and no PE.
TTE in the ED was w/o evidence of large pericardial effusion.
Admitted on [**2151-9-13**] due to worsening renal insufficiency with creatinine of 3.4 and new lung mass causing right lower lobe collapse.
The lung mass was biopsied and thought consistent with amyloid.
She underwent pleurodesis and although had a reaction to the talc procedure, she was discharged home after only about a one-week stay in the hospital.
She was restarted on Coumadin which is being adjusted  to keep INR at 2-3.

Echo The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Blood cultures were sent.
Echo showed normal EF.
CTA was negative for PE.
CT and CXR w/stable chronic findings.
her INR came down from about 7 to 4 over the hospital course.
