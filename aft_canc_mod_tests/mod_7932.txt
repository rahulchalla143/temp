Seen in clinic on [**7-6**] where vitals were HCT 28.5 (down from 32.8 on [**6-28**], and 43.8 on [**5-23**]) where rectal exam showed external hemorrhoids GUIAC positive.
Repeat Hct was 20, so he was referred to the ER.

TAGGED RBC SCAN ([**2153-7-12**]): Blood flow images show normal tracer flow through the large vessels of the abdominal and pelvic vasculature.
Dynamic images of the abdomen show no evidence of GI bleeding.
The lateral pelvis view shows no evidence of GI bleeding.
MESENTERIC ANGIOGRAM REPORT ([**2153-7-12**]): 1.
Empiric embolization can be considered if no extravasation is seen, however, there is CT evidence of possible venous source related to splenic vein thrombosis/varices.
Unfortunately, there are no further endoscopic options that would be helpful.
MESENTERIC ANGIOGRAM REPORT ([**2153-7-12**]): Diagnostic angiography of SMA and celiac axis, which did not demonstrate any active extravasation.
Selective cannulation and diagnostic angiogram of the jejunal branch, which courses towards the gastrojejunal anastomosis and endoscopic clips also did not demonstrate any active extravasation.
Erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance in the body compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy Otherwise normal EGD to Jejunum  Discharge Labs: WBC 2.9, Hct 30.7, plt 96k Hct [**7-22**] 31.0 Hct [**7-21**] 28.5   Brief Hospital Course: 52 yo M with pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple with recurrent disease, diabetes mellitus on NPH insulin admitted with massive gastrointestinal bleeding and acute blood loss anemia due to bleeding from gastric varix.
#Gastrointestinal bleeding/Gastric varix/Acute blood loss anemia/Hypotension: The patient was admitted to the ICU and received 6 units of packed red cells.
Initial upper endoscopy did not reveal the source of bleeding, but the scope could not be advanced passed his surgical anastomosis.
Tagged RBC scan did not reveal bleeding and IR angiogram did not show extravasation.
Patient finally underwent repeat EGD where cyanoacrylate glue was injected on [**7-16**].
Patient received additional 3 units red cell transfusion and hematocrit remained relatively stable following the procedure without need for further transfusion.
However, he remains completely asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable, and importantly his Hct has been stable ~30 for > 3 days.
He will have a repeat Hct checked by his oncologist within the week.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -pt should have follow-up hematocrit drawn later this week by oncology -f/u appt made in [**Hospital **] clinic with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 908**]  Medications on Admission: clonazepam 2mg PO qHS lipase-protease-amylase [Creon] 12,000 unit-[**Unit Number **],000 unit-[**Unit Number **],000 unit Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)
You had an upper endoscopy which showed a bleeding blood vessel near your recent surgery in your stomach.
You were monitored for a number of days and your blood counts were stable prior to your being discharged.
Please call your doctor if you experience any darkening of your stools or see frank blood in your stools or if you develop increased shortness of breath, nausea, chest pains, increased fatigue, or dizziness or lightheadedness or feel as if you are going to pass out as these may be signs that your blood counts are low.
