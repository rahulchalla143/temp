LDH was 1661 and uric acid was 4.2.
She had a CT chest that showed diffuse ground glass opacities in both lungs, thickening of bronchovascular bundle, small right pleural effusion, and  centrilobular emphysematous changes of the upper lobes with pretracheal and subcarinal adenopathy.
Hematology/Oncology evaluated her and a bone marrow biopsy was obtained prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up.
After arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] a repeat CT showed similar findings to those seen on the [**Hospital3 **] scan and she was started on hydroxyurea for her initial leukocytosis of 120,000.
With hydroxyurea her WBC count l WBC 120,000 and her WBC has improved today to 32,000.
She was given lasix 10 mg IV with ~1.5L urine output.
ABG revealed respiratory alakalosis with concomittant metabolic alkalosis.
She was noted to have a temperature of 104 and standing tylenol was ordered.
She underwent a repeat CT thorax that revealed worsening widespread ground glass opacities in the lungs bilaterally, with airspace opacities in the lung bases, right middle lobe, and lingula.
A BAL was negative for PCP and the Bactrim was stopped.
The bronch later was galactomannan positive and the pt was started on voriconazole.
MRI [**8-23**] showed Ring-enhancing lesion suspicious for abscess, lymphoma, or solitary metastasis.

Follow-up chest radiograph is recommended after initiation of treatment.
[**2153-8-17**]: CT head w/o contrast: Compared to CT Head [**2153-8-10**], There is a subtle new hypodensity in the left cerebellum which could represent acute ischemia versus artifact.
[**2153-8-19**] CTA head and neck: Stable left cerebellar hypodensity most compatible with infarction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-8-9**], the findings are similar.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Differential diagnostic considerations remain the same as previously and include abscess, lymphoma, or solitary metastases.
[**2153-9-11**] Chest x-ray ??????
As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities, predominating at the lung bases, but also seen in the lung apices, show minimal regression.

[**2153-9-13**] CT abdomen/pelvis ??????
The adrenal glands, kidneys, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are within normal limits.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV AND ORAL CONTRAST: There is a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.
Localization around the right colon suggests source such as the ascending colon.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Within the visualized lung bases, there is a left lower lobe consolidation, which is increased from [**2153-9-14**].
The stomach, small bowel, and large bowel are unremarkable, with the previously seen ascending colon pneumatosis no longer appreciated.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Urinary bladder, rectum, and uterus are unremarkable.
[**2153-9-20**] CT head ??????
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: Other diagnostic considerations include hemorrhage at site of the enhancing intra-axial lesion, demonstrated on the [**2153-9-6**] MR, or partial thrombosis of the adjacent transverse and proximal sigmoid sinus.
[**2153-9-22**] MRI head ??????
Compared to the prior study, on the post-gadolinium images, the enhancement appears to be slightly less intense compared to the examination of [**2153-8-23**] but is unchanged from the recent MRI of [**2153-9-6**].
This finding is new since the previous MRI examination of [**2153-9-6**].
New bilateral posterior fossa tiny subdurals posterior to the retrocerebellar hemispheres in a posterior cervicomedullary junction since the MRI of [**2153-9-6**] but is seen on the recent CT of [**2153-9-20**].
Lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere which demonstrates blood products and demonstrates enhancement is unchanged compared to the recent MRI of [**2153-9-6**] but has slightly decreased in size from [**2153-9-2**].
[**2153-9-26**] CT head ??????
COMPARISON: The head studies done before, the recent CT head done on [**2153-9-20**] and MR head done [**2153-9-22**].
The left cerebellar lesion detected in the prior MRI, is not visible in the current study and is better evaluated on MR.
[**2153-9-28**] CT chest ??????
FINDINGS: Overall, there has been marked improvement in the multifocal parenchymal consolidations identified in the CT from [**2153-9-12**].
Although this exam is not tailored to evaluate subdiaphragmatic structures, limited evaluation of the upper abdomen partially reveals known hepatosplenomegaly.

While it does appear to be markedly decreased compared to older prior studies, this may be related to differences in technique given that all the other prior imaging was performed at 3 Tesla compared to the current and most recent prior study which were both performed at 1.5 Tesla MRI.
If this is of clinical concern, followup imaging can be performed on a 3 Tesla MRI scanner may help clarify this difference.
Repeat Chest CT [**2153-10-8**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: After arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] a repeat CT showed similar findings to those seen on the [**Hospital3 **] scan and she was started on hydroxyurea for her initial leukocytosis of 120,000.
With hydroxyurea her WBC count l WBC 120,000 and her WBC has improved today to 32,000.
On [**8-11**] the patient had worsening hypoxia with O2 saturation 90% on 50% face mask.
She was given lasix 10 mg IV with ~1.5L urine output.
ABG revealed respiratory alakalosis with concomittant metabolic alkalosis.
She was noted to have a temperature of 104 and standing tylenol was ordered.
She underwent a repeat CT thorax that revealed worsening widespread ground glass opacities in the lungs bilaterally, with airspace opacities in the lung bases, right middle lobe, and lingula.
A Bronchioalveolar lavage was negative for PCP and the Bactrim was stopped.
On [**8-16**] she developed hypertension with bradycardia and suspicion for [**Location (un) 3484**] triad led to getting a head CT.  Pt underwent head CT [**2153-8-17**] which demonstrated L cerebellar lesion, initally concerning for infarct.
Of note she had a head CT on [**8-10**] which showed no acute intracranial process.
No source for thrombus seen on CTA head and neck.
MRI [**2153-8-23**] performed as follow up was concerning for mass or infection rather than infarct.
CSF cultures and galactomannan results were negative.
She also had a repeat bone marrow biopsy on day +14 after her 7+3 induction chemotherapy, which showed 30% cellularity , or poor responce to the chemo.
She had a repeat LP and was started on High dose Ara-C reinduction therapy.
A repeat MRI was performed on [**8-31**] to evaluate if the empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis was helping.
Nuerology and infectious disease were still following the patient and it was decided that she would have a repeat MRI in one week to evaluate change in the microbleeds and another MRI in one month to evaluate for change in the ring enhancing lesion; these were found to be stable on repeat imaging.
The appearance of the lesion on repeat imaging was concerning for fungal infection.
In addition, she was transfused for a platelet level of less than 20 to prevent more microbleeds.
On [**2153-9-12**], she underwent repeat bone marrow biopsy which showed hypercellular marrow (90%) packed with monocytes (leukemic cells) and blasts.
Over the next several days, her physical condition and respiratory status began to deteriorate and she required a non-rebreather O2 mask to maintain oxygen saturation > 90%.
Although her cell counts were slow to recover, she improved significantly over the ensuing weeks, becoming afebrile and no longer requiring oxygen to breathe.
A repeat CSF cytology from [**2153-10-11**] was pending at the time of discharge.
However, per ID recommendations,treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics will be continued until her absolute neutrophil count is above 500.
GIVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE MEDICATIONS TO CAUSE QT PROLONGATION, the patient should have a repeat EKG on MONDAY, [**2153-10-15**].
Her baseline EKG on [**2153-10-11**] showed a QT interval of 398, any increase >25% over baseline should be concerning for QT prolongation and these medications should be discontinued with resumption of other antibiotic coverage.
Further, the patient should have daily serum potassium and magnesium levels drawn, and these should be repleted immediately as needed to prevent any cardiac complications on these medications.
Her hematocrit and platelets were checked daily and repleted with transfusion goals of HCT<21 and PLTs<50 (given subdural hematoma).
She will have close follow-up of these blood levels during her second cycle of chemotherapy.
A repeat head MRI showed stable subdural bleed.
Left cerebellar lesion: Per radiology, this lesion was considered to unlikely be a bleed given stable appearance on MRI > 1 month.
Biopsy of the lesion was deferred given the patient's low HCT and PLTs.
A repeat MRI on [**2153-10-9**] showed that this lesion was stable.
Lung infiltrate: A new left upper lobe infiltrate was noted on a chest CT from [**2153-9-28**].
Repeat chest CT on [**2153-10-8**] showed interval improvement.
A repeat bone marrow biopsy showed that this chemotherapy did not work completely and you still had some cancer cells in your bone marrow.
A repeat bone marrow biopsy showed that the second dose of chemotherpy was also ineffective at controlling the leukemia, so you were started on a third regimen.
Follow-up biopsy then showed some improvement, but still some presence of disease.
You also had a head MRI which showed that you had a lesion in your brain.
Many repeat studies showed that this lesion did not change much over time.
We could not confirm whether this was an infection or something else because that would require us to do a biopsy and this was not possible because of your leukemia.
You experienced abdominal pain on [**2153-9-13**], and a CT scan showed that there was free air in your abdomen, most likely caused by air leaking out of the wall of your colon.
