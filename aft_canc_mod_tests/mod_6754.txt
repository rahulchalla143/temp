At that time, bronchoscopy showed no evidence of active bleeding, though it did show epiglottic mass with ~50 % obstruction.
His temperature was checked and noted to be 99.9.
His heart rate was elevated (150) with a blood pressure in the 80s.
In the ED, temperature was 96.0, HR 77, BP 81/56.
BP fell as low as 72/58 while HR increased to 150s.
CXR showed a RML/RUL infiltrate and the patient was given Levaquin and ceftriaxone.
For atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response, adenosine was attempted x 2 without success.
After cardioversion, blood pressure once again fell to 77/49 and norepinephrine was started.
His blood pressure had risen to systolic in mid-90s.
Norepinephrine was discontinued soon after arrival to MICU, and blood pressure has remained stable in the 90s-120s systolic range throughout the MICU course.
Vitals - T 98.1, BP 94/52, HR 78, RR 12, O2 sat 97% on room air.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2161-3-26**] the rhythm has changed.
MICROBIOLOGY While inpatient, patient had numerous blood cultures, urine cultures and a pleural fluid culture, all of which were negative or no growth to date upon discharge.
CXR [**2161-4-4**] 1.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2161-4-11**] 10:02 AM Increasing right-sided pleural effusion with possible superimposed airspace disease in the right lower lobe.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2161-4-14**] 10:39 AM In comparison with study of [**4-13**], there has been the removal of substantial fluid from the right hemithorax.
Per EP consults, nodal-blocking agents should be avoided given propensity for pauses (had a 30 second pause).
A trigger was called [**4-9**] for sustained heart rate in the 170s and SBP 80s; this resolved with 1 L NS, 10 mEq KCl and 2 gm IV Mg.
From that point onwards, he was predominantly in sinus rhythm with intermittent atrial pacing with two episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR on [**4-12**] which resolved with fluid and Mg.
Prior iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease with low iron, low TIBC and normal ferritin.
Haptoglobin, LDH, total and direct bilirubin were nondiagnostic of another specific etiology.
There was RBC polymorphism with 1+ Hypochr, 1+ Anisocy, 2+ Poiklo, 1+ Polychr, 2+ Ovalocy, 1+ Schisto.
He was transfused 2 unit PRBC on [**4-15**] for Hct to 23 for symptomatic benefit.
Patient and family understand that Hct will likely slowly drift downward upon discharge, but that further transfusions will not be pursued.
# Pneumonia, post-obstructive: Upon admission, oxygen saturation was excellent on room air and he had a normal WBC.
Interventional pulmonary performed bronchoscopy [**4-13**] and placed one bronchial stent, but were unable to place a more distal stent.
Pleural fluid analysis revealed negative Gram stain, labs inconsistent with empyema and a negative fluid culture.
All cultures including blood, urine and pleural fluid were negative or no growth to date upon discharge.
# Hypotension: Triggered [**4-11**] for temp 101.2, Atrial flutter with HR 160s, hypotension to 80s.
He converted back to NSR with a HR 70s.
BP responded to 90-100s.
The patient's blood pressure and urine output then increased.
He had a similar episode after his thoracentesis [**4-14**] after removal of 1.8 L.  This was thought to be secondary to fluid shifts with concomitant poor oral intake.
He resolved to SBP > 100 with these interventions.
