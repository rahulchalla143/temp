He continued to have pain and eventually had a computed tomography scan of the abdomen which showed a 7-cm left pericolic abscess and thickening of the splenic flexure.
He had a follow-up computed tomography which demonstrated another abscess adjacent to the previously drained collection was noted on repeat computed tomography done at this time.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Initial physical examination revealed the patient had a temperature of 99.1, his heart rate was 108, his blood pressure was 176/79, and his respiratory rate was 18.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Rectal examination had normal tone.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION: Initial laboratories significant for a white blood cell count of 16.1.
The rest of his laboratories were within normal limits.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computed tomography of the abdomen showed an increase in the left upper quadrant fluid collection with a significant amount of air and fluid; consistent with an abscess with the percutaneous catheter inferior and posterior, and no communication with between the abscess collection and the percutaneous drain.
An intraoperative gastroscopy was done which showed no mucosal lesion, but the lesion was found to be clearly adherent to the stomach.
He was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit at this time for further monitoring and continued to sundown, but he was easily reoriented.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient reported a history of bronchospasm with beta blockers, and thus was maintained on a diltiazem drip for heart rate control.
A chest x-ray was consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
He subsequently developed a left lower lobe opacity, and a sputum culture grew out multiresistant Klebsiella, for which he was changed to meropenem.
He did have one episode of hypoxia, as previously mentioned, when he was on the floor associated with his acute confusion with a saturation of 73% on room air.
However, on chest x-ray he continued to have a left lower lobe opacity/consolidation consistent with a ventilator associated pneumonia.
Because of a persistently elevated white blood cell count, he underwent an abdominal computed tomography on [**2-17**] which showed some consolidation of the left lung base and a small amount of ascites around the liver, but no evidence of an abscess or drainable collection.
His [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] amylase was 151,230.
He was placed Diamox for this with improvement in his serum bicarbonate from 40 to the low 30s.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consultation is currently pending with an Addendum to follow with their recommendations.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consultation was obtained with recommendations to continue the patient on his oral hypoglycemic medications with close monitoring of his blood sugars and consideration to add a basal insulin such as Lantus should there be problems with glycemic control and continue to hold the Actos.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  He was transfused 2 units of blood preoperatively, and postoperatively remained stable with the exception of transfusion of 2 units for a hematocrit of 26 and 27 from presumed blood loss anemia.
His hematocrit stabilized, and he needed no further transfusions throughout his hospitalization.
Of note, in concordance with his elevated white blood cell count to the 20s, his platelet count continued to rise with a peak at 988.
He was started on aspirin on [**2-19**], and his platelet count is currently trending down.
His intraoperative cultures grew enterococcus, and his culture from his second preoperative percutaneous drain grew gram-negative rods of two morphologies; Proteus and Enterococcus that was vancomycin sensitive.
His sputum culture from [**2-8**] grew Klebsiella pneumoniae that was highly resistant and essentially only sensitive to meropenem to cover him for a ventilator associated pneumonia.
His white blood cell count subsequently decreased from the 20s, he had been 20.9, to 12, down to 10.3, and he defervesced.
