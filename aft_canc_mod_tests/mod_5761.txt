A CXR demonstrated a LLL PNA.
EKG without ischemic changes or peaked T-waves, no QRS widening.
His saturation was up to 92% on 4L, however he was admitted to the ICU given the high oxygen requirement.
ROS positive for cough productive of green phlegm, and chronic chest pain, abdominal (suprapubic), and rectal pain, which are all unchanged.
Past Medical History: 1. prostate ca s/p XRT [**2119**] 2. bladder ca, papillary urothelial carcinoma, high grade (dx in  [**2133-3-20**]), nonmetastatic (negative cystoscopy [**8-24**])  -most recent cystoscopy and bladder resection in [**2138-7-20**] 3. lumbar fracture L5 -- w/multiple steroid injections, previously on chronic opioid therapy 4.
COPD on [**1-22**] L of home O2 (PFTs [**12-27**]: FVC 89% predicted, FEV1 82% predicted and FEV1/FVC 93% predicted) 5.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Admission physical exam VITALS: 98.9, 61, 134/45, 17, 93% on 2-4L.
Pertinent Results: CHEST X-RAY FINDINGS [**2139-2-3**]: Patient's condition required examination in sitting semi-upright position using frontal AP and left lateral projection.
Comparison is made with the next previous chest single AP chest view examination of [**2139-1-24**] as well as a more recent single chest view of [**2139-2-2**].
Already on examination of [**1-24**], the patient had bilateral plate atelectasis but no conclusive evidence for pleural effusions.
On [**2-2**], the portable single view examination demonstrated an increased density on the left base obscuring the diaphragmatic contour and suggesting the presence of an increased atelectasis.
Today's AP and lateral chest views again demonstrate the presence of a diffuse density in the left base, most likely representing atelectasis or pneumonic infiltrate.
Renal ultrasound [**2139-2-2**] IMPRESSION: Mild right pelvicaliectasis and extrarenal pelvis similar to the CT from [**2139-1-25**], but slightly more prominent compared to the US from [**2139-1-2**].
