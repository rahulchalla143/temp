EVALUATION: The examination was performed while the patient was seated upright in the chair in the VICU.
He would likely benefit from an ENT evaluation to assess vocal cord movement and continued speech therapy services in rehab.
[**MD Number(1) 21890**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute limb threat of right lower extremity.
Ultrasound-guided puncture of left common femoral     artery.
Contralateral second-order catheterization of right     common femoral artery.
Serial arteriogram of the right lower extremity.
Hard copy images were stored in the patient's chart for documentation purposes.
Abdominal aortogram was performed.
Contralateral second-order catheterization of the right external iliac artery was achieved with a combination of angled Glidewire and Omni Flush catheters.
Serial arteriogram was then performed to the right lower extremity.
Based on the diagnostic findings, the decision was made to intervene.
Dissection was carried down using electrocautery and saphenous vein was identified by sharp dissection.
A subcutaneous tunnel was created in the lateral aspect of the leg and the greater saphenous vein was harvested via ligating side branches between 4-0 silk ties.
Saphenous vein was removed and an angioscopy with valve lysis was performed with a [**Doctor Last Name 4048**] valvulotome.
A end-to-side anastomosis of the greater saphenous vein graft to the common femoral artery was achieved with a two running sutures of 5-0 Prolene.
Anastomosis completed, Doppler exam of the flow vessel showed excellent signal within the vessel and we were happy with our results.

He presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] with continued rest pain and evidence of limb threat with sensory loss in the right foot.The patient was consented for a arteriogram and possible bypass graft nerve to achieve limb salvage.
Ultrasound-guided puncture of left common femoral     artery.
Contralateral second-order catheterization of right     common femoral artery.
Serial arteriogram of the right lower extremity  After surgery the patient was extubated and transferred to the ICU for recovery.
His hematocrit  which has been in the high 20s after surgery dropped to 23/24%.
Again  his HCT dropped one day later from 27 to 24 %.
Over the course of the next view days the patient required multiple  blood transfusions to stabilize his hematocrit.
An EGD and a colonoscopy were scheduled after his acute alcohol detoxification on the ([**2182-9-3**]).
Colonoscopy was performed one day later and showed a diffuse continuous friability and erythema in the rectum however no bleeding was noted.
His hematocrit was followed up continuously over the next couple of days no more bleeding occurred.
DP and PT pulses on both lower extremities were dopplerable after surgery.
Wound cultures were sent and the patient was subsequently put on Vancomycin Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl.
Temperature greater than 100.5F for 24 hours ??????
Bleeding, new or increased drainage from incision or white, yellow or green drainage from incisions   Followup Instructions: Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3469**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1237**] Date/Time:[**2182-9-19**] 10:15  Call PCP for office visit, to be seen in next 2 weeks.
