Pertinent Results: Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2138-2-19**]    PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION: Indication: Atrial fibrillation Height: (in) 63 Weight (lb): 145 BSA (m2): 1.69 m2 BP (mm Hg): 160/80 HR (bpm): 80 Status: Inpatient Date/Time: [**2138-2-19**] at 15:51 Test: TEE (Complete) Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler Contrast: None Tape Number: 2006W007-0:00 Test Location: West Cath/EP Lab Technical Quality: Adequate     REFERRING DOCTOR: DR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
She was taken to the catheterization lab where she was found to have 3 vessel disease along with her known [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.6cm.
An echocardiogram was performed which revealed severe Aortic stenosis, 3+ mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 55%.
An intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed severe aortic stenosis thus she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels and an aortic valve replacement using a 21mm [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial model 2800 bioprosthesis.
On POD 8 she was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
On POD 12 she underwent a TEE which did not show any evidence of left ventricular thrombus and subsequent D/C cardioversion.
An emergent abdominal CT scan showed a retropertoneal bleed.
Cortisol levels were normal.
A stat head CT was negative for intracranial hemorrhage and her physical exam was unremarkable for fracture or nuerologic insult.
