[**6-20**]: Bone marrow pathology: not finalized [**6-21**]: Bone marrow cytogenetics: pending  Microbiology: [**6-20**]: Blood culture pending [**6-20**]: Urine culture negative [**6-21**]: Blood culture pending [**6-22**]: Blood culture pending [**6-23**]: MRSA screen pending  Imaging: TTE [**6-20**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
CXR [**6-20**]:  Heart size is normal.
CXR [**6-21**] s/p port placement: Interval placement of a right PICC line with the tip in the distal superior vena cava.
In the absence of a stability or clinical explanation for this finding, consideration should be given to further evaluation with CT.  Patchy opacity at the left lung base may reflect an area of patchy atelectasis, although an early pneumonia cannot be excluded.
ECHO [**2165-7-15**]: The left atrium is dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-6-24**], no change.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that 2-4% of cells isolated from this bone marrow express immature antigen, CD34, and myeloid associated antigens CD33 and CD117.
Bone Marrow Biopsy [**2165-7-18**] SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:  DIAGNOSIS:      Hypercellular marrow for age bone marrow with megakaryocytosis, myeloid predominance and left shift in myeloid lineage  Note:  The findings are consistent with recovering marrow post chemotherapy.
The white blood cell count appears decreased.
Platelet count appears increased; multiple large and occasional giant forms are seen.
Differential count shows 55% neutrophils, 1% bands,  22 % lymphocytes, 18% monocytes, 0% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 4% blasts.
Blasts exhibit open nuclear chromatin , 1 - 2 prominent nucleoli and scant amount of light-blue cytoplasm.
Differential (200 cells) shows:  <1% Blasts,  5% Promyelocytes, 15% Myelocytes, 11% Metamyelocytes, 33% Bands/Neutrophils, 0% Plasma cells,  10% Lymphocytes, 25% Erythroid.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of a core biopsy specimen that measures 1.5 cm and length and contains periosteum trabecular bone and bone marrow elements.
Several small interstitial aggregates comprised of small lymphocytes are present and account for less than 5% of marrow cellularity.

# Newly diagnosed AML: blast count was as high as 80k at presentation.
Blast count was as high as 60%.
Repeat echo on [**2165-7-15**] showed unchanged LVEF.
Otherwise, patient received blood cultures and urine cultures that were all negative.
Following chemotherapy, as his counts approached nadir, he developed low grade fevers less than 100 F, but CT chest showed only resolving cryptogenic organising pneumonia.
His fevers resolved and he remained covered with broad spectrum antibiotics until the end of his hospitalization.
He was closely monitored for hemodyamic stability through 4 days of idarubicin administration without cardiac events.
# CHF - TTE on [**6-20**] showed EF 40-45% with anterior wall motion dyskinesis.
Pt developed chest pain on [**6-21**], with unchanged EKG and troponin that stayed flat at 0.05.
He was transfused pRBCs to keep hct >28.
Serial TTEs were performed to monitor for deterioration of cardiac function while on idarubicin.
TTE on [**6-24**] was unchanged from [**6-20**].
Repeat TTE on [**2165-7-15**] showed an unchanged LVEF and no new abnormalities since pre-chemo.
His hemolysis labs were negative.
He was transfused 2U of blood of [**6-25**] and 2U of blood on [**6-27**].
Blood bank was contact[**Name (NI) **] 2 days later about suspicion of TRALI, however his symptoms resolved.
We started you on treatment for this, but your blood pressure dropped and you were transferred to the ICU.
However, your blood pressure and heart rhythm normalized spontaneously without additional treatment and we transferred you back to the [**Hospital1 **] to complete your chemotherapy.
