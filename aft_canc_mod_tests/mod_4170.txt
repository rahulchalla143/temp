Correlation with chest radiograph for evaluation for subdiaphragmatic free air is recommended.
If additional evaluation for free air or air-fluid levels is clinically indicated, then upright view of the abdomen is recommended.
CXR [**11-23**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased.

Transthoracic Echo [**1-18**]: No vegetations seen (adequate-quality study).
In presence of high clinical suspicion, absence of vegetations on transthoracic echocardiogram does not exclude endocarditis.

CT Head [**1-23**]: No acute intracranial pathology, especially no evidence of a new infarct detected.
If there is high clinical concern for an acute infarct, an MRI with DWI can be performed for further evaluation.
BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: [**2146-1-13**] Hypercellular bone marrow with persistent involvement by patient's known acute megakaryoblastic leukemia  Discharge Labs: 143  114  36  108   AGap=12 ------------- 3.1  20  1.0 Comments: Glucose: If Fasting, 70-100 Normal, >125 Provisional Diabetes  Ca: 8.9 Mg: 1.7 P: 2.8 ALT: 24 AP: 233 Tbili: 1.0 Alb: 2.8 AST: 16 LDH: 575 Dbili:  TProt: [**Doctor First Name **]:  Lip:   2.7 > < 35 &#8710;     23.7  N:47 Band:0 L:17 M:2 E:0 Bas:0 Other: 34  Gran-Ct: 1283  PT: 19.2  PTT: 38.8  INR: 1.8   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 467**] is a 71 yo M with a history of AML s/p allo BMT with relapse who presents with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that developed after receiving DLI.
A BM biopsy on [**12-17**] was done and showed recurrence of AML.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**1-13**] showed hypercellular bone marrow with persistent involvement by patient's known acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.
Patient became increasingly somnolent, though arousable and non con CT head was negative for bleed.
Further work up with MRI and LP was not pursued as goals of care were shifted towards comfort given the refractory nature of the patient's disease and his multiple infections.
[**12-10**], he spiked a fever to 101, and a CT abd/pelvis was done.
His Culture data was negative with the exception of C diff.
During that time he had a repeat bone marrow on [**2145-12-17**] which showed recurrence of his AML.
It was initially thought that the fevers were in part due to recurrence but mycolytic blood cultures were positive for malessezia furfur (believed to be associated with TPN and his central line) and patient was treated with line removal and ambisome transiently (stopped secondary to fevers), and then voriconazole/posaconazole.
Repeat imaging showed thickening of the ileum that was concerning for GVHD or infection.
A repeat abdominal CT on [**12-28**] showed resolution of the ileum thickening and colitis.
On repeat chest CT [**12-24**], the pneumonia had decreased in size.
