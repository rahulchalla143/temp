Admission Date:  [**2188-3-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-4-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2124-10-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8790**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left Brachial Plexus Radiation (2 sessions)   History of Present Illness: 63 YO F with metastatic adenocarcinoma, likely from a NSCLC primary, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**3-29**] with her wife after experiencing increasing somnolence for two days and difficult breathing since the evening prior to admission.
Around this time, the pt endorsed some low-grade temperatures, between 100.0 and 100.3.
Further progression of her symptoms led to imaging studies in early [**1-/2188**] that confirmed evidence of widespread disseminated bone metastasis.
It seems based on all imaging studies that she did not have evidence of overt spinal cord compression.
The remaining of her radiographic imaging studies also showed a left upper lobe and left hilar lesion in the lung.
She received and completed [**2178**] cGy of radiation to her right hemipelvis, sacrum, and L5 with concurrent dexamethasone steroid therapy.
The final pathology of her [**2188-3-5**] bone biopsy disclosed a carcinoma (likely adenocarcinoma) with the following IHC profile: positive for CK7 and mammoglobin.
PMH: *extensive skeletal metastises with resultant left upper and lower extremity weakness, pathologic fracture of right acetabulum, presumed spinal instability *s/p XRT to sacrum and pelvis, C6 and T5 *osteoporosis *prior premalignant oral lesions in both her buccal mucosa and the floor of the mouth, treated with topical ablations >10 years ago depression *GERD *allergic rhitis *prior laparotomy for lysis of adhesions after IUD associated pelvic inflammatory disease   Social History: Smoked 1.5 ppd x 21 years.
Physical Exam: On admission: VS: 97.6, BP 111/49, HR 124, RR 18, O2sat 91% Gen: Moderately ill appearing adult female, no acute distress.

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
The patient's wife strongly expressed a desire for care to be directed to patient comfort with minimal testing for diagnostic purposes.
Her hypoxia responded well and her oxygen saturations returned to the low to mid-90s on room air as well as with ambulation.
Given that a recent echo showed a normal EF without signs of diastolic dysfunction, it was thought that her recent chemo (which included avastin) could have created a leaky-capillary syndrome that resulted in pulmonary edema.
The day prior to her discharge, she again developed dyspnea and hypoxia to the high 80s on room air with diffuse crackles on exam.
She responded well to nebs and lasix with a CXR c/w continued volume overload.
Prior to her improvement, her alteration seemed to be most consistent with acute delirium with profoundly reduced attention and concentration.
Further diagnostic testing such as head CT, MRI and/or LP were not completed given HCP-wishes and significant improvement in mental status in the setting of a seemingly clearing delirium.
Appropriate in the setting of possible infection, hypoxia and malignancy however, with a [**Doctor Last Name 3012**] score 7/moderate, concern for a PE was raised.
Further radiation was arranged with a plan for a total of 5 fractionations.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for low oxygen saturations and altered mental status.
It may have been related to the bone medication you received with chemotherapy or from leaky blood vessels from chemo causing lung congestion.
