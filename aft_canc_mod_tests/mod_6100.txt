In the ED, initial vitals were Tmax 102.2, BP: 153/103, HR: 120, O2sat: 98%RA .
Labs were notable for ANC of 36 and elevated liver enzymes with ALT 243, AST 78, AP 260, and a normal T Bili of 1.1 (stable from daily outpatient labs).
Hct was 24.9 and platelets 35K which are also stable from his recent discharge.
In the ED blood cultures were drawn and he was given 2 gm IV cefepime as well as 3 L of IVF .
He underwent CXR which showed atelectasis and question of pneumonia per ED read.
CT abdomen/pelvis was performed given his chronic abdominal pain and demonstrated stable splenomegaly and LAD.
It also showed mildly dilated loops of small bowel which contained oral contrast, which could possibly represent early partial SBO vs early ileus.

Spleen, Omentum, and Liver [**2130-4-11**]: DIAGNOSIS: I.  Splenule (A): Nodule of splenic tissue with extramedullary hematopoiesis and prominent interstitial histiocytes.
Splenic tissue, biopsy (L): Massive splenomegaly with extensive red pulp congestion, fibrosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis (see note 1).
There is extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis throughout with megakaryocytes as well as erythroid islands; erythroid precursors are markedly dyspoietic with asymmetric nuclear budding noted.
B-cell markers CD20, PAX-5, and CD79a highlight few scattered, and occasional loosely clustered B-cells, including a few larger forms.
A subset express bcl-6.
Liver, left lobe, needle core biopsy (J) (reviewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10165**]): 1.
Trichrome stain shows mild portal fibrosis.
V.     Liver, right lobe, needle core biopsy (K) (reviewed by Dr. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10165**]): 1.
Note:  Although several periportal and lobular lymphoid infiltrates are seen, no large cells or L&H variants are noted.
A majority of the lymphocytes are CD3 positive T cells.
-INTERPRETATION Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
SEE NOTE  Native Renal Biopsy [**2130-4-27**]: DIAGNOSIS: Renal biopsy, needle: Consistent with acute tubular injury ("ATN"), see note.
Tubules show vacuolar change, as well as intralumenal necrotic debris and red blood cells; other signs of acute injury, including occasional single-cell necrosis are also seen.
OTHER STUDIES ============== Chest Radiograph [**2130-3-31**]: IMPRESSION: Linear area of increased opacity at the left lung base.
By morphology this is likely atelectasis though an early infectious process is not excluded and should be correlated to the clinical presentation  CT Abdomen and Pelvis W/Contrast [**2130-3-31**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Previously noted hypodensities within the liver are not as well imaged on the current study due to different phase of imaging.
Repeat imaging can be performed to assess for passage of oral contrast into the colon.
CT Chest W/O Contrast [**2130-4-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Hepatosplenomegaly and a small amount of perisplenic fluid, unchanged  MRI Abomen W and W/O Contrast [**2130-4-5**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Dropout of signal in both liver and spleen on longer echo gradient echo imaging, likely due to iron overload from blood transfusions.
Ankle Radiograph [**2130-4-9**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Chest Radiograph [**2130-4-10**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-2**], there is some progressive decrease in opacification at the left base.
Chest Radiograph [**2130-4-17**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-10**], there is now increasing opacification at the left base.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2130-4-18**]: Conclusions Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Chest Radiograph [**2130-4-18**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-17**]: Left lower lobe is still consolidated but volume loss is not as severe.
CTA of Chest W and W/O Contrast [**2130-4-18**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
3.3-cm fluid-filled structure in the right axilla, slightly enlarged compared to the prior study and may represent a necrotic lymph node versus a post-biopsy seroma.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis W/Contrast [**2130-4-19**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
See the MR of [**2130-4-5**] for further details.
Chest Radiograph [**2130-4-22**]: FINDINGS: Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
Given he was neutropenic at the time he was admitted to the oncology service and treated with multiple broad spectrum antimicrobials including cefepime, aztreonam ([**Date range (1) 27094**]), vancomycin([**Date range (1) 22023**]), metronidazole ([**Date range (1) 82515**]), azithromycin ([**Date range (1) 82516**]), and voriconazole ([**Date range (1) 82517**]) and never had abatement of his fevers.
His neutropenia resolved on [**2130-4-7**].
All blood cultures were benign and there was no clear urinary or pulmonary source of infection.
When he developed yet another episode of acute respiratory distress later in the day he was transferred to the intensive care unit where he had a repeat bone marrow biopsy, which along with the returning path from his splenectomy, and the results of his labs (including a greater than assay ferritin level) led to a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
The patient was started on high dose steroids and etoposide per protocol and after first doses, which were adjusted for hepatic and renal dysfunction, was put on twice weekly etoposide and a steroid taper.
With initiation of therapy liver enzymes rapidly declined and fevers resolved.
With the initiation of transplant lab results dramatically improved with liver enzymes and LDH trending downward.
Work up for causes of HLH included assays for HHV5, HSV1, HSV2, EBV, and CMV and all were negative.
Subsequent urinalysis revealed large heme but no RBC's.
Initial concern was for rhabdomyolysis but CK was normal.
The following day as the patient was diagnosed with HLH and his hemoglobinuria was presumed to be due to the massive hemolysis precipitated by that syndrome.
From [**Date range (1) 82519**] Cr also increased from 0.7 to 2.
This was confirmed by urine sediment analysis, which showed muddy brown casts.
Of note, the patient's initial urine studies did show an increased protein/Cr ratio suggesting significant proteinuria, which would be atypical for acute tubular necrosis.
During the first work up showed hypoxia and chest radiograph showed volume loss perhaps suggesting a collapsed lobe.
The nephrologists did a kidney biopsy to make sure there was not another process going on in your kidneys.
The results of this biopsy were still pending at the time of discharge but can be managed as an outpatient.
