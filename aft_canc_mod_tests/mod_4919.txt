Labs: WBC 13.0  Hgb 13.6  Hct 38.9   Plts 239 PT: 11.5  PTT: 24.2  INR: 1.0 Fibrinogen: 263 Na:140   Cl:102    BUN:14    Glu:146 K:4.2    TCO2:24   Cr:0.7  Lactate:2.1 1 Source: Line-cntrl [**1-14**] Troponin  0.41*1 [**1-13**] Troponin  0.55*1 [**1-12**] Troponin  0.46 [**1-10**] Troponin  0.21 [**1-9**] Troponin <0.014   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the Neurosurgery Service in the ICU for close observation.
His neuro exam improved, as he moved all extremities spontaneously off sedation.
His CK/Troponins were closely watched, as his Troponin started to elevate to as high as .46 on [**1-13**].
on [**1-11**] he had an EEG, which was negative for seizure activity.
A repeat Head CT on [**1-12**] demonstrated a stable SDH; however, given the stability and relatively small size of the SDH and the fact that the patient had a non-improving neuro exam, an MRI was obtained.
Regardless, they, too, felt that his CT/MRI findings could not fully account for his poor mental status exam, and felt confident that his exam would improve.
Indeed, on HD #7, the patient's exam began to improve, as he moved his RUE/RLE spontaneously, followed simple commands, and opend his eyes to voice.
His Troponin level had decreased to 0.14.
While in the stepdown unit his exam remained stable on [**2128-1-21**] as he prepared to go to rehab.
His troponin level decreased to 0.04 as well.
Also on this day it was noted that he had thick secretions coming from his trach and as such a sputum culture and CXR were obtained.
