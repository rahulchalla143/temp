EGD ([**2161-10-7**]): A submucosal mass 31 to 28 cm which could be traversed with an endoscope with resistance.
4) Extensive alveolar opacities most pronounced in the right lower lobe which could reflect aspiration or hemorrhage.
Transthoracic Echo [**2161-10-29**]: EF 60%.
Her CT scan on admission was concerning for a hemorrhagic lesion, and CXR for an aspiration event.
She was transfused 4 units PRBC to maintain a Hct >30, and Hct stabilized on the second day of admission.
She underwent bronchoscopy on the second day of admission which showed extrinsic compression of bronchi, blood in the RLL c/w aspiration.
Hct remained stable after PRBC transfusion.
- will request repeat endoscopy from GI tomorrow to evaluate if tumor has grown.
Coagulopathy, INR 1.5 on admit:  Coagulopathy was thought to be nutrional given the patient's poor po intake.
A DIC panel was negative.
Tranfusion of FFP was attempted but failed due to tranfusion reaction.
INR has remained stable 1.4-1.5 since admit.
Echocardiogram showed normal LV function and no pericardial spread of disease causing pericardial effusion.
She continued in sinus rhythm with HR 100-120s on transfer to the floor.
She was subsequently diuresed approximately 3 liters and her oxygenation and tachypnea improved by later that day.
Anti-hypertensives have been held out of consideration for continued blood loss.
In the ICU, the patient has continued to be normotensive to mildly hypertensive with SBP 140-150s during her hospitalization.
COnsider resuming anithypertensives if Hct remains stable.
Pulmonary: Aspiration Pneumonia:  On admission, a large RLL infiltrate was noted on CXR that was concerning for aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, lymphangetic spread versus hemorrhage.
CXR today not sig changed from yesterday  - continue to monitor respiratory rate, fever and wbc count.
