Osteoporosis 6.
Right sided portacath in place no surrounding erythema PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Multiple well healed abdominal scars.
G-tube in LUQ venting green liquid & some CT contrast.
Fluid in the deep posterior pelvis anterior to the coccyx likley within a dilated loop of bowel; however, differentiation between a dilated loop of bowel and a pelvic fluid collection is difficult.
The physical exam and CT findings were concerning for a small bowel obstruction.
Because the CT demonstrated a fairly distal transition point, it was decided to insert an endoscope through the ileostomy in an attempt to decompress the obstruction.
Initial output was coffee ground in quality and she was started on Protonix and the output became bilious.
Over the course of the next day ileostomy output remained very low and the patient's pain increased throughout the day as did her abdominal distension.
Early on POD#3 a CT scan was obtained that demonstrated worsening small bowel dilitation with peristence of the previously identified transition point; small bilateral pleural effusions; and new perihepatic ascites.
After discussion with the patient during which she consented to surgery, she was taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy.
An internal hernia was identified and the source of obstruction repaired.
Postoperatively the patient was recovered in the PACU and indeed remained there overnight for close monitoring given occasional desaturations.
A chest X-ray demonstrated bibasilar effusions/atelectasis as previously seen on CT.  On HD 7, her epidural was removed.
She has episodes of confusion and blood cultures, urinalysis, chest x ray were obtained.
Labs were drawn and electrolytes repleted.
CXR appeared improved from her prior xray.
Her hematocrit was stable at 34 and WBC 9.3.
EKG was unchanged from her prior once on [**2120-3-19**].
A chest xray showed pulmonary edema and her breathing improved with lasix.
On HD 9, her wound began to have purulent, foul-smelling drainage.
Wound cultures grew group B strep.
On HD 11 she underwent a CT scan that showed obstruction but no obvious leak or abscess.
Her INR was checked and returned 9.3.
She received IV Vit K and repeat INR was 1.5.
CXR showed worsening pulmonary edema/opacification and she had increased work of breathing.
She had a CT scan [**2120-3-28**], which showed an abscess, for which she had to undergo intubation and extubation, which was drained the same night w/ 200cc of serousanguinous/purulent drainage.
Her TF were stopped and she was started on clears on [**4-2**].
Her TF were restarted [**2120-4-4**] and she was advanced to a full liquid diet.
On [**2120-4-6**] she had a follow-up CT scan, which showed a persistent 3 cm pelvic fluid collection.
She also had some nausea/vomiting and her WBC count increased to 16 so TF were held for a day.
She was started on abx and her WBC count then decreased and any residual abdominal pain resolved.
She had some nausea from her TFs when they went up to 40.
She will take weights 2x per week on discharge.
