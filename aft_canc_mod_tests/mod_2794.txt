Labs were significant for: bicarb 15 with anion gap of 19, lactate 2.7, rest of BMP unremarkable, HCT 32.2, wbc 9.2 (up from 6 recently) with 92.5%N, INR 1.2, normal LFTS, finger stick, and negative serum tox screen.
Patient was evaluated by neurology in the ED at which time she was awake, but non-cooperative and her exam was limited but was felt to be grossly non-focal.
CT of the head was significant for cerebral edema.
While in the ED patient further decompensated, with GCS of E3V4M (13), AAO x2 but answering questions inappropriately, and became acutely agitated.
She was ultimately intubated given inability to cooperate with exam in setting of AMS.
She had a repeat head CT which was stable.
- [**2127-4-4**] A CT scan revealed a large intra-abdominal mass and a subsequent CT-guided biopsy on confirmed presence of a high-grade peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
Blood work at that time was concerning for recurrence of her lymphoma (LDH 641).
Her postpartum course was complicated by fevers, pelvic fluid collection, and an upper GI bleed due to gastric involvement of her lymphoma which initially delayed her chemotherapy.
HIT testing was negative as was lower extremity ultrasound for evidence of DVT.

CTA showed small submental PE and thought to be new, but patient was not started on anticoagulation [**12-23**] ongoing thrombocytopenia.
On [**2128-10-27**], developed neck pain and arm swelling, with CT showing extensive right IJ thrombus and involvement of subclavian vein, with phlegmon extending down from C3 into the mediastinum, paravertebral and carotids spaces.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2129-5-10**] 5:23 PM .
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2129-5-11**] 12:25 AM FINDINGS:  There is essentially no change in comparison to the recent study, from only the day before with no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or large vessel territorial infarction.
IMPRESSION:  No change in comparison to the study of the day before, with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.
These findings may represent either central atrophy or to underlying communicating hydrocephalus, perhaps related to underlying "aggressive T-cell lymphoma" (history provided for the MR study of [**2128-9-21**]) or its treatment, and should be closely correlated with clinical data.
