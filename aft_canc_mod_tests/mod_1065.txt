[**4-/2112**]: bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed dysplastic basophilic and polychromatophilic erythroblasts, a marked left shift and dysplastic myelopoiesis and abundant hyperchromic megakaryocytes, which initially were felt to be consistent with colchicine toxicity; however, chromosome studies performed on that bone marrow material revealed an abnormal karyotype 15/16 studied cells showed a complex clone with the following anomalies.
His manifestations have been as follows: A. Polyneuropathy - CIDP in [**2099-6-6**]; Painful lower extremity sensory neuropathy and proprioception defects.
B. Organomegaly - Splenomegaly C. Endocrinopathy - Hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, hypocalcemia related to hypoparathyroidism D. Monoclonal gammopathy E. Skin and nail changes - now resolving.

His smear during this hospitalization continued to show atypical cells.
-continue methadone, oxycodone -Continue oxybutinin, pyridium and urojets as needed for the pain -consider urology consult if persists  Neutropenic fevers- no clear source of his fevers.
HCT 19.5 on admission, and was transfused 2 units pRBCs with an appropriate bump in his HCT, which subsequently trended down.
Last Platelet transfusion on [**2112-8-9**] Last pRBC transfusion on [**2112-8-11**] .
The rest of his LFTs were unremarkable, demonstrating a cholestatic picture.
A right upper quadrant u/s was performed that showed no evidence of cholestasis.
Patient was grossly volume overload after his resuscitaion which had resolved at the time of discharge without an elevated JVP or peripehral edema.
On a couple of occasions your blood pressure got low and you were feverish and were treated in the ICU for this.
Monitoring your blood counts and your liver function tests 3.
