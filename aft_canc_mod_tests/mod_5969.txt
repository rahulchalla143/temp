After this splenic injury, she had a CT scan that showed an enhancing 1.5-cm exocytotic left renal mass and this finding was confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging as well.
The patient received 5 liters of intravenous fluids during the operation and had 300 cc estimated blood loss.
After discussion among the Urology team with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**], we decided to have the patient observed in an Intensive Care Unit setting overnight for constant blood pressure monitoring and blood pressure control.
Her blood pressure was under good control on [**6-20**], and she was sent to a regular floor bed.
Her hematocrit was 24.6, but since the patient was making an acceptable amount of urine and was hemodynamically stable, the Urology team decided not to transfuse the patient at this time.
Her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain output was 20 over the previous 24 hours and was minimal overnight, so her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was discontinued.
The patient's urine output dwindled somewhat on [**6-23**], and she required two one time doses of Lasix 20 intravenously to increase her urine output.
Her laboratories came back, and her hematocrit had trended down to 20.9 on [**2122-6-23**].
Her hematocrit came up to 34.6 after the 2 units of packed red blood cells.
