There are pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymphatic nodes, including right paratracheal and left paratracheal, that are not overtly changed from previous examination by size criteria.
This is more prominent compared to previous examinations, and may represent interstitial fibrosing process versus radiation pneumonitis.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2154-2-6**] The left atrium is elongated.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a charming 85 year old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG, COPD on home O2, and NSCLC who was admitted for elective heart catheterization, found to have patent grafts, AS, and elevated LVEDP.
- Pulmonary consultation was obtained and formulated a likely multifactorial etiology, but could not rule out radiation pneumonitis s/p XRT and possibley cardiac catheterization as a possible etiology.
2) Fever- Blood, urine, sputum cultures were unrevealing.
CXR without evidence of focal consolidation, but given evidence for Lung CA progression.
4) afib/flutter/[**Name (NI) 67437**] Pt had a number of cardiac dysrhythmias present during his admission.
