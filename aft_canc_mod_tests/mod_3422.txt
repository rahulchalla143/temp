CT Abd/Pelv [**2150-8-19**]: 1.
Anti-Xa level was drawn after 3rd dose and found to be within range for dosing.
Patient was discharged on day 12 of hospitalization with followup with Heme-Onc ([**2150-8-26**]), Endocrine ([**2150-8-25**]) and GI ([**2150-8-26**]).
MRI negative for brain metastases.
CT Abd/Pelv demonstrated multiple new mesenteric nodules as well as metastatic lesions within the ascending colon and small bowel with no evidence of bowel obstruction.
Due to patient obesity, Anti-Xa level was sent after third dose of Lovenox and found to be within acceptable limits.
Prior Hb 10-12 range without any evidence of anemia prior to 1/[**2149**].
Recent iron studies [**2150-7-28**] more c/w anemia of chronic disease: iron mildly low with normal ferritin and low TIBC.
Retic count not elevated and seems more c/w anemia of inflammation.

We did a test to measure a hormone called cortisol and found it to be relatively low.
During your stay, you also developed a blood clot in your left leg.
Your blood sugars were running low while you were here, so we decreased your Levemir dosing to 20u at night (instead of 34u).
Please check your blood sugars three times a day and bring these numbers to your [**Last Name (un) **] provider at your [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] appointment.
If your sugars are >200 but <300, you can increase your levemir to 24u, if they're >300 but <400 you can increase to 28u, and if they're >400 you should return to 34u.
We would like you to see the GI doctors to possibly get a colonoscopy because of the positive test for blood in your stool.
