The patient was lethargic, somnolent, and had increased work of breathing with an oxygen saturation in the 60s and wheezing bilaterally.
Her arterial blood gas demonstrated a respiratory acidosis and hypocarbia.
She was placed on nasal BiPAP, albuterol and Atrovent Emergency Room, and her oxygen saturation increased to 90% to 91%, and her arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.42, PCO2 of 74, and PO2 of 120.
She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where she was febrile with a temperature of 102.5, and 85% on BiPAP.
Her chest x-ray was clear, hyperinflated lungs, no signs of congestive heart failure but a nasal swab that was positive for influenza.
She was weaned from BiPAP to 2 liters nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 90% to 91% at rest, but had decreasing oxygen saturations to 70% with activity.
On admission, her hematocrit was 55.4 and was 55.4 secondary to her history of polycythemia, and was due for a blood removal the day after admission.
Additionally, she reported abdominal pain the night before admission that was relieved by having a bowel movement, and she currently has a baseline intermittent constipation and diarrhea due to irritable bowel syndrome.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs were temperature maximum of 98.1, temperature current 98.1, blood pressure 100/60, pulse 100, respiratory rate 32, 80% on 3 liters with activity, 93% on 3 liters at rest.
Pulmonary examination demonstrated coarse breath sounds with diffuse expiratory wheezes resonant on percussion extended bilaterally.
The patient was unable to lay flat for palpation of liver and spleen.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count of 9.4 (with a differential of 84.4 neutrophils, 4.9 lymphocytes, 7.8 monocytes on [**2-6**]).
White blood cell count had decreased to 6.8 on the day of transfer ([**2-7**]), hematocrit 55.4 on admission (decreased to 44.1 on [**2-11**]), platelets of 174 on admission (decreased to 139 on transfer).
Sodium of 145, potassium 4.2, chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 33, blood urea nitrogen of 22, creatinine of 1.3, glucose of 82.
Calcium 7.7, magnesium 2, phosphorous 6.
PT of 13.3, PTT of 28.6, INR of 1.2.
Creatine kinases were 100, 250, 259.
CK/MB of 2, C troponin of less than 0.3.
Urinalysis and urine sedimentation were negative for infection.
Sputum on [**2172-2-7**] demonstrated sparse growth or oropharyngeal flora.
Blood cultures from [**2172-2-7**] demonstrated no growth.
Urine cultures from [**2172-2-8**] demonstrated no growth.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray on [**2172-2-12**] demonstrated no pneumonia, no congestive heart failure, and no pneumothorax.
Her arterial blood gas on discharge demonstrated a pH of 7.35, a PCO2 of 58, a PO2 of 66, a CO2 of 33, and a base excess of 3 on 3 liters of oxygen.
A Physical Therapy evaluation thought it was safe for the patient to be discharged home with her husband's assistance and to have home physical therapy.
An echocardiogram was obtained to assess pulmonary arterial pressures as well as to determine if there was a right or left ventricular hypertrophy.
Echocardiogram demonstrated mild dilatation of the left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, with an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, a mildly dilated right ventricle with depressed systolic function, a mildly dilated abdominal aorta, and questionable impaired relaxation of the left ventricle.
Pulmonary artery pressures could not be assessed on this echocardiogram.
Withdraw of blood was not considered necessary unless her hematocrit increased to 50.
GENITOURINARY:  The patient was at her baseline creatinine of approximately 1.1 to 1.3.
The patient tended to become anxious when she had difficulty breathing, and Serax helped improve her symptoms of dyspnea.
