Patient was admitted from  [**Date range (1) 92228**]/12 where bone marrow biopsy showed evidence of MDS (in comparison to prior biopsy which was concerning for erythroleukemia).
She was readmitted [**Date range (1) 29682**]/12 with anemia, and had a repeat bone marrow biopsy at that time.

Imaging: CXR [**4-22**]-  As compared to the previous radiograph, the PICC line is not well visible.
Transthoracic echocardiogram [**4-23**]- The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-2-23**], the findings are similar.
Bone marrow biopsy [**4-23**]- Markedly hypercellular marrow with trilineage dysplasia in keeping with persistent involvement by patient's known myelodysplastic syndrome, with  increased pronormoblasts worrisome for an evolving pure erythroleukemia (see note).
Compared to a prior biopsy (S12-2277W dated [**2160-2-24**]) the current marrow shows a greater proportion of erythroid precursors with an increased relative proportion of early pronormoblasts.
MRI w/contrast [**4-25**]- No acute abnormality.
CXR [**4-28**]- Right PIC line ends in the low SVC.
EEG [**4-30**]- This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior quadrant.
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**5-1**]- 1.
TTE performed to establish baseline prior to chemotherapy and was unchanged from prior.
Infectious work-up was negative (blood, urine cultures, CT torso).
20 min EEG showed no epileptiform discharges or seizure activity, however there was some focality in left lobe, that may have been representative of seizure activity.
An LP was performed on [**4-30**] and was not consistent with infection.
However, patient's lithium and fluphenazine had both been decreased during last admission, so there was concern that these medication changes may have precipitated change in mental status.
Punch biopsy showed ruptured folliculitis.
Creatinine has been stable; diagnosed with 24 hr creatinine/urea and cystatin C. Renal followed patient during last admission and did not feel that lithium was contributing to renal disease.
Lithium level appropriate (0.6) on day of admission.
She continued to require frequent PRBC and platelet transfusions to maintain a hematocrit >21 and plt >10.
After several meetings with her HCP and no significant improvement in her mental status the decision was made to transition this pt to comfort measures only.
