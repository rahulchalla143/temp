As his JP output had decreased, it the JP was then removed on POD 4.
By POD6 he was adavanced to a house diet, was ambulating out of bed, and his stents were d/c??????d.
His intraop ucx showed [**Female First Name (un) **], and another ucx was sent.
His wbc was 14 from 11, Cr 1.1.
By POD7 - [**2181-7-12**]: Interventional radiology 1.
His Creatinine went from Cr 1.3->1.7-2.1, and his wbc was 18, and his hct was slightly decreqased at 28.
A CT A/P showed R hydroureter w/ mild hydro and pelic fluid collection around conduit, but no abscess identified.
CXR showed mild b/l pleural eff.
To r/o PE, a v/q scan was obtained which was neg.
A medical cosnult was then obtained, which rec an ECHO which showed: mild AS stenosis EF>60%.
POD 8/0: [**2181-7-13**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], 1.
Exploratory laparotomy, drainage of fungal abcess and urine in   peritoneum 2.
Endoscopic exam of inside of ileal loop, placement of bilateral     ileal conduit to ureter to kidney stents.
The right PCN produced copious yellow urine, leading us to believe that the left anastomsis might still be leaking.
C diff was again sent, and found to be negative.
He recieved 4U pRBC over this time, and his stools eventually normalized and his hematocrit stabilized without further need for blood.
POD20/12/0 - Given his continued high JP output (~1.5L/day), which was felt to be secondary to a anastomotic leak, the patient was taken  to IR suite for a tube(stent) study and loopogram.
This revealed persistent left ureteral-ileal leak, therefore L PCN was placed, JP exchanged, and Urine and wound cultures were sent.
Urine and wound cultures from the IR suite were found to be positive for: 2 sp enterococcus, proteus and yeast.
Additionaly, on POD 22, patient spiked a temperature to 101.2, and repeat blood and urine cultures were sent and showed again yeast and enterococcus.
CXR was obtained and was negative.
Urine culture was noted to be positive for yeast as well as proteus.
POD25/17/5 - 29/21/9 - Patient's WBC remained generally within normal limits at the end of his hospitalization.
Consultation of the hepatobiliary service for his elevated liver enzymes resulted in paracentesis and drainage of ~750cc of ascitic fluid.
He was afebrile, and all vital signs were stable.
His staples were removed, and his incisions were otherwise clean, dry, and intact with steri strips applied.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.

On [**2181-8-8**] you will need to have LABS drawn so that they will be ready for your appointment with ID on [**2181-8-14**] (CBC w/ diff, Chem 7, LFTs - please have this done when you see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in clinic that day)  Please call Infectious disease clinic @ [**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**] this week to confirm your f/u appointment for [**2181-8-14**].
