CTA ordered by PCP which showed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli, saddle PE, LUL lung mass and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer of the aortic arch.
Labs: WBC 13.1 HCT 42.4 PLT 171 PTT 22.7 INR 1 Na 137 K 3.6 Cl 100 CO2 30 BUN 6 Cr 0.9 Gluc 102 LDH 143 AST 18 ALT 13 CK 68 CKMB 0.7 Trop I <0.01.
In the ED T100.9 HR 89 105/70 RR 18 98% 4LNC.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Cannot exclude right atrial thrombus (views suboptimal) --------------  RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2181-1-9**] 7:54 AM  CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-  Reason: evaluate aortic arch ulcer seen on CT at OSH Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 77 year old woman with bilateral/saddle PE's, new LUL lung mass and report of penetrating aortic arch atherosclerotic ulcer REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate aortic arch ulcer seen on CT at OSH CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CT OF THE CHEST:  CLINICAL HISTORY: 77-year-old woman with saddle pulmonary embolism, new left upper lobe lung mass and reports of penetrating aortic arch atherosclerotic ulcer.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were initially obtained through the chest with a low-dose technique without contrast followed by contrast-enhanced images through the chest utilizing a pulmonary embolism protocol.
Coronal, sagittal, and oblique reformatted images were also obtained.
Small subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes are seen that do not meet CT criteria for malignancy.
Abdominal windows demonstrate large amount of thrombus within the pulmonary artery branches in this region, and this area therefore, may represent a focal pulmonary infarct.
Therefore, attention should be drawn to this region on subsequent examination to assess for interval change.
However,an underlying neoplasm cannot be excluded.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
#atherosclerotic ulcer of aortic arch: Patient had a finding on CT scan which was concerning for possibility of dissection vs rupture.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and a CTA with reconstruction was performed, which ruled out dissection.
No further work-up was required.
Patient will need a biopsy to determine the exact nature of the nodule.
Her blood cultures showed no growth to date x 5 days at the time of this summary and the urine culture was negative.
# F/E/N: Her electrolytes were repleted PRN.
