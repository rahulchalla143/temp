CXR [**2174-8-5**]: IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary edema.
Echo [**2174-8-5**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
CT AP [**2174-8-6**] 1.
Narrowing of the distal sigmoid colon proximal to the rectal tube  presumably representing peristalsis, however, correlation with sigmoidoscopy or repeat scan is recommended given the clinical history.
A head CT was negative at [**Hospital1 2519**] and he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
# GI Bleed with acute blood loss anemia: In the MICU on [**8-6**] the patient had melena and bright red blood per rectum and his hct dropped to 24 from 28 on admission.
On [**8-8**] he was transferred to the general medicine service, where his hct continued to gradually drop to 25.4.
He was transfused one additional unit; his hct increased appropriately to 29.5.
From that point forward, his hct was stable in the 28-29 range.
He decided to go forward with an EGD and colonoscopy, which was performed on [**8-11**].
The EGD showed findings compatible with gastritis and colonoscopy showed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and proximal ascending colon as well as grade 1 internal hemorrhoids.
His hct continued to be stable and he was discharged to rehabilitation on omeprazole 40mg daily per GI recs.
# Acute systolic CHF exacerbation: In the ED the patient was found to be fluid overloaded on exam, had a CXR showing pulmonary edema, and had a BNP of ~20,000.
An echocardiogram showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD, mild mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension.
He had no signs of fluid overload on discharge exam and was therefore not discharged on scheduled lasix.
His weights should be tracked on a daily basis with oral LAsix diuresis started if he gains more than 3 pounds from one day to the next or if his weights trend upward significantly.
Acute kidney injury, prerenal, due to acute blood loss anemia:  The patient came in with a creatinine of 2.4 which trended down to 1.6 after pRBCs  and continued to remain stable after transfer to the medicine service.
We watched your blood count very closely and it had been normal for a few days when we you were discharged.
