No pneumothorax  [**3-4**] DOPPLER EXAMINATION OF THE LIVER: The portal vein appears dilated and is filled with echogenic material.
Allowing for differences in technique this appears not significantly changed from prior CT examination of [**2162-2-28**].
There is again seen elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which may be due to subpulmonic effusion versus eventration however, this is unchanged.
Atelectases at both lung bases are again seen.
A chest x-ray and CTA were performed; for details, please see results section.
The patient was made NPO with IVF at midnight on [**3-1**] for thrombolysis; his heparin drip was held the morning of [**3-1**] for an afternoon procedure.
The patient returned on [**3-2**] for a venogram to reevaluate the thrombosis.
The patient's coagulation profile was constantly monitored for consumptive coagulopathy, which was not noted, and remained stable.
The patient had low urine output on transfer, and was bolused; urine electrolytes were obtained (FeNA 0%), and urine output was closely monitored.
Serial hematocrits were stopped as the patient's laboratory values were stable.
Mr. [**Known lastname 76380**] urine output remained low, however, and on [**3-4**]-7, he required several more boluses to maintain adequate output.
An ultrasound was performed on [**3-4**] to reevaluate, however remained stable; for details, please see results section.
The patient began experiencing some wheezing and shortness of breath, for which he received nebulized treatments, and serial chest x-rays were performed.
The chest x-rays showed some atelectasis, and the patient was encouraged to use incentive spirometry and to get out of bed and ambulate.
An ECG was obtained on [**3-7**] to evaluate cardiac function, the ECG was within normal limits.
On [**3-8**] his INR was found to be 3.6.
INR on [**3-9**] is 3.3.
INR should be drawn on [**3-10**] with results to his PCP same day.
Goal INR is [**1-31**].
If INR result is less than 3.0 he is advised to resume Coumadin at a 3 mg dose.
Outpatient [**Name (NI) **] Work PT/INR Dx: Initiation of Coumadin Therapy for Portal vein Thrombus Send results to Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Hospital 76381**] Medical Clinic  Goal INR [**1-31**] 2.
When INR is less than 3 you may resume Coumadin at 3 mg daily.
This will continue to be monitored with a goal INR of [**1-31**] * You have a Heparin Allergy.
Have blood drawn [**3-10**] and restart Coumadin when INR is less than 3.
Goal INR is [**1-31**] You should have a CTA performed in [**5-4**] weeks to evaluate your portal vein thrombosis.
This can be done in [**State 3908**] and results sent to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**]/ fax [**Telephone/Fax (1) 697**])                                [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 707**] MD, [**MD Number(3) 709**]  Completed by:[**2162-3-9**
