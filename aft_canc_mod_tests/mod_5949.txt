He typically gets chest pain with exertion or if HCt drops which is frequent due to MDS.
His troponin was 0.22 which is his baseline.
His CXR showed pulmonary edema.
[**Location (un) 620**] though he had a CHF exacerbation due to crackles on exam.
In our ED, basic labs were sent and ECG looked unchanged from prior (V-paced with TWI in V1-2).
On transfer to the floor, vitals were 98.5 65 153/66 14 100.
CAD, s/p stents x 3; s/p 2 Palmaz stents to the mid and distal LCx in [**2185**], s/p Tristar stent to the mid PDA and PTCA to  distal PDA in [**2188**]; EF was 61%.

Chest Xray [**2198-10-2**]: New interval haziness/blunting at the left costophrenic angle, which could be due to left small pleural effusion and adjacent small atelectasis at the left lung base; however, cannot rule out pneumonia.
TTE [**2198-10-3**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Chest Xray [**2198-10-4**]: There is interval development of bilateral perihilar, right more than left, interstitial linear opacities continuing toward the lung bases, including the bilateral subpleural linear opacities as seen in particular in the right lower lobe, findings that are consistent with interval development of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
Renal Ultrasound [**2198-10-5**]: 1.
Further evaluation with cystoscopy or MRI would be indicated, when clinical conditions warrant.
Cardiac cath report: Pending at the time of discharge.
ECHO [**2198-10-15**]: Conclusions Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-10-3**], overall ejection fraction has decreased with worsened function of the anterior wall, anterior septum and anterolateral wall.
His cardiac enzymes fluctuated during this admission, and he continued to have anginal symptoms intermittently throughout the hospitalization.
They decided to proceed with cardiac catheterization for stenting of his proximal LAD lesion.
Pump: On admission, he had a history of 1 month of peripheral edema and he appeared volume overloaded by chest xray at [**Location (un) 620**].
He had a TTE after admission which showed preserved systolic function.
He had one episode of hypoxia, shortness of breath, and increasing volume overload on physical exam that was responsive to IV Lasix.
He intermittently required low doses of Lasix for pulmonary edema diagnosed by physical exam and chest xray.
During cardiac catheterization, he had an echo that showed decreased LV systolic function compared to previous with an LVEF of 20-25%.
He should have a repeat ECHO in [**2-26**] weeks now that he has been revascularized to assess for improvement in function.
Anemia/Myelodysplasia: His hemoglobin remained in the 11.0-12.5 range during this admission.
There was some concern for anemia-induced angina, and his hematocrit was maintained greater than 33.
His anemia was decreased on the day of discharge and he received an additional unit of prbcs with resulting post-transfusion Hct of 31.9.
He should likely have a hematocrit drawn in two days to assess for any continued drop.
Acute Renal Failure: His creatinine increased from 1.2 on admission to 2.9 at its peak.
The nephrology service was consulted and his urine lytes were consistent with prerenal etiology.
Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis.
He was given one small fluid bolus (500cc) to improve his creatinine and 2 units of blood for anemia.
His cardiac catheterization was delayed somewhat in order for his renal function to improve.
He was given mucomyst and IV fluids prior to catheterization to prevent contrast nephropathy.
His creatinine was 2.1 on discharge.
His urine output should be followed as there is a risk of contrast induced nephropathy approximately 2 to 3 days after his catheterization.
Elevated PTT: He was started on subcutaneous heparin during this hospitalization for DVT prophylaxis and his PTT increased to approximately 70.
The SQ heparin was stopped, and his PTT remained elevated for approximately 5 days after stopping it.
He had a mixing study that was negative for a factor inhibitor and his thrombin time was normal.

You underwent cardiac catheterization with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and had two drug-eluting stents placed in your coronary arteries.
You also worked with physical therapy after this procedure.\  You were found to have a bladder mass on imaging during this hospitalization that is likely the cause of your hematuria (blood in your urine).
