IMAGING ------- CT SCAN ABDOMEN/PELVIS 1.
This may represent a complex cyst, however enhancement is concerning for papillary renal cell carcinoma, further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
Evaluation for effusion is limited on the radiograph.
Chest X-ray on admission: IMPRESSION: Small left pleural effusion but no acute cardiopulmonary process otherwise identified.
Hematocrit was stable without transfusions.
CTA of the abdomen had no evidence of extravasation through coiled pseudoaneurysm.
No hematemesis and benign abdominal exam were noted, and stable hematocrits and negative NG lavage suggested that upper GI source was less likely, though small shallow ulcerations were seen in the duodenum on ERCP in 5/[**2143**].
Patient does have diverticulosis seen on CT in [**2141**] with prior remote episodes of melenic stool.
INR was supratherapeutic slightly on admission to OSH and previously this month, though patient reports therapeutic range for past few weeks.
Last colonoscopy was in [**2141**] and was reportedly normal per patient.
GI did a bedside endoscopy, showing shallow non-bleeding ulcer, but no active bleeding.
Patient did have a few bloody stools during his admission, for which no intervention was undertaken.
He will likely need an outpatient colosnoscopy.
Hematocrits remained stable and patient did not require any further transfusion.
He underwent successful embolization in [**3-/2144**] and CTA abdomen on this admission demonstrated thrombosed aneurysm decreased in size from last imaging, with no signs of extravasation or leaking.
No abdominal pain was present during hospitalization and his liver function tests were improved from last admission and remained stable, so restenosis is unlikely.
On CT in [**3-/2144**], there was evidence of increasing peripancreatic, gastrohepatic and periportal lymphadenopathy, likely representing metastatic disease from pancreatic cancer.
It was suggested that an MRI be obtained for further classification.
# Fever: Per patient he had a temperature of 101 at home, improved with tylenol.
There were no documented fevers since admission, no leukocytosis, and no localized signs/symptoms of infection though patient had intermittent diarrhea for past few weeks with possible evidence of colitis on CT few weeks ago.
Clostridium difficile toxin was checked and was negative.
INR was supratherapeutic to 3.4 at the outside hospital, improved to 2.6 s/p 2 units FFP.
INR was 2.4 on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] with goal <1.5 prior to EGD as above.
INR was reversed with 2 units of FFP and 10 mg Vitamin K.  Discussion was held with patient and family regarding risks and benefits of anticoagulation, and it was decided to discontinue his warfarin.
His blood sugars were controlled with sliding scale insulin during his stay.
TRANSITION OF CARE ------------------ # Follow-up: patient will need a CBC after discharge for evaluation of anemia.
An MRI of the abdomen is also needed to further classify the mass noted in the patient's right kidney.
Patient has several blood cultures which remain pending at the time of discharge.

An EGD was performed that did not show any active bleeding.
It would also likely be worthwhile for you to get a colonoscopy due to your gastrointestinal bleeding that you came to the hospital for.
You were evaluated by our orthopedics team and an x-ray did not show a fracture.
There was a mass noted on your kidney that was found on a CT scan that was performed during your admission.
An MRI of the kidneys should be performed on discharge for ?
