HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old Caper Verdean male with hypertension, asthma, many pack year smoking history, asbestos exposure, and positive purified protein derivative with known right apical cavitary lesion (being treated since [**2126-10-1**]) who was admitted to [**Hospital6 **] on [**2127-1-29**] with a productive cough, increased shortness of breath, and bilateral neck swelling.
He originally had a positive purified protein derivative in [**2126-9-1**] with an initial negative chest x-ray.
An x-ray revealed a new 5-cm mass with lucency suggestive of cavitation in the right apex with hilar retraction and fullness in the paratracheal area.
He was seen back in the [**Hospital 45727**] Clinic on [**1-13**], and the chest x-ray showed no change in the cavitation.
He ruled out for a myocardial infarction with serial cardiac enzymes and was started on levofloxacin for "bronchitis."
He then had an exercise tolerance test on the treadmill which was negative.
He was intubated with an initial arterial blood gas of 6.99, PCO2 of 105, and PO2 of 25.
An emergent bronchoscopy revealed distorted tracheal anatomy at the level the carina, and no visualization of the right main stem bronchus due to mass compression and clot covering the area.
Of note, with labile blood pressures with a systolic blood pressure of 200/110 and was started on a Nipride drip.
Of note, sputum culture at [**Hospital6 **] was positive for aspergillosis; so he was also given one dose of amphotericin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed temperature was 101.2, heart rate was 110, blood pressure was 126/90, assist-control 600 X 20, positive end-airway pressure 10, FIO2 was 50%, peak inspiratory flow 34, plateau of 23.
Arterial blood gas was 7.37, PCO2 of 45, PO2 of 97.
Neurologic examination revealed unresponsive.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 17.7, hematocrit was 44, and platelets were 251.
INR was 1.6.
Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 143, potassium was 4.5, chloride was 108, bicarbonate was 24, blood urea nitrogen was 19, creatinine was 0.9, and blood glucose was 162.
Calcium was 9.1, magnesium was 2.2, phosphorous was 3.1.
Lactate was 2.4.
Total bilirubin was 0.6, albumin was 3.7, AST was 192, ALT was 166, alkaline phosphatase was 75, LDH was 360, amylase was 104, and lipase was 144.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  [**Hospital6 **] chest x-ray on [**1-28**] revealed persistent increased opacity of the right apex with linear densities and apparent cavitary lesions, a soft tissue nodule, within this cavity, and a meniscus sign.
A computed tomography at [**Hospital6 **] on [**1-29**] revealed a 2.7-cm X 1.8-cm thick wall cavitary lesion within the right apex, several stellate fibrotic bands radiated from this lesion inferiorly.
A exercise treadmill stress test on [**1-31**] revealed positive chest pain.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was initially kept on assist-control; however, on the morning of [**2127-2-4**], he self-extubated, and intubation with prolonged arterial blood gas empty time was 2.23, PCO2 was 54, PO2 was 127.
A flexible bronchoscopy was performed which revealed possible communication between the right upper lobe lesion and trachea, severe narrowing of the right main stem bronchus.
First staging computed tomography was obtained which showed no hemorrhage, and no enhancing lesions, and normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white differentiation.
A computed tomography of the abdomen showed no metastases.
Because of concern over infection control, given that the patient traveled to [**Country 3587**] since the last time he ruled out for tuberculosis, acid-fast bacillus times three were obtained; which were negative.
The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with stents on [**2127-2-6**] which revealed large amounts of paratracheal edema.
Due to the rising AST and ALT and low likelihood for tuberculosis given negative acid-fast bacillus smears, his INH and rifampin were discontinued.
The patient also with heavy amounts of sinus discharge, which were negative for aspergillosis.
A Radiology/Oncology consultation was obtained, and the plan was to begin radiation therapy.
A cardiac echocardiogram was performed which revealed findings consistent with infiltrative cardiomyopathy.
However, no further workup was done at this time.
A cosyntropin stimulation test was performed which revealed no evidence of renal insufficiency.
