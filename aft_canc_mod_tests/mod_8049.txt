Coumadin which he had not taken for several months was stopped on the day prior to admission and INR was noted to be 3.6 at the time.
His stool was also noted to be Clostridium difficile toxin positive on [**9-19**] and started on Flagyl.
In the Emergency Department he was noted to be afebrile, orthostatic by blood pressure and pulse.
An nasogastric lavage was noted to have a red aspirate which cleared after 600 cc of saline.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature 96.8, pulse 64, blood pressure 122/64, oxygen saturation was 98% on 2 liters, respiratory rate 16.
Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves II through XII were intact.
Reflexes were 2+ and symmetric bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Sodium 129, potassium 3.1, chloride 93, bicarbonate 24, BUN 35, creatinine 0.7, glucose of 134.
White blood cell count 31.4, hematocrit 31, platelets were 335.
PT 15.6, PTT 30, INR 1.7.
ALT 22, AST 25, alkaline phosphatase 151, LDH 174, total bilirubin 1.5, direct bilirubin 0.6, indirect bilirubin 0.9.
GGT 149, calcium 7.5, phosphate 1.7, magnesium 1.2.
Haptoglobin was 206.
Helicobacter pylori antibody test was negative.
Urine culture showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed proximal esophagus was somewhat dilated.
Barium swallow revealed a shelf-like mass seen in the distal esophagus and appeared to extend into the proximal stomach causing mucosal irregularity.
Cytology samples were obtained using a brush.
He was transfused a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells, and his elevated INR was reversed with 1 mg subcutaneous of vitamin K.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done on hospital day two which revealed a large fungating mass at the level of the middle esophagus as above.
Given his recent elevated INR no tissue biopsy was obtained at this time.
Chest and abdominal CT scan revealed multiple areas of lymphadenopathy in the hilar and mediastinal areas as well as the celiac area.
Barium swallow showed a distal shelf-like mass as above.
Because the brush biopsy was nondiagnostic, a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy was scheduled with plans for a tissue biopsy.
The patient refused further esophagogastroduodenoscopy and diagnostic workup and was wishing no further treatment including blood transfusions, medications, and intravenous feedings if needed.
HEMATOLOGY:  Given the recent decrease in hematocrit the patient was transfused a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells and given subcutaneous vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma to reverse his anticoagulation prior to endoscopy.
His hematocrit was stable on discharge, and he did not require any further transfusions.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  On admission he was continued on Flagyl for a Clostridium difficile colitis, and ciprofloxacin for a Pseudomonas positive urinary tract infection.
His electrolytes were repleted as necessary.
