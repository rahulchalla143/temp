Tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, do not appreciate any murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation on left with good aeration, however right has diffuse rales and decreased breath sounds in right mid to lower lung fields.
Abdomen: Markedly distended and firm, non-tender to palpation, J tube in place GU: no foley, right nephrostomy tube draining clear urine Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation  DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM N/A   Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS [**2191-9-16**] 01:31PM BLOOD WBC-11.5* RBC-2.91* Hgb-9.0* Hct-26.7* MCV-92 MCH-31.0 MCHC-33.8 RDW-13.5 Plt Ct-326 [**2191-9-17**] 12:00AM BLOOD WBC-10.4 RBC-2.64* Hgb-8.5* Hct-24.2* MCV-92 MCH-32.0 MCHC-35.0 RDW-13.5 Plt Ct-295 [**2191-9-16**] 01:31PM BLOOD PT-12.1 PTT-30.4 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2191-9-16**] 01:31PM BLOOD Glucose-110* UreaN-62* Creat-2.3*# Na-144 K-3.6 Cl-112* HCO3-19* AnGap-17 [**2191-9-16**] 01:31PM BLOOD ALT-9 AST-18 AlkPhos-129 TotBili-0.3 [**2191-9-18**] 04:02AM BLOOD Vanco-13.4 [**2191-9-16**] 04:25PM BLOOD Lactate-0.8  [**2191-9-17**] RENAL ULTRASOUND: FINDINGS:  There is no hydronephrosis on the right kidney.
There is slight increase in hydronephrosis of the left compared to study on [**2191-8-25**] from mild to now mild-to-moderate.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2191-9-16**] no significant change except for faster rate.
CXR [**2191-9-25**]: Large right pleural effusion is unchanged.
PNA was also a possibility, given his cough and right sided rales, but he did not have fevers or clear infiltrated on CXR (looks to be layering effusion on left).
Lower extremity ultrasounds showed no DVTs in either lower extremity, which was reassuring.
Review of old images shows left sided hydronephrosis in [**7-/2191**], unclear if there may be some concurrent obstructive process now affecting the left kidney and causing [**Last Name (un) **].
His creatinine was trended and remained stable at about 2 with good renal output until he appeared to become infected from a possible GI source vs. a line infection; his creatinine trended upward beginning on [**9-22**] and was 2.4 on [**9-26**].
Discussed J-tube with IR and radiology about options for CT to evaluate for tumor burden, obstruction, utility of noncon CT vs CT w/ oral contrast.
Decided against further imaging as it would likely not change management.
