His platelets on admission were 38 (baseline) and Hct was 21.5, so he was transfused 2 units of PRBCs and platelets.
He had a repeat head CT on [**5-11**] that was stable, and was transferred to the floor and ultimately the medicine service on [**2184-5-12**].
He received 20 mg IV lasix x 2 and his regular 80 mg po dose, with an output of 2.8 L thus far.
Repeat CXR was significant for worsening pulmonary edema.
Of note, the patient has been O2-dependent at home on 2 L NC since his MI in [**2182**].

INTERPRETATION: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate abnormal decreased ventilation of the left lung base which corresponds to the CXR finding of the elevated left hemidiaphragm.
Perfusion images were not performed based on patient request.
Chest x-ray shows decreasing pulmonary edema, no pleural effusion and persistent abnormal elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
The above findings are consistent with an inconclusive study as no perfusion phase has been performed.
IMPRESSION: Inconclusive study as no perfusion phase has been performed.
The patient did not want to continue with perfusion phase.

COMPARISON: CT head from [**2184-5-11**] through [**2184-5-13**] as well as MR head of [**2184-5-11**].
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial imaging was performed through the brain without administration of IV contrast.
CT HEAD: A parafalcine right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring 35 x 20 mm is little changed; surrounding edema may be slightly more prominent.
Evaluation of fine bony detail is somewhat limited by patient motion, however, the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are grossly clear.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
# Fever/UTI - Blood cultures and urine cultures were taken.
Chest x-ray was most consistent with fluid overload rather than pneumonia as was subsequent clinical course.
An echo did not provide an obvious explanation for why he has a 2L O2 requirement at home after his MI, and it may be that pulmonary follow-up would be appropriate to consider his pulmonary hypertension.
# Acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure An echo was performed - results above.
# Subarachanoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhages: he was initially monitored in the neurosurgical ICU and blood pressure controlled with IV nicardipine.
Serial CT and clinical exam suggest resolution; most recent CT scan showed mild cerebral edema without shift of any midline structures and resolving blood with resorption of intraventricular blood.
Pt did not want another MRA because of the length of the study and discomfort.
Levels was 6.5 at discharge (with albumin 3.3)  #.
- plan to keep HCT >21, and plt  >40K; ideally over 50K if possible atleast initially after bleed.
His diastolic CHF does necessitate an extra dose of lasix 40mg po with each blood transfusion.
