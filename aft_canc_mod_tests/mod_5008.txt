HISTORY: Status post CABG, decreasing hematocrit.
Routine chest x-ray was notable for a tortuous and calcified [**Known lastname 5236**] for which a chest CT scan was obtained.
The CT scan also revealed a 3.1 cm spiculated mass in the right middle lobe, concerning for lung carcinoma.
Head MR imaging found no evidence of metastatic disease.
Spirometry showed normal lung volumes and PET imaging revealed focal abnormal uptake of FDG in a right middle lobe mass with a maximal SUV measured at 8.3.
Further preoperative workup included abdominal ultrasound for elevated LFT's.
Ultrasound was notable for multiple small mobile gallstones.
The pancreatic head and body were unremarkable and there were no focal liver lesions.
His preoperative AST/ALT/amylase/lipase peaked to [**Telephone/Fax (3) 68611**]/108 respectively.
