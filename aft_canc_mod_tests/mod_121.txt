-[**Date range (1) 6098**] blood cxs are no growth to date  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2177-4-14**] 9:47 AM IMPRESSION: Increased hazy opacity in the right lung, predominantly in the right greater than left base, which could represent asymmetric edema versus aspiration or infection.
HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS LEFT PORT Study Date of [**2177-4-14**] 10:13 AM  IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with posterior dislocation of the prosthetic femoral head from the acetabular cup.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably normal (LVEF~55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2177-4-15**] 7:59 AM FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is marked improvement of the pre-existing right parenchymal opacity.
PELVIS AP [**4-15**] There is some relocation of the left total hip arthroplasty.
