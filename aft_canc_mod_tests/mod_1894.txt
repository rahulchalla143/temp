She developed shortness of breath and substernal chest pressure this morning after awakening and having a bowel movement at 4:30am.
The chest pain did not radiate to the neck/arms/back, not pleuritic, no nausea/vomiting/diarrhea or epigastric pain.
Patient was given a full dose of aspirin and later developed hypotension to SBP 80s, but developed no new symptoms.
She had a CXR which showed persistent small right pleural effusion with right lower lobe atelectasis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Initial EKG was sinus and unremarkable but a second EKG in setting of hypotension showed atrial flutter/fibrillation with a stable rate.
On the floor, the pt was placed on a heart monitor which showed pauses.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] work at that time showed pancytopenia, and a chest x-ray done on [**2184-6-9**] showed a new large right pleural effusion.
She was subsequently admitted to [**Hospital1 5991**]/[**Hospital 8**] Hospital, for further evaluation on [**2184-6-10**].
CTA of the chest on [**2184-6-10**] revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism with a confirmation of the large right pleural effusion.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2184-6-11**] revealed a large mesenteric soft tissue mass and right paraaortic and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy as well as inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Results of flow cytometry and cytology from the pleural fluid are not available, but Mrs. [**Known lastname **] subsequently underwent a right inguinal lymph node excision on [**2184-6-18**].
Flow cytometry revealed a monoclonal population of kappa positive B cells, positive for CD19 (dim), CD20, CD10, CD23, FMC7, CD22, and CD38.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CTA [**9-9**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**9-14**] IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO showed critical AS which likely contributed.
CXR is not typical of left ventricular failure, but the patient's fluctuating heart rate with pauses may be leading to drops in cardiac output.
Art line was inserted for BP monitoring and was removed prior to transfer.
UA was suggestive of UTI so pt was started on Ciprofloxacin PO 500 mg [**Hospital1 **], urine cx showed E. coli so 3 day course of abx was completed.
Her BP was stable for floor transfer and remained normotensive on the floor.
Her Metoprolol was decreased to 12.5 mg PO BID.
# Arrhythmia: Pauses in Heart rate and Afib - likely due to sick sinus syndrome that is not new.
Her sick sinus syndrome and poor volume status together may have dropped her cardiac output leading to SOB and low BP while in ICU.
Her Hct remained stable, and Ms. [**Known lastname **] was treated with pain medication.
MI, PE ruled out.
She was not neutropenic after her chemotherapy, but in the setting of her sick sinus syndrome and need for pacemaker placement, she was placed on neupogen in order to increase her counts and lower her infection risk.
When the pt was on the cardiology team, her BMT attending was asked regarding this and she was transfused 2 units pRBCs on the day prior to discharge and her hematocrit rose appropriately to 26.2.  .
These are present on CT chest of 1 month ago.
Calcium 500 500 mg (1,250 mg) Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO three times a day.
