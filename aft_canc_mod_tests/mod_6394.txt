Patient history began on [**2155-9-28**] when he developed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and MRI revealed a large mass in the right frontal and temporal lobes.
He underwent a underwent an elective stereotaxic brain biopsy on [**2155-12-9**] that showed gliosis.
On arrival, his BP was 83/44 and oxygen saturation was at 95%.
He required intubation for airway protection and BP dropped to 39/14, requiring levophed.
Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 99.7 F, blood pressure 83/44, pulse 60, and oxygen saturation 95%, on arrival GENERAL: Lying in bed, NAD HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa NECK: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, supple, no carotid or vertebral bruit BACK: No point tenderness or erythema CARDIOVASCULAR: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally ABDOMEN: +BS soft, nontender EXTREMITIES: no edema  NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Mental status: intubated, does not follow commands; grimaces on sternal rub Cranial Nerves: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 4 to 3 mm bilaterally.

MRA [**2156-1-12**]: IMPRESSION: Subacute hematoma with edema around the hematoma in the right temporal lobe probably related to biopsy.
CT Pelvis [**2156-1-15**]: 1.
Unusual tapering of the mid gallbladder with calcification of the gallbladder fundus - a right upper quadrant ultrasound is recommended when the patient's clinical condition improves to further evaluate the gallbladder.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], BP was 83/44, SaO2 95%.
He required intubation for airway protection, and his BP dropped to 39/14, requiring levophed.
Repeat CXR on admission showed diffuse prominent interstitial markings but no pneumonia, so the antibiotics were discontinued.
MRI/MRA Brain showed subacute hematoma with edema around the hematoma in the right temporal lobe probably related to biopsy, and the previously seen diffuse T2 hyperintensity in the right frontal and temporal lobes.
EEG showed right PLEDs and slower and lower voltage background on the right.
He was briefly called out to floor on [**1-15**]; however, he was found to be somnolent with SBP 83.
For this he received 500 cc NS with improvement in his blood pressure.
CT abdomen/pelvis showed no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma, but there was stranding and a tiny hematoma surrounding the right common femoral vein.
A repeat EEG in the NeuroICU showed right hemisphere and right frontal slowing, and an occasional isolated sharp and slow wave discharges in the right frontal region.
We were unable to send a stool culture for Clostridium difficile toxin and would recommend that this is done at rehabilitation.
