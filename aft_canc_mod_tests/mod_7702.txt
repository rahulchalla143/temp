His BP and oxygenation improved and he was weaned to nasal cannula.
Given he was afebrile and had no supplemental O2 requirement by time of discharge, this finding was felt to be inconsistent with his clinical picture and he was discharged with plans to repeat CXR as outpatient for f/u.
He presented to OSH ED where he was febrile and had CXR with bilateral interstitial infiltrates.
CT PE was negative for PE.
Sputum cultures had no growth.
CXR showed b/l intersitial vs intra-alveolar infiltrates.
He also had periods of significant hypertension with SBP > 200.
He had a CT head/chest/abdomen/pelvis, and head CT showed left cerebellar nonhemomrrhagic stroke, with ?brainstem involvement.
Given his complicated course, his family requested that he be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2112-12-18**]):       RARE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
IMAGING: CXR [**2112-12-15**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-23**]: New endotracheal tube is in standard placement, nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view, left PIC line is traceable to the upper SVC.
Lung volumes are quite low and lungs are generally opacified and in a heterogeneous fashion, more so inferiorly.
TTE [**2112-12-17**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-11-16**], no change.
MRI BRAIN [**2112-12-17**]:  TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired.
Correlation was made with CT of [**2112-11-27**].
This is best visualized on series 7 and 8 image 17.
He was evaluated by the neurology service, who felt that his mental status was unlikely to be due to his recent CVAs, and more likely encephalopathy due to multiple medical problems.

Restarted coumadin prior to discharge, with goal INR [**3-10**].
Discharge INR 2.0  # Hypernatremia: Na now wnl.
Retic count 1.2%, suggesting insufficient production.
