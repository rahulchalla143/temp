She had a CXR showing effusion and potentially recurrent pneumonia.
Initial lactate was 4.
Initial BPs in 130s, but then had hyoptension after intubation and did not rebound back to normal.
BP lows were 70s systolic, so was started on levophed.
DPs 2+.

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2192-4-1**]):       Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
URINE CULTURE (Pending):  CXR [**2192-3-21**] Large bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with underlying atelectasis and central vascular congestion.
PATHOLOGY [**2192-3-22**] Pleural fluid, cell block: Tumor cells are positive for B72.3, [**Last Name (un) **]-31, WT-1, and PAX-2, but negative for calretinin, TTF-1, mammoglobin, and GCDFP.
CTA [**2192-3-23**] 1.
CXR [**2192-3-31**] The left-sided pigtail catheter has been removed.
CXR [**2192-4-1**] The right basilar pigtail catheter has been removed.
CT CHEST [**2192-4-1**] (pending)   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 90426**] is a 74y/o lady who presented with acute respiratory failure due to malignant effusion and was found to have serous ovarian adenocarcinoma.
Echocardiogram showed a hypokinetic right ventricle suggestive of PE, so a CT angiogram of her chest was performed which showed no evidence of PE.
Initial CXR demonstrated large bilateral pleural effusions with evidence of pneumonia, and she was started on vancomycin and cefepime for healthcare associated pneumonia.
Outside records obtained from [**Hospital 1281**] hospital indicate that a pleural fluid analysis revealed malignant cells, most likely papillary serous adenocarcinoma, most consistent with origin from Muellerian duct.
Her pleural effusions were tapped and pleural fluid analysis were consistent with exudate and cytology was preliminarily positive for malignancy.
She was aggressively fluid resusciated with IVF with a goal CVP of [**9-14**] mmHg and initially supported with norepinephrine infusion to maintain a MAP of > 65.
Echocardiogram demonstrated normal ejection fraction with no focal wall motion abnormalities.
Upon transfer to the Oncology floor, her O2 sat dropped from 100%RA to the 60's.
with pigtail catheter placement and pleurodesis was performed on [**3-28**] and [**3-30**]; the catheters were removed [**3-30**] and [**3-31**] with sats in the low 90s on 1L.
her BNP is 2467. .
She had a negative workup for C. diff and blood cultures remained negative.
Baseline Cr 0.8 and her Cr was 1.7 on admission.
Her azotemia, creatinine and urine output gradually improved with aggressive fluid resuscitation.
She was pre-hydrated for her CTA and further CT contrast was avoided.
CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast at [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital on [**2192-3-8**] showed ascites but no definite disease; however, this was a very limited study secondary to lack of contrast.
