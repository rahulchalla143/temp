Her VS were T 98.4, HR 86, BP 118/63, RR 18, satting 96% RA.
Labs were remarkable for hct 27, chem 7 notable for creatinine 1.2; LFTs were normal.
CK was 49 with CKMB-I of 5.3.
TropI was 0.07, repeat 0.14.
Her EKG showed ST depressions in the lateral leads (I, aVL, and V4-V6).
She was also started on 2units of blood for Hct <30 in setting of ischemia.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi3 flow.

CT Head: No evidence of hemorrhage, edema mass, or recent infarction.
ECHO [**2157-8-22**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF55-60%).
CXR [**2157-8-21**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the left-sided pleural effusion has almost completely resolved.
Cardiac Cath (logged only, not official): LMCA - patent stent LAD - total occlusion ostial.
LCx - total occlusion mid vessel.
SVG - RCA patent with serial 50-60% lesions LIMA 0 LAD - widely patent   Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo woman h/o CAD, s/p CABGx4, PVD s/p stent, DM, HTN, dyslipidemia presents with chest pain and SOB x 2 days concerning for unstable angina.
EKG shows ST-segment depressions in the lateral leads concern of stent re-stenosis.
Cardiac cath demonstrates patent LMCA stent.
CXR demonstrates small right sided effusion.
# Hypertension: Poorly controlled, SBP ranged from 137-161.
Continue outpatient procrit injections q-weekly, try to increase baseline HCT due to demand ischemia.
In the hospital you underwent a cardiac catheterization that showed that the blood vessels in your heart have adequate blood supply.
You received a blood transfusion and your medicines were adjusted because your blood pressure was high.
Finally, it is recommended that in the future you keep a copy of your ECG and bring it with you to the hospital whenever possible.
