He was diagnosed with likely metastatic lung cancer (to the adrenals) via chest imaging studies and preliminary adrenal biopsy results.
Past Medical History: Metastatic Cancer (Dx [**12/2180**]; Left Lung and B/L Adrenals), PUD (Dx [**2174**] via EGD with negative biopsy; H. Pylori Ab Positive).
NML S1/S2 HEARD BEST WITH FORWARD LEANING.
STRENGTH 5/5 THROUGHOUT EXCEPT 4+/5 W/ PROX THIGH FLEXION.
Pertinent Results: PREVIOUS [**Hospital1 18**] STUDIES:  CXR ([**2180-12-10**]): IMPRESSION: Right infrahilar ill-defined opacity.
CT ABD ([**2180-12-10**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
RIGHT FEMUR XR ([**2180-12-11**]): Five radiographs of the right femur demonstrate no acute fracture or osseous lesion.
Evaluation of the medial and lateral compartment joint spaces of the knee are limited on this non-weight bearing exam.
LEFT ADRENAL BIOPSY ([**2180-12-10**]): A small cluster of atypical cells, which fail to mark with immunostain for pancytokeratin AE1/AE3/CAM 5.2.
The tumor cells show no nuclear immunoreactivity for TTF1 (lung and thyroid marker) with high background staining.
ADDENDUM: The tumor cells show no nuclear immunoreactivity for TTF-1 (lung and thyroid marker) with high background staining.
Brief Hospital Course: During this admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a repeat bronchoscopy ([**12-27**]) with endobronchial biospy which revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
CT head was negative for metastases and a bone scan, interestingly, was negative on [**12-27**].
Imaging of his abdomen and pelvis was also performed and revealed advanced, widespread metastatic disease with multiple large intra-abdominal masses, as well as a large, destructive lytic lesion involving the sacrum.
MRI confirmed neural compromise, and steroids were initiated.
A bedside echo revealed normal EF, no RV strain and no pericardial effusion.
Imaging studies revealed bilateral patchy opacities, worse versus AM, consistent with pulmonary edema +/- PNA.
CPR was not performed per the family's wishes.
Post-mortem examination declined.
