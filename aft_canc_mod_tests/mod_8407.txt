At [**Company 191**] (his PCP's office), he was noted to be look weak and an EKG was concerning for ?
On arrival to ER, EKG was NSR without ST changes, and labs were significant for trop of 0.31, platelets of 9, leukocytosis to 35 with 88% "other" cell types and hematocrit of 21.
Repeat EKG was still non-ischemic and cardiology felt his troponins were not due to active ischemia.
He was moving very little air on exam and felt to be having a COPD exacerbation.
At time of transfer, vitals were 98.7, 93, 150/68, 20, 94% 3L NC.

This limited/ incomplete study may not rule out mosaicism at a level that is standard for such an analysis.
Two cells contained an extra copy of chromosome 8 (TRISOMY 8) and a TRANSLOCATION of chromosomes 15 and 17.
----------------INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300 CELLS------------------- nuc ish(PML,RARA)x3(PML con RARAx2)[89/100] FISH evaluation for a PML-RARA rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the LSI PML/RARA Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for PML at 15q22 and RARA at 17q21.1 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
B-cells comprise 6% of lymphoid-gated events, are polyclonal, and do not express aberrant antigens.
T-cells comprise 57% of lymphoid-gated events, express mature lineage antigens, and have a normal helper-cytotoxic ratio of 1.04 (usual range in blood 0.7-3.0).
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this peripheral blood express myeloid associated antigens (CD13, CD33 (bright), CD15 (bright, subset), express CD64, CD71, lack B and T cell associated antigens, are CD10 (cALLAa) negative, and are negative for CD34, HLA-DR, CD14, CD41, CD11C, CD56 and Glycophorin A.  Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute myeloid leukemia.
Lack of CD34 and HLA-DR [**Last Name (STitle) **] promyelocytic differentiation.
IMAGING: ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2148-9-20**] Conclusions The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-5-26**], contractile function of both ventricles is now significantly reduced.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   [**2148-9-23**] 6:31 PM IMPRESSION: Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass effect.
An alternate consideration is multiple infarctions, some hemorrhagic, likely embolic.
MRI BRAIN    [**2148-9-24**] 3:27 PM CONCLUSION: Multiple acute areas of infarction, many with hemorrhage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
CT HEAD    [**2148-10-1**] 8:28 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo man h/o severe emphysema who presented with a new diagnosis of APML and NSTEMI with EF 30%, s/p intubation [**9-20**] with extubation on [**9-27**], found to have large IPH, multiple strokes, and endocarditis.
He was treated with ATRA and hydroxyurea initially and when his WBC was <10K, his hydroxyurea was stopped.
He was monitored for tumor lysis and DIC and transfused blood products prn to keep his fibrinogen >100 and INR <1.5.
His platelet goal was initially 20K but this was increased to 100K after his intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
We trended his troponins which plateaued at 3.50.
His first ECHO showed moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, with some regional variation (the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex appearing more hypokinetic than the other walls) and LVEF = 30 %.
He was monitored on telemetry and had no significant arrhythmias.
Repeat ECHO on [**2148-9-25**] showed a persistent small vegetation of the mitral valve, complex, non-mobile atheroma of the aortic arch, and mild regional LV systolic dysfunction (EF 45%).
CT head showed a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass effect.
MRI/A on [**2148-9-24**] revealed multiple areas of acute infarction, many with hemorrhage, with a distribution that suggests emboli from a proximal source, likely cardiac.
blood cultures are negative to date to assess for bacteremia.
MRA showed a 5-6mm communicating artery aneurysm as well.
Neurology was consulted & recommended EEG which showed a diffuse encephalopathy pattern and a focal area with epileptogenic potential, but no electrographic seizures.
DIC labs were stable, with a platelet count goal of >100K.
Bronchoscopy on [**2148-9-26**] showed edematous airways with friability but no frank blood.
BAL grew yeast (it was initially reported as mold, concerning for Aspergillus, but galactomannan/glucan were normal and it was re-read as yeast).
# Culture-negative endocarditis:  ECHO on [**2148-9-25**] showed a small vegetation on mitral valve.
Had abdominal CT [**2148-9-26**] which did not show any infectious source.
Left upper extremity U/S done on [**2148-9-27**] to r/o DVT was negative.
Edema and pain persisted, so a repeat LUE U/S was done on [**2148-10-3**] and showed extensive DVT of the L subclavian, axillary and basilic vein.
