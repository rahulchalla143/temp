Patient was tachycardic with HRmax 130s, chest xray revealed aspiration pneumonia.
Patient heart rate was monitored with telemetry during hospitalization.
Pulmonary: On admission patient had active emeses, and chest xr revealed aspiration pneumonia.
He continue require 2L O2, his O2 Sats 95-97%.
Last chest pa/lat demonstrated that pulmonary edema has markedly improved and now mild; bibasilar consolidations larger on the left side and consistent with pneumonia; there is no pneumothorax.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Blood, urine and sputum cultures were negative.
Patient will require close blood sugar monitor when his TPN will started to wean off.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely, his Hct was stable low (23.1-24.6).
On [**6-5**] patient received one unit of RBC, after transfusion Hct was 24.6.
On [**6-6**] patient received one more unit of RBC, his Hct was 29.2 after second transfusion.
After blood transfusions, patient reported increase of energy and patient's O2 requirements decreased from 5L to 3L.
There was concern for a LUE DVT during his stay b/c of some swelling at and around the PICC site, but an ultrasound was performed that showed no clot and the swelling improved with elevation.
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with SMV thrombosis 2.
