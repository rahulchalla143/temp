Admission Date:  [**2126-11-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-12-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2064-9-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine / ct contrast  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8115**] Chief Complaint: Weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation, mechanical ventilation, extubation Incision and drainage of right axillary abscess Placement of central venous catheter   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 62 y/o M with a h/o metastatic melanoma with spine, brain, and adrenal mets who has had left sided weakness for months and has been developing right sided weakness over the past week thought to be related to a known C3-4 mass.
In the ED, the patient's intial vitals were T 97.4, HR 82, BP 108/60, RR 20, and SpO2 98% RA.
Laboratory studies revealed a Na of 123 and K of 6.2.
Given 1amp calcium gluc and an ECG was performed showing ST without peaked Ts.
A CXR showed no acute intrathoracic process.
Had a BP of 88 systolic and received 1L IVF with good response.
Somewhat hypotensive with BP ranging from 80-100 systolic.
He was well until [**12/2123**] when CXR revealed multiple new pulmonary nodules with CT confirmation.
Brain MRI on [**2124-1-25**] revealed multiple brain mets and a PET/CT on [**2124-1-25**] revealed widespread metastatic disease, including a worrisome cervical spine lesion.
He [**Last Name (STitle) 1834**] bronchoscopy and left adrenal biopsy on [**2124-1-26**] with the left subcarinal LN showing no malignant cells and the left adrenal bx c/w metastatic melanoma.
He had slow growth in the LLL lung lesion and [**Date Range 1834**] OR bronchoscopy on [**2126-2-11**] with for bronchoscopy, biopsy and debridement of tumor.
Pathology confirmed melanoma in the lung lesion, but margins were clear and 4 lymph nodes were negative for tumor.
C-spine MRI was performed in [**2126-5-12**] to evaluate LUE numbness (noted intermittently since rigid bronchoscopy on [**2126-2-11**]) with slight increase in size of C3-C4 mass, felt r/t inflammation from ipilimumab.
He subsequently developed progressive left shoulder, arm and neck pain and increased UE numbness, prompting ER evaluation on [**2126-8-14**].
C-spine MRI revealed slight increase in the C3-C4 mass and increased edema and he was started on prednisone.
His brain MRI and torso CT were stable without disease progression.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM: VS: T 96.6, BP 130/72, HR 62, RR 20, SpO2 100% on RA General: NAD, A+Ox3 HEENT: Dry MM, OP clear, no oral ulcerations or exudate.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation anteriorly.

IMAGING / STUDIES: # CHEST (PA & LAT) ([**2126-11-12**] at 5:30 PM): FINDINGS: The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.
There is no interval change with regard to multilevel, multifactorial degenerative changes, most notably with moderate neural foraminal stenosis on the left at C4/C5 level and multilevel disc bulges at C3/C4, C5/C6, and C6-C7.
Intra-abdominal visceral evaluation is highly limited on current examination due to significant streak artifacts.
A 3.7 x 2.0 cm mass in the right upper posterior chest wall soft tissues (3A, 12) is similar as compared to [**2126-8-19**].
As compared to the previous MRI from [**2126-11-14**] there has been no interval change in the size and morphology of intramedullary enhancing lesion at C3-C4 level.
CONCLUSION: The ultrasound examination was negative for DVT in either lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course:  # Hypotension/hyperglycemia: FIRST ICU COURSE upon admission: The initial concern was for sepsis in the setting of an axillary abscess; patient's blood pressures responded well to fluids and he stabilized quickly.
In the ED patient's blood glucose was 500 so likely he was simply volume depleted secondary to osmotic diuresis in his hyperglycemic state.
On his third ICU course, his hypotension was attributed to sepsis in the setting of Pseudomonas bacteremia, which was thought to be due to infection of the right axillary abscess with Pseudomonas (also isolated from culture of the axillary wound).
# GI bleeding: On hospital day 3, patient was noted to pass BRBPR and clots per rectum in setting of platelets of 17.
Patient had a CTA of the abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of active lower GI bleed, but the presence of colonic diverticulosis.
Obtained MRI of c-spine and brain which did not show interval progression of metastatic disease, though the study was technically limited.
# Acute kidney injury: Prior to hospitalization, patient had a baseline creatinine of 1.0.
On presentation his creatinine was 2.4 and continued to climb to 2.8.
The patient's serum creatinine improved with fluids to 1.1 at the time of transfer to the oncology floor.
His serum creatinine remained stable through the remainder of his hospitalization.
The patient did undergo an MRI of the brain and cervical spine to monitor the patient's disease, and it did not show interval progression of disease.
# Diabetes mellitus type 2: Patient's finger stick blood glucose were checked with meals and prior to bedtime.
His blood sugars were difficult to control during his stay due to his continued high dose steroids.
He received platelets early during his admission to prevent GI bleeding with transfusion goal to keep platelets greater than 50.
The patient's platelet count recovered later in his hospitalization.
A TSH was drawn that returned elevated, but with a normal free T4.
He will need repeat TFTs 4 weeks from discharge as well as Endocrine followup.
# Elevated LDH: His LDH rose since his last admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
His hematocrit remained stable as has his Tbili suggesting that the elevated LDH was not due to hemolysis.
The patient's AST and ALT were within normal limits (previously were trending down in the setting of shocked liver secondary to sepsis) which does not suggest a liver pathology.
Because of the patient's prolonged dexamethasone course, he was started on PCP prophylaxis with Bactrim DS.
Urine lytes were consistent with SIADH in the setting of his known metastatic melanoma.
Upon the patient's second [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course, his sodium improved with stress dose steroids.
On the floor, as his Dexamethasone was being weaned, his serum sodium was noted to be falling.
Endocrine consult felt that an adrenal or thyroid etiology for his hyponatremia was unlikely, but that he will need a slow taper of his steroids given his prolonged high dose course.
# Transition of Care: -- Continue Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin for total of 4 weeks after negative blood culture on [**2126-11-24**].
-- Monitor serum sodium initially every 2-3 days, and then weekly as sodium levels stabilize.
-- Repeat TFTs 4 weeks from discharge.
