Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to [**2197-11-24**].
The heart size and mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable given the portable character of the study and intubation of the patient.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
echo FOCUSED VIEWS: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2195-2-23**], left ventricular function is similar.
Recommend CT for further evaluation.
Abd US showed ascites which was tapped and concerning for SBP.
