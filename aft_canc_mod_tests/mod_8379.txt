Now the patient is off dopamine with improved blood pressures.
His blood pressure transiently improved, but it required monitoring, and the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit secondary to a decreased blood pressure again.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Vital signs on admission revealed his temperature was 98.3 degrees Fahrenheit, his blood pressure was 137/83, his heart rate was 75, his respiratory rate was 18, and his oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the mucous membranes were moist.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed irregularly irregular heart sounds.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
The abdominal examination revealed bowel sounds were present.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on admission revealed his white blood cell count was 7.1, his hematocrit was 39, and his platelets were 18.
His INR was 2.6.
Sodium was 136, potassium was 4.6, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 24, creatinine was 2, and blood glucose was 80.
Urinalysis showed moderate bacteria; otherwise all were negative.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic esophageal cancer with atrial flutter awaiting transesophageal echocardiogram with cardioversion who was admitted to the C-MED Service.
His rate was controlled with medications properly.
He had a slight increase in his creatinine which was closely monitored.
Urine studies were sent and were pending on [**2149-8-2**].
This was concerning since his normal creatinine was about 1 on [**2149-7-26**] but then increased to 1.2 to then 1.4 and then to 2 and then to 2.4 and then 2.5.
On [**2149-8-3**], the patient was cardioverted chemically because of atrial fibrillation that persisted and was coming back and was making the patient's heart rate go up anywhere from the 120s to 140s.
After 2 mg of ibutilide, the patient cardioverted into a normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate in the 70s to 80s.
Continued with hydration and monitored creatinine closely.
If his heart rate remained largely over 100, the patient was planned for getting started verapamil as well.
He was sent out for liver function tests and pulmonary function tests; which were pending, with a goal heart rate of less than 100 consistently and with the hope of cardioverting him with amiodarone over time.
His increased creatinine was starting to improve, so his acute renal failure was improving; which was most likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis given that his fractional excretion of sodium was 3%; consistent with an acute tubular necrosis picture.
We continued to monitor his creatinine still.
On the day of discharge, the patient was back on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2 to 3 with follow-up INR check regularly.
The patient also had an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital6 733**] for INR checks and creatinine checks.
His creatinine started to go down even further.
On the day of discharge, his creatinine was down to 2.4.
The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (his primary care physician) and to have his INR checked on [**2149-8-11**] at 3:30 p.m. (telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**]).
The patient was to get liver, thyroid, and pulmonary tests regularly.
Warfarin 5 mg by mouth once per day (with regular followup with a goal INR of 2 to 3).
