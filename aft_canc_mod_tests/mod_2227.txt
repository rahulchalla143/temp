His BP was checked at this time and SBP 77, and the MD at rehab felt that he appeared dry so sent him to the ED for eval.
In the ED, the patient's VS were rectal temp of 33 and BP 80/60.
Labs notable for HCT 20.7 (from 25), platelets 36 (from 60), albumin 1.5, T. Bili 2.0, sodium of 160, BUN/creatinine 91/3.7, INR 2.3 (from 1.8), lactate of 4.
He was initially given 2L IVF without any change in his SBP so peripheral levophed was started and labs were checked.
His HCT returned at 20 (recent baseline of 24-25) with platelets of 36 and his sodium was 160.
He was then given 2 units of emergency blood (uncrossmatched) and 2 more units of crossmatched blood (HCT 20--27--32--33.4).
After this his SBP increased to the low 100s, but then decreased again to the 70s.
A Right IJ was placed and neo was started in addition to levo and his BP came up to the 90-100s.
FAST exam showed trace effusion, diffuse hypokinesis.
Trop 0.08, EKG looked "ok".
Dx paracentesis was done that showed 154 WBC with 74% polys.
CT Torso was then performed which showed ?multifocal pneumonia without other intrabdominal pathology.
His ABG on fIo2 100%, PEEP of 5, rate of 14 was 7.36/38/117.
Vitals on transfer: 34.9 106/60 80 14 100% on Vent fIo2 100%, PEEP of 5 rate of 14 AC.
Neo at 2, Levophed at 0.12.
6.5L NS, CVP 11, SV02 80s.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2120-12-14**] atrial fibrillation is new.
Lung volumes are diminished especially on the left with marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-11-8**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher and a left pleural effusion is now apparent.
[**2121-1-11**] CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS: 1.
Evaluation of the gallbladder is limited on this non-contrast-enhanced technique and in the setting of large volume ascites.
Recommend clinical correlation and abdominal ultrasound could be obtained if there is concern for acute cholecystitis.
Random cortisol, TSH, FT4 were wnl.
Echo was w/o focal findings.
CT Torso appeared to have multifocal pneumonia, though findings may be chronic and related to patient's chronic aspiration.
# Anemia: Chronic anemia, but lower than baseline on arrival (20 from 25).
As above, we stopped trending labs given goals of care  # Acute Renal Failure: Cr 3.7 from 1.4.
Improved with fluid rehydration to 3.1.
