EEG and carotid US were unremarkable and MRI/MRA showed evidence of old infarctions and abnormal signal in the clivus thought to be compatible with Paget's Disease.

The appearance of the head is stable compared to this prior exam of [**2154-5-13**].
There is some increased signal on T2 and FLAIR weighted sequence in the left thalamus, which is new from prior study and might represent an intracurrent event.
The CT scan of [**6-23**] does not strongly suggest the presence of Paget's disease  [**2154-6-30**] 07:00AM BLOOD CRP-2.67*  Brief Hospital Course: 71 y/o woman with a history of HTN and dyslipidemia who presented [**2154-6-23**] with difficulties of executive function and short-term memory/recall difficulties.
An LP did show signs of blood, but infectious work up was negative.
EEG showed bursts of bifrontal slowing with reversal of theta waves at left frontal region, c/w encephalopathy.
Lumbar puncture was non diagnostic for vasculitis with cytology and cultures (Lyme, EBV, CMV, VZV and fungal) negative.
[**Doctor First Name **] weakly positive with a titer of 1:40 and complement levels were within normal limits.
A brain biopsy was considered for definitive diagnosis but was deferred when her neurological condition improved significantly at which time the risks outweighed the benefits.
Malignancy w/u consisted of CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis was significant only for adrenal masses not large enough to suggest adrenal adenomas.
A TTE was nonsuggestive of a cardiac embolic source.
In addition, an admission EKG showed sinus rhythm and not afib.
TTE showed a complex, nonmobile atheroma was seen in the descending thoracic aorta which is an unlikely source of emboli.
GIBleed: while on asa for her stroke, she was found on the bathroom floor in pool of blood mixed with stool and could not obtain a blood pressure.
Her EGD showed only signs of trauma from NGT placement, colonoscopy the following day only showed diverticuli and polyp at 40cm in descending colon which was not removed, but for which she will need follow colonoscopy for polypectomy in the future.
She was transfused 4uPRBC with good result, and her hematocrit stabilized and remained stable throughout her stay and bleeding was likley secondary to divertiuclar bleed.
HTN: Antihypertensives were held given the question of an acute stroke her blood pressures remained stable off antihypertensive without signs of hypertension, and can be restarted as outpatient by PCP if needed.
Her fluid cultures and cytology were negative and no other clear source.
AFB was added on the pleural fluid and was negative and induced sputums were sent to rule out active TB, but she did not have further cough with her current cough and respiratory symptoms and was ruled out for active TB.
UTI: An initial infectious workup was negative including negative CXR and urinalysis.
An RPR was nonreactive.
Her last UA on [**7-4**] was positive for e.coli, but at the time she still had her foley in place.
The foley was removed and repeat clean cath UA was clean, culture negative except contamination, so antibiotics were discontinued.
