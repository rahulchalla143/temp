In the ED, CXR was normal, but CT head showed superior left parietal lobe vasogenic edema concerning for mass/metastatic lesion.
An MRI of the brain then showed a 1.5cm enhancing left parietal subcortical mass with surrounding vasogenic edema.
She is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup of her brain mass and management.
Of note, she did have a mammogram on [**2100-12-28**] that showed dense nodular breast parenchyma with multiple nodular and dilated tubulovillous structures in the retroareolar area suggesting bilateral cysts, solid nodules, or dilated ducts.

Head CT ([**Hospital1 **]): Superior left parietal lobe vasogenic edema concerning for mass lesion rather than an acute vascular insult.

A T2 abnormality and faint enhancement is also seen at the medial left occipital lobe and T2 abnormality on the previous outside MRI examination from [**Hospital3 **] is seen in the right frontal region.
Ct head [**3-14**] - Status post left craniotomy for left parietal lesion resection with trace amounts of post-procedural subarachnoid blood, pneumocephalus, and localized sulcal effacement  MRI Brain w/w/o contrast [**3-15**] - Status post resection of left parietal lobe lesion.
MRI brain Wand study - [**3-16**] - No short-interval change with regard to expected post-surgical Preliminary Reportchanges and residual enhancement following resection of left parietal lobe  Ct heat [**3-16**] - Status post left parietal mass resection with expected postoperative change, but no evidence of hemorrhage or infarct  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2102-3-17**] 1.
ACUTE CARE: # Brain Tumor: the patient was stablized on Decadron 4mg [**Hospital1 **], Keppra.
Neurosurgery was also consulted and the patient went to the OR for resection of her brain mass on [**2102-3-14**].
A head Ct obtained post-op showed slight blood at surgical site o/w no evidece of infarct or increase edema.
Post-op Head Ct showed post op changes.
