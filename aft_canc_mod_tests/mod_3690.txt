Today, his PCP had organized an MRI of his brain at [**Hospital 246**] Hospital, which showed a right intraparenchymal hemorrhage, so he was sent in for further evaluation.
In the ER, he continued to have a [**11-25**] headache, so he was given morphine prior to the neurology consult, and he was placed on a labetalol drip as his systolic BPs kept going as high as the 200 mmHg range.
Prostate cancer - transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy on [**7-6**], [**2164**], revealing [**3-30**] cores positive for [**Doctor Last Name **] 3+3=6 disease with up to 40% of core length involved - there is a question of starting brachytherapy 3.
Physical Exam: T-98.8 HR-74 BP-180/80 RR-16 SpO2-99%  Gen: Lying in bed, no bruising noted over the head HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, supple, no carotid or vertebral bruit Back: No point tenderness or erythema CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd: +BS, soft, nontender Ext: No edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: General:  alert, awake, lethargic (received morphine) Orientation:  oriented to person, place, but not date, keeps saying 11, 11, 11.
VII: Mild L facial droop with slightly large palpebral fissure on the L. VIII: Hearing intact to finger rub bilaterally.
He appears to have full strength in his arms and legs - possible 4s in FEs but bilateral.
Rest of the exam not attempted due to inattention  Reflexes: 2 and symmetric throughout.

CT angiography of the head and neck are normal.
CXR Cardiac size is top normal.
Repeat NCHCT [**2164-12-22**] Similar appearance of right basal ganglia hemorrhage with intraventricular extension, but increased lateral ventricle caliber as compared to eight hours ago, suggestive of a developing mild hydrocephalus.
MRI Head (with and without contrast: 1.
Somewhat limited study due to motion.
He underwent repeat head CT and MRI with and without contrast to further evaluate for possible underlying pathology.
Patient's exam is reassuring.
Will need follow-up with PCP once discharged from rehab and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 6550**] 2nd [**Doctor Last Name 360**] such as ACEI if BP not well controlled.
You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of the cause and management of this intracerebral hemorrhage.
We think that your bleed was a consequence of mild hypertension and aging of small vessels of your brain given that no underlying lesion was noted on MRI scan of your brain.
You were started on hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure control.
You will need close follow-up with your blood pressure and likely titration of this med and possible addition of another medication (i.e.
