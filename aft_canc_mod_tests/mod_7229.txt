In ED, noted to be tachycardic with a HR 122, BP 157/82.
Initial ECG reportedly showed STD with TWI in v3-v5.
First set of labs were remarkable for hyperglycemia and a mildly elevated WBC at 11.9, but without left shift.
This examination showed no new WMA and overall preserved EF.
A later echo [**Hospital1 3780**] RV pressure overload.
He sustains this for a little over 1 minute and then a wide complex rhythm at a rate of 70s, and ultimately PEA arrest.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CTA [**2101-10-7**] FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube tip is positioned at the carina.
MRI [**2101-10-25**] OF BRACHIAL PLEXUS MRI OF THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS: A marker was placed on the skin overlying the site of palpable abnormality in the region of the right mid clavicle.
Within the left inferior sternocleidomastoid muscle (series 8, image 15), abnormal foci of high signal on T1- and T2-weighted images spanning an area of 2.1 x 1.4 cm are [**Month/Day/Year 3780**] within the muscle, likely represent resolving hemorrhage.
Resolving small intramuscular hematoma within the left inferior sternocleidomastoid muscle   Brief Hospital Course: PULMONARY EMBOLUS / SHOCK Pt with suspected PE as shown by RV dilation on Echo with decreased LF volume.
Was given thrombolysis with TPA during PEA arrest, and EKG shows subsequent improvment.
After arrest, pt recieved artic sun, which ended on [**10-7**].
PE was confirmed with chest CT.  Cardiac Enzymes were initially elevated after arrest, but began to trend down.
They were restarted out of concern for penumonia, and then stoped again after 3-5 days when no cultures were positive.
The patient will need a repeat ECHO in 6 months.
A hypercoagulability workup could be considered in the future, but given likely continuous anticoagulation, it is not expected to change management.
Lupus AC and Anti Cardiolipin AB were wnl.
The patient was anticoagulated with heparin and bridged to coumadin with an INR goal of [**1-15**].
His hematocrit and coagulation factors were followed daily, but with discontinuation of heparin his INR became subtherapeutic.
At the time of discharge, the INR was 1.7 while taking lovenox.
Serial chest x-rays were performed showing improvement of a collapsed lung and decreasing pulmonary infiltrate.
He was temporarily oliguric, with a Creatinine peak to 5.8.
His creatinine fell to 1.8 at the time of discharge.
A CT of the head was negative.
The patient received a perfect score on the mini-mental status exam on [**10-21**].
His PT and PTT continue to be prolonged in the context of heparin/coumadin therapy.
DIABETES The patient has had diabetes for over 15 years and has managed his blood sugars at home with glucophage, actos, and glucotrol.
LEUKOCYTOSIS ?UTI The patient's white blood cell count became elevated after transfer to the floor, peaking at 15.0 on [**10-18**].
He was also found to have a positive urine analysis at this time and was placed on Augmentin 500 [**Hospital1 **] for 1 week given concern for urinary tract infection and the effect of conventional UTI therapy on INR levels.
A final urine culture was found to be negative and there were no signs of infection at discharge.
His mean corpuscular volume was borderline low and iron studies were consistent with a mixed iron deficiency anemia and anemia of inflammation.
A reticulocyte count was found to be appropriate for his anemia and the patient was placed on supplemental iron.
His hematocrit is currently stable.
CAD MANAGEMENT The patient had a cardiac catheterization in [**11-16**] that showed total occlusion in the mid-right coronary artery and an angioplasty attempt during procedure was unsuccessful.
The patient has been medically managed since then on Metoprolol, Aspirin, Zocor, and Prinivil and despite the pathology seen on cardiac cath, has remained clinically stable.
His liver enzymes returned to [**Location 213**] on [**10-20**] and his Zocor was resumed at that time.
