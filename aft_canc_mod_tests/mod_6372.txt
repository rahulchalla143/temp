EKG [**2182-7-25**]: Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2182-7-24**] modest anterior T wave changes are slightly improved.
TTE [**2182-7-24**]: IMPRESSION: Mild focal left ventricular dysfunction c/w CAD.
Left ventricular systolic function is depressed with anterior hypokinesis (regional wall motion not fully assessed; the apex is not well seen but is probably hypokinetic).
CXR [**2182-7-25**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
CT Head [**2182-7-26**]: 1.
Respiratory distress improved signficantly after removal of the tumor by rigid bronchoscopy and patient was weaned to room air with O2 saturation >95%.
He has follow-up scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Interventional Pulmonology on [**2182-8-27**] with a CT scan on that day as well.
Head CT was obtained and showed no evidence of metastasis, and patient was placed on heparin drip.
ECG showed some non-specific ST changes and TWIs in lateral leads that are a change compared to prior earlier this month.
Also had elevated troponin to 0.14 and CK-MB but these were trending down prior to discharge.
Patient was voiding spontaneously but continued to have large PVR and straight catheterization was required.
Patient developed burning on urination and UA showed evidence of infection.
# DM2 - Blood glucose was well controlled with insulin sliding scale while in hospital .
