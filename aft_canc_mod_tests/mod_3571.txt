PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: There has been interval removal of a right chest tube and an NG tube.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
LV systolic function appears depressed, although in the presence of atrial fibrillation the left ventricular ejection fraction (at least moderately reduced) cannot be quantitated with certainty.
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
The study is inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis.
Ingestion of thick barium also shows small amount of aspiration with no anastomotic leak.
Please see the video oropharyngeal component of the examination for further details.

He was found to have tachycardia with a heart rate in the 160's and his beta-blocker was restarted with a good response.
His potassium and magnesium were repleted to maintain a Mg of 2.0 and K+ > 4.5.
On postoperative day #4 the chest tube was removed and a chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax.
He was seen by speech for a video swallow which revealed mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia characterized by reduced oral control.
On POD#9 patient became hypotensive with SBP in the 80's and went into atrial fibrillation with heart rate in the 150s, he was bolused and had his medications staggered.
A CTA was also performed to rule out a pulmonary embolus which was negative, however a LLL effusion was noted.
On POD#11 his neck wound was found to a small amount of drainage it was opened and packed with iodophone.
