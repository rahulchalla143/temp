Karyotype was 46 XY.
Apgar scores were 6 and 7 and 1 minute and 5 minutes, respectively.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Weight of 560 g (less than 10th percentile), OFC of 22.5 cm (less than 10th percentile), length of 29 cm (less than 10th percentile).
He had a normal head and neck examination with anterior fontanel which was flat.
Cardiac examination evaluated normal first heart sound and second heart sound, without murmurs.
There was a gonad noted in the right inguinal canal.
The spine was intact, and neurologic examination was nonfocal and age appropriate.
At 28 days of age, the infant was on pretty moderate-to-low level of ventilatory support with peak inspiratory pressure of 19, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, and a respiratory rate of 18 on 30% to 40% oxygen.
He never had an echocardiogram suggestive of a PDA.
The patient did receive hydrocortisone as noted above and had rapid improvement in both sugars and blood pressures.
With normal chromosomes, cortisol levels, subsequent glucoses, blood pressures, and with a phallus size which they deemed to be within the range of normal, they felt that there was no further endocrine workup needed at this time, and they signed off.
The infant has had stable blood sugars throughout the rest of the hospital stay.
GENITOURINARY:  An abdominal ultrasound was done looking at internal structures due to the presence of small phallus.
There was an early suggestion of mild hydronephrosis, but repeat examination showed that this was actually normal.
Feeds were reinstituted while on the oscillatory ventilator since he did not show any signs of significant hypotension.
Bone films to evaluate for the presence of nutritional rickets have been noncontributory.
A repeat alkaline phosphatase level is lower than before.
His peak bilirubin was 6.3 during his hospital stay.
Due to the presence of somewhat asymmetric growth restriction, a urine cytomegalovirus was sent which was negative.
