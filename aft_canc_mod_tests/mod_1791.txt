On arrival to the Emergency Room, the patient's temperature was 95.6, pulse 73, blood pressure 94/48, oxygen saturation 94% on room air at rest, with activity the patient desaturated to 89% on room air, and the patient was transferred to the floor.
In [**2140-5-19**], Persantine MIBI showed no electrocardiogram changes, no ejection fraction, no perfusion defects.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On admission temperature was 97.2?????
?, heart rate 76, blood pressure 110/55, respirations 34, initially 22 when more calm, oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood cell count 4.8, hematocrit 41, platelet count 175,000; sodium 133, chloride 99.
CT angiogram on [**2142-7-15**], showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus, marked progression of bilateral infrahilar lung mass and subcarinal and bilateral hilar lobe lymphadenopathy.
Head MRI showed large intracellular soft tissue mass lesion with suprasellar extension, invasion of the cavernous sinuses, superior displacement and compression of the optic chiasm and homogenous enhancement, most likely representing a large pituitary macroadenoma, possibility of meningioma, no mass affect on the brain parenchyma.
CT angiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
On hospital day #3, the patient's oxygen saturation dropped to 88% on 10 L nasal cannula with stable blood pressure.
The patient subsequently underwent bronchoscopy with stenting of the bronchus intermediate and left mainstem   bronchus with Argon coagulation of right lower lobe tumor.
Shortly after extubation, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 90s associated with decreased urine output of an average of 40 cc/hr.
The patient subsequently became hypotensive again with decreasing oxygen saturation and increasing congestion with question of aspiration pneumonia versus postobstructive pneumonia.
The patient's hypotension was not responsive to 2.5 L normal saline fluid boluses, and the patient was started on Dopamine for blood pressure support.
On hospital day #8, the patient was not able to be weaned off Dopamine, and cortical stimulation test was sent which was positive suggesting adrenal insufficiency as the cause of hypotension.
The patient had an MRI of the brain which showed a large intracellular soft tissue mass lesion with suprasellar extension, invasion of the cavernous sinuses, superior displacement and compression of the optic chiasm, likely representing a large pituitary microadenoma versus meningioma.
Laboratory studies indicated low somatomedin (IgF -1), low ACTH, low FSH and LH with a normal prolactin, and low free T4.
The patient subsequently developed hypernatremia with sodium of 152.
The patient's serum sodium subsequently decreased to 142 in two days, and DDAVP was discontinued.
The patient underwent video oropharyngeal swallow study which showed aspiration of thin liquids with spontaneous coughing.
Swallowing repeat study showed aspiration with paste and thin liquids.
Hyponatremia:  The patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium of 126.
The patient is with an element of SIADH with urine osmolality of 342 and urine sodium of 94.
The patient's serum sodium subsequently increased to 132.
