Admission Date:  [**2200-6-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-6-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-9-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pressure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2200-6-5**] - Cardiac Catheterization [**2200-6-10**] - CABGx5 (LIMA->LAD, SVG->Diag, SVG->Ramus, SVG->OM, SVG->PLV); Closure of Aorto-Pulmonary artery fistula.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 78 yo man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and exercise echo [**1-21**] showing inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis, who presents with a 1 day history of chest pressure at rest.
Because of these symptoms, he had an Exercise Echo in [**1-21**] which showed in the presence of baseline 0.5 mm of inferolateral ST segment depression, there was an additional 2.0 mm of horizontal ST segment depression at peak exercise, these changes became downsloping in morphology during recovery.
He went back to bed, but was again woken up at 2:10 am with the same chest pressure which was relieved with NTG SL x1.
Since he was still having breakthrough angina despite his medical regimen, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended cardiac catheterization at that time but the patient wanted more time to make the decision.
In the ED, vitals were temp 95.3, HR 72, bp 157/88, RR 20, SaO2 98% on RA.
His bp peaked at 197/90, and he was given 1.5" of nitropaste with improvement in bp to 140/90.
EKG showed ST depressions in V2-V6.
CEs TropT <0.01, CK 92.
CXR showed increased opacity in the right lower lobe concerning for possible infection/pneumonia.
Past Medical History: -CAD, no interventions, but Exercise Echo [**1-21**] showed regional dysfunction with more extensive infero-lateral hypokinesis and distal inferior hypokinesis -Hypertension -Hyperlipidemia -Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, diagnosed in [**8-19**] when routine lab work showed WBC of 19,000 with 76% lymphocytes, CLL on immunophenotyping -Seborrheic keratoses -Right sided hearing loss  Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use.
Physical Exam: VS - temp 95.8, HR 74, bp 144/90, RR 20, SaO2 97% on RA, wt 144 lb Gen: WDWN male in NAD.
Pulses: Right: DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: IMAGING: ECG ([**6-5**]): Sinus rhythm at a rate of 79.
CXR Portable ([**6-5**]): FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.
Cardiac Catheterization ([**6-5**]): COMMENTS: 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling pressure with a LVEDP of 22 mmHg.
There was moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension with a central pressure of 170/77 mmHg.
Left ventriculography demonstrated no mitral regurgitation.
TTE ([**6-6**]): The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
CXR PA/Lateral ([**6-6**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-5**], the cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal in size.
[**2200-6-6**] MRI 1.
However, this fistula was not well visualized, and cardiac CT was recommended to the referring physicians to further characterize this finding.
[**2200-6-10**] ECHO PRE-BYPASS: 1.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Heparin, Integrilin and Plavix were given and a cardiac catheterization was performed.
A cardiac MRI was obtained which demonstrated a tortuous fistula arising form the left main coronary artery and coursing to the left lateral aspect of the main pulmonary artery.
He was later transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
