Here, a CXR demonstrated a large left pleural effusion, nearly effacing the entire lung.
The patient became briefly hypotensive, down to 75/50; aggressive IVF only increased his bp to the low 80's, so he was placed on a norepinephrine gtt that was eventually stopped as his bp improved over the next few hours.
He had a CT that also demonstrated a large effusion with contralateral mediastinal shift; it was read as concerning for fungal infection.

#Tachycardia -- will check ecg but suspect secondary to infection #Hypotension -- Pt's bp dropped to 80's while in the ED, did not respond to fluids and required transient norepi, now off pressors and with bp's in high 90's, low 100's.
His ECG showed no changes consistent with ACS.

CT CHest [**10-24**] 1.
On Chest CT the patient had left lung collapse with effusion and likely plasmacytoma (white-out on CXR).
Pleural fluid culture had no growth, and gram stain revealed 79% other cells (thought to be plasma cells - though cytology was pending).
Sputum cultures were sent and grew Aspergillus [**Country 11730**], GPR and GPC.
Bronchoscopy was performed on [**10-28**] and confirmed persistent LLL collapse.
Neurologic exam revealed no corneal reflexes or pupillary reflexes.
Out of concern for CNS process, head CT was done and showed no acute changes.
ECG showed no changes consistent with ACS.
He received IV fluid boluses as needed at keep SBP > 90. .
His anemia and thrombocytopenia were at their baselines.
