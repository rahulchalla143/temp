She had prior outside CT scans on [**2195-4-8**] that demonstrated a 6 cm focus of decreased density within the liver and a 2.6 cm exophytic mass coming off the posterior cortex of the left kidney.
On [**4-17**] an outside MRI demonstrated a 7 x 4.5 x 7.5 cm mass thought to possibly represent an atypical area of focal nodular hyperplasia.
On [**6-5**] a MRI demonstrated a mass measuring 7.7 x 6.1 x 6.9 cm within segment 4 of the liver but extending into the anterior segments of segment 5.
A biopsy of the lesion on [**6-18**] demonstrated metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma positive for CK7, cytokeratin cocktail, P504S/AMACR and carbonic anhydrase 9.
The tumor was negative for mammoglobin, GCDF, TTF-1 and PAX-2.
Chest CT demonstrated no evidence of metastases.
CT colonoscopy demonstrated only a 6.5 mm polyp in the mid transverse colon.

A CT chest and abdomen was obtained to rule out residual effusion.
A repeat thoracentesis was performed on [**10-12**] and the WBC increased to 7625 with 50% polys.
Her UOP was adequate throughout her postoperative course, and her creatinine remained stable (0.8-1.3).
She worked with physical therapy and was able to ambulate in the hallways with assistance however, it was believed that she would benefit from a short stay in a rehab facility but then was cleared by PT for home with home PT  Heme: CT of abdomen obtained on [**10-9**] to evaluate pleural effusion and possible bile leak returned an incisdental finding of "Status post left partial nephrectomy with thrombus in the left renal vein."
