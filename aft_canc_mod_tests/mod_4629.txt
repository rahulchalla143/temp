Strength full power [**5-21**] on R, [**4-21**] on L.  Sensation: Intact to light touch bilaterally.
On Discharge: AOx3, following commands, speech intact Right upper and lower extremity weakness more pronounced: Right upper extremity [**2-21**] throughout Right lower extremity 3-4/5 throughout   Pertinent Results: [**2161-6-14**] 09:10AM   WBC-7.5 RBC-3.49* HGB-11.8* HCT-35.5* MCV-102* MCH-34.0* MCHC-33.4 RDW-16.8* [**2161-6-14**] 09:10AM   PLT COUNT-150 [**2161-6-14**] 09:10AM   PT-12.0 PTT-21.0* INR(PT)-1.0  MRI [**2161-6-14**]: Enhancement of dominant right posterior frontal lesion, with extensive surrounding white matter edema.
CT Torso [**2161-6-15**]: 1.
Biopsy of the central nodule by bronchoscopy could be considered.
A followup CT in three months is recommended.
Further evaluation with ultrasound may be obtained.
Thyroid U/S [**2161-6-16**]: 1.
Bone Scan [**2161-6-17**]: No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
fMRI [**2161-6-18**]: 1.
MRI WAND [**2161-6-21**]: FINDINGS: There is re-demonstration of the previously noted enhancing lesion within the posterior aspect of the right frontal lobe superiorly, as well as its surrounding edema.
Post op MRI [**2161-6-25**]: 1.
Over the next few days, she [**Date Range 1834**] various tests as part of a metastatic workup including a CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, bone scan, and thyroid ultrasound.
Given the proximity of her lesion to the motor areas of the brain and her preoperative weakness, this was not an unexpected short term complication and function of the left leg and arm should improve over time.
Preliminary pathology reveals that this is most likely representative of metastasis from her renal cell carcinoma.
A CT torso revealed masses in her LUL and RML of her lungs, a nodule in her thyroid and a small mass in her breast.
A biopsy of her LUL nodule was considered, but after consultation with both interventional [**Month (only) **] and interventional pulmonology, it was deemed too risky to go after as it was near the hilum.
The thyroid mass was felt to be most likely consistent with a colloid cyst and thought to be benign after an ultrasound was obtained and reviewed with [**Month (only) **].
On [**6-26**], her PTT was elevated which was felt to be secondary to heparin flushes through her IJ.
This was continued through [**6-29**], when her HIT antibody [**Doctor First Name **] came back negative.
Her creatinine was been elevated but improving during her admission with the most recent creatinine value being 1.1.
Around [**6-26**], her potassium levels began to slowly increase to a peak of 5.4  Renal was curbsided who felt this was likely due to the heparin flush as that is a known effect of heparin.
Her BUN has been elevated, which is thought to be secondary to steroids.
