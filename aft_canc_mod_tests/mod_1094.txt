During the procedure she received pressors transiently for SBP in 60s.
She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring of her hypotension.
No deficits to light touch throughout.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-4-3**], multiple abnormalities as previously noted persist without major change.
CXR [**5-7**]: 1.
Remainder of exam is otherwise unchanged.
LUE U/S [**5-9**]: No deep venous thrombosis in the left upper extremity.
Hip/femur x-rays [**5-9**]: No fracture.
CXR [**5-10**]: Overall similar to [**2122-5-8**], but with relative increased opacity in both right and left mid zones compared with [**2122-5-7**].
TTE [**5-12**]: No significant pericardial effusion.
Arterial Doppler LUE [**5-15**]: Unremarkable Doppler waveforms throughout the left extremity, signifying no significant stenosis.
An echo was obtained to evaluate for effusion (negative).
Her blood pressure remained stable on the floor in SBP 90-110 range, although with diuresis (see below), came down to SBP 100.
At this point, she seemed volume overloaded on exam and CXR.
A final contributor may be her radiation-induced lung disease leading to impaired ventilation.
Her hypercapnea was also noted to be chronic given a normal pH on ABG while pCO2 of 77.
Upper extremity ultrasounds showed no DVT or arterial stenosis.
Buttock lesions: DFA was negative, viral culture pending for HSV and VZV.
X-rays were negative and pain improved greatly, although she still noted intermittent pain.
