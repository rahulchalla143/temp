Admission Date:  [**2189-7-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2189-7-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2144-6-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The patient was admitted for a CAT scan that showed a mass as an outpatient.
Blood drawn from that admission showed an increased white blood cell count, and the patient was sent to the Emergency Department with a question gastrointestinal infection.
His antibiotics were then changed again, and he had an abdominal CT which showed a duodenal mass, and the patient was admitted.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 105/81, pulse was 91, respiratory rate was 14, oxygen saturation of 99% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed extraocular movements were intact.
The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, first heart sound and second heart sound.
Lymph node examination showed no cervical, axillary, epitrochlea, inguinal nodes.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories revealed sodium was 137, potassium was 3.3, chloride was 93, bicarbonate was 27, blood urea nitrogen was 21, creatinine was 1.3, blood glucose was 161.
Calcium was 9.5.
His white blood cell count was 12 (down from 19 prior to admission).
His hematocrit was 39 and platelets were 499.
PT was 12.3, INR was 1.1, PTT was 22.7.
Total protein was 7.3, albumin was 4.3, bilirubin was 0.3, AST was 16, ALT was 13, amylase was 33, lipase was 5.
He had pending blood cultures.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A CT of the abdomen showed a duodenal mass abutting the aorta.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine Service for evaluation of his abdominal mass.
ABDOMINAL MASS:  The patient received an esophagogastroduodenoscopy to try to obtain a biopsy specimen; however, he was too tall for the colonoscope that they used, and no adequate specimen was obtained.
On hospital day two, he did receive a percutaneous biopsy of his abdominal mass.
The results of this biopsy were initially sent to [**Hospital6 1708**] because of a question of lymphoma as a differential diagnosis, and when it was realized that this was not a lymphoma, the biopsy specimen was sent back to [**Hospital1 188**].
The lesion on the liver was further evaluated by a magnetic resonance imaging which showed the lesions, but it did not clarify whether they were metastatic in nature.
The lesions did appear cystic in nature, and it was recommended that he receive CT and magnetic resonance imaging followup after surgery for these lesions.
The patient also had GGT and CEA levels drawn; both of which were elevated with a GGT of 265 and a CEA of 12.
Blood cultures grew back [**6-11**] tubes with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
His peripherally inserted central catheter line was pulled, and the culture tip also grew out methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient was started on vancomycin after initial treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics before his cultures came back.
after a trough level came back at less than 5.
He had initial surveillance cultures drawn three days after spiking the temperatures, and these also grew back positive Staphylococcus.
He then had next surveillance cultures drawn two days after this (on [**7-20**]), and those have not grown back Staphylococcus to date (on [**7-21**])  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] began having diarrhea a few days after starting on the vancomycin intravenous therapy for his methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
A workup of this anemia showed a very low reticulocyte index which was inappropriately low for his degree of anemia.
Iron studies have been ordered including total iron-binding capacity, ferritin, and iron levels; and these were currently pending.
Mr. [**Known lastname **]' INR has also been increasing during this admission.
His PTT was also supratherapeutic while his INR was 1.6, and this may also have been contributing to this increased INR.
His magnetic resonance imaging did not show any large findings in his liver, and it was unlikely that liver failure is an etiology of this increased INR.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an electrocardiogram done to evaluate for question of endocarditis when he initially was found to have Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
This electrocardiogram showed Q waves in II, III, and aVF; which were likely related to a possible old inferior myocardial infarction.
He had no signs or symptoms of chest pain, and an echocardiogram that was ordered to evaluate the possibility for endocarditis was also negative for any wall motion abnormalities or other signs of ischemia.
The echocardiogram was also negative for vegetations, and it was thought very unlikely that Mr. [**Known lastname **] had any endocarditis because of a lack of clinical findings and echocardiogram findings.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient will likely be transfused to the Surgery Service (after his surveillance blood cultures grow back negative) for a likely gastrojejunostomy surgery to relieve his partial small-bowel obstruction.
