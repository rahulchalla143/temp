She had previously been admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath in [**2189**], at which time a chest x-ray was done and said to be normal, and the patient was discharged home on an Albuterol inhaler.
She had remained asymptomatic until the aforementioned visit to the Emergency Department, at which time a repeat chest x-ray showed the presence of a large right hilar mass which was associated with volume loss in the right hemithorax, and suggestive of a neoplasm of the lung.
A biopsy was performed of her hilar mass which was consistent with a nonsmall cell lung carcinoma.
She also underwent a bone scan in a workup for metastases but this did not reveal any such disease.
She underwent further imaging with CAT scan of the hilar mass and it was staged as a T3, NO, MO lesion, and was believed to be amenable to primary resection.
Status post benign breast biopsy in [**2188**], and a lumpectomy in [**2177**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination, she was found to be afebrile with a heart rate of 90 and sinus rhythm and a blood pressure of 110/70.
Her height was five feet and her weight was 110 pounds.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with good air entry and movement, however, she did have bilateral expiratory wheezing which was quite significant.
Examination of her breasts revealed no masses on palpation with no nipple discharge or tenderness.
Her extremities were warm and dry with palpable pedal pulses and no lower extremities edema.
LABORATORY DATA:  Her complete blood count done just prior to admission showed a white blood cell count of 7.0 with a hematocrit of 40.4 and platelet count of 469,000.
Her chemistries done just prior to admission were significant for a sodium of 138, potassium 2.8.
Preadmission radiologic studies of significance was a chest x-ray performed on [**2191-11-1**], which showed a new right hilar mass.
This was further confirmed by CAT scan which showed a large [**Location (un) 21851**] in the right hilum resulting in obstruction of the right upper lobe bronchus and severe compression of the intermediate bronchus.
The patient further underwent a bone scan which showed no evidence of bony metastases and a CAT scan of the head which showed no abnormalities.
Ventilation perfusion scan was also performed which showed right lung perfusion to be 25% of the total.
The right lung as well as hilar lymph nodes were sent to pathology for further examination.
Her oxygen saturation at the time remained greater than 90%.
She was maintaining her heart rate in the 60s to 70s with her Neo-Synephrine drip being titrated to maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than 100.
She began to experience some greater incisional discomfort, at which time her epidural rate was increased to 5 cc/hour.
She was encouraged to perform aggressive pulmonary toilet and incentive spirometry with which her oxygen saturations and level of pain improved.
During the mid afternoon on postoperative day number two, the patient went from a sinus rhythm into rapid atrial fibrillation with a heart rate into the 140s and a systolic blood pressure between 80 and 90.
She then went into a sustained rapid atrial fibrillation, and an Amiodarone intravenous bolus of 150 mg was given over ten minutes and then infusion of Amiodarone at 1 mg/minute was started.
Her systolic blood pressure slowly improved and came into the 120 to 130 range.
She continued to improve remaining in sinus rhythm, and due to her improving blood pressure was restarted on her Diltiazem which she had been on prior to admission.
On postoperative day number four, following chest x-ray which showed evidence of only a very slight pneumothorax, her second chest tube was removed.
At that time, her physical examination was significant for a temperature of 99.2, heart rate 100 and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 118/70, respiratory rate 18 with an oxygen saturation 99% on two liters of nasal cannula.
Her most complete blood count from [**2191-12-24**], showed a white blood cell count of 8.8, hematocrit 33.8 and a platelet count of 469,000.
Her electrolytes on [**2191-12-24**], showed a sodium of 136, potassium 4.5, chloride 95, bicarbonate 31, blood urea nitrogen 11, creatinine 0.5, with a blood glucose of 135.
Magnesium at the time was 1.9.
