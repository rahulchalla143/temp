ECG [**2111-2-1**]:  Sinus rhythm with slowing of the rate as compared with prior tracing  of [**2111-1-31**].
CXR [**2111-2-1**]: Progressive distention of mediastinal veins suggest volume overload also responsible for increased cardiac diameter and pulmonary vascular engorgement, though there is no clear pulmonary edema.
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**2111-2-1**]:  CT CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are numerous, but do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Review of previous CT of [**11-9**], [**2107**], shows that these nodes have increased uniformly in size and number.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The bladder, distal ureters, prostate and seminal vesicles, rectum and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable.
Bilateral subcentimeter pulmonary nodules could relate to an infectious or inflammatory process, but are much improved from prior CT of [**2107**].

Fevers, diarrhea, night sweats:  Pt has been on [**Last Name (un) 2775**] with most recent CD4 count in [**2110-12-9**] of 48 and VL 1,560.

He was given 2L IVF after which his pressures dropped to 80s-90s systolic.
Lactate was 1.8 and Cr at baseline.
He received an additional 3.5L IVF with SBP rise to 120s, HR 80s.
CXR was negative.
CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed progression of adenopathy in the epicardium, upper abdominal retroperitoneum and epigastrium.
Stool cultures, afb smears, PCP smears, ova and parasite evaluations were all performed.

His urine output was maintained.
Renal U/S [**6-15**] ruled out obstructive uropathy.
While in the hospital, patient was maintained on his outpatient [**Month/Day (2) 2775**] therapy and Bactrim prophylaxis for PCP.
It was decided that this should be held until blood cultures return negative.
It should be started as an outpatient by his primary care physician when all cultures are negative.
Hyponatremia:  Sodium 129.
Expect Una>20 and FEna>1% with renal etiology.
Una 89, Fena calculated at 2.85%, both consistent with renal loss.
Anemia:  Patient's Hct ranged from 28-31.
MCV was normal, and iron studies revealed low iron (18), high TIBC (138), high ferritin (1492).
Haptoglobin <20 and retic count 1.0.
You had a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
