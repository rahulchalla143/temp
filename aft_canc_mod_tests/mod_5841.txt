Imaging: CXR on admission [**6-25**]: FINDINGS: Lung volumes are decreased since the prior exam.
CXR prior to intubation [**6-26**]: Comparison film [**6-25**].
CXR [**6-28**]: HISTORY: ARDS versus severe pneumonia.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-27**], there has been a dramatic decrease in bilateral pulmonary opacifications.
CXR [**6-29**]: The lungs are low in volume and show bilateral multifocal airspace opacities.
CXR [**6-30**]: FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position.
Bilateral lung volumes are low.
The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and stable.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**6-30**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.

He initially improved on mechanical ventilation, but developed worsening hypoxemia on [**6-27**], with a chest x-ray that was concerning for ARDS vs. diffuse alveolar hemorrhage vs. flash pulmonary edema.
A chest x-ray the following day showed very significant improvement of the lung process, which made ARDS less likely.
Following extubation, he continued to have good oxygen saturation on supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula.
# Anemia: From an admission Hct of 31, the patient's Hct dropped slowly.
Hemolysis labs were unremarkable.
Cystoscopy was performed with finding prostatic urethral tear and a bladder neck contracture.
His post-void residuals were followed to ensure he did not develop obstruction; his post-void residuals were zero.
