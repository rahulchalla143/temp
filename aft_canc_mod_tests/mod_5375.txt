MRI AND MRA BRAIN  INDICATION: 67-year-old man with fall and subdural hematoma.
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1-weighted images were obtained following administration of [**Hospital 3173**] gadolinium.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular blood products are not definitely appreciated on this study due to limited examination.
Diffusion-weighted imaging was not performed.
Area of enhancement in the right anterior temporal lobe, corresponding to an area of contusion seen on previous examination with surrounding edema.
Subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage not evaluated on this study, as gradient echo imaging was not performed.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2142-8-7**] 11:08 AM  CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT [**Month/Day/Year **] CONTRAST: The scan is of limited diagnostic quality due to artifact from breathing during the examination.
CT ABDOMEN POST-ADMINISTRATION OF [**Month/Day/Year **] CONTRAST:  There is free fluid present in the upper abdomen, particularly around the liver and spleen.
The abdominal images are compromised due to artifact from breathing.
CT PELVIS POST-ADMINISTRATION OF [**Month/Day/Year **] CONTRAST: The images are again compromised due to artifact from breathing.
CONCLUSION:  The entire examination is suboptimal due to artifact from breathing throughout the examination.
A filling defect in the right femoral vein is consistent with a thrombus and may be further assessed with a Doppler ultrasound.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Head CT scans dated [**7-31**] and [**2142-8-1**] are available for correlation.
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1-weighted and axial T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, gradient echo, and diffusion-weighted images of the brain were obtained.
Due to its proximity to the mastoid air cells, this area is not well evaluated on gradient echo and diffusion-weighted images, and it is not clear whether blood products are present within this contusion.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2142-7-31**] at 0813 hours.
TECHNIQUE: Serial transverse images were acquired sequentially through the brain and reconstructed at stacked 5 mm transverse sections.
No CT evidence of acute cortical stroke is noted.
Consider detailed maxillofacial CT scan for further evaluation.
GCS of 3T in ED, with a SBP originally in the 80s.
B/L PNA, R>L 6. left frontal bone fracture He was admitted to the TSICU.
Neurosurgery, plastics, neurology, spine, orthopedics, and ENT were all consult.
ABG = 7.45/40/102.
CXR was concerning for pneumothoraax, and pt was tnrasfered to MICU for AC ventilation via trach and closer monitoring.
repeat CXR showed reexpansion of LLL, and acute event felt [**12-29**] mucus plug.
Pt was otherwise gradually weaned from AC ventilation to PS then to 35% trach mask with sats 90-100%.
Neurologic: small head bleeds were stable on repeat CT and deemed non-operative by neurosurgery.
Slowly, the patient's neurologic exam improved; he began following commands, moving all extremities, and communicating.
His cervical c-spine CT was highly abnormal, but it was unclear what, if any of these findings were related to his trauma.
An MRI of the C spine was performed and his neck was cleared by the ortho spine staff on [**2142-8-4**].
He is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] (neurosurgery) with a repeat head CT 6 weeks after fall.
He received an MRI of the brain w/ & w/o to r/o brain mets, no obvious mets were seen but could not be ruled out in the setting of brain contusion.
His trach was changed in the TSICU to a cuffed trach; he was bronched upon admission to the TSICU given the PNA on CT scan.
A CVL was placed and his CVP monitored.
Left internal carotid found to be incidentally blocked on MRI/MRA, but this appears stable from prior studies, other vessels noted to have good flow.
Blood and urine cultures are negative.
Follow up CT of head scan in 4 weeks Follow up with orthopedics in 4 weeks for leg fractures Continue Zosyn IV antibiotics until [**8-11**] for completion of Pseudomonas Pneumonia treatment .

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a fall, you were found to have a Subarachnoid hemorrage, and temporal brain contusion on imaging of your head.
You were started on medications to keep your blood pressure elevated during the beginning of your hospital stay.
You are touch down weight bearing on the the left leg and weight bearing on the right lower extremity.
You were also found to have blood clots in your lungs and in your leg, because you had a bleed in your head you can not be on blood thinners.
Please follow up with neurology for a repeat CT of the head in 4 weeks to make sure that your intracranial bleed has not progresed.
Please repeat a head CT in 4 weeks to assess for interval change/improvement of your known head bleeds and contusions.
