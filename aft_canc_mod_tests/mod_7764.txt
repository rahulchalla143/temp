Left parietal metastatic lesion resection [**12-31**]   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 79388**] is a 58 year-old right handed man who preseneted to the ED from his PCP's office this afternoon after going in for an evaluation of right hand incoordination.
Following the event which self-resolved he was confused and on presentation to the ED was noted to be aphasic (difficulty with using the correct words)so a code stroke was called for which NIHSS was 5.
An initial CT showed a large 2.5 cm mass in the left parietal lobe with surrounding edema.
Family History: Mother - breast cancer Father - lung cancer son - healthy   Physical Exam: Vitals: afebrile, P 72 BP 142/68 R 18 SpO2 97% ra General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
He had multiple paraphasic errors while speaking "pactus - cactus, hand - glove, dursday - thursday"; has difficulty following commands including "stick out your tongue".
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.

CT chest/abdomen [**12-28**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CTA head [**12-30**]: 1.
CT head [**12-31**]: IMPRESSION: Expected postoperative changes.
MRI Brain [**1-1**]: CONCLUSION: Status post resection of the left parietal mass seen previously.
Blood products limit evaluation for residual enhancement, but the lesion appears to have been completely resected.
MRA Brain-Neck [**1-2**]: Occlusion of the proximal left vertebral artery extending distally through all its segments.
Echo [**1-3**]: Suboptimal image quality.
Given the large lesion in the left parietal lobe identified on NCHCT done in the ED, he was started on dexamethasone 4mg q6h and Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] at admit.
Prior to resection, his exam showed significant improvement on right hand incoordination.
Resection was performed [**12-31**] with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Post op head CT revealed no hemorrhage but an incidental left cerebellar infarct.
An MRI was performed to eval postop and revealed acute left cerebellar infarct but good tumor resection.
Neurology recommended MRA head and Neck as well as a bubble study and labs.
MRA revealed an occluded left vertebral artery.
Bubble study revealed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
