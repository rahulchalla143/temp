[**2121-6-20**] - Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing.
At the time, only groaning to deep noxious stimuli, BP 70s, transported via ambulance to OSH, where he was intubated upon arrival for decreased level of consciousness and vomiting/aspiration.
CT head at OSH showed known tumor, otherwise no bleed.
Abd pelvis CT showed RLL infiltrate.
Urine tea colored.

ECG Study Date of [**2121-6-3**]  2:24:46 Sinus rhythm.
ECHO Study Date of [**2121-6-3**]: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with global hypokinesis and akinesis of the infero-lateral, inferior and infero-septal segments.
EEG Study Date of [**2121-6-4**] Abnormal portable EEG due to the focal slowing with some sharp features in the right frontal region and due to the slow background and bursts of generalized slowing.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2121-6-18**] 4:27 PM No new acute intracranial hemorrhage.
The etiology of shock was felt likely secondary to seizure (given history of recent radiation therapy for meningioma at [**Hospital1 112**]), resulting in prolonged hypotension, which subsequently resulted in ARF (creatinine=1.6->5.2 ), STEMI (troponin peak=7.97), rhabdomyolysis (ck=96,400), and hypoxia (ABG=7.29/34/60) requiring ventilatory support.
Initial fluid support included bicarb in order to alkalinize the urine, however pt's urine output was minimal (<10cc/hr), resulting in progressive volume overload.
TTE showed poor LVEF=20% with global hypokenesis, akinesis of the infero-lateral/septal walls.
EKG showed ST elevation in II, II, V1, and V2.
Given persistent hypotension, pt was also evaluated for adrenal insufficiency which revealed cortisol 18.6->20.0 after [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test.
Creatinine was continuing to rise, and UOP did not improve with lasix 200mg IV + 250mg diamox.
1) Resp failure   Respiratory failure improved on abx (see below) and after trial of PS, pt extubated [**2121-6-15**] on rounds and tolerated on 1 L face mask and then 4L NC.
Pt treated with 10-day course and and then f/u CXR showed only mod bilat pleural effusions.
Started [**2121-6-14**] on Vanc and Zosyn for VAP after [**6-13**] sputum grm stain showed 4+ GN diplococci and due to inc secretions.
3) LUE paralysis   Non-contrast head CT ([**6-9**]) was negative for new process.
Felt that the patient may likely need cardiac catheterization following acute events here.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
3.Acute Renal Failure now dependent on hemodialysis - likely secondary to Rhabdomyolysis.
