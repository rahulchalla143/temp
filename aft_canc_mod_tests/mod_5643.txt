These were significant for a FVC of 106% predicted, FEV1 of 108% predicted, and FEV1/FVC of 102% predicted.

An LP at that time showed [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus in her CSF.
There was concern for intracranial pathology; however, head CT was negative.

She was transitioned to lopressor for both rate control and blood pressure control.
Pulmonary Embolism: Pulmonary embolism: An Echocardigram showed RV dilation.
A CTA at that time showed a pulmonary embolism that was thought to be from her catheter [**Male First Name (un) **] thrombus from her right IJ catheter.
