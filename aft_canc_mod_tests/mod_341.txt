Her initial arterial blood gas was a pH of 7.24, pCO2 126, and her white count was 8.3 with 3% bands; however, she was afebrile with stable vitals signs and was initially with an oxygen saturation of 96% on 4 L supplemental oxygen.
The secretions were purulent with 4+ PNS and were positive on culture with MRSA and Enterobacter which was sensitive to Meropenem and Gentamicin.
On the Cardiovascular Service, she became somnolescent on [**2-23**], and a repeat arterial blood gas revealed a pCO2 of 133.
For ventilatory support, she was transferred to the MICU, where her arterial blood gas improved to a pH of 7.49 and pCO2 of 71.
Ejection fraction of 35-40% on her last cardiac echocardiogram on [**2138-10-21**], with severe anterior, septal, and apical hypokinesis.
A video fluoroscopic swallowing study in [**2139-6-7**] revealed difficulty with thin liquids and aspiration risk.
Vital signs:  Temperature 98.1?????
?, heart rate 95, blood pressure 90/40, respirations 16, oxygen saturation 100% on AC volume support with tidal volume 300, PEEP 5, FIO2 30%.
There were 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer, WBC 15.3, hematocrit 30.0, platelet count 335; sodium 142, potassium 4.3, chloride 93, total CO2 43, BUN 17, creatinine 0.6, glucose 130; magnesium 2.0, phosphate 2.3; arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.29, pCO2 92, O2 76 on 4 L nasal cannula; [**2-23**] TSH 4.3, [**3-1**] Vancomycin level 35.5.
Chest CT on [**2-23**]:  Small bilateral pleural effusion and pleural thickening.
Electrocardiogram on [**2-24**]:  Sinus tachycardia at 110 with normal intervals and diffuse ST abnormalities without Q-waves.
Cardiovascular:  Her systolic blood pressure was declining from about 100 to the 70s during her hospitalization; however, she responded to increased fluid intake once her mental status improved and she began to take p.o.
Her systolic blood pressure rose to an average of 100 at discharge.
An electrocardiogram was performed in the MICU which was essentially unchanged from her [**2-24**] study.
b.i.d., but it was frequently held when her blood pressure was below 90.
A venous blood gas showed a pH of 7.52, and pCO2 of 60.
On 50% oxygen, her oxygen saturation was always 97-100%.
Blood and urine cultures were sent which are negative to date.
Her Vancomycin trough was 15.4, so her dosage of Vancomycin was decreased to 1 g q.24 hours.
She is currently on day #10 of her Vancomycin and Meropenem for a recommended total course of 21 days.
Renal:  Her renal function is consistently excellent with a baseline creatinine of 0.5.
She had a negative urinalysis here.
Because of her relative hypotension and high eosinophil count (750), which has been recurrent over the past year, a morning Cortisol was drawn and found to be 14.
She received a corticotropin stimulation test which was negative, but while pending she received two doses of 100 mg IV Hydrocortisone, which is now discontinued.
q.d., Sertraline 150 mg, Zolpidem 5 mg p.o.
