Together with the interval development of bilateral pleural effusions, this indicates cardiac insufficiency (or alternatively volume overload) and an echocardiogram may be indicated for further evaluation.
He continued to have an oxygen requirement and CT scan suggested ground glass opacities, suggestive of an underlying infectious process.
ECHO was done and confirmed normal ejection fraction.
He underwent a staging CT scan torso which suggested no significant increase in tumor burden.
He will need follow-up bloodwork as an outpatient.
Recent CT scan showed destruction of L femoral neck.
He underwent an xray of the L femur which did not suggest an acute fracture.
3) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine improved from 2.1 to 1.3 at time of discharge.
