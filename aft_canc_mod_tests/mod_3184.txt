The patient described it as a sharp pressure that did not radiate but was associated with dyspnea and diaphoresis.
Respiratory examination revealed the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 8.4, her hematocrit was 35.3, and her platelets were 325.
Sodium was 139, potassium was 4.3, chloride was 105, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 12, creatinine was 0.6, and her blood glucose was 108.
An echocardiogram showed no wall motion abnormalities and an ejection fraction of 60 percent.
Telemetry revealed a sinus rhythm with a rate of 50 to 60.
Exercise tolerance test done in [**2138-6-20**] with four minutes on a modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol and stopped secondary to dizziness with a heart rate of 105.
The patient was referred for a cardiac catheterization on [**5-7**].
On [**2139-5-7**] the patient went for a cardiac catheterization which showed an ejection fraction of 60 percent with no mitral regurgitation.
Following cardiac catheterization the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit where she was followed by the Cardiology Service until she was brought to the operating room on [**5-8**].
At that time, the patient was A-paced at 80 beats per minute with a mean arterial pressure of 90 and a central venous pressure of 16.
On postoperative day two, the patient remained on a nitroglycerin infusion to maintain a systolic blood pressure in the middle 120s.
The patient was noted to have some thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of only 48,000.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody screen was sent, and the patient's medications were tailored to eliminate any that could cause thrombocytopenia.
On postoperative day four, it was noted that her hematocrit had drifted down from 24 to 20, and she was  transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells.
Also, on postoperative day four, it was decided that the patient would be stable and ready to be transferred to rehabilitation on the following morning; presuming that her hematocrit would remain stable overnight.
At that time, the patient's physical examination was as follows.
Temperature was 98.3 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 88 (sinus rhythm), her blood pressure was 110/58, her respiratory rate was 22, and her oxygen saturation was 96 percent on room air.
Her weight preoperatively was 72 kilograms.
At discharge, her weight was 62.7 kilograms.
Physical examination revealed she was alert and responsive.
Respiratory examination revealed the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
The incision with staples - open to air - clean and dry.
The left lower extremity incision with Steri-Strips - open to air - clean and dry.
Sodium was 134, potassium was 4.2, chloride was 98, bicarbonate was 26, blood urea nitrogen was 24, creatinine was 0.8, and her blood glucose was 100.
