A CXR on admission demonstrated pneumonia and a chest CT confirmed the presence of an infiltrate and also demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Patient's hypoxia was thought to be secondary to pneumonia, pleural effusions, and diastolic heart failure, and her hypercapnia was thought to be secondary to muscular weakness and possibly obstructive sleep apnea (does not carry this diagnosis).
She was continued on levofloxacin (day 1=[**3-14**]) and vancomycin (day 1=[**3-15**]).
Her weight at time of discharge was 126.5lbs.
Her SBP improved to the 100s after IVF administration in the ED and arrival to the ICU.
Her blood pressure remained stable during this hospitalization.
# Altered mental status:  There was some concern initially that patient's mental status was altered and a head CT was negative for an acute process.
