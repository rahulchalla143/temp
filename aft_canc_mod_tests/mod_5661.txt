His vital signs in their ED were 103.2 BP 209/94 HR 99 100% CPAP.
At [**Hospital3 **], he was felt to be in pulmonary edema and he received lasix 40 mg IV and was started on a nitro gtt for BPs 200s/130s, and was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin and then given levofloxacin and vancomycin in our ED.
Patient had a CXR at the time which showed with RML collapse, which was attributed to pneumonia.
During that admission, he had an episode of AF with RVR, with an echo showing atrial dilatation.

IMAGING  CT head [**3-19**] IMPRESSION: No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage or bleed.
The extra- axial collections mentioned on the prior CT are either prominent CSF spaces secondary to atrophy, or less likely hygromas.
CXR [**3-4**] The right lung opacity has slightly worsened in the interim as well as there is interval development of new left predominantly perihilar but also lower lobe opacity, findings consistent with superimposed pulmonary edema in addition to known multifocal parenchymal consolidations.
Non-Contrast Head CT [**2129-3-15**]: 1.
Acute sinusitis cannot be excluded and clinical correlation is recommended, especially in a patient who has been recently extubated.
Echocardiography [**2129-3-7**]: The left atrium is dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-2-24**], the findings are similar.
Abdominal X-ray [**2129-3-6**]: Dilated loops of small bowel.
The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are unremarkable aside from mildly enlarged bifrontal CSF spaces secondary to mild brain atrophy.
The extra- axial collections mentioned on the prior CT are either prominent CSF spaces secondary to atrophy, or less likely hygromas.
DIRECT INFLUENZA A ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2129-3-12**]):       Negative for Influenza A viral antigen.
DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2129-3-12**]):       NEGATIVE FOR INFLUENZA B VIRAL ANTIGEN.
Repeat antigen screen was negative so oseltamivir was discontinued.
Acute on chronic [**Month/Day/Year **] failure, dialysis dependent Chronic [**Month/Day/Year **] failure secondary to multiple myeloma with baseline creatinine of 3.
Patient to be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**] as an outpatient and hemodialysis as an outpatient arranged at Northeast [**Hospital1 8**] Dialysis [**Location (un) 96522**].

Of note, he had a history of gastritis and colon adenoma on EGD performed [**2124**] for workup for Fe deficiency anemia.
A decision was made to hold off on diagnostic studies given high risks involved (likely reintubation needed) and low likelihood of intervention.
Hematocrit was stable at the time of discharge.
Hypertension Initially hypotensive in septic shock, developed hypertension during extubation to systolic pressures of 200's.
Adequately controlled on diltiazem and metoprolol with systolic pressures of 130's.
Patient to return to [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] 7 clinic on Monday, [**3-28**] for labs and to discuss further treatment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**].
He did have some crusted lesions on his lips which initially raised the question of HSV infection, so a lumbar puncture was performed which was negative for bacterial infection.
CT head done prior to lumbar puncture showed no new bleed or stroke, although there was a question of bifrontal fluid collections possibly consistent with hygromas versus age-related atrophy.
His confusion increased on [**3-19**] so repeat CT head was done, upon review bifrontal collections noted on initial CT were read as being more likely due to atrophy than hygroma.
Troponins elevated in setting [**Month/Year (2) **] failure.
Ileus Abdominal imaging perfored due to distended belly, films most consistent with ileus, resolved post extubation.
