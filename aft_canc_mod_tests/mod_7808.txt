Pt had exercise MIBI (walked 8.5 minutes with resultant drop in BP from 112/60 to 88/60).
Then admitted electively to CMI for cath, which showed R heart: RA 14, RV 61/8, PA 60/23, PCPW 33 L heart: LMCA norm; LAD 100% prox; LCX 80% mid, 70% prox OM2, 50% distal OM2, distal vessel fills via left to left collaterals; RCA not visualized; [**Date Range **]-D1-OM1 patent, [**Date Range **]-LAD patent.
Sheath pulled and BP decreased to 88/40 with HR 40's.
Pt received atropine 0.6mg IV x1 and 200 cc NS bolus with BP in 100's/50's and HR 70's.
Hct dropped 10 points and pt was tx'd to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] from CMI.
NGT x3 was attempted unsuccesfully.
Outpt work up has included an MRA abdomen to rule out bowel ischemia [**9-15**].
It was a poor study and results were equivocal.
Of note, EGD [**12/2178**] showed schlatki's ring at GE junction.
CVA, s/p B CEA 8. h/o Deep Venous Thrombosis 9.

EKG [**2183-11-3**]: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2183-8-8**] atrial ectopy is no longer present.
Selective coronary angiography was performed on the LMCA and [**Date Range **].
Hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left and right heart filling pressures.
The cardiac output/index was moderately depressed.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
EKG post Cath: No significant change compared to pre-cath.
A very limited MRI was performed [**2183-10-27**].
The patient's gallbladder again is noted to be abnormal, although it is not as distended as on previous examination and the degree of edema has lessened when compared to examination from [**2183-11-10**].
Pathology [**2183-11-28**] Diagnosis Stomach ulcer, biopsy: 1.
The OM2 and LCx were both found to have critical lesions and were stented with good flow post stent.
CHF - The patient has an EF of 15%.
Rhythm - The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation but was observed to be in sinus with LBBB on EKG throughout his hospital course.
His HCT did not show appropriate response and the patient was transferred to the CCU with presumed upper GI bleed.
Vitals remained stable and the patient appeared clinically stable.
He was started on a PPI IV drip and HCT was monitored q4.
The scope showed an esophogeal ulcer with associated friable mucosa with exudate and surrounding erythema.
Stomach cardia showed mass vs blood clot.At that time, GI decided that given the patient's clinical status and friability of the lesions, they would biopsy the lesion once the patient was clinically stable.
He received another unit PRBC and his HCT bumped to over 30 and remained stable.
His hematocrit hovered in the low 30s.
Epi and cauterization were used, however a biopsy was not taken at this time.
The patient had a repeat EGD once he was clinically stable.
Per GI Reccs: the patient was kept on a PPI, Coumadin was held, his diet was advanced and his HCT was kept above 30. .
Coagulopathy/Shock Liver- In preparation for the repeat endoscopy by GI, the patient's coags were monitored.
Despite not being on Coumadin or heparin and receiving Vitamin K multiple times, patient's INR remained elevated.
Acetaminophen was held and a level was checked and was negative.
His shock liver was attributed to hepatic congestion secondary to congestive heart failure.
A HIDA scan was done which showed delay kinetics suggestive of cholecystitis.
Adenocarcinoma- Biopsy of the stomach ulcer was consistent with adenocarcinoma.
