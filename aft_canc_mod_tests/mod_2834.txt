He was seen at an OSH where CTA was negative for PE.
He had an ultrasound performed today which showed bilateral DVTs from common femoral vein down.
Repeat CTA [**5-17**] here confirmed no PE at that time.
In the evening of [**5-17**] he was noted to have worsening trouble speaking and was sent to urget MRI at 9:20.
MRI revealed 3x4 cm new bleed in the left parietal region around a previous metastasis.
Neuro-Oncology evaluation at that time revealed significant right sided weakness.
At approximately 2am, he had an acute rise in his heart rate from NSR in 80s to 150s, acute onset of tachypnea and hypoxia with O2 sat 70% on RA, rigors, and worsening mental status (not following commands).
His SBP remained stable at the time.
In [**8-/2164**], left inguinal node involvement as well as bilateral periaortic involvement were discovered on CT scan.
He then developed a soft tissue nodule on the medial edge of his pectoralis muscle that was FDG-avid on PET scan in 3/[**2169**].
His PET scan from [**4-/2169**] also showed increased pelvic and abdominal lymphadenopathy.
He went for a regularly scheduled CT torso as part of the study and was found to have PE in the RML and RLL.
He then [**Date Range 1834**] a head CT prior to anticoagulation which revealed a metastasis in the right frontal region.
MRI on [**2170-1-15**] showed an increase in size of the right frontal metastasis which had been treated with CK and a new 8mm metastasis in the parasagittal left frontal lobe.
PET thallium scan showed low level uptake in the right frontal lobe lesion but no uptake in the left parietal lesion.
MRI showed identical size of the lesion but increased vasogenic edema.
He then had FDG-PET and thallium scans of his brain on [**2170-4-26**] and [**2170-4-23**] respectively which showed low and no uptake of the radionuclide, which per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**], suggested radiation necrosis.

[**2170-5-18**] CT head: IMPRESSION: 1.
That evening he exhibited neurologic changes and had an urgent MRI which showed ICH around a previous metastasis.
His O2 Sat is currently normal on room air.
All BP meds, steroids, and antiseizure meds were discontinued.
Acute renal failure: We are no longer following labs given pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].
