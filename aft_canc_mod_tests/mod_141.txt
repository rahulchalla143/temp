Cath showed occluded SVG, Native 3vd, occluded proximal LAD.
Distal LAD is diminutive past 1st septal and diag branches.
She has been hemodynamically stable with HR 60-70s and SBP 120-130s.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 8 cm.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: EKG:  new LBBB with STE in V1 -V3 & V5 that in some leads are >5mm.
Her TIMI risk score was 7 indicating a 41% risk at 14 days of mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization.
Her SVG found to be completely occluded and a BMS was placed in the proximal LAD.
Cardiac enzymes trended down appropriately with peak Ck and CKMB at 107 and 18.2.
ECHO showed moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior and anterospetal akinesis and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
# Hypoxia:  Upon hospitalization, patient was maintaing saturations in low 90s on 6L from baseline 92% on RA.
CXR showed RLL pneumonia, and patient was subsequantly started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, metronidazole.
As the patient had history recurrent RLL pneumonia, a CT scan was obtained which showed severe right lower lobe consolidation and extensive, new diffuse lung nodules with  sputum cytology positive for adenocarcinoma.
Repeat CT scan showed little interval improvement in right lower lobe infiltrate.
She was breathing comfortably with oxygen saturation in the low 90s.
# Lung nodules/ Broncheoalveolar carcinoma: CT scan with diffuse pulmonary nodules and sputum cytology positive for adenocarcinoma.
Although patient did not have imaging of her head, staging based on CT torso was IIIa with pulmonary nodules in both lung fields without obvious distal LAD or metastasis.
# Chronic renal insufficiency - Patient with GFR 48.
Creatinine remained stable at 1-1.1.
# Hyperkalemia:  The patient was mildly hyperkalemic the day prior to discharge to 5.6 without EKG changes.
Medications on Admission: # Clopidogrel [Plavix] 75 mg Tablet PO Daily # Ezetimibe-Simvastatin [Vytorin [**11-5**]] 10 mg-20 mg PO daily  # Nifedipine 30 mg SR PO qday # Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg/hour Patch 24 hr 1 patch once a day # Nitroglycern sublingual tabs PRN - has not used recently prior to today # Propranolol 80 mg Tablet PO once a day # Multivitamin  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: ST elevation myocardial infarction Presumed broncheoalveolar carcinoma   Discharge Condition: stable, with 5L oxygen requirement and O2 Sat in the low 90s   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for chest pressure and found to have a heart attack.
You had a cardiac catheterization and had a bare metal stent placed.
After this, you had some trouble breathing and had a scan that showed some nodules in your lungs.
A sputum sample was sent and malignant cells were seen.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
