In the ED, labs were concerning for new abnormal LFTs with a predominantly cholestatic picture and CXR showed BL pleural effusion R>L, and large R lung infiltrate (with near white out) concerning for pneumonia.
CT abdomen showed GB wall thickening, gallstones, ?
liver lesions, but no e/o pancreatitis.
CT chest showed BL pleural effusions, R lung infiltrate.
Past Medical History: # Back pain with multilevel osseous metastatic disease in the thoracic and lumbar spine # HTN # Hypercholesterolemia # Left hip fracture [**2144**], s/p hemiarthroplasty.

JVP +10, no LAD, MMM, OP without erythema or exudate LUNGS: Dull to percussion in the lower 1/3rd.

Bilateral common femoral vein thrombosis  [**2155-3-10**] CXR AP chest compared to [**3-7**] through [**2158-3-10**]:19 a.m.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema in the left lung has increased, moderate left pleural effusion stable, right lung airless due in large part to large right pleural effusion.
# Shortness of breath: Patient was tachypneic to 40, ABG showed large A-a gradient.
Her Chest xray showed white out of the entire right lung as well as portions of the left lung.
Elevated GGT confirmed a likely biliary source, and fractionation of bilirubin demonstrated an elevated conjugated fraction, likely from the biliary pathology, as well as an elevated unconjugated fraction, which may have had contributions from both the liver issues and her recent transfusion.
Haptoglobin and reticulocyte count did not indicate evidence of hemolysis.
The pain did not recur, and her alk phos and t bili trended down.
Her ACEl was held in the setting of contrast load with CT and increase in creatinine .
