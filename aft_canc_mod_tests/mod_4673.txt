ABG immediately after was 7.24/36/391/16 w/lactate 7.2.
He was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where TEE showed global LV hypokinesis and a normal RV, while the rhythm strip showed large ST elevations anteriorly.
Troponins were greater than recordable.
His heparin ggt was turned off and he returned to the OR to complete proctocoletomy with open perineum and diverting ileostomy.
Also has received 2 units PRCs on [**2146-12-7**] for HCT of 29, and 1 dose of vanc/zosyn for post-op ppx.
Today he was noted to be dropping his pressures, so returned to cath lab to have balloon pump placed and angiogram which confirmed patency of vessels.

CARDIAC CATH [**12-6**]: COMMENTS: 1.
ECHO [**12-6**]: LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with near global LV severe hypokinesis/akinesis; the basal septum and basal lateral wall have relatively preserved function (overall LVEF= ~15-20 %).
EKG [**12-6**]: Probable sinus rhythm at upper limits of normal rate.
ECHO [**12-8**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %).
Aware of the poor prognosis and believing that the current maximal supportive care including pressors, mechanical intubation, and IABP would not meet the patient's wishes, family decided to withdraw support and pt was taken of pressors, balloon pump, and was extubated.
Echo showing EF 15-20% with severely depressed LV function.
ECG showing q waves and low voltages indicating extensive non-recoverable myocardial injury.
# Shock:  Pt with echo showing severely depressed LV systolic function with EF 15-20% in setting of STEMI.
