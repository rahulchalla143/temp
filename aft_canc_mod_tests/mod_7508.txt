The patient reports that she has had intermittent bleeding oozing from her nose over the past several days as well as gum bleeding when she is brushing her teeth for the same period of time notes increased frequency of stools of loose consistency described as chocolate syrup mixed with blood clots.
Had routine PT/INR done today by the VNA, which showed an elevated INR and directed to the Emergency Department by her primary care physician.
Reports having routine colonoscopy done several years ago in [**State 4565**], which showed polyps.
In the Emergency Department her vital signs were stable.
Hematocrit 22, INR 17, 4 and 4.
Also had increased PTT as well as BUN and creatinine 213/3.2.
Echocardiogram [**10/2129**] showed an EF of 45 to 50% with inferior posterior hypokinesis, hyperlipidemia, degenerative joint disease, peripheral vascular disease, status post left lower extremity bypass, chronic edema with stasis dermatitis.
The heart rate is 74.
Blood pressure 113/31.
Respirations 13.
JVP 7 to 8 cm.
Lungs clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Internal examination showed red blood on glove with scant brown stool.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 8, hematocrit 22.5 this is mid 30s and 95, platelets 184, PT 51.3, INR 17.4, PTT 75.2.
Sodium 138, K 4.8, chloride 99, bicarb 25, BUN 213, creatinine 3.2, which is 1.4 to 1.9 in 95 and a glucose of 141.
Coagulopathy:  It was thought that the patient was having an increase in Coumadin dose over the past several weeks due to expired tubes done by her VNA and when her new tube was fine her INR was elevated at 17.4, she received several units of fresh frozen platelets and vitamin K and her coagulopathy was corrected.
By the time of her admission her INR had been corrected and the decision was made to hold her Coumadin since she would need a repeat colonoscopy.
Gastrointestinal bleeding:  The patient received 2 units initially of packed red blood cells with an appropriate hematocrit bump.
Colonoscopy was significant for numerous polyps throughout her colon and esophagogastroduodenoscopy was significant for gastric erosions.
It was felt that the polyps were responsible for her recent bleed and that she would need outpatient repeat colonoscopy several weeks after.
Of note, the patient had an abdominal CT scan looking for possible cancer and metastatic disease from her polyps, which was significant for two lytic lesions on her ileum.
Of note, one of the polyps removed from her colonoscopy had high grade dysplasia contained within the adenoma.
She had a serum protein electrophoresis, which showed no specific abnormalities.
Urine protein electrophoresis showed multiple protein bands with albumin predominated.
It was felt that the rest of her oncology workup could be done by her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Her Lasix and Coumadin were held while she was an inpatient and her Coumadin would be continued to be held since she would need a repeat colonoscopy in several weeks.
She had an echocardiogram that showed an EF of 30%, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation and severe pulmonary hypertension.
