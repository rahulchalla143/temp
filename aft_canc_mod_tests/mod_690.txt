HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma, status post bilateral nephrectomies, on hemodialysis with metastatic disease to the lung, eye, penis, also with coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction and a three vessel coronary artery bypass graft, status post AICD pacer for V-fib arrest and congestive heart failure with an EF of 30%, diabetes, hypertension, history of upper gastrointestinal bleed who was in his usual state of health until yesterday at hemodialysis when his blood pressures were noted to the in the 60's but resolved reportedly.
He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16858**] the morning of admission, was somnolent with blood pressures 50/palp with a weak pulse.
He got intravenous fluids and his blood pressure increased to 62/palp.
His O2 saturations were 91% on room air, therefore, he was placed on four liters.
Was transferred to the Emergency Room with blood pressures in the 60's, heart rate 93, began Vancomycin 1 gram times one and Ceftriaxone 1 gram intravenous times one, got two liters of normal saline and began a Dopamine drip.
Arterial blood gases was 7.48/41/141 with a lactate of 2.2 on 100% non-rebreather.
Congestive heart failure with an EF on [**2166-1-7**] of 30% with mild Aortic regurgitation and MR.  5.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.3, heart rate 109 to 123, blood pressure 66/36 which increased 80 to 95/39 to 44.
Respiratory rate 24 to 25, sating 89 to 94% which increased to 100% on non-rebreather.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
DATA:  White blood count 4.9, hematocrit 26.1, platelets 160 with 97 polys, 0 bands and 1 lymphocytes.
INR of 1.4, sodium 141, potassium 3.8, chloride 105, bicarbonate 26, BUN 22, creatinine 3.2.
Glucose 177, calcium 8.9, phos of 2.4, mag of 1.9, ALT 8, AST 12, TB 0.5, albumin 2.2, alk phos 130, uric acid of 4.1, LDH 146.
CK 8, Troponin 0.3.
Arterial blood gases 7.48, 41, 145, 2.2 lactate.
Electrocardiogram per report paced, atrial sensed and V-paced to a heart rate of 94.
Chest x-ray:  Increased consolidation of the left lower lobe atelectasis verses pneumonia, atelectasis of left upper lobe is new, moderate left pleural effusion with extension to the left apex, increase in evidence of congestive heart failure.
Head CT without contrast, no intracranial or acute process.
Abdominal and pelvic CT without contrast.
Vertebral lesions - lytic osseous lesions.
Status post nephrectomy, is on hemodialysis, congestive heart failure with an EF of 30% and coronary artery disease.
Hypovolemia, adrenal insufficiency and question of an myocardial infarction but the electrocardiogram was without changes and the first enzymes were flat.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the MICU and was hypotensive requiring pressors and placed on Dopamine and Levophed which increased blood pressures.
Had a Head CT and Abdominal CT without contrast showing no head bleed, a large left greater than right pleural effusion, metastases to the right lower lobe and an 8x5 cm large renal mass.
He was initially maxed out on two pressors but then was titrated only to one, Levophed with blood pressures in the 80's to 90's.
So it was decided to perhaps to have a bedside echo done to rule out tamponade as he did have upper extremity edema with lower extremity edema and this echo showed a right ventricular mass/tumor, 35% EF with wall motion abnormalities.
However, he had an allergy to CT contrast and was unable to have an magnetic resonance scan because of his pacer.
It was decided that we would pre-medicate him for this supposed allergy to intravenous contrast and go ahead with getting a head CT to rule out a bleed or metastatic disease as well as we were interested in looking at the test in order to rule out inferior vena cava syndrome.
On the morning of [**2166-1-30**] the patient underwent another more formal cardiogram which did not show a clot this time.
However, he did undergo the CT which was consistent with a SVC syndrome with collateral flow.
At first the plan was for him to be DNR/DNI however, when the results of the CT showed the rapid progression of metastatic disease and lymphadenopathy compressing the SVC and the right mainstem bronchus it was unable to be treated.
