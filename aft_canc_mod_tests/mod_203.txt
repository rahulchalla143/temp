Biopsy showed adenocarcinoma.
[**2163-5-31**]: CT abd/pelvis with distal esophageal mass and a 3cm partially necrotic lymph node in the hepatogastric ligament.
[**2163-6-8**]: PET with FDG avid left paratracheal lymph node immediately anterior to esophagus at level of aortic arch, 7 mm,  SUV max 4.5, multiple small (2-6 mm) pulmonary nodules too small  to fully characterize, and a large 2.9 cm lymph node in the gastrohepatic ligament with SUV max 11.4.
CT showed improving PE.
Brain MRI showed solitary 1.9 cm left frontal lobe mass.
CT torso with segmental LUL PE (new since [**2163-10-26**]), stable 9 mm right hilar lymph nodes and right upper lobe pulmonary nodules, no clear metastatic disease.
Resection of brain mass on [**2164-1-20**] ([**Doctor Last Name **]) showed metastatic adenocarcinoma, CK7/CK20 positive, TTF-1 negative, consistent with upper GI origin.
[**2164-3-27**]: CT chest with 7 mm RUL subpleural nodule (previously 5mm) and new 7 mm LUL nodule, and increased right hilar and mediastinal adenopathy (may be reactive).
[**2164-4-2**]: J-tube placement, dilation of stricture, biopsy of gastric conduit revealed adenocarcinoma.
[**2164-7-13**]: CT chest: Improvement of bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggests resolving infectious/inflammatory process.
[**2164-7-31**]: MRI head with new 25 x 21 mm left cerebellar metastasis.

There was significant air leak (4+) on the chest tube, thought to be due to the open esophagus.
His antibiotics, vasopressors, esmolol, and mechanical ventilation were discontinued.
