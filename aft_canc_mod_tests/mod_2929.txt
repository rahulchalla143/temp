The patient is status post autologous bone marrow transplant on [**2195-9-28**] for treatment of his disease (done at [**Hospital1 336**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**].
Pt reports a weight loss of ~ 8 lbs and he states that it has been a chore to do his daily activities.
At approximately 9:00 pm on [**7-14**] pt's wife noticed that his appearance looked different, swollen.
VS  - 97.3 P 93 RR 16 BP 112/73.
CXR did not show a mediastinal mass.
Family History: Grandfather skin cancer Mother skin cancer Father CAD   Physical Exam: VS  98.3  155/74  81  15  97 RA  GEN lying in bed comfortable NAD SKIN facial erythema HEENT  PEERL, EOMI, MMM, prominent forehead and neck veins, neck supple CV  RRR no m/r/g CHEST: L chest portacath site draining blood bandaged, CTA b/l ABD soft NT ND + BS - HSM EXT  warm no c/c/e NEURO A & O x 3  Pertinent Results: SVC GRAM 1) Thrombosis of the superior vena cava and proximal portions of the right subclavian and internal jugular veins.
2) The patient will be reevaluated with a venogram on [**2197-7-17**] to evaluate clot burden at that time.
--- CT [**7-15**] IMPRESSION: Bypass of superior vena cava by intravenous contrast with filling of multiple venous collaterals consistent with SVC thrombosis.
--- ECHO Conclusions: 1.
--- Tagged WBC SCAN IMPRESSION: 1) No definite evidence of an infectious source.
2) Resolving small emboli of clumped tracer material --- CT ABDOMEN/CHEST IMPRESSION: 1.
An infected collection cannot be ruled out.
--- CXR [**8-1**] IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions again seen, with slight interval worsening.
Finally, several days later, he was again taken for a venogram and had a stent place in his SVC.
Total protein was also elevated on lab values.
Serum protein electropheresis sent on hospital day two demonstrated a single band with 20% of his total protein present, which represented an IgG level of 2463mg/dL.
Likewise, urine protein electropheresis identified a band containing 70% of the total urine protein and revealed the presence of Bence-[**Doctor Last Name **] proteins.
Repeat SPEP 10 days later demonstrated an increase in the representation of IgG in total serum protein to 25%, 1968mg/dL, which was concerning for further evidence of relapse.
All of his blood cultures were negative, and the vancomycin was stopped.
Multiple blood cultures were obtained but were perpetually negative.
At this point, he had a VQ scan to rule out PE, as he did have clot remaining in his body, but it was negative.
He then had a chest CT and abdominal CT which were unrevealing.
An echo showed no endocarditis.
He then had a tagged WBC scan which showed no source of infection.
Anemia: Mr [**Known lastname 39602**] initially presented with a Hct of 31 on admission.
We also had an abdominal and chest CT which did not show bleeding.
Hemolysis labs were sent and negative.
Iron studies and B12/folate were also normal and unrevealing.
Given the lack of evidence for hemolysis or loss of red blood cells, the low blood count was concerning as further evidence of myeloma relapse with marrow infiltration.
Renal failure: Following initial procedures performed by Interventional Radiology, patient's serum creatinine began to trend upwards.
Although urine output continued to be adequate, patient's serum creatinine stabilized at ~1.6 (baseline had been 0.7 on admission), which was concerning for an irreversible contrast nephropathy in the setting of likely relapse of myeloma and Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] proteinuria.
