Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification.
Give Vit K and FFPs to keep INR < 1.5.
[**8-16**] MRI C - T - L Spine IMPRESSION: 1.
Markedly limited examination with no obvious findings to suggest vertebral body/disk/epidural infection.
Mild anterior wedge compression deformity involving T5 which appears new from [**2174**] exam but not acute.
[**8-17**] CT ABD/PELVIS: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**8-19**] CT Head w/o contrast: Study severely limited by motion artifact.
The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, unchanged since the prior study.
She underwent ERCP and sphincterotomy which was complicated by hypoxia and hypotesnion.
# Fevers/bacteremia:  Pt was febrile on [**8-9**] to 100.9 and BCx were positive for MRSA.
Repeat U/A was negative for UTI.
PICC line was pulled, and central line was placed.
BCx prelim on [**8-10**] & [**8-11**] show gram (+) cocci, coag negative.
On [**8-13**], pt had Tm 100.2.
MRI of spine did not reveal epidural abscess/osteo/diskitis.
CT abd only shows panniculitis of the right pannicular fat.
CT scan of head was negative.
Lactate level increased to 4.0 on [**8-20**] (venous blood).
Her lipase trended down afterward.
# Acute Renal Failure: On [**8-17**], pt's creatinine increased from 1.0 to 2.1.
# Progressive anemia with melena:  She had three episodes of melena after ERCP with a four point hematocrit drop, but her hematocrit later stabilized at 25-26 g/dl without transfusion.
Vitamin K was administered to correct her coagulopathy (INR 2) and her melena resolved, with brown stools that were still guaiac positive as of [**2182-8-11**].
# Meningioma:  MRI revealed increase in mass, likely a meningioma, in her her T-spine.
Wafarin can be restarted as an outpatient after her hematocrit stabilizes.
Ortho repeated XR, which revealed no change from previous image.
Repeat films show fx healing.
