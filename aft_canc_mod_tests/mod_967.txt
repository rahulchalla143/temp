CT SCAN OF CHEST:   IMPRESSION:   1.
However, the size of these lesions cannot be compared with the PET since the PET CT was performed without IV contrast.
Post-procedure chest x-ray showed complete left lung white-out, likely due to complete left lung atelectasis from blood pooling in left mainstem bronchus.
Hematocrit was stable and remained stable with excellent O2 sats on room air and no respiratory distress.
Repeat CXR showed improvement in aeration of the L lung so no further invasive intervention was planned.
