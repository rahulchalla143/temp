A TTE has been ordered and patient has been in afib on telemetry.
2) CV: Patient did have a recent echo [**8-28**] which revealed an EF > 55%.
His BNP on admission was [**2152**].
He was continued on lasix and his home antihypertensives were resumed after the 24-hours post-TPA allowing for auto-regulation of blood pressure.
In addition, the patient's heart rate was noted to be intermittantly elevated secondary to rapid ventricular response from atrial fibrillation.

He had an ABG notable for a pH of 7.04 and lactate of 5.4.
Chest x-ray did not show any infiltrates.
