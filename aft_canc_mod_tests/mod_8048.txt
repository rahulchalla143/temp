She was seen by the interventional pulmonologist for evaluation for possible stenting, but was unable to tolerate the procedure; she was admitted to the IP service for further management of her hypoxia and dyspnea.
She had a chest CT which showed a large loculated pleural effusion (with pigtail catheter in place), extensive right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and multiple pulmonary nodules.
A V/Q scan demonstrated low probability of pulmonary embolism.

ECG [**10-30**]: Sinus rhythm.
Echo [**10-30**]: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
CXR [**10-30**]: 1.
Cytology pleural fluid [**10-31**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2180-10-30**] the findings are similar.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2180-10-31**] the heart rate is faster.
[**10-31**] CXR: In comparison with the study earlier in this date, there has been placement of a pigtail catheter with removal of substantial amount of fluid from the left chest.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
[**11-5**] CXR (PA/Lat and Lat Decub): At the bases of the right lung, no evidence of pleural effusion is seen.
The last CXR on [**11-5**] demonstrated loculated pleural effusions with nothing easily to take.
Blood and urine cultures were performed and were negative throughout the hospitalization.
She was stating 94% on 6L and ambulatory stats ranged from 89-92%.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation and treatment of shortness of breath.
We have also dicontinued your blood pressure medications as your blood pressures have been low.
