Imaging: CT abd/pelvis [**2178-9-23**]: IMPRESSION: Cirrhosis, splenomegaly, anasarca and mesenteric edema.
Active Issues: # Anemia: Baseline HCT is 25, and patient has had bloody taps as evidenced by prior taps in our system.
Hct is 25, which is at his baseline between 23-28; ED values of 31 and 33 are likely spurious.
His Hct were trended and he required no transfusions while in the MICU.
His Hct remained unchanged on the floor and was deemed stable at discharge.
Urine lytes show FeNa 0.27% and FeUrea 365%.
Chronic Issues: # Cirrhosis: EtOH Cirrhosis with history of recurrent ascites, right hydrothorax, esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, and SBP in the past.
Likely 2/2 HRS 2.
Patient was given albumin and his electrolytes were trended and repleted.
Transitional Issues: #Lytes check in 1 week #COntinue VNA and tube feeds at home #Follow-up blood cultures  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Information was obtained from PatientwebOMR.
It was determined that your blood cell count had not actually decreased, it was just diluted with fluid.
At discharge your kidney function and red blood cell counts were at a normal level for you.
This will help keep your sodium normal.
They will check your electrolytes and make sure that your kidney function continues to improve.
