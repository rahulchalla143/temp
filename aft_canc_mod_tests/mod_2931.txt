Was given flumazenil 0.2mg X 2 for respiratory depression and subsequently had tonic-clonic seizure lasting approximately 5 minutes which terminated after 1mg Ativan IV.
During episode of hypoxia HR decreased to 30s and SBP to 80s.
HR increased spontaneously and BP increased to 110s w/ 500cc NS.
Patient [**Name (NI) **] bagged and O2 sats improved to 90s.

An underlying infiltrate cannot be excluded, and followup PA and lateral views are recommended CT head ([**7-16**]): no intracranial bleed or mass effect   Brief Hospital Course: 53 y/o M w/ metastatic colon CA c/b obstructive jaundice treated w/ palliative ERCP/stent.
Patient transferred to ICU for further monitoring and had an uneventful course.
Respiratory depression/hypoxia: - likely related to conscious sedation - CXR w/ right pleural effusion and possible infiltrate but unlikely primary source of hypoxia as readily reversed -no witnessed aspiration event  2.
Seizure: -likely [**1-13**] hypoxia and flumazenil (although sz uncommon reaction) -head CT negative for bleed or mass effect but cannot r/o metastatic foci of sz activity (MRI would not affect tx) -prn Ativan but no need for empiric or further treatment  3.
