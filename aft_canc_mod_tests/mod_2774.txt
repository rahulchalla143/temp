At OSH, Head CT negative for bleed; + for sinusitis of maxillary, left sphenoid, frontal sinuses.
He also underwent a spiral chest CT on admission which was negative for a PE, but positive for an infiltrate suspicisous for a LLL atelectasis vs PNA, spiculated LUL nodule, and borderline mediastinal LAD.
EKG changes resolved.

No event note found in record, but pt had CT w/ contrast done am on [**2-5**] which showed 75% collapse of L lung, no evidence midline shift.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
TECHNIQUE: CT arteriogram of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained with and without IV contrast.
No prior CT scan of the abdomen or pelvis is available.
Correlation is made with a chest CT dated [**2181-2-7**].
Liver, gallbladder, adrenals, kidneys, spleen and pancreas appear grossly unremarkable.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter.

Since the exam of [**2-19**], there has been probable interval development of a subpulmonic effusion on the right and associated compression atelectasis at the base.

Pt ruled in for NSTEMI, however due to hemodynamic instability, pt did not receive cardiac catheterization.
Respiratory status showed improving acidemia, worsening hypercarbia and worsening hypoxia prompting a chest CT which showed left lung collapse without midline shift.
-[**Hospital1 18**] MICU COURSE ([**Date range (1) 58795**]):    Pt was admitted directly to MICU on dopamine where he was found to be febrile to 101.2, hypotensive to SBP of 70s.
Due to active bacteremia, patient also underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram which revealed no evidence of endocarditis.
Following clearing of cultures and stabilization of blood pressure, patient was called-out to floor and a PICC placed.
Lung Mass: CT surgery following.
