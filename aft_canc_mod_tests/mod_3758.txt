Her initial vital signs at the OSH were unremarkable (temperature 98.5 F, pulse 68, blood pressure 103/62, respiratory rate 18, and oxygen saturation 98% in room air).
A head CT was done and reportedly showed mild midline shift.
In our ED, Radiology reviewed the patient's head CT and felt it was unchanged compared with a head MRI performed here on [**2133-2-26**].
CNS lymphoma diagnosed [**1-4**] when an OSH head CT showed a left frontal mass with significant associated edema; a subsequent brain biopsy here confirmed the diagnosis of CNS lymphoma.
PET scanning showed no evidence of FDG avidity elsewhere.
Bone marrow biopsy did not show lymphoma.

Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 71459**] is a 73-year-old woman who recently received 4 cycles of rituximab and temozolomide for treatment of CNS lymphoma who p/w altered mental status possibly from seizure though toxic metabolic also could be contributing.
CT head on admission showed increased mid-line shift.
Her SBP dropped to 70's; she was started on pressors and then transferred to the ICU.
Repeat CT scan was unchanged.
Repeat EEG consistent with seizure activity in L frontal area, in area of underlying lymphoma.
(2)CNS Lymphoma: CT scan at OSH reportedly not changed from [**3-4**] MRI but repeat imaging here showed an increased midline shift.
Repeat MRI was done.
Repeat MRI showed response to chemotherapy.
