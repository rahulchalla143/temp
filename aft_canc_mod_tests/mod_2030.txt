RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
