Paracentesis  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 39760**] is a 76 y/o F with history of autoimmune hepatitis, diastolic CHF, hypertension, T2DM, as well as abdominal B cell lymphoma recently diagnosed by ex lap in [**Month (only) **], who presents to the hospital after presenting to onc clinic for C2D6 R-CHOP and was found to have abdominal pain, hypotension, and Afib with RVR.
On presentation to clinic today she was noted to be hypotnesive (80s/50s) and tachycardic (150s) with complaints of SOB.
Urgent cultures and labs were drawn and the patient was started on fluid resusitation and received 2grams cefepime, 50mg hydorcortisone (due to recent steroid taper) and was sent to the emergency room with flagyl 500mg hanging.
In the ED, the patient was hypotensive (70/63), tachycardic to the 170s and found to have a rectal temp of 100.4.
An EKG was done which showed Afib with RVR.
Blood and urine cultures were sent from the ED in addition to those gathered in clinic.
Labs in the ED were notable for leukopenia (neutropenia), elevated liver enzymes (65, 46) and a Tbili of 3.5.
also imaging pertinent for a negative head CT, Abd CT which showed small BL pleural effusions, ascites, RLQ mass, new LUL opacity, and ?
CXR showed R base atelectasis, and L base opacification.
was minimally responsive, in afib with a HR of 126, BP of 87/48 without pressors, and satting 93% on 3L NC.
Patient went for a biopsy on [**12-10**] which demonstrated large cell lymphoma and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**12-17**].
Past Medical History: -Autoimmune hepatitis confirmed by biopsy in [**2099**] which was previously treated with Azathioprine and prednisone, now only on prednisone.
-Hypertension -osteoarthritis -sleep apnea -diabetes mellitus insulin-dependent, treated with Novolin and regular insulin -COPD -possible pulmonary hypertension (recent echocardiogram was technically difficult, but did not show evidence, doppler or otherwise of diastolic dysfunction) -hiatal hernia treated with Nexium -multiple allergies with intermittent use of Zyrtec -hyperuricemia treated with urolic -possible history of CHF, which has been treated with Lasix -headaches treated with Fioricet .
No tenderness on exam though patient somnolent and minimally responsive.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2115-1-11**] 5:23 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-10**], the patient has taken a much better inspiration.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT Study Date of [**2115-1-11**] 7:49 AM FINDINGS:  The study was performed at the patient's bedside as she is neutropenic.
Limited images of the right upper quadrant were obtained.

TTE (Complete) Done [**2115-1-14**] at 11:17:49 AM The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-12-19**], the heart rate has increased.
If indicated, a TEE would be better to exclude a valvular vegetation.
CT torso [**2-6**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT head [**2-6**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
She was anticoagulated with enoxaparin once her Plt were >50 and GCSF was stopped when she was no longer significantly neutropenic.
Initial imaging was pertinent for a negative head CT, Abd CT which showed small BL pleural effusions, ascites, RLQ mass, new LUL opacity, and ?
atelectasis in the RLL and a CXR which showed R base atelectasis, and L base opacification.
Her blood cultures from [**1-12**] had 3 sets possitive for s aureus (1 set MSSA and other 2 sets were coag negative s aureus).
Further BCs revealed no further growth.
Admission WBC was 0.2 with 12% neutrophils reaching a nadir of ANC 0 and platelets were 87 but reached a nadir of 10.
Her counts improved and GCS was stopped on [**1-15**] given her rebounding WBC.
Her vancomycin level was high at 42.6 on [**1-14**] and her vancomycin was held, restarting at a lower dose and the level normalised.
Give the presence of a high grade s aureus bacteremia, she proceeded to a TTE on [**1-14**] which showed no evidence of vegetations, moderate MR and a normal EF.
They also felt that as her CVC had been replaced during a time of bacteremia that this should be removed and this occurred on [**1-17**] when she had a further left IJV CVC inserted as hematology were not keen for a tunnelled line and previous PICC attempts had failed in the past.
Pt grossly anasarcic even on prior dischage ([**1-4**]) with albumin of 1.9 on [**1-1**].
Her abdominal wound had areas without skin closure (although fascial planes were closed) and her draining ascites as initially treated with wound bag and latterly after surgical review with a wouund vac.
Her electrolytes were regularly measured and her renal function was stable despite diuresis.
She had lareg blisters which were felt likely due to her  anasarca, one of which was on gher left thigh and burst draining c250ml of fluid.
Her K was aggressively repleted and did not develop a contractin alkalosis.
Her rapid rate was felt likely secondary to her neutropenic sepsis and was difficult to control.
Her oral metoprolol and uptitrated and eventually her HR was controlled off IV agenrts.
Given little evidence for HIT and negative PF4 Ab on the advice of BMT she was started on enoxaparion at treatment dose 100mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-17**] with fXa level monitoring at which point her platelets were >50.
Her counts were supported to transfusion triggers of Plt <20 and HCt <25.
She was profoundly neutropenic until [**1-15**] when WBCs were 5.3 and thsi then rose to 16.7 on [**1-16**] at which point GCSF was stopped.
On the recommendations of hematology, she was started on treatment dose enoxaparin 100mg [**Hospital1 **] with fXa level monitoring on [**1-17**] for her AF after her platelet count was >50.
Rising LDH was suspicious for returning abdominal lymphoma.
Given her recent antibiosis, index of suspicion for c difficle was high.
Her first c difficile toxin was nagetive and  2ns was ...   She was treated initially with IV and then with po metronidazole and her WCC fell.
Her diarrhea improved on transfer to the BMT floor.
She was presumptively treated with oral metronidazole from [**1-18**] given her loose stools and at the [**Last Name (un) 39762**] of writing, 1x c difficle toxin was negative and further sample is pending.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], her Alb was 2.7 (2.3 at lowest value) and given initial pain due to oral ulcers and concerns for starting TPN on a line inserted while bacteremia, TPN was initially held.
In addition, Alk P alos rose during her hospital stay, was 218 on admission, fell during her nadir WBC count and rose to a hiatus of  309.
An initial CT showed ascites without evidence of biliary tree dilatation and normal liver.
Repeat imaging should be considered if thsi progresses.
# GERD: Pt has a history of hiatal hernia and accompanying GERD which caused significant intermittent abdominal discomfort.
Her fluid overload was so egregious that she began to develop weeping bullae on her extremities and abdomen, yet still required pressors and boluses in order to produce urine.
Paracentesis yielded SBP without organisms (so CNNA).
UA suggestive of infection, but urine cultures negative.
CT pan-scan showed no obvious site of infection.
