He was in shock with SBP 70s, HR 130s.
His platelets on admission were 10,000, and his WBC were 3.5.
He underwent a tagged RBC scan which reportedly revealed blood in the R side of the abdomen, felt likely to be in the R colon, although not believed to be a brisk or large bleed.

A tagged RBC scan showed no evidence of active gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
An EGD showed patchy gastritis, few small erosions in duodenal bulb, believed to be unlikely to rebleed.

Tagged RBC scan [**2149-10-13**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of active gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
Additional delayed or repeat imaging may be useful if the patient later shows clinical signs of active bleeding.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the ulcers cecum.
CXR [**2149-10-15**]: FINDINGS: Compared with 11/13, there is a new vague opacity seen just lateral to the right hilar mass.
CT CHEST [**2152-10-18**]: Findings are most consistent with pulmonary, hepatic, and adrenal metastatic disease with concomittant pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis.

A tagged RBC scan suggested a right-sided colonic source.
He arrived at the [**Hospital1 **] with a hematocrit of 21.7 and received 3U of pRBCs.
During his stay at the [**Hospital1 **] he did not rebleed, and his Hct remained stable at 27-30.
An EGD showed patchy gastritis and a few small erosions in duodenal bulb, which did not appear to be a likely source of the bleeding.
Colonoscopy showed cecal ulcers, sigmoid divertics, and internal hemmorhoids.
Pathology from the colonoscopy was pending at the time of discharge...
His INR was 1.2-1.7 during his admission.
On admission to the [**Hospital1 **] his ANC was 588, but his white count increased steadily, and by [**2149-10-14**] his ANC was 2090 and WBCs were >3.
He developed a mild cough productive of yellow sputum, and a CXR suggested an aspiration or infiltrate.
In addition, the patient had a Foley for several days and a U/A was mildly positive with trace leuks, [**2-2**] RBC, [**5-10**] WBC, and few bacteria.
A urine Cx taken [**2149-10-15**] grew enterococci and coag neg staph.
Blood culture from [**2149-10-15**] was positive (1/2 bottles) for MRSA (sensitive to rifampin, tetracycline, gentamicin).
His vital signs responded well to small fluid boluses.
Multiple repeat blood cultures were drawn and a CT of his chest was obtained.
They recommended IV vancomycin and cefepime for 14 days and then subsequent blood cultures to ensure that the bacteria was cleared from the blood.
Both a TTE and a TEE were performed which on preliminary read showed no vegetations on the valves.
The ID fellow will follow up on these results and the blood cultures in clinic 2 weeks after discharge.
Prior to this appointment, he will have 2 sets of blood cultures drawn on [**11-3**] and 6th.
While at home, he will follow his temperatures and contact his PMD if his temperature elevates above 100.0.
Diverticulosis 5.
Your blood count (hematocrit) was stable after the transfusions.
You initially had a low white count and low platelet count, but these counts recovered into the normal range after a few days.
A colonoscopy showed ulcers, diverticulosis (small weakenings of the colon wall), and hemorrhoids.
Pathology results from the colonoscopy are still pending at the time of your discharge.
An upper endoscopy showed mild inflammation in your stomach and small erosions in your duodenum.
You then developed signs of an infection of your blood and your blood cultures showed an infection.
