An implantable defibrillator was placed at that time.
Further decompensation occurred while the patient was transferred to the CCU and he ultimately required emergent intubation.
Pre-intubation gas 7.42/41/79.
The patient's blood pressure decreased following intubation requiring IV fluids and Neo-Synephrine.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, CAD status post MI in [**2197**], status post LAD stent, catheterization in [**2194**] showed three-vessel disease with 50 percent narrowing of the LAD, 30 percent narrowing of the proximal SARC and 60 percent narrowing of the marginal branch.
Echo in [**2198-11-18**], showed an EF of 50 percent, mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]; and a normal pulmonary artery pressure, history of ventricular tachycardia status post implantable defibrillator, right upper lobe mass diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma, no endobronchial disease on bronchoscopy done at [**Hospital1 336**] (status post pleuracentesis, fluid was non malignant, MRI revealed mediastinal involvement, thus the patient was considered non- resectable; status post 12 radiation treatments in addition to a course of Paxil and carboplatin), hypercholesterolemia, and history of atrial fibrillation, taken off Coumadin four weeks ago.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 97.2, blood pressure 72/25 with a CVP of four, and heart rate of 65.
The patient is on AC with a tidal volume of 600 and respiratory rate of 14, with a PIP of 5, FIO2 of 60 percent, with an O2 saturation of 95 percent.
ABG was 7.43/31/75.
Extremities, 1 to 2 plus pitting edema in the upper extremities, left greater than the right, no clubbing or cyanosis.
Neurologically, alert, follows commands, strength 4/4 bilaterally in the upper and lower extremities, 1 plus reflexes bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA AND DIAGNOSTICS:  White count is 3.9, hematocrit 32.2, platelets 88 with 86 percent neutrophils, 12 percents lymphocytes, and 2 percent monocytes.
Sodium is 136, potassium 4.5, bicarbonate 20, BUN 59, creatinine 1.7, and lactate 1.2.
Plan for an initial right main stem bronchus stent, however, bronchoscopy revealed multiple endobronchial lesions, thus be more appropriate treatment was thought to be photodynamic therapy.
Unfortunately, his lung did not re-expand and the chest tube remained in place at the time of his death.
The patient presented with blood pressure of 72/25 with a CVP of four on peripheral Neo-Synephrine.
His blood pressure did respond to p.r.n.
During the course of his stay Vasopressin was added to further support his blood pressures.
Troponins were slightly elevated at level of 0.05; however, CK MB remained negative, and EKG unchanged.
The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, but was paced at a rate of 66 on presentation and remained in sinus.
The patient presented with bilateral upper extremity edema, left greater than right; bilateral Dopplers were negative for DVT.
The patient was administered GCSF in hopes of recovering his white blood count and this medication was discontinued when he was no longer neutropenic.
Sputum culture grew Gram-negative rods with moderate Haemophilus.
He was administered vitamin K and DIC panel was negative.
His creatinine came down with IV fluids and his urine output responded to fluid boluses.
However, later in his ICU stay, his creatinine again rose.
Urine eos were negative.
Protein to creatinine was 1.0; FENA at that time was 0.9 percent with urine output of 423.
His creatinine reached as high as 4.2.
