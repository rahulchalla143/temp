**FINAL REPORT [**2106-11-23**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2106-11-23**]):       YEAST.
Cardiac Echo [**2106-11-16**] IMPRESSION: Cor pulmonale; no intracardiac shunt.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-11-14**], no obvious change.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2106-11-15**] COMMENTS: 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 22 mm Hg.
Left sided filling pressures were normal with mean PCW of 15 mmHg.
Abdominal Ultrasound [**2106-11-18**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT chest, without contrast [**2106-11-15**] IMPRESSION: 1)Marked enlargement of the pulmonary artery suggests pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Chest x-ray [**2106-11-22**] COMPARISON: [**2106-11-17**]; CT from [**2106-11-15**].
Brief Hospital Course:   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year-old woman with hypertension and polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for workup of new pulmonary hypertension with RV failure.
Given positive D-dimer and coagulopathy at admission along with negative CTA, an alternative explanation would include microembolic or thrombotic disease with the pulmonary vasculature that is sufficiently diffuse to avoid detection on CT.
Some prelinary work-up for vasculitus and systemic disease was negative.
Negative [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, anti centromere as well as SPEP and UPEP,TSH slightly high but free T4 normal, awaiting anti-scl 70.
ECHO negative for ASD or evidence of R->L shunting.
Persistant O2 sats in low 90s on NRB, and high 80s on NC but without subjective SOB.
Did receive contrast at OSH (though elevation present prior to scan).
Total LOS net negative over 7L.
Polycythemia [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] is seen by outside Hematologist, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 65126**], who maintains her on hydroxyurea be given at 500 mg QD; if Hct contiune to rise on QD dosing recommend increase to [**Hospital1 **].
Hepatosplenomegaly   Also with ascites - resolved with diuresis.
INR elevated to 1.5 at admission without explanation.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of shortness of breath and difficulty breathing in the context of severe pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure within the vessels supplying your lungs).
You initally came to the medicine [**Hospital1 **], but were next care for in the intensive care unit where further fluid could be removed and the pressure within your lung blood vessels monitored while various drugs were trialled.
