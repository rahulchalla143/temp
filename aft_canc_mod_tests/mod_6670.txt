Since the patient reported no cardiac history nor any chest pain at the time or in the past month, and since the data was not conclusive for an acute MI, and in light of the ARF, the patient was medically managed for CAD with ASA, Statin.
His creatinine did trend back down to near normal levels.
Blood cultures were drawn as pt had previously spiked a fever (although he'd been afebrile since), and patient was started on diazepam for EtOH withdrawal.
An echocardiogram on [**2129-6-6**] showed ant-anterolateral akinesis, left apical aneurysm, and an EF of 30%.
In order to assess his cardiac disease, he was thus taken for cardiac cath (unable to schedule P-MIBI), which showed 3 vessel disease with left main disease.
Examination revealed a warm, erythematous, tender L knee.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
Beta blockers and diuretics were initiated and his chest tubes were removed on post-op day one.
He developed atrial fibrillation that was treated with beta blockers and amiodarone which controlled his rate and he converted to normal sinus rhythm.
He has not been started on an ace inhibitor due to elevated creatinine that is returning to baseline, plan to follow up with PCP for evaluation in 2 weeks.
