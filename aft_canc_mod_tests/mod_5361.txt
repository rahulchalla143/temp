Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic  function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure.
Nutritional status checked and tube feedings were optimized to prepare for surgery in order to replace the 20lbs lost prior to presentation.
Exploratory laparotomy, 2. lysis of adhesions, 3. resection of recurrent gastric cancer and gastrojejunostomy, 4.
Feeding jejunostomy, and 7.
On [**2181-11-11**] the patient was noted to have a drop in hematocrit from 30 to 24 with an INR of 1.7 on Lovenox.
JP drain output was more serosangenous than previously.
There was no source of bleeding, and he was transfused several more units over the next 2 days for a hematocrit which continued to trend down.
Cardiology did not see the need for an antiarrythmic as the irregular heart beats were in the immediate post-operative period.
An Echo was later essentially normal.
