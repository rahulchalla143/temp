Her oxygen saturations dropped to the 70s, and came up on a non rebreather to 91%.
Her heart rate also went from the 60's to the 120s as well.
CT of the chest showed no evidence of pneumothorax, but did show hemorrhage around biopsy site, and new bilateral pleural effusions.
On evaluation in the radiology suite, she complained of shortness of breath and sleepiness while denying chest pain, headache, or palpitation.
Her BP was 140's /90s, HR in the 120's.

ECG Study Date of [**2189-5-28**]  11:30:10 AM Probable sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2189-3-17**] the rate is markedly faster and inferolateral ST segment changes are more prominent.

The patient developed hemoptysis and the post- procedure CT scan demonstrated possible aspiration.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2189-5-29**] 3:49 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-19**] through [**5-28**]: Heavy asbestos-related pleural calcification obscures larger areas of both lungs.
CXR was consistent with aspiration pneumonitis, as was CT scan.
Pt initially had O2Sat in the 70s, but eventually tolerated RA with sats 94%.
Repeat CXR on [**5-29**] did not show significant worsening.
MI was ruled out with cardiac markers x3 (0.04, 0.04, 0.02).
Hct was 31.5 immediately post-procedure.
Repeat hct dropped to 29 and was stable on discharge.
Lung Mass: Previous biopsy showed poorly differentiated adenoCA.
She was continued on her home diltiazem 240mg QD and HCTZ 50mg QD.
During this period, your blood pressure was elevated at times as high as 190s.
This was treated with diltiazem, and your blood pressure and heart rate improved.
On discharge, your heart rhythm was normal and your blood pressure had improved to systolic in the 150s.
As discussed, you should review with your new PCP these issues, particularly treatment of your blood pressure and evaluation for the irregular heart rhythm atrial flutter/fibrillation, since recurrent episodes of this can lead to stroke.
Your blood count (hematocrit) did decrease following the procedure you underwent.
You should have your blood count rechecked within the week.
