[**2101-9-12**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)     [**Last Name (LF) 2437**],[**First Name3 (LF) **] In comparison with the study of [**9-11**], there are lower lung volumes.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2101-5-10**] no diagnostic interval change.

He denied symptoms of respiratory illness, however, his CT chest was suggestive of a bilateral ground glass pneumonia.
His legionella and respiratory viral panel were negative.
He persisted with tachycardia after his blood pressure was normal.
# Coagulopathy: INR 1.6 on admission.
CT head negative for intracranial hemorrhage.
TTE showed no evidence of structural disease leading to sycope and patient was monitored on telemetry without arrthymia events.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please ensure that his counts stay normal now that treatment for his AML is complete - Please follow up fasting blood glucose levels once he is no longer in the stress phase of illness.
You underwent red blood cell and platelet transfusions for this.
