MICROBIOLOGY: Blood & Urine culture ([**2122-8-2**]) did not grow anything.
MR THORACIC SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2122-8-20**] 1.
ECHO [**2122-8-3**]: - Mild Regional [**Last Name (LF) 47663**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 45-55% - 1+ MR, No AR - No pericardial effusion .
Back pain: MRI showed compression fracture of the T11 vertebral body and possibly also a minimal fracture of the L4 vertebral body, likely due to osteoporosis from chronic steroids use.
There were no neurologic symptoms to suggest cord involvement and MRI showed no cord compression; neurology was consulted and agreed.
A repeat MRI for new onsent upper back pain (see below) showed a change of a small fragment retropulsed with moderate indentation on the ventral thecal sac.
She was initially ruled out for a myocardial infarction with cardiac enzymes x3 and EKG.
An ECHO was also performed, which revealed mild regional [**Date Range 47663**] with EF 45-55%.
Although the patient remained on a low-dose of prednisone 10mg daily, a cortisol stimulation test was performed, which showed a strong rise from the suppressed endogenous cortisol level of 0.6 to 19 one half hour after the test, making adrenal insufficiency unlikely.
Unstable angina with acute inferior posterior MI in a previously infarcted territory:  On [**2122-8-5**], the patient developed substernal chest pressure, and an EKG was performed that showed a change from admission, with inferoseptal depressed and downward sloping ST segments.
She was managed conservatively with SL NTG, Lopressor, which was titrated up as BP tolerated, [**Date Range **] 325 mg, [**Date Range **] 75 mg [**Hospital1 **], and Lovenox 60mg SC BID.
The [**Hospital1 3242**] service and the Cardiology service felt that the risk of cardiac cath outweighed the benefits given the patient's history of the last cardiac cath.
Pt was titrated back up to Metoprolol 200 mg po BID, and pt was started on Ranolazone and her EKGs were monitored daily for QT prolongation.
Urine culture from [**8-2**] with NGTD and the Cipro was discontinued.
As she was being transferred for an ultrasound study (negative for DVT), she developed acute back and scapular pain.
Repeat MRI did not show a new fracture and no evidence for aortic dissection was noted on this nonideal study.
