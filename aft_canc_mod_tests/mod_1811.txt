Postop CXR [**2123-8-18**]  INDICATION: Assessment for fluid overload.
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right pleural effusion has substantially increased.
Comparison is made with prior study performed 3 hours earlier.
Brief Hospital Course: 74M with significant medical history including DM, ESRD on HD, NSCLC s/p multiple radiation treatments, PVD s/p R CFA-AKpop bypass [**2122**], L [**Name (NI) 1793**] PTA/stent [**7-19**] presented with gangrene of the left first and second toes and chronic nonhealing left heel ulcer with a new foul odor.
Forefoot PVRs were performed showing that the metatarsal waveforms on the right are dampened but slightly improved compared to left.
A CXR was obtained to evaluate for fluid overload since the patient had received 900 cc of fluid intraoperatively in addition to missing his morning dialysis session.
The CXR showed white out of the right lung consistent with R lung collapse.
The patient has a known history of lung CA s/p radiation but this CXR was significantly different from his preoperative exam.
He was placed on BIPAP and monitored and aggressive chest PT was performed.
Serial CXRs were obtained and improved over the next 24-48 hours.
