CT there showed right temporal hypodensity with edema and minimal midline shift.
He was given IV keppra 500mg and Dexamethasone 10mg IV and lorazepam 1mg IV x2.
Pertinent Results: [**2138-10-12**] MRI brain with and without contrast: IMPRESSION: A heterogeneous lesion in the right temporal lobe measuring approximately 5.3 x 3.0 cm with heterogeneous nodular peripheral enhancement, moderate surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
[**2138-10-12**]: CT chest/Abd/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
An MRCP is recommended on a non-urgent basis within 6 months to evaluate for an incidental cystic pancreatic lesion.
[**10-13**]: Functional MRI and MR Spect Successful functional MRI of the brain, demonstrating the expected activation areas in the cerebral cortex during the movement of the hands, feet, language, and during the movement of the tongue.
[**10-15**] CT Head- IMPRESSION: Immediately status post right temproparietal craniotomy, with post-surgical changes but no evidence of acute complication.
[**10-16**] MRI Brain- Post op changes, enhancement along surgical bed consistent with surgical changes.
He underwent MRI brain to better evaluate the lesion.
CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed to rule out primary malignancy.
On [**2138-10-13**] he underwent functional MRI testing that demonstrated the expected activation areas in the cerebral cortex during the movement of the hands, feet, language, and during the movement of the tongue.
Post op head CT revealed post operative changes and no hemorrhage.
He was cleared for transfer to the floor, foley was discontinued and activity/diet were advanced.
?You will need an MRI of the brain with/without gadolinium contrast.
If you are required to have a MRI, you may also require a blood test to measure your BUN and Cr within 30 days of your MRI.
