His bile grew out VRE on [**2-17**] in addition to 3+ yeast.
His prior imaging had been significant for renal ultrasound which showed no hydronephrosis and left 7 mm renal stone and good bilateral blood scan.
CT scan on [**2110-2-18**] had revealed stable peripancreatic fluid collection, left renal stone and diverticulosis.
Chest x-ray on [**2110-2-19**] revealed a right upper lobe opacity and bibasilar atelectasis.
On [**2110-3-2**] an abdominal ultrasound was done to assess for vascular flow in his liver and kidneys for a complaint of left flank pain.

The right kidney was 10 cm, the left was 11 cm.
The goal for his hematocrit was to keep it above 30.

His albumin was 2.5.
His AST was 729 and ALT was 261.
He also required Levophed drip for blood pressure support in light of his septic physiology.
Arterial blood gas was 7.33, 61, 64, 34 and 3.

A post placement cholangiogram demonstrated appropriate positioning of the tube with the side holes draining into the intrahepatic biliary duct and distal pigtail within the small bowel.
The patient underwent a bronchoscopy which revealed copious secretions which were suctioned from the right upper lobe and right lower lobe.
Patient continued to be resuscitated with fresh frozen plasma and platelets throughout his hospital course.
On [**2110-3-27**] a repeat ultrasound was done due to his biliary drainage which had decreased output and continuously rising bilirubin.
His white count on [**2110-3-27**] was 17,000 with a hematocrit of 29 and a platelet count of 55.
His INR was 2.7 with a  PTT of 71.4.

His alkaline phosphatase was 893, ALT of 45 and an AST of 112.
His white count was 20,000.
His culture data at that time showed a negative urine, a negative sputum although a bronchoalveolar lavage revealed no fungal and no viral cultures.
His swab head confirmed varicella antigen test.
His [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drain had [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.
His C. Difficile was negative and his catheter tips were all negative multiple times.
His bilirubin was 44 and his white count was 20,000 which was elevated.
On [**2110-3-31**] he had a chest x-ray which revealed continued small bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral patchy opacities with a residual opacity in the right mid lung.
His varies lines were in the proper position at that time.
