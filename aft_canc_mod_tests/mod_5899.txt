A PET scan in mid-[**Month (only) 116**] demonstrated widespread osseous metastases, and he underwent right sacral biopsy on [**6-27**].
DFA was negative for influenza and outpatient labs demonstrated a new hyperbilirubinemia at 5.6 (up from 0.9 only 10 days earlier), and elevated LDH at 4980 (up from 496).
On [**7-2**], he was sent to the emergency room for evaluation of continued fevers with elevated LFTs.
RUQ ultrasound showed cholelithiasis with gall bladder wall thickening and CT abdomen demonstrated periportal/peripancreatic fat stranding.
During the course of the day, his blood pressure trended down and his fevers continued.
He was sent for urgent ERCP for concern of cholangitis and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
In addition, his preliminary pathology from his sacral biopsy indicated a likely diagnosis of lymphoma, and he was therefore transitioned to the medical service for work-up.
A head CT at [**Hospital1 **] demonstrated a 7mm lesion at the pontine/medullary junction.
Symptoms and LDH improved on a decadron taper at home although repeat imaging at [**Hospital1 **] showed no evidence of CNS lesion.

Micro: UCx [**7-2**] pending BCx [**7-2**] and [**7-3**] pending DFA negative for influenza  Imaging: PET scan from [**2182-5-31**]: 1.
Focal uptake (SUVmax 4.0) in the right lower lobe with corresponding nodule on CT compatible with primary lung neoplasm.
Liver US [**7-2**]: Cholelithiasis with gallbladder wall thickening, a non-specific finding.
Consider further evaluation with HIDA scan if there is concern for acute cholecytitis.
CXR [**2182-7-2**]:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
CT Abd/Pelvis with contrast [**7-3**]: 1.
Right sacral biopsy [**6-28**]:  pending (prelim is lymphoma per onc team)   Brief Hospital Course: In short, Mr [**Known lastname 99248**] is a 62M with history of adenocarcinoma of the lung admitted with fevers in the setting of likely new diagnosis of lymphoma.
# Large B Cell Lymphoma: Had a bone marrow bx on [**7-4**] that showed diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
Final path results from [**6-27**] biopsy showed diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
He had a TTE pre-chemo that showed normal wall motion without evidence of systolic or diastolic dysfunction.
His tumor lysis labs were followed Q6H without significant change.
In terms of infection, CXR, urine and blood cultures were negative to date and DFA showed no evidence of influenza.
His imaging showed some peripancreatic fat stranding that could be suggestive of pancreatitis.
WBC declined while in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
# Elevated LFTs: Although pattern was suggestive of obstructive process, his ERCP was normal.
When checked, found that total bilirubin was elevated secondary to indirect bilirubinemia from hemolytic process.
Had a head CT that showed no acute process.
Medications on Admission: Atorvastatin 20mg po daily (patient not taking) Lorazepam 0.5-1mg Q12H prn was on decadron and keppra during [**2182-5-31**]  Discharge Medications: 1.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of fevers and elevated liver function tests.
You were initially evaluated by the surgical team who determined you did not have a surgical emergency by doing a CT scan of your abdomen and an ERCP.
While you were here the biopsy of the lesion on your hip, which was done as an outpatient, returned as a large B cell lymphoma.
Dr.[**Name (NI) 3588**] assistant will call you to set up an appointment with him and his Nurse [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3235**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3236**] on Tuesday, [**7-9**].
