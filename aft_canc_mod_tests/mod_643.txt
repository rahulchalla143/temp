He recently presented to his PCP complaining of weight loss and was referred for repeat colonoscopy [**10-16**] which was was incomplete due to luminal narrowing.
A virtual colonoscopy was recommended.
EGD performed at the same time as the colonoscopy showed a reducible small size hiatal hernia , Grade II ESOPHAGITIS with no bleeding, mild gastritis, Abnormal mucosa with contact bleeding was noted throughout the duodenum, A single sessile 10mm non-bleeding polyp of benign appearance was found in the proximal bulb.
Of note in [**4-6**], for positive occult blood, he had colonoscopy which showed a single hyperplastic polyp.
EGD showed duodenal polyp- biopsy consistent with chronic inflammation.
His HCT on arrival to ED was 15, down from hct 27 two weeks ago by his PCP.
MICU course notable for: - Aggressive volume resusitation with 7UPRBC and Hct increased from 15 to 28 - Corrected coagulopathy with 2U FFP - Started on iv PPI - Aflutter in the setting of volume depletion (since resolved) - He was made DNR/DNI and discussions were made regarding hospice care - Pt initially hypotensive iwth SBP in 70s but improved with blood transfusions.
He became hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the floor on [**10-21**] for further workup and treatment.
Recently dx colon mass w/ drop mets and ascites noted on most recent CT [**2116-10-16**]  (see HPI) 8.

Serum Hpylori pending   Brief Hospital Course: In summary, a 71 yo M w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG '[**14**], chronic type A aortic dissection, probable colon cancer recently diagnosed, and sz disorder admitted with GIB in setting of known colon mass but also w/ h/o abnormal duodenal mucosa s/p duodenal polypectomy.
# Gastrointestinal Bleed: Initially admitted with Hct 15.
Hematocrit remained stable after initial blood transfusions in the MICU.
He had an episode of malanotic stool on the evening of [**10-25**] at 9pm and EGD [**10-26**] showed non-bleeding broad based ulcer.
Hct remained stable and he had no further episodes of bleeding.
We recommend that his Hct continued to be monitored as an outpatient by his PCP/oncology given likely ongoing slow bleed from GI malignancy.
He then underwent a colonoscopy on [**10-29**] and the mass was biopsied.
He will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**11-4**] at 2pm to discuss biopsy findings and options.
His BPs remained in the low 90-100s on the floor.
He did require boluses of furosemide with blood transfusions.
His aspirin was held due to the GI bleed and the betablocker and ac inhibtotor were held due to blood pressures in the low 90s-100.
Consistent with vitamin K deficiency, felt likely due to poor po intake.
DIC labs were negative.
He was given Vitamin K and FFP and INR remained at 1.5. .
# Stable Aortic dissection: Unchanged on CT from [**2116-10-16**].
