Review of the CT scan of [**2177-2-6**] shows evidence of a biliary stent in place, pneumobilia, and mild-to-moderate intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Ultrasound examination done today confirms the presence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation, the degree of dilatation is mild.
She was likely third-spacing much of the volume given during fluid resuscitation: ascites, anasarca, complicated by poor nutrition and protein loss in ascites and ascitic fluid removal which was performed to relieve abdominal discomfort.
An attempt was made to replete intravascular volume with blood products, but this did not appreciably improve her blood pressure, despite a hematocrit above 30.
Her blood pressure dropped in the final hours of her life.
RUQ US shows complete occlusion of right portal vein and partial occlusion of main portal vein.
