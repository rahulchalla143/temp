He underwent a full metastatic workup including PET scan, MRI of the brain and staging mediastinoscopy.
He cleared all of his mediastinal lymph nodes with the chemoradiotherapy and his MRI of the brain and PET scan demonstrated no evidence of metastatic disease and traumatic response of the tumor.

COMPARISON: FDG-PET [**2153-6-13**] and [**2153-4-19**]  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained following administration of oral contrast and 130 cc of Optiray.
CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is air seen in the subcutaneous tissues of the chest on the left.
CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Spleen, pancreas, liver, gallbladder, stomach, duodenum are unremarkable.
Abdominal loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable.
There is extensive mesenteric peritoneal stranding in the abdomen, that could be due to patient treatment/debilitation, but peritoneal tumor involvement cannot definitively be excluded amd attention on follow-up exam is recommeded.
CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, urinary bladder, distal ureters, prostate, seminal vesicles are unremarkable.
Coronal and sagittal reconstructed images were reviewed, and were essential in delineating anatomy and pathology as described above.
