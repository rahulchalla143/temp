The patient is currently disoriented in the trauma SICU, with CAT scan that showed C5 lamina and spinous process fracture and vertebral foramen fracture around C5.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 76, blood pressure 146/64, respiratory rate 14, breathing 99 percent 3 liters nasal cannula.
Appropriate neuro examination at this time is noted to be difficult.
CHEST:  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for further observation and study and then was transferred to the Trauma SICU at this time.
He was on a propofol drip at this time and a Solu-Medrol drip.
Endotracheal tube was required to proceed with his MRI with a plan to extubate when the study is completed.
Arterial blood gases drawn and a chest x-ray was performed.
The patient's MRI, MRA showed cord enhancement and then on the left it was noted that the vertebral artery was not visible.
CT angiogram also showed a stenotic vertebral artery.
The patient at this time was started on a Heparin drip with a goal  PTT of 40 to 60.
The patient was also on an insulin drip at this time for elevated blood glucose on finger sticks.
4, [**2110-10-5**], the patient had an official read of CAT scan of his head and facial CT as follow up.
The patient was still tachycardic and hypertensive at this time with blood pressure up to 180/70 and heart rate into the 120's.
5 the patient was noted to have a temperature of 101.3 and cultures were sent and labetalol was required to control his systolic blood pressure.
He was noted to have coarse breath sounds at this time and on chest x-ray was noted to be largely unchanged with some signs of infiltrate.
Breath sounds were noted to be equal bilaterally.
Trauma team was notified that the airway was regained and of the prior events.
Blood pressure at this time was noted to dip down into the 60's and 70's systolically.
Levophed was briefly started but blood pressure soon returned to the 200 and Levophed was promptly discontinued.
The patient was then taken for repeat head CAT scan.
The patient was given morphine and Ativan and was noted to have a blood pressure of 150 systolically in the CT scanner.
CAT scan showed no changes at this time and he was seen by neurosurgery who requested a CT angiogram to assess vertebral arteries.
CT angiogram showed stable occlusion of the vertebral artery at this time.
The plan was for the patient to have blood pressure greater than 150 at all times systolically and heparin was continued with a goal PTT of 40 to 60.
Levophed was stopped at this time as the patient was not requiring pressors to maintain blood pressure above 150 systolically.
7, [**2110-10-8**], the patient was noted to have grown on culture strep viridans from his blood, likely oropharyngeal flora in his sputum, Enterococcus in his urine that was Pen sensitive.
8, [**2110-10-9**], the patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram that showed no vegetations or any signs of regurgitation or other valve abnormalities with a plan to also have a transesophageal echocardiogram performed.
The patient was placed back on Levophed for systolic blood pressure greater than 150 with a plan to discuss with neurosurgery how long these blood pressure parameters were necessary.
The patient also had a hematocrit dropped to 23.5 during this time and received two units of packed red blood cells.
9, [**2110-10-10**], the patient's hematocrit was noted to drop to 19 and urine output having decreased with persistent tachycardia.
The patient was also seen by Neurology on this date who recommended not using pressors to maintain a target systolic blood pressure and suggested continuing to treat sepsis and hemorrhage and to use fluid boluses if needed They also suggested to consider an MRI with diffusion to assess whether the patient has in fact sustained an acute infarct.
On hospital day No 10, [**2110-10-11**], the patient continued to have labile blood pressure ranging from the 70's to the 210's.
A right femoral ultrasound was also performed at this time to rule venous pseudoaneurysm and anticoagulation was reassessed in the background of this bleed with need for anticoagulation for left vertebral artery thrombosis.
The MRI/ MRA of [**10-11**], of the head and neck showed no obvious infarction.
11, [**2110-10-12**], Vancomycin was stopped and Lopressor was added for blood pressure control and urine catecholamines were also sent at this time to try to explain these possible sudden rises in blood pressure.
The patient's hematocrit at this time was noted to be 24.8 and regular hematocrit checks were continued.
The patient now had his left maxillary sinus taps, 2 cc of blood tinged fluid was removed and sent for culture and sensitivity.
Hematocrit was stable at this time between 25.2, and 26.3 on this date.
Metoprolol was then given orally 2 twice day and [**2110-10-13**], the patient also received transesophageal echocardiogram that revealed no vegetations and no significant valvular abnormalities or regurgitations.
The patient's hematocrit continued to be stable.
Maxillary sinus fluid was noted to be positive for Enterococcus at this time and the antibiotics given at this time were vancomycin and Levofloxacin.
Clonidine was also added at this time for further blood pressure control and angiography was still being planned at this time.
CAT scan at this time was noted to show no acute infarcts and the MRI/ MRA of [**10-11**], of the head and neck showed no obvious infarction.
Sputum was found to be Methicillin- Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus positive.
The patient also then required being placed back on Levophed for blood pressure systolic in the 60's that was not temporarily related to sedation and then Levophed was discharged again as the patient's blood pressure rebounded appropriately.
17, [**2110-10-18**], the patient required two more units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 22.9, with a plan to obtain abdominal CAT scan if this hematocrit continued to drop.
Lopressor and Clonidine were increased at this time and blood pressure decreased down to the 80s around 10 p.m. that evening.
Antibiotics were changed to a Linezolid from Vancomycin due to Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus in sputum.
A chest x-ray was obtained.
The patient was noted to need spinal rehab placement once he was weaned to the tracheal mask and was assessed for pap smear of valve when appropriate.
Pressor support was gradually weaned and sputum gram stain at this time showed no organisms.
On [**2110-10-27**], the patient was noted to have desaturations to 80 percent with tachycardia at 120 and blood pressure to 200/100.
Saturations were noted to improve with ventilation.
The patient then became responsive after 5 minutes with oxygen saturations  to 100 percent, heart rate to 60 and systolic blood pressure to 150's.
The patient also received a bedside swallow and pap smear of valve of valve evaluation at this time.
The patient tolerated this well with good oxygen saturations and no respiratory distress and without excessive secretion interference.
Detailed instructions were given to always deflate the cuff prior to placing the valve and to monitor oxygen saturations and respirations while valve was in place.
27, [**2110-10-28**], final reads were obtained of the CAT scan of the patient's head following this prior episode of diaphoresis and unresponsiveness, and rhythmic eyelid movement.
CAT scan of the head was negative for any new significant pathology.
EEG studies showed no seizure activity.
The patient also had lower extremity non-invasive studies performed that ruled out deep vein thrombosis.
There were no new cultures over the last 5 days and on [**2110-10-30**], the patient had CT angiogram that showed bilateral pulmonary emboli and the patient was then started on anticoagulation with Lovenox.
Oxygen saturations continued to be at 100 percent at this time.
The patient was also restarted on metoprolol at 25 mg b.i.d and blood pressure range was still noted to be 130 to 190 systolically over 50 to 90 diastolically.
A chest x-ray was performed the prior day that revealed atelectasis but no signs of congestive heart failure.
Sputum continued to grow gram positive cocci and gram negative rods.
Vital signs were stable.
This was noted to be not decreasing his oxygen saturations or causing any shortness of breath.
Throughout this stay the patient was in the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit and Neurosurgery teams were in good contact with the patient's family with the daughter acting as this [**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy.
Potassium phosphate 15 mmol/ 250 ml intravenous as    needed for phosphate less than 3.6 to be infused over 6    hours.
Calcium gluconate 2 grams for calcium less than 1.12    as needed.
