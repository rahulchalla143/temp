Intubation/extubation  CT guided liver biopsy  Left PICC placement  History of Present Illness: 55 yo M with hx renal cell carcinoma s/p nephrectomy, HTN, and HLD presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ER on [**12-4**] with R-sided hemipelgia.
He arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] with a GCS of 15 and a code stroke was called.
His NIHSS was 14.
A CT head revealed a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage and a neurosurgical consult was called.
Past Medical History: Renal cell carcinoma, s/p nephrectomy approximately 5 years prior MRSA skin abscesses HTN infrarenal abdominal aneurysm diverticulosis hypercholesterolemia MVP with moderate/severe MR   Social History: lives with wife, past history of alcohol abuse, current intake unknown, has 3 children   Family History: mother with pancreatic cancer  Physical Exam: On Admission: VS; BP 153/77 P 105 RR 20  100% on vent Gen; intubated, sedated Pulm; CTA b/l CV; RRR, no murmurs Abd; soft, NT, ND Extr; no edema Neuro; unable to perform neurological assessment as patient received paralytic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for urgent intubation and subsequent craniotomy.
Exam was notable for left gaze preference, RUQ visual field cut, plegic right arm and leg, and mild-moderate aphasia.
Pertinent Results: Head CT [**12-5**]: Note is made of a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered at the left frontal lobe, difficult to precisely marginate though measuring approximately 41 x 34 x 79 mm.
Diagnostic considerations include metastatic disease in this patient with known history of previous renal cell carcinoma, primary mass, and alternatively vascular malformations.
C-spine CT [**12-5**]: IMPRESSION: No fracture.
MRI Brain w/ & w/o [**12-6**]: Status post left frontoparietal craniectomy with post-surgical edema and hematoma at the resection site.
[**2128-12-9**] MRI C/T/L SPINE: IMPRESSION: 1.
Dedicated abdominal CT scan is recommended in further evaluation.
Infrarenal aortic aneurysm, minimally changed from the prior CT scan from [**2127**] with a maximal diameter measurement of approximately 3.2 cm.
[**2128-12-10**] CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS: IMPRESSION: 1.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
If indicated, a TEE would better exclude a small valve vegetation.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2128-12-5**] PATHOLOGY DIAGNOSIS: Parietal "tumor": Blood clot, see note.

During surgery there was question of an underlying lesion or cyst and the resected area was sent to pathology for histology.
The pathology returned as hemorrhage and clot, there was no evidence of malignancy.
On [**12-6**] an MRI without contrast was done which showed post-operative changes but no lesion was seen.
He was planned for PEG placement, but subsequent speech and swallow consultation revealed that he had a good gag and swallow, and after a video swallow, the patient was cleared for solid foods with thin liquids, but medications to be crushed in puree.
He should continue Dilantin until seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; Goal of [**11-30**] (inpatient Dilantin levels have been corrected w/Albumin levels) at current dose of 120 mg PO Q8H.
Repeat level should be drawn and dose should be adjusted accordingly on [**2128-12-17**].
His blood cultures were positive for MRSA.
He had complained of back pain, and an MRI C/T/L spine showed a paraspinal lesion that was concerning for a necrotic lymph node or mets, and CT Abd/pelvis showed a large liver mass.
The liver lesion was biopsied, and prelim pathology read was likely malignancy, not infectious though final read is pending at the time of discharge.
Patient had a TTE which showed severe mitral regurgitation, but no vegetations.
He subsequently had a TEE which also showed no vegetations, but there was posterior mitral leaflet flair with severe MR.  ID felt that this would warrant a full 6 week course of antibiotic therapy as there may be some seeding or possible endocarditis there.
**Followup CXR should be performed in [**7-19**] weeks to ensure resolution.
The patient had the mass biopsied under CT guidance.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**First Name (STitle) **]: Ten (10) mL PO BID (2 times a day).
You also had a biopsy looking for infection, and this was pending at the time of discharge.
