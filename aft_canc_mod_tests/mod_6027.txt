CXR showed possible LLL pneumonia.
CTA showed no evidence PE.
Given worsening renal status, pt was evaluated with V/Q scan which again showed no evidence of PE.
The following day, CT abdomen showed ilieus with no bowel obstruction and LLL pneumonia.
Sputum cultures returned positive on [**11-18**] for Klebsiella and the patient was noted to be febrile.
Repeat CT scan did not show e/o abscess or other intra-abdominal source.
On [**11-19**], WBC increased from 11.9-->22.4 and the patient was febrile.
Repeat CXR showed worsening LLL consolidation.
On [**11-24**], WBC count peaked at 35.1, sputum grew yeast, MRSA and klebsiella.

ECHO [**11-26**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**11-30**] - IMPRESSION: 1.
The location is ammenable for CT guided drainage.
CT Sinus [**11-20**] - IMPRESSION: 1.
CT chest [**12-5**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT chest [**12-9**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Abdomen: IMPRESSION: 1.
Sputum cultures there were ploymicrobial including klebsiella/yeast/MRSA implicating aspiration as a possible etiology.
Sputum cultures revealed MRSA and corynebacterium.
A CT torso was performed that showed an organizing intra-abdominal abscess with communication to the bowel.
Cultures of the drained fluid revealed [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 97334**] and the patient was placed on micafungin.
He did well following extubation although oxygen saturations remained in the 90-92% range (unclear baseline).
On [**12-11**] the patient underwent repeat abdominal CT scan that showed a small interval increase in size of the perihepatic collection and a decrease in size in other collection.
Plan was made for the patient to continue micafungin and meropenem to complete a 2 week course on [**2160-12-26**] and undergo repeat CT scan at that time.
In admission here his hematocrit was ~25.
No obvious bleeding source and hemolysis labs were negative.
Over the course of the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 153**] stay his hematocrit remained stable at 25-30.
Urinary retenetion - The patient reports having a history of urinary retention for which he sees a urologist.
Following foley removal here the patient failed to put out urine and a bladder scan revealed >600ml in the bladder.
Continued to have good urine output without the foley.
HL - Changed simvastatin 80mg to atorvastatin 40mg daily .
3) Follow-up on pending blood culture results.
4) Reccomend CT abd/pelvis to evaluate for itnerval change in fluid collections after completing antibiotic course on [**2160-12-26**] 5) Speach and swallow evaluation.
