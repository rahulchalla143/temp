CXR [**3-18**]: A single portable upright radiograph is available for review obtained at 2:10 p.m.
CTA chest/abd: 1.
EKG: afib, rate 67, poor r-wave progression, no significant ST changes   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 57 y/o M with PMH metastatic melanoma, prostate CA, HTN and anxiety who presents with profound acidosis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hepatic failure and septic shock, intubated and on pressors.
Had retrocardiac opacity on CXR concerning for PNA, also dirty UA concerning for GU source.
A second CVL (RIJ) was placed and CVP measured 16-18 indicating adequate fluid resuscitation.
Cultures were sent including blood, urine and sputum to look for source of infection.
Patient had been c/o RUQ pain, however CT abdomen did not show any acute infectious process or ischemic bowel.
Unfortunately his acidosis was so overwhelming that his pH was unable to be corrected above 6.9 and RR could not be increased further due to airway pressures and breath stacking.
The patient was also significantly coagulopathic on arrival with INR 14.2.
K in the ED with correction of his INR to 3.9.
The patient's blood pressure continued to decline and vasopressin was started without effect.
