ECHO [**2136-10-10**]: Conclusions Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Left ventricular systolic function is probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be excluded.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiogram may better assess for valvular vegetations.
CT HEAD [**2136-10-10**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Initial CT-head at [**Hospital1 18**] showed no obvious infarct.
Repeat CT-head [**10-10**] showed a large L MCA infarct with 4mm of midline shift.
Family meeting [**10-11**] and the outcome was for CMO status after extubation  # CARDS: Patient had episodes of rapid AF on [**10-10**] and was started on IV metoprolol and briefly (2 hours) required pressor support with neosynephrine although the lowest recorded SBP was 90.
Repeat CT-head [**10-10**] showed a large L MCA infarct with 4mm o midline shift.
