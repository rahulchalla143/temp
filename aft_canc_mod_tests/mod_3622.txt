The fluid is quite heterogeneous with large foci of higher density ([**Doctor Last Name **] 55-60) within it consistent with blood products.
As reported on the concurrent chest radiographs, in the span of one day, there has been reversal of the previously leftward mediastinal shift.
The post- contrast images demonstrate no area of active extravasation, specifically, related to either the bronchial arteries, or along the chest wall and the projected course of the intercostal vessels.
ECHO [**2151-3-26**] IMPRESSION: Small loculated pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
Upon arrival to the ED his blood results revealed an INR of 6.0.
A Chest CT was done and revealed heterogeneous, predominantly high-density fluid within the left pneumonectomy resection cavity, consistent with a prominent component of acute hemorrhage.
He was treated with 10 mg IV Vitamin K , 1 unit FFP and 1 unit of PRBC and 10 mg Decadron.
He transferred to the floor and continued to do well with systolic blood pressures in the 120-130's.
On HD #3 he was started on heparin with a goal PTT 50-60 and monitored for bleeding.
