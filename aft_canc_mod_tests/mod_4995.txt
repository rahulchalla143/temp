Pt initially presented to OSH on [**4-10**] with abdominal pain, distention, constipation (last BM [**4-6**]), increased belching.
At the referring institution, she had a CT scan with PO contrast which demonstrated small bowel pneumatosis.
Admission labs were also significant for Cr 1.8, AST 49, and ALT 30.
She was initially diagnosed with stage IIC ovarian cancer at the time of exploratory laparotomy on [**2118-7-19**].
CT scan showed no convincing areas of disease.
The patient underwent laparoscopic evaluation by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] where multiple tiny peritoneal implants were seen and biopsy was consistent with recurrent adenocarcinoma ovarian primary.

Pleural fluid [**5-2**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 64294**] is a 59yo woman with metastatic papillary serous ovarian CA who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with SBO.
She had exp laparotomy on [**4-12**] where a perforated transverse colon was found; a R extended hemicolectomy and end ileostomy was performed, with L colon no longer in continuity with GI tract.
Gram stain showed no organisms.
Given the appearance of the wound and persistent elevated EBC count, CT abdomen was performed to assess for abdominal fluid collection which revealed a small anterior fluid collection in the superior abdomen.
Follow up CT scans were performed to see progression of collection with gradual resolution noted on imaging.
Flagyl was stopped once 3 cdiff cultures were negative.
On [**2124-4-26**], patient reported severe dyspnea and tachycardia and a CTA chest was performed to rule out PE.
Scan was negative and patient's dyspnea was releived with nebulizer treatments and supplemental oxygen.
A similar episode occured on [**2124-5-1**], and a repeat CTA chest was performed in light of patient's high risk due to cancer, and immbolization.
Repeat scan was also negative.
On [**2124-5-2**], interventional pulmonology was consulted for therapeutic thoracentesis of left pleural effusion in hopes of improving patient's dyspnea.
Her dyspnea improved significantly after this, though she occasionally had episodes of dyspnea and tachycardia, presumably from anxiety.
Calorie count revealed inadequate calories intake.
