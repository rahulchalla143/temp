CT angiogram was positive for pulmonary embolism and pericardial effusion.
An echocardiogram was positive for tamponade, and the patient underwent pericardiocentesis which showed malignant cells.
Follow-up echocardiogram on [**2104-1-23**], showed slight diminution in the pericardial effusion.
He was sent to the Emergency Department where his vital signs were stable.
In the Emergency Department, the patient also had intermittent rapid atrial fibrillation up to a rate of 190 which broke spontaneously and the patient converted to normal sinus rhythm, however, he remained tachycardic.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 95.1, blood pressure 130/83, heart rate 140, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 100% on two liters.
His head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination reveals extraocular movements intact.
His chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 15.4, 70% polys, 5% bands, 19% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, hematocrit 32.7, platelets 112,000.
Sodium 139, potassium 5.5 (hemolyzed), chloride 100, bicarbonate 22, blood urea nitrogen 31, creatinine 1.9 (baseline 0.8 to 1.1), glucose 263.
INR 1.3.
Electrocardiogram - sinus tachycardia at 130 beats per minute with normal axis and intervals, 1.
[**Street Address(2) 2811**] depression in V5 and left ventricular hypertrophy, no strain pattern.
Lower extremity noninvasives reveal no flow, compressibility or augmentation of the left common femoral, superficial femoral, saphenous or popliteal veins consistent with extensive deep vein thrombosis.
Chest x-ray - evidence of right upper lobe resection, elevated right hemidiaphragm, no congestive heart failure or consolidations.
Pericardial effusion - A bedside echocardiogram showed a continued moderate effusion, slightly larger than the previous echocardiogram.
His rate was controlled with Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
Acute renal failure - The patient's creatinine rose to a peak of 3.0.
A renal ultrasound showed no extension of the clot to the renal veins.
