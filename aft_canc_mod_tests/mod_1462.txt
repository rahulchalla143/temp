History of Present Illness: 68 yo M with h/o MDS, thrombocythemia, HTN, COPD and recent GIB was admitted from NH for decreased HCT (HCT was at baseline 22) and leukocytosis.
GIB: He underwent colonscopy which showed blood in the colon, sigomid diverticulosis, but no clear source of the bleeding.
A SMA angiogram was significant for extravasation of contrast at the distal ileocolic branches, which was successfully embolized.
He received a total of 10 U pRBC and 10 U FFP while in the MICU.
He was discharged with a HCT of 22, stable.
RUQ US showed concern for cholecystitis.
He underwent cipro, flagyl, and unasyn and then underwent an ERCP in which a stone was removed from the biliary tree, a sphincterotomy was performed, and the CBD was noted to be dilated to 12 mm.
He was transfused 1 unit of PRBC on [**4-18**] to which his HCT did not respond (know to be very difficult crossmatch).
IVC gram done to assess clot burden and showed that there was clot above the filter and could extend into the hepatic vein entry.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring after this procedure.
He was continued with an infusion of TPA overnight that was infused through a catheter extending the length of the clot and then was taken back to the IR suite on [**4-20**] and imaging showed that the clot had broken up a little.
DVT RLE ([**2105**]) hospitalized 2.
Aortic Regurg ([**7-/2101**]) LVEF 60-65% 3.
2+ DP pulses bilaterally Neuro - Alert and oriented x 3 Skin - No rash   Pertinent Results: Micro: [**2-19**] bcx positive for coag neg staph cdiff neg x1 .
TPA was infused overnight on several occasions but repeat venogram still showed substantial clot.
On last discharge his pulse ox on room air was 88% and on 2L was 97%.
CXR with small b/l pleural effusions and overload and LL atelectasis.
His breathing seemed to improve with diuresis (was given 20IV lasix daily for approx a week) and he required less oxygen.
He did not aspirate on a formal speech and swallow eval, but given these episodes were intermittent he was placed on a thickened liquid diet (soft solid) diet with aspiration precautions.
#) Bacteremia: with coag neg strep - 2/4 bottles were positive from [**4-17**].
TTE and TEE were negative for vegetations.
However, his sputum production increased near the end of the hospitalization and CXR on [**5-3**] demonstrated new LLL pneumonia.
#) Cholethiasis: RUQ ultrasound showed no definite evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Recently had severe GIB which required an SMA angiogram which showed bleeding at the distal ileocolic branches, which underwent successful embolization.
Baseline Hct is 21-22.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24535**] [**Name (STitle) **], heme/onc fellow follows the pt closely and states pt has antibodies to E and F Antigens so his blood transfusions should be arranged with this in mind.
On admission plt count was initially normal and even on the low side so hydrea and anagrelide were stopped.
Hydrea restarted [**4-27**] when plt count began to rise again and subsequently anagrelide was started as well.
