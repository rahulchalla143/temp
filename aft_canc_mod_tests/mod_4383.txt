Echocardiogram [**11-11**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to hypokinesis of the midventricular segments and akinesis of the apex.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CARDIAC CATH:  [**2196-11-9**] Left ventriculography: 1+ mitral regurgitation, LVEF=40%, extensive area of anteroapical and inferoapical akinesis LMCA: LAD: 30% mid LCx: no significant disease RCA: 40% mid Most consistent with Takotsubo syndrome.
Brief Hospital Course: # CORONARIES: Cardiac catheterization did not show significant coronary artery disease.
Venogram during catheterization showed characteristic apical ballooning, consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
EF 40%.
Surgery was consulted--they think the patient can have her staples removed 7-10 days after her operation (Day 10=[**2196-11-13**]).
Surgery Appointment: **to be scheduled** for [**11-14**], [**11-15**] or [**11-16**] for wound assessment and JP drain removal.
