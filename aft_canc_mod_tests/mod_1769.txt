Admission Date:  [**2145-6-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-7-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2112-9-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Brain mass compressing brain stem  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -Diagnostic cerebral angiogram with embolization -Left sided craniotomy with placement of EVD catheter -Left suboccipital craniotomy for mass resection   History of Present Illness: 32 year old woman with past medical history significant for nonhodgkins lymphoma and basal cell carcinoma who presents after being referred by her PCP after an MRI scan showed a brain lesion.
She had been followed by her PCP for these symptoms and after her last visit on [**4-23**] it was felt that an MRI to assess for any intracranial pathology that was contributing to her symptoms was warranted.
She had her MRI which showed a dural based lesion compressing the pons.
MRI [**6-23**] postop: IMPRESSION: 1.
MRI head +/- contrast [**7-1**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head [**7-1**]: Status post resection of a left petroclival extra-axial mass lesion, with expected post-surgical changes including moderate amount of pneumocephalus and a small extraaxial fluid collection in the left posterior cranial fossa and middle cranial fossa.
Chest Xray [**7-1**]: The ET tube tip is 6.5 cm above the carina.
MRI Brain postop [**7-2**]: New acute infarcts in the left thalamus, left internal capsule, left posterolateral pons/midbrain junction, left middle cerebellar peduncle, and left cerebellar hemisphere.
An extra-axial collection at the left cerebellopontine angle is not unexpected status post surgery.
Lower Extremity venous dopplers [**7-2**]: Occlusive thrombus within the left posterior tibial veins.
[**7-3**]: CT Head 1.
CT Head [**2145-7-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head [**2145-7-8**]: IMPRESSION: No significant interval change.
LENIS [**2145-7-9**]:  CONCLUSION: No evidence of DVT in right or left lower extremity  CXR [**2145-7-9**]  In comparison with the study of [**7-9**], there is decreasing opacification at the right base with a small residual.
Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no evidence of vascular congestion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 174**] was admitted electively for diagnostic cerebral angiogram with embolization by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **].
She underwent MRI scan of the Brain a few hours psot-oepratively to assess teh resection.
The MRI showed approximately 30% of the lesion had been resected.
She remeianed hemodynamically stable into [**6-25**] and her exam was stable as well.
Immediate postoperative head CT demonstrated no acute blood with minimal pneumocephalus.
On [**7-2**] the patient was febrile to 101.6 and a fever workup was initiated with blood, urine and sputum cultures.
CSF was sent for gram stain and culture.
Chest Xray demonstrated rightsided consolidation and lower lobe collapse and so she was started on the VAP protocol.
Postoperative MRI demonstrated new infarcts within the left thalamus and internal capsule.
An attempt was made to wean her ventricular drain on [**7-3**] which was not tolerated.
On 5.30 she was extubated, following commands on the left and her EOM's were much less restricted on the Right side.
Repeat LENI's were performed revealing a 5mm x 10mm clot in the lesser saphenous vein and resolution of the previous clot.
A head CT was performed for baseline evaluation prior to EVD clamp.
Her EVD was clamped after a stable Head CT. On [**7-8**] a head CT was done which showed no changed and her EVD was discontinued.
A trach and PEG was discussed, but no decision was made.
