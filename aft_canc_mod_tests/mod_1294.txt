Blood work was performed the following day which showed a WBC of 1.8,  HCT 27, Plt 107; ANC 100; 2% blasts.
She went to her local ED the following day, and was again noted to be pancytopenic with WBC 2.3 ANC 100, hct 23, plt 84.
A chest CT was performed to evaluate her cough and fevers and noted a consolidative opacity at the lingula of the left upper lobe consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
Influenza A/B testing was performed and was negative.
Multiple foot surgeries and an ankle fusion done for post-polio syndrome 9.
Sinus cyst removed, which was benign  <b><i>ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:</i></b> Ms. [**Known lastname 26241**] was diagnosed in [**7-/2161**] after seeing a left sided mass on a mammogram on [**2161-8-11**].
An ultrasound confirmed that the mass was solid, and an U/S guided biopsy found a 3.7 cm grade 3 infiltrating left ductal cancer with clean lymph nodes, ER positive, HER-2/neu negative, and negative LVI.
Her mammogram in [**2166-7-26**] was normal.

STUDIES: ======== CT chest ([**2166-12-31**] at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital) 1. consolidative opacity at the lingula of the left upper lobe consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2166-12-31**] IMPRESSION: In comparison to [**2164-10-15**], there is a newly appeared 3.2 cm big mass at the upper aspect of the left hilus.
Undelayed followup with CT or PET/CT should be performed.
Of these, 40% of the gated cells express immature antigens CD34, HLADR along with myeloid associated antigens CD117, CD33 and monocytic antigens CD4 (dim), CD11c and CD64.
Within this CD45 dim blast region, there is a more mature myelomonocytic population which similarly expresses CD33, CD14, CD4(dim), CD64, CD11c  but is CD34-negative, CD117-negative and additionally co-expresses CD13, CD14 and CD15.
T-cells comprise approximately 71% of lymphoid-gated events, express mature lineage antigens, and have a normal helper-cytotoxic ratio of 1.3 (usual range in blood 0.7-3.0).
BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY [**2167-1-1**] DIAGNOSIS: Acute myelogenous leukemia with monocyte differentiation, see note.
There is some background dyspoiesis noted in the scant residual hematopoiesis including occasional hypogranular neutrophils; the possibility that this acute leukemia arose from an underlying myelodysplastic syndrome cannot be entirely excluded.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2167-1-2**] IMPRESSION: No complication of insertion of the right central venous catheter.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2167-1-2**] IMPRESSION: 1.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2167-1-2**] The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2167-1-4**] Cardiac size is top normal.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2167-1-5**] Most extensive region of consolidation, in the left upper lobe is stable, projecting lateral to the left hilus.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2167-1-6**] IMPRESSION: No significant change in mild pulmonary congestion.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2167-1-8**] CHEST, AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE: Comparison is made to two days earlier.
[**2167-1-20**] CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
A focal consolidation in the left upper lobe which had been prominent on the initial CT has also continued to resolve.
On the other hand, diffuse mixed ground glass and consolidative opacities, which are predominantly peripheral and bronchovascular in distribution, are more extensive than on the most recent CT from [**2163-1-8**].
[**2167-1-27**] CT CHEST FINDINGS: Over a period of at least seven days there has been a significant worsening of the ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and a new pleural effusion.
Although the examination is not tailored for the evaluation of the abdominal structures yet there is persistent stranding around the left kidney; however, this is difficult to interpret today because of the motion at the lung bases.
Further extensive and rapid increase in the ground-glass opacities, consolidation and recurrence of a small pleural effusion.
[**2167-1-28**] CT HEAD FINDINGS: There is no evidence for intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci maintain a normal configuration.
MRI is more sensitive for the evaluation of acute brain ischemia.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-1-2**], left ventricular systolic function is slightly less vigorous, but remains in the normal range.
Blood culture [**2-19**]: STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
PICC line culture [**2-21**]: STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE CLINDAMYCIN-----------<=0.25 S ERYTHROMYCIN----------<=0.25 S GENTAMICIN------------ <=0.5 S LEVOFLOXACIN----------   =>8 R OXACILLIN-------------   =>4 R PENICILLIN G---------- =>0.5 R RIFAMPIN-------------- <=0.5 S TETRACYCLINE----------     2 S VANCOMYCIN------------     2 S .
surveillence blood cultures negative.
Otherwise, the CT examination is unchanged.
[**2167-2-18**]: CT sinus: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2-23**]: MRI head IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2-24**]: ECHO (to r/o vegetations) The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-1-27**], no change.
An underlying, generalized, predominantly axonal polyneuropathy is also likely present.
Review of peripheral smear showed >34% blasts.
She was started on continuous IVFs, allopurinol prophylaxis, and DIC and TLS labs were monitored frequently.
She had a bone marrow biopsy that revealed AML.
Pre-chemotherapy echo was obtained.
Day 14 bone marrow was performed on [**1-19**] demonstrating a markedly hypocellular bone marrow (consistent with chemo-ablative therapy) with increased interstitial blasts, comprising approximately 7% of aspirate differential.
In addition, flow cytometric studies showed a small population of immature cells with an aberrant phenotype.
At some point in the future, a bone marrow biopsy may be completed for further information, but this would be pursued once the patient is more stable.
Her cell counts all were coming up and stable at time of discharge.
# Febrile Neutropenia/Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: On admission, she was febrile to Tmax 101.7 with O2 sats of 96% on RA.
[**Hospital1 18**] CXR and OSH CT showed a LUL infiltrate.
CT chest on [**1-2**] showed progression of her LUL infiltrate compared to the OSH CT, concerning for angioinvasive fungal infection.
Mycolytic blood cultures and fungal markers were sent that remained negative.
CT chest on [**1-8**] revealed decreased LUL opacity but more tree-and-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, likely secondary to pulmonary edema (given that the patient had gained >15 pounds while on continuous fluids).
She initially refused repeat bronchoscopy with BAL as she did not want to go through the procedure again.
Multiple induced sputum cultures were sent but remained negative.
Repeat Chest CT on [**1-27**] demonstrated extensive and rapid increase in the ground-glass opacities, consolidation and recurrence of a small pleural effusion.
Following bronchoscopy the patient developed an 8L O2 requirement.
All culture data from BAL remained negative.
BAL samples remained negative, urine was positive for yeast despite treamtent with voriconazole.
Chest CT revealed a cavitating lesion in left upper lobe where a formerly solid nodule had appeared.
Vasculitis work-up was negative.
She remained febrile with unknown origin, with temperatures as high as 102. all cultures remained negative.
Her blood culture at that time came back positive for coag negative staph.
All her lines were reset, and her picc tip came back positive for the same bacteria.
A chest x-ray was checked prior to discharge to assess for any changes and showed no evidence of any acute cardiopulmonary process, but persistence of pre-existing opacities.
# Acute renal failure (ARF) - As the patient's pulmonary status worsened she developed ARF with a rise in serum creatinine from 1.1 on [**1-22**] to 3.4 on [**1-27**].
A stat CT Head was performed and demonstrated no evidence of bleed.
She had an MRI of head and cervical spine, which was normal.
EMG was most consistent with a generalized, severe myopathy with prominent denervating features, as can be seen in critical illness myopathy, with a likely underlying, generalized, predominantly axonal polyneuropathy.
Speech and swallow followed the patient, and she will benefit from a swallowing study in the near future to evaluate whether she can safely eat, as her mental status has improved and she feels hungry.
