He had a planning CT scan at that time which showed a mass vs. a clot in the right bronchus intermedius.
Patient's oxygenation saturations stable on floor in high 80s to low 90s on 3 L nasal canula.
In the early morning of [**2140-12-30**] he suffered an acute STEMI with 12 lead EKG revealing ST elevations in II, III and aVF.
He received atropine x 1 and then went into atrial fibrillation with RVR with rates in the 190s to 200s for which he received lopressor 5 IV x 3 and diltiazem 5 IV x 2 and then a diltiazem drip.
His CK MB peaked at 170 and his MB-I at 22.4.
Blood gas in the morning was 7.504/22.7/42.5 on 100% NRB.
Blood pressures post intubation were in the 70s systolic which improved to mid 80s with fluid boluses.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for interventional pulmonology evaluation and radiation therapy.

Admission CXR [**2141-1-1**](wet read):ETT is situated 6 cm above the carina.
MRI OF THE BRAIN: There is a 3-mm enhancing lesion within the right frontal lobe cortex versus in a leptomeningeal location within a sulcus without surrounding edema.
ECHO Conclusions Subcostal views only obtained.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
CT chest: FINDINGS: There is a heterogeneous enhancing mass with significant necrotic component in the right infrahilar region measuring 4.3 x 4.8 cm representing the primary lung cancer.
