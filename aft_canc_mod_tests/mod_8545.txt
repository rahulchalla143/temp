Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-12-28**], the severity of mitral regurgitation is now reduced.
CT Chest: IMPRESSION: 1.
Limited study due to artifact from the arm and left hip.
CT Abdomen: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT Head: IMPRESSION: 1.
Exam limited by motion.
Partial opacification of the sphenoid sinus and total opacification of the mastoid air cells which was also demonstrated on the CT scan of [**2111-9-20**].
CT ABDOMEN: There is a moderate-to-large left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion with associated basilar atelectasis.
Injection of contrast reveals pooling of contrast within the mesentery and apparently extraluminal.
CT PELVIS: Small bowel loops are not dilated.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.

THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.
Single portable chest radiograph with comparison to examination from one day ago shows increase in the size of the left-sided loculated effusion.
Baseline blood pressure per OMR records were above 100s.
During this admission, patient's BP ranged from 80-130, with SBP often running around 80 at night.
CT Head showed stable sinus findings and stable pontine abscess.
CT abdomen showed small ascites, but no retroperitoneal bleed.
Pt had pancreatitis with elevated amylase/lipase, and was treated with IVF, NPO, analgesia, but Hct was stable.
Her ARF resolved after 2 weeks, and her creatinine returned to her baseline of 1.2.
Creatinine was monitored during the stay as she was on lasix drip, see below.
Patient's creatinine was stable, and remained around baseline.
Starting [**2112-1-16**] her creatinine started to increase and lasix gtt was held.
Guaiac was negative x 3, hemolysis labs were negative, pt was taking Fe and folic acid.
Iron studies showed anemia of chronic disease.
She had one episode of hct <20, hemolysis labs were negative, anca negative and there was no clear source.
##  Atrial Fibrillation: Metoprolol and Diltiazem did not work well for patient's AFIB, because her BP would decrease below 80.
Her HR was better controlled thereafter.
Ultrasound x 2 showed choroidal detachment as [**Street Address(1) 33553**].
At [**Hospital1 336**], vitreous culture showed P. acnes, was injected intravitreally with vanc/ceftazidime.
Contact at [**Hospital1 18**] is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (retina).
Cytology from R pleural fluid had shown cells suspicious for malignancy, but pleural fluid sent at [**Hospital1 **] did not show malignant cells.
##  Adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy: Echo during last admission show EF60% with 3+ MR and 4+ TR.
Echo during this admission showed an improved MR to 2+.
##  Communication: HCP (brother) [**Name (NI) 429**] [**Name (NI) 33962**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 100992**])  On [**1-14**] /[**2111**]  percutaneos G tube was attempted and it was felt not to be optimal procedure for this reason it was further studied and found to have a leak for this reason several days it was observed by the IR and medical ICU team, following that the tube and then manipulated and interrogated and found to have a leak again on [**1-18**], on [**1-22**] a CT scan was ordered and the results were called to the team that the G-tube was freely out in the peritoneum.
