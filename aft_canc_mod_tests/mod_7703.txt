He had a CT abdomen at this time which showed enlarged spleen, showing fluid and air, consistent with liquefaction of the spleen, and his effusions were thought to be [**1-26**] splenic necrosis, his fluid analysis at this time was not concerning following the tap.
Surgery at [**Hospital3 **] again tapped his pleural effusion lateral and just inferior to the left scapula, removing 1500cc of fluid with CXR unchanged after tap.
The fluid this time was frankly bloody and opaque with WBC 25K, pH 6.9, Gram stain negative.
Also with post-procedure pain and fever to 101.7, peripheral WBC count of 18,000.
He was started on tigecycline (to cover for MRSA, GNR, anaerobes) and he had a CT of the abdomen with contrast, which showed a smaller spleen compared to 2 weeks ago from 19cm x 14cm to 13.9cm x 10.7cm.
Pertinent labs at [**Hospital3 **]: WBC 18, Hgb 11.9, Hct 36.6, Plt 972, ABG with pH 7.44, PCO2 of 37, PO2 of 70 and HCO3 of 25.3 .
On reaching the floor, temperature was 101, BP 120/80 , HR 127, RR 27, SpO2 97% on RA.
Biopsy in [**2114**] showed fatty change, grade 1 portal inflammation and "focally increased" "portal fibrosis" (Stage 0-1).

Further evaluation by repeat thoracentesis and consideration of CTA is recommended, as well as correlation with hematocrit level.
[**2118-12-23**] Cardiac echo : Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

# Large left sided pleural effusion with tracheal deviation: as seen on CXR done at [**Hospital3 **] (LGH) and at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient has large left sided pleural effusion, increasing despite 1.5L tap [**2118-12-21**] at LGH.
Interventional pulmonology placed a chest tube on [**12-24**] and drained approximately 2L of fluid from pleural space (fluid had pH 6.78, and was exudative in nature based on Light's criteria, PMNs on gram stain, culture pending).
Repeat CXR showed interval decrease in pleural effusion with no post-procedure pneumothorax.
Cultures are pending from this fluid collection.
At time of transfer to floor his chest tube was in place and draining sanguinous fluid, splenic catheter was also in place draining serosanguinous fluid.
On [**12-26**] and the again on [**12-28**] the cultures of the pleural fluid grew for Lactobacillus.
The tube was removed on [**2119-1-3**] and his chest xray showed a markedly decreased effusion.
Blood cultures from LGH showed no growth and his blood cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] are also negative.
His Zosyn was stopped on [**2119-1-4**] and PCN G was started.
On CT abdomen done [**12-23**] at OSH, the patient's pericardial effusion was read as being "small."
To rule this possibility out TTE was obtained that showed overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Given this finding no further workup will be pursued.
A repeat CT torsos, pericardial effusion was not notable.
