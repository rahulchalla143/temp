On arrival to OSH, initial VS were BP 169/53 HR 88 RR 32 and initial ABG revealed respiratory acidosis with PCO2 in 80s.
CXR was suggestive of pneumonia and he was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidime there.
However because there were no available ICU beds, patient was tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
VS prior to admission were BP 105/47 HR 62 RR 24 SpO2 97% on BiPAP (FiO2 60%).

CXR [**3-13**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
CXR [**3-14**]: 1.
The lungs are somewhat hyperinflated with flattened diaphragms, which could reflect an underlying component of emphysema.
EKG [**3-16**]: Sinus rhythm.
T wave abnormalities in lead aVF are less prominent  CXR [**3-16**]: IMPRESSION: Persistent diffuse interstitial abnormality, most prominent in the right lung base demonstrates interval regression from [**2117-3-14**].
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
