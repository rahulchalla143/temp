You had a low blood pressure and fast heart rate in the ED, and for this reason you were initially admitted to the ICU.
An endoscopic procedure showed that you had changes in your stomach from high blood pressure that may have led to your bleeding episode- there was no active bleeding during the procedure, and no intervention was done.
You did well, your blood count improved after three blood transfusions, and you were transferred to the floor.
