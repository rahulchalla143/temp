In the ED, his initial vitals were T 98.4, BP 115/56, HR 118, Sat 96% on room air.
NG lavage revealed approx 800cc of dark brown material, guiac +.
A hematocrit was 29 (baseline 31 last week).
Pt's Hct went from 29.4 -> 25.7, and was therefore transfused 1 unit of pRBC, which bumped Hct appropriately to 28.3.

KUB ([**2141-3-11**]): Moderately dilated loops of small bowel, with presence of air and stool in the colon, gas pattern worrisome for ileus.
CXR ([**2141-3-11**]): No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
ECG ([**2141-3-11**]): sinus tachycardia at 118 bpm; normal axis, normal intervals; LVH; ST-T wave depression in I, aVL, V3-V6 (old) .
[**3-13**] CT Abd/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**3-27**] CT abd pelvis: Extensive small bowel obstruction with extensive pneumatosis and air within the mesenteric vein.
## Acute blood loss anemia: likely due to malfunction of duodenal stent - q6h Hcts; transfuse for evidence of active bleeding - GI input appreciated; may require stent re-placement - active T&S; 2 large-bore PIVs - [**Hospital1 **] IV ppi - consent for blood transfusion - prn ondansetron for nausea - hold Lasix, spironolactone for now; give short-acting, reduced-dose beta-blockade .
## Possible SBO: per patient, last BM was yesterday; KUB shows evidence of possible ileus vs early SBO - NGT in place right now (clamped) - keep NPO for now and monitor serial abdominal exams .
## Tachycardia: unclear if this is true volume depletion given his pulmonary rales and history of SVT - ECG appears to show sinus tachycardia - will give reduced-dose beta-blockade for now and consider small NS boluses in addition to maintenance IVFs - check digoxin level .
## Systolic CHF (LVEF 45% in [**11/2139**]): has mild pulmonary rales on exam, though mucous membranes are slightly dry - hold Lasix and spironolactone for now, but consider resuming if Hct remains stable - reduced-dose beta-blockade as above .
With onset of feculent vomiting s/p ERCP, NGT was replaced to cont suction and patient was sent down for stat CT abd/pelvis which confirmed an SBO distal the stent.
Plan to: - NPO, IVF titrate to UOP >50cc/hr - NGT to continuous suction - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] recs - slightly improved on [**3-15**] w/ conservative management, still plan for OR on [**3-16**] per surgery- will readdress on the day of planned surgery - ondansetron PRN .
Plan to: - management of duodenal stent as above - further oncologic care per primary team .
ECG on admission shows sinus tachy.
# Systolic CHF (LVEF 45% in [**11/2139**]): has mild pulmonary rales on exam, though mucous membranes are slightly dry.
He had a CT scan obtained of his abdomen, which showed a bowel obstruction (see above for report).
He was taken to the OR on [**3-16**] for his procedures: 1.
His labs did not indicate hemorrhage.
His wound (midline incision) showed evidence of breakdown, with approximately [**2-12**] staples pulling apart.
On [**3-25**], he developed an arrythmia (SVT/AFib) with a heart rate in the 130's range.
His EKG was unremarkable and his enzymes remained unremarkable per Cardiology.
His CXR was also unremarkable and Mr [**Known lastname 16268**] [**Last Name (Titles) 15797**] chest pain or other symptoms during this period.
His BP was stable, and heart rate in the 130-140 range (SVT/ST).
The following morning ([**3-27**]), he had a CT abdomen which showed extensive pneumatosis; he was started on broadspectrum antibiotics and IV fluids.
On this day, his white count was elevated to 42,000 (it would later peak at 60,000).
Throughout this 24 hour period, his blood pressure remained stable (systolic between 100-130's), but his heart rate remained in the 130-140 range, going back and forth between sinus tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia.
SBP remained stable.
His heart rate remained in the 130's (ST/SVT).
His urine output remained adequate; his abdomen remained distended and his pain was well controlled.
All questions were answered and his expectations and desires were met.
