Appropriate evaluation and potential treatment are recommended.

HCT nadir at 18, received total of 2 units of FFP and 2 units of PRBCS (last transfusion on [**10-17**]).
HCT stablized at 29-31.
An endoclip was placed with partial hemostasis.
Surgical intervention was planned at this point and the patient had an echocardiogram and a cardiology consultation for pre-operative risk stratification.
On POD1 his Hct was found to be 24.9 from a preoperative level of 30.
Therefore he was transfused 1U of PRBC with adequate response (post-transfusion Hct 29.7).
His foley was flushed as needed throughout the remainder of his stay and the pt's urine remained clear.
Heme/Onc followed the patient throughout his stay for his hemophilia C and Factor [**Doctor First Name 81**] deficiency, they recommended no anticoagulation and Amicar +/- FFP if bleeding reccured.
