CT of the abdomen and pelvis at [**Hospital3 **] found bilateral hydronephrosis, increased on left and new on right with new bilateral nephrolithiasis compared to CT [**2169-7-31**].
He then received a L occipital craniotomy at [**Hospital1 18**] without complication on [**10-6**] and post-op CT head was stable.
Repeat Head CT showed a predominantly low fluid density within the subdural spaces bilaterally with areas of higher density again noted, suggestive of more acute bleeding.
On [**10-8**] dilantin level was 12.8 which corrected to approx.
[**10-12**] CXR showed CHF, the patient was given lasix- Lasix 20x1.
He improved with upright positioning and tube feeds were stopped; stat CXR showed worsening edema, though cannot r/o pneumonia R side.
T spike 101.3 axillary and cultures were sent.
His creatinine increased from 1.6-->2.9.
He underwent XRT with Dr.[**Name (NI) 14072**], developed PSA recurrence in [**2168**] to 12.7 from 2.7 the year prior.

[**2169-10-6**]: TTE: LVEF 50%, Inferior Hypokinesis, Mild MR CT [**10-5**]: L acute SDH max thickness 2.7cm, 3mm MLS.
No OSH CT available for comparison.
OSH CT report max thickness 2.3cm.
[**2169-10-7**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: As before, patient is status post left parietal craniectomy and evacuation of the left subdural space.
Atherosclerotic calcifications of carotid and vertebral arteries bilaterally are again noted.
Blood in the lateral ventricles as before.
FINDINGS: The examination was limited due to the patient's inability to cooperate.
The right kidney measures 10.7 cm and the left kidney measures about 12.6 cm.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral persistent hydronephrosis which appears unchanged from the prior exam.
[**2169-10-14**] HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST: Comparison was made to the prior head CT dated [**2169-10-7**].
The pneumocephalus seen on prior study has near completely resolved.
[**2169-10-15**] CXR COMPARISON: [**2169-10-13**].
Apparent focal opacity in left lower lung likely represents confluence of inferior scapular border and adjacent rib, but attention to this area on a followup radiograph would be helpful to exclude a focal parenchymal abnormality in this region.
EEG [**10-18**]: Abnormal EEG due to the persistent left parasagittal slowing and due to the bursts of generalized slowing.
Abdominal ultrasound [**10-18**]: 1.
Further imaging is recommended either by cystoscopy or pelvic MRI.
Renal US showed moderate hydronephrosis with bilateral stents placed [**7-29**](known bilateral hydronephrosis).
Originally Cr had improved from 3.9 to 2.3 with hydration as a component of the ARF was thought to be prerenal; however, the creatinine began to rise again and the worsening renal function was likely obstructive in etiology representing advancing prostate cancer.
UTI: UA was suggestive of UTI and urine cultures grew enterococcus sensitive to amoxicillin and pan-sensitive to all antibiotics on culture and sensitivities.
On exam, he showed decreased motor strength and repeat CT head showed overall unchanged appearance of the subdural hematoma post evacuation.
SDH s/p L occiptal craniotomy: The patient was continued on seizure prophylaxis with dilantin.
He was found to have a low dilantin level, re-loaded, and then dilantin levels were closely monitored.
At OSH prior to transfer, the patient was found to have an elevated troponin and CK-MB X1.
EKG showed RBBB with lateral ST depressions (old from [**July 2169**]).
Echo at OSH had shown posterior, anterior wall HK, EF 40-45%.
At [**Hospital1 18**], echo to confirm WMA and EF for prognostic reasons showed inferobasal hypokinesis and an EF of 50%.
His HCTZ was held and his electrolytes monitored; he improved with free water flushes.
It is important that his sodium and potassium be monitored at least every three days until he is stable on his tube feeds.
# Elevated transaminases:  patient noted to have AST and ALT increase to 200s; elevated alk phos to 600s.
Abdominal ultrasound negative.
