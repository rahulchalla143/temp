Compared to the previous tracing of [**2128-11-3**] no significant change  Radiology [**2129-4-16**] Chest CT: Dense multifocal opacities are seen within the right lung and left lung base consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
[**2129-4-16**] RUQ U/S: Limited evaluation of the right upper quadrant demonstrates a liver with normal echogenicity without focal lesion.
[**2129-4-17**] MRI of head with and without contrast: There is opacification of the mastoid sinus air cells as well as scattered areas of mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses.
[**2129-4-18**] transthoracic echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**2129-4-20**] CT Neck: No fluid collections are identified within the neck.
[**2129-4-23**] CXR PA/lat: PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained [**2129-4-23**] at 13:42 hours and compared with the prior radiograph of [**2129-4-21**].
His ventilation was managed per ARDS-NET protocol and he was extubated on [**2129-4-18**] and transferred to the general medical floor on [**2129-4-21**].
A neurology consult was obtained, and he underwent a repeat LP with negative cultures and negative HSV PCR.
An MRI of his head did not reveal an acute abnormality (see results section).
3) Transaminitis: The patient underwent a right upper quadrant ultrasound which was unremarkable (with the exception of stones).
Hepatitis B and C panels were negative.
His transaminitis, which resolved over the course of his hospital stay, may have been due to mild shock liver in the setting of sepsis.
On his chest and neck CT, the left lobe of the thyroid was noted to be enlarged, measuring 3.0 x 3.5 cm.
7) Lymphadenopathy: The patient's chest CT revealed prominent mediastinal and left axillary lymph nodes (see results section).
This should continue to be monitored as an outpatient.
