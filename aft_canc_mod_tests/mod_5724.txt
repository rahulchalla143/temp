The primary care physician who took [**Name Initial (PRE) **] chest X-ray, which showed a lung mass and right pleural effusion.
The day of presentation the patient presented to [**Hospital1 **] for CT and MRI for further work-up.
She had WBC of 17 and Ca of 15.
Her imaging showed diffuse metastatic disease with invasion of spinal cord.
She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for an ortho spine consult.
At [**Hospital1 18**], initial vitals were: T 98.3, HR 114, BP 84/40, RR 18, SaO2 96% 3L NC.
Ortho Spine was consulted and evaluated the patient (please see ortho spine note) and believe the patient needs oncologic workup with multipl more imaging studies.
Right scapular outline is poorly defined, correlating with CT finding of osseaous lesion (see CT report).
ASSESSMENT FOR CORD COMPRESSION WITH THORACIC SPINE MRI IS RECOMMENDED.
CT HEAD: 1.
FURTHER EVALUATION WITH A BONE SCAN [**Month (only) **] BE CONSIDERED.
MRI Spine: Widely disseminated, likely metastatic neoplastic disease, with the largest lesion being at T1, and involving the posterior elements.
The lung mass may be in the right infrahilar region and/or right mid-to-lower lung underlying the area of opacity.
[**2110-1-23**] CT head: 1.
Contrast-enhanced MRI is suggeted for further evaluation.
