He was taken to the catheterization laboratory and right heart catheterization revealed no effusion, normal right heart pressures.
On his first day of admission, he dropped his hematocrit from 35 to 17 and his stool was guaiac positive.
In terms of his GI bleed after one or two blood transfusions, hematocrit stabilized, and the decision was made for no intervention.
