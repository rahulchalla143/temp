He reports that his PSA post radiation was 0.3.
His PSA started to climb 1004 and reached 2.2 in 05/  05.
He reports he multiple negative CT scans and bone scans in the past.
Most recently he had a bone scan in [**4-12**], which showed increased tracer activity in L5-S1 region, likely representing degenerative changes.
CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis [**4-12**], shows  a infrarenal aortic aneurysm, measuring 4.2 x 4.8 cm, asymmetric  inferior bladder wall thickening, and multiple small bilateral pulmonary nodules, the largest measuring 5 mm in the right middle lobe.

AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: Comparison is made to [**2198-7-1**] and a chest CT scan from [**2198-4-27**].
Cardiac size is at the upper limits of normal.
The patient has known nodules on CT scan.
Further evaluation with chest CT scanning is recommended.
CXR - [**2198-7-1**]  There has been interval removal of the right IJ line.
CXR - [**2198-6-22**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the previous examination of the same date, the pulmonary artery catheter is again seen, now terminating within the right pulmonary artery and entering via a right internal jugular approach.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 19000**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a cystoprostatectomy on [**2198-6-19**] (please see dictated operative report for details) without adverse events.
It was noted by surgeons that urine output was low throughout the procedure.
Estimated blood loss was 2,500cc.
His urine output was variable with outputs 28-145cc per hour and a total of 813 by midnight on operative day.
On post-operative day 1 by 0600, his urine output progressively decreased to a point where he was making < 5 cc per hour.
CT studies were obtained on [**6-21**] and revealed: 1.
Urinalysis was consistent with acute tubular nephritis with aneuria, and creatinine continued to rise.
His creatinine and BUN peaked at 6.4/49 respectively on post operative day 2.
At that point renal function began to return and patient began to autodiurese with urine outputs in 3,000-4,000cc range per 24 hours.
Blood, urine, sputum cultures were obtained and sputum culture showed pseudomonas aureginosa presence.
His BUN and creatinine progressively normalized, as did the acidemia.
With significan autodiuresis, patient's sodium began to rise and free water repletion was begun.
His pulmoary exam improved.
