PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile with a temperature of 98.1, heartrate 105, blood pressure 110/76, respiratory rate 26, and oxygen saturation 88% on room air, increasing to 93% on 3 liters by nasal cannula.
Head and neck examination reveals pupils equal, round and reactive to light, moist mucous membranes, mildly elevated jugulovenous distension.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart examination revealed tachycardia with a regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdominal examination revealed positive bowel sounds, no distention or tenderness and no guarding.
Neurologically, the examination was nonfocal and cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact.
LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count was within normal limits.
Panel 7 was significant for BUN of 16, creatinine 1.0, and a glucose of 309.
Liver function tests were within normal limits.
A chest x-ray revealed no evidence of pneumonia, subsegmental atelectasis at the left costophrenic angle, and a mass in the left lower lobe, unchanged from prior examinations.
A computerized tomography scan of the chest revealed the development of an extensive bilateral pulmonary embolus involving the superior and inferior left pulmonary arteries as well as the inferior right pulmonary artery.
The head computerized tomography scan was performed and showed no evidence of any intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhages or mass lesions.
A transesophageal echocardiogram showed a markedly dilated right ventricular cavity, with preserved left ventricular systolic function.
The course was complicated by pleural effusions and a pneumonia, which made extubation difficult.
Thoracentesis of the pleural effusion revealed an exudate consistent with a parapneumonic effusion.
On [**2155-10-26**] the patient self-extubated and was able to maintain oxygen saturations greater than 93% on a 100% nonrebreather mask.
Following transfer to the [**Hospital1 **], the patient continued to improve his oxygen saturations and required 3 liters at the time of this dictation.
Serial chest x-rays revealed improvement in the congestive heart failure as well as the left lower lobe pneumonia.
Status post intubation, the patient required intravenous pressors to maintain blood pressures as previously noted.
Hematology - Anticoagulation was maintained with heparin, and the patient was switched to oral Coumadin with therapeutic INR maintained for three days prior to discontinuation of heparin.
Culture data showed Escherichia coli that was pansensitive to antibiotics, and the patient improved while on Ceftriaxone.
Renal - As the patient was aggressively diuresed, an increase in BUN to creatinine ratio developed.
Lasix was used to continue diuresis and his creatinine did not increase above 1.0 at any time.
His narcotic and sedative medications were restricted, and psychiatric evaluation found the patient to be incompetent to make medical decisions.
