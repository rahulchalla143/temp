He had a CT scan,which shows no evidence of nodal disease.
He had a PET-CT, which showed no evidence of metastatic disease and an endoscopic ultrasound, which showed a very long segment of at least 3 cm in length, which was at least a T2, the possibility of a T3 lesion could not be completely excluded.
His recent PET scan showed decreased amounts of avidity of the eprimary mass and no evidence of metastatic disease.
