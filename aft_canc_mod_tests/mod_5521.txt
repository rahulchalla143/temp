Exploratory laparotomy, evacuation of intra-abdominal hematoma, control of hemorrhage from segment 5 liver tumor and ligation right hepatic artery.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain was placed.
PRBC, cryo and factor VII were given for a hct of 22.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] was placed in the location of the laceration of the tumor.
Hct remained stable at 29.
A head CT was done for sedation.
On pod 8, she had a temp of 101.
Blood cultures were drawn.
On [**10-12**], she had a +Urine culture that grew >100,000 colonies of klebsiella pansensitive except for nitrofurantoin.
An abdominal CT was done on [**10-12**] given rising WBC to 20.4 on [**2172-10-10**] and being persistently febrile to 100-102 since surgery on [**10-2**].
A CT showed two heterogeneous hepatic masses with concern for hepatocellular carcinoma.
She then went for CT guided drainage of the collection.
The sample was sent for culture and stain.
An u/s revealed slight decrease in size of presumed hepatic hematoma.
Likely cirrhosis on exam was concerning for development of possible HCC.
A liver path report demonstrated Moderate portal and periportal and mild lobular mixed inflammation (grade 2), consisting of predominantly mononuclear cells with increased eosinophils.
Trichrome stain shows portal fibrosis with rare fibrous septae (stage 2) and sinusoidal fibrosis.
Iron stain shows no stainable iron.
Vital signs were stable.
