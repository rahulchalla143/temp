Admission Date:  [**2108-1-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-1-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2034-4-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3233**] Chief Complaint: Wt loss and abdominal pain   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: laparoscopic lymph node biopsy of the mesentery and retroperitoneum bone marrow biopsy and aspirate ([**2108-1-12**] and [**2108-1-27**]) thoracocentesis ([**2108-1-10**])   History of Present Illness: This is a 73 year-old Vietnamese man with the history below presents with wt.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: back pain, gunshot wound in the left clavicle, hepatitis B, headaches, weight loss, cataracts, advanced glaucoma, GERD Mult.
adenomas on colonoscopy done in [**2105**].
Smoked 2 PPD for the past 59 years (quit two weeks ago).
General Appearance: pleasant, comfortable, NAD, thin, wasted .
Respiratory: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout .
Pertinent Results: CT abdomen and pelvis:[**1-4**] 1.
CT chest:[**1-5**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Recommend follow-up CT after resolution of the pleural effusion for better assessment.
mesenteric lymph node: Sections show a diffuse infiltrate of predominantly medium-sized cells with amphophilic cytoplasm, round nuclear contours, fine chromatin, and one to several nucleoli.
FISH studies performed on unstained tough preps of the biopsy to look for c-myc rearrangement shows a normal hybridization pattern (see separate cytogenetics report).
Negative BCL1 and TdT immunostains do not favor a mantle cell lymphoma or lymphoblastic lymphoma, respectively.
MRI head w/o contrast Limited exam without evidence of lymphoma or acute intracranial process.
Bone Marrow Biopsy 1.
CXR [**1-4**] IMPRESSION: Patchy nodular infiltrate at the left lung base, new since [**3-17**], which may be pneumonic.
CTA chest [**1-16**] 1.
CXR [**1-25**] Since the previous examination, there is significant improved aeration of both lungs with almost complete resolution of the bibasilar dependent atelectasis and the pleural effusion.
His mass was radiographically concerning for lymphoma v. primary intestinal (gastric) adenocarcinoma.
He had a laparoscopic lymph node biopsy of an abdominal node as well as a retroperitoneal node (full results in results section) that showed high grade B cell lymphoma.
A bone marrow biopsy showed histiocytosis but no lymphoma.
He also had bilateral pleural effusions, and underwent a thoracocentesis which showed malignant effusion.
He started [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy and tumor lysis labs were followed closely as there was initial concern for Burkitts which would create a high liklihood of tumor lysis.
His tumor lysis labs were negative throughout and he received aggressive IV hydration.
The final read on his pathology was high grade B cell lymphoma.
An outpatient bone marrow biopsy and aspirate is planned to reevaluate his bone marrow.
He was transferred to the MICU initially on [**1-13**] for episode of hypoxia with O2 saturation of 88-90% on 2LNC.
ABG with pH7.48  CO2 41 and paO2 71 on 5LNC.
His O2 saturation improved to high 90's on 4L NC and he was transferred back to BMT on [**1-14**].
He had a CTA which was negative for pulmonary embolus.
He was transfused 1 unit PRBC on [**1-15**] for HCT <25, thought most likely [**2-18**] marrow supression.
His O2 saturation was stable and in the high nineties on 6L when he was transferred.
His oxygen saturation remained  in the high nineties while on the BMT service and gradually he returned to room air and was satting in the high nineties.
A chest X ray done [**1-25**] showed almost complete resolution of his effusions, no infiltrate and some emphysema.
Serologies for strongyloides, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, aspergillus, HSV 1&2 were sent and are pending.
On your chest X ray there was evidence of pneumonia that was treated.
You had an abdominal CT that showed soft tissue, and you had a biopsy of some of your lymph nodes that showed B cell lymphoma (cancer).
Your oxygen decreased again and you were briefly in the ICU again.
Your white blood cell count dropped because of the chemotherapy and you were receiving a medication that helps the white blood cells recover.
Your white blood cell count is now close to normal.
