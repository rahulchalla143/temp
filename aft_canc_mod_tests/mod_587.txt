In the ED, VS: 98.4 HR 80-140s BP initially 197/104 then 64-121/30-40s RR 15 100% RA.
ECG showing RBBB, LAFB, LVH with strain and sinus tachy to 140s which improved to 120s with IVF.
CXR showing large left sided lung mass now 50% larger than prior, unable to r/out infectin, rec CT when stable.
ECG showing likely sinus tachy improving with IVF.
Also with SBP in 80-90 range, no obvious source of infection, not treated for sepsis.
Hct down to 23 with IVF, guaiac trace positive in ED.
Interval Hx: Patient was admitted [**5-27**] to [**5-29**] with RUE swelling and pain found to have either a mass with bicepts tendon rupture and surrounding edema with plans for repeat MRI and ortho eval as outpatient.
The patients blood pressure was found to be slightly low as well in the range of 90-110/40-60.
--CABG in [**2143-1-28**]((LIMA-LAD, SVG-RCA, jump SVG-RI-OM occluded) --cardiac cath on [**2149-8-18**] for her increasing angina and positive stress test.
She was found to have an EF in the 30% range on echo; echo [**5-3**] EF 50%, Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction, PCWP >18 # DM Type II (last Hgb A1c 6.2 in [**12-3**]); h/o DKA in the past # H.pylori # Esophageal webbing # Ovarian cyst--- rising CA125 -> plan for lap BSO, held [**1-29**] brain mets # Hypothyroidism, Surgery for a thyroid nodule # Gout   Social History: Patient is married and lives with her husband who has diabetes and is disabled in [**Location (un) 669**].
Pertinent Results: CT HEAD [**2152-6-10**] Multiple hyperdense foci of the left hemisphere including parasagittal, anterior left frontal and the left parietal have decreased in size; for example, the left anterior frontal lesion measured 10 mm on the prior study and now measures 5 mm.
There has also been resolution of the mass effect of the metastasis and surrounding edema  ECHO [**2152-6-5**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
CXR 06/13/008 1.
CT CHEST [**2152-6-4**] 1.
Team felt that although it would be helpful to have some data to guide antibiotic coverage, the risks associated with obtaining sample via BAL or CT guided biopsy outweighed the benefits of obtaining culture data.
Blood, urine, stool samples were negative for source of infection.
# Diabetic ketoacidosis: Glucose elevated to 400s with anion gap of 19 on admission.
Treated with aggressive IV hydration, insulin drip and close monitoring of electrolytes with appropriate repletion.
Urine lytes consistent with pre renal etiology.
Creatinine elevated to 1.2 with improvement in blood pressure.
Meds were renally dosed according to creatinine clearance.
CXR showing evidence of rapid growth of likely metastatic mass in lung.
CT with evidence of necrotic mass in left lower lobe, nonhemorrhagic, and multiple nodules consistent with infection.
DIC labs not consistent.
