CT scan was non-diagnostic and she left AMA.
Open MRI (see below) showed bony disease of the greater wings of sphenoid, extending into the optic canal, and bony involvement of the mandible approaching the inferior alveolar nerve canal.

CERVICAL SPINE:  TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and gradient-echo axial images of cervical spine were acquired.
The post-gadolinium cervical images are somewhat limited by motion.
THORACIC SPINE:  TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial images were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 sagittal and axial images were obtained following the administration of gadolinium.
LUMBAR SPINE:  TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial images were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 sagittal and axial images were obtained following the administration of gadolinium.
COMMENT: Compared to the previous MRI of [**2102-7-5**], there appears to be some progression of bony metastatic lesions in the spine.

The patient underwent a MRI spine (requiring subsequent intubation and transfer to the unit for extubation, details of which are above), that did not reveal evidence of cord compression.
# Anemia of Chronic Disease: The patient presented with a Hct of 26.
Iron studies that were sent that were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
The patient should have her hematocrit checked this week.
