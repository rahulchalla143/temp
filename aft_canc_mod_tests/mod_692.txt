In [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, the pt had undergone a CT Chest, which showed mediastinal LAD and a RLL lesion.
Mediastinoscopy was performed, and the [**Hospital1 1474**] pathologist (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] reported "benign findings" (detailed [**Hospital1 1474**] pathology report and phone numbers included in the chart).
At [**Hospital1 18**], a CT Torso was performed, demonstrating diffuse giant LAD throughout the mediastinum and abdomen, as well as a RLL lesion, 2 small liver lesions (one in caudate lobe, one in left lobe), and no splenomegaly.
Since the patient had SOB, chest pain, and a R apical pneumothorax after his mediastinoscopy at [**Hospital1 1474**], it was decided that the giant lymph nodes found on CT Torso, the lung lesion, and 2 liver lesions would not be biopsied, in case the results of the bone marrow aspirate were sufficient for diagnosis.
T- and L-spine XR showed neither a pathologic fracture nor lytic lesions.
Neurologic findings showed R LE weakness.
MRI of the Head, C-, T-, and L-spine ruled out cord compression, but a possibility of an epidural tumor was noted at T10/T11.
MRI Head showed a possible subacute pontine infarct.
However, while attempting to lie on his abdomen, the pt was in excruciating pain and his O2 sat dropped to 90%, and the LP could not be performed.
EPISTAXIS: Diff Dx:  Epistaxis that does not stop after several hours, with a plt count of 56, in a non-uremic pt is unusual, and suggestive of myeloma, lymphoma, bone marrow aplasia, DIC, qualitative plt defects.
Hct remained stable throughout admission.
PURPURA: Diff Dx:  Purpura diffusely over the chest, abdomen, and legs, with a plt count of 56, in a non-uremic pt is unusual, and suggestive of myeloma, lymphoma, bone marrow aplasia, DIC, qualitative plt defects.
Results of uric acid, haptoglobin, retics, total bili, and no schistocytes indicated that a hemolytic anemia or TTP was unlikely.
CBC with diff twice showed selectively early myeloid precursors in the peripheral blood.
Basophilic stippling and [**Location (un) **]-Jolly body was noted on erythrocyte examination.
A peripheral smear (showing erythroblasts and no tear drop cells) and bone marrow aspirate was performed by Hem-Onc (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 16212**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
A bone marrow biopsy could not be performed due to pt's "panic attack" during two attempts.
The results of the BM aspirate revealed a diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the lung with squamous morphology, an undifferentiated tumor.
SOB: Pt's baseline SOB was attributed to COPD (emphysema), as CXR taken for possibility of post-obstructive pneumonia showed no infiltrates.
Echo and daily CXR had not been performed on the day before transfer to OMED, due to more emergent testing.
COPD (Emphysema): Pt has a 50 pk-yr smoking history and emphysema, and was maintained at >95% O2 sat on 2L O2 nasal cannula alone.
High flow 5L O2 nasal cannula was maintained to help resolve pt's pneumothorax.
