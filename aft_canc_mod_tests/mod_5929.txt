<br>Stool C.diff [**7-20**]: CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2133-7-21**]):       REPORTED BY PHONE TO T. QURIAN @ 2324 ON [**2133-7-20**].
<br>IMAGING: <br>ECHO [**2133-7-17**]:The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-6-22**], the LV systolic funciton appears slightly less vigorous.
<br>Pacer U/S [**2133-7-16**]: Limited [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale evaluation of the left chest wall demonstrates a hypoechoic fluid collection surrounding the pacer leads.
A CT with contrast can be performed for further evaluation.
Blood cultures taken at rehab [**7-15**] grew out gram + cocci and cultures were positive for MRSA.
Blood cultures taken [**7-16**] in [**Hospital1 18**] also grew out MRSA.
Blood cultures taken on [**7-19**], and [**7-21**] showed no growth.
The patient had a preliminary ultrasound of the pacer pocket which showed a small fluid collection which was most likely postoperative.
TTE showed no evidence of vegetations so further workup was not pursued because the patient was clinically improved with no fevers and no leukocytosis.
<br>Pleural Effusions: CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions which were thought to be fluid overload due to his chronic kidney disease and known CHF.
This was supplemented with mitodrine to keep BP at a goal of SBP in the high 80s and MAP > 55.
Because his tunnelled HD catheter was thought to be the source of his infection, this was removed at presentation and replaced with a right IJ compatible with HD for use over the short term.
Patient's electrolytes were monitored daily with the plan to give kayexelate for K > 5.7, renagel for elevated PO4.
Medications were renally dosed and he was kept on a fluid restriction of 750cc.
Eosinophils were elevated to 4.5% on the differential which supported the idea of drug rash.
His pacer pocket ultrasound showed small fluid collection as per above, and clinical signs of infection were monitored with the plan that if he worsened he would receive chest CT to further work up pacer pocket infection.
[**7-20**] platelets 91; [**7-21**] platelets 75.
