The lesion was crossed with a Choice PT wire and a distal injection showed in-stent restenosis with minimal thrombus.
The wire was then exchanged for a GuardWire which was inflated in the distal graft.
Final angiography showed no residual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI 3 flow.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: mid anterior - hypo; basal inferior - hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid inferolateral - akinetic; anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex - akinetic;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction ~35%?.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of  [**2097-9-13**], left ventricular systolic function may be similar to slightly improved.
EGD Wednesday, [**2101-2-16**]: Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
A physical exam was performed.

A physical exam was performed.
Visualization of the cecum and some parts of colon was poor.
The digital exam was normal.
Had another episode of his usual angina after transfer to the floor with nonspecific ECG changes and no change in CE.
Hct drop from 37.5 to 26. got 1 unit and continued to drop to 24 but remained HD stable.
Had prior colonoscopy [**1-15**] yrs ago showing diverticulosis and no polyps.
Seen by GI with EGD (mild gastritits/duodenitis, some erosions, no active bleeding but blood in fundus) and colonoscopy (no active bleeding, small avms could have been missed.
Restarted BB once hct stable and for episode of CP.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
You will need a repeat echocardiogram in approximately 8 weeks; he will arrange this.
You will need a repeat colonoscopy in 1 year.
