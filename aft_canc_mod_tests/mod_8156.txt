He had a screening colonoscopy on [**4-15**] showing two 3 to 4 mm distal sigmoid polyps with diverticulosis of the sigmoid, ascending, and descending colon.
He had electric prostate biopsy due to evidence of prostate nodule and elevated PSA on [**2144-4-16**], which was uneventful.
On [**4-17**] he had evidence of lower gastrointestinal bleeding with bright red blood per rectum after the prostate biopsy with hemodynamic instability requiring transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Tamponade with Foley balloon transiently seized bleeding, however, repeat attempt at anticoagulation led to a repeat bleed with a drop in his hematocrit of 44 to 34, he became hypotensive requiring 3 units of red blood cells, 1 unit of fresh frozen platelets, vitamin K and repeat placement of Foley and the rectum for tamponade of bleeding.
He underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy on [**4-20**] to assess his etiology of bleeding, which revealed diverticulosis of the ascending colon and transverse colon, blood throughout the rectum and sigmoid colon and a heaped up ulcerated mucosa in the rectum, which was presumed to be the site of the prostate biopsy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed a temperature of 98.3, blood pressure 124/86, heart rate 65, respirations 16, oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.
He had a loud S2.
His lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds throughout, but clear.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  CBC revealed a white blood cell cont of 9, hematocrit 36.6, platelets 243.
Chemistries revealed a sodium of 137, potassium 4.7, chloride 104, bicarb 24, BUN of 22, creatinine 1.4.
He had a PT of 14.0, PTT 69 and INR of 1.3.
Gastrointestinal:  Prior to being transferred to the Medicine Service the patient had a lower gastrointestinal bleed after his prostate biopsy as outlined in the history of present illness.
He was transferred to the floor with a stable hematocrit times 72 hours and he was hemodynamically stable.
His hematocrit was monitored b.i.d.
He was hemodynamically stable and his hematocrit was stable as well.
From that time until the time of discharge he was just awaiting a therapeutic INR of greater then 2.5.
He was admitted for prostate biopsy and a screening colonoscopy due to the need for anticoagulation with heparin while holding Coumadin.
with a therapeutic INR above 2.5.
Renal:  The patient is noted to have a baseline creatinine ranging from 1.1 to 1.3, likely secondary to some renal insufficiency from his hypertension.
On [**4-24**] he was noted to have a bump in his creatinine to 1.7 most likely secondary to his gastrointestinal bleed and hypotension.
with a therapeutic INR of 2.6.
He had an INR of 2.6.
He will also have his INR checked two days after discharge at the [**Hospital 197**] Clinic.
