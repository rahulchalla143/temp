=========================STUDIES================================ CXR Portable ([**2126-12-4**]) FINDINGS: AP portable upright view of the chest is obtained.
The heart appears enlarged, though this is difficult to quantitate given the study limitations and the lack of prior studies.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Pleural fluid cytology: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS; CONSISTENT WITH ADENOCARCINOMA .
Her respiratory issues were multi-factorial: (1) large plerual effusion, with a thoracentesis that showed malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma and minimal symptomatic relief.
Initial echocardiogram findings were suspicious for a PE given the level of RV failure, but this was felt to be a progression of her pulmonary hypertension.
All labs draws were stopped, her invasive monitoring was discontinued, and she expired shortly thereafter.
# CHF exacerbation with hypotension: Though she was volume overloaded on exam from heart failure, she could not tolerate any appreciable diuresis due to her low blood pressures, requiring increasing amount of peripheral dopamine for support.
