Micro: Multiple blood, sputum, urine, and BAL cultures negative.
BAL from [**1-25**]:    RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2164-2-2**]):   >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.
Cytology: Pleural fluid negative x3 for malignancy CT guided bx positive for adenoca of lung .
Imaging: [**1-24**]: CT Abd: 1.
PET CT may help for further staging.
[**1-23**]: CT chest: Chest CT [**2164-1-23**]: (1) Mass or mass-like consolidation in two segments of the left upper lobe.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
CXR upon admission: 1.
CXR upon discharge: Tracheostomy tube and G-tube seen in relatively stable position.
Bronchoscopy was performed x4 each time with evidence of mucus plugging and thick secretions.
Sputum cultures did not, however, yield growth in order to guide antibiotic coverage.
# Adenoca of the lung: CT guided biopsy showed adenoca of the lung.
He had a negative head CT for mets but did have an adrenal met noted on abdominal CT scan.
He had pleural fluid neg x3 for malignancy.
# Cards Vasc: In the setting of hypoxia and hemoptysis, the patient had a troponin peak to 0.9.
An echo showed some mid-septal hypokinesis.
His BP would rise to >170s systolic with agitation.
However, for at least 10 days prior to discharge, his blood pressure was well controlled on metoprolol 37.5 tid.
final discussion revealed that patient is DNR but would be hooked up to ventilator if in respiratory distress.
