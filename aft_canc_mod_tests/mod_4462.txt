Labs showed Cr=2.62, Tbili=2.8, ALT=2409, AST=6134, LDH=5512, glucose=47, lactate=15.

CT HEAD [**2194-10-17**] IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
MRI Abdomen [**2194-10-18**]  FINDINGS: There is interval increase in size of the hepatocellular carcinoma in segment II.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series (112 and 113).
Elevated Transaminases/bilirubin - Transaminases peaked at 3048/9420 on [**10-17**] and continued to trend down throughout the hospitalization.
Preliminary read of abdominal MRI w/partially occlusive IVC thrombus.
His transaminases trended down daily until the patient was discharged.
Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline is creatinine 1, At discharge the patient's creatinine was back to baseline.
Acute Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Stable since admission, in setting of thrombocytopenia.
His fibrinogen and thrombocytopenia stabilized as his liver function improved.
Syncope: Unclear trigger, sounds as though initially presyncopal and wonder if this was related to hypotension/poor perfusion state leading to lactic acidosis and end organ ischemia.
Head CT was negative in setting of trauma and supratherapeutic INR.
BP was stable in 100s, dipped to 90s prior to transfer from ICU, resolved w/500cc fluid bolus.
Lactate levels trended down with IV hydration.
Blood and urine cultures revealed no evidence of infection.
MRI showed enlargement of tumor and extension into IVC.

You were given a drug to thin your blood and your liver enzymes started to come down.
You had an MRI that showed your tumor has spread - this may have caused the liver failue that brought you into the hospital.
