Hyperdensity at the lung bases is most compatible with Ethiodol, likely secondary to a small intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
These findings are new compared to a CT Torso from [**2189-9-30**].
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-12-11**], left ventricular systolic function is more dynamic and the heart rate is higher.
[**2189-12-23**] - CT Chest  Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o with metastatic neuroendocrine CA admitted for hydration prior to TACE on [**12-7**], presented to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to what was thought to be hospital-acquired pneumonia vs acute on chronic diastolic CHF vs pneumonitis secondary to a portosystemic shunt communicating from her TACE procedure.
Patient was transferred from oncology service after her TACE for increased respiratory distress with a subacute decompensation, which was initially thought to be from acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, pneumonia, aspiration, hemorrhage or VTE with a small component of portosystemic shunt.
However, subsequent bronchoscopy did not suggest an infectious or hemorrhagic etiology as BAL was negative and bronchoscopy showed mostly clear aspirate.
Thoracic surgery was consulted for possible VATS biopsy to obtain a more definitive diagnosis to patient's parenchy infiltrates seen on CXR and CT.
As her sepsis improved, she was able to tolerate intermittent dose of lasix to diurese the presumed pulmonary edema as her total length of state fluid balance was positive.
# Shock, liekly [**3-3**] distributive/sepsis with SvO2 78% and initial SVV [**5-17**].
Patient initially required Levophed support as well as fluid boluses to maintain her MAP and urine output.
The likely source for the sepsis is pulmonary infection/inflammation based on radiographical evidence as her other culture data have been negative.
Her SVO2 and SVV were monitored closely to help guide therapy.
Initial echocardiogram showed LVEF of 50-55%.
Her repeat echocardiogram showed hyperdynamic ventricular function, correlating to her distributive shock picture.
Her CBC was monitored on a daily basis.
Her white count, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were stably low.
Active type and screen were maintained.
Her LFT was elevated after TACE, but gradually trended downward during her stay in the ICU.
At that point Ms. [**Known lastname 52986**] family decided that in light of her continued deterioration and in respect for her clear wish not to have prolonged life supporting care if her lung function was not improving to make comfort the sole goal and will discontinue any therapy not directed at comfort.
