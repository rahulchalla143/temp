She went to [**Location (un) 620**] and had a head CT which showed a left cerebellar hemisphere hemorrhage with some edema, but no obstruction of the 4th ventricle.

If there is clinical concern, MRI would be more sensitive for evaluation of acute brain ischemia.
MRI [**5-8**]: Multiple infarcts involving several vascular territories, the largest area involving the right temporal and parietal regions, which appear acute and subacute.
Blood products in both the right parietal region as well as the left cerebellum.
Please consider a cardiac echo to evaluate for thrombus and defects such as a PFO or ASD.
Follow up examination in a few days may help to differentiate multiple emboli from the possibility of metastatic disease given the patient's history of breast cancer.
C-spine x-ray: 1.
Limited study as described above.
The cervical spine cannot be fully evaluated on these views; however, there are no signs for acute injury.
If there is high clinical concern, cross-sectional imaging with CT scan can be performed.
There is also retrolisthesis of C3 over C4 and anterolisthesis of C4 over C5.
CTA Head & Neck w/Contrast: 1.
Chest CT w/Contrast: 1.
Air bronchogram containing right upper lobe opacity is likely infectious with malignant etiologies including a slow growing bronchoalveolar carcinoma felt less likely.
Recommend appropriate treatment and repeat CT examination in three months to assess for change.
TEE [**2111-5-11**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest x 2 (unable to cooperate with maneuvers).
Neurology: Initial and repeat head CT stable.
MRI showed right temporoparietal infarct, several other small right and left infarcts, c/w embolic source or prothrombotic state.
Lipid panel was total 163/HDL 46/triglycerides 99/LDL 90, increased Pravastatin to 40.
Plan to Repeat MRI with contrast in one month and follow-up in [**Hospital 4038**] clinic at that time to readdress starting anti-coagulation such as Lovenox.
She will need follow up CXR or CT scan, as an outpatient to further assess the nature of this finding.
Status post fall:  CT c-spine done at [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital, report no fracture but positive for retrolisthesis.
Cards:  Monitored on telemetry without events.
TTE with normal EF, agitated saline contrast study revealed late bubbles which may reflect pulmonary A-V shunting but cannot exclude intracardiac shunt.
ID:  CT chest performed showed air bronchogram containing right upper lobe opacity, likely infectious with malignant etiologies including a slow growing bronchoalveolar carcinoma felt less likely.
Recommend appropriate treatment and repeat CT examination in three months to assess for change.
Heme:  Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
She drifted down to a nadir of 22.5 and was transfused two units of packed red cells on [**2111-5-12**] with an appropriate bump in her hct to 30.9.
She will need intermittent checks of her hct and should be tranfused for hct<25.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 11851**] Healthcare - [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - Left cerebellar abd Right parietal infarcts with hemorrhagic conversion  Secondary diagnosis: - Metastatic breast CA - Gastroesophageal reflux - Anemia   Discharge Condition: Good.
You will need to follow-up with the stroke neurologist and get a repeat MRI brain with contrast (see below).
You will need your red blood cell count checked by your primary care physician one week after discharge.
