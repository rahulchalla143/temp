LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 20.2, chronically elevated.
Hematocrit 28.3 chronically anemic.
Creatinine 2.6, blood urea nitrogen 46.
Chest CT was without consolidation.

While on the floor on the Trauma service, the patient was noted to have a bilirubin that increased from 1.1 to 8.6 over one day.
The patient's bilirubin continued to increase thereafter up to 15.0.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained which showed sludging but apparently a patent stent.
The patient's white count thereafter decreased and was maintained afebrile throughout the remainder of his hospital stay.
Magnetic resonance scan to rule out stroke was considered, but the family did not wish for an magnetic resonance scan.
Instead, head CT without contrast was performed and ruled out hemorrhagic stroke.
The patient's hematocrit has been maintained at 30.0 with blood transfusions given presumed heart disease.
The patient's blood pressure while in the hospital remained elevated but controlled.
