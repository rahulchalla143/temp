At [**Hospital1 **], he had O2 sat 92% on 4L by NC.
Labs were notable for WBC of 7.0 with 15% bandemia, Hct of 24.9, creatinine of 4.0, and lactate of 0.8.
He underwent chest x-ray that showed enlarged aorta, and subsequent CT (noncontrast given renal failure) that showed dissection extending from arch to beyond the level of the renal arteries.
He was started on BIPAP for his SOB and an esmolol gtt to control blood pressures.
He received levofloxacin for possible pneumonia and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of the dissection.
The celiac, SMA, and right renal artery arise from the true lumen while the left renal artery arises from the false lumen.

III) Imaging: CT Chest/Abdomen without Contrast:  IMPRESSION 1.
Limited non-contrast CT of the chest and abdomen demonstrating a type B [**Year/Month/Day 8813**] dissection extending to the level of the infrarenal aorta, inferior aspect not included on the images.
Allowing for differences in technique, this has not significantly changed since the earlier study of [**2115-7-18**].
New since the prior study are small simple bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
Renal Doppler US: IMPRESSION: 1.
Redemonstration of type B [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] dissection with slight interval increase in size of the aorta.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.

Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old man with a past medical history signficant for chronic kidney disease, hypertension, prostate cancer s/p XRT, and type [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 11916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8813**] dissection (dxed [**2114**]) transferred from outside hospital for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
He had a chest CT which showed type B [**Hospital3 8813**] dissection (old, but not clear at OSH).
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of [**Hospital1 8813**] dissection (see below).
Patient admitted initially to the ICU and was diuresed and blood pressure controlled.
Following extubation patient was transferred to the medical floor where he required intensive titration of blood pressure medications to maintain goal SBP <130 although BPs on the floor were 120-160.
Goal SBP <130.
Home VNA was arranged to help keep BP within goal.
#Acute On Chronic Renal Failure: The patient presented to [**Hospital1 **] with a creatinine of 4.
His elevated creatinine was felt to be related to malignant hypertension and improved with treatment of blood pressure and CHF.
Renal doppler ultrasound did not show renal artery stenosis, however, it is possible that his [**Year (4 digits) 8813**] dissection partly into the renal artery may be creating RAS physiology.
#Chronic [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) 11916**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Dissection: MRA showed no interval progression in the size of his [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8813**] dissection.
The patient was seen by Vascular Surgery and blood pressure was treated aggressively as stated above.
After verifying with [**Hospital1 **] that his cultures were negative.
His cultures at [**Hospital1 **] were also negative.
Blood pressure control.
Home VNA has been arranged for the patient to help with his medications and blood pressure measurements.
Ideally, his blood pressure should be in the 130's or less.
Chronic [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) 11916**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Dissection 2.
Your congestive heart failure which has now resolved was most likely caused by your high blood pressure and excess fluid and salt retention.
We resolved this condition by controlling your blood pressure and starting you on a water pill to help keep your lungs from becoming congested.
Your blood pressure should be around 120/80 or slightly lower if possible.
If your blood pressure gets too high, the tear in your aorta can increase in side and your dissection could get worse which is a LIFE THREATENING CONDITION.
We have made some changes to your home medications to help control your blood pressure.
We have also arranged for you to have a visting home nurse to help you with your blood pressure medications and helping you to take your blood pressure every day.
