Compared to the previous tracing of [**2141-6-9**] the rate has increased and the non-specific ST segment changes are new.
[**2143-6-29**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP)IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
If the clinical situation of the patient worsens over the next few days/weeks, then a followup MRCP examination may be obtained.
A followup MRI may be obtained in six months to ensure stability.

[**2143-7-15**] 11:01 AM   # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76391**]   CHEST (PORTABLE AP) CHEST (PORTABLE AP) FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**7-9**], there is increasing prominence of interstitial markings consistent with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
LINE PLACEM FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position.
In comparison with the next preceding chest examination of [**2139-7-15**], no new pulmonary or cardiovascular abnormalities identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 81M with history of AAA s/p repair presenting with chest/abd pain x 2d with labs and imaging consistent with pancreatitis.
Active Diagnoses # Necrotizing Pancreatitis: Patient diagnosed with pancreatitis given classic pain radiating to the back, elevated lipase, and findings on CT c/w pancreatitis.
On [**7-8**] he developed fever and CT scanning noted air with an area of pancreatic necrosis concerning for infection; he was started on meropenem/flagyl for infected necrotizing pancreatitis and continued for a full 14 day course.
On [**7-13**] he was noted with increasing LFTs and lipase; MRCP was performed which showed worsening pancreatic necrosis and edema as well as worsening hemorrhagic collections around the pancreas (at this time he was coagulopathic with an INR of ~6).
The drain initially had ~1L per day output which tapered off to ~100-200cc daily, suggesting (per GI) that his duodenal edema had resolved and the ampulla was no longer extrinsically compressed or obstructed.
As above, when he was noted to have hemorrhagic conversion of his pancreatitis his INR was reversed with IV vitamin K and his anticoagulation was managed with a heparin drip up until the day of discharge.
He was given coumadin 2 days prior to discharge (home dose 6mg) and will need to continue heparin bridge with goal PTT 60-90 until his INR is [**1-25**] for 48 hours, at which point he can be maintained on coumadin only.
Negative HIT antibodies and negative serotonin release assay.
By [**2143-7-1**], the INR was 2.8, and warfarin was restarted; once again became supratherapeutic and warfarin was held prior to surgery, transition to heparin drip on [**2143-7-7**] when INR was 2.3.
These were held upon discharge due to him having no issues with blood pressure while in hospital.
Transitional Issues # Communication: Patient, son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76393**] # [**Name2 (NI) 7092**]: Full (confirmed) - percutaneous cholecystostomy tube to remain in place and course dictated by pancreaticobiliary surgery - cholecystectomy at some point to be determined by surgery - ongoing heparin bridge to coumadin, goal INR [**1-25**] for bypass graft - ongoing gradual diet advancement with continuation of tube feeds till regular low fat diet is acheived without abdominal symptoms or LFT/lipase elevation - ongoing evaluation for insulin requirement - restarting home blood pressure medications when more medically stable and required - daily diuresis with IV lasix for goal of -1L net negative - pancreatic cyst noted on initial MRCP - will need repeat in 6 months.
