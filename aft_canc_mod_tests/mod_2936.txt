Distal trachea, biopsy (A):   Involvement by classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, not otherwise specified, see note.
Note: Sections show tracheal mucosa, cartilage, and fibrous tissue with an extensive lymphoid infiltrate composed of small lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, histiocytes and scattered large atypical lymphoid cells.
Since the biopsy is represented by small fragments of tissue subtype classification is not advisable.
Esophagus, biopsy (B):  Involvement by classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, not otherwise specified, see note.
By immunohistochemistry, the large atypical lymphoid cells ae positive for CD30, and negative for CD20, CD45 and ALK-1.
Esophagus, biopsy (C):  a.  Fragments of squamous epithelium with extensive infiltration by neutrophils, consistent with an ulcer base.
A representative fragment is additionally submitted for routine histology in C.   By his/her signature above, the senior physician certifies that he/she personally conducted a gross and/or microscopic examination of the described specimens(s) and rendered or confirmed the diagnosis(es) related thereto.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector high-resolution CT scanning of the trachea was performed following administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray contrast.
Evaluation of the soft tissues again, demonstrates diffuse abnormalities with extensive bulky lymphadenopathy extending from the right supraclavicular region into the superior mediastinum and into the right hilar and subcarinal regions.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
There remains widening of the right mediastinal and hilar contours, although this appears improved compared to the earlier study of [**4-8**] and slightly improved compared to the more recent study of [**4-9**].
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] of the right and left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, and brachial veins were performed.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified in the subclavian, axillary, brachial, or basilic veins, which demonstrate normal color flow and waveforms.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
