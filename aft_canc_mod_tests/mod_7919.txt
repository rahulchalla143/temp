ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  The patient is an 80 year-old female who presented initially for surgical evaluation after having a workup for postprandial abdominal pain, which found a gastric mass on gastrointestinal series.
CT subsequently revealed a large gastric mass with increased soft tissue density within the transverse colon.
The patient subsequently had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which showed a submucosal infiltrative circumferential mass of malignant appearance in the antrum and stomach body pathology of which showed an adenocarcinoma of the signet ring cell type with chronic inactive gastritis.
The chest was clear to auscultation and percussion.
The heart sounds were regular, but there was notably a grade 2 to 3 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the left sternal border that radiates up into the carotids with minor radiation to the axilla.
There was no ascites and the extremities showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
PREOPERATIVE LABORATORIES:  Her preoperative hematocrit was 36.2.
Preoperative platelet count was 466.
She refused any sort of transfusion of blood products, therefore there was a concern of any sort of bleeding that the patient might encounter.
Postoperatively her hematocrit was 29, which the patient was tolerating well with satisfactory O2 saturation and no other evidence of tachycardia or hypoxia.
Blood draws were minimized in the postoperative period in order to avoid over phlebotomizing the patient.
Neurologically:  Her pain was initially controlled with an epidural, which was subsequently discontinued and she was switched over to intravenous pain medications followed by po pain medications without any sort of difficulty.
The chest x-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusions, but it was deemed that thoracentesis would not be indicated in her case.
Her upper gastrointestinal study on postoperative day six evidenced no leak or stricture.
Renal function:  Her BUN and creatinine were fairly stable and were 35 and 1.0.
By postoperative day nine the patient had been afebrile and had remained in sinus rhythm for several days and otherwise with good blood pressures and had been making excellent urine and tolerating a post gastrectomy diet without difficulty.
