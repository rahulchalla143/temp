Because of his dramatically reduced responsiveness the patient was brought in to the ED where initial vitals revealed an O2 sat of 86% on a nonrebreather.
Imaging revealed a right sided infiltrate, EKG w/ NSR w/ slightly peaked T's.
After receiving 2 L of fluids the patient's temp was 96.7, P 100, BP 106/82, RR 30-35, and satting 90-100% on the ventilator.
ABG 7.28/35/330 and lactate was down to 5.8.
CT head was negative.

Some patient motion on inferior most images, making evaluation in this region suboptimal.
CXR: [**9-30**] Single AP supine portable view of the chest was obtained.
Renal U/S: [**9-30**] 1.
The following is a brief problem based summary of his hospital course prior to expiration: 1) Septic shock: Presented with septic physiology: hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate and severe renal dysfunction.
Upon presentation, patient was aggressively rehydrated according to the Rivers protocol with boluses of crystalloid and levophed gtt to target MAP > 65, UOP > 50cc/hr and CVP of [**9-24**].
Additionally started on broad spectrum empiric antibiotics including vancomycin/ cefepime/ ciprofloxacin and flagyl which were subsequently narrowed to ciprofloxacin given pan-sensitive enterococcus from urine culture and pansensitive proteus from blood.
On [**10-5**], patient developped recurrent shock physiology with fevers and hypotension that was attributed to VAP based on sputum cultures that grew MRSA, psudomonas and proteus.
Patient slowly improved and was able to weaned off levophed again, when WBC count rose to 17.5K on [**10-5**].
Repeat blood and urine cultures were sent, CVL was changed and antibiotics were broadened to meropenem and ciprofloxacin for improved pseudomonas coverage.
As stated above, his antibiotic coverage was expanded based on sputum culture results to vanc/ cefepime.
3) Anuric renal failure: Admitted with oliguria and ARF with creatinine of 5.8 from recent baseline of 1.8.
Renal ultrasound on admission had no evidence of worsened hydronephrosis or obstructive nephropathy.
Initially fluid resusicated with boluses of NS to correct underlying hypovolemia.
Echo showed mild symmetric left ventrcular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic global systolic function and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
