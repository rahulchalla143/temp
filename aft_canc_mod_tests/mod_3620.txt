The patient had no echo and cath signs suggestive of tamponade with small-moderate sized effusion.
Extensive work-up of for a source of pericarditis, including rheumatologic, infectious and malignant is ongoing and thus far negative (including pericardial fluid negative for AFB, viral cultures or malignant cells).
He underwent bedside echocardiogram with verbal report of small pericardial effusion, elevated RA pressure but no tamonade.
The patient had a CXR with a question of left lower lobe pneumonia and he received levofloxacin 500mg IV.

COMPARISON: CT of the torso, [**2108-12-13**].
RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 12.8 cm.
Relatively echogenic region within the interpolar left kidney appears to correspond to an area of normal cortex seen on CT in association with a duplicated collecting system on the left side.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Normal IVC diameter (<2.5cm) with <50% decrease during respiration (estimated RAP 10-15mmHg).
Effusion echo dense, c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
Echo findings are suggestive but not diagnostic of constriction.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Emergency study performed by the cardiology fellow on call.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
The echo findings are suggestive but not diagnostic of pericardial constriction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-12-17**], the small echolucent pericardial effusion has become a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion that is echodense, largest posterior to the left ventricle.
Echo showed no signs of tamponade, but showed small to moderate effusion and constrictive process.
Pt was seen by rheum on previous admission and extensive workup was positive only for mildly elevated RF and SSA anitbodies.
Pericardial fluid was found to be positive for peptostreptoccocus and 1+WBCs.
Echo showed pericardial effusion and constriction.
He spiked a temp to 102 on POD #1 and was pancultured.
His creatinine became elevated and his toradol was dc'd.
His urine lytes were normal.
He was pancultured, UA was negative, blood cultures with no growth to date and a chest x-ray reveal atelectasis.
