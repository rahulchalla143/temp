HPI: 65 yo man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma metastatic to abdomen and retroperitonium with a complicated history of biliary obstruction from tumor compression who is transfered to OMED from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
In the ED VS sign for BP 99/55, HR 72, T 96.8, sat 98% RA.
BP improved to 110's-140.

Past Onc Hx: Mr. [**Known lastname 7710**] presented in [**2176-10-19**] with urinary retention, ultrasound revealing a mass in the right kidney, surgery was delayed, but he underwent right nephrectomy on [**2177-3-14**], revealing a 10-cm tumor clear cell pathology, [**Last Name (un) 9951**] grade 3 to 4, with tumor extension into the perinephric issues.
The patient was enrolled in the ARISER clinical trial randomized phase III double blind adjuvant study involving cG250 versus placebo, received twelve weeks of therapy, at which point, a CAT scan demonstrating increased retroperitoneal lymph nodes suggestive of metastatic disease.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization with stent placement for symptoms of angina on [**2177-7-30**], to the RCA.
Followup CT in mid [**Month (only) 216**] revealed slight increase in size of retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and since then the patient has intermittent history of abdominal pain, which has become progressive in nature.

HEENT: sclera icteric, dry MM, CV: RRR, no murmurs, rubs, gallps Chest: limited exam due to patient's inability to sit up, though CTAB, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi appreciated Abd: abdomen mildly distended, +BS, no guarding or rebound, mildly tender to deep palpation over left side of abdomen Ext: [**2-21**]+ pitting edema in BLE Neuro: CN 2-12 grossly intact   Pertinent Results: Imaging: ERCP [**2178-7-30**]: Tumor infiltration in the duodenum.
Gallbladder US [**2178-7-29**]:  The common bile duct was not visualized due to overlying bowel gas, however, no evidence of intrahepatic bilary ductal dilatation was noted.
Pneumobilia was noted within the left lobe of the liver most likely related to the recent procedure.
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**2178-7-8**]: Increased intrahepatic biliary dilatation without intrabiliary gas suggests occlusion of the common bile duct stent.
On [**8-16**], he acutely desatted with oxygen saturations in the low 80's.
