Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2126-12-18**] EEG - IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal routine portable EEG in the awake and sleeping states due to the modest slowing of the background and infrequent bursts of generalized theta slowing.
[**2126-12-15**] Immunophenotyping of CSF - RESULTS: Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield.
CD19-positive B-cells are extremely scant in number precluding evaluation of clonality.
Cell marker analysis was attempted, but was non-diagnostic in this case due to insufficient numbers of lymphoid cells for analysis.

EKG ([**12-9**]): Sinus rhythm at 77.
CT pelvis [**2126-12-27**]: FINDINGS: There is a linear lucency in the posterior left iliac bone compatible with previous bone marrow biopsy aspiration tract.

MRI orbit with and without contrast [**2126-12-31**]: 1.
Echo [**2127-1-7**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function.
LENIs [**2127-1-10**]: IMPRESSIONS: 1.
Peripheral filling defect and decreased compressibility of right superficial femoral and popliteal veins, consistent with chronic thrombus that has recanalized since the prior study in [**2126-10-19**].
MRI l-spine with and without contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
Bone marrow biopsy done [**2127-1-9**]: -final report pending at time of discharge .

His blood pressures were in 90s systolic without the need for IVF boluses.
He was felt to have pulmonary process based on CT scan/ CXR.
Bronchoscopy revealed no organism growth.
Antifungals were discontinued when tissue fungal culture remained negative for one week.
Pathology from lung tissue showed organizing pneumonia, however given that no organisms were growing on culture patient was started on steroids for possible BOOP.
Legionella antigen, beta-glucan, galactomannan, histoplasma, cryptococcus, toxoplasma were all negative.
Post ICU: # Hypoxic respiratory failure/COP: He was thought to have COP (cryptogenic organizing pneumonia) and was started on steroids on [**12-2**] which were tapered off and ultimately stopped on [**2126-12-26**].
# AFB cx positive: His tissue biopsy from his lung was positive for AFB on [**2126-12-22**].

A MRI of the lumbar sacral plexis showed no metastatic disease, unremarkable appearance of the sacral plexus, and mild narrowing of the left L3/4 neural foramen without evidence of nerve root impingement.
His CT was negative.
Lumbar puncture x 2 negative for meningitis, including lymphomatous meningitis.
An EEG was done which showed no seizure activity.
A CT of the head was negative for bleed.
An MRI with particular attention to the cavernous sinuses, orbits, and brain stem was normal.
The patient also received an LP on [**2127-1-1**] which showed one atypical cell.
The following day he began to experience nausea, emesis, and headache and a repeat CT head was negative.
His WBCs, ANC, and plts all began to fall.
A bone marrow biopsy was done on [**2127-1-8**] and the results were unremarkable.
He received neupogen on [**2127-1-10**] and his counts began to rise and he is no longer neutropenic.
However, due to the severity of the back pain he received plain films of his back and a CT scan of his back both of which were overall negative.
A bone scan was then done as there was concern for either osteomyelitis or recurrence of his cancer.
The bone scan was negative.
LENIs were done and showed evidence of old DVT but no evidence of acute DVT.
