Total laminectomy of L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5.
During the admission, he required Medical ICU monitoring for neurochecks and further evaluation of epidural abscess.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital3 2568**] ED, where the patient was evaluated by orthopedics who felt that the patient had a painful left ankle with somewhat preserved passive range of motion, and that his exam could be consistent with cellulitis of the lateral aspect of the ankle.
Initial labs showed INR of 7.4, Lactic acid of 1, WBC 18, BUN and creatinine of 44 and 0.8, AST and ALT of 108 and 127, respectively, Alkaline Phos 297, and C-reactive of 348.
However, on the night of [**1-18**], he spiked to 102.3 and prelim cultures grew GPC's and Vancomycin was added.
CTA was done at that time which showed no PE, but showed pulmonary nodules.
Subsequently, blood cultures in [**12-29**] bottles grew out MSSA bacteria, and she was switched to oxacillin 2g IV q4hrs.
TTE was done, which was poor quality, but showed no vegetations.
The patient was evaluated by the Neurosurgeon Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 3704**], who recommended that the patient be transfered the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] as the patient requires more MRI of the Spine (Thoracic and Cervical) and a MRI brain to rule out any more extensive pathology.
His vital signs are HR 111 BP 103/72 O2 96% 2L.

Ankle x-ray [**2143-1-18**]: Impression:  Overlying cast obscures bony details.
CXR [**2143-1-18**]: Impression:  Low lung volumes.
There are ill-defined densities in both lung apices, which may reflect post-inflammatory or infectious changes.
Ill-defined densities in both lung apices, which may reflect post-inflammatory or infectious changes.
Multiple 4 to 6 mm pulmonary nodules.
Abdominal u/s [**2143-1-18**]: Findings:  The liver and spleen are normal in size.
The right kidney measures 13.9cm and the left, 15.7 cm.
Limited evaluation as described above.
TTE [**2143-1-19**]: This was a technically difficult study secondary to poor penetration.
Left ventricular wall thickness and systolic function overall preserved estimated at 60-65%.
EKG:  [**1-19**] from [**Hospital3 **] EKG read (no EKG present) Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Possible Inferior infarct (cited on or before [**0-0-0**]) Abnormal ECG When compared with ECG of [**0-0-0**] 07:42, Atrial fibrillation has replaced Sinus rhythm Vent.
If there is a serious clinical concern for infection, MRI would be the next imaging procedure.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] w/ and w/out contrast ([**1-21**]): IMPRESSION: Extremely limited study with motion; although there is no large epidural abscess seen or prevertebral abscess identified or obvious evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis seen.
If there is continued clinical concern, a repeat study preferably with sedation can help.
MR T- and L-spine w/ and e/out contrast ([**1-20**]): IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous pattern of enhancement identified in the lumbar spine posteriorly, likely consistent with an early epidural phlegmon or epidural abscess formation, extending from L2/L3 through L4/L5 levels, causing significant narrowing of the thecal sac posteriorly.
The examination is limited due to the patient habitus and epidural lipomatosis, grossly in the thoracic spine, there is no evidence of spinal cord compression or intrinsic signal changes within the thoracic spinal cord.
CXR ([**1-21**]): IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging: Extremely low lung volumes are responsible for considerable anatomic distortions, including crowding of pulmonary vasculature and widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
I would strongly urge conventional chest radiographs and if serious questions of abnormality remain clarification by a chest CT scan, if that is justified clinically.
TTE ECHO ([**1-21**]): IMPRESSION: Very suboptimal image quality.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2143-2-1**]):    NO GROWTH.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 52 yo man with h/o CAD, HTN, A-FIB (Coumadin) who presented with back pain, found to have MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess s/p drainage, with a hospital course complicated by Acute Renal Failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia, which both improved prior to discharge.
MRI at OSH and at [**Hospital1 18**] was consistent with epidural abscess L2-L4/5.
Cultures subsequently grew MSSA, prompting the initial use of nafcillin.
Once the blood cultures were noted to be positive at OSH for MSSA, the patient was started on nafcillin.
Blood cultures from [**Hospital1 18**] did reveal MSSA, but later in his course, serial surveillance cultures did not show bacterial growth.
No evidence of bacteria on gram stain of joint tap, but many negative biorefringent crystals consitent with a gout flare.
The cultures remained negative after the second arthrocentesis.
A few muddy brown casts were seen on urinalysis.
On for the patient's urine output remained stable and his creatinine returned to almost baseline and was 1.6 and his day of discharge.
An NGT was placed and 5-6 L of output was immediately seen.
The patient's chest x-ray was consistent with pneumonia.
The patient's oxygen requirements were weaned quickly and at the time of his transfer to the medicine floor from the MICU the patient no longer required supplemental oxygen.
His hematocrit stabilized around 23%.
We are recommending that the patient has surveillance hematocrits drawn while at rehabilitation to monitor for need for transfusion if his hematocrit just below 21%.
