His 11-hour operative course was significant for ~1800mL of blood loss, 8 liters of Crystalloid, 500mL of albumin and 2 units of pRBCs.

An ostomy bag was placed over the wound, with output > 1L/day.
This fluid was sent for creatinine, which was noted to be significantly elevated, highly suspicious for urine leak.
A CT Urogram was performed on [**2176-4-22**] which demonstrated extravasation of contrast around the ileal conduit.
On [**2176-4-23**], a loop-o-gram was performed under fluouroscopy in an attempt to localize the urine leak.
On [**2176-4-24**], a left antegrade nephrostogram was performed, which demonstrated that the left ureteroileal anastamosis was intact and without a leak.
On [**2176-4-26**], repeat L antegrade nephrostogram and L PCN removal was performed, which again demonstrated a leak that could not be localized.
At first, this drained significantly, and the fluid was sent for creatinine, which was consistent with urine.
In fact, creatinine checks of the abdominal drain after catheter decompression of the loop were NOT consistent with urine (all creatinines were <1.5).
The patient's urine leak was therefore managed conservatively with catheter decompression of the loop.
Multiple CT Urograms were performed to evaluate the urine leak, which reduced significantly before discharge.
Please check the pt's serum creatinine every other day.
