Chest X-ray ([**2185-4-22**]) - Increased interstitial opacities and tiny pleural effusions consistent with mild volume overload, stable cardiomegaly.
ECHO ([**2185-4-22**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-3-8**], inferior hypokinesis was present on both studies, but is more pronounced now.
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry of the right internal jugular vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge pressure catheter, advanced to the PCW position through an 8 French introducing sheath.

Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 6 mmHg and a mean PCWP of 16 mmHg.
There was a normal cardiac index of 2.2 L/min/m2.
CT Chest ([**2185-4-28**])- Most recent chest CT showed moderate-to-severe emphysema, extensive right pleural calcification, probably restrictive, mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, with particular left atrial enlargement possible chordopapillary calcification and probable pulmonary hypertension.
Today's examination shows new small bilateral, nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions layering posteriorly and new heterogeneous opacification predominantly in the lung that is dependent with the patient supine, particularly pronounced in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.
Discharge labs: Na 130, K 4.9 Cl 92 Bicarb 29 BUN 42 Creat 1.2 Hct 29, WBC 12.4 Plt 360   Brief Hospital Course: 83F with CAD s/p CABG with extensive native vessel diffuse s/p taxus stent to SVG-diag on [**4-20**], HTN, COPD, DM, presenting with unstable angina and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure and profound new hypoxia.
# NSTEMI: Patient with crescendo chest pain prompting admission and had NSTEMI with peak CK 428, MB 44 and TropnT 0.38.
It was decided not to proceed to cardiac catheterization given the recent cardiac cath showing no intervenable lesions and patient was started on ranexa for management of chronic angina.
Pulmonology was [**Hospital1 4221**] for further recommendations.
A Chest CT was performed that showed small bilat pulmonary effusions, mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and right upper lobe consolidation could be either pneumonia, hemorrhage, or edema.
Her COPD was well controlled on Advair and Spiriva.
#Hypertension: Patient's home blood pressure medications were uptitrated to achieve goal systolic blood pressure of 90-110. .
She should have blood sugar checks before meals with humalog sliding scale as ordered.
#Leukocytosis: Patient had a leukocytosis on admission with no clinical history to suggest infectious source, Urinalysis was negative, chest X-ray showed asymmetrical opacifications but not clear pneumonia.
She remained afebrile and white count trended down during admission without antibiotics.
# Decreased esophageal motility: Swallow evaluation initiated to assess whether silent aspiration contributing to hypoxia.
We started a new medicine, Ranexa, to help decrease the chest pain.
Torsemide: a diuretic to prevent fluid buildup 5.
