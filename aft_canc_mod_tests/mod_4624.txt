Radiology: [**2121-3-31**] CXR Pre-op: IMPRESSION: Right middle lobe linear atelectases/scarring with lesser involvement of the right lower lobe.
[**4-4**] CXR IMPRESSION: 1.
[**4-6**]: AP CHEST COMPARED TO [**4-4**]: Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusion, has increased substantially since [**4-2**], but may not have changed significantly since [**4-4**], allowing for differences in patient positioning.
The bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right and subsequent areas of atelectatic consolidations are unchanged.
[**4-11**] CT Torso: IMPRESSION: 1.
Chest Xrays were significant for bilateral pleural effusions.
The TPN was continued and daily electrolytes were followed.
She had been noted to have minimal pleural effusions on CXR from POD#0.
An AP CXR was done with a final read of moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions.
A repeat was done on [**4-7**] with PA and lateral views demonstrating near collapse of the bilateral bases.
Blood cultures were negative on multiple occasions.
A urine culture on POD#4 was positive for E. Coli that was ESBL-resistant but sensitive to Macrobid.
A repeat culture on POD#7 was negative.
A CT of the torso was performed on POD#9; no anastamotic leak was identified and no abscesses were seen.
Infectious diseases was consulted on [**4-12**]; they initially recommended empiric coverage with tigecycline given the previous urine culture data, but after further discussion the decision was made to continue observation.
