IMAGING: [**2158-3-23**] CT Torso w/ con: 1.
[**2158-3-24**] CT Head w/o con: No acute intracranial process.
[**2158-3-24**] CT C-Spine w/o con: 1.
CXR [**3-25**]:  Extensive bilateral consolidation in the lower lungs, right greater than left, most likely pneumonia.
Liver u/s [**3-25**]: 1.
Initial CT head was negative for acute process or for metastatic lesions.
CXR ultimately showed development of PNA, and sputum culture was positive for S. pneumoniae and H. influenza; thus, all abx but CTX were discontinued on [**3-26**].
#Community Acquired PNA: While initial CXR on [**3-24**] not concerning for acute process, subsequent CXR on [**3-25**] showed development of extensive bilateral consolidation in the lower lungs (R>L), most likely pneumonia in the setting of fevers and hypotension.
Sputum culture from [**2158-3-24**] was positive for S. pneumoniae and H. influenza, both penicillin-sensitive.
Neurology evaluation in [**11-30**] was c/w with L5/S1 sensory neuropathy as well as central issue (nystagmus, ataxia), possibly a Wernicke?????
MRI showed bilateral foraminal narrowing at L5/S1, with nerve impingement L>R.
Prior eval showed elevated TSH (which normalized two weeks after admission), normal RPR, elevated B12.
