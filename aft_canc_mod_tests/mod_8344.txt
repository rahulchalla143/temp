2 large bore IV's were placed and Hct was trended.
An area of arterial hyperenhancement seen in the distal ileum in the right lower quadrant, could represent inflammation (at the site of prior fistula) or active bleed.
IR was consulted and recommended a tagged RBC scan which was performed and did not reveal a source of bleed.
At this point she no longer had BRBPR and her Hct had stabilized.
On [**5-16**] she had a bowel prep and on [**5-17**] she had another colonsocopy which did not reveal a source of bleed.
She had a capsule endoscopy performed which also did not reveal any source of bleed.
