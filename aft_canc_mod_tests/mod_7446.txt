Doppler neg for clot, but CT (routine, restaging) revealed pericardial effusion.
Echo [**3-3**] revealed: small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion, most prominently inferolateral to the left ventricle and around the right atrium, but ~1cm anterior to the right ventricle.
[**3-5**]: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-3-3**], the pericardial effusion appears similar to slightly larger.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-3-5**], there is slightly less pericardial fluid anteriorly.
Biopsy documented HER-2/neu over expression by immunohistochemistry.
She was treated with Arimidex for six months, which was followed by Taxol and Herceptin.
Physical Exam: Blood pressure was 116/66 mm Hg while seated.
Pulse was 73 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 15 breaths/min.
The neck was supple with JVP of less than 6 cm.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th intercostal space, mid clavicular line.
Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: Labwork on admission: [**2177-3-10**] 04:15PM   WBC-4.2 RBC-3.40* HGB-10.8* HCT-31.0* MCV-91 MCH-31.9 MCHC-35.0 RDW-14.8 [**2177-3-10**] 04:15PM   PLT COUNT-161 [**2177-3-10**] 04:15PM   GLUCOSE-99 UREA N-12 CREAT-0.7 SODIUM-139 POTASSIUM-3.9 CHLORIDE-106 TOTAL CO2-25 ANION GAP-12 .
Labwork on admission: C.CATH Study Date of [**2177-3-10**]   *** Not Signed Out ***  BRIEF HISTORY: This 55 year old female with known diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer presented with pericardial effusion diagnosed on echocardiogram with significant respiratory mitral flow variation.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by a member of the nursing staff.
The right sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (mean RA pressure was 12mmHg and RVEDP was 12mmHg).
The left sided filling pressures were equalized to the right (mean PCW pressure was 12mmHg).
Repeat measurement of pericardial pressure and RA  pressure demonstrated clear seperation.
ECHO Study Date of [**2177-3-10**] Conclusions: Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-3-7**], there is now minimal residual pericardial effusion.
ECG Study Date of [**2177-3-10**]  1:00:10 PM Sinus rhythm Normal ECG Since previous tracing, no significant change .
ECHO Study Date of [**2177-3-11**] Conclusions: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-3-10**], the  inferolateral effusion is more prominent.
Labwork on discharge: [**2177-3-12**] 09:25AM BLOOD WBC-5.6 RBC-3.67* Hgb-11.9* Hct-36.0 MCV-98# MCH-32.3* MCHC-32.9 RDW-14.2 Plt Ct-185 [**2177-3-12**] 09:25AM BLOOD Glucose-108* UreaN-8 Creat-0.7 Na-136 K-3.7 Cl-104 HCO3-21* AnGap-15  Brief Hospital Course: 55 year-old female with metastatic breast cancer presenting with pericardial effusion.
Pericardiocentesis was performed with approximately 250 cc of serosanguinous fluid output and normalization of right heart pressures.
A pericardial drain was placed with 320 cc of serosanguinous fluid output the first 12 hours, then 75 cc over 6 hours, then no output.
A repeat echocardiogram showed a small pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade as above.
An echocardiogram the next morning showed stable small pericardial effusion.
Cultures were negative at the time of discharge and cytology was pending.
The patient will have a repeat echocardiogram five days after discharge and will follow-up with her oncologist.
The patient had a temperature to 100.8 the second day of admission.
Chest x-ray showed atelectasis but no new consolidations.
Urinalysis negative for infection.
Urine, blood, and pericardial fluid cultures without growth at the time of discharge.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable at 31-36 during admission.
The patient's iron studies showed an iron to TIBC ratio of 5%, although ferritin was within normal limits.
Further management deferred to the patient's primary physician.
You will need a repeat echocardiogram to assess for fluid reaccumulation.
Your oncologist should follow-up the urine, blood, and pericardial fluid cultures drawn during this admission.
