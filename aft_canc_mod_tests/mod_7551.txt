Studies revealed a right scapular mass which was found to be adenocarcinoma.
A workup for a primary tumor was inconclusive but revealed a spot on her lung which was felt to be the most likely candidate; a colonoscopy was incomplete, a virtual colonoscopy was negative but suboptimal, a capsule study was not done because of a hiatal hernia, and a mammogram was negative.
HRs ranging 90-120.
Labs revealed neutropenia 57% WBC 1.9 and hyponatremia (not as low as before).
Since she is on dagibotran a head CT was done which was negative.
A CXR showed a possible RLL opacification, blood cultures and urine cultures were drawn and she was started on vanc and merepenem (has a history of a cephalosporin allergy).

[**2129-10-28**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute large vascular territorial infarction.
[**2129-10-28**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) A single frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired.
Her right ventricular dilatation is though to be secondary to pulmonary hypertension, of which the etiology is unclear.
Blood cultures sent and were pending at the time of transfer to the floor.
These agents were discontinued after transfer to the oncology floor as she remained afebrile, tachypnea had resolved, vital signs were stable, and she was responding well to diuresis.
