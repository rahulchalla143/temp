Mediastinal contour is grossly stable and difficult to accurately assess on this portable AP chest radiograph.
TTE [**2159-3-17**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended to assess mitral valve morphology, exclude a vegetation, and better evaluate severity of mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-2-15**], LV is more dilated.
[**2159-3-23**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-21**], there may be some continued improvement in the mild pulmonary edema.
ECG [**2159-3-18**] The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular response and occasional ventricular ectopy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2159-3-16**] atrial fibrillation has appeared.
ECG [**2159-3-17**] Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2159-3-16**] no diagnostic interim change.
Diuresis with lasix IV boluses was initially limited by low BPs with SBPs in 70s-80s but BP improved throughout hospital course as he was diuresed with lasix gtt.
He bumped his creatinine on day of discharge from 1.7 to 2.3, so regimen was downtitrated to torsemide 60mg PO BID with no metolazone.
His admission weight was 106kg.

He was mentating well and was asymptomatic with SBP 80s-90s.
Goal INR [**2-20**].
# CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE: Creatinine trended up through admission likely from heart failure and decreased renal perfusion as well as diuresis.
Creatinine bump on [**2159-3-26**] likely related to starting low dose ACE as well as reaching limit of diuresis.
He required daily to [**Hospital1 **] potassium repletion and potassium levels will need to be closely followed on discharge.
