Moreover, on her latest head imaging, there were apparent bilateral chronic subdural hematomas along the bilateral hemispheric convexities, measuring 13 mm on the right and 14 mm on the left and L acute component without midline shift.
Head CT from OSH showed acute/chronic SDH with now midline shift.
