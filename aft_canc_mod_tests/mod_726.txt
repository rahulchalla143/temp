Cardiac makers were cycled due to precordial TWI, with a midly elevated troponin I at 1.10.
She was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization, which showed no focal lesions.
On arrival to the ED, T 97.1, BP 84/55, HR 94, 100% on 4L.
She was given 2L of NS, and SBP quickly improved to 100 and has remained there since.

Physical Exam: (Upon arrival to the floor) T= 97.8 BP=106/56 HR=103 RR=16 O2=97% GENERAL: Pleasant, thin, well appearing in NAD, HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic.

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
[**2183-2-6**] EKG - Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2183-1-6**] repolarization abnormalities are less apparent.
[**2183-2-6**] AP CXR - IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2183-2-7**] PA & LAT CXR - Nevertheless, the pre-existing bilateral opacities, likely to represent a combination of malignant and inflammatory disease, have increased in extent.
The cardiac silhouette is unchanged, the right pleural effusion is distributed in a slightly different manner, but its overall extent is unchanged.
Blood pressure medications were held in the ICU and on the floor and her blood pressure remained well controlled with SBP 110 - 140.
Given her stable blood pressure and tachycardia with ambulation, as well as known CAD, her atenolol was restarted on discharge.
EKG was without ischemic changes and cardiac markers did not rise above 0.03.
On the floor her wheezing improved on this regimen and she kept her oxygen saturation above 90% on room air with ambulation on the day of discharge.
As the patient's symptoms improved with transfusion and prednisone and she did not want anticoagulation, further evaluation for PE was not initiated.
# Anemia: The patient was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs for a hematocrit drop to 26.
She will have an outpatient lab draw 1 week following discharge with results faxed to her PCP to ensure that her anemia is not worsening.
Her creatinine returned to baseline in response to IV fluids.
Her UA was without evidence of infection or intrinsic renal dysfunction.
Ranitidine 75mg [**Hospital1 **] 2.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw CBC and fax results to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6443**].
We have stopped several of your blood pressure medications and your blood pressure has stayed in a good range.
- Stop taking ranitidine - Restart omeprazole - Take prednisone as prescribed to finish treating your COPD flare.
