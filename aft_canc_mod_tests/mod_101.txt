Interventional Pulmonary was consulted, and pt underwent flexible bronchoscopy with biopsies and BAL for micro.
A follow up repeat CXR was obtained, which showed an increase in the size of the pneumothorax, and therefore Interventional Pulmonary placed a pigtail catheter to treat.
Her pneumothorax remained stable with the chest tube in place, and the chest tube was removed on the day of discharge.
Her serum galactomannan and beta-glucan are negative.
All her culture data is negative to date, but final results are still pending.
# Lung CA - prior slow progressive adenoCA with now noted new, more aggressive squammous cell CA.
MRI head was performed, which did not show any e/o malignancy, and specifically did not show any leptomeningeal disease.
She will follow up as an outpatient for further evaluation and management of her malignancy, and follow up of pending bronch biopsies.
# Hyponatremia/SIADH Pt was noted to have hyponatremia on presentation, with sodium 126.
Urine studies were obtained, and confirmed the hyponatremia was consistent with SIADH.
She was discharged with recommendations for ongoing fluid restriction of 1500cc.
