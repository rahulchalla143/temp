Pt was noted to have a Hct of 17.8 on admission and due a history of recent GI bleed he was transferred to the ICU and give blood transfusions with an appropriate increase in his HCT to 30.0 which remained stable throughout his hospital course.
His Hct remained stable and he had no evidece of bleeding from his GI tract and he was transferred out of the ICU.
He did have evidence of a possible continued pneumonia on a CXR and he was continued on IV antibiotics while in the hospital.
Because of previous findings on blood work indicating a possible myelodysplastic disorder of some type we discussed the possibility of a bone marrow biopsy.
