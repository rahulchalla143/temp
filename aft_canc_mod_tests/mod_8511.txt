HR in 110s, EKG with LAD and RBBB, no priors for comparison.
Exam notable for LUQ, epigastric tenderness, +voluntary guarding.
Lactate 5.6, gotten 1.5L IVF now.
CXR shows pleural effusion +/- PNA, started on CTX and Azithro prior to CT chest.

Imaging: CXR prelim: Low lung volumes with elevated right hemidiaphragm and small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Diagnostic considerations include growing pleural effusion with associated atelectasis versus post-obstructive consolidation with accompanying pleural effusion.
Cross-sectional imaging may be considered for further evaluation.

PAST ONCOLOGY HISTORY: - presented with gross hematuria, urine cytology done [**2148-3-4**] was positive for atypical urothelial cells presented in clusters suspicious for urothelial cell carcinoma - [**2148-3-4**] CT abdomen/pelvis showed a large mass in the right renal pelvis consistent with urothelial tumor, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and indeterminate bilateral adrenal masses could represent metastatic disease.
- [**2148-3-25**] Biopsy of retroperitoneal lymph node mass was positive for high grade carcinoma, most consistent with urothelial origin - [**2148-6-3**]: CT Torso revealed the large mass in the right renal pelvis (5.5 x 4.7 x 3.7 cm) with encasement and narrowing of the collecting system, bilateral adrenal masses and massive retrocaval lymphadenopathy .

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2148-10-15**] at 1:44:57 PM FINAL  The left atrium is elongated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60-70%).
Close Hemodynamic monitoring was done and CVL, a-line in place.
# Right hydronephrosis with possible forniceal rupture: the most common etiology of renal forniceal rupture is obstruction caused by distal ureteric stones followed by malignant extrinsic ureteric compression of which the latter was likely involved.
Picture of high transaminitis + high LDH + elevated creatinine is classic for ischemic liver disease.
