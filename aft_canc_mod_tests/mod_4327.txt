His family reports thta they voiced their concerns to PCP but no imaging was done at the time.
He was brought to an OSH where a CT revealed right sided hemispheric edema of unclear etiology.

Overall, the findings are unchanged since the reference study from earlier today.
MRI HEAD [**4-3**]: FINDINGS: Given differences in technique, there has been no significant interval change in size of the large 7.5 x 5.2 x 5.2 cm right hemispheric mass resulting in severe mass effect with approximately 13 mm leftward shift of midline structures.
There is a small focus of susceptibility artifact within the posterior left temporal lobe, associated with hyperintensity as seen on the post-gadolinium MP-RAGE sequence, which may represent small volume of blood products, though an additional enhancing focus cannot be excluded.
CXR [**4-3**]: No previous images.
The cardiac silhouette is enlarged in this patient with intact midline sternal wires.
MRI Brain [**4-4**]: Pre-operative planning study with surface markers demonstrate rim-enhancing lesion.
CT head [**4-4**]: 1.
NOTE AT ATTENDING REVIEW: Clearly, MRI scanning will provide more accurate assessment of the true extent of tumor debulking than the present non-contrast CT scan.
CXR [**4-5**]: 1.
MRI brain [**2166-4-5**]: There is a large area of restricted diffusion, posterior to the tumor debulking site which involves the cortex and white matter of the right temporal lobe, suspicious for an acute infarct.
Following intravenous contrast infusion, there is also extensive enhancement, which suggests that the tumor was not completely removed.
CT head [**2166-4-9**] 1.
Though the initial diagnosis entertained was a hemispheric CVA, CT suggests an underlying mass.
MRI confirmed a right fronto-temporal contrast enhancing lesion measuring 6 x 5 x 5 cm with significant mass effect.
After extubation, detailed neurologic examination revealed worsening left paresis.
MRI of the head revealed a MCA infarct in the inferior division territory.
A PEG was placed by general surgery on [**4-11**], and tube feeds were successfully started 24 hours later.

These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
?You will need an MRI of the brain with gadolinium contrast.
If you are required to have a MRI, you may also require a blood test to measure your BUN and Cr within 30 days of your MRI.
