HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated in the previous discharge summary, the patient had been found to be in mild DIC after a decrease in hematocrit was noted, and an abdominal CT was performed which revealed multiple masses including bilateral adrenal masses.
The patient had ruled out for myocardial infarction, although he did have a positive cardiac history, and it ultimately became clear that the patient's chest pain was predominantly occurring after swallowing and generally was felt to be due to a chest wall mass or other metastatic disease, and the patient was sent for CT scan of the neck and chest to identify an appropriate location for biopsy of likely metastatic disease to identify the primary neoplasm after probable lymphadenopathy had been noted on the patient's left neck.
The patient went for CT scan of the neck which revealed abnormal, rounded, low attenuation focus in the left tonsilar pillar which may represent a neoplastic process versus abscess, abnormal low-density nodes on the right jugular chain consistent with necrotic nodes, possibly secondary to malignancy, bullous changes in the lung apices, as well as arterial plaque in the left common carotid.
The patient's chest CT revealed enlarged prevascular lymph nodes measuring 1.4 cm, as well as extensive bullous emphysematous changes of the right lung, and several bullae of the left lower apex, as well as nodular opacity of the left lung apex which could represent a scar or malignant process, and slight thickening of the distal esophagus,  Multiple findings in the abdominal cuts which were previously described included porta caval and ................ lymphadenopathy, and bilateral adrenal gland masses.
Additional stains were performed including .................. which was positive and .................. 20 which was less positive, as well as thyroid transcription factor which was positive, and this was felt to be consistent with possible primary lung neoplasm.
At their request, a head CT was performed on [**4-14**] which failed to show intracranial metastasis or other abnormalities.
Additionally, please note that the patient continued to be in DIC for the remainder of this admission and did receive ................... on [**4-10**] for a fibrinogen less than 100 which responded appropriately with a value over 100 on the following day [**3-11**].
The patient also required intermittent transfusions to maintain his hematocrit within the desired range of greater than 30.
