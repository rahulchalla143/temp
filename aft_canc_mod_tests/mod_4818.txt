EKG performed, unrevealing for acute event.
Neurological exam was performed which was fully intact except for foot drop on the left (chronic).

CT torso:  1.
Equivocal filling defect in a left lower lobe pulmonary artery, inadequately evaluated on this examination which is not targeted for evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature.
Further evaluation could be obtained with repeat chest CTA if clinically indicated.
CXR [**2160-7-26**]: FINDINGS:  The PICC line projects over the right atrium and should be pulled back 1-2 cm to be in the SVC- done.
The patient presented with a serum sodium of 117.
She was given 1.25L normal saline in the ED and her sodium rose to 120.
On the morning of [**7-17**] her serum sodium was 127, so IVF were stopped.
Later that morning it was 122, so 500cc NS were given.
RUQ US showed no significant change from prior, and stent confirmed to be in proper position.
Along with elevated transaminases, ALP, and total bilirubin, symptoms are attributed to significant tumor burden.
Her [**Location (un) 2274**] oncologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] was notified and agreed to hold off on chemotherapy.
CT torso final read showed equivocal left lower lobe opacity in branch of pulmonary artery, could not rule out PE.
CXR was repeated after hydration and raised possibility of LLL infiltrate, so she was started empirically on ceftriaxone & azithromycin on [**7-18**].
Her antibiotics coverage was narrowed to augmentin/azithromycin and then discontinued when repeat CXR showed no infiltrate.
Repeat bilirubin, UA, and C.difficile were unrevealing.
You also received a few days of antibiotics while we were investigating a possible pneumonia, but these were stopped when a repeat chest X-[**Hospital1 **] showed no evidence of pneumonia.
