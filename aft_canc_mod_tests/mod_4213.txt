On [**9-7**] she had a staging CTs which showed significant disease (stage 4 with mets to liver, bone metastases in the L1 and T12 vertebrae) as well as bilateral basal PEs.
Further work up demonstrated extensive bilateral lower extermity DVTs.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.3 94 111/68 20 97% 2L Labs and imaging significant for a CXR - IVC filter has migrated to the right ventricle.
Vitals on transfer were 98.0, 113/54,90, 27, 98%2LNC .
She was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**7-25**] and underwent CT imaging which reportedly revealed 2.2 cm right kidney cyst with no central enhancement, multiple pulmonary nodules and a L5 lucent lesion.
Repeat CT scan in [**7-27**] was then performed and showed infiltrating mass involving most of right kidney with extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
# Pulmonary embolism/IVC filter migration - Patient has known bilateral PEs and had anticoagulation stopped due to hematuria with IVC filter placed on [**9-20**].
CXR on admission identified migration of IVC filter to right ventricle.
She had a cardiac echo that did not show any valvular damage and her pacemaker was interogated and found to be adequetly working.
# Chronic Kidney Disease - The patients creatinine was elevated to 2.4 on admission.
Her creatinine trended down and was 1.1 at time of discharge.
Her lisinopril was held while in the hospital but as her creatinine normalized it was felt that she could resume her home dose at time of discharge.
She will need to have factor Xa level checked after for 3rd-5th dose.
She will also need to have a CBC drawn at that time.
