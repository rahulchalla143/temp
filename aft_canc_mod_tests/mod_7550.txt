Pt received further eval for primary site including RUQ US, upper and lower endoscopy, and thin sliced CT abd/pelvis with no primary source of cancer identified.
Pt received bone scan which revealed extensive uptake of tracer to left scapula, and also to right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**], left acetabulum, and right sixth rib which possibly represents osseous metastases.
Mammogram pending to evaluate for possible breast cancer.
LUE US showed non-occlusive thrombus, not getting anticoagulation.
# Difficulty ambulating: Xray of hip showed left iliac bone suspicious lytic lesion with cortical disruption pointing more to mets for cause of pain in hips.
TTE showed normal EF with dilated right ventricle.
She will have blood drawn as an outpatient to check her sodium (in addition to post-chemotherapy CBC).
This was started on the evening of transfer and sodium levels were checked q4hrs.
On transfer, sodium was 123.
The next morning after 15 hours of hypertonic saline infusion, her sodium rose to 128.
Sodium remained stable at 126 so saline was then stopped per renal recommendations.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: creatinine rise [**10-11**] to 1.5 up from .6- .8 prior to [**10-10**].
This increase correlated to when pt received IV contrast for CT scan therefore CIN suspected.
Pt received pacemaker evaluation [**10-4**] which indicated approx 20% pacemaker dependent.
Information was obtained from PatientwebOMR.
