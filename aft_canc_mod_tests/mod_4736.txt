In the ED, her initial vs were: T 97.4, P 75, BP 108/56, R 20, O2 99%.
She had a CTA, which demonstrated a small outpouching of soft plaque of the aortic arch, which could represent a penetrating ulcer in the wall.
She was thus admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) **] for tracheal and bilateral mainstem bronchi [**Date range (1) **] placements.
The procedure was complicated by migration of the tracheal [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was taken back to the OR for a repeat rigid bronchoscopy with creation of a piecemeal Y [**First Name3 (LF) **].
She was thereafter stabalized and was discharged home with supplemental O2 with a plan for a repeat bronchoscopy next week.

CTA CHEST W/ W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**1-14**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2102-1-13**]: Greater consolidation in the left lung is probably due to worsening aspiration, although new edema is seen in the right lung.
Her Hct has remained at her baseline of 33, and she had no further episodes of hemoptysis while in the ICU.
Interventional pulmonary performed a rigid bronchoscopy, which revealed a large volume of blood in the left lung that coould not be interevened upon.
Her cough was prdocutive of rust-colored sputum and she had no signs/symptoms of active bleeding for the remainder of the admission.
Patient's O2 sats were stable in the mid-ghigh 90s on 2L, and she did not desaturate with ambulation.
