--CT C-spine - Multiple lytic lesions seen in the occipital bones bilaterally and lateral mass of C1 --MRI L-spine - Degenerative changes seen in the lower lumbar spine with no evidence of nerve root compression.
She also had a hematocrit of 19 and then 15 with fluids with LDH 380, I. Bili 1.3, INR 1.6.
--CT ABD - Diffuse stranding in the mesentery, which could suggest infiltration by neoplastic process or fluid.
Pertinent Results: CXR [**2151-5-20**]: FINDINGS: There is interval increase in the left retrocardiac opacity with associated left pleural effusion.
CT Head: FINDINGS: No previous examination available for comparison.
These may be secondary to focal fatty sparing, however, given the history of lymphoma a CT or MRI is recommended for definitive characterization.
CT pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.

This corresponds to a left adnexal cyst seen on the recent CT exam.
Transvaginal examination was declined by the patient.
Further evaluation with MRI could be considered.
This exam is limited as the patient declined transvaginal exam.
During this admission, she was found to have a white blood cell count that was consistently trending upwards, even with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
After the patient had received approximately 14 days of broad-spectrum antibiotics, it was felt that this rising white blood count was likely secondary to reactive leukocytosis.
After treatment with CHOP chemotherapy, her white blood cell count begin to trend down from 55 and is now at 16 after chemotherapy.
The plan will continue with CHOP chemotherapy as the patient will be unable to take methotrexate with pleural effusion seen on CT scan.
Pt with need twice weekly CBC and chem 7 during rehab admission as Nadir will likely be around [**2151-6-23**].

DIC labs were sent and were negative.
Hematocrit was stable after receiving 4 units of PRBCs on admission.
The patient received 2 additional transfusions after CHOP chemotherapy for hematocrit less than 25.
HCT remained stable.
A transvaginal ultrasound was ordered; however, the patient refused this ultrasound.
She did allow a pelvic ultrasound, which showed a thickened heterogeneous endometrium and a left adnexal cyst was also noted.
OB/GYN was consulted, but the patient refused a pelvic exam and refused further workup at this time.
After further discussion with the patient she agreed to had biopsy and further work-up as an outpatient.
Old records were reviewed which showed that her heart rate had been in this range since her first admission in 11/[**2149**].
The patient received Lasix with transfusions and her heart rate did improve to between 80 and 90 after chemotherapy and decrease in white blood cell count.
Sputum cultures were negative.
The patient had C. diff checked x3 and all were negative.
She also had stool cultures sent for ova and parasites, Salmonella, Cyclospora, and Giardia, all of which were negative.
Her INR then trended back down to normal.
Electrolytes:  The patient had a creatinine that was trending up during this admission.
