Review of systems is positive for shortness of breath that has been present for two years, worse over the last few days and worse still this morning.
All other review of systems negative except as above.

Since the previous tracing of [**2190-1-24**] intra-atrial conduction delay is less prominent and further intraventricular conduction delay is present.
Specifically, there is no CT evidence of a large vascular territorial infarction, although MRI is a more sensitive test to rule out acute ischemia or infarction, particularly in the setting of extensive chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
MRI of head: 1.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2183-3-3**], LV function has significantly deteriorated (although on the left ventriculogram from [**2-/2183**] the LV function appears to be similar to today's echocardiogram).
Head CT did not demonstrate an acute intracranial hemorrhage, but head MR revealed numerous acute, bilateral, cortical infarcts, particularly in the area of the left precentral gyrus.
The patient's history and examination were consistent with a cortical stroke, resulting in a "cortical hand" and mild dysarthria.
Echocardiogram did not demonstrate thrombi, vegetations, or other masses, though there was moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.
EKG was notable for atrial and ventricular premature beats with LBBB, and telemetry revealed PVCs and runs of ventricular tachycardia.
Due to the bilateral nature of the infarcts and the presence of cardiac arrhythmias, the stroke was likely caused by thromboemboli of cardiac origin.
While hospitalized, the patient underwent swallowing evaluations, which revealed small amounts of aspiration while swallowing.
After a follow-up swallowing evaluation suggested advancement to PO nectar-thick liquids and soft solids, his PO diet was advanced appropriately, and his Dobhoff tube was removed.
Per family, his dyspnea has been long-standing and does not appear to have any clinical correlates including CXR and O2 saturation.
Patient's aspirin should be discontinued once Coumadin therapeutic with INR > 2.0.

Given the acute presentation and NIHSS score of 4, he received IVtPA and was initially admitted to the ICU.
His MRI showed multiple, bihemispheric strokes likely embolic etiology.
He was monitored on telemetry which showed multi-focal atrial tachycardia and PVC's hence cardiology was also consulted who recommended titrating up metoprolol as tolerated.
