Approximately ~45 minutes into procedure, the patient became hypertensive , rigid and unresponsive, with oxygen saturations falling into the 50s.
She was given hydralazine IV with improvement in her SBP from 2227 to 125.
She was noted to have a right sided neck mass after CVL placement (during which the subclavian artery was hit) and underwent an U/S which did not show a hematoma.
An arterial line was placed.

Tissue Biopsies of LUL pending on discharge  Brief Hospital Course: 80 year old woman with complicated PMH including broncheoalveolar carcinoma for which she was undergoing an elective bronchoscopy when she had an episode of rigidity, hypertension and desaturation attributed to a dystonic reaction to fentanyl and was subsequently intubated and in the MICU.
She subsequently maintained her oxygen saturations on room air.
Broncheoalveolar Cancer The patient successfully underwent bronchoscopy the day after her dystonic reaction and biopsy specimens were obtained of her LUL mass.
During her dystonic reaction her systolic pressure went as high as 225, she was given 10mg IV diltiazem with good effect and systolic pressure returning down to 125.
Subsequently her ICU course was complicated by lability in blood pressures, with systolics falling to the 80s with administration of propofol.
She was started on a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin for a complicated UTI, which grew out klebsiella that was pan sensitive (I to nitrofurantoin).
