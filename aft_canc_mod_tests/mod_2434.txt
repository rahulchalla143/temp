CT scan done at that time revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy, narrowing of the right lower lobe bronchi, and bilateral pulmonary nodules.
An echocardiogram revealed a pericardial effusion with some tamponade physiology.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs:  Temperature 99.4, heart rate 110, blood pressure 116/50, oxygen saturation 100% on a non-rebreather.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, with occasional rhonchi.
Deep tendon reflexes 2+.
LABORATORY DATA:  From the outside hospital on [**2181-5-22**], white count 12, hematocrit 30.8 down from 36.6 the day prior, MCV 87.8.
Pleural fluid:  Cloudy, yellow, pH 7.43, glucose 142, total protein 3.9, LDH 216, white blood cells [**Pager number **], red blood cells [**Pager number **], differential on that is 34 neutrophils, 31 lymphs, 10 monos.

Sodium 130, potassium 4.6, chloride 95, bicarbonate 29, BUN 11, creatinine 0.8, glucose 125.
INR 1.1, PT 12.2, PTT 23.3.
On admission to [**Hospital1 346**], pericardial fluid revealed 425 white blood cells, 2525 red blood cells, total protein 2.8, glucose 62, LDH 278, amylase 5, albumin 1.8, pH 7.43.
Pericardial Gram stain and cultures were sent.
White count 12.3, hematocrit 31, platelets 529.
ALT 99, AST 34, LDH 315, total bilirubin 0.4, alkaline phosphatase 464, calcium 8.3, magnesium 1.8, phos 3.5, albumin 2.2.

The patient and her husband were aware of the implications, and wished not to have aggressive measures taken on her behalf.
However, with regard to symptomatic relief, we note that the patient's shortness of breath had progressed during the hospitalization, and she underwent rigid bronchoscopy with stenting of the bronchi for symptomatic relief.
Subsequent to the hospital course as noted above, gross pathology and post-mortem analysis revealed that the patient had primary lung cancer, widely metastatic to multiple organ systems.
