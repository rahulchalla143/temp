Pathology: [**2-23**] sputum cytology pending .
Microbiology: [**2-23**] sputum AFB pending [**2-22**] urine culture pending [**2-22**] blood culture pending .
A single stricture that was 20 mm long was seen at the middle third of the common bile duct.
[**2-22**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**2133-10-30**], there is large area of opacification with apparent cavitation in the left mid zone.
An area of patchy opacification at the right and left bases also are seen, raising the possibility of multifocal infection.
[**2-23**]: In comparison with study of [**2-22**], the cavitary lesion in the left upper zone is again seen.
The multiple nodules seen on CT are difficult to appreciate.
[**2-24**] Chest CT: There are multiple pulmonary arterial filling defects, which appear acute.
In the right upper lobe is a probable bronchocele (2:24) adjacent to an area of consolidation (2:30).
Millimeter sized pulmonary nodules described on the prior examination are less evident on this study, probably subsumed in consolidations.
A long mid esophageal stent which contains fluid and debris, new since the prior study.
Although, this study is not tailored for evaluation of the subdiaphragmatic region.
There is probable soft tissue surrounding the celiac axis (2:60), but evaluation is limited on this early arterial study.
The patient has reported history of pulmonary emboli, but no prior imaging available at [**Hospital1 18**] to permit assessment of the progression.
Blood cultures were drawn and are pending at the time of discharge.
Blood cultures are still pending at the time of discharge.
This finding was first seen on chest xray and then next on chest CT and had not been previously visualized per report from his outpatient oncologist.
His sputum was sent for gram stain, culture, AFB stain, and cytology which were all pending at the time of discharge.
#Jaundice: ERCP suggests extrahepatic jaundice likely [**3-2**] known malignancy.
#Coagulopathy: INR elevated to 2.7 likely secondary to nutritional deficiency.
His dose was increased to twice daily to be restarted the day after discharge, when his INR would be less than 2.
