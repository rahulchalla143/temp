[**First Name (STitle) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**] MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 60% (nl >=55%) INTERPRETATION: Findings: LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Local anesthesia was  provided by benzocaine topical spray.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images were first obtained through the chest without contrast with a low-dose technique, followed by contrast-enhanced CT angiogram of the chest.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Again seen is a massively dilated inferior vena cava containing a large non-enhancing filling defect, which extends into the right atrium.
This has not significantly changed since the CT torso of [**2101-12-19**].
Although this examination is not tailored evaluation of the abdominal organs, limited images through the upper abdomen show unremarkable portions of the spleen and kidneys.
CT REFORMATS: Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial findings.
Large, nonenhancing filling defect within the IVC extending into the right atrium measuring up to 4 x 7 cm, which has not significantly changed in size since the prior noncontrast examination of [**2101-12-19**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
She was admitted to Cardiac surgery ICU started on heparin infusion, her cardiac enzymes as well as CTA were negative.
