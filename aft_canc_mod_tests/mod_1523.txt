His recent CD4 count was 702 and his viral load was 1060.
His work-up at the time was notable for significant retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy by CT scan.
Multiple CT guided percutaneous biopsies were performed and these were not diagnostic revealing follicular hyperplasia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 95.9 F.; blood pressure 126/68; pulse 72; respiratory rate 16; oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.
Two plus dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  The white blood cell count was 9.6, hematocrit 40.2, platelet count 325, INR 1.0.
Glucose 93.
BUN 18, creatinine 0.6.
AST 14, ALT 18; alkaline phosphatase 89, amylase 55.
Total bilirubin 0.4, direct bilirubin 0.1, indirect bilirubin 0.3.
His AFP was 214.3, which was up from 199.7 in [**2137-2-9**], and 110.7 in [**2137-1-12**].
The HIV viral load was 1,060.
IMAGING:  CT scan study obtained in [**2137-3-12**], revealed significant retroperitoneal, inguinal and pelvic lymphadenopathy.
The preoperative chest x-ray was within normal limits.
The preoperative EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 78 beats per minute.
The specimens sent included the lymph nodes as well as the left gonadal vein.
Intraoperatively, a Foley catheter was placed along with an nasogastric tube.
His postoperative creatinine was 0.8; his postoperative hematocrit was 37.7.
Approximately 700 cc of serous fluid were expressed and the patient was sent for a CT scan to evaluate fascial dehiscence.
Abdominal examination at this time revealed that the staples were intact, that the abdomen was soft, and that there was no erythema nor palpable masses at the incision site.
The CT scan did not suggest evidence of fascial dehiscence, although it did indicate that there were was a moderate amount of intra-abdominal ascites present.
The serous fluid was sent for evaluation, revealing a creatinine level of 1.0 and amylase level of 35 and a triglyceride level of 23.
The abdominal drainage persisted throughout postoperative day eight and postoperative day nine, although it diminished significantly on postoperative day ten.
At this time, it was felt that a repeat CT scan was not necessary and the patient was sent home on postoperative day ten with the visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with wound care and care of the abdominal drain and collection of the abdominal drain contents.
