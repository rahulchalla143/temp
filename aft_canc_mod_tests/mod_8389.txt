Patient with 2 month h/o hoarseness and dysphagia and neck CT showing node compressing R recurrent laryngeal nerve.
Abdominal and head CT were negative for metastatic dz.
A fib was rate controlled with beta blocker (metoprolol) and amiodarone.
She improved hemodynamically with increase of BP from 100/70 on admission to 130s.
Bronchoscopy showed no source of bleeding and presumed bleeding from aggressive suctioning.
On the night of [**2168-8-12**] patient fell and had a negative head CT (without contrast) with no events noted on telemetry.
Neurological exam was noted to be non-focal.
In the evening she was responding to yes/no questions by shaking head but not opening eyes.
Stat repeat head CT was negative for hemorrhage.
4 pm ABG 7.38/77/54 on 50% trach mask and at 6pm 7.41/67/53 on 60% trach mask.
Of note, pt serum bicarb had been increasing from 30--->40 at time of second admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Metastatic work-up: CT abd and pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1.
Correlation with physical exam and patient status is recommended to exclude a pathological bowel perforation.
New right pleural effusion and aspiration-like changes at the left base since the prior chest CT. 3.
However, evaluation of the pelvis is limited by tracer activity within the bladder.
Non-small cell lung cancer--CT chest showed a 0.9cm spiculated nodule in the R apex as well as extensive mediastinal LAD.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and a biopsy of the R supraclavicular node was obtained, which showed poorly differentiated non-small cell lung CA.
A swallow study at this time found Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] to be at great risk for aspiration of liquids, so she was kept on a soft solid diet with no liquids.
Metstatic work-up for staging was done, including a bone scan, head MRI and abd and pelvic CT-all of which were neg for mets.
Mental Status Change   Pt with fall on [**8-12**] and head CT at that time was negative for hemorrhage.
Stroke is unlikely as patient with two interval head CTs that were negative and an TTE was negative for bacterej[.
Urine/blood tox screens sent [**2168-8-15**].
XRT was initiated in the hopes that the mediastinal LAD would be decompressed with resultant improvement of VC paralysis.
On [**7-20**], it appeared that her VC were reapproximating, making airway closure almost inevitable.
COPD/Pleural effusion/Respiratory failure--Mrs[**Last Name (STitle) **] COPD flared during the course of her hospitalization.
Her O2 sats on this regimen remained stable in the 95-99% range.
She had a thoracentesis to remove 1L of fluid on [**7-23**].
Her goal PTT was 60-100 sec.
Anticoagulation was bridged on [**7-22**] and Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was to be sent to Rehab on coumadin with a goal INR of 2.5-3.5.
The HIT Ig came back negative, but given the time course, lack of other etiologies, and rebound of platelet count once off heparin, HIT seems likely.
FEN--After the swallow study noted that Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was at great [**Doctor First Name **] for aspiration, it was determined that she would need a PEG tube for feeding.
She received a PEG on [**7-15**] and received promote with fiber advanced to a rate of 50cc/hr.
Her electrolytes were monitored and repleted as necessary.
The culture came back coag negative staph, and the vancomycin was stopped.
Pt will require levofloxacin until [**8-22**], at which time she should have additional blood cultures drawn.
If positive or if pt becomes febrile, she may require a TEE for evaluation of endocarditis, given mitral replacement.
)Atrial fibrillation -- Pt's rate was well controlled on amiodarone and metoprolol.
Continue rate control, follow Hct (keep above 28).
Started on epogen for support, goal Hct > 28.
