Compared to the previous tracing of [**2107-4-4**] the ventricular response is faster.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-4-12**], mitral regurgitation is now less prominent.
His 02 sat was 92-94% on 2L.
The patient mounted an appropriate response to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test (14.6->28.5).
TSH and FT4 were within normal limits.
He has a history of afib with RVR in the setting of acute illness in the past.
Mixed venous O2 Sat was high, suggesting distributive shock.
His home metoprolol was held in the setting of hypotension while requiring levophed for blood pressure support.
He was transfused 2 u pRBCs on [**4-26**] per Cardiology who felt the patient was intravascularly volume depleted, and started on amiodarone.
His heart rate came down from 110s-130s to low 100s.
After his blood pressure stabilized, he was restarted on metoprolol which was uptitrated from 12.5 TID to 50 TID.
His heart rate was atrial fibrillation with rate 80s-100 on the day of discharge.
The rehab center should continue to titrate metoprolol as his blood pressure will tolerate for a goal rate of 70s.
CT abdomen-pelvis was negative for any drainable abscesses and showed improvement of his ruptured appendix.
His MRSA screen was also positive.
Follow up cultures were negative.
KUB was negative for ileus or obstruction.
On the 3 days prior to discharge, the patient's sodium was 150, he received 500cc bolus of D5W, then sodium was down to 146 the next morning.
His sodium remained at 150 the following morning.
Renal did not feel that lasix was indicated and felt that the patient's sodium should be managed with free water.
His sodium levels will continue to be monitored at [**Hospital1 7510**] MACU and D%W should be given as needed.
At the time of transfer to the floor the patient had an excellent urine output off all diuretics and his creatinine had improved markedly.
On the floor his creatinine stabilized at 1.2-1.3, his urine output was 40-60cc/hr.
Admitted with HCT in the high 20s, stable after 2 u pRBCs on [**4-26**].
Upper extremity ECHO showed a clot.
PAtient's TTE showed signs of likely pumonary embolism, but given the patient's creatinine CTA was not possible.
