# Severe sepsis: Patient admitted with fevers, hypotension and found to have klebsiella and enterococcus growing in blood cultures at [**Hospital3 **].
Subsequent blood cultures cleared at [**Hospital1 18**].
It was felt that her cholangitis was the source of her bacteremia.
They suggested that her outpatient providers could consider repeat abdominal CT scan to r/o septic phlebitis or abscess in liver after abx course over; however, if she decides to pursue palliative care with her oncologist this will not be necessary (read below)  #Cholangitis:  Presented initially with fevers, abdominal pain, and hyperbilirubinemia.
Her bilirubin trended downward after the procedure, and was 4.6 on the day of discharge.
However, her alkaline phosphatase trended upward and was above 437 on discharge.
Pt had brown, guaiac positive stool, so given her recent fragmin use, may have a slow bleed.
Hematocrit was stable at [**Hospital1 18**] after transfusion of two units of PRBCs and was 29.5 on discharge.
CT from [**Hospital1 **] on day of admission reportedly shows extension of tumor burden, and this is also suggested by ERCP.
Her fragmin will be held, per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], as she is at risk for large GI bleed given guiaiac positive stool, and as her care will likely proceed in a palliative direction given tumor extension on chemotherapy.
When we checked finger sticks, sugars were consistently below 200, and mostly under 150.
# Pleural effusions:  Seen on CT scan.
She was seen by the Interventional Pulmonary Service and they did an ultrasound which demonstrated pleural effusions too small to tap.
Cholangitis 2.
