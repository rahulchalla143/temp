Upon arrival to the CCU, EKG demonstrated regular wide complex tachycardia with LBBB pattern, no visible pacing spikes.
EKG from [**2-/2130**] (prior to PPM) demonstrates LBBB with same morphology.
Repeat EKG demonstrated rate of 112 with same QRS morphology and visible pacing spikes.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Pulmonary artery pressures are indeterminate.
FURTHER IMAGING STUDIES: Carotid series [**2134-1-19**]; Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid arteries.
In the remainder of the vessel, the peak systolic velocities are 40, 304 in the CCA, ECA respectively.
CT Head without contrast [**2134-5-25**]: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of midline structures, or hydrocephalus.
Carotid Series [**2134-5-25**]: The sensitivity of the exam on the right is severely limited by a complex heavily calcified plaque that creates acoustic shadowing.
CT Neck without contrast [**2134-5-25**]: 1.
No significant change compared to [**2134-4-26**] chest CT in blastic focus of the sternum, presumably a prostate metastasis.
Scarring and architectural distortion of the right upper lobe, similar to the recent chest CT of [**2134-4-18**].
This is consistent with the study from [**2134-1-16**].
Thoracic aorta: Aortagraphy revealed a Type II arch without critical lesions.
Cardiac Cath [**2134-5-27**]: 1.
Resting hemodynamics on dopamine 12 mcg/kg/min demonstrated initial right and left heart filling pressures (RVEDP 5 mm Hg, PCW mean 7 mm Hg), with markedly decreased pulmonary arterial oxygen saturation of 33% and a depressed cardiac index of 1.64 l/min/m2.
After the administration of 250 cc 0.9% saline and decreasing  dopamine to 6 mcg/kg/min, increase in pulmonary pressures and LV filling pressure were seen (PCW 11 mm Hg) with increased cardiac index of 2.23 l/min/m2.
After further administration of 250 cc 0.9% saline (total 500 cc), there was marked abnormal elevation of pulmonary pressure (mean 36 mm Hg) and PCWP (mean 22 mm Hg), and a decrease in the cardiac index to 2.01 l/min/m2.
Decreased LV and RV filling pressures consistent with hypovolemia.
CXR [**2134-5-27**]: In comparison with the study of [**5-5**], the patient has taken a much better inspiration.
Renal Ultrasound [**2134-5-28**]: No hydronephrosis and no cysts or solid masses identified.
CXR [**2134-5-29**]: There has been interval placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter with distal lead tip in the distal right pulmonary artery.
CXR [**2134-5-30**]: The Swan-Ganz catheter, pacemaker is unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: 83yo gentleman with h/o CAD, chronic systolic heart failure with EF 15%, AFib not on coumadin, s/p PPM admitted with recurrent episodes of transient neurological deficits.
The patient's blood pressure was labile during his procedure and he required dopamine to maintain his pressures upon transfer out of the cath lab.
Swan ganz demonstrated that the patient was dehydrated and he was given fluids for volume resuscitation.
# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation s/p PPM: Digoxin was held given recently elevated levels, but digoxin levels trended up in the setting of his heart failure.
