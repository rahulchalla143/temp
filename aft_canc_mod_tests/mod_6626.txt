Full mobilization of the stomach and porta hepatis with D1 lymphadenectomy.
Biopsy of the GJ junction revealed focal intestinal metaplasia most likely secondary to Barrett's, and antral biopsy showed chronic active gastritis with organisms consistent with H.Pylori.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2169-3-31**] tracing remains normal.
Compared to the previous tracing the sinus rate has increased.

Previous biopsies:    [**Numeric Identifier 86289**]  GI BIOPSIES (3 JARS).
Immunohistochemical stain for Helicobacter is negative with adequate controls on blocks X and Y. Accessory spleen, 0.5 cm.
MICROSCOPIC Histologic Type:  Signet-ring cell carcinoma (greater than 50% signet-ring cells).
[**2169-4-15**] CT ABD: IMPRESSION: 1.
The perisplenic and left flank fluid collections are rim-enhancing suggestive of infection.
If there is further concern for leak, CT with oral gastrografin can be considered.
Previously visualized free fluid throughout the abdomen has now organized into three rim-enhancing fluid collections, which are suspicious for infectious as described above.

On [**2169-4-5**], the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, full mobilization of the stomach and porta hepatis with D1 lymphadenectomy, total gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy and placement of J-tube, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
On POD # 5, patient underwent upper GI study which was negative for leak and his diet was advanced to sips of clears on POD # 6.
ID/Infected Hematoma: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Prior discharge, On POD # 7, patient spiked low grade fever, his blood and urine were sent to microbiology and they were negative.
He continued to spike fever and CT was obtained on [**2169-4-15**].
CT demonstrated  Perisplenic and left flank fluid collections concerning for hemorrhage, likely due to splenic laceration, the perisplenic and left flank fluid collections were rim-enhancing suggestive of infection.
On [**4-17**], patient's HCT dropped from 30 to 26 and patient's tachycardia increased to 150 s. The patient underwent abdominal CTA on [**4-18**], which demonstrated anterior aspect splenic artery pseudoaneurysm and increased parasplenic hematoma.
The patient's pseudoaneurysm was coiled at the same day and his pigtail drain was changed to 12 French from 10.
The patient received 8 units of pRBC and 4 units of Plasma during and post procedure, his post transfusion HCT was 38.1.
JP amylase was sent on [**4-19**] and was high ([**Numeric Identifier 86291**]) concerning for possible leak.
On [**2169-4-20**], patient underwent upper GI check which was negative, but TF was held and patient started on TPN.
On [**4-25**] repeat Upper GI swallowing test was negative for leak and TF was restarted.
Repeat abdominal CT on [**4-28**] demonstrated decreased rim-enhancing perisplenic hematoma concerning for continued infection and sigmoid colon thickening suggestive of colitis.
Patient's HCT was stable and no intervention were required at that time.
Gram stain was positive for gram negative and gram positive growth and patient was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn.
The patient's cultures came positive for E. Coli, Staph.
On [**5-5**] patient underwent abdominal CT, which demonstrated new hematoma is seen in the left lateral abdominal wall at the insertion site of the pigtail drain, decrease in size of the perisplenic organized hematoma and questionable fistula between the descending colon and the inferior fluid collection.
Piperacillin-Tazobactam 4.5 g IV Q8H 10.
