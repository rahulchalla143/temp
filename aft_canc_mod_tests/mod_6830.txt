Surgery was technically successful with minimal amount of blood loss.
Due to worsening acidosis, pt was not extubated and was thus transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for furthur monitoring.
Baseline creatinine 2.8.
Gait assessment deferred PSYCH: Listens and responds to questions appropriately, pleasant    Pertinent Results: Lactate: 2.4->0.8 ABGs 7.24/40/180; 7/12/50/215; 7.26/34/124 WBC 21.4 (30 on discharge on [**2-28**] on hydroxyurea) HCT 25.5 (27.7 on [**2-28**]) PLT 533 (recently 90s-200s) .
STUDIES: Echocardiogram [**2181-2-8**]:  LVEF 55%, 1+ TR, 1+ MR .
V/Q scan [**2181-2-17**]:  multiple subsegmental matched perfusion defects, no unmatched perfusion defects, indeterminant result .
Cause was likely multifactorial: 1) Renal insufficiency with baseline bicarb 18-20, non anion gap acidosis; 2) Bowel prep likely decreased bicarb to 15; 3) Increased dead space due to pulmonary disease (DLVA elevated, expired CO2 during surgery showed Dead/V 40%) causes "usual" settings to cause CO2 retaining.
No acute changes in expired CO2 thus do not expect operative PE as etiology of increased dead space; 4) Perioperative lactic acid elevation also contributed with tiny anion gap elevation.
He was discharged off of oxygen with his oxygen saturations at their baseline.
This medication is used to control the patient's WBC count and off the medication it rose to 25.
The patient will have his CBC checked on Monday with the results sent to his oncologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**].
-Have your CBC checked on Monday with the results sent to Dr. [**Name (NI) 6588**] office.
-Try to maintain ostomy output between 1000mL to 1500mL per day.
-If Ostomy output >1 liter, Call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**].
