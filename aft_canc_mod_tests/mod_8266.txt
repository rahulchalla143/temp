[**2128-6-7**] CT abd/pelvis: 1.Decreased size of the left flank hematoma compared to previous CT. Gas overlying the hematoma from recent paracentesis raises the question that the bloody fluid obtained was sampled from the hematoma.

Arterial enhancing lesions are seen in the liver on this study which was not designed for multiphasic evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course: 54M history of hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis not on transplant list and ascites with frequent therapeutic abdominal taps, with a recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] for expedited liver transplant evaluation in setting of hepatic encephalopathy, elevated Cr and elevated PA pressure on TTE, presenting with worsening abdominal pain and distension with transient hypotension from OSH found to have VRE infected left flank hematoma likely iatrogenic in setting of multiple recent paracentesis performed with elevated INR.
He was initially admitted to MICU GREEN with relative hypotension (SBP 80) and did not require pressor support.
His blood pressure improved to SBP 90-110s with colloid resuscitation.
His hypotension may be due to interventricular dependence with septum bowing  into the LV resulting in decreased LV cardiac output and resultant hypotension.
An ECHO was performed that did show a new [**Doctor Last Name **] and ?
In the MICU, pressors were considered, but the pt's blood pressure was initially managed with albumin, and pressures were not used.
He had a recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] for expedited liver tranpslant evaluation in setting of hepatic encephalopathy, elevated Cr and elevated PA pressure on TTE.
Per OMR notes, however, it appears this workup has been halted at least temporarily because of his severe pulmonary hypertension for which he is recently seeing a pulmonologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] Additionally, he is known to have multiple liver lesions in multiple segments on both sides of the liver, highly suggestive of HCC and with an AFP of 248 ([**3-/2128**]) and 148 (6/[**2127**]).
CTA of chest also showed ?
GIB Hgb decreased from 8 to 7 on [**2128-6-16**].
PE was ruled out by LENI and CTA PE protocol.
The patient was not candidate for transplant and, therefore, would not benefit from interventions such as dialysis, intubation, or resuscitation which would likely be futile given his poor prognosis.
