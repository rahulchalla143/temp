Intra-op course was complicated by 750 cc blood loss and hypotension requiring 1L NS, 2 units of PRBCs.
Patient subsequently hypotensive with SBP in the 80s despite receiving 2L IVFs.
She was transfused another 1 u PRBCs and 1 L NS and her SBP recovered to 120s.
Upon return from OR her SBP remained stable in 110s.
Limited examination for detection of subtle fracturs due to diffuse extensive metastatic disease.
Subacute fracture through the left greater trochanter and left iliac crest, better evaluated on the CT of [**2128-6-12**].
CT head.
Left hip MRI showed an avulsion fracture of the greater trochanter and an iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] fracture, both of which were subacute.
Delerium was thought to be due to benzos, opioids, and anxiety of surgery.
Otherwise exam is nonfocal and unchanged from the past.
Furthermore, the patient developed a rising [**Known lastname **] count and CXR could not rule out a retrocardiac opacity, suggesting that PNA could be contributing to delerium.
A head CT did not show an acute cause of mental status changes.
MRI of the lumbar spine confirmed there was no change from previous MRI of the spine and showed NO cord compression.
Her cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated following surgery and her post-op EKG showed ST depressions in the setting of hypotension.
Patient became edematous following surgery because she was given a significant amount of fluids to keep her blood pressure and urine output stable.
