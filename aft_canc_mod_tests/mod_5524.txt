At that time, a PET/CT scan showed no evidence of FDG activity within the lesion.
Subsequent CT scans demonstrated growth in the lesion, which is nearly doubled in size overall.
A recent PET/CT scan obtained in [**2193-6-25**] demonstrated FDG uptake within both right upper lobe nodules as well as two small lymph nodes adjacent to the left parotid gland.
He underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2193-7-16**], which showed no endobronchial lesions, and a bronchoalveolar lavage was nondiagnostic.
He subsequently underwent a CT-guided fine needle biopsy on [**2193-8-2**], which confirmed the presence of an adenocarcinoma consistent with bronchoalveolar type.
He  specifically denies chest pain, hemoptysis, cough, chest pain, fevers, chills, sweats, recent pulmonary infection, weight loss,  anorexia, or new neurological or new musculoskeletal complaints.
Physical Exam: T 98.8  P 78  BP 114/58  R 20  SaO2 95% RA Heent - pupils are equal, round, and reactive, sclerae are anicteric, no supraclavicular or cervical adenopathy.
Lungs - clear to auscultation bilaterally, equal.
Lymph - no axillary or groin adenopathy.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted and had a right thoracoscopic right upper lobectomy, cervical mediastinoscopy with biopsy, mediastinal nodal dissection, and flexible bronchoscopy which he tolerated well.
An ecg showed no acute changes.
He was transfused 1 PRBC for a HCT of 26 on [**12-22**] and given lasix.
