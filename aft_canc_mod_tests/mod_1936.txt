HIP X-ray ([**2172-6-22**]):There is a intertrochanteric fracture without significant displacement of the bony fragments.
OLD STUDIES: -bone scan ([**5-2**])  The described findings are consistent with possible metastases to the ribs.
-echo ([**7-/2166**]) Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with some sparing of the basal posterolateral wall.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
[**Street Address(2) 1766**] depression in V4-V5 and TWI in V4-V6.
Since his admission, the patient has had difficulty with control of his Afib, which prompted a trigger on [**6-22**] PM for HR 130-150.
He responded to 10mg of metoprolol, with HR decreasing to 90-100 bpm.
Because his INR was elevated from the coumadin, he received 2u FFP initially, then another 5u FFP in the OR.
His hct had also come down since admit, so he was given 2u PRBCs on [**6-23**] and an additional 3u PRBCs in the OR.
Also in the OR, he had about 600cc IV crystalloid in, 200cc EBL + 640cc urine out.
Upon return to the medical floor, he was found to be somnolent and in rapid Afib with VS of T 97.3, BP 140/80, HR 160 irreg, RR 22, 100% on 3LNC.
In the code, he was found to have electrical HR 150-200 bpm, though only perfusing at a pulse rate of around 60 bpm.
His pressure was maintained with SBP 130-140 mmHg.
It was difficult to obtain a pulse ox [**Location (un) 1131**], and by the time one was obtained he was satting 100% on a NRB face mask.
His lungs sounded wheezy and with crackles, and once the OR record was reviewed, he was ordered for a CXR and 40mg IV lasix (on 20mg PO at baseline).
An ABG was obtained on the NRB: 7.50/32/180.
Initially, he was to receive Narcan, but after the ABG, deep suctioning, and a venous blood draw, he became more alert and no longer apneic.
CXR showed increased pulm edema on L side.
A repeat UA will need to be done by the nursing home.
His blood pressures remained stable and Lisinopril was titrated up to 40mg.
The results of the ortho biopsy are still pending at discharge.
