In the ED he underwent a CTA to r/o PE, and a CXR was done which showed increase in left lung base opacity.
While on the floor, the pt was noted to be febrile, tachycardic and pale, BP in low 100's systolic.
Oncologic history: Developed abdominal pain, back pain, and anorexia in [**2101-4-19**], and noted to have a large abdominal tumor on CT scan; he went to the OR for operative management, and the tumor was discovered to be hemorrhagic with wide involvement of several organs.
Imatinib dose was increased until PET scan performed approximately two weeks later showed no significant change in FDG uptake in the tumor, at which time he was started on Sutent (started [**2101-6-1**]; 4 week on, 2 week off).

Air fluid level within the abdominal mass, worse since prior exam.
Abdominal radiograph:A non-obstructive bowel gas pattern with air noted distally within the [**Month/Year (2) 499**] and excreted contrast like layering within the urinary bladder.
A few small air-fluid levels are noted within the left upper quadrant as noted on the CT, probably within the GIST and stomach.
Micro: Blood cultures x 4 - Negative to date        Urine culture - no growth        Abdominal wound GS & culture: GRAM STAIN (Final [**2101-7-12**]):       1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2101-7-14**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from the       site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus       aureus and beta streptococcus).
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
Given a Hct drop to 21.1, he was transfused with 2u PRBCs with HCT increase to 26.7.
On [**7-17**] received another blood transfusion for low HCT, which responded well.
Cultures showed multi-bacterial colonization of abdominal wound site, while blood and urine cultures were negative.
CTA was negative for PE.
Onc wished to evaluate treatment with abdominal CT and/or PET scan.
Pt's family declined CT because unsure of utility at this time.
