AWAIT CULTURE RESULTS.
IMAGING CXR [**12-31**], wet read: continued pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions, overall stable in extent since the prior.
11/24 [**12-27**] 11/18 [**12-15**] [**12-11**]  EKG [**12-28**]: Artifact is present.
11/21 [**12-9**] [**12-8**]  ECHO [**12-27**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
11/10 [**12-12**]  CT CHEST [**12-18**]: 1.
Several small lung nodules could be post-inflammatory lesions, unusually small for active pulmonary Wegener's granulomatosis, but if the patient's clinical situation is unstable, I would repeat a chest CT in four weeks to monitor them, and I would not be surprised if most or all of them disappear.
Kidney biopsy [**12-15**]: Pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis in the setting of ANCA positivity  Skin biopsy [**11-27**] left chest -Squamous cell carcinoma in situ, extending near but not seen at the examined specimen margins.
CARDIAC CATH, right heart [**12-12**] 1.
Elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure consistent with moderate left ventricular diastolic heart failure.
SKELETAL SURVEY [**12-11**] 1.
RENAL U/S [**12-9**] 1.
CT head [**12-8**] No acute intracranial process.
However, his creatinine continued to fail to improve and on [**1-2**] the patient received a session of hemodialysis and a permanent tunnelled catheter.
Pericardial effusion  the patient was found to have a large pericardial effusion on echo and a friction rub, which was thought to be uremic with possible hemorrhagic component given supratherapeutic INR on admission.
By discharge this had largely resolved clinically and by echo with treatment of patient's kidney injury and Wegener's.
Skeletal survey revealed no lytic lesions.
Significance unclear - possible that antibody of MM is pathogenic antibody for Wegener's - at least conceivable.
Mycobacterium Avium Complex AFB on Bronchoalveolar Lavage Latent Tuberculosis Isoniazid Hepatoxicity  Patient had a history of TB with treatment in sanitarium in [**2052**]'s  Bronchoscopy with BAL was performed on [**12-23**], and AFBs found on smear.
The patient was started on RIPE, however subsequent testing including quantiferon gold and genetic probe on smear were negative for mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Diabetes patient was switched to glargine from previous regimen of NPH with good control of his blood glucose while inpatient.
TO BE FOLLOWED OUTPATIENT 1) PREDNISONE - on 50 mg daily, renal to set the taper time 2) COUMADIN - restart when stable for Atrial Fibrillation 3) Dialysis dependence?
Biopsy showed lots of active inflammation 4) Cytoxan-Resistant Wegener's ?
