LENIS [**11-25**]: No evidence of DVT.
CTA Chest [**11-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Head CT [**11-26**]: PFI: Acute hemorrhage in the region of fourth ventricle mass resection with resultant significant hydrocephalus.

The remainder of the examination including chronic microvascular infarction in bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular white matter, with bilateral basal ganglia chronic lacunes, as well as predominantly left parietovertex scalp subgaleal hematoma, is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: 1.Status post recent suboccipital craniectomy with resolving post-surgical changes, including hematoma at the tumor resection bed and slight improvement in the findings of obstructive hydrocephalus.
