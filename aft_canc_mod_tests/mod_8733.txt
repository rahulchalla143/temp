CXR [**8-13**] AP-ETT placement FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 1.5 cm above the carina.
Need final reads on other us  Echo [**8-15**]: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-2-11**], the findings are similar.
The RV appears mildly dilated and hypokinetic on review of the prior study images.
CXR [**2135-8-19**] Note is made that the original dictation was lost and the study was brought to our review today on [**2135-8-20**], approximately around 4:00 p.m.
ECHO [**2135-8-24**]: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
CXR [**2135-8-25**] Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement.
PRELIMINARY ECHO REPORT AT TIME OF [**Month/Day/Year 894**] (ECHO FROM [**2135-8-25**]) Results  Measurements  Normal Range Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness:  0.8 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness:  0.8 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm  Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  50% to 55%  >= 55%  Findings LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Pulmonary emobolism was considered, and although the patient had negative lower extremity ultrasounds, he was empirically started on heparin for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE).
After his renal failure improved (see below), he was CT scanned which was negative for a PE, and his heparin drip was discontinued.
His blood cultures came back positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus, and his antibiotics were weaned down to cefazolin.
Patient continued to require PEEP amounts between 10 and 16 cm of H20 for oxygen saturations between 86 and 92 percent.
Hypotension: Initially presented with blood pressures with systolics in the 90 mmHg range.
Echo performed showed normal systolic function, with mild dilation and mild global free wall hypokenesis.
On [**Hospital1 **], his diuresis with furosemide was resumed, but his metolazone was still held.
Given the low dose medications (lisinopril 2.5 mg and metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]), they were discontinued in house while as his HR remained around 80 beats per minute and his blood pressures were around 130mmHg systolic.

He will need clinical evaluation to determine when to resume metolazone.
Speech and swallow was consulted who said the patient will need further evaluation first for a Passy-Muir valve, and then further speech and swallow evaluation to deterimine if he can receive PO feedings.
Thus, a dobhoff tube was placed to provide the patient with tube feedings and a route for oral medications while speech and swallow evaluation should be on going at rehabilitation.
