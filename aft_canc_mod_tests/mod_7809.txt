Further characterization could be obtained with MRI.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The CD containing images from the prompting OSH study is not available to me.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-4-22**] 1:27 AM IMPRESSION:  2.2 x 1.8 x 3.7 cm complex heterogeneous mass with hemorrhage and enhancing tissue in the fourth ventricle, with mild mass effect on the posterior aspect the medulla, which could represent an unusual ependymoma, lymphoma or a focus of toxoplasmosis with hemorrhage.
Pathology Examination  Name Birthdate    Age     Sex Pathology #     [**Hospital1 18**] [**Known lastname 92331**],[**Known firstname 1575**]       [**2138-7-8**]    45 Male      [**Numeric Identifier 92332**] [**Numeric Identifier 92333**] Report to:   DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Gross Description by:   DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Specimen labeled "4th ventricular lesion #1":  Subependymoma (WHO grade I).
Specimen labeled "4th ventricular lesion #2":  Subependymoma with hemorrhagic infarction (WHO grade I).
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-4-26**] 2:15 PM  IMPRESSION: A tiny amount of residual enhancement is likely vascular.
An MRI on [**4-22**] revealed a complex heterogeneous mass in the region of hemorrhage, and he was pre-opped for the OR.
Pt was scheduled for a post-op MRI on [**4-24**], which was not done because of radiology concerns about the MRI safety of the EVD.
On [**4-25**] his drain was clamped, and the CT head 24 hrs later was stable; the EVD was then d/c'd and he had his post-op MRI on [**4-26**].
YOU WILL NEED AN MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH GADOLIDIUM BEFORE THIS APPOINTMENT.
