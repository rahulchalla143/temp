Was seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3-4**] with these complaints and exam was notable for bibasilar rales, R>L LE edema.
CXR was done which showed a new right pleural effusion and vascular congestion.
TTE was performed on [**3-6**] which showed mild concentric LVH w/ normal left and right ventricular fx (EF 65%), PA systolic pressure of 30 mmHg, a small pericardial effusion w/o evidence of tamponade.
He was seen in f/u clinic when exam was notable for new tachycardia to 110s, BP 130/60, O2 sat of 92%, and [**1-12**]+ edema in R lower leg with JVP of 6 and pulsus of 5.
He was sent to the ED for evaluation of possible DVT/PE.
Exam was notable for mildly tachypnea and a mildly swollen RLE with a positive [**Last Name (un) 5813**] sign.
Patient underwent CTA of the chest which showed bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the right upper, middle, and lower segmental vessels and the left lower lobe segmental branches.
There was no CT evidence of R heart strain.
CT was also notable for a R pleural effusion, pulmonary nodules, and hilar/mediastinal LAD.
Patient was guaiac negative and started on a heparin gtt w/ bolus and admitted to the MICU for further management.
VS on transfer were: 148/73 100 20 92% on 2L.
Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP 6 cm at 30 degrees, no LAD CV: Tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Decreased BS in R base 1/3 up with dullness to percussion; no wheezes or rhonchi Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: Foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation, gait deferred Skin: well healed surgical incision in left mid axillary line;  Physical Exam on discharge: Vitals: Tm 100.1F, Tc 99.9.
No dullness to percussion Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, no cyanosis, no edema   Pertinent Results: [**2178-3-9**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) FINDINGS: No previous images.
Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal size.
[**2178-3-6**] CT Chest: 1.
[**2178-3-6**] ECHO ([**Location (un) 2274**]): TTE ([**3-6**]- [**Location (un) 2274**]): 1.
Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).
The right ventricular systolic function is at the low normal.
Estimated PA systolic pressure, calculated from peak TR velocity, is 30 mmHg above RA pressure.
MICROBIOLOGY:     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2178-3-10**]):       ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE COMPLEX.
Piperacillin/tazobactam sensitivity testing available on request.
A small focus of slightly increased signal intensity in the left parietal bone posteriorly on the FLAIR and DWI sequences -suspicious for osseous lesion- correlate with non-contrast CT Head and Bone scan.
Bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral pulmonary nodules as discussed on recent CT chest.
Comparison with prior imaging is recommended for probable hepatic cyst andindeterminate 9mm splenic lesion to evaluate for stability.
Pt's O2 sat was 91-94% on room air, but desaturated to 87-89% during sleep.
Most recent CT scan [**2176-10-11**] without evidence of hilar mass.
Pt had imaging including CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis, MR head, and bone scan with no clear metastatic disease, but extensive malignant disease in the chest w/ hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy and signs of lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
If effusion analysis is negative for malignant cells, Pt may have further workup with biopsy.
Fluid labs showed: RBCs [**2166**], WBCs 1075, 25% pmns, 33% lymphs, 2% monos, 8% mesos, 30% macros, 1% other.
Protein 3.1, Glucose 143, LD 154, cholesterol 57. pH 7.53.
Low suspicion for XR since CT chest did not show infectious process.
Urine culture on [**3-7**] grew 10-100k Enterobacter cloacae pan-sensitive except nitrofurantoin.
Blood cultures from [**3-7**] showed no growth to date.
Further oncological workup will depend on cytology results as described above.
-[**Month (only) 116**] need repeat imaging to assess treatment of pulmonary emboli.
-Pt has a retrievable IVC filter which should be removed as soon as his staging / biopsy procedures are completed.
[**Month/Year (2) 108422**] AC 10-100 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Five (5) mL PO every four (4) hours as needed for cough: Do not drive or operate machinery on this medication.
Disp:*qs 1 month mL* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Bilateral pulmonary emboli Lung mass Right pleural effusion Right leg deep vein thrombosis Urinary tract infection   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were found to have multiple blood clots (pulmonary emboli) in your lungs and a blood clot in your right leg.
You had a filter placed in your inferior vena cava to prevent further blood clots from migrating to your lungs.
This fluid was sent for cellular studies, which are still pending.
You had several imaging studies that were requested by your cancer doctors, and they will discuss the results with you.
