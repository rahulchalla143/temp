Work-up of right leg weakness included MRI thoracic and cervical spine that show only mild degenerative changes and chronic T9 compression fx.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch bilaterally.
Coordination: finger-nose-finger and rapid alternating movements decreased on right  Handedness Right   Pertinent Results: [**2159-8-22**] CT Head at 15:00: The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy approach resection of a left parafalcine meningioma as demonstrated on the preoperative examinations.
[**2159-8-22**] CT Head at 19:00: FINDINGS: Again are noted post-craniotomy changes from a left frontal approach with skin staples and a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema.
A significant amount of bifrontal pneumocephalus is noted, similar to prior study with displacement of the frontal lobes and extending into the middle cranial fossae.
A few enhancing areas are noted in the surgical resection site and residual tumor cannot be excluded.
The ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are otherwise unremarkable, except for mass effect by the blood products in the surgical resection site in the left lateral ventricle.
Followup evaluation to assess interval change and confirmation of the nature of the abnormality is necessary.
[**2159-8-24**] Head CT at 01:00: IMPRESSION: Increased intracranial hemorrhage on the left, now involving the frontal and parietal lobes.
[**2159-8-24**] Head CT at 08:00: IMPRESSION: Stable intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontal and left parietal lobes, with associated surrounding edema and mass effect, unchanged from prior study.
[**2159-8-24**] Head CT at 14:00: IMPRESSION: No significant interval change from prior study.
[**2159-8-26**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in comparison to prior study from [**2159-8-25**] with extensive left frontoparietal multifocal parenchymal hemorrhages with a possibility venous infarction laterally and significant moderate amount of surrounding edema and stable mass effect.
[**2159-8-30**] CXR IMPRESSION: No interval change of small bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis.
Post operatively she was taken to the CT scanner for a CT of the head to evaluate for any post-operative hemorrhage.
the CT showed that she had bled into the resection cavity.
A repeat scan was obtained 3 hours alter which was improved from the prior.
She underwent MRI scan of the brain to assess the resection cavity post-operatively which showed complete resection.
Serial CT scans showed intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontal and left parietal lobes, with associated surrounding edema and mass effect.
On [**8-26**], her exam was worse and her SBP was pressed 120-140; there was difficulty in doing this because of her bradycardia.
On [**8-27**] her exam was stable and she was not following commands.
On [**8-28**] she continued with the EEG which showed some spikes so her Keppra was increased.
On the morning of [**8-29**] on rounds she was noted to be following commands with the LUE and opening eyes to voice which was an improvement in exam over the past few days.
Right Upper extremity Doppler was performed on [**8-30**] due to swelling and demonstrated only a superficial thrombus was discovered, no evidence of occlusive DVT.
EEG showed seizure activity and we increased dilantin to 200 tid.
She was without seizure activity on EEG and her neuro checks were made Q2 hrs.
Her neurological exam plateaued.
Additional family meetings were held between the ICU attending and the family on [**9-3**] and between the Neurosurgery attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the family on [**7-25**] to discuss the options of tracheostomy and PEG in the setting of poor neurological prognosis.
