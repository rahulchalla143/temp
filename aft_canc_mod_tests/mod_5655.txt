EKG ([**2165-8-4**]):  Rate is 134, a fib with RVR  CT chest/abdomen ([**2165-8-5**]): Markedly degraded image quality due to patient body habitus.
CTA Chest ([**2165-8-9**]): The technical quality of the exam is severely limited and allows only for evaluation of the central pulmonary arteries, and the current CT does not reveal any evidence of central pulmonary embolism.
US of abdominal soft tissue ([**2165-8-9**]): Unremarkable ultrasound examination of the superficial tissues in the right upper quadrant.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably low normal (LVEF 50-55%) but views are suboptimal for assessment of this.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-11-5**], the abnormal septal motion consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload may be new but images are suboptimal for comparison.

An upper endoscopy was preformed by GI which showed diffuse continuous atrophy of the mucosa with no bleeding noted in the stomach.
She subsequently had a CT Torso with PO contrast which showed no acute intrabdominal process but was limited by body habitus.
Her bleeding slowed down as her INR was reversed with FFP and Vitamin K.      After her Hct was stable and bleeding was controlled, she was transferred to the floor.
Her INR remained somewhat elevated in the 1-1.5 range despite being off Coumadin.
A repeat transvaginal US was obtained during this admission which was unable to comment on uterine dimensions but again noted calcified fibroids, including a submucosal fibroid.
Initial labs in the ED revealed a PTT of 150 and INR >19 without history of heparin containing products.
Pt received FFP and Vitamin K in the ED and her INR corrected to 1.2 in the MICU.
INR remained mildly elevated around 1.2-1.5 despite being off of Coumadin for many [**Known lastname **].
CT abdomen was unrevealing for acute process, she was seen by surgery which did not feel this was an acute issue possibly related to calcified fibroids.
After arrival to the floor, her LFTs were elevated with AST>ALT, a Tbili of [**2-20**].2 and high alk phos and LDH.
#Congestive hepatopathy - The unifying diagnosis that is believed to be causing the above issues, coagulopathy, bleeding and abdominal pain is congestive hepatopathy.
A TTE obtained prior to discharge showed evidence of elevated right-sided pressure with evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
Her HR remained below 100 with this increased dose of metoprolol.
# Pneumonia:  Patient had a temperature of 99.9 in the setting of an elevated white count and sputum culture which grew E. coli.
BNP at admission was 2342, no other recent BNPs for comparison.
Her blood glucose remained below 200 and she did not regularly receive insulin.
