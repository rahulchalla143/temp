Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction, ejection fraction of 55% and symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
IMAGES:  X-ray revealed acute fracture in the midshaft of the right humerus with distal segment angulation medially.
There was concern that the fracture was due to pathologic fracture given the presence of bone lesions seen on a bone scan; however, the lesions were not in the exact region of the fracture.
The patient was given 1 U packed red blood cells.
The patient was weaned off Neo-Synephrine and transferred out of the SICU where he was stable but with low blood pressure, off blood pressure medications, requiring 2 L nasal cannula.
The patient was slowly started on ACE inhibitor to maximize cardiac output in the setting of congestive heart failure.
Across this time, the patient was noted to be thrombocytopenic, and platelets were stable in the low 60s to high 50s.
