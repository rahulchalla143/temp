She underwent rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debridement and balloon dilatation on [**2175-9-12**] that was complicated by post-procedure hypoxemia requiring intubation in the OR.
A repeat bronchoscopy was performed on [**9-13**] to remove clot and continue debridement with argon plasma coagulation laser that resulted in opening the left mainstem with a residual 50% airway obstruction.
Sputum culture grew S. Pneumoniae, and left lung continued with haziness consistent with evolving pneumonia.
A flexible bronchoscopy with a detailed assessment of the glottis revealed severe post-extubation laryngeal edema and vocal cord trauma that explained the difficult airway.
Pathology of the tumor was still pending at the hour of death, with a high degree of certainty that the patient had a diagnosis of Stage IIIA lung cancer.
