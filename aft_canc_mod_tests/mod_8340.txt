IMAGING: CT head showed no acute intracranial pathology but this was the motion degraded study.
CT of the cervical spine:  No cervical spine fracture, subluxation or prevertebral soft tissue swelling; however, the DJD changes at C5-C6 place the patient at a greater risk for cord injury and if needed an MRI could be obtained.
hip x-ray showed no fracture.
CT torso showed infiltrates and effusions at both lung bases, small  amount of ascites.

Heparin Dependent Antibody positive ([**2171-2-10**]) .
Pertinent Imaging TTE ([**2171-2-6**]): Moderate sized mass on the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve which is consistent with vegetation, tumor, or thrombus.
ECG ([**2171-2-10**]): Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2171-2-6**] no diagnostic interval change.
MRI ([**2171-2-10**]): Multiple foci of restricted diffusion, distributed in both cerebral hemispheres as described above, the possibility of septic emboli and thromboembolic ischemic events are considerations.
TTE ([**2171-2-12**]): Aortic valve vegetation with moderate associated regurgitation.
CXR ([**2171-2-13**]): In comparison with the study of [**2-12**], the tip of the endotracheal tube now lies approximately 4 cm above the carina.
MRSA bacteremia: Positive blood cultures on [**2171-2-3**] @ [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] with positive surveilllance culture on [**2171-2-4**] and no growth on blood cultures since [**2171-2-5**].
TTE showed moderate vegetation and 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] of 50% which has stayed stable on TTE on [**2171-2-12**].
MRI head significant for > 20 foci concerning for septic emboli to brain which might have caused his acute agitation leading to his intubation at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**].
Cardiac surgery was consulted early but have decided not to intervene surgical due to multiple comorbidities along with septic emboli to his brain which would not be able to handle heparin load during open heart surgery.
CT abdomen/pelvis done on [**2171-2-13**] showed no intra-abdominal abscess, although study was limited without IV contrast.
His creatinine has continually increased to max of 3.5, concerning for septic emboli to kidney versus ATN vs volume depletion (though urine lytes not consistent with prerenal state).
Anemia: Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Stool guiaic has been negative along with hemolysis labs.
Pt received one blood transfusion on [**2-6**], and a second on [**2-13**].
Differential also includes emboli to the liver but CT abdomen without contrast did not show any abscess vs amiodarone toxicity.
Stool softener 13.
