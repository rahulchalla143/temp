She had a repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**2118-6-29**], which preliminarily showed hypoplastic marrow consistent w/ suppression from medication (suspected to be due to valgancyclovir, see below).
For now, Pt will need continued filgrastim 480 mcg sc on Mon and Thursday, with 2x weekly CBC with differential.
Pt will need continued cyclosporine levels weekly with results faxed to primary oncologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21962**].
Fevers resolved and blood cultures cleared with addition of Daptomycin and Aztreonam and replacement of her central line.
Other infectious sources, including UA and CXR remained normal.
Follow-up CT scan done [**5-27**] shows worsening of pulm interstitial and ground glass, but patient clinically much better.
She continued to do well clinically, but developed acute renal insufficency with a gradual rise in her creatinine from 1.0 to 2.2 over the 2 weeks she recieved foscarnate.
Interval Chest CT on [**6-17**] showed dramatic improvement in her pulmonary infiltrates.
A CMV resistance genotype was sent and was negative for any resistant mutations.
Given her continued need for valgancyclovir, Pt will need filgrastim and 2x weekly CBC (see below).
The patient was started on a 1L fluid restriction, but continue to have persistent hyponatremia.
However, later during her admission, Pt's sodium was still low but her hyponatremia was in the setting of [**Doctor First Name 48**] and appropriately dilute urine (low osms).
Pt's hyponatremia was resolved and sodium was stable by discharge at ~135, although pt continued to have mild diuresis.
CT head on [**5-21**] had no acute intracranial changes.
She should see neurology for possible uptitration of her medications as an outpatient since her latest EEG showed some minor epileptiform activity, although she is currently asymptomatic.
She was maintained supportively and her creatinine reached a max of 2.0 before returning to baseline of 1.0 on [**5-27**].
On [**6-1**] her creatinine was again noted to be elevated in the setting of foscarnate administration for refractory CMV infection as described above.
Pt's creatinine on discharge is 1.7.
A venous free calcium was sent and returned elevated at 1.5 confirming hypercalcemia.
PTH was inappropriately elevated at 29, but not felt to be the primary driving mechanism of her hypercalcemia.
Various efforts to control her hypercalceima were trialed including diuresis with lasix, calcitonin, phosphate binders and promindronate none of which substantially reversed her hypercalcemia which was felt to be driving her symptoms of constipation, abdominal pain and lethargy.
Her calcium was finally controlled after receiving IV palmindronate.
Pt will need 2x weekly calcium and albumin levels (to calculate corrected calcium).
[**Month (only) 116**] need to increase dose as BP has been 130s-140s/60s-80s.
UA on [**2118-7-5**] showed WBC 85, RBC 33, no bacteria.
Urine culture pending at the time of discharge.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -needs 2x weekly complete blood count with differential -needs weekly CMV viral load -needs 2x weekly cyclosporine levels -monitor 2x weekly chemistry panel, calcium and albumin for sodium, Cr, Ca -outpatient MIBI parathyroid scan -outpatient neurology follow-up to further uptitrate anti-epileptics / consider further seizure treatment as needed -needs continued filgrastim 480mcg sc on Mondays and Thursdays -urine culture from [**2118-7-5**] results still pending  Medications on Admission: acyclovir 400 mg PO q8hrs clonazpam 0.5 mg PO BID levetiracetam 500 mg PO BID lisinopril 20 mg PO daily oxcarbazepine 900 mg PO BID paroxetine 5 mg PO daily docusate sodium 100 mg PO BID  Discharge Medications: 1. clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
