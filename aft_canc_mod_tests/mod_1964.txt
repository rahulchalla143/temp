HD was discontinued early after 1.5 hrs due to tachycardia, noted to be in rapid AF 150-180, BP initially 102/72, given 10mg IV diltiazem, became hypotensive to 80s.
He had two attempts at DCCV, wtihout success then started on diltiazem drip with HR improving to 90-100s, started on neo and levophed for BP support.
Head CT, chest CTA performed.
Physical Exam: VS: T 97.4, BP 124/53, HR 86, RR 16, O2 sat 96% on 4L NC Gen: elderly AA male in no acute respiratory distress, moderate discomfort with movement of R leg.
Neck: Supple with JVP no visualized as pt lying flat.
Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated AF with ventricular rate of 68, nl axis, no LVH, no ischemic changes, ST depression noted on previous EKG resolved.
Compared with the prior study (images not available for review) of [**2176-6-10**], the findings are similar.
An echocardiogram was obtained to look for structural abnormalities, showing mild [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1915**], mild symmetric LVH with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Thyroid function tests were normal.
He was noted to have some intermittent runs of A.fib or atrial arrythmia, but HR was well controlled on Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] & Metoprolol 25mg TID.
# Chest pain - Pt was admitted with c/o chest pain & was evaluated with cardiac enzymes which were not elevated from baseline.
CTA of chest in the ED showed no evidence of PE or dissection.
X-rays obtained were neg for fracture & pelvic/lower extr CT showed DJD but no e/o fracture.
BP was well controlled and these agents can be restarted as needed while outpt.
Ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed.
