MICROBIOLOGY: [**2116-12-30**] URINE CULTURE:  <10,000 organisms/ml.
[**2117-1-1**] SPUTUM (ENDOTRACHEAL): GRAM STAIN (Final [**2117-1-1**]):       >25 PMNs and >10 epithelial cells/100X field.
Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper respiratory       secretions.
Bacterial culture results are invalid.
[**2117-1-2**] STOOL C DIFF TOXIN: Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
IMAGING: [**2116-12-29**] CHEST X-RAY PA/LAT: FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
[**2116-12-31**] CTA CHEST: TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images through the chest were acquired before and after administration of intravenous contrast.
Subcarinal lymphadenopathy measuring 2 cm is stable (4:27).
This study is not optimized for evaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures.
Residual oral contrast is seen in the colon.
[**2116-12-31**] MRI HEAD: COMPARISON: MR head dated [**2116-11-16**].
TECHNIQUE: Given the patient's inability to cooperate, the study was limited and no contrast enhanced images were obtained.
FINDINGS: Given the patient's inability to cooperate, a limited study without gadolinium was acquired.
Judged by sagittal T1 images, the cerebral sulci, ventricles, and extra-axial CSF-containing spaces have normal and stable configuration.
ACUTE ISSUES: # Hypokalemia/hyperaldersteronism: Patient's presenting symptom was progressive weakness over the weeks prior to admission, with subsequent decreased PO intake.
He was found to have low potassium at PCP's office and referred to ED where K was 2.6.
He was repleted aggressively with both oral and IV potassium, but potassium levels remained low during this admission.
On CT imaging during this admission, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia was present.
Lab values and imaging were thought to be consistent with hypercortisolemia from bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, which was likely secondary to an ACTH-secreting tumor.
After initiation of treatment, cortisol levels decreased substantially to range 60s-100s.
With potassium repletion, levels ranged in the low to mid-3s.
The patient's delirium was also better-controlled with correction of hypercortisolemia.
For continued desaturations likely secondary to diaphragmatic fatigue and possible bronchospam, patient was found to be hypercarbic (pCO2 109, pH 7.14), intubated and transferred to the ICU.
His bronchoscopy was negative for infectious etiology.
It was not felt to be secondary to infection,  since his bronchoscopy was negative and he recovered with medication changes.
Palliative Medicine was helpful in constructing a home regimen to maximize comfort; this included lorazepam 1mg PO q6 hours standing, lorazepam 1mg PO q4 hours PRN and morphine 5-10 mg PO (elixir) q2 hours PRN pain/dyspnea.
