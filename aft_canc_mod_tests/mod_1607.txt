She was initially started on avelox for RLL infiltrate on CXR and leukocytosis to 13.
A rapid response team was called on [**5-21**] for mental status changes, blood pressure of 90/40, HR 49, RR 20, O2 sat 79% on RA improving to 100% with NRB.
EKG showed sinus brady, no acute ischmemic changes.
BS was 248.
She was also given lasix 60 mg IV (previously received IVFs for Na 122, Cr 2.9 from 2.0 on admission), solumedrol 80 mg IV x1.
She was also transfused 2 or 3 units PRBCs for HCT 22.3 (from 31.1 on [**5-12**]) with IV lasix 20 mg. She was having episodes of anxiety/agitation requiring haldol 2 mg IV x2 and ativan 1 mg IV x2.

Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is consistent with pleural fluid.
The nodular opacifications seen on CT are difficult to appreciate on this plain radiograph.
[**5-25**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-24**], the pulmonary vascularity has somewhat decreased.
TTE [**2197-5-26**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
The pt's troponin peaked at 1.39 and trended down on labs on [**5-24**].
ECHO on [**5-23**] could not rule out a focal left ventricle wall motion abnormality.
In the MICU, the pt was originally on heparin IV for presumed NSTEMI; however, this was discontinued afted 24 hours as the pt's troponin trended down once the pt's heart rate and hypoxia were treated.
The pt never endorsed chest pain and besides atrial fibrillation with rapid rate on telemetry during the first 24 hours of the admission, the pt had no other abnormalities on telemetry.
# Anemia: Was transfused at OSH prior to admission here; however, HCT was stable without transfusion during admission.
Goal Hct > 30. .
The patient's blood pressure remained stable, then gradually became increased.
The patient was discharged on the increased dose of metoprolol and amlodipine alone for blood pressure control.
Secondary Diagnoses: Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation History of stroke Major depression with psychosis Dementia Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Hypothyroidism Type 2 Diabetes Chronic Renal Insufficiency Seizure disorder Peripheral vascular disease h/o erosive gastritis s/p cholecystectomy s/p hysterectomy Lung lesions suspicious for lung Ca Recent strep bovis infection, colon biopsies showed adenoma.
