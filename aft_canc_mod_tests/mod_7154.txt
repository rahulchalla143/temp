[**2194-6-24**] CT Abdomen and Pelvis W/O Contrast Moderate-to-severe left hydronephrosis, with abrupt transition at the ureteropelvic junction.
If there is continued clinical concern for obstructing mass, evaluation would be best performed with MR urography.
Cardiomegaly, anemia, and evidence of chronic lung disease.
Further evaluation with CT or MR urography would be the next step in evaluation if clinically indicated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with at least Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
[**2194-6-25**] CTA Chest No pulmonary embolism.
[**2194-6-25**] CT Head No acute abnormality.

Bone marrow biopsy Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by: a CD5 positive B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
Hepatitis viral serologies were negative, parvovirus IgM, and HIV AB's negative.
Hemolysis labs on admission were negative, no evidence of TTP on peripheral smear.
He was given DDAVP, plts, and PRBC for blood loss.
His oozing from lines resolved eventually and his hct remained stable for 24 hours prior to transfer to the floor.
Heme-onc has been following and a bone-marrow bx was performed on [**2194-6-25**].
Lung lesions Patient underwent a CTA on [**2194-6-25**] to r/o PE as he developed sudden-onset tachycardia and hypoxia.
This was negative for PE and his symptoms were likely [**2-21**] volume overload from blood products.
A sputum cx was also ordered, but the patient has not produced any to give an adequate sample.
On [**2194-6-28**], his foley stopped draining any urine but his bladder scan demonstrated 400 cc, foley did not flush.
Blood was noted around the meatus at that time.
EKG with [**Date Range **], lateral depressions - per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] old.
TTE demonstated global hypokinesis, AI, MR, and an EF of 40%.
# Positive U/A - patient is on day 3 of ciprofloxacin, urine cx grew staph, however without significant growth.
