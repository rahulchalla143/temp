In the ED, initial vitals were 97.7, HR 130, BP 132/66, RR19, 96% RA.
Blood and urine cultures were sent.
An initial lactate was 4.0.
A CT scan was performed and did not show any drainable abscess from her left axilla.
Past Medical History: # Metastatic Melamoma - [**2162-2-8**], underwent an excisional biopsy for what was felt to be a 7.2 thick, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level IV, nonulcerated melanoma with 10 mitoses/m2 on her left shoulder.
She underwent a wide local excision and left axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy on [**2162-3-12**] with pathology revealing melanoma in 4 sentinel lymph nodes with evidence of extracapsular extension.
She underwent a completion left axillary node dissection on [**2162-3-26**] with pathology showing no melanoma in 3 lymph nodes identified.
Subsequent head MRI showed multiple CNS metastases.

Final acceptable pain regimen was 6-8 mg dilaudid q3h prn, Fentanyl Patch 150 mcg/hr TP Q72H, methadone 10mg q8h, naproxen 500mg tid prn, Lidocaine 5% Patch 1 PTCH TD DAILY, Neurontin 100qAM/100qPM/200qHS, and duloxetine 30mg daily.
Respirations were as low as [**11-20**] at points, but was never pathological.
MRI brain showed small new mets c/w melanoma, also stable demyelinating disease.
Pan Spinal MRI showed intrinsic signal abnormalities within the spinal cord secondary to multiple sclerosis, as well as diffuse bony metastatic disease, with no evidence of cord compression seen.
Unclear source for an infection, as CT showed no axillary abscess and all cultures either negative or with NGTD.
Cultures and radiology from that date were also negative.
EKG not indicative of cardiac origin.
Abdominal exam benign with no signs of radiating origin.
Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): hold for bsp <100, hr <50.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17 gram (100 %) Powder in Packet Sig: One (1) Powder in Packet PO daily ().
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): hold fpr SBP<105, HR<55  .
We did an MRI of your spine which showed diffuse bony metastases which were likely causing your pain and weakness.
This scan showed a few new small lesions that were unlikely to be responsible for the confusion.
