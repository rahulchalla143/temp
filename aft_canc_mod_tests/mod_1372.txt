Rather, her transfusion requirements were similar to those she experienced as an outpatient.
Abd CT showed an enlarging splenic infarct.
Her mental status slowly improved over the course of her MICU course such that she was responsive and more alert upon call out to the floor but still only A and O x1.1 _______________________________  #Lower GI Bleed - Patient was initially admitted for the hospital for passing blood clots mixed with stool.
She was continued on IV flagyl for her CDiff colitis, which was thought to be a possible source of her bleeding.
Her HCT started trending down and there was noted to be a few clots and some blood mixed with the stool.
Colonoscopy only showed multiple diverticuli and internal hemorrhoids, both of which were thought to be possible sources of her GI bleeding.
A repeat MRI was performed which showed an interval increase in embolic phenomenom as well as a subacute on chronic hemorrhage.
Repeat echo was performed to evaluate embolic strokes.
Furthermore, her optical density value is 0.45 and the cut-off for a positive test result is 0.40.
#Coag Neg Staff Endocarditis - On past admission, the patient had 4/4 bottles positive for coag neg staff.
TTE at the time was negative for vegitations.
Repeat Echo done on current admission still did not show any vegitations.
On this admission, a new area of destruction of cortex of the medial portion of the left ilium was seen on CT Abd.
A swallow study completed showed that she would be able to safely tolerate ground food and thin liquids.
