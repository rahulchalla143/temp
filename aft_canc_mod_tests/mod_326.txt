BP transiently dropped to 70/41 but improved with 1L IVF and 1u pRBC.
CXR showed worsening pulm congestion with possible right sided PNA.
BNP 3000.
EKG showed NSR, 1st degree AV block, NA w Q in III and aVF and STD I aVL and slight ST elevation in II and aVF, TWI V1-V3.
Given that the working diagnosis was volume overload, he was given 20 mg of IV lasix with a resulting drop in blood pressure to 80's systolic.
At time of evaluation, BP 80/40, HR 100, RR 20, 87% on 5L NC, 96% on NRB.
ABG obtained at that time revealed pH 7.45 pCO2 34 pO2 111 HCO3  24.
JVP= 10cm LUNGS: Bibasilar crackles [**1-15**] way up.

Hypoxia:  His CXR showed volume overload.
His fluid overload was thought to be secondary to the prednisone he was taking in conjunction of his study drug.
His  fluid balance in the ICU was 4.7 liters negative.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled and were negative thus making an ischemic event unlikely.
An echo was done which showed EF of 50%, improved from prior.
CXR was again suggestive of pulmonary edema.
Given erratic hypoxia, pulmonary artery hypertension on echo, and recent use of taxotere, chest CT was done.
Given this lack of improvement over a week, there was concern for PCP given his history of prednisone use.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] oxygen requirement continued, so he was sent home with home O2 and plans to continue the prednisone and follow-up with his oncologist to arrange for PFTs, to attempt to taper prednisone, and for a possible referral to outpatient pulmonary and/or repeat CT if he didn't improve clinically.
Hypotension: SBP ranged high 70s to low 90s in the ICU.
On the OMED service SBP initially ~100 but fell back into the 70s to 80s, limiting diuresis.
[**Name2 (NI) **] was afebrile, with negative blood cultures and no evidence of sepsis.
EKG changes: The patient had inferior ST changes on admission EKG.
Troponins were elevated in the setting of renal failure and increased demand.
His CKs trended down and his CK-MB were flat.
Imdur was held for low blood pressure but may be restarted as an outpatient if needed for symptom control.
DM 2: He was placed on a sliding scale for hyperglycemia in the setting of steroid use.
# Elevated INR: Warfarin was held initially given subtherapeutic INR and restarted at home dose when INR fell within the therapeutic range.
They may arrange for a repeat CT scan and pulmonary function tests.
These may need to be restarted by your primary care physician if your blood pressure is higher.
Followup Instructions: Please have your coumadin level checked on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**5-1**].
