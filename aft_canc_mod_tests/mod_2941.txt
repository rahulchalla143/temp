EGD [**2146-10-4**] Normal esophagus.
There he was found to have a hematocrit of 22 down from his baseline in the mid 30's.
On initial evaluation in the emergency room he had a hematocrit of 24 despite the 2 units PRBCs from the outside hospital and was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate greater than 100.
The patient had one further episode of chest tightness that resolved with nitrates as he received an additional 4 units of PRBC's with his hematocrit stabalizing in the low 30's.
On [**Hospital 57232**] transfer to the hospital floor on [**2146-10-5**], he had a transient episode of hypotension with a pressure of 85/58 when he was transferring from the stretcher to the bed, which was attributed to the patient having restarted his home dose of labetalol on the evening of transfer.
His labetalol was subsequently held (until the day of discharge) and his blood pressure stabalized.
His hematocrit and blood pressure remained stable over the course of these two days with no further evidence of new bleeding.
His rate has been controlled with single doses of metoprolol IV when in the ICU and reinstitution of his sotalol.
Although, the stools are thought to be from old blood and the patient's hematocrit has remained stable, his anticoagulation was discontinued.
He will follow up with his cardiologist on [**10-12**] and his PCP on [**10-13**] to reinstitute these medications as tolerated.
