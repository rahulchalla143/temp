Clinical correlation is suggested  [**8-5**] GI Bleed study: No evidence of GI bleed.
Compared to prior study [**8-11**] there is resolution of vascular congestion.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Limited assessment of the anastomosis due to the lack of intraluminal contrast at this level.
CXR [**8-26**]- Small bilateral pleural effusions and a small region of consolidation at one of the lung bases, probably the right, have increased.
EGD [**6-19**] -Impression: Slightly irregular z-line.
EGD in [**3-10**] years if no dysplasia.

His hospital course was c/b difficult to control atrial fibrillation  #GI bleeding/acute blood loss anemia/total colectomy/severe diverticulosis- Patient presented with GI bleeding which on angiography was found to be associated with right and middle colic arteries (tagged RBC and CTA were negative).
His hematocrit remained stable in the mid 20s following surgery.
#significant ileus-Pt was noted to have abdominal distention/bloating-CT of the abdomen was performed that showed ileus from anastamosis to esophagus.
He had diarrhea which was negative for C. diffx3 and felt to be due to lack of colon.
At the time of discharge, his 24 hour GI output was approximately 700cc.
Workup for atrial fibrillation was notable for normal TSH and absence of infection (no pneumonia on CXR, negative urine culture, neg C. diff).
TTE showed LVEF >55% with mild symmetric LVH and CTA [**8-14**] was negative for PE.
Rates improved wtih addition of amiodarone to betablocker and calcium channel blocker.
#Anemia-acute blood loss- Patient had hematocrit stably in the mid 20s following colectomy.
#FEN-due to excessive GI losses-NGT and diarrhea, I/O's were closely monitored and pt was given aggressive IVF-LR.
For this, you had your blood counts monitored and were evaluated by the gastroenterologists and surgeons.
You underwent a red blood cell scan and a CT scan to help identify the site of your bleeding.
