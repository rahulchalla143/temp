[**2193-6-20**] Abdominal Ultrasound 1.
[**2193-6-18**] Cardiac Catheterization 1.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated mild, nonobstructive coronary artery disease.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (80/43 mmHg).
Filling pressures were markedly elevated (RA 17 mmHg, RVEDP 17 mmHg, PCWP 26 mmHg with "v" waves to 40 mmHg).
Administration of nitroglycerin 200 mg IV resulted in a mild  decrease in PA systolic pressure to 70 mmHg, with a concomitant decrease in the systemic systolic pressure to 85 mmHg.
With IABP at 1:1, PA systolic pressure decreased to 55-60 mmHg, and PCWP decreased to ~22 mmHg.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed mild coronary artery disease, severe biventricular dysfunction, severe pulmonary hypertension and severe mitral regurgitation.
A carotid duplex ultrasound was performed which showed no significant stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries.
Vitamin K was given to reverse his INR from his coumadin.
On [**2193-6-21**], Mr. [**Known lastname 8389**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent a mitral valve replacement utilizing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3843**] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 7624**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 49168**] bioprosthesis and a MAZE procedure.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for temperature >38.0.
