Patient's CT scan at OSH showed a near obstructing RUL lung mass, which on subsequent biopsy turned out to be a squamous cell CA.
She also had a breast biopsy recently which returned as infiltrating ductal CA.
On [**5-8**], on a repeat bronch, it was noted that the patient had narrowing of the R main stem bronchus again, severely limiting her airflow.
Subsequent bronch showed tumor starting to grow in the distal trachea, distorting the opening of the R main bronchus.

She required pressure control ventilation with maximum pressure and oxygenation support.
Repeat bronchoscopy [**2160-6-4**] showed diffuse eschar with with sluffing mucosa, lingula obstructed by pseudomembrane, no bleeding.
She was diuresed as blood pressure tolerated, but by day three became hypotensive requiring pressor support.
LENIs were performed to evaluate for PE and were negative.
She underwent a third bronchoscopy [**2160-6-5**].
An esophageal balloon was placed [**2160-6-6**] which showed exp transpulmonary pressure 2, insp transpulmonary pressure 15, exp intrathoracic pressure 16, insp intrathoracic pressure 19, exp total pressure 18, insp total pressure 34.
Blood pressure was supported with normal saline iv fluid boluses and levophed.
Cortisol stimulation test was negative indicating no adrenal insufficiency.
#Sedation:  Patient was transfered from OSH intubated, sedated, paralyzed; on Fentanyl drip, 300mcg/hr; Versed drip, 22mg/hr; Nimbex drip, 4.2mcg/kg/min.
#Elevated wbc/fever: Patient was noted to have bilateral infilatrates on chest x-ray and urinalysis consistent with infection.
Sputum and BAL cultures grew pseudomonas.
Additionally there was a report of stenotrophomonus infection at the OSH that was not seen on BAL or sputum culture at [**Hospital1 18**].
Started amiodarone at osh on [**2160-6-1**] in response to SVT with HR in 160s.
