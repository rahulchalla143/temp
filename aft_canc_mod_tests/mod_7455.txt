Due to concern of urinary retention patient transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation where she was evaluated by several services.
Based on exam and imaging available (MRI unable to be completed) they did not feel she was suffering from cauda equina or cord compression.
VS on presentation to ED T 98.2, BP 147/74, HR 84, RR 18, 99% RA.
Following valium doses patient BP dropped to 68-75/43-60 and improved to SBP 90s following 4 L NS.
Vitals on transfer HR 101, 90/64, 16, 99%RA.
Patient mentated and with good urine output with low BPs.
On arrival to the ICU her VS BP 131/56 and HR 105.

With the above limitations in mind, remainder of the study does not show acute abnormality to explain the patient's symptoms.
Again, CT features are most suggestive of hemangiomas and lesion would be highly atypical for rectal metastases.
Alternatively multiphasic CT could also be performed (less desirable given multiple prior CT's) or this could be followed on subsequent imaging.
However, by the time she arrived in the ICU SBP 130s and MAP > 65.
Her pressures remained within the 90's to 120's during the first few days and then the day prior to admission, the patient was hypertensive with SBP in the 130-150 range.
MRI of the T- and L-spine were done and was not complete due to patient's anxiety but were reviewed by radiology and neurology and neurosurgery and felt to be sufficient to rule out cord compression.
Patient also examined by Neurology and Neurosourgery and exam was not consistent with cord compression or cauda equina.
No further imaging was done as the patient was claustrophobic and does not tolerate sedating medications well.
Finger sticks were well controlled.
If no improvement in symptoms with treatment, shrinking of tumor then may need neuro exam for possible EMG.
