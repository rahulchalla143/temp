His initial vitals in the ED were T98.6, HR 99, BP 142/91, RR 16, and Sat 98%RA.
His initial labs were remarkable for hyperkalemia (6.4), for which he received insulin/D50, kayexalate x 1 (did not tolerate second dose of kayexalate).
EKG did not demonstrate peaked T waves.
A renal ultrasound demonstrated no obstruction or hydronephrosis.
Past Medical History: Renal Cell Carcinoma (please see below) - h/o RLE DVT [**8-/2107**] - Colonic perforation - Hyponatremia - Anemia - Cervical surgery with rod-placement due to C2 met  ONCOLOGIC HISTORY Mr. [**Known lastname 73639**] presented with hematuria and flank pain in [**1-/2107**] and was found to have a 5.1 x 5.8 cm R renal mass by CT scan and underwent partial R nephrectormy in 2/[**2106**].
In [**7-/2108**], he was treated with 1 cycle of high-dose IL-2, but a follow up CT showed progression, and this was stopped.
Monitored qMonth with CT scan.
Last CT [**2109-1-3**] revealed decreased tumor size, but also colonic perforation which is currently encapsulated - not a surgical candidate until sorafenib & bevacizumab have cleared system given concern for poor wound healing.

Noted to have Cr > 7 while in clinic.
Baseline Cr approximately 1.
Imaging revealed no evidence of hydronephrosis so unlikely to be post-renal etiology.
Creatinine normalized to 1.1 by discharge.
Continued monitoring on telemetry with daily EKGs and kayexelate PR for potasssium > 6.
Resolved [**2109-1-14**] so telemetry and EKGs were discontinued.
Continued to monitor electrolytes throughout stay.
CT Abd/pelvis [**1-14**] with increased extravasation, as well as increased perinephric fluid at L kidney.
CT Scan [**1-24**] to assess abscess with increased size of right middle lobe nodule from [**1-2**] and an increase in size of the right anterolateral abdominal wall metastasis since [**1-14**].
Additionally obtained blood cultures which were pending and no growth to date.
