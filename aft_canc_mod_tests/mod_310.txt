During the admission, she was noted to be in and out of atrial fibrillation, alternating from tachycardia to sinus bradycardia, and with systolic blood pressures in the 70's - 90's.
Given the tachycardia and hypotension, an echocardiogram was performed demonstrating large pericardial effusion and evidence of RV collapse.
Echo showed small anteroapical pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
Her creatinine was noted to be increasing (from 1.4 to 1.9 to 2.3) with continued hypotension despite multiple fluid boluses (totaling ~2L).

RV diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study of [**2186-3-21**], the pericardial effusion is larger with some evidendce of RV collapse.
The left ventricular systolic function is similar.
Successful pericardiocentesis, with drainage of 460 mL bloody drainage and resolution of pericardial effusion (drain left in place).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Levophed was weaned successfully and her blood pressure remained stable in the systolic high 80's to 100's.
Pathology was felt to likely be adenocarcinoma.
* Patient will need INR checked weekly while on amiodarone and followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Her creatinine returned to baseline prior to discharge, with good urine output.
# Systolic congestive heart failure: Patient's last ejection fraction was 20-25%.
# Illeus/constipation: Patient had difficulty with constipation during her stay, with repeated x-ray imaging consistent with an illeus, without evidence of obstruction.
An aggressive bowel regimen was followed, and her illeus resolved prior to discharge.
