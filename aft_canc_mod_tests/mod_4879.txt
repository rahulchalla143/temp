MICROBIOLOGY: [**2111-10-14**] 11:05 am URINE CULTURE (Final [**2111-10-15**]): NO GROWTH.

IMAGING / STUDIES: # Portable TTE ([**2111-10-13**] at 11:45:20 AM): There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
# Cardiac Cath ([**2111-10-13**]): *** Not Signed Out *** COMMENTS: 1.
the LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA were without angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenosis.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial normotension.
# CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2111-10-19**] at 2:55 AM): FINDINGS: There is no evidence infarction, hemorrhage, mass effect, edema, or shift of normally midline structures.
His cardiac cath ([**10-13**]) showed no evidence of significant coronary disease, however.
He also had a 2D-Echo on [**10-13**] which showed moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis with an LVEF of 30%.
We trended his cardiac biomarkers to improvement (peak Troponin of 0.16, CK-MB peak at 16).
We also restarted his ACEI (Lisinopril) and titrated this to a dose of 40 mg PO daily for better blood pressure control.
His electrolytes were optimized and he was monitored via telemetry.
# ASPIRATION - The patient presented with a mild oxygen requirement and decreased breath sounds at bases with CXR showing bibasilar haziness concerning for aspiration pneumonitis.
We did start utilizing his PEG tube this admission and speech and swallow evaluation noted the need for thin liquids and soft-moist consistency diet given his risk of aspiration.
An infectious work-up showed a reassuring urinalysis and his urine and blood cultures were reassuring; a CXR was reassuring.
Head CT was negative for fracture or intracranial bleeding.
CHRONIC ISSUES: =============== # HIV - apparently stable disease: We sent repeat CD4 count which was 515 and HIV-1 viral load which was undetectable.
# ESOPHAGEAL ADENOCARCINOMA - seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD (Thoracic Surgery) in [**8-/2111**] who said he was non-operative and could benefit from radiation; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from Heme-Onc saw him as well - patient not likely chemoradiation therapy candidate given other co-morbidities and patient disinterest in aggressive therapy; will need repeat endoscopy and EUS in [**2-18**] months for re-evaluation of disease progression.
Blood culture final reports pending at discharge.

Aspiration pneumonitis 3.
Reflux esophagitis, GERD 5.
Vitamin D deficiency   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had a cardiac catheterization which showed no evidence of significant coronary disease.
You also had an echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) which showed a low ejection fracture and some heart failure.
