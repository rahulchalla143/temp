She stated that her temperature at home was 102.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs reveal a temperature 99.1, pulse 105, blood pressure 233/97, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 90% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination shows pupils equally round and reactive to light.
The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Neurological examination shows cranial nerves II through XII intact.
Extremity examination, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were not palpable bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 13.1, hematocrit 35.5, platelets 236.
Coagulation screen shows PT of 19.5, INR 2.5.
Chem-7 within normal limits except for glucose of 263.
The patient's creatinine is 1.0 which is her baseline.
Magnesium is 1.5, calcium and phosphorus are normal.
Right lower extremity cellulitis and ulcerations - The patient was admitted to the Podiatry Service on [**3-10**] for the cellulitis of the right lower extremity.
Blood cultures and wound cultures were taken.
Her Coumadin was discontinued and once her INR had decreased close to baseline, she was taken to the Operating Room for hardware removal.
Respiratory - On [**3-20**], the patient developed hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 80% on room air and hypertension with systolic blood pressure in the 190s.
Chest x-ray done on that day was consistent with congestive heart failure and the patient was given Lasix.
She was continued on Zosyn and Vancomycin and a sputum culture was obtained.
The sputum culture showed [**Female First Name (un) 564**] and did not grow out any bacteria.
Once the sputum culture was negative for any bacteria and there was no evidence of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus her Vancomycin was discontinued.
Congestive heart failure - The patient required Lasix intermittently for mild hypoxia and crackles on lung examination indicative of congestive heart failure.
Her blood pressure was labile but was controlled with Catapres, Lopressor, and Zestril.
Anticoagulation - The patient's Coumadin was discontinued as was previously mentioned in order to be taken to the Operating Room.
Her heparin drip was continued until her INR would be in the goal range of 2 to 3.
Dysphagia - The patient had a swallowing study previously done in [**Month (only) 1096**], in order to evaluate symptoms of dysphagia.
This showed a possible offer for esophageal sphincter dysfunction, no further workup was done at the time.
While in the hospital she also had periods of time when her hematocrit was below 30.
The iron studies showed a mixed picture with decreased iron and TIBC and elevated Ferritin.
The patient's iron to TIBC ratio was low suggesting a possible combination of iron deficiency anemia, anemia of chronic disease and possibly anemia related to the patient's hypothyroidism.
The patient was given blood transfusions as needed to maintain her hematocrit greater than 30, given her history of congestive heart failure.
