CXR - RLL infiltrate .
CT abdomen 1.
This was noted on a prior report, though the images are not available for direct comparison.
Small lymph nodes in the axilla and retroperitoneum that do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
The acuity of this finding is not clear, as the prior study images are not available for direct comparison.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Given that patient originally presented with pleuritic chest pain he underwent CTA to rule out PE, which was negative.
Given intial findings on CT felt that aspiration was possibly playing a role in the patient's lung disease.
Pt had no h/o CHF but TTE showed mild systolic dysfxn.
In the interim, as  further w/u, BNP and repeat CXR were obtained.
BNP returned elevated at 21K, w/ increasing vol  congestion on CXR.
Colonoscopy revealed multiple polyps, 8 of which were removed.
The pathology on a polyp removed from the transverse colon revealed adenocarcinoma within several millimeters of the margin.
The patient underwent multiple repeat colonoscopies which were unrevealing.
HCT remained stable and the patient should receive follow up colonoscopy in 3 months.
