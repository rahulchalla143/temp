INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.4?????
?, pulse 80, blood pressure 131/88, 67.7 kg.
He was ventilated on assist control with tidal volume of 600 at a rate of 16, PEEP of 5, FIO2 of 1.0 with oxygen saturation of 100%.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.
INITIAL LAB DATA:  Sodium 142, potassium 4, chloride 107, bicarbonate 25, BUN 25, creatinine 1.1, glucose 215, anion gap 14.
White count 11.1, hematocrit 32, INR 1.4, calcium 7.6.
Initial arterial blood gases 7.31, 51, 390.
Post intubation chest x-ray showed right upper lobe mass, diffuse alveolar opacification on the right lungs with good position of endotracheal tube.
His infiltrates progressed from last subsequent lead to involving his right lung as well.
Respiratory cultures were drawn on several locations.
On [**2105-8-14**], he grew sparse gram negative rods and sparse yeast in a respiratory culture and had 2+ gram positive cocci in pairs on induced sputum.
On discharge, he was stable from a pulmonary standpoint with oxygen saturations in the high 90s on intermittent 10 liter shovel mask and 4 liter nasal cannula.
His secretions were copious and his gag reflex and cough progressively improved over 48 to 72 hours.
He had a head CT which showed no evidence of acute infarction.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient is intermittently hypertensive and tachycardic throughout his hospital stay after stabilization of his blood pressure initially corresponding with his episodes of agitation.
Subsequent to his cardiac arrest presentation, he had no ventricular ectopy or ventricular arrhythmias which were functionally or hemodynamically significant.
He had an EEG on [**2105-8-14**] which showed findings consistent with diffuse encephalopathy of cortical and subcortical structures without any evidence of epileptiform features.
Given the lack of utility of speech and swallow study in this patient as he is most likely an aspiration risk, will initiate oral feeds using standard aspiration precautions.
Electrolytes were stable upon time of discharge.
Hematocrit stable at 35, white count 7.1, BUN 17, creatinine 0.3 and blood cultures and urine cultures showed no growth to date.
