CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2160-1-12**] : This study is just being presented for interpretation.
# Vomiting: placed NGT with immediate decompression of >1200cc of brown liquid Abd films negative for ileus.
# Presumed aspiration: Given that pt was vomiting on floor prior to arrival in ICU and also had vomiting while placing NGT in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with brief desaturation to 85%, pt has likely aspirated some gastric material.
- ppi to reduce acid pneumonitis - cipro/flagyl empirically .
Pt returned to [**Location 1950**] 5 on POD 5.
The pt was still unable to void so a new foley was placed and the pt was sent home with a leg bag and a follow up appointment was made with urology for voiding trial on out-patient basis.
# Hyponateremia On POD 15 pt's sodium decreased to 124 from 129 (admit sodium was 141).
On POD 16 Na increased to 130, repeat sodium to 131.
He will have a repeat sodium level on Friday [**2160-1-25**] at [**Month/Day/Year 3390**]'s office.
