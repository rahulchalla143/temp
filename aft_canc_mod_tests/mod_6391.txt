MRI Head [**12-8**]: FINDINGS: Multiple enhancing metastatic lesions identified, with the largest in the right frontal lobe, again with surrounding vasogenic edema and leftward subfalcine herniation, not significantly changed compared to prior study.
MRI Head (post-resection) [**12-9**]: FINDINGS: The patient is status post right frontal craniotomy.
The orbits, the paranasal sinuses, and the mastoid air cells are unremarkable.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 48 year old right handed woman with a history of breast cancer s/p left mastectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy with known metastases to the liver, bone, and lung who presented with a 1 month history of bitemporal headaches and a 2 week history of daily vomiting who was transferred from an OSH with head CT showing two lesions in the right cerebral hemisphere with midline shift consistent with metastases.
Head CT at [**Hospital1 18**] showed three ring-enhancing supratentorial metastatic foci: 3.3 x 2.8 cm in the right frontal lobe, 1.9 x 1.1 cm right parietal lesion, and 1.2 x 1.1 cm right occipital lesion.
Given the extent of peri-turmoral edema and her deteriorating neurologic examination (she became progressively lethargic in the ED), she was taken for emergent resection.
Post-procedure MRI showed resection of the right frontal metastatic lesion, vague pattern of enhancement is noted in the left frontal lobe, two unchanged metastatic lesions: one on the right occipital lobe and the second right parafalcine in the convexity.
