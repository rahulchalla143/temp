Noncontrast CT chest revealed a mass at the right hilum that was obstructing his right upper lobe; also with 2 subcentimeter nodules in LUL concerning for satellite nodules, RUL consolidation concerning for post-obstructive pneumonia, mediastinal adenopathy.
Increased hypoxia with ABG 7.33/42/60 on 4LNC.
Given concern for TB, AFB sent (negative x1, pending x2).

CXR [**3-31**]: 1.
Recommended CT of the chest with contrast if this has not been performed before 2.
Despite immunosuppression and elevated LDH, PCP less likely based on CT chest findings.
Sputum GS and culture showed polymicrobial infection, which grew only commensal organisms.
Ruled out for TB with 3 induced sputums (2 expectorated at outside hospital, 1 induced at [**Hospital1 18**]).
After bronchoscopy [**2153-4-5**] he again desaturated twice to O2 sats in the low 80s, but improved quickly and was able to be weaned off of oxygen quickly.
This was thought to be due to mucous plugging as his CXR was unchanged, so he was started on guaifenesin 1200mg [**Hospital1 **].
LENI's were negative and his EKG unchanged.
[**2153-4-9**] he had an increased oxygen requirement in the setting of aggressive fluids for hypercalcemia, and a CTA chest was done.
Final pathology results showed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
On [**4-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname 19688**] became hypotensive to SBP 80s on the floor.
SBP noted to be 110.
Hypercalcemia: PTH low at 10, phos low normal and PTHrp negative at [**Hospital 8**] hospital, making bony mets the most likely source of hypercalcemia.
25-0H Vitamin D level was low, and 1,25-OH vitamin D levels were pending.
His calcium then trended up and he was restarted on IV fluids (NS 200cc/hr) with PRN lasix (typically 60-80mg IV total/day).
Head CT negative for bleed or metastases.
Per review of OSH records, baseline creatinine 1.6-2.0.
