CTA chest was negative for PE but showed airspace consolidation suggestive of RLL pneumonia.
Because the team was anticipating the possibility of a PE, they also obtained a non-contrast head CT, which unfortunately demonstrated likely new brain mets.
Past Medical History: Melanoma metastatic to lung, liver, heart, skin, and bone (spine) s/p high-dose IL-2 x 4 cycles, CTLA-4 antibody in [**5-6**] x 2, then EBRT to T7-T12 spine [**3-9**], currently receiving palliative XRT to hip mets (next dose due [**7-15**]) Hypercholesterolemia Hypothyroidism Sinus tachycardia at baseline Diabetes mellitus [**3-3**] study drug, developed in [**2-7**], diet-controlled h/o C diff colitis h/o severe neuropathy from CR-01 immunotoxin, now improving s/p Right knee surgery s/p Tonsillectomy Recent b/l upper lobe pneumonia treated in CT [**2138-5-30**] .
He then noticed a small bump adjacent to his sternum, which began to grow through [**2135-4-30**] at which time he was evaluated at [**Hospital 33316**] Hospital in [**Location (un) **], [**State 2748**].
A surgeon performed a FNA biopsy of the parasternal mass which showed metastatic melanoma.
Biopsy of a parasternal mass at the site of a pathologic sternal fracture which revealed metastatic melanoma in 05/[**2135**].

RADIOLOGY: CT Head: IMPRESSION: Interval development of a 12 x 7 mm hyper-attenuating focus located in the right occipital lobe given history of metastatic melanoma is highly concerning for a focus metastasis.
This can be more fully characterized with MR examination as clinically indicated.
He had tumor bleeding in the RLL and underwent rigid bronchoscopy x 3 for argon treatments and photocoagulation, these were temporarily successful.
