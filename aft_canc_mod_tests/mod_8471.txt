There is extensive widening of the mediastinum, which when compared with subsequently obtained CT scan is secondary to an unfolded thoracic aorta.
Please note, subacute appearing right anterior rib fractures are better visualized on CT scan performed subsequently.
CT head:FINDINGS: There is no evidence for hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are mildly enlarged secondary to involutional changes.
