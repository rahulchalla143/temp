Transpedicular decompression, T5 and L1.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital6 204**] and spine MRI was performed, whose images we have reviewed.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
[**2128-1-20**] CT Head - Probable metastatic lesions bilaterally in the deep frontal white matter.
[**2128-1-20**] CXR - Lungs clear.
[**2128-1-20**] MRI - Skull base metastatic foci, including a locale adjacent to the right trigeminal ganglion.
Status-post cingulotomies, but no evidence for brain parenchymal metastases  Cultures: [**2128-1-19**] Blood - pending [**2128-1-19**] Urine - contaminated [**2128-1-19**] Blood - pending [**2128-1-17**] Blood - no growth [**2128-1-17**] Urine - enterococcus [**2128-1-19**] Blood - NGTD [**2128-1-19**] Urine - NGTD   Brief Hospital Course: At [**Hospital6 204**], lumbar CT scan showed diffuse osteopenia and lesions at L4-5 with compression fracture at L1 and fracture at L5.
He reportedly had a T5 cord compression of which no reports were sent.
Patient's platelet count was 12 on admission -->6 units of platelets.
and multiple units of platelets: good response in plt count (max 140), but not sustained.
Multiple thoracic laminotomies, fusion of T1 to L3, segmental instrumentation T1 to L3, autograft, epidural catheter placement.
Pain service was consulted for epidural management.His postoperative exam on transfer to the ICU was as follows:    IP  Q   HS   TA  [**Last Name (un) 938**]   GS R   4  4+  4+   5    5     4+ L   4  4+  4+   5    5     4+ SILT L2-S1 bilaterally.
On [**2128-1-9**] his drains were discontinued.
On [**2128-1-10**] patient was transfused 2 units of PRBC for hematocrit = 22 and symptomatic with tachycardia.
Trop x 3 was negative and CTA was negative.
A CT head was ordered to evaluate for any signs of metastatic disease.
They requested MRI imaging of the orbits and an LP to look for spread of the cancer to the CSF.
All cultures (other than the Urine showing enterococcus) remained negative to date.
He had the extensive hematoma formation at his surgical site with a platelet count of 24.
Because of this, it was decided that the transfusion threshold would be to keep plts >50.
His thrombocytoenia was likely multifactorial with a significant contribution from marrow suppression from XRT and chemotherapy.
His hct will need to be checked every few days after discharge and transfused for hct<28.
There was concern that the patient might have been hemolyzing because his labs showed an elevated LDH, low haptoglobin, and increased bilirubin.
His hct remained relatively stable and his LDH slowly trended down.
