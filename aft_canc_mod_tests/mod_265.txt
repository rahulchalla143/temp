[**2101-12-20**]   Radiology CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: There is small right frontal parietotemporal extra-axial hemorrhage (601b:51).
Stable lesions within the left parotid gland characterized as likely a venolymphatic malformation on last MRI brain from [**2100-1-19**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
[**2101-12-20**]   Radiology CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: The alignement of the cervical spine is preserved.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
[**2101-12-20**]   Radiology CT CHEST/ABN/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: The study is suboptimal due to lack of IV contrast; limitations were discussed prior scanning.
CT CHEST: There is interval decrease in size of mediastinal, hilar and axillary lymph nodes.
Scattered small lymph nodes are seen in the bilateral axilla, mediastinum, and hila, however, with interval decrease in size compared to last CT from [**2101-12-9**].
CT ABDOMEN: Evaluation of solid organs is suboptimal due to lack of IV contrast.
There are no acute findings on a noncontrast CT thought to be related to the acute trauma.
CT PELVIS: There are bilateral total hip prosthesis, which gives significant amount of artifact in the pelvis.
No evidence of acute injury on a noncontrast CT torso.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
[**2101-12-21**]   Radiology CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: There is no significant change in thickness or extent of the relatively thin right frontotemporoparietal region subdural hematoma, with little mass effect (2:12).
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
[**12-24**] CT HEAD NON CONTRAST FINDINGS: Again, there has been no interval change in the thickness or extent of the small right frontotemporal subdural hematoma.
IMPRESSION: No marked change from previous study to explain patient's worsening symptoms.
[**12-24**] CT C-SPINE NON CONTRAST INDINGS: There has been no interval acute change since the prior study three days ago.
There are several vertebral body lucencies at the C2, C3, and C4 levels, which are unchanged from the prior study but were not present on the MRI of the brain performed in [**2100**].
Several vertebral body lucencies in the cervical spine, new from [**2100**], which may be related to the patient's osteopenia; however, evaluation with MRI is recommended due to the patient's history of leukemia.
[**12-23**] RUE DOPPLER ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler imaging was obtained of the right subclavian, internal jugular, axillary, basilic, brachial and cephalic veins.

Right temporal SDH Noted on OSH CT head, confirmed here by radiology in the ED.
A third CT head/neck was performed on [**12-24**] (unchanged) when she c/o worsening L-sided headache and vertigo with neck flexion.
Neurosurgery re-evaluated but felt no intervention necessary given lack of focal exam findings and serial head CT stable x3.
She needs follow-up head imaging (head CT) and neurosurgery clinic evaluation 8 weeks from admission.
#C-SPINE INTRAVERTEBRAL LUCENCIES Neuroradiology did note some abnormal lucency within cervical vertebral bodies on all CT exams, which were stable but new since imaging in [**2100**], ddx included lymphoma vs osteopenia.
Suggested f/u C-spine MRI which was not performed given the on going chemotherapy .
Given exam findings of erythema and induration centered upon former PICC insertion sites, she was started on vancomycin.
A repeat doppler of the PICC site itself reveal a small fluid collection that was too small to drain per surgery.
Repeat urine culture showed no growth.
#DLBCL Discovered on EGD workup for anemia prior to last admission.
CT torso performed during trauma workup in the ED here revealed interval decrease in size of diffuse adenopathy and interval decrease in size of retroperitoneal mass, no change in peri-cervical mass.
Plt and Hct were stable after initial transfusion on admission.
DM2 Blood sugars wnl, conrolled on insulin sliding scale (rather than home glyburide).
Did have brief elevation of creatinine of unknown etiology, urine lytes were indicative of intrinsic renal disases.
NEEDS NEUROSURGERY FOLLOWUP SCHEDULED - 8 WEEKS FROM [**12-24**], ALSO NEEDS REPEAT HEAD IMAGING AT THAT TIME (PHONE NUMBER FOR NSG OFFICE STAFF IN DISCHARGE PAPERS).
