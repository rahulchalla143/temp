Calcifications of the vertebral artery origin, limit evaluation for stenosis.
EEG [**6-9**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG despite the normal posterior dominant rhythm during the waking state due to the presence of bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing which represents deep midline and subcortical dysfunction.
ECHO [**6-9**] IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**6-9**] IMPRESSION: Acute watershed infarction involving the left cerebral hemisphere, new since the prior MRI of the brain dated [**2123-6-7**], also seen on the prior CT perfusion from [**2123-6-9**].
CT- HEAD [**6-11**] IMPRESSION: Evolving left hemispheric watershed infarcts, with no evidence of hemorrhagic conversion.
Labs at discharge:   Brief Hospital Course: NEURO: STROKE 83 yo RHW with h/o L CEA [**2123-5-25**] presented with transient episodes of R hand and arm numbness and speech difficulties.
Neuro exam was significant for right pronator drift and slowness with finger tapping.
CTA showed bilateral carotids had no significant stenosis.
It was therefore recommended to keep her blood pressure well controlled (SBP<160) and stop the heparin drip given risk of edema and hemorrhage.
EEG was performed to rule out seizure.
On [**6-8**] overnight, the patient's neuro exam worsened.
The patient's blood pressure was being kept controlled between sBP 100-120 for concern of hyperperfusion syndrome.
CT with perfusion done at that time showed ischemia in the L anterior and posterior watershed borderzones.
CTA showed small plaque in the proximal L common carotid artery.
She was immediately bolused with 2L IVF and then started on neosynephrine to keep MAP >90-100.
MRI showed watershed infarct in the L MCA-PCA borderzone and internal borderzone superiorly.
Her neuro exam continued to improve over the next 24 hours.
She was continued on heparin drip, with plan to transition to coumadin, but this plan was aborted due to falling hematocrit on [**6-11**].
Repeat CT of the Head did not show hemorrhagic conversion and the patient was started on heparin, however transient thrombocytopenia and dropping HCT (likely from GI bleed), led to discontinuation of anticoagulation.
The patient also had a RUE ultrasound that did not show any DVT.
HCT repeated after transfusion was unchanged, and HCT continued to drop over the next 12 hours.
CT abdomen and pelvisd was negative.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
She then underwent upper and lower endoscopy which revealed "A few small angioectasias with stigmata of recent bleeding seen in the second part of the duodenum.
Her HCT remained stable in the low-mid 20s over last 2 days of this admission.
She will be followed by GI services as an outpatient in [**2-12**] weeks at which time further investigation (repeat colonoscopy or capsule endoscopy) might be undertaken.
CKD: Patient had baseline Cr 1.4-1.6 which was stable.
Upon further investigation and imaging studies it became clear that you had suffered a stroke.
Because of this, you underwent an endoscopy and a colonoscopy to investigate the source of bleeding.
You had a polyp removed from you colon and small bleeding vessel was intervened on in your stomach.
We also held blood thinning agents other than aspirin given your ongoing bleeding.
