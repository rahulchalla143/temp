**FINAL REPORT [**2147-5-14**]** URINE CULTURE (Final [**2147-5-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
[**2147-5-13**] 1:30 pm BLOOD CULTURE -> Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):  Radiology: **CXR ([**5-12**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Nonemergent evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT, MR (as renal function allows) or ultrasound is recommended.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2142-9-3**], aortic sclerosis has progressed to mild stenosis and pulmonary pressures are higher.
Discharge Labs ([**5-14**]): CBC: WBC 17.9 (down from 19.9) / Hgb 11.4 / Hct 35.3 / plts 411 PT 30.5 / INR 3.0  Chem: Na 138 / K 4.8 / Cl 98 / HCO3 34 / BUN 27 / Cr 0.8 / glucose 231 Ca 9.2 / Mg 1.5 / P 3.0  Urine Cx and Blood Cx Pending      Brief Hospital Course: 1.
A cardiology consult was obtained and they recommended using metoprolol for the main rate control [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
His rate continued to be adequately controlled and he continued to have normal rate during the day and mild, asymptomatic bradycardia while sleeping on this regimen.
Aspiration Pneumonia: A chest CT in the past had indicated RUL nodule, and CXR on admission showed right lung opacity possibly consistent with infectious process.
CXR was obtained that showed some ground glass opacifications in the RML which would be consistent with an infectious process.
Bullous Pemphagoid: Pt seen by derm consult regarding pt's hx of bullous pemphigoid; recommendedations: 1.  doxycycline 100mg TID  2.nicotinamide (niacin) 500mg PO TID  3.  d/c hydrocortisone  4. start clobetasol  5. continue prednisone 20mg [**Hospital1 **].
Because Mr. [**Known lastname 38030**] continued to run elevated blood pressures throughout much of the admission, an addtional anti-hypertensive (Losartan) was started to help with blood pressure control.
Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) 50,000 unit Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO 1X/WEEK (WE).
Losartan 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: Please check potassium level after 5-7 days of use.
An ultra sound of your heart was obtained which showed no serious abnormalities.
Finally, you developed an elevated white blood cell count during your hospitalization and a chest xray showed a possible pneumonia in your right lung.
Your blood pressure was also high so we started an additional blood pressure medication called losartan.
Followup Instructions: 1) Consider f/u CT of chest in [**12-21**] weeks in order to evaluate resolution of infiltrate seen on CXR 2) Speech Eval for swallowing ability and aspiration risk 3) CBC in 7 days to evaluate WBC 4) K and Cr in [**3-24**] days to evaluate renal funct w/ Losartan 5) INR in [**1-20**] days with goal range 2.0-3.0  6) Follow up with Dermatology in their clinic for treatment of the Bullous Pemphagoid.
