Catheterization demonstrated a tight LAD lesion, 70% proximal, 90% mid LAD, resulting in an inability to see his previous LAD stent.
Left ventriculogram during catheterization showed normal size and good contraction of all wall segments.
Labs drawn at [**Hospital6 14475**] showed a hematocrit of 39.0, creatinine kinase of 126, troponin 0.06.
Upon arrival vital signs were 97.8, blood pressure 140 to 160 over 90 to 100, heart rate in the 60's with normal sinus rhythm, oxygen saturation 98 to 100% on two liters nasal cannula oxygen.
Prior to catheterization at [**Hospital1 69**], patient received fentanyl 25 mcg for his discomfort and Versed.
Therapeutic catheterization at [**Hospital1 190**] showed left main coronary artery disease with mid ostial disease, left anterior descending with 60% ostial lesion, moderate 50% mid disease prior to stent, 95% tight focal lesion in old stent prior to first major diagonal branch.
Tunnel sheaths were pulled with systolic blood pressures in the range of 140's to 150's.
Stat hematocrit value was drawn with a value of 34.9.
As the hematoma and groin continued to ooze bloody discharge, a vascular groin C-clamp was applied.
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further hemodynamic monitoring.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 96.0, blood pressure 106/60, respiratory rate 15, heart rate 77, oxygen saturation 99% on three liters nasal cannula.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Extremities:  Cool, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally, 1+ posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORIES, X-RAYS AND OTHER STUDIES: Laboratories drawn on the morning of [**2144-9-9**] at [**Hospital6 11896**] showed sodium 132, potassium 3.1, chloride 96, bicarbonate 26, BUN 14, creatinine 0.9, glucose 114, calcium 7.7, magnesium 2.0, creatinine kinase 126, troponin 0.06.
The latest coagulation profile from [**2144-9-2**] showed PT 9.9, PTT 26, INR 1.0.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Dipyridamole EKG ([**2144-8-25**]):  Normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, incomplete right bundle branch block, left anterior hemiblock but inconclusive dipyridamole exercise EKG.
No chest pain or diagnostic ST segment changes to heart rate of 101.
CARDIOLITE STRESS TEST ([**2144-8-25**]):  Normal left ventricular size and function.
Ejection fraction 58%.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM [**2144-9-9**] AT [**Hospital6 **]: Showed normal sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute.
CORONARY CATHETERIZATION ([**2144-9-9**]):  Demonstrated selective left-sided coronary angiography in this left dominant circulation demonstrated one vessel coronary artery disease.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2144-9-10**]):  Left ventricular ejection fraction 60%.
There is no 2-D echocardiographic findings of tamponade, but a complete Doppler assessment was not possible.
ARTERIAL DOPPLERS OF THE RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ([**2144-9-10**]).
Duplex evaluation performed of the right lower extremity arterial and venous systems with concentration on the inguinal region.
Therefore, once his blood pressure was able to tolerate additional antihypertensives, a low dose beta blocker was added to his medication regimen.
After several days of monitoring, the patient continued to be hypertensive with blood pressures ranging 160 to 180 over 90's to 100.
At the time of discharge the patient's blood pressure was controlled on metoprolol 100 b.i.d., lisinopril 40 q. day and hydrochlorothiazide 25 q. day.
The patient continued to be monitored on telemetry with no evidence of acute conduction abnormalities.
Right groin hematoma resulting in blood loss anemia: Vascular Surgery consultation was obtained status post coronary catheterization and development of large right groin hematoma.
In the Coronary Care Unit, serial hematocrits were obtained, patient's blood pressure and hemodynamics were checked serially and peripheral pulse checks were done q. one hour.
Due to anemia secondary to blood loss, the patient required multiple blood transfusions for stabilization of his blood volume and maintenance of hematocrit greater than 30.
Repeat ultrasound was obtained on [**2144-9-4**], with no evidence of hematoma expansion, no evidence of pseudo-aneurysm or arteriovenous fistula formation.
Serial hematocrits had been stable above 33 to 36 for several days.
Hematocrit stabilized.
Status post cardiac catheterization with stent.
He was instructed that we have added metoprolol, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide to his blood pressure regimen.
