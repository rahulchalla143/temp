In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS 95.2 146 132/87 46 94%NRB.
An ECG was notable for afib with RVR, CXR for right-sided pleural effusion and diffuse parenchymal opacities, and a large right-sided pleural effusion, and CTA was negative for PE.
The patient was also noted to have a TnT of 0.4 up from <0.01 on admission, BNP 700, and lactate 4.
Cardiology was called in the ED and based on ECG and cardiac biomarkers, elevated TnT was felt to be secondary to demand ischemia but recommended heparin gtt.
Chemotherapy was resumed in [**2135-9-10**] in the setting of rising CEA and CT evidence of disease progression.
Dullness to percussion at right base [**1-11**] way up lung field.

FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2137-6-4**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
CTA ([**5-31**]): No pulmonary embolism.
CTH ([**5-31**]): No acute intracranial path  TTE ([**6-4**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
On CT chest review, parenchymal disease burden is worse compared to last CT scan performed prior to admission, and right lower lobe is now completely collapsed.
There was initial concern given tumor burden for malignant pericardial effusion with resulting hypoxia and tachyarrythmia, but CT and TTE did not demonstrate significant pericardial effusion.
Serial CXR after therapeutic paracentesis was performed were notable for reaccumulation of pleural effusion, and attempts at weaning BiPaP were unsuccessful.
After numerous family meetings in discussion with the patient's primary oncologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the patient and her family, the patient was made comfort measures only.
During her hospital course, she intermitently had runs of narrow complex tachycardia with a ventricular rate up to 220 that was minimally responsive to AV nodal blockade with IV metoprolol and diltiazem.
