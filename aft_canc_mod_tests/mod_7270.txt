Modest non-specific ST-T wave changes are suggested but baseline artifact makes assessment difficult.
CXR [**6-17**]: The patient is rotated.
CXR [**6-22**]: There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
EGD [**6-18**]: Findings: Esophagus: 1.
Impression: Abnormal mucosa in the esophagus Large hiatal hernia Polyps in the fundus and stomach body Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum  EGD [**6-20**]: Esophageal stricture (biopsy) Hiatal hernia Otherwise normal EGD to stomach body  DISCHARGE LABS: ============== [**2154-6-21**] 08:50AM BLOOD WBC-5.0 RBC-4.27 Hgb-11.2* Hct-35.0* MCV-82 MCH-26.1* MCHC-31.9 RDW-14.4 Plt Ct-454* [**2154-6-21**] 08:50AM BLOOD Glucose-105 UreaN-6 Creat-0.7 Na-140 K-3.9 Cl-106 HCO3-22 AnGap-16 [**2154-6-18**] 05:09AM BLOOD TSH-0.62 [**2154-6-21**] 08:50AM BLOOD Albumin-2.6* Calcium-8.0* Phos-3.5 Mg-1.8  Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, this is an 87 yo female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, who was admitted from the [**Hospital3 537**] on [**6-17**] with complaints of hematemesis.
She was initially admitted to the ICU for close monitoring overnight.
This showed again a circumferential stricture, but the scope was able to pass through the stricture this time, and biopsies were taken.
The pathology on the EGD biopsy should be back next week, and the GI fellow, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3037**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be following up on the results.
# Chronic Anemia with acute blood loss: The patient's hematocrit was down to 24, and she received 2 units of PRBC while in the ICU.
Her hematocrit stabilized at 31-34.
Family would consider hospice care if biopsy results malignant.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
