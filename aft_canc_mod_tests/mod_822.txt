Compared to the previous tracing of [**2134-3-19**] the ischemic appearing lateral ST-T wave changes have improved which may be pseudonormalization.
[**2134-12-13**] CT head: 1.
LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior septum and lateral wall;, and akinesis of the posterior wall.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-1-21**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is further reduced secondary to increased hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, suggesting restenosis/thrombosis of the circumflex artery stent.
[**2134-12-14**] EKG: Sinus bradycardia with slowing of the rate as compared to the previous tracing of [**2134-12-13**].
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 14 mm Hg, PCWP mean 17 mm Hg).
The systemic arterial blood pressure was normal on levophed 0.04 mcg/min IV.
The systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were normal on levophed (SVR 1025 and PVR 112 dynes-sec/cm5).
[**2134-12-14**] L Foot x-ray: 1.
Pulmonary artery enlargement consistent with pulmonary artery  hypertension.
This was treated with IV fluids, vasopressors (discontinued [**12-15**]), and empiric vanc/cipro/zosyn, and stress-dose corticosteroids.
Blood cultures were negative from admission and are no growth to date from [**12-16**].
CTA [**12-16**] negative for PE.
#Subendocardial ischemia/type II MI - Peak CKMB 34 and troponin 1.67 on [**12-14**].
TTE [**12-14**] showed LVEF 40%, further reduced secondary to increased hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, suggesting restenosis/thrombosis of the circumflex artery stent.
Cardiac cath [**12-14**] showed 3VD, BiV diastolic dysfunction, mild pulmonary hypertension, and a normal cardiac index (on levophed).
Metoprolol started [**12-18**] and continued at discharge.
Septic shock 2.
Please follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] your PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1639**] to check your electrolytes as your potassium was low today.
Increase simvastatin to 80mg daily  Please return to the ED or call your doctor if you experience fever or chills, chest pain, difficulty breathing, severe pain, redness or swelling in your foot.
