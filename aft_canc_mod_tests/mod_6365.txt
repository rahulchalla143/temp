Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonoscopy Endoscopic ultrasound with biospy PICC placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 426**] is an 85 year-old woman with a history of CAD recently noted abdominal mass who presents with fevers/rigors and bandemia.
CT abdomen without contrast was then performed on [**4-20**] showing a large 9.5 x 7.5 x 6.0-cm heterogeneous left upper abdominal mass.
In the ED, initial vitals included T 100.9, HR 76, BP 145/61 and SaO2 96%.
CXR and UA were negative.
ROS: (+) 4lb weight loss over months; due to "poor appetite" (-) night sweats (-) chest pain, shortness of breath, palpatations (+) diarrhea after oral constrast for CT abd (+) nausea, occasional vomiting (+) BRBPR after oral constrast for CT abd (+) arthritis   Past Medical History: 1.

CT ABD ([**2140-4-20**]): 1.
CXR (5/16/0):  No consolidation or edema is evident.
The cardiac silhouette is borderline enlarged with incidental note made of mitral annulus calcification.
RUQ U/S ([**2140-4-23**]): Panc duct dilated but panc not well visualized; if pncreatitis suspected coorelate with labs GB appears distended with cholelithiasis but no GB wall thickening, fluid or CDB dilatation .
CT abd: IMPRESSION: 1.
Repeat CT: CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: Again seen in the left upper quadrant is a heterogeneous lesion centered at the pancreatic tail/splenic hilum/splenic flexure.
This lesion is centrally hypoattenuating (28 [**Doctor Last Name **]) and was previously characterized as containing blood products on the prior MRCP dated [**2140-4-25**].
This lesion has decreased in size when compared to the prior CT scan dated [**2140-4-20**] perhaps secondary to decompression after biopsy of the splenic flexure at colonoscopy as there is a description of purulent material emanating from the colonic biopsy site.
As previously described, the right kidney is smaller than the left kidney.
A followup CT scan of the thorax in 3 months is recommended.
Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2140-4-26**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
# Pancreatic adenocarcinoma: This was noted incidentially on a CT scan.
The results of the biopsy were consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Repeat scans showed that the mass was decreasing in size.
# Diverticulitis:  There was a small outpouching seen on colonoscopy that was not at the splenic flecture.
This was probed with the biopsy forcepts and immediatly opened up with some pus and blood.
It was felt that the likely etiology is what is thought to be intra-abominal abscess based on improvement of mass on repeat CT and recent history of likely diverticulitis.
Her anemia was stable for several days prior to discharge.
Has elevated lipase though exam is not overwhelming and CT does not show clear evidence of pancreatitis.
Left Lower Lobe nodule noted on CT scan.
A CT scan found an incidental mass in the pancreas and a second mass in the abdomen.
It was followed with CT scans and because it was getting better it was probably an infection.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have temperature greater than 101, shortness of breath, worsening difficulty with swallowing, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or any other symptoms that you are concerned about.
