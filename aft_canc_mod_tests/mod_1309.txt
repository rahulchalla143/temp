MRI/MRA Head - [**2196-9-19**] -  In spite of the recent CT scan report, the lesions suspected of being metastatic in etiology do not exhibit overt enhancement, arguing against this diagnosis.
However, the CT scans do not reveal calcification.
Certainly, no cervical spine imaging studies are present on the PACS system to address this issue in greater detail.
To clarify this finding further, a CT scan is advised.
[**2196-9-19**] CT Head - 1.
Evaluation for additional metastatic lesions is limited on non-contrast head CT. For restaging, CT with contrast or MRI of the brain can be obtained on a nonemergent basis.
[**2196-9-19**] EEG - This is a normal routine EEG in the waking and drowsy states.
[**2196-9-23**] Cspine XR - There is again seen a un-united fracture involving the dens with the base of C2.
There is anterolisthesis of the superior fracture fragment in relation to the base and angulation posteriorly; also unchanged with flexion or extension views.
Degenerative changes of the remainder of the cervical spine is again seen and unchanged, and the findings are most prominent at C4-5 and C5-6.
Altered Mental Status: The etiology of his initial altered mental status may have been exacerbated by the whole brain radiation which he received prior to admission, in addition to dehydration, acute renal failure, metastatic brain lesions, worsening Parkinson's Disease, and malnutrition.
Posterior displacemnt of odontoid process During work-up of patient's altered mental status, head MRI noted posterior displacement of odontoid process.
Cervical CT spine was obtained [**2196-9-23**] which showed non-united fracture involving the dens, with the base of C2.
Cervical x-ray series showed no change of fracture with flexion or extension and anterolisthesis of the superior fracture fragment in relation to the base and angulation posteriorly which does not changed with flexion or extension views.
His C-spine was cleared per orthopedic spine consult service.
Creatinine improved to .7 after hydration.
