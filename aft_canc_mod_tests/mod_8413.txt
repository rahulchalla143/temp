The patient had a cardiac workup, which included an echocardiogram, which revealed normal left ventricular function.
The patient though continued to require a PEEP of 10 and ventilatory support to maintain O2 saturations in the high 90% and PAO2s greater then 70.
Due to the patient's outlook for extended intubation secondary to respiratory failure the patient was started on total parenteral nutrition for nutritional support and by postoperative day number five the patient had been weaned to pressure support of 5 and a PEEP of 5 with adequate O2 saturations and PAO2s.
The pathology at this time is still pending and be followed up at a later date.
