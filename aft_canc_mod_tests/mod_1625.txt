CT PERFUSION: A small region of acute infarct is seen in the left parietal lobe, with associated delayed transit time and decreased blood volume and blood flow.
There is a larger area of surrounding ischemia, with delayed transit time but without corresponding decrease in blood volume.
<br>  Angiogram [**2153-7-10**]: FINDINGS: Right common carotid artery arteriogram demonstrates normal filling of the right common carotid artery and its branches.
<Br> CT HEAD [**2153-7-11**]: Most of the hyperdense material in the left MCA territory has resolved with small amount of hyperdense material remaining in the insular region, likely due to contrast enhancement of infarct.
MRI HEAD [**2153-7-11**]: Region of acute infarct is re-demonstrated along the left lenticular nucleus.
However, compared to the CT perfusion of [**2153-7-10**], the region of acute infarct appears to be more extensive, now involving the left caudate nucleus, the left insular cortex, as well as punctate foci along the centrum semiovale and small regions of cortex in the left frontal, parietal and temporal lobes.
In addition, regions of residual hyperdensity that was seen along the left centrum semiovale and extending inferiorly into the left insular region that was seen on the CT head of [**2153-7-11**] after washout of contrast enhancement, there are corresponding regions of susceptibility signal dropout, consistent with hemorrhage.
Comparison between MR head and prior CT perfusion is difficult, however, there appears to be more extensive infarcts today compared to the CT perfusion of [**2153-7-10**].
Blood products are noted along the left centrum semiovale and the left insular region.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-12-9**], no change.
<bR> TEE [**2153-7-12**]: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
A head CT following the intervention had a hyperintensity suggestive of a hemorrhage versus contrast extravasation.
His blood pressure was kept under 160 systolic, although he remained largely in the 110s without medical intervention.
Both TTE and TEE were negative for PFO or ASD.
A hypercoagulability work-up was sent and pending at time of discharge.
LDL was 128 and HDL 37; statins are relatively contraindicated in conjunction with cyclosporin, and it is felt that his lipid panel may be addressed by diet and exercise at this point.
His exam was remarkably good, however, given his initial presentation.
