Biliary Sepsis:  CT belly showed mulitple liver mets, slight obstruction of biliary stent and multiple mets at porta hepatis, peritoneal carcinamatosis and duodenal compression.
ERCP done morning of [**2180-8-30**], which showed re-obstruction [**1-31**] tumor compression, in addition to previous stent displacement into the right collection system.
His WBC count decreased from 23.1 to 15.1 on discharge.
His biliruben continued to decrease to 10.6 on discharge, and with the pneumobilia seen on CT [**9-4**], strongly suggests the new stents are patent.
His surveilence blood cx's from [**9-3**] were negative as were C.diff X 3.
Pt was treated with IV levofloxacin, until [**8-3**], when he was switched to IV Zosyn, for fear of possible ongoing infection (increasing Cr 1.7 and increased LDH to the 400's).
Cr 1.6 on discharge.
Repeat CT of the belly [**9-3**] revealed pneumobilia, "stable" peritoneal carcinamotosis (unchanged from previous study), no evidence of biliary or bowel obstruction.
Pt's cough may be related to pulmonary metastatic disease, and his liver mets are likely contributing to his elevated LFT's.
