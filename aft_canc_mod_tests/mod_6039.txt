History of Present Illness: The patient is a 57-year- old female with no history of underlying liver disease who underwent a CT scan of the chest on [**2197-5-24**], for evaluation of chest pain to rule out a pulmonary embolus.
On [**6-28**], an MRI demonstrated a 3.5-cm lesion in the posterior aspect of segment VII.
She underwent an ultrasound-guided liver biopsy on [**2197-8-1**], demonstrating benign liver parenchyma with focal bile duct proliferation, minimal portal mononuclear inflammation, scattered lobular histiocytes consistent with resolving injury.
CEA was 2.4, and hepatitis serologies were negative.
A follow-up MRI on [**2198-10-5**], demonstrated the mass lesion had increased in size, and now measured 7.6 x 6.5 cm.
A chest CT demonstrated a 4- mm, solid, noncalcified nodule in the left lower lobe that is stable since [**2196**], and presumably benign.

The procedure was notable for 1300cc of blood loss and intraoperative administration of 2 units of packed red blood cells.
Her drain output was observed to be somewhat darker though not frankly bilious at that point.
On POD5 her J-P drain output had become frankly bilious.

Before having a liver resection, imaging tests are done to help plan your surgery.
You also will need tests to check the function of your liver.
You may need blood tests to check the function of your liver.
These tests include an abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
You may need a chest x-ray to check for the spread of cancer to your lungs.
You also may need a colonoscopy to make sure your colon is free from disease.
Walking: Walking may help prevent blood clots and decrease your risk for a lung infection.
You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid staining your dressing or clothes.
Ove the next 6-12 months, your incision will fade and become less prominent.
