Had been on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis and recently hospitalized at OMED from [**2199-11-20**] to [**2199-11-22**] after a first episode generalized seizure and subsequently started on Dexamethasone, which has been weaning off since the end of [**Month (only) **], given side-effects including mood swings, insomnia, weight gain and bloating and most recent gadolinium-enhanced head MRI, as compared to his prior head MRI from [**2199-11-12**], revealed shrinkage of his mesial left frontal metastasis from 14 cm to 9 cm; there was also less cerebral edema in the adjacent brain.
He was loaded with Dilantin and given Decadron 10 mg iv; he had a NCHCT that showed a 7 mm L parietal bleed and so was transferred here, where at 22h18 he received Propofol 20 mcgs followed by infusion of 10mcg/kg/min, as well as 10 mg Vec for repeat head CT at 23h05.
On [**2198-5-4**] he presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department where an MRI revealed a 1.8 X 1.4 cm mass in the right frontal parietal area that suggested a solid tumor.
The patient subsequently had an abdominal CT on [**2198-5-7**] which indicated a mass on the left kidney with a central area of necrosis.
There was also evidence of multiple pulmonary nodules bilaterally and two discrete lesions noted in the liver that were too small to fully characterize on the CT scan.
[**8-20**] found to have new Rt-sided weakness and found to have new brain masses; [**2199-9-3**] stereotactic bx ws non-diagnositic; [**2199-9-27**] underwent cyberknife to L parasagital metastasis (2200 cGy).

There are areas of vasogenic edema, in the left frontal as well as right parietal lobe, significantly decreased in extent, compared to the prior study of [**2199-11-20**].
Tiny focus of hyperdensity left frontal lobe near vertex due  to chronic blood products in previously noted metastasis on MRI of [**2199-12-9**].
TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 axial, sagittal and coronal images were obtained following the administration of gadolinium.
Comparison was made with the previous MRI of [**2199-12-9**].
This has slightly decreased in size and enhancement compared to the prior study with decrease in surrounding edema.
In addition, a small area of enhancement is identified adjacent to the craniotomy site in the right parietal cortical/subcortical region, which has also decreased in size since the previous study with decrease in edema.
IMPRESSION:  Since the previous MRI of [**2199-12-9**], the left frontal convexity lesion has decreased in size with decrease in enhancement and surrounding edema.
EEG [**2199-12-28**]: Reportedly showed frequent right frontocentral sharps, right slowing without repitition or seizure activity; official read pending.
He was found to have right parietal bleed on a head CT from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, where he was intubated.
EEG reportedly showed frequent right frontocentral sharps, right slowing without repitition or seizure activity.
Checked an EKG (sinus tachy, left axis deviation) and enzymes (all negative).
CT with contrast was negative for PE but demonstrated increased diameter of the patient's lung masses.
We held the patient's HCTZ and increased the dose of the metoprolol.
