**FINAL REPORT [**2130-4-3**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2130-4-3**]):    NO GROWTH.
Review of imaging from the outside hospital disclosed thrombosis of the splenic and portal veins and he was started on a heparin drip with goal 40-60 (he had a significant percentage of non-enhancing pancreas on CT, presumed to be necrotic, and so heparin was not bolused and the rate was up titrated slowly to prevent hemorrhagic conversion).
EKG was sinus tachycardia without ST/T changes.
He was emergently transferred to the ICU, intubated, and repeat labs showed a significantly lower hematocrit.
He was taken quickly to CT where a scan of the chest showed no PE.
Scan of the abdomen showed active extravasation from a splenic injury.
The following day (POD#1, HD#4) he spiked a fever and blood cultures grew coag neg staph.
His CVC was removed and replaced via fresh puncture and was started on vancomycin and meropenem empirically to cover staph as well as empiric coverage for necrotizing pancreatitis.
On [**2130-3-28**] (HD # 12), the patient was taken in OR, he underwent closure of abdomen with [**State 19827**] patch and placement of negative pressure dressing.
Cardiac Echo demonstrated  mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, otherwise normal with LVEF > 55%.
Pulmonary: On admission chest xray, the patient was found to have left pleural effusion with associated retrocardiac opacity.
Following chest xrays showed increased left pleural effusion size.
aureus coag + and Haemophilus species on [**2130-3-22**], and bronchoalveolar lavage grew Staph.
He was extubated on [**2130-3-28**], and was required supplemental O2 post extubation to maintain O2 sat > 90%.
ID: The patient's blood cultures from [**3-20**] and [**3-24**] grew Staphylococcus coag negative.
Sputum cultures from [**3-23**] and [**3-24**] was positive for Staph.
The patient was continued on abx until [**4-10**], surveillance blood cultures were negative.
His last INR was 1.9 (goal [**1-19**]), and he was discharged home with instruction to follow up with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2130-4-14**] at 11 am to recheck INR.
The patient's HCT dropped on [**3-21**] to 17.9 [**1-18**] rupture of the spleen.
The patient's HCT improved and remained stable during hospitalization, no further transfusions were required.

This medication required weekly blood test to mesure your INR.
You will be followed by your PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] PCP will monitor INR and adjust Coumadin dose as necessary.
If your blood test is too high, you might be at risk for bleeding problems.
Your doctor has decided on a range on the blood test that is right for you.
The blood test used for monitoring is called an INR.
