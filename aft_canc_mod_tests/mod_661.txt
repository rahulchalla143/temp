[**2158-12-6**] [**Month/Day/Year **] - Impression: A Biliary stricture was found in the lower third of the bile duct.
[**2158-12-6**] MRCP - IMPRESSION: FINDINGS: There is a 5.4 x 3.8 cm complex cystic mass in the head and neck of the pancreas, the pancreatic duct is dilated upstream as well as downstream.
The downstream pancreatic duct demonstrates mild increased signal intensity on T1-weighted sequences, which is hypointense compared to the signal intensity of bile in the gallbladder on T2 weighted images.
The intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts are dilated and the suprapancreatic common bile duct measures 14 mm (image 3, series 7).
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
Enhancement of the intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts, possibly indicating cholangitis.
Blood and urine cultures were negative  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 15829**] is is a 59 year old male who presented with dehydration, nausea, abdominal pain, and poor appetite who was found to have a pancreatic head mass and cholangitis.
#  Cholangitis - The patient's WBC count was elevated on presentation.
#  Pancreatic head mass - Initially seen on abdominal ultrasound and concerning for malignancy.
As the patient was unable to get CT scan due to iodinated contrast  allergy, surgery recommended an MRCP for further evaluation.
Hematology oncology was consulted and their recommendations were to await the cytology and CA19-9 an abnormality in either of which would be diagnostic of pancreatic cancer.
#  Hyponatremia - The patient was hyponatremic on presentation with a serum sodium of 127.
His hyponatremia improved with IV fluids.
At that time his pressure was noted to be systolic 80-90 and a hct was 21 down from 29 (although a repeat was noted to be 24.6).
He was transfused blood and an endoscopy was performed that day in the MICU and no source of bleeding could be found.
He also had a colonoscopy which revealed a sigmoid polyp which was removed but no evidence of bleeding.
His hematocrit remained stable.
# concern for gangrenous cholecystitis on MRCP - felt to be low prob as had no abdominal pain after stenting .
Cholangitis 2.
Gastrointestinal bleed  Secondary Diagnosis: Major Depression   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) **], You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of nausea and abdominal pain.
You will need a repeat [**Last Name (Titles) **] in about 2 months.
You will also be scheduled for an endoscopic ultrasound to evaluate the lesions in your liver.
They also did a colonoscopy and removed a polyp but did not see any sign of bleeding.
Dr.[**Name (NI) 15832**] office will call you and schedule you for an endoscopic ultrasound soon.
