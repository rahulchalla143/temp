MRI revealed stable disease on [**2186-6-5**].
In the emergency department, the patient was hypotensive intermittently with a systolic blood pressures in the 90s.
Her EKG did not reveal any evidence of alternans.
A CTA was performed which did not reveal a pulmonary embolus.
Her cardiac enzymes were negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FROM ADMISSION:  Vital signs: T-max 99.4, blood pressure 115/63, heart rate 99, 16 was respiratory rate, 97% on room air.
Lung exam: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal exam: Soft, nontender and nondistended.
LABORATORY DATA FROM ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 11.1, hematocrit 39.3, platelets 228, INR 0.8, PTT 20.3, D-dimer 343, CK 77, troponin less than 0.01, chemistry profile within normal limits.
EKG normal sinus rhythm, poor R wave progression, no ST-T wave changes.
CT angiogram of the chest revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolus or dissection.
On [**6-5**], an MRI revealed a left parapharyngeal infiltrating mass similar to prior study, retention cyst in maxillary sinus, decreased size of left neck mass and fluid collection, abnormal tissue in the left mastoid tip left base of skull near left jugular foramen longus [**Last Name (un) **] muscle.
However, on the afternoon of her admission, the patient's respiratory rate increased as well as her blood pressure decreased.
A stat echocardiogram was performed which showed early evidence of tamponade-like physiology with a collection of pericardial fluid which appeared to be fibrinous.
Echocardiogram initially showed right atrial diastolic collapse with a pericardial effusion.
Her RA pressure was 12, RV was 40/15.
pulmonary artery pressure was 35/14 with a square rate sign, wedge was 15, cardiac output was 5 with an index of 2.78, SVR 1100.
However, the third blood cultures grew 1 out of 4 bottles     positive for gram-positive cocci.
