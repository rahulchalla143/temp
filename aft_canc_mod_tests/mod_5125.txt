A repeat endoscopy after 48hrs showed the known ulceration but no further active bleeding, as well as an esophageal nodule, again concerning for malignancy.
# Enterococcus urinary tract infection:  Patient was noted to have a low grade fever during his hospital course and work up yeilded a positive urine culture for enterococcus.
Given his history of metastatic prostate cancer, an MRI C spine was obtained that demonstrated multilevel cervical spine degenerative changes with spinal canal narrowing.
The MRI also demonstrated non specific enhancement at C4-5 vertebrae, and in the dura by C2/3, likely consistent with degenerative changes.
His neurological exam should be monitered for any signs of weakness/numbness in which case further evaluation should be done.
