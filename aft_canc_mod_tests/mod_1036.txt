Patient presented to [**Hospital3 18201**] on the afternoon of his admission on [**4-16**] with sytolic blood pressures in the 70's.
Per the patient's wife he was recently admitted to [**Name (NI) 29710**] [**Date range (1) 29711**] for a COPD exacerbation requiring ICU admission but he had not needed intubation.
When patient arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his pressors had been tapered to solely levophed and systolics were in the 80's.
He had atrial fibrillation with RVR to the 170's and BP again dropped to 70's.
Notably ECG showed ST depressions in V1-V4 which appeared similar to prior tracings.
Ventricular Tachycardia: ICD placed in [**2177**] for primary prevention ([**Company 1543**] [**Last Name (un) 24119**] DR, a 6949 right ventricular lead.

The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-10-17**], the severity of mitral and aortic regurgitation has increased.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended to evaluate for endocarditis.
Monitoring and support devices are stable in course and position.
[**2183-4-23**] CXR : Changes of right upper lobectomy and thoracoplasty are present.
[**2183-5-6**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**5-5**], there is little change.
Otherwise, unchanged appearance of the lung parenchyma, the cardiac silhouette and the chest wall.
[**2183-5-6**] LUNG PATHOLOGY FROM FNA / BIOPSY WITH BRONCHOSCOPY LUL : Lung (left upper lobe), fine needle aspirate:  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.
[**4-17**] ADMISSION CT IMAGING: CHEST/ABD/PELVIS REPORT  CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a small left-sided pleural effusion.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: The non-contrast appearance of the spleen, adrenal glands, stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of bowel are within normal limits.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The rectum, prostate, and intrapelvic loops of bowel are within normal limits.

CT done and no overt pulmonary emboli revealed to explain his marked hypotension.
He also had rapid atrial fibrillation on day of admission which also contributed to poor cardiac output in setting of his already poor cardiac function with baseline EF of 35%.
Otherwise, blood pressures improved overall after patient had been adequately treated with IV Vancomycin for his MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia.
MRSA BACTEREMIA: Blood cultures from admission grew out MRSA.
However, a sputum culture grew out MRSA within days of admission and his CXR had an area of patchy opacity in the lateral left lung on admission with was felt to  represent foci of pneumonia vs. aspiration.
On [**2183-5-1**] had a bronchoscopy that showed area of small collapse in LUL with question of recurrent lung cancer so interventional pulmonology team consulted and after holding Plavix dose for about a week he had lung biopsy and repeat bronchoscopy which was consistent with malignant mass and pathology revealed squamous cell lung cancer.
As above, respiratory failure required two intubations and multiple use of BIPAP and facemask at high flow to maintain oxygen saturations >88%.
Patient was also noted to have recurrent lung cancer and brain metastasis is also possible although patient was never stable enough to pursue any additional MRI or further workup for oncologic staging/management.
Unfortunately, his delerium worsened over the last few days of his ICU course and he required soft restraints and additional doses of Haldol with frequent re-orientation by staff.
