Previous PET scans have shown increased FDG avidity in the right ischial tuberosity and left L5 vertebral body and pedicle compatible with known metastases.
Past Surgical history: [**2116-6-22**]: VATS with RUL biopsy and wedge resection of right lung mass  ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**12/2115**] developed hacking productive cough, [**4-/2116**] became worse, occasional hemoptysis and Patient presented to [**Hospital3 35296**] Hospital ED where he underwent CXR [**2116-5-22**] revealing a RUL mass lesion with central cavitation.
- OSH CT of the chest w/ contrast [**2116-5-22**] 2 RUL masses identified, one in the apical segment and the other in the anterior segment.
- [**2116-6-22**] underwent OSH bronchoscopy showing fullness in the area bt the RUL and the right main stem bronchus near the carina with initial biopsies nondiagnostic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 88829**]).
- [**2116-6-22**] OSH VATS with RUL biopsy and wedge resection of right lung mass (4 X 2 X 1.5 cm fragmented lung tissue with soft necrotic tumor mass that is about 2.5 cm in greatest diameter) diagnosed as well-differentiated bronchoalveolar carcinoma (no lymph nodes assessed, positive margins), EGFR mutation testing byIHC, EGFR not detected - [**2116-6-24**] Saw Dr. [**Known firstname 449**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 33667**], Oncologist, at [**Hospital 27034**] Hospital in consultation for NSCLC but was unable to continue following with him for insurance issues.
- [**2116-8-13**] C1D1 of carboplatin and pemetrexed - [**2116-8-25**] - [**2116-8-28**] admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] for cough-induced syncope (EKG, cardiac enzymes, telemetry, TTE unremarkable).
- Restaging MRI of the brain [**2116-10-13**]: Unchanged size and appearance of enhancing small left frontal lobe lesion corresponding to an area with a punctate calcification seen on the recent head CT.
-Restaging PET CT [**2117-12-30**]: Overall increase in FDG-avidity of known right lung mass, hilar mass and subcarinal lymph node compatible with progression of disease.
