Given his symptoms the patient had an extensive workup which revealed a right lower lobe lung mass.
The MRI of the head and spine was negative.
A CAT scan was performed, which confirmed the mass in the right lower lobe.
A PET scan was positive for primary disease, but no other involvement was observed.
Vital signs temperature 98.1.
Heart rate 101.
Blood pressure 120/84.
Oxygenation 97% on room air.
HEENT examination no JVD.
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY STUDIES:  White blood cell count 9.2, hematocrit 40.2, platelets 308.
Glucose 78, BUN 13, creatinine 0.8, sodium 138, potassium 4.4.
Chest x-ray preoperatively showed a 2.6 by 1.6 cm right base pulmonary nodule, which was consistent with a given history of lung cancer.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery for further evaluation and management of his lung cancer.
The pathology showed adenocarcinoma that was moderately differentiated with predominantly papillary features and bronchial alveolar pattern.
The frozen section was negative for metastatic disease.
Estimated blood loss was 100 cc.
The chest x-ray at the time showed persistent evidence of loculated basal and pneumothorax on the right side and parenchymal density on the right side was suspicious for aspiration.
The blood gas at the time showed significant respiratory acidosis.
Bronchoscopy was performed, which revealed copious secretions bilaterally and culture of the secretions revealed gram negative rods.
On [**2145-8-31**] the patient spiked a temperature of 102 consequently Vancomycin was added to the antibiotic regimen and blood cultures were sent, which were all negative.
A repeat sputum culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, which was pan sensitive.
His urine culture from [**8-31**] grew enterococcus.
A CT scan with and without contrast was performed on [**2145-9-2**] to evaluate for possibility of a stroke.
The CAT scan showed no evidence of hemorrhage or stroke at the time.
The scan was performed given decreased movement of the lower extremities and decreased response to stimuli.
In addition a PET scan of the abdomen was performed on [**2145-9-2**] to rule out fluid collection.
Chest x-ray done on [**2145-9-7**] did not show any significant improvement.
Ultrasound of the gallbladder was performed, which showed no evidence of cholecystitis and showed echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Follow up bronchoscopies showed a decrease amount of secretions.
Follow up chest x-ray showed little change in the amount of infiltrates.
The patient's blood gas was improved.
The patient's sputum grew Klebsiella.
On [**2145-9-10**] the patient appeared to have decreasing white blood cell count, decreasing infiltrate on the chest x-ray and no more fever spikes, although he continues to have low grade temperatures.
