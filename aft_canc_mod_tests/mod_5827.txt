In the ED, initial VS were HR 135 BP 155/92 O2 82% on RA.
Her physical exam was consistent with pulmonary edema.
EKG revealed tachycardia with aberancy (left bundle pattern) new compared to prior.
Labs revealed elevated BNP at 1381 (prior 792), trop 0.16, WBC of 13.8, normal UA.
CXR revealed bilateral fluffly infiltrates, more dense infiltrates in the right upper lobe, bilateral effusions.
Initial ABG following intubation revealed respiratory acidosis (7.17 pCO2 65 pO2 117 HCO3 25), however after increasing tidal volume and rate, ventilatory efforts have improved (pH 7.34 pCO2 32 pO2 68 HCO3 18 with a Lactate of 5.3).
There was concern for LBBB on EKG initially, but cardiology fellow felt this was more consistent with sinus rhythm w/ aberrancy.
Cardiology fellow performed bedside echo which demonstrated globally decreased function with questionable wall motion abnormality of anterior and septal walls with trivial pericardial effusion and no impairment of the RV, new compared to normal echo in [**2114**].
Cardiology recommended heparin, however the patient has not had head imaging recently so heparin was held until Head CT could be performed.
Prior to leaving for CT scanner the patient's blood pressure dropped.
The patient was also sent for Chest CT prior to arrival in the CCU.

Additionally, there is increased opacification within the right upper lobe, which is new since [**2116-12-3**], as well as in bilateral lung bases which likely represent pneumonia.
CT Head: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Placed on coverage for PCP pneumonia with bactrim + steroids, and aspergillus with voriconazole given recent positive sputum culture and nodules on CT scan.
Cultures of sputum returned after the patient's passing and were (+) for MRSA, which was vancomycin-sensitive.
# Myocardial ischemia: Cardiac enzymes trending up, EF was 15-20% and echo shows global hypofunction.
# Acute Renal failure: Acute increase in creatinine from 1.0 to 2.3 with resulting hyperkalemia to 5.8.
