He complained of increased cough, SOB, at least one episode of small amount of hemoptysis and chest pain, and per ER note subjectove fevers.
CT of the chest was negative for PE but did show progression of disease with increased LUL perihilar mass, satellite lesions, endobronchial involvement of LUL and LLL small pleural effusion.
[**2138-10-7**] CT torso revealed a 4 x 4 x 3.5 cm left perihilar mass with associated lymphadenopathy in the left hilum and mediastinum with a large left hilar lymph node measuring 2.2 cm, suspicious pretracheal lymph nodes, left hilar and satellite lesions, renal calculus.
[**2138-10-7**] MRI head revealed peripherally enhancing mass 3.9 x 2.8 x 3.4 cm with edema, left cerebellar 8 x 10 x 8 peripherally enhancing lesion, also 7-mm focus in the medial temporal lobe and small right caudate lesion.
Pathology revealed metastatic carcinoma consistent with lung primary.
Postoperative MRI consistent with surgical site changes.
[**2138-12-8**], bone scan negative for metastatic disease.
Brain MRI reveals reduction in size of left cerebellar metastatic lesion and likely the right caudate, may be related to treatment, although his neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] was concerned for a small lesion in the right frontal lobe.

[**2138-12-20**] pCXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-17**] and 8: Pulmonary edema seen best in the right lung has progressed to moderately severe.
[**2138-12-17**] CXR IMPRESSION: Progression of left lung white-out likely total lung collapse, underlying known lung and hilar pathology is obscured .
[**2138-12-16**] Head CT w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes, stable in appearance, without acute intracranial abnormality.
No new mass lesions are seen, though MRI is more sensitive for the evaluation of intracranial metastatic disease.
His initial brain metastatsis was treated with neurosurgical resection in [**2138-9-11**] followed by WBRT.
Because of his poor performance status, he was not a candidiate to receive treatment to his primary tumor.
He was monitored on telemetry and his electrolytes were aggressively repleted.
# Tachycardia and Tachypnea/hypoxia/CHF: No findings of PE on CTA on admisttion.
In the setting of pulmonary progression with resulting hemoptysis and assymptomatic brain metastases, there was no clear utility to further XRT to the small assymptomatic brain met was discontinued.
#Urinary incontinence: Pt had a foley cath placed during hospital stay for close monitoring of volume status when he was hemodynaomically unstable.Foley d/c priori to d/c .
