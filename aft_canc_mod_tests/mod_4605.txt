Infant emerged with good tone and spontaneous cry, with Apgars [**9-23**], and was brought to NICU.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission, weight was noted to be 1230 grams, 10th to 25th percentile, length was 39 cm, 25th percentile, and Head circumference was 26.5 cm, 10th to 25th percentile.
A murmur was noted over course of hospitalization, and cardiac evaluation on [**1-12**] revealed normal chest x-ray, normal EKG, and normal 4 extremity blood pressures.
Murmur persisted, and cardiology was consulted with ECHO performed on [**2150-2-3**]; ECHO was normal with no structural heart disease noted.
Progression of oral feedings was slow, most likely secondary to mechanical and pain issues related to her lip [**Known lastname 68813**] (see below), but eventually, infant transitioned to all oral feedings.
Her discharge weight is 2955 grams, and she is discharged on similac 28 made with 4 calories of similac powder and 4 calories of corn oil.
Weight gain overall has been consistent, and caloric density may be able to be decreased further in the near future.
D. Heme: Maximum bilirubin was 7.5.
She received phototherapy for 6 days and maternal blood type was A positive.
Baby's blood type unknown.
Her last hematocrit was drawn on [**1-23**] which showed a hematocrit of 28 and a reticulocyte count of 2.9.
Platelet count on [**1-23**] was normal at 483.
Blood cultures were negative.
A culture was sent of the tongue on [**2-2**] which showed no evidence of yeast.
F. Neurologic: Head ultrasound performed on [**12-5**], within the 1st week of life, was normal as was a head ultrasound performed on [**1-22**], on day of life 55.
Neurologic exam was appropriate throughout.
Due to continued growth of the remainder of the lip hemangioma, infant was begun on systemic steroid therapy on [**1-21**], being given Orapred 5 mg per day (2 mg/kg/day based on weight of 2.5 kg at that time).
No significant side-effects of the steroid therapy related to blood pressure or blood sugar was noted.
Due to the number of cutaneous [**Known lastname 68813**], a liver ultrasound was performed in mid-[**Month (only) 1096**] that did not show any visceral [**Known lastname 68813**].
As mentioned above, head ultrasounds were also normal.
H. Sensory: A hearing screen was performed with automated auditory brain-stem responses and she passed on [**2150-2-2**].
A followup exam is recommended in 8 months.
Orapred dose should be weaned beginning in early [**Month (only) 404**], and growth and vital signs should be closely monitored while on the steroid therapy.
Prematurity at 30 weeks.
