She thus presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for further evaluation.
At the OSH ED, her initial VS were BP 204/100, P 138, R 36, O2 99% on RA.
While in the CT scanner, she became increasingly hypoxic and confused and was emergently intubated.
EKG at the time demonstrated STE in V2 with ST depressions in V3-V6, so she was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent cardiac catheterization.
She was found to have a PCWP of 25, and bedside TTE demonstrated an EF of 25-30%.
She developed tachycardia to the 160s, for which she received Adenosine x3 and carotid massage, which did not improve the tachycardia.
She became hypotensive to SBP of 70, was started on Levophed, and was transferred to the CCU.
Per her family, she has been complaining of frequent sweating, an increase in her resting tremor, and recent diarrhea.

Plasma Metanephrines and MEN2 AND FMTC MUTATIONS:   Test                          Result              Reference Range/Units EXONS 10,11,13-16             SEE NOTE  RESULT: NO MUTATION DETECTED  Interpretation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of the RET [**Last Name (un) **]-oncogene (exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16) was negative for mutations associated with MEN2 or FMTC.
Mutation identification can be used to confirm a diagnosis, screen individuals at risk for familial disease, or distinguish familial from sporadic disease.
In this assay, sequences including exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the RET [**Last Name (un) **]-oncogene are amplified from genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by nucleotide sequence analysis on an automated capillary DNA sequencer.
[**5-7**] post-line CXR:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a left IJ catheter that extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
MRI Abdomen 3.1 cm right adrenal mass, nonspecific by imaging, but apparantly hemorrhagic in nature.
[**5-27**] TTE Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-5-12**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is increased  Pathology: Right Adrenal Gland Tissue: Pending   Brief Hospital Course: # Adrenal mass: On admission to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**], CT-A was performed to evaluate for PE (was negative for PE).
MRI was obtained and could not characterize the adrenal mass further.
Final pathology results of adrenal tissue pending at time of discharge.
Her pressures remained in the 100s-120s/40s-50s for the next several days.
Her echo with apical sparing were consistent with a catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy, and her hypertension on presentation as well as reports of episodic diaphoresis and nausea from her husband, were all consistent with pheochromocytoma.
Her lactate, which had been elevated to 8 with her most profound hypotension, improved to 2 shortly after pressors were weaned.
She was transitioned to doxazosin 1 mg po BID and labetalol 200 mg po BID with stability in her blood pressure.
# SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Cardiac cath demonstrated no coronary disease but elevated PCWP to 25.
ECHO showed depressed EF 20-25% with apical sparing, and troponin was elevated to 7.
Repeat TTE after resolution of hypotension showed slightly improved EF, but with persistent systolic dysfunction.
ECHO prior to discharge showed improving myocardial function with EF of 50%.
Blood gas on arrival demonstrated  acidemia (7.08) and hypoxemia.
Once her blood pressure stabilized, fluid was removed with CVVHD and her mental status improved, she was extubated on [**2129-5-15**] without any complications.
Head CT on [**5-13**] was negative.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Likely secondary to hypotension and consequent dense ATN, her creatinine continued to rise and she made <10cc/h of urine in the first few hours at [**Hospital1 18**].
She made over two liters of fluid the day prior to discharge with stability in her creatinine and other electrolytes.
Patient will follow up with labs two days after discharge and see renal on [**6-8**] for further evaluation.
In the setting of concominant pressor-requiring hypotension, she was given bicarb gtt and  She later developed a concominant alkalosis (normal bicarb and anion gap 25) due to the CVVHD bath.
Blood cultures were negative.
CXR did not show infiltrate concerning for infection.
# Anemia: Hct fell from 45 to 26.3 on [**5-14**].
Hemolysis labs were negative.
The drop was thought to be secondary to decreased production in the setting of critical illness - retic count was suppressed at ~ 1% and also RP bleed, likely from cardiac cath on [**5-7**].
CT scan on [**5-17**] showed RP bleed contained within the pelvis.

This mass caused changes in your blood pressure and acute kidney failure.
You will need to have your labs checked this week to follow your kidney function.
A cardiac catheterization did not show any blockages in your coronary arteries.
