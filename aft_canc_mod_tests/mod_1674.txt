HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient arrived in the hospital on the evening of [**6-22**] and evaluation was initiated.
Because of continued increase in white cell count from 14.3 on postoperative day #4 to 16.0 on postoperative day #5, the patient was sent for an abdominal CT.
The patient's neuro-oncologist requested head CT be obtained to rule out any new brain metastases with bleeding because this would determine the patient's suitably for anticoagulation.
The head CTs were negative and per neuro-oncology, there was no contraindication to anticoagulating the patient.
At the suggestion of the patient's oncology team, the surgery team also transfused the patient with 1 unit packed red blood cells on postoperative day #8 for borderline low hematocrit of 26.1.
