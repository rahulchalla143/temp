Secondary myelodysplastic syndrome leading to acute myelogenous leukemia by bone marrow biopsy in [**2122-1-28**]; now at day plus 97 status post allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplant from a [**7-4**] matched sibling donor.
Vital signs revealed her temperature was 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 126/80, her respiratory rate was 16, and her heart rate was 88.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed extraocular muscles were intact.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Distal pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves II through XII were intact.
Back revealed bilateral costovertebral angle tenderness to palpation with mild perivertebral tenderness.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Her white blood cell count was 2.2, her hematocrit was 30.2, and her platelet count was 44.
Absolute neutrophil count was 1590.
Electrolytes revealed sodium was 135, potassium was 4.2, chloride was 104, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 20, and creatinine was 1.2.
Her albumin was 3.4, magnesium was 4, and calcium was 8.9.
Cyclosporine level from [**2-9**] was 502.
Viral culture was negative for influenza A/B.
Viral antigen negative for respiratory syncytial virus.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest computed tomography with contrast revealed (1) slightly speculated 1.4-cm left upper lobe nodule which had arisen since the prior chest computed tomography in [**2122-10-28**]; given the patient's fever this most likely represents an infectious process, consider Aspergillosis; (2) probable radiation changes at the right apex unchanged; and, (3) persistent right-sided pleural effusion which had decreased in size since previous chest computed tomography on [**2122-11-23**].
A chest x-ray revealed a new ill-defined nodular opacity in the left upper lobe concerning for atypical infection, stable appearance of the chest with right apical pleural opacity and right-sided volume loss.
The Interventional Radiology team was then consulted who determined that the location of the lesion was not accessible by computed tomography scan biopsy due to obstruction by surrounding vessels.
They had other recommendations; including obtaining a magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine to rule out the possibility of a paraspinal or epidural abscess accounting for her ongoing new back pain and to consider an echocardiogram to rule out the small possibility of septic embolus from the vegetation.
On [**2-13**], the patient was prepared for a video-assisted thoracic surgery by Cardiothoracic Surgery; however, in the hour prior to the operation, the patient's blood cultures came back with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia.
Subsequent surveillance cultures were unrevealing.
On [**2-15**], a repeat chest computed tomography was done to re-evaluate the lung nodule which had shown a slight increase in appearance.
She was continued on vancomycin, and caspofungin, and AmBisome while her cultures were pending.
On [**2-23**], the cultures from the video-assisted thoracic surgery grew out nocardia.
This lesion was suspicious for a septic embolus, and a Dermatology consultation was obtained and a biopsy was done.
The biopsy with associated cultures did show microabscesses but did grow out gram-positive rods consistent with nocardia.
NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient was found to have a left upper lobe nodule that nocardia growth and Dermatology biopsy that had nocardia growth.
Given the 40% chance of central nervous system involvement and the patient's worsening mental status on the dates of [**2-25**] and [**2-26**], a magnetic resonance imaging was done which did show two lesions that sere suggestive of infection; likely to be nocardia given this clinical scenario.
The magnetic resonance imaging showed a small 5-mm ring enhancing lesion in the left occipital lobe with associated edema and a small 3-mm lesion within the right cerebellar hemisphere.
The patient was planned to have a subsequent bone marrow biopsy to further evaluate this finding.
RENAL ISSUES:  The patient's creatinine did worsen throughout her hospital stay; at times reaching as high as a creatinine of 2.
The patient did initially respond to a decrease in her cyclosporine and adjustment of some of her medications; however, at the time of this dictation, her creatinine remained at 2 despite serial decreases in her cyclosporine.
Her fractional excretion of sodium was calculated at 5%.
A urine protein creatinine ratio was pending at the time of this dictation.
A chest x-ray was done at the time of this new oxygen requirement and showed multifocal infiltrates; one of which, in the right upper lobe, appeared larger, and the remaining infiltrates were without significant change.
