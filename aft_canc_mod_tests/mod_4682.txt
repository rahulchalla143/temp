MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2170-8-26**] Expected appearance of the large acute hematoma centered in the  inferomedial aspect of the left temporal lobe with intraventricular extension, mass effect and slight uncal herniation, stable.
The examination performed for pre-operative planning.
[**8-30**] CT head: IMPRESSION: Expected post-surgical appearance after left frontotemporal craniotomy and temporal lobe resection, without change in the previously-seen 3-4 mm shift of midline structures and minimal left uncal herniation.
Head CT showed L parietal IPH.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
She was admitted to the neurological service and MRI head was done.
MRI showed underlying mass.
Post operatively she was extubated and transfered to the ICU for strict blood pressure control less than 140 systolic and q1 neuro checks.
Frozen section sent from the OR was consistent with high grade glioma.
On post op exam she was awake and alert with eyes open and following commands on her left side.
She was noted to have dense R hemiplegia on exam and complete expressive aphasia, her R facial droop remained.
24 hour EEG monitoring was obtained to evaluate for seizure activity.
On [**8-31**] patient remained stable, EEG monitoring continued.
Routine post op MRI was performed revealing small left infarct and residual tumor.
On [**9-1**] EEG and a-line were discontinued and she was cleared for transfer to the stepdown unit.
Her exam continues to improve with RLE [**2-23**], full strength on L and 0/5 in RUE.
