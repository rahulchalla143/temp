Her O2 sats dropped to 90% on a NRB.
While it was hoped that her intubation was only for the bronch, she instead required mechanical ventilatory support until [**2107-9-21**].
On [**9-10**], she developed a pneumothorax on the R side that was moderate sized (R IJ TLC was placed on evening of [**9-8**] with 2 subsequent CXRs not demonstrating a ptx, had bronch [**9-9**], then had ptx on CXR [**9-10**], so unclear etiology.)
She had another episode of bleeding and underwent repeat bronchoscopy [**2107-9-14**].
Cardiovascular:  On admission, she had an echo that showed an EF >55%, with 1+ MR.  On the evening of [**9-8**], Mrs. [**Known lastname 50155**] went into a-fib with RVR, rates up to 170s and bp 70s/40s.
She initially did not respond to any of these measures, and the dilt gtt was maxed out at 20 mg/hr.
She remained in NSR while on BMT as she was originally monitored on telemetry, which was eventually discontinued.
Her induced sputum was immunofluroescent negative for PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] rest of her bronch studies were negative for organisms other than the spore mentioned above.
She had a negative urine culture and CXR showed a possible worsening of her LLL infiltrate.
Hematology:  Her bone marrow biopsy on [**9-6**] was negative for blasts, as was a repeat biopsy [**9-24**].
She received packed red blood cells and platelets every other day, to keep a hematocrit greater than 25 and platelets greater than 20K (given the fear that she had bled into her lungs, it was felt that a platelet transfusion threshold of 20K was more advantageous than 10K).
It was felt that her low hematocrit was [**1-17**] to her MDS and was not the result of another process.
She did have evidence of hemolysis, with a low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, elevated indirect bilirubin, and a reticulocyte count of 6%.
Because of her large transfusion requirements and possible hemolysis, a super-Coombs and an anti-platelet antibody test were sent, and were pending at time of discharge.
On examination of her bone marrow biopsy, the attending heme pathologist felt that it was likely her cells were so dysplastic they did not survive long in the periphery.
Prior to d/c a conversation was had with the patient where it was discussed and agreed upon by everybody (including the attending Hematologist) that there was no further treatment indicated for her MDS, and she would continue with symptomatic transfusions.
On d/c her WBC count was also low, with an ANC of 1100.
The hemochromatosis genetic mutations were sent and were pending at time of discharge.
Her ferritin was greater than [**2102**].
Followup Instructions: Please f/u with your Hematologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5292**] at [**Last Name (LF) 4068**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] his discretion.
