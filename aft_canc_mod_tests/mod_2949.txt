Admission Date:  [**2169-5-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2169-5-30**]  Date of Birth:   [**2101-2-11**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was transferred from an outside hospital for a cardiac catheterization because he ruled in for a myocardial infarction.
He also noted occasional mild left-sided chest pain for which he went to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2169-5-25**] where an EKG showed diffuse ST depressions and where he ruled in for myocardial infarction.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital6 2018**] where a cardiac catheterization was performed.
His oxygen saturation was around 90% on 4 liters nasal cannula 02.
His arterial blood gas was 7.47, 41, and 81 on arrival to the floor.
Per the patient, there is a question of a lung nodule on a recent CT scan.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  On [**2169-5-26**], the temperature was 98.4, pulse 90s, blood pressure 90s-150s/60s, respiratory rate 30s, 02 saturation 88-94% on 100% nonrebreather, 80% on room air.
Chest:  Velcro-like crackles one-quarter up bilaterally, otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased air movement.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  WBC 14.3, hematocrit 36.6, platelets 271,000.
The differential revealed neutrophils 81%, bands 0%, lymphs 11%.
Sodium 134, K 3.9, CL 93, C02 28, BUN 12, creatinine 0.6, glucose 112.
The CKs were 608, 467, and 409.
Chest x-ray on admission showed diffuse alveolar and reticular infiltrates bilaterally, greatest at the bases.
A CT of the chest was performed.
He also developed hypotension and required Neo-Synephrine and two days later Vasopressin in order to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60 mmHg.
His oxygen saturation was difficult to maintain at 90% even with increasing his positive end-expiratory pressure.
Likewise, his hypotension did not show any improvement during his ICU course.
Given these clinical findings, the overall impression was that his prognosis was very poor, especially given the interstitial lung disease seen on CT scan.
There was no oculocephalic reflex noted and he was also unresponsive even when he was off sedation.
Cardiac catheterization, with attempted percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of coronary artery.
