She was again evaluated at [**Hospital3 20284**] Center in [**Hospital1 189**] where CT and MRI showed dilated intrahepatic ducts and CBD with proximal narrowing near the cystic duct concerning for Mirizzi's syndrome.
Ms. [**Known lastname 4135**] was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Past Medical History: PMH: A.fib (not anticoagulated), DM2, HTN, dyslipidemia, anemia  PSH: percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, wisdom tooth extraction, cataract surgery, ERCP - at [**Hospital3 **] (date unknown), ERCP - [**2141-7-14**] aborted, ERCP [**2141-7-17**] [**Hospital1 18**]   Social History: No tobacco or recreational drug use.

Gallstones are not seen on CT and ultrasound would be helpful to document an obstructing stone in the cystic duct.
[**2141-7-27**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST - Persistent mild dilatation of the left biliary ducts which is improved from the [**2141-7-18**] CT.
She noticed worsening jaundice and represented to [**Hospital3 20284**] Center in [**Hospital1 189**] where a CT and MR imaging showed dilated intrahepatic ducts and dilated CBD with proximal narrowing, concerning for Mirizzi's syndrome initially.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
On [**2141-7-17**], an ERCP was re-performed and a circumferential infiltrating mass causing near complete obstruction was noted at the second part of duodenum and biopsies were performed which yielded chronic duodenitis, but no malignancy.
A CT scan performed on [**7-18**] demonstrated moderate-to-severe intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
On [**7-20**], PTC was performed showing occlusion of the upper CBD with biliary dilitation above.
She had a CXR on [**7-23**] which demonstrated findings concerning for RLL pneumonia and she was monitored closely with chest PT and encouragement of IS.
Her blood pressure dropped and her HR was elevated.
As noted above, her RLL infiltrate was of concern and work-up at the time demonstrated findings consistent with a UTI.
Her bile culture speciated MRSA which was treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
On [**7-27**], repeat PTC was performed and PTBD demonstrated persistent dilatation of the left biliary system, thus metal stenting was not attempted.
The patient underwent a CT scan again on [**7-27**] showing persistent mild dilatation of the left biliary ducts which is improved from the [**2141-7-18**] CT.
On [**5-27**] her PTBD drain remained capped with her metal biliary and duodenal stents in place on cholangiography.
