In the ED, VS were: T97.7, HR110, BP 115/58, RR22, 100%RA.
In the ED, her K was noted to be elevated, and EKG showed peaked T waves.
An emergent renal U/S showed worsening bilat hyrdonephrosis.
She received Levaquin 500mg IV x1, Calcium gluconate 1g x1, amp D50 + 10u SC insulin, Kayexylate 30mL x1 and was taken to the IR suite for placement of (bilateral vs unilateral) percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement.
Subsequent repeat biopsy [**8-3**] found residual/recurrent CIS.
Colon pathology demonstrated adenocarcinoma involving lymphatics, submucosa, and superficial part of muscularis propria.
Omental specimens confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma, predominantly signet ring cell type.

A c dif toxin was negative.
Metabolic Acidosis: This was a mixed anion-gap, non-anion gap acidosis due to a combination of renal failure (incr AG), hyperphosphotemia (incr AG), increased ostomy output (low AG), and dilutional acidosis from IVF (low AG).
Please draw: Na, K, Cl, bicarbonate, BUN, Cr, CBC and send results to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 2405**] (phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 56399**]) 4.
