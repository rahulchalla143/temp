ECHO [**2140-9-29**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function.
CHEST CT [**2140-9-28**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO was done which showed no abnormoalities or effusions, TSH was normal, no chest pain to suggest pericarditis and no evidence of ishcemia.
ECHO showed good valve function and no wall motion abnormalities.
Metoprolol: to lower your heart rate and possibly prevent the atrial flutter.
