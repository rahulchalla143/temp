[**7-24**] MR L spine FINDINGS: There is a transitional vertebra between the lumbar spine and the sacrum.
For the purposes of this dictation, the most inferior disk will be referred to as S1/2, and the transitional vertebra will be referred to as partially lumbarized S1.
There is a suggestion of cortical destruction in the posterior inferior endplate of L3, posterior superior endplate of L4, posterior inferior endplate of L5, and posterior superior endplate of S1.
There is no bone marrow edema on the STIR images to suggest that these fractures are acute.
In addition, there is a shallow, small epidural mass extending from the posterior vertebral body into the right neural foramen, which may represent epidural tumor or a mottled osteophyte- CT could provide differentiation between the two etiologies.
Cortisol stim test was normal.
C diff was neg x 2 but patient was treated with empiric flagyl.
An MRI was negative for nerve impingement or cord compression.
Transfused to Hct > 28.
