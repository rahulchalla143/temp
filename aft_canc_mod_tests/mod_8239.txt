Admission Date:  [**2101-7-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-7-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-4-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: headaches  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2101-7-21**]- cerebral angiogram with embolization of tumor [**2101-7-22**]- Bicoronal craniotomy for tumor excision   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 39606**] initially presented for consultation for a brain tumor.
It was recommended that he undergo an angiogram to evaluate the vasculature and possible embolization with subsequent craniotomy and resection.
Discharge exam: -  AOX3, PERRL, face symmetric, tongue midline -  Wound - with staples clean/dry/intact -  Strength - bil AT/G/[**Last Name (un) 938**] [**3-14**], b/l q/h/il [**5-14**]    Pertinent Results: [**2101-7-22**] Head CT without Contrast:  Expected postoperative pneumocephalus and trace hyperdensity in the surgical resection cavity.
Small amount of hypoattenuation in the left frontal subcortical white matters likely reflect preexisting peritumoral edema, but could be further assessed on followup exams to exclude infarct.
[**2101-7-23**] Head CT without Contrast:  Unchanged examination with unchanged pneumocephalus and hyperdensity in the resection cavity and left greater than right frontal peritumoral edema.
[**7-28**] CT head -  Brief Hospital Course: Pt electively presented on [**7-21**] and underwent a cerebral angiogram and embolization of his tumor using coils and onyx.
A CTV and MRI Wand were ordered for preop planning.
Post-operative CT scan demonstrated expected postoperative pneumocephalus and trace hyperdensity in the surgical resection cavity with small amount of hypoattenuation in the left frontal subcortical white matter, reflects preexisting peritumoral edema.
Throughout the day on, patient became increasingly weak in his lower extremites, prompting repeat head CT and MRV, which showed no hemorrhage or thrombosis.
Out of concern for focal seizures cause leg weakness, EEG was ordered.
On [**7-24**], the patient's blood pressure constraints were liberalized to 120 < SBP < 160.
Cultures of the lesion were sent as well as a small tissue sample.
Right IJ doppler showed echogenic material consistent with wall trauma vs. non-occlusive thrombus.
On [**7-28**], a CT head was obtained which showed no evidence of infarct or new hemorrhages.
Information was obtained from Patient.
Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 6689**] - [**Location (un) 6691**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Porcine meningioma Oral HSV Lower extremity weakness Cerebral Edema Constipation High blood pressure post-op   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
