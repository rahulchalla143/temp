An x-ray of her back was taken and she was told she had a "pinched nerve" for which she was treated with one week of a prednisone taper and vicodin with good improvement.
The following week, on [**2124-8-28**], she had a fever at home as well as rash on her arms and legs, which was raised and painful to touch.
She was seen by her PCP Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2124-8-30**]; CXR and blood tests were performed.
Based on the results of the blood tests, she was referred to oncology.
During her hospital admission, bone marrow biopsy was performed that showed 18% blasts concerning for high grade myelodysplastic syndrome as well as granulomas concerning for fungal infections.
Infectious work-up included TTE, CT abdomen/pelvis, BCxs and stool studies that were unremarkable.
CXR showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrate, predominantely perihilar in distribution, and b/l pleural effusions.

CXR showed diffuse b/l pulmonary infiltrates and small pleural effusions.
Her blood pressures remained fluid responsive to both IVF and PRBCs (1 unit).
Her respiratory status and blood pressures improved during her ICU stay and were stable prior to transfer back to the general medical floor.
A chest x-ray showed possible LUL pneumonia, which was treated emperically with vanco/zosyn.
Work up at OSH included CT abdomen, CT chest, TTE, BCx, and stool studies which were been unremarkable.
Urine was weakly positive for histoplasma antigen at OSH, and she was started on amphotericin.
Urine culture on admission grew 10-100K VSE and BAL returned bloody fluid.
Otherwise blood, urine, and BAL cultures were unremarkable, including repeat urine culture.
She continued to spike fevers, and CT a/p showed no source of infection, although did mention fluid in the endometrial cavity.
Spiked spontaneously on one evening, and initially the chest x-ray was concerning for LUL pneumonia, and the patient was started on vancomycin/zosyn for treatment of ventilator acquired PNA.
In the interim, the patinet's urine culture grew out VRE, only susceptible to linezolid.
The patient was discharged on the remainder of a 3 day course of levaquin and voriconazole which she was to continue until final results of the histo PCR were complete.
# Pancytopenia: Bone marrow biopsy from OSH reportedly showed 18% blasts with myelodysplasia concerning for new diagnosis of AML.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy was consistent with MDS as opposed to AML.
The patient's white blood cell count continued to drop through the admission, and she did become neutropenic; her neutropenia was attributed to her underlying MDS.
Transfusions goals are 1 unit for a hematocrit of less than 24 or platelets less than 30.
Per OSH records, biopsy was sent to [**Last Name (un) **] Life Sciences for outside consultation.
Biopsy slides were arranged to be sent to our pathology department.
During this hospitalization, C. diff antigen x 2 and PCR were all negative.
Follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3759**] for further evaluation and management of her myelodysplastic syndrome.
Check chem 10 and CBC on Friday [**9-29**] and follow up as needed including electrolyte repletions and blood and platelet transfusions if needed (for a hematocrit < 25 or platelets < 30).
Calcium 500 500 mg calcium (1,250 mg) Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
We also determined that you likely have myelodysplastic syndrome, which will require further workup and treatment as an outpatient.
You had a skin biopsy while you were here.
You need to have your sutures removed two weeks after the biopsy which was [**9-18**], so the sutures should be removed on or around [**10-1**].
Until then the dressing on the wound from your biopsy should be changed daily and the wound treated with vaseline.
