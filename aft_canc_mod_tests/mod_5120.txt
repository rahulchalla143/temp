ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.

Post procedure echo showed nearly complate removal of pericardial effusion.
[**2-10**] ECHO GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
***IMAGING*** [**2-9**] CXR IMPRESSION: Right pleural effusion likely with a subpulmonic component resulting in adjacent atelectasis of the right lung base.
[**2-10**] CT CHEST IMPRESSION: 1.
Renal ultrasound may be considered for more complete assessment, as discussed by telephone with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2186-2-10**].
Signs of pericardial tamponade were seen on initial echo with improvement of hemodynamics and no residual effusion after tap.
Echo done on [**2-10**] showed no pericardial effusion.
CBC of fluid has 60% "other" cells that are non-lymphoid and likely represent malignant clones.
Cell count is [**Numeric Identifier 6085**]/uL.
Fluid Gram stain negative for microorgs.
Pt underwent repeat ECHO, which showed improvement in RV dilatation, and no pericardial effusion.
# Pleural effusions: CT scan showed right sided pleural effusion with small anterior loculations, RML/RLL collapse.
Blood culture no growth to date.
CT scan of pelvis will be considered in near future pending decision re: goals of care with primary oncologist as outpatient.
Breast cancer: Stage IIIB, ER/PR/HER2 triple negative with progression to metastatic disease.
Of note, tumor was large and approached the chest wall treated with neoadjuvant cyclophosphamide and taxotere, surgery, and XRT to the chest wall.
Repeat ECHO did not show pericardial effusion.
The fluid was removed and the echocardiogram today showed that you had no fluid reaccumulation today.
Your chest x-ray showed the pleural effusions were somewhat better.
You have a CT of your abdomen and pelvis ordered to better assess some fluid collection around your kidneys.
Followup Instructions: Oncology: Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 67735**] office tomorrow to check on CT of your abdomen and pelvis and to discuss timing of chemotherapy.
