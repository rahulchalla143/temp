The patient is a 61 year old male with a history of a recently diagnosed by CT scan of the chest on [**2187-5-15**] RCC measuring 15 x 4 x 13.8 cm with extensive metastatic disease including extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, multiple pulmonary nodules, bone mets, ascites, and soft tissue attenuation within the region of the greater omentum suspicious for peritoneal carcinomatosis on Sutent chemotherapy who presented to the ER on [**2187-7-14**] with the chief complaint of lightheadedness, dizziness and increased shortness of breath.
Of note, the patient takes atenolol, lisinopril and triamterene/HCTZ at baseline and was taking these until 2 days ago as he felt his BP might be low.
His SBP on presentation 70 systolic.
The patient had 2 18 gauge peripheral IVs placed and was given a total of 3 liters of IVF with a systolic blood pressure in the low 100s.
The patient was also found to have acute renal failure with a Cr of 3.9 (baseline Cr 1.6-1.9) and BUN of 59.
CK 130, MB 10, MBI 7.7, troponin 0.10.
His Hct was 40 (baseline 36-43) and on rectal had gross blood around the rectum with a history of internal/external hemorrhoids.
In addition to IVF, the patient was given vanc/levo/flagyl empirically for ?sepsis with no clear source on CXR although there was a suspicion for ?RLL infiltrate on CXR by the ED.
His EKG showed: .
NSR at 83 bpm.
QTC 412 ms. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] in I, Q in lead III.
Given his acute renal failure, the patient was unable to obtain a CT-A and given his metastatic disease, a VQ scan was felt to be unhelpful as well.
The patient had been hospitalized at [**Hospital 42317**] Hospital in [**4-28**] for ?pneumonia for which he was treated with levaquin and had a chest CT which diagnosed the RCC with mets.
HTN internal/external hemorrhoids Metastatic renal cell carcinoma - diagnosed in [**4-28**] on chest CT for workup of chronic cough, ?

Pertinent Results: EKG [**2187-7-14**]: NSR at 83 bpm.
QTC 412 ms. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] in I, Q in lead III.
CXR [**2187-7-14**]: Probable diffuse metastatic disease including mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, as well as pulmonary edema.
Head CT [**2187-7-14**]: .
Echo [**2187-7-14**].
A DVT was confirmed on LE doppler and echo showed RV systolic dysfunction.
A CTA could not be done because patient had ARF.
Oxygen saturation improved over course of stay.
Paracentesis was performed on [**2187-7-22**].
