She was seen by PCP [**2125-1-9**], felt to have viral URI, symptoms persisted, and seen again [**2125-1-23**] with persistent cough (intermittently productive, yellow-white), single episode of hematuria (clear red, not clot), and LLQ abdominal pain, treated with azithromycin, and abdominal US obtained which revealed new splenomegaly with new 1.5-cm echogenic area.
Pt presented to the ED with VS: 98.1 79 113/69 16 100%RA.
In the ED, CXR with LUL collapse, CT ABD/PELVIS with multiple new metastasis, and new mass in bladder.
BP then noted to drop to 70/37, pt received total 2L IVF, although timing unclear, with BP improved to 102/55s (?dehyration vs sepsis vs morphine).
CT head obtained in anticipation of possible anticoagulation.
- glucose intolerance (not on meds, a1c 6.1->5.5) - glaucoma - cancer screening: colonoscopy on [**2123-5-26**] showed 2 adenomatous  polyps, one in the transverse colon and the other in the descending colon.
ABD: soft, NT, + BS, +splenomegaly, ~5inches from CV angle.
Lymphocytes comprise <1% of total analyzed events.
B-cells are scant in number precluding evaluation of clonality.
Cell marker analysis was attempted, but was non-diagnostic in this case due to insufficient numbers of cells.
AP AND LATERAL CHEST [**2125-2-8**]:  COMPARISON: [**2125-2-5**].
Cell block, "[**2125-2-2**]":  Blood and  rare atypical but markedly degenerated urothelial cells and a few lymphoid cells, see note.
Cell block, "[**2125-2-3**]":  Blood and  rare atypical but markedly degenerated urothelial cells and a few possible lymphoid cells, see note.
Portable AP chest dated [**2125-2-5**] is compared to the chest CT from [**2125-2-2**] and chest radiograph of [**2125-2-1**].
The heart is normal in size; however, there is marked opacification of the left heart border and retrocardiac region which may represent atelectasis/consolidation and pleural effusion.
Squamous cells, anucleate squames, red blood cells,   crystals.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
COMPARISONS: Limited comparison to a recent CT of the abdomen from [**2125-2-1**] which depicted the lung bases.
TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the chest were obtained without [**Year (4 digits) 3173**] contrast, and coronal and limited sagittal reformatted images, including the spine, were also performed.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The patient was inadvertently imaged during submaximal inspiration/partial expiration; there is apparently slightly greater than 50% narrowing of the anteroposterior dimension of the mid trachea, an appearance suggestive of tracheomalacia.
This appearance was better depicted on the prior CT of the abdomen.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2125-2-1**] 4:14 AM  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: eval for diverticulitis, signs of C-diff Field of view: 45 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 85 yo F w/ CLL and climbing WBC, fatigue, cough, T 99, LLQ pain, recent Azithro REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for diverticulitis, signs of C-diff CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There is a large 5.6 x 3.2 cm mass in the inferior mediastinum at the G-E junction.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a large lobulated mass within the right superior lateral wall of the bladder measuring 6.0 x 2.9 cm.
IVC venogram demonstrated no thrombosis in left iliac, IVC, and both renal veins were noted at L2 level.
Final abdominal x- ray demonstrated proper location and position of IVC filter in infrarenal IVC.
Metastatic cancer of unknown primary Presented with hematuria, found to have new bladder mass on CT scan, in addition to peritoneal and lung mass.
Per urology, biopsy of mass not advisable given risk of procedure (bleeding, poor functional status).
Instead, urine cytology collected (multiple samples), which were not diagnostic by pathology.
The main symptoms were pain and dyspnea both were treated with oxycontin and oxycodone.
Constipation - on senna, colace and lactulose.
Pulmonary embolism: IVC filter placed [**2-1**].
Systemic anticoagulation deferred in setting of hematuria.
CLL/hemolytic anemia: The patient's labs showed evidence of a hemolytic anemia.
