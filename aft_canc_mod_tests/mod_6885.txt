Mediastinum is shifted into the left chest, therefore displacement of the right heart border to the right of the spine, probably represents interval increase in heart size or pericardial effusion.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Subsequently with positive pressure ventilation there were more air bubbles noted in the LV.
Neuro exam reassuring and stable.
# ST depressions: STDs noted on tele peri-bronchoscopy, but 12 lead EKG reassuring.
Cardiac enzymes cycled and troponins down trended with flat CK's, thought to be most likely demand ischemia.
# Hypotension: Baseline SBP on the floor 80s to 100s, maintained pressures of SBP ~80 while in the ICU post procedure.
Her blood pressure returned to her baseline on the floor after her call out of the ICU.
Her hemoptysis improved significantly post procedure, with only small amounts of blood tinged sputum being coughed up at the time of discharge.
Her hematocrit remained stable, and the groin hematoma improved and was soft with overlaying ecchymosis at the time of discharge.
# DM: Blood sugars controlled with a humalog sliding scale.
You had a repeat chest CT prior to discharge.
