[**2196-11-11**] CT ABD/PELVIS: CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There is mild linear bibasilar atelectasis.
Examination of the sigmoid and descending colon including the splenic flexure demonstrates thickening of the bowel walls with areas of surrounding fat stranding as well as areas of mucosal enhancement.
CT SINUS [**11-16**] FINDINGS: There is mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells as well as minimal mucosal thickening of the inferior left maxillary sinus and frontethmoidal recess on the left.
CT CHEST [**11-16**] 1.
CT ABDOMEN [**11-17**] 1.
CT MAXILLOFACIAL [**11-19**] 1.
Extensive soft tissue swelling, which is centered in the right oropharyngeal mucosal space and palatine fossa, extends into the right pyriform sinus of the hypopharynx and likewise involves the right submandibular space and right neck soft tissue planes.
CT CHEST [**11-22**] 1.
Consider echo for initial further evaluation if not already performed.
CT SINUS [**11-22**] 1.
Evidence of new right lung pneumonia and atelectasis, better evaluated by the chest CT performed on the same day.
PORTABLE CXR [**12-1**] Left internal jugular line ends at mid SVC.
Right upper lobe pneumonia, though unchanged since prior radiograph dated [**2196-11-28**], is smaller as compared to radiographs through [**11-22**] to [**2196-11-23**].
CXR [**2196-12-18**] Compared with [**2196-12-17**] at 19:40 p.m. and allowing for differences in technique, the radiographic appearance is similar.
[**2196-10-31**] BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS:Increased blasts consistent with residual myeloid leukemia, see note.
There are circulating blasts and marrow blasts are enumerated at 18%.
Differential shows: 70% neutrophils, 13% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, 4% eosinophils, 2% meta, 1% myelo, 4% blasts, 2% nRBC.
Differential (500 cell):  18% Blasts, 2% Myelocytes, 5% Metamyelocytes, 60% Bands/Neutrophils, 12% Lymphocytes.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The core biopsy is adequate for evaluation.
Overall, most of the findings are similar to those seen in a previous biopsy (S11-48147M; [**2196-10-31**]).
The white cell count is markedly decreased.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The core biopsy is adequate for evaluation.
The findings in this biopsy are similar to those seen at first diagnosis of acute leukemia (see biopsy S11-25476M; [**2196-6-7**]).

Chimerism studies showed 50%/50% donor/host.
He underwent MEC reinduction d1 [**11-5**] with Hydroxyurea [**11-4**] and [**11-5**].
LDH elevation >4000 dropped markedly after MEC & pt tolerated MEC well, but initial post-treatment course was complicated by neutropenic fevers (see below).
Repeat BM bx on [**11-19**] (day 15) and [**12-7**] showed AML relapse again.
Blast count continued to rise to a maxium of 94% peripherally on [**2196-12-18**].
Micro (including line cultures) and pan-CT scans were negative for sources of infection until on [**11-16**] BCx grew GNR which speciated as Pseudomonas auruginosa initially pan-sensitive except to meropenem.
Soon thereafter, he developed PNA seen on chest imaging & BAL sputum Cx grew pseudomonas now with evolved resistances only sensitive to Cipro/Tobra/Gent.
Fevers persisted and blood cutlures from [**2196-12-18**] showed GNR bacteremia.
He also developed LLQ pain; a CT abd/pelvis obtained with concernf or tiflitis showed descending colitis.
TPN started [**11-13**].
Serial stool studies and CMV testing was negative.
At time of ICU transfer his urine output was wnl and he was mentating at baseline but he was having relative hypotension with BP ~15 pts below his baseline.
He was persistently febrile even after blood pressure stabilized.
There was initial question of whether the infection might have arisen from a R posterior molar, but OMFS evaluation including CT face and panorex showed that the infection did not involve bone.
Repeated CT scans showed soft tissue swelling, no collection or abscess to drain.
# PNEUMONIA In the ICU he developed a RUL seen on CXR which was treated as ventilator associated pneumonia.
Sputum culture from [**2196-12-1**] showed that pseudomonas had evolved resistance to zosyn, at which time he was switched to ciprofloxacin.
He continued to produce thick yellow-white sputum which was difficult to manage in combination with low-level bleeding from oral ulcer.
Repeat cultures from throat showed evolution of cipro resistance to the Cipro and colistin was started as above.
Became persistenly tachycardic with fevers and had two episodes of SVT >200 on [**12-18**] and [**12-18**] broken by carotid massage.
