Of note, pt also noted some chest pressure, which he described as musculoskeletal, associated w/ b/l rib pain approximately 1 week ago, which he attributed to muscle strain from moving x-mas trees (he owns a nursery).
Pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] ED where CT scan demonstrated ascites and pericardial effusion and pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
In our [**Name (NI) **], pt had HR 100, SBP 120-130, Pulses 30, distended neck veins.
Pericardiocentesis demonstrated equalization of pressures, w/ RA, RV, PCWP equal to 25, opening pressure 20.
1.1L of hemorrhagic fluid was drained and sent for studies, pericardial drain was left in place.
Post-procedure, RA pressure was 14, and pt had symptomatic relief.

Resting hemodynamics revealed equalization of mean RA, RV end-diastolic and mean PCW pressures at 25mmHg.
The arterial pressure tracings confirmed a 30mmHg difference in SBP with respiration.
Post intervention, the mean RA decreased to 14mmHg and the pericardial pressure to -10mmHg with inspiration.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
An alternative morphologic consideration includes Burkitt lymphoma, however the CD20 and CD10 negativity would argue against that.
