A CT on admission on [**9-8**] showed small bowel fluid-filled loops as well as a question of a splenic flexure obstruction.
A repeat CT at that time showed no significant change, however, the patient also had an episode of coffee-ground emesis and was placed on a nasogastric tube, and the Gastroenterology service was consulted.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to the Medicine service, the patient's temperature was 100.0 with a heart rate of 88, blood pressure of 122/70, respiratory rate of 18, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.
His head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Motor and sensory examinations were grossly intact.
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ and symmetric.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count on admission was 12.3, decreased to 7 by the date of transfer on [**9-8**], hematocrit 40.0, platelet count 152.
PT 17.9, INR 2.2.
Sodium 142, potassium 3.9, chloride 101, bicarbonate 25, BUN 29, creatinine 1.2, glucose 192.
Stool cultures and urine cultures were sent.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated small bowel dilatation with a large amount of intraluminal fluid, as well as persistent short segment of wall thickening of the transverse colon at the level of the splenic flexure, without significant inflammatory changes.
The patient was planned to undergo a barium enema on [**9-10**], however, further evaluation of the abdominal CT studies obtained on admission demonstrated a small, unable to further characterize, pancreatic mass in the tail of the pancreas adjacent to the area of colonic thickening, as well as a splenic infarct and absence of the splenic vein.
Given these findings, a dedicated pancreatic abdominal CT was obtained, which demonstrated a focal area of soft tissue density adjacent to the splenic flexure on the tail of the pancreas, which could be related to inflammatory process such as diverticulitis or focal pancreatitis.
The CT also demonstrated some improvement in the degree of small bowel dilatation, without obstruction of the splenic flexure, and non-visualization of the splenic vein, likely related to splenic vein thrombosis given the finding of a stable splenic infarct and perisplenic fluid.
A KUB demonstrated continued dilated small bowel loops, however, as the nasogastric tubes did not have significant output on wall suction, the nasogastric tube was discontinued on hospital day four.
As for the colonoscopy, the patient's colonoscopy was delayed on several occasions, initially due to an INR in the 2.5 range, which was thought secondary to malnutrition, as the patient's Coumadin had been held since the date of admission, and the patient was given oral vitamin K and one dose of 1 mg intravenously of vitamin K which decreased his INR to 1.5.
Examination revealed that the neurologic examination was fully intact, and the patient was actually oriented.
Blood gas at the time of the event was normal.
His blood sugar was normal level.
The esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed diffuse granularity, erythema and congestion of the mucosa, with no bleeding in the stomach, body and antrum, compatible with gastritis and nasogastric tube trauma, as well as a markedly angulated stomach, suggesting potential extrinsic compression.
The colonoscopy demonstrated an obstructing mass at the splenic flexure, through which the endoscope was not able to pass.
Cold-forceps biopsies were obtained and are pending at the time of this dictation.
The CEA was 1.5, however, the CA-19-9 was 4702, consistent with a pancreatic malignancy or a pancreatic benign adenoma.
His antidepressant medication was continued, and Social Work was consulted regarding helping with family coping.
His oxygen saturations dropped into the low 90s, and he showed some signs of upper airway wheezing.
His vital signs remained stable, oxygen saturation improved, and the wheezing decreased.
