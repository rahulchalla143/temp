His postoperative course was complicated by a bronchopleural fistula and Serratia VAP for which he took cipro x 14 days.
Both times, his vitals were stable and his CXR unchanged; he was thus sent home with regular follow up in clinic.
[**2100-12-26**], [**2100-12-27**], [**2100-12-28**], [**2101-1-19**]: Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration.

On [**2101-4-28**], head CT was obtained, showing marked predominantly vasogenic edema spread diffusely within both cerebral hemispheres, right cerebellum, and possibly within the brainstem with at least two focal hyperdense lesions noted within the left periventricular white matter and left basal ganglia.
CV: An Echo was done at admission which demonstrated normal systolic function.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without evidence of ischemic.
A CT chest was done which showed a moderate left pleural effusion.
Nutrition labs were obtained weekly.
Bronchoscopy showed thick secretion, which was cleaned out.
STAT head CT showed uncal herniation and cerebellar tonsil herniation.
