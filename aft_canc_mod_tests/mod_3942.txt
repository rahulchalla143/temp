Received IVF through peripheral IV, and repeat lactate was 2.4.
BP remained normal.
CT of the abdomen and he was admitted to OMED for further observation.

Since then his course has been complicated by a steadily declining hematocrit (33 to 25 over the admission), worsening thrombocytopenia, and a new coagulopathy (INR up to 5.4).
On [**10-12**], he was noted to be hypoxemic and had chest x-ray showing only a distended stomach and a CTA with no PE (but also a distended stomach and known liver mets).
ABG was 7.44/25/63 then 7.32/21/84 that afternoon.
His oxygen requirement waxed and waned, from mid 80's on room air to mid 90's on room air.
His hypoxemia persisted and the patient became increasingly tired, confused, and tachypneic.
A repeat ABG was 7.3/19/75 but his lactate had climbed from 3.5 to 8.0.
CT abdomen showed SBO with no obvious cut off for obstruction a NGT placed and medical management recommeneded by surgery.
For his confusion a CT of his head was performed which was negative for bleed or other change.
The CT of abdomen on admission did not show any inflammatory processes in the abdomen.
The patient was given supportive care with IVF and Lomotil once obtained stool samples for cultures which were negative and his diarrhea improved with lomotil.
However, patient became acidotic and CT abdomen was repeated and revealed SBO.
After several bloody stools and rectal tube placement his bloody bowel movements slowed, his coags improved and his hematocrit was stable.
By tranfer from the ICU his HCT and INR was stable but platelets were 34.
He because hypoxic and acidotic and a CT chest was otained which revealed likely aspiration/pneumonia.
ABG was obtained and the patient appropriately compensated with decreased CO2 (25) with normal pH 7.4-7.44.
It was decided that no further blood products would be given.
