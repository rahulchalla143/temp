THIS IS A DIGITAL EEG MONITORING WITH EKG AND VIDEO [**12-5**] - [**2192-12-6**].
REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] L. [**Doctor Last Name **]   FINDINGS: ROUTINE SAMPLINGS: Showed a general suppression of the background with bursts of either generalized or left or right activity seen with a frequency of between 8 and 12 seconds.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
The background activity was suggestive of a burst-suppression pattern and occasional sharp and slow wave complexes were seen in the left frontal region.
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color son[**Name (NI) 493**] imaging of the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, basilic, and brachial veins was performed.
If there is clinical concern for an SVC syndrome, further evaluation with MRV could be considered.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 81932**] at 2:30 p.m. on [**2192-12-7**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color son[**Name (NI) 493**] imaging of the bilateral common femoral, femoral, popliteal and calf veins was performed.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-14**], the tip of the endotracheal tube now measures approximately 6.7 cm.
His exam was followed closely and on [**2192-12-2**] he had a CTA/CTP which did not demonstrate any vasospsm.
[**2192-12-4**] pt underwent cerebral angiogram which demonstrated mild vasospasm.
A bolt was placed to confirm ICP's on [**2192-12-7**].
His exam has remained unchanged till this point.
His blood cultures grew out gram negative rods and he was started on zosyn for this.
CTA on the 25th of Janueary did not demonstrate any vasopsasm.
