TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were obtained through the brain without and with intravenous gadolinium at [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2131-5-14**] at approximately 18:16 p.m.
MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Centered within the right cerebellum is a predominantly cystic 35 x 38 mm lesion with well-defined borders and a 8 x 20 mm enhancing mural component.
Mild dilatation is noted involving the third and lateral ventricular system with slightly increased FLAIR hyperintensity adjacent to the ventricular horns, which may relate to chronic small vessel disease or acute transependymal flow of CSF.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

TECHNIQUE: Multiple MDCT axial images were obtained from the base of the neck to the proximal thighs after the uneventful intravenous administration of 120 cc of Optiray.
Enteric contrast was not administered.
FINDINGS:  CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a central catheter with its tip in the right atrium.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Innumerable hypodensities are seen throughout the liver measuring to slightly 4.4 cm in diameter.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Usually these are simple cysts but given this clinical context recommend evaluation at the time of abdominal MR.  4.
No suspicious osteolytic or osteoblastic lesion although, with the sclerotic focus seen in the right iliac, bone scan is recommended for further evaluation.
Consider non-contrast CT  COMMENT: These results were posted to the ED dashboard at the time of interpretation, 20 minutes after scanning    The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT  In the interval, the patient has underwent a right-sided suboccipital craniectomy with removal of the previously described predominantly cystic right cerebellar mass in this patient with known non-small cell lung cancer.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the right-sided central venous access line is unchanged.
COMPARISON: [**2131-5-18**], 10:06 a.m.  AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: No evidence of NG tube seen in the intrathoracic portion of the esophagus.
The right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen with the tip in the mid-to-low SVC, unchanged in position.
The cardiomediastinal, hilar contour and pulmonary vasculature are unchanged and within normal limits.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial, FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 axial and MP-RAGE sagittal images acquired following gadolinium.
Comparison was made with the previous MRI of [**2131-5-14**] and CT examinations of [**2131-5-16**] and [**2131-5-17**].
Minimal enhancement is seen in the medial aspect of the surgical bed, which is not explained by pre-gadolinium blood products.
In correlation with the CT examinations, particularly that of [**2131-5-16**] it appears that the ventricular drain initially coursed down the right periventricular region through the basal ganglia and this could represent edema from that drain placement.
New signal change in the right basal ganglia could be explained from placement of the ventricular drain as this area was traversed by the drain on the CT of [**2131-5-16**].
