His hospital course was complicated by a code STEMI which was due to a moderate size pericardial effusion requiring a brief stay in the CCU.
He presented to an OSH ([**Hospital3 417**]) where a CXR demonstrated a new pleural effusion.
Labs sig for WBC of 48.3 (43.1 on discharge on [**12-25**]), Hct of 22.5, lactate of 2.6, INR of 1.4.
Bedside TTE done by ED showed moderate sized pericardial effusion with no evidence of tamponade physiology.
HR 116 BP 92/60 RR 25  92% on 4 L NC GEN: cachectic male, appears exhausted, pale HEENT: neck supple, MM tachy and dry.
NECK: JVD ~10 cm at 45' angle.
Pertinent Results: STUDIES: EKG: SR, 98 BPM, normal axis, normal intervals, TWF in III, AVF, AVL, V5, V6  EKG [**1-7**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
EKG [**1-16**]: Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats and ventricular premature beat.
Imaging: CXR - [**2193-1-1**] - Large R sided pleural effusion, appear slightly worsened compared to [**2192-12-22**] CXR.
CXR [**1-16**]: 1.
[**2192-12-18**] CT ABD W CONTRAST: 1.
TTE ([**2191-12-23**]): Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function  TTE ([**2192-1-4**]) Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
IMPRESSION: findings are consistent with early cardiac tamponade  CT ([**2192-1-3**]) FINDINGS: The aorta opacifies normally without evidence of dissection.
Although the study was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, numerous low-density lesions within the liver have increased in size, most consistent with worsening hepatic metastases.
Findings are better characterized on prior CT abdomen dated [**2192-12-18**].

Thus, he and his HCP decided that a long term care facility with hospice care was in his best interest, with goals of care focused on comfort.
Hemodynamically stable for approximately 10 days prior to death with no known episodes of atrial fibrillation, although blood pressures consistently low with SBP's in the 80s-90's and DBP's in the 40-60's.
EKG unremarkable, troponin negative x3.
