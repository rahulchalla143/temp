small SDH along anterior falx  CT C spine [**11-16**]  no acute fracture or malalignment  CT Head [**11-16**] Interval increase in size and extent of the right parietal extra-axial collection, in a configuration concerning for epidural (or combined epidural and subdural) hematoma.
CT Head [**11-17**] Overall stable appearance of right parietal collection, concerning for epidural or combined epidural/subdural hematoma with possible foci of subarachnoid extension.
CT Head [**11-18**] No significant short-interval changes.
No developing hydrocephalus  CT Head [**11-19**] Stable right extra-axial hemorrhage, with little change since the prior study.
MRI brain [**2130-11-20**] 1.
Subarachnoid blood products in the right frontal and parietal sulci are more extensive on MRI than they have been on prior CT with edema involving the adjacent gyri.
Overall, the ventricular size has not changed dramatically since the prior study of four days earlier, and there is no new hydrocephalus.
EEG [**11-21**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to the presence of mild generalized background slowing and focal attenuation over the right fronto-central region.
brain infarction, MRI is more sensitive for detection of this pathological process.
ADDENDUM AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is somewhat less distinct grey-white matter differentiation in the right cerebral hemisphere, compared to the prior CT study, which could indicate persistent, subarchnoid blood products (seen on the prior MR study), and possibly an admixture of minimal brain edema.
[**Date range (1) 41989**] EEG: Negative for seizures  CXR [**2130-11-26**] As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the endotracheal tube is just 1.5 cm away from the carina.
No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia  CXR [**2130-11-28**] Mild atelectasis persists at both lung bases.
She was given 1 unit of platelets for her thrombocytopenia and repeat laboratory studies showed increase in platelet count to 82,000 consistent with goal platelet count greater than 80,000.
Her cervical collar was removed on [**11-16**] when CT C spine showed no fracture or malalignment and she had no c spine tenderness to palpation.
A repeat CT head on the morning of [**11-16**] showed slight increase in size of right sided subdural hematoma and she remained in the ICU for further care including q1 neurochecks.
Repeat head CT done at 1am showed redistribution of blood.
Her platelet count was stable at 89.
A repeat head CT at 1pm was stable.
An CT, MRI and EEG were ordered to further investigate.
On [**11-19**], she was aphasic, MRI showed no major infarcts and her CT was stable with no changes.
EEG showed continuous seizure activity so the patient was transferred to the surgical ICU and was intubated and sedated.
On [**11-20**] EEG showed no seizure activity.
Her WBC count elevated to 11 and blood cultures were sent.
Urine cultures were pending.
On [**11-23**] patient's exam improved and patient was extubated but failed and was re intubated due to stridor.
She remained stable overnight but upon exam [**11-24**] AM she was noted to be more lethargic and not moving her right UE.
A head CT was done which was stable therefore EEG monitoring was requested.
On [**2132-11-25**] her exam improved and the ICU began weaning down her vent settings and she was extubated on [**11-26**], but was unable to maintain her airway and was re intubated.
On [**11-26**] her 48hr EEG was negative for seizure activity.
She had her trach and PEG placed in the ICU on [**11-28**].
On [**11-29**] she required 1 unit of PRBC for Hct of 24.
She was on Zosyn and Cipro for a sputum culture with gram negative rods.
Post transfusion hct was 29.2.
On [**12-1**], patient was stable, exam unchanged.
On [**2130-12-3**] exam continued to be stable.
Dilantin level corrected to 12 from 7.5 in the setting of low albumin level of 2.6.
She failed her PMV eval with speach and swallow.
Her final sputum culture from [**11-27**] was negative.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to your appointment.
