A post-thoracentesis CXR revealed a small apical pneumothorax.
The patient was called and told to return to the ED for possible chest tube, but thoracics deemed that the PTX was not large enough to need a chest tube.
Instead, the plan was to keep the patient on non-rebreather overnight to aid in PTX reabsorption and to check serial CXRs.
His Onc hx: -- In [**2200-7-11**] his CBC revealed a new anemia (hgb 10.9) and thrombocytopenia (35).
He was sent in to ER by PMD for critical platelets 11 and Hgb 7.0.
-- [**2200-10-6**] Discharged; Hospitalization included BMBx, treatment for CAP for leukocytocysis, cough and CXR with atelectasis vs PNA and tamsulosin started for urinary retention.
A CXR was done that showed a slightly smaller apical PTX.
