She has been afebrile with O2 saturations ranging from 89% to 95% on her usual home O2 requirement of 3 liters.
Today, the patient was noted to be very lethargic and weak, saturating from 79% to 84% on 3 liters.
She was transferred to [**Doctor First Name **] to the Emergency Room, the patient was noted to be in respiratory failure with an arterial blood gas of 7.14/143/81.
Unfortunately, the patient's arterial blood gas did not respond well to the treatment and the BIPAP remained at 7.17/128/86.
She arrived in the MICU with an O2 saturation of 90% on 100% nonrebreather.
Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction 8.
History of lung carcinoma, possibly no diagnostic biopsies or cytology 9.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory  PHYSICAL EXAM: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96?????
?, blood pressure 177/71, pulse 83, respirations 26, O2 saturations 92% on 100% nonrebreather.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  The patient has cataracts bilaterally.
Oropharynx exam is notable for thrush.
NECK:  Supple with a JVP of 8 cm.
The patient's motor exam was nonfocal.
An electrocardiogram was obtained in the Emergency Room which showed elevated T-waves in the V2 to V4 leads consistent with prior electrocardiograms and no acute ST or T-wave changes.
A chest x-ray showed progression of right middle lobe and right lower lobe opacification with obscuration of the right heart border and right diaphragm, likely right effusion compared with the previous film from [**2155-4-29**].
Cultures were sent and were negative at time of discharge.
The patient's O2 was weaned with a goal O2 in the mid 80s and low 90s.
On the floor, antibiotics were continued, as well as the Solu-Medrol.
The patient required less and less oxygen and at time of discharge was requiring only 3 to 4 liters by face mask with an O2 saturation in the low 90s.
Her lung exam at the time of discharge is still extremely junky and the patient's bicarbonate at the time of discharge is still elevated at 35.
It is likely that the patient still has a respiratory acidosis secondary to CO2 retention and a compensating metabolic alkalosis, but an arterial blood gas was not indicated at this time, as the patient had been symptomatically improving.
