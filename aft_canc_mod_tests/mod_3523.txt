Patient found to be somnolent with ABG 7.28/78/86.
Patient admitted to ICU on 2L NC for further management.

[**2118-6-29**] Urine culture negative.
[**2123-1-29**] Blood culture with no growth to date.
CXR [**2123-1-29**]: Atelectasis and moderate sized pleural effusion seen in the area of the known right middle lobe mass.
CTA [**2123-1-29**]: Again noted is an obstructing mass in the right middle lobe with a similar appearance.
Again noted are multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes, which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
[**2123-2-1**] Echocardiography: Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is normal in size.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of  [**2122-10-5**], the degree of pulmonary hypertension detected has increased.
[**2123-2-1**] Chest X-ray:  AP chest compared to [**1-29**] and [**1-5**]: Small right pleural effusion has increased since [**1-29**] collecting along the diaphragmatic and lower costal surface of the right lung adjacent to consolidation surrounding a right middle lobe mass demonstrated on plain chest films from [**1-5**].

Patient noted to be somnolent with ABG 7.28/78/86.
Upon admission to [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit ([**Hospital Unit Name 153**]) he was saturation 2L NC.
CXR notable for new R pleural effusion as well as for previously seen RML mass.
A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed diastolic congestive heart failure.
Amt of fluid was found by ultrasound to be too small for thoracentesis and prior bronchoscopy revealed no evidence he would benefit from stenting.
- Pt to continue home oxygen - Pt to continue albuterol/atrovent nebulizers - only 1 day of prednisone post discharge for possible COPD exacerbation.
- continue Levofloxacin for empiric treatment of PNA for two days, pneumonia appears less likely given hosp course and lack of CXR changes - Supplemental O2 to keep O2 sats >93% - Per IP no indication for stenting, R pleural effusion to small for thoracentesis.
Lung Cancer - scheduled for Cyberknife on [**2123-2-5**] - to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5565**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Oncology, may undergo chemotherapy if radiation therapy tolerated.
B) Pump -Diastolic CHF, impaired relaxation seen on echo -Pt to continue Lasix -volume status appeared euvolemic by discharge and creatinine normalized by discharge C) Rhythm Atrial Fibrillation- Patient rate controlled with diltiazem, initially was a. fib.
Creatinine at 1.2, likely renal insufficiency was in part secondary to heart failure.
Breathing back to baseline status with oxygen saturation in 95-97 range on 2L nasal cannula.
