History of Present Illness: Time Code Stroke called: 12:43pm (24h clock) Time Neurology at bedside for evaluation: 12:49 pm (24h clock) Time (and date) the patient was last known well: 12:30 pm NIH Stroke Scale Score: 8 t-[**MD Number(3) 6360**]:  NO, chronic thrombocytopenia given lymphoma with platelets of 60 today  Reason for Consult: Called by Emergency Department to evaluate CODE STROKE  Please see stroke fellow note for full details.
Initially taken to head CT that did not show early evidence of stroke.
Labs revealed platelets of 60 and tPA contraindicated.
Following the MRI which showed right thalamic stroke, heparin started and placed in IVF with goal BP ~160.
NIH Stroke Scale score was 8 1a.
Sensory: 2 9.
Language: 0 10.
Dysarthria: 0 11.
MVA in [**7-/2117**] with extensive injuries including C2 fracture.
Follow up PET scan in [**12/2117**] showed worsening adenopathy with biopsy consistent with her known lymphoma.
Her chemotherapy and posttransplant course were complicated byproctitis and rectal pain which resolved with recovery of her counts.
Restaging CT scan on [**2118-11-1**] showed a new single 21.7 mm focus of prevascular adenopathy.
She underwent CT guided LN biopsy on [**2118-11-23**] which unfortunately showed recurrence of her B-cell lymphoma with aggressive features.
Follow up PET/CT scan on [**2118-12-7**] showed further progression of her disease with new markedly FDG avid anterior mediastinal nodal mass compared to previous PET-CT. New mediastinal (including anterior, precarinal and subcarinal), right hilar, retrocrural, retroperitoneal and right iliac FDG avid lymphadenopathy.
Following 2 cycles of therapy, repeat PET scan on [**2119-1-30**] showed a 44.6% decrease in lymph nodes which is considered stable disease.
She received 3 and [**11-19**] cycles of therapy with noted disease progression on CT scan and PET scan.
Readmitted on [**2119-4-24**] with cough, weakness, electrolyte abnormalities and noted C. diff infection, now on oral vancomycin.
Follow up CT scan showed a mixed response, with interval decrease of mediastinal lymphadenopathy but increased of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 103705**] underwent a repeat CT torso on [**2119-5-17**], which demonstrated further progression of her disease, with enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Her counts remained low and she underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2119-5-18**] which showed no evidence for lymphoma.
CHF, most recent EF >55% on [**2119-1-26**].
Palindromic Rheumatism 9.
Pancreatitis [**12-20**] Imuran 10.
MVA, [**7-/2117**] with bilateral C2 vertebral foramen fracture/C2 body fracture, manubrium fracture, right rib fractures of ribs six through eight, left distal radial/ulnar styloid fracture.
JVP wnl LN: No cervical, SC LAD LUNGS: decreased BS at bases b/l HEART: Irregularly irregular rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops ABDOMEN: Soft, nondistended, normal bowel sounds, diffuse TTP throughout.
ON DISCHARGE: Exam unchanged except the neuro-exam: Alert and oriented to person, place, time.
CN 2 -12 intact.

Initial CT head in ED [**7-10**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process; please note MRI is more sensitive for the detection of acute stroke.
Initial MRI [**7-10**]: 1.
There is no change from prior exam two days ago.
Initial exam significant for Foix's triad of left homonymous hemianopia, left hemianesthesia (all modalities) and left hemiplegia.
On the morning of [**7-11**] anisocoria was more evident (for unclear reasons left pupil was larger) and sensory loss was denser with loss of light touch and no response to painful stimulation (either reflexive or cortical).
Repeat NCHCT revealed some hemorrhagic conversion consistent with leakage rather than frank hemorrhage given low Houndsfield units.
Heparin was stopped and blood pressure parameters changed from maintain hypertension to maintain high normal pressure and sitting the patient up.
On [**7-13**], neurologic exam was further improved with purposive use of left hand and more attentiveness to her left side.
Patient was transferred to the [**Month/Year (2) 3242**] service for further management, specifically, to monitor while counts nadired given recent [**Hospital1 **].
Upon discharge, her neuro exam was much improved, only remarkable for right visual field cut.
