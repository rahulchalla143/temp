History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 58yo [**Known lastname 8230**]-speaking M with a PMH of stage IIIc esophageal CA on warfarin for Hx of PEs who presents after an outpatient EGD done today because of inability to swallow secretions and concern of progressive disease after XRT and 4 cycles of cisplatin/5-FU.
EGD revealed an area of friable and necrotic tissue, concerning for residual disease and a biopsy was taken.
Labs were found to be significant for INR 4.5.
On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], VS: Hr 84, BP 115/42, RR 21, 92% RA.
- [**2169-1-10**] EGD done with pathology showing SCC, also revealing esophageo-pulmonary fistula.
- PET CT without evidence of mets, underwent [**Month/Day/Year 74384**] treatment, planned for 28 days, 2050 grays total.
No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema  Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS: [**2169-6-16**] 02:00PM BLOOD WBC-9.3 RBC-3.33* Hgb-10.3* Hct-31.8* MCV-96 MCH-31.0 MCHC-32.5 RDW-16.1* Plt Ct-286 [**2169-6-23**] 07:15AM BLOOD Neuts-74.7* Lymphs-12.2* Monos-9.2 Eos-3.6 Baso-0.4 [**2169-6-16**] 12:05PM BLOOD PT-46.0* INR(PT)-4.5* [**2169-6-16**] 02:00PM BLOOD UreaN-32* Creat-0.7 Na-144 K-4.0 Cl-105 HCO3-30 AnGap-13 [**2169-6-16**] 02:00PM BLOOD ALT-41* AST-43* AlkPhos-148* Amylase-152* TotBili-0.3 DirBili-0.1 IndBili-0.2 [**2169-6-18**] 08:52AM BLOOD Calcium-8.6 Phos-2.4*# Mg-1.7 .
Cold forceps biopsies were performed from the friable tissue at the distal end of the stent for pathology.
[**2169-6-16**] BIOPSY OF ESOPHAGEAL MASS: Active esophagitis with ulceration; stain for fungi will be sent as an addendum; multiple levels taken (see note).
Some blood clots were also seen.
The blood clots were fragmented with combination of snare and spiral basket.
An Argon-Plasma Coagulator was applied for the tumor tissue destruction with majority of tissue within the stent successfully coagulated.
DISCHARGE LABS:  Brief Hospital Course: 58yoM with Stage III esophageal CA and PEs on warfarin s/p EGD and Bx of mass [**2169-6-16**] in the setting of supratherapeutic INR who was admitted to the ICU for observation after he vomitted 75cc of BRB post-procedure.
Had 2 PIVs placed and received  IVFs in GI suite.He was given 3 additional units of FFP on [**6-18**], prior to repeat EGD adn again 2 units of FFP prior to EGD on [**2169-6-23**].
he had no recurrent episodes of hematemesis or melena.H/H remained overall stable .Given evidence of esophagitis on biopsy of esophagus , pt was  started on IV protonix [**Hospital1 **] .
# Hx of PEs: Multiple PEs seen on CTs in [**2169-1-25**].
# Esophageal CA: Pt underwent an EGD on [**6-16**] because of inability to swallow his saliva or  liquids.
EGD showed evidence of a mass causing near complete obstruction.
Repeat EGD done on [**2169-6-18**] and mass in the stent was coagulated.
Pt underwent a third EGD on [**2169-6-23**] and a new stent was placed to cover the TE fistula and new biopsies obtained.
# PNA /TE fistula: Pt with cough after drinking post EGD on [**2169-6-18**].Barium esophogram shows evidence of TE fistula.
CXR on [**2169-6-22**] showed evidence a new lll infiltrate and pt started on cefepime/vancomycin and flagyl.
The endoscopy was done because of diffulty swallowing and showed an obstructuion of your esophagus.
A barium esophogram showed a possible connection (fistula) between the trachea (airway) and your esophagus.
You had two repeat endoscopies in which biopsies were taken and a new stent was placed.
