Surgery service requested an echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 25%, normal left ventricular wall thickness and severe regional wall motion abnormalities; akinesis of the inferior septal wall; hypokinesis of the septal wall.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was afebrile; heart rate of 102 and irregular; blood pressure 104/76; respiratory rate of 18; 99% on room air.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT: Extraocular movements intact.
Midline incision was [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain, clean, dry and intact.
1 to 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count was 14.3; hematocrit of 32.9; potassium of 3.2; BUN 42; creatinine 1.4; magnesium 1.6.
Electrocardiogram showed left bundle branch morphology and irregularly irregular rhythm.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient had an echocardiogram on [**2198-11-14**] which showed a moderately dilated left atrium.
The patient was then taken for a cardiac catheterization on [**2198-11-16**] where he was found to have a diffuse 30% stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery, 30% stenosis at the mid right coronary artery and 60% stenosis at the distal right coronary artery.
Subsequent electrocardiograms throughout his hospitalization showed no changes compared to previous electrocardiograms.
At that time, he had a CT scan and MR which were both negative for acute bleed.
However, the MR was poor study because of his movement.
He was also seen in consultation by the neurology service and an EEG was obtained which showed diffuse encephalopathy but no focal seizure activity.
He also had a chest x-ray which showed a right lower lobe infiltrate, believed to be an aspiration pneumonia.
He did have his TSH checked during this hospitalization.
