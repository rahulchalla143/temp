His systolic blood pressures at home had been running in the 70s to 90s.
Relative hypotension (70s to 90s systolic blood pressure for several years) 2.
Potassium chloride 10 milliequivalents qd 3.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.3?????
?, heart rate 106, blood pressure 100/60, respiratory rate 18, 94% on room air.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY STUDIES:  White blood cell count 8.8, hematocrit 34, platelets 149.
Glucose 85, BUN 27, creatinine 9.1.
Sodium 140, potassium 4.3, chloride 101.
ALT 28, AST 29, LD1 56, alkaline phosphatase 39, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 3.4, calcium 9.3, phosphate 6.5, magnesium 1.7.
IMAGING STUDIES:  Chest x-ray obtained on [**2109-8-6**] showed a left IJ Swan-Ganz catheter with the tip in the distal right pulmonary artery.
The chest x-ray also showed satisfactory position of the endotracheal tube and the right IJ central line.
Chest x-ray obtained on [**2109-8-7**] showed continued widened mediastinum, bilateral atelectasis.
Chest x-ray from [**2109-8-9**] showed stable mild congestive heart failure.
Chest x-ray obtained on [**2109-8-14**] showed cardiac enlargement with evidence of mild congestive heart failure.
The exam also showed patchy atelectasis at the right lower lobe, but no evidence of pneumothorax.
Chest x-ray obtained on [**2109-8-15**] showed small right sided pleural effusion, as well as cardiomegaly with mild congestive heart failure.
Ultrasound of the bladder obtained on [**2109-8-17**] showed multiple clots within the bladder.
The renal transplant ultrasound obtained on [**2109-8-20**] showed mild hydronephrosis of the transplanted kidney, echogenic material in the collecting system of transplanted kidney which was thought to be consistent with blood clot, as well as mild elevation of the resistive index.
Blood loss was 100 cc.
In addition, the patient was noted to have poor urine output which was thought to be secondary to ischemic damage plus the hypotension.
