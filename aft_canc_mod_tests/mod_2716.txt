He was taken by ambulance to [**Hospital6 **], where head CT demonstrated a 6cm L parieto-occipital hematoma.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation, where he says he has felt "foggy."
In [**2-/2113**], he underwent biopsy of a right clavicular lesion by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] revealing a 0.45 mm thick, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level III melanoma.
In [**2115-6-4**], he underwent biopsy of a new right chest wall skin lesion by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] revealing metastatic melanoma not seen at the margin without an epidermal component and two mitoses per mm2.
Staging scans were negative and he began GM-CSF off protocol on [**2115-9-4**], completing 13 cycles in [**2116-8-4**].
Torso CT in [**9-11**] revealed new small bilateral pulmonary nodules and an abnormal right kidney.
CT guided biopsy of the right kidney on [**2116-10-27**] confirmed metastatic melanoma.

Comparison was also made with the CT examination of [**2117-5-6**].
Large intra-axial hematoma in the left parietal lobe with blood products suggestive of hyperacute/acute hematoma.
MRA HEAD:  Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation without stenosis, occlusion, or an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: A 6.2 x 3.7 cm left parietal hemorrhage with peripheral zone of edema appears similar in configuration as compared to [**2117-8-27**].
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
He was taken by ambulance to [**Hospital6 **], where head CT demonstrated a 6cm L parieto-occipital hematoma.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
MRI showed underlying contrast enhancing nodular areas that were highly concerning for underlying malignancy, especially given his metastatic melanoma.
