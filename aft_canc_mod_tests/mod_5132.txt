ECG ([**10-14**]): Sinus tachycardia.
CXR ([**10-14**]): No evidence of focal consolidation.
AXR ([**10-15**]): Limited examination.
AXR ([**10-28**]): Unremarkable bowel gas pattern.
CT-abd/pelvis ([**10-15**]): 1.Pancolitis.
Echocardiogram ([**10-19**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-5-26**], the findings are similar.
Pulmonary artery systoic pressure could not be estimated on the current study.
EEG ([**10-21**]): This is an abnormal portable EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to high voltage multifocal sharp waves arising broadly over the left hemisphere, but most notably over the left anterior quadrant.
EEG ([**10-29**]): This is an abnormal portable EEG due to high voltage multifocal sharp wave discharges arising broadly over the left hemisphere, suggestive of ongoing cortical irritability with potential for epileptogenesis.
In the ED, patient was febrile to 103F, tachycardic, tachypneic, satting 97%on 4l and initially hypertensive but bp then dropped to 100's systolic.
EKG - < 1mm ST depressions in V4-V6.
CXR - no acute process.
SBP was responsive to fluid bolus, c/w with presumed prerenal/hypovolemia status.
Upon discharge from the ICU, her metoprolol was resumed at a lower dose, with good control of her blood pressures.
On admission,CT abdomen showed thickened colonic mucosa c/w colitis.
VRE bacteremia: Blood cultures drawn in ED were positive for Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (1/2 bottles, [**1-10**] sets).
Culture was sensitive to daptomycin and patient completed a 12 day course on [**2158-10-28**].
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**]: Pt was diagnosed with PCP pneumonia based on bronchoalveolar lavage results from the flexible bronchoscopy done on [**2158-10-24**].
It was decided that the platelet transfusion threshold should be 30 given that her last intra-cranial hemorrhage was over 6 months prior.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1.
You were first admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for stabilization due to low blood pressures, and you were transferred out to the Bone Marrow Transplant unit once your pressures were stabilized.
An abdominal CT showed findings consistent with colitis, and your stools were positive for C.diff, so you were started on oral Vancomycin for treatment, with a plan to continue this medication for at least 6 months after discharge.
Blood cultures drawn in the emergency room also grew Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus, so you were started on a 12-day course of Daptomycin, which you completed on [**2158-10-28**].
Bronchoalveloar Lavage was done on [**2158-10-24**], which showed evidence of Pneumocystis pneumonia, so you were started on treatment with Bactrim.
This was changed to Atovaquone when it was noted that your liver function tests were increasing while on the Bactrim.
An EEG was done which showed continued sharp spikes, consistent with an encephalopathy, and the neuro-oncologists believed that you had continued underlying seizures, so you were started on Lamictal with a plan to uptitrate this dose.
