The plan was for CT of the pelvis and possible surgery.
He refused both the surgery as well as the CT scan and was admitted to medicine for clearance.
Of note, he was also found to be hyperkalemic with a K of 6.2.
He was given kayexalate and repeat K 5.3.
Calcium on admission was 12.7 - per OMR this is chronic hypercalcemia [**3-16**] hyperparathyroidism.
Review of systems was negative for fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss - in fact patient had 70lb wt gain over 2 years - chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations.
# CHF- EF 20% pre-CABG, no recent ECHO on file # chronic knee pain # CKD- Cr 2.4; suspected secondary to hypercalcemia, DM # PAF   Social History: The patient has a 15 pack year history.
Physical Exam: vitals- T 96.4, BP 130/68, HR 96, RR 20, 99% RA gen- disheveled appearing, no acute distress heent- EOMI.

EKG: afib w/ ventricular rate 110's .
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20 percent) secondary to akinesis of the inferior wall and at least moderate hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
[**2181-5-10**] CT Pelvis:IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2181-5-10**] CT Femur: 1.
Redemonstration of pathologic fracture of the left femoral neck, as discussed on the CT of the pelvis.
[**2181-5-13**] Renal US: IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the kidneys secondary to patient's increased body habitus and inability to comply with necessary maneuvers.
LENIs [**8-2**]: Both grayscale and color Doppler ultrasound examination of the left lower extremity was performed.
On admission he was noted to be hypercalcemic (12.7) and parathyroid hormone was 1600.
A repeat thyroid US showed increased size of the adenoma: 3.9x3.8x3.2cm nodule post/lat to inferior pole L thyroid lobe and 1.4x0.8x0.9cm nodule adjacent to lower pole of L thyroid lobe.
Radiologic studies showed lytic lesions which are consistent with Brown's tumors.
The pt underwent FNA of the R thyroid mass which was intermediate for papillary Ca thyroid.
# Hypthyroidism: The patient was found to have hypothyroidism during his hospital stay with TSH 6.6,Free T4 1.1.
# Pathologic pelvic fx/leg fracture: Once admitted to the floor and the patient's pain was appropriately managed, a CT pelvis was obtained which revealed left femoral neck fracture and soft tissue density mass within the mid femoral diaphysis.
Skeletal survey showed multiple lytic lesions in femurs, pelvis, and humeri and pathologic subacute humerus fracture.
SPEP and UPEP were done and both were negative.
EKG was done with epigastric pain and was unchanged.
If the pt needs to undergo repeat thyroid resection, may need to consult cards again.
This admission he has had multiple episodes of RVR with ventricular rate in 140s.
His CCB was held and BB reduced with return of his RVR and therefore he was loaded with digoxin with good response.
His FSG were normal, and the glargine and subsequently the HISS were stopped.
# Systolic CHF, decompensated: Initial physical exam revealed 4+ pitting edema in legs bilaterally.
Known to have EF 20%.
Repeat echocardiogram confirmed this ejection fraction as well as moderate TR and moderate MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] presented with a weight of 150kg.
A renal US was done which showed no evidence of nephrolithiasis or hydronephrosis.
Vit B12 was within normal limits.
Hct has been stable (range 26-28).
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
