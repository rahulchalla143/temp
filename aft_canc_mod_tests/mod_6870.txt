Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS: T:97.6 BP:141/85 HR:105 R 16 O2Sats 98% GENERAL: Drowsy male, wd/wn, nad.
Pulls foot away repetitively on exam of left.
Pertinent Results: MRI [**2198-3-29**] 1.
CT HEAD [**2198-3-22**] 1.
New area of air is identified in the inferior left frontal lobe which is new which is better visualized on the current study and could be secondary to intervention.
Otherwise unchanged study with mass effect in the basal cisterns and the ventricles unchanged.
CT HEAD [**2198-3-20**] Two new foci of acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the rt.
Other findings unchanged compared to the most recent CT as described above with subfalcine and uncal herniation.
LENI [**2198-3-19**] 1.
CT HEAD [**2198-3-18**] 1.
Low attenuating subacute to chronic right subdural hematoma does appear to have increased in size from prior exam as described above resulting in increased mass effect on the right and new marked worsening of leftward subfalcine herniation.
EEG [**2198-3-13**] This is an abnormal portable EEG recording due to the right anterior temporal sharp waves, the right anterior temporal and frontal slowing, and the left hemisphere lower voltage and less well sustained posterior region.
EEG [**2198-3-5**] This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling showed a moderately slow background throughout, consistent with an encephalopathy.
ECG [**2198-3-4**]  Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2198-3-1**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
HEAD CT WITH CONTRAST [**2198-3-3**] 1.
HEAD MRI [**2198-3-3**] 1) Status post resection of a frontal lobe mass.
CHEST (PA & LAT) [**2198-3-19**] Normal chest radiograph.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2198-3-18**] 1.
Low attenuating subacute to chronic right subdural hematoma does appear to have increased in size from prior exam as described above resulting in increased mass effect on the right and new marked worsening of leftward subfalcine herniation.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2198-3-7**] 1.
Evaluation for residual tumor is limited on the noncontrast CT, but better evaluated on the MR of [**2198-3-3**].
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2198-3-7**] 8:48 AM 1.
Evaluation for residual tumor is limited on the noncontrast CT, but better evaluated on the MR of [**2198-3-3**].
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2198-3-3**] Status post resection of a frontal lobe mass.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2198-3-2**] Status post left frontotemporal craniectomy with expected post-surgical change.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2198-3-1**] Large ill-defined low attenuation mass centered in the left frontotemporal lobe with resulting rightward shift of midline structures, entrapment of the right lateral ventricle and obliteration of the suprasellar cistern suggestive of downward herniation.
MIB-1- elevated, proliferation index estimated 10?????
highlights blood vessels, tumor is reticulin poor.
Final Cultures from pseudomeningocele [**2198-3-30**]:                             **FINAL REPORT [**2198-4-2**]**    GRAM STAIN (Final [**2198-3-30**]):       4+   (>10 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2198-4-2**]):       ENTEROCOCCUS SP..
CXR, UA and LENIs on [**2198-3-19**] were all negative.
A head wrap was placed and no further action was taken at this time.
An MRI done on [**2198-3-29**] showed an enlarged left frontotemporoparietal scalp subgaleal hemorrhagic collection.
The gram stain showed 2+ gram positive cocci.
Due to this infection, chemotherapy was not an option due to risk of overwhelming infection and likely death after chemotherapy.
