Viral screen ([**2105-2-15**]): positive for influenza A by DFA  Brief Hospital Course: Upon his initial arrival to the floor, he became tachypnic to the 30's and 40's with increasing dyspnea, spiked a fever to 103.0 and had an increasing oxygen requirement.
He was given several courses of albuterol nebs which resulted in temporary improvement of symptoms, but serial ABGs revealed worsening alkalosis.
He was on 2L nc at that time, and was satting 95-96% on room air by the following morning.
Initially, O2sat 85% on 2L, 87% on 5L, not much improved on face mask, and low 90s on NRB.
Bronchoscopy and BAL were performed and were positive for influenza A by DFA.
Serial bronchial lavages were increasingly blood-tinged, raising concern for alveolar hemorrhage.
He was given vitamin K to reverse his INR, and his Hct was monitored closely.
DFA returned positive for influenza A. BAL bacterial and fungal cultures were negative, so all antimicrobials were discontinued on [**2105-2-17**].
