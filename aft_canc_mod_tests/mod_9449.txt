She then had lower extremity Duplex studies which showed deep venous thrombosis in the right common femoral vein extending to the popliteal vein.
Her hematocrit continued to drop to 27.4 on [**7-18**], and the decision was then made on [**2172-7-19**] to stop her anticoagulation since she was having symptoms of a gastrointestinal bleed and had required four units of packed red blood cells.
GI consultation was obtained, and the GI team recommended an endoscopic evaluation.
Since her respiratory status was stable, and her hematocrit was stable at 30 off of Heparin, and she had an IVC filter in place, she was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on [**2172-7-21**].
The following day she had an EGD which revealed gastritis that appeared somewhat hemorrhagic in nature.
Recommendation was to check the serum H. pylori which was positive, and H. pylori treatment was started with Flagyl and clarithromycin for the H. pylori.
She continued to be stable on the floor with her blood pressure under good control with the metoprolol, and on Protonix for gastrointestinal prophylaxis as well as antibiotics for treatment of her urinary tract infection and her H. pylori.
Colonoscopy on [**2172-7-24**] noted a 4 cm fungating lesion in the region of the cecum.
Following this, CT scan was obtained to stage what was considered to be a likely malignancy, and no abnormal lesions or adenopathy were identified.
Echocardiogram was repeated which showed improvement in her right ventricular function, but still elevated right pulmonary artery pressures.
A VQ scan was completed which showed multiple profusion deficits consistent with nonpulmonary emboli.
Lovenox was started and hematocrit was repeated in the morning and found to be stable at 33.
