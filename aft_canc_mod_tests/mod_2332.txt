Clinical picture was initially concerning for orbital cellultis, which was ruled out by CT sinus imaging, showing only preseptal/periorbital involvement.
Wound swab of the left eye grew rare pseudomonas aeruginosa and sparse staph coagulase negative bacteria.
She underwent MRI imaging without contrast which did not show anything concerning outside of degenerative disc disease.
She had an LP done on [**2134-12-28**] which was negative for CNS involvement of AML.
Her peripheral blast count has been increasing and she underwent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2135-1-10**] which unfortunately showed increasing blasts in the biopsy.
She was very distressed to learn the result of her BMBx on [**1-10**].
Follow up CT scans that have showed some persistent lesions in the liver, but no clear evidence of growth of her neuroendocrine tumor.
Last scan was on [**2134-12-23**].
End of [**Month (only) 958**]/beginning of [**2133-3-17**], ongoing workup for weakness and confusion at OSH, and noted to have low blood counts including anemia and thrombocytopenia.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and she underwent a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2133-4-28**], which revealed involvement by acute myeloid leukemia with monoblasts and monocytes accounting for 29% of the aspirate differential, categorized as AML, FAB subtype M5B.
MRI of the brain was negative, LP was negative, EEG results were negative for any seizures and her symptoms resolved during the course of her initial hospitalization.
CMV viremia in [**10/2133**], treated with Valcyte.
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2133-12-11**], due to persistent low counts and increased monocytes on her peripheral blood did not show any evidence for leukemia although with possible dysplastic changes.
Admitted on [**2134-1-31**] due to worsening upper respiratory symptoms with temperature to 100.2, increased congestion/sinus pain and cough.
In [**1-/2134**], platelet count continued to decrease and repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2134-2-18**] did not show any evidence for recurrent leukemia but was noted for Trisomy 8.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] received modified cytarabine therapy from [**Date range (2) 44392**] followed by her DLI on [**2134-3-26**].
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2134-5-27**] showed no increased blasts in the marrow but with continued evidence for Trisomy 8 chromosome abnormality.
Chimerism showed her to be 55% donor, increased from 20% in [**3-18**] cycle of Decitabine on [**2134-5-31**] with the plan to move forward with a second DLI.
Repeat BM biopsy on [**2134-6-30**] showed a markedly hypocellular marrow (5% cellularity) with erythroid dominant hematopoiesis with mild erythroid dyspoiesis.
Diagnostic morphologic features of involvement by acute leukemia are not seen.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**2134-7-15**] showed an erythroid dominant marrow with myloid hyperplasia and left shift.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**2134-8-9**] due to increasing circulating blasts showed increasing blast count.
Her chimerism showed that she was 35% donor.
3rd cycle of Decitabine on [**2134-9-2**], followed by a 4th cycle on [**2134-9-30**] as her overall peripheral blast count had markedly improved.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**2134-10-21**] showed residual blasts with same phenotype as seen before, both in peripheral blood (1%) and marrow (4-6%).
By immunohistochemistry, CD34 highlights blasts which are 3-5% of marrow cellularity.
Increasing peripheral blast count with repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**2135-1-10**] shows a marrow cellularity of 20%.

She complained of neck and jaw pain for which she underwent a CT revealed stranding/lymphadenopathy concerning for infection in the neck.
Her symptoms recurred again in [**Month (only) 958**], with continued blasts on peripheral smear after MEC and 1 week post-DLI with extreme fatigue and gum pain felt to be related to recurrent leukemia.
Bone marrow biopsy was repeated on [**2-27**], revealing persistent involvement of her AML.
Her fevers continued since her transfer from the ICU and a PICC line which was noted to be ~ 1 yr old was pulled, cultured, and a new PICC was placed.
Her neck and jaw pain were significantly improved although she did continue to complain of abdominal discomfort after eating.
Repeated blood cultures revealed no infection; 1 urine culture from [**3-20**] showed < 10,000 colonies of Enterococcus resistant to vancomycin.
She was initiated on daptomycin, and repeated urine cultures were negative.
Her ANC continued to be < 100.
Posaconazole 200 mg/5 mL (40 mg/mL) Suspension Sig: Five (5) mL PO TID (3 times a day).
Your blood pressure improved with antibiotics and we decided to start treating your AML again given continued blasts.
Following a second round of chemotherapy with azacitadine/mylotarg, your blast count improved somewhat, however we did a third round with decitabine to keep your blast count low.
At time of discharge, you had repeatedly clear blood and urine cultures with no fevers for five days prior to your discharge.
