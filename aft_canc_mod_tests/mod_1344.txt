CT HEAD ([**2108-5-7**]): No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute major vascular territorial infarction.MRI would be more sensitive for acute ischemia.
CARDIAC CATH ([**2108-5-7**]): 1.
Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated right and left heart filling pressures with a mean RA of 14mmHg and mean PCWP of 21mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.0 l/min/m2.
ECHO ([**2108-5-8**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Regarding etiology, there was no clear precipitant as cardiac cath showed no suspect lesions and while his Troponin was elevated, his CK-MB was not and his renal disease may confound the utility of troponin.
The echo showed no obvious structural cause.
While being rewarmed his blood pressure was transiently low (into 60s systolic) requiring levophed for a short time ([**Date range (1) 4479**] AM).
Neurology followed and felt that his initial exam was re-assuring (intact pupillary, gag and corneal with movement of BL lower extremities).
His neurologic exam improved throughout his course.
Coronary artery disease: No significant coronary disease was seen on cath to explain VF arrest.
Pump: Echo performed was a suboptimal study, but the LV function appeared normal.
Head CT negative for bleed, CVA, edema or herniation.
His creatinine continued to improve and was 3.4 on discharge.
Last BM biopsy [**2108-4-30**] which did not show evidence of MM.
Controlled on weekly Dexamethasone and daily Thalidomide which were held during the admission.
Anemia:  Hematocrit 35.2 on admission and trended down during stay.
Medications on Admission: Lipitor 20 mg daily Glipizide 2.5mg daily Lasix 40 mg q MWF Allopurinol 300 mg daily Toprol XL 25 daily ASA 81mg 3x/week Gabapentin 300mg tid Dexamethasone 40mg qMonday Thalidomide 100mg qhs  Discharge Medications: 1.
