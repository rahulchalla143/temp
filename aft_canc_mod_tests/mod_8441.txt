Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was slightly elevated (20/23/20).
ECHO [**2161-7-17**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Patient had no further signs of tamponade with resuming therapeutic Lovenox.
MRV was performed which showed nearly complete occlusive SVC thrombus, and saddle PE in the right/left pulmonary arteries.
Serial echocardiograms were performed and were stable.
She will have followup echocardiogram as an outpatient.
She had a repeat MRV after 1-2 weeks which showed little change in the thrombus.
The etiology of this could be due to pulmonary embolism, poor preload from SVC clot, or due to irritation from blood within the pericardium.
Her CEA was checked and was 83 (trending downward).
