Lungs scattered rhonchi  Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with a well-healed midline scar.
His extremity examination revealed the right lower extremity to be somewhat cool and paler from the left with decreased sensation.

Emergency  study performed by the cardiology fellow on call.
He developed fever and respiratory distres during the transfusion of a unit of RBC on [**2163-7-13**].
His temperatoure was elevated from 99.3F to 101.0F.

[**2163-7-12**]\  ECG Study  Sinus tachycardia Low voltage Incomplete right bundle branch block pattern Early precordial QRS transition with prominent R wave in lead V2 - consider posterior myocardial infarct of indeterminate age Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities with slight ST elevation - cannot exclude in part injury/ischemia.
Clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2163-7-10**]: sinus tachycardia rate has increased.
FINDINGS: The angiograms showed occlusion of the abdominal aorta just below the takeoff of the inferior mesenteric artery ([**Female First Name (un) 899**]).
The bilateral iliac arteries, the right common femoral and proximal left common femoral arteries are not patent.
Mr [**Known lastname **] required a significant amount of pressors to maintain a blood pressure.
[**2165-7-10**] - [**2165-7-11**]  Pt was weaned of pressors for blood pressure control.
PT HIT panel came back negative.
His heart rate was in the 140's, with low BP SBP 90's.
Pt was transfused 1 unit PRBC's for decrease BP, still was tachy (140), after blood transfusion pt remained in sinus tach.
with SBP 80 - 90.
[**2165-7-14**]  Pt spiked temperature to 102, became more tachycardic with SBP in the 70's.
A stat ABG was done.
CXR showed r plueral effussion.
Lephofed was changed to neo and titrated for a MAP of 70.
pt recieved several rounds of epi / bicarb / ca ( BP / HR would return for short periods of time. )
F/U CXR showed no effussion or pnuemothorax.
