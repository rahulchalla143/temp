Recommendations: Follow-up biopsy results Avoid NSAIDs. "
A single sessile 5 mm non-bleeding polyp of benign appearance was found in the proximal ascending colon.
Recommendations: Follow-up biopsy results Serial Hct, transfuse as needed.
F/U colonoscopy to be determined based on polyp biopsy results.
Repeat EGD [**2139-2-24**]: "Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Push Enteroscopy [**2139-2-24**]: "Findings: Esophagus:  Protruding Lesions The previously visualized submucosal nodule was seen in the middle third of the esophagus.
Two superficial, nonbleeding ulcers secondary to recent coaptive cauterization were visualized in the gastric body.
TTE [**2139-2-16**]: "MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *5.5 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: *1.4 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.2 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 5.6 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 50% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: 3.3 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aorta - Ascending: *4.0 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 1.4 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.7 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 2.00 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 231 msec TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): *54 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  The rhythm appears to be sinus with frequent atrial ectopy.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
If more definitive information regarding regional and global left ventricular systolic function is desired, a radionuclide study is suggested."
Ankle/foot [**2139-2-19**]: "FINDINGS: Right ankle; the bones are normal in mineralization and intact.
Head CT [**2139-2-20**]: "CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: assess for bleed, masses, etc  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 68 year old woman with new delta MS REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for bleed, masses, etc CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CXR [**2139-2-28**]: "CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: infiltrates.
FINDINGS:  The exam is somewhat limited by the patient body habitus.
On admission, she was found to have significant crackles and lower extremity edema bilaterally with CXR consistent with CHF.
In addition, she had a low MCV anemia with a HCT of 19 and received 2 units of blood.
The patient was aggressivel diuresed with good effect and received an EGD ([**2-17**]) which yielded no obvious source and colonoscopy found Polyps (cecum, prox.
Anemia:  On admission, the patient presented with Hct 19.9 with Fe studies suggestive of Fe deficient anemia.
As pt was guaiac positive a colonoscopy was performed which showed  AVMs (s/p thermal ablation) + polyps (s/p polypectomy, bx pnd) in cecum, colon; nonbleeding diverticula.
An EGD done at the time revealed 3cm submucosal esoph lesions.
The push enteroscopy reached the 2nd part of the duodenum and demonstrated AVMs again but no active lesions.
She was hemodynamically stable with Hct >30 for several days.
As the small bowel follow through was an incomplete study and only reached the proximal small bowel we could not rule out small bowel mass.
However, the study was not repeated due to low clnical suspicion.
She was continued on PPIs, the ASA and NSAIDS were all held and monitored with serial Hcts which remained stable.
An outpatient capsule enteroscopy is recommended.
ARF:  Pt with baseline Creatinine of [**1-17**].2.
She received several units of PRBC and her Creatinine returned to baseline.
CHF: pt admitted with complaints of fatigue, SOB, orthopnea with bilateral crackls, significant bilateral lower extremity edema and CXR consistent with CHF.
Likely secondary to high output failure given anemia and CXR findings.
Previous echo [**2126**] revealed no valve abnormalities.
Acetazolamide was added to her lasix regimen and her serum bicarb normalized and the alkalosis resolved.
On HD #14, while at a study she developed another acute episode of gout flare.
The patient responded quickly to the above interventions and a specific cause of the altered mental status was never firmly established.
HTN/Hypotension: On admission pt had a SBP 130 on anti-hypertensives.
After her brief MICU stay for Upper GI bleed, her SBP was in the 100s off antihypertensives.
The patient was given several units of PRBCs for continuing GI bleed and her BP returned to [**Location 213**]/Hypertensive levels.
She was initially started on metoprolol due to ARF, but was placed back on Valsartan and the metoprolol was d/c'd as renal function returned to [**Location 213**].
Valsartan dose was decreased from outpatient regimen of 160 mg once daily to 120mg once daily given transient low SBP.
