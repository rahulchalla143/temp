She moved well on exam last night.
Cardiovascular exam was considered to be stable.
DTRs were [**Name2 (NI) 19912**] at the knees and toes were mute.
Physical Exam: Examination: T 100.1 (had temp>101 earlier), bp 102/38, rr 18, 96%RA General: white female, NAD Heart: regular rate and rhythm with III/VI SEM RUSB, radiation to bilateral carotids vs bruits Lungs: clear to auscultation anteriorly bilaterally Abdomen: soft, nontender +bs Extremities: warm, well-perfused  Mental Status: The patient was initially not speaking at all, staring but not following commands; ten minutes later, she was oriented to self, [**Hospital1 **], with intact language (no errors, normal repetition) and normal speech.

In the absence of prior films, chest CT recommended for the right upper nodule.
FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid arteries.
IMPRESSION: Moderate plaque with a left 60 to 69% and a right 40 to 59% carotid stenosis.
FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both upper and lower extremities.
Evaluation of the reformatted images on a separate workstation was valuable in delineating the anatomy.
CARDIAC CATH REPORT [**4-14**]:  COMMENTS:   1.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA, the LCX, and the RCA had proximal occlusions.
Selective arterial conduit angiography revealed a patent LIMA to LAD.
Peripheral angiography showed an 80% origin stenosis of the right CIA and an occluded left CIA.
The left subclavian artery had a 70% eccentric lesion with a pressure gradient of 10 mmHg after the administration of NTG.
Left ventriculography showed no wall motion abnormalities (EF 60 to 65%) with no mitral regurgitation.
CT BRAIN [**4-15**]:  NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN: There are multiple large rounded lesions within the brain which are hyperdense, consistent with hemorrhagic metastases.
There is a moderate amount of edema surrounding the hemorrhagic metastasis, demonstrated as hypodensity of the surrounding white matter.
MRI WITH CONTRAST [**4-17**]:  EXAM: MRI of the brain.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with history of cancer with cardiac catheterization and intracranial hemorrhage for further evaluation to rule out metastatic disease.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.
Correlation was made with the head CT of the same date, [**2145-4-16**].
[**4-17**] CXR: Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval development of moderate, bilateral, pleural effusions when compared to [**2145-4-17**].
Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo woman with cad, pvd, htn, high chol, breast ca in the past, and questionable history of colon cancer 2 yrs ago, who developed left sided weakness morning after cath, as well as L extinction on DSS, L homonomous hemianopsia, and at least two periods of unresponsiveness lasting at least several minutes in duration suggestive of seizures, with CT scan showing multiple areas of hemorrhage in both cerebral hemispheres, and large left occipito-parietal hemorrhage suggestive of bleeding into mets (vs amyloid, less likely).
She was also informed of the likelihood (based on head CT) that the brain lesions were metastases and that her prognosis was poor.
MRI of the brain with gado confirmed that these lesions were likely mets.
CT of the torso for further metastatic workup was desired, but the patient developed acute renal failure thought related to contrast nephropathy.
On [**4-19**], her creatinine had improved, and she was weaned from BiPAP to facemask with 10L O2.
She had also had an elevated WBC count and some chest xray evidence of pneumonia at this time.
Clinically, her neuro exam remained stable and her kidney function improved; she diuresed well.
The numerous brain lesions could be treated with whole brain irradiation as one palliative measure.
On [**4-21**] she dropped her sats again and developed further respiratory distress while in the ICU.
