Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: B/L CIA stents, Right EIA stent Mediastinoscopy Lung Cancer   History of Present Illness: 49 y/o homeless male with history of severe PVD, DM, alcoholism, and COPD who was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**10-3**] for management of RLE ulcer and cellulitis.He has undergone  iliac stent placement (b/l CIA, R EIA) with an extended PACU course  However his pre-operative work-up reveled two opacities in the LUL.
The patient has undergone a full staging work-up with cervical mediastinoscopy, that revealed to evidence of malignancy in the nodes, a PET scan that revealed FDG avid disease only in the LUL and a head MRI that was within normal limits.

Lung mass, please assess f  CT of the thoracic spine without contrast dated [**2186-12-7**].
FINDINGS: Study is compared with recent plain radiographs dated [**2186-11-24**].
IMPRESSION:  1) No bony destructive lesion identified in the thoracic spine.
2) Chronic- appearing wedge deformity of the L1 vertebral body, which may relate to prominent Schmorl node in its inferior end plate (see separate report of lumbar CT study).
Pathology Examination  SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: 4R, 4L LOWER PARA TRACHEAL NODES, 2R, 2L UPPER PARA TRACHEAL NODES AND SUBCRANIAL (5)  DIAGNOSIS:  1.
These specimen are bisected and entirely submitted in cassette C.  Part 3 is additionally labeled "4R lower para tracheal lymph nodes" and consists of multiple fragments of pink-tan and anthracotic lymph nodes measuring up to 1.5 x 0.5 and the specimen is entirely submitted in cassette D.  Part 4 is additionally labeled "2L upper para tracheal lymph nodes" and consists of multiple fragments of pink-tan and anthracotic appearing lymph nodes which measure up to 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm entirely submitted in cassette E.  Part 5 is additionally labeled "7 subcarinal nodes" and consists of multiple fragments of pink-tan and anthracotic appearing lymph nodes measuring up to 4.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm entirely submitted in cassette F-H.

[**2186-10-20**]  FDG TUMOR IMAGING (PET-CT)  METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation correction and for fusion with emission PET images.
[The noncontrast CT imagesare not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]
The fasting blood glucoselevel, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 87 mg/dL.
There is a right maxillary sinus retention cyst, bullae in the lungs and a non-FDG-avid cyst in the tail of the pancreas.
- [**11-2**]: Cardiopulm stress testing results: Testing showed a reduction in exercise capacity with a maximum oxygen consumption of 25% of predicted (8.4 ml/kg/min) in a test terminated for patient SOB and arm fatigue.
The elevated Ve/VCO2 and reduced DLCO from prior testing are consistent with pulmonary vascular disease, however the lack of desaturation indicates that this is not a primary factor in the patient?s exercise limitation.
- [**11-24**]: T spine films done - No listhesis or fracture.
Social work notes indicate that his car is still at the rest area on Rt.
2) Chronic- appearing wedge deformity of the L1 vertebral body, which may relate to prominent Schmorl node in its inferior end plate (see separate report of lumbar CT study).
- [**2186-12-8**]: Wound Care - WOUND CARE - gluteal ulcer.
