In the OSH, he was noted to be "writhing," which decreased with ativan x 5 mg. Also received one dose of levofloxacin for presumed UTI, and blood cx was sent.
Had a negative head CT at OSH.
Because of hypertension to SBP 220s, he was started on his home agents, then changed to nitroprusside.

Superinfection of the lesion cannot be excluded.
An ultrasound of this mass is recommended.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2156-7-18**] left axis deviation is now present.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal(LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic  function is normal.
MICU course: After arriving at [**Hospital1 18**], patient had CXR that was clear, though RN did suction vomitus out of ETT.
Also had head CT that was negative for bleed or mass, EKG with peaked T waves but no ischemic changes, serum tox negative.
Had a TTE to look for vegetations that was negative, does have LVH.
Was also switched from nitroprusside gtt to labetolol gtt for blood pressure control, thiocyante level was sent out of concern for cyanide toxicity given his ESRD.
Repeat CXR showed increasing opacity in the left retrocardiac region, concerning for pneumonia.
Blood, urine, CSF cultures were without growth.
Sputum culture c/w OP flora.
Did have WBC count 19 with left shift, which came down to 11.
Delta ms: -was likely multifactorial, including some element from HTN, dilantin side effect as free dilantin levels were markedly elevated with %bound dilantin around 55%, possible postictal state.
His CXR was initially clear, but had some evidence of PNA on repeat and RN suctioned same material out of ETT that was vomited.
Follow up chest x-ray was markedly improved .
TTE was negative for vegetation.
Will need further outpatient management.
ESRD: continued HD MWF, renal team followed closely and challenged dry weight; continued procrit as BP allowed (held when BP too high).
Anemia: stool found to be guaiac positive and because of unexplained hematocrit drop he underwent an endoscopy and colonoscopy which revealed gastritis and a polyp (latter was biopsied- results pending at the time of this summary).
His blood sugars were better controlled on discharge, though he will need [**Last Name (un) **] f/u as an outpatient to manage his brittle diabetes.
H/o sz: EEG#1 had enceph, no sx; EEG#2 was normal; was on dilantin initially, switched to trileptal because levels were running high; will f/u with Neuro as outpatient.

Dry gangrene of 2nd, 3rd digits on right hand, likely from microvascular disease though concerning for embolic disease from proximal vessels 4.
End-stage renal disease, HD-dependent   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable with improved blood pressure control, improved blood sugar control.
If you develop confusion, lightheadedness, dizziness, systolic blood pressures consistently over 200mmHg, headache or visual changes, blood sugars consistently over 300 mg/dL, please call your doctor and/or go to the nearest Emergency Room for evaluation.
