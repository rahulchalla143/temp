Urine output and residual renal function were excellent.
Pathology of the tumor revealed  "Oncocytoma, margin free of tumor" On about POD 6, the patient was noted to be increasingly distended.
A CT of the abdomen was obtained showing "Moderate grade partial small bowel obstruction with transition point noted within the right lower quadrant, slightly anterior to the transplant kidney."
He was taken back to the OR on [**2101-5-24**] again with Drs' [**Name5 (PTitle) 816**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 3748**] for Exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions and freeing up obstruction.
This was felt to be the transition point seen on CT and this was the cause of the obstruction.
This fluid was sent for culture and lab tests.
Creatinine was low, so it was not felt to be a urine leak.
Enterococcus (Vanco sensitive) did grow from the fluid as well as from blood cultures obtained the same day.
Urine cultures from the day previous were also positive for Enterococcus and he was started on Vancomycin and Flagyl which were given x 7 days.
The cultures were negative x 5, however he was started on PO Vanco as his WBC remained elevated, and no other source was identified.
A CMV viral load was sent which was positive at 909 copies, he was started on a 3 week course of Valcyte.
Over the next 2 days, his Hct was noted to fall from 27% to 17%.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] performed a cystoscopy on [**6-7**] due to concern for fluid from the JP drain from initial surgery was found to have a creatinine of 22.9.
Patient was given a glucometer and will check blood sugars at home.
