Urinalysis and CXR were unremarkable.
VS on transfer HR 85, RR 10, 97 2L, BP 95/49.
Upon his return to the US in early [**Month (only) 216**], his PCP suspected left inguinal lymphadenopathy and arranged for excisional biopsy of a part of a lymph node.
CT imaging demonstrated bilateral basilar pulmonary nodules and significant lymphadenopathy involving the  retroperitoneal, pelvic, and left iliac chains.
Infectious disease work-up was unremarkable.
The CT findings, along with elevated LDH, raised concern about a lymphoproliferative disorder.
PET scan demonstrated intensely FDG avid in the left cervical (SUV 18), right axillary (SUV 5), left supraclavicular (SUV 17), left paratracheal (SUV 13), retroperitoneal (SUV 22,) and left inguinal (SUV 25) lymph node groups.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] repeat excisional biopsy of an FDG-avid inguinal lymph node on [**9-13**].
On histological examination, the lymph node architecture was completely effaced with a background of epithelioid histiocyte granulomatoid aggregates.

[**2132-11-14**] 6:50 pm BLOOD CULTURE    Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2132-11-21**]):       CAPNOCYTOPHAGA SPECIES.
CT chest: 1.
Recommend followup CT scan after treatment.
Patient was hypotensive but responsive to fluids in the ED, called out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after uneventful overnight stay (spiked temp of 102.8).
Patient was continued on intravenous fluids as his blood pressures would dip into SBP85-90s whenever intravenous fluids were discontinued.
On Friday, [**11-21**], blood cultures drawn on the second day of hospitalization came back positive for gram negative rods, likely Capnocytophaga.
Of note, Capnocytophaga is a gram negative rod organism found in canines which has been found to cause fulminant sepsis in asplenic patients.
Pneumonia: Chest Xrays and CT chest confirmed evolving pneumonia.
CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism and CT abdomen/pelvis did not show interval change in lymphadenopathy suggestive of worsening disease.
Chest ultrasound showed that the patient's pulmonary effusions were trace/small and non-tappable.
Patient was continued on Levofloxacin with good effect and repeat CT chest showed interval improvement in bibasilar consolidations.
As patient continued to have these visual changes, CT head was ordered which did not show any acute changes.
Patient was ordered for CDiff stool toxin assays which were negative and patent's diarrhea resolved.
