In any case, visualization of the MR- described cavernous hemangioma would be extremely difficult, given its reported small size and typically limited visibility on a noncontrast head CT scan.
CONCLUSION: No interval change from prior study of [**2131-11-11**].
In view of the questions you have raised in the history, kindly forward the original report of the [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital CT scan for our independent review.
