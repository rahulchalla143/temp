He presented to an outside hospital ED, where his ECG reveals 4-mm ST elevations in 2,3, and AVF and 2-mm ST elevations in V3 through V6 and 3-mm ST depressions in 1 and AVL.
Complete heart block was noted with a junctional escape of 50.
The patient was given Atropine, Dopamine, and placed on 100% nonrebreather mask for oxygen saturations in the 80% range.
The patient was bradycardiac into the 50s with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s and it was unclear whether the patient was actually externally paced to a rate of 80.
Cardiac catheterization here revealed left main with no obstruction.
The LAD showed tight mid stenosis, which was not intervened upon.
The LVDP was 18, no right heart catheterization was performed secondary to the IVC filter.
Post intervention EKG showed normal sinus at a rate of 85 with Q waves in the inferior leads and improved 2-mm ST elevation in 2, 3, and F; resolution of anterior ST elevations was also noted and T-wave inversions were present in 2, 3, S, and V3 through V5.
Status post recent cystoscopy on [**2144-4-10**], which revealed response to chemotherapy, but bimanual examination under anesthesia confirmed a left immobile pelvic mass suggesting extravesicle invasive disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.5, blood pressure 110/60, rate 90 in normal sinus rhythm and respiratory rate 16.
Ventilator settings were IMV 10/700, 80% FIO2 with PEEP of 5, first ABG 7.28/43/336.
JVP at 12 cm.
PULMONARY:  Examination revealed that the patient is clear to auscultation bilaterally on anterior examination.
Given the fact that the patient has a known cancer and had received lytics at an outside hospital and also had focal neurological complaints with examination notable for left-sided dysmetria, head CT was obtained, which revealed left cerebellar infarction with increased pressure in the posterior fossa.
Repeat head CT twenty-four hours after the initial revealed no change in the findings.
On [**2144-5-12**], the patient was transferred to the floor for further neurological monitoring and optimization of his cardiac regimen.
Echocardiogram was also obtained on [**2144-5-12**], which revealed the following:  EF 25% to 30%; E to A ratio of 0.57 with estimated PA systolic pressure of 33; moderate [**Hospital1 **]-atrial dilatation noted as was moderate RV and LV dilation; mild MR noted; mild aortic root dilatation was also noted.
Given the patient suppressed EF and mild clinical heart failure necessitating nasal cannula oxygen, the patient was aggressively diuresed and appeared to tolerate this well.
Of note:  Urinalysis was sent of his chronic indwelling Foley, which was notable for large blood, greater than 10 white blood cell per high power field and nitrite positivity.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 34938**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2916**] and the urologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 40907**] Rathore at [**Hospital3 3834**].
