In [**2115-5-6**], she developed a recurrence in the right mandible and staging CT scan revealed multiple nodules in the lung, liver and spleen which were FDG avid on PET scan.
Biopsy revealed metastatic melanoma.
In [**11-11**], she noted a soft tissue nodule in her right side with torso CT on [**2121-4-5**] showing a right superior pelvic subcutaneous enhancing nodule worrisome for a metastatic focus.
Spine MRI and radiation therapy records were reviewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3929**] of radiation oncology and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] of neurosurgery with conscensus being that she has spinal cord compression without neurologic compromise.
She returns to the ED for evaluation of these symptoms.

CT Torso([**7-6**]):CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Area of hypodensity adjacent to fissure of ligamentum teres likely reflects perfusion differences.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, uterus, and rectum are unremarkable.
Again noted is an abnormal soft tissue density within the T11-T12 vertebral bodies, extending into the central canal, better assessed on MRI of the thoracic spine obtained concurrently.
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal pre- and post-gado T1, T2, STIR, and axial post-gado T1- and T2-weighted images of the thoracic spine were obtained.

TECHNIQUE: CT of the thoracic spine was obtained with 3.75-mm axial and 2-mm coronal and sagittal reconstructions.
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to a spinal arteriogram from [**2121-7-7**], CT of the chest from [**2121-7-6**] and MR of the thoracic spine from [**2121-7-5**].
