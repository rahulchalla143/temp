No antibiotics were initiated and WBC count trended down by ICU Day #2.
HIT Antibody Panel was sent and was positive.
Serotonin Release Assay was sent out.
The patient was also noted to have increasing INR to 1.8, without a significant change in PTT.
DIC labs were not conclusive.
CXR in the holding area revealed an acute infilrate consistent with hospital-acquired pneumonia on top of her known severe COPD.
Her creatinine rose from 0.4 to 1.5 in this setting.
Her FeNa was 2.1 and therefore her renal failure was thought to be from intrinisic renal failure, likely acute tubular necrosis.
A repeat CXR on [**9-30**] showed persistent atelectasis with concern for central obstruction.
A chest CT was recommended and preformed the same day.
The CT revealed RML consolidation as well as known COPD and the question of an adrenal metastasis.
Her exam was remarkable for decreased lung sounds bilaterally, a heart murmur and right shoulder mass that have both been present for years.
Her labs were remarkable for elevated renal function findings and leukocytosis.
Over her stay, her oxygen saturation improved while on oxygen flow and peaked to 95-96% on 1-L, up to 99% after nebulizers.
Her lung exam improved over several days, with increasingly louder respiratory sounds.
One chest x-ray was suggestive of a loculated lesion that was then reassessed with a chest CT.
The patient's creatinine decreased and stabilized within the range of 0.7-0.8.
Her GFR continued to be impaired at 43 (nml for age group is 75), but it was similarly stable.
The patient's WBC count was initially elevated (around 12) and then started to fall within normal levels (<10).
It was found that her albumin levels were below the normal range of variation (2.4).
She was C. Diff negative and therefore was placed on her home regimen of loperamide.
Her EKG from [**10-1**] normal and a subsequent echocardiogram did not show any concerning abnormalities (R/L atria nml; mild L ventricle hypertrophy; aortic and mitral valve leaflets mildly thickened; no Ao.
Continued with nebulizers and aggressive Chest PT.
Upper extremity edema decreased as patient diuresed post-op.
