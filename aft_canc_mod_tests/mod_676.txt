She was emergently intubated for presumed pulmonary edema as seen on a chest x-ray.
The total time of pulse was approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
The patient subsequently ruled in for an myocardial infarction with a CK of 623 and an MB of 123.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission showed temperature of 100.5, pulse 178, blood pressure 94/70.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils were equal and reactive 5 mm to 4 mm.
Pulmonary exam showed rare diffuse wheezing.
Abdominal exam had positive bowel sounds, obese, nontender.
Genitourinary exam shows a massively prolapsed uterus.
Extremities showed 1+ edema and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
Neurological examination the patient moved all four extremities, withdrew to pain and had intact gag reflex.
LABS ON ADMISSION:  Patient had a white count of 11.4, hemoglobin 10.6, hematocrit 32.1, platelet count 477.
A Chem 7 of 139, 3.6, 102, 23, 17, 1.2, 175.
Urinalysis showed greater than 50 white cells and many bacteria.
Chest x-ray findings were consistent with flash pulmonary edema with right base atelectasis verses pneumonia.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 119.
A repeat electrocardiogram showed rate of 183 and [**Street Address(2) 17989**] depression in the lateral leads and in lead 2.
On exam at that point the patient was intubated, unresponsive to sternal rub and had no spontaneous movements.
Oculocephalic reflex and corneal reflex were intact.
The neurology service recommended an EEG to rule out status epilepticus, a Head CT and the avoidance of sedative medications.
Head CT was performed on [**2179-8-5**] which showed no acute process.
EEG was performed on [**2179-8-6**] which showed background rhythm of very low voltage, no definite cortical activity was discernible.
On the recommendation of the neurology service the head CT was repeated on [**2179-8-9**].
This again showed no bleed, no mass effect or midline shift, only mild atrophy.
On physical examination the patient made no neurologic improvement throughout the admission.
She continued to be unresponsive to painful stimuli or to voice.
Infectious Disease:  Due to fevers and an infiltrate seen on chest x-ray on admission the patient was started on Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime on [**2179-8-5**].
Pan cultures were performed.
The only positive results of these cultures was urinary tract infection with E. coli.
Throughout treatment with antibiosis, the patient continued to intermittently spike fevers and repeat cultures were performed on [**2179-8-16**].
Urine cultures were positive for yeast greater than 100,000.
A follow-up echocardiogram done on [**8-9**] to shows ejection fraction of less than 25%, global left ventricular hypokinesis and 3+ mitral regurg due to the patient's severe neurologic condition.
No further cardiac workup was performed and no interventions were pursued.
