While at rehab, warfarin was restarted for Afib (this had been discontinued in [**5-/2171**] [**2-13**] a large diverticular bleed) and 3 days later he had dark/tarry stools in the setting of INR of 3.4 and hct of 27.5 (from 30 on [**2172-3-26**]).
He was sent to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**4-9**] where he was found to have hct of 28.3 which dropped to 25.8 on repeat.
INR was 2.31.
He was given at least 2 units of FFP and 10 mg vitamin K which brought his INR down to 1.9.
He underwent EGD which showed only a small amount of blood in the stomach and signs of congestive gastropathy with multiple hemorrhagic changes.
Per Cardiac Surgery, he is not a candidate for surgery at this time due to GI bleed and various other issues (see below) so a transfer to Medicine was requested.

[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Diverticulosis of the mid-ascending colon and sigmoid colon.
[**2172-4-15**] Non-invasive arterial studies: 1.
[**2172-4-24**] CTA Abdomen FINDINGS: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo M w/ h/o CHF (EF 45%), porcine AV replacement, severe MR/TR, AFib, tachy-brady syndrome s/p pacemaker, diverticulosis s/p bleed in [**2171**], transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-13**] for evaluation of melena.
Although an unsuccessful attempt was made to stop the bleed via interventional radiology, the patient did not want to undergo a repeat colonoscopy and it was felt that the risks of this procedure in light of his comorbid conditions outweighed the benefits.
EGD at OSH showed congestive gastropathy, repeat EGD at [**Hospital1 18**] showed atrophic gastritis.
Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis of mid-ascending colon and sigmoid w/o any active bleeding; a polyp was also noted in the transverse colon which was removed, pathology c/w adenoma.
He underwent a tagged RBC scan which revealed a bleeding near the hepatic flexure, unfortunately IR was unable localize the source for an intervention.
A colonoscopy was consider however, given the patients poor functional status, significant comorbidities, and shift in the patient's goals of care, the decision was made to treat his bleed conservatively.
He was given multiple transfusions and his hematocrit gradually stabilized.
#) Thrombocytopenia: On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], plts were around 60.
During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**], platelets remained stable around 60.
#) Acute on chronic kidney disease: Pt with stage III CKD with baseline creatinine of 1.6.
On admission patient was at his baseline but creatinine bumped to 2.2 on [**4-17**] after several days of NPO status in setting continued diuresis.
Blood pressures also dropped in this setting so ATN was a possible contributor.
#) RLL infiltrate on CXR: Pt found to have RLL infiltrate on CXR on admission.
Vascular was consulted and ABIs performed which showed low level R LE disease at iliac level.
You developed a second episode of bleeding in to your intestines, which were were unable to stop.
