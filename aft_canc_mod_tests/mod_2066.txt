CXR [**4-17**]: 1.
Recommend chest CT for better evaluation.
CXR [**4-20**]: Again, there has been apparent resolution of the right pneumothorax.
CT Chest; 1.
CT head: Normal contrast-enhanced head CT with no evidence of metastasis.
CT OF THE CHEST: There is a right-sided AICD with its lead in the right ventricle.
There is a rounded, heterogeneous 6.6 x 7.7 x 12 cm collection in the right posterior medial hemithorax adjacent to the chest tube, which is consistent with a hematoma.
Additionally, there has been interval development of a moderate- sized pneumothorax, which is predominantly seen anteriorly.
There is a small lymph node in the AP window region that measures 0.7 cm in short axis and 1.3 cm in long axis.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The liver is normal in size and contour.
However, this appearance is unchanged since the prior CT from [**2195**].
CT OF THE PELVIS: The urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and is grossly unremarkable.
Prostate gland is not enlarged and measures 3.1 x 3.9 cm.
A bone scan may be more sensitive in detection of subtle metastatic lesions.
Interval placement of a right-sided chest tube, which is seen with its tip in the posterior right hemithorax medially.
Previously identified right middle and left lower lobe nodules are not seen on the current study due to interval development of a small left pleural effusion and the right-sided airspace disease.
Further evaluation with a bone scan may be helpful with subtle underlying metastatic lesions.
CT orbits:In the orbits, the eye globes demonstrate possible surgical changes, the density and configuration as well as the size of the optic nerves appear within normal limits.
CT Chest [**5-15**]: Marked enlarged right pleural effusion with associated new right middle lobe and right lower lobe collapse.
Pleural fluid: WBC, Pleural 1000* #/uL 0 - 0 RBC, Pleural [**Numeric Identifier 35822**]* #/uL 0 - 0 Polys 83* % 0 - 0 Lymphocytes 12* % 0 - 0 Monos 1* % 0 - 0 Macrophages 4* % 0 - 0 Total protein 2.2 glucose 103 LDH 845 amylase 76 albumin 1.4 PH 5.5   Brief Hospital Course: 72-year-old man with COPD, CHF, presented with 6 weeks of DOE, cough.
# Lung cancer: Admission CT scan showed a mediastinal mass and right pleural effusion.
A thoracentesis was performed and the cytology was negative for malignancy.
The patient underwent a bronchoscopy that revealed a necrotic mass with biopsy revealing small-cell carcinoma.
He will need daily CBC and absolute neutrophil count check.
His WBC is 2.4, ANCis  2190 on [**2198-5-26**].
# Respiratory failure: During the bronchoscopy there was some oozing of blood.
CXR showed a right-sided pneumothorax.
His antibiotic coverage, which had been levofloxacin initially, was changed to vanc/unasyn.
Ipratropium was continued.
He was also diuresed as he was 10L positive with EF of 20%.
His oxygenation improved with diuresis.
His creatinine bumped and he was changed to lasix 80mg PO BID on [**2198-5-26**].
He will need his creatinine followed every other day.
Cardiology was consulted and repeat ECHO on [**4-21**] showed no sig effusion but noted that echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
As his BP improved, his home heart failure regimen was restarted.
Nifedipine was discontinued to all room for medications for diuresis and heart rate control.
Head CT negative for stroke.
CT of orbits negative.
His creatinine peaked at 2.7, likely [**1-13**] hypotension/ATN.
His creatinine crept up to 1.2 with diureses and his lasix was cut back.
Once his blood pressure recovered, he was restarted on his home digoxin, metoprolol, which was titrated up, and diuresed.
His BP remained low around SBP 100. .
His HR improved to 80-90.
He was maintained on metoprolol 100 TID and digoxin 250mcg with HR in 90's at discharge.
EKG showing NSR with occ PVC's.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Five (5) ml PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

You subsequently had a pneumothorax and respiratory failure, which have now resolved.
If you have worsening shortness of breath or fever, you should go to the emergency room  Followup Instructions: You will need to have CBC and absolute neutrophil count checked daily for one week [**Date range (3) 35824**].
