In the Emergency Department the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 30.4 which is a slight decrease from 31.7 on the date of discharge two days of prior.
Two large bore IVs were placed and a type and cross was sent.
He was transfused with a hematocrit of 31.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 113/57, heart rate 72, respiratory rate is between 13 and 16 and saturation at 96%.
Extremities - 1 to 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis arteries.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 9.3, hematocrit 30.4, platelet count 56,000.
INR 1.1, PTT 25.6, 75 neutrophils, 0 basophils, 0 bands.
Sodium 137, potassium 4.3, chloride 102, bicarb 27, BUN 44, creatinine 1.7, glucose 89, CK 49, Troponin 0.5.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute with left axis deviation and early R wave transition.
Transthoracic echo done on [**2179-12-13**] showed EF 30 to 40% with mild symmetric LVH.
Right ventricle noted to have normal systolic motion, thickened aortic valve with no stenosis, mitral valve with 1 to 1+ MR, delayed relaxation, 1+ TR.
Chest x-ray showed no acute pulmonary disease.
He was initially stabilized with twice daily hematocrit checks and was given large bore IVs.
The goal was to keep his hematocrit above 30.
Because of his low ejection fraction he was given a small amount of drinking fluids.
If he had any active bleeding it was decided he would go for a tagged red blood cell scan or an angiogram.
He went for a colonoscopy on [**2179-12-16**] the following day of his admission.
After having catheterization done was transferred to the CCU.
Further GI issues - he had a prolonged course in which he did not eat.
He had a right-sided flank ecchymosis which did not enlarge and he only required one transfusion after the operation.
The EKG was suggestive of an anterior septal injury.
Prior EKG had not showed ST elevations V1 through V4.
Initially some considerations were cardiac catheterization that day however he initially was treated medically with Heparin and aspirin.
His enzymes were cycled and he had cardiac catheterization on the following day.
Cardiac catheterization revealed left main coronary artery with ulcerated 90% thrombotic stenosis which included the ostium of the LAD.
During the catheterization he had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed.
His CKs were increasing from 140 to 371.
His troponin was greater than 50 and his CK- MB when his CK was 371 was 34.
Because of the low heart rate his beta blocker was held initially.
The Captopril was increased as tolerated by blood pressure.
However he had secretions and sputum cultures grew out gram negative rods which were never speciated because of mixed flora.
He had a left lower lobe infiltrate; however, the blood culture and urine culture were negative and sputum culture did not identify any dominant pathogen.
His white count remained elevated between 13 and 16; however, no new source of infection was found.
Renal - The patient's creatinine had been between 1.2 and 2 through the course of admission.
His BUN was 90 at that time.
Consequently the first night's dose was decreased to 20 mg qod and the creatinine will need to be followed to make sure that it will decrease.
He had decrease hematocrit initially from the lower GI bleed.
He also required another unit of blood on [**2179-12-25**] when his hematocrit decreased to 27.3; however, after the one unit of blood his hematocrit remained stable.
Captopril 37.5 mg po tid to be held for systolic blood pressure less than 97.
