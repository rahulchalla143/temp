The patient's cancer initially presented as syncope and further work-up revealed pericardial/pleural effusion [**2181-5-10**].
The pleural fluid revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma and the pericardial fluid a well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma.
During admission on [**6-14**], cardiology team saw the patient and recommended trial of low dose beta blocker for rate control; a pericardial window was not performed because the effusion was determined to be stable and symptoms thought to be related to dehydration and tachycardia.
Subsequent CT of the torso did not reveal a primary source but did reveal bony lytic lesions in the right ischium and bilateral ilia concerning for metastatic disease.
She also underwent an upper and lower endoscopy without evidence of a  primary lesion.
Electrocardiogram in the ED showed sinus tachycardia unchanged from prior.
Radiography showed reaccumulation of pulmonary edema and CT of the chest showed no acute changes.
Past Medical History: - Tuberculosis treated in [**2145**] with normal chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**2162**].
- normal colonoscopy 2/[**2178**].
- recent pericardial effusion/tamponade - right pleural effusion - large common femoral DVT - adenocarcinoma of unclear primary   Social History: She works as a nursing assistant.

CXR ([**7-11**]): IMPRESSION:  Increased size of now large right pleural effusion and minimally increased now moderate left pleural effusion.
Chest CT ([**7-12**]) IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR ([**7-15**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
The dyspnea after her procedure was likely a result of reexpansion edema, which was reflected on her chest X-ray.
She did not experience significant nausea during hospitalization, but continued to have diarrhea related to her chemotherapy which was treated with Lomotil.
Bilateral hip xray on [**6-12**] demonstrated no progression of known metastatic lesions.
