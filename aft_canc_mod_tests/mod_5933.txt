EKG [**8-13**]-Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2197-6-4**] the heart rate is increased.
CXR [**8-13**]-IMPRESSION: Left mid to lower lung consolidation, worrisome for pneumonia.
CXR [**8-14**]- IMPRESSION: Progressive infrahilar left greater than right opacification could relate to either aspiration and/or infection, with superimposed component of atelectasis.
[**8-15**] CXR-FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the right and left basal and perihilar parenchymal opacities, likely to reflect pneumonia, are unchanged.
Head CT [**8-19**]-IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial lesions.
CT chest/neck-IMPRESSION: 1.
Either repeat imaging or correlation with bronchoscopy may yield further assessment.
Asymmetry in the region of the right false cords is better seen on the CT of the neck performed concurrently, and would be better assessed by direct visualization as indicated.
KUB [**8-20**]-FINDINGS: Contrast was injected over the newly placed J-tube.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old male who presents with hypoxia and tachycardia and was found to have presumed aspiration pneumonia and hyponatremia in the setting of stage II-III esophageal cancer receiving treatment with chemoradiation and recently admitted from [**2197-8-3**] to [**2197-8-8**] for cycle #4 cisplatin/5FU.
# Hypoxia: In the emergency department, the patient had O2 saturation in the low 80s and required supplemental oxygen with a face mask.
During the admission, a CT confirmed multilobar involvement of a likely infectious process.
Blood and sputum cultures were sent, although unfortunately sputum samples were not sufficient for testing.
Blood cultures did not reveal evidence of acute bacterial infection.
# Hypotension: On arrival to the ICU, the patient was hypotensive with BP 88/60.
His blood pressure responded well to hydration, and on transfer to the floor he had SBPs in the 110-120s.
# Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count was elevated to 26.6 on admission, most likely due to HCAP as above.
Repeat stool and urine studies were sent.
His white count rapidly dropped to normal while on IV antibiotics for the pneumonia, and continued therapy for his [**Name (NI) 29218**] persistent infection.
Urine electrolyte testing revealed a possible component of SIADH, probably secondary to his pulmonary disease.
Sodium levels should be monitored in the outpatient setting.
If sodium remains stable and pt needs increased free water, can increase to 200cc Q6hrs.
Sodium 131 on day of discharge.
He had a CT head on [**2197-5-13**] with no acute findings and PET imaging on [**2197-6-27**] without apparent intracranial findings, although this did not extend above the sinuses.
A head CT  was discussed with the treating oncologist.
A head CT with contrast was pursued while inpatient given his ongoing headaches, to preclude metastasis, which did not show evidence of metastasis.
This was discussed with outpatient oncologist [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5280**] [**8-19**], who agreed with CT scans to assess for metastasis.
CT scan showed redemonstration of a cervical esophageal mass posterior to the thyroid and endoluminal soft tissue attenuation in the proximal trachea at distal end of tracheal stent concerning for tumor and secretions.
Pt will have a PET scan and then follow up in clinic to go over the findings.
HCT was trended daily.
HCT remained stable and was >???
