Admission Date:  [**2109-12-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2110-1-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2036-3-16**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This a 73-year-old gentleman who was referred to the Urology Service after a workup for hematuria prompted a pelvic MRI on [**12-20**].
Findings on that study were significant for a large mass on the left side of the bladder consistent with a primary neoplasm extending into the muscle without definite evidence of extension into the pelvic-floor fat.
In the emergency department the patient was found to be in severe diabetic ketoacidosis with INR of 7; potassium of 7.5, blood glucose of 800 and hematocrit of 25.
The EKG done at that time was notable for peak T waves and a prolonged PR interval.
Chronic renal insufficiency (baseline CR 1.3 to 1.7).
Exploration of right arm for vein conduit.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed the following:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99.5, heart rate 95 sinus, blood pressure 99/31, respiratory rate 28, oxygen saturation 99% on two liters.
LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a white count of 28,000, hematocrit of 25.1, PT 32, PTT 91.4, and INR or 7.1, sodium 125, potassium 7.0, chloride 94, bicarbonate 16, BUN 112, creatinine of 4.1, and blood glucose of 795.
Urinalysis was notable for large amounts of blood, positive nitrites, greater than 100,000 glucose, 15 white blood cells, few bacteria.
He had a chest x-ray, which was notable for mild cardiomegaly, but without evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
The EKG was notable for prolonged PR interval and peaked T waves.
Cardiac enzymes were subsequently sent, which ultimately ruled him out for a myocardial infarction.
On [**2109-12-25**], the patient underwent a renal ultrasound, which was notable only for small cysts in the left kidney with no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
Both his blood and urine cultures had no growth.
His white count had dropped from 28,000 to 14,000 and his antibiotics were switched to Levaquin.
Continued workup included echocardiogram performed on [**12-26**], which demonstrated mild left ventricular hypertrophy, 2+ MR, 2+ TR and ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
On the 25th, he had a bone scan, which was notable for multiple bony metastases, as well as numerous small foci of increased uptake consistent with metastatic disease.
This study was ultimately done on [**2109-12-29**] and it was without any significant findings.
His blood glucoses, however, remained to be somewhat challenging; these were primarily managed by recommendations from the [**Last Name (un) **] Staff.
The rest of his vitals were stable and his oxygen saturations ranged from 94% to 98% on room air.
Blood glucose levels were under better control.
LABORATORY DATA:  Labs at the time of discharge revealed PT of a 15.7, PTT 88.8 and INR of 1.7.
White blood cell count of 12,600, hematocrit of 25.4, and platelet count 293,000.
