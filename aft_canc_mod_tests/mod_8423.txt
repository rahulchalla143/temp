STUDY: CT torso.
Evaluation requested.
TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast MDCT axial images were acquired of the lower chest and abdomen.
Approximately 130 cc of IV Optiray contrast was injected and axial images from the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis were acquired.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: An endotracheal tube is present within the lumen of the trachea.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a small amount of air present within the biliary system of the liver.
Further examination of these areas is recommended via ultrasound.
The pancreas, spleen, stomach, and adrenal glands appear within normal limits.
The abdominal portions of the large and small bowel are unremarkable.
There are no other pathologically enlarged by CT criteria identified mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is noted to be a significant amount of stool present within the rectum.
Two hypodense areas measuring 4.3 and 2.2 cm diameter within segments [**1-23**] of the liver concerning for either focal masses versus perfusion defects.
A CXR showed There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with slight tracheal deviation to the left.
Whe underwent a flexible bronchoscopy on [**10-2**] which confirmed the existence of an obstructing mass in the left upper lobe.
A CT scan on [**10-3**] showed a left upper and lower lobe consolidation/collapse.
Two hypodense areas measuring 4.3 and 2.2 cm diameter within segments [**1-23**] of the liver concerning for either focal masses versus perfusion defects.
She was taken to the OR with interventional pulmonology team and underwent a biopsy of 4L nodes, snare resection of left upper lobe mass.
