Upon transfer to O-Med on [**6-25**], her history is as follows: Her history is now most significant for neutropenia (white blood cells of 0.4 with an absolute neutrophil count of 320), methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection on intravenous vancomycin, and hyponatremia secondary to serum-inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.
An excisional biopsy was performed that revealed a 3 cm lesion consistent with both ductal and lobular cancer on pathology.
A wide resection revealed axillary lymph nodes on [**2192-4-7**], with 7/7 positive axillary lymph nodes.
An MRI showed metastases to the brain (the right posterior temporal lobe and right cerebellum and leptomeninges).
A lumbar puncture was done which showed equal opening pressures at the ventricle.
A head CT on [**5-22**] performed because the patient was somnolent as well as to assess changes in the patient's condition for possible chemotherapy, showed progression of hydrocephalus, but the fourth ventricle was not blocked and with equal opening pressures.
Sodium chloride 1 gram four times a day by mouth 5.
Bacitracin/polymixin ointment to the right eye  LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer to O-Med, white blood cells 0.4, hemoglobin 10.1, hematocrit 30.1, platelets 356.
Sodium 133, potassium 4.9, chloride 96, bicarbonate 25, BUN 25, creatinine 0.3, glucose 121.
Urinalysis on [**6-21**] was yellow and hazy with a specific gravity of 1.01 and a pH of 7.5.
It was positive for nitrite, small leukocyte esterase, [**6-11**] white blood cells, [**11-21**] red blood cells.
Micro on [**6-18**] blood cultures (two sets) had no growth.
[**6-21**] blood cultures (two sets) also had no growth.
[**6-21**] urine culture showed methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus greater than 100,000, gram-positive bacteria greater than 100,000, alpha hemolytic, consistent with strep or lactobacillus species.
[**6-24**] throat culture was negative for strep, and gynecologic culture was negative for N. gonorrhoeae.
CT head without contrast performed on [**2192-6-10**]: a.  Interval development of 5 mm wide water density subdural collection in the left frontoparietal region with associated effacement of the sulci without shift of midline structures.
Chest x-ray performed on [**2192-6-12**]:  No evidence of congestive heart failure, pneumonia, or pleural effusion.
Ultrasound Doppler of the upper extremities performed because of an arm swelling with a right-sided PICC line showed no evidence of a deep venous thrombosis.
CT angio performed on [**2192-6-12**]: a.  Bibasilar atelectasis b.
MRI of the head performed on [**2192-6-13**] showed: a.  Left-sided ventricular shunt in position with partial decompression of the left lateral ventricle b.
New left-sided subdural fluid collection which was not present on the prior examination and could be related to recent shunting c.  Diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement along the cerebellar folia and vermis in addition to intra-axial enhancement within the right cerebellar hemisphere and the right inferior temporal lobe.
Further clinical correlation and follow up is recommended.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Her hyponatremia was treated with intravenous fluid restriction (at most, 50 cc of normal saline when the tube feeds are not on) and salt tabs, as well as lasix elixir.
Pulmonary:  This was stable until [**7-6**], when she desaturated to 88%, new crackles were heard on examination, she had a temperature of 100.4 while on Tylenol, and a chest x-ray revealed some ill-defined patchy opacities consistent with an early pulmonary infection in the left middle lobe to left lower lobe as well as some right middle lobe atelectasis.
Procrit weekly was begun for her anemia on [**6-29**], and she got a transfusion on [**7-3**].
Restaging MRIs of the head and spine as well as a bone scan are planned for either Monday, [**7-9**], or Tuesday, [**7-10**], in order to assess the direction of any further treatment in this patient.
Infectious Disease:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] finished a ten day course of vancomycin for the methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection, and subsequent urinalysis and cultures have revealed only [**Known lastname 23087**].
A full Infectious Disease workup was done at that time as well, and blood and urine cultures were negative.
Of note, blood cultures have always been negative during this admission.
