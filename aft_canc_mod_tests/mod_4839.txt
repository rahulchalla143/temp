[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4041**] tissue valve, reference number [**Serial Number 13649**], serial number [**Serial Number 85845**].
He  went to the  ED, where they noted deepened lateral ST depressions, positive enzymes(0.37) and a hematocrit of 18. stopcock, 3 bags of fluid.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.6, BP 117/63, HR 88, RR 20, O2 97% 2L.
CXR showed possible pneumonia.
Bedside echo did not show pericardial effusion.
Labs were notable for hematocrit of19.9, plt 270, wbc 7, inr 3.2, k 4.3, cr 1.6, trop 0.22, bnp 3100, lactate 0.9.
He received lasix 40mg iv x1, ceftriaxone 1gm iv x1, azithro 500mg iv x1, and 2units pRBC.
NECK: Supple with JVP of [**11-29**] cm.
PULSES: Pulsus of 8mm hg Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: TTE [**2109-2-11**]: Conclusions Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF <30 %).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-2-9**], the findings are similar.

He underwent cardiac catheterization revealing a LAD 90% recannalized occlusion in the proximal vessel and RCA disease.
Transfusion was performed to raise the hematocrit to acceptable levels.
His baseline creatinine of was 0.5, on admission here the creatinine was 1.6.
His target INR is 2.0-2.5.
