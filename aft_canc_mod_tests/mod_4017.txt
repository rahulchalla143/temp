COMPARISON: Non-contrast CT from a PET study of [**2142-1-25**], chest x-ray from [**2142-2-19**].
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning was performed of the chest before and after the administration of 100 cc of Optiray intravenous contrast.
CT OF THE CHEST: Bilateral hilar as well as mediastinal adenopathy is seen.
Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are identified of simple fluid attenuation, which were not present on the [**1-25**] study.
In the visualized abdomen again seen are multiple low-attenuation masses within the liver, which appear to be increased in size and extent since the prior study of [**1-25**].
This has developed since the prior CT of [**1-25**] and is worsened since the recent chest x-ray.
Please also refer to the official report of chest radiograph obtained on the same day.
Bacteremia was revealed by blood cultures.
Last blood cultured showed Gram positive cocci.
Creatinine remained at 1.4-1.6. .
