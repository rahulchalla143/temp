She has noticed her hemorrhoids more recently, in the sense that when she uses the bathroom, she can feel them popping out from her sphincter, and finds blood on the toilet paper when she wipes.
Labs were notable for an HCT of 24.5 with an MCV of 122, Plt of 109, AP of 204, t-bili of 3, AST of 62, ALT of 18, amylase of 219, lipase of 123, INR of 1.7 and negative serum/urine tox screens.
A CT of her abdomen/pelvis with contrast was notable for a thickened colonic wall consistent with colitis and a moderate amount of free fluid in the pelvis/paracolic gutters.
VS on transfer were: T 98.4, BP 118/86, RR 17, O2 sat 100% RA.
On arrival to the ICU her initial VS were: T98, Hr99, BP129/88, RR20, Sat 100% (RA).

Abdominal exam notable for significantly diminished distension after U/S guided paracentesis.

ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):  ============== OTHER STUDIES ============== ECG [**2123-8-21**]: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2112-8-9**] the QRS voltage has decreased and there is poor R wave progression.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis W/ Contrast [**2123-8-21**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
1) Portal hypertension complicated by ascites due to acute or chronic hepatitis:  Pt presented with thromobocytopenia, increased transaminases with AST>ALT, elevated bilirubin, and elevated INR that did not normalize with vitamin K.  She also had ascites that was eventually revealed to have a SAAG of 1.3 suggestive of being due to portal hypertension.
2) Hematochezia: On presentation patient had bright red blood per rectum with major concern being for a hemorrhoidal bleed vs diverticular bleed vs bleeding from colitis (as CT seemed to suggest inflammation).
The patient's Hct on presentation was 24.5 and increased to around 30 after transfusion of one unit with stability thereafter.
To complete work up should get a capsule endoscopy to evaluate for small bowel AVMs.
ED CT scan concerning for colitis so she was started on cipro/metronidazole though never febrile here.
SBP was also entertained as a source of fever but by time of paracentesis (deferred due to bedside procedure being technically infeasible and the deferred for endoscopies) she had received four days of antibiotics.
Hct on presentation at 24.5 likely reflects baseline anemia with component of GI bleeding.
TSH 33 suggestive of very poor adherence.
Transitional Issues: -Pt will follow up with PCP to assess for signs of dehydration, tolerance of daily furosemide regime -Pt will follow up with PCP and liver to assess resolution of ascites -Pt will follow up with liver to discuss further work up of liver disease, trend labs, and discuss need for biopsy -Pt will follow up with PCP to recheck anemia and trend as well as platelet count -Final ascites culture results and serum ceruloplasmin pending at time of discharge.
