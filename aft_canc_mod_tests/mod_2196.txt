More recent studies are not available.
TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained in the arterial phase of intravenous contrast administration.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
At this level, it measures 4.3 x 5.4 cm in axial dimensions (series 8, image 86) compared to 3.7 x 3.2 cm previously.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is contrast in the gallbladder, probably from a recent CT.
Although there is motion artifact limiting evaluation of the upper abdomen, the pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands appear normal.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter in the bladder, and a large right diverticulum, which could be due to prior obstruction.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.
BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM:  Exam was limited to prone and supine evaluation of the distal esophagus given limited patient mobility and blood pressure lability.
Mucosal abnormalities were difficult to assess given limitations of the study and lack of double contrast.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.
CT scanning repeated as well as esophageal evaluation done.
