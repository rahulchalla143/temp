A workup for this included a CAT scan of the abdomen and an incidental finding was evident.

Immmunohistochemical work-up to demonstrate involvement by the patient's known chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma is in progress and will be reported in an addendum to be released by Hematopathology.
Peritoneal nodule, biopsy (M): Dissecting mucin within fibroadipose tissue with reactive mesothelial lining consistent with implant from low grade appendiceal mucinous tumor.
Studies of patients with such tumors were associated with 5 and 10-year survival rates of 86 and 45%, respectively (Misdraji et [**Doctor Last Name **], American Journal of Surgical Pathology, [**2140**]).
By immunohistochemical stains, the infiltrate is diffusely immunoreactive for pan-B-cell marker, CD20, with aberrant co-expression of CD5.
DRC (CD21) highlights rare scattered residual follicular dendritic reticular meshwork.
The overall findings are consistent with involvement by a low-grade B-cell lymphoma, CD5-positive.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint, he had several episodes of sinus tachycardia postoperatively; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Chest x-ray demonstrated right lund opacification which correlates with large scale aspiration.
Abdominal x-ray revealed small bowel obstruction.
On POD # 10, patient's abdomen was found to be distended and abdominal CT scan was obtained.
CT demonstrated sigmoid colon perforation with intraabdominal abscess.
Patient was started on IV Flagyl and Cipro, IR placed [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter to drain abscess, cultures were sent for microbiology.
On POD # 15, repeat abdominal CT demonstrated decrease size of intraabdominal abscess and no contrast leak.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Staples were removed prior discharge and steri strips were applied.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; no transfusions were required.
