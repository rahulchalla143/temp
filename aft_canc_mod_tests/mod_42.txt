Taking into account the recent chest x-ray that did not demonstrate evidence of malignancy, this is concerning for metastasis from a renal cell carcinoma and abdominal CT is recommended for further evaluation.
CHEST CT: 1.
Bony destruction of T9 and T10 vertebrae with tumor extension into the bony spinal canal.
2) HUMERUS FRACTURE:  AS this represented likely pathologic fracture, a needle biopsy was done.
The pathology from humerus revealed likely metastatic lung carcinoma.
