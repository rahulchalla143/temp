TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired.
Following gadolinium, T1 sagittal, axial and coronal images were obtained.
In addition, MP-RAGE axial images were obtained following gadolinium for CyberKnife planning.
FINDINGS: The diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
Since the previous study of [**2127-6-12**], the patient has undergone left-sided craniotomy.
Postoperative changes since the previous MRI of [**2127-6-12**].

Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain.
Comparison to a head CT of [**2127-6-6**] and MR examinations of [**6-10**] and 24.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2127-6-6**] no significant change.

UPPER EXTREMITY R/O METS  RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA: 25.2 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m MDP ([**2127-6-11**]); HISTORY: Metastatic cancer.
In the CT ([**2127-6-6**]) this corresponds to a healing fracture with a prominent soft tissue component.
However, the linear appearance on the bone scan and the soft tissue component seen on CT are suggestive of a pathologic fracture secondary to osseous metastasis.
