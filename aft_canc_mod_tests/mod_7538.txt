Admission Date:  [**2127-5-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-5-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-4-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ace Inhibitors / Nsaids  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**] Chief Complaint:  ST-elevations on EKG, concern for STEMI at OSH  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catherization   History of Present Illness: 77 y/o woman with a PMhx of metastatic lung cancer with mets to bone & h/o malignant pleural effusion, who is transferred from [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital for cardiac catheterization after she was found to have ST-elevations in V2-6, I and aVL.
Her Hct also dropped from low 30s to 26, for which she reportedly received PRBCs (per dtr).
EKG showed new ST elevations ~2mm in V2-6, I and aVL.
She was sent for a CTA, which was negative PE, though study was slightly limited by motion.
(CTA did, however, show large R pleural effusion, which is old and has been malignant on prior taps.
CK was 96, MB 13, Trop 0.45, INR 1.1, Hct 31.
Discussion w/ cardiology at OSH was had & decision made to transfer pt for cardiac cath b/c of concern for STEMI.
Notably, her LV-gram showed severe anterolateral, apical, and inferoapical hypokinesis w/ LVEF 20%.
TRANSFER MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 2.5mg IV at 2pm Cipro 200mg IV BID Colchicine 0.6mg daily Colace 100mg [**Hospital1 **] Lovenox 40mg daily-last dose 6pm [**5-6**] Iron 300mg TID Folic acid 1mg daily Lopressor 25mg tid-Last po dose was at 8am, Multivitamin Prilosec Oxycontin 20mg [**Hospital1 **] Senna [**Hospital1 **] Resteril qhs ASA 325mg 12noon Plavix 300mg   Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VS - 96.8, 88, 136/72, 21, 100% on RA; 1L of UOP p 20mg IV lasix given in cath lab Gen: slightly anxious elderly woman.
Pulses: Right: DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: OSH CXR: large right pleural effusion and atelectasis, mass right upper lobe .
CT scan of chest [**5-7**]: large right side pleural effusion, mass like consolidation in right upper lobe and portion of right mid lobe.
EKG demonstrated sinus tach, ~2mm STE in V2-6, I and aVL w/ biphasic TW I & avL.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2127-5-6**] demonstrated: 50% LMCA lesion     RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2127-5-9**] 8:56 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: Please eval for SDH or e/o mets.
COMPARISON: No prior exam is available for comparison.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial imaging was performed through the brain without administration of IV contrast.
CT HEAD: Hypodensity involving right posterior frontal subcortical white matter along the superior convexity is noted; while this may represent old ischemic change, no prior imaging is available to establish stability and this may represent edema surrounding a metastatic lesion in this patient with known stage IV lung cancer.
Mild prominence of the ventricles and extra- axial CSF spaces is consistent with age-related involutional change.
If no prior study is available to establish stability, MR would be recommended for further evaluation.
Cardiomyopathy: 77yo woman with progressive stage IV NSCLC, h/o CVA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and recent R hip fx s/p replacement & ORIF who was noted to be in sinus tach at OSH, EKG showed STE, and cardiac cath was done on arrival which was notable for absence of significant CAD and presence of hypokinesis of anterolat/apex/inferoapex with severely depressed cardiac index, concerning for Takotsubo CMP.
Her medications were titrated as her BP and HR tolerated for optimzal management of her cardiomyopathy.
An ECHO was not done during her hospitilization as her EF was assessed at cath and her general goals of care were addressed given her late stage Lung Cancer.
A CT head was done which showed no hemorrage or acute event, but did show ?
THe pt will f/u with her oncologist for further assessment and f/u of this finding.
A CXR showed loculated effusion.
TRANSFER MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 2.5mg IV at 2pm Cipro 200mg IV BID Colchicine 0.6mg daily Colace 100mg [**Hospital1 **] Lovenox 40mg daily-last dose 6pm [**5-6**] Iron 300mg TID Folic acid 1mg daily Lopressor 25mg tid-Last po dose was at 8am, Multivitamin Prilosec Oxycontin 20mg [**Hospital1 **] Senna [**Hospital1 **] Resteril qhs ASA 325mg 12noon Plavix 300mg   Discharge Medications: 1.
