TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.
Correlation was made with the MRI of [**2122-5-1**].
His post-operative MRI was revealed complete evacuation of the previously seen hypo-intense material.
His neurologic exam post-operatively was significantly improved relative to the pre-operative exam, though his LUE strength was still not full (5-).
