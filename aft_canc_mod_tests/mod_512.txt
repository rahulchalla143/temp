[**2196-11-22**] Chest X-ray: AP AND LATERAL CHEST: Extensive pleural thickening, volume loss, and rightward mediastinal shift is again identified.
While, these findings are in keeping with the report from the [**2188-4-9**] chest radiograph, that study noted "shift of the superior mediastinum" whereas we are seeing complete mediastinal shift today.
Calcification of mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes is identified, as is a 5 mm calcified pulmonary nodule at the left lung base.
[**2196-11-22**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: Final Report FINDINGS: Volume loss at the right lung base is partially observed with scattered pleural calcifications noted.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The rectum and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable with a Foley catheter present within the bladder.
Compression deformities of T12 and L2 are of unclear acuity.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The patient's blood cultures were negative, she remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
She had a head CT with no evidence of bleeding, had no clear signs of infection such as UTI or pneumonia and no metabolic cause of delerium.
Her TSH was checked and she was slightly hypothyroid but with a normal TSH.
LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA: Due to worsening LE edema, she had an transthoracic echocardiogram which showed some signs of diastoic dysfunction but normal ejection fraction.
NUTRITION: The patient was depleted nutritionally on arrival with an albumin of 2.3.
Her electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium and phosphorous were low on admission.
IV fluids, electrolyte repletion, medications and vital sign checks were stopped.
