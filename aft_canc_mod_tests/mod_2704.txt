EGD/colonoscopy on [**2109-10-22**] with gastric biopsy and polypectomy.
Her blood pressure dropped to 71/41 with pulse in the 50s.
Once she became bradycardic to the 30s with SBP in 60s, she was intubated and given calcium.
She was given epinephrine to maximally support BP and one amp of atropine for continued bradycardia.
A CXR revealed a left retrocardiac opacity.

Microbiology data: Blood cultures - no growth [**12-24**] sets Urine - E coli, Levofloxacin sensitive Sputum - E coli, Levofloxacin sensitive  Brief Hospital Course: 1.
CXR showed left retrocardiac opacity.
Sputum and urine grew E coli that was Levofloxacin sensitive.
Blood cultures had no growth.
Prior to discharge, she was satting >93% on room air and has been afebrile without leukocytosis for several day.
Would recommend checking Ua and culture after 10-day course of Abx is completed to ensure that UTI has cleared.
ARF: Pt presented with creatinine of 1.9, elevated from baseline.
FENa calculated from urine electrolytes on [**2109-10-16**] was 24%, suggesting intrarenal process.
Patient's renal failure has resolved and Cr was 0.5 prior to discharge.
Coagulation studies have normalized prior to discharge.
When her blood pressure has stabilized she was started on lopressor 25 mg po qd.
While the possibility that a fib was in the setting of cardiogenic shock/synmpathetic overdrive, it was felt that anticoagulation is warranted.
The patient should be anticoagulated with warfarin (goal INR [**12-25**]) starting 7 days post her colonoscopy/EGD which were done on [**2109-10-22**].
Anemia, unclear etiology: Hct 31 on admission dropped precipitously to 25-26 and nas remained stable at that level.
Iron studies were consistent with ACD but appears that these were drawn after blood transfusion and may not be reliable.
Please start anticoagulating the patient with warfarin with heparin bridging on [**2109-10-28**] (weeks after EGD and colonoscopy with biopsies/polypectomy) for atrial fibrillation.
Goal INR [**12-25**].
