When discharged from the hospital, pain was well-controlled on oxycodone and acetominophen, he was tolerating a regular diet, and vital signs were stable.
Pain was accompanied by nausea without vomiting, febrile symptoms with temperature to 100, and dizziness.
Past Medical History: hepatocellular carcinoma, s/p right hepatectomy [**2138-11-7**], hepatitis B, benign prostatic hypertrophy, elevated PSA, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP, appendectomy  Social History: He is married with 2 children.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 99.9, HR 116, BP 82/52, RR 16, SpO2 100% 4L NC.
gen: in distress due to pain, moaning HEENT: sclera icteric, EOMI, mucous membranes dry cardiac: RRR chest: CTAB abd: +BS, mildly distended, diffusely tender to light palpation with guarding throughout, maximal in LUQ, no rebound; incision C/D/I with steri-strips and sutures; no current fluid drainage from incision ext: warm, well-perfused, 2+ pitting edema   Pertinent Results: [**2138-11-25**] CT abd/pelvis: 1.
Technically successful ultrasound-guided aspiration of 650 cc of cloudy [**Location (un) 2452**]-yellow fluid from a perihepatic collection and placement of an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] drainage catheter.
Blood in the stomach.
Blood in the second part of the duodenum, possibly from the ampulla.
Successful coil and Gelfoam embolization of active extravasation noted from a branch of the gastroduodenal artery.
Blood in the stomach.Blood in the duodenum.
A large diverticulum was seen at the level of the ampulla.
[**2138-12-12**] CT abd/pelvis: 1.
Retention of renal contrast within cortex of bilateral kidneys concerning for ATN.
At this time WBC was 21.1, Tbili was 11.0, lactate was 10.2, and creatinine was 2.8.
Patient underwent ultrasound-guided drain placement with drainage of 650 cc of peritoneal fluid, which revealed [**Numeric Identifier 87932**] WBCs and rare ESBL E Coli, consistent with secondary peritonitis.
He was transferred to the SICU and blood pressure was stabilized by 1.5 L fluid boluses.
On [**11-30**], platelets were 46 from 61 on [**11-29**] and 66 on [**11-28**].
Consequently, a HIT panel was sent and Zosyn was changed to Meropenem due to its association with thrombocytopenia.
The HIT antibody was positive, pending serotonin release assay results, and [**Location (un) 2274**] Hematology was consulted, who recommended initiation of bivalrudin given association of HIT with thrombotic events.
INR was 2.7 on [**12-3**] and 2.2 on [**12-4**], on which patient also received 2.5 mg warfarin.
INR was measured at 7.7 and rechecked at 10.5 and 9.4, and anticoagulation was held.
Serotonin release assay returned negative for HIT.
Patient complained of diffuse abdominal pain, but hematocrit was stable at 30-32 and patient was hemodynamically stable.
2u FFP were given with a decrease in INR to 2.5 and vitamin K was administered.
INR was 10.5 and HCT declined to 24.5.
By [**12-7**] melanotic stools stopped and patient was hemodynamically stable and patient was transferred to the floor overnight.
The morning of [**12-8**] melena resumed, with a drop in HCT from 35 to 30 to 21.2 with INR 2.4.
Endoscopy by hepatology revealed a normal esophagus and stomach, but blood in the 2nd portion of the duodenum.
He was hemodynamically stable after the procedure with HCT of 33.
Repeat EGD, on [**12-12**] showed ulcerated duodenum with diffuse oozing but no hemobilia.
On [**12-13**] patient had a repeat massive UGIB, which responded to blood products.
His Inr normalized to 1.
We did not think he would survive an exp laparotomy and based on imaging the bleeding would not be manageable surgically.
