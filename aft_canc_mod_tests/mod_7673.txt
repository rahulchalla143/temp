On review of systems, he does note a weight loss of 25 pounds over the past year - he was trying to lose weight but feels that he lost too much.
NG lavage was positive for blood which didn't clear.
His hematocrit was found to be 18, down from 44 on [**3-16**].
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 72 y/o M w/hyperlipidemia, who presented with melena, fatigue, and Hct 18.
# GI bleed:  Pt was admitted to the MICU for BP/HCT monitoring overnight while awaiting EGD by GI.
A biopsy was not sent given the concern for bleeding.
He was given 3 units of pRBCs and his hct remained stable without further evidence of gross bleeding.
Subsequent CT scan of torso on [**2119-3-26**] revealed a large 7cm mass involving head/tail of pancreas, invading the posterior portion of the stomach and encasing the splenic artery.
GI recommended an IR guided biopsy of liver/lung masses to determine staging of presumed pancreatic cancer.
At this point, the patient was called out to the floor since his hematocrit was stable.
While on the floor, he was followed by GI who decided to attemped an EUS-guided biopsy of the gastric lesion, since biopsy of the liver and lung lesions was not possible.
However, the EUS scope could not be passed down the oropharynx, so the biopsy was then deferred again to IR.
As a result, a repeat EUS-guided biopsy was attempted and was successful, with FNA of the gastric mass.
This mass was eventually biopsied and the results of this biopsy are currently pending.
A follow-up appointment has been scheduled for you (see below) to go over the results of this biopsy and then determine what needs to be done next for your continued treatment and care.
