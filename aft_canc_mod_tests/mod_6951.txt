On [**2159-10-22**], patient presented s/p fall and was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation in the setting of acute stress induced cardiomyopathy with an EF of 25-30% and bilateral pleural effusions.
A repeat TTE at the time of discharge did not demonstrate reaccumulation of her effusion, which was thought to be secondary to her dasatinib.
Of note, following her fall, OSH CT was suggestive of SAH/SDH, and brain MRI demonstrated findings consistent with PRES vs. evolving infarcts, for which she has been followed by neurology as an outpatient.

The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-11-9**], the pericardial effusion is now moderate with signs of early tamponade physiology.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Cardiac Cath report [**2159-12-21**] COMMENTS: 1.
This was performed to maintain arterio-venous access to deal with any complications during the procedure, and also for hemodynamic monitoring during the procedure.
Final echo images showed near complete resolution of the effusion.
ECHO [**2159-12-22**] This study was compared to the prior study of [**2159-12-22**].
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Effusion echo dense, c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-12-22**], findings are similar.
CXR [**2159-12-22**] AP radiograph of the chest was compared to [**2159-12-20**].
Pt will follow up with cardiology for repeat echo in roughly 2 weeks and also follow up with her oncologist.
Pt underwent cardiac cath with balloon pericardiotomy [**2159-12-21**].
Gram stain of pericardial fluid was unrevealing and cultures showed no growth.
Drain was pulled on [**2159-12-22**] without issues after repeat TTE showed no further reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.
# leukocytosis - on [**2159-12-22**] pt had WBC of 15.
UA showed pyuria but no bacteria, and culture was without growth.
Blood cultures also showed no growth.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: would suggest rheumatologic workup for investigation of etiology of recurrent pericardial effusions.
