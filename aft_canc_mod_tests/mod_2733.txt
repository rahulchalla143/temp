PE could not be ruled out with a CT chest as patient had elevated Cr (1.9) so he was started on a heparin drip.

CXR found evidence of pulmonary congestion.
[**Age over 90 **] showed an LEVF of >55%, unchanged from prior.
To evaluate for PE, he underwent LENIs and [**Age over 90 **], both of which were negative.
After transfer to the floor, the patient had an episode of hypertension, tachycardia and flash pulmonary edema and required IV lasix and his diltiazem was increased for further rate control and blood pressure control.
His diltiazem was restarted and titrated to achieve a heart rate of <100, as discussed below.
His HR remained stable in the 70-100s on this regimen.
#Clostridium difficile colitis: Patient had loose watery stools this admission and C. diff PCR was positive.
His blood pressure was well controlled on diltizazem and Lasix at discharge.
His kidney function was monitored during diuresis, and he required repletion of potassium and phosphate.
# Diabetes mellitus: Initially had blood glucose 500 at rehab facility.
He received 20units total on the day of admission, which decreased his blood sugar to the 200s.
At discharge, he was restarted on glipizide 2.5mg PO daily, with instructions for his family members to check his glucose before breakfast and after dinner daily until visiting his PCP.
#Transitions of care: - will need further titration of his diltiazem for rate control - continue to discuss the indication for anticoagulation givenhis atrial fibrillation - will continue a 14 day course of Flagyl as an outpatient - follow up on [**Hospital1 **] finger stick blood sugars and titrate oral hypoglycemics for further diabetes management - follow up on thyroid mass with possible biopsy, if within goals of care  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

While you were here, we performed tests that suggest that your heart failure was worsened by a fast heart rate.
We restarted you on your home diltiazem to get better control of your heart rate, and we gave you medications to control your blood pressure and remove the fluid from your lungs.
