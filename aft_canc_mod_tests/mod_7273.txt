She developed tachycardia and dyspnea/hypoxia during a CTA chest to rule out PE, so was transferred to the ICU from the radiology suite.
CTA was negative for PE.
BNP 1459.
Echo showing new RV dilatation, but normal EF.
Weight returned back to baseline.
- SHE WILL NEED A REPEAT ECHO IN ONE MONTH.
TTE negative for endocarditis, but did show new RV dilatation (see above).
Repeat U/A still showing WBCs, but now symptoms, so no change in antibiotics.
- F/U SURVEILLANCE CULTURES AND PORT TIP CULTURE.
- Plan for surveillance cultures to be drawn through the PICC after antibiotics are completed.
Skin biopsy was consistent with a chemotherapy reaction.
Wound culture grew MSSA.
# Genital herpes: She had DFA of vaginal lesions that revealed herpes simplex virus 2.
# LFT abnormalities: History of fatty liver, diagnosed by liver biopsy 2/[**2130**].
Acetaminophen 325-650 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain 6.

During a CT scan, your vital signs and symptoms worsened.
Blood and skin cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, a bacteria known to stick to different parts of the body.
An echo of the heart on the skin surface and one internally (TEE) were both negative for infections of the heart valves, but did show a mild dilation of the right ventricle heart chamber.
They did recommend changing your blood pressure medicine to metoprolol and repeating an echo in one month.
Your breathing and oxygen levels improved with furosemide (Lasix), a diuretic.
YOUR DOCTORS NEED TO ARRANGE A REPEAT ECHO IN ONE MONTH.
