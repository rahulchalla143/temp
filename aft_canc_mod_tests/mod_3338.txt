Admission Date:  [**2168-8-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-11-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-10-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vancomycin / Compazine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: MEC chemotherapy followed by syngeneic transplant  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: hickman placed [**8-10**] intubation intra-aortic balloon pump  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 39 year old woman diagnosed with AML in [**2166-11-11**] after presenting for a routine physical exam, CBC revealed white count of 5300 with 40% blasts.
Patient underwent induction 7+3; 5+2 in [**Month (only) 404**] of [**2166**], followed by three cycles of consolidation after which she had a bone marrow biopsy with remission in early [**2166**].
Patient remained in remission until [**3-31**] at which time she was found to have relapsed by bone marrow biopsy and underwent reinduction 7+3/5+2(idarubicin and cytarabine).
She was admitted for a week in [**Month (only) 205**] for neutropenic fevers, hickman was pulled, and patient was treated with Daptomycin.
Last bone marrow biopsy on [**7-27**] shows relapsed AML, CD34/CD13 with 26% blast cells.
CMV viral load on [**7-27**] was + at 36. .
She reports feeling tired most of the time, but her appetite and weight have been stable (she initially lost 5-10lbs after chemo).
(b)  positive CD34; positive CD13, and positive CD17.

The appearance of the gallbladder is not significantly changed compared to the exam of seven days prior.
If there is continued clinical concern for acalculous cholecystitis, HIDA scan may be performed for further evaluation.
Course was c/b intermittent episodes of hypotension (below baseline hypotension of SBP 80's - 100's) and lightheadedness.
On [**11-7**], patient diuresed well on lasix with a slight elevation in creatinine to 1.6, but a new anion gap was noted with a lactate of 7.
A venous blood gas showed a pH of 7.14 and venous lactate of 13.
At the time, patient's INR was 4 and her respiratory and hemodynamic status very tenous.
As mentioned above, [**Hospital 228**] hospital course also complicated by strep viridans endocarditis with visible vegetations seen on most recent ECHO [**2168-10-19**].
She had positive PPD 12 years ago and was treated for six months - pt can't remember which drug.
Patient's chest x-ray was negative, no active symptoms now or during previous chemotherapy.
EGD was unremarkable (some linear gastritis only), and not able to account for the patient's symptoms.
A CT w/ contrast on [**10-24**] revealed contracted portal vein thrombosis, cecal wall thickening, possibly secondary to ascites and a question of free air, which was further discussed with radiology and determined to be most likely in the appendix.
Repeated EKGs showed no ST changes.
Cardiac enzymes were significant for troponin of 0.05 x 3, which was stable and not trending up, ck-MB was negative.
Repeat Echo also showed worsening EF with global hypokinesis.
Patient had periodic echocardiograms done showing progressively worse systolic right and left sided function.
An echo on [**9-27**], done to evaluate interval changes prior to surgery for suspected cholecystitis, showed worsened EF<20% and new vegetations on the tricuspid valve and the chordae to the tricuspid valve.
Her cardiac enzymes were cycled once with negative CK, and CKMB, and stable troponins.
Her chest pain was thought to be secondary to anxiety, often resolving with ativan, and sinus tachycardia, and was treated with morphine and attempts at better rate control.
Patient's blood pressure with diuresis was marginal and cardiology consult initially did not believe there was room to add ACE-inhibitor, neither did they believe that she would benefit from afterload reduction.
Echos demonstrated EF<20% on multiple occasions.
On the floor, a CXR showed continued failure, which was confirmed by a CT with contrast on [**10-24**].
She was actively diuresed with lasix 40 mg PO QD to 114 lbs, with a consequent increase in her serum Cr from 0.8 to 1.4.
A repeat CXR on [**10-31**] showed marked improvement of her asymetric pulmonary edema, though on exam, she continued to have [**11-29**]+ LE edema L>R and ascites.
Her digoxin was titrated to try to improve her rate control and was set at alternating doses of 0.1875 and 0.25 with a resting HR in the 120-130s.
She was subsequently transferred to cardiology ([**Hospital Unit Name 196**]) for further cardiac management on [**2168-11-1**].
Patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit for further monitoring and treatment.
However, repeat ECHO showed persistent vegetations and TR.
Patient also required vasopressin and levophed to maintain her blood pressure.
Her heart rate stayed in the 120's-160's and was also addressed on her transfer to the cardiology service.
It was believed that her sinus tachycardia was likely compensatory for her poor ejection fraction with her CHF.
A trial of carvedilol and acebutelol was attempted prior to transfer to cardiology, but was not tolerated due to hypotension.
On cardiology service a trial of 1mg IV lopressor was attempted with the thought that if her blood pressure tolerated this and her heart rate decreased an oral trial of lopressor could be attempted.
However, with the 1 mg IV lopressore, patient's heart rate dropped into 80-90's and her systolic blood pressure dropped to 50's-60's.
She may need evaluation for ICD placement, as this may be related to her cardiomyopathy.
On [**11-14**], heart rate was in the 140's and was hypotensive with systolic in the 60's and MAP in 50's.
However, a repeat echo showed unchanged size of the vegetatations, and a diagnosis of marantic endocarditis was suspected.
A subsequent echo showed worsening TR without note of the vegetation on the echo dated [**10-19**].
Follow up blood cultures and ECHO should be done at that time to ensure bacteremia and tricuspid vegetations have resolved.

Repeat lactates continued to rise, and on [**11-10**], patient was noted to have a lactate of 13.9 and an anion gap of 25.
During this time, patient was persistently hypotensive with SBP in 60's.
Her transaminases were elevated to the 200s, but the bilirubin was normal.
Her transaminases continued to rise above 1000, and a repeat abdominal U/S and CT scan were done, showing a new partial portal vein thrombus.
Her transaminases then trended downward and the patient left the MICU w/ unremarkable transaminases.
The patient accidentally partially removed the cholecystostomy drain, her labs remained stable as did the abdominal pain for the next few days and the drain tube was discontinued.
Repeat u/s showed consistently decompressed gall bladder.
A repeat u/s showed persistent thrombus.
Multiple HIT Ab tests were negative and a serotoninin assay that was reported to be more sensitive for HIT was negative.
A CT on [**10-24**] showed a contracted portal vein thrombosis.
A RUQ ultrasound on [**2168-11-6**] demonstrated resolution of her portal vein thrombosis.
An US obtained while the pt was in the MICU revealed no clot and was believed to be related to anasarca.
She received 6 units of FFP and 1 bag of cryo and serial DIC labs were followed, with improvement over the time she was in the MICU.
It was felt that the endocarditis or sepsis were the most likely etiologies, although initial blood cultures did not grow any organisms.
Her DIC resolved, but this was postulated as a possible unifying diagnosis to explain the portal vein thrombosis.
Pt stool was C. Diff negative x 3.
#pump: nonischemic cardiomyopathy/CHF: EF ~10%, likely secondary to chemo toxicity vs [**12-30**] persistant tachycardia.
Repeat ECHO show persistent vegetations on TR.
12/19 HR 140's hypotensive syst 60's MAP 50's required 100J [**First Name3 (LF) **] to stable atrial tach.

Hepatology consulted, believe elevated LFTs [**12-30**] hepatic congestion from R heart failure.
Thrombocytopenia/DIC: Noted earlier in hospital admission of unknown etiology - all HIT ab's negative x multiple times inlcuding more sensitive HIT test (serotonin assay).
FEN: Holding additional fluids and concentrating fluids given anasarca - cont TF as tolerated - electrolyte repletion - cont anti-emetics .
