An abdominal ultrasound on [**2-5**] showed a large cystic mass within the abdomen.
This was confirmed with a CT scan of the abdomen obtained on [**2-8**].
The imaging findings and her history were not consistent with hydatid cyst disease.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**] did not feel that further imaging or a preoperative biopsy would be helpful in the management of this lesion and so advised up- front surgery as well as an intraoperative frozen section biopsy of the mass.
Status post a liver biopsy by needle for a small cyst approximately six years ago.
