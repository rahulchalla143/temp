LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The maximum gradient through the mitral valve was 16 mmHg with a mean gradient of 7 mmHg at a cardiac output around 3.5 liters/minute.
The maximum gradient through the aortic valve was 16 mmHg with a mean gradient of 8 mmHg at a cardiac ouput of 3.5 liters/minute.
An echo showed aortic stenosis and she was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
Her catheterization revealed 3 vessel coronary disease.
After the usual preoperative workup the patient was brought to the operating room on [**2164-10-22**].
Her bypass time was 160 minutes with a crossclamp time of 136 minutes.
On POD2 her lactate rose from 1.2 to 2.1 and general surgery was consulted.
She was very deconditioned and her activity was minimal in this initial period, she failed a swallow evaluation and a feeding tube was placed.
Once on the floor she was started on some oral nutrition and appeared to have aspirated, with a leukocytosis and chest XRay the revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate.
