Labs remarkable for INR 6.8 (was 5.2 yesterday, Coumadin held last night).
Given elevated INR, transfusion of FFP as initiated, with subsequent increasing oxygen requirement and eventual sat 91 % on NRB.
She was placed on BiPAP 5/5 with FiO2 0.1, with sat 95%.
Review of labs indicates supratherapeutic INR on multiple occasions.
Latest catheterization in [**10-21**] with 2-vessel disease.
HIV, last CD4 count 940 in [**7-/2115**] 4.

PORTABLE AP CHEST AT 1610: Comparison is made to the study from six hours earlier.
Configuration of the chest suggests [**Month/Day/Year 2182**].
EKG on admission: Rate 96 [**Doctor First Name **], regular.
Q in III (old), non-specific ST changes in anterior leads (old versus [**2115-7-24**]) EKG on discharge: Sinus rhythm Lateral ST changes are nonspecific Since previous tracing of [**2115-8-30**], no significant change  ********************  Relevant studies in hospital: [**2115-8-29**] ECHO: LVEF low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls.
Transfusion of FFP was initiated in the ED to reverse her coagulopathy and plan for temporary hemodialysis catheter placement.
Potassium during code 6.9, after therapy.
EKG post code unchanged.
An echo was obtained on [**8-29**], which revealed a stable EF at 50%, 2+ MR (improved versus [**6-/2115**]) and moderate PA HTN (old).
Significant pain in chest from chest compressions, but chest x-ray after code showed no evidence of PNX, hemothorax, rib fracture.
Electrolytes were monitored and she received HD QOD.
2) Respiratory failure: Attributed to fluid overload in the setting of missed hemodialysis [**2-20**] clotted AV graft and fluid administration +/- [**Month/Day (2) 2182**].
Sputum grew GPC, GNR, pseudomonas, but patient has had psuedomonas in past and is likely colonized.
She completed a 7 day course of antibiotics but remained afebrile, WBC count at baseline, with no evidence of PNA on any CXR's.
Her potassium remained stable and she was given EPO and paricalcitol at dialysis.
Her phosphate was chronically elevated, but once TUMS were changed to be given with meals, the phosphate fell to 4-5 range.
EKG pre and post arrest unchanged.
Cardiac enzymes not trended post chest compresssions.
Pulse and BP stable, but please monitor at rehab.
5) Coagulopathy: INR 6.8 on admission.
Vitamin K given on [**8-29**], and INR down to 2.3 on [**8-30**].
Coumadin restarted at same time, initially at 7.5 mg.  She reached therapeutic level quickly so dose was decreased to 5 mg and then 2.5 mg.  INR on discharge 2.1, with goal [**2-21**].
Discharge Instructions: 1) Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
