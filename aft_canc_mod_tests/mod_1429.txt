Admission Date:  [**2105-12-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2106-1-3**]  Date of Birth:   [**2041-8-2**]     Sex:  F  Service:  OMED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 34355**] is a 64 year old female with a history of adenocarcinoma with unknown primary with bone marrow involvement and metastases to spine, ribs and hips as well as a history of thrombocytopenia likely immune mediated, who presented to [**Hospital1 190**] in [**2105-8-29**], with headache, lethargy, ataxia and blurry vision in the setting of platelet counts of 23,000.
An MRI at that time revealed a subdural hematoma on the left side with mass affect and midline shift.
Her platelet count was found to be 16,000, therefore, she was admitted and a STAT head CT scan was done due the suspicion of worsening subdural bleed.
The head CT scan showed an increase in the left subdural hematoma with sub-falcine herniation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At admission, temperature of 99.1 F.; respiratory rate 16; pulse of 88; blood pressure 120/72.
Chest clear to auscultation anteriorly.
All other reflexes were two plus.
LABORATORY:  Labs on admission showed a white count of 7,000, with 77 neutrophils, 8 bands, 3 monocytes, and 4 nucleated red blood cells.
Hematocrit of 22 and platelets of 14.
Chem-7 showed a sodium of 129, potassium 4.1, chloride 96, bicarbonate 24, BUN 17, creatinine 0.4, glucose 153.
Calcium 8.5, magnesium 1.9, phosphorus 3.0, ALT 22, AST 75, alkaline phosphatase 687, total bilirubin 1.7, albumin 3.4.
A neurosurgical evaluation was done on [**12-23**].
On [**2105-12-27**], due to the head CT scan findings and the patient's decreasing mental status, it was determined to place a subdural drain.
In the following day, there was minimal change in mental status and a repeat head CT scan showed no change in the subdural hematoma, the midline shift or herniation.
Therefore, a craniotomy was done on [**12-29**], with replacement of the subdural drain.
At this time, the patient was transferred to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit for further care.
A repeat head CT scan after this procedure showed a decrease in the subdural hematoma.
The patient underwent a carotid Doppler and an echocardiogram to evaluate for embolic sources to explain the new stroke.
She continued to have low platelet counts and labile blood pressures.
All blood pressure medications and non-comfort oriented medications were discontinued at that time.
