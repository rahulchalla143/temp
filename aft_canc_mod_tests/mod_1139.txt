Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = 20 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior free wall, posterior wall, lateral wall, and apex.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-5-7**], extensive posterior wall and lateral wall akinesis are now present (contractile function of these walls was relatively preserved in the prior study), associated with a marked increase in the mitral regurgitation (previously mild).
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated two-vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with a RA mean of 34 mmHg, RVEDP of 33 mmHg and a PCWP of 28 mmHg.
There was pulmonary arterial hypertension with a mean PA pressure of 37 mmHg.
The cardiac index was significantly decreased at 1.89 L/min/m2.
There was systemic arterial hypotension with a central aortic pressure of 90/56 mmHg on levophed.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 25641**] is a 74yo male with history DMII, CKD on PD, CAD, ischemic systolic/diastolic CHF (EF 15%), VT s/p ICD [**8-29**], recently hospitalized for NSTEMI s/p BMS to RCA for 99% occlusion of old stents([**5-1**]), and recurrent lung cancer with possible metastatic disease who presented with chest pain concerning for ACS due to new CK, MB, and trop elevations, new severe MR, and new akinesis of posterior wall and lateral wall on ECHO  Given concern for ACS and occlusion of recent BMS RCA stent (in the area of wall akinesis), the patient was started on heparin and plavix and sent for urgent cardiac catheterization.
Cath showed distal 50% LMCA stenosis with 90% ostial origin LCx and mid LCx 70% with layering thrombus.
Two overlapping BMS were then placed to the occluded LCx, which "jailed" the LAD but still showed good flow.
Repeat coronary films showed patent proximal LCx stents, thrombotic occlusion of the distal LCx and thrombus in the proximal LAD with slow flow, so these areas were then POBA'd and stented.
His hct had dropped to 14 while in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was given 2 units PRBCs and multiple fluid boluses still without any change in BP.
Subsequent labs showed rising lactate, worsening acidosis (only transient improvements with bicarb boluses), and further metabolic derrangements.
