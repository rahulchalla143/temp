Multiple scattered nodular and linear ground-glass opacities within a predominantly peripheral distribution, new compared to study performed less than one month prior.
Diagnostic considerations include an atypical infection; however, other etiologies such as drug reaction, eosinophilic pneumonia, or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) should also be considered.
