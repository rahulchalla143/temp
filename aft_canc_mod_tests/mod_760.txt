EKG showed ST 106 incomplete RB on previous, incomplete L bundle.
Urine from nephrostomy was cloudy; Foley'd urine was the second drawn.
She had an elevated pro-BNP but normal trop, and no right axis deviation on ECG or on u/s: was not a candidate for TPA.

Further w/u ended up ruling out PE, and her SOB was likely in the context of her fever and GNR bacteremia, which were likely [**3-8**] urinary source.
A VQ scan was subsequently performed, and it was low probability for PE and the heparin was d/c'd.
Her dyspnea was most likely due to her anemia as she significantly improved after transfusion of 2 units pRBCs for a HCT of 18. .
She received vanc/cefepime in the ED; her past urine Cx's have grown E coli sensitive to cefepime.
Per past urology notes, her R kidney is not functioning as well as the left, and no other urological interventions were necessary; she is scheduled for a left stent change in [**7-17**].
While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], GNRs grew out of her blood Cx from [**6-16**], and she was continued on cefepime (d1=[**6-16**]), and continued on vanc (d1=[**6-16**]) given that she has a port.
Her urine culture grew coag + staph and per Urology, it was recommended to continue treating the UTI w/o indication for stent removal at this time.
Her urine culture eventually speciated as pansensitive staphylococcus aureus, and she was transitioned to oral augmentin to compelte a total 14 day course following discharge.
Her blood cultures speciated as pansensitive E. coli and she was transitined to oral ciprofloxacin, also to complete a 14 day course, priro to dishcarge.
Her Cr improved in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to 1.4 after 2 units pRBCs, and subsequently improved further to 1.2 by the time of discharge.
# Anemia: Macrocytic anemia with Hct 24.9 and MCV 102 on admission; baseline Hct is in high 20's.
Once her creatinine decreased to 1.4, her home lisinopril was re-started.
Your blood counts were found to be low, and you were given blood transfusions.
You were initally started on a blood thinner to treat you for a potential blood clot in your lungs, but subsequent studies showed that you were unlikely to have developed a blood clot, and the blood thinner was stopped.
Your breathing improved after blood transfusion.
