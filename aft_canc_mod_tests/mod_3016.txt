His vitals were taken and was found to be afebrile 95.7, hypotensive (79/57), tachycardic (120) and hypoxic (O2SAT: 81% on RA).
His bilateral LE were found to be cold and purple.
He was warmed up and put into bed and his BP stabilized in 110s, he was placed on nonrebreather and his O2 sats came up only to 87%.
This admission was complicated by delirium and LE DVT for which an IVC filter was placed due to concurrent hematuria.
However, his BP dropped to 90/60 BP with sats in the 80s and a lactate of 6.
CXR showed no acute pulmonary process.
He was transfered to the MICU with concern for urosepsis where his pressure stabilized and he did not require pressors.
Upon ariving to the floor vitals were 99.2 122/60 91 20 97% on RA.

CXR [**2-9**]: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
There is questionable new small focal opacity at the mid portion of the left lung that might represent subpleural atelectasis/nodule seen on the chest CT from [**2157-1-29**], with no new consolidations demonstrated.
The known pulmonary nodules are partially imaged on the current study due to the suboptimal sensitivity of this portable chest radiograph.
Multiple rib fractures, bilateral, are unchanged since the prior study.
CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are numerous pulmonary nodules throughout all lobes of the lungs consistent with metastatic disease, presumably from the patient's known bladder cancer unless there is an additional unknown primary neoplasm.
Limited axial imaging of the upper abdomen is fairly unremarkable, although numerous renal hypodensities are again seen, which are most consistent with cysts, although better demonstrated on prior imaging studies.
UCx pseudomonas 10-100k, sensitive to cefepime, ceftaz, gent, [**Last Name (un) 2830**], [**Doctor Last Name **], tobra.
Med onc consulted->  Rec chest CT for accurate staging, bx for tissue diagnosis, and agreed to follow when outpatient.
CT scan done for staging as above showed DVT extended up to DVT filter.
UCx, BCx, and CXR negative for infection.
WBC stable.
# Anemia: baseline Hct 32-35, current Hct 25, likely [**1-25**] hematuria.
Iron studies were consistent with underlying anemia of chronic disease.
His Hct was stable around 26 prior to discharge.
