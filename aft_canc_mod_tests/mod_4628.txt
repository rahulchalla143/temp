L4 laminectomy for biopsy of neoplasm.
Posterolateral fusion L3-L4, L4-L5.
He also had Abd CT w/o contrast [**2106-4-1**] which showed narrowing of post-bulbar duodenum (stricture as above), with cystic lesion at L4.
Because of the latter, he underwent bone scan [**2106-4-1**] which was negative.
MRI cervical spine was reportedly performed today in [**Location (un) 1411**] w/o gadolinium and showed Thoracic lesions above.

Biopsy of the spine identified multiple myeloma as the cause of the lytic lesions.
His hospital course has included: - posterior lumbar fusions on [**2106-6-21**] - Anterior lumbar fusion [**2106-7-20**] - ileus and gastric outlet obstruction, requiring dilation - acalculous cholecystitis and infectious pericholecystic fluid - C difficile diarrhea - right sided exudative pleural effusion s/p chest tube and removal - health care associate pneumonia (treated with vanc/cefe/flagyl) - sacral decubitus ulcer On discharge, his condition has significantly improved.
He was found to have a pathologic L4 fracture in need of stabilization and his multiple myeloma was diagnosed via tissue pathology from posterior spine stabilization on [**2106-6-21**].
Heme/Onc and Rad/Onc were aware of patient but put further treatment or evaluation for multiple myeloma on hold until more acute hospital issues are resolved (see below).
Will need pamidronate q4wks (1st dose was [**8-8**]).
#) Pathologic Spine Fracture: Pt had lumbar instability due to L4 lytic lesion found incidentally on initial MRI.
He became acutely obstructed on [**2106-6-25**] with AXR showing severe dilation of his stomach.
An NGT placement yielded 1L bilious fluid.
Possible that the 2nd two events were due to total bowel distension and ileus [**2-24**] to narcotics, Cdiff, immobility, and limited diet as much as a problem with the duodenal stricture as they were not completely relieved with NGT placement and abdominal imaging showed persistently dilated bowel loops.
After his anterior fusion, abdomen remained distended possibly from gastric obstruction/post-operative ileus/narcotic use.
Was having very little stool but it was liquid and Cdiff toxin sent on [**2106-6-30**] came back positive on [**2106-7-1**].
Initially WBC and exam improved with this therapy but when WBC worsened again PO vanco was added to metronidazole on [**2106-7-5**].
#) Poor respiratory status: This was not present on hospital admission and CXR on [**2106-6-29**] had no effusion but PICC confirmation CXR on [**7-2**] showed large unilateral (right) effusion which had developed in the 3 day interval.
Fluid studies boarderline exudate vs transudate and cultures pending.
He was also tachycardic with HR up to 120.
EKG was unchanged from previous, ABG shows alkolosis, Multiple CXRs and MRI with contrast ([**7-29**]) showed only stable atelectasis and stable right-sided pleural effusion, with no evidence of pneumonia or PE.
Abdominal CT had showed GB enlargement but picture muddied by fluid around gallbladder from small amount of ascites due to low albumin.
On physician exam of the stool, it was brown with some blood streaking and patient had notable hemorrhoid protruding externally on physical exam.
Stat Hct showed drop from 28.7 to 24.5 which was slightly outside the range of lab error and in the setting of this and other clinic changes (HR and RR), pt was transferred to the MICU and IV PPI initiated.
Hct were stable afterwards.
Upper endoscopy by GI demonstrated a non-bleeding duodenal ulcer.
His metoprolol was not re-started during the hospitalization but should be restarted at rehab and was included in his medication list.
A video swallow eval recommended nectars and pureed food.
On [**8-11**] he underwent a cortisol stim test, and his cortisol level at 1hr and 15min was 17.8.
Sodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush 3 mL IV Q8H:PRN line flush Peripheral line: Flush with 3 mL Normal Saline every 8 hours and PRN.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7842**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) **] after rehab.
---Hem/onc at [**Hospital1 **] will follow multiple myeloma.
