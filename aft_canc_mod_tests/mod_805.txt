At [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**], Ms. [**Known lastname 20281**] was found of a white blood count of 300,000 with 94% blasts.
She was started on IV fluids with bicarbonate and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Flow cytometry on [**2145-1-27**] from her peripheral blood showed a majority of the cells in the CD45 intermediate low side scatter blast region.
The cells expressed CD33 along with dim CD4 and dim CD19.
Cells were negative for CD34 and HLA-DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 20282**] were negative for other myeloid markers including CD13, CD14, CD15, CD41, CD64, glycolphorin, CD17.
Cytogenetics were notable for FLT3 and NPM positivity.
Echocardiogram showed a left ejection fraction of greater than 65%.
She also was noted for a drop in her ejection fraction to 20-25% on [**2145-2-14**], which was felt due to anthracycline use.
She has been managed medically initially with spironolactone, furosemide, lisinopril, and metoprolol and is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NP as an outpatient.
Followup testing with serotonin releasing assay was negative, thereby making HIT diagnosis unlikely.
She had a repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy done on [**2145-3-18**] and [**2145-3-26**], both showing no evidence for patient's known leukemia, although the specimen on [**2145-3-26**] showed megakaryocytic hypoplasia.
Repeat testing for FLT3 mutation and NPM mutation were sent on [**2145-3-27**] and were negative.
Ms. [**Known lastname 20281**] was further evaluated with a repeat ultrasound which continued to shows a superficial clot in the saphenous vein, but there was no evidence for deep vein thrombosis, so she did not require any further anticoagultion, which would have been difficult as her platelet count has remained low.
She also was reevaluated with echocardiogram which showed improvement in her left ventricular ejection fraction to 50-55%.
CT of the head was negative, and she was discharged to [**Location (un) 1036**] for further rehabilitation.
She had a repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2145-4-23**] which showed a hypocellular erythroid dominant bone marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis whit no evidence for acute leukemia.
Because of her known mutations, she is at high risk for recurrent leukemia and is in need of n allogeneic transplant.
History of hepatic cyst (noted on a preoperative workup for AVR and stable on imaging) - was concerning for an echinococcal cyst, and treated empirically with albendazole in [**10/2143**]; repeat CT from [**2145-2-16**] notes the cyst to be markedly smaller at 10.6 x 10.1 mm from 8.5 x 6.2 cm.

CARDIOLOGY: TTE ([**6-13**]): Conclusions Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-5-7**], left ventricular systolic function is less vigorous.
NEURO: EEG ([**5-/2145**]): This is an abnormal routine EEG due to a slow and poorly modulated background indicative of a moderate to severe encephalopathy.
RADIOLOGY: MRI Brain [**6-24**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
While the presence of mucosal thickening and fluid does not by itself mean mastoiditis, to correlate clinically and with ENT examination to exclude infective mastoiditis and if necessary LP, based on clinical examination.
MR angiogram of the head without IV contrast can be considered.
Repeat echocardiogram showed EF newly depressed to 30%.
On later echo EF improved to 35-40%.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 140s, compromising her forward flow and resulting blood pressure.
In the last 24 hours her afib with RVR returned when her BP dropped.
Her WBC was still 0.1 without change.
Coagulopathy: INR trended up slowly.
Events of 24 hours proceeding expiration: Pt had CVVH with 6 liters removed.
Given fluid, 3 liters of NS, but BP only temporarily responded.
SBP in 60s, started Neo-Synephrine and required addition of Levophed.
BP continued to  be labile.
Stat echo showed EF of less than 10%.
