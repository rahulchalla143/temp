For the past 4-6 weeks, she has been experiencing SOB and increasing bruising and went to her PCP who referred her to the emergency department for anemia with Hgb of 7.0, Hct 19, platelets of 6, WBC 10.7.

[**2191-11-24**] bone marrow biopsy Precursor B- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
[**2191-11-28**] liver biopsy Sections are of liver parenchyma with a patchy dense lymphoid infiltrate composed of medium-sized lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm, round-to-irregular nuclei, pale chromatin and occasional small nucleoli.
By immunohistochemistry, the infiltrate is diffusely immunoreactive for pan B-marker CD20, along with TdT, CD34, and CD10.
[**2191-11-28**] CT chest Fragment of the intervention device, presumably a part of the access kit, misplaced in the right atrium and right ventricle.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-11-30**], the tricuspid valve vegetation (versus mass/thrombus) appears smaller.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-12-8**], no change.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2191-12-22**] at 2:36:59 PM FINAL Conclusions Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-12-12**], the pericardial effusion has essentially resolved.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2192-1-3**] at 3:17:56 PM      FINAL Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2191-12-17**] 2:40 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Two right pulmonary nodules measuring 2 and 4 mm respectively, in light of the history of smoking, a 12-month followup CT is suggested to assess for stability.
Interval increase in small thrombus involving the basilic vein, when compared to prior study ([**2191-12-30**]).
Started Part A on [**12-1**] and Part B [**12-26**].
Presented with 4-6 weeks fatigue and bruising and initial WBC 14 with 73% lymphoblasts and plt 6), s/p removal of IR apparatus from R atrium/ventricle [**11-28**] following transjugular liver bx and echo showed some clot after this.
Had emergent echo showing pericardial tamponade and went for drainage and to CCU post drainage of  400ml blood (Hct 25) .
RUE DVT found on doppler U/S [**12-30**] and anticoagulation with treatment dose LMWH started [**12-31**] post LP with a plan to hold LMWH if Plt <50.
Imatinib restarted [**12-30**] but held on [**1-4**] b/c of rising LFTs.
She Initially presented as a referral from PCP to emergency department for anemia with Hgb of 7.0, Hct 19, platelets of 6, WBC 10.7.
Results c/w PHL+ pre-B cell ALL, also had elevated AST and ALT, which was evaluated by livery biopsy that showed hepatic involvement with leukemia (c/b dislodged IR catheter, see below for details).
Tumor lysis labs were followed and she was on allopurinol.
There was concern for CNS involvement as 2 WBCs in CSF were suspicious for leukemic cells.
Allopurinol stopped [**12-22**].
Transfusion goals were for HCt >24 Plt >20.
# Elevated LFTs: followed by hepatology during admission, on liver biopsy [**12-29**] was secondary to leukemic infiltration (see CCU course for liver bx complications).
Iron studies were elevated and per liver team this was felt likely [**3-15**] inflammation, and smooth muscle antibodies returned positive, which was a nonspecific finding.
Her liver biopsy was complicated as detailed below and required IR intervention and subsequent CCU admission.
CT showed catheter extending across tricuspid valve to the RV.
Pain was controlled with morphine, ativan, lidocaine patch.
The patient had no ectopy or arrhtymia overnight and HCT remained stable.
#Pericardial effusion post drain: ECG after [**11-29**] showed low voltages and she became symptomatic on [**12-5**].
On [**12-6**] the patient was found to have a pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade physiology in setting of chest pain, SOB, decreased voltage on ECG, and a pulsus paradoxus of 15mmHg.
Cytology returned suggestive of frank blood (HCt 25).
CXR on[**12-10**] showed her heart size unchanged.
Repeat ECHOs on [**12-22**] and [**1-3**] showed no significant effusion remaining.
CXR showed resolved effusions.
Pulsus was 6-8mmHg and cardiology agreed clinically unlikely.
Echo [**12-22**] showed a trival pericardial effusion with no echocardgiographic evidence of tamponade and compared with the prior echo, the pericardial effusion had essentially resolved.
Initially low BP with systolic 70mmHg and improved with fluids.
Final CT report - hypodensity R PCA territory ??
Repeat labs were stable.
Initially large L and small R. If becomes acutely SOB may have to be tapped and for urgent CXR or if spikes fever.
Improving on CXR of [**12-10**] Auto-diuresing and now resolved as per CXR [**12-21**].
Furosemide 20mg po [**12-24**] to diurese remaining pleural fluid prior to Methotrexate.Rpt CXR [**12-25**] to show resolution of effusions prior to starting Part B [**12-25**].
# RUE DVT: Unilateral swollen R arm with PICC - went on to U/S and showed clot extending from subclavian to brachial vein - for anticoagulation with enoxaparin post LP on [**12-31**] and to hold LMWH if Plt <50.
Repeat US on [**2192-1-12**] showed remaining clot but was non-occlusive; per att recs, pt was not restarted on lovenox.
# Incidental finding: CT-PA [**12-21**] showed two right pulmonary nodules measuring 2 and 4 mm respectively, in light of the history of smoking, a 12-month followup CT is suggested to assess for stability.

It was was found that there was some leukemic infiltration of the liver; your liver enzymes also were elevated because of drugs that were needed to treat your cancer as well.
You had a pericardial effusion causing tamponade (or fluid or blood in the sac surround the heart) resulted in decreased ability of the heart to pump blood forward to the rest of your body.
The effusion resolved and repeat echocardiogram demonstrated that there was no more effusion.
The catheter was removed and a repeat U/S on [**2192-1-12**] showed that the DVT is still there, but it is non-occlusive so anticoagulation was not started.
Given your improvement in blood counts and symptoms, it was felt that you could safely go home for several days after your intrathecal chemo today ([**1-13**]) to await the next round of treatment early next week.
You will need to have blood tests at that time.
