Her hematocrit stabilized.
There is no source of bleeding visualized on the CT of the abdomen and pelvis upon admission.
Laboratory evaluation was not significant for hemolysis.
GI consultation felt that she was mostly suffering from a GI bleed however did not feel that an EGD or colonoscopy was indicated due too severe to clinical status.
Her [**Month/Day/Year **] cultures that were initially drawn in the emergency were positive.
This course was complicated by continued elevations of her lactate as well as white [**Month/Day/Year **] cell count after initial improvement.
Repeat [**Month/Day/Year **] culture showed gram-negative rods.
Patient has possibly an intra-abdominal infection although there was no source of infection found on CT of the abdomen.
Throughout her stay her bilirubin as well as LFTs alkaline phosphatase became elevated.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained and did not show any intrahepatic obstruction but the CBD was not visualized.
Surgery evaluated the patient and stated that a HIDA scan would most likely not be useful due to her severe clinical condition that would prevent any surgical intervention.
Her INR was increased to above 2.
Her INR did improve to 1.7.
A KUB was obtained and did not show evidence of toxic megacolon.
#7: Pancreatic pseudocyst on initial CT of the abdomen the patient was found to have a large pancreatic pseudocyst with questionable hemorrhage versus infection.
