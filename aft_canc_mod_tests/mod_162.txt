EGD #1 [**2116-12-4**]: Esophagus: Excavated Lesions- A single non-bleeding linear erosion was noted in the lower third of the esophagus with overlying mucus.
EGD #2 [**2116-12-8**]: Normal esophagus.
A few medium localized angioectasias that were not bleeding were seen in the fundus and stomach body.
Impression: Extrinsic impression of the stomach Angioectasias in the fundus and stomach body Otherwise normal egd to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **] Follow Hct CT scan abdomen to evaluate for extrinsic compression of the stomach.

LABS: [**2116-12-3**] 11:20AM   WBC-22.5  RBC-1.76  HGB-5.6  HCT-16.3  MCV-93 MCH-31.8 MCHC-34.2  RDW-20.0 PT-25.8  PTT-35.9  INR(PT)-4.9 GLUCOSE-153  UREA N-78  CREAT-1.6  SODIUM-137  POTASSIUM-4.6 CHLORIDE-104 TOTAL CO2-22  ANION GAP-16 CALCIUM-8.0  PHOSPHATE-3.3  MAGNESIUM-2.6  Brief Hospital Course: Assessment:  75 year old man with history of Atrail Fibrillation and left sided thrombus on Coumadin with  4-5 days of melena and associated anemia determined to be secondary to gastric AVMs successfully cauderized.
1) GI BLEED:  After presenting to the ED with 4-5 days of melena and HCT 16.3 in the setting of INR of 4.9, Mr. [**Known lastname 7458**] anticoagulation was discontinued and he was given 4 units PRBC, 4 units FFP, SC Vit.
His HCT stabilized and INR decreased to 1.9.
After EGD and stabilization of vital signs, Mr. [**Known lastname 7457**] was transferred to the floor, where he was monitored for recurrent GI bleed with vital signs, serial HCT checks, serial abdominal exams, and stool collection.
His INR was followed and he was treated with Protonix.
He was transfused an additional 2 units of PRBC and a repeat EGD was performed on [**12-8**].
On repeat EGD there were no ulcers seen in the esophagus.
After the second EGD, the patient remained stable with no signs of recurrent bleeding: HCT and vital signs remained stable, and the patient's bowel movements were non-bloody and non-melenous.
The patient's GI bleed on admission occurred in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR of 4.9, so coumadin was held and anticoagulation was reversed in the ED with 4 units Fresh Frozen Plasma and Vitamin K. Given his known left atrial thrombus and associated increased risk of stroke, it was recommended by cardiology that he restart Coumadin as soon as the GI team considered his GI bleed stable.
Diltiazem was initially held because his BP remained in the 90's and 100's systolic, but resumed once BP stabilized.
He continued to experience intermittent milder dyspnea on hospital day 2, and O2 sat of 91% on RA was recorded.
The patient was placed on 2L oxygen via nasal cannula, and EKG was obtained to rule-out cardiac ischemia EKG was unchanged from prior.
CXR was obtained which showed a small opacity in the L lower lobe which was consistent with pneumonia.
4) Edema: The patient has a history of lower extremity edema and scrotal anasarca for which he takes furosemide 80mg daily.
Given that the patient is known to have thrombocytosis and transfusion-dependent anemia, his blood counts were closely followed.
Diltiazem and Losartan were initially held, then resumed once the patient was stable and it appeared that his blood pressure could tolerate them.
7) Findings on CT scan: The patient had multiple significant findings on abdominal/pelvic CT obtained on [**12-9**]: - Dilated splenic vein and ascites, indicative of portal hypertension - 2.0 x 3.3 cm cystic lesion between the tail of the pancreas and the spleen; it is not clear if this arises from the pancreatic tail or the spleen.
Outpatient work-up of portal hypertension is recommended.
His Coumadin has been restarted, INR is   Hematocrit is stable at >30.
