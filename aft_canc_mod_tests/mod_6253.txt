TECHNIQUE: MDCT images of the chest were obtained both without and with 90 cc of non-ionic intravenous Optiray contrast.
The study was optimized for evaluation of the pulmonary arteries rather than the mediastinal structures.
Pulmonary nodules, thoracic adenopathy and numerous osseous lesions are compatible with diffuse metastatic disease.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CT scan of the chest revealed non-occlusive segmental and sub-segmental left lower lobe pulmonary emboli, near complete collapse of the right lung by a large pleural effusion, [**Hospital1 20534**] of portions of the compressed lung may be secondary to pneumonia, pulmonary nodules, thoracic adenopathy and numerous osseous lesions are compatible with diffuse metastatic disease.
She was taken to the operating room on [**11-18**] and underwent VATS with evacuation of 2.6 liters of effusion fluid and placement of Pleurex catheter.
