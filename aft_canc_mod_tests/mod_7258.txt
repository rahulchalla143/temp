Work-up with urinalysis, CXR, and CT abdomen/pelvis did not reveal a source of infection.
Earlier this evening, at around 5 p.m. on [**2-16**], the patient developed hypotension to SBP 80s in the setting of fever to 100.7.
However, his oxygenation remained good, and his ABG was 7.48/24/75.

TTE [**2195-2-26**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 55-60%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-2-20**], a small pericardial effusion is now present.
A limited panel to assess B-cell clonality was attempted, however low cellularity and dim surface immunoglobulin staining precludes reliable assessment.
If clinically indicated, a repeat specimen may be submitted to the flow cytometry laboratory.
Review of corresponding cytospin showed mostly small mature appearing lymphocytes with few admixed layer lymphocytes and histiocytes.

While on the floor, the patient had repeat CT chest which showed evidence of LLL collapse.
He was evaluated by pulmonary who thought that a bronchoscopy was not necessarily indicated, and instead recommended symptomatic meausures such as, fluticasone, chest PT, aggressive incentive spirometry, and standing nebulizer treatments.
Subsequent CXRs showed some mild improvement, however, upon discharge the patient still had b/l atelectasis with LLL, as well as small L pleural effusion-->clincally, however, he was doing well, satting well on room air.
# hypotension [**1-29**] CMV adrenalitis: While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was found to be hypotensive and he was maintained on pressors to keep MAP >60.
As his blood pressures improved, he was weaned off pressors and he maintained his blood pressure on his own.
He was found to have CMV viremia, and his other cultures did not grow anything by [**2195-3-1**] and beta glucan and galactomannan negative.
On transfer to the BMT floor, the patient's sodium was trended, and hypernatremia had resolved, as he started taking better POs.
CT scans of head were done which just showed age related volume loss but no acute abnormalities.
The patient was started on IV ganciclovir induction dose and his CMV viral load was checked weekly.
After ~21 days of induction treatment, and two negative CMV viral loads, the patient was switched to PO maintenace dosing, dosed per his renal function.
# Hct drop/Anemia: While in the intensive care unit, the patient with Hct drop to 17.7 on [**2-22**].
Pt received 4 u pRBCs, 2u plasma, 1u FFP and underwent EGD which had no e/o bleeding site.
Hct recovered to 17 ->24.4 -> 31.8, but had another episode of hct of unclear etiology.
No clear evidence of active bleeding and hemolysis, coombs test was negative.
He was continued on pantoprazole 40mg IV BID and his hct was monitored.
ECG shows sinus bradycardia and no ischemic changes.
He was slowly weaned off steroids and as his temperature improved, his bradycardia improved as well.
While on the BMT floor, the patient's heart rate continued to improve, and upon discharge, his pulse was ranging 50-70s.
His lytes were repleted prn and patient was started on TPN when his status improved.
While on the BMT service, the patient's abdominal distension continued, and he was found to have moderate ascites.
He underwent multiple therapeutic paracenteses; negative for both flow cytometry and cytology.
The patient's creat normalized, and upon discharge it was back to his baseline.
No evidence for full adrenal insufficiency given normal [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim, and aldosterone levels are difficult to assess in this setting.
However, the patient's blood pressures were improved after getting hydrocort/fludricort, and it was thought that this could be reflective of CMV adrenalitis.
The patient also has hepatitis serologies and Hep B and C viral loads that are still pending.
