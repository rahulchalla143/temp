While in the ED, he was found to have a chest x- ray consistent with increased bilateral infiltrates and oxygen requirements (92 percent on 10 liters).
He was contact[**Name (NI) **] by his oncologist at home today, encouraged the patient to go to the Emergency Department for evaluation of his chest pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 104 degrees, blood pressure 101/53, pulse 91, saturations 98 percent on the ventilator settings of AC 750 tidal volume with a respiratory rate of 20, FiO2 of 100 percent, PEEP of 10.
LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 2.6 with a differential of 29 percent neutrophils, 13 percent bands, 47 percent lymphocytes, 12 percent monocytes, 5 percent blasts, hematocrit 22.7, platelets 101,000.
INR 3.
Chem-7 was remarkable for a potassium of 5.8, bicarbonate of 17, and a creatinine of 1.4, baseline 1.0.
Phosphorus of 5.3.
ANC on [**2133-3-27**] was 550.
Troponin was less than 0.01 x2.

Lactate was 7.5 and then 3.9.
ABG was 7.38, 33, 84, on 10 liters.
Chest x-ray at 2 o'clock showed cardiomegaly, interval development of bibasilar and perihilar infiltrates.
Chest x-ray later on showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with ARDS, cardiomegaly, ETT 3 to 4 cm above the costal margin.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation, left axis deviation, wide QRS with no T-[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] changes.
His chest x-ray is consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome, and he is now intubated.
His ANC is less than 1000.
Blood and sputum cultures were checked.
Chest x-ray was consistent with appearance of ARDS with high oxygen requirement on the ventilator.
He was continued to be bolused with 0.5 normal saline with bicarbonate, but his lactate continued to rise and his urine output continued to decrease.
The patient also showed signs of coagulopathy with DIC and DIC with INR of 3.0, platelets decreased to 5000 on admission, hematocrit of 23.
The patient's wife elected to have a postmortem examination performed, and written permission was obtained.
