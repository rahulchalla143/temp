Volume status  The patient's report of stopping diuretics several months prior to presentation, along with increasing SOB and lower abdominal/scrotal edema, suggests that the patient was fluid overloaded.
CXR was difficult to assess, also due to habitus, but suggestive of some pulmonary edema.
When pressed to breath deeply, his saturations on room air would increase to mid-90s, suggesting a strong hypoventillatory component to his hypoxia.
On [**2-18**] L O2 by nasal canula, his sats would go to the low 90s.
Serial ABGs during his stay [**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] the following:  10 L O2 by FM: pH 7.29, pCO2 85, pO2 61, HCO3 43.
3 L O2 by NC: pH 7.35, pCO2 71, pO2 57, HCO3 41.
RA: pH 7.37, pCO2 64, pO2 39, HCO3 38.
A parital study to assess for biPAP goals was conducted on the evening of [**2127-10-9**], and results are commented on in the MICU discharge addendum.
We strongly recommend pulmonary follow-up with a formal outpatient sleep study and biPAP for Mr. [**Known lastname 25267**], and have arranged several appointments to this effect.
Additional contributory factors to his delerium were thought to include hypoxia and hypercapnia.
Ischemia: the patient's EKG was somewhat low-amplitude but not suggestive of ischemia.
Echo was limited by habitus, but showed no indication of either failure or significant wall motion abnormalities.
Pump: The patient's blood pressures were stable throughout his stay, with systolics from 104 to 130 and diastolics from 62 to 84.
His sugars were occasionally labile to the low 200s, but largely within the 120 - 150 range.
A sleep study is planned for the near future.
