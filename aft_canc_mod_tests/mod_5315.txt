CTA was performed and did not show active extravasation and that the IVC filter was still in proper position.
She was admitted to the ICU and then the floors after her hematocrit and vitals were stable.
A colonscopy showed a non-bleeding mass in the ascending colon, likely metastasis.
ACTIVE ISSUES # GI bleed: Lower GI bleed more likely given [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], brisk UGI bleed less likely.
Hematocrit did not show any significant drop from prior baseline levels.
CTA was performed to look for active bleeding and showed no active extravasation and an IVC filter in proper position.
She was initially admitted to the ICU for monitoring and her hematocrits were stable throughout her stay.
Subsequent colonoscopy revealed a non-bleeding mass in the ascending colon.
