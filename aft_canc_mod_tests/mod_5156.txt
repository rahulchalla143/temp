There is a history on subsequent examinations (this examination is being interpreted on [**2176-9-30**]) of a transsphenoidal resection of a pituitary tumor and the appearance of the sella is consistent with.
CT ANGIOGRAM: There is no definite evidence of aneurysm or flow abnormality.
[**2176-9-25**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: INDICATIONS:  65-year-old man status post ventricular catheter replacement.
In addition, there is asymmetric soft tissue at the right side of the sella, and a sella mass cannot be excluded.
A sella MRI with gadolinium should be obtained for further evaluation.
The integrity of the sinuses cannot be determined on this head CT and a coronal sinus CT should be obtained for evaluation of this region.
[**9-27**] CT head without contrast FINDINGS: There is a right frontal ventriculostomy catheter with the tip in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
The blood clot near the left foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**] is no longer present.
[**10-4**] ECG Sinus rhythm.
[**10-8**] CT head without contrast FINDINGS: As before, there is a right frontal ventriculostomy catheter with the tip in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
[**10-9**] ECHO Conclusions: 1.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[**10-11**] CXR Portable AP view of the chest dated [**2176-7-11**] compared with the prior from [**2176-10-17**] at 17:59.
[**10-11**] CT Abd/Pelvis TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast MDCT axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no evidence of acute bleeding in the abdomen.
Non-contrast images of the liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, abdominal portions of the small and large bowel are unremarkable.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid, bladder are unremarkable.

M recently admitted to OSH ([**9-22**]) presents to OSH with difficulty to arouse and respiratory distress (negative chest CT and labs).
Symptoms persisted so he was brought to another OSH for further evaluation where a head CT was performed and an interventricular bleed was noted.
Problems were as follows while on medicine:  # Hypotension: He was found to be hypotensive to SBP in 90s the day after his PEG placement.
Thought to be [**2-1**] periprocedure adrenal insuffiency as he was afebile, blood, urine cx neg, CXR neg and CT abdomen not concerning for bleed or free air in abdomen.
He had no further evidence of seizure activity and, at the time of discharge, his dilantin level was therapeutic.
Urine osm was high in context of low serum osms.
# Hypopituitary: started levothyroxine [**10-8**] for his panhypopituitarism  # Atrial flutter: had 2-3 episodes on [**10-8**] but none since then.
TTE showed a right atrial mass, which most likely represents an atrial myxoma, although clot remains on the differential diagnosis.
Foley cath d/c'd on [**10-16**] and he was switched to a condom cath.
If hematuria persists as an outpatient, urology follow-up may be considered at the discretion of his PCP.
On CT abdomen, there may be a small hematoma peri-PEG-site.
Iron studies consistent with ACD.
Hct 28 on discharge  # Schizophrenia: continue olanzapine, benztropine for prevention of EPS?
(was taking on admission)  # FEN: continue TF with PEG, replete lytes prn, failed speech and swallow eval - speech and swallow video eval should be repeated in one month to see if he could begin to tolerate po - s/p PEG placement [**10-10**]  # Contact: third party guardian [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 68736**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 46208**], cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 68735**] (best number).
