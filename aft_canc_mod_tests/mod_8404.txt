Lymph nodes, L10 (AC-AD):  Two lymph nodes with no malignancy identified (0/2).
Lymph node, L7 (AE):  One lymph node with no malignancy identified (0/1).
Post operative course included the following:  Day#1 - chest tube leak, transfused 2U pRBC due to low hematocrit.
Day#2 - leak resolved, Patient spiked to [**Age over 90 **]F, pan-cultured, changed to oral levofloxin, hematocrit still low, transfused another 2U pRBC which improved his hematocrit.
All the cultures eventually came back negative.
Day#5 - cxr slightly improved, but loculated effusion still present Day#6 - tpa was injected into chest tube , after which a substantial amount of drainge occured over the next 24-48 hours Day #9 - both chest tubes, post chest xray showed some improvement.
