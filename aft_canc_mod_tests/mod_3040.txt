She was taken for VATS on [**2179-11-15**] for biopsy of the lung nodules seen on chest CT.  A bronchoscopy with lavage was also performed during the procedure.
The tissue biopsy obtained during VATS was negative; however, the BAL was positive for Aspergillus.
Follow up CT scans of the chest showed findings consistent with invasive aspergillosis.
A CTA was performed on [**11-28**] which was negative for pulmonary embolism.
A sinus CT was obtained and was negative with exception of mucosal thickening.
She was followed radiographically with another sinus CT which was unchanged.
A TTE was performed [**11-21**] and revealed normal EF.
This study was positive for a left IJ clot.
* 8) RML PNEUMONIA: Later in her hospital course, a chest x-ray was performed showing a RML pneumonia.
A repeat CXR was performed and showed a worsening RML pneumonia.
Humidified air and chest PT were used to break up secretions.
She was started on albuterol and atrovent nebs, as well as humidified air and chest PT to break up secretions.
Eventually, the patient had episode of desaturation requiring 100% non-rebreather to maintain saturation in the mid 90's.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was unable to intubated because of significant upper airway anatomical obstruction from her GvHD, so an emergent tracheostomy was performed.
