He was transferred to our ICU after he developed expressive aphasia and a small IPH was found at the OSH on the day they had planned to discharge him to home ([**8-17**]).
He called his doctor (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], covering for his PCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 87574**]) from his cell phone in the room, and called his wife.
A stroke-protocol NCHCT revealed a small (?1x2cm) IPH with overlying small SDH per OSH notes.
A CTA revealed unremarkable vessels.
A repeat NCHCT around 5-6pm that night showed possible increase in the size of his IPH to 2.6x2.9cm per Radiology report (it was not measured in the report for the first NCHCT around 10am).
There was a faint RUL opacity on CXR, which resolved by repeat imaging on abx [**8-12**].
With the lack of identified infectious etiology and the lack of response to broad-spectrum antibacterial treatment, and with the background of undifferentiated autoimmune vasculitis (he was continued on 20mg daily prednisone through all this), they tried an empiric 3-day course of IV methylprednisolone followed by 80mg prednisone daily.
CRP came down from ~170 to ~60.
Pt's family thinks he has PMR and GCA; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] said temp a. Bx was negative for GCA in [**2189**].
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, and non-distended, + normoactive bowel sounds.
2+ radial, DP pulses bilaterally.
Detailed skin exam deferred to day team due to time constraints.
***************** Neurologic examination:  * entire exam quite limited by slowed/slurred speech, word-finding difficulties.
Memory - registers 3 objects and recalls [**2-11**] at 5 minutes, [**3-11**] with reminder.
V: Facial sensation intact and subjectively symmetric to light touch and pinprick V1-V2-V3.
Eyes-closed Finger-to-[**Last Name (un) **] testing revealed no proprioceptive deficit (did not miss [**Last Name (Titles) **]).
-Reflex examination (left; right): symmetric Biceps (++;++) Triceps  (+;+) Brachioradialis (++;++) Quadriceps / patellar (++;++) Gastroc-soleus / achilles (0/+;0/+) Plantar response was indeterminate bilaterally.
Heel-knee-shin testing with no gross dysmetria.
Pertinent Results: NCHCT [**2190-8-17**] ~1000 Left frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with adjacent subdural hematoma.
NCHCT [**2190-8-17**] ~ 1700 Slight interval enlargement of the left frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage which now measures 2.6cm x 2.9cm.
CTA Head/Neck [**2190-8-17**] Unremarkable CT angiogram of the head and neck.
NCHCT [**2190-8-18**] 1700 Decrease in size of organizing intraparenchymal hematoma with stable small overlying subdural hematoma.
The patient had been hospitalized for investigation of a fever of unknown origin in the setting of his vasculitis on chronic prednisone therapy and his MDS with interval finding of a BAL suspicious for but not confirmatory of Pneumocystic jirovecii infection (for which he was switched from Atovaquone daily to [**Hospital1 **] dosage) and a left gastrocnemius vein DVT, left deep brachial DVT, and left median cubital superficial thrombophlebitis for which he was started on Enoxaparin 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].
His initial NCHCT showed a small inferior left frontal IPH with small associated SDH that on repeat imaging that evening appeared to have an interval progression in size (1x2cm to 2x3cm) without any change in neurologic exam.
Per recommendations of [**Hospital3 2568**] Neurology and Neurosurgery, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
On arrival, his examination had improved such that he had quite limited weakness on the right, but moderate-severe dysarthria with nonfluent aphasia.
A repeat NCHCT showed a slight decrease in the size of his IPH and given his overall clinical stability, he was transferred to the neurology floor.
He received a formal speech/swallow evaluation who advanced his diet to regular foods and recommended an extended course of speech rehabilitation which he will continue as an outpatient.
We had recommended a conventional angiogram to obtain a precise picture of his intracranial vasculature out of concern for a vasculitic process versus AVM/vascular anomalies that may explain his parenchmyal hemorrhage.
We performed our own lower extremity ultrasounds which revealed only a chronic right popliteal vein thrombus and a superficial venous thrombus on the left.
On discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 87576**] neurological examination was positive for mild-moderate dysarthria that is comprehensible for the most part.
Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] 2.
Atovaquone 750mg [**Hospital1 **] 5.
Colchicine 0.6mg [**Hospital1 **] 6.
Senna [**Hospital1 **] 9.
Your speech and language has subsequently improved/ - For this bleed, we recommend that you receive a conventional brain angiogram to look for structural causes of your bleeding such as abnormal blood vessel/vascular malformations/vasculitis.
- We feel that you would benefit from an extensive speech therapy program which can be done while you are at home.
