He underwent ETT on day of admission during which he developed SSCP and dyspnea after 2.5 min which was [**6-29**] and progressed to [**10-29**] and then resolved with oxygen after 6 minutes.
He had a cardiac cath at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2-23**] which showed 1 vessel CAD with a distal LM stenosis of 30%, LAD 50% proximal disease, LCx 40% proximal disease.
After stress results patient underwent cath which showed 2 vessel disease with 60-70% LM disease, 70% pLAD, and 70% pLCx.
Prior tobacco abuse of [**2-22**] ppd x 34 years; currently smoking one to [**1-21**] pack cigarettes/day.

Perhaps the patient would be better able to tolerate a CT scan of the brain with resultant less image degradation due to motion artifacts.
[**2137-1-31**] ECHO he left atrium is normal in size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
[**2137-2-5**] Head CT No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute territorial infarction.
Lymph node, mediastinal level five (A):  Mediational poorly differentiated carcinoma with squamous features, present within one lymph node (+[**1-20**]).
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 95516**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2137-1-29**] following an exercise tolerance test for a cardiac catheterization.
Given his history of lung cancer, the thoracic surgery service was consulted for a mediastinal lymph node biopsy at the time of his surgery.
A head MRI was performed to rule out metastatic disease which was not interpretable due to motion artifact.
He was then transferred to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for further recovery.
Haldol was recommended as needed and a head CT was obtained.
The pathology results of Mr. [**Known lastname 95517**] mediastinal lymph node biopsy revealed mediational poorly differentiated carcinoma with squamous features, present within one lymph node (+[**1-20**]).
