The stent was patent and secretions were noted to be moderate.
She was taken urgently for repeat bronchoscopy which showed the stent to remain patent with persistent moderate secretions.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is afebrile with a temperature of 98.9 F, heart rate 108, blood pressure 92/61.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 11.9, hematocrit 30.1, platelet count 522,000.
BUN 20, creatinine 0.8.
Bronchial washings on [**11-21**] showed 3+ polymorphum nuclear lymphocytes and 4+ gram positive coccyx later identified to be methicillin resistant staph aereus.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule out MI.
Bronchoscopy was performed on two separate occasions to ascertain the extent of secretions, presence of mucus plugging or other explanation for respiratory difficulty.
CT scan angiogram of the chest was obtained to rule out PE.
Biopsies of the trachea revealed recurrent non-small cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated.
On [**2197-12-4**] the patient self extubated during an apparent confused episode and became immediately stridorous, anxious and dropped her oxygen saturation to the 80, 70 and 60s despite Ativan, nebulizers and Racemic epinephrine.
A post mortem examination was offered to the family.
She dropped her hematocrit to the low 20s and was transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells.
EGU was performed which showed esophagitis and linear ulcerations in the stomach consistent with NG tube trauma.
There were no further episodes of bleeding and her hematocrit remained stable.
