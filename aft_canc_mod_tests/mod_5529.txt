He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his vitals were T 97.6, HR 120, BP 102/64, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 4L NC.
In the setting of a recent admission to the [**Hospital **] hospital for a pneumonia, and apparently in light of abnormal findings there, patient underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2163-9-22**] at [**Hospital1 18**] through interventional pulmonology which showed normal upper airways.
A CT done on [**9-29**] showed a cavitary lesion continuous with an ulcerated bronchus intermedius.
NSCLC s/p pneumonectomy ([**2151**]) and photodynamic therapy activation and rigid bronchoscopy clean ([**7-11**]) out.
Physical Exam: Vitals - T 97.2 HR 126, BP 105/65, SaO2 95% on 5L General - Chronically ill, thin male laying in bed, in NAD although occasionally coughing up blood-tingled sputum.
Abdomen - soft, NT, ND, +BS Extremities - warm, well perfused, no clubbing/cyanosis/edema.
Psych - pleasant, appropriate  Pertinent Results: PFTs ([**2163-9-29**]): Marked obstructive ventilatory defect.
The reduced FVC is likely due to gas trapping but a coexisting restrictive defect cannot be excluded.
FVC 41% predicted FEV1 27% predicted FEV1/FVC 67% predicted DSB 23% predicted .
CT CHEST ([**2163-9-29**]): 1.
CT FDG PET-CT might be able to localize tumor, but discrimination from the inflammation of the large pocket may be problem[**Name (NI) 115**].
CXR ([**2163-10-8**]): The patient is status post left pneumonectomy, with stable opacification of the left hemithorax and shift of the mediastinum.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia @ rate of 128, some TWI in V5, V6, new as compared to [**2162-2-3**] EKG.
