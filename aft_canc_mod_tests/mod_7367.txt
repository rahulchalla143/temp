Resting hemodynamics revealed mild pulmonary hyptertension with PA pressures 38/14 mmHg.
Cardiac index was low normal at 2.75 L/min/m2 (based on an assumed oxygen consumption).
Although the systemic arterial saturation was low on 4 L/min NC, it rose appropriately with higher concentration oxygen therapy, arguing against significant right-to-left shunting.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
