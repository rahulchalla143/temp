c-spine ct [**2-16**]: 1.
CXR [**2-16**]: AP chest compared to [**2-15**] and [**2-16**] at 12:12 a.m.: With the chin slightly down, the tip of the endotracheal tube at the thoracic inlet is no less than 6 cm from the carina.
chest xray [**2-19**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has improved ventilation, as reflected by larger lung volumes.
LE u/s [**2-20**]:  No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower extremities  CTA [**2-20**] 1.
CT abd [**2-24**]: 1.
Followup CT chest in one year is recommended.
MRI L/T spine [**2-27**]: 1.
Extensive metastases along the thoracolumbar spine, ribs, and the pelvis, corresponding to the lytic lesions described in the recent CTA chest and CT abdomen and pelvis.
CXR [**2-28**]: 1.
Destructive paraspinal mass in the mid thoracic spine, more fully evaluated by previous cross-sectional imaging studies  C-spine x-ray [**3-1**]:  In comparison with study of [**2-20**], there is little change in the corpectomy and posterior fusion spanning C2 through C7.
CT Chest [**3-2**]: 1.
These are much better assessed on the recent MRI of the thoracic spine and lumbar spine, as well as the CTs of the chest and the abdomen and pelvis.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2194-3-6**] 2:16 PM Cardiac size is mildly enlarged.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2194-3-10**] at 11:26:20 AM The left atrium is normal in size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2194-3-10**] 8:28 AM IMPRESSION: No relevant changes compared to [**2194-3-2**].
CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2194-3-11**] 10:33 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2194-3-16**] 8:04 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
-------------------INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300 CELLS-------------------   FISH was performed with a panel Abbot Molecular probes for MM and is interpreted as NORMAL.
MR [**Last Name (Titles) **] W &W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2194-3-21**] 3:01 PM IMPRESSION: Abnormal enhancement of the tympanic and mastoid segments of the left facial nerve.
On [**2-20**] he developed "gurgling" with respirations and Tachypnea to the 30s with mild desaturation to 80 on RA which improved to 97 on 2L NC.
Bedside bronchoscopy performed showed floppy, necrotic, avascular tracheal ring.
Cultures grew only coag neg staph, while CXR failed to show a definite pneumonia.
A CT of the chest from [**3-2**] showed residual tracheitis.
His UA showed a likely UTI and the pt developed hematuria.
The usual workup was completed and once again negative cultures were received.
His eosinophil count was elevated so ID recommended a course of Ivermectin which he completed for possible Strongyloides infection.
An MRI of his internal auditory canal was performed which showed enhancement of the facial nerve.

You were admitted on [**2194-2-16**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of your arm and leg weakness.
You underwent urgent surgery to have hardware placed and a cervical fusion from C2-7.
You were started on heparin to thin your blood and prevent his blood clots from progressing.
