Pertinent Results: OSH STUDIES: CT ABD: large gallstone, thickening of the gallbladder wall and mild dilatation fo the GB, infiltration of RUQ fat c/w inflammatory change.
URINE TOX SCREEN: + benzos and opiates, - PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 57131**], amphetamine, marijuana, barbiturate, tricyclic  ECG REPORT: 'NSR, nonspecific ST/T wave changes.'

BONE MARROW BIOPSY ([**2127-9-18**]): RESULTS: Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize blast yield.
One population, identified within the "blast gate," comprising 80% of gated (17% of total) bone marrow cells expresses immature antigens CD34, HLA-DR, myeloid associated antigens CD33, 13, 11c, and 117, a small subset CD64 and CD71, and lack CD4, 14, and 56.
A second population (95% of gated, 40% of total) expresses HLA-DR, CD33, and 13, along with 11c, 4, 14, 64, 71, and CD15 (subset), but lack CD34 and CD56.
CT ABD/PELV ([**2127-9-19**]): IMPRESSION: 1) Acute cholecystitis with multiple small abscesses in the gallbladder fossa as well as extending into the hepatic parenchyma consistent with a contained perforation.
ECHO/TTE ([**2127-9-26**]): Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
ERCP ([**2127-10-6**]): IMPRESSION: Leak of contrast in the region of the cystic duct in this patient status post cholecystectomy.
CT ABD/PELV ([**2127-10-9**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Peripheral, ill-defined, nodular appearing, bilateral lower lobe opacities, some of which are new and others of which have changed in configuration since the prior exam, suggestive of an inflammatory/infectious or embolic process (either bland or septic emboli).
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2127-9-26**], the transtricuspid gradient is slightly reduced and borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.
The aortic valve gradient is similar and aortic regurgitation is no longer seen.
SKIN BIOPSY (RIGHT FLANK) ([**2127-10-29**]) : DIAGNOSIS: Skin, right flank: Vascular endothelial swelling and sparse interstitial mononuclear infiltrate with occasional eosinophils (see note).
CT ABD/PELV ([**2127-11-4**]): IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of bowel obstruction.
CT HEAD ([**2127-11-4**]): IMPRESSION: Limited study.
BONE MARROW BIOPSY FLOW CYTOMETRY ([**2127-11-10**]): INTERPRETATION: Immunophenotypic findings are non-specific.
AML: On routine labs at the outside hospital, the patient was noted to have an elevated WBC (>60) with blasts (50% of the WBC).
A bone marrow biopsy at [**Hospital1 18**] confirmed acute leukemia of myelomonocytic differentiation.
No bacteria or fungii were ever grown from her blood or urine.
She was prophylaxed with acyclovir (she developed an HSV lesion on her upper lip during her course), vancomycin, along with the empiric fungal (caspofunging or ambisome) and gram negative (which included imipenem, amikacin, cefipime and levofloxacin at different times in her course).
A repeat bone marrow biopsy late in her course was unremarkable and thus, showed no signs of leukemia.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound confirmed obstruction of the gall bladder.
Pathologic analysis showed malignant infilitration (with leukemic cells) of the gallbladder and extrahepatic biliary tree.
A repeat ERCP was pursued and epinephrine injection and biliary stenting resulted in tamponade of the bleeding site and successful diversion of biliary drainage.
The patient had persistence of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting throughout most of her course, but repeat imaging studies did not reveal and obvious source of her symptoms.
A Head CT only showed a nonspecific unilateral internal capsule abnormality.
The patient soon returned to her baseline and further work-up was not pursued.
An HCV viral load was rechecked during recurrent abominal pain, nausea, vomiting and altered mental status: at that point, the viral load was 154,000.
