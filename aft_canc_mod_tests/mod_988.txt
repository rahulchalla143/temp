In the ER, FSBS 133, SBP 140s.
Her gaze progressed from mild to forced right gaze deviation and her speech progressed from mild to unintelligible dysarthria.
Left LE 0/5 proximally and [**3-17**] distally with normal tone.
?L/R: bic [**3-14**], br [**2-11**], tri 0/1; pat [**2-11**], Ach 0/0.
The discrepancy between blood volume and mean transit times raises the question of an ischemic penumbra.
Corresponding to the area of early ischemia is the presence of a right-sided insular ribbon sign on the conventional head CT images.
With regard to the angiography of the neck, neither common carotid bifurcation exhibits hemodynamically significant stenosis, although there was a markedly tortuous proximal right internal carotid artery demonstrated.
CONCLUSION: Findings consistent with large area of prolonged mean transit time, but with a blood volume "mismatch" within virtually the entire right middle cerebral artery territory.
