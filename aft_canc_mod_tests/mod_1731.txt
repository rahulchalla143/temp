With these findings the sensitivity for subtle infarcts is diminished, an MRI could be performed if there is persisting concern for acute infarct.
On [**5-16**] the pt became hypoxemic and CXR demonstrated evidence of RUQ pneumonia and possible pulmonary edema.
Repeat CXR on demonstrated radiographic evidence of increasing consolidation of the RUQ pneumonia with evidence of a new right lower lobe process perhaps secondary to an aspiration event.
