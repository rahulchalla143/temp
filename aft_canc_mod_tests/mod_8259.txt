URINE CULTURE (Pending): .
Radiology: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST; OUTSIDE FILMS READ ONLY Study Date of [**2118-6-3**] 9:50 AM FINDINGS: There is a large left occipitoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring approximately 5.8 x 3.0 cm.
CTA HEAD/NECK W&W/OC & RECONS Study Date of [**2118-6-3**] 4:39 PM FINDINGS: The study is compared with the NECT ([**Hospital3 **]), obtained roughly 9 hours earlier.
No aneurysm is identified in the region or elsewhere in the circle of [**Location (un) 431**], with evaluation of the region of the left MCA bifurcation, limited by the metallic artifact.
The remainder of the examination is notable for fairly severe panlobular emphysema at the lung apices, without discrete bulla formation.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2118-6-3**] 4:57 PM IMPRESSION:  1.
Streaky linear opacities at left base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis given their absence on the comparison study from earlier in the day.
Overall, there are slightly less vascular markings in the upper lungs relative to the lower lungs which suggests a component of underlying emphysema given the patient's history of smoking.
If a lung primary remains of clinical concern, further imaging evaluation with CT should be considered.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2118-6-4**] 2:39 AM FINDINGS: The study is compared with the CTA of the head and neck, obtained roughly 8 hours earlier.
Diffuse sulcal FLAIR-hyperintensity, likely representing subarachnoid blood, more evident than on the recent CT (this is in a non-aneurysmal pattern).
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2118-6-5**] 2:16 AM FINDINGS: There is a large left occipitoparietal parenchymal hemorrhage similar in size and appearance compared to [**2118-6-3**].
This is unchanged from the most recent prior examination of [**2118-6-3**].
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [**2118-6-5**] 11:31 AM FINDINGS:  CT OF THORAX: The thyroid gland is unremarkable and there is no supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
No mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph node enlargement by CT size criteria is present.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The liver is normal in size without evidence of an intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
CT OF THE PELVIS: The urinary bladder, terminal ureters, uterus and adnexa are unremarkable.
Coronal and sagittal images were reviewed, confirming the axial findings.
Cardiology: TTE (Complete) Done [**2118-6-6**] at 10:22:32 AM      FINAL Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], neurological exam was significant for right visual field homonymous hemianopia, alexia without clear agraphia, finger confusion, and color errors and acalculia.
CT showed a large left occipitoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and 2 mm rightward midline shift as well as associated left intraventricular, subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage suggestive of amyloid angiopathy.
CTA showed no evidence of underlying arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm or other vascular anomaly.
CTV showed no evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis.
MRI showed several "micro-bleeds" peripherally-located in the posterior aspect of both cerebral hemispheres with only expected early enhancement of the evolving parenchymal hematoma, with no finding to suggest underlying mass lesion.
Repeat CT was stable after worsening of word-finding difficulties.
She was monitored on telemetry and her examination remained stable thereafter.
Echo showed EF >55% and mild AR with mild valve sclerosis, mild symmetric LVH with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
WBCs and platelets were mildly elevated and UA and chest exam were unremarkable and were felt to be likely reactive to her IPH.
The most likely aetiology was amyloid angiopathy given the multiple bleeding sources and evidence of microbleeds and other imaging findings suggestive of this.
MRI did not show any clear underlying lesion and she had a CT torso which showed no clear evidence of malignancy (This was pursued especially in light of a remote history of melanoma).
She has stroke, neuro-ophthalmology follow-up and repeat MRI booked.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient will need uptitration of her anti-hypertensives with goal BP <140/90 - Plt increase likely reactive and to be trended at rehab - Patient awaits repeat MRI w and w/o contrast on [**2118-7-25**] - Awaits neuro-ophthalmology review and formal visual fields in [**2118-7-8**] - Patient should discuss with PCP regarding cancer screening and f/u (Mammogram, Colonoscopy, Pap etc) and Dermatologist follow up due to history of melanoma - Patient to discuss Chantix with PCP to aid in smoking cessation - Pt was counselled to please avoid aspirin and antiplatelet agents  Medications on Admission: levetiracetam 750mg po bid MVI  Discharge Medications: 1. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Left Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage in the Parieto-Occipital Region with intraventricular, subarachnoid and subdural extension likely secondary to amyloid angiopathy but awaiting repeat MRI to rule out underlying mass lesion .
Neuro Exam at time of Discharge: Alexia without agraphia, acalculia (significantly affected as patient was an accountant), right homonymous hemianopia and no focal limb weakness or other CN abnormality.
You were admitted from an outside hospital after having a bleed on the left side of the brain (in the parietal-occipital area) seen on CT and MRI.
You examination remained stable and your MRI scan showed evidence of "microbleeds" suggesting a diagnosis of amyloid angiopathy (leaky blood vessels which can rupture and cause small or large bleeds in the brain) although an underlying lesion could not be definitievly ruled out.
You had a CT scan of the body which did not show any evidence of tumours.
In addition, you have been referred for a repeat MRI of the head in [**Month (only) **] to have a better look after the blood has absorbed.
You blood pressure was still slightly high on discharge and your blood pressure medications will likely need to be increased at rehab.
