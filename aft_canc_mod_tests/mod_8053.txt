MRa was ordered for further evaluation of this aneurysm.
MRA chest was also done to rule out a calcified aorta.
The possibility of an angiogram +/- coiling was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the INR department.
She continued to require pressors on [**9-8**] and the nimodipine was still being held.
Her SBP was well controlled without the use of pressors or anti-hypertensives.
Her neurological exam remained stable.
Your blood pressure medication was stopped and your pressure has routinely been within normal limits.
We would like your blood pressure to be under 160 systolic.
