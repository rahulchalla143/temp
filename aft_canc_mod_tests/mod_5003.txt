In the ED, He underwent CTA chest and abdomen which no PE but marked progression of metastatic disease including innumerable new metastases in the lungs and liver and increased size of metastases in the adrenals, kidneys, mesentary, soft tissues.
He had negative CT head and EKG.
His hematocrit was 26 from baseline around 30, and INR was 3.6 on admission.
In the ICU, his HCT improved and BP remained stable in the 100's, and HR in the 90-100's.
EGD or further GI workup was refused.
Onc History: Initially found to have a large right sided mass on CXR in [**10-2**] performed for 1 month history of cough.
CT scan confirmed the mass and biopsy of [**Last Name (un) 29217**] nodes were suspicious, but FNA of the primary mass showed likely NSCLC.
He started radiation therapy in [**11-2**] and started cycle 1 of cisplatin/etoposide in [**12-2**] and cycle 2 in [**1-4**].
He was hospitalized for chest pain and found to have a PE in [**1-4**], and started on coumadin.
PET scan in [**2-3**] demonstrated metastatic disease to the adrenals, so he was changed to taxotere therapy in [**3-3**] which he tolerated reasonably well.
NSCLC- former smoker, originally presented to PCP [**10-2**] with cough x 1 mo., CXR with lg R-lung mass, CT showed right upper lobe posterior segment mass abutting the chest wall but not invading with an enlarged upper R paratracheal node and lower R paratracheal node, s/p TBNA of mediastinal LAD [**10-22**] showing highly atypical cells suggestive of NSCLC and CT-guided biopsy of the lung mass [**10-29**] confirming NSCLC, MRI brain negative for met, s/p 2 cycles of cisplatinum/etoposide + XRT (completed [**2128-1-5**]).
Had PET scan 2.
