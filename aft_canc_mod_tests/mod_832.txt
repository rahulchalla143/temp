She was sent down for imaging and CTA was negative and she went home with O2.
CXR demonstrated RLL PNA and she was treated for a pneumonia and presumed CHF.
An ECHO was obtained in setting of CABG and AVR which was unchanged from [**2-26**] except from increasing pulm HTN (possibly likely combination of lung CA, diphragmatic paralysis, h/o XRT when tx'd for thyroid CA).

CXR [**2167-12-27**] Interval development of poorly defined opacities in the lungs bilaterally, most consistent with pneumonia.
CXR [**2167-12-28**] Bilateral basilar infiltrates, suggesting pneumonia.
TTE [**2167-12-28**] The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-2-25**], estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
SOB Pt was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory monitoring given her hypoxia and worsening SOB.
Her anemia was deemed [**12-25**] chronic disease and iron deficiency and she was started on iron supplementation.
After discussion with her outpatient cardiologist, he recommended metoprolol TID, no diuretic therapy (pt with h/o hypotensive episodes while on diuretic therapy) and continuing Cozaar.
