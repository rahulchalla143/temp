Vital signs revealed temperature of 102.2, pulse of 131, blood pressure of 142/63, oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
A palpable spleen tip, and no palpable liver.
Rectal examination was heme-negative brown stool.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories revealed a white blood cell count of 39.5, hematocrit of 18.9, platelets of 177 (25 polys, 3 bands, 65 lymphocytes, 4 monocytes, 2 eosinophils, 1 atypical).
INR of 1.3.
Calcium of 8.9, phosphate of 1.8, magnesium of 2.2.
Sodium of 125, potassium of 4.5, chloride of 92, bicarbonate of 12, blood urea nitrogen of 38, creatinine of 1.8, glucose of 689.
ALT of 13, AST of 34, alkaline phosphatase of 128, LDH of 1563, total bilirubin of 4.3.
Urinalysis revealed less than 1.005 for specific gravity, 100 of protein, glucose of greater than 1000, 0 to 2 red blood cells, 0 to 2 white blood cells, occasional bacteria, and large blood.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia.
He had a rate of 120 with intervals of 148, 86, and 43 with flattened T waves inferiorly, and no ST changes.
Chest x-ray revealed no infiltrate.
On the morning of [**2105-2-15**], the patient's hematocrit had fallen to 12, and the patient's glucose was still under poor control.
There, his electrolytes were aggressively managed.
An arterial blood gas at that time revealed a pH of 7.37, a PCO2 of 25, and PO2 of 106, and a mild lactic acidosis with a lactate level of 2.5.
Serial hematocrits were followed; however, the patient did not develop an increase in his hematocrit.
However, his hematocrit remained at a level of 12.
On the morning of [**2105-2-16**], (at approximately 7:30 in the morning) the patient appeared well with good mental status, stable electrolytes (except for a hematocrit of 12 despited red blood cell infusions).
An arterial blood gas was sent which revealed a PCO2 of 35 and a pH of 7.
His blood pressure fell, and there was no palpable pulse.
A cardiac arrest code was called.
Following the code, a repeat arterial blood gas taken immediately before the patient arrested revealed a lactate level of 11.
The gastrointestinal system was implicated, and the patient was prepared for a CT scan and was also in consultation by the Surgery Service for question of bowel ischemia.
Before the patient could obtain his CT scan, at approximately 2 p.m. in the afternoon while still in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient's heart rate acutely declined from the 130s to the 100s.
His blood pressure remained stable.
Quickly thereafter, his blood pressure and pulse fell again, and the patient suffered another pulseless electrical activity arrest.
In that setting, it was found that his glucose was less than 10.
Potassium was markedly elevated as well.
Another cardiac arrest was called, and the patient was again revived with medications.
His family was with him, and a postmortem examination was performed.
