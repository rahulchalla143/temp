His sensory examination showed a decreased appreciation in the right posterior and lateral chest wall, but otherwise was intact.
His reflexes were normal and symmetric.There was no point tenderness anywhere along the thoracolumbarjunction.
There was no clonus, and Hoffmann reflex was absent.
Pertinent Results: CT of the thoracic spine obtained on [**2184-6-21**] demonstratesa right-sided metastatic lesion that has involved the T9-T10 rib.
An MRI obtained on [**2184-3-1**] demonstrates that same mass.
There does seem to have been some progression between those two studies, although it is difficult to compare MRI to CT.

The tumor cells are predominantly clear and the morphologic appearances are compatible with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (conventional type).
A frozen section is performed on the specimen.
Part 2 is additionally labeled "T8 - T9 renal metastases, permanent."
