Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] performed a biopsy, which revealed high-grade atypia most suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma.
This was following imaging studies including an MRI on [**2190-7-23**] that revealed highly suspicious necrotic lymph nodes along bilateral pelvic nodal chain along with a two-cm mass with papillary surface projecting into the bladder lumen from the right bladder wall highly suspicious for transitional cell carcinoma.
The endometrial curettage showed no evidence of malignancy.
A left vulvar biopsy, however, revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated.
The left groin excision revealed squamous cell carcinoma as well along with acute and chronic inflammation.
Wound culture from that procedure revealed mixed bacterial types.
Vulvar carcinoma: a CXR on [**8-11**] showed some hilar fullness, so a CT scan was done and showed pulmonary nodules c/w metastatic disease.
A repeat CT on [**8-28**] showed increased number and size of pulmonary nodules.
