COMPARISON: No prior study at this institution.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the thorax pre- and post- rapid bolus of 100 ml Optiray IV contrast per the CT angiogram protocol with coronal and sagittal reformats.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There is irregular wall thickening of the mid thoracic esophagus concerning for tumor, which involves an approximately 6 cm long segment.
Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates no significant abnormality.
Emphysema   Brief Hospital Course: Pt was treated for her GI bleed which was thought to be secondary to XRT, chemotherapy, or dexamethasone therapy for her esophageal mass.
Pt monitored with serial Hcts, large bore IVs were placed, and started on Pantoprazole 40mg IV BID.
While pt was in house, she also had her J-tube re-evulated twice for concerns of positioning.
Both gastrofin studies showed good positioning.
