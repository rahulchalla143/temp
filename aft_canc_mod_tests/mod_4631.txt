There are diffuse infiltrates throughout the R lung and small R pleural effusion, ascites, cirrhosis, and enlarged spleen.

Although the vascular engorgement may be physiologic, reflecting the constriction of the vascularity in the left hemithorax, it can represent volume overload  CT CHEST W/ CONTRAST IMPRESSION:  1.
Moderate residual hydropneumothorax with split pleura sign suggesting empyema, which could be confirmed by examination of pleural fluid characteristics.
CXR showed nearly complete white-out of the L lung and OSH CT chest showed large loculated pleural effusion on the left with extensive atelectasis in the residual left lung apex, and occluded left mainstem bronchus.
He also had a CT Chest which showed RLL consolidative mass with right hilar adenopathy concerning for neoplasm, a consolidation of the LLL with complete collapse of the LLL bronchus, and multiple lytic bone lesions in the sternum, scapula and vertebral bodies which suggested a metastatic process.
