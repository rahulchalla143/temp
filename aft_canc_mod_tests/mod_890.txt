Pt initially presented to her PCP for evaluation of persistent fatigue and decreased appetite x 1-2months, and was found to have anemia and abnormal differential on CBC.
Pt underwent a techinically difficult bone marrow biopsy, and pathology showed hypercellular bone marrow with left-shifted granulopoiesis and increased blasts, consistent with AML.

B-lymphocytes show a kappa:lambda raatio of 1:1.
Flow abnormalities that support a dysplastic myeloid population include decreased orthogonal light scatter, decreased CD45 expression, CD11b/CD16 pattern abnormalties, CD13/CD16 pattern abnormalities, and few myelomonocytic cells, CD34-positive blasts are increased,comprising 39% of nucleated cells, and they exhibit the expected immunophenotype for myeloblasts (CD34+, CD13+, CD33+, CD117+, HLA-DR+, and negative for most other markers.)

However, blasts were still present in her bone marrow biopsy and CBC differential after completion of chemotherapy, indicating residual disease.
She had a repeat bone marrow biopsy the day before discharge, the results of which were pending on the day of discharge.
Surveillance blood cx's were negative for four days, after which a PICC was placed.
TTE showed mildly worsened mitral regurgitation, but TEE showed no evidence of endocarditis, mitral valve or otherwise.
Chest CT showed pulmonary nodules concerning for fungal vs. viral infection.
Patient should have repeat Chest CT I- high resolution 1 week after discharge to assess for stability/interval change of pulmonary nodules.
Patient's blood pressure was 148-150s systolic on discharge with the initiation of calcium channel blocker and increase in beta-blocker.
Your hospital course was complicated by a blood stream infection, which required a brief stay in the intensive care unit.
You will need to have some lab tests checked when you see your oncologist next week.
