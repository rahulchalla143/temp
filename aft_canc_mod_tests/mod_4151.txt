Anemia: Hct at admission was 14 with associated symptoms such as SOB, CP, weakness; his Hct increased appropriately after receiving transfusions.
He was monitored in the ICU for possible hemodynamic instability while awaiting EGD and colonoscopy to evaluate the source of his bleeding.
EGD demonstrated angioectasias in the 2nd part of the duodenum which was the likely source of blood loss - a clip was placed in this region.
Restarted outpatient diuretics once Hct and BP were stable.
This was improved with IVF and blood transfusions - creatinine trended towards his baseline of 1.3.
