[**2156-9-4**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: Ventriculomegaly, which has decreased since the previous study of [**2155-8-24**].
If the patient has prior outside studies, comparison would be helpful as there are no studies earlier than [**2156-8-18**] at [**Hospital1 18**].
She was taken to the OR on that date for laminectomies of T4-T5 and resection of her intradural, extramedullary mass that was found on MRI scan of the thoracic spine which was obtained during her prior admission.
In the end of the operation, we saw improvement of SSEPs to almost normal stage on the left and the motor potentials were unchanged compared to preoperative.
