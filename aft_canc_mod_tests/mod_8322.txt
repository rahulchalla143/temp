Blood cultures were negative.
Ruled out for TB with AFB negative x 3 induced sputums.
CT this admission showed ileus but no obstruction.
# Anemia:  HCT 25 on admission (down from baseline 29-30).
Guaic positive on admission but hematocrit stabilized with 2 units PRBC and has remained 29-30 x days.
Thus, consider outpatient C-scope and EGD for further work-up, if patient wishes (discussed with daughter).
Of note, iron studies at this time, do not reflect iron deficiency.
# Hypertension:  Blood pressure high in house, but patient was not receiving her minitran.
