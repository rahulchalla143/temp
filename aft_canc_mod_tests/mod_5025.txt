Imaging: CXR [**2118-12-1**]: 1.
EKG [**12-1**]: Sinus bradycardia.
GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2118-12-2**]  GI BLEEDING STUDY  Reason: LOCALIZE GI BLEED  HISTORY: 63-year-old on Coumadin, now passing blood clots per rectum.
DECISION:  INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were obtained.
Dynamic blood pool images show focal uptake of tracer in the region of the hepatic flexure within the initial 10 minutes of the study.
Blood flow images show normal flow.
Selective celiac and SMA arteriogram were performed at anterior-posterior and lateral projections.
Based on the diagnostic findings, no further intervention was needed at this moment.
IMPRESSION: Selective celiac axis, superior mesenteric arteriogram demonstrated no extravasation of contrast.
GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2118-12-4**]  GI BLEEDING STUDY  Reason: P/W BRBPR-PLEASE ASSESS GI BLEED  HISTORY: bright red blood per rectum  INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 30 minutes were obtained.
Dynamic blood pool images show prompt appearance of tracer activity in the right upper quadrant in a similar distribution to the prior study.
Blood flow images show tracer within the expected course of the abdominal vasculature.

EKG [**12-7**]: Sinus bradycardia Short PR interval Nonspecific intraventricular conduction defect Inferior infarct - age undetermined LVH with ST-T changes No change from previous .
EKG [**12-10**]: Atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular response, rate 118.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2118-12-9**] cardiac rhythm is now atrial fibrillation.
RENAL U.S.  [**2118-12-12**] 11:54 AM  RENAL U.S.  Reason: obstruction  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 63 year old woman with CAD s/p MI, CHF, massive LGIB s/p 19 units of prbcs, now with ARF cr 0.8->1.9 in setting of labile HTN.
LAB DATA: RECIPIENT ABO/RH: B POSITIVE UNIT (04FS82305) ABO/RH: B POSITIVE Antibody screen: NEGATIVE Plasma color pre and post transfusion: Icteric, copper-colored LABS: post transfusion= 30.1 Other labs from [**2118-12-12**]: WBC=11.9, PLT=232 BUN=23, Creat=1.9, LD=1855, CK=228, total bili=2.2, indirect=1.8, direct bili=0.4, haptoglobin=<20.
Urine: color=red with 6-10 WBC and [**5-6**] RBC, prot/creat=1.6,  DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The patient experienced isolated hematuria 3 hours and 45 minutes after receiving 375 cc of B positive compatable blood.
The post transfusion antibody screen and DAT were negative and the post transfusion plasma had an icteric, copper color.
Repeat testing of antibody screen and direct antiglobulin test (DAT) would be warrented if continued hemolysis occurs without other found causes.
EKG [**12-20**]: Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2118-12-10**] cardiac rhythm now sinus mechanism.
Colonoscopy [**2118-12-4**]: Indications: Gastrointestinal bleeding with positive tagged RBC scan at hepatic flexure  Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
A physical exam was performed.
The digital exam was normal.
The cecum, appendiceal orifice, and ileocecal valve were identified.
A large adherent blood clot of was visualize at the hepatic flexure.
The blood clot was mobilized with irrigation and with the colonoscope.
A large adherent blood clot of was visualize at the hepatic flexure.
Recommendations: Angiogram +/- selective embolization of arteries supplying hepatic flexure.
Patient will need repeat colonoscopy for polypectomies after acute GI bleeding has resolved.
A physical exam was performed.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 63 yo woman w/ CAD, labile HTN, CHF (mildly depressed EF, 1+AR, 2+MR), Afib, PVD, FM, breast CA in remission, s/p NSTMI in [**10-31**] c/b pulmonary edema, s/p 2 stents to D1 and LCx (failed), also c/b strep viridans endocarditis admitted with massive GI bleed.
Patient's hct on admission was 25->20.
At that time patient also had substernal chest pressure x 1 hr that resolved spontaneously.
Patient is s/p 2 positive tagged cell scan at hepatic flexure and colonoscopy showing a clot at the hepatic flexure.
Angiogram was negative, last bleed on [**2118-12-5**].
Surgical evaluation felt that patient was not a surgical candidate at the time.
On the floor, the patient had labile HTN with BP ranging 180s-200s.
ACEI was discontinued and the patient's medications where tapered for a goal SBP of 160s.
Her Hct drifted below 30 without any evidence of ongoing GI bleeding (although she remained guaiac +).
With these transfusions, however, the patient did not substantially increase her Hct and persistently remained with a Hct ~25-26.
Her urine remained dark and the workup for hemolysis began since patient had elevated LDH to [**2112**], haptoglobin <20 and elevated bilirubin to ~2.5.
Urine hemosiderin was persistently negative suggesting an extravascular process.
[**Doctor Last Name 17012**] body preparation was negative and G6PD assay was within normal limits.
Her blood smear remained inconclusive with rare schistocytes, bite cells and spherocytes.
It was also postulated that the patient may be hemolyzying due to sulfa drugs since she also received lasix with her blood transfusion.
Her last bleed was on [**12-5**] without any further episodes.
Her hematocrit was maintained >30 given her recent history of myocardial infarction, this required a total of 19 units of blood while she was monitored in the intensive care unit.
Two tagged red cell scans localized the bleed to the hepatic flexure.
Later on patient experience chest tightness with shortness of breath in the setting of Hct ~25.
Her blood pressures varied b/w 120s-190s.
As such, permissive hypertension was allowed with goal SBP ~ 160.
Upon discharge, however, with recovery of her Cr, she was controlled more closely with BP ~130-140.
Her clonidine path, Hydral and ACEI and Aldactone were all discontinued.
Patient s/p transfusion reaction screen - no evidence of immune mediated hemolysis however could be false negative.
The patient should have a micro coombs assay sent as outpatient as the clinical suspicion for a COOMBS  + alloimmune  hemolytic anemia remaisn high as the patient seemed to only hemolyze in the setting of red cell transfusion.
Surveillance cultures were negative and as such she was not restarted on penicillin.
Barium swallow was performed which showed showing distal narrowing and delayed emptying at the level of the GE junction (see results section).
EGD was performed that did not show any lesions/masses, not consistent with achalasia.
H. pylori testing was negative.
An esophageal manometry study is scheduled as an outpatient.
F/E/N: Cardiac diet/soft mechanical, monitored and replaced lytes as needed .
