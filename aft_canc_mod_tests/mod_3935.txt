[**2163-4-21**]   CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: There is no sign for the presence of an intracranial hemorrhage.
Upper GI bleed The patient has a history of GI bleeding and had a normal EGD in the past several months per report.
There she underwent two EGDs which demonstrated normal esophagus and normal duodenum, but showed three polypoid lesions in the stomach, one of which had stigmata of bleeding; she underwent epinephrine injection and cauterization to this area.
Her HCT was stable after this, and she had no further episodes of hematemesis.
GI recommended a repeat EGD in [**3-20**] months, and a colonoscopy for age appropriate screening.
A head CT was negative.
A regimen of a fentanyl patch (25mcg q3 days), MSSR (60 [**Hospital1 **]), amitryptiline (10 qhs), gabapentin (900 tid), and 4-8mg oral dilaudid q6h prn for breakthrough was finally arrived at.

It is very important for you to get a repeat "EGD" within [**3-20**] months to re-evaluate your GI tract.
Talk with him about your pain management, getting a repeat "EGD" within 3-6 months, and getting a routine screening colonoscopy.
You should ask about seeing a GI specialist at [**Hospital1 2177**] so your care is all coordinated, or you can follow up at the [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital **] clinic.
