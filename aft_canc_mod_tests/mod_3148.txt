Her last INR was 1.3 last [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the patient.
CAD s/p STEMI [**11-16**] with 2VD s/p DES in LAD, POBA D1 with BMS to mid D1.
no illicits   Family History: no cad, mother died of cancer, no sudden death  Physical Exam: Blood pressure was 160/102 mm Hg while supine.
Pulse was 95 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 28 breaths/min.
The neck was supple with JVP of ~6cm.
Anterior and lateral lung exam revealed mild expiratory wheezing at the left lung base.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th intercostal space, mid clavicular line.
Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue revealed subcutaneous induration from Lovenox injections.

IMAGING/STUDIES: [**2122-4-9**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION: 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to dyskinesis of the inferior free wall and posterior wall, and severe hypokinesis of the inferior septum and lateral wall.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-10-20**], left ventricular contractile function is significantly worse.
Coronary angiography of this left dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
Hemodynamic evaluation revealed normal right sided filling pressures (mean RA was 5 mm Hg and RVEDP was 6 mm Hg).
Pulmonary artery pressures were normal (PA pressure was 20/10 mm Hg).
Left sided filling pressures were low (mean PCW pressure was 3 mm Hg).
The patient was subsequently started on pressors and transfused with blood and the left sided filling pressures rose (mean PCW pressure increased to 18 mm Hg).
Systemic arterial pressures were normal on pressors (aortic pressure was 130/8 mm Hg).
Cardiac output was normal on pressors (CI was 2.9 L/min/m2).
TTE revealed EF 30% which was significantly depressed from prior Echo reports.
Hematology was consulted to weight in on Pt's predisposition to clot.
This was felt to be multifactorial (gut GVHD, poor access and difficult blood draws for INR checks).
Post-cath, she remained hemodynamically stable, but still required an additional 3U PRBC's over the next 3 days to maintain HCT >28.
By discharge, her blood pressures were controlled in SBP 120-140's with Toprol XL 100 [**Hospital1 **], Lisinopril 5 QD, and her Hct was 36.8. .
CT scan negative for RP bleed.
Repeat U/S 48 hrs later revealed no fistula.
Stool negative for C. diff.
UCx grew GNR and speciation was E. coli sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
