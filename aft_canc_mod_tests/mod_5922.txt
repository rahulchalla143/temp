He had been doing well in [**Month (only) 1096**], and his prednisone dose was decreased at that time from 15 mg daily to 10 mg daily.
He was due for an IVIg treatment on [**1-8**], but at that appointment, it was noted that his Creatinine had risen up to 1.9, which had been a gradual increase over the prior 6 months.
He did have a C-spine MRI last week that showed a large disk compressing the cord at C4/5.

Pertinent Results: Radiologic Data: MRI C-spine: Extensive degenerative changes of the cervical spine with severe canal stenosis at C4/5.
Renal US: LIMITED LIVER ULTRASOUND: The liver shows no focal or textural abnormalities.
Color Doppler demonstrates patent and anterograde portal venous flow.
Correlation with chest CT recommended.
Soft tissue changes identified at the level of upper aspect of the postoperative change with indentation on the posterior aspect of the oropharyngeal airway, thickening of the right aryepiglottic fold, and obliteration of the right piriform sinus could be related to surgery but are slightly unusual in position and direct inspection is recommended to exclude focal abnormality.
This finding is new since the previous cervical spine MRI of [**2149-1-11**].

His neurologic exam is notable for diffuse weakness, worse distally than proximally though with bilateral IP involvement.
Cervical myelopathy: The patient was admitted to the neurology service as his exam suggested an upper motor neuron pattern of weakness (consistent with spinal cord compromise more than his known CIDP), for consideration of surgery.
Orthopedics evaluated him (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1352**]) after an MRI showed cord compression in the upper cervical cord.
Surgery was recommended, but as his platelets dropped during the admission, surgery was felt to be unsafe until his platelets could be stablized.
Surgery was uncomplicated and blood loss was only 50cc.
His platelets remained stable for 48 hours after the procedure (80-100,000 range) but on post-op day three dropped to 72,000...
He was hydrated and electrolytes normalized, as renal function overall improved.
Renal consults followed him initially and renal u/s was normal; they signed off once renal function improved with hydration.On discharge, his Cr returned to its baseline.
Respiratory illness On post-op day 3 following the discectomy and fusion (decompression of spinal cord), he was found to be febrile to 103.5 axillary, with low level of responsiveness and sats in the low 80s (80-82%), tachypneic on exam with rhonchorous lung sounds, and no improvement with high-flow nasal cannula.
He was placed on non-rebreather O2 and sats increased to high 90s; ABG was: pH 7.40 pCO2 46 pO2 123 HCO3 30 BaseXS 2.
CTPA and CT of the neck were ordered which showed no post-surgical abscess and no PE but confirmed a bilateral consolidation consistent with a significant aspiration pneumonia.
Myelodysplastic syndrome: Platelets dropped during the admission and after consult with hematology, etiology was felt to be chronic ITP, likely kept at bay with the IVIG infusions he had received as an outpatient for the CIDP.
Platelets rose to an acceptable level for operation by [**1-30**] and he was taken to the OR after IVIG and platelet infusion.
Platelets dropped to 72,000 on [**2-1**].
he had a bone marrow biopsy on this admission - this was not consistent with a myelodysplastic syndrome.
Blood sugars were within goal range, in general.
Rheumatology was consulted who recommended: - 2 days of prednisone 40mg - colchicine 3x/week - recheck his uric acid level in 1 month (it was 7.1 on [**2149-2-3**]) - by discharge, his knee and L 1st MTP were improved.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**12-25**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed.
