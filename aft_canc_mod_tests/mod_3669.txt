CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2140-8-16**] 6:33 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-4**] through [**8-13**]: Lung volumes remain low and atelectasis at the left base _____ a region of scarring is the only focal pulmonary abnormality clearly visible.
In reviewing prior chest radiographs I note that the pre-operative study on [**2140-8-4**] may show a 1-cm wide pulmonary nodule projecting over the third left anterior interspace.
Evaluation with CT scanning would be needed, best obtained when lung volumes have improved and the patient has recovered from surgery.
