At [**Hospital 46516**] Hospital, urine culture at that time was positive for E. coli.
The patient was intubated for airway protection at the outside hospital and taken to their Intensive Care Unit, where he was treated with Zosyn, Vancomycin, and Flagyl with a diagnosis of septic shock, Clostridium difficile, and blood cultures subsequently grew out Staph coag negative organisms on [**2177-2-26**] which were thought to come from an indwelling PICC line.
Chest x-ray revealed bibasilar infiltrates and sputum revealed Staphylococcus aureus [**3-4**] and there was some concern for aspiration given the patient's poor mental status.
A random cortisol level was drawn at that time and was 18.
Patient was given hydrocortisone for borderline hypoadrenalism with improved blood pressures.
Abdominal and pelvic CT scan revealed bilateral pneumonia, no abscess, 3.5 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm, 1-1.5 cm paratracheal lymph nodes, mild asymmetry of the breast tissue on the right, splenomegaly with small posteroinferior infarct.
Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 55%, no wall motion abnormalities, no vegetations, but was a limited study.
Alpha fetoprotein and CA-99 were negative.
A trial of Clinoril was performed with no improvement of the patient's fevers.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for workup of his fever of unknown origin and treatment of his pneumonia, Clostridium difficile colitis, and urinary tract infection.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs: 127/60, heart rate 77, respirations 28, O2 saturation 95% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, fewer referred upper airway sounds.
Abdominal examination:  Obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, no rebound or guarding, 2 cm palpable mass.
LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 21.5, hematocrit 35.5, platelets 21.6, neutrophils 61%, lymphocytes 7.4%, monocytes 0.4%, atypical lymphocytes 2%.
Sodium 139, potassium 4.0, chloride 104, bicarbonate 26, BUN 16, creatinine 0.7, glucose 121, LDH 1,522.
Numerous blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputums taken on admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit service and a workup for fever of unknown origin ensued.
The cause of his persistently high fevers were thought to be most likely infectious, but given the patient's extremely high LDH levels and some lymphadenopathy noted on CT scan at the outside hospital, the possibility of malignancy was also considered and Hematology/Oncology consult was also requested.
CTA of the chest was a limited study due to the patient's habitus, but revealed numerous mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, multiple paratracheal lymph nodes, the largest of which was 1 cm in diameter.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a splenic infarct, which was known from outside hospital.
But given the possibility of malignancy, it was thought that tissue biopsy would be appropriate.
Patient also had an abdominal ultrasound performed to check for any lymphangitic involvement of the liver given the patient's mildly elevated LFTs.
Ultrasound revealed an enlarged liver, but no focal masses were seen.
Patient also had a CT scan of the head performed given the patient's mental status change and given the patient's history of prostate cancer, and right MCA stroke, it was desired to determine that there was no intracranial process that was contributing to his condition.
CT scan revealed only evidence of chronic infarctions involving the right anterior division of the MCA with a small posterior left frontal infarction which were all thought to be old.
Patient's numerous blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures remained no growth to date.
The patient also had fungal cultures grown which were negative.
EBV and CMV studies were also done which were negative.
Wound culture was positive for only 2+ PMNs.
The Renal team joined the patient's numerous consultants and patient was placed on pressors for the hypotension and patient was continued on D5 half normal saline on bicarbonate with some improvement in renal function, but arterial blood gas revealed the following numbers:  7.03, 31, and 147 at that time.
