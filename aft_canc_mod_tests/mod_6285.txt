CXR done in the OSH ER showed (by report only) a very large left mid and lower lobe infiltrate with air fluid level suggesting emypema.
CT chest (report) showed complex, large [**Location (un) 21851**] in mediastinum obliterating L main PA, L main bronchus, and resulting in near complete opacification of mid-to-lower left lung.
Osteoarthritis 7.

The bronchoscope could not be  advanced past this obstruction.
A biopsy of the occlusive airway lesion revealed a non small cell lung cancer.
A CT scan was done which showed central left upper lobe Mass contiguous with a mediastinal lymph node conglomeration, most consistent with advanced lung cancer.
A flexible bronchoscopy was done at the bedside- the stent was patent and secretions were aspirated.
A flexible bronch was again performed at the bedside for therapeutic aspiration of secretions.
