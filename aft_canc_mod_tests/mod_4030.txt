Following her gyn oncology appointment yesterday, she was sent for CT of the abdomen and pelvis.
There is no evidence of obstruction with passage of contrast beyond this point and lack of upstream dilation.
LLL 5 mm subpleural nodule, given underlying malignancy close interval follow-up is recommended.
Evaluation of uterus and adnexa is limited given technique, correlation with MR or US is recommended."
The decision was made to directly admit the patient for further workup including paracentesis.
Stage IC borderline mucinous tumor of the left ovary, treated with BSO and biopsy as above.
Colonoscopy was performed last year.
Physical Exam: At the time of admission:  98.4, 110, 142/82, 20, 96% RA no I/O recorded yet Gen: awake and alert, sitting up at side of bed, well appearing CV: regular rhythm, tachy lungs: CTAB ant and post, good inspiratory effort back: no CVAT abd: soft, NT, +distended, tympanic to percussion superiorly bilaterally, well healed vertical midline scar, +bs GU: no VB Extr: nontender, nonedematous  Pertinent Results: [**2146-11-9**] 03:50PM   CEA-3.3 CA125-275* [**2146-11-9**] 03:50PM   WBC-17.3* RBC-4.31# HGB-13.0# HCT-38.9# MCV-90 MCH-30.2 MCHC-33.4 RDW-14.1 [**2146-11-9**] 03:50PM   PLT COUNT-536* [**2146-11-9**] 03:50PM   PT-12.3 PTT-22.1 INR(PT)-1.0 [**2146-11-9**] 03:50PM   UREA N-9 CREAT-0.6 SODIUM-136 POTASSIUM-4.1 CHLORIDE-95* TOTAL CO2-26 ANION GAP-19 [**2146-11-9**] 03:50PM   GLUCOSE-108* .
[**2146-11-17**] CT scan Final Report INDICATION: 55-year-old woman with symptoms consistent with recurrent ovarian cancer.
COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast [**2146-11-9**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis were obtained with and without IV contrast.
Multiplanar reformatted images (axial,coronal, sagittal) were generated.
FINDINGS:  CT ABDOMEN: The visualized lung bases show evidence of small bilateral pleural effusions.
At the junction of segments V and VI of the right lobe of the liver, there is a 25 x 25 mm well-demarcated, low-density lesion which has not changed in size, previously measuring 25 x 25 mm.
In the lower pole of the right kidney, there is a 12 x 9.8 mm well-circumscribed hypodensity (2, 34) with attenuation coefficient of 36.5.
This is unchanged in size from that noted on prior CT scan.
CT OF THE PELVIS: Ascitic fluid is noted within the pelvis, obscuring contours of the pelvic organs.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis of [**2146-11-16**].
[**2146-11-19**] SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST  REASON FOR EXAM: Followup lung abnormalities.
Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
Extensive alveolar diffuse opacities and consolidations have worsened consistent with worsening severe pulmonary edema.
[**2146-11-20**] SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST  REASON FOR EXAM: Severe ARDS.
Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the gyn oncology service for further work up of her ascites, abd pain, and nausea and vomiting.
She underwent paracentesis on HD#2 which led to drainage of 3000cc of ascitic fluid.
At attempt was made to obtain an MRI of the abdomen and pelvis but the pt was unable to tolerate the procedure.
A pelvic US [**11-12**] revealed a heterogeneous endometrium consistent with appearance in [**2142**] and a large amount of complex ascites.
HD#5 the pt was to undergo a biopsy of an abdominal nodule but this area was felt to be a hernia at time of biopsy and no biopsy was performed.
HD#6 a mammogram was done to evaluate the right breast nodule and it was felt to be benign.
HD#7 the pt underwent another CT abd/pelvis due to worsening abd sx which revealed a partial SBO.
She had an EKG which was unremarkable except for sinus tachycardia and a normal CXR.
Anesthesia had noted a small amount of aspiration at the time of intubation and a bronchoscopy was done which revealed a small amount of aspirate and this was suctioned.
She was given deep, high pressure breaths and 2units of PRBCs were pushed to improve the hypotension and likely hypovolemia given the 5 liters of ascites removed.
She was noted to be in shock and a CXR revealed signficant bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS.
CXR showed radiographic improvement of lung opacities bilaterally the following day, however the patient remained hypoxic with multiple pressor requirement.
