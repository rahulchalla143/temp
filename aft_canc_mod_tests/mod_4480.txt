C. diff toxin x3 negative.
Guaic stool negative x3.
# Port clot: Angio study and stripping of fibrin sheath done [**2123-12-16**].

CT scan of the abdomen showed increased fluid in your abdomen (ascites) and you underwent a paracentesis (drainage of fluid from the abdomen).
A CT scan of the chest showed a pulmonary embolus (blood clot in the lung) in addition to the pneumonia.
The blood clot was very small and its age was unclear.
Your white blood cell count was low due to chemotherapy and a medication called G-CSF (Neupogen) was given to help this.
A swallow evaluation was normal.
Neutra-phos 3x a day for low phosphorous levels.
Your phosphorous levels should be monitored and this can be stopped when it is normal.
