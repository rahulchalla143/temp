Ultrasound was negative for DVT.
Bone marrow biopsy at that time was suggestive of myelofibrosis.
He has a hematocrit baseline ~30-31 and platelet baseline 150.
Past Medical History: - "lazy eye" - s/p Pneumovax, a meningococcal vaccine, flu shot in fall [**2149**]   Social History: Non-smoker; previously drank alcohol socially, however has not been drinking since [**52**]/[**2149**].

Prophylactic acyclovir, fluconazole and cipro were started per protocol as well as cyclosporine.
On day +34, patient's chimerism results returned 45% donor cells despite an ANC of 50.
The patient's ANC did improve on [**3-27**] to a peak of 198.
Acyclovir was initiated at the time of admission, but was held when his Cr rose above 1.5.
A CXR at the time demonstrated some increased opacities, so Metronidazole was added with resolution of his fever and hypoxia, but he spiked again on [**3-12**].
He remained afebrile afterwards, but had several episodes of hypothermia with a nadir of 94.4.
An infectious work-up was negative and the patient never exhibited hemodynamic instability.
He was started on Ambisome on [**5-8**] for positive yeast culture in blood and urine.
He was noted to be in DIC with platelets below 10.
He had developed acute on chronic renal failure, lactic acidosis of 11.7, acidemia with pH 6.95 and was intubated for a respiratory rate near the 40s.
At that time, the patient was given a dose of Lasix & a single dose of Acyclovir and his Cr began to rise again reaching a peak of 2.3.
Renal was re-consulted and, based on a bland urine sediment, felt that this was a new injury not consistent with ATN.
On [**4-19**], patient's creatinine was noted to be trending upwards again, likely in the setting of having re-started his cyclosporine.
Just prior to his death, he developed acute renal failure in the setting of sepsis with a creatinine 3.3.
A CT abdomen and pelvis was negative for acute retroperitoneal bleed.
Stool was documented as gauiac negative and hematocrit stabilized, and an IV PPI was discontinued.
Patient was transfused as needed with blood products, though hematocrit drops appeared to be mostly related to marrow suppression.
He was reintubated according to his wishes the night prior to his death due to respiratory distress with a rate in the 40s.
Prior to transfer back to the floor one week later, the patient had a repeat Echocardiogram which showed mild improvement in EF to 35%.
He did not undergo CT at that time, given his contraindications to IV or PO contrast (renal failure and nausea/vomiting, respectively).
He underwent a non-contrast abdominal CT which ruled out perforation or major bleed but did show large volume ascites, likely secondary to heart failure, and massive splenomegaly, which were both likely the major contributors to his pain.
