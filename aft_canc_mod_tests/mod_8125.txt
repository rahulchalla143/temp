Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal-to-hyperdynamic (LVEF>60%).
[**Month/Year (2) 4338**] [**10-8**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Complex, multilocular right frontal intra-axial mass, now demonstrating a cystic hemorrhagic component, inferiorly, corresponding to the recent CT studies, but new in comparison to the most recent cranial MR of [**2171-7-15**].
[**10-17**] CXR FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with a preceding similar study obtained 12 hours earlier during the same date.
The next previous examination suggested atelectasis - density in the left base cannot be evaluated because of technical _____ of the present study (motion blurring).
