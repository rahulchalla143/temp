Flow was obtained and dynamic images were then obtained for 40 minutes.
[**5-17**] KUB: Residual contrast material, presumably from the CT study of [**2107-5-7**] is seen at the hepatic flexure, the splenic flexure, and the distal sigmoid/rectum.
Comparison with the previous study done [**2107-5-16**].
Pathology [**5-13**]: Left ovary and fallopian tube (A-D): Ovary with serous cyst adenofibroma, 0.5cm, and endosalpingiosis.
2) Renal failure: Post-operatively, her creatinine rose to 1.6.
Renal scan was not consistent with ureteral leak and renal ultrasound was without evidence of obstruction.
Her creatinine on discharge was 1.4; this should be closely monitored as an outpatient to ensure downward trend.
Her INR will need to be closely monitored as an outpatient and coumadin dose titrated as needed for an INR [**3-12**].
Minitran 0.1 mg/hr Patch 24 hr Sig: One (1) patch Transdermal once a day: apply in am, off in bedtime  to start [**5-23**] if BP still not controlled.
Coumadin 3 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: titrate to INR [**3-12**].
