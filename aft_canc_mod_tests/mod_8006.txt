No CT evidence of large intracranial mass.
However, for evaluation of subtle metastases, gadolinium-enhanced MRI is superior.
Recommend correlation with prior imaging and clinical history if available and possible MRI evaluation as previously suggested.

LENIs were negative for DVT.
Echo revealed Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
MRI and CT of spine revealed no cord compression.
Neuro exam was inconsistent during hospital stay, so thought to be component of somatization.
There was discussion of obtaining CT abd to evaluate the lumbar plexus, but neuro and radiology determined little utility in obtaining scan.
No evidence of occult infection by history, exam or chest imaging.
Urine cultures were negative.
Blood cultures were negative.
Creatinine remained normal.
ENT recommending MRI sinuses to evaluate h/o L ethmoidal fibrosarcoma, which did not show evidence of local recurrence.
