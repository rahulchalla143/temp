The symptoms continued, so the patient presented to an outside hospital ([**Hospital1 2436**]) on [**6-29**] where a CT scan of brain revealed B/L basal ganglial masses with B/L vasogenic edema and mild mass effect with mild subfalcine herniation.
The patient was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgery evaluation.
A CT scan showed progression of mass effect and she was admitted to the SICU.
A subsequent MRI showed multifocal ring enhancing lesions strongly suggestive for Toxoplasmosis.
The patient was subsequently given mannitol in the SICU, and started on empiric pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin for toxo, and a brain biopsy was done showing bradyzoites (confirming toxo infection).
The patient also had a CD4 count sent with 2, and a subsequent positive [**Doctor First Name **] HIV test with pending western blot.
MMSE > 25.
Psych:  Anxious   Pertinent Results: Toxo IgG by EIA 232 IU/mL; IgM negative CMV IgG, IgM negative Cryptococcal Ag negative EBV IgG Positive; IgM negative CMV viral load negative RPR non reactive  [**2186-6-30**] 03:16AM   WBC-3.5* RBC-4.59 HGB-11.1* HCT-34.8* MCV-76* MCH-24.3* MCHC-32.0 RDW-12.7  Pathology Report - Brain Biopsy ([**2186-6-30**]):  Moderately hypercellular brain with mixed inflammatory cells and organisms most consistent with toxoplasma bradyzoites.
MRI Head w/wo Contrast ([**2186-6-30**]):  Thin walled ring enhancing lesions within the basal ganglia and right parietal lobe with vasogenic edema resulting in mild rightward subfalcine herniation.
Thallium SPECT scan can be performed for further evaluation if clinically warranted.
CT Chest ([**2186-7-6**]):  1.
Rectal Swab ([**2186-7-6**]):  MRSA positive BCx 1 of 2 bottles ([**2186-7-5**]): Gram + cocci in clusters CMV IgG positive ([**2186-7-7**]) Cryptococcal Antigen negative ([**2186-7-7**])    Brief Hospital Course: Upon arriving to the ED, the patient actutely decompensated with GCS from 15 to 9.
A CT scan showed progression of mass effect and she was admitted to the SICU.
A subsequent MRI showed multifocal ring enhancing lesions strongly suggestive for Toxoplasmosis.
The patient was subsequently given mannitol in the SICU, and started on empiric pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin for toxo, and a brain biopsy was done showing bradyzoites (confirming toxo infection).
The patient also had a CD4 count sent with 2, and a subsequent positive [**Doctor First Name **] HIV test with pending western blot.
Thyroid nodule: First noticed on chest CT scan to evaluate her lungs.
You had a brain biopsy done, that confirmed that you had an infection called Toxoplasmosis.
Your brother consented for an HIV test while you were intubated, which turned out to be positive.
