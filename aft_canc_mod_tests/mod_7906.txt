Admission Date:  [**2126-7-29**]     Discharge Date: [**2126-8-22**]   Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dark urine and painful skin lesions.
The patient was status post a bone marrow biopsy on [**2126-6-18**] that showed decreased erythroid elements with occasional dysplastic forms and decreased myeloid elements with limited maturation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   The patient's vital signs on presentation were as follows; temperature was 100.6, heart rate was 88, respiratory rate was 24, blood pressure was 107/63, oxygen saturation was 97% on 2 liters.
The patient's physical examination on presentation was as follows; in general, he was a pale-appearing elderly male.
His head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed sclerae were anicteric.
His heart examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur.
His back revealed no costovertebral angle tenderness.
His rectal examination revealed occult-blood positive brown stool.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   His laboratories on admission were as follows; complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 3.9, his hematocrit was 19.8, with a mean cell volume of 87.
Of note, the patient had a hematocrit of 25.8 three days prior to admission.
His platelet count was 15.
The differential of his white blood cell count was as follows; 27% polys, no bands, and 51% lymphocytes.
His Chemistry-7 was as follows; sodium was 132, potassium was 2.7, chloride was 98, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 30, creatinine was 1.4, and blood glucose was 105.
The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.1 to 1.2.
The patient's coagulations were as follows; PT was 15.2, PTT was 41.9, INR was 1.6.
The patient had a reticulocyte count that was sent in the Emergency Department and came back at 0.7.
His urinalysis revealed brown cloudy urine, with large blood; it was nitrite positive, protein was greater than 300, glucose was negative, ketones were trace, there was a small amount of bilirubin, a moderate amount of leukocyte esterase; his red blood cell count was greater than 1000 with 3 to 5 white blood cells and many bacteria.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent from the Emergency Department on [**7-29**] which were negative.
It was unclear whether the patient's presentation with pancytopenia was secondary to blasts crisis; although, this was felt to be unlikely given that he has had a recent bone marrow biopsy which was negative for blasts, and his peripheral smear was also negative for blasts.
His coagulopathy was treated with transfusions of fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K.  On [**7-30**], the patient was seen by his outpatient hematologist who questioned whether the patient's skin lesions and hematuria could be secondary to septic emboli.
The patient was ordered to get a transthoracic echocardiogram which he refused on several occasions.
A disseminated intravascular coagulation screen was sent off and found to be positive.
They recommended a CT of the abdomen if the workup was unrevealing.
A renal ultrasound was also performed on [**8-1**] which showed multiple stones in the collecting system, but no evidence of hydronephrosis or renal abscess.
On [**8-2**], the patient's skin biopsy Gram stain revealed 2+ polys and no organisms, and the aerobic culture grew out coagulase-positive Staphylococcus.
The preliminary pathology report on the skin biopsy was as follows; clusters of plasma cells with infiltrative lymphocytes and neutrophils.
On [**8-3**], a serum protein electrophoresis and urine protein electrophoresis; which had been sent out earlier in the week, came back positive for monoclonal spike in the SPEP and two abnormal bands on the UPEP.
On [**8-4**], the patient had a CT of the abdomen, chest, and pelvis to look for sources of occult infection.
The CT of the chest was significant for a 1.2-cm nodule in the right upper lung adjacent to the major fissure.
The CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 1.2-cm cyst in the body of the pancreas.
At that point, the steroids were discontinued, and the decision was made to repeat the skin biopsy given the questionable read of plasmacytoma.
In the meantime, the Infectious Disease workup continued; and [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus, cytomegalovirus, cryptococcal, and coccidia serologies were checked; which all came back as negative.
Also, Babesia thick and thin smears were checked given a history of transfusions.
At this point, he required transfusions to stop bleeding from his intravenous sites and from his biopsy sites.
On [**8-8**], the patient had frank bleeding from his skin biopsy site that required two hours of manual pressure and resuturing to achieve hemostasis.
This bone marrow biopsy returned the week later and was consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome with no evidence of acute leukemia.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation laboratories were checked twice a day, and factors and cells were replaced liberally as the patient continued to ooze through his peripherally inserted central catheter site and biopsy sites.
On [**8-14**], the patient became acutely hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 90s.
The patient was boluses with fluids and received blood products with a return of his blood pressure to the 140s.
He had a repeat episode on [**8-16**], to which he again responded to fluids and blood products.
On [**8-15**], the patient's repeat skin biopsy was read as consistent with intracellular organisms.
Toxoplasmosis stains done were positive, and the diagnosis of cutaneous toxoplasmosis was made with a question of toxoplasma-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Multiple urine cultures from [**8-14**] to [**8-16**] were positive for enterococcus.
On the morning of [**8-17**], the patient had multiple sets of blood cultures which came back positive as gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
The night float intern was called to see the patient, and an electrocardiogram was checked which was unchanged.
Several hours later, the patient again complained of chest pain, and at this time was markedly tachypneic with a respiratory rate in the 30s and a heart rate in the 100s.
A blood gas was checked at this time which revealed a respiratory alkalosis with a large AA gradient.
An electrocardiogram was checked which showed ischemic changes across the precordium as well as in the lateral leads.
An electrocardiogram was again checked, and that showed that the patient was in atrial fibrillation.
On the following day, the sensitivities of the patient's blood cultures revealed the organisms were resistant to oxacillin, and the patient was continued on vancomycin.
His house officer, his attending, and his consultants related the fact that while his overall prognosis was poor, that he was actually showing signs of improvement regarding his disseminated intravascular coagulation and his Staphylococcus infection.
