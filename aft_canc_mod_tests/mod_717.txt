He received 2U of PRBCs and HCT nadired at 24, 26 on admission and was 30 after transfusions.
He underwent a colonoscopy which showed three polyps, with one maximum size of 1cm.
No polypectomy was performed due to agitation by the patient and INR of 1.6.
HCT increased to 30 and remained stable until discharge.
He will require outpatient evaluation including iron studies, reticulocyte count and vitamin studies.
HCT on discharge was 28. .
His EGD showed Grade I/II varices.
Liver ultrasound showed coarsened liver echotexture, segment IV s/p RFA cystic and solid lesion with mural nodules concerning for tumor recurrence, segment III lesion also raises the possibility of recurrence, persistent small asictes, gallstones, normal portal venous system.
WBC count was elevated and a diagnostic tap was performed which failed to show SBP, 200 PMNs.
As part of liver [**Month/Day (4) **] work up, patient underwent an echocardiogram, which showed normal PAP and LVEF of 70%.
The day of discharge, patient underwent an MRI of abdomen to assess the recurrence of HCC.
Baseline Cr reported as 1.5 to 2.0, was 4.3 on admission.
CKD was felt to be likely due to DM and HTN.
ARF on admission was likely pre-renal in setting of N/V and hemorrhage.
Urine lytes were intially consistent with intrinsic disease, Na of 105, FeNA > 1%, however eventually showed pre-renal state w/ Na 18, FeNA <1%.
Pain was reported as [**2105-2-5**].
see above for ultrasound results and further work up performed with MRI on day of discharge.
This scale was restared with BG ranging between 110-220s, w/ occasional 60s during periods of NPO.
Blood pressures ranging 130-150 systolic throughout hospital stay.
Goal SBP 130/80 or less.

Issues requiring follow up: - Completion of ABx for UTI - Titration of diuretics for optimal volume status - Electrolyte monitoring with restarting of diuretics, 2d after discharge - Blood pressure regimen optimization - HCT labs 2d after discharge - MRI abdomen at [**Hospital1 18**] follow up - PCP and Liver Clinic follow up as arranged.
MRI follow up Patient had undergone and MRI at [**Hospital1 18**] on day of discharge.
You underwent an endoscopy that showed a tear in a part of your esophagus as well as varices (blood vessel outpouchings in your esophagus due to your liver disease).
You received blood transfusions for this and your blood levels stabilized.
You also underwent a colonoscopy that showed several polyps (see below for follow up).
With blood transfusions and intravenous fluids your kidney function recovered.
You will require an outpatient CT scan to evaluate this further.
In addition, you will require a repeat colonoscopy to remove the polyps in your colon.
