In the Emergency Department blood pressure was found to be 81/48 with a heart rate of 78.
Blood pressure remained in the high 80's systolic despite three liters of normal saline with no change in the urine output so dopamine was started via peripheral IV with blood pressure climbing to the 95-100 range systolic.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.5, heart rate 76, blood pressure 94/54, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen mildly distended, soft, non-tympanitic, non-tender, positive bowel sounds, palpable, subcutaneous nodules.
LABS ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 14.9, hematocrit 30.0, platelets 206,000, neutrophils 94, 4 lymphocytes, 2 macrophages.
Sodium 134, potassium 6.3 which was hemolyzed corrected to 5.1, chloride 99, bicarbonate 20, BUN 80, creatinine 2.4, glucose 189, amylase 59, lipase 43, albumin 2.5, phos 7.0, magnesium 2.0, T-bili 0.7.
UA:  Negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase, [**5-4**] white blood cells, [**1-27**] red blood cells, many bacteria.
Blood and urine cultures pending at the time of admission.
Intravenous fluids were continued as were the stress dose steroids and broad spectrum antibiotics and the dopamine was slowly weaned over the next several days with gradual improvement of urine output as well as pressures.
Infectious Disease:  The patient was felt to have likely a urinary source for current presentation; however, abdominal examination was somewhat concerning for possible perforation.
He underwent abdominal CT which showed no evidence of fluid collections or free air suggestive of perforation or abscess.
Hematology/Oncology:  Patient with significant metastatic melanoma with increased tumor burden on abdominal CT underwent echocardiogram on [**2105-12-7**], which showed a mass in the left ventricle consistent with thrombus versus metastatic melanomatous lesion.
