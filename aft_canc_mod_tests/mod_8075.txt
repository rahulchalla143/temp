Consider MRI for further assessment.
----------- CXR ([**2152-12-14**]): No significant interval change.
----------- VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: Oral and pharyngeal swallowing evaluation was performed in conjunction with the speech and swallow service using multiple consistencies of barium.
----------- CT CHEST:  New sub-4-mm right upper and lower lobe pulmonary nodules should be evaluated with chest CT in one year.
Large right neck mass not fully imaged; see neck CT from [**2152-12-14**] for additional details.
The study of the neck demonstrates soft tissue laryngeal mass on the left, causing narrowing of the airway, the right neck mass is not clearly identified in this examination, please consider obtaining additional images under conscious sedation or under anesthesia for further characterization.
----------- CT NECK: 1.
----------- MICROBIOLOGY: URINE CULTURE (Final [**2152-12-16**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Piperacillin/tazobactam sensitivity testing available on request.
Squameous Cell Carcinoma: 65 year old female with long smoking hx, right sided [**Doctor First Name **], and increased hoarseness.
CT scan highly suspicious of malignancy and showed possible airway compromise.
On the medical floor the patient underwent speech and swallow evaluation which showed the patient to be at high aspiration risk with food frequently being stuck in the esophagus.
She was noted to have increased residuals at times - if continues would consider running continuous tube feeds at 65cc/hr.
Shortness of breath: CT chest showed RLL consolidation and with history of COPD and wheezing on exam, she was treated with azithromycin IV 500 mg for 5 days for question CAP.
An MR [**Name13 (STitle) 1093**] was attempted, but due to the patient's extreme intolerance of the procedure as well as an aborted attempt at fiberoptic intubation due to bleeding of the mass no spinal cord imaging was possible.
The patient was unable to tolerate neck MRI and therefore underwent CT neck with contrast for characterization of her malignancy.
her perseverative beahviors were felt to be the etiology of both her constipation and urinary retention as she was observed on the commode on several occasions unable to focus on initiating a bowel movement or urinating.
