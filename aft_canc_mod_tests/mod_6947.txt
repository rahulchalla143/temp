Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-11-24**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is further reduced.
ECHO ([**7-28**]): Focused study to evaluate [**Hospital1 **]-V Pacer settings Baseline atrial paced AV delay 150 ms: no atrial systolic contribution to left ventricular filling; LVOT VTI = 17 cm  At atrial paced AV delay 200 ms: still no atrial systolic contribution to left ventricular filling; LVOT VTI = 18 cm.
Conclusion: post-cardioversion atrial electromechanical dissociation is present; atrial paced AV delay set at 200 ms. Atrial sensed AV delay reprogrammed to 150 ms.

He is co-managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who sees him primarily for AFIB and device follow-up (s/p ICD for low EF & previous VT) and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11300**] at [**Hospital6 33**].
When he went into AFib with RVR, TTE showed an EF of 30% and a new extreme RV restrictive filling pattern.
Due to his history of hyperferritinemia (negative genetic testing for hemochromatosis but patient declined liver biopsy in the past) there was concern that iron deposition could be contributing to his heart failure, causing diastolic dysfunction on top of his preexisting systolic CHF.
A right heart catheterization was performed on HD7, which showed moderate LV diastolic dysfunction (PCWP 20), mild pulmonary hypertension (PASP 44), mildly elevated right-sided filling pressures (RVEDP 14), and a depressed cardiac index (1.7 L/min/m1).
Endomyocardial biopsy was also done; specimens are pending on discharge.
He will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] about the results of his biopsy and for future management of his CHF.
Digoxin, metoprolol, and diltiazem failed to rate control him (best rates in 110s-120s) so dofetilide was added by EP for rhythm control.
Next verapamil, dig and metoprolol were tried; however, the patient then had an episode of vtach progressing to ventricular fibrillation, terminated by his ICD.
His pacemaker was then upgraded with the addition of atrial and LV leads (DDD mode), and he is now AV paced .
Echo following pacer upgrade showed that he still had suboptimal LV filling with, so AV conduction delay was increased to 200ms.
He will need an echo in 3 months to confirm improved ventricular filling.
At baseline the patient has blood pressure in the 100s/70s, partially due to liver disease and advanced systolic HF.
His pressure were in the low 100's throughout hospitalization and he was asymptomatic throughout.
However, as he had been having episodic diarrhea and diaphoresis prior to admission, the question of whether he had a carcinoid tumor was suggested by his gastroenterologist Dr. [**Name (STitle) 23173**].
As patient was discharged before the requisite 3 days of holding dietary indoles (caffeine, certain fruits etc) had ended, he could not undergo 24 hour urine collection for metanephrine testing during hospitalization.
Tamsulosin may have impact on blood pressure and thus was initially held.
Urine cultures were negative.
Continued OxyContin home dose  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - heart biopsy f/u - needs echo in 3 months to assess for improved LV filling s/p increase in pacer AV delay, presuming AFib has not returned - may need 24 hour urine collection for metanephrines if concern for carcinoid tumor   Medications on Admission: metoprolol 75mg daily (AM) furosemide 40mg daily (AM) Losartan 50mg daily (PM) digoxin 0.250mg daily (PM) simvastatin 20mg daily (PM) fenofibrate 200mg daily (PM) tamsulosin 0.4mg QHS omeprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **] clonazepam 1mg QHS gabapentin 600mg QHS OxyContin 20mg QHS citalopram 60mg daily folic acid 1mg daily (AM) MVI daily (AM) Vitamin E 400units [**Hospital1 **] thiamine 100mg daily (AM) .

Your blood pressure improved with IV fluids, but you then developed a rapid heart rate and irregular rhythm (atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia).
Because you have heart failure and high iron levels, a cardiac biopsy was also done to determine whether iron deposition in your heart muscle is contributing to your heart failure (a potentially treatable condition).
Results of the biopsy are still pending and will be followed up on with you by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].
We made the following changes to your medications:  1) ADDED Amiodarone 200 mg twice a day for 1 week (start=[**6-28**], stop=[**7-4**]) then taper down to Amiodarone 200 mg once a day after that 2) ADDED Clindamycin 300mg every 8 hours for 7 days (start=[**6-28**], stop=[**7-4**]) 3) DECREASED Metoprolol succinate to 50mg daily 4) STOPPED Digoxin 0.25mg daily 5) DECREASED Losartan to 25mg daily 6) DECREASED Gabapentin to 300mg at bedtime  You should take the rest of your medications as prescribed before hospitalization.
