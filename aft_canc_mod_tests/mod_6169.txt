Excisional biopsy of an enlarged submandibular lymph node on [**2106-11-3**] showing follicular lymphoma, histological grade 2 with positive BCL2 staining, bone marrow not involved.
Clinical followup with serial CT scans showing enlarging lymph nodes over time in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis suggestive of recurrence.
Disease progression diagnosed in [**2115-11-24**] by a fine-needle aspiration of right preauricular mass.

PORT Study Date of [**2116-6-10**] 9:45 AM FINDINGS: The left kidney measures 11 cm.
A 5-mm non-obstructive stone is present within the interpolar region of left kidney.

[**2116-6-30**] ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-5-26**], LV systolic dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension and substantial pleural effusions are all new.
[**2116-6-30**] CT Head IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2116-7-6**] ECHO The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-6-30**], LVEF has improved and trivial MR is now seen.

# Follicular Lymphoma: Patient was admitted for allo stem cell transplant with ATG/TLI/clofarabine preconditioning on a study protocol.
He did have asymptomatic fevers on the second night of ATG, and blood pressures were noted to be lower than baseline in the 90s systolic, but the last three doses of ATG were tolerated well with no complaints.
Creatinine improved briefly to 1.2 with fluids but was noted to increase acutely in next couple of days up to 1.7 in setting of ATG treatment.
With blood transfusion and normal saline boluses, patient's creatinine trended back down to 1.0 and was stable for nearly one week.
Once fluids were stopped after clofarabine treatment and stem cell infusion, patient's creatinine was again noted to increase to 1.5.
His sats decreased to 88%.
A chest x ray obtained showed increased nodular/fluffy opacities.
His blood and sputum tested positive for galactomannon.
He was eventually extubated and satting well on face mask.
Aspergillis was thought to be source of pulmonary infection given the positive sputum and blood galactomannon.
Voriconazole was then switched to micofungin since his LFTs increased thought to be possible due to voriconazole hepato-toxicity.
Fibroscopic exam by ENT showed improved pharyngeal edema.
# Hemoptysis: Superficial erosions seen on fiberoptic exam by ENT.
Over time, he became more lucid and MRI showed resolution of PRES.
He was not able to take PO/NG meds due to ileus and Bactrim was not given due to renal failure.
#Abrnormal LFTs: Several weeks into hospital course, Mr. [**Known lastname 82035**] developed rising LFTs (in the 100s), rising amylase and lipase (in the 500s) and rising [**Female First Name (un) **]- total (peaked at 8.0).
A renal ultrasound showed no evidence of obstuction.
Bronchoscopy was completed to rule out PCJ pneumonia and was negative.
Later in the course of his stay, the patient began to have a rising bilirubin which was shown to be a direct hyperbilirubinemia.
Numerous RUQ ultrasounds indicated that the patient's biliary drain was in place, without any evidence of blockage or obstruction.
A transjugular hepatic biopsy showed pathology consistent with sepsis versus drug reaction, at which point the patient was DC'ed from several hepatotoxic drugs, without resolution of hyperbilirubinemia.
Throughout the ICU course patient required several platelet and blood transfusion.
