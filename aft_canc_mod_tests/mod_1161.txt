TTE ([**2-9**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
CT abd/pelvis ([**2-17**]): 1.
New hypoattenuating lesions within the liver are not well evaluated on this non-contrast enhanced study however consistent with new metastatic disease.
# Sepsis: On admission to the ICU the patient was septic meeting SIRS criteria with tachycardia, temperature of >104, tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia with a suspected pulmonary source, pneumonia.
Following a negative MRSA screening pt's antibiotic regimen was narrowed to Zosyn and Levofloxacin and he completed a 10 day course of these antibiotics on [**2-18**].
Urine cultures, blood cultures and fluid cultures were drawn and ultimately negative.
# Pleural Effusions: Pt's CT scan showed bilateral pleural effusions, following completion of pt's antibiotics regimen and wean to minimal ventilatory support, diuresis therapy was initiated to aid with pleural effusion resorption.
Pt was started on 40mg PO BID Furosemide for a goal of -500 to -1l for 24hr I/O balance.
On admission pt was noted to have a Hct of 15 and was transfused 2u of PRBCs and then another 2 units the day after admission.
Guaiaics were obtained and were ultimately negative, following transfusion pt's Hct was stable at 28-30.
During hospitalization pt was noted to have a tender RLQ abdomen a CT abdomen was obtained which showed a large 12 cm craniocaudal x 6.5 cm transverse x 2.8 cm anterior- posterior rectus sheath hematoma.
Patient was transfuse an addition 1 unit pRBC for a 2 day down trend of hematocrit to 23 with an appropriate bump.
# Pneumonia: Admission chest x-ray in ED notable for severe RLL and RML PNA, pt was also noted to have volumous secretions from his trach requiring suctioing.
After initially receiving Cefepime x 1 dose, several dasys of Vancomycin pt showed improvement on a narrowed regimen of Zosyn and Levofloxacin.
# New onset A-Fib: Pt was in the ED to be in new A-fib with RVR in the rate of 200s, pt's heart rate reverted to sinus rhythm following Diltiazem 10mg IV x 2, fluid administration and Metoprolol 12.5mg PO x 1.
An echo was obtained following admission and showed mild symmetric LVH with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, mild aortic regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension, and biatrial enlargement.
Urine electrolytes reflected [**Last Name (un) **] to be pre renal most likely secondary to his sepsis.
Following aggresive fluid administration creatinine and urine output improved.
# Cancer: Pt has a history of papillary thyroid carcinoma s/p thyroidectomy and radiocative iodine ablation ([**2156**]), squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy ([**2156**]) and recently metastatic prostate cancer (Extensive osseous metastatic disease on PET scan in [**2163-9-22**]).
