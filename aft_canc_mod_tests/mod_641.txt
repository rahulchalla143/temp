male with MMP including transfusion dependent anemia, atrial fibrillation, h/o chronic LUE DVTs who now p/w hypotension, L arm cellulitis, possible pneumonia, sepsis and respiratory distress:  Respiratory distress: -- New RLL infiltrate concerning for PNA, PE was also considered given pt's known history of UE DVT but CT angiogram could not be done in ED given patient's instability and renal insufficieny.
An autopsy was refused by family  Hypotension: -- Most likely secondary to sepsis as blood cultures did become postivie for CNS 2/2 bottles.
