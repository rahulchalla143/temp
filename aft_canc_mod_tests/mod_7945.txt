X-rays and MRI revealed a pathological fracture of her thoracic spine, given TLSO and after serial MRIs showed worsening fracture.
MRI showed T10-T11 lesion with severe fracture and anterior wedging with near collapse of T11, resulting in cord compression.
Urine culture showed E. Coli >100,000 which was resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin; cultures were sensitive to bactrim, ceftazidime, cefepime, gentamicin.

**FINAL REPORT [**2182-2-25**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2182-2-25**]):    NO GROWTH.
Blood Cultures: Negative [**2-21**].
FECAL CULTURE (Preliminary):     CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Preliminary):     OVA + PARASITES (Preliminary):     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2182-2-27**]):       Reported to and read back by [**Location (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 89787**] [**2182-2-27**] @ 10:00 AM.
Lumbar Spine [**2182-2-19**]: FINDINGS/IMPRESSION: Two [**Location (un) 931**] rods were placed, bilateral pedicle screws are in the L1, T12, T10, T9 vertebral bodies.
CT Ab/Pelvix [**2-21**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2-24**]: FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A right sided port and left internal jugular central venous line are in unchanged position without pneumothorax.
A blood sample was sent for type and screen.
Of note, she was hospitalized in [**2180**] at [**Hospital6 1597**] where an anti-K antibody was identified.
Laboratory testing: Patient ABO/Rh: Group O, Rh positive Antibody screen: positive Antibody identity: anti-Fya ([**Hospital1 18**]); anti-K previously identified at [**Hospital1 **] but was not seen on most recent testing at [**Hospital1 18**].
Antigen phenotype: Fya-antigen negative, K-antigen negative  Transfusion history: No previous transfusions at [**Hospital1 18**].
DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Ms. [**Known lastname 7168**] has a new diagnosis of anti-Fya antibody and a history of anti-K antibody at an outside hospital.
Fya-antigen is a member of the [**Doctor Last Name 5239**] blood group system and K-antigen is a member of the [**Doctor Last Name **] blood group system.
The fact that the most recent antibody screen and panel did not detect the anti-K antibody indicates that the titer of the antibody has fallen below the threshold of  detection.
OVERALL PENDING INFORMATION: Stool cultures [**2-26**].
Blood cultures [**2-23**].
Post operatively, patient was hypotensive, she recieved 250 bolus of fluid and 1 unit of PRBCs in the PACU for a hematocrit drop from 30-26.
Her blood pressure improved to the 90s and patient was stable on post op check.
Troponins initially trended up, likely [**12-26**] demand, but MBs were flat.
Neurosurgery continued to follow and planned to keep staples in for 2 weeks.
However, there was a question of HCAP in the ICU as well- with an opacity seen on CXR but no clinical symptoms.
An AM cortisol on [**2-27**] was 15 on dexamethasone was reassuring.
Stool studies are still pending.
C.diff and stool studies sent.
Patient requires TSLO when HOB > 30 degrees of OOB.
# dCHF: EF 50-55% reported but there is no echo in our system.
Creatinine better than baseline on discharge.
Her BP did not improve despite aggressive IVF resuscitation and her mental status also did not improve.
Family meeting was held given volume overload and DNR/DNI status and need to escalate care to maintain adequate MAPs, and family, incl [**Telephone/Fax (1) 802**] [**Name (NI) 382**] decided to focus on comfort.
