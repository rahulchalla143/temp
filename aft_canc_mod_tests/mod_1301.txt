CT head [**2118-10-3**]: Large (~ 6.0 x 4.8 cm) Ill-defined hyperdense collection in the right cerebellar hemisphere with hematocrit levels, consistent with hemorrhage, likely subacute.
CXR [**2118-10-3**]: AP supine portable view of the chest is obtained.
Low lung volumes somewhat limit evaluation as well as slight patient rotation to the right.
MRI Brain [**2118-10-4**]: 1.
CT head [**2118-10-4**]  Compared to [**10-3**] head CT, increased size and distribution of right cerebellar hemorrhage with increased surrounding edema and mass effect; however, lesion is stable compared to more recent MRI.
Doppler US [**2118-10-4**]: No new acute deep vein thrombosis identified.
Chronic, occlusive  subclavian clot is seen, the appearance of which is stable since the torso CT of [**2118-5-9**].
Interval decrease in size of extra-axial pneumocephalus, and stable air within preexisting clot cavity.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 953**] was admitted to SICU under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] on [**2118-10-3**] for evaluation of Right cerebellar hemorrhage.
He had an MRI on the evening on [**10-4**] which revealed tumor, presumed to be metastatic melanoma.
He required Zyprexa for this study bu was still lethargic and disoriented many hours later.
CT revealed extension of the hemorrhage.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] also met with the family to discuss the potential for a CT guided stereotactic biopsy and spiration.
Surgical frame was placed on pre-op and he had a CT scan.
Biopsy and aspiration was performed without complication.
Post op head CT revealed residual hematoma but significant evacuation and decompression of 4th ventricle.
On POD#1 a repeat Head CT was performed and stable.
Pt's exam was stable but he remained lethargic.
A Head CT was performed revealing extension of the hemorrhage.
