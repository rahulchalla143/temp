It was felt that the CT finding was not subarachnoid hemorrhage and therefore no further neurosurgical intervention was warranted.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital following a motorcycle crash where you sustained a clavicle fracture on the right; right sided rib fractures with a small area of collapse in your right lung and a finding on your head CT scan showing a menigioma vs. a bleeding brain injury for which the neurosurgery consultants decided required no intervention at this time.
