Exploratory laparotomy and removal of intraabdominal packs and closure of abdomen.
Physical Exam: NAD, A+OX3, supine on bed RRR Scattered wheezes b/l, good inspiratory effort Soft, ND, tenderness felt RUQ, fullness felt RUQ but no distinct mass, no erythema or crepitus no c/c/e Left eye - scleral injected  Pertinent Results: [**2162-7-29**] 08:05PM   WBC-11.3* RBC-4.33 HGB-12.2 HCT-38.3 MCV-88 MCH-28.2 MCHC-31.9 RDW-13.6 [**2162-7-29**] 08:05PM   PLT COUNT-214 [**2162-7-29**] 08:05PM   GLUCOSE-78 UREA N-15 CREAT-1.0 SODIUM-141 POTASSIUM-4.3 CHLORIDE-106 TOTAL CO2-28 ANION GAP-11 [**2162-7-29**] 08:05PM   PT-11.3 PTT-24.1 INR(PT)-0.9  Imaging: [**2162-6-9**]: 10.7 x 11.9 x 11.5 cm, well-circumscribed, heterogeneously-enhancing mass within the right adrenal gland and invaginating the inferomedial aspect of the right lobe of the liver and possibly the caudate lobe of the liver.
[**7-29**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 13.2 X 12.0 X 12.9 heterogenous, well circumscribed, ?
invasion to caudate of liver (no clear border seen), no involvement of IVC, rest of liver WNL, left adrenal gland WNL, right kidney is displaced but fills symetrically, LAD seen, no evidence of mets   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted the day prior to surgery and underwent a CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis that demonstrated slight enlargement of the adrenal mass to just over 13 cm.
The operation was accompanied by extraordinary blood loss which required a massive transfusion of blood products.
Accordingly, her right upper quadrant was packed and she was returned to the intensive care unit with an open abdomen.
Overnight, her temperature normalized and her coagulation parameters were normalized with blood product.
There was a question of a right hemiparesia, as she felt weakness on her right leg and arm, so a Head CT was performed and there was no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses or infaction.
Due to baseline history of chronic bronchitis, on [**8-6**] her sats were in the high 80s - low 90s, so she was started on O2 at 1-2lt/min.
Today patient was weaned from the oxygen with PO2 > 95% on room air.
Chest X Ray was ordered and showed no evidence of acute pulmonary process.
