An arterial blood gas performed after intubation at the outside hospital revealed a severe acidosis, predominantly metabolic and less respiratory, with a serum bicarbonate of 9.
A chest x-ray done after intubation showed evolving bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with aspiration, and possibly evolving adult respiratory distress syndrome.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.6; blood pressure 85/46; heart rate 105.
The patient was intubated on assist control with tidal volume of 515, respiratory rate of 14, PEEP of 5; oxygen saturation rate 100% on FIO2 of 100%.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On arrival to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit, vital signs were noted as above.
The patient's systolic blood pressure subsequently dropped to the 40s, with peripheral oxygen saturations dropping to the 60's on 100% FIO2.
A repeat arterial blood gas done after administering 7 ampules of bicarbonate en route to [**Hospital1 1444**] with dose adjusted by very severe metabolic and respiratory acidosis, with a pH of 7.03, PCO2 of 66, NPO2 of 40, and 100% FI02.
The patient's ventilator settings were subsequently changed to FIO2 of 21% with a respiratory rate of 4.
