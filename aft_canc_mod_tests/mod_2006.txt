She recently developed obstructive jaundice which was followed by placement of an endoprosthesis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] during endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography.
At that time, she also had a peri-ampullar cancer identified by a fine needle aspirate biopsy and CT angiography here at the [**Hospital1 69**].
She had a low urine output and low blood pressure both of which responded to boluses of intravenous fluid and on postoperative day three, the patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the Floor in stable condition.
On postoperative day six, the patient was started on Lopressor for high blood pressure and tachycardia.
The patient underwent a CT scan on postoperative day seven which revealed no undrained collection, but the incision was noted to be draining copious amounts of bilious fluid from the lateral edges.
Her wound continued to drain bilious fluid and both her [**Doctor Last Name 406**] and [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] were draining bilious drainage.
On postoperative day nine, the patient was noted on physical examination to have possible fascial dehiscence of her wound at the right lateral edge.
The patient underwent an abdominal wound exploration and closure.
She had a decrease in her urine output postoperatively from her wound closure which responded to an intravenous fluid bolus.
On postoperative day 13 from her Whipple and postoperative day four from her wound exploration, the patient underwent a CT scan of the abdomen which only revealed a small fluid collection over the medial segment of the left lobe of the liver.
The CT scan was reviewed with the attending radiologist, and at this point, the small amount of collection was felt to be too small for drainage.
At this point, it was noted that her wound dressing was no longer saturated with bilious material.
The patient's pathology from her Whipple procedure revealed an adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of the duodenum, poorly differentiated, and mucin producing.
