Patient was brought to the ED, and she was found to have a positive UA, a nonfocal neurologic exam with some lethargy noted, and an MRI which was negative for abscesses but did show prior infarct.
HIV x [**2122**]: No AIDS defining illness.
Hepatitis C, genotype 4, VL 1.05 million copies.
Lung nodule: Patient states that she had a lung biopsy at [**Hospital 53676**] Center 3-4 years ago.
Physical Exam: VS: 108/62 HR 84 RR 20 O2 sat 100% RA Gen: well appearing in NAD.

CT head ([**2133-6-30**]) hypodensities c/w old infarct/contusion in right and left frontal lobes.
no enhancing lesions seen, however, MRI is more sensitive in evaluation for subtle lesions and in patient with HIV, MRI would be recommended if there is any clinical concern .
MRI L spine ([**2133-6-30**]): no abnormal enhancement within epidural space or within thecal sac.
MRI head w/ and w/o contrast ([**2133-6-30**]) No areas of abnormally restricted diffusion to suggest acute brain ischemia.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an e' of <0.08m/s c/w an elevated left ventricular filling pressure (>12mmHg).
Her EKG did not show any acute ST-T changes, and overnight telemetry showed no events.
An EKG was performed, which showed sinus tachycardia.
Her CXR did not show any acute changes, and patient was given nitroglycerin with symptomatic relief.
She had cardiac enzymes and a D-dimer checked as well, with negative cardiac enzymes but with an elevated D-dimer.
She then proceeded to finish her blood transfusion without incident.
Prior to receiving the CT scan, patient developed acute SOB, tachypnea with RR 30s and tachycardia again, and a code was called due to suspicion for massive pulmonary embolus.
Her initial ABG was 7.33/39/115.
Her CT chest showed ground glass opacities suggestive of pulmonary edema, and the etiology of the acute episode of chest pain was thought to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
An echo was obtained and showed an EF of 20% with 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but she had no prior echos here for comparison.
A cholesterol panel was checked, as well as a TSH and RPR.
She was started on lisinopril and metoprolol, which were titrated up for goal systolic blood pressure in the 80-90s.
Cardiology consult recommended that patient undergo an evaluation for endocarditis given her degree of valvular regurgitation.
Patient had blood cultures drawn which were all negative at time of discharge.
She had a TEE performed, which was negative for vegetation.
She will follow up in cardiology, and she will need teaching from the heart failure clinic, as well as an outpatient catheterization to be scheduled to evaluate for ischemia.
She had a renal ultrasound performed with persistent hydronephrosis.
She had a urine toxicology screen positive for cocaine and opiates.
Patient had lung nodules seen as well on CT scan, which were stable from prior imaging.
Dilated cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction 20% 5.
You had an episode of chest pain, thought to be related to acute fluid buildup in your lungs.
Your EKG and CXR were both negative.
You have iron deficiency anemia, and will need an outpatient colonoscopy.
At that time, she can add other medications for your heart failure including Lasix and Aldactone, which we did not add as an inpatient due to concerns for your blood pressure.
You will need a digoxin level checked at the time as well.
