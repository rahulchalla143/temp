# Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated to 3.0 from baseline of 1.0 on admission likely combination of two recent contrast studies (coronary angiography and CTA), combined with continued medication adherence and possibly a component of TMP-SMX contributing to increased creatinine.
Her lasix and valsartan were held initially and creatinine improved with very gentle fluid resuscitation.
# Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: Initially there was no evidence of volume overload on exam and valsartan and lasix were held in setting of acute renal failure.
After receiving packed RBCs she developed shortness of breath and had CXR consistent with CHF so was diuresed with IV lasix.
Workup consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
She underwent a sppech and swallow evaluation which showed no evidence of aspiration therefore she was not coninued on aspiration precuations.
# C. diff colitis:  The patient was noted to have diarrhea with stool studies positive for C.diff on [**5-10**].
Repeat stool cultures remained negative.
