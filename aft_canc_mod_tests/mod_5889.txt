History of Present Illness: 77M PMH myelofibrosis and resulting anemia at hematology clinic the day of admission for his first ever blood transfusion for hematocrit 19.
His saturation declined to 86% on room air, but subsequently rose to 99% on 2L NC, following suctioning of 50cc juice per notes.

abdominal ultrasound .
Smaller cyst and adjacent 1-cm similar echogenic lesion most consistent with hemangioma are also seen in the medial aspect of the right lobe of the liver.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler (does not exclude).
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
ORAL PHASE: Bolus formation, control, AP tongue movement, and oral transit time within functional limits.
AP position images demonstrate large collection in the midline with air-fluid level, which could represent known Zenker's diverticulum.
IMPRESSION: Penetration resulting from backflow from the large esophageal diverticulum, likely Zenker's, otherwise functional oral and pharyngeal swallow.

URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):       STAPHYLOCOCCUS SPECIES.
# Aspiration pneumonia Pt developed fever, bandemia, bilateral infiltrates on CXR in the setting of a witness aspiration event during blood transfusion.
Since the story was very classic for aspiration and initial cxr did not support TRALI, transfusion reaction was thought not to be likely at all.
His oxygenation continued to improve and he underwent evaluation via PT, and was considered safe for home with home PT.
He was transfused with a total of 4 units of PRBCs, and his hematocrit remained stable.
# Bacteremia His blood culture on admission showed Bacillus not anthraxis.
This was discussed with infectious disease, who thought that this may represent a contaminant (even though this is a very rare contaminant) given lack of positive repeat cultures and lack of risk factors (no IVDA).
Surveillance cultures remained negative.
# Staph in urine culture This was considered also to be a contaminant, as his blood cultures were negative and UA at the time was bland.
BNP was elevated (could be pneumonia as well).
A TTE was checked, which showed moderate pulmonary hypertension and preserved EF.
On exam noted to have hepato-splenomegaly.
An abdominal u/s showed enlargement of both organs.
He was given PO vitamin K and his INR trended down somewhat (1.4<--1.6).
Hepatitis B&C serologies were negative.
