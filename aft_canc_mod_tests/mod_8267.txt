CT scan and MRI scan had revealed a right frontal lesion.
His MRI scan of the brain which was consistent with a cystic lesion in the right frontal area anterior to the motor cortex.
I would think that there is a significant possibility that this is a low-grade astrocytoma and an excisional biopsy is warranted.
Functional MRI showed activation area for motor activity involving the left hand in close proximity posterior to the mass lesion.
Pertinent Results: MRI brain (WAND) [**8-12**] - 3.3 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm right frontal lobe mass, involving the ipsilateral pre-central gyrus, unchanged over the short-interval and likely a low-grade glial neoplasm (by previous imaging characteristics).
CT head [**8-12**] - Expected postoperative changes following right frontal craniotomy and mass resection, without acute intracranial abnormalities.
Brain MRI [**8-13**] post op - Fluid and blood products in the right frontal surgical bed  without associated edema or mass effect.
Post operative CT showed post-operative changes within the surgical bed without evidence of infarct or hemorrhage.
Brain MRI was obtained the following day which showed 100% resection.

?You will need an MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium contrast.
