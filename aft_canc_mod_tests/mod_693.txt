A red clot was seen on the greater curve of the fundus without an active bleed.
No [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tears and patient had received nine units of packed red blood cells with an increase in hematocrit to 23.5.
Patient also received eight units of FFP for INR of 1.5.
He also received 10 mg of subcutaneous Vitamin K and was then transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for further management.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 100.1.
Pulse 130.
Blood pressure 154/66.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, except rales at the bases.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, warm, 2+ distal pulses and pale (that was the physical examination from the first progress note on [**10-29**], no physical examination from the [**10-28**] night float admission note).
LABORATORIES ON [**9-13**]:  White blood cell count of 4.3, hematocrit 33.6 and platelets 139,000.
Uric acid 4.6, ALT 17, AST 16, LDH 130, alkaline phosphatase 101 and T bilirubin 0.5.

D dimer was positive, fibrinogen 424 and the FDP was less than 10.
Alkaline phosphatase was 257 but otherwise normal liver function tests.
Electrocardiogram on [**10-27**] at outside hospital with sinus tachycardia at 122, axis 61, intervals 125.84.419 corrected.
Hematocrit will be followed and transfusion prn.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Gastrointestinal was consulted and an emergent abdominal ultrasound was done which showed limited portal vein flow distally.
A multiphasic CT showed unchanged metastases with portal vein flow distally but minimal flow proximally.
Interventional Radiology was again consulted and an IVC filter was attempted to be placed secondary to patient's inability to be anticoagulated.
Patient also experienced acute renal failure likely secondary to the dye load given during a CT and angio procedure during the admission.
Patient maintained good urine output and creatinine rose to 1.8, then resolved on its own.
His hematocrit remained stable for five to six days around 30.
Patient's total bilirubin also rose to a peak of 20.
All cultures and fecal leukocytes were negative.
