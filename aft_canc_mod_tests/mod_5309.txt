Head CT ([**2139-9-22**]): 1.
Liver US ([**2139-9-23**]): 1.
ERCP ([**2139-9-23**]): 1.
Echo ([**2139-9-24**]): Left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to fibrosis and akinesis of the anterior septum, and akinesis of the anterior free wall and apex.
Blood cultures were drawn and later grew e.coli in [**1-15**] bottles.
On [**9-23**], patient was dialyzed and post-dialysis had a blood pressure of 50/P with tachycardia to 140's.
The patient was transferred to ICU secondary to hypotension and T 104.8.
Blood cultures from this day grew e.coli in [**1-15**] bottles (making it [**3-17**] total).
Vitals were T 104.8; BP 90/48; HR 148; RR 24; Sa02 94% RA.
Soon thereafter, vancomycin and zosyn were D/C'ed per ID recs.
On transfer AST was 26; ALT 53; Amylase 66; Lipase 17.
WBC was 14.4; creatinine was 4.5.
Follow-up blood cultures dran [**9-25**] remained negative for bacterial growth.
As noted, cultures from [**9-22**] later grew enterococcus species that were sensitive to high dose gentamicin.
Follow-up blood cultures recommended after gentamicin course has been finished.
- LFTs prior to the procedure were elevated [**9-22**] to ALT 79; AST 417 and fell to normal levels following ERCP.
Urine grew VRE and serratia [**9-23**] as noted previously.
Cultures of [**9-22**] were negative.
Surveillance cultures 10/13 and [**9-30**] proved negative.
CAD Cardiac markers were elevated (0.13, 0.14, 0.08) from admission.
An echo showed ejection fraction of 20-30 percent.
Cord compression: CT spine showed severe spinal cord compression at the C3-4 through C6-7 levels and 1.4 x 1.2 cm lytic lesion involving the T5 vertebral body.
Neurosurgery consultation recommended CT myelogram, which was performed [**10-2**] and confirmed cord compression.
Outpatient bone scan is recommended.
AV fistulogram [**9-29**] revealed aneurysm and impatent AV fistula, and attempted re-thrombectomy by IR was also unsuccessful.
Hemodialysis was performed according to renal recs (see accompanying documentation) and will be resumed per patient's usual WMF routine at the [**Location (un) 5503**] dialysis unit.
Platelet count on [**9-25**] was found to be 88.
Outpatient Lab Work Please have blood cultures drawn AFTER course of gentamycin has been completed.
Please have blood cultures drawn after you finish the course of gentamicin.
