Him and his wife were on vacation at [**Location (un) **], he went for a swim at around 09:00 am, and was feeling fine.
His words came out correctly, but were all out of context, and his speech did not make sense.
Head CT was done and showed mulitple intraparenchymal hemorrhages, in the left temporal and left occipital lobes.
He was transferred by med flight to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment.
MRI of prostated done in [**3-/2182**] showed no evidence of malignancy.
Bone scan in [**2182-3-14**] showed multiple areas of tracer uptake most consistent with degenerative changes.

Severe bibasilar atelectasis is present, and an underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
CT head [**9-9**]: FINDINGS:  There are three left parenchymal hematomas, increased in size since the prior study.
COMMENT ON ATTENDING REVIEW: Given the lobar nature of the hematoma, diagnostic considerations include amyloid angiopathy, vascular malformation(s), and underlying masses.
Recommend MRI and MRA for further evaluation.
Alternatively, an underlying mass can also be suspected if the angiography proves to be negative.
In that situation, a followup study should be obtained in four weeks for further assessment.
The MRA of the head and neck demonstrate no vascular occlusion, but are limited for evaluation for stenosis or aneurysms.
CTA head [**9-10**]:  NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  Again demonstrated are the three left parenchymal hematomas with hematocrit levels, in the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes, respectively, all stable in size from the prior study.
HEAD AND NECK CTA:  The contrast bolus timing is suboptimal, markedly limiting evaluation.
Large blood vessels are again seen in the left occiputal scalp.
IMPRESSION: 1)  Stable left parenchymal hemorrhages.
However, a conventional angiogram would be the study of choice to evaluate for an arteriovenous fistula.
Cerebral angiogram and embolization [**9-12**]: Final Report DATE OF SERVICE:  [**2182-9-12**].
The left vertebral artery was then selectively catheterized using [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] catheter and angled Glidewire, and an angiogram was performed.
Control angiogram through the DAC demonstrated multiple other feeders to the AV fistula, and thus the catheter was exchanged for a rapid transit and further embolization was undertaken within two distal middle meningeal branches with Onyx 18 with good penetration into the nidus.
Central angiogram at this point demonstrated further occipital arterial supply from very small feeders which we were not able to embolize, and thus at this point we decided to perform embolization from the venous side.
Embolization was then undertaken with multiple coils including Axium 3D, Cashmere, and GDC, with good result.
Followup angiography was performed which demonstrated near-complete occlusion of the complex fistula.
A common femoral arteriogram was then performed, and an 8 French Angio-Seal closure device was used to close the arteriotomy in the right groin.
The venous puncture was closed with direct manual pressure.
LEFT OCCIPITAL ARTERY ARTERIOGRAM: Shows numerous small branches supplying the dural AV fistula through transosseus branches.
IMPRESSION:  [**Known firstname 12584**] [**Known lastname **] underwent cerebral angiography and embolization of a complex ([**Doctor Last Name 12585**] III) dural AV fistula with embolization of arterial supply from left middle meningeal, left occipital, and left vertebral arteries, as well as venous embolization of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses.
The multiple left-sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage were thought to be secondary to AVF, so pt underwent angiographic embolization on [**2182-9-12**], with embolization of most but not all feeder vessels.

CT of your head showed multiple bleeds in your brain.
During the work-up of your strokes, we discovered that you had multiple arterio-venous fistulas in your brain, so you underwent angiographic embolization on [**2182-9-12**].
This "plugged up" most (but not all) of the blood vessels that were feeding the arterio-venous malformation.
You will need to undergo repeat angiography in 1 month.
