Vitals BP 98/58, HR 73, RR 22, sat 100% on room air.
IN ED, T 97.2, HR 103, BP 102/81, Sat 93-95% on 5L NC.
CXR without CHF or pneumonia.
Peak/mean gradient 60/32 mm HG on last echo in [**2162-8-8**].
CHF, with EF 35% in 08/[**2162**].
DM type 2 on Glyburide, last HbA1C 6.9% on [**2162-9-28**] 5.
Myelodysplastic syndrome with anemia (baseline Hct 29-31) and thrombocytopenia (baseline plt 25-30) 6.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VITALS: T 97.2, BP 122/74, HR 87, RR 23, saturation 100%on 5L NC GEN: Mild respiratory distress with abdominal muscle use.
Carotid pulse with somewhat decreased amplitude.
Pertinent Results: LABS: Relevant laboratory data on admission: CBC: WBC 5.8, Hct 37.5 (was 27.9 on [**1-5**]), plt 9 (14 on [**1-5**]).
Chemistry: Na 137, K 4.8, Cl 96, HCO3 27 (AG 14), BUN 35, Creat 1.4 (was 1.2 on [**1-5**]), glucose 153.
Cardiac enzymes: CK 35 Trop 0.15 (was 0.08 on [**2162-8-9**])  EKG: Atrial fibrillation, rate .
CXR PA AND LATERAL [**2163-1-17**]: Comparison made to prior study of [**2162-12-29**].
Relevant studies in hospital: CXR [**2163-1-19**]: Again note is made of marked biventricular enlargement.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, mild CHF, and small right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 89 year-old male with multiple medical problems including CHF with EF 35%, severe AS, severe MDS with thrombocytopenia, chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin on admission, HTN and DM type 2, admitted with weight gain and increasing pulmonary rale, as well as severe thrombocytopenia.
1) CHF: Patient with known CHF with an EF of 35% in [**2162-8-8**], likely as a complication of HTN and severe AS.
Lasix was temporarily held in the setting of low BP and likely GI bleed (see below) but resumed on [**2163-1-19**] and titrated to TID dosing.
His weight at discharge is 182 lbs.
He will need daily weights and careful monitoring of his fluid balance, with extra Lasix as needed for >= 3 lbs weight gain as BP tolerates.
Repeat CXRs were suggestive of mild CHF, no clear infiltrate.
3) GI bleed: On admission, platelet count was 9K.
On [**2163-1-18**], however, Hct 33--> 24 in the setting of severe thrombocytopenia and INR 1.9, and patient noted to have 1 episode of melena.
His SBP also dropped to 80s.
While in ICU, patient remained hemodynamically stable, without need for further blood products.
Hct 37.1 at discharge, platelets 21K, INR 1.6.
He will need daily count checks.
Peak troponin 0.17, trending down at discharge.
EKG was without acute ischemic changes.
His baseline Hct is 33-35, platelets have recently been trending down to nadir 7K.
8) Chronic renal insufficiency: Per OMR records, baseline creatinine 1.1-1.5.
His creatinine was at baseline thoughout admission, 1.2 at discharge.
