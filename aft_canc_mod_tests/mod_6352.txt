Minimal descending ectopia of the left tonsil is also noted, resulting in mild narrowing of left posterior aspect of foramen magnum  Post op MRI [**2174-2-5**]: 1.
Work up included a head CT that revealed a left cerebellar mass.
He was admitted to the ICU for observation and MR imaging was performed: This demonstrated a heterogeneous mass lesion at the left cerebellar hemisphere with multiple areas of irregular enhancement and areas with high signal intensity on T2, possibly related with a combination of necrosis and cystic transformation.
?You will not need an MRI of the brain as this was done during your inpatient hospitalization *       you will need an MRI of the abdomen, as this was not done as an inpatient.
