Sagittal imaging was performed with long TR, long TE fast spin echo and short TR, short TE spin echo technique.
Axial imaging was performed with long TR, long TE fast spin echo and with gradient echo technique.
No prior cervical spine imaging studies are available for comparison.
CONCLUSION: Limited study due to motion artifact.
The suboptimal study prevents evaluation of the neural foramina.

TECHNIQUE: Axial multidetector CT of the abdomen was performed before and twice after the uneventful intravenous administration of 150 cc Optiray.
No lymphadenopathy within the abdomen by CT size criteria, though there are sub-cm lymph nodes within the portacaval space and retroperitoneum.
The pancreatic duct dilation is slightly increased from the prior study with unchanged biliary duct dilation with stent in place.
Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and after venous access documenting vessel patency.
A final chest x- ray was obtained and demonstrated good position of the catheter.

Neurophysiology REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 539**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 540**]   CLINICAL HISTORY:  74-year-old woman with a diagnosis of adenoma of the papilla of Vater 2 months ago.
Directed neurological examination shows moderate wasting of distal muscles in the lower extremities.
Motor NCSs of the left tibial nerve showed mild-to-moderate prolongation of distal latency, increased temporal dispersion, moderately reduced response amplitudes, and normal conduction velocity.
Directed neurological examination shows moderate wasting of distal muscles in the lower extremities.
Motor NCSs of the left ulnar nerve showed mildly reduced response amplitude and mildly reduced conduction velocities.
Motor NCSs of the right deep peroneal nerve showed moderately reduced response amplitudes and markedly reduced conduction velocities.
Motor nerve conduction studies (NCSs) of the left tibial nerve showed normal distal latency, markedly reduced response amplitudes, and mildly reduced conduction velocity.
Motor NCSs of the right tibial nerve showed moderately prolonged distal latency, moderately reduced response amplitudes, and moderately reduced conduction velocity.
Sensory NCS of the left ulnar nerve showed normal response amplitude and mildly reduced conduction velocity.
EMG of vastus lateralis showed poor activation of long duration, markedly polyphasic units.
EMG of iliopsoas showed mild, ongoing denervation with moderately polyphasic units.
The electrophysiologic findings are most consistent with a moderately severe, subacute (between 3 weeks and 3 months duration) neurogenic disorder, which is motor > sensory and non-length dependent in distribution.
Similar to the study of [**2155-5-28**], activation is fair to poor throughout, suggesting a central nervous system contribution to the patient's weakness.

In addition, PP, vibration sense and proprioception was decreased, but this part of the exam was limited due to inattention and not reliable.
Neuro: MRI head, C/T spine showed no evidence of disease aside from some small vessel changes and some degenrative bony changes.
EMG most consistent with a moderately severe, subacute (between 3 weeks and 3 months duration) neurogenic disorder, which is motor > sensory and non-length dependent in distribution.
A sural nerve biopsy was recommended and performed by neurosurgery.
Sural nerve biopsy showed no pathological feature.
Oncologic workup hs yielded only suggestive evidence of malignancy (pancreatic duct dilatation).
Goal INR [**2-7**].
Last PTT 41.1. .
GI/Oncologic: Pt with mildly elevated amylase and lipase after her biliary stent placement.
CT abdomen performed earlier this admission, with evidence of 2 hypodense foci, may be c/w metastasis.
Patient underwent CT-guided biopsy of lesion.
FEN: Pt appears euvolemic on exam this AM.
