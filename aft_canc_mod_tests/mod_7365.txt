On [**2151-3-24**], he developed a severe headache, dizziness, and nausea, called EMS, and was brought to OSH ED where CT head showed a large right cerebellar hemorrhage.
Cardiac monitor revealed frequent PVCs, Cardiology was consulted, and home metoprolol was restarted.
Work-up to assess for splenomegaly/splenic sequestation as a possible etiology included abdominal imaging that revealed hepatic cirrhosis with portal hypertension, at least 3 liver lesions c/w HCC, portal vein thrombosis, numerous varices, and mild splenomegaly.
Was also noted to have a cystic lesion adjacent to the uncinate process of the pancreas and duodenal sweep, which could represent a duplication cyst vs. cystic pancreatic lesion vs. peripancreatic lymphangioma.
As part of an infectious work-up, UA had been sent [**3-29**] which suggested active infection --> patient was started on empirical ceftriaxone while urine culture pending.
Hepatology consulted, and felt that liver lesions were high concerning for HCC.
ABG: 7.34 pCO2 43 pO2 60 HCO324.
CXR [**3-25**] As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs of mild fluid overload have increased in severity.
Echo [**3-29**] Mildly dilated LA, RA; no significant valvular disease, EF >60%  CXR [**3-29**] Bibasilar pneumonia vs atelectasis, small R subpneumonic pleural effusion  Abd US [**3-29**] Cirrhotic liver w/3 masses ?HCC, splenic varices suggestive of portal HTN, borderline splenomegaly  Abd/Chest CT [**3-29**] Multiple liver lesions c/w HCC, cirrhosis w/small volume ascites, splenic/paraesophageal varices, thrombosed portal vein, borderline splenomegaly, cystic lesion in/near pancreatic head, possible calcified splenic artery aneurysm, b/l simple renal cysts, diverticulosis   Brief Hospital Course: 81 y/o with history of cerebellar hemorrhage in [**2149**] presents with complaint of headache found to have right cerebellar hemorrhage s/p evacuation with hospital course complicated by altered mental status, as well identification of hepatic lesions consisent with malignancy (primary multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma vs metastatic cholangiocarcinoma/pancreatic carcinoma) ultimately transferred to MICU for increasing respiratory distress.
