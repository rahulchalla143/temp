Electrocardiogram in the ED showed sinus tachycardia unchanged from prior.
In the ED, patient was seen by cardiology given history of pericardial effusions and bedsided echocardiogram was performed, and showed moderate effusion but did not reveal any RV diastolic collapse or significant AV respirophasic variation to suggest tamponade physiology.

Patient was admitted due to tachypnea, tachycardia, and difficult course with previous thoracentesis, which was complicated by post-procedure pulmonary oedema requiring diuresis.
