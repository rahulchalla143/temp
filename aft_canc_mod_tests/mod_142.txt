Attempts were made to wean her to NC but they were unsuccessful, as she was satting 88% on 4L NC.
She remained afebrile in the ED but was found to have WBC of 17.
Blood cultures were drawn prior to antibiotic administration.
CXR did not show PNA, but demonstrated progression of known lung cancer.
She underwent a CT head to rule out metastases, which was negative.
On transfer, patient was afebrile with HR- 77, BP- 112/49, RR- 16, SaO2- 98% on 15L NRB .
Sats were 97% on 5L NC and 95% high-flow with a face-tent.
-- [**2166-1-2**] Sputumcytology confirmed adenocarcinoma with a pattern of stainpositivity consistent with lung origin (CK7 and TTF-1 positive).
-- [**2166-5-23**] Chest CT showed partial response with interval improvement in the consolidation of the superior segment of the right lower lobe and nodular densities of the left lower lobe.
-- [**2166-8-13**] CT Chest shows increased density of right lower lobe consolidation and worsened peribronchiolar ground-glass opacities in the lingula are most consistent with worsening of widely disseminated non-small cell lung cancer, much less likely due to infection.

EKG: [**2-13**] Sinus rhythm at 68 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals, poor R-wave [**Last Name (LF) 4619**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]-depressions in V4-V6.
CXR: [**2-13**] SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post median sternotomy.
CT Head: [**2-13**] FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or recent infarction.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci reflects generalized atrophy, notably in the bifrontal extraaxial spaces.
CT chest [**2167-2-16**] IMPRESSION: 1.
On admission patient with chief complaints of progressive shortness of breath and non-productive cough.
On admission she was placed on NRB for treatment of O2 saturations in 70s saturations in the 70s.
Admission CXR with no definite infiltrate, though concern for progression of her known lung disease.
CXR on [**2-15**] demonstrates new left lower lobe consolidation.
Additional hypoxia work-up notable for negative biomarkers, negative LENIs; unable to perform CTA due to chronic kidney disease and creatinine 2.8.
Consolidation of left lower lobe evident on [**2-15**] likely secondary to infection rather than progression of disease due to short time course of infiltrate development (although on CT scan of [**2167-2-16**], the radiologist concluded the opposite: that changes seen were likely caused by her NSCLC, though pneumonia could not be absolutely ruled out).
Blood cultures no growth to date.
Multiple sputum cultures obtained; however, all contaminated with oral flora.
Urine legionella negative.
CT scan for evaluation of disease progression was obtained and did show further progression.
He plans to repeat her CT scan once she completes her antibiotics to further evaluate the rate of disease progression.
#  CKD stage III: Creatinine on admission 2.8, down to 2.4 by the time of discharge.
Follow-up Hct found to be 20.
The hematocrit did remain steady during [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course following tranfusion.
Your CT shows progression of your lung cancer with a probable superimposed pneumonia.
You were continued on antibiotics, and your oxygen levels were monitored closely.
[**Name (NI) **] plans to repeat your CT scan once you finish your antibiotics to further evaluate the rate of your disease progression.
As usual, please weigh yourself every morning, and [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
