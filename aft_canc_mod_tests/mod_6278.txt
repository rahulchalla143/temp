CT Chest showed a bilateral, moderate on the right and small to moderate on the left pleural effusions, associated with bibasal consolidations.
Repeat TTE on [**7-29**] showed a stable effusion.
Preliminary bone marrow biopsy was suspicious for a biphenotypic leukemia and therapy was initiated with hyperCVAD.
Other PMH: Disseminated Fusarium - [**5-14**] - treated with Ambisome and Voriconazole h/o hepatitis B - on lamivudine s/p appendectomy s/p umbilical hernia repair  Social History: Currently on disability.

Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.
CT ABD PELVIS [**2157-7-27**] 1.
TTE [**2157-7-28**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
ABDOMINAL US [**2157-7-28**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CHEST CT [**2157-7-28**] IMPRESSION: 1.
The amount of effusion appears to be slightly increased even compared to prior CT abdomen from less than 24 hours ago.
TTE [**2157-7-29**] The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-7-28**], no major change (no RV diastolic collapse was seen on review of the prior study).
CXR [**2157-7-29**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-27**], there is probably slightly less engorgement of the pulmonary vascularity.
TTE [**2157-7-30**] The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
TTE [**2157-8-1**] Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-7-30**], LV systolic dysfunction appears regional on the current study.
The size of the pericardial effusion and other findings are similar  CT THORAX [**2157-8-2**] IMPRESSION: 1.
The patient's [**7-21**] bone marrow showed 50% blasts.
Patient had neutropenic fever, in which all blood and urine cultures showed no growth and CT thorax showed no evidence of pneumonia or fungal infiltrate.
LFTs remained normal throughout admission with the exception of persistently elevated alk phos; CT abd on admission showed no evidence of liver or biliary abnormality and normal colon.
CT torso obtained after transfer to the floor did not suggest any intra-abdominal pathology; liver in particular looks normal.
Pulmonary consult was obtained and did not believe there was a thoracic cause to patient's abd pain and did not believe a bronchoscopy would be useful as there was no clinical or radiological evidence of pneumonia.
Cadiology consult was obtained and daily TTEs were performed to monitor for tamponade physiology.
Serial TTEs showed no evidence of tamponade for several days, thus cardiology recommended no further need to repeat daily TTEs.
Upon transfer to the floor, the patient had blood pressures within the normal range and pulsus <10.
Because the fluid collection around your heart appeared stable, you were transferred to the hematology/oncology floor, where you were given a 10 day course Decitabine chemotherapy for your chemotherapy.
CT scan and expert consultation did not reveal a source of your abdominal pain, which resolved on its own.
