FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with the patient in sitting semi-upright position.
Analysis is performed in direct comparison with a similar study obtained one day earlier.
Pulmonary vasculature shows slightly more marked perivascular haze and diffuse densities on the bases are again suggestive of moderate amount of bilateral pleural effusion and perhaps slightly more on the right than the left.
Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2139-9-22**]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 55% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Ascending: *3.7 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT VENTRICLE: Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably normal (LVEF>55%).
There was no evidence for leukemic or hematologic malignancy on smear; it was recommended that if her neutrophils and bands were <1000 she should be placed on neutropenic precautions.
She will need to follow up with her primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the [**Location (un) **] area, for a finding on her chest CT (see pertinent results).

Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): hold for HR <60; SBP <110.
You will also need to follow up with your primary care doctor (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59993**] in [**Location (un) **]) for further work up of a nodule found on chest CT imaging at [**Hospital1 18**].
