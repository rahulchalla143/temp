Had been constipated x few days but had a BM x2 this morning that was nonbloody.
In the ED, vital signs were 97.1, HR 56, BP 126/64 RR 16 Sat 97% on Room Air.
ECG showed < 1mm [**Apartment Address(1) **],3 w/ 1 mm STD 1, aVL and was discussed with Cardiology fellow.
First set of cardiac enzymes were negative.
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (from OMR): The patient was diagnosed with AML in [**9-22**] on routine blood work that showed pancytopenia, bone marrow biopsy showed myelodysplasia with no cytogenetic abnormalities, repeat bone marrow biopsy showed acute erythroleukemia admitted [**2-23**] for induction chemotherapy with 7+3 cytarabine and idarubicin, which she tolerated well, Day 14 bone marrow showed zero blasts, consistent with complete ablation.
Physical Exam: VS 97.9 BP 131/70 HR 65 RR 18 Sat 98% 1K Gen: Elderly appearing female in NAD.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 6 cm.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.

Tracing at 15:59:26 Sinus bradycardia at HR 51 bpm, Q waves in II (1mmx0.5mm), III, aVF, TWI in III aVF still with ~0.5-1mm STE.
CXR [**2192-6-10**]: 1.
If further evaluation is required, right lateral decubitus views of the abdomen can be obtained.
Cardiac Cath [**2192-6-11**] 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe 2 vessel coronary disease.
The RCA had serial stenoses, the greatest of which was 99% in the mid-portion with evidence of thrombus or dissection.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial blood pressure with an SBP of 136 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography was not performed.
Successful thrombectomy, and direct stenting of the proximal and mid RCA lesions with overlapping (distal to proximal) 3x33, 3.5x13,3.5x23, 3.5x13mm cypher stents post dilated to 4.0mm.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-5-15**], the inferior wall motion abnormality is new and the right ventricular basal free wall motion abnormality is also new.
MYOCARDIAL ELEVATION, TRANSIENT ST ELEVATION The patinet was started on heparin in the ED after she developed transient ST elevations in inferior leads and lateral STD; initial cardiac enzymes were negative.
ECG evolved over the next six hours with TWI in interior leads and resolution of lateral STD.
Biomarkers returned positive later (peak CK 1500, peak troponin 6.89 at 2p [**6-11**]), and she was started on integrilin and plavix loaded with 600mg PO x1.
ECG on am of [**2192-6-11**] had reemergence of lateral STD and she was taken to the catheterization lab.
Post Cath ECHO showed EF 44% and basal hypokinesis.
She had no other complaints at the time, SBP was 90s, and exam was normal except for diffuse blanching erythema.
She had a post-cath check at 9:40pm, at which time her VS included T 100.0, BP 110/53, and she was given an IVF bolus.
A trigger was called at midnight [**2192-6-12**] for BP 71/31, with HR 94 and T 102.8.
Exam was unchanged and with clear lungs, ECG with Q waves and <1mm STE inferiorly.
Repeat labs showed stable Hct, CEs trending down, creatinine 1.4 up from 0.9.
She was quickly titrated off dopamine and her blood pressures normalized.
ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY:  She was diagnosed by cortisol stim test during admission last year.
Blood glucose was elevated secondary to steroids.

It was diagnosed with coronary angiography and treated with a stent to the artery.
