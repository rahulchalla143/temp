IMAGING: CT Abd/Pelvis with contrast [**2153-7-31**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Moderate to large amount of non-hemorrhagic ascites with mesenteric and periportal edema, findings consistent with shock physiology and recent aggressive volume resuscitation.
Delayed excretion of contrast from both kidneys, findings suggestive of acute renal failure, correlate clinically.
CXR [**2153-7-31**]: IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process  TTE [**2153-8-7**]: The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-8-1**], both left and right ventricular cavities are now smaller.
TTE [**2153-8-24**]: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
An apical intracavitary gradient is identified.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-8-7**], the left ventricle is now quite small and hyperdynamic.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended to exclude vegetations.
No definite vegetations seen  CXR [**2153-8-26**]: Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to [**2153-8-24**].
The possibility of tracheostomy and PEG were discussed with her and her family, but were prevented by the development of fungemia.
On the morning of [**8-26**], her O2 requirement increased, urine output decreased and she developed bilateral infiltrates on CXR concerning for infection or ARDS.
#Sepsis: The patient presented with neutropenic fever and shock requiring 3 pressors presumed secondary to sepsis from GI source given signs of colitis on CT imaging.
As above, she again developed signs of sepsis on [**8-26**] from presumed pulmonary source given poor oxygenation and diffuse bilateral infiltrates on CXR and broad antibiotic coverage was restarted.
#Fungemia: Blood cultures from [**8-21**] grew [**Female First Name (un) **] and pt was started on micafungin for planned 4 week course, PICC line removed.
#Anemia: HGB/HCT trended down with initial HCT 38.8 and subsequent HCT in low to mid 20s requiring 5 blood transfusions throughout her admission.
Additionally her retic count was low at .5% indicating poor bone marrow function in the setting of known multiple myeloma.
#ELEVATED INR: INR noted to be elevated to peak 1.9, likely due to combination of poor nutrition and antibiotic therapy.
