By report, CT showed a large left temporal hemorrhagic mass with midline shift and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up.
Neurosurgery was consulted and CT head was requested.

Head CT was done which showed a large L frontal hemorrhagic mass with midline shift.
Head CT showed residual hemorrhage and tumor with effacement of L ventricle.
MRI was ordered and showed residual tumor, midline shift, L uncal herniation, and entrapment of the R temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
On morning rounds of [**10-15**] the patients exam was noted to be worsening so he was taken to the operating room for a stereotactic aspiration of cyst which was located medial to the residual tumor.
30cc of fluid was drained and post-operatively his imaging and exam did not improve.
A post-op head CT was done which showed improved midline shift and resection of the mass.
Post Op MRI showed improved hydrocephalus, resolving Pneumocephalus and question of left frontal hyperintensity.
His exam was improved post-operatively as well as he was spontaneously moving his left side and was withdrawing his RUE and RLE to noxious stimuli.
On the morning of [**10-17**] his exam was unchanged and his intracranial drain was at 5cm H2O above the tragus.
He had a head CT which showed essentially no change from the previous day with the exception of a slight interval decrease in the size of the R lateral ventricle.
The decision was made to pull the patient's drain on [**10-18**], which he tolerated well.
The post EVD pull CT demonstrated decrease in pneumocephalus with no new hemorrhage or midline.
His exam remained unchanged.
His exam remains stable.
?You will need a CT of the brain with contrast.
