Hct on arrival was 20.4 and BP only in the 50s.
EGD showed ulcerative gastropathy with multiple ulcers but no active source of bleeding so no intervention.
On [**6-1**] another EGD showed an arterial bleed in the post-bulbar region.
Since surgery the patient has been hemodynamically stable however his hct has trended from 32 to 25 today.
Today he got a unit of blood but he only bumped to 26.5 and concerned that he may be oozing from somewhere so transferred here for further care including possibly an angiogram and embolization.
He also had a urine culture that grew ESBL sensitive to bactrim, ceftazadime, amikacin.
Pertinent Results: From OSH: WBC 32, HCT 26, PLT 179K, NA 145, K4.3, Cl 121, Bicarb 22, BUN 40, Creatinine 1.6, Calcium 8.2, Mg 1.9, INR 1.3, PTT 16.3 .
Micro:  cultures including urine pending from OSH.
EKG from OSH (report no actual image sent over): NSR with LAFB and marked ST abnormality suggesting possible inferior subendocardial injury new from prior.

Vitals remained stable.
Underwent angiography at that time and had R gastroepiploic artery embolized with gel foam.
Serum H pylori and CMV viral load were negative.
After transfer to the floor, Hct was 24 but Hct continued to slowly trend down and he was noted to have liquid black stool, so he was made NPO once again and received several transfusions with 2 units per day for several days.
EGD was performed on Also was noted to have liquid black stool, so had an EGD on [**6-10**] that showed fresh blood but no source of active bleeding.
NG lavage was performed and was negative, and patient was taken to EGD for a second time on [**6-16**].
EGD showed erosive esophagitis, which was injected with epinephrine, gastritis, and multiple ulcers, and a bleeding sessile polyp in the duodenum (which was not biopsied).
After this EGD, pt continued to have occasional melena however Hgb and Hct remained stable around 25-26.
Hct 25.2 on discharge.
# Ulcer/bleeding workup: Given numerous bleed sources and multiple ulcers, workup was performed for Zollinger [**Doctor Last Name 9480**] syndrome with serum gastrin level, which was normal, but given high suspicion secretin stimulation test was done which is still pending on discharge.
Biopsy of ulcer was performed that showed no evidence of malignancy and was negative for H. pylori.
# Leukamoid reaction: Patient was on decadron but WBC count has trended upward to a peak of 32.
His foley catheter was discontinued and his WBC decreased throughout hospital course.
# Presumed acute renal failure: Unknown baseline but patient had creatinine up to 2.3 at OSH presumed [**1-12**] hypotension/hypovolemia.
Oxazepam was also continued when patient able to take PO  # Transitional Issues: -Please keep wife informed of patient care: His wife is [**Name (NI) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 110835**]  -Please continue the TPN: Non-Standard TPN Volume(ml/d): 2050 Amino Acid(g/d):110 Dextrose(g/d):385 Fat(g/d):55 Trace Elements will be added daily and Standard Adult Multivitamins NaCL:80 NaAc:0 NaPO4:10 KCl:50 KAc:0 KPO4:0 MgS04:16 CaGluc:8 Insulin(units): 55 This is the total volume of solution per 24 hours.
