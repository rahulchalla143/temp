Admission Date:  [**2151-11-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-12-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2079-5-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Black Stool  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD [**2151-11-25**] Bronchoscopy [**2151-11-26**]  History of Present Illness: 72yoF with h/o a.fib, CVA on chronic coumadin,s/p renal transplant and h/o PUD presents with black stools and increasing weakness and fatigue over past week.
SHe states she had her INR drawn friday and it was 3.1.
The coumadin clinic she saw told her to return to her regular doses (3mg T, TH, Sat and 4mg M,W,F,SUn) which she has.
NG lavage was performed which showed coffee grounds.
Her INR was found to be elevated to 8.
The lymphoid infiltrate is diffusely immunoreactive for pan B-cell marker CD20, with co-expression of bcl-6 (subset), and CD10 (slide B).
The tumor cells are negative for bcl-2, bcl-1, and TdT.
[**Last Name (un) **] ([**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] encoded RNA) hybridization studies were positive within a large subset of atypical lymphocytes.
CXR's: CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2151-11-23**] 7:17 PM FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest.
CXR [**11-28**];Left lung remains collapsed.
Subsequent chest radiograph 5:30 a.m. on [**11-29**] shows standard re-positioning.
CXR  [**12-1**]: The left hemithorax is completely opacified due to known lung collapse.
Evaluation of the left lung demonstrates unchanged perihilar and right lower lobe heaviness, which might be attributed to mild volume overload, accompanied by small pleural effusion.
CXR [**12-6**]:Moderately increased opacification of previously minimal right lung base opacity since [**2151-12-4**] may represent enlarged effusion or pneumonia.
CXR [**12-8**]: In comparison with the study of [**12-6**], there is little change.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-11-5**], the left ventricule appears small and underfilled.

An INR on admission was 8.0.
Given her Hct drop of 32 to 24, she received 1 unit prbcs.
She was evaluated by GI who performed an EGD on [**2151-11-26**] after her INR had corrected with 2 additional doses of vitamin K.  The EGD showed an AVM in the duodenal bulb but no active bleeding.
She was noted to have blood pressures that were trending down into the SBP 80's and MAP's 50-60 and was transfused two units on both events.
# Pulmonary mass: Recently diagnosed and chest CT during recent admission showed soft tissue density within left main bronchus extending into LUL and LLL causing complete LUL collapse and partial LLL collapse.
CXR reveals worsening of left lung collapse.
Finally, pathology then revealed that the tumor was a high grade Non-Hodgkin's B-Cell Lymphoma (EBV+) that was likely post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
She was also given antibiotics: Vancomycin for a enteroccocus UTI sensitive to Vancomycin; She was also initially given Zosyn and Vanc for empiric PNA treatment which was changed to Meropenem and Cipro once Pseudomonas was cultured from her entotrachial sputum samples.
All blood cultures were negative.
Subsequent urine cultures were clear of bacteria.
Her blood pressure eventually stabalized, and she was weaned off of pressors.
She needed almost daily fluid boluses to maintain her blood pressures SBP>80 and MAP>60.
An echo was obtain to evaluated for pericardial effusion or LV collapse from adjacent lung mass; there were no significant abnormalities to explain hypotension.
# ARF: Prior to her [**Month (only) **] admission, baseline creatinine appears to be 1.0-1.2.
Had renal U/S during her last admission at which time her renal graft appeared unremarkable.
Urine lytes showed FENA<1%, there were no casts in her urine.
Her creatinine continued to worsened to 3.6 despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and she became oliguric.
Based on a low urine uric acid/creatinine ratio, the renal transplant team did not believe that she had urate nephropathy.
Her creatinine and urine output then began improving with a high level of dilute urine output consistent with ATN.
Her sodium improved after fluid rescusitation.
She then became hypernatremic again and required free water administration, which successfully reduced her sodium from 150->144.
Her uric acid levels then remained within normal range with continued allopurinol.
Her sugars were monitored, but no intervention needed.
