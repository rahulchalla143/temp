Pt originally presented to [**Hospital3 **] [**2102-11-27**] with wheezing, so chest CT was obtained showing right hilar 3 cm mass encasing bronchus.
A head MR showed multiple ring-enhancing lesions and he was eventually diagnosed with metastatic lung Ca.
CXR and chest CT showed right upper lobe mass.
Bronch performed [**2103-2-13**] at [**Hospital 17065**] Hospital showed 3cm lesion encasing right hilar bronchus.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation (hospitalized [**Date range (3) 59129**]).
In the ED, T 97.5, BP originally 165/47, HR 51.
Head Ct showed bleeing in one of the brain mets.
Pt reported CP, ECG showed new V2-V6 ST depressions, has VT arrest.
Received epiX1, atropineX2, pulse returned.

MR C/T/L Spine [**2103-3-9**]: 1) Cervicothoracic imaging reveals no evidence of bony metastases or cord impingement.
2) Lumbosacral spine imaging demonstrates normal vertebrae and no abnormal enhancement to indicate metastatic infiltration.
CXR [**2103-4-4**] 1) Lung nodules are unchanged.
CT head [**2103-4-4**] 1) Multiple cerebral metastases as seen in the prior MRI from [**2103-3-8**].
This appears to be new when compared to the MRI from [**2103-3-8**].
