Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder diagnosed in     [**10/2196**] from a biopsy during a colonoscopy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial physical, blood pressure 150/84; heart rate 114; respiratory rate 24; temperature maximum 101.6 F.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 3,000, hematocrit 18.3 and platelets 80.
Blood cultures initially were negative.
Herpes virus 6 antigen was negative.
EBV PCR was negative and CMV was negative on [**11-7**].
A chest x-ray at that time was negative for pneumonia.
Her initial Chem-7 was 142/4.1, 107/25, 25/1.9, glucose of 164.
AST 15, ALT 33, and t-bilirubin 0.2.
The patient was transfused two units of blood on [**2196-12-6**] for a hematocrit of 15.4.
The patient's initial CMV PCR analysis was positive for CMV, for which the patient was started on ganciclovir.
On [**12-12**], the patient continued to have pancytopenia with a white cell count of 1.2 and a hematocrit of 21.
The patient also continued to show some signs and symptoms of acute rejection of the graft and on the [**12-12**], the patient had a BUN of 11 and a creatinine of 1.6.
On the [**12-14**], the patient had the third dose of the patient's Rituxan therapy which was started previous to her current admission.
During the end of [**Month (only) **] and early part of [**Month (only) 1096**], the patient's BUN and creatinine continued to increase.
The patient's signs and symptoms were consistent with acute renal failure secondary to rejection.
Just prior to scheduling the nephrectomy, the patient's creatinine and BUN had improved and the nephrectomy was put on hold by recommendations from the primary Renal medicine service.
All of the family's (and patient's) questions were answered and the patient was taken tho the operating room.
The patient had an exploratory laparotomy and resection of the mid-jejunum with primary anastomosis and an allograft nephrectomy.
Over that time, the patient continued to spike intermittently and received multiple blood cultures, urine cultures, and chest x-rays which could not locate a source for the infection.
During the hospitalization, the patient did have a wound culture which was positive for VRE and also urinary cultures which were positive for VRE which were treated with the appropriate antibiotics.
In the beginning of [**Month (only) 404**], the patient had a repeat CMV PCR and [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Location (un) **] virus PCR to evaluate for possible viral infections.
The CMV PCR was negative and on discharge the EBV PCR was still pending.
The patient, in the beginning of [**Month (only) 404**], had a CT scan which showed marked improvement of abscesses in the abdomen.
The patient's blood cultures were negative.
The patient's urinalysis was negative and urine cultures were negative.
The patient's CMV PCR was negative and the patient's [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Location (un) **] virus PCR is pending right now.
An ultrasound was performed of the Porta-Cath which showed no abnormalities or fluid collections.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Included a temperature maximum of 100.1 F., temperature current of 97.2 F.; pulse of 88; blood pressure 110/70; respiratory rate 20; O2 94%, p.o.
Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Laboratory values were white cells 3.1, hematocrit 16.8, platelets 103,000, PT 12.7, PTT 30.9, INR 1.1.
Chem-7 is 140/4.2, 104/27, 17/0.6 and a glucose of 81.
Vancomycin level was 21.9, and valproic acid level was 38.
The patient will also follow-up with Hematology/Oncology     and have a PET scan at the [**Hospital3 328**] Center on [**2-7**],     at 07:30.
The patient is also scheduled for an endoscopic     examination with ultrasounds on [**2197-2-10**], at 11 a.m. at     [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] One.
The patient will also require a CT scan of the torso     which should be done with intravenous contrast and     scheduled with Dialysis.
The patient should also have Vancomycin levels checked     regularly and to have the Vancomycin dosed if the level     falls below 15.
