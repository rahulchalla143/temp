Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation  History of Present Illness: History of Present Illness: The pt is a 78 yo M with a h/o CAD, HTN, HL, DM who presents from his PCP's office after routine CBC showed 66% atypical white blood cells and low platelets on a routine CBC.
His PCP drew [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CBC which showed 66% atypical white cells and thrombocytopenia with a normal white cell count and hematocrit.
In the ED, the patient was noted to have no evidence of bleeding but labs concerning for DIC and tumor lysis.
Other Past Medical History: CAD - stable angina Gout - no recent flares HTN PUD - last EGD [**2169**] Type II DM - A1c 6.2% on metformin   Social History: He lives with his partner, [**Name (NI) **], who he has been with for over 50yrs and married to for 6 yrs.
Last HIV negative 1 year ago, Hepatitis negative in the distant past.
Physical Exam: On Admission: VS: T: 100.6 F, BP 130/78, HR 96, RR 20, O2sat 100% on RA GEN: AOx3, NAD HEENT: PERRLA.

# APML: He was diagnosed with APML with 56% blasts on differential [**2174-3-18**].
His blasts and WBC subsequently decreased, and on smear [**2174-4-4**] his myelocytes showed differentiation with improving status of his leukemia.
As a consequence of treatment, his course was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome with his uric acid peaking above 10, with a change an increase in creatinine to 2.5 initially and subsequently higher as described below.
His CXR after intubation showed a fluffy infiltrate suggestive of either ARDS or hemorrhage (likely both).
Due to his subdural hematomas, he was transfused to goals of Hct>30, plts > 100, fibrinogen > 175, and INR <1.6.
Once the DIC resolved, his goals changed to Hct>25, plts > 20, fibrinogen > 100, and INR <1.6.
# Acute renal failure: His creatinine sharply rose from 1.2 on admission to a peak of 4.9.
This was thought to be in the setting of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) and abdominal compartment syndrome.
His urine output responded.
Shortly after he began autodiuresing He was initiated on dialysis for AMS as described above and a BUN of greater than 200.
He was treated with dialysis with a fall in BUN to 113, however, he had a fever to 100.6 and cultures came back positive for GPC in chains from dialysis catheter [**2174-4-9**].
His CVVH was stopped and he was allowed to diurese on his own with support of lasix and metolazone as needed.
# Atrial Fibrillation / Flutter: He developed tachycardia to the 140s with initial EKG most consistent with Afib, and later EKG more consistent with Aflutter vs AVNRT.
In the setting of controlling his blood pressure with IV medications he received multiple doses of metoprolol and labetalol, and he converted to NSR.
However, [**4-1**] he converted back to rapid a-fib with RVR and required uptitration of his B-blockade and a diltiazem drip which was eventually converted back to PO.
They felt that medical management and blood pressure control were the best means of treatment.
# Positive Blood Cultures: Blood cultures were positive in [**2-16**] bottles from his PICC line on [**2174-3-22**].
The aerobic culture was speciated as Staph aureus.
No peripheral culture was obtained on that date.
He had a fever to 100.6 on [**2174-4-9**] and cultures were drawn from his dialysis catheter which were positive for GPCs in chains.
# Pericardial Fat Pad: On echo on [**2174-3-24**] there was concern for pericardial effusion because the echo showed a new anterior pericardial effusion with complex echodensity.
His repeat echo showed that the effusion was actually a fat pad.
