2.3 cm oval radiopaque lesion overlying the right inferior aspect of the liver is uncertain in location but also appeared to be present on the [**2150-1-24**] chest film and could represent a gallstone, though this is uncertain.

No ASD or PFO by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is mildly hypokinetic.
Brief Hospital Course: As mentioned in the HPI Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a cardiac cath which revealed severe AS, native CAD with clean bypass grafts.
All preoperative surgical work-up was performed and on [**2150-1-16**] she was brought to the operating room where she [**Date Range 1834**] a redo-sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
Chest x-ray revealed small right apical PTX which slowly decreased in size throughout hospital course.
Her WBC remained elevated throughout hospital course (secondary to CML) but multiple blood and urine cultures were performed to r/o infection.
