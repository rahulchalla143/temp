HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62 year old white male with an extensive past medical history significant for coronary artery disease requiring coronary artery bypass graft, history of inferior myocardial infarction, status post St. Jude valve for mitral valve prolapse in [**2169**], AICD for ventricular tachycardia, CHF with EF of 25%, history of CVA, history of ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic renal insufficiency, occluded left RA, peripheral vascular disease, history of recent lower GI bleed.
There he had two negative CKs and troponins, but he was sent to [**Hospital1 69**] for further workup of his GI bleed and further treatment.
CHF with EF of 25%.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm which is 3 to 3.5 mm in diameter.
Occluded left renal artery most likely with chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine of 2.5 to 3.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate was 78, blood pressure 162/76, sating 97% on 2 liters, respiratory rate 20.
Dorsalis pedis pulse was palpable.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count was 8.8, 82.5 neutrophils, 10 lymphocytes, 5 monocytes, 2 eosinophils, 5 basophils, hematocrit 24.9, platelets 127.
Sodium was 141, potassium 3.9, chloride 108, bicarb 24, BUN 46, creatinine 2.2, glucose 99.
CK was 54.
INR was 2.7, PTT 26.2.
UA was yellow, clear with specific gravity of 1.010, trace protein.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 93 beats per minute with normal axis, ST depressions and T wave inversions in aVL, 1, aVF, 2, V4, V6.
His chest pain, along with the EKG changes, was thought to be secondary to his anemia.
He has a history of chest pain with hematocrit decreases below 30.
Consequently the treatment in this situation was for blood transfusion.
However, because of his congestive heart failure and clinical evidence of pulmonary edema, the blood transfusion would have to be closely monitored.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled and were negative.
Troponin was 0.4.
CKs were 43, 45 and 102.
The goal was to keep his hematocrit above 30.
He had been actually hypertensive with blood pressure between 140s and 200s despite probable bleeding from the GI tract.
He had colonoscopy done on [**2172-12-2**].
He will need to be continued on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2 to 3.
Because of his GI bleed issues and his anemia, cardiac catheterization was deferred on this admission.
His creatinine actually increased from 2.2 to 2.5 to 2.6.
His creatinine was monitored.
However, once he no longer had hematochezia his hematocrit remained stable.
Clonazepam 0.5 to 1 mg p.o.
