Chest x-ray showed a density at the right base with right mediastinal shift.
A CT of the chest showed complete collapse of the right lower lobe secondary to an endobronchial lesion.
She also reportedly had some mediastinal adenopathy and a right hilar mass, reported visible on chest x-rays from [**2106-9-19**], with indeterminate follow-up mediastinoscopy.
She was admitted at that point on [**6-19**] for bronchoscopy for biopsy of the right mainstem endobronchial lesion.
The pathology returned that day positive for squamous cell carcinoma.
?, heart rate 95, blood pressure 170/48, respirations 20.
LABORATORY DATA:  From [**Hospital 2079**] Hospital white count was 20.2, hematocrit 45.3, platelet count 209; CHEM7 with a sodium of 137, potassium 4.7, chloride 98, bicarb 30, BUN 22, creatinine 0.8, glucose 189; LFTs were unremarkable.
Chest x-ray done at the outside revealed volume loss, likely postobstructive collapse involving the right lung with associated atelectasis.
Chest CT done on [**6-19**] showed complete collapse of the right lower lobe secondary to endobronchial lesion.
She received a CT of the airway with reconstruction and preparation for the rigid interventional bronchoscopy.
She went to Interventional Bronchoscopy on [**6-22**], which revealed a mass within the right mainstem bronchus occluding the origin of the right upper lobe bronchus, measuring approximately 13 x 9 mm in diameter.
Her arterial blood gases continued to show adequate ventilation.
Her lung exam appeared improved with less wheezing and fewer rhonchi, and her white count decreased to within normal limits by this time.
She was however prescribed Diltiazem for the rate control, and no further episodes of atrial fibrillation or flutter occurred.
A CT of the head with contrast was performed to look for CNS metastases of which there was no evidence.
