He developed progressive dyspnea on exertion, which prompted an admission to [**Hospital **] Hospital, at which time his hematocrit was noted to be 16.
He has also noticed a non-tender ulceration on his penis, which developed within the last week.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 97.9, BP 122/72, HR 67, RR 18, Sat 94% on 2L (documented, but when seen he was off oxygen) Gen: Pale appearing, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, ?petechiae on uvula Neck: Supple, no thyromegaly Nodes: No cervical, supraclavicular or subclavicular lympahdenopathy appreciated; shottly inguinal lymphadenopathy L>R Heart: RRR, normal S1/S2, no m/r/g Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, normal bowel sounds; no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated Back: No spinal tenderness, no costovertebral angle tenderness GU: Painless chancre on left side of penis, between shaft and head of penis, draining purulent material Ext: No clubbing/cyanosis/edema Neuro: A&O x 3   Pertinent Results: .
CXR [**3-31**]: CHEST, TWO VIEWS: No prior for comparisons.
CXR [**4-1**]: Comparison with the previous study done on [**2143-3-31**].
CXR showed possible LLL PNA.
As his peripheral smear showed blasts, he was then transferred to the BMT service.
Stat ECHO showed a pericardial effusion although he had no pulsus paradoxus.
They removed over 300mL of fluid and those cultures were negative.
He underwent a pericardiocentesis to drain the fluid and it did not reacumulate based on several surveillence ECHOs.
As his counts returned, a repeat bone marrow preliminarily showed a sick marrow but no obvious evidence of leukemia.
All of his cultures were negative.
His chest CT and xrays showed patchy infiltrates.
A beta glucan retured at 161; galactomanin was negative.
THe patient had a BAL which was negative except for 3 colonies of yeast among large amounts of oral flora.
He had two MRIs of the liver (one while still neutropenic and one after his counts recovered) to rule out obvious fungal infections in the liver; both were negative.
He should have his LFTs monitored closely as an outpatient while on voriconazole.
He was intially ruled out for AMI with negative cardiac enzymes and had a negative CTA to rule out PE.
All infectious test were negative (RPR, GC/chlamydia).
Oxygen saturation above 92% on RA.
You will likely need another CAT scan of your chest to evaluate the pneumonia.
You should NOT take your lipitor (atorvastatin) because your liver enzymes are elevated and this medication can interact with the liver.
