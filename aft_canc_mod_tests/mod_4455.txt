[**2196-3-18**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST: The evaluation of the mediastinum demonstrates several small non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates splenic calcification, nonspecific stranding in the perirenal area and otherwise is unremarkable within the limitations of the study that was not designed for evaluation of intra-abdominal pathology.
The evaluation of the lungs demonstrates new anterior segment of right upper lobe and posterior segment of right lower lobe and part of right middle lobe tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities as well as peribronchial opacities.
[**2196-3-26**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect or acute territorial infarction.
[**2196-4-5**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-31**], there is persistent and probably increasing opacification at the left base consistent with pneumonia.
[**2196-4-7**] MRI of the head:  1.
# Fevers/Fatigue/Shortness of breath: Admission chest CT demonstrated bilateral infiltrates, and BAL was positive for PCP (patient had been noncompliant w outpatient PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]).
Follow-up CXR [**3-31**] demonstrated persistant bilateral pneumonia, but patient respiratory status improved and as transfered back to the floor.
MRI of the head, CT of the head and LP was unremarkable for a acute process.
EEG revealed a pattern of mild to moderate encephalopathy.
Multiple CSF PCR viral tests were pending at the time of death.
Films were obtained and demonstrated a right hip fracture.
Daily blood counts were trended and was transfused several units of blood and platelets.
# Transfusion Reaction: Patient was noted to have a raise in temperature of > 2 degrees during a blood transfusion.
Blood sample was sent to blood bank for review and patient was noted to have new anti-E antibody (see full transfusion work-up summary in OMR).
Vancomycin, Meropenem, Voriconazole, Acyclovir were also given, with Meropenem stopped [**3-31**] and plan to stop Vancomycin [**4-1**] given clinical improvement.
Of note, CXR on [**3-31**] showed bilateral infiltrates but this was thought to be due to continued PCP.
