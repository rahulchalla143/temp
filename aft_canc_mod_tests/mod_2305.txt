CT [**12-23**] - 1.
Subfalcine herniation with 7 mm of rightward midline shift.
CT [**2122-12-24**] - Postoperative changes, with a moderate size residual left subdural hematoma containing some acute blood.
CT [**2122-12-27**] - Stable appearance of left-sided subdural collection with interval decrease in component of pneumocephalus.
EEG - This is an abnormal EEG due to the right temporal more then left frontocentral slowing, slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
An encephalopathic pattern is frequently seen with infections, toxic metabolic abnormalities, medication effect and ischemia.
CXR - PA/LAT: Comparison is made to earlier on the prior day.
Brief Hospital Course:    Ms. [**Known lastname 15513**] was taken immediately to the OR where she underwent a craniectomy for evacuation of a left sided chronic with acute component.
She had a craniectomy due to the fact that the piece of her skull that was removed was contaminated.
She appeared to have a mental status change on [**12-24**] and a repeat CT showed no change but a Dilantin level was 35.
Her renal function remained at baseline 4.4, ruled out for an MI and TSH was 2.9.
A repeat head CT on [**12-27**] showed improved shift and effacment of ventricles slight reduced subdural.
A CXR showed a right lower lobe pneumonia, she was started on Levaquin.
