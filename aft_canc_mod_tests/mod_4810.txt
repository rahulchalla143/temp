CTA chest was negative for PE, but revealed large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules.
She was initially on diltiazem drip which was transitioned to oral diltiazem on the floor, during which time she was in NSR  Today patietn underwent bronchoscopy which revealed near total collapse of the left mainstem bronchus and 50% collapse of the bronchus intermedius.
Trans bronchial biopsy was obtained with significant bleeding of at least 50 cc.

TRACING #1  ECG [**2104-5-9**]: Atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation with a controlled response.
TRACING #2  ECG [**2104-5-9**]: Sinus rhythm.
TRACING #3   CXR [**2104-5-9**]: SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: The mediastinal contour is markedly abnormal, with right tracheal deviation and right paratracheal abnormal soft tissue density.
Pulmonary metastases, severe mediastinal lymphadenopathy due to melanoma.
CXR [**2104-5-9**]: IMPRESSION: Nasogastric tube in satisfactory position, some upper mediastinal shift.
CXR [**2104-5-10**]: IMPRESSION: Improved right lung consolidation could have been due to aspiration.
Otherwise, stable appearances since yesterday's chest radiograph.
Staging CT Torso [**2104-5-15**] 1.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**5-15**] No significant abnormalities are seen on MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium  CT Chest [**5-28**] 1)Interval development of patchy consolidation in the right upper and right middle lobe is most likely due to radiotherapy and a small right pleural effusion is now moderately large, the left pleural effusion has slightly increased and remains small.
CXR ([**2104-6-2**]) - As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
Pathology from the endobronchial ultrasound was consistent with malignant melanoma.
The hematology oncology service was consulted and brain and abdominal imaging for staging were obtained.
She was started emperically on vancomycin and zosyn, which was later changed to vancomycin and unasyn after sputum culture grew Moraxella.
TTE as well as chest imaging demonstrated compression of the left atrium from the mediastinal mass.
