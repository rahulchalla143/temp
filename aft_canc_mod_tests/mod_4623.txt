A PPD was placed on [**7-30**], and was read on [**8-1**] as nonreactive (completely negative).
During workup in the ED she had a CXR which showed a large cardiac silloute and fluid overload with possible RML infection.
Her EKG showed diffusely low voltages but no ST depressions.

Patient was found to have a pulsus paradoxus of 20 mmHg.

# [**8-5**], Portable CXR FINDINGS: There are diffuse bilateral interstitial alveolar opacities.
Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis recommended to assess for underlying infection.
# [**2188-8-6**] ECHO (pre-pericardiocentesis) FOCUSED STUDY: The right ventricular cavity is unusually small.
# [**2188-8-6**] ECHO (post-pericardiocentesis) Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-8-6**], the large pericardial effusion has resolved.
# [**2188-8-7**], ECHO The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
# TTE ([**2188-8-11**]) The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-8-7**], the pericardial effusion is minimally larger, but remains very small.
# [**2188-8-7**] ECG Sinus rhythm.
# [**2188-8-7**] CT chest w/ contrast IMPRESSION: 1.
Lytic metastasis, D11 vertebral body with invasion of the spinal canal and impingement on thecal sac anteriorly.
# [**2188-8-8**] C/T/L spine MRI Evaluation of the cervicothoracic spine demonstrates osseous metastases at C2, C7 and T11.
Due to motion artifact, axial images are markedly limited.
Evaluation of the lumbar spine demonstrates no evidence for osseous metastatic disease.
# [**2188-8-10**] ECG Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2188-8-7**] the R wave progression is less prominent.
Further workup showed metastatic lung adenocarcinoma to the spine c/b T11 compression fracture without cord compression.
CT abdomen showed circumferential fluid in pericardium.
Bedside ECHO showed RV collapse consistent with tamponard physiology.
Due to shortness of breath and inability to lie flat, pt was intubated and sent to cath lab for pericardiocentesis, which drained ~700 cc sanguous fluid.
Post-procedure ECHO showed minimal residue fluid accumulation.
Interval changes measured by ECHO and daily pulsus did not show evidence of reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.
# metastatic adenocarcinoma-lung primary: Pt's presenting chest x-ray showed diffuse reticulonodular pattern, concerning for TB, or carcinomatosis.
As part of the workup, pt underwent bronchoscopy with BAL.
Pathology stain of the pericardiofluid and BAL showed adenocarcinoma of lung primary.
Lung metastastes were noted at multiple vertebral bodies, adrenals, and liver on imaging.
Spinal MRI was obtained due to patient's complaints of lower back pain.
There was evidence of compression fracture at T11 on both chest CT and spinal MRI, without significant cord compression.
Chest CT revealed bilateral pleural effusion and density in RLL concerning for post-obstructive pneumonia.
BAL, sputum culture, blood culture, urine culture showed no growth.
Patient's liver enzymes peaked on HD3 and has been down trending since then, suggesting the transaminitis is largely caused by hepatic congestion.
Given the special culture background, social worker was involved, and family meeting was held in the presence of patient's family, CCU team and social worker.
Her HCT remained stable throughout this admission.
Patient continued to refuse head MRI during hospitalization, which made complete staging of her disease impossible.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane) - should wear spine brace while sitting up or ambulating.
