CEA on [**2179-9-27**] elevated to 29, at which time a CT revealed new large liver metastasis.
He denies IV drug use, blood transfusions, or hepatitis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.4 degrees, blood pressure 138/88, heart rate 79, respiratory rate of 20, and O2 saturation 97 percent on room air.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC DATA:  Admission white count 9.5 increased to 16.4 during this admission, hematocrit 44.2 decreased to 34.9 during this admission, platelets 265 with a decrease to 85 over his hospital stay.
Increasing creatinine to 1.3 following episode of hypotension.
Hepatitis B surface antigen positive, hepatitis B core antibody positive, hepatitis A virus antibody positive, hepatitis C virus antibody negative.
MRI of the spine: Metastatic involvement of T12 without pathologic compression or deformity.
Gallbladder ultrasound from [**2179-10-30**]:  No gallstones, no common bile duct dilation, portal vein patent.
CT of the head from [**2179-10-30**]:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or enhancing lesion.
Blood cultures from [**2179-10-30**] and [**2179-11-3**] are negative for growth.
Sputum culture from [**2179-10-31**] consistent with MSSA.
Urine culture from [**2179-10-30**] negative.
Stool culture from [**2179-10-30**] and [**2179-11-5**] negative for Clostridium difficile and other cultures.
GGT 130.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 60-year-old male with history of metastatic [**Month/Day/Year 499**] cancer to the liver presenting with acute worsening of chronic low back pain with evidence of metastatic spinal disease on admission MRI involving T12 and L1.
However, he continued to be poorly responsive and agitated with a drop in his blood pressure following intubation, thus suspicious for sepsis secondary to possible aspiration pneumonia in the setting of narcotic analgesia and the patient's supine position, all necessary for control of his back pain.
The patient was initially managed with vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl; and continued on cefepime to complete a total of 10 days of antibiotics following a sputum culture revealing MSSA.
His O2 saturations had returned to 97 percent on room air.
Sepsis:  Following hypercarbic respiratory failure and unresponsiveness, the patient was intubated, at which time his systolic pressures dropped into the 70s.
A central line was placed and he was continued on pressors for two days to maintain his blood pressure while on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
His sputum culture grew out MSSA.
His blood pressures recovered and his lactate decreased from its initial level of 8.
However, the patient suffered shock liver with elevation of his LFTs into the 1000s; acute renal failure with bump of the creatinine to 1.3, which has subsequently improved; in addition to cardiac-demand ischemia and mild DIC.
His blood cultures remain negative, stool cultures negative including Clostridium difficile times two.
