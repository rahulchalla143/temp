The patient denied having any other symptoms such as fever, chills, diaphoresis, chest pain; denied having other significant pulmonary symptoms.
On [**2137-11-22**], the patient presented to [**Hospital6 2121**], the place of her usual health care, and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed a "concerning lesion at the proximal esophagus."
Last echocardiogram done at [**Hospital6 1130**] showed "moderate aortic stenosis."
The patient's past medical history is also significant for osteoporosis, tinnitus and history of colonic polyps seen on colonoscopy in [**2129**].
The patient's work-up was not clear; however, she was discharged with Dilantin as part of her medication list.
The patient's pathology slides from her esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2137-11-22**] was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, invasive.
The slide was reviewed by the pathology staff at [**Hospital1 190**] which concurred with the diagnosis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
The patient underwent preoperative testing, including pulmonary function tests.
Temperature of 97.3.
Heart rate of 108; sinus tachycardia.
Blood pressure was 150/66.
respiratory rate of 16.
Saturating 97% on room air.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  Within normal limits at the time.
Respiratory examination:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, despite given history of chronic right sided pleural effusion.
Examination of the chest showed a well healed median sternotomy site with a small amount of scarring.
Abdominal examination was with bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, without evidence of hepatosplenomegaly.
The patient did not have any inguinal hernias and the rectal examination was negative for occult blood.
LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's preoperative laboratory studies showed a white count of 6.3; hemoglobin of 11.7; hematocrit of 36.2.
Platelet count of 298.
The patient's preoperative radiologic studies showed right sided chronic pleural effusion.
While in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, on postoperative day number zero, the patient was found to have CVP of 2; slight decrease from the baseline of 6 to 9, and decrease in the urine output, trailing from 100 cc per hour to 30 cc per hour.
The patient's blood pressure remained in the 90's systolically.
The patient was assessed to be volume depleted and was given lactated Ringers solution bolus with elevation in blood pressure to 100 systolic.
Urine output was at 35 cc per hour.
The intubation was confirmed with bilateral breath sounds and tidal C02 being positive.
Chest x-ray done showed no evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
The patient's respiratory status was followed with frequent physical examination and serial arterial blood gases.
Electrocardiogram done at the time also did not show any evidence of myocardial ischemia.
Fiberoptic examination was done.
Breath sounds were decreased bilaterally with expiratory wheezes and the patient's arterial blood gases worsened with base deficit of negative three from prior value of negative one.
Cardiac enzymes were being cycled at the time and as previously noted, came back negative with troponins less than 0.01.
The patient did rule out of myocardial infarction with four different troponin levels less than 0.01.
There was also a left anterior fascicular block that was noted on the previous electrocardiogram noted [**2137-12-12**].
At this time, her PC02 was found to be rising and the patient was reintubated for her safety with 7.0 endotracheal tube and was placed on ventilatory support.
The patient did well on SMV support and was put on C-Pap trial which she tolerated well on postoperative day number five, [**12-26**], with arterial blood gases of 7.41/42/145/28/+2.
The patient was put on increased oxygen with improvement in saturation; however, because the patient was breathing with much significant amount of work, the patient underwent a direct laryngoscopy which showed the same findings as prior with paramedian position of the left vocal cord and a subglottic edema that was visible.
On [**2137-12-30**], postoperative day number 10 and 1, the patient's right sided chest tube fell out accidentally; however, there were no respiratory complications resulting from that event and there was no pneumothorax seen on the chest x-ray.
Gastrointestinal:  On [**2137-12-20**], as part of her Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] procedure, the patient also received J tube placement and postoperatively, tube feeds were started without any problems.
Genitourinary:  The patient's urine output was monitored with Foley catheter and given her high right sided chest tube output, the patient's urine output was followed carefully and was replaced, as mentioned above, with intravenous fluids/TPN.
Hematology:  The patient was transfused one unit of PRBC on [**2137-12-24**], postoperative day number four, for decrease in hematocrit to 24.8.
The patient responded after transfusion to a hematocrit of 31.6.
The patient was transfused two units of PRBC on [**2138-1-7**] on postoperative day number 18/9/4, when her hematocrit acutely changed to 21 from 33.
It wasn't clear where the loss of the blood volume may have been.
The patient did have red blood cells that were noted coming out of the pleural fluid and there were concerns that the patient may be having hemolysis and DIC.
The patient's laboratory values were checked and there were no indications that the patient was having DIC or had been in septic shock.
The patient received two units of PRBC with appropriate rise in hematocrit to 34.
Based on these findings, the patient was started on heparin drip and was titrated to a PTT value between 50 to 60 and eventually, the patient stabilized to a heparin drip with a value between 500 to 600 units per hour.
Gram stain showed 3+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes and no micro organisms.
The culture did grow out Staphylococcus coagulase negative species and alphastreptococci; however, given that the patient did not have any rise in white blood cell count and did not show any evidence of infection on physical examination, these findings were credited to be contaminants.
However, the patient did have a rise in white count on [**1-1**], postoperative day number [**11-4**] with jump in white count from 9 to 15.
The patient was pan cultured and her urine was found to grow pan sensitive E. coli and enterococcus species.
The patient blood culture, also from the same day, showed Staph coagulase negative; however, this was considered a contaminant, given that the catheter tip was negative.
The pleural fluid was recultured on [**2138-1-2**], which showed pan sensitive enterococcus, staph coagulase negative species and bacterium species as well as a probable micrococcus species.
Also, by this time, the urine culture from [**1-1**], came back with E. coli and Enterococcus and the patient was started on intravenous Levaquin and intravenous Vancomycin.
Her white blood cell count continued to rise with peak value of 22.5 cells per cc and on discharge from Intensive Care Unit, was still at 16.8.
Repeat cultures done after [**1-2**] were negative for any micro organisms with negative blood cultures on [**1-3**], [**1-5**] and negative catheter tip culture on [**1-5**] as well.
The patient's urine was negative for microorganisms on [**1-5**] and despite negative cultures, the patient continued to have elevated white count of 16 on discharge from Intensive Care Unit.
With the patient having been stable for some time, without further respiratory issues after her tracheostomy, was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on [**2138-1-9**].
Chest x-ray was checked, which showed a right sided pleural effusion, which was not dramatically different from previous chest x-rays done in the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient's chest tube output had also cleared up with clear yellow color and quality and it was suspected that the patient's chylothorax was resolving despite relatively high output by the chest tube.
Because her levels had only increased mildly to 76 despite having been on tube feeds, she was slowly advanced.
The patient was cultured and was found to have a positive urine culture growing out yeast.
The gram stain initially showed 3+ gram negative rods; 1+ gram positive cocci in pairs and 1+ gram positive rods; however, the final culture only grew out sparse oropharyngeal flora.
Through these times, the patient was also noted to have increase in her white count to 21,000.
Repeat urine culture on [**1-15**] showed a 10 to 100,000 organisms per cc of yeast as well as sputum culture which showed rare growth of yeast.
However, preliminary fungal culture did not isolate any fungus.
Mycotic and fungal blood cultures were done on [**1-15**] and these cultures were no growth to date, on the day of expiration of the patient and were also no growth to date on day of dictation.
It should be noted that the patient's central venous line was changed on [**2138-1-14**], over a guide wire and the catheter tip was sent for culture; however.
On [**2138-1-15**], postoperative day number 27/17/12, the chest tube was discontinued by the thoracic surgery team.
The patient was found to have leakage of clear, serous, pleural fluid around the former chest tube site; however, the patient remained afebrile with vital signs stable with very mild tachycardia.
Also, there were questions as to a fluid collection seen next to the esophagus.
The patient was found to be breathing comfortably with oxygen saturation remaining over 97% on two liters nasal cannula.
The valve was removed by the nursing staff prior to sleep; tracheostomy mask was replaced on the patient with 35% oxygen, with saturations greater than 97%.
Her last recorded temperature was 95.6 degrees F at 9 p.m. and was noted to have oxygen saturation of 97%.
The last recorded blood pressure was 146/60 at 7 p.m. with heart rate of 99 and regular, and respiratory rate of 22, saturating 97%.
Last recorded finger stick was 141 at 9 p.m.
The patient was given an amp of Atropine and an amp of epinephrine with continued ventilation and chest compression.
Despite these efforts, the patient did not have any cardiac rhythm and the patient was pronounced dead at 3:58 a.m.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the attending surgeon, notified the family of the patient's death.
