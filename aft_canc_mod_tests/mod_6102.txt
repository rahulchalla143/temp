Due to his heavy smoking history, a chest xray was ordered and an abnormality detected therefore he was sent for a CT of the chest.
A bronchoscopy was then considered however due to his COPD this was not performed.
He underwent a flexible bronchoscopy today which revealed a near occlusion of the bronchus intermedius with an endobronchial mass.
Married and lives with his family   Family History: Mother- died of old age in late 80's Father- died of old age in late 80's Siblings- alive and well Offspring- 4 children all well   Physical Exam: VS: 99.0  HR: 80-90 SR  BP: 135/45  Sats: 97% RA General: no apparent distress HEENT: normocephalic, mucus membranes moist Neck: supple no lymphadenopathy Card: RRR Resp: decreased breath sounds GI: benign Extr: warm no edema Neuro: Awake, alert, oriented  Pertinent Results: [**2155-7-25**] WBC-18.0* RBC-4.02* Hgb-9.9* Hct-32.1* MCV-80* MCH-24.7* MCHC-31.0 RDW-15.4 Plt Ct-522* [**2155-7-24**] WBC-25.6* RBC-3.85* Hgb-9.9* Hct-30.6* MCV-80* MCH-25.8* MCHC-32.5 RDW-16.3* Plt Ct-566* [**2155-7-23**] WBC-23.3* RBC-4.42* Hgb-11.2* Hct-34.5* MCV-78* MCH-25.4* MCHC-32.5 RDW-16.5* Plt Ct-552* [**2155-7-23**] Neuts-88.8* Lymphs-7.8* Monos-3.2 Eos-0.1 Baso-0.1 [**2155-7-25**] Glucose-96 UreaN-11 Creat-1.2 Na-138 K-3.7 Cl-101 HCO3-27 [**2155-7-23**] Glucose-103 UreaN-17 Creat-0.9 Na-138 K-4.6 Cl-100 HCO3-28  CXR: [**2155-7-25**] The mass known to protrude into the right main bronchus can be seen on the chest radiograph.
CT staging is difficult to accurately assess due to the difficulty in assessing the tumor size, however, the most likely staging is a T2b, N2, Mx.
MRI Head: [**2155-7-23**] 1.
He had a chest CT & Head MRI.
He underwent flexible bronchosocpy which showed an endobronchial mass that was nearly obstructing the bronchus intermedius but that mass was bypassed with patent distal bronchus intermedius.
His oxygen was weaned with oxygen saturations in the high 90's on room air.
