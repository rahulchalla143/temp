The EBL, however, was 1,300 cc as the only complication.
Her hematocrit, however, initially was 29% intraoperatively.
At the time of discharge, her hematocrit had risen back to 24% on [**2119-3-28**] and at the time of discharge her last hematocrit on [**2119-3-29**] was 22.9%.

The Neurology Service recommended doing an MRI which was obtained on [**2119-3-27**].
The MRI was negative for compression; however, they thought that there was a femoral nerve palsy.
Her complete blood count remained stable at the highest level at 5.9 WBCs with a normal differential.
Her blood cultures were negative throughout her hospital course as well as two urine cultures which were negative.
They felt that given the fact that the CT angiogram demonstrated no focal consolidations for pneumonia, her blood and urine cultures all remained negative, that this fever was secondary to severe atelectasis versus a drug fever.
There were no other abnormalities and her electrolytes remained stable.
