Osteoporosis 3.
Osteoarthritis 4. s/p bilateral catarect surgery  Social History: Lives with his step-son who is his only child and his HCP, his name is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 36913**] and his cell phone number is: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 79899**].
Sensation: Grossly intact to light touch bilaterally.
Toes downgoing bilaterally  Upon discharge: Exam unchanged   Pertinent Results: MRI [**12-22**]: The study is partially limited by motion artifacts.
Result of video swallow evaluation [**12-27**]: RECOMMENDATIONS: 1.
However, if the pt and his HCP wish to allow him to eat against these recommendations given that the goals of care are now hospice related, I would suggest a diet of honey thick liquids and pureed solids, as these will result in the least amount of aspiration.
Speech/swallow did a video swallow evaluation and recommended a modified diet for comfort.
On [**12-29**] he was ready for discharge however his potassium was low.
