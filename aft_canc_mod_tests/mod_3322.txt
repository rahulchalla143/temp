An initial bronchoscopy was performed but biopsies have been nondiagnostic.
A f/u CT on [**2153-6-3**] revealed spread of the mass to the right lung.
He also developed pneumonia during this time and went into new-onset atrial flutter during another bronchoscopy which had to be aborted because of this event.
He underwent repeat bronchoscopy in [**Month (only) 205**] but obtained tissue only revealed necrosis per the patient.
The patient was eventually transferred to the VA [**Location (un) 669**] for CT-guided biopsy given these unsuccessful attempts to make a diagnosis.
His coumadin was held for the biopsy and he was kept on a heparin drip.
His rate remained difficult to be controlled despite several treatment attempts.
The CT-guided biopsy showed sarcoma versus melanoma.
Pertinent Results: AM Labs from [**2153-7-16**] at VA [**Location (un) 669**]: Na 140, K 4.8, BUN/Cr 22/0.8 WBC 17.7, Hct 29.1, Plt 163 PT 12.1, PTT 64.2, INR 1.0 .
CT on [**2153-7-15**] at VA [**Location (un) 669**]: SVC attenuated inferiorly.
TTE on [**2153-7-6**] at VA: EF 50%.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-7-21**] 7:20 PM: There has been no appreciable radiographic change.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-7-27**] 10:33 AM No change, given slight differences in technique, to the opacified right hemithorax reflective of effusion and right upper lobe collapse.
[**Numeric Identifier 73512**] EXTREM BILAT VENOGRAPHY  [**2153-7-19**] 8:54 AM Reason: stent placement in SVC Contrast: OPTIRAY PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent was obtained from the patient explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure.
The venogram demonstrated no antegrade opacification/flow through the SVC, with retrograde flow in the right IJ and collaterals.
Pull-back SVC-grams were performed delineating the anatomy and extent of the severe extrinsic SVC narrowing/encasement.
PTA of the stent was then performed with a 12 mm balloon.
A followup venogram demonstrated narrowing with persistent retrograde flow in the right brachiocephalic, above the stent.
FNA, Lung, Right Middle Lobe:   (Consult slides, [**Location 1268**] [**Hospital1 65180**] #: C07-4900):    POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Review of immunohistochemical studies   performed at [**Location 1268**] [**Hospital1 65180**] shows positive staining of the tumor   cells with vimentin and CD68 and negative staining with desmin, actin,   smooth muscle actin, S-100, HMB-45, pankeratin and CD34.
Brahma at the [**Hospital1 65180**], additional stains show positive    staining with p53 and CD10, and negative staining with CD30 and TTF-1.
Further immunohistochemical studies were performed at [**Hospital 61**]   ([**Hospital1 18**]) showing negative staining of the tumor cells with p63 and MNF116   and few scattered cells showing positive staining with CK903, favored to   be normal epithelial cells within the tumor.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 57 yo old male from [**State 1727**] with CAD s/p MI x2 ([**2135**], [**2143**]), ?COPD (on 2L home O2, 3ppd smoking for years), atrial flutter on coumadin, found to have new lung mass with recent onset of SVC syndrome, s/p bx at VA [**Location (un) 669**], transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for airway protection prior to initiation of XRT, now s/p bronch and y-stent placement by IP and SVC stent by IR.
EKG had questionable TWI in v4-6 but CE's were negative, making MI unlikely.
# Rhythm: The patient had treatment-refractory atrial flutter since his second bronchoscopy in the VA at [**State 1727**].
He was kept on PO metoprolol and diltiazem for symptom relief, with the understanding that no IV lopressor would be given for heart rate control and no pressors would be given for hypotension.
# Lung mass: Pathology on CT-guided bx at VA [**Location (un) 669**] is spindle cell carcinoma, consistent with sarcoma.
# CAD: The patient is status post MI x2 with [**Month/Year (2) 73511**] each time.
# Anemia: Hct baseline seems to be around 28 -32 given recent values from VA. HCT was stable at 25-26.
# Post-obstructive PNA: found on CT at VA. Also 1% bands on admission at [**Hospital1 18**].
