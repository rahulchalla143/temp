In setting of recent ICH, CT head was pursued and revealed no structural abnormality or bleed.
Urine tox screen was negative.
# HYPOTENSION:  Patient presented with BP 80/40s from rehab, also of unclear etiology though it was fluid-responsive in the ED to 2LNS to sbb>100.
Urosepsis is possible given his concerning UA and leukocytosis- no other infectious sources seen in the lung, however abdominal CT makes note of a soft tissue density c/w neoplasm versus diverticulitis.
Will narrow his antibiotic spectrum to ciprofloxacin based on his previous sensitivities.
Blood and urine cultures need to be followed.
# ABDOMINAL SOFT TISSUE DENSITY: Seen on CT abdomen, of unclear etiology: neoplasm versus possible small bowel diverticulitis.
Will need repeat CT in three weeks  # RECENT INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE:  He recently underwent hemorrhagic stroke possibly from converted ischemic stroke versus amyloid process.
His neurologic exam is considerably improved compared to his discharge exam.
Appears dry on exam .
Pt admitted [**4-25**] with hypotension and responsive to 2L NS with SBP in low 100's.
NCHCT showed no acute process (final read.)
Given h/o ICH there was concern for an acute intracranial process, but neg CT.   Pt now at baseline mental status and wbc 10.5 from 15.9.
There are blood cultures still pending that your doctor will need to follow up the results off.
We believe that the infection in your urine spread to your blood stream causing your low blood pressure and altered mental status.
If your blood pressure is found to be low at your long term care facility.
On your CT scan there was a mass noted in the abdomen.
You will need a follow up CT in three weeks to further evaluate.
Followup Instructions: Please be seen by your doctor in two day for a repeat evaluation of your urine.
You will need your blood pressure monitored until then at your long term care facility.
