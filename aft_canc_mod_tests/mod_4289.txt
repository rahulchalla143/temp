A pelvic ultrasound also revealed a left adnexal cyst (8.8cm) and uterine fibroids.
Patient's CA-125 was 30.9.
However during the initial admission, the patient was noted to be severely jaundiced, leading to an evaluation for liver failure.
The TAH was therefore placed on hold and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and w/u of her liver disease.
Her totabl bilirubin was found to be 15.3 with direct 9.5.
ALT 478 and AST 1007, Alk phos 138 and GGT 47.
She underwent an abd U/S which did not show any stones or ductal dilatation.
CT abd/pelvis showed a normal liver.
Uterine fibroids 3.
Left adnexal cyst seen on pelvic US and pelvic CT from OSH 4.

STUDIES FROM [**Hospital1 18**]: CXR [**2119-1-18**]: 1.
A single hyperechoic lesion is identified within the liver parenchyma which should be evaluated by multidetector CT and multiphasic CT.
Multidetector CT recommended.
TTE [**2119-1-19**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
CXR [**2119-1-25**]: FINDINGS: A nasogastric tube is in place with tip terminating in the upper gastric fundus just distal to the gastroesophageal junction.
CXR [**2119-1-26**]: FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube with tip 4.5 cm from carina.
Trichrome stain shows increase in portal fibrosis.
HBV and HCV virus PCR was checked and found to be negative.
Other viral serologies were also negative for acute infection (CMV and EBV IgM neg but IgG positive indicating previous exposure but no acute infection).
Her iron studies were not consistent with hemochromotosis and her ceruloplasmin were wnl.
However her Serum immunoglobulin G levels were elevated at 3339 and her Anti-smooth muscle antibody was positive 1:320 as was the [**Doctor First Name **] 1:1280.
A transjugular biopsy was performed on [**2119-1-20**] which demonstrated severe portal/periportal and lobular mixed inflammation including neutrophils, plasma cells and eosinophils.
Elevated creatinine: The pt was admitted with a creatinine of 1.6.
An IVF challenge was given without much success.
Urine lytes were consitent with a Na avid state suggesting possible Hepato-Renal Syndrome.
Renal U/S and CT from OSH successfully ruled out hydronephrosis and possible post renal obstruction.
ID: The WBC count was elevated from 7 on [**1-21**] at OSH to 20s during her admission at [**Hospital1 18**].
Levofloxcain was chosen for broad spectrum pulmonary source as she had some cough and an episode of hematemesis on [**2119-1-18**] with CXR findings of ?atelectasis.
Anemia: Although the pt had a stable HCT during this admission, iron studies (originally sent for evaluation of hemochromotosis) were consistent with Fe def anemia.
