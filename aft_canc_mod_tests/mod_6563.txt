A head CT was done that revealed possible brain edema vs acute infarct.
Serum Na is 122.
After communicating the findings with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] (Neuro/Onc) he recommended dexamethasone 10mg PO, Keppra 500mg once, increasing dexamethasone to 4mg q6H, EEG and an MRI.

An MRI could be helpful for further evaluation.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
However, given known brain metastases with CT changes concerning for worsening edema as well as NSCLC, SIADH could also be contributing to hyponatremia but given response to fluids less likely  #Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hyponatremia vs herpes/malignant encephalitis given MRI and EEG changes.
MRI did not show new mets, but did show abnormal signal in right temporal lobe, as well as EEG showing abnormal activity in that region so pt started on keppra.
LP showed 34 WBCs and gram stain showed 1+PMNs.
CSF positive for HSV encephalitis.
Discussion with the family indicated that her wishes were to be DNR/DNI, but we wanted to be able to monitor her respiratory status closely while beginning new AEDs.
Cardiology curbsided who recommended echo which showed no change from prior.
?s were negative x3  # UTI: Patient presented with complicated UTI for which she had taken 4 of 6 doses of ciprofloxacin.
Will tx for total 7 day course for complicated UTI   # Stage IV NSCLC: C/b metastases to brain and right ilium, s/p XRT.
