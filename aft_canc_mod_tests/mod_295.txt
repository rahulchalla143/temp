Head CT ([**2-9**]): 1.
CT abd/pelvis ([**2-9**]): 1.
CTA ([**2-15**]): 1.
Three-month chest CT followup is recommended after diuresis to distinguish nodular atelectasis from a true lung nodule.
CXR ([**2-19**]): There is dense retrocardiac opacity with moderate left effusion and patchy alveolar infiltrates in the right lower lung and left mid lung.
# Acute renal failure: Patient presented to the ED with many symptoms consistent with uremia, and renal US showed b/l hydronephrosis consistent with post-renal obstruction.
On HD #2, he became oliguric and hyperkalemic, and CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast demonstrated retroperitoneal LA and metastatic retroperitoneal fibrosis.
His Cr decreased to 1.1 by the time of discharge.
Further BCx and UCx were without growth.
Anticoagulation was deferred given the prcedures necessary to relieve his renal obstruction and also a previous history of difficult to control INR when on coumadin in the past.
# Hospital-acquired PNA: The patient developed low-grade fever for which a CXR demonstrated a left lower lobe pneumonia on [**2-19**].
He was placed on 15L O2 via face mask, CXR demonstrated some perihilar fullness as well as small L pleural effusion, and EKG demonstrated no acute changes.
He was given Lasix, Nitro, and ASA, and cardiac enzymes were sent, which were unremarkable.
# Anemia: Patient with a Hct of 23.9 on admission, baseline Hct ranges 26-30, likely due to decreased production given metastatic prostate cancer.
MCV 93.
Coags remained essentially normal throughout course of admission, and Hct remained stable at 23-24 following initial transfusion.
Following PCN tube placement, Hct dropped to 21.6, for which 2 units PRBCs were given.
Following transfusion, Hct was stable around 23-28.
# Electrolyte abnormalities:  Patient with an AG of 16 at admission.
# Altered mental status:  Patient was very sleepy and somewhat confused during hospitalization, likely due to combination of factors: uremia, hyponatremia, hypoglycemic episodes, and increased serum concentrations of home benzos and pain meds given compromised renal function.
Head CT demonstrated no evidence of hemorrhage or large mass, but did indicate small hypodensity at Sylvian fissure, and met could not be completely ruled out.
As uremia, electrolyte disturbances, and hypoglycemic episodes resolved, patient's mental status improved.
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure (non-ischemic): Patient with an EF of 45% on his last TTE and a BNP on admission of > 70,000.
Blood sugar was monitored with qid fingersticks.
Piperacillin-Tazobactam-Dextrs 4.5 gram/100 mL Piggyback Sig: One (1)  Intravenous Q8H (every 8 hours) for 10 days: Last day is [**3-3**].
Also while you were in the hospital, you were noted to have a deep venous thrombosis, or blood clot, in a vein in your left calf.
Finally, you were found to have a rapid heart rate occasionally, known as tachycardia, for which the doses on some of your home medications were adjusted.
Finally, you were found on chest x-ray to have pneumonia in your left lung, for which we are treating you with two antibiotics given IV through your PICC line.

You will need a ride home.
