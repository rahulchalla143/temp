Blood cultures were negative.
[**2168-4-14**] a portable abdominal film was taken which showed multiple distended air-filled loops of large and small bowel likely representing an ileus.
During this operative case an examination under anesthesia and flexible sigmoidoscopy, contrast study per rectum done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], reopen laparotomy and drainage of pelvis, and Diverting loop ileostomy were all preformed.A 19-French [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was placed securely in the presacral space and stitched to the level of skin to drain the presacral abscess.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended transthoracic echocardiogram which showed no abnormality.
The ostomy site output was large and the patient was started on Imodium therapy which was effective.
This was attributed the size of the drain and the patient was taken for CT guided upsizing of the drain to a 10 french flexima catheter.
