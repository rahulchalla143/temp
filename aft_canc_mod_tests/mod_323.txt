Pneumoperitoneum/non-draining pleurex: Found to have locules of gas within ascites on abdominal CT scan, which was initially felt to be due to catheter placement rather than perforation given her benign abdominal exam.
A small amount of ascitic fluid was sampled and showed 825 WBCs (65% polys), cultures were sent, and she was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for presumed bacterial peritonitis.
IR re-examined the CT abdomen, and felt that the pleurex catheter looked like it had been placed through her colon.
Therefore, they said, that a functional study of it is not worth while.
