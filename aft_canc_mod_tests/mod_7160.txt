An incision was made, but at that time the patient became unresponsive with bradycardia into the 30s and hypotension with SBPs in the 60s.
She was withdrawing to painful stimuli and moving all extremities.
At the time of this incident, an EKG was performed that showed atrial fibrillation and ST depressions (reportedly in V2-V3).
Repeat EKG 30 minutes later showed normalization of these abnormalities.
On the floor, the patient is responsive to painful stimuli only.
NSCLC as below: -[**10-7**] CXR for cough showed R-sided opacity, chest CT which showed a nodular lesions in superior RLL and mod/large R pleural  effusion - [**2118-11-2**] pleural effusion tapped and negative for malignancy Pt then developed hoarseness and was seen by ENT [**1-8**] and determined to have recurrent nerve paralysis, highly concerning for malignancy.
- [**2119-1-13**] repeat imaging disclosed a smaller LUL nodule and paratracheal mass, likely a lymph node conglomerage - [**2119-1-26**] EBUS with FNA sampled paratracheal mass and lymph node, both positive for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 95.6 (axillary) BP:97/62 P: 62 R: 20 O2: 99% 2 L General: Withdraws to painful stimuli only, no posturing.
Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, limited air movement at apices only (decreased breath sounds bilateral bases) CV: irregularly irregular normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: withdraws all extremities to painful stimuli only, 1+ LE reflexes, toes downgoing bilaterally.

CXR (portable): [**2119-4-6**] CHEST, AP: Lung volumes are low, with increased left lower lobe atelectasis and a tiny left apical pneumothorax.
CT Head w/o Contrast [**2119-4-6**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Areas of hypodensity within the right parietal and right frontal regions corresponding to FLAIR abnormalities on prior MRI and consistent with remote infarcts.
MRI Head [**2119-4-7**]: No acute pathology (prelim) .
CXR [**2119-4-7**] (post Pleurex): No evidence of residual pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: # Altered Mental Status: The patient's unresponsiveness/altered mental status was possibly due to versed/fentanyl with slow metabolism, but also possibly due to hypoxia and resultant CNS insult that occurred as a result of her hypoperfusion with low HR and blood pressure.
Alternative explanations include CVA and other toxic/metabolic abnormalities.
Glucose level was normal.
Patient also with long history of atrial fibrillation, not currently on anticoagulation with an INR of 1.2.
Her airway was monitored closely and she had a repeat ABG that showed 7.4/65/127.
An MRI of her brain was performed due to concern for embolic CVA which showed no acute pathology.
# Hypotension: When the patient first arrived to the ICU, her blood pressures were in the high 90s and low 100s systolic.
Over the subsequent several hours, her blood pressures drifted down to a nadir of 70s systolic.
She showed improvement in her blood pressure to 90s-100s.
A central line set up was at bed side in case pressors were needed, but her blood pressure remained stable and then increased to 120s systolic when she became fully awake.
A repeat EKG 30 minutes later showed resolution of these findings and only showed atrial fibrillation with no ST/T wave abnormalities.
As a result cardiac enzymes were cycled.
A second set did show a small increase in troponin T to 0.02, but no MB component.
Third set of enzymes was negative.
F/U chest x-ray showed no PTX.
Pt's heart rate was stable prior to discharge.
# Hypothyroidism: A TSH was sent and was elevated at 7.8, however, a free T4 was normal at 1.6.
