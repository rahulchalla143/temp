she was found to have a K of 6.2 and a Ca of 13.3.
For her hyperkalemia she was given 10 units insulin with 1 amp D50, 1 amp calcium gluconate, 30mg kayecelate.
For her neurological symptoms, she was given 10 mg decadron and head CT, and thoracolumbar MRI were performed to rule out CNS involvement and cord compression respectively.
FLOOR COURSE: Ms. [**Known lastname **] arrived to the floor with a K of 6.2 and a Ca of 11.5.
Given the incontinence and thoracic pain, she had a neurologic work up for ?cord compression, and subsequently an c, t, l spine MRI which was notable for metastatic disease diffusely and evidence of epidural disease at the L5 vertebral body level, but no compression.
She had a progressive O2 requirement with tachypnea and on the morning of transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] was satting 93% on 5L by nasal cannula.
An ultrasound noted renal cysts leading to a biopsy of the right kidney, which was reported as normal.
One year prior, her daughter had been diagnosed with a brain tumor, which was likely a hemangioma, and through testing was found to have [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 21344**]-Lindau disease.
Left radical nephrectomy on [**2121-6-2**] revealed a polycystic kidney  with five clear cell type renal cell carcinomas ranging in size from 0.6 cm to 9 cm.
Her TNM stage was T2 Nx Mx.
MRI in [**3-/2124**] was notable for polycystic kidney disease in the right kidney and gradually increasing size of a lesion in the caudate lobe of the liver.
Biopsy of this liver lesion on [**2124-6-29**] revealed metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
MRI on [**2125-4-11**] showed growth of the liver lesion to 6 cm.

BLOOD CULTURES X8-NGTD STOOL: C-DIFF X2-Negative VRE-Swab: negative .
Chest xray: - [**2125-8-16**]: Essentially unchanged chest radiograph with left atelectasis and pleural effusion.
- [**2125-8-15**]: AP chest compared to [**8-13**] through 17: Mild pulmonary edema is new.
CT HEAD: - [**2125-8-16**]: There is no significant interval change compared to prior examination from [**2125-8-8**].
However, due to motion artifact, the study is limited and a subtle lesion cannot be entirely excluded.
MRI of the brain is recommended for further characterization.
CT ABDOMEN & PELVIS: - [**2125-8-16**]: 1.
Somewhat limited examination due to the lack of IV contrast however no evidence for abscess.
Effusion echo dense, c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
She was not diuresed due to pancreatitis, her narcotic regimen was initially held to help improve her mental status, which did not clear.
Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine unknown admitted with Cr 2.1, likely compromised by L nephrectomy thus single kidney with polycystic kidney disease in the setting of VHL, >5cm RCC mass in R kidney.
Infection/inflammation w/increasing WBC and left shift - Had low grade fevers, however on steroids, at first stress dose then slowly titrated to down, however due to elevated WBC she was remained on stress dose levels.
Abd CT showed large peripancreatic phelgmon with increased fat stranding likely resulting in considerable intra-abdominal inflammation.
likely from decreased nutritional status and antibiotics - INR improved from max 2.9 ->to 1.5 [**8-16**] after vitamin K x1.
- Although admitted with elevated amylase, lipase, LDH & alk phos,ALT & AST remained nml.
Her T bili trended up to 4.4 on [**8-17**].
An U/S was done c/w biliary sludge, however no cholelithiasis.
EF >75%, mild diastolic dysfunction.
During her course she became tachycardic HR 150s most likely MAT.
Metastatic RCC: CT scans negative for cord compression, however, 10cm liver metastasis, abundant evidence of probable VHL hemangiomas in the cervical, lumbar and thoracic spine.
She underwent 2 head CTs which did not show an acute process, however due to movement, and a limited study, a subtle lesion could not be entirely excluded.
Per pt's request her organs were donated to NDRI in coordination with our pathology department.
