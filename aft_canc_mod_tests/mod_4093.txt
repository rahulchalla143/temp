In the Emergency Department, she was found to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure to the 70s.
She was febrile - I believe - to 101.6 in the Emergency Department.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient's temperature was 101.6, her heart rate was 74 (in a normal sinus rhythm), and her blood pressure was 83/44.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Urinalysis performed in the Emergency Department was positive for leukocyte esterase as well as nitrites.
The patient had an arterial line placed and was seen by the Critical Care staff - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] - who agreed with aggressive hydration and pressors to support her blood pressure.
The patient was also transfused to a hematocrit of 30.
She came in with a hematocrit of 23.
The levofloxacin was switched to ciprofloxacin while we were waiting for the final cultures because of the interaction with sotalol which she had been placed on during her previous admission for atrial fibrillation and a combination of prolongation of the Q-T interval less likely to occur with the combination of ciprofloxacin than it was with levofloxacin.
The patient subsequently had gram-negative rods in her blood as well as in her urine, and this has turned out to all be the same bacteria which was a resistant Escherichia coli sensitive to meropenem - which she was ultimately placed on.
A Hematology/Oncology consultation was also obtained due to a significantly elevated white blood cell count.
They did recommend, however, that we could obtain a CT urogram to evaluate for any source of a mechanical cause of infection.
A computed tomography was obtained a couple days later, and this did show air in the bladder which was felt by the radiologist to be either as a result of a recent Foley catheterization or bacteria.
The sotalol was discontinued for a couple of days but was ultimately resumed as her heart rate and blood pressure improved.
She remained in a normal sinus rhythm with a pulse of 60.
Her temperature was 98.4, her respiratory rate was 18, her blood pressure was 112/66, and her oxygen saturation was 98 percent on room air.
Her weight today was 69 kilograms.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Most recent laboratory values included a white blood cell count of [**Numeric Identifier 20597**], hematocrit was 32, and her platelets were 251.
Sodium was 140, potassium was 3.9, chloride was 106, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 20, creatinine was 0.4, and blood glucose was 77.
Her INR was 2.1.
Coumadin 2 mg by mouth once per day (this is to be    followed with INR checks at least twice per week and    titrated accordingly for a target INR of 2 to 2.5).
