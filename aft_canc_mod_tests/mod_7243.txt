A CXR showed a new lower lobe infilitrate and small effusion on right.
The Pt dropped his pressure soon after the procedure and was given 1L of LR and placed on norepinephrine.
An ABG taken at that time was 7.14/73/187.
Labs were as follows: WBC=12.8, Hct=30.6, Plts=248, PTT=43.8, INR=1.4, Na=140, K=4.8, Cl-104, CO2=23, BUN=27, Cr=1.2, GLUC=292, MG=2.0, Ca=8.9, lactate=6.7, albumin=2.8, troponin=0.02.
This resulted in transient increase in BP, but it then dropped markedly to SBPs=40s and epinephrine 1 mg had to be pushed and an epinephrine gtt was started.
The Pts BP responded well to the epinephrine, but continual epinephrine boluses had to be administered to maintain MAPs = 60s.
A swan was floated and showed his PAP and wedge pressure to be wnl.
A follow-up Hct was 23, thus 2 units of PRBCs were given and Hct bumped to 29.
A follow-up CXR showed the evolution of a large left sided pleural effusion.

Further workup may be obtained by ultrasound if clinically indicated.
[**2127-12-22**] CXR Lung volumes are lower.
The last chest tube was removed on the day of discharge.
On hospital day 3 his sputum grew out MRSA and he was treated with vancomycin for a 7 day course.
Since the meropenem was started his sputum samples have been contaminated so no new data is available.
A bronch was performed the day after trach and was noted to collapse when patient was placed on 0/0 vent support.
He will need further weaning at rehab.
He had serial blood and urine cultures, all of which were negative.
Beta-blocker titrated and has had stable HR and BP over last week.
Goal PTT 50-70, goal INR [**3-6**].
Underwent RF ablation given he was a poor surgical candidate.
Right [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 91691**] Pt found tohave right basilic-axillary clot on ultrasound.
Started on heparin with goal PTT 50-70.

Will need to stop heparin 2 days after INR is therapeutic.
