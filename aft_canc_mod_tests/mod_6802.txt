L Spine IMPRESSION: 1.
A Head CT with contrast demonstrated improvement of his vasogenic edema and abdominal CT demonstated a stable AAA.
CT scan of the chest on the evening of admission demonstrated new severe alveolitis or other alveolar filling process primarily involving the upper lobes, but also with patchy involement in other lung fields.
Sputum was negative for PCP x 2.
However, B-glucan was grossly elevated to >500, galactomannam was elevated at 0.5, and LDH was elevated up to 754, suspicion was high for PCP pneumonia and patient was started on bactrim DS and steroids.
Hyponatremia: His serum sodium dropped as low as 125 but pt remained asymptomatic.
However, his anemia recurred mostly likley from myelosuppression due to high dose bactrim and he required 2 units PRBCs on [**2110-11-30**] and [**2110-12-1**].
Iron studies, B12 and folate did not show deficiencies and work up did not support hemolysis.On d/c plts are trending down and levels need to be followed closely as an outpt.
Non contrast head CT showed no worsening of his brain mets.
A CT spine (patient's pace maker is NOT compatible with MRI) showed no mets in the spinal cord but did reveal cord impingement due to DJD at T6.
The patient was seen in consultation with neuro oncology who felt that this radiologic finding was not causing clinical symptoms, had been documented on prior studies and was stable.
TSH and  CPK levels were wnl.Symptoms did improve spontaneously and likely cause is deconditioning due to prolonged hospital stay including ICU admission.
Hepatitis serologies pending on d/c.
Stage III NSCLC / brain mets: Repeat Head CT with contrast showing no new lesions, edema decreased.
Your strength has been improving and tests did not reveal a cause for weakness.You liver function tests have been elevated so your statin has been stopped and your anti seizure medication has been changed.Your potassium has been high probably from the bactrim antibiotic you need for your pneumonia.
This has been treated with a water pill (toresamide), IV fluids, and decreasing your carvedilol blood pressure medication.You have received 2 blood transfusions for anemia with good response.
pending results: hepatitis serologies  Followup Instructions: F/U blood pressure-carvedilol may need to be titrated up.
