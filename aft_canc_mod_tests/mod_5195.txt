He was taken to the ED where Head CT was performed and was negative, Neuro exam was at baseline (R hemiparesis, but awake and alert).
His initial neurologic exam is documented as awake and alert, oriented to place and person, following commands,  with R hemiparesis.
On repeat exam he was more drowsy, so Head CT was ordered, and showed a large L sided ICH with interventricular extension and subfalcine shift.
His mental status continued to deteriorate, and on repeat exam his was arousable to sternal rub only.
Neurosurgery was consulted emergently and Head CT was repeated (see read below) and showed a 7 cm x 6.5 cm hemorrhage with extension to the lateral, 3rd, and 4th ventricles.

Extension of blood is seen into the lateral ventricles, third ventricle, and a small amount in the fourth ventricle.
On initial exam he was arousable to sternal rub but did not follow commands, had a R hemiparesis with some posturing to pain, and reactive pupils.
Patient was admitted to the Neuro-ICU where his blood pressure was controlled, neuro checks were performed every hour, he was kept euthermic and euglycemic, his head was elevated and all blood thinning products were held.
A repeat head CT the following morning showed no new bleeding.
CTA of head did not show extravasation of contrast but couldnot exclude bleeding from clipped aneurysm site.
Repeat head CT was unchanged without any new bleeding involving the right hemisphere to explain the new left-sided weakness.
A subsequent spine CT revealed possible metastatic lesion within the superior facet of the right side of C3.
A bone scan was inconclusive.
