Old right posterior rib fractures and anterior wedge compression of L2 and multilevel lumbar degenerative disease.
EGD [**2121-3-27**]: Impression: Small hiatal hernia Mild erythema and friability in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: The findings do not account for the symptoms Serial hcts, monitor stool output; consider extraluminal blood losses given recent femoral puncture.
Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.
Hyperinflation of the upper lungs most likely reflects emphysema.
Colonoscopy [**2121-3-31**]: Polyp in the proximal ascending colon (polypectomy) Polyp in the distal ascending colon (polypectomy) Polyp in the hepatic flexure (polypectomy, endoclip) Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum   Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 78-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, Mallroy [**Doctor Last Name **] tear, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes who presents with confusion, weakness and hypotension, susequently found to a large hematocrit drop.
His hematocrit responded by improving from 18 to 23.
GI performed an endoscopy which showed gastric erythema and friability, but no obvious source of GI bleed.
CT of abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of RP bleed.
His hematocrit remained stable and steadily increasing, so he was transferred to the Medicine service with plans to perform colonoscopy after appropriate preparation.
His aspirin and [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] were held.
Colonoscopy showed 3 polyps but no active bleeding.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable and he had no more bloody stools.
Discharged with plans for close outpatient follow-up and repeat hematocrit on [**2121-4-3**].
Urine culture showed mixed bacteria growth, without evidence of UTI.
Ceftriaxone was stopped and a repeat Ucx was unremarkable.
Anterior wedge compression of L2 .
Transitional Issues: - Repeat hematocrit on [**4-3**].
Hematocrit on dischare was 30.2.
You had a scope of your upper and and lower intestinal tract which showed polyps but no active bleeding.
You did not have any further episodes of bleeding and your blood counts improved during your time in the hospital.
You should have your blood counts rechecked on Friday [**2121-4-4**] and the results faxed to your primary doctor.
