Despite the large thrombus burden, no CT evidence of right heart strain is seen.

Analysis is performed in comparison with the next preceding AP single view chest examination of [**2183-6-29**].
[**7-2**]: CT Chest with contrast: 1.
[**7-4**] CXR: A right loculated effusion along the chest wall is slightly smaller compared to the prior examination with evidence of aerated lung behind it.

==================================================== ACTIVE ISSUES ==================================================== # Pulmonary embolus: Pt found to have a large R-sided pulmonary embolus while on lovenox for home anticoagulation, suggesting failure of the Lovenox therapy.
He had been transferred to the floor, but due to worsening hypoxia was sent back to the ICU, where interventional pulmonology changed his chest tube.
Since his effusion had significant loculations, he was given doses of tPA via chest tube to break up the loculations and thereby allow more drainage.
Sputum cultures grew Staph aureus, which was sensitive to gent; blood cultures had no growth, pleural fluid preliminarily had no growth.
He was given tPA with hopes of lysing some clots He maintained O2 saturation >90% on 2L NC at time of ICU discharge.
Cytology of the pleural fluid showed no malignant cells.
# Anemia: Hct 19 on admission, decreased from recent baseline 25.
No evidence of active bleeding on exam but hemorrhage into a R pulmonary infarct or cavitary pneumonia was considered.
Hematocrit improved to 25 with transfusion of 2 units PRBCs and was stable thereafter.
Hematocrit remained stable while on floor in the mid-20s.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been secondary dehydration or to transient decrease in cardiac output from pulmonary embolus.
