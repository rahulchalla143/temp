PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate 50, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 133/80, respiratory rate 20, and O2 saturation is 99% on room air.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 6.2, hematocrit 35.3, platelets 131, sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 107, CO2 21, BUN 19, creatinine 0.9, and glucose 101.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] where he underwent cardiac catheterization.
In summary, the catheterization showed an ejection fraction of 55%, normal left main, left anterior descending artery with a mid segment total occlusion, distal filling from right to left collaterals, circumflex 60-70% tubular lesion with 99% distal OM-2 lesion, right coronary artery total occlusion except mid segment.
CT Surgery was consulted, and the patient was seen.
In summary, the patient had an off-pump CABG x4 with LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein graft to the LPL, saphenous vein graft to the PDA, and saphenous vein graft to the OM.
Additionally, the patient went for STAT head CT scan which showed no acute bleed.
At that point, he went for a CTA of the brain, which showed no intracranial hemorrhage, normal CT scan.
Circle of [**Location (un) 431**], anterior cerebral, posterior cerebral, and mid cerebral arteries all appeared normal.
Over the next two days, the patient was weaned from all cardioactive IV medications, and on postoperative day five, the patient was brought for a MRI which showed no acute vascular territorial infarction, a large intracellular, supracellular mass with a small focus of susceptibility of infarct consistent with hemorrhage and unchanged air fluid levels in the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.
At time of discharge, the patient's physical examination is as follows: vital signs:  Temperature 97.7, heart rate 72 sinus, blood pressure 120/80, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation is 93% on room air.
Respiratory is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY VALUES:  White count 10.1, hematocrit 39.6, platelets 219.
Sodium 135, potassium 3.8, chloride 102, CO2 23, BUN 18, creatinine 1.0, glucose 74.
