His blood glucose was 91 and BP was 168/98.
He was brought to [**Hospital **] Hospital where his initial BP was 151/72 and his HR was 57.
He was not coagulopathic, with an INR of 0.95, PTT of 29.9, and platelets of 322.
He had a head CT which revealed a small (about 3 x 2.5 cm) hemorrhage in the left external capsule, with no midline shift and no intraventricular blood.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.
Upon arrival here his blood pressure was elevated at 188/77 and he was given hydralazine.
He was taken for head CT, and per recommendation of Neurosurgery, CTA (presumably to look for dissection, although per his wife he gets no neck manipulation).
No complaints of headache, diplopia, dysarthria, tinnitus, vertigo, dysphagia, weakness, numbness, or paresthesias prior to this event.
Physical Exam: (initially examined while lying flat awaiting CT, then later seen while sitting up, when much more awake) T  Afebrile   HR 54  BP 140/63   RR 18  Pulse Ox 98% on 2L NC General appearance:  Sleepy 85 year old man in NAD HEENT:  NC/AT, neck supple CV: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Optic disc margins could not be visualized.
Motor System: Exam somewhat limited due to global aphasia and initially, somnolence.
Reflexes: Deep tendon reflexes are trace on the left, absent on the right.
Pertinent Results: At [**Hospital **] Hospital: 2.5>11.1/33.2<322 PT 11.6 INR 0.95  PTT 29.9  UA: SG 1011, negative  129  96  21  100    AGap=17 4.5  21  1.0 Comments: K: Hemolysis Falsely Elevates K  estGFR: 71 / >75 (click for details)  MCV 92 3.3 > 11.4 < 322       32.5  N:62.6 L:22.9 M:11.5 E:2.9 Bas:0.2  PT: 13.1  PTT: 27.2  INR: 1.1  Imaging: CXR: negative for CHF or PNA  Head CT/CTA [**1-9**]: FINDINGS: There is a large 4.1 x 7.8 cm intraparenchymal hematoma in the left basal ganglia,frontal and temporal lobes with intraventricular extension.
Evaluation of the CTA of the brain demonstrates no aneurysm or hemodynamically significant stenosis.
Evaluation of the CTA of the neck demonstrates calcified atheromatous plaquing at the origin of the right distal common carotid artery and bulb extending to the proximal ICA.
EKG: Sinus bradycardia First degree A-V delay Consider left atrial abnormality although baseline artifact makes assessment difficult No previous tracing available for comparison   Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 54 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 72541**] 31 54   Head CT [**1-10**]: FINDINGS: Again seen is a large evolving 7.4 x 3.8 cm left intraparenchymal hematoma centered in the left basal ganglia.
The etiology of the hemorrhage was most likely hypertensive, although the location was a bit unusual (would expect basal ganglia or thalamus), but another spike in his blood pressure may have been responsible for the expansion of the bleed.
[**Name (NI) **] had expressed to his family quite clearly that he did not wish to be kept alive on a long-term basis by artificial means, did not want any heroic measures, and would not want to live with major disability.
Neuro: Patient was admitted to Neurology ICU where serial neurochecks were performed.
Mannitol 50g IV was given initially in the ED and then continued 25mg every 6 hours thereafter with parameters to hold subsequent doses for Na >150 or Osm >320.
He was loaded with 1g Dilantin which was subsequently discontinued upon re-evaluation in the am since his bleed was subcortical and risk of seizure was low.
Repeat head CT the following morning showed an evolving left intraparenchymal hematoma centered at the left basal ganglia with surrounding edema resulting in a 9-mm of rightward subfalcine herniation and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
EKG notable for first degree AV block and sinus bradycardia without priors for comparison.
His serum sodium downtrended to 127 and he was fluid restrict and treated with hypertonic 3% saline at a slow rate with good result.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Concentrate Sig: 0.5-2 mg PO Q1H (every hour) as needed for agitation.
