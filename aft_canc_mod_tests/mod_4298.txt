CT CHEST [**5-13**]: Limited evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma due to image acquisition during the expiratory phase of respiration.
Head CT [**5-15**]: Expected post-op changes.
MRI Brain [**5-16**]: There is increased DWI signal surrounding the resection cavity.
A chest CT was obtained, which revealed no pulmonary lesions or other areas of tumor.
MR head showed large extra-axial mass lesion at the right occipital region, causing mass effect, more likely consistent with a meningioma.
Frozen section was consistent with a meningioma with no atypical features.
