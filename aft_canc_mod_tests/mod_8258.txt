Repeat ERCP attempted although unsuccessful due to duodenal narrowing; this prompted placement of a PTBD ([**2200-5-30**]).
During the workup at that time, she was found to have intra/extra hepatic biliary dilatation on ultrasound, from likely extrinsic compression of the pancreatic mass.
She underwent an ERCP which demonstrated probable tumor infiltration into the duodenum with distal CBD stricture and subsequently underwent biliary stent placement, following which her LFTs improved.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2200-6-8**] the ventricular response is slightly faster.
She was eventually restarted on coumadin, received 2mg of coumadin on [**2200-6-13**] with an AM INR of 2.6, which was therapeutic.
Her coumadin held on admission for a possible GI bleed, and then reversed w/ FFP for the ERCP.
Her creatinine eventually settled to 1.3.
#Hypoxia -CXR on [**5-31**] was read as LLL collapse and or consolidation, right perhilar opacity similar to prior without overt CHF.
Given that her CXR on [**5-29**] was clear, it was more consistent with atelectasis and edema rather than a post obstructiv pneumonia.
They perihilar opacity could reflect edema as well and the pt improved with diuresis.
Repeat CXR showed improvement.
While on the floor she maintained good oxygen saturations without supplementation.
#Hypothyroidism:--continued Synthroid  #DM2: monitor blood sugars.
CV: The patient has a history of A-fib, her Coumadin was held prior surgery and her HR was 90-110.
After surgery (on POD # 2) patient developed rapid A-fib with HR 120-140.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; she received one unit of pRBC post op for low urine output.
Hct was stable prior discharge.
12. warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: Please check INR on [**2200-6-14**] and adjust Coumadin dose as necessary.
Cholangitis 2.
You were restarted on coumadin, and your INR on [**2200-6-13**] was 2.6, within goal, you received 2mg of coumadin on [**2200-6-13**] prior to discharge.
