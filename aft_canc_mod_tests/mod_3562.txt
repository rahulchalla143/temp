In ED, repeat head ct showed no bleed but incidental mass likely meningioma.
IMAGING: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2146-6-8**] 5:12 PM 1.
ECG Study Date of [**2146-6-8**]  2:41:08 PM Probable multifocal atrial tachycardia Consider left ventricular hypertrophy Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes No previous tracing available for comparison .
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2146-6-9**] 1:21 AM Probable meningioma along the anterior falx.
ECG Study Date of [**2146-6-9**]  8:26:22 AM [**Month (only) 116**] be sinus tachycardia but consider also atrial tachycardia Borderline left axis deviation - is nonspecific Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes Since previous tracing of the same date, ventricular response more regular .
ct abd [**6-14**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
# C diff: Found positive at OSH, likely secondary to recent antibiotics used for treating pneumonia.
WBC count began to rise day after admission, with low grade fevers, and increase abdominal distension.
Pt had a CT abd scan which showed thickened loops of bowel consistent with the given history of colitis.
His studies lacked signs of ileus, though he was noted to have distention and trouble with tube feeds so he was kept NPO and followed by GI.
Pt hemodynamically stable, Hct 42.
He had his hematocrit checked frequently, was given IVF and remained stable and never required blood products.
GI followed the patient and an endoscopy was not done.
Calcium low but within normal when corrected for albumin.
Most likely meningioma based on CT and MRI.
Neurosurgery eval pt on admission and no intervention was recommended, with suggested followup in 3 month with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] and a repeat MRI head at that time.
