He underwent a BAL on [**1-11**] which showed strep pneumo.
He was then recently admitted on [**1-13**]- [**1-14**] with dehydration and pneumonia, was treated, and discharged with an appointment for a video swallowing study on [**1-19**] to evaluate for aspiration.
He underwent this study today and per patient this went well.
On arrival he had a temp of 100.8, HR in the 140 - 160s, BP 70 - 90 systolic.
Since his BP was labile, he was placed on Levophed.
His Hb decreased from 12 to 8 after fluids and he was transfused 1 unti of PRBC in the ED.

Chest: chest rose and fell with equal size, shape and symmetry, lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, though with decreased breath sounds.
CV: PMI appreciated in the fifth ICS in the midclavicular line without heaves or thrills, RRR, normal S1 and S1 no murmurs rubs, distant heart sounds Abd: Normoactive BS, NT and ND.

AP SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison to AP upright chest of two hours [**Known lastname **].
No other significant interval change  CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1) Interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions and free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis without abscess identified.
His lactate continue to be low, his pressure increased with fluid boluses and his Levophed was weaned to off.
Blood and urine cultures were also taken which were also negative.
CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis was negative for any obvious source of infection, and he remained afebrile with a normal WBC.
Pt also had TTE showing mild diastolic dysfunction but o/w no signficant structural heart disease to account for syncope.
Later in hospital course, pt was found profoundly orthostatic with systolic pressure going from 100 to 50 w/ supine to standing.
Torso CT was obtained to evaluate fo disease progression as his degree of FTT is out of proportion to his chemotherpy and known stage of his disease.
CT did not show any significant interval change in his disease.
?Colonic Thickening with free fluid: This was seen incidentally on staging CT of chest and abdomen.
