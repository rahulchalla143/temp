Initial vitals were WNL; however, after 2 hours in the ED, the patient spiked a temperature of 103, and had a HR 110, SBP 170s, RR 40s and decreased O2 sat.
A CTA was negative for PE (but found lung nodules).
He also got a head CT, abd/pelvic CT which were pending at the time of admission to the MICU.
When called to see pt (4h after above interventions) the patient was snoring, 99%on 4L, RR22, with ABG 7.36/41/105.

* CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2115-4-9**] 3:05 AM CT ANGIOGRAM CHEST: There are no filling defects within the pulmonary artery, proximal, or distal branches to suggest the presence of a pulmonary embolism.
Lung windows reveal panacinar emphysema, with a 1.8 x 0.9 mm spiculated nodule within the left lower lobe anteriorly, as well as a 9 x 9 mm spiculated nodule within the right middle lobe, with surrounding peribronchial thickening.
Limited imaging through the abdomen demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic disease, and calcifications within the pancreas consistent with chronic pancreatitis.
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
* CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2115-4-9**] 5:16 AM CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL, WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Lung bases demonstrate focal opacities within the right posterior and anterior lung bases.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT ORAL, WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Contrast is seen filling the bladder.
* CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2115-4-9**] 1:59 AM There are vague linear opacities in the right and left lower lung zones, consistent with the patient's CT scan showing spiculated nodules in these regions.
IMPRESSION: Patchy opacities in bilateral lower lung zones, consistent with the patient's CT scan showing spiculated nodules in those areas.
It appeared that he began to show signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal in the ED with increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate.
A CTA was negative for PE, head CT was negative for bleed, and abd/pelvic CT was negative for intra-abdominal source for infection.
In the MICU, he was monitored on a CIWA scale with PRN valium.
Given his altered mental status on admission, there was some concern for aspiration so he was continued on levofloxacin.
