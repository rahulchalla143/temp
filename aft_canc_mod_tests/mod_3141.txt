While placing an arterial line, his blood pressure began to fall.
He was given over 5 liters of fluid with eventual stabilization of his blood pressure with MAPs in the 50s.
He was likely adrenally insufficient, given his outpatient regimen including prednisone, so he was started on stress-dose steroids.
Acidosis - He was found to have a significant acidosis.
His ventilator was set to attempt to correct the acidosis, but his blood pressure and hypoxia were confounding factors.
An x-ray and ultrasound were performed for evaluation, as the patient was too sick to go for CT.
C diff - He was treated with IV metronidazole.
Glucose control - His blood glucose was controlled with an insulin drip.
