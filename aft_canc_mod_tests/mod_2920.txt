In the ED, his initial vitals were 97.6, BP 135/45, HR 74, RR 17, 94% on 4 L NC.

Chest CT [**2106-3-26**]: FINDINGS: Superimposed upon marked centrilobular emphysema are ground- glass opacities and subsegmental atelectasis in the dependent portion of the right upper and lower lobes, and to a smaller degree in the superior segment of the left lower lobe.
Evaluation of the visualized abdomen is limited secondary to arm- related artifact, but there is an indeterminate soft tissue structure abutting the upper pole of the right kidney.
Renal ultrasound [**2106-3-26**]: 1.
Repeat examination with a full bladder could be performed.
[**2106-3-29**] VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: A study done in conjunction with speech and swallow division.
Echo [**2106-3-22**] MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.5 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm) Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.7 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 70% (nl >=55%) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 2.0 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 1.1 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 1.1 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 1.00 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 228 msec  INTERPRETATION: Findings: LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
Mild (1+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
EGD [**2106-3-30**] Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Colonoscopy [**2106-3-30**] A single 1 cm polyp of benign appearance was found in the proximal ascending colon.
Repeat colonoscopy in 6 weeks due to sub optimal prep.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2106-3-27**]):       OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA ABSENT.
Pt had been doing well until time of transfer to MICU when being turned in bed, developed sudden acute SOB w/ HR to 100s, SBP to 190s, O2 sat to 90s on FM, RR 45 on continuous neb.
ABG on NRB 7.34/61/161/34 during acute episode.
On arrival to MICU, pt feeling better, however, RR still ~30s, given an additional 2mg morphine with good effect.
Has had stress test which was "many years ago" and normal.
Pt will need cardiac evaluation and stress testing once his respiratory status is stabilized.
The hematocrit was stable.
PE:  INR drifted down and we started a heparin drip when INR <2.0.
Patient was maintained on heparin until GIB was cleared by colonoscopy and then until therapeutic x 48 hours with INR >2.0 on coumadin.
COPD/Pneumonia: Patient with wheezing on exam and is on steroid taper for recent COPD flare.
Because of the prolonged steroid course, ID recommended 1SS bactrim for 3-6 months after final taper of steroids (instead of DS to help with INR/coumadin levels).
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).
Outpatient Lab Work Please have VNA draw INR on Tuesday, [**4-6**], and call the result to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9385**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 25161**].
