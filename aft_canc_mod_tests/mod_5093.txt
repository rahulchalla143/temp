In the emergency department, initial vitals were:  Temperature 102.2 F, pulse 103, blood pressure 94/69, respiration 18, and oxygen saturation 94% in room air.
Laboratory studies on arrival were significant for leukocytosis 16, Hct 34, lactate 1.4 and positive urinalysis.
Shortly after arrival, the patient's blood pressure dropped to 80/50s, she was given Zosyn, Reglan, Tylenol 1 gm PO, Valium 5 mg PO and Ativan 1 mg IV for agitation, Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV, and 5 L IVF.
Blood pressure transiently improved to low 100s, but again declined to 80s.

She initially required norepinephrine for blood pressure support, but her blood pressure quickly improved after antibiotic treatment and fluid resuscitation of about 6 liter.
Her creatinine was normal on admission and has remained stable.
She will have an outpatient CT abdomen and pelvis to evaluate the cause further.
(3) Pyelonephritis: - Initially managed in the ICU setting with IV Meropenem - Urine culture from [**Hospital3 417**] was positive for E. Coli, sensitive with MIC <0.12 to levofloxacin.
(4) Macrocytic Anemia:  Her Hct has dropped from 44 to 33.7 in the past week with no current evidence of bleeding.
Her Hct was 42.9 at OSH, so lower Hct could be secondary to hemodilution.
