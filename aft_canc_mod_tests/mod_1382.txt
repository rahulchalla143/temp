He also has a history of a heart murmur and underwent his initial echocardiogram back in [**2187**] where he was found to have aortic stenosis.
He is followed with surveillance echocardiograms and his most recent study was on [**2197-6-27**] after he reported episodes of dyspnea.
He was found to have severe concentric LVH, his overall left ventricular systolic dysfunction was normal and his EF was 55-60%.
His peak aortic valve gradient was 104 mmHg, mean gradient was 59 mmHg and the aortic valve area was 0.57 cm2.
He had mild MR, and mild pulmonary HTN with PASP 34 + 5 mmHg assuming his RV pressure was normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 17 mmHg).
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] experienced intermittant self limitinbg atrial fibrillation and flutter - lopressor was increased and remained in NSR.
