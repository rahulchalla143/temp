Importantly, she had a PE in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year and was placed on Lovenox 100mg daily.
[**Name2 (NI) **] last brain imaging here was done in [**2132-3-24**] and showed significant interval decrease in size of the enhancing metastatic lesion within the right frontal lobe, as well as diminished associated vasogenic edema.
We were contact[**Name (NI) **] by them stating that they wished to transfer her here because a head CT showed "hemorrhagic conversion of a prior known met."
Patient was given 4mg of MSO4 and a total of 5mg of dilaudid.
We reviewed head CT at OSH and that done here upon arrival.
Of note, labs at OSH notable for platelets of 139(coags not done).
Physical Exam: VS: Afeb BP 102/67 HR 90 RR17 100% RA  GENERAL: LUNGS: CTAB, no wheezing/rhonchi/rales, no crackles CV: RRR, no murmurs/gallops/rubs, no JVD ABD: + BS, soft, non-distended, non-tender, no HSM EXTREMITIES: no erythema, WWP  NEUROLOGICAL: (EXAM DONE ON PROPOFOL with possibility of lingering vecuronium) Intubated and Sedated.
Pupils 2.5 to 1.5mm bilaterally.
DTRs 3+ throughout with toes upgoing bilaterally.
Exam on Discharge: Neurologically intact  Pertinent Results: LABS: PT 12.9, INR 1.1 platelets 113  CT/CTA head  IMPRESSION:  1.
Please see further details on the conventional angiogram, performed subsequently which better demonstrated the aneurysm.
[**2132-9-15**] FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and tibial veins.
[**2132-9-1**] CT perfusion    IMPRESSION: 1.
Anterior communicating aneurysm clip in place with limited evaluation of residual patency.
Additional intracerebral metastases are better demonstrated on prior MRI from [**2131-10-25**].
[**2132-9-7**] CT perfusion IMPRESSION: 1.
The left hemispheric infarcts demonstrated on the DWI sequence of the recent MRI are not well appreciated on this study.
Imaging was done in the emergency department of the OSH which showed that she had diffuse SAH the OSH transfered her to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] CTA of the head was done which showed that she had an Anterior communicating artery aneurysm which had ruptured.
She underwent coiling of the aneurysm x 2, she recevied an intravenous fluid bolus of 500 cc for a systolic blood pressure in the 80's.
Her urine output was also borderline oliguric with an average hourly output of 30cc/hr.
On exam the morning of 8.6 she was stable and her exam was nonfocal.
Her nimodopine was held for the bradycardia and her EEG continued to show frontal slowing.
The decision was made to not press her blood pressures as she was clinically stable.
On [**9-3**] her exam remained stable in the morning and she underwent a cerebral angiogram which showed no definitive spasm but verapamil was given.
Following the angiogram her exam was altered and she was perseverative.
She had an MRI of the Brain and L/S spine on the afternoon of [**9-3**] which showed a small left frontal infarct and a L5-S1 herniated disc abutting the descending S1 nerve root.
Also on [**9-3**] she was evaluated by neuro-oncology for thoracic mets that were seen on MRI on [**2131-12-24**].
They recommended that the SAH be treated first and then to get repeat MRI of the thoracic spine to evaluate the metastasis further.
They also recommended MRI fo the Brain and Lumbar spine which she received.
On [**9-4**] her blood pressure was liberalized to >160 systolic on neosynephrine and levophed.
her exam was not notably improved.
On the morning of [**9-5**] her exam was much improved and she was at her baseline.
Her blood pressure was liberalized again to only treat for SBP<140.
Also her Nimodopine was divided so that it was deleivered 30mg q2hours instead of 60mg q4hours to aid in achieving her blood pressure goals.
otherwise her exam was unchanged however a CTA of the head was obtained which was stable from previous studies.
A CXR was obtained which showed that she had pulmonary vascular overload and her IV fluids were stopped.
On the morning of [**9-8**] her exam remained the same and her blood pressure goal was liberalized to only treat for <120 systolic overnight.
On the morning of [**9-9**] her exam continued to be stable and we allowed her blood pressure to liberalize as long as her clinical exam did not worsen.
