EMS was called and took him to [**Hospital3 **], where a non-contrast head CT showed a new hypodensity in the right parietal lobe consistent with an acute infarct, along with changes suggestive of his old left MCA stroke.
He was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation and management.

URINE CULTURE- no growth  CT head [**2141-4-12**] Hypodensity in the right parietal lobe consistent with acute infarct.
TTE [**2141-4-13**] The left atrium is elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
MRI brain, MRA head/neck [**2141-4-13**] 1.
CTA head/neck [**4-14**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates diminished vascular structures in the infarcts.
Chest X ray [**4-17**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-12**] through 12:  The head and chin obscure much of the upper mid chest.
CXR [**4-20**] FINDINGS: The course of the Dobbhoff catheter is unremarkable.
CXR [**4-23**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the Dobbhoff catheter has been replaced by a nasogastric tube.
His blood pressure was allowed to autoregulate for the first 48 hours after the event.
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no cardiac source for his stroke.
The patient's LDL was 74 and HbA1c was 5.6.
He underwent an MRI brain and MRA of his head and neck.
The MRI brain confirmed the right parietal subacute infarct, however also appeared suspicious for possible acute infarct in the left parietal lobe in the region of his prior stroke in [**2139**], as this region was also bright on DWI and dark on ADC.
This remains somewhat uncertain as the area of infarct appears unchanged when comparing to his imaging in [**2139**], although MRI sequences do reveal the concern for possible bilateral acute strokes.
An MRA of the head and neck was notable for moderate to high-grade narrowing at the origin of the right ICA, although degree of stenosis was difficult to quantify.
Therefore, the patient underwent CTA head and neck which showed 30-40% stenosis at the origin of right internal carotid artery, which was considered mild , and it did not show evidence of any other abnormality.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was attempted which could not be completed owing to parapharyngeal mass.
His examination is notable for inattention, fluent empty non meaningful speech, moving all extermities antigravity.
A urine culture was sterile.
CV; The patient was continued on his beta blocker at 1/4 his home dose to allow for permissive hypertension in the acute setting of stroke and as he was bradycardic on telemetry with a heart rate in the 50s-60s.
he was started on his home meds in stepwise fashion keeping a watch over his blood pressure.
This responded to irrigation and his hematocrit remained relatively stable.
Warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM: Dose needs to be monitered with INR goal of [**3-8**], and plavix needs to be stopped after INR is therapeutic.
Clopidogrel 75 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): Please stop after INR is therapeutic ([**3-8**]).

You had CT scan and MRI of brain which showed bilateral parietal strokes.
