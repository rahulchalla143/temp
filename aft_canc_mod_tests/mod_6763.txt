Deep biopsy and deep cultures of epidural abscess.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 82412**] is a 77 year old man with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hypertension, diabetes transferred on [**5-18**] from [**Hospital 82413**] hospital for evaluation of confusion and neck stiffness.
His daughter took him to [**Hospital3 5365**] where a CT of the c-spine was performed.
On [**5-8**], the patient was taken to his PCP for evaluation and at that point he was referred to Carnitas for work-up.
Echo (TTE) was performed and was negative for vegitation.
Due to persistent neck pain, the patient had a Head CT that showed enlarged ventricles but nothing acute.
MRI showed hyperintense T2 signal in the left paraspinal muscles; no evidence of abcess or osteomyelitis.
INR was 6.1 on admission and coumadin was held.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-18**] for further work-up at the request of the patient's PCP.
Neuro exam at baseline as on admission.

MRI SOFT TISSUE NECK, W/O & W/CONTRAST ([**5-20**]) 1.
Heterogeneous pattern of enhancement is noted in the base of the odontoid process on the right, raising the possibility of infiltration or osteomyelitis, correlation with CT of the cervical spine is recommended for further assessment.
MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST ([**5-20**]) 1.
Multiple foci of T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity distributed in the subcortical white matter, likely consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] W& W/O CONTRAST ([**5-26**]): Slight interval decrease in size of epidural abscess at C2 with decreased mass effect on the cord.
Video Oropharyngeal Swallow ([**5-30**]): Improvement but onoing severe dyphagia with aspiration of thin liquids.
Patient had a CT and MRI scan of the cervical spine on [**2108-5-20**] that showed an epidural abscess at the level of the C2 vertebral body with probable osteomyelitis involving the odontoid process.
Patient was transferred to the MICU on [**2108-5-20**] for close observation and neuro checks every 2 hours.
ENT was consulted on [**5-21**] and felt the abscess was most likely from hematogenous seeding, with no clear fistula tract or upper airway gross lesion.
He had a repeat MRI of the cervical spine to evaluate for any progression of the epidural abscess.
The MRI showed unchanged epidural abscess posterior to C2, unchanged osteomyelitis of odontoid process, and unchanged spinal cord compression from prior study.
Orthopedic spine evaluated patient and determined patient needed urgent surgery.
Patient had stat CT C-spine, which showed increased cortical destruction of the posterior and anterior aspect of the dens, with no displacement or fracture.
Pus was drained from the C2 site, but no hardware was placed due to risk of infection.
Bacteremia/Leukocytosis: Patient was afebrile on transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], with a leukocytosis of 21k.
Given history of unprotected intercourse, RPR and chlamydia tests were sent and were negative.
Serial [**Month/Year (2) **] cultures ([**5-19**], [**5-20**], [**5-22**], [**5-23**], [**5-29**]) all showed no growth to date.
Urine culture from [**5-19**] had less than 100k organisms (Pseudomonas, klebsiella), repeat urine culture obtained [**5-23**] showed less than 10k organisms.
Patient had a transthoracic echo on [**5-23**] that showed no valvular vegetations.
On request, [**Hospital 1263**] hospital transferred the [**Hospital **] sample on [**5-24**] to [**Hospital1 18**], and the sample was sent out to [**Hospital1 **] for sensitivity testing.
On [**5-23**], the video swallow was obtained and showed severe oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin and nectar thick liquids.
Radiology re-evaluated his MRI of the brain and did not see any other findings that could explain his dysphagia.
Repeat video swallow showed improved swallowing function from previous video swallow on [**5-23**], but with continued risk of aspiration.
C. Effortful swallow and [**3-7**] repeat swallows for each sip.
-- Repeat instrumental evaluation at rehab prior to upgrading diet and once patient has cervical collar removed to further assess swallow function and effectiveness of treatment techniques.
-- Ongoing assessment of tube feeding requirements and electrolytes needs by nutrition.
Please check Potassium and Magnesium twice - three times weekly and replete as needed  4.
Patient was noted to be tachycardic with a heart rate in the low 100s on [**5-22**].
Patient's INR increased from 1.3 on [**5-18**] to 1.6 on [**5-24**], most likely due to nutritional deficiency.
The patient's heart rate continued in the 90s-110s, and thus his diltiazem was increased to 90 mg QID for improved control.
Patient's heart rate remained borderline tachycardic, and increased with exertion, and thus his lopressor was uptitrated to 50 mg PO TID.
-- Ongoing monitoring of INR and dose adjustment of coumadin, goal INR 2.0-2.3  5.
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 772**] will connect to [**Hospital1 18**] for urology appointment.
Patient's [**Hospital1 **] glucose levels were well-controlled prior to surgery.
Following surgery and initiation of tube feeds, patient's [**Hospital1 **] glucose levels rose into the 200s.
A stool sample was sent for C.diff toxin.
The C.difficile toxin test came back negative later on [**5-30**].
-- Ongoing monitoring of stool frequency, reinitiation of bowel regimen if indicated  8.
-- Patient will need dedicated MRI of the posterior fossa with contrast for further evaluation to be discussed with his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

The radiologists recommend that you have an ultrasound of your neck done to further evaluate the nodule.
The MRI also noted a possible schwannoma of your ear and you can discuss an MRI of the posterior fossa, if needed.
