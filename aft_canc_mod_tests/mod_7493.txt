[**2197-10-26**] Blood cultures x 2- PENDING  Imaging:  [**2197-10-25**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph there is no relevant change.
EGD was performed and showed portal gastropathy (presumed cause of bleeding) and non-bleeding varices not requiring any banding.
Her melena decreased, and she was stable for transfer out of the MICU.
Her CXR was clear, ans she had URI symptoms with sinus pressure.
She was on ceftriaxone at the time, and given she had a small amount of ascites, she had a tap of the ascites performed by IR who saw minimal amount of fluid and only got 1/2 cc, which was sent for cell count which was negative for SBP.
As the iron studies performed during this admission were during the time she received a blood transfusion, these should be repeated on a outpatient basis.
