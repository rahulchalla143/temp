Of ote, 4/4 bottles on blood cultures grew pneumococcus as above.
TTE was done that showed a small vegetaion on aortic valve vs thickened vale.
CXR - no pneumonia.
Coumadin was however stopped after the results of TTE were obtained as likely vegetation due risk of bleeding.
Repeat ECG was requested, but patient left AMA prior to this.
Given the penicillin allergy - no other appropriate alternative was recommended by them especially since the patient could have acute endocarditis.
The ECHO shows that you may have an infection of the heart valve.
Since your heart rate was very fast, a medicine called diltiazem (extended release) has been started to control the heart rate.
Because of the fast and irregular heart rate, you are at an increased risk of clots being formed in the heart and causing a stroke etc.
Repeat liver tests are recommended as well.
While on the antibiotics, monitor your blood sugars closely for too high or too low values.
Please visit him today and have him check an INR level to make sure it is not rising.
