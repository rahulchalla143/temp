Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Compared with the prior study dated [**2171-12-5**], pulmonary pressures are higher.
WOUND CULTURES - pending  Brief Hospital Course: 69 YOF with AVR/MVR and CABG with subsequent trach in [**2172-11-7**], NHL s/p splenectomy who presents from [**Hospital1 **] with a right lower leg hematoma after she struck her leg a couple weeks ago.
Superficial cultures were negative.
Deep cultures were sent on [**1-16**].
# CABG/AVR/MVR: INR goal 2.5-3.5, found to have an INR of 1.8 so a heparin drip was started to bridge.
Echo was performed and was mostly unchanged.
