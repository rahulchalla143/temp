Initial sputums grew out pneumococci.
Patient had EKGs without signs of ischemia, and  multiple sets of normal cardiac enzymes.
This infection was found to be MSSA, which also grew out of his blood and eventually out of his R chest chemo-port, which was removed by surgery.
A TEE demonstrated no signs of endocarditis.
On [**12-20**] his pre-existing R chest chemo port was noted to be purulent and was removed by surgery.
A [**12-21**] culture grew out yeast and he was started on a course of fluconisol as per ID.
He has a bronchoscopy on [**12-18**] which showed diffuse thick bloody sputum greatest in the R LL.
On [**12-25**] the patient was noted to have an increasing o2 requirement and a CXR demonstrated a moderate-sized R pneumothorax.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and placed a chest tube.
#GBM:  Head CTs compared to his baseline [**Hospital1 2025**] scans showed no interval change.
His anemia was mild, and did require occasional transfusion.
A repeat head CT showed no change; his delerium was felt to be mainly post-septic and ICU related and appeared to be slowly intervally improving each day.
# Electrolytes:  The patient required extensive repletion of his potassium during his ICU course, often requiring q6hr lyte checks and 100-200meq of K+ per day.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Five (5) ml PO BID (2 times a day).
Ceftriaxone-Dextrose (Iso-osm) 1 gram/50 mL Piggyback Sig: One (1) gram Intravenous Q24H (every 24 hours).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Septic Shock Community Aquired Pneumonia Respiratory Failure Acute Renal Failure Septic Arthritis (L Knee) Bacteremia Infected R Chest Catheter Afib with RVR Delerium Anemia Thrombocytopenia Hyperglycemia Pneumothorax (R) Hypokalemia Transaminitis  Secondary: # Grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme left temporal lobe; s/p high dose radiotherapy, previously on high dose steroids, recently tapered.
