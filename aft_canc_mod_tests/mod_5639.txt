If clinically indicated, a repeat CT could be performed in 6 hours.
Otherwise, unremarkable non-contrast head CT scan.

Clinical correlation and additional testing suggested including       culture and detection of serum antibody.
The likely source of these were the patient's pneumonia based on the radiograph findings and physical exam which was significant for rhales.
This was difficult to mannage early on in the patient's course as it seemed that the patient's febrile illness was exacerbating his heart's underlyiing tendency to beat fast in response to fibrillating atria - his heart rate reached the 160s.
The patient was maintained on telemetry and his rate was controlled with metoprolol at varying dosages from 50 to 100mg TID.
The patient's INR was kept between 2 and 3 on his home dose of coumadin.
Ultrasound of the left kidney failed to show a clear cause of the patient's discomfort, but did reveal a new 1.5-cm hypoechoic area that is surrounded by a hyperechoic rim.
Legionella PNA 2.
