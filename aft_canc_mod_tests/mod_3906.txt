CTA revealed acute PE involving segmental branches to RLL and RUL PNA.
Bedside ECHO revealed no RV strain.
EKG showed sinus tach 130s.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
Physical Exam: VS: T 98.4 HR 136 BP 147/97 RR 17 99% RA GEN: Middle aged man in acute distress, moaning in pain from joints.

CXR [**9-25**] - Cavitating ill-defined density in the right upper lobe suggestive of pneumonic consolidation, however, a neoplasm cannot be entirely excluded and follow up to clearance is recommended.
CXR [**9-26**] - Two AP views were brought to our review, but note is made that both of them do not include part of the right upper lobe.
CXR [**9-28**] -  Both extent and the density of the previous right upper lobe opacity has markedly decreased.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-9-24**], the mild resting LVOT gradient and valvular systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve are more apparent.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be recommended for assessment of endocarditis.
EGD [**9-30**]: Localized erythematous mucosa with edema and friability noted in the esophagus adjacent to the proximal border of the metal stent.
TTE did not demonstrate right heart strain which suggests that the PE is likely small.
## RUL pna: Pna reported on CTA Chest as well as multiple CXR.
Cefepime and vancomycin were discontinued at the time of discharge, as his chest x-ray had resolved, suggesting no infectious process was present.
PPI was continued and serial Hcts were performed to r/o acute bleed.
EGD was performed and demonstrated no bleeding source; no intervention was performed.
Serum Osm normal and FeNA 1.  .
Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed.
You had one episode of bloody vomit and an upper endoscopy was performed on [**2104-9-30**].
