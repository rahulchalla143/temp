Colonoscopy ([**9-5**]): Diverticulosis of the whole colon.
Due to only fair prep, which was inadequate, would recommend repeat colonoscopy within the next 1 year.
A CTA abdomen revealed active extravasation in the ascending colon.
Prior to being transported from the ER, the patient was noted to have systolic pressures in the 60-70s, and was fluid resuscitated and transfused with packed red blood cells.
His hematocrit was trended, and stabilized around 30%.
The patient had a colonoscopy performed at OSH 5 years before this admission, which revealed extensive diverticular disease throughout the colon.
The patient was transferred to the general medicine floor and his hematocrits continued to be trended, and remained stable around 30%.
