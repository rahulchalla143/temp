He underwent cooling over the ensuing day per protocol without significant complications followed by rewarming, during which he was felt to be relatively hypothermic, prompting a septic work-up with cultures; cultures were found to be negative.
Urine output was < 50cc daily; renal consultation noted a poor prognosis for returned kidney function.
Examination after rewarming and off sedation showed absent corneal reflex, abnormal oculocephalic reflex, little to no pupillary reflex vs. hippus, and low tidal volumes when temporarily taken off of the vent.
