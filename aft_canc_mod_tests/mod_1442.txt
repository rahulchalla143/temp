He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care, catheterization, and possible surgery.
He has had a PTCA with stent to his left LAD in [**2195**], which was complicated by acute renal failure with a creatinine in between 2.5 and 4.0.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His past medical history is as follows:  Coronary artery disease status post MI in [**2195**] and PCI/stent to the LAD; aortic stenosis, [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.6 centimeter squared in [**2195**]; hypertension; acute renal failure after PCI in [**2195**], he was on dialysis, but not presently, with a creatinine of 2.5 to 4.0; hypercholesterolemia; prostate cancer status post radical prostatectomy and radiation treatment; anemia, the patient is on Epogen; COPD.
LABORATORY DATA:  His chest x-ray was negative for any cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
His white blood count was 9.5 and hematocrit 27.6.
Platelets 128,000.
Sodium 139, potassium 4.2, chloride 104, bicarbonate 22, BUN 57, creatinine 2.7, glucose 178, CPK 463, and troponin T is 1.3.
PT 12.7, PTT 34.1, and INR 1.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  So, once again, the plan for this patient:  This is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, which he currently has a fever, and the plan was to follow up on his cultures that were taken a day before.
We will get a Panorex x-ray and Dental consult, have cardiac catheterization, an echocardiogram, and a carotid study, and also have an ID consult to rule out infectious source of his fever and a Hematology/Oncology consult to evaluate his anemia and a possible metastatic workup for his prostate CA.
Carotid ultrasounds revealed no significant hemodynamic lesion in either the left or right carotid artery.
Cardiac catheterization was performed on [**2197-9-19**], which showed the following results:  LMCA was normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Echocardiogram performed on [**2197-9-19**] showed the following results:  Severe aortic stenosis, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional systolic dysfunction, mild aortic regurgitation, at least mild mitral regurgitation.
On [**2197-9-29**], the patient was brought into the operating room for cardiac surgery.
The patient's condition on transfer to the CSIU is as follows: He had a rate of 80 beats per minute in normal sinus rhythm, mean arterial pressure of 67, CVP of 5, PA diastolic of 13, and PA mean of 21.
His heart rate was regular rate and rhythm.
His temperature was 99.7 degrees F., 94 normal sinus rhythm heart rate, BP 106/45, and respirations 14.
His white blood count was 11.3, hematocrit was 29.2, and platelet count was 84,000, which was down from 113,000.
His hematocrit, I guess, was 29.2, which was down from 37.
On postoperative day number 2, the patient was still receiving milrinone at 0.3 mg now, which was down from 0.5 mg, insulin of 4 units, Natrecor of 0.01 mg, and he was on 40 mg of Lasix intravenously.
His hematocrit now was 31.2.
His heart rate was a little tachycardic at 100.
Hemodynamically, he was tachycardic at 106, BP 129/54, and oxygen saturation was 94 percent.
Hematocrit was 32.7, white blood count was 10.3, his BUN was 46, creatinine 2.8, which was down from 2.9.
The plan was to recheck a x-ray to see if there was any expansion, which was not of his pneumothorax, and to wean his milrinone and to check the hepatic panel.
Hemodynamically, his BP was 152/63, temperature of 99 degrees F., heart rate of 99, and his oxygen saturation was 96 percent.
White blood count was down to 7.8, hematocrit was stable at 32.6, and his platelet count was down to 60,000 from 67,000.
The plan was to discontinue his Natrecor, start Lopressor, and remove his epicardial pacing wires.
Heart rate was 76, sinus rhythm.
BP 126/63, temperature of 99.3 degrees F.  The patient was alert and oriented x3.
The plan was to increase his Lopressor to 50 mg b.i.d., decrease his Lasix to 40 mg b.i.d., continue monitoring of his creatinine, and have Rehab Physical Therapy screen the patient in Cardiac Intensive Care.
His white blood count was now 5.9, his hematocrit is 34.4, and his platelets are 114,000.
The BP was slightly elevated at 153/69, and his respiratory rate was elevated at 24.
His oxygen saturation was 99 percent on room air.
His physical examination was unremarkable.
Following cardiac surgery, his course improved dramatically, and he was discharged postoperatively from cardiac surgery on day number 10.
His physical examination on discharge:  Neurologically, he was grossly intact.
His lungs were clear to auscultation with decrease at the left lower base.
His heart rate was regular rate and rhythm, positive S1 and S2, with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
His temperature was 99.3 degrees F., pulse of 78 and sinus rhythm, respiratory rate of 20, BP of 107/54, and oxygen saturation of 96 percent.
His weight was 79 kg; preoperatively, he was 78 kg.
