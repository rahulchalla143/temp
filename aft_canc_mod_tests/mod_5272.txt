Update [**2191-6-21**]: .
Hct of 23.2 on [**6-19**] and guaiac pos, increase to > 25 by [**6-20**] without intervention, and again on low end at 23.8 on [**6-21**].
Has Iron studies c/w ACD.
Improving amylase and lipase since [**6-17**].
Increase on [**6-19**] possibly [**3-10**] C diff since switched off Flagyl to Vanco for pancreatitis.
WBC down to WNL x 2 days at time of discharge, afebrile.
Pending blood ctx, C diff toxin B. .
Tachycardic intermittently, with one 'trigger' event of tachycardia to 160, pt felt a chest flutter, no chest pain or pressure, resolved with already-scheduled Metoprolol dose.
EKG showing MAT vs. WAP, not necessarily AF-RVR.
CXR [**6-15**] w/ continued mild/moderate pulmonary edema / effusions, no focal process.
Blood Pressure.
With diarrhea and guaiac positive stool originally, colonoscopy showed ascending, transverse, and descending colon involvement with sigmoid sparing.
C diff negative x 4, with toxin B result still pending at time off discharge.
pancreatitis etiology from [**Date range (1) 66647**], then back to Flagyl since [**6-18**] when WBC increased when pt was off Flagyl.
A head CT showed a non-acute left basal ganglia lacune and probable older multi-infarct/ischemia-related changes, no acute bleed or change seen to explain delirium.
Neurology commented that delirium should improve daily, and noted unrelated mild b/l upper extremity weakness, and said to consider cervical MRI at some point if further workup of the UE weakness was indicated.
Pt's diet was switched to IVF / NPO for 2-3 days during her pancreatic enzyme elevation and abdominal pain/tenderness, then advanced to sips to clears and currently to full liquids on discharge, with pancreatic enzymes trending down and no clinical signs of pancreatitis.

You can also discuss whether to get a cervical spine MRI to evaluate this weakness.
