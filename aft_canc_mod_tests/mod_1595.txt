On arrival of EMS, VS 98.2, HR 93, BP 140/90, RR 20, O2 93% on RA.
They also recommended advanced ET tube to R side to protect his lung, which was done.
He was reportedly hypotensive to 80/50, femoral line was placed, and levophed gtt was started with improvement in BP to systolic in the low 100s.
He was transferred to the MICU on AC at 100% FiO2, 20, 550, PEEP 5. .

CT Head [**2120-2-9**] - There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
CT Chest [**2120-2-9**] - Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, small bilaterally, but left greater than right.
CT Head [**2120-2-17**] - This study is slightly limited due to patient motion.
2D ECHO [**2120-2-19**] - Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-15**], LV systolic function is more impaired (35-40%).
The prior echo images were also suboptimal - the ejection fraction may have been OVERestimated on the prior study.
HCT remained stable, no evidence of hemoptysis.
MRI and LP were deferred out of request of family not to use sedating medications.
After initial hypoxic respiratory failure prompting transfer to ICU, patient underwent EEG which showed  mild to moderate encephalopathy.
CT head was negative for acute intracranial process x 2.
ABG were consistent with primary respiratory alkalosis.
#CAD: ECG not significantly changed from prior.
EKG remained unchanged.
Echo was done and showed .....  # Hypotension: He briefly required pressors.
Hypotension was likely due to a combination of positive pressure ventilation and medication effect, less likely significant hemodynamic loss into thorax or adrenal infufficiency given relatively low (physiologic) home dose of prednisone.
# Anemia: Patient has known AIHA related to CLL and HCT 25 from baseline 28-30.
Hct was subsequently stable.
