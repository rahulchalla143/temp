She was sent to the OSH ED for IVF as her systolic BPs were in the 80s and she was discharged on PO cipro.
At the OSH, she was evaluated w/ a CT L spine which was negative for spinal mets.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for lumbar spine MRI to further evaluate her lower extremity pathology.
Exam was notable for heme negative stool on rectal with good tone, no saddle anesthesia and intact neurologic exam.
EKG was read as LBBB, rate 110, no SG criteria and amiodarone was discontinued.
Pt underwent CTA abd/pelvis to assess for aortic pathology which was notable for a complex ovarian cyst, multiple likely lytic lesions in the acetabulum and RP LAD.
As her neurologic exam was intact, no acute spinal pathology was suspected and MRI spine was not pursued.
She was initially admitted to the MICU for further management- VS on transfer to the MICU were 115 104/71 18 100%.
On evaluation of her EKGs, the MICU resident consulted cardiology and given concern for slow VT she is being transferred to the CCU for further management.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 10 cm.
PULSES: 2+ DPs and PTs b/l NEURO: alert and oriented x3; CNII-XII tested and intact; sensation to LT intact throughout, no saddle anesthesia; [**5-24**] strength in RLE, 5-/5 strength in LLE (?
PULSES: 2+ DPs and PTs b/l NEURO: alert and oriented x3; cranial nerves grossly intact.
Pertinent Results: OSH Labs: INR 1.4 Wbc 12.4, 16% bands H/H 56/16.7 Plt 167 Glucose 132, BUN/cr 22/1.3, NA 133, K 5.3, Trop 0.01 Dig <0.3 .
[**Hospital1 18**] Labs: Notable for: Na 132, K 5.4, bicarb 17, creatinine 1.0, BUN 23 Alk Ph 529, ALT 83, AST 120, Alb 2.9 WBC 11, Hct 52, Plt 156 INR 1.3, PTT 37.5 Troponin neg Lactate 2.0 Uric Acid: 7.3 .
EKG OSH: [**10-3**] at 12:48: Wide complex tachycardia c/w VT at 110 bpm w/ northwest axis.
EKG [**Hospital1 18**] ED [**10-3**] at 16:22: Wide complex tachycardia c/w VT at 105 bpm, northwest axis.
EKG [**Hospital1 18**] MICU [**10-4**] at 12:12AM: Sinus tachycardia at 116 bpm.
OSH CT L-Spine w/o contrast: Mild DJD but no metastases or masses.
CXR [**10-3**]: The heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION: Pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions; prominent right hilus may represent engorged vasculature, but nodular opacities within the lung warrant chest CT after diuresis to assess the nodular opacities and right hilus.
CT Abdomen [**10-3**]: 1.
Correlation with prior imaging and/or consider MRCP.
ECHO [**10-4**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular systolic function is difficult to evaluate due to suboptimal image quality, irregular rhythm and conduction abnormality but overall ejection fraction is probably near normal.
CT Chest [**10-4**]: CONCLUSION: 1.
Pelvic Ultrasound [**10-6**]: IMPRESSION:  2 cm simple-appearing cyst in the left ovary.
Bone Biopsy [**10-10**] (pending):   Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo F w/ h/o AF on rivaroxaban and flecainide, HTN, hypothyroidism, and DM type 2 who presented with leg pain, found to be in slow [**Hospital **] transferred to the CCU for further management.
She then converted to atrial fibrillation with RVR up to 130s.
CT abdomen/[**Last Name (un) 98019**] was concerning for lytic lesion in the right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] and overian mass.
CT chest showed no suspicious lung lesion, mild pulmonary edema with moderate bilateral pleural effusions, multiple mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement was mild and nonspecific.
Left sternal hypodensity could also be related to radiotherapy, and pelvic U/S demonstrated 2 cm simple-appearing cyst in the left ovary.
Her levels began to decline with treatment and was 6.5 prior to discharge.
Uric acid levels should be checked at follow-up and allopurinol discontinued when appropriate.
Transitional Issues: - Cardioversion as an outpatient - Titrate down BB and CCB peri-cardioversion - Needs cardiologist in [**Location (un) 86**], although she spends 6mos/yr in [**State 15946**].
- Check uric acid level - Follow-up Bone biopsy results: [**Hospital1 18**] Pathology Department [**Location (un) 830**] East Building, [**Location (un) 453**] Mail Stop: ES-112 [**Location (un) 86**], [**Numeric Identifier **] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9363**]   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Information was obtained from Patient.
Creon 12 2 CAP PO TID W/MEALS 6.
Creon 12 2 CAP PO TID W/MEALS 3.
You also had a bone biopsy because we were concerned about a cancer that could be growing because of your complaints of fatigue and night sweats.
