male with a history of heavy alcohol abuse, admitted [**8-27**] to [**Hospital 11485**] Hospital with abdominal pain and found to have pancreatitis with lipase 560.
The same day, he was found to have a L lung whiteout on CXR, further evaluated with chest CT which showed a L hilar mass with pleural effusion.
On [**8-29**] the patient was going to have a bronchoscopy, but went into AF with RVR 180, BP 80/40.
On [**8-30**] he had a brochoscopy which showed a mass just below the carina and a complete obstruction of the L mainstem bronchus 2-4 cm below the mass.
Tissue biopsy showed SCC, and patient was transferred to us for possible stenting.
Physical Exam: VS: 98.4, tmax 101.3 at midnight, BP 96/58, HR 84, RR 20, 94% on 2L.
Pertinent Results: Imaging: CT torso [**2199-9-2**] - 1) 3.2x3.9 cm hilar mass with extension into subcarinal area, causing complete collapse of the L lung and a large pleural effusion.
Exact borders of pulmonary mass can't be visualized due to lack of IV contrast, but a rough estimate is given at 7.4 x 7.0 cm.
2) Subcentimeter R middle lobe lung nodule 3) Small R pleural effusion 4) Pancreatic calcifications consistent with chronic pancreatitis 5) Chronic calcifications consisten with splenic granulomas  CT head [**2199-9-2**] - Negative unenhanced head CT.  MRI with gadolinium would be helpful if there is clinical suspicion of metastases.
Bronchoscopy [**2199-9-4**] - 100% obstruction left main bronchus with tumor.

1) Airway:  The patient was seen by interventional pulomonology on arrival, who recommended a CT scan with contrast to stage the carcinoma prior to stenting, as if the patient were low stage he may be a surgical candidate rather than palliative, which is what stenting would accomplish.
Unfortunately, the patient has a prior history of a contrast allergy, therefore we performed the CT scan without contrast.
Post-extubation he was stable, with a HR in the 80s, BP 104/57, RR in the 20s, with 93% saturation on room air.
As far as staging goes, the CT scan performed at our hospital did not have contrast, and therefore is not a great study for evaluating for metastases.
Blood cultures were positive for S. Pneumoniae, with a likely source being post-obstructive pneumonia.
Surveillance blood cultures were drawn on the day of discharge, and are currently pending.
He has been give IVF at 150 cc/hr for the duration of his stay, and did not require any analgesic medication.
His rhythm has been regular the whole time.
5) Anemia:  Mr. [**Known lastname 57786**] is anemic, but his hematocrit has been stable.
Iron studies indicate an anemia of chronic disease, which could also be alcohol related.
