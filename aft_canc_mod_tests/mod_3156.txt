The patient was seen at [**Hospital1 69**] in [**Location (un) 620**] where he was noticed to have decreased movement in the right arm, a temperature of 101.0 F., a heart rate of 123 and a blood pressure of 87/55 with an elevated white count to 19.9.
He had a chest x-ray showing a right lower lobe infiltrate.
He also had a head CT scan done that showed a large left frontal cystic mass with midline shift.
He was evaluated by Neurosurgery upon arrival to [**Hospital1 188**] and they recommended high dose steroids and an MRI for better evaluation of the mass.
He also was noted to have a sodium of 153 at [**Hospital1 69**] in [**Location (un) 620**].
The patient received four liters of normal saline at [**Hospital1 1444**] [**Location (un) 620**] and there was a systolic blood pressure of approximately the mid 90s with some tachycardia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Upon presentation, he had a temperature of 101.0 F.; heart rate of 74; blood pressure of 105/60.
Respirations 72 and saturation of 100% on three liters via nasal cannula.
Cardiovascular:  Heart rate were very faint; regular with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Deep tendon reflexes are difficult to asses.
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count of 22.7, hematocrit of 40.0 with platelets of 344.
Sodium of 158, potassium of 5.80, chloride of 123, bicarbonate of 18.
BUN of 79, creatinine of 3.5.
His liver function tests were normal.
He had a chest x-ray which revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate.
He had a head CT scan which revealed a large right frontal mass with midline shift with no evidence of intracranial bleed.
He was adequately rehydrated with fluid and his blood pressure responded appropriate to normal saline boluses.
The patient's pressures stabilized on day number two and Dopamine blood pressure support was no longer needed.
Neurosurgery felt that the patient should be placed on steroids and have an MRI to evaluate possible surgical options.
Acute Renal Failure:  The patient had a previous creatinine of 1.8.
Neurosurgery discussed the patient's options which included a combination of resection with probable large deficit as an outcome versus lung biopsy for tissue diagnosis and possible chemotherapy versus comfort measures only.
