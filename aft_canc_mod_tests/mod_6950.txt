Previous biopsies:    [**-1/4799**]  Cell block Pleural fluid, C11-[**/0-0-**]  pericardial fluid for cell block  SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:  DIAGNOSIS:       HYPOCELLULAR MARROW WITH SPARSE ERYTHROPOIESIS (SEE NOTE)  Note:  The marrow aspirate is paucicellular and the core biopsy is predominantly subcortical hypocellular marrow spaces.
Deeper levels revealed more evaluable marrow spaces, with sparse erythroid colonies, and absent megakaryocytes.
Red blood cells are hypochromic with anisopoikilocytosis including dacrocytes, elliptocytes and rare schistocytes seen.
The white blood cell count appears decreased.
Differential shows 63% neutrophils, 16% bands, 1% monocytes, 21% lymphocytes.
Aspirate Smear:  The aspirate material is suboptimal for evaluation due to paucity of spicules.
Myeloid precursors appear proportionately increased and show left shifted dyspoietic maturation.
A 400 cell differential shows <1% blasts, 9% promyelocytes, 1% myelocytes, 2% metamyelocytes, 44% bands/neutrophils, 2% plasma cells, 25% lymphocytes, 17% erythroid.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The core biopsy material is inadequate for evaluation   It consists of a 0.6 cm core biopsy of periosteum, trabecular marrow with a cellularity of <5%.
Clinical:   62 y/o female with history of CML, most recently on dasatimib now with persistent pancytopenia.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-10-24**], the left ventricle is now frankly hyperdynamic (including the apex), but the right ventricle now appears severely hypokinetic.

Her drain output was monitored, and once output started decreasing, pericardial drain was pulled.
A TTE was checked after pulling the drain to ensure that the pericardial fluid did not reaccumulate and the patient was monitored on telemetry throughout.
Follow-up TTE revealed LVEF 75% demonstating frank hyperkinesis and severe right ventricle free wall hypokinesis.
Apical akinesis was seen on Echo with depressed EF of 25-30% and takasubos distribution.
Once her pressures were stablized, diuresis was continued; creat was closely trended, as patient was found to have creat bump.
She had normal hemodynamics following and repeat echo showed hyperdynamic LVEF of 75% and severe right ventricular wall hypokinesis on discharge.
The patient had a R thoracentesis done, taking out ~ 700 cc of straw colored fluid.
Throughout the hospital course, the patient's hematocrit, platelets, and white count all trended down.
The granulocyte count reached a nadir at 510 then began to recover.
Bone marrow biopsy showed bone marrow suppression from drug effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitor vs. infection with no evidence of active CML.
On discharge, patient's granulocyte count was close to 1500 and monocytes were at 15% of the differential, signaling bone marrow recovery.
SAH/Brain lesions with edema:  The read on patient's OSH CT head showed that there were possible metastatic brain lesions, as well as SAH s/p fall.
EEG was negative, with no electrographic evidence of seizure seen.
Brain MRI showed findings consistant either with evolving infarct or PRES involving the parieto-occipital region.
C. diff toxin was sent, and came back positive.
This biopsy showed no increased blasts or other marrow invasion.
Eventually improved with diuresis and has since resolved; creatinine down to 0.7 on discharge.
