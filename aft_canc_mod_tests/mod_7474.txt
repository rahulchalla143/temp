On review of systems, the patient reported an approximately 60 pound weight loss over the course of six months from a weight of greater than 200 pounds, with anorexia, diffuse abdominal pain for about four months, and some bright red blood per rectum for approximately two months.
At the outside hospital, head CT showed a multiloculated acute on chronic subdural hematoma, with an INR of 8.3 and a hematocrit of 24.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 2018**] and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for neurological checks, neurosurgical evaluation, and serial head CTs.
PHYSICAL EXAM UPON ADMISSION:  Temperature 100.8, blood pressure 153/53, pulse 84, respirations 16, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
Abdomen - soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, somewhat decreased, guaiac positive, positive retroperitoneal bruising.
Extremity strength 4+-5 throughout and symmetric, deep tendon reflexes 2+ throughout, Babinski downgoing, sensation intact throughout to light touch.
LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION:  CBC with a white blood cell count of 5.6, with a differential of 69 neutrophils, 29.3 lymphocytes, 3 monocytes, 0.8 eosinophils, 1.3 basophils.
Hematocrit 22.0, platelets 85.
Coagulation studies with a PT of 29.2, INR 5.6, PTT 43.
Chem-7 with a sodium of 123, potassium 5.0, chloride 84, BUN 54, creatinine 6.2, glucose 136.
Urinalysis - specific gravity of 1.020, with a small amount of blood, 100 protein, pH 8.5, negative for nitrite and leukocytes.
HEAD CT ON ADMISSION:  A loculated collection, hemorrhage, probably of different ages in the right temporal lobe, asymmetry of the lateral ventricles with mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, effacement with foci in the right and a small amount of midline shift to the left.
HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for neurological checks, neurosurgical evaluation, and serial head CTs.
The subdural hematoma was treated conservatively with decadron to reduce brain edema, rapid correction of the INR with fresh frozen plasma, platelet transfusion to increase the platelets and keep the level above 100,000, DDAVP to correct uremic platelet dysfunction.
Upon presentation, the patient's neurological exam was nonfocal with a question of left-sided neglect.
The patient was monitored with serial head CT scans, receiving a head CT initially twice a day, then once per day, and then once every other day.
All of these scans showed a subdural hemorrhage, stable, from the time of admission.
The patient was also noted on EEG during the admission to have evidence of epileptiform activity.
Early on the morning after transferring to the neurological service, the patient became again agitated, tachypneic, with oxygen saturations down to the 70s on 100% oxygen via nonrebreather.
The corresponding ABG at that time was a pH of 7.26, PCO2 47, O2 55.
With dialysis and careful monitoring of volume status, the patient improved and was extubated for the second time on hospital day #5.
4) CARDIAC:  Following the episode of respiratory failure, cardiac enzyme levels were obtained, and the patient was observed to have a small increase in troponin levels.
The patient's blood pressure and rate were controlled with diltiazem.
5) INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  After admission to the MICU for the second time, the patient was noted to have an infiltrate on chest x-ray which was thought to be consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.
Blood cultures were obtained in addition to the urine culture, both of which came back positive for streptococcal bovis.
A TTE showed no evidence of vegetations, but a TEE was declined due to inability to visualize the upper GI tract and concern for bleeding with a history of black emesis.
As noted above, this in combination with weight loss, abdominal pain, streptococcal bovis bacteremia, and urinary tract infection raised concern for the possibility of a gastrointestinal source such as a colonic malignancy.
It was determined that the patient would need a colonoscopy to evaluate the lower GI tract, in addition to an EGD if colonoscopy was negative.
Due to concern for risk of bleeding, these studies were not performed as an inpatient.
Thyroid function tests were obtained prior to discharge.
It was recommended that the thyroid function tests be followed up as an outpatient.
In addition, due to the patient being maintained on dexamethasone, finger stick blood sugars were obtained daily, and the patient was on regular insulin sliding scale.
It was planned for the patient to have a repeat head CT scan two weeks after discharge.
If that head CT showed no progression of the subdural hematoma or new bleed, then anticoagulation with Coumadin could be restarted two weeks later.
The patient's Thalidomide was held due to procoagulant risk.
11) FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  Due to risk of aspiration, a swallowing study was obtained after the patient was transferred to the floor on hospital day #5.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1) Ceftriaxone 1 gm qd for 26 more days (total course of 4 weeks), 2) diltiazem 60 mg tid, 3) pantoprazole 40 mg qd, 4) aspirin 325 mg qd, 5) levothyroxine 25 mcg qd, 6) dexamethasone 2 mg qd for 2 weeks, to be continued until after repeat head CT in 2 weeks, at that point a neurologist should be contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding tapering the dexamethasone, 7) phenytoin 150 mg q am, 200 mg q pm, 8) calcium carbonate 1,000 mg qd, 9) albuterol/ipratropium 103-18 mcg aerosol 1-2 puffs inhalation q 4-6 h prn shortness of breath or wheezing.
Any change (such as focal signs, increased somnolence) should prompt a repeat head CT to rule out repeat bleed or increased edema from nontolerance of dexamethasone tapering.
If the patient is stable, a repeat head CT should be obtained in two weeks.
