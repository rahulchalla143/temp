A CT neck was obtained that showed mass around sternal notch is larger but not impinging on airway.
Labs were significant for Hct 33 (at or higher than previous baseline), WBC 2.3, Lactate 1.4.
Blood and urine cultures were sent.
VS on transfer were: 98.7, 82,129/73, 20, 100% 2L.
His odynophagea remains as it was in the morning.

CXR [**7-26**]: Superior mediastinum somewhat obscured by a known partially cystic mass as better delineated on current CT examination of neck.

Active Diagnoses: # Respiratory Distress: On admission, the patient endorses a subjective sense of SOB, but O2 sat is 100% RA and respiratory rate is normal.
He has hx of invasive SCC overlying manubrium, but by CT tumor is not impinging on trachea.
Patient's Hct at presentation was 33, above his baseline (~30), which is low likely [**1-2**] chemo.
He received 1 unit pRBCs on [**7-24**] for sxs of fatigue with bump from 26.8 to 33.0.
His hct trended down to 28 by discharge, but this was not felt to be significant enough of a decrease to treat.
WBC 2.3, ANC 1541 on presentation, so patient was not neutropenic.
