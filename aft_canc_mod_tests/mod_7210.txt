Bedside TTE demonstrated a moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade and pulsus was difficult to obtain secondary to tachycardia.
CXR demonstrated a right-sided pleural effusion.
His VS at the time of transfer were P 184, BP 98/83, 27, 98% on 3L.
Past Medical History: - epilepsy and nonelectrographic seizures (petite mal with rare secondary generalization) - s/p right temporal lobectomy - s/p VNS placement - Mood disorder and likely borderline personality organization - Multiple suicide attempts in past (largely overdose) - DM due to medication, now apparently resolved - cervical strain - Rosacea - [**Last Name (un) 865**] esophagus - Polysubstance abuse: EtOH, MJ, cocaine/crack binges with resultant unsafe sexual practices - h/o atrial fibrillation (not on medication)  Social History: Unemployed, lives alone.
Smokes 1pk/day, occasional ETOH and OMR records indicate some history of Crack Cocaine use.
pulsus of 16 Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly  Pertinent Results: ECHO [**2-17**]: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
When compared to prior study ( images reviewed) from [**2196-2-2**], the effusion is now larger.
ECHO [**2-18**]: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-2-17**], the size of the pericardial effusion remains moderate, but has decreased minimally in size from 1.5 centimeters to 1.4 centimeters in greatest dimension.

Tox screen negative except for ASA 4.1.
Pericardial Effusion: moderate size on echo in ED but no evidence of tamponade.
Chest xray shows R sided pleural effusion, new when compared to xray at discharge 10 days prior to admission.
