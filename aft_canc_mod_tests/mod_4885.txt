Cardiac enzymes were negative.
CHADS score was 3. .
Repeat CT of abdomen showed stable RP bleed, heparin drip was stopped and started enoxaparin dosed for renal function.
# Retroperitoneal hemorrhage: Stable by follow up CT on [**2120-9-17**].
Infectious work up was negative including clean UA, negative blood and urine cultures and unremarkable CXR.
Received vanc and zosyn in ED, but further abx were held and WBC WNL at discharge.
Plan was for initiation of Sunitinib after completion of total brain irradiation as pt not a candidate for IL2 therapy given brain mets and risk of edema.
# Anemia: Baseline hct of 36, and pt is at baseline.
