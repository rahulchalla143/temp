The EEG showed some slowness.
The MRI revealed a left parietal brain tumor.
Deltoids to the right and biceps are full, whereas triceps and wrist extension is 4+/5.
Finger intrinsics are very weak at 3/5.
Her PE varies greatly due to issues with execution due to damage to her pre-motor area.
Pertinent Results: Brain MRI [**2109-4-29**]: 1.
Please see additional details on prior complete MR study done on [**2109-4-8**].
This is unchanged compared to the prior study of [**2109-4-8**].
CT head [**2109-4-29**]: Expected post-surgical changes s/p left extraaxial mass resection, including a small amount of hemorrhage in the surgical bed.
MRI brain [**2109-4-30**]: Status post recent left frontal/parietal craniotomy for resection of left parasagittal probable presumed meningioma with expected postoperative changes.
CXR [**2109-5-1**] Interval increase in overall cardiac silhouette is noted, currently mild cardiomegaly.
Note is made that there are multiple external devices overlying the chest that preclude precise evaluation and subtle lesions may be overlooked  CT head [**5-2**] 1.
Her post operative Hct was 34.
Her exam improved.
MRI read showed gross total resection of tumor with residual hyperdensity within the falx.
A repeat head CT was ordered for increase RLE weakness on examination which demonstrated post operative changes with mild edema but no evidence of infarct or new hemorrhages.
Her PE varies greatly due to issues with execution due to damage to her pre-motor area.

?You will need a CT scan of the brain ?????
?You will not need an MRI of the brain with/ or without gadolinium contrast.
