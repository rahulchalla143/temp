History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 39760**] is a 76 y/o F with history of autoimmune hepatitis, diastolic CHF, hypertension, T2DM, as well as abdominal B cell lymphoma, diagnosed after recent onset of abdominal pain.
She initially presented to NEBH ambulatory care [**2114-12-5**] for mild abdominal pain, where, abdominal exam reportedly was notable for a palpable mass.
Labs that day were notable for hematocrit 30.5 (baseline 37-39) calcium of 13.1 (albumin 3.5), creatinine 1.8 (baseline 1.2-1.5), and BNP 333. .
She underwent abdominal/pelvis CT scan, which revealed a large soft tissue density surrounding the cecum and ascending colon with significant stranding, initially believed to be a phlegmon possibly [**1-23**] appendicitis or appendiceal rupture.
CT also showed a smaller, similar phlegmon anterior to the transverse colon.
CT Chest was negative for malignancy.
As above, CT chest was negative for malignant involvement.
On day of transfer, her calcium was 9.8 with albumin of 2.2, suggesting mild hypercalcemia.
She underwent TTE on [**12-13**] that was reportedly not consistent with dCHF.
NEBH d/c summary reports today's exam notable for no fevers, mild hypotension with systolic BPs in the 90s, regular heart rhythm with rate in the 80s, and normal oxygen saturation.
Labs today were notable for stable CBC, INR 1.3, creatinine 1.5, and LDH 648.
D/c summary also indicated that today's CXR was unchanged, showing poor inspiratory effort, prominent hila, basilar atelectasis bilaterally but no significant change from prior chest x-rays.
-Hypertension treated with metoprolol and Lasix -osteoarthritis -sleep apnea -diabetes mellitus insulin-dependent, treated with Novolin and regular insulin -COPD -possible pulmonary hypertension (This was not borne out by a recent echocardiogram which although technically difficult, did not show evidence, doppler or otherwise of diastolic dysfunction) -hiatal hernia treated with Nexium -multiple allergies with intermittent use of Zyrtec -hyperuricemia treated with urolic -possible history of CHF, which has been treated with Lasix -headaches treated with Fioricet.

Note: FISH studies were not performed because assessment of the specimen by Pathology showed no evidence of lymphoma.
Pathology Slides ([**2115-12-20**]): DIAGNOSIS: HIGH-GRADE B-CELL LYMPHOMA, DIFFUSE LARGE B CELL TYPE, SEE NOTE.
ECHO ([**2115-12-19**]): Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).

Tumor lysis labs were followed q8hours without issue, and bicarb D5W 75 cc/hr was also given with allopurinol.
Echo revealed mild diastolic CHF.
# Febrile Neutropenia: During pts count nadir from above CHOP, pt developed fevers.
Fevers went away after 48hrs and all culture data was negative.
Abx were stopped after counts recovered so that pt no longer neutropenic.
With initiation of chemo and accompanying steroids, pt had blood sugars very difficult to control into 300s routinely with just ISS coveage.
Once TPN started, insulin was placed in TPN but sugars still high so started on NPH and uptitrated to 8u am / 8u pm with resulting sugars in mid 100s with 45 units regular insulin in TPN.
Two seroma collections opened up and drained serious fluid.
