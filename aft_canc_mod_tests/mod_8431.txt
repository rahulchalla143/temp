Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the Rectal ulcer.
Given hypotension in the ED, she was admitted to the MICU for frequent BP and hct checks.
Hct initially 30, then drifted down to 26 within the first the first day, so transfused 1 unit PRBCs.
Her hematocrit remained stable at that point.
Pt responded well to limited fluid boluses, and a blood transfusion, and maintained her SBP >100 after coming to the ICU.
Colonoscopy showed multiple diverticuli and a rectal ulcer, both of which were possible sources of her bleeding.
She was monitored overnight after her procedure in case of bleeding from the biopsy sites, however she did not experience and further bleeding.
Hematocrit was stable at 30.8 on discharge.
She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] later this month in clinic for follow up of biopsy results and repeat colonoscopy for polyp removal.
# Sterile pyuria: +UA on admission, however urine culture negative and patient asymptomatic.
TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: - Please check complete blood count on [**2136-3-2**] given recent colonoscopy and biopsies.
- Rectal ulcer: biopsy results pending at time of discharge, will follow up with GI in clinic on [**2136-3-21**] - Colon polyps:  needs to have polyps removed at repeat colonoscopy, as these could  not be removed this time.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check complete blood count on [**2136-3-2**].
A colonoscopy was done and showed diverticuli (small benign outpouchings) and a rectal ulcer, which was sent for biopsies.
