A CT scan showed early signs of infarction, particularly intracortex, and he is transferred here for further management.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination upon admission, temperature 97.2 degrees, pulse 84 and regular, blood pressure 142/78, respiratory rate 14.
Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.

Reflexes, his deep tendon reflexes are all present and slightly increased in the right upper extremity.
Non-contrast head CT shows massive cortical distinction in the left intracortex.

Sodium 136, potassium 4.5, chloride 102, bicarbonate 23, glucose 141, BUN 30, creatinine 1.3, calcium 8.5, magnesium 1.8, phosphate 1.9, CK 329.
Labs at [**Hospital1 69**] showed white count 11.1, hematocrit 32.2, platelets 273, AST 24, ALT 36, alkaline phosphatase 38, total bilirubin 0.6, albumin 2.5, CK 346.
