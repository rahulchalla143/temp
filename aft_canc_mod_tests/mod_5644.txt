IMPRESSION: Limited study secondary to patient rotation.
Plain films were done and did not show any evidence of osteomyelitis, emphysema, or effusion.
His elevated troponin in the setting of ESRD and hypotension was thought to be from demand rather than ACS, as his CK enzymes were flat and his EKG did not have any ST changes suggestive of ischemia.
An echo was ordered to assess for any wall motion abnormalities and it was planned to obtain his medical record from the VA to better understand his cardiac history.
The need for the IVF, antibiotics, and possible pressors was explained to the patient multiple times.
An autopsy was offered and declined.
