She was admitted to computerized tomography scan on [**11-21**] for rigid bronchoscopy.
The stent was removed and a biopsy was done around the site to rule out recurrent cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial examination prior to transfer to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit she was sedated but reactive in no acute distress.
Her vital signs revealed temperature of 98.9?????
?, heartrate of 108, respiratory rate of 12, and blood pressure 92/61 with an oxygen saturation of 98%.
LABORATORY DATA:  Significant laboratory data reveals an admission white blood cell count of 11.9, hematocrit 30.9, and platelets 522.
Chem-7 revealed a sodium of 143, potassium 4.2, chloride 106, bicarbonate 26, BUN 20, creatinine 0.8.
Her arterial blood gases immediately prior to intubation was 7.23/66/64.
Bronchial washings from her initial rigid bronchoscopy showed 3+ polymorphonucleocytes and 4+ gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters with heavy growth of Staphylococcus aureus.
She underwent bronchoscopy on at least a couple of occasions to verify that secretions were adequate and there was no mucous plugging or other explanation for why she might be failing extubation, weaning.
These studies revealed no clear reason for why she should be having difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
From a cardiovascular perspective her cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule out the possibility of myocardial infarction.
Nevertheless, chest computerized tomography scan was obtained with angiography to rule out pulmonary embolus.
The study was also negative.
However, the hematocrit was low and the patient was transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells.
From an oncological perspective biopsies done at the time of her bronchoscopy ultimately showed poorly differentiated nonsmall cell carcinoma.
