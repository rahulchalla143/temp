they feel that since pt 3 days from diagnosis of bleed and stable both clinically and imaging that pt can be on the oncology floor.
- INR goal 1.3 or below.
-Systolic blood pressure to maintain below 140. .
-start metoprolol 25 mg po bid and will monitor pulse and BP closely.
Post op head CT revealed post operative changes and pneumocephalus therefore she was placed on a non-rebreather.
On [**10-7**] she was neurologically stable therefore her neuro checks were changed to Q and SBP was liberalized to 160.
A lower extremity US on [**2104-10-8**] showed no evidence of DVT.
