The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-12-6**], left ventricular function is now impaired.
Abd ultrasound RUQ IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2172-2-6**] Small bilateral effusions are present.
BPs were stable [**Month/Day/Year **], but did drop into the 80s systolic, and he was asympotmatic.
He was also started on a heparin gtt [**Month/Day/Year **], he had a hx of being on coumadin in the past, but it was stopped due to hx of falls and hx of hospital admission with INR of 18.

Urine lytes showed FeUrea <35%, consistent with prerenal.
Before transfer to the floor he began autodiuesing, and his creatine improved from peak of 3.9 to 1.1 at discharge.
Renal ultrasound was normal.
# systolic Heart failure: EF of 30% on echo.
Plts 86 at discharge and stable since [**2172-2-7**] (were 118 on admission).
Hepatitis viral studies sent and were negative.
Liver enzymes were trending down at discharge.
Will need period rechecking to monitor LDH after discharge since pt has hx of burketts lymphoma.
