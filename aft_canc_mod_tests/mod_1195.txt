He went to his PCP's office today for evaluation and was found to be in rapid afib with HR in the 120s-130s.
His PCP did an EKG which confirmed rapid afib, frequent ectopy, and new ST depressions.
In the ED, his VS were T 97.5, BP 134/37, HR 124, RR 30, sats 93% on RA and 96% on 3L.
He was given IVF to improve his BP after the diltiazem.
He was also given 30mg PO diltiazem to attempt to keep his rate under control.
CXR was performed which revealed slightly worsening pulmonary edema and loss of the R heart border, concerning for fluid vs. consolidation.
On arrival to the floor, his HR was in the 110s and his O2 sat was 89% on 5L by nc.
Approximately 1-2 hours after arrival, his sats began to drop to the low 80s on 5L by nc.
His O2 sats were difficult to monitor given his frequent ectopy, so he was put on a face mask with 10L O2.
An ABG was performed which was 7.45/33/59, with a lactate of 1.4.
Repeat cardiac enzymes were sent.
His BP remained in the low 100s and his HR came down to the 90s transiently.
Repeat CXR showed worsening pulmonary edema, but no frank infiltrate.
On arrival to CCU his BP was 100/60, HR 100-115, RR 30, Pox 95% on NRB.
His BP dropped to 87/65.
He was r/o by three sets, a CXR was normal and his CP was thought to be related to anxiety.
His TSH was slighlty elevated but there was concern over med complicane so his prior dose was resumed.

cycled enzymes which were negative.
Mr. [**Known lastname 13318**] had a h/o tachy-brady and possible atrial tachycardia versus flutter in old notes.
A repeat echo showed significantly worse cardiac function with an EF of approximately 10%.
