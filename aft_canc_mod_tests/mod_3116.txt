Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
AML - Pt had a TTE on admission that showed and EF of 75%.
She did occasionally require supplemental oxygen for an oxygen saturation in the low 90's in the first three days.
[**1-2**], the patient complained that the stiches on her chest from the central line were itchy and painful.
CXR showed no pneumonia.
[**1-5**] the patient had a temp of 103.3 and complained of chills, sore throat, and diarrhea.
Stool studies were sent for C. diff and found to be (+).
CXR showed new lateral LLL opacity, infiltrate vs. volume loss.
A CT scan of the chest was obtained that showed scarring from prior ARDS but no new pulmonary pathology.
CXR at the time showed pulmonary edema c/w CHF.
Pt enzymes showed CK 66 > 71 > 46 w/ troponin .05 > .22.
It was thought that the patient could not tolerate the tachycardia associated with her fevers which sent her into CHF.
[**1-9**] pt had a TTE that showed EF 45% w/ distal wall hypokinesis new from admission.
Repeat TTE on [**1-12**] showed no improvement from [**1-9**] TTE.
ANC at discharge was 470.
Cardiotoxicity from mitoxantrone is possible per cardiology though she should undergo stress testing as an outpatient.
Repeat echo prior to discharge was of suboptimal quality, but showed restroration of original LVEF and no WMA.
The aberrant echo may have represented changes related to her MI however typically ischemia causes transient diastolic dysfunction that rapidly resolves with restoration of blood flow.
