+ urinary frequency, which the patient attributes to lasix - fevers, chills, nightsweats, headache, diplopia, paresthesias -sore throat, cough, shortness of breath - chest pain, palpitations, orthopnea - dysuria, hematuria, foul smelling urine .
- Originally presented in [**2131-12-17**]: elevated white blood cell count of 24,000 and a monoclonal IgG kappa paraproteinemia.
Flow cytometry studies revealed findings consistent with CLL.
- Early [**2136**], WBC levels started to rise and presumably she had either symptoms or cytopenias.
Her WBC count subsequently decreased to 72,000 - WBC 200,000 by [**2138-5-17**].
Torso CT at [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2138-6-26**] showed progressive upper abdominal and mesenteric adenopathy and splenomegaly.
A bone [**Date Range 15482**] done on [**2138-7-16**] showed a monoclonal kappa B-cell population co-expressing CD5 and CD23 per flow cytometry.
- Repeat CT on [**2139-4-8**] which showed interval enlargement of her axillary, retroperitoneal, periaortic, mesenteric, and iliac adenopathy and a diffusely enlarged spleen.
- Dyspneic with significant hepatosplenomegaly and a white count of 424K.
Received 2 cycles of R-[**Hospital1 **] and white count declined from 424K down to a low of 70K as well as reduction in the size of her organomegaly.
But again increase in her white count and size of her spleen, therefore she was started on a regimen of Campath which correlated with fever, cough, and a large hematoma at the injection site.
- [**2139-9-17**] had CT demonstrating pancolitis and proctitis.
Rituxan 375 mg/m2 on [**9-30**].
Flow on her CSF revealed atypical lymphocytes highly suspicious for CNS involvement by her known CLL.
