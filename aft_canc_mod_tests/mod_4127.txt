[**2102-5-8**] ABdominal CT Scan: (1) New 15 x 8cm fluid collection at the inferior aspect of the afferent loop,  consistent with anastomotic breakdown.
6) Bilateral simple renal cysts, many of which are too small to characterize.
Mild residual within the  vallecula and piriform sinuses, which was cleared after several attempts.
Please see speech pathologist report for a more complete account  [**2102-5-18**] Abdomninal CT Scan : 1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
His transfusion requirements continued to increase and his abdomen became more distended and he was taken to the OR on [**2102-4-21**] for abdominal washout and control of bleeding from his anastamosis (please see the operative note of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 468**] for full details).
His platelets gradually dropped and an HIT panel was sent which was negative; this was assessed as being secondary to consumption coagulopathy.
On [**2102-5-8**] the patient had an abdominal CT scan which revealed a small fluid collection near the anastamosis.
This was drained by interventional radiology on [**2102-5-10**] and a pigtail catheter was left in place; cultures from this fluid collection were negative.
The patient failed a bedside speech and swallow evaluation on [**2102-5-11**] and was continued on tube feeding.
His trach was downsized to a #7 portex with a Passe-Muir valve on [**2102-5-16**] and a video swallow evaluation on [**2102-5-17**] was passed, with a regular diet started in addition to tube feeding.
On [**2102-5-18**] the patient was stable in appearance but was transferred to the ICU with a significant elevation in his WBC count and guaic positive stools with a drop in his hematocrit.
Colonoscopy and EGD evaluation revealed no obvious bleeding source.
Pan-cultures revealed no obvious source for the patient's WBC count but he was started on empiric treatment for presumed C-Diff colitis.
His white count gradually declined and he was transferred back to the floor after several days.
He did, however, have a fever to 102 on [**2102-5-24**] and work-up this time revealed Pseudomonas in his urine and Klebsiella in his blood.
Infectious Disease consulation was obtained and he was started on Levoquin for treatment and follow-up urine cultures were negative and he remained afebrile.
