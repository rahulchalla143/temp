[**6-18**] CT Abdomen and Pelvis INDICATION: Elevated white blood cell count and crampy abdominal pain.
TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following the administration of 130 cc of intravenous Optiray contrast.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, distal ureters, uterus are unremarkable.
Further evaluation with a dedicated CTA and MRCP of the pancreas is recommended.
CXR [**6-18**] IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
MRCP [**6-21**] /[**2178**] Final Report  FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates normal signal intensity throughout without evidence of focal lesions.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reconstructions and subtraction images were essential in demonstrating the above findings (series 199-200).
No evidence of obstructing pancreatic mass, however, evaluation is limited due to motion artifact.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 83 yo woman with a PMH of Afib on Coumadin, HTN, and hypercholesterolemia, recent hospital admission w/ antibiotics, who presented with lower abdominal sharp cramps x 1 day, diarrhea, and an INR of 7 at an outside facility now with fever, a white count of 21, and HCT drop of 10 points to 25.
Stool studies showed c diff positive with the other cultures negative.
CT of the abdomen was consistent with sigmoid colitis.
Her abdominal pain/cramps ceased during the admission.
WBC was initially 21.9 and improved to 12 at discharge.
Will need INR on [**6-25**].
continued metoprolol, lisinopril, and held off on standing Lasix due to diarrhea.
# Acute renal failure- Her creatinine remained stable during the admission around 1, however it increased to 1.4 on the last day of admission.
Her diarrhea was improving being less frequent and less watery.
We gave her a 500cc bolus spaced over 3-4 hours and her creatinine was rechecked at 3PM before discharge.
# Pancreatic abnormalities on CT- CT Abdomen on [**6-18**] showed pancreatic duct dilatation and atrophy within the tail with an abrupt termination in duct dilatation in the mid-pancreatic body.
She underwent follow up MRCP which showed two sites of likely IPMN, combined main and side branch type, within the distal body and tail of the pancreas as well as within the uncinate process.
No abnormal enhancing nodularity is seen within the lesions and no evidence of obstructing pancreatic mass, however, evaluation is limited due to motion artifact.
Outstanding Issues- -Oral Flagyl 500mg TID for 14 more days from [**2179-6-23**] -She will need a follow up MRCP scan for a possible pancreatic mass in 6 months.
Glucosamine Oral 13.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Calcium Carbonate 500 mg/5 mL (1,250 mg/5 mL) Suspension Sig: One (1)  PO TID (3 times a day).
Supratherapeutic INR 4.
Your blood counts were low.
You underwent an MRCP of your pancreas which showed a pancreatic abnormality that needs to be reevaluated in 6 months with another MRI.
-Miconazole cream was started for a skin rash.
