On follow-up colonoscopy, this area had degenerated into a carcinoma which was not amenable to endoscopic resection.
Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose & Throat were normal.
LABORATORY:  Admission labs were hematocrit 40.
He was closely monitored with the CIWA Scale on the floor.
Hematocrit was 32.3 and electrolytes were normal.
Creatinine level noted to be somewhat elevated.
After some resuscitation, the patient underwent a CT scan which showed no evidence of extravasation of contrast.
He underwent an exploration of the right lower extremity and right femoral embolectomy and fasciotomy to the lower leg due to a poor blood flow.
He then became more unstable and a CT scan was performed, which showed a pelvic abscess consistent with an anastomotic leak.
Because of persistent septic picture and the inability to keep his blood pressure up despite maximum resuscitation, the patient was made comfort measures and allowed to expire.
