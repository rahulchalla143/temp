She notes that she felt some left chest cramping last week; however, the pain did not become severe until [**2173-11-26**].
Upon presentation to the ED vitals were T 98.8, HR 96, BP 138/83, RR 16, O2Sats 100% RA.
EKG was without wigns of right heart strain.
Troponin was negative at <0.01.
Vitals prior to transfer to the ICU were T 98.4, HR 92, BP 119, RR 28, 100%/4L NC.

Filling defects within the left upper lobe segmental arteries (2, 19), lingula (2, 24), and left lower lobe (2, 36) segmental arteries are also identified.
[**2173-11-29**] Transthoracic Echo The left atrium is elongated.
She was transfused 1U overnight from [**Date range (1) 52935**] and her Hct responded appropriately.
Hct was 27.2 upon transfer out of the ICU.
On HD#6, her hematocrit trended down to 25 and she was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells as the goal was to keep her hematrocrit >25.
Her hematocrit showed an appropriate rise to 29.9 and it remained stable after that time and she did not require any additional blood products.
A Lovenox bridge was chosen at the recommedation of the Heme-Onc service.
She was discharged on 10mg of Coumadin and her INR was 1.8.
She was instructed to continue the Lovenox at home until she was therapeutic on Coumadin (with a goal INR of [**1-19**]).
Her 02 sat remained at 100% on RA.
She was started on Gentamyacin and Clindamycin on HD 7 but her fevers continued despite antibiotic therapy.
Several sets of blood cultures were drawn but showed no growth.
A urine analysis was initally negative but on HD11 the urine culture grew Gardnerella and she was started on flagyl 500 twice daily to be continued for 7 days.
They recommeded an MRV of the pelvis to rule out septic pelvic thrombophlebitis, repeat blood cultures, and a CT of the chest to rule out lung abscess.
All these tests were done but all were negative.
The CT demonstrated no abscess.
A pelvic MRV/MRI did not demonstate septic pelvic thrombophlebitis but did show non-enhancing fibroids--consistent with the diagnosis of fibroid degeneration as an etiology for her fever.
The blood cultures were again negative.
Her pelvic pain, also attributed to degenerating fibroids, was poorly controlled on percocet alone.
Her 02 sats were 100% on room air.
