She was found on admission to have a new LLL infiltrate on CT and CXR and a mild lactic acidosis.
Her blood pressure in the ED was initially as low as a systolic in the 60's.
Sputum sample from [**2147-7-23**] grew out pan-sensitive Serratia and 2 strains of Pseudomonas, for which she was started on a 3-week course of inhaled tobramycin and ciprofloxacin that completed on [**8-11**].
Blood and urine cultures taken at the time of admission were negative.
All repeat sputum cultures have been negative.
ARF: On admission, the patient was noted to have an elevated creatinine of 3.2 with concurrent hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia.
On admission, the worsening from this baseline was thought to be due to acute renal failure from hypotension; her creatinine improved with IV hydration to 1.3.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION: The patient was found on [**2147-8-5**] to have a positive UA and urine culture with 10-100,000 colonies of E. Coli sensitive to Zosyn, meropenem, and imipenem.
METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: The patient was noted to have a persistently decreased serum bicarbonate and a blood gas consistent with a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.
Urine electrolytes were consistent with renal loss of bicarbonate.
Workup during this hospitalization has included blood, urine, and sputum cultures, chest radiographs, abdominal CT scans, and a diagnostic paracentesis.
An abdominal paracentesis on [**2147-8-10**] shows a WBC count of 3000 cells per microliter without any organisms on gram stain.
On discharge, her ventilation is stable on assist control with a tidal volumes of 440, a rate of 20, an FiO2 of 30%, and a PEEP of 10.
G-J TUBE:  Two days prior to her admission, the patient's G-tube fell out and was replaced with a Foley catheter.
She underwent an abdominal/pelvic CT scan and it showed no signs of intraabdominal pathology.
She underwent a filling study of her G-tube by CT scan; extravasation of contrast into the subcutaneous tissues around the entry site was noted.
Her lactic acidosis, however, did not clear as her clinical presentation improved.
Analysis of her peritoneal fluid revealed a SAAG > 1.1 with 1400 PMNs.
Gram stain of her peritoneal fluid showed 1+ PMNs with no organisms.
Samples were sent for bacterial and mycobacterial culture.
At the time of discharge, cultures are still pending.
If a pathogen is discovered on culture and a change in treatment is needed, the [**Hospital 4487**] hospital will be informed.
The tachycardia has not seemed to correlate with her blood pressure and is not responsive to fluid administration.
Echocardiogram on [**2147-7-26**] showed improvement of her global left ventricular systolic function from a prior study in [**Month (only) **], but worsening of her mitral regurgitation and pulmonary artery hypertension.
No further workup was pursued.
MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROME: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia and anemia and is transfusion dependent for platelets and red blood cells.
During this hospitalization, she received numerous blood products for transfusion goals of platelets greater than 10 and hematocrit greater than 21.
Her outstanding acid fast bacteria cultures, including blood, sputum, and peritoneal fluid, will be followed by the patient's PCP.
Ultrasound of her right arm was negative for DVT.
POSSIBLE SPLENIC INFARCTION: Patient has had two abdominal CTs and an abdominal ultrasound that have shown changes consistent in her spleen consistent with infarction.
Medications on Admission: Current Meds: Lansoprazole 30 mg PO DAILY Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol 1-2 Puffs Q6H as needed Ipratropium Bromide 17 mcg/Actuation 2 Puff Inhalation QID Insulin QID per sliding scale Insulin Glargine 7 units Subcutaneous at bedtime Isoniazid 300 mg PO DAILY Pyrazinamide 500 mg PO DAILY Pyridoxine 50 mg PO DAILY Sucralfate 1 g PO QID Ethambutol 400 mg 3tbl PO Q36H Nystatin S+S Acetaminophen 160 mg/5 mL Solution [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] PO Q6H Lactulose 10 g/15 mL 30ml PO Q8H as needed for constipation.
Followup Instructions: Need to follow-up: - urine metanephrines - Cdiff toxin B - cultures of peritoneal fluid [**Month (only) 116**] need reimaging of peritoneal cavity depending on what grows from peritoneal fluid culture
