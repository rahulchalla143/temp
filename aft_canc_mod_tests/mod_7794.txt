He recently underwent TTE evaluation of his exercise intolerance, at which point a relatively large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology was seen.
He was admitted to the CCU [**9-2**]- [**9-6**] and underwent pericardiocentesis, which revealed malignant cells.
He was found to be anemic to 25 and subsequently was brought to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] for blood transfusion.
Received 20mg IV lasix and underwent BiPAP trial, which was poorly tolerated.
A bedside echo was done which showed no pericardial effusion per the ED read.
VS prior to transfer were 97.9 108 150/80 36 99/4L.
CV: tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly.

ACUTE HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: --PNEUMONIA and ACUTE SYSTOLIC CHF: He developed acute shortness of breath early into his blood transfusion which he was receiving for anemia.
Transfusion reaction/TRALI was initially suspected though he lacked severe pulmonary edema or hypoxia to support this diagnosis.
His CXR showed mild edema and RLL haziness.
He had a trop of 1.00 on admission with flat CK/MB, but new LAD-distributed TWI on EKG, and new onset systolic dysfunction with EF to 40-45% on TTE (new since last month).
A cardiac event could have potentially caused his deterioration and CHF exacerbation.
Pneumonia was possible based on his RLL infiltrate, and he was treated for HCAP with vanco/cefepime/levaquin.
Sputum culture revealed commensal resp flora and sparse GNR.
His steroids were discontinued on [**2132-10-13**] as the etiology of his SOB was thought to be related to pulmonary edema and a possible pneumonia rather than a COPD exacerbation.
His vancomycin was discontinued based on sputum data and cefepime and levaquin were continued until further speciation was available.
He was discharged home with home PT services, home 02, and cardiac telemonitoring.
TTE revealed new onset systolic dysfunction with EF 45-50%.
Cardiology was consulted, who felt that the chemotherapy (taxol/cisplatin) is not likely to blame and that he had a recent MI.
Based on EKG and echo data, there was a possible partial occlusion in the LAD and that the patient may benefit from elective cathetrization.
An EKG was essentially unchanged and troponins showed a continued downward trend.
ANEMIA: HCT to 25 of unclear source, though inflammatory disease from malignancy  or myelosupression from chemo are both possible.
Based on his new diagnosis of CHF, lisinopril was restarted at a dose of 10 mg QAM; his blood pressures remained stable with systolics greater than 110 while in house.
You were admitted to the medical ICU after presenting to the emergency department for acute onset shortness of breath during a blood transfusion.
A chest xray showed possible signs of a pneumomia and you were started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Laboratory results and an EKG suggested that you may have had a heart attack prior to the hospitalization.
An echo cardiogram showed that you had a new onset of congestive heart failure (CHF).
We followed your blood counts throughout your stay and it was not deemed necessary to transfuse additional blood at this time.
You should keep your oxygen saturation bewteen 88-92% and should use 3L of oxygen when active.
You will also have cardiac telemonitoring to assist with monitoring your daily weights and blood pressures.
