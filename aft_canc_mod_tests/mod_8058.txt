Initial GCS 8.
BPs 150/80, 188/98, 184/86.
Initial exam revealed patient unresponsive, pupils pinpoint and nonreactive, withdraws from pain on L side only.
[] MSK - bilateral total hip replacements, s/p thigh/hip abscess/infx requiring IV abx ~ 18 months ago  Social History: lives with husband.
R tricep 4, finger ext 5-, finger flex 5 L tri, finger ext/flex 5  Bilateral IPs, ham, TA, [**Last Name (un) 938**], gastroc at least 3.
DTR: brisk and 2+ in bilateral [**Hospital1 **], tri, brachiorad, patellar, achilles.
___________________________________________________________ At Discharge:   Pertinent Results: [**2177-8-27**] CT/CTA Head - CT Head: Little change in bihemispheric subarachonoid hemorrhage and large amount of intraventricular hemorrhage compared to 9 hours prior.
[**2177-8-28**] CT/CTA Head - IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2177-8-28**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Emphysema with concomitant pulmonary edema and two discrete basal opacities which are suspicious for aspiration.
[**2177-8-29**] TTE - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
[**2177-8-29**] NCHCT - 1.
[**2177-9-3**] MRI/MRA Brain - IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2177-9-4**] EEG - (preliminary) no epileptiform activity, diffuse theta-delta slowing, severe diffuse encephalopathic pattern   Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo W h/o CAD, HTN, HL, history of essential thrombocythemia which may have evolved into a Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] (JAK2+), tobacco use p/w up to 10 hours of depressed level of awareness and R hemiparesis with spontaneous improvement and found to have IVH and very mild SAH due to hemorrhage leaking out from the foramen Lushkae into the [**Female First Name (un) **].
When she arrived at an outside hospital, her exam was very poor: she was nonresponsive, her pupils were described as pinpoint, and she was only minimally withdrawing on the left side.
Based on her poor exam and large amount of IVH on CT, the OSH physicians predicted a poor prognosis and the husband decided to change her code status from DNR to CMO, but her mental status spontaneously improved without major intervention to the point of her arousing, being partly oriented, and following commands.
Her exam since arrival has fluctuated significantly: at times she was minimally arousable and at other times she remained awake and followed simple commands with only mild right-sided upper extremity-predominant weakness, inattention, and some memory deficits.
Her exam worsened on [**2177-8-30**] mainly due to respiratory problems and she was intubated.
During her complicated medical course, her neurologic exam has gradually deteriorated with worsening of her right sided arm and leg weakness and decreased level of awareness (unable to obtain attention, no longer following commands reliably).
After several days of delay due to multiple medical complications, she was stable enough to receive an MRI of the Brain on [**2177-9-3**] which shows multiple small right-sided ischemic infarcts (DWI bright, ADC dark), extensive subcortical and periventricular white matter disease, and persistence (but improvement) in the degree of intraventricular hemorrhage.
The EEG was negative for seizure activity.
[] Pulmonary Edema, Hemodynamic Instability - On [**2177-8-28**], the patient became progressively tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypertensive and required more supplemental O2 to maintain her SaO2 in the 90s in the setting of a 500cc fluid bolus given for suspected hypovolemia in the setting of progressive tachycardia.
[] Fever of Unknown Origin - On [**2177-8-30**], the patient became febrile and had blood, urine, and sputum cultures drawn, all of which have had no growth to date.
On [**9-1**], she had a CSF culture drawn.
She was started on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics with Cefepime and Vancomycin; these were stopped when all of her cultures remained negative.
