CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-11-13**] 7:41 PM  CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  Reason: please eval for progression of met disease, spine integrity  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48 year old woman with known metastatic thyroid cancer to T2 and lungs with new b/l UE and LE 4/5 weakness and tingling and numbness REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please eval for progression of met disease, spine integrity CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the thoracic spine were obtained without IV contrast.
Bone algorithm and sagittal and coronal reformations were performed.
An MRI would provide much better evaluation of soft tissue extension and cord and nerve root compression.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2142-11-14**] 7:11 PM  CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: please evaluate for pulmonary infiltrates  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48 year old woman with metastatic ca to spine, presenting with low grade fever and elevated WBC REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please evaluate for pulmonary infiltrates TWO-VIEW CHEST [**2142-11-14**]  COMPARISON: [**2142-8-23**].
In retrospect, a few of these nodules may have been present on the previous examination but the overall size and number appears increased.
MR THORACIC SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-11-14**] 5:07 AM  MR THORACIC SPINE W/O CONTRAST  Reason: eval for cord compression  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48 year old woman with recent surgeyr, inc pain REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for cord compression CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
COMPARISON: Comparisons were made to CT of the thoracic spine, [**2142-11-13**] and MR thoracic spine, [**2142-10-5**].
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar MR imaging of the thoracic spine was performed without intravenous contrast.
Inversion recovery images demonstrate abnormal high signal within the T3 vertebral body and posterior soft tissues from T1 to T3 that represent reactive changes.
IMPRESSION: Metastatic vertebra plana of T2 and additional metastases involving T1 and T3 with worsening severe spinal cord compression secondary to an enlarging large soft tissue component.
ROUTINE MRI OF THE CERVICAL AND LUMBAR SPINE WAS PERFORMED WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM.
Comparison is made with multiple prior studies including [**2142-11-13**] and [**2142-10-5**].
FINDINGS:  As noted on the prior examination from [**2142-11-14**], there is metastatic vertebra plana of T2 with extensive epidural tumor causing circumferential narrowing and encasement of the spinal cord.
Metastatic involvement of T1 and T2 vertebral bodies is also noted.
Evaluation of the lumbar spine demonstrates no evidence for abnormal marrow signal or pathologic compression.

Note:  Immunoperoxidase studies, performed on both parts II and III show the carcinoma to be strongly positive for CK7 and TTF-1 (nuclear pattern) and negative for CK20 and thyroglobulin.
FS T2 Bone and soft tissue.
FS T4 bone.
TECHNIQUE: CTA CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  COMPARISONS: No prior chest CTs are available for comparison.
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler images of right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial veins were obtained.
CT removed yesterday REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate for pneumothorax AP CHEST 6:41 A.M. ON [**11-20**]  HISTORY: Metastatic thyroid carcinoma.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-18**] through 15:  Left lower lobe atelectasis and small left basal pleural effusion have increased since [**11-19**].
INR has increased over this period 1.2->2.5->3.1, and was 4.4 the day of discharge.
The patient has follow-up with her PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 766**] to have an INR measured.
Evaluation revealed that you had tumor invasion of your thoracic spine with compression of your spinal cord.
