In ED, she was febrile to 99.7 and physical exam revealed no focal source.
Labs revealed wcc of 0.9.
CT-guided biopsy showed plasmacytoma.
Work-up at the time revealed a modest IgG kappa and a question of light chain in the urine.
She had a bone bone marrow biopsy, which showed 10% plasma cells with abundance of kappa staining and evidence of plasma cell aggregates and plasmablast.
The patient underwent a repeat skeletal survey, which showed new punched out lesions in  the skull as well as a calcium of ~10.4-10.9.
At [**Hospital1 18**], bone marrow biopsy showed plasma cells accounting for approximately 20% of the cells with kappa restriction.

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**2-8**]: 1.
VQ Scan: [**2-8**] 1.
Limited study due to low tracer count on the ventilation study.
Left ventricular systolic function is difficult to assess given fast heart rate and poor acoustic windows but appears at least mildly depressed (LVEF~40%).
Chest Xray [**2115-2-26**]: Right PICC terminating in the proximal SVC in appropriate position.
Febrile Neutropenia: Initially there was no clear source clinically and imaging and cultures were not revealing.
She underwent 5 sessions of plasmapheresis and her IgG levels decreased significantly.
She was treated initially w/ clinda and primaquine for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] this was d/c'd as CXR and O2 status showed interval improvement with diuresis.
VQ scan showed low probability for PE and bl LENIs were nonrevealing for DVTs.
She should have her CBC checked after discharge and may require subsequent doses of Neupogen.
