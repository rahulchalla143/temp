Gallbladder, cholecystectomy (C-D): Focal acute and chronic cholecystitis; no carcinoma seen.
Limited evaluation of the hepaticojejunostomy and pancreaticojejunostomy sites.
[**2105-7-7**] CT ABD: IMPRESSION: 1.
Bilateral small pleural effusions, smaller on the right compared to the prior study with associated atelectasis/consolidation within the lung bases; otherwise the residual lung parenchyma is clear.
[**2105-7-16**] CT ABD: IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for evaluation and treatment.
On [**2105-6-30**], the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, liver biopsy, complex pancreaticoduodenectomy, harvest of pedicled omental flap for protection of pancreatic anastomosis, harvest of pedicled omental flap for protection of gastrojejunostomy.
POD 1: There was bloody output from the patient's JP drain.
The patient was subsequently transported back to the OR, where an exploratory laparotomy revealed a retroperitoneal bleed which appeared to be venous.
Vital signs were routinely monitored.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.
UOP was monitored closely throughout the course of his care, and he was bolused with fluids accordingly.
A CTA was performed, which was inconclusive, and he was taken to interventional radiology where angiography was performed.
His NG-tube was discontinued, and the patient remained stable from a pulmonary and CV standpoint.
His urine output and vital signs improved.
Bedside echocardiogram was performed, which revealed normal function of the heart.
He was sent for both urine and blood cultures (x2).
Urine culture came back negative, and blood cultures came back positive for GNR's x2.
Approximately 500 cc of serosanguinous fluid was expressed from the wound, which was sent for gram stain and culture.
POD 12: Patient's incisional output became more bilious appearing.
CT scan with PO and IV contrast were performed, revealing a leak in his GI tract.
Wound culture came back positive for GNR's.
GNR's from the wound culture were speciated - Klebsiella pneumoniae, sensitive to cefepime and resistant to ciprofloxacin.
POD 14: Patient was started on  trophic tube feeds, and TPN was started.
POD 16: Patient had 2 episodes of emesis.
CT scan with PO contrast was acquired: decrease in size of fluid collections seen since prior CT. His tube feeds were changed to peptamen, and vancomycin was discontinued.
POD 17 ([**2105-7-17**]): Continued TPN and TF.
POD 18 ([**2105-7-18**]): Transferred to the floor.
Plavix/ASA was discontinued s/t bleeding from incision.
POD 19 ([**2105-7-19**]): Tube feed advanced to goal, TPN discontinued.
POD 20 ([**2105-7-20**]): Transfused with 2 units of RBC for HCT 23.4.
Post transfusion HCT 29.7.
POD 21 (7//24/12): Hypernatremia with Na 151.
POD 22 ([**2105-7-22**]): Na 155, continued D5W boluses.
POD 23 ([**2105-7-23**]): Given 2L D5W for hypernatremia 155.
POD 24 ([**2105-7-24**]); Na 148, given 1 L D5W.
POD 25 ([**2105-7-25**]): Na 147, continue to hold diuretics.
POD 26 ([**2105-7-26**]): Patient completed 14 days course of antibiotics and abx were discontinued.
POD 27 ([**2105-7-27**]): Vomited 300 cc bilious.
POD 28 ([**2105-7-28**]): Na 140, D5W boluses stopped, continued with free H2O boluses via J-tube.
POD 29 ([**2105-7-29**]): Wound VAC was changed Q48H secondary to blood clot obstruction to suction.
The patient was tolerating small sips, ambulating short distance with assist, still has a Foley for urine output monitoring, and pain was well controlled.
Incision Care: Wound VAC with continuous pressure of 125 mm/Hg.
