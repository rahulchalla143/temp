Radiologic Data CTA brain ([**2193-5-3**]): 1.
MRI/MRA brain ([**2193-5-3**]): 1.
CXR ([**2193-5-3**]): Lungs remain quite low with most pronounced atelectasis at the medial lung bases.
Repeat MRI on hospital day three demonstrated small lesions in the distribution of the PCA bilaterally.
MRA of the neck was also performed at that time and was negative for dissection.
At the time of discharge, neurologic examination was notable for left congruous incomplete homonymous hemianopia, dysmetria (left>right), left sided weakness in an UMN pattern.
Blood loss anemia/gastrointestinal bleeding: The pt's hematocrit dropped to 25.5 after tPA (was initially 32.1).
The gastroenterology service was consulted and an EGD was performed on hospital day three.
As no clear evidence of source of bleeding was identified, push enteroscopy was performed on hospital day six and revealed friability, scalloping, atrophied villi in the jejunum (biopsy); ulcers in the proximal jejunum and mid jejunum (biopsy); nodularity and atrophy in the whole duodenum; mass in the distal bulb (biopsy); edematous, boggy mucosa and erosion in the antrum and stomach body.
His hematocrit was cycled post-push enteroscopy and remained stable in the 26-30 range.
At discharge, his hematocrit was 26.4.
They recommended to continue to follow his hematocrit upon discharge to rehab, and noted that further work-up will be deferred to an outpatient basis.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: -posterior circulation infarcts -blood loss anemia due to gastrointestinal bleed  Discharge Condition: Stable.
Neurologic examination notable for for left congruous incomplete homonymous hemianopia, dysmetria (left>right), mild (4+/5) left sided weakness in an UMN pattern.
