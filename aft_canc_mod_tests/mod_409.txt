Admission Date:  [**2184-8-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-8-24**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Lisinopril / Plaquenil / Haldol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**] Chief Complaint: Lethargy and abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2184-8-16**]: retroperitoneal mass biopsy [**2184-8-23**]: Exploratory Lap ( Unresectable)   History of Present Illness: 89F mild dementia at baseline, RA, HTN, anemia, CRI from nursing home for evaluation of lethargy.
Exam was significant for AAOx3, marked abdominal tenderness with guarding, and guiaic positive brown stool.
Labs significant for lactate 5.5, clean UA with granular and hylanine casts, Cr 1.9 (baseline 1.1), HCO3 21, Glc 135 with small AG, ALT 122, AST 226, ALP 130, WBC 23.3 with 73% N and 11 % Band, Hgb 7.8 (baseline ~ 9), INR 2.2.
Blood and urine cultures were obtained.
Imaging including abdominal US, CT Abd and Plevis without contrast were suggestive of gangrenous cholecystitis with wall thickening and probable hemorrhage with no frank perforation.
CT showed dilated gallbladder with pericholecystics stranding and irregular wall contour again raising concern for gangrenous cholecystitis less likely [**Hospital3 **] surgery was consulted with initial impression of gangrenous cholecystitis with suggestion of perc chole but further review may suggest a gallbladder mass with secondary infection.
VS on transfer: 96 110/98 25 100% 3L with access consisting of 2 18G PIV.
Aortic insufficiency (1+ on echo in [**2176**]) 3.
Anemia - previous labs c/w anemia of chronic inflammation, also h/o B12 deficiency 5.

Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2184-8-13**]):    GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
[**8-18**] CT chest abd and pelvis: MPRESSION: 1.
Her lactate cleared (5.2 --> 5.5 --> 1.9) with fluid resuscitation.
Blood pressures were stable without need for pressor support.
Her bacteremia grew  E coli pansensitive and she was given ceftriaxone.
Pt's last positive blood cx was positive on [**8-13**].
Surveilance cultures since then have been negative.
Bactrim will be continued as outpatient to complete a 14 day course  # Gallbladder mass- Adenocarcinoma:  Abdominal CT and US was notable for a markedly dialated and tortuous gallbaldder.
Pt had mass biopsy which showed adenocarcinoma.
# ARF:  Patient presented with a Cr of 1.9 from a base line of 1.1.
Her Creatinine began trending down after fluid resuscitation and was stable at the time of transfer (1.1).
Alk phos remained in the 120s and AST and ALT in the 30s at time of discharge.
She was transfused a total of 4 units pRBC while in the MICU and her HCT went to 28 and was stable at the time of transfer.
# History of PE:  The patient suffered a significant PE in [**2183-11-24**].
