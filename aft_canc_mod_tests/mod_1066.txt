Pt was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were T101.2, HR106, BP73/53, R20, 88%RA -> 96%2LNC.
[**4-/2112**]: bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed dysplastic basophilic and polychromatophilic erythroblasts, a marked left shift and dysplastic myelopoiesis and abundant hyperchromic megakaryocytes, which initially were felt to be consistent with colchicine toxicity; however, chromosome studies performed on that bone marrow material revealed an abnormal karyotype 15/16 studied cells showed a complex clone with the following anomalies.
His manifestations have been as follows: A. Polyneuropathy - CIDP in [**2099-6-6**]; Painful lower extremity sensory neuropathy and proprioception defects.
B. Organomegaly - Splenomegaly C. Endocrinopathy - Hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, hypocalcemia related to hypoparathyroidism D. Monoclonal gammopathy E. Skin and nail changes - now resolving.

IMAGING: [**8-21**] Chest Ct IMPRESSION:   1.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2112-8-22**] FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction.
Pulmonary macrophages and rare bronchial cells.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2112-9-6**] Transient improvement in the diffuse severe consolidative pulmonary abnormality which recurred between [**9-2**] and [**9-4**] have reversed slightly, although to some extent the greater opacification in both lungs could be due to lower lung volumes.
Hospital issues prior to patient changing goals of care to comfort measures:  # Hypotension / Septic shock: On admission, Pt met SIRS criteria with enterococcus from urine culture, coag-neg staphlococcus in [**2-8**] blood cx from [**8-18**], and radiologic evidence for multifocal pneumonia.
He intermittently required IV fluids and Levophed to maintain his MAP > 65.
CXR and chest CT revealed multifocal lobar pneumonia.
Blood Cx was positive for coagulase negative staphlococcus.
Bronchoalveolar lavage on [**8-29**] and [**8-31**] showed no organisms on culture.
CT chest showed new focal opacities in the left upper, and right lower and right middle lung lobes consistent with pneumonia.
His Hct was in the low 20s throughout this admission.
He received transfusions of packed red blood cells as need to maintain hematocrit about 21.
# Urine with enterococcus - A urine cx growing vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.
#Dysphagia: Patient had trouble swallowing medications and failed his speech and swallow evaluation [**3-10**] regurgitation/aspiration.
