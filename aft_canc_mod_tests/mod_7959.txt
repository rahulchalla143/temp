Her abdominal pain continued to worsen and she developed signs of peritonitis with a CT scan showing ischemic colitis and pneumatosis.
She underwent an exploratory laparotomy, resection ischemic/necrotic small bowel, debridement of necrotic rectum, sigmoid and descending colon with temporary abdominal closure on [**2152-8-22**].
Prior to her planned take back for a second look, she developed sudden left lower extremity ischemia which required a left femoral artery embolectomy on [**2152-8-24**] and following her embolectomy, she was started on a heparin drip.
A final operation was performed on [**2152-8-28**] where a washout, creation of ileal colonic anastomosis (side-to-side hand-sewn two layer), and closure of abdomen with Stratus mesh (10x25cm) via complex closure was performed.
Her INR at that time was approximately 2.0.
She continued to have melena from her ostomy and her aspirin, heparin and Coumadin were held with an INR of 2.6 on [**2152-9-25**] down to 2.2 on [**2152-9-26**].
She underwent a upper GI endoscopy which revealed no active bleeding source.
Her ostomy output continued to remain dark with a decreasing hematocrit down to 22.5 on [**2152-9-19**].
She was transfused 2 units of PRBC with an increase in hematocrit to 28.9.
She has been stable for the previous 24 hours (28.4,29.3,29.5,28.6) but has continued to have dark burgundy output from her ostomy with an INR of 1.6.
She underwent a tagged RBC scan this evening which localized to the right upper quadrant and received 1 unit of FFP and 2 units of plateets.

Postoperative changes within the pelvis including areas of expected bowel wall thickening, predominantly small bowel, left lower quadrant colostomy, Hartmann's pouch, well-delineated and thick walled small fluid collection which is unchanged from the prior exam and is not amenable to CT-guided or ultrasound-guided drainage.
Small Bowel Enteroscopy [**2152-9-28**] Normal mucosa in the esophagus Normal mucosa in the stomach Normal mucosa in the duodenum Normal mucosa in the proximal jejunum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Colonoscopy report [**2152-9-28**] Polyp on the Ileo-cecal valve, biopsy was obtained.
Her HCT dropped from 29 to 26 overnight and blood transfusion was started.
Interventional radiology was consulted and recommended CTA of the abdomen and pelvis, which showed no active bleeding.
Patient received two units of blood total and HCT stabilized at 34.
A polyp was also seen at the ileocecal junction and this was biopsied.
Her wound vac was changed on Friday [**2152-9-29**] last a nd her abdominal wound had good granulation tissue.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of your bleeding through your ostomy bag.
You were evaluated by Interventional Radiology and a CT angiogram of your abdomen and pelvis was ordered which showed no area of active bleeding.
Since that time you have been your red blood cell count has been stable and you ahve been continued on anticoagulation with a heparin drip.
