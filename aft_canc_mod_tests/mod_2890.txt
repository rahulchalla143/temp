Conduit angiography revealed the SVG to PDA to be stump occluded.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension SBP 164 mmHg.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-11-9**], the findings are similar (technical quality was superior for the prior study).
Cardiac enzymes trended upwards, and a cardiology c/s was called with cardiac cath.
LOS fluid balance is -4L.
We continued with daily weights, fluid restricction to 1.5L, and a low Na and Renal diet.
A cath was done in case of NSTEMI, however no intervention was done as existing CAD was seen on cath without focal occlusive lesion requiring stent.
THe pt was started on plavix, but as there was no NSTEMI and the troponin leak was thought likely [**2-18**] volume overload and cardiac strain, the plavix was d/c'ed prior to discharge.
