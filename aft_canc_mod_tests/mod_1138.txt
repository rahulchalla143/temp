Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the random colon.
A single-piece polypectomy was performed using a cold forceps in the transverse colon.
A single sessile 4 mm non-bleeding polyp of benign appearance was found in the distal sigmoid colon.
A single-piece polypectomy was performed using a hot snare in the distal sigmoid colon.
