MRI Head (functional)[**3-31**]  Successful functional MRI of the brain demonstrates expected activation in motor areas.
CT Head [**4-6**] Expected postoperative appearance of resection of known right parietal mass with stable vasogenic edema and minimal mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
MRI head [**4-7**] Expected post-op changes, possible residual enhancement in the surgical bed vs. post-op changes.
His exam remained intact.
A CT head showed no hemorrhage and good resection of mass.
A follow-up MRI was done which showed expected post-op changes.
