She was bagged with 100% fio2 and an ABG at the time was 7.35/26/256.
ECHO after transfer to the unit showed new wall motion abnormalities whereas a cath in [**2188**] had been normal.
She was originally started on vanco/zosyn when she developed hypotension [**2-18**] concerns of sepsis but these were d/c'ed after her BP improved and all her cultures remained negative.
Physical Exam: Overweight woman lying in bed in NAD, raspy voice, - rashes HEENT: EOMI, PERRLA, MMM, O/P clear Neck: - LAD Lungs: CTA b/l CV: RRR, S1/S2 intact, 2/6 SEM at the USB Abd: S/NT/ND, +BS Ext: B/L knee surgical sites C/D/I w/out sign of infection, + LE edema Neuro: CN 2-12 grossly intact, AAO x3  Pertinent Results: [**2189-11-16**] 07:00PM   CK(CPK)-49 [**2189-11-16**] 07:00PM   CK-MB-2 [**2189-11-16**] 01:28PM   CK(CPK)-36 [**2189-11-16**] 01:28PM   CK-MB-2 cTropnT-0.03*  TTE [**2189-11-20**] The left atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic  function is moderately-to-severely depressed (ejectoion fraction 30 percent)  secondeary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free wall,  and apex.
Right  ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be  determined.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2189-11-17**], the heart rate and left ventricular ejection fraction are reduced.
CT C/A/P [**2189-11-18**] IMPRESSION: 1.
DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL  [**2189-11-20**] 3:54 PM LIVER ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLER: The patient is status post cholecystectomy.
KNEE 2 VIEW PORTABLE BILAT  [**2189-11-16**] 1:33 PM  BOTH KNEES: Two nonstandard views show bilateral new total knee prostheses.
A STAT echo on transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] showed a possible new wall motion abnormality (after being coded) but no effusion, no evidence of tamponade, no changes in AVR, and an EF of 35-40% Repeat echo [**11-25**] showed persistant EF of 35%.
They recommended a follow-up echo at some point in the next few months.
Hct drop -- No clear source.
An NG lavage was negative though she was trace guaiac positive (though no melena/hematochezia).
New LBBB and [**Name (NI) 48688**] Pt had clean coronaries on cath 4/[**2188**].
She was started on both a bblocker and acei when her bp tolerated.
They recommended a follow-up Echo in the next few months.
WBC count rising so restarted on hydroxyurea on [**11-22**], and prednisone on [**12-2**].
Her hydrea dose was titrated daily until her wbc remained stable ~ 20 and her platelets also remained stable.
Knees - Pt received her bilateral knee replacement for her DJD and was followed by ortho throughout her course.
Stage 2-3 ulcer R heel - Patient developed ulcer from CPM machine as part of her rehab for her s/p TKR, which remained uninfected.
Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) 50,000 unit [**Unit Number **] PO ONCE ON WED AND SUN 10.
