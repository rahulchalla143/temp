MRSA screen ([**1-13**]): MRSA positive C. diff ([**1-17**]): negative for C. diff toxin.
Urine Culture ([**1-17**]): URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Piperacillin/tazobactam sensitivity testing available on request.
Endoscopy ([**1-18**]): colonscopy  Findings:	 Mucosa:	Mild and patchy erythema at sigmoid [**Month/Year (2) 499**] and rectum were noted.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology.
Other: The exam of terminal ileum was normal.
Otherwise the exam of the rest of [**Month/Year (2) 499**] was normal.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed to rule out microscopic colitis.
Impression:	 The exam of terminal ileum was normal.
-A 4 mm polyp in the hepatic flexure (polypectomy) -Mild patchy erythema at sigmoid [**Month/Year (2) 499**] and rectum in the [**Month/Year (2) 499**] (biopsy) -Moderate diverticulosis of the sigmoid [**Month/Year (2) 499**].
-Otherwise the exam of the rest of [**Month/Year (2) 499**] was normal.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed to rule out microscopic colitis.
Stomach: The exam of the stomach was normal.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology.
The exam of the second part of the duodenum was normal.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology.
The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged from the duodenal bulb and the second / third duodenum.
The body and tail [partially] were imaged from the gastric body and fundus.
FNA was not performed because of the use of anticoagulant and no ''alarm features''.
The exam of CBD was normal.
Impression:	 -Hiatal hernia -EGD exam revealed a normal stomach and D2 (biopsy) and slightly nodular duodenal bulb (biopsy) The -Linear EUS evaluation was then performed -A 0.8 cm X 0.6 cm discrete anechoic lesion, consistent with a cyst was noted in the uncinate process of the pancreas.
FNA was not performed because of the patient's anticoagulated status.
-The exam of CBD was normal.
CXR negative for acute process and head CT was also negative.
Her sodium levels were followed closely as well as her blood and urine osmolarity.
Pt was encouarged to have a liberal salt diet, 1200ml fluid restriction, Ensure TID and was started on salt tabs 1gm [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-14**].
A prescription for a lab check was provided to the patient and the results will be forwarded to her PCP.
Uric acid was 3. .
K+ 6.0 to 5.2.
Potassium levels were monitored and remained normal.
#ARF: Presented with a creatinine of 1.2 from 0.7, although pt stated she was drinking a lot of water at home, presentation was still likely c/w pre-renal, given recent diarrhea.
Creatinine on discharge was 0.7. .
The pt was prepped and underwent a C-scope, EGD/EUS on [**1-18**], and tolerated the procedure well.
C-scope showed a 4mm poly (removed via polypectomy), patchy erythema (biopsied), moderate diverticulosis, and random biopsies of [**Month/Year (2) 499**] were also taken to rule out microscopic colitis.
Pt will need to have her biopsy results followed-up on, and per GI recommendations, she will need a MRCP in 3 months time to evaluate her pancreas again.
Urine culture grew Cipro-sensitive E. coli.
However, Urine culture also still growing 2nd organism, although at lower colony count, only 10 - 10,000 CFU of GPC.
Will f/u final culture data/results and will contact pt if antibiotic regimen will need adjustment.
CHRONIC ISSUES: #normocytic anemia-baseline appears to be between 21-40.
GI - will need outpatient MRCP in 3 months or sooner if weight loss occurs.
Renal - pt will have to continue on fluid restriction, salt tabs, and will need her lytes checked in 10 days, with results to be faxed to and followed by PCP.
Should continue to hold her Celebrex and lisinopril given recent [**Last Name (un) **] until follow-up with PCP or Renal.
EtOH use/withdrawl - should continue on MVI/thiamine/folate.
UTI - currently growing Cipro sensitive E. Coli.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation and treatment of hyponatremia (low blood sodium), elevated potassium and impairment in your kidney function.
You will need repeat labs done in approximately 1 week (you can have them checked the day you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**1-28**]).
You underwent an endoscopy, [**Month/Year (2) 2792**] and EUS (endoscopic ultrasound), which showed a polyp in your [**Month/Year (2) 499**], some areas of inflammation (biopsied), diverticulosis, a hiatal hernia, a nodular stomach (biopsied), possible chronic pancreatitis, and a pancreatic cyst.
For your pancreatic cyst and possible changes c/w chronic pancreatitis, you will need follow-up imaging with a MRI in approximately 3 months.
You were also noted to have a urinary tract infection with a urine culture growing E. Coli.
