Short-term CT followup is recommended.

Mestatic Carcinoma: The patient was transferred from [**Doctor Last Name 38554**] Hospital for evaluation and management of his left frontal mass.
The patient underwent staging scans (given that the mass was possibly metastatic).
The patient underwent sterotatic brain biopsy (with local anethesia only), with pathology consistent revealed metastic carcinoma.
Medical-oncology was consulted for evaluation of probable lung cancer.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage: following brain biopsy, the patient had routine post-surgical head CT which showed a small subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left parietal region.
The patient had no change in his neurological exam associated with this.
Follow-up head CT was stable (no progression of hemmorhage).
Off oxygen his saturations would occasionaly drop into the mid-to-high 80's.
Of note, the patient was asymptomatic during these episodes, and his saturations improved with nebulizer treatment and supplemental oxygen.
Sputum cultures were persistently negative/contaminated.
Aspiration pneumonitis: the patient's exam (diffuse ronchi and poor cough) and chest x-rays were all suggestive of aspiration.
The pt underwent video swallow study which was negative for aspiration.
He had a  Persantine MIBI which showed LVEF 61% and now definite perfusion abnormality.
EKG was unremarkable for active disease (see results section).
His chest xray has been unchanged.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day): Check phenytoin level 1 to 2 times weekly and adjust dose for goal level of [**10-18**].
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Metastatic Carcinoma (primary likely lung with metatasis to left frontal lobe of brain) -Emphysema -Probable micro-aspirations -Pneumonia -Subarachnoid hemorrhage (post-surgical) -Right-sided weakness -Expressive Aphasia .
