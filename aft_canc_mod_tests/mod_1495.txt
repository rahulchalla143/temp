Per the Emergency Department, the ERCP fellow had been [**Name (NI) 653**], and the plan was for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the morning.
History of ascending cholangitis; status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent on [**2153-11-26**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed his temperature was 103.3 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 108 (ranging from 108 to 118), his blood pressure was 104/64, his respiratory rate was 22, and his oxygen saturation was 95% on 2 liters.
Found up brushing his teeth and cleaning up prior to his endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the extraocular movements were intact.
Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia with a regular rhythm.
Pulmonary examination revealed the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal examination revealed normal active bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Admission white blood cell count was 19.5.
His hematocrit was 27.6.
His INR was 1.4.
Alanine-aminotransferase was 81, aspartate aminotransferase was 96, alkaline phosphatase was 339, and his total bilirubin was 0.7.
Blood cultures revealed no growth.
CHOLANGITIS ISSUES:  The patient admitted with fevers, chills, and right upper quadrant pain with a recent history of admission for ascending cholangitis; likely again an infectious process within the liver as the patient immediately started on ampicillin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl with a plan for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the morning.
An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was attempted with no epigastric output obstruction secondary to the tumor.
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  The patient developed a gastrointestinal bleed following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; during which endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was prematurely held secondary to gastric outlet obstruction and inability to pass the scope with a notation made of oozing and bleeding at the obstruction site.
The patient was thus transferred back to the floor, and his hematocrit remained stable prior to discharge.
DUODENAL OBSTRUCTION ISSUES:  The patient was noted to have gastric outlet obstruction on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography soon after admission.
Temperature maximum overnight was 100.2 degrees Fahrenheit.
