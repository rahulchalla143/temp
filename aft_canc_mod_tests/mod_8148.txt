Visual fields are full to confrontation, although patient has difficulty with vision given erythromycin eye ointment in eyes bilaterally and more formal visual field testing was difficult, but also showed full visual fields to finger wiggling III, IV, VI: R sided incomplete ptosis, mild difficulty with abduction of R eye and is unable to bury the sclera on that side, but otherwise EOMI despite disconjugate gaze (bilateral exotropia) on primary gaze.

Hemorrhagic components cannot be completely excluded but are less obvious on the non-contrast CT than seen on the same day MRI.
[**2169-4-23**] MRI brain with gad Again a large pituitary mass is identified extending to suprasellar region and compressing the optic chiasm.
The pre-gadolinium signal intensities could not be assessed as on the prior study demonstrated increased signal.
The current examination demonstrates no evidence of lateral extension in the region of the cavernous sinuses lateral to the cavernous carotids.

MRI showed a 2.2cm tumor in his pituitary.
Follow up CT head suggested pituitary apoplexy.
On [**4-20**] a conjunctival swab was performed due to drainage and it grew Group A strep.
Opthomology did visual field testing on [**2169-4-21**].
Vision was 20/30.
CT head showed expected post op changes.
Coags were followed every 6 hours while he ws on Heparin gtt with a PTT goal of 60-80 and INR goal of [**12-23**].
On [**2169-4-28**] when PTT was within therapeutic range a repeat non-contrast Head CT was performed which was stable without evidence of hemorrhage.
His PTT elevated to 100 with an INR of 1.9 on the morning of [**4-28**] and thus the heparin drip was held for an hour and restarted at a lower dose of 500 units/hour.
Overnight his PTT and INR dropped significantly and his coumadin and heparin gtt were adjusted to 750u/hr and 7.5mg.
His INR on [**4-29**] was 1.2 and increased to 1.8 on [**4-30**].
On [**5-1**], patient remained stable, INR at 2.1.
It was also noted that his creatinine was 1.5 so he was given an IVF bolus.
The patient's PCP office was [**Name (NI) 653**] and it was recommended that he follow up on Wednesday to have his INR and Cr checked (appt was made for patient).
