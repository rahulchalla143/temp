Admission Date:  [**2105-1-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-1-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-9-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: transferred from OSH for thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, hypoxic resp failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: plasmapheresis  History of Present Illness: 41yo man with h/o PCV, vWF def, PSA, who p/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8**] Hosp 5d PTA with c/o LUQ pain s/p falling down stairs, found to have ruptured spleen, went to OR for splenectomy, then ICU post-op 2/2 blood loss, where his plt count rose to 2,019,000 and WBC to 118,000 on Post-Op Day #4.
He had a fever to 103 on Post-Op Day #2, was started on Zosyn and Vanc empirically, blood cultures negative to date.
The patient was in moderate hypoxic respiratory failure presumably since his surgery, requiring 50% FiO2 on non-rebreather to maintain his sats in the 95% range.
Social History: etoh: active abuser, unknown quantities tob: active smoker drugs: active abuser, unknown drugs or quantities  Family History: Unremarkable (per OSH)  Brief Hospital Course: 41yo man with h/o PCV, vWF def, PSA, who p/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8**] Hosp 5d PTA with c/o LUQ pain s/p falling down stairs, found to have ruptured spleen, underwent splenectomy, post-op plt count rose to 2,019,000 and WBC to 118,000 on Post-Op Day #4.
Mr.[**Known lastname 111152**] did complain of headache early in the course of his hospitalization that subsided when his platelet count was consistently less than 1.5 million.
Initially, the doubling time of Mr.[**Known lastname 111153**] platelet count was 12 hours, requiring plt pharesis every other day.
Mr. [**Known lastname 111153**] platelt count is now decreasing daily, currently at 1115k, just on interferon.
Hydroxyurea was discontinued when his WBC dropped precipitously to 7K.
Etiology thought to be [**3-17**] combination C.diff leukocytosis, s/p splenectomy and possible myeloproliferative disorder.
Unlikely blast crisis given lack of blasts seen on peripheral smear,  but will need formal bone marrow biopsy to address this problem.
Mr.[**Known lastname 111153**] white count decreased from 16-->7, so his hydrea was held.
Hypoxic Resp Failure:  Pt admit ABG:  7.49/33/48, CXR revealed multilobar pneumonia and CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism.
Repeat CXR revealed resolution of multilobar infiltrates.
Head CT negative.
Interferon Alfa-2A 3,000,000 unit/0.5 mL Kit Sig: Three (3) million units Subcutaneous MWF.
Meet Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 13972**] at 9:30 AM on Tuesday [**1-27**].
