CT Torso [**6-20**]: CT CHEST: The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.
There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.
CT ABDOMEN: The liver, pancreas, spleen appear normal.
CT PELVIS: The urinary bladder and ureters appear normal.
There are no enlarged lymph nodes in the pelvic or inguinal area according to CT size criteria.
MRI Head [**6-22**]: FINDINGS: There is a 2.7 cm round circumscribed extra-axial mass at the right vertex, depressing the paracentral lobule inferiorly.
A small portion of the non-enhancing center demonstrates low signal on the gradient-echo images without evidence of blooming, which is somewhat more likely to represent calcification rather than blood products.
Faint hyperdensity within the mass on the preceding CT scan is compatible with either calcification or blood products.
She had a post-op MRI which showed expected surgical changes without evidence of new infarct.
