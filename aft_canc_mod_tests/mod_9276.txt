He required an NGT for nutrition and has since started eating on his own once he passed a swallowing evaluation (recommended ground solids and thin liquids).
Given 2 U blood for anemia.
Due to renal failure, patient is unable to undergo angiogram and is adamently refusing amuputation of the leg.
Therefore, it was recommended that steroids were initiated (prednisone 40 mg PO daily), PPI be d/c-ed and changed to H2 blocker, and to schedule a renal biopsy if renal failure continued to worsen.
On the floor, patient became delirious, refusing PIV and blood draws.

L leg - wrapped in bandage, c/d/i.
Renal u/s - [**2-12**] - IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.
Renal Scan: [**2-16**]: Renogram images show uniform, symmetric uptake of tracer throughout both kidneys.
CXR: LLL retrocardiac opacity c/f PNA (noted on [**2132-2-15**]) => repeat CXR showed improved of opacity, with small bilateral effusions.
Hct: 28.2-> 25.6-> 26.2-> 28.2-> 26.7-> 24.3-> 2 units prbcs-> 33.9  Creatinine: [**2-11**] 0.7 [**2-12**] 2.3 [**2-13**] 2.7 [**2-14**] 3.0  C3 53, C4 19  C diff negative x4  UPEP negative SPEP: pending  Angiography Results: ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS: 1.
A patent abdominal aorta that is diffusely diseased, but     no areas of flow-limiting stenosis.
CONCLUSION:  The patient would need a femoral to above-knee popliteal artery bypass, along with a left transmetatarsal amputation to achieve a satisfactory wound healing in the left lower extremity.
Blood and urine cultures were negative.
TSH indicated a subclinical hypothyroidism (poor free T4->T3 conversion in the setting of acute illness) which did not require levothyroxine supplementation.
RPR was negative.
He was taken off glyburide, required D10 drip and boluses of D50 to maintain blood sugars.
His blood sugars were more consistent after starting tube feeds.
No renal biopsy was performed as creatinine improved.
His creatinine peaked at 3.2, and resolved to 1.2 on transfer from the MICU.
Sputum culture showed staph aureus.
Angiogram was performed after renal function improved, and showed a L superficial femoral occlusion with some collaterals above the popliteal artery.
Vascular recommended a fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass and a transmetatarsal amputation, which was postponed given altered mental status.
C. difficile toxin assay was negative x4.
Hemoglobin A1c was 5.6%, so either onset of DM is relatively recent or blood sugars in 400s were acute exacerbated by prednisone.
Negative for C. difficile toxin assay x4 after which empiric flagyl was d/c-ed.
Stool for culture (Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, E. coli O157:H7), O&P negative x3.
Pt had flex sigmoidoscopy performed here for assessment of rectal mass.
Based on biopsy and impox stains obtained from OSH, GI suggested that the rectal mass can be excised via endoscopic transanal approach as an outpatient.
Hct stable between 24 and 30.
He was not treated with a PPI given AIN, but with an H2 blocker.
Obtained GI follow-up as outpatient for palliative polypectomy.
