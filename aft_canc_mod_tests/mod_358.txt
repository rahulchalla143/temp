Given the extent of the pt's disease, the pt discussed her treatment options w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] and her oncologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and she has decided to undergo surgery (L extrapleural pneumonectomy w/ additional resection of L suprarenal mass).
Pt also notes mild abdominal pain since her bx in [**9-18**]; immediately after the procedure, the pt says she developed an "infection" involving fever and "yellowish stuff" draining from her umbilicus; the fever and discharge have since resolved, but mild pain persists, intermittent and sharp in the epigastric/LLQ area "right under the skin."
Lung bx, [**9-18**], as above.
Retroperitoneal bx, [**9-18**], as above.. .
Radial, DP pulses 2+ bilaterally.
Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes/rales/rhonchi.
Registers [**4-15**], recalls [**4-15**] in 5 minutes.
Since she did complain of double vision since being weaned off mestinon and prednisone, Mestinon was restarted on [**11-26**] and settled on a dose of 60mg Q4H on [**12-12**] given sweating and chest pressure with the higher doses.
Her double vision gradually improved with the therapies and her fatigue, which was mild, also resolved.
Her NIFs and VCs were stable for several days prior to discharge.
RESP: In the ED, patient had a chest CT with contrast which was negative for pulmonary embolism.
Throughout the hospital course she ranged NIFs -30-50, VC 1.0-1.5L and was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring overnight on [**11-29**] due persistent tachypnea, a slightly increased A-a gradient and dramatic decrease in VC 2.4 to 1.3.
Pulmonology was consulted and recommended checking an ambulatory sat which was 94-97%; otherwise, followed her course with the primary team.
Chest x-ray showed a paralyzed lateral left hemidiaphragm which was felt to also be contributing to her shortness of breath.
Thoracics recommended an abdominal CT with IV and PO contrast which was negative for new metastases; however, the risk of complication with patient's current breathing problems outweighed the benefit of any imminent surgical procedure.
CV: Patient's EKG showed PR depression in inferior leads and slight ST depression in lead II concerning for her cardiac process.
Cardiology was consulted due to sustained elevation of cardiac enzymes from [**Date range (1) 10334**] (CK 221, 176, 158, 170; CKMB 23, 19, 20, 22; CKMBI 10.4, 10.8, 12.7, 12.9; TnT 0.10 x 4).
Per cardiology, patient had no signs, symptoms or risk factors for acute coronary syndrome but CT showed metastasis near the pericardium and so recommended a 2D echo which showed 2+ mitral regurgiation (incr'd from prior), normal ejection fraciton >55% and no pericardial effusion.
BNP was 70, not suggestive of CHF.
