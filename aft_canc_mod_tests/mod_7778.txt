CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  No focal liver lesions are identified.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is decompressed with mild bladder wall thickening, which may relate to prior radiation treatment or outlet obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU COURSE  # T Cell Lymphoma / Lymphadenopathy:  Patient has history of axillary adenopathy which had been biopsied in [**2128**], with results consistent with CMV-lymphadenitis, negative for [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name 93840**] cells, negative flow cytometry.
Results of the pathology were c/w T cell lymphoma.
CT scan was performed which did not show evidence of bleed or malignancy.
Potential hepatorenal syndrome was considered, but urine sodium > 10 was not consistent with HRS.
Ativan, morphine, and scopolamine were started.
Patient was given maintenance fluids on the floor and his pressures remained between 90s-110s systolic, without the need for pressors.
He was cultured and covered for febrile neutropenia in the ED with Vanc and Cefepime because his white count came back at 1.8 with 28% bands.
Patient had a temp to 100.6 on transfer to the floor.
Blood cultures remained negative.
He had an extensive ID workup, including CMV viral load, HepB/C AG, Hep B/C viral load, cryptococcal antigen, HIV viral load, RPR, as well as cryptococcal antigen, which all came back negative.
His blood cultures remained negative.
RUQ ultrasound failed to reveal biliary duct dilation or stones.
CT abdomen/pelv with contrast failed to show focal liver disease or intra or extra hepatic biliary dilation.
Hepatitis studies as well as [**Doctor First Name **] and AMA were negative.
His valgancyclovir was halted for a few weeks prior to admission for concern for marrow suppression.
His valgancyclovir was discontinued on D3 of admission after an ophthalmology evaluation revealed no retinitis and his CMV load was negative.
