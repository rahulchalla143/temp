She was brought to [**Hospital6 **] where she was found to have multiple lab abnormalities including renal failure, Ca >13, CK elevation, WBC 19 with bandemia, LFT abnormalities and coagulopathy.
She underwent a torso CT confirming the OSH findings.
Head CT also revealed a possible intracranial met vs. bleed.

CT chest abdomen pelvis: 1.
Comparison with prior studies is recommended.
MRI brain: 1.
Comparison with any prior studies would be helpful.
CT head: 1.
Further evaluation with MR [**Name13 (STitle) 46499**] MRI is recommended.
On CT scan, patient was found to have diffusely metastatic disease to the liver and brain, with a RLL lung mass.
Her lung mass was biopsied by interventional pulmonary with pathology consistent with NSCLC.
Her skeletal survey did not show evidence of bony lesions.
She was also noted to have an oxygen requirement, thought to be secondary to tumor burden in her lungs as well as likely underlying COPD.
Initially, patient had a CT scan and MRI of the brain which showed a likely intracranial metastasis.
For the patient's rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, his initial CK and LDH were elevated, with blood on UA, without RBCs.
She was also noted to have positive blood cultures on initial set draw on [**6-23**], which eventually grew out coagulase negative staph aureus.
She was started on vancomycin, which was discontinued once final cultures returned.
Her repeat blood cultures are negative to date.
She will need to follow up with oncology for further evaluation once her functional status has improved after a rehabilitation stay.
