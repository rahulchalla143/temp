In the Emergency Room, the patient's respiratory rate was confirmed in the 30s with oxygen saturation about 80% to 100% on non-rebreather.
ABG on 8 L was 7.42, 30, and 43.
Chest x-ray showed ................. redistribution, but overall was poor quality.
Electrocardiogram revealed right bundle branch block, left anterior descending Q-waves in inferior leads, which per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was old.
The patient received 40 mg intravenous Lasix with 1 L diuresis and improvement in oxygen saturation 90% on 100% non-rebreather.
The patient underwent CT angiogram, given concerns for PE.
Exam revealed no PE, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mild congestive heart failure.
Vital signs:  Temperature 99.6?????
?, blood pressure 105/60, heart rate 95-100, respirations 26-30, oxygen saturation 88% to 90% non-rebreather.
LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray and CT angiogram as previously described.
White count 8.5, hematocrit 49.4, platelet count 160,000; CHEM7 unremarkable; ABG as described.
Electrocardiogram as described.
He was brought to his baseline oxygen requirement of about 6 L/min by nasal cannula.
He will remain on 6 L oxygen by nasal cannula trying to keep the oxygen saturations between 80 and 90%.
