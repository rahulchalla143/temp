CT head ([**2105-12-14**]): IMPRESSION: Slight decrease in left frontal subdural hematoma.
Klebsiella UTI and bacteremia: Culture data revealed klebsiella urinary tract infection and bacteremia.
Initially treated with PO cipro but changed to cefepime once blood culture data returned.
Surveillance cultures remained negative.
Transaminitis: Liver enzymes found to be trending upwards over the last several months after the diagnosis of aplastic anemia and transfusion requirement increased.
Iron levels were high and hepatology was consulted to investigate secondary iron overload as a potential cause for transaminitis.
MRI was performed which confirmed significant iron deposition within the liver and spleen.
ABG was consistent with mild respiratory alkalosis.
CXR showed mild pulmonary edema.
Echo was WNL.
ECG was without abnormality.
Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close monitoring of respiratory status with suspicion of an ATG-related reaction.
Once the patient's liver enzymes were stable, the patient was started on cyclosporine at 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].
CT scan showed 5mm left frontal subdural hematoma.
Neurosurgery was consulted, q4h neuro checks were performed, and platelets were transfused with goal >75.
Head CT was repeated 12 hours later with no acute changes.
Repeat head CT showed a smaller subdural hematoma.
Neurosurgery recommended followup in [**7-29**] weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 78630**] with repeat non-contrast head CT before the visit.
CT without any acute process.
EKG showed sinus rhythm with ectopic atrial beats.
Followup MRI in one year to follow cystic structure visualized.
Followup cyclosporine levels  Medications on Admission: -acyclovir 400mg PO BID -atenolol 25mg PO qHs -cyclosporine 125mg PO BID -folic acid 1mg PO daily -HCTZ 25mg PO daily -MVI -neupogen - no regular schedule.
You were noted to have high blood pressure, so amlodipine, a blood pressure medication, was started.
You have an appointment scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and his nurse [**Last Name (STitle) 3525**] at 10:30 am on Thursday, [**12-24**].
You can make an appointment with him in [**7-29**] weeks with a CT scan of your head before your visit.
