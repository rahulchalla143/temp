Imaging/diagnostics: - CTA chest ([**2157-8-1**]): 1.
- CT head ([**2157-8-1**]): No acute intracranial process.
- Echocardiogram ([**2157-8-2**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-7-18**], right ventricle is slightly hypokinetic.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

Her dyspnea and oxygen requirment continued to improve with this diuresis, and was 1.7L negative without lasix for 24 hours as of 8am [**2157-8-12**].
# Pulmonary embolism: CTA showed right basal segmental PE with ?
She had a small pericardial effusion on CTA but no tamponade physiology on echocardiogram or pulsus paradoxus (8mmHg -> 8mmHg) exam.
Pt received 1 mg po Vit K evening of [**2157-8-17**] to avoid supratherapeutic INR while undergoing DCCV.
Her INR will need to be monitored very closely, especially given changing amiodarone dosing.
# Aflutter with RVR/Hypotension: On admission, HR >130 with sBP 80-90s.
Attempted to rate control with esmolol gtt but blood pressure did not tolerate it.
TSH was checked and returned at 12.
Urine culture showed yeast and and 3000 colony count of enterococcous.
Given lack of fever or WBC, the decision was made to wait until urine culture resulted before starting antibiotics despite a UA with persistent pyuria.
Subsequent urine culture grew 10k-100k yeast, which given her absece of symptoms, dd not require further treatment at this time.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely pre-renal secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of afib with RVR and volume overload.Her creatinine peaked at 2.3, five days after contrast load.
Her Cr improved to 1.5 by the time of discharge.
Her lasix was converted from IV to po, and may need further titration as an outpatient.
# C. diff colitis: C. diff toxin positive in [**6-22**] and has long history of C. diff colitis since Whipple procedure in [**2156**].
Despite treatment with po flagyl, she began to develop severe diarrhea, and c-diff tox screen turned positive (negative earlier in the admission).

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a fast heart rate and were found to have a new pulmomary embolism as well as a heart rhythm called atrial flutter.
The fast heart rate did not respond well to several medications but was ultimately controlled with electric cardioversion.
