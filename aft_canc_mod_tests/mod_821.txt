The patient was diagnosted with a pneumonia on [**4-22**] by CXR after developing fever and dyspnea while at rehab treated with vancomycin, azithro, and continued on pip/tazo.
This morning, he was noted to be febrile  at [**Doctor Last Name **] house to 101.3 and hypoxemic with SaO2 88-92% NRB.
He received 40 mg lasix, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
At that time, he was transferred to the ICU for hypotension, and was also noted to have an atrial tachycardia and troponinemia felt to be an NSTEMI with peak CK 567, MB 49, TnT 2.23.
He has undergone IR drainage and drain placement, with serial cultures demonstrating Pseudomonas and Enterococcus, with plan for prolonged pip/tazo therapy with ID follow-up.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 98.1, 88, 101/57, 24 89%NRB.
Labs were notable for WBC 16, INR 3.8, and creatinine 1.7.
A CXR demonstrated bilateral airspace opacities, he received cefepime, and was briefly placed on NIPPV.
