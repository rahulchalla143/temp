Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation, pt received vanco, zosyn, and dilt 35mg.
Patient was given 4L NS with total UOP of 1200cc.
His Hct remained stable.
Repeat ABG five hours later showed 7.47, 27, 67 on room air.
Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Back: large healing surgical incision in lumbar sign, some erythema but no swelling or discharge.
Neuro: aaox3, 5/5 strength b/l and throughout, sensation intact.

MRI Lumber Spine [**2121-6-19**] 1.
Limited evaluation of multilevel degenerative disc disease with disc bulges as detailed above.
There remains high clinical concern, repeat MRI with increased sedation or correlation with nuclear scintigraphy exam should be considered.
[**2121-6-27**] CT head IMPRESSION: Small vessel ischemic disease, no sign of abscess.
TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed at 1.5 Tesla using the shoulder coil.
A focal area of T2 hyperintensity measuring 12 (AP) x 12 (TV) x 16 (CC) mm with thick peripheral enhancement (series 15:25) located in the proximal humeral metadiaphysis is consistent with an intraosseous abscess.
While not dedicated to evaluation of the rotator cuff, there is a complete tear of the supraspinatus tendon, as well as tears of the infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons.
Blood cx showed MRSA bacteremia on [**2121-6-17**].
Patient had a Lumbar laminectomy to drain an epidural abscess, L4-S1 on [**2121-6-22**] which he tolerated well.
Each time he was recultured (no growth on cultures after [**6-22**]).
MR shoulder showed osteomyelitis, septic joint and interosseous abscess.
Orthopedics did a tap of the shoulder that was dry, and their assessment was that there was no discrete abscess that would benefit from an open shoulder washout.
Initial UE u/s did not show DVT.
CT elbow showed small (<1cm) fluid in biceps and small joint effusion without osteo.
Repeat u/s [**6-26**] showed brachial vein clot with 8x10cm complex cyst in shoulder, concerning for an abscess.
Did not start coumadin in setting of recent laminectomy and ?GI bleed, started heparin gtt goal PTT 50-60.
MRI showed osteomyelitis, septic joint and abscess.
Patient refused colonoscopy and EGD and understood the risks of not working up a guiaic positive stool.
His hct has been stable for >1 week .
Anemia: Patient had iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation/disease.
Pt reticulocyte count 3.9%, corrected retic index ~1%, which is not appropriate with his anemia and consistent with this diagnosis.
Hypoalbuminemia: urine negative for protein, probably not a liver synthesis problem as [**Name (NI) 3539**] not elevated and only slight INR increase.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw weekly BUN, creatinine, CBC with differential to monitor renal function and treatment response to vancomycin, and platelets to monitor for acute marked drop from lovenox.
Your stool was positive for blood was tested.
You refused to have a colonoscopy or upper scope.
When you came from the outside hospital your heart was beating in an irregular rhythm - atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
