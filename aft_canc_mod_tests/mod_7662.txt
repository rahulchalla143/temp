He called his PCP and was sent for a head CT.
Patient presented to [**Hospital6 **] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after the head CT revealed a 5.2x2.5x3.3 cm mass in the sella with moderate hydrocephalus.

Not Finalized  [**4-2**] NCHCT  No change compared to study on [**2138-3-31**].
NCHCT [**3-31**]  Little change in appearance of suprasellar mass with associated  mild hydrocephalus, details as above.
[**2138-3-27**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1.
Expected appearance, status post transsphenoidal biopsy of the large sellar/suprasellar mass, with post-surgical defect and post-operative pneumocephalus.
[**2138-3-25**] CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRA FINDINGS: The 3.4 x 3.2 cm pituitary mass is unchanged in appearance from the prior CT and MRI.
In general it is round, with smooth borders, and a small outpouching from the right lateral aspect (5, 26).
[**2138-3-25**] CT SINUS W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: A 3.8 x 3.4 cm sellar and suprasellar mass does not appear significantly changed from the prior MRI and CT examinations.
Large sellar/suprasellar mass with areas of abnormal susceptibility which on correlating with the recent CT appear to represent hemorrhagic changes.
[**2138-3-24**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison.
Endocrine was consulted, a series of labs were sent and later that evening patient's prolactin level came back extremely elevated, indicating the most likely diagnosis to be a prolactinoma.
He was extubated the following day on [**3-27**] and follow up imaging showed that his ventricles had reduced in size.
His CT imaging demonstrated that the sellar mass was shrinking in size.
Screening lower extremity ultrasounds were performed and were negative.
He was sent to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for computerized ophthomology evaluation that was consistent with dense bitemporal hemianopsia.
Further follow up imaging will be arranged at that time.
You will need to have your blood drawn here at [**Hospital1 18**] on Thursday [**4-10**].
