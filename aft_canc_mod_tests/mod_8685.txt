While in the ED, he was noted to have a rapid ventricular rate to the 130s for which he received 25mg of IV diltiazem followed by 60mg of PO verapamil with good response.
His symptoms disappeared but he was then noted to have rates in the 150s w/ new STE in I/aVL.
Repeat EKG showed reversion of his EKG changes to his baseline STD.
CKD 9.
Organ exam limited by habitus.
Etiology unclear and PET CT can be performed to further evaluate.
Stable 5-mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule, again a repeat evaluation in [**5-8**] months could document two-year stability.
[**11-19**] Head CT: HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no comparison.
EKG leads are seen draping over the patient.
