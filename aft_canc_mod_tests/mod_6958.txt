Yesterday ([**8-3**]) his HCT had further dropped to 20.0 and he was transfused 2 units of pRBCs with appropriate increase to 26.0.
His blood pressure dropped to 80s/doppler from systolic 110s at baseline.

He was transferred to the MICU on [**8-4**] for management of hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status  #) Septic Shock: Patient was found to be in septic shock with pulmonary source- CXR showed new left parenchymal opacity mid/lower lung zone.
The patient's CVP and SVO2 were stabilized with 5 L NS.
Lactate trended down from 2.9 to below 2.0.
Further hemodynamic instabiltiy was addressed regarding Afib with RVR (see below).
C diff assay was negative and Flagyl was DC'd.
On [**8-12**] the patient was noted to have increased WBC 34->45, rising Cr 1.1->1.9, and worsening mental status.
Patient started on Linezolid in context of increased WBC's on UA and urine Cx [**8-9**] growing VRE.
White count eventually trended down, but patient remained altered and NG tube placed.
CXR showed bilateral infiltrates consistent with aspiration PNA as well as pleural effusions.
Patient does have an apical opacity of unclear significance on CXR but no pulmonary symptoms.
Blood cultures without growth so far.
#) Acute Renal Failure: Pt Cr increased sharply on [**8-12**] and urine output declined dramatically.
Ischemic EKG changes consistent with demand ischemia resolved.
CT head was negative.
A "[**Doctor Last Name **]" was heard during movement with nursing and a LUE X-ray was negative.
INR trended up above 2.0, and responded to vit K, coming back down to 1.5.
His platelets were trended and remained stable in the ICU.
Patient does have an apical opacity of unclear significance on CXR but no pulmonary symptoms.
Blood cultures without growth so far.
Heme/onc was consulted and felt it was most likely [**1-10**] to leukemoid reaction and WBC had improved to 9 upon discharge.
This may be stress response or inflammation related to arm injuries.
Blood cultures remained negative.
WBC jumped to mid 40's in the ICU, trended down after resolution of shock.
Received vit K to decrease INR towards a goal of 1.2.
LFT's were elevated but stable in the ICU.
Information was obtained from PatientwebOMR.
