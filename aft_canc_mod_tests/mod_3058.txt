Urine Cx [**4-20**]: NEGATIVE .
Stool Cx [**4-25**] and [**4-26**]: NEGATIVE =================== Imaging: [**4-21**] CT non-contrast abdomen and pelvis: Mild acute diverticulitis of the proximal sigmoid colon with no evidence of perforation or surrounding collection.
Suggest further evaluation with a triphasic CT scan or MRI for further characterization.
[**4-23**] CT non-contrast abdomen and pelvis: Mural thickening at descending/signoid colon junction, with associated diverticulae and pericolic fat stranding, mildly progressed from prior study.
A follow-up colonoscopy to exclude neoplasm is recommended.
Two non-specific tiny pulmonary nodules could be followed up with chest CT in six months.
[**4-23**] RUQ U/S: Notable for 2 cm mildly hypoechoic lesion along the right hepatic dome, with suggestion of vascularity seen on color Doppler imaging, does not have son[**Name (NI) 493**] features of a simple cyst or hemangioma and is concerning for metastasis.
This lesion was not seen on remote MRI from [**2150**].
[**4-29**] CT w/contrast abdomen and pelvis: Portal vein thrombosis involving the right posterior and anterior portal venous branches and partially extending into the main portal vein.
[**5-4**] CT w/contrast abdomen and pelvis: Interval progression of portal venous clot into the left portal vein.
On [**4-29**] he underwent repeat Abd CT given intermittent low grade temps to 100.4 and was found to have multiple liver microabscesses and a new portal vein thrombosis.
CT scan on [**4-29**] demonstrated portal vein thrombosis involving the right anterior and posterior divisions and extending into the main portal vein.
Following 2 days of INR > 2.0 heparin gtt was discontinued and the patient was discharged with [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital **] clinic follow-up.
Due to falling Hct he received a total of 2 units PRBCs and Hct responded appropriately.
He was seen by the gastroenterology consult service recommends a colonscopy which could not be done as an inpt given acute diverticulitis.
Patient underwent liver spleen sulfur colloid scan which showed no focal liver abnormalities suggesting this lesion represents focal nodular hyperplasia.
# ENLARGED PELVIC NODULE: Seen on ABD CT [**4-23**] and described as 1.8 short axis soft tissue nodule in the left pelvic side wall.
# INDETERMINATE RENAL LESIONS: Seen on abdominal CT from [**4-23**].
# PULMONARY NODULES: Seen on CT ABD [**4-23**] and described as two tiny non-specific pulmonary nodules.
It is suggested that these are followed up by chest CT in six months.
# Hyponatremia: Serum sodium trended down to 130.
Patient treated with IVF and serum sodium trended up to a normal range.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Home solutions  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Escheria Coli and Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium Bacteremia, Lower gastrointestinal bleeding, Diverticulitis, Acute on chronic renal failure, Hyperglycemia, Hyponatremia .
Blood test showed a bacterial infection in your blood (bacteremia) and you were treated with antibiotics.
Your blood sugar was significantly elevated and you were treated with intravenous fluids and insulin.
Because of this we did a repeat CT scan of your abdomen on [**2157-4-29**] which showed small abscesses in your liver and a clot in the portal vein to the liver.
We also started you on blood "thinner" medications (heparin and coumadin) and monitored your blood levels until the activity of coumadin was therapeutic for two days (goal INR = 2.0 - 3.0).
On the day prior to discharge we obtained a repeat abdominal CT scan to assess intereval changes in the liver micro-abscesses and portal vein clot.
This scan demonstrated decreased size of the abscesses but increased size of the portal vein clot.
New Medications: -Ceftriaxone 2g IV Every 24 hours (last dose [**2157-5-26**]) -Metronidazole 500mg Every 8 hours (last dose [**2157-5-26**]) -Warfarin: you will need to take 7.5mg tonight and then 5mg daily starting on Friday (tablets are 2.5mg each).
