The patient had had persistent fevers and chills and was planned for a CT A/P this am.
She had a previous lactate of 1.0, and has not had significant recent weight loss.
Her last colonoscopy was 3 years ago with diverticulosis, but no other major findings.
The CT scan obtained showed free air in the abdomen with a possible perforation in the transverse colon.
She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2103-11-26**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2103-11-29**]):    NO GROWTH.
IMAGING: CT TORSO([**2103-11-16**]):    CHEST: Comparison is made with the previous study done [**2103-11-12**].
The pancreas, adrenal glands and      left kidney are unremarkable.
Renal ultrasound ([**2103-11-16**]): 1.
Right renal mass consistent with renal cell carcinoma with tumor thrombus in the right renal vein and IVC as was seen on the torso CT of [**Location (un) 620**] of [**2103-11-15**].
Limited Doppler examination due to the patient's body habitus.
Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2103-11-21**]): The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular function appears to be preserved but is difficult to assess given poor acoustic windows.
CXR ([**2103-11-23**]):  Right PICC line ends at mid SVC.
CXR ([**2103-12-2**]): Rotated positioning.

A CTA was deferred in setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
She was asymptomatic during both tachy and bradycardic episodes, and blood pressures remained stable.
EKG prior to discharge confirmed sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Patient's baseline creatinine is 1.5-1.8 and peaked at 3.2.
Infectious work-up was negative with negative blood, urine, and pleural fluid cultures.

In addition, you had a fast heart rate which required cardioversion by the cardiologists, but medications helped control your heart rate.
MEDICATION CHANGES: - START amiodarone for better heart rate control - CHANGE carvedilol to METOPROLOL for better heart rate control - CHANGE felodipine to AMLODIPINE for blood pressure control - START vancomycin, through [**2103-12-10**] for pneumonia - START zosyn, through [**2103-12-10**] for pneumonia - START dabigatran for prevention of blood clots  Followup Instructions: Department: GENERAL SURGERY/[**Hospital Unit Name 2193**] When: TUESDAY [**2103-12-18**] at 3:30 PM With: ACUTE CARE CLINIC with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 600**] Building: LM [**Hospital Ward Name **] Bldg ([**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) [**Location (un) **] Campus: WEST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name **] Garage  Department: CARDIAC SERVICES When: TUESDAY [**2103-12-25**] at 11:00 AM With: [**Doctor First Name 900**] [**Name8 (MD) 901**], M.D.
