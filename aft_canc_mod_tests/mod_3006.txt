She went to her PCP who evaluated her with blood work and an EKG which where initially unremarkable, however given the peristence of her symptoms, she was referred for an urgent MRI which was completed this morning.
This non-contrast study demonstrated 2 large cerebellar masses.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Strength 5-/5 in left triceps otherwise [**5-1**] throughout.

CTA [**6-3**]: There are some prominent veins along the superior margin of the cerebellar lesions, particularly on the left.
NCHCT [**6-5**] Post Op Postoperative changes related to cerebellar mass.
Minimal hemorrhage in the surgical bed  NCHCT [**6-6**]: 1.
MRI Head [**6-6**]: 1.
Stable tonsillar herniation since CT examination performed earlier the same day.
She was initiated on treatment with decadron 4mg q6 hours for edema and monitored with q 4 neuro checks.
A CT of the head was done immediatley post-op, which showed persistent and marginally worse vasogenic edema abutting the brain stem.
Her dex was weaned every other day.
Post operative head CT was stable.

These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
