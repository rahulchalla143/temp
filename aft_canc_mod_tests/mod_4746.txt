Exploratory laparotomy, drainage of abdominal abscess.
Upper endoscopy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 83752**] is a very pleasant 54-year-old gentleman who presents to the general surgery service for a duodenal resection and re-anastamosis.
He had an "upset stomach" and also had a GI bleed, which showed a duodenal tumor.
He has had a CT scan, which confirms this.
He has had no further bleeding, but he has been somewhat tired since the blood loss.

IMAGING: [**2131-3-29**] MRCP: WETREAD - The pancreatic duct in the body and tail show no abnormality; the pancreatic duct in the head and periampullary region cannot be assessed due to susceptibility artifact from multiple sutures  Micro/Imaging: [**2131-3-22**] H.pylori equivocal by EIA; Per Micro, repeat test in 2 weeks.

His immediate post-op course was complicated by development of significant leakage from the surgical wound with seroma seen on CT scan [**2131-3-12**] (persistent large fluid collection in the duodenal resection bed, suggestive of seroma with a hemorrhagic component).
He was intubated in TICU, and returned to OR on [**2131-3-13**] for abdominal washout and evacuation 4L of purulent fluid.
H.pylori Ab was sent in order to evaluate for a possible ulcer as the cause his upper GI bleed, which was equivocal (per Micro, repeat testing should be done in 2 weeks --[**2131-4-5**]).
His hematocrit remained stable after oversewing of the anastamosis and was 29 at discharge.
MRCP with secretin stimulus showed normal response to secretin with expected transient caliber change in the pancreatic duct in the head and body, although the study was limited due to artifact from surgical sutures.
Despite difficulty with A. fib with RVR during this hospitalization as noted above, his rate was well-controlled on Metoprolol at time of discharge.
Echo on [**2131-3-6**] showed EF>55%.
