His medication levels were monitored and were therapeutic.
A Cardiology consult was placed and they assisted in management of his a-fib.
An ECHO showed normal cardiac function.
His oxygen saturations remained stable.
This pain persisted so a CTA of his chest was obtained and it revealed a right middle lobe subsegmental pulmonary embolus.
Plain films were done to evaluate his neoesophagus and these were negative for dilatation.
An EGD was obtained and this showed an ulcer at the anastomotic site.
The erythema improved and he was discharged on no antibiotics.
His cultures throughout his hospital stay have all been negative.
He was transitioned to coumadin and on the day of discharge his INR was 2.1 so he did not need Lovenox injections.
He will follow up with his PCP's coumadin clinic for INR checks.
