------ ------ IMAGING:  [**8-7**] Renal Doppler FINDINGS: The exam is somewhat limited due to patient's intubated status and inability to breath-hold.
The right upper, mid, and lower pole arterial waveforms are normal appearing with brisk upstrokes; although resistive index could not definitely detected with the upper pole, resistive indices for the mid and lower poles were 0.78 and 0.80 respectively.
The left main renal artery shows a normal-appearing waveform with a peak velocity of 63 cm/sec.
Resistive indices for the upper, mid, and lower poles were 0.75, 0.79, and 0.78 respectively.
RIB UNILAT, W/ AP CHEST LEFT [**8-4**] There are patchy opacities throughout both lungs.
Please see report of [**2110-8-3**] chest x-ray for a more complete discussion of this abnormality.
ECHO [**8-1**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quanitfied.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-3-14**], biventricular cavity sizes are somewhat smaller and left ventricular systolic function is more dynamic.
The heart rate is also much higher and image quality is suboptimal on the current study.

Spine MRI - multiple studies, see OMR  Brief Hospital Course: Prior to patient's ICU courses, the patient underwent laminectomy x2 and hemilaminectomy x2 and he was subsequently transferred to the BMT unit for further management of his multiple myeloma.
He was electively intubated, to be able to tolerate imaging studies and bronchoscopy/BAL.
He had a CT chest on [**7-17**], which showed diffuse peribronchovacular GGO's, signs of aspiration, and increased bilateral lymphadenopathy.
Concurrent abdominal imaging also revealed a 5.8cm infrarenal AAA.
Multiple chest imaging studies were obtained, as follows: CXR showed new lower lobe opacity with concern for new bacterial lobar pneumonia vs aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.
CT chest showed nodules concerning for malignancy, but this likely an indolent process which would not account for abrupt worsening of oxygenation over 12 hour course.
He underwent a lung nodule biopsy which showed focal organizing pneumonitis, chronic inflammation, and non-necrotizing granulomas.
Additional CT finding of ground-glass opacities c/f PNA improved on more recent CT. Pt is at risk for PE with known DVTs, hematologic malignancy, & recent interruption in systemic anticoagulation for lung biopsy; heparin was started but stopped when the pt developed dropping Hct with guaiac positive stools suspicious for GI bleed (see below).
Bronchioalveolar lavage and sputum cultures were negative including AFB, [**Month/Year (2) 1074**], and PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 151**] the exception of one BAL culture which grew yeast after 5 days.
Beta-glucan, galactomannan and PCP PCR labs were pending at time of transfer.
Other possibilities considered and ruled out included: retroperitoneal bleed (negative CT Abdomen), bleeding into or rupture of pre-existing 5.8cm AAA (asymptomatic, vital signs stable), or bleed into recent spinal surgical site (surgical site appeared non-concerning).
Plan from GI was to prep patient for a colonoscopy in the near future if the capsule study is negative, but this did not happen as patient's Hct stabilized at baseline 27 and melanotic stools resolved.
After his lung biopsy on [**7-11**], heparin gtt was restarted.
Given concern for metastases to spinal cord and pulmonary nodules, pt was prepped twice for radiation therapy; the first time he was unable to tolerate lying flat due to respiratory distress.
WBC trending down, 23.3 at time of transfer, s/p several days of broad-spectrum antibiotics including antivirals and antifungals.
ECG without ischemic changes.
# GI bleed: Transferred from BMT unit for melanotic stool and tachycardia with a Hct 21, requiring 3U PRBC on the day of transfer to maintain Hct >25.
Previous capsule study did show non-bleeding AVMs in small bowel.
Pt required intubation for push enteroscopy which did not identify any bleeding source.
Plan was for follow-up balloon enteroscopy to evaluate the small bowel, but no further GI procedures were performed because patient was persistently ventilator-dependent post-procedure with mental status changes (see below).
Through the ICU course, melena continued & hematocrits were checked every 8 hours.
The patient was transfused as necessary to meet transfusion goals: Hct >25 and platelets > 50.
Initial CXR showed no infiltrate and pt was afebrile.
However, CT chest showed progression of right basilar tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities with new areas of consolidation at both bases, progression of ground-glass opacities in the left and right upper lobes, and several progressively cavitating parenchymal lesions concerning for septic emboli, Nocardia, Pseudomonas or Tuberculosis.
Extensive infectious workup was performed in consultation with Infectious Disease consult service.
Vanc/Zosyn were stopped given serial negative sputum and blood cultures were negative but restarted when pt spiked fevers to 102-103; sputum cultures sent at that time grew GPC and GNR.
He was also continued on Voriconazole for yeast+ sputum cultures; this was transiently changed to micofungin but changed back to voriconazole when patient's respiratory status further deteriorated after the GI procedure.
In addition, a BAL culture sent on [**2110-7-18**] eventually grew AFB positive; cultures were sent to the state lab for speciation.
These were all stopped when serial sputum smears were AFB-negative.
Urine lytes suggested a pre-renal state.
Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis.
However, his mental status gradually declined such that he did not require sedation on the vent, and on examination was unresponsive and unable to follow commands.
Melanotic stools and dropping Hct continued to require blood and platelet transfusion.
Hematopathology examination showed a mass of plasma cells with necrosis.. .
Rib series showed no fractures, focal or sclerotic lesions.
Patient's BPs were stable with systolic pressures in the 110s-120s.
