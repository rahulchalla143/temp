At the OSH a CT head demonstrated R sided thalamic bleed and a CTA was negative for AVM or vascular malformation.
She had a systolic blood pressure in 170s.

CT HEAD [**2156-8-31**]: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of right thalamic hemorrhage, now with a small amount of intraventricular extension.
CT HEAD [**2156-9-2**]: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of right posterior internal capsule and thalamic hemorrhage.
3D time-of-flight, T2 images and contrast-enhanced MP-RAGE sequences do not suggest an associated DVA or vascular malformation.
TTE (echocardiogram) [**2156-9-3**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 90894**] [**Known lastname 90895**]-[**Known lastname 90896**] is a 46 yo woman with PMHx significant for borderline HTN (SBP of 135's) who presented from an OSH with a thalamic hemorrhage.
Her initial SBP was 170.
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was a potential etiology, but her imaging was not entirely consistent with this.
She may not fly for at least 10 days, aroudn [**9-10**]  [] Cardiac - EKG showed no signs of LVH, so we got an echo to help determine if she had any systemic signs of hypertension.
The echo showed no major abnormalities.
NO PENDING STUDIES  TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: [ ] She needs a repeat MRI/MRA in 1 month to evaluate the possibility of a vascular malformation/cavernoma underlying the hemorrhage.
However, your blood pressure has not been elevated and has not required medication while you were here in the hospital.
You will need to have physical therapy when you get to [**Country 14635**], as well as a repeat MRI in 1 month.
