RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2110-2-7**]):       10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.
Piperacillin/tazobactam sensitivity testing available on request.
A CT torso revealed bilateral pleural effusions right > left.
Her respiratory issues continued and a left pigtail catheter was eventually placed and her breathing improved as her effusions decreased.
She had a CTA which was negative for PE but multiple loculated effusions were noted in the right chest.
Her chest tubes were removed once the drainage decreased and her port sites were healing well.
A BAL was sent from her bronchoscopy which grew Klebsiella  pneumoniae.
Her WBC was 28K and she was treated with Zosyn, Flagyl and Ceftriaxone.
That was not done during this admission as her blood pressure was in the 100-118/70 range and she will follow up with cardiology in 4 weeks for another evaluation.
From a GI standpoint, her barium swallow showed no evidence of a leak and her liquid diet began on [**2110-1-30**] with a gradual increase to fulls then soft foods in small amounts.
She will continue her cyclic tube feedings along with a soft diet and she will keep a log of her oral intake so that her feedings can be adjusted at her first clinic visit.
