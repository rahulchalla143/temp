Hypoxemia: Per anesthesia, pre-op eval revealed baseline saturations of 89%.
Her CXR demonstrated decreased lung volumes on left side in particular with low ET tube as well as poor visualization of left hemidaphragm indicating that hypoxia could be due to decreased ventilation of the left lung or hidden PNA.
Nifedipine was added on POD#21 when blood pressures continued to be elevated on one [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Creatinine bump was noted on POD#3.
Her creatinine at highest level was 9.6.
At time of discharge the creatinine was 3.2.
Elevated TSH - On POD#18 ([**11-24**]) the patient was found to have TSH elevated to 7.6 and her cortisol was elevated to 28.
Her TSH should be rechecked 5-6 weeks after her hospital discharge.
Blood sugars continued to range between 47-80s and responded only minimally to oral glucose tablets, D50 boluses and glucose gel.
Her fingersticks were in suboptimal control in mid 100s at time of discharge.
Prophylaxis - Pt was kept on Subcutaneous heparin TID for DVT prophylaxis as well as pneumoboots.
Postoperatively, she had anemia with hematocrits stable at 22-24%.
The patient was started on iron TID with colace even though iron studies did not reflect iron deficiency anemia.
Followup Instructions: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6745**], PA, from Interventional Radiology will arrange removal of hemodialysis tunnelled- port catheter when INR is < 2.0.
