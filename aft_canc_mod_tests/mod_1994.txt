The patient was seen in the clinic earlier today, had an absolute neutrophil count noted in the 1,400s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.4, blood pressure 118/70, heart rate 82, respiratory rate 20, saturating 96% on room air.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA: White count 1.8, hemoglobin 9.6, hematocrit 27.8, platelets 117,000.
The differential included 71% neutrophils, 19% lymphocytes, no bands, 1% atypicals, with an ANC of 1,340.
Sodium 141, potassium 3.6, BUN 33, creatinine 1.0, calcium 9.2, phosphate 2.1, magnesium 2.1.
The urinalysis was negative for evidence of a UTI.
The urine culture collected on [**2107-5-2**] showed no growth.
Blood cultures drawn on [**2107-5-2**], anaerobic and aerobic bottles, showed no growth.
Chest x-ray showed a patchy increased opacity of the left lung base, which could have represented early pneumonia, as well as linear opacities in the retrosternal regions, more suggestive of discoid atelectasis and/or scarring.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted following blood cultures and started on empiric antibiotic therapy of ceftazidime 2 grams IV as well as filgrastim/Neupogen 300 mg subcutaneously q.d.
On [**2107-5-4**], upon the recommendation of the Medical Team, the patient had a CT of the chest, abdomen, as well as the pelvis with contrast.
Based on these findings, the patient was taken a urine sample for Legionella serology as well as an induced-sputum sample that was also done.
On [**2107-5-6**], bronchoalveolar lavage specimen tissue samples were sent to Microbiology and Cytology.
In the meantime, a sputum Gram's stain showed positive +3 gram-negative rods, +2 gram-positive cocci.
The neutrophil counts had been trending down with an ANC noted at 10,050 on [**2107-5-6**].
Along with the rigors and hypoxia, the patient's blood pressure went down to the 90s or 50 systolic, as low as 70/40.
The patient was given IV Demerol for rigors as well as a 200 cc bolus of normal saline which increased the systolic blood pressures to 102.
It was noted that he needed 5 liters of nasal cannula for saturations to increase to 90% and a 5 liter face mask was placed to increase his saturations to 96%.
Meanwhile, upon transfer, the sputum Gram's stain for cryptococcus antigen was negative, Legionella antigen was negative, and a PCP stain was negative times two.
An acid-fast bacteria smear was negative.
An EKOH stain showed no evidence of fungal organisms.
On [**2107-5-7**], CT Surgery was consulted regarding the possibility of video-assisted thoracoscopy for collection of lung biopsy samples.
A CT of the chest was done and repeated on [**2107-5-8**] and showed worsening ground glass opacities consistent with either hemorrhage versus pulmonary edema versus infection.
Based on these findings and upon IDs recommendations, the patient had a bone marrow aspirate biopsy as well as aspirate for cultures that was done on [**2107-5-9**] without any difficulty, with tissue sent for gram stain / Cx, fungal and AFB stain/Cx, as well as C7 kappa, DD10, DD19, DD20, lambda, CD5 as well as CD3 were all sent as well as cultures.
On the same day, [**2107-5-9**], the patient also had a video-assisted thoracoscopy which was done along with the left upper lobe and left lower lobe wedge biopsy.
The patient was intubated status post the procedure and sedated while the cultures on [**2107-5-8**] showed less than 10 polys, with less than 10 epithelial cells again with an oropharyngeal flora as well as moderate yeast.
Initial findings were suggestive of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, question of etiology, infectious versus inflammatory, hemorrhage noted, suggested to be in the region of intra-alveolar level.
The patient also had a quantitative IgG analysis which showed IgG of 435, IgA 64, IgM 54.
Meanwhile bone marrow biopsy Gram's stain were negative for micro-organisms.
Left lower lobe Gram's stain showed positive 1 polys and no micro-organisms.
On preliminary cultures, viral cultures for the lung biopsy showed negative viral cultures, negative viral results (no growth) for left upper lobe as well as left lower lobe biopsies.
Cultures were so far negative to growth.
Urine cultures showed negative growth and immunofluorescent test for PCP was negative.
The patient's blood pressure remained stable without pressors.
During the hospital course, the patient needed multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells as well as platelets during the hospital stay to maintain a hematocrit above 21, as well as a platelet count above 50,000 as per transfusion protocol guidelines for being in the ICU for evidence of active bleeding.
On [**2107-5-13**], bone marrow biopsy results showed no evidence of any viral inclusions nor granulomas.
Acid-fast bacteria stains as well as fungal stains and CMV stains were all negative.
Bone marrow biopsy also showed a negligible amount of B cells as well as mature T cells which did not suggest an active lymphoma process.
All microbiology cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage from video-assisted thoracoscopy as well as bone marrow cultures have all been negative up to this date.
Serial blood cultures were obtained daily.
It was noted also that the patient's white blood count as well as absolute neutrophil counts had been rising for a current count of 7.5 as well as an ANC of 6,530 on [**2107-5-15**].
Of note, serial blood cultures from [**2107-5-15**] were all noted to be negative.
Also, there was a question of whether collection of the positive blood cultures is accurate with respect to septic versus aseptic collection technique.
Per the patient's observation, it was noted that the person collecting the blood cultures did not perform collection in an ideal aseptic technique.
Sensitivities noted that cultures grew out Staphylococcus coagulase negative sensitivities which was suggestive of Staphylococcus epidermidis, likely a contaminant.
Blood cultures up to date were negative.
All cultures from lung samples as well as marrow biopsy samples were negative for any evidence of infection.
Also, overnight, on [**2107-5-15**], the patient had a temperature spike to 101.5.
His temperature spike was concerning in light of the patient having an indwelling Foley catheter as well as an arterial line as well as other peripheral lines in place.
Blood cultures grew sensitivities for Staphylococcus coagulase negative, methicillin-sensitive and sensitive to gentamicin, vancomycin, Rifampin, as well as tetracycline.
A repeat U/A was not suggestive of a UTI.
