Immediate postoperative course c/b hypertension, tachycardia, and hypoxia transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.
Cardiac enzymes were drawn times three to rule out myocardial infarction and they were negative.
A TTE was obtained on POD3 and results are above.
Patient was found to be intermittently in atrial fibrillation and recommendations per cardiology were followed-beta blocker, amlodipine were titrated to appropriate heart rate and blood pressure.
Patient's vital signs were routinely monitored.
The patient's fluid balance was balanced as per above.
Patient with baseline COPD and patient received intermittent CXR's in addition to monitoring of vital signs to achieve adequate oxygen saturation.
Foley was maintained throughout admission and will be continued following discharge given sensitive fluid balance issues and need for urine output monitoring.
Geriatrics assisted in management of his blood sugars which  Hem/Onc: Patient transfused as per above to maintain adequate cardiopulmonary function.
Pathology showed T1N1aMx colonic adenocarcinoma.
