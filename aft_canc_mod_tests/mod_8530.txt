Cholangiocarcinoma found when CT scan [**9-27**] demonstrated a 2.4 x 3.2 cm diameter low attenuation mass surrounding the common duct, extending into the region of the pancreatic head and through the retroperitoneum down to the renal vein and encasing the proximal portal vein as well as the hepatic artery.
There was evidence also that the duodenum was encroached upon by the tumor, although not circumferentially.
Based on the CT findings he was deemed unresectable.
Hct 19 at OSH from 26 yesterday.

Delayed images demonstrated no opacification of the portal vein, suggesting occlusion of this vessel.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
Angiogram # 2 IMPRESSION: Selective arteriograms were performed in the celiac, SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] without signs of active bleeding.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist  CT Abd/Pelvis: 1.
Evaluation of vasculature could not be performed due to lack of IV contrast.
Abdominal Ultrasound [**6-2**]: IMPRESSION: Large amount of ascites in all four abdominal quadrants with marking of right lower quadrant for paracentesis to be performed by clinical staff.
Abdominal Ultrasound [**6-6**]: Limited evaluation of the four abdominal quadrants was performed.
An emergent angio did not find the source of bleeding.
A repeat angio showed no clear target for embolization as the tumor was well-vascularized, so given that the patient was likely to rebleed and that the next bleed would be untreatable, the decision was made to make the patient CMO.
He may also need a flexiseal or other similar stool management system if he begins having bright red blood per rectum.
