Admission Date:  [**2162-7-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2162-7-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2091-6-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 71-year-old man with history of metastatic carcinoid tumor of bronchial origin (metastatic to bone and liver) status post multiple chemotherapy treatments, resection of tumor from left upper lobe of lung in [**2146**], chemoembolization of liver metastases ([**2152**], [**2153**]), and is currently on a clinical trial of an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor affecting VEGFR/PDGFR families, SU011248, also known as Sugen and concurrently taking Sandostatin.
When his fatigue became intolerable, his wife brought him to an outside hospital, where he was found to be hypotensive blood pressure 77/52, and tachycardic, heart rate 122.
He was given fluid boluses, had a single episode of syncope with a blood pressure of 56 systolic/palp.
He received 1 unit of packed red blood cells and his vital signs stabilized.
ALLERGIES:  Horse serum - the patient develops a rash.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.0, blood pressure 100/60, heart rate 121, respirations 16, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air.
Abdominal examination was benign.
Liver margin palpated 1 cm below costal margin.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 11.3, hematocrit 23.7, platelets 125.
INR 1.6, PT 15.4, PTT 25.4.
BUN and creatinine 54 and 0.8.
ALT 232, AST 688, alkaline phosphatase 159, total bilirubin 0.8.
Lactate dehydrogenase 1870, CK 1553.
With regards to his maroon-colored stool, it was felt that although this could be secondary to the upper GI bleed, a lower source of bleeding should be ruled out and a colonoscopy is recommended as an outpatient.
LFTs continued to trend down throughout his admission as blood pressure remains stable.
On day of discharge, ALT was 50, AST 28, alkaline phosphatase 151, and a total bilirubin of 1.4.
Anemia:  Patient was found to have a very low hematocrit of 23 on admission.
His hematocrit remained above 30 a few days prior to discharge.
Although he was sating well on room air at rest, it was noted that the patient had an ambulatory saturation in the mid 80s.
A chest x-ray was done, which initially was negative for an infiltrate, however, clinical suspicion was high.
A CT scan was performed which showed left lower lobe pneumonia.
He remained afebrile and by the day of discharge had an ambulatory oxygen saturation greater than 95%.
Pneumothorax:  On admission to the Intensive Care Unit, a right sided triple lumen catheter was placed, which resulted in a small pneumothorax, which was stable throughout his hospital per serial chest x-rays and CT scans.
Rule out myocardial infarction:  When patient first presented to the Intensive Care Unit, he had elevated CKs and an electrocardiogram showing ST depressions in the inferolateral leads.
He proceeded to rule out for myocardial infarction via serial enzymes and follow-up electrocardiograms.
