[**2174-5-6**] Non-contrast Chest CT - IMPRESSION: 1.
Multiple CT scans noted evidence of PNA, and possible multilobar PNA.
All viral and bacterial cultures returned negative.
PE was felt less likely given his CT findings, negative LE U/S, and therapeutic INR on Coumadin.
His creatinine began to rise with IV diuretics, and he begun on hemodialysis because of his volume overload and continued hypoxia.
CARDIOVASCULAR:     Coronaries - the patient c/o some atypical chest discomfort on admission, and was noted to have flat CK's but positive Troponins as high as 0.5 in setting of ARF.
Pump - repeat TTE noted stable EF.
His rate was slighly elevated in high 90's on admission, which was controlled with BB.
