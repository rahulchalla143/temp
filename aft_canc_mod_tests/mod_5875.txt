He had a CT angiogram of his chest, which showed very large bilateral pulmonary emboli.
He had MRI of the head, which showed a new dural brain metastases and a question of surrounding bleeding.

Chest x-ray showed possible left lower lobe infiltrate.
Findings on the MRI showed a new focus dural-based tumor 1  x 1.5 cm in the right parietal region with similar contrast to the original right temporal-dural based tumor, which was resected.
The patient also had a CT of the head, which showed status post craniotomy and tumor resection, methacrylate prosthesis and surgical changes, hyperdense enhancing foci anterior to the right frontal lobe and right occipital lobe concerning for a small foci of hemorrhage or tumor; MRI followed that CT scan.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient was admitted with delta MS thought to be secondary to his hypoxia from the PE and possibly from new or old brain metastases.
At that time a CT scan of the head was obtained due to the concern over mental status changes.
Repeat CT scan showed no increase size in the bleed.
The patient's neurological examination remained stable.
Of note:  The patient had an EEG performed on the 5th when there were concerns about mental status changes.
He was complaining of some difficulty swallowing, which was evaluated by a video speak, and swallow study and the patient passed this.
