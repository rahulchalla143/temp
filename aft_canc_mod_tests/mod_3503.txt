A micropuncture needle was exchanged for a 4.5 French micropuncture sheath.
Venogram was obtained with injection of contrast through the micropuncture sheath, which demonstrated thrombosis extending from the popliteal vein to the femoral vein.
A micropuncture needle was exchanged for a 4.5 micropuncture sheath.
A venogram was obtained with injection of contrast through the micropuncture sheath, which demonstrated thrombosis extending from the popliteal to femoral vein.
Venogram after mechanical thrombectomy was obtained with injection of contrast through right vascular sheath, which demonstrated multiple stenoses/residual mural thrombosis of the left popliteal and left femoral vein.
After then, balloon dilatation was again performed from the IVC to both femoral veins with 8 mm x 4 cm balloons.
Iliac venogram was then obtained through a 5 French Omniflush catheter which was placed in the left common iliac vein, which demonstrated marked improvement in the thrombosis and venous flow from the iliac vein into the IVC.
CT LOW EXT W/O C BILAT  [**2189-2-10**] 12:02 AM CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH NO IV CONTRAST ADMINISTRATION: The visualized portion of the lung bases demonstrate dependent atelectatic changes and a small bilateral pleural effusion.
CT OF PELVIS WITH NO IV CONTRAST ADMINISTRATION: The bladder has thickened wall and contains a Foley catheter.
CT OF THE Lower extemity: There is significant amount of fluid accumulation within the scrotum and penis related to venous obstruction.
