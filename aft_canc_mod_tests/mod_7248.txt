MRI showed pathologic fracture at the L5 level and compression of L3 and narrowing of L5-S1, but no real cord compression.
Postoperative vital signs revealed the patient spiked a temperature to 101 and was fully cultured.
Her hematocrit was 26.
Her hematocrit was stable at 38.2.
On [**2197-10-30**], the patient had elevated coagulations with an INR of 3.2, PT of 21.5, and PTT of 38.7.
Her hematocrit was stable post transfusion at 39.8.
Gastrointestinal recommendation was to monitor vital signs q.1h.
and monitor hematocrit q.8h.
On [**2197-10-30**], the patient dropped her saturations into the 80s.
Chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.
Her troponin level came back at 6.2, down to 3.9, and then 3.2.
Creatine kinases were 73, 51, and 50.
Her transthoracic echocardiogram showed overall left ventricular systolic function to be moderately depressed, normal right ventricular size, and left ventricular size was within normal limits.
It was a suboptimal study but was consistent with anterior septal and apical hypokinesis.
Her estimated ejection fraction was at 40%.
It was unclear from their point of view why she developed congestive heart failure; although, they felt it was multifactorial, and the goal of treatment was to wean her from the mechanical ventilation as soon as it was tolerated and diurese her.
Vital signs remained stable, and she was afebrile.
From a cardiac standpoint, the patient was started on captopril with the dose increased and then switched to lisinopril 20 mg p.o.
Pulmonary wise, the patient was on 2 liters with saturations in the high 90s.
Vital signs were stable.
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] 20 mEq p.o.
