Was taken to [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital where CT showed significant increase in edema with 1cm midline shift.
Sensation: Intact to light touch throughout.
Incision is clean, dry, intact without erythema, induration or exudate(uses dissolvable suture material)  Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission: [**2140-3-10**] 08:53PM   WBC-6.8 RBC-3.37* HGB-11.6* HCT-33.4* MCV-99* MCH-34.5* MCHC-34.8 RDW-15.2 [**2140-3-10**] 08:53PM   PLT COUNT-222 [**2140-3-10**] 08:53PM   PT-14.5* PTT-33.5 INR(PT)-1.3* [**2140-3-10**] 08:53PM   ALT(SGPT)-69* AST(SGOT)-36 ALK PHOS-125* TOT BILI-0.4 [**2140-3-10**] 08:53PM   CALCIUM-9.0 PHOSPHATE-4.0 MAGNESIUM-1.9 [**2140-3-10**] 08:53PM   GLUCOSE-131* UREA N-17 CREAT-0.7 SODIUM-138 POTASSIUM-4.0 CHLORIDE-102 TOTAL CO2-28 ANION GAP-12 [**2140-3-10**] 10:48PM URINE  COLOR-Yellow APPEAR-Clear SP [**Last Name (un) 155**]-1.026 [**2140-3-10**] 10:48PM URINE  BLOOD-NEG NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-NEG GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-NEG BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-1 PH-6.0 LEUK-NEG  Labs on Discharge:  Imaging: MRI Head [**3-10**]: FINDINGS: The enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe is enlarged in size, measuring 3.0 AP x 3.2 mL x 3.2 TV on today's study.
IMPRESSION: Limited post-contrast T1 imaging performed for surgical planning purposes and demonstrates slightly increased size of surrounding edema in left frontal lobe enhancing mass.
Head CT [**3-11**](Post-op): FINDINGS: Postoperatively, there is a small amount of pneumocephalus adjacent to the left frontal craniotomy.
MRI Head [**3-13**]: Sagittal and axial short TR, short TE spin-echo imaging was performed through the brain.
After administration of 20 cc of Magnevist intravenous contrast, axial imaging was performed with long TR, long TE fast spin-echo, FLAIR, gradient-echo, diffusion, and short TR, short TE spin-echo technique.
Sagittal MP-RAGE imaging was performed and reformatted into axial and coronal orientations.
MRI of head was done showing mass recurrence in the left frontal lobe with significant vasogenic edema.
On [**3-14**] he was started on heparin infusion to bridge his treatment for pulmonary emboli(previously diagnosed), with a goal ptt 50-70.
However, do to his previously known pulmonary embolus, he was kept in the hospital until [**3-17**] until his warfarin therapy was instituted at a therapeutic level of [**2-9**].
?You will not need an MRI of the brain as this was done during your acute hospitalization.
