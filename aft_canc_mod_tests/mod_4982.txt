bilateral lower extremities cool to mid chin Skin: multiple ecchymosis left side stable Neuro: awake, alert  Pertinent Results: [**2168-6-21**] WBC-7.2 RBC-3.43* Hgb-10.0* Hct-31.0 Plt Ct-250 [**2168-6-20**] WBC-10.4 RBC-3.46* Hgb-10.4* Hct-30.9 Plt Ct-200 [**2168-6-15**] WBC-8.9 RBC-3.76*# Hgb-11.4*# Hct-34.0 Plt Ct-157 [**2168-6-21**] Glucose-145* UreaN-16 Creat-0.5 Na-141 K-3.7 Cl-105 HCO3-26 [**2168-6-19**] Glucose-144* UreaN-14 Creat-0.5 Na-135 K-4.1 Cl-103 HCO3-22 [**2168-6-16**] Glucose-133* UreaN-22* Creat-0.6 Na-138 K-3.8 Cl-104 HCO3-25 [**2168-6-21**] Calcium-8.0* Phos-4.1 Mg-2.1  CXR: [**2168-6-21**]: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position.
Comparison is made with the next preceding AP single chest view obtained seven hours earlier during the same day.
There is no definite evidence of ectopic gas, but note is made of limitation of gas evaluation in this study.
[**2168-6-18**]: Chest and abdomen CT IMPRESSION: 1.
Suboptimal evaluation for leak at the primary anastomosis due to lack of oral contrast.
Six month follow-up CT is recommended for surveillance.
If continuous clinical concern for leak, barium swallow study can be done when felt as clinically appropriate to evaluate further.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted following her successful Laparoscopic [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy with laparoscopic feeding jejunostomy placement.
Following the procedure she was transferred to the ICU intubated overnight on CPAP, PS12 PEEP 5, FIO2 50% with oxygen saturations of 100%.
On POD 1 she was extubated with oxygen saturations of 92-94% on nasal cannula.
Her chest film showed small effusion, atlectasis.
Chest CT showed no anastomic leak, possible pulmonary infection versus inflammation.
Respiratory:  aggressive pulmonary toilet, mucolytic nebs, incentive spiratometer and ambulation she titrated off supplemental oxygen on POD6 with oxygen saturations of 95-97% on room air.
Drains and tubes: NGT tube was flushed to maintain patency and removed on POD3 Anastomose JP drain and Right chest tube were removed on [**2168-6-21**] once esophagus study was negative for leak.
Esophagus study was done on [**2168-6-21**] which showed no leak.
