He describes them as presenting with pressure at the top of his head and at times has had blurred vision that accompanies it.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger,   Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission: [**2138-4-18**] 08:49PM BLOOD WBC-9.1 RBC-5.19 Hgb-15.6 Hct-45.1 MCV-87 MCH-30.0 MCHC-34.5 RDW-12.9 Plt Ct-353 [**2138-4-18**] 08:49PM BLOOD Neuts-76.3* Lymphs-17.5* Monos-4.8 Eos-0.8 Baso-0.7 [**2138-4-18**] 08:49PM BLOOD PT-12.9 PTT-27.3 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2138-4-18**] 08:49PM BLOOD Glucose-95 UreaN-15 Creat-1.1 Na-145 K-4.1 Cl-107 HCO3-27 AnGap-15 [**2138-4-19**] 02:24AM BLOOD Calcium-9.6 Phos-2.4* Mg-2.1  Labs on Discharge: XXXXXXXXXXXX  ---------------- IMAGING: ---------------- MRI Brain from OSH: Large right temporal and parietal mass with severe vasogenic edema.
CT head [**2138-4-21**]: A large right temporal and parietal, with severe vasogenic edema is unchanaged, measuring 7.5 x 6.6 cm.
Repeat MRI with ASL perfusion and spectroscopy might be considered to identify a region for possible biopsy, if clinically indicated.
These findings are better appreciated on the recent head CT examination from [**2138-4-21**].
MUSCULOSKELETAL: Diffuse mild FDG-avidity of the bony marrow is seen throughout the spine and pelvic bones (SUVmax 4.04).
CT Head [**4-23**](Post-biopsy) IMPRESSION: Expected postoperative changes from right-sided frontal bone burr hole and biopsy.
MRI Head [**4-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Unchanged mild right uncal herniation  CT HEAD [**4-26**]: 1.
He had an episode of bradycardia to the 30s, given the amount of edema and midline shift that was observed on his MRI and concern for brainstem compression, he was sent for a STAT head CT that was stable when compared to previous.
After a meeting with the patient and the family, plans were made to perform a stereotactic brain biopsy on [**2138-4-23**].
In preparation and for staging purposes, a PET scan was scheduled for [**4-22**] and showed decreased FDG avidity.
He was scheduled and underwent CT guided stereotactic biopsy on [**4-23**].
Post-operatively he did well; he had no post op hemorrhage on CT scan, and had a non focal exam.
He remained in the ICU until his blood pressure could be less than 160 off any drips.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
?You will not need an MRI of the brain as this was done during your hospitalization.
