Name:  [**Known lastname 1028**], [**Known firstname **]                       Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 8308**]  Admission Date:  [**2149-9-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2149-9-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2068-1-25**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Location (un) 571**]  ADDENDUM:  The patient was planned for discharge on [**2149-9-20**] to a acute rehabilitation center, however, the patient's thyroid function tests were reviewed and the patient was found to be hypothyroid.
The patient remained in the hospital with the initial intent to conduct further thyroid workup, however, later on [**2149-9-20**], the patient had a precipitous drop in her hematocrit from 28 to 23 of unclear etiology.
The patient was without evidence of bleeding and responded appropriately to 2 units packed red blood cell transfusion.
A stat head CT following the episode was with evidence of multiple areas of intra and extracranial hemorrhage involving the left frontal, left parietal, left occipital, right frontal, and the right temporal lobes.
The patient's facial droop, dysarthria, and generalized confusion largely resolved within 30 minutes following the seizure episode.
A repeat head CAT scan redemonstrated the multiple supratentorial, parenchymal, and subdural hemorrhages.
A follow-up MRV of the head showed no evidence of venous spinous thrombosis and the patient was maintained off of anticoagulation.
However, on [**2149-9-25**], the patient underwent a subsequent speech and swallow evaluation with improved results.
A follow-up video swallowing study demonstrated adequate airway protection and the patient's diet was advanced to thin liquids and pureed the night prior to discharge.
A chest x-ray was notable for a question of lower lobe infiltrates and the patient was started on empiric antibiotics (ceftriaxone and Flagyl).
The patient's Dilantin level has been followed on a daily basis since the initial Dilantin loading and remains within the therapeutic range.
