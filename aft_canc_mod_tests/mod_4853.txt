- CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Confluent ground-glass opacities are noted at the lung bases, right greater than left, with relative subpleural sparing.
The left, right, and main portal and hepatic veins, splenic vein, superior mesenteric vein, and IVC appear patent.
Fibroid uterus, with 6 cm left and 1.7 cm right adnexal cysts.
Transvaginal ultrasound was performed to better visualize the uterus, endometrium and adnexa.
Left ovarian hemorrhagic cyst - 6 week follow-up ultrasound is recommended to ensure resolution.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
[**2161-2-4**] - Abdominal X ray (portable): Paucity of bowel gas may be due to vomiting, but small-bowel obstruction of fluid-filled loops cannot be excluded.
If there is high clinical concern for obstruction, CT is the next appropriate imaging step  Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo F with HIV, Hepatitis C and history of substance abuse presented with LLQ pain and fever to 101.3, cough, diffuse myalgias.
Patient's initial presentation with acute onset of fever, cough, myalgia and malaise with interstitial infiltrate on CXR is concerning for atypical pneumonia.
Laboratory studies did not reveal any specific pathogen for the pneumonia, but she was started on Levaquin and Flagyl initially.
ABG was obtained after Ativan administration showing 7.37/44/92/26 on 100% NRB (ABGs unable to be obtained earlier in the day).
Pt's serial ABGs showed progressively worsening hypoxia and hypercarbia (7.34/49/76 -> 7.34/51/55) and she was unable to tolerate BiPAP due to extreme anxiety (which did improve her oxygenation to O2 sats of 99%) so she was intubated in the ICU.
Many viral studies/serologies were sent, all negative to date.
Fibroid uterus and adnexal cysts were seen on CT scan so pelvic ultrasound was obtained which showed right simple ovarian cyst and left hemorrhagic ovarian cyst.
The cysts should resolve over the course of several cycle and ultrasound follow-up after 6 months could be considered for further evaluation.
Her [**Month (only) 1096**] CD 4 count was 484 and viral load was 53,200.
# Hepatitis C.  Her viral load was 6.1 million copies in 12/[**2160**].
CT abdomen showed borderline fatty infiltrate and mild splenomegaly, raising concern for portal hypertension, although splenomegaly could be reactive given recent illness.
This was noted on CT scan for concern of intra-mammary lymph node.
Patient was advised to have a follow-up breast exam and mammography  # Left ovarian hemorrhagic cyst, incidental finding.
Patient as advised to have outpatient ultrasound study to evaluate for resolution.
Medications on Admission: Prozac 20 mg 3 tabs daily Vistaril 50 mg 2 tabs daily Suboxone - 8mg once a day calcium and vitamin D 600/400 1 tab [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Medications: 1.
Calcium 600 + D(3) 600-400 mg-unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - community-acquired pneumonia  Secondary diagnosis - HIV - Hepatitis C - Left lateral breast nodule - Left ovarian hemorrhagic cyst - Uterine fibroid - bipolar disorder   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
A CXR showed signs of likely pneumonia which we treated with antibiotics.
A CT scan of your abdomen was performed to evaluate your pain- this showed fibroids of your uterus and an ovarian cyst.
On the CT imaging, a small left breast nodule was noted.
