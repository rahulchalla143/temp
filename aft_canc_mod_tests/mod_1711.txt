Upper endoscopy showed non-bleeding large gastric ulcer.
Biopsy not obtained in setting of upper GI bleed.
CT abdomen obtained showed large gastric ulcer with focal mass, lymph node deposits concerning for gastric cancer.
Her hematocrit then came back to around 30 and was stable.
Findings during her operation reveled that the gastric mass was likely not a malignancy, rather a giant, benign gastric ulcer.
On HD# 11 she was noted with fevers >101 and was cultured, chest xray was done showing a consolidation in her right lung base.
Her abdominal staples will be removed when she has follow up in [**Hospital 2536**] clinic next week She will also need to follow up with her PCP next week for general care.
