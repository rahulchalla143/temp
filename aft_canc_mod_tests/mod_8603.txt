Swan-Ganz hemodynamic monitoring through the right internal jugular.
A bedside echocardiogram showed severely depressed left ventricular function with preserved right ventricular function.
Catherization revealed severe stenosis at the left main trifucation.
A catherization in [**2115**] showed severe 3 vessel disease.
Persantine-MIBI on [**4-18**] showed fixed inferior and inferiolateral perfusion defect.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 19% on persantine-MIBI [**2124-4-18**].

EKG [**2124-4-21**]: Normal sinus rhythm with ST elevations in III and aVF and ST depressions in I, aVL, V2-V4.
Echocardiogram (limited views) [**2124-4-21**]: Severely depressed left ventricular function (EF ~ 15-20%).
Hemodynamics: He had a cardiac index of 2.1 on dopamine.
His right ventricular end diastolic pressure was elevated at 20 mmHg, and his wedge was elevated at 30 mmHg.
Speech and Swallow Assessment [**2124-5-4**]: Moderate delay in laryngeal valve closure with associated aspiration and penetration as described above.
CXR [**2124-5-11**]: IMPRESSION: Increasing cardiomegaly with worsening moderate pulmonary edema denote cardiac decompensation.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 87 year-old gentleman with known 3 vessel coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure EF 25%, aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.9 cm2), diabetes who presented with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction secondary to collateral insufficiency.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with complaints of chest pain and found to have significant CAD based on a Persantine MIBI test, however a cardiac catheterization could not be performed given the severe acute on chronic renal failure.
The following day, a family meeting was held with the patient and both the patient and the HCP agreed to become [**Name (NI) 3225**].
His CKs peaked at 1351 and trended down post-intervention.
A chest x-ray showed marked increased in bilateral pulmonary edema.
Mental status waxed and waned but was generally declining and urine output poor in setting of aggressive diuresis.
A balloon pump was placed at the time of catheterization and he was continued on dopamine.
He had developed a fever to 101.3 and a white count of 22.
He did not respond to a cortisol stimulation test and was started on stress dose steroids.
All cultures remained negative.
Since his cardiac output had improved, the balloon pump was removed.
Over the next few days, he became afebrile, his white count trended down, and he was weaned from all pressors.
Subsequently, he dropped his pressures and became bradycardic.
Congestive heart failure: A post-intervention echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15%.
It was felt that the benefit of angiography with possible intervention outweighed the risk of contrast nephropathy.
Post-procedure, his creatinine trended down with adequate urine output.
As he was weaned off of the pressors and as his blood pressure improved, his urine output increased with a subsequent decrease in his creatinine.
Plain films confirmed that his intestines were full of stool.
After several days, a abdominal plain film showed dilated colonic loops.
An abdominal CT confirmed the dilated loops of bowel and showed no signs of obstruction.
Repeat abdominal plain films showed no further dilatation.
Aortic stenosis: He has severe aortic stenosis with a gradient of 64 mmHg and a valve area of 0.9.
Diabetes: His blood glucose was slightly elevated during the initial periods of septic shock.
Eventually he underwent video speech and swallow evaluation which revealed delayed laryngeal closure; it was recommended that he try ground solids and thickened liquids.
