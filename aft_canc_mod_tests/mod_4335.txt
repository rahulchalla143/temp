She was then readmitted [**2134-8-20**] and discharged [**2134-9-6**] for an ileus which improved when narcotics were stopped.
This was transitioned to lovenox, which was held [**9-3**] and [**9-4**] for dark maroon stool and a Hct drop (29.6 --> 24.8) with concern for lower GI bleed.
At the time she was transfused 1 unit of RBCs and her Hct stabilized and it was then thought that she had had a bleeding hemorroid.
Her lovenox was restarted on [**9-5**] and her Hct was stable at 26 on discharge.
In the ED, initial vs were: BP  110/60 HR 60 RR 14  Sats 96% RA.
on exam she was found to be lethargic.
NG lavage caused epistaxis and revelaed initial bright red blood which cleared with 250 cc.
Hct was 26.7 then repeat 23.3.
Of note, the patient's Multiple Myeloma - which was diagnosed a year and a half ago - was recently thought to be unamenable to chemotherapy by oncology given the pt multiple medical issues including poor PO intake and anasarca.

There are no focal abnormalities or electrographic seizures recorded  [**9-30**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: .
Given the patient's progressive renal insufficiency, with serum creatinine rising from 1.2 to 2.3, this most likely represents retained gadolinium administered for the [**9-26**] MR study.
On arrival to the medicine floor, she was breathing 26 times per minute and satting 98% on 2L NC.
Her warming complicated by subclincal seizures noted on EEG which improved on anti-epeleptic medication.
She was followed by neurology until [**9-23**] when it was recommended that IV Keppra be continued and further EEG monitoring or imaging was not required.
An MRI showed no acute infarction, hemorrhage or specific evidence of anoxic brain injury, but was not stroke protocol due to renail failure.
Blood cultures came back positive for VRE.
Positive blood culture from [**10-12**] grew VRE and pt was transitioned to linezolid, then daptomycin as above.
By [**10-21**] Neo requirement was 3.5. .
## Pneumothorax: s/p PEA arrest the patient was hypotensive on norepi, breath sounds diminished on R.  CXR showed tension PTX on R, subcutaneous air on L and pneumomediatinum.
The chest tube was later removed and repeat chest x-ray showed resolution of the pneumothorax.
Her lung exam was unremarkable.
She improved on treatment with reduced work of breathing and reduced oxygen requirement as she was satting 98% on room air.
EF 35-40% on TTE from [**8-31**].
Repeat CXR demonstrated improved airspace disease with stable or slightly worsening pleural effusions.
## Afib with RVR: There was difficulty controlling her heart rate in the setting of poor po intake, infection, electrolyte abnormalities.
Electrolytes were checked regularly and repleted.
Pt did not cardiovert but HR 100-120. .
Her Hct on the floor was 32.1.
After the patient's second PEA arrrest she did have guaiac negative stools and a slowly falling hematocrit that did require intermittent blood transfusions.
A bedside swallow study recommened a video swallow study which revealed gross aspiration.
She later was started on ceftriaxone for urinarlysis c/w UTI; however, this was discontinued after urine cultures were negative.
A bladder ultrasound was negative for fungal ball.
