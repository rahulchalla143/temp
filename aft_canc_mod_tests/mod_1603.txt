Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Repeat CT head upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] showed stable SAH and R SDH from prior scan on [**2-8**].
In ED patient was HD stable (67, 133/78, 17, 100%) except for temperature of 102.2 for which he was given a dose of levofloxacin/flagyl.

Imaging: Head CT ([**2118-2-12**]): The subdural collection in the right temporal lobe measures 9.3 cm and is not significantly changed compared to the prior study.
Blood layering within the atria of the ventricles bilaterally has decreased.
Repeat Head CT [**2118-2-13**]: not yet read, no obvious change.
CXR [**2118-2-12**]: No acute CP process.
The lack of IV contrast limits evaluation of the vasculature.
EKG [**2118-2-12**]: NSR at 65, nml axis, nml intervals, Q wave in V1 and V2, ST elevation V1-V3 with 0.5 st depression in V5, poor R wave progression.
Repeat ECG [**2118-2-13**]: new deep TWI V2-V4 with ST elevation >1.0-1.5 with Q waves (not new).

KUB [**2118-2-15**]: There are multiple dilated small bowel loops throughout the abdomen.
Had abdominal CT scan overnight [**2-16**] also wet read + for SBO, surgery following, possible surgical intervention [**2-16**].
INR 1.4, will give vitamin K 2mg sc.
Patient was taken to OR on [**2-16**] for exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions.
Serial KUBs were obtained which continued to show post-op ileus, his abdomen became less distended .
Dilantin level [**2118-2-16**] 10, will give additional 100mg iv with am dose, monitor level, goal [**11-26**], [**Month/Year (2) 862**] precautions.
On admission thought possible UTI on UA from [**2-11**] but cx negative, blood and urine cultures from OSH pending.
[**2-12**] blood, urine and sputum cultures pending (GPC on sputum only), vs. intracranial bleed.
Possible retrocardiac opacity on CXR but could be sterile aspiration with [**Month/Day (4) 862**] leading to pneumonitis with fever but no infection.
Subsequent CT's of the  Head w/o contrast showed no increase in the size of the SDH/SAH, the most recent of which was on the am of [**2-27**].
ECG from [**2118-2-13**] reviewed with cardiology fellow, thought to represent dynamic changes in the setting of STEMI at some point between [**2-7**] and [**2-11**], CE's trending down previously, repeat [**2118-2-13**] at 2100: CK: 70 MB: not done trop 0.09.
Repeat CE's [**2-14**]: CK 60 MB not done trop 0.10, on tele an atrial arrhythmia but no other abnormalities, aspirin through [**2-15**], held [**2-16**] as NPO/surgery, BB (IV, titrated up 1/10), statin (held while NPO).
Coagulopathy: INR elevated but improved [**2-14**], elevated again [**2-16**].
Urinary retention: Noted after foley d/c [**2-13**], possibly exacerbated to paraphimosis but he was able to void from 430cc->260cc (PVR 110) on [**2118-2-14**] so foley not replaced, start tamsulosin 0.4mg po qhs [**2-14**] but foley replaced [**2-15**] when SBO developed.
FEN: NPO, maintenance IVF, monitor with QID accuchecks and SSHI given dexamethasone and potential for hyperglycemia.
