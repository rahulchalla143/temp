No LOC but does admit to vague gait abnormalities   Past Medical History: NIDDM HTN hypercholesterolemia prostate cancer PVD   Social History: 40 pack year history [**3-12**] drinks daily   Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Exam upon discharge: Patient is A & O x 3.
Pertinent Results: MRI Brain [**2137-8-29**]: FINDINGS: There is a right frontal lobe area of edema identified with a 2.5 x 2 cm mass and enhancing mass.
Evaluation of the remaining brain is limited due to artifacts.
No distinct enhancement is seen in this region, but as suggested above, the evaluation is limited.
For better evaluation of the brain, a repeat study with sedation is recommended.
CT Torso [**2137-8-30**]:  CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with the largest nodal conglomerate in the subcarinal station measuring approximately 3.0 x 2.8 cm, with a mass effect on the bronchial tree and possibly esophagus.
CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are bilateral enhancing adrenal masses, measuring 2.9 x 1.6 cm on the right and 2.8 x 2.0 cm on the left, consistent with metastatic masses.
The abdominal loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable, there is no evidence of small bowel obstruction.
CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable.
The smaller right frontal and the left posteromedial temporal lesions described on MRI of the brain [**9-2**] are not appreciated on this non- contrast CT.
Right frontal lobe edema with 5 mm leftward shift of midline structures and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, similar to slightly improved in comparison to the preoperative CT of [**8-29**], [**2137**].
He had a CT torso which revealed: bilateral adrenal masses, T12 lucency, hilar lymphadenopathy.
His neuro exam remained stable the following day and he was transferred to the neurosurgical floor.
The patient had an MRV of the pelvis to assess for DVT on [**9-5**].
Please measure blood sugar levels at home.
You will need an MRI of the brain with/without gadolinium contrast (Cyberknife protocol).
