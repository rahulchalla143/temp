A CT on [**2-4**] showed progression of disease and also showed the development of a large right pleural effusion which has been causing her progressive SOB.
During the recent admission a thoracentesis revealed malignant pleural effusion.

ECHO [**2110-2-19**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2110-2-19**] 4:30 AM IMPRESSION: Right hydropneumothorax with decreased air and increased fluid components.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2110-2-20**] 3:52 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-19**], there is little overall change.
Chest tube is in place on the right with fluid collecting in the region of previous pneumothorax.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2110-2-21**] 7:23 AM The Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of mid SVC.
Unchanged right Port-A-Cath  PATHOLOGY: Pleural fluid [**2110-2-7**]: POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.
Pleural biopsy [**2110-2-17**]: Metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, see note.
Note: Immunoperoxidase studies performed on a bone biopsy (S11-[**Numeric Identifier 101196**]) suggested a gastrointestinal or pancreatic/biliary origin.
MICROBIOLOGY: BCx [**2110-2-19**]: negative C diff toxin [**2110-2-26**]: ______________  Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo F w/ adenocarcinoma w/ presumed involvement of her bones, uterus and lung but currently of unknown primary s/p planned admission for right pleurodesis and pleurex catheter placement complicated by pneumothorax and new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
However, as her resting heart rate increased to 90s on diltiazem monotherapy (max daily dose), metoprolol was added back.
Outpatient workup for identification of primary tumor has been unsuccessful so far.
Her blood pressure was well controlled on diltiazem as monotherapy.
Transitional issues: [ ] Further monitoring and management of her atrial fibrillation, discussed with Atrius cardiology, pt does not need to follow up with cardiology, however, if pt is difficult to treat, PCP can refer as outpatient.
