Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close monitoring given concern for her brisk LGI bleed.
She underwent a tagged RBC scan which was not revealing in terms of her bleeding source.
Her c-scope was finally performed on [**5-15**] which did not show any active bleeding, but with diffuse diverticulosis throughout her entire colon, and multiple polyps.
Bleeding scan was done on [**5-17**] showing GI bleeding, beginning at approximately 40 minutes, most likely at the hepatic flexure of the colon.
The pt was evaluated by surgery and taken to OR [**5-18**] for a R hemicolectomy due to persistent bleeding and transferred to the recovery room in good condition.
ECG revealed no acute changes and cardiac enzymes were negative.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed at 45-50%.
Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
Pt's H&H was stable throughout the hospital course and she did not require the need for blood transfusion.
ECG again showed no acute changes and cardiac enzymes were negative.
However on [**5-24**], pt vomited and an NG was placed which drained 6 liters.
On [**5-27**], pt had WBC of 23 and a wound infection was discovered.
Her abdominal wound was opened up in 2 places and drained pus.
On discharge, pt had WBC of 10.2 and wound was no longer draining and had granulation tissue  Medications on Admission:  MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: ASA 325 mg PO QD Plavix 75 mg PO QD Percocet prn Norvasc 10 mg PO QD Sertraline 25 mg PO QD Imdur 60 mg PO QD Ambien prn Lipitor 80 mg PO QD Toprol 100 mg PO QD HCTZ 25 mg PO QD   Discharge Medications: 1.
