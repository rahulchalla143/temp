# Left leg ruptured hematoma: The patient's lowest hematocrit was 22.
After being transfused 3 units PRBCs, his hct rose to 31 and remained stable thereafter.
When the patient's hct was stable and there were no signs of further bleeding, he was transfered out of the ICU to the BMT service.
Goal INR is 2-2.5.
His INR on [**Year (4 digits) **] was 1.4. .
Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Sust.
Release 24 hr PO TID (3 times a day).
The bleeding from your wound was severe enough to necessitate blood transfusions.
After being transfused, your blood levels (hematocrit) rose and stabilized.
On the floor your red blood cell count was followed closely but you did not require transfusions.
