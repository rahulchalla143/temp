An echocardiogram at that time showed inferior and posterior as well as basal and septal ischemia and he was referred for cardiac catheterization.
He consequently underwent another cardiac catheterization in [**2140-12-29**], which showed branch vessel coronary artery disease, mild mitral regurgitation and mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%.
The patient's most recent echocardiogram was in [**2142-5-28**].
He did experience chest discomfort with exercise, but his electrocardiogram was nondiagnostic.
Given the increasing symptoms of chest pain on exertion, the patient underwent another cardiac catheterization prior to admission, on [**2142-8-30**].
This cardiac catheterization showed three vessel disease and left main coronary artery disease with normal left ventricular function and moderate diastolic dysfunction.
He was afebrile with a heart rate of 60, blood pressure 132/72, and oxygen saturation 99% in room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  No bruits, no jugular venous distention.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, right groin without hematoma, no oozing, no bruits status post cardiac catheterization.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission hematocrit was 31.6, white blood cell count 6.7, platelet count 179,000, prothrombin time 12.6, partial thromboplastin time 27.7 and INR 1.1.
Glucose was 174, BUN 27, creatinine 0.7, sodium 136, and potassium 4.6.
His last cardiac catheterization performed on the day of admission showed 70% stenosis of the left main, 50% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery and 30% stenosis of the right coronary artery with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%.
His physical examination remained unremarkable.
His hematocrit was 26.8 on postoperative day number two.
The patient's insulin regimen was tightened to gain better control of blood sugar levels.
He remained afebrile with a stable heart rate and blood pressure and adequate oxygenation.
His chest tube and pacing wires were removed as was his urine catheter.
