A bedside echo showed a new pericardial effusion.
A CTA showed no PE but was significant for a small-mod pericardial effusion as well as some pericardial enhancement, small right-sided pleural effusion, increased mediastinal lymphadenopathy (?mets vs. CHF).
His initial ABG is 7.46/41/77, lactatea 1.6.
DM type 2 5.

VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOWING EVALUATION: The oral phase was normal.
The pharyngeal phase was notable for delayed initiation of swallowing; however, there is normal hyoid excursion and laryngeal elevation after initiation of the swallow.
Limited fluoroscopic images of the thorax show the gastric pull through.
Limited fluoroscopic images also demonstrate degenerative changes in the cervical spine.
ECHO [**2133-1-9**] .
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2133-1-4**] CTA CHEST .
His CXR was suggestive of worsening pleural effusion.
CXR on [**1-7**] showing less fluid overload s/p lasix compared to [**1-6**].
# Pericardial effusion: New moderate pericardial effusion (2cm) without tamponade physiology seen on echo on [**2133-1-5**].
Pulsus at presentation was 9.
His pulsus was followed q6h and remained between [**9-4**].
They reccommended repeat echo on [**1-9**].
PPD was also placed.
