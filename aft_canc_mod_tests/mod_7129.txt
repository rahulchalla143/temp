EKG at the time showed ST segment elevation in the inferior leads.

EKG following the arrest showed sinus tachycardia, with less then 1mm ST elevations in inferior leads and persistent ST depressions in anterior precordial leads.
At that time, the patient was noted to have a potassium of 2.4 as well.
In the OR, patient at 17 cc of urine output, and was given 2200 cc IV fluids.

PCXR ([**2184-10-4**]): IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lungs are low in volume but clear.
Tip of the endotracheal tube is no less than 22 mm above the carina, with the head in neutral or extension.
PCXR ([**2184-10-5**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-4**], the endotracheal tube has been removed.
Echo ([**2184-10-5**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
EKG [**2184-10-4**] (#1): sinus tach with inferior and lateral ST elevations EKG [**2184-10-4**] (#2): sinus tach with new Q-waves in inferior leads  Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, the pt is a 54 yo F who presented initially on day of admission for an elective hysterectomy for symptomatic uterine fibroids.
Of note, during this incident, pt had 2 bedside echocardiograms done showing some inferior wall hypokinesis, and EKG's showed initially some ST elevations that resolved but with some new inferior Q waves.
She may need further allergen testing once the acute phase of her anaphylaxis has resolved.
# VT arrest:  The patient developed VT/VF following her anaphylactic shock and administration of IV epinephrine, and was noted to have some wall motion abnormality on bedside Echo, EKG changes, and elevated troponin.
Her follow-up echocardiogram showed resolution of the wall motion abnormality, her EKG returned to baseline, and her troponin quickly downtrended to within normal range.
They also did not think that her EKG was concerning for risk factors of sudden cardiac death.
However, they did recommend that she be on an Aspirin for the next 2 weeks and to have a follow-up Exercise-stress echocardiogram in 2 weeks with appropriate Cardiology follow-up.
Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital for an elective GYN surgery for fibroids, however, prior to your sugery, your developed an anaphylactic allergic reaction with low blood pressure to an antibiotic (cefazolin) and also developed a cardiac arrest, requiring CPR and electric shocks.
You will need to have a stress echo test performed prior to your appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Cardiology.
