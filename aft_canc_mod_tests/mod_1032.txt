#[**2182-10-18**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-17**], the patient has taken a substantially better inspiration.
#[**2182-10-17**] UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with probable inferior hypokinesis (LVEF= 45-50%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-12-28**], left ventricular function is probably similar but views are suboptimal for comparison.
Upon initial arrival to the medicine floor, pt's SBP > 200 and patient complained of chest pressure/discomfort and so trigger was called.
EKG showed no changes, and CE pnd.
hydralazine 25mg pushed and new BP was SBP 140s.
Patient was asymptomatic and EKG showed no acute changes.
Patient was also found to be in DKA w/ ketones in urine, blood glucose above 400, and anion gap of 23.
ABG showed metabolic acidosis c/w DKA.
CXR showed increased pulmonary congetion but no source of infection.
Cardiac enzymes were trended and peaked.
His LVEF currently 45-50% ([**2182-10-19**]).
Cardiac catheterization was not performed as it was thought this was more likely demand ischemic (type 2 MI) in setting of hypertensive urgency.
He was continued on ISS (home dose is Lispro Protam & Lispro [HUMALOG MIX 75-25] 28 units in AM, 9units in PM).
His blood pressures were better controlled with lisinopril 40 daily, coreg 25 [**Hospital1 **], amlodipine 5 mg po qdaily and chlorthalidone 25 daily.
Stable from CT abdomen in [**2176**].
Recommend 24 hr urine metanephrines and serum renin and aldosterone as outpatient with refractory hypertension.
