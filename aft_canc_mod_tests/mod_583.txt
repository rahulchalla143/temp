In the Emergency Department, the patient had a temperature of 95.6 F.; heart rate of 60; blood pressure of 160/110; respiratory rate of 16, saturating 100% O2 on two liters nasal cannula, in moderate distress with several episodes of vomiting.
EKG showed new T wave inversion in II, III and AVF with no ST elevation or depression.
CK enzymes were 74, troponin less than 0.3.
CT scan was done which showed a Type B aortic dissection originating at the left subclavian to the level of the diaphragm.
The patient was started on heart rate and blood pressure control with Nipride and Esmolol.
Before the central access was obtained, his heart rate increased to the hundreds and his systolic blood pressure into the 210s.
The patient at that point resumed on his intravenous blood pressure medications with a decrease in his systolic blood pressure to 120s and heart rate to the 70s.
Type 2 diabetes melitis with last hemoglobin A1C of 5.2; history of increased fingersticks secondary to dietary indiscretion.
History of RPR positive with treponemal antibody positive ([**2098-5-1**]).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Upon presentation to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, his examination revealed he was afebrile; heart rate 84; blood pressure 143/80; respiratory rate 27; oxygen saturation 92% on room air.
Cardiac examination is regular rate, normal S1, S2.
Neurologic examination is alert and oriented; motor strength five out of five bilaterally.
LABORATORY:  His labs on examination were white blood cell count of 5.2 with a differential of 52, neutrophils 40, lymphocytes 7, 9 monos, and 1 eosinophil.
Hematocrit 35.5, platelets 337, INR is 1.1.
Sodium 135, potassium 3.2, chloride 101, bicarbonate 23, BUN 22, creatinine 1.2.
Glucose is 405.
Calcium is 8.5 with free calcium of 1.04.
Albumin is 3.4.
ALT is 61, AST 73, alkaline phosphatase 121, amylase is 88, total bilirubin 1.1, lipase 39, lactate 1.8.
Repeat CK was 31 with troponin of 0.4.
EKG shows T wave inversions in II, III and AVF with normal sinus rhythm at 60.
CT scan of the abdomen shows: 1.
[**Location (un) 11916**] type B aortic dissection beginning just distal to the left subclavian artery takeoff extending to the diaphragmatic hiatus.
Chest x-ray shows stable compared with prior in [**2098-5-31**].
Abdominal ultrasound with fatty infiltration of the liver, hyper dense focus in the gallbladder wall with no stones.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was medically managed for his aortic dissection with blood pressure and heart rate control.
The goal was a systolic blood pressure between 120 and 130 and heart rate between 60 to 70.
On transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient's Esmolol drip was changed to Labetalol for dual blood pressure and heart rate control with titration and the patient was continued on Nitroprusside drip.
The Nipride drip had to be restarted secondary to increase in the patient's systolic blood pressure to the 170s despite his oral regimen.
The patient developed pain secondary to bladder irrigation and his systolic blood pressure would rise during his spastic pain episodes.
The Metoprolol was increased to 75 mg three times a day and the patient was given one dose of 5 mg of Metoprolol when his systolic blood pressure reached the 170s.
On the above medications, the patient had adequate blood pressure and heart rate control, however, his systolic blood pressure then began to fall; the patient was given repeated fluid boluses with minimal improvement.
His anti-hypertensive medications at that point were withheld and his blood pressure began to rise but still remained less than one systolic blood pressure of 130.
At this point, evaluation for change in his blood pressure was undertaken and the patient was found to have Staphylococcus aureus sepsis, explaining the hypotension.
When the patient's blood pressure began to rise with clinical improvement of his sepsis, he was restarted on low dose Metoprolol and adjusted accordingly for elevation in his heart rate and systolic blood pressure.
Further blood pressure control was curtailed secondary to the patient choosing to leave the hospital against medical advice in order to attend to personal affairs.
When the patient left, his systolic blood pressure was within goal range, between 120 to 130 and his heart rate was less than 70; however, it is not known HOSPITAL COURSE:w his blood pressure will change as he continues to improve from his sepsis and as he begins to have increased activity.
He had a repeat CT scan during his hospital course secondary to decreased urine output, which showed no change in the aortic dissection since presentation.
The case was discussed with Cardiothoracic Surgery who recommended that the patient follow-up with CT scan in one month in order to evaluate.
The patient was monitored on Telemetry through his hospital course.
Repeated electrocardiograms showed no ST wave changes.
Urinalysis showed increased white blood cells and many bacteria, but also squamous epithelial cells.
Culture was negative for growth.
Chest x-ray showed new bibasilar bilateral increased opacities, left greater than right with pleural effusions.
His blood cultures then came back with four out of four bottles of Gram positive cocci.
Sensitivities on the blood cultures came back with Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
One set of surveillance blood cultures were able to be drawn which were no growth as of the last hospital day.
Discussion with Infectious Disease regarding whether the patient should follow-up with echocardiogram:  Given that the source of infection was likely line and it was removed, they did not feel that an echocardiogram was required.
At that point, the patient was reevaluated via CT scan for ischemia to the renal artery which was negative.
The patient's urine output improved, but then the patient developed frankly bloody urine with clots.
He was placed on an insulin drip with titration to keep his blood sugars between 80 to 120.
Given the chest x-ray findings which were felt to be likely secondary to atelectasis, given that the crackles on his lung examination cleared with the coughing, the patient was started on incentive spirometry.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient had his electrolytes repleted p.r.n.
It was explained at length to the patient and to his son that his blood pressure was not under adequate control yet and that he was still recovering from sepsis.
