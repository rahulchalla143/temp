Five days ago, patient fell at home, and was evaluted at an OSH with head CT without any acute bleed noted.
She then presented again to an OSH, with repeat HCT due to persistent HA, but still no bleed seen.
She had a CT head which showed a 3 cm IPH above thalamus with extension into third ventricle, and evidence of likely impending herniation.
Her labs revealed pancytopenia, decreased fibrinogen, and concern for DIC.

[**2143-2-2**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2143-2-3**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: Large right thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension, and the overall volume of hemorrhage appears increased from the previous studies.
She was given further products to maintain her plts greater than 50K.
She was sent for a stat repeat head CT which showed worsening of the bleeding within the ventricles.
An autopsy was not wanted by the family.
She was monitored for DIC labs (which she did develop), and was given further blood products (FFP, plateletes, cryoprecipitate).
