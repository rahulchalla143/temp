The patient was brought to the CT suite and endotracheal anesthesia was induced.
After cleansing and draping in normal sterile fashion, under CT fluoroscopic guidance, 17-gauge outer needle was advanced into the tumor and three biopsies were obtained using an 18-gauge coaxial system.
The energy was ramped to [**2115**] mA, and individual applications of 10 minutes, 6 minutes, 4 minutes and 2 minutes were applied.
After two applications of radiofrequency energy, an interval contrast-enhanced study was performed which showed 95% tumor necrosis with a clear apparent enhancing rim along the superolateral border of the neoplasm.
After this, the cluster electrode was reinserted and further applications of energy were performed.
A final unenhanced examination showed no overt evidence of residual tumor, but did reveal some post- ablative gas formation and post-hydrodissection perirenal fluid.
She had a biopsy of a L Kidney mass c/b retroperitoneal bleeding.
She had a transfusion after dropping her HCT followed by a R CVA w/L weakness on [**2122-4-25**].
She had a recent admission in [**1-2**] for pneumonia.
EVALUATION: The examination was performed while the patient was seated upright in the bed with the help of the Bulgarian interpreter.
She will need an NG tube for a few days and a repeat bedside swallowing evaluation with the Bulgarian interpreter on Thursday.
Repeat bedside swallowing evaluation is scheduled for     9:00 Thursday morning with the Bulgarian interpreter.
[**2122-6-12**] CT head FINDINGS: The multiple prior lacunar infarcts, in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and right frontal lobe, and the right basal ganglia and in right thalamus.
[**2122-6-16**]  CT abdomen and pelvis:  CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: Views of the lower mediastinum and lung bases demonstrate a previously identified ascending aortic aneurysmal dilatation measuring 51 mm in AP diameter and 52 mm in right left diameter.
The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands are unchanged and adrenal adenoma is again seen on the right.
The stomach, duodenum, small bowel, and large bowel are normal in caliber and unremarkable.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, uterus, adnexa are within normal limits.

She was also noted to be hypotensive, with SBP in 90s; her blood pressure responded to 110s after 500mL NS.
CT abdomen [**4-23**] showed moderate amount of left perirenal, retroperitoneal, and pelvic hemorrhage.
Repeat CT [**4-26**] showed that RP bleed was stable.
She subsequently remained hemodynamically stable and her hematocrits remained stable.
Her antihypertensives were also held in setting of tenuous volume status 2/2 blood loss, but were restarted without complication on [**4-27**].
A follow up CT on [**6-16**] showed resolution of the RP bleed.
A head CT showed a new area of hypoattenuation involving the right basal ganglia, concerning for acute infarct.
A MRI/MRA showed acute partial right MCA infarct involving the right frontal lobe and subcortical region with pooled blood, with no evidence of occlusion of MCA trunk.
She was seen by the stroke service, aspirin and coumadin held, and her neurologic exam followed closely.
Carotid U/S demonstrated no stenosis, and a repeat head CT on [**4-26**] demonstrated new areas of hyperattenuation within the region of the right basal ganglia concerning for small petechial hemorrhagic conversion in the region of infarction, but no significant mass effect or midline shift.
A bedside S&S on [**4-27**] confirmed absence of gag reflex.
A follow up S&S study demonstrated improvement, and she was started on ground solids and thickened liquids with aspiration precautions.
3) Renal mass: Pathology consistent with renal cell carcinoma, probably chromophobe type.
A TTE with bubble study on [**5-28**] did not show any evidence of an anatomical shunt.
She was encouraged to use an incentive spirometer, though this was difficult because of language barriers and poor motivation from significant depression.
As above, restarted carvedilol 12.5mg PO bid when hct was stable.
Switched to Levofloxacin when Ms. [**Known lastname 30132**] self-d/c'ed her NGT and did not with to have it replaced.
After full 7-day course, repeat UA consistent with UTI, urine culture grew MRSA and ESBL Klebsiella.
Her baseline heart rate was bradycardic in the upper 50's to the 60's.
Although her EF was documented as 15% in [**2121-12-28**], a TTE during this hospitalization showed recovery to >60%.
This was stable on scans during this hospitalization, when compared to studies in [**2121-12-28**], measuring approximately ~5 cm in diameter.
12) Depression: Ms. [**Known lastname 30132**] appeared to be depressed during her stay, and had little motivation to participate with PT or incentive spirometry.

You will need to follow up with the [**Hospital 197**] clinic to have you coumadin (warfarin) dose checked and your INR level checked which determines your dose.
You have the appointment with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 278**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 279**], RNC ([**Company 191**] primary care clinic) [**2122-7-21**] 6pm.
