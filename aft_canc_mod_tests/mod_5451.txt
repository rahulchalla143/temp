At time of discharge, he had completed a 9 day course of antibiotics and will not need further antibiotics.
Clinically, his breathing was improved at discharge, he was maintaining good oxygen saturation on room air and there was no reaccumulation of the pleural effuion on repeat CXR.
C. diff was negative x3.
He was given a dose of pamidronate 60mg on [**2189-10-20**] and his calcium level decreased to the normal range.
A urine N-telopeptide was sent and was elevated, suggesting some process leading to increased bone turnover.
Had a bone scan in [**2-/2188**] which also did not show evidence of Paget's.
MRI showed compression fracture in L1 and L2, recommended follow-up in 4 weeks.
Blood sugars remained well controlled during admission and he will be restarted on metformin at discharge.
C. diff was negative x3.
