He presented to clinic on [**2171-10-23**] complaining of shortness of breath and wheezing with a saturation of 94% on room air.
CXR suggested possible post obstructive pna so he was placed on levaquin and flagyl.
On [**2171-11-9**], he [**Date Range 1834**] flexible and rigid bronchoscopy which revealed a near-complete obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus endobronchial lesion with near complete obstruction of the airway.
Left mainstem patency was restored, only 15% residual obstruction remained.
The LUL and LLL showed near complete obstruction, So mechanical debridement and argon plasma coagulation done to the distal left mainstem and LUL and LLL bronchi with only mild improvement of the patency.
Balloon dilatation to 12mm was done followed by deployment of a 12mm x 40mm after LMS dimensions measured.
CXR showed complete opacification of the left hemithorax.
Bronchoscopy was performed again, and an occlusive mucuous plug of the left mainstem stent site was removed.
Pathology was consistent with follicular versus follicular variant of papillary carcinoma.
CT in [**11/2167**] showed no recurrent or residual tumor, but there were small scattered pulmonary nodules.
In [**2-/2168**], a neck ultrasound was notable for right posterior triangle lymph nodes.
CT chest on [**2168-2-23**] showed multiple pulmonary nodules and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
PET scan on [**2168-3-15**] confirmed FDG avid right hilar lymph nodes, numerous pulmonary nodules, and a lucency in L5 concerning for metastasis.
CT chest in [**7-/2168**] showed a slight increase in his pulmonary nodules, along with mediastinal and right hilar lymph node enlargement.
Brain MRI on [**2168-9-19**] showed a large spongy-appearing lesion on the posterior fossa within the calvarium.
PET scan of the brain on [**2168-9-21**] showed a lytic mass lesion involving the suboccipital skull, centered to the right of midline.
Pathology was consistent with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.
MRI L spine on [**2168-12-12**] revealed bony metastatic disease most prominent at L1 with extension into the left epidural space.
He began sorafenib on [**2169-1-23**] and had a significant radiographic response in his parenchymal disease, but his osseous metastases did not respond as well.
He also [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] standard EBXRT to his right pubic bone metastasis, performed with his local radiation oncologist and completed in late [**Month (only) **]/early [**2169-11-9**].
He then completed Cyberknife - 2400 cGy in 3 fractions - on [**2171-8-26**].
Past Medical History: -Cervical spinal laminectomy in [**2144**] and [**2146**] -Spinal fusion in [**2149**] -[**10/2156**], surgery for thyroid mass at [**Doctor Last Name 15594**] Medical Center -[**2168**], surgery for mass on his skull -[**2171-7-26**], brain tumor metastasis removed.
