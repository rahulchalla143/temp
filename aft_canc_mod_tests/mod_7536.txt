Perhaps slight decrease in size of cardiac mass compared to CT from [**2200-3-26**], with persistent mass effect on superior vena cava.
Rapid respiratory viral antigen screen positive for parainfluenza type 3.
However, these antibiotics were discontinued the following morning as the RRVS came back positive for parainfluenza type 3 and the patient remained afebrile overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] without a significant leukocytosis.
The patient also ruled in for a cardiac event (see below) with a decrease in his EF, which may have also contributed to his sensation of dyspnea; however, his films were not impressive for pulmonary edema.
# Positive Cardiac Biomarkers: On admission, pt with troponin to 0.23, CK 123, MB 16, and MBI 13.0.
TTE was also notable for 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]R as well as depressed RV free wall contractility.
A repeat TTE was pending at the time of transfer from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
