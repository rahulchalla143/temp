M with hepatitis B cirrhosis c/b portal vein thrombosis without intervention per his GI doctor, encephalopathy, and varices, COPD, and hypertension, transferred from [**Hospital6 10353**] for management of his upper GI bleeding.
Labs notable for Na 121, Hct 40.5, BUN/Cr 28/1.5, AST 96, ALT 43, TP 7.0, Albumin 3.1, Alk Phos 348, INR 1.9, Bili 1.5.
His Hct trend was the following:  40.5 on admission to OSH --> 33.6 --> 32.7 ---> 27.4 at 6 PM [**8-6**] --> 2 units pRBC transfused --> 31.7 at 2 AM [**8-7**] --> 30.3 at 7 AM [**8-7**] --> 31.1 at 11 AM [**8-7**].
He had an endoscopy on [**8-5**] and 19 with varices which were nonbleeding and showed erosive esophagitis but no BRB.
Stomach, fundus and cardia revealed old blood in proximal stomach, but no specific bleeding site.
Antrum showed mild inflammation of antrum with edema.
OSH cultured with no growth to date.
He also was noted to be more confused with an ammonia level of 115, up from 84 even with lactulose.
CT scan at that time showed possible thrombosis of the portal vein.
Follow up MRI showed extensive cirrhosis with confluent hepatic fibrosis with multiple benign-appearing nonenhancing splenic lesions.

Assessment for mass lesions is difficult and follow up / CT is recommended 2.
Limited evaluation for intrahepatic masses, but echogenic focus in the region of the portal vein could suggest an intrahepatic mass.
Multiphasic CT  or MRI is recommended for further evaluation.
ECHO [**8-8**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-9-12**], the findings are similar.
Records were obtained from [**Hospital6 10353**], where an abdominal MRI was performed in [**2193-6-18**].
MRI was reviewed here by GI tumor board and showed findings most consitent with extensive hepatocellular carcinoma.
# Hepatocellular carcinoma: New diagnosis based on MRI appearance.
Therapeutic paracentesis did not improve urine output either.
