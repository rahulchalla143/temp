He had been seen by his primary care physican two days prior and noted to have neck swelling, at which time a CT was done that showed non-occlusive clot around his port.
His O2 sat dropped to 90% and HR up to 110 with ambulation.
Decision was made to admit to hospital for further monitoring and work-up of pulmonary embolus.
- [**2131-8-2**] CT scan of the torso: Irregular, polypoid lesion seen within the rectum, with multiple subcentimeter presacral and pericolic lymph nodes identified.
Per report, a CT PET performed elsewhere demonstrated uptake in the left base of the lung.
Pathology revealed adenocarcinoma of the rectum, low-grade, with invasion into the perirectal adipose tissue and metastasis to 7 of 13 regional lymph nodes (T3N2).
The left lower lobe wedge resection demonstrated an adenocarcinoma, 4.1 cm, consistent with metastasis of rectal origin.
- [**2132-2-14**]: Evaluation by the hepatobiliary surgery consult team due to the finding on his recent PET scan of a likely liver metastasis.

that if evaluation of PE is needed in the future, it should be evaluated by IVC rather than upper extremity injection.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
[**12-1**] CT head:  Normal non-contrast head CT with no evidence of metastasis.
If metastasis is of clinical concern, MR is a more sensitive modality for the evaluation of intracranial metastasis.
[**12-2**] PTA Venous IMPRESSION: 1.
Repeat SVC venogram demonstrated flow improvement in the SVC with no collateral veins across the midline.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, this is a 71 year-old man with history of metastatic colon cancer s/p multiple surgeries, including proctosigmoidectomy, lung and liver resections, now on cycle 2 of 5 FU/LV presenting from clinic with hypoxia, tachycardia and dyspnea with mild exertion.
Prior to procedure, CT head was done that showed no intracranial metastases.
There is concern of HIT given that he was on heparin throughout hospitalization, although his platelet count is still high at 117 (and there were several fluctuations in platelet levels from day to day).
His CBC will be faxed to his primary oncologist.
His blood sugars were persistently elevated during hospital course.
I spoke with him regarding follow-up with his primary physcian and told him there are medications that could help with blood sugar control.
