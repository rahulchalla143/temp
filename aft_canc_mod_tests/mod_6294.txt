Then fell in [**4-12**] during a dialysis session, w/ R hip fx w/o surgical correction given abscses at that time, CT scan supported metastatic disease.
Later a biopsy was performed which demosntrated possible spindle cells.

BILAT HIPS (AP,LAT & AP PELVIS)  [**2177-6-26**] 6:32 PM  BILAT HIPS (AP,LAT & AP PELVIS  Reason: Please eval fracture  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 64 year old man with rectal cancer, s/p R hip fracture in [**Month (only) 958**] [**2177**] REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please eval fracture BILATERAL HIPS [**2177-6-26**]:  CLINICAL INFORMATION: Rectal cancer status post right hip fracture marginally.
FINDINGS:  AP view of the pelvis and two coned down views of the right hip are submitted.
Comparison is made with the CT of the abdomen and pelvis from [**2177-3-30**] which demonstrates a lytic destructive lesion of the right acetabulum.
Further evaluation with CT or MRI is recommended.
Evaluation for fine osseous detail is limited by the osteopenia.
IMPRESSION:  1) Progression of large lytic destructive lesion in the right acetabulum and iliac bone with fracture of the medial acetabular wall with displacement of fracture medially into the pelvis.
Further evaluation with CT or MRI is recommended.
Bone Scan: Whole body images of the skeleton and planar views of the thorax were obtained in anterior and posterior projections.
Additionally there is focal uptake in the bilateral shoulders, right greater than left, as well as the bilateral knees, right greater than left consistent with degenerative changes.
CT guided biopsy: PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and informed written consent was obtained.
The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position on the CT scanner.
Using 10 cc of 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, under direct CT fluoroscopic guidance, a 14-gauge coaxial needle was inserted into the destructive lytic lesion within the right ilium.
Subsequently, five core biopsy samples were obtained with a 15-gauge biopsy gun device with the samples were placed in formalin.
A total dose of 25 mcg of fentanyl and 0.5 mg of Versed were administered.
No malignancy identified in this specimen  CT Torso: CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis are greater on the right than the left.
The liver, spleen, pancreas, right adrenal gland, large bowel, and small bowel are unremarkable.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The left lower quadrant demonstrates sigmoid colostomy.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 M w/ pmhx of rectal cancer presented for evaluation of likely pathologic right hip fracture.
The initial examination hsowed predominantly fibrosis with spindle cells, raising the possibiltity that the pathalogic fracture may be from a new primary sarcoma, as opposed to metastatic rectal cancer.
The biopsy specimen was sent to [**Hospital1 **] and woman's hospital for further examination.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], Pelvis X-Ray showed widespread metastatic involvement of the bony pelvis.
They also recommended the patient get a bone scan in order to find other metastatic sites which may be easily accesible for further biopsy and identification.
The bone identified the lesions in the right hip that were suspicious and he underwent a CT guided biopsy of the right ilium by orthopedic oncology on [**7-4**].
However, this biopsy show no malignancy.
In discussion with the orthopedic oncologist and his primary oncologist, the decision was made to observe the patient in one month with a repeat CT scan.
His LFTs and TFTs were normal here.
