Transthoracic lung biopsy - interventional radiology   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 112303**] is a 66yoF with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who is being transferred from the neurosurgery service for further evaluation of multiple brain metastases and a lung mass seen on imaging studies.
She presented to [**Hospital1 2436**] ED where a head CT revealed a left frontal mass and multiple cerebellar lesions with effacement of 4th ventricle.
She was admitted to the neurosurgery SICU due to concern for mass effect and risk for hydrocephalus, though her vital signs were stable.
Her examination revealed left dysmetria, imbalance.
MRI confirmed the presence of the masses seen on CT with infra and supratentorial brain lesion suggestive of metastasis.
CT torso done for detection of primary lesion showed a large LUL lesion with satellite lesions in both lungs and hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Neuro-oncology was consulted, and recommended diagnostic biopsy of a lung lesion, with likely whole-brain radiation therapy for her brain metastases.

#RADIOLOGY: []MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST Study Date of [**2151-7-27**] 5:52 AM IMPRESSION:  Numerous supra- and infratentorial enhancing lesions, with the largest lesions in the left cerebellar hemisphere and left frontal lobe as above.
Brief Hospital Course: []BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY: 66yoF with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from the neurosurgery service for further evaluation of multiple brain metastases and a lung mass seen on imaging studies, c/f lung primary.
After brain and body imaging revealed a lung mass with lesions in the brain, she was admitted to the neurosurgery SICU due to concern for mass effect and risk for hydrocephalus, though her vital signs were stable.
Her examination revealed left dysmetria, imbalance.
MRI confirmed the presence of the masses seen on CT with infra and supratentorial brain lesion suggestive of metastasis.
CT torso done for detection of primary lesion showed a large LUL lesion with satellite lesions in both lungs and hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Neuro-oncology was consulted, and recommended diagnostic biopsy of a lung lesion, with likely whole-brain radiation therapy for her brain metastases.
The plan is to consult interventional radiology to perform a CT guided transthoracic biopsy of the lung mass for tissue diagnosis.
Follow up CXR showed no evidence of a pneumothorax.
She will continue taking the dexamethasone 4mg Q6H as an outpatient, along with the phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis 100mg TID.
Information was obtained from PatientwebOMR.
You had a brain and body imaging study that revealed masses in your lungs and brain.
You had a biopsy done and the results are pending.
