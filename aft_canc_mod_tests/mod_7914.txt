Imaging: --------- CXR [**2151-12-10**]: 1.
PA and lateral views would be helpful when/if patient able.
CXR [**2151-12-14**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared retrocardiac opacity.
CT head [**2151-12-11**] 1.
CT Head [**2151-12-13**]: Evaluation of the posterior fossa is slightly limited by motion artifacts despite multiple scan acquisitions.
EEG [**2151-12-16**]: IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to the slow posterior and other background and due to the occasional generalized slowing.
