HEAD AND NECK PET-CT [**9-15**]: .
METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation correction and for fusion with emission PET images.
[The noncontrast CT images are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]
Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.
The left level IIb node seen on the prior study is no longer seen and there is no new nodal involvement.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**9-30**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
CHEST X-RAY [**10-3**] HISTORY: Throat cancer.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-2**], most recently 4:34 p.m.: Volume loss in the left lower lobe has improved, revealing new consolidation, probably pneumonia.
When the patient was on the floor, his ABG on 50% FiO2 was 7.51/30/65 when satting 92%.
GNRs had been seen on sputum gram stain from this same sample.
As the admission continued, and other etiologies appeared less likely (i.e., PE, CHF), pneumonia was thought to be the main precipitant of his respiratory failure, in conjunction with patient difficulty in defending his airway because of his distorted throat anatomy; he lacked a gag and had a weak cough.
On the night of [**9-17**], he became more and more tachypneic and was tiring with increasing work of breathing, and ABG showed worsening hypoxia, so we intubated Mr. [**Known lastname 28253**]; this intubation was somewhat difficult per report of anesthesia, with requirement for fiber optic visualization to successfully complete the intubation.
After discussion with the patient and his wife, a tracheotomy was performed and trach tube put in place on [**10-2**].
# Hyponatremia: His sodium was 119 on admission and on repeat.
Urine lytes were initially potentially consistent with SIADH.
Surgery has thus far been deferred, consistent with current standards of care for SCC of the throat which at least initially avoids surgery while assessing response to chemotherapy and radiation.
# Chronic systolic heart failure An echocardiogram was performed on [**9-30**], with results above, showing a mild decrease in systolic heart function from prior.
He had an elevated BNP on arrival, and likely CHF contributed to his hypoxia which was primarily secondary to pneumonia.
Hydrochlorothiazide, one of his home medications, was not restarted; his blood pressure was in good control in the latter part of his admission.
