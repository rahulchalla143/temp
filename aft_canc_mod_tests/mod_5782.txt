VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOW: A video fluoroscopic oropharyngeal swallow evaluation was done in conjunction with the speech and swallow pathology division.
Bolus formation, control, and tongue movement were severely impaired with consistent premature spillage noted.
Once the pharyngeal swallow was initiated palate elevation, laryngeal elevation and epiglottic deflection were within functional limits.
IMPRESSION: Severely prolonged oral phase with no definite evidence of aspiration, though evaluation was limited.
For further details, please consult the speech and swallow pathology evaluation available on CareWeb.
However, her creatinine began to rise and it was felt that we had reached the limit of active diuresis.
At that time, it was noted that she had 3+ MR on a previous echocardiogram which was likely making her heart failure much worse than it appeared to be.
In preparation for surgery she underwent evaluation of her carotids which showed a patent right carotid and a 60-69% stenosis in the left.
Cardiac surgery also recommended an evaluation by GI given her history of GI bleeding and the increased intraoperative risk given the large heparin dose she would get.
She received an EGD with small bowel enteroscopy which showed some small AVMs in the stomach which were cauterized and no further AVMs in the visualized portion of the small bowel.
She also received a colonoscopy which only showed a benign appearing polyp that was biopsied but not removed given the plans for surgery.

Her creatinine rose to 2, and she required higher blood pressures, as well as torsemide and albumin to maintain urine output.
She was again reintubated on POD #17 for near badycardic near arrest.
Speech and swallow evaluation recommended starting nectar thick and pureed consistencies, with tube feeds as primary source of nutrition.
