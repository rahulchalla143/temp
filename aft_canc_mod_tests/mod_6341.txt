Mr. [**Known lastname **] is well known to the [**Known lastname 3242**] service, his last admission being from [**2127-2-23**] to [**2127-4-25**] and complicated by fever and neutropenia secondary to clostridium difficile infection (stool C. diff negative prior to discharge), typhlitis, VRE urosepsis, upper and lower extremity DVTs, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
He was discharged to [**Hospital3 105**] and returns because of a falling platelet count and inability to keep up with his transfusion needs while maintaining anticoagulation with lovenox.
He has not had any frank fevers, however, his wife notes that his temperature has been rising somewhat.
A renal biopsy on [**2127-7-23**] confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Stage 4B), and a pericardial biopsy on [**2127-7-25**] also was consistent with large B-cell lymphoma.
In addition, a bone marrow biopsy demonstrated bone marrow involvement by lymphoma.
CT abdomen on [**2-11**] showed evidence of new liver lesion concerning for disease recurrence.
CT guided liver biopsy on [**2127-2-26**] was positive and on further evaluation was found to have involvement in his heart, chest wall and retropharyngeal space.
No discrete hepatic lesions were noted on CT abdomen on [**3-21**].

**FINAL REPORT [**2127-5-3**]**     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2127-5-3**]):       Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
Imaging: [**2127-4-30**] CXR - The left internal jugular line tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
[**2127-5-2**] RUE ultrasound - IMPRESSION: 1.
[**2127-5-3**] ECG - Normal sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2127-4-25**] there is no diagnostic interval change.
[**2127-5-4**] CXR - The left central venous line tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
[**2127-5-6**] CXR - FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-4**], there is again evidence of chronic pulmonary disease with bilateral pleural effusions and atelectatic changes at the bases.
[**2127-5-7**] CT Torso with contrast - IMPRESSION: 1.
Previously identified left chest wall mass and cardiac masses are not visualized on the current study, consistent with continued interval improvement in lymphoma.
Cholelithiasis within the gallbladder neck, but no CT evidence of acute cholecystitis.
[**2127-5-14**] ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-4-9**], no change.
[**2127-5-15**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Regression of previously identified bilateral pleural effusion.

No acute changes in the abdomen compared to the CT torso performed 10 days ago.
The patient had a CT scan on [**2127-5-7**] that demonstrated a dramatic remission of his formerly bulky disease.
Repeat CT scan on [**5-18**] failed to identify recurrent lymphoma.
In discussion, with the patient and his family, it was decided not to pursue additional diagnostic studies such as a lumbar puncture or a bone marrow biopsy.
His platelet levels eventually recovered as his neutropenia resolved.
Atrial fibrillation with RVR - The patient has a history of intermittant afib with RVR, particularly in response to lasix.
The patient was noted to become hypoxic, particularly at night, requiring increased amounts of oxygen (up to 4L NC) to keep his O2 sats greater than 90%.
Chest x-rays and CT-chest showed no evidence of infection, but did show new bilateral pleural effusions compared to imaging from his prior admission in addition to his previously known lung disease.
Interventional pulmonology was [**Name (NI) 653**], however, they did not feel that the effusions were large enough to drain.
Lasix was used to try to remove some of the extra fluid and the patient's oxygen requirement did decrease such that his O2 sats were 95% or greater sitting up during the day, however, he continued to require oxygen while lying in bed and sleeping.
A repeat ECHO was performed, however, it showed no change from his prior study appoximately a month earlier.
Pulmonology was consulted Repeat x-ray showed improvement in the patient's effusions, and his oxygen requirement resolved on its own, likely a delayed effect of diuresis, requiring several days for fluid shifts to transpire.
The patient also underwent pulmonary function testing due to concern for emphysema based on CT scan and prior smoking history and need for such testing if stem cell transplant were to be considereed.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate 6.
Deep venous thromboses 7.
