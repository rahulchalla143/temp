Chest X-ray [**2168-1-6**]: Large left-sided hilar lung mass, COPD, but no acute pneumonic infiltrates.
CT torso [**2168-1-8**]: 1) Compared to the prior study of 3 days ago, there has been interval development of numerous focal densities with irregular margins, at least one with questionable area of cavitation, consistent with septic emboli or an atypical infection.
Echo [**2168-1-8**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Cardiac catheterization [**2167-1-12**]: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Echo [**2167-1-12**]: 1.The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2168-1-8**], there ae new wall motion abnormalities seen with a significant decrease in LV and RV function.
Renal US [**2167-1-26**]: There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was initially transferred from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] general medicine service on [**1-3**] for bronchoscopy and biopsy of the LUL mass.
Repeat CT showed LUL mass obstructing LUL bronchus; mass contiguous with LUL LAD.
Bronchoscopy was performed on [**2168-1-5**] and bronchial washings/brushings came back suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma.
On repeat chest CT [**1-7**] there were new multiple pulmonary opacities.
There was a concern that the new opacities on chest CT could represent septic emboli.
This was felt to be unlikely as blood cultures were negative.
Sputum was sent for culture, AFB,  nocardia and fungal culture and subsequently grew Pseudomonas.
WBC started to decrease.
Trans-thoracic echo on [**2166-12-29**] was negative for vegetations, EF was >60%, and [**1-11**] + AR, 2+ TR.
The next day she developed tachypnea on the floor with RR of 36, became diaphoretic and exam was consistent with CHF exacerbation.
ABG - 7.22/94/60 on 35% FM, increased from 7.45/50/111 about 1 day earlier.
CXR showed known masses and signs of CHF.
EKG revealed 3-4mm ST elevations in V3-4 with q waves in same leads, new compared to [**2167-1-3**] EKG.
CXR [**2167-1-12**] early am showed known masses, small-mod R effusion, smaller L effusion, some CHF.
EKG STE V3-V4, with q's; prior EKG was week before.
CK MB was 3 and 6.
focal), mild MR. Echo was performed and confirmed new severely depressed LV function EF25%.
Repeat TTE on [**2167-1-23**] showed no significant change or recovery of ventricular function from prior echocardiogram.
Sputum was sent for culture and grew Pseudomonas that was now resistant to Zosyn.
