The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] intubated for a magnetic resonance imaging and increased lethargy.
The magnetic resonance imaging showed a left parietal mass and surrounding edema; similar to a CT scan done at [**Hospital6 **].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was afebrile, the heart rate was 71, the respiratory rate was 18, the blood pressure was 126/54, and the oxygen saturation was 100 percent.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient was sedated.
RADIOLOGY STUDIES:  A head computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a left parietal mass with surrounding edema.
The patient was seen by Neurology/Oncology who recommended either biopsy or surgery to confirm the diagnosis.
She had a magnetic resonance imaging postoperatively that showed good excision of the mass.
She was seen by the Infectious Disease Service who felt that she could potentially have meningitis, but the patient and her family refused a lumbar puncture.
Her neurologic status remained stable throughout her hospital stay, and her vital signs were stable.
