CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2118-7-15**] 6:36 PM Please note this examination is limited due to marked patient rotation and portable technique.
These may be better evaluated with dedicated PA and lateral chest radiographs.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ([**2118-7-18**]) HRCT CHEST:  Images are limited by motion.
Expiratory images show mild air trapping, most pronounced in the lower lobes bilaterally.
Limited, noncontrast evaluation of the heart and great vessels is unremarkable.
Limited noncontrast evaluation of the abdomen shows nonspecific perinephric stranding, unchanged compared to the previous study.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2118-7-17**]): [**10-27**] PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary): SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2118-7-20**] 8:06 AM FINDINGS: There is a new area of slow diffusion in the right medial occipital lobe and the adjacent portion of the splenium of the corpus collosum.
Follow-up MRI is suggested in 1 week to assess for the expected evolution of the presumed infarction.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 69yo M with h/o Stage IIIB IgG kappa MM d+55 autoSCT who presented with one day history of shaking, elevated temperature, ANC 888, low BP, dullness to percussion on physical exam, and recent ICU admission for melphalan-related lung toxicity.
Intracranial hemorrhage:  Pt had an LP on [**7-27**] that was concerning for a SAH due to 1200 RBCs on 4th tube and yellow color.
Pt had a head CT on [**7-28**] that did not show evidence for a bleed.
An emergent head CT was obtained that revealed a new, large right parietal and occipital hemorrhage with extensive mass effect including herniations.
Upon learning the results of the CT scan, Neurosurgery felt prognosis would be poor.
Pt had an EEG that did not show acute foci of seizure activity.
He had a repeat LP on [**7-27**] that was sig.
for hazy and yellow fluid, mildly elevated protein, relatively low glucose compared to serum glucose, and WBC of 8 and 4, which is slightly above normal but pt was neutropenic, with lymph predominance, suggesting an infectious process (more likely viral v. [**Month/Year (2) 1065**] then bacterial).
Cultures and multiple viral studies were sent.
A TEE was attempted pn [**7-27**] to look for evidence of endocarditis; however, the probe could not be passed through his upper esophageal sphincter.
There is also concern for septic emboli on head MR, which seems to have worsen.
Culture of the skin biopsy was sent.
Dilated eye exam did not show any evidence for infectious process.
Viral studies including CMV and B parvovirus were sent.
Due to concern for possible development of myelodysplastic syndrome, bone marrow aspirate was performed, which revealed hypocellular marrow, likely sulfamethoxazole/trimeth related injury.
Labile blood pressure: Pt was noted to have a BP of 79/54 on admission while dozing off while examiner was talking with the pt's wife.
Hyponatremia:  This was thought to be c/w SIADH with sodium ranging from 123-138 since admission.
