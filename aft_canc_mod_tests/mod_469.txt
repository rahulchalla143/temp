The patient was rate controlled with beta-blockers and started on intravenous Heparin considering the fact that it was unknown whether she had been on her Coumadin at home, and her INR was subtherapeutic.
Once the patient was stable from a cardiac standpoint, she underwent exam under anesthesia and a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for fibroids and pelvic pain and menorrhagia on [**2178-4-13**].
On postoperative day #2, she was noted to be slightly tachycardiac with good urine output with a slightly distended abdomen and a hematocrit drop from 31 to 25 for which she was given 3 U of packed red blood cells.
Her posttransfusion hematocrit was 26.
The patient however became progressively tachycardiac and oliguric, and on postoperative day #3, a CT of the abdomen revealed an intraperitoneal hematoma with portal venous air.
The patient continued to hemorrhage with a hematocrit drop to 19 and became progressively coagulopathic despite FFP.
Heart rate was in the 110s, and she was in atrial fibrillation.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count on admission was 8.3, hematocrit 38.2; INR 1.3.
She dropped her hematocrit despite being transfused 2 U packed red blood cells.
CT scan of the abdomen revealed an intraperitoneal hematoma with portal venous air.
She underwent an echocardiogram on [**4-23**] which showed some pulmonary hypertension.
Also of note, the patient's white count was noted to be elevated, and she was pancultured.
Her urine and sputum were positive for growth, and she was started on Levofloxacin and Ceftazidime.
She was restarted on her Coumadin, and on [**4-28**], postoperative days 15 and 12, the patient was discharged home in stable condition.
