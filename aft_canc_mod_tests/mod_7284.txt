[**Hospital **]hospital EKG also concerning for inferior STEMI, but on my review, this appears only on paced beats with ST elevations in II and III and ST depressions in I. .
On arrival to the ED, the patient's initial vitals were T 95.1, HR 60 (paced), BP 80/40, O2 100%.
Blood pressures decreased to the 60s; cooling was stopped.
FAST exam was negative.
He also required epinephrine gtt to maintain blood pressures in the 90s systolic.
CT head/neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates concerning for aspiration versus pneumonia.
On CT scan, his ETT was noted to be anterior to his tracheal stent.
ECHO performed at the bedside showed preserved EF (> 55%) with no regional wall motion abnormalities.

He was not cooled per protocol with arctic sun due to the length of time between his arrest (~ 1315) and arrival to the MICU (~1815) as well as the instability of his blood pressure on arrival (he was initially on 3 pressors on arrival to MICU).
A repeat ECHO was performed, showing an EF greater than 55 % and high transaoritc valve pressure gradiant, largely unchanged since his echo on presentation.
Urine Legionella antigen was negative.
Sputum on [**12-20**] grew Coag + Staph aureus and the patient was treated with vancomycin and cefepime for and 8 day course.
Gram stain on repeat sputum on [**12-23**] was concerning for 4+ GNRs, however, only Staph aureus eventually grew out.
The patient's oxygen requirement improved and he did not spike any additional fevers while on antibiotics or after they were stopped.
Baseline creatinine 0.9 to 1.1 per OSH.
Cr 2.7 on admission in setting of shock and arrest, improved with IVF and resuscitation and returned to [**Location 213**] range.
# Diabetes mellitus: The patient had a FSBS in the 300s on arrival to the ICU.
He was placed on an insulin gtt and blood sugars were monitored q1h until they were under better control.
his flomax and proscar were continued.
