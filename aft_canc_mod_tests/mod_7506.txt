Her Echo showed frank tamponade physiology, and CT surgery was immediately consulted and took her for emergent pericardial window in the OR.
Her cardiac status was monitored with daily EKG's assessing for voltage changes as well as daily pulsus measurements using a doppler probe (she remained in the 5-6 range, >8 was our threshold for concern for recurrent tamponade).
Prior to discharge she had another echo which showed no definite change.
She did well and was called out to the OMED service when her above tamponade was discovered necessitating emergent surgical intervention.
Her pleural fluid cultures were negative x 2.
She maintained her sats in the mid-high 90's on 2-6LNC (requiring a 10L facemask at one point) with her home O2 dose being 2LNC.
Throughout her admission, her blood pressure was usually in the low 100's but she was occasionally hypotensive to the low 80's or high 70's which responded well to 250cc boluses.
The endocrine team from [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and recommended a battery of tests including anti-TPO, anti-TG, serum aldosterone, and plasma renin levesl as well as continued urine lytes monitoring.
Surgical course: The patient showed tamponade physiology on echo and was brought urgently to the operating room for a pericardial window with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].
