CT LE: Comminuted, markedly angulated and displaced fracture of the subtrochanteric femur with involvement of the lesser trochanter.
Total intraoperative fluoroscopic imaging time 90.8 seconds.
CT A/P: IMPRESSION: 1.
ABD SUPINE/ERECT:  In comparison with the CT scout of [**5-10**], there is continued and possibly even more prominent extreme dilatation of a gas-filled [**Date Range 499**].
KUB [**2148-5-12**]:  In comparison with the study of [**5-11**], there is again extreme distention of the visualized loops of bowel.
KUB [**2148-5-12**]: Chronic, marked colonic dilatation is unchanged from the preceding radiograph and also seen as far back as CT of [**2146-8-9**].
# Acute Blood Loss Anemia/Hypotension: On post-op day 2 pt was found to have BP 80/50 on 8 AM vitals with HR in 120s.
On recheck SBP was in 70s.
Previous vitals overnight had been stable with SBP in 120s and HR 70s.
Other notable values at the time were low UOP (220 since midnight) and Hct drop from 31.4 to 26.8 (verified by recheck).
EKG was rapid and regular with poor baseline - either sinus tach or aflutter.
BP improved to SBP 90s with fluids but PIV infiltrated after only a couple hundred mL NS and no other access could be obtained.
In the MICU, the patient required 3 units of pRBC's and she had a non-contrast CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis which extended into her thighs which did not show any active bleed.
Following her transfusions her crits remained stable and she was called out to the floor for further management.
Her Hct trended up throughout the rest of admission.
Ortho consulted in the ED and recommended CT scan then surgery.
She was taken for repair on [**2148-5-7**] which was complicated only by 500mL blood loss necessitating 2 unit PRBC transfusion for Hct drop from 29 to 24 post-op.
Biopsy was taken at the time of surgery to evaluate for malignancy but was pending at the time of discharge.
Her similar presentation in [**2144**] grew an E coli sensitive to bactrim, but prior cultures have shown VRE.
While pt had bleeding leading to MICU, she never had rectal bleeding that would be concerning for colonic malignancy and she had a more likely source of bleeding, which was the recent thigh operation in which she lost 700cc of blood intraop.
Having regular BM in house but abdomen markedly distended (denied pain) so KUB ordered after surgery in PACU to eval but was mostly unchanged from prior imaging and shows no free air.
CT abdomen and pelvis showed severely dilated loops of bowel to as large as 16cm yet patient was without abdominal pain, fevers, white count, or HD compromise to suggest colitis or megacolon.
Her abdominal distension improved and she had no abd pain so she was discharged on a generous bowel regimen.
