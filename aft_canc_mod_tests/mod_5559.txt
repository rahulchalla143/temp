An MRI obtained [**2-1**] showed a new pathologic fx of T4 and an epidural lesion at that level compressing the cord.

Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Patient is s/p L VATS wedge resection x 2 [**11/2145**], L hepatic lobectomy [**2146-1-1**].
CT of the chest, abdoment and pelvis [**2-6**] was performed to further stage possible recurrent HCC.
- Spinal Metastasis: Patient admitted [**2146-2-4**] with complaint of worsening B/L lower extremity weakness in setting of T4 epidural mestatic lesion seen on MRI [**1-31**].
Repeat MRI of thoracic and lumbar spine was performed [**2-4**] which showed pathologic fracture of T4 vertebral body and persistence of T4 epidural lesion.
His neuro exam remained stable.
Cultures were drawn from all possible sources of infection and patient was started on vancomycin, unasyn [**2-5**].
Blood cultures [**2-4**] were shown to be negative.
Limited abdominal wall U/S [**2-4**] showed small fluid collection at medial aspect of incision.
Cultures revealed MSSA and patient was treated with vancomycin x 4 days and nafcillin x 1 day.
Wound packing was changed [**Hospital1 **] and monitored for any further signs of infection.
- UTI: UA on admission was positive and subsequent urine culture drawn [**2-5**] showed enterococcus > 100k colonies.
Repeat UA and urine culture [**2-8**] was negative and antibiotics were discontinued.
- Fluid Collection: CT abdomen [**2-4**] without contrast showed a perihepatic fluid collection.
Cultures were negative and fluid analysis showed this to be a seroma/biloma.
