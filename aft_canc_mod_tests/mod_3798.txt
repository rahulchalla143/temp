At the outside hospital he had a WBC of 45.3 (90% Blasts) and a HCT of 25 with 19% nucleated RBC's.
Pertinent Results: BONE MARROW BIOPSY AND FLOW CYTOMETRY ([**2198-10-7**]): AML: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with acute myelogenous leukemia, with an immature phenotype.
RVG ([**2198-10-8**]): Following the intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with  Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, first pass and equilibrium images were obtained.
The first pass study  shows prompt tracer flow through the central circulation.
CXR ([**2198-10-8**]): FINDINGS: There is a left subclavian central venous catheter with the tip in satisfactory location in the distal SVC.
CT TORSO ([**2198-10-17**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
BONE MARROW BIOPSY AND FLOW CYTOMETRY ([**2198-10-23**]): DIAGNOSIS: Persistent involvement by acute myelogenous leukemia.
CT ABD ([**2198-10-26**]): IMPRESSION - 1.
Limited study of the abdomen secondary to significant patient debility as described above.
ECHO ([**2198-10-26**]): 1.The LA is mildly dilated.
Overall LV systolic function is severely depressed with more marked anterior and inferior HK.
CT CHEST ([**2198-10-31**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
ECHO ([**2198-11-6**]): The LA is mildly dilated.
LV wall thicknesses are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be estimated.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2198-10-26**], the LV cavity is now dilated (previous [**Last Name (un) **] 6.0cm).
CXR ([**2198-11-24**]): PORTABLE AP CHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison [**2198-10-31**].
ECHO ([**2198-11-26**]): The LA is mildly dilated.
LV wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall LV systolic function is severely depressed.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2198-11-6**], biventricular systolic function now appears slightly worse.
BONE MARROW BIOPSY ([**2198-11-27**]): DIAGNOSIS - Markedly hypocellular bone marrow for age, with left-shifted granulocytic maturation and markedly decreased erythropoiesis.
1) AML: The patient had a white blood cell count of 40,000 to 60,000 on admission.
A bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry revealed acute myelogenous leukemia, with an immature phenotype.
As anticipated, his cell lines dropped and the patient soon became neutropenic.
Empiric antimicrobials and then antifungals were commenced (see below).
Approximately two weeks after his [7+3] regimen, a bone marrow biopsy revealed persistent involvement by AML.
After two to three weeks of pancytopenia, a repeat bone marrow biopsy was obtained because of a concern for persistence of AML.
On discharge, his platelets were 74, hematocrit was 32.5, white blood cell count of 3.4, and an absolute neutrophil count greater than 3000.
He was discharged with oncologic follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**] at [**Hospital1 18**].
Initial broad-specturm choices were Cefipime, Vancomycin, Caspofungin, and then Ambisome.
After persistence of his fevers a chest CT revealed pulmonary edema as well as bilateral nodular opacities, concerning for aspergillosis or pneumocystis gondii infections.
Bronchoscopy was not pursued.
Late in his course, he grew staph epidermidis from four of four blood culture bottles (anaerobic and aerobic) and his Hickman line was removed.
Concominantly with Vancomycin therapy and a rising neutrophil count, his fevers abatted and all follow-up blood cultures were negative.
A repeat chest CT was attempted, but the patient could not tolerate the study because of orthopnea.
Because of concern for a pulmonary infection, a chest CT was sought, but the patient developed acute worsening of his dyspnea, oxygen desaturation and hemoptysis while on the CT scanner.
His pre-chemotherapy ventriculogram revealed an LVEF of greater than 55%.
On account of teniously low blood pressures (systolic blood pressures to the 70s) with Lasix boluses, he was changed to a Lasix drip ([**2-16**] mg/hr).
The plan was to add-on an ace-inhibitor and aldactone when the patient's blood pressures could tolerate these agents.
He was mainted on beta-blocker and Digoxin as above and his heart rates ranged from the 60's to the 100's late in his course, when his CHF was better controlled.
An ECG showed no signs of ischemia.
Hepatic and biliary imaging were not remarkable.
A repeat right upper quadrant ultra-sound was unremarkable.
On discharge, his alkaline phosphatase was 500 with a bilirubin of 1.4.
Disp:*qs 1 mo packets* Refills:*0* 8.
A CBC, SMA10 (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, urea, and glucose) and digoxin level should be checked.
Discharge Condition: Fair/Stable  Discharge Instructions: 1) Please call Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 3760**]), your primary doctor ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 803**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 57652**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4018**]), the oncall [**Hospital1 18**] oncologist ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2756**]) or go to an emergency department if you have any fevers, chills, back pain, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, cough, or any other concerning symptoms.
A CBC, SMA10, and digoxin level should be checked to evaluate your blood count, electrolytes, and digoxin level.
