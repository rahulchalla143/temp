CXR at that time revealed an evolving RLL and lingular/LUL infiltrate.
He was admitted for further evaluation with CXR and CT chest concerning for evolving pneumonia.
During his hospital stay, the patient did have relative hypotension as at baseline to the range of sbp 90's with tachycardia to the low 100's.
During the procedure, the patient received 1mg midazolam and a bolus of 25mcg of fentanyl.
The patient was kept in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring.
Relapsed in [**6-2**] treated with ESHAP x 1 cycle in preparation for allo stem cell transplant, which he underwent on [**2098-8-7**] from a sibling related donor with fludarabine and Cytoxan conditioning.
Transplant complicated by liver GVHD confirmed by a biopsy on [**2099-1-11**] treated with prednisone.
Also noted to be hepatitis B core antibody positive at that time and began on lamivudine to prevent reactivation.
Treated with CEP chemotherapy on [**2101-6-8**] with a donor lymphocyte infusion on [**2101-6-29**] at 1 x 108 T cells per kilogram with marked GVHD of the liver with increased transaminases and bilirubin requiring CellCept and prednisone with eventual resolution.
Treated with Day 1,2,3 only of CEP starting on [**2102-6-30**] with evidence for disease response on CT scan from [**2102-7-21**].
Rescanned in [**9-6**] with progression of disease and then received two more cycles of CEP on [**2102-9-7**] and [**2102-10-10**] with CT scan on [**2102-11-8**] with response to therapy.

This may be secondary in part to regions of improving aeration when compared to prior consolidation, although some regions which appear to have worsening ground-glass opacity may be secondary to atypical infection including processes such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] other infectious/inflammatory processes.
Renal biopsy, needle: Consistent with "acute tubular necrosis", see note.
## Fever/Pneumonia: CT findings suggested pneumonia as source of fevers.
Beacause of concern for sepsis, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for bronchoscopy which revealed thick white secretions c/w pna.
Post bronchoscopy CXR showed slight worsening of RLL infiltrate.
Sputum cultures were negative.
The patient had a repeat bronchoscopy on [**10-8**], with BAL cultures showing just oropharyngial flora and no PCP.
GI was consulted and the patient was subsequently started on PO vancomycin, however c. dif testing was negative x 3.
Flex sig was recommended done on [**10-13**] showing normal mucosa in the sigmoid colon (biopsied).
## Acute Renal Failure:  On [**10-7**], pt was noted to have a non-gap metabolic acidosis with a creatinine of 1.5.
A vanco level was 57.
Renal biopsy done on [**10-18**] c/w ATN.
Creatinine was stable around 3.4 off dialysis.
- Follow electrolytes - Outpatient renal f/u scheduled.
However, there was concern that renal failure, diarrhea and rising LDH may be related, however renal and GI biopsies were not consistent with lymphoma.
Please follow up in oncology clinic to check your blood cell and platelet counts tomorrow.
