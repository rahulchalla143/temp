CT at OSH showed Intracranial hemorhhage.
INR was found to be 6.4 (takes coumadin for h/o DVT this year).
On initial evaluation by neurology ER resident, she was noted to be unresponsive, moving all four extremities spontaneously (L>R), with brain-stem reflexes intact and withdrawing X4 to pain.
Repeat INR here at [**Hospital1 18**] at 0830 showed INR of 3.2.
3rd INR is pending at this time.
Off propofol, exam shows no response to voice commands.
Reflexes 2+ at brachrad/biceps/triceps/patella.

Admission CT Head: CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A large left frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage is again noted.
There is questionable minimal increase in prominence of the caudal portion of the hemorrhage in comparison with the examination of several hours earlier.
CT C Spine: 1.
EEG [**6-30**]: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording there were frequent bursts of mixed frequency slowing with a generalized distribution.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
EEG [**7-3**]: TIME SAMPLES: Throughout the recording, there is continuous slowing of the left hemisphere in the mixed [**11-30**] Hz delta and [**3-3**] Hz theta frequency range.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Normal cardiac rhythm with a rate of 84 bpm.
AUTOMATIC SPIKE DETECTIONS: There were 103 entries in these files.
EEG [**7-4**]: TIME SAMPLES: Throughout the recording, there is a persistent moderate voltage slowing in the [**11-30**] Hz delta frequency range and intermittent theta frequency slowing over the entire left hemisphere with left temporal emphasis.
As the study progressed, there are initially isolated sharp features over the left temporal region with phase  reversing around T3 and runs of semi-rhythmic 5 Hz theta frequency slowing in the left central region lasting up to 20 seconds.
AUTOMATIC SPIKE DETECTIONS: There were 79 entries in these files.
CARDIAC MONITOR: There is a normal cardiac rhythm with a rate of 90 bpm.
EEG [**7-8**]: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording, there are intermittent  bicentral sharp slowing seen independently occasionally followed by a slow wave.
HYPERVENTILATION: Was not performed due to the patient's clinical condition.
Given the patient's clinical history and EEG findings, EEG monitoring might be of benefit.
CT Head [**7-8**]: Comparison with the prior study of [**2151-7-1**], reveals reduction in the density of the large hemorrhage, but negligible change in its degree of mass effect or surrounding edema.
TTE [**7-9**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
BP was initially maintained below 140 with Labetalol IV, and repeat imaging showed stability of the hemorrhage.
INR was corrected with FFP and proplex.
Over the first 24 hours, her exam was felt to be out of proportion with findings on CT.
On [**7-7**] had GTC seizure in the early morning hours.
Vitals were all initially stable with tachycardia, but became hypotensive in post-ictal period.
Depakote levels should be checked QOD at rehab and dose titrated accordingly.
Her swallowing was discussed several times with her son and HCP, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 111356**], who felt that he did not want to subject his mother to a PEG tube at this juncture, and was hopeful that with more time she would pass a swallow evaluation.
We discussed with him that there was a chance that she may not to regain her swallowing abilities, which he understood, but he maintained that he wanted to give her more time before making the decision to proceed with PEG.
Neuro exam on discharge was significant for diffuse mild L sided weakness ([**3-3**] in all muscles groups), trace movement of R ankle but 0/5 strength of all muscle groups on the right, and some inattention and perseveration, as well as problems following complex commands.
Was hypotensive to 80s/50s and initially did not respond to fluid boluses (3 boluses of 500cc NS each).
Had echo (please see results section) which showed mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid antero-septum, distal LV and apex, EF 35%.
She should have a repeat TTE when she is more medically stable to f/u these findings.
BP stable for several days with no IV boluses required prior to discharge.
HEME: INR was initially corrected with FFP and proplex.
Serial INRs were performed and she required a few additional units of FFP over the first 48 hours.
INR was stable at 1.0-1.2 after HOD #3. .
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day).
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed.
Valproate Sodium 250 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: 7.5 mL PO Q6H (every 6 hours).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Left frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage 2) Generalized tonic-clonic seizure   Discharge Condition: stable, tolerating medications   Discharge Instructions: 1) Please return for increasing weakness, trouble speaking, inability to take medications, uncontrolled bleeding, vomiting and fevers.
