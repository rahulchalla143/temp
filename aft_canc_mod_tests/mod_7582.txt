[**5-31**] CT Head w/o Contrast: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a hyperdense ill-defined 3.2 x 1.9 cm mass at the right frontovertex that appears to be extra-axial in location with slight mass effect on the subjacent cortex and minimal subfalcine herniation (approximately 5 mm of midline shift).
If further evaluation is necessary (unclear, given current clinical scenario), comparison with any previous cross-sectional study, as well as MRI (including post-contrast, fat-suppressed sequences) may be of help.
[**5-31**] CTA and CT torso TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed prior to and following the administration of IV contrast (130 cc IV Optiray).
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Multiple enhancing masses are seen within the liver, new since [**2128-1-22**] and consistent with metastases from patient's known metastatic breast cancer.
CT OF THE PELVIS: The patient is status post sigmoid resection.
[**6-2**] MRI Brain HEAD MRI  TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1, T2, diffusion-weighted, and post-gadolinium sequences were obtained.
Additionally, a previously identified dural-based mass, predominantly located at the cranial right-sided vertex with midline extension to involve the left- sided vertex appears to have mild amount of homogeneous enhancement in association with thickening of the dura and dural enhancement, also suggestive of a dural metastatic lesion.
THORACIC SPINE:  TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial images of the thoracic spine were obtained.
Comparison was made with the previous MRI examination of [**2127-6-23**].
As seen on the previous lumbar spine MRI of [**2128-3-7**], there is a pathologic fracture of L1 vertebra visualized with retropulsion.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-4-20**], new regional left  ventricular systolic dysfunction is now seen c/w CAD and the severity of  mitral regurgitation has increased.
No baseline LV dysfunction or valvular disease on recent echo but new murmur concerning for MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10718**] appeared to occur in setting of significant HTN, ?
Unclear which precipitated which but her blood pressure was well-controlled on dishcarged and she had no further episodes while in-house.
BP initially controlled with nitro gtt but this was weaned before she was transferred to OMED and her BP was well-controlled w/ toprol and the additional of lisinopril.
Blood sent/urine sent and negative.
Now with evidence on imaging concerning for mets to head, new mets to liver and elsewhere in abd.
She was given the news of the spread of her disease and an MRI was performed of her brain and spine.
Lidoderm 5 %(700 mg/patch) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Sig: One (1) patch Topical once a day: place patch, remove after 12 hours.
It is very important that you have good blood pressure control (goal <120/80).
We added a blood pressure medication call lisinopril to your regimen.
