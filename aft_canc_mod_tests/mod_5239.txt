She was mildly diuresed with furosemide with good urine output and no electrolyte abnormalities.
She was placed on a heparing drip which was titrated to a PTT of 60 - 80.
She remained in the SICU for oxygen saturation monitoring and made steady progress on advancing her tube feeds.
Her tube feeds were steadily advanced to her goal rate of 50cc/hr.
On POD 7 her heparin drip was stopped and she passed her grape juice PO test showing no extravasation to the JP drain.
