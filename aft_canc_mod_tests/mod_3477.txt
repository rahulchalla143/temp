His mediastinoscopy and mediastinal lymph node staging by VATS AP window dissection was negative for nodal spread.
The patient had marginal pulmonary function tests and we did try to clarify this further with both VQ testing which revealed passable reserves following a left upper lobectomy with an expected predicted postoperative FEV1 of 48% and DLCO of 41%.

Respiratory: He required aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs and chest PT to Right lung to maintain oxygen saturations in the high 90's.
Serial chest films showed opacification of the left hemithorax, right clear lung.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x 3.
He remained in sinus rhythm with heart rate in the 50-60's.
With gental hydration his creatinine level improved to his base of 1.0 and good urine output.
