Initial VS on arrival to ED: T 97.2 HR 66 BP 97/52 RR 16 Sats 94% RA.
CXR showed RML opacity essentially unchanged from prior films.
Pt went to radiology for a CTA which showed bilateral PEs in the proximal LUL, LLL & RUL.
Of note, pt was hypotensive with sbps in 80s and Levophed was started.
Amiodarone was stopped and BP improved to the 100-110 range.
CT head was performed and revealed new hyperdense lesions suggestive of new mets, thus decision was made to avoid lysis.
Due to a positive serratus muscle margin, a re-excision of the right chest wall was performed on [**2149-2-28**].
Of note, however, her most recent CT scan of the torso, obtained on [**2155-6-18**], demonstrated multiple new liver lesions and enlargement of the prior hepatic metastasis, involvement of multiple new foci in the skeleton with multiple new lytic and sclerotic lesions, and multiple new pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal nodes.

[**2157-1-31**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %) with inferior, infero-lateral and apical akinesis.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
UENIs and LENIs revealed R popliteal DVT.
CXR essentially unchanged, UA neg and Blood Cx sent.
Sputum gram-stain negative and preliminary cultures did not show any organisms.
RUQ u/s was negative for acute cholecystitis.
CT head revealed dural-based metastatic disease.
