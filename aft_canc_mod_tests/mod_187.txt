Initial VS were 97.9 94 135/94 24 98% on NRB.
The intubation was complicated by the ETT being placed in R main stem bronchus initially.
CT torso shows a complex, likely malignant effusion, lung mass and breast mass;  In the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] urgent femoral line was placed, which was not done under completely sterile conditions.
In the ED she was given levofloxacin 500mg IV x1 and CTX 1 gm IV x1 for presumed PNA.

Pathology: Right breast biopsy 1.
ADDENDUM: FISH assay for HER-2/neu gene amplification was performed by US LABS, [**Street Address(2) 7630**], [**Location (un) 7631**], [**Numeric Identifier 7632**]: Result:  NOT AMPLIFIED Estrogen Receptor: Interpretation:  Positive (>1% of tumor cells positive) Progesterone Receptor: Interpretation:  Positive (>1% of tumor cells positive)  CXR [**2160-3-22**]: Right middle and lower lobe consolidation with associated moderate effusion.
CT head w/o contrast [**2160-3-22**]: Multiple areas of small hypodensities in the brain could represent small intracranial metastases.
An MR may be obtained for further evaluation.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis [**2160-3-22**]: 1.
A malignant effusion cannot be excluded.
CT findings suggest right heart strain with enlargement of the right ventricle with obliteration of the right middle lobe pulmonary artery.
This examination was not intended for evaluation of the pulmonary arteries.
If further evaluation is of clinical concern, then a dedicated CTPA may be obtained.
The ET tube terminates in the right mainstem bronchus and should be pulled back by 3 cm and a repeat radiograph should be obtained to document appropriate positioning.
TTE [**2160-3-25**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CTA chest [**2160-3-28**]: 1.
MRI head [**2160-3-30**]: 1.
Right shoulder x-ray [**2160-4-7**]: IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the right shoulder demonstrates no gross abnormality.
CXR [**2160-4-17**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral pleural effusions have minimally increased in extent.
Pleural fluid [**2160-4-9**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Pleural fluid [**2160-4-10**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
EKG: [**2159-3-23**] 3:52 - NSR HR 90, RAD with S1, Q3, T3, poor baseline.
IP was consulted and 800cc of transudative pleural fluid were drained from the right chest, fluid cytology was negative for malignant cells, pleurex catheter was left in place.
She used a schedule of 2 hours on and 2 hours off NIV, and over 2 days she was able to extend her times off of NIV so that she only used it at night.
Repeat chest xray showed minimal reaccumulation of pleural effusion by time of discharge and IP inserted pleurex catheter on day prior to discharge for further drainage.
Multiple pleural fluid samples were analyzed; they were largely transudative without malignant cells.
Hypercarbia resolved by time of discharge and bicarb levels were normal.
# Metastatic breast cancer: Records from OSH showed that right breast biopsy showing infiltrating ductal carcinoma with ductal carcinoma in situ, tumor grade II/III, in 5 of 6 biopsies.
Biopsies were taken here on [**2160-3-22**] showing invasive ductal carcinoma, high grade.
Additional imaging studies showed metastases in the lungs, possibly liver, both adrenal glands, and also possibly in the brain.
# Blood pressure instability: Pt became hyoptensive to systolic 60s following intubation, requiring pressors in the ICU.
Echo and CTA chest shows mild RV dilation and hypokinesis and mild to moderate PAH (likely [**3-5**] to malignant infiltration), but no indication to stent PA.
Her blood pressures stabilized, and she was able to be taken off of the Midodrine as well.
However, BP was stable, systolic 110s-120s, after her transfer from ICU to the floor and prior to discharge.
Described the pain as right sided, near her breast mass, and was tender on palpation of epigastrium towards the right.
EKG showed ST elevation in V2 and nonspecific TWIs; trop was 0.03 and downtrended to 0.02.

You will need a repeat chest x-ray in two weeks to see if the fluid in your lungs has reaccumulated.
Biopsies of your right breast were consistent with invasive cancer.
Additional scans showed that the cancer had spread to your lungs, your adrenal glands and possibly your liver.
