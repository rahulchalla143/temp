She underwent CT scan of her chest for re-staging of her lung cancer on [**2159-8-6**], which demonstrated an increasingly large pericardial effusion (had been previously noted on PET scan in [**Month (only) 116**]).
She was seen today in clinic today by her oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who noted her complaints of worsening dyspnea on exertion and referred her to the ED for echocardiogram to evaluate for possible tamponade.
In the ED, echocardiogram showed brief right atrial collapse and impaired filling of the right ventricle consistent with early tamponade physiology.
Immediate post-procedure echo showed small residual pericardial effusion with no Fluid was sent for cytology.
Based on renal biopsy (RCC, clear cell type) and bronchial brushings (likely adenocarcinoma) these are two separate cancers.

- ECHO [**2159-8-9**] (pre-procedure): Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
- ECHO [**2159-8-9**] (post-procedure): Effusion is loculated.
- ECHO [**2159-8-11**] (post-procedure):  Focused views s/p pericardial drainage.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The effusion is very small anterior to the right ventricle and significantly improved compared to the prior study dated [**2159-8-9**].There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Post-procedure echo showed a small loculated residual effusion with no evidence of tamponade physiology.
Cytology was negative for malignacy, but suspicion remains high for a malignant etiology.
Pulsus was followed throughout her hospital course, and at the time of post-procedure echo pulses was 12 by doppler.
Orthostatics were checked at discahrge and were normal.
# ANEMIA: Her Hct has trended down over the past 6 months.
She remained afebrile and normotensive throughout her course, pericardial and urine cultures were negative and CXR showed no evidence of pulmonary process.
She was also scheduled for an outpatient echo that should be followed up by her PCP/Oncologist.
After this procedure we performed another Echocardiogram to confirm that the fluid had not reaccumulated and felt you were safe to return home.
