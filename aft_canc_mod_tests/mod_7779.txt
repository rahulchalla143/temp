Chest imaging revealed bilateral loculated pleural effusions prompting left VATS and chest tube placement on [**2122-7-21**] with the pleural fluid growing MSSA.
She had a CTA on [**2122-7-23**] that did not reveal central or lobar PE, but segmental/subsegmental PE could not be ruled out.

Initial blood cultures grew MSSA and Enterococcus and she was started on Vancomycin.
Chest imaging revealed bilateral loculated pleural effusions prompting left VATS and chest tube placement on [**2122-7-21**] with the pleural fluid growing MSSA.
She had a CTA on [**2122-7-23**] that did not reveal central or lobar PE, but segmental/subsegmental PE could not be ruled out.
Blood cultures negative since [**2122-7-17**], left sided pleural fluid growing MSSA.
The pleural fluid demonstrated frank purulence.
During the procedure the patient required Levophed support and in the PACU, SBP remained in 80's, MAPs 60's despite 2L LR.
Respirations were unlabored and an ABG obtained prior to transfer was 7.38/42/164.
She was transfered to the MICU with 5 chest tubes in place and requiring pressor support.
The patient was briefly transitioned to Nafcillin on [**7-31**]; however, subsequent blood work revealed [**Last Name (un) **] and likely AIN, with Cr plateauing at 1.9, up from her baseline of 1.1-1.4.
Her BP has been stable on the medicine floor, with SBPs ranging from 120s to 140s.
Eos in urine on [**7-31**], since resolved, prompted concern for AIN.
The patient has been transitioned back to Vancomycin, and her renal function has been stable.
# BILATERAL EMPYEMAS, CHEST TUBES, DYSPNEA - Pt was noted to have increasing dyspnea, and bilateral pleural effusions were noted on [**2122-7-19**].
CT confirmed the presence of loculated pleural effusions.
The last chest tube was successfully removed on [**2122-7-29**], and subsequent CXR has shown no return of effusions with notmal lung spaces.
Cultures from empyemas were positive for MSSA.
She had her port removed, with the area debrided.
Cultures from the infected port grew MSSA.
# ANEMIA - evidence of downward trending hematocrit is likely due to worsening chronic disease.
Pt has been consistently guaiac negative, and a hemolytic work-up was negative for hemolysis.
At time of discharge, Pt's hematocrit is at 25.
Since returning from the ICU, pt has received 2 units of blood on [**7-31**], with hematocrit stable at 25 since.
19. ondansetron HCl (PF) 4 mg/2 mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for nausea.
Pt's trough should have a blood level between 15 and 20.
Please adjust the dose according to the vancomycin trough, which should be between 15 and 20.
