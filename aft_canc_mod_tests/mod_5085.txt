Her moderate pericardial effusion with early tamponade was found incidentally in [**2152-12-24**] upon followup chest imaging during an admission for digital amputation for treatment of Raynauds.
Labs and imaging significant for lactate 5.6, [**Last Name (un) **], hyponatremia.
Bedside echo showed pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
CT head negative for lesions.
CXR showed large heart.
Vitals on transfer were 97.6, 113/64, p108, rr 25, 95 RA.
Oncologic Hx: (adapted from OMR notes) [**2138**]: Right breast DCIS, treated [**2138**] with lumpectomy and radiation in [**Hospital1 392**], MA.
[**2-/2151**]: Left upper lung nodule when CT was obtained as work-up for carotid stenosis.
Pathology was (+) for non-small cell lung cancer w/ non-squamous histology, TTF1 (-),  cytokeratin [**4-29**] & p63 (-).
[**Date range (1) 75315**]: s/p 4 cycles pemetrexed/6AUC [**2152-9-7**]: admission for pancytopenia, hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia/hypophosphatemia [**2152-9-22**]: VATS with wedge resection of a RUL and a RML nodule, with frozen pathology c/w metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

Prominent ventricles and sulci are unchanged, compatible with mild global age-related volume loss.
Portable TTE ([**2153-4-7**] at 1:21:47 AM) Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the findings of the prior complete study of [**2153-1-12**], the size of the pericardial effusion has increased significantly and tamponade physiology is now appreciated.
Portable TTE ([**2153-4-7**] at 10:25:39 AM) Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Portable TTE ([**2153-4-9**] at 11:14:08 AM) The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Compared with the prior focused study dated [**2152-4-6**], the pericardial effusion is still trivial and limited to the anterior RV free wall.
# Pericardial Tamponade: Upon admission, the patient was noted to have a pericardial effusion with diastolic collapse of the right ventricle c/w tamponade physiology.
The drain was subsequently pulled and repeat TTE showed trivial pericardial effusion.
The patient was discharged home with instructions to follow up closely and obtain a repeat TTE within 2 weeks of discharge.
