CT head was performed showing interval increase in hemorrhage around the mass, now with acute area of hemorrhage 2.6 cm x 1.4 cm.
Per ED team, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1151**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from the Neuro-Oncology Service reviewed the imaging and did not recommend any changes to current antiepilectic and steroid regimen at this time.

Patient's EKG was unchanged compared to prior.
Chest X-ray was without evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.
Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS:  Tempperature 96.3 F, blood pressure 160/88, pulse 65, respiration 18, and oxygen saturation 96% in room air.

(1) Altered Mental Status:  His head CT shows increased hemorrhage around known glioblastoma multiforme.
It is not clear whether his symptoms on presentation are secondary to this hemorrhage, increased edema from his tumor, possibly a new ischemic stroke, or the UTI.
(2) Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage:  Patient with acute mental status change found to have intraparenchymal hemorrhage at site of glioblastoma multiforme on CT scan.
Serial neurological exams were done and there was clinical improvement.
Goal BP was systolic blood pressure in the 140's-160's.
(3) Diabetes:  This was poorly controlled on presentation with fingerstick blood glucose >350 and remained >400 upon transfer to floor.
(4) Urinary Tract Infection:  This was found on admission, initially treated with bactrim.
EKG unchanged compared to prior on presentation.
Patient cardiac enzymes were stable at 0.09 and CK-MB was flat at 4.
BP stabilized on modified home regimen.
Please make the following changes to your medications: -START cefazolin 1g intravenously twice daily for 4 days for your urinary tract infection -REDUCE Labetolol to 400mg daily for your blood pressure - STOP aspirin 325mg once daily  Please continue all other medications as prescribed.
