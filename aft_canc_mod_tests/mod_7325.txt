Because of her recurrent respiratory symptoms a chest radiograph was checked at the outpatient clinic and showed possible worsening of her right sided pleural effusion as well as an enlarged cardiac silhouette so the patient was referred for outpatient TTE on day of admission.
After this echo showed a large pericardial effusion she was sent to the ED to be seen by cardiology.
On arrival in the ED, HR 120's, BP 150/100's, RR 30's.
Post-procedure TTE showed only slight residual effusion.

# Cardiac tamponade: The patient had a large (2-3 cm) pericardial effusion on echo and demonstrated tamponade physiology.
Eventually, analysis of the fluid from the pericardiocentesis revealed malignant cells.
On [**2198-7-26**] a CT chest was performed which better demonstrated a large right sided pleural effusion.
Her oxygenation improved and she was sent home without oxygen supplement.
Report to the [**Location (un) 861**] Radiology Department for a Chest X-Ray 45 minutes before your appointment.
