[**2104-11-16**] CT ABD AND PELVIS Preliminary Report !!
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 30689**] is a 55 year old male with human immunodeficinecy virus (HIV) (CD4 224, viral load 277 [**1-/2104**]), Hepatitis C (VL 1,350,000 IU/mL [**11/2103**]), and gastric lymphoma that was diagnosed 8 years ago who presented with nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, episodes of bright red blood per rectum, and increased confusion; he was found to have Shigella enteritis with bacteremia, as well as acute kidney injury, hyponatremia, anion gap acidosis and transient hpoxia.
CT with evidence of colitis as well as thickening of the distal esophagus, and MR pelvis showed extensive inflammation of the colon.
His stool studies came back positive for Shigella flexneri.
Additionally, blood cultures grew Shigella, indicative of translocation from the gut into the bloodstream.
MRI pelvis confirmed absence of other rectal pathology, such as rectal abscess or fistula formation as a result of flexiseal presence.
# Shigella bacteremia: Blood cultures demonstrated Shigella in bloodstream, likely from translocation from GI tract.
His elevated white count and bandemia was consistent with systemic infection.
Urine electrolytes and FENa consistent with prerenal etiology.
# Hyponatremia: Patient initially with sodium of 125, most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia secondary to diarrheal losses along with decreased PO intake.
# Anion gap acidosis: The patient with anion gap of 17 on admission, with lactate of 1.9.
LDH 169, which is not high enough to be consistent with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] CXR without convincing evidence of PCP.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # HIV: High viral load and low CD4 count were demonstrated during this admission, most likely from poor adherence.
Your CAT and MRI showed that you have inflammation of your colon.
Your stool and blood cultures grew a bacteria that caused this illness.
