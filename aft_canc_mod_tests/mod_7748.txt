[**2187-10-1**]: Exploratory laparotomy, evacuation of intra-abdominal hematoma, cholecystectomy, intraoperative ultrasound.
She was noted to have elevated liver function tests including alkaline phosphatase of 325 and a bilirubin of 19.5.
CT scan of the abdomen on [**9-7**], demonstrated intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation of the left lobe with abrupt cutoff at the porta hepatis suspicious for cholangiocarcinoma.
A followup triphasic CT scan of the abdomen on [**9-17**], demonstrated invasive tumor in the hilum of the liver suggestive of cholangiocarcinoma.
An ERCP demonstrated a malignant- appearing stricture at the bifurcation extending to the left and right main hepatic ducts with upstream dilatation.
She did have a large intra-abdominal hematoma demonstrated on CT scan.
She did develop some ischemia of the left lateral segment with a rise in transaminases and also a small infarct demonstrated on CT scan post embolization.
Her bilirubin has also increased from a nadir of 10.1 to 22.8.
The rising bilirubin was thought to either be representative of absorption of the hematoma or compromised liver function post embolization or a combination.
Physical Exam: GENERAL: Alert and oriented; no acute distress; obviously jaundiced HEENT: Mucous membranes moist and pink; scleral icterus present; no occular or nasal discharge; thyroid without enlargemement or masses CV: Regular rate and rhythm; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops PULMONARY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally ABDOMEN: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, PTC catheters in R. abdomen capped and without leakage; incision along R. costal border clean and with steri strips in place - small amount of serous drainage from pin-point are [**2-12**] of the way along the incision from the R. with no fluid collection palpated and no fluctuance noted; no surrounding erythema; R. flank ecchymoses extendes to midline of back and resolving EXTREMITIES: No swelling or edema bilaterally   Pertinent Results: On Admission: [**2187-9-23**] WBC-9.0 RBC-3.98* Hgb-12.3 Hct-36.8 MCV-93 MCH-31.0 MCHC-33.4 RDW-15.0 Plt Ct-199 PT-15.7* PTT-25.6 INR(PT)-1.4* Glucose-350* UreaN-7 Creat-0.4 Na-135 K-4.2 Cl-96 HCO3-27 AnGap-16 ALT-39 AST-44* AlkPhos-235* Amylase-520* TotBili-18.8* Lipase-905* Albumin-3.1* Calcium-9.0 Phos-3.1 Mg-2.3  Brief Hospital Course: 52 year old female admitted with jaundice, and status post ERCP demonstrating an intra-hepatic biliary mass concerning for cholangiocarcinoma.
The patient's post-procedure course was complicated by blood noted in her drains and transfer to the ICU for hemodynamic instability (Hct of 23.7) secondary to bleeding from a small branch of the L. hepatic artery (likely trangressed along the course of the L. PTBD catheter).
She was noted to develop some ischemia of the left lateral segment of her liver with a rise in transaminases, and a small infarct was demonstrated on CT scan ([**2187-9-28**]) post-embolization.
Her bilirubin has also increased from a nadir of 10.1 to 22.8 although her transhepatic catheters were draining bilious fluid well.
The rising bilirubin was thought to either be representative of absorption of the intra-abdominal hematoma caused by her L. hepatic artery bleed, possibly secondary to compromised liver function post-embolization or a combination of both.
On [**2187-10-1**] (hospital day #7) the patient was taken to the OR for for exploratory laparotomy, evacuation of intra-abdominal hematoma, cholecystectomy, and possible common bile duct excision, possible right hepatic lobectomy, possible Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, and possible lymph node dissection.
Additionally the left lateral segment of he liver was noted to be extremely small (the left lobe was estimated to be 600cc on CT scan but appeared significantly smaller than that intra-operatively).
A bronchoscopy was performed on post-op day #1 for a R. mucous plug, after which the patient was successfully extubated.
On post-op day #2 the patient was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs for a Hct of 24 without evidence of active bleed.
The following day the patient continued to do well, was started on a regular diet, and began Ciprofloxacin 500mg daily prophylactically as her R. posterior PTC and L. hepatic PTC were noted to have decreased output (output from the R. anterior drain remained high)in addition to upward trending serum bilirubin levels (elevated to 20.3).
On post-op day #4 the patient returned to IR for a cholangiogram to evaluate the patentcy of the R. anterior/R.
Following the procedure the patient did well, her serum bilirubin began trending down, and her R. posterior and L. biliary drains were capped on post-op days 6 and 7 (respectively).
Ursodiol 300mg PO TID was begun on post-op day 7 for her elevated bilirubin levels although through-out her hospital course the patient denied itching or other symptoms of hyperbilirubinemia.
By post-op day #8 the patient's pain was under good control, she was taking good PO, ambulating, her serum bilirubin was down-trending, other laboratory values were stable, and her incision was noted to be healing well with a minimal amount of serous drainage from a pin-point spot approx [**2-12**] of the way along the incision from the right.
