# Acute renal failure: Patient's ARF peaked at creatinine of 6.4, just barely made it without requiring dialysis.
Last creatinine at 1.7.
# Anemia: Hct was slightly lower than baseline, as above labs were consistent with hemolysis but smears failed to show abundant schistocytes.
Baseline was in the low 30s and based on iron studies from [**5-18**] consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
vitB 12 low at 147, folate was normal.
Patient was started on B12 repletion of 1 week of injections, which did not yet resolve his anemia but his B12 levels returned to [**Location 213**].
His metoprolol was titrated down while being uptitrated on diltiazem.
