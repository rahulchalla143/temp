She presented to the [**Hospital6 6640**] in [**Location (un) 8545**] where a CT scan of the head was done and showed a small right occipital hypodensity 1 cm X 1 cm near the surface of the brain and right-sided 2-cm X 1.5-cm area of hypodensity in the right parietal paramedian region.
Temperature was 98.2, blood pressure 143/56, heart rate 91, respiratory rate 21, oxygen saturation 93% on room air.
Cardiovascular examination showed a left Port-A-Cath site with S1 and S2 normal, and no added sounds.
Rectal examination was deferred.
Neurologic examination revealed she was alert and oriented times three with fluent speech.
Sensory examination was within normal limits to light touch and pinprick, and the biceps, triceps, ankles, and knees were 2+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 11.6, hematocrit 45.1, platelet count 200.
PT 17, PTT 44, INR 2.
Sodium 137, potassium 3.3, chloride 103, bicarbonate 25, BUN 11, creatinine 0.8, glucose 190.
Calcium 9.
MRI with contrast and MR venogram were done to rule out sinus thrombosis, and coagulations were repleted after the fresh frozen plasma, and the patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient remained in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for approximately four days and was discharged to the floor after the MRI was felt to be stable and consistent with the CT scan findings, and the patient went to the hospital floor on [**2158-8-8**].
She was sent down for a repeat CT scan which showed a slight increased bleed, and the patient was readmitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient's neurologic examination was stable.
She went for an angiogram on [**8-12**] in the early morning hours, and this showed an occluded left internal jugular vein with drainage through collateral circulation, and the superior sagittal sinus with good drainage.
The patient was subsequently returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with no sequelae from the angiogram, and a head CT was scheduled for the following day.
The head CT showed no significant change from the prior head CT of [**8-11**], and the patient subsequently was returned to the floor on the morning of [**2158-8-14**].
