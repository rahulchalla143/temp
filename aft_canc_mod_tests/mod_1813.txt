CT NECK: 1.
However, if further imaging evaluation is required, ultrasound could be performed.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
CT HEAD in ED 1.
Large ventricles, which may be related to involutional change.
EKG Sinus tachycardia Frequent supraventricular extrasystoles ST junctional depression is nonspecific No previous tracing .

Endocarditis also unlikely given ECHO report and negative follow up blood cultures though can't exclude with TTE.
CT of neck showed swelling of R submandibular gland w/o evidence of abscess, unlikely cause of sepsis.
Neck mass: As per [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team, CT scan suggestive of benign process; unlikely to be abscess.
