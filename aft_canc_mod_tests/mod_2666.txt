Successful 15-gauge core biopsy of a soft tissue mass within a left-sided rib, as discussed above.
Stable pleural effusions and diffuse lung disease within the partially imaged chest, as previously described on multiple recent chest CT exams.
Although this CT-guided biopsy procedure did not include an exhaustive evaluation of the liver parenchyma, these lesions are highly suspicious for metastatic disease.
They do not appear significantly changed from the most recent chest CT exam, but they cannot be identified on the contrast-enhanced chest CT exam of [**2121-9-4**].
Cultures on admission were notable for Klebsiella in her urine and Klebsiella and MRSA in her sputum.
Blood cultures were all negative while subsequent sputum cultures and culture of drainage fluid from her Right chest revealed continued Klebsiella and MRSA; a subseqenet urine culture after admission was negative.
Her CT scan of her head was unremarkable.
She had a creatinine of 2.7 on her admission which was not remarkable from her prior admission earlier in the month, and she had a dylantin level of 7.9.
She underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2121-11-11**] which demonstrated malacia and secretions in her right lower and right middle lobe.
This demonstrated an anterior compartment in the apex of her right pleural space that was well-healed and granulating, but a posterior compartment with moderate amount of debris not draining through a pigtail catheter.
On [**11-26**], however, Pt had suddent onset of bleeding and hemoptysis with INR of 4.8.
Bronchoscopy done on [**11-27**] with evidence of clot but no active bleeding in the LUL/LLL.
Sputum cx after bronch on [**12-3**] and [**12-4**] positive for klebsiella pneumonia.
A bedside swallow eval performed on [**12-10**], which the pt failed secondary to frequent coughing.
A Bronch performed which showed mod mucous plugs and increased secretions.
A specimen sent at that time was postivie for coag+ staph aureus.
CT chest done on [**1-1**] with evidence of increasing mass lesion on two left lateral ribs.
A biopsy was performed which showed metastatic disease.
