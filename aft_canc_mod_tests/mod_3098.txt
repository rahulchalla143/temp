Estimated tumor volume is approximately 8.96 cm3, slightly increased from [**2184**] exam where it measured 7.3 cm3.
CT Head [**7-30**]: FINDINGS: Patient is status post right frontal subcraniotomy.
The suprasellar lesion seen on the previous study has been resected.
MRI showed postoperative changes with resection of the subfrontal tumor without residual enhancing mass lesion identified.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
