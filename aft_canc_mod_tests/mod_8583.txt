Patient's labs drawn by Thoracic Surgery [**2166-4-3**] were as follows: Tbili 10.8, ALP 283, AST 220, ALT 81, so he was called by primary care NP and asked to present to the ED.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.6 P 104 BP 142/70 R 18 Sat 96% RA.
Labs were notable for Na 131, Ca [**69**], Cr 1.6 from baseline of 0.8.
LFTs were remarkable for AST 352, ALT 76, TBili 15.8, Direct Bili 12, Alk Phos 229.
Ammonia was 105.
INR was noted to be 1.5.
Blood and urine cultures were sent, with urinalysis unremarkable.
Head CT was performed and showed no acute process with known cerebellar lesion on MRI not visualized.
Right upper quadrant U/S showed CBD with 2 mm diameter and no intrahepatic biliary dilation, with no evidence of cholecystitis or focal liver lesions seen on limited images obtained.
Vitals in ED prior to transfer were as follows: T98.4 HR 103 166/79 93% RA.

RADIOLOGY: PET SCAN [**2166-4-9**]: 1.
MRI HEAD [**2166-4-9**]: 3-mm lesion within the left cerebellar hemisphere with enhancement seen on only axial post-gadolinium images are not clearly visualized on the post-gadolinium MP-RAGE images as described above.
However, given the small size of this solitary if further confirmation is clinically required (for therapeutic purposes), repeat T1 post-gadolinium axial and coronal images of the posterior fossa with 3-mm section thickness would help.
CT HEAD [**2166-4-11**]: 1.
RUQ U/S [**2166-4-12**]: 1.
Limited images demonstrating no focal liver lesion, though correlation with recent PET-CT (reportedly showing focal liver lesions concerning for metastases) is advised.
CXR [**2166-4-12**]: There is again seen an area of consolidation projecting over the left base compatible with known infiltrate in the left lower lobe abutting the major fissure.
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
CXR revealed PNA for which the patient was treated initially with levofloxacin and metronidazole and later broadened to cefepime and metronidazole.
Diagnostic paracentesis and liver biopsy were performed.
Liver biopsy pathology revealed findings consistent with lung cancer.
