Redemonstrated is a 1.6 x 1.4 x 1.1 mm T1 post-hyperintense lesion with hemosiderin ring, consistent with cavernous hemangioma.
The ventricles, sulci and extra-axial CSF-containing spaces have normal size and configuration.
Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2191-1-6**] 5:50 PM Status post resection of a right inferior frontal cavernous hemangioma with expected post-surgical pneumocephalus.
Thin rim of hyperdense material layering along the right frontal convexity could represent blood products.
MRI [**2191-1-7**]: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: On [**1-6**] she electively presented and underwent a craniotomy and resection of the right sided lesion.
The patient was hypertensive and the blood pressure was controlled with hydralazine.
The postoperative Head Ct was negative for hemorrhage/ consistent with expected postoperative changes.
The post operative exam revealed right facial and periorbital edema and crepitus.
On [**1-7**], post operative MRI of the Brain was performed which was consistent with edema in the ACA territory.
?You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast.
