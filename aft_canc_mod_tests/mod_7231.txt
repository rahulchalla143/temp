Because of a rising CA [**93**]-29 a PET scan was done on [**2174-5-16**] which revealed: There is focal abnormal uptake of FDG throughout the spine, bilateral ribs, bilateral clavicles, left scapula, left humerus, sternum, bilateral iliac bones.
A PET scan done on [**2176-5-21**] showed dramatic improvement in osseous metastatic disease and resolution of FDG avidity and increased sclerosis of the previously FDG avid skeletal metastases.
On [**2177-9-2**] she had a PET  scan which showed: 1.
On [**2178-10-1**] she had a PET scan which shows:  1.

Brief Hospital Course: 78F with met breast CA on gemcitabine, initially admitted for fevers, abdominal pain and leukocytosis, subsequently found to have C. diff colitis, [**Last Name (un) **] and and concern for toxic megacolon  #C. diff colitis with toxic megacolon and sepsis: While on the medicine floor, she was found to have worsening abdominal pain and distention in the setting of C. diff, which was likely related to her recent antibiotics during prior admission for cellulitis.
She had a CT abd/pelvis which confirmed pancolitis and suggested borderline toxic megacolon.
Her blood pressure improved with multiple fluid boluses and she did not require pressors.
However, it is likely she progressed to ATN given her poor urine output despite fluid challenge.
Bladder pressure was also elevated to 16 in the setting of her C. diff pancolitis and toxic megacolon, indicating potential for early abdominal compartment syndrome.
It is unclear whether the hypoxia prior to transfer was due to poor O2 sat [**Location (un) 1131**].
