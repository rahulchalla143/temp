Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History (Per Dr.[**Initials (NamePattern4) 11574**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] note): -[**2103**]: Nodule felt on physical examination, biopsy revealed papillary thyroid cancer and patient underwent a total thyroidectomy.
-As part of initial evaluation, he had an ultrasound done of his neck.
The ultrasound demonstrated three enlarged morphologically abnormal lymph nodes on the left at level IV and further evaluation was recommended.
He then underwent a Thyrogen radioactive iodine uptake scan, which was negative for residual thyroid uptake and had no  evidence of metastatic disease.
He subsequently went on to an ultrasound-guided biopsy and cytology from this procedure was positive for malignant cells consistent with carcinoma.
As a result of this pathology, the patient underwent PET-CT scan, which demonstrated FDG avid nodal disease in the left neck at levels IV and IIa within the right thyroidectomy bed.
Lastly, his PET/CT scan in [**2117-5-20**] revealed stable disease.
His girlfriend and mother are present at the bedside.

DDx is broad and includes pulmonary embolism (possible given tachycardia, hypercoagulable state in setting of neoplasm, and additional oxygen requirement), pulmonary infection (favor atypical infection such as PCP as opposed to acute bacterial pneumonia given lack of fever and leukocytosis), or, more likely rapidly rising tumor burden (favored diagnosis after reviewing his progressive disease on CT scan and discussing with radiology).

NSG recommended platelets >100 before any procedure.
PRBCs were transfused with hct goal >21 or if symptomatic.
Patient underwent cardiac arrest with rhythm of ventricular fibrillation.
CPR was initiated with epinephrine and atropine.
