Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum  [**2135-7-15**]: CT ABD/PELVIS 1.
[**2135-7-16**] Echo  The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
EGD was negative for acute bleed.
Colonoscopy was negative for acute bleed.
CT scan was negative for RP bleed.
Hemolysis labs were negative.
Hct remained stable since last transfusion on [**2135-7-15**]  # hypotension - Initially concerning for GIB given guaic positive stool, decreased HCT, and recent similar admission.
CXR was negative.
Bcx and Ucx were negative Patient was given aggressive IVF and blood as above.
After the colonoscopy he did require levophed briefly, but then was able to maintain BPs without pressor-support.
# confusion - per family, confusion was typical of pt's hospitalizations, and likely multifactorial with contribution from poor neurologic reserve (h/o CVA, chronic vascular changes), hypotension, and possible septic picture.
denies chest pain or dyspnea, and EKG without frank evidence of ischemia though has old LBBB, and worsening TWI and STD in V4-6 in setting of sinus tach and anemia (likely reflects both LVH and some demand ischemia).
- held metoprolol, lisinopril given initial hypotension, then restarted when pt actually became hypertensive on the floor - transfuse to maintain HCT > 27.
Upper and lower endoscopy was done however we could not find the source of the bleeding because it had stopped bleeding by then.
A capsule study has been scheduled for you.
Some changes were made to your medications: - Stopped hydralazine (blood pressure medication) - Stopped Prilosec and instead started Ranitidine - Changed Seroquel from 25 mg twice a day to 25 mg once at bedtime - Added Nystatin cream as needed for fungal infection of the buttocks .
CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis done during this hospitalization showed some changes that should be followed up with a repeat scan in 3 months ([**Month (only) 216**]-[**2135-10-11**]).
Please weigh yourself every morning and call your doctor if weight > 3 lbs.
