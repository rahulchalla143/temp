Cultures from [**Month/Day/Year 19843**] fluid yielded Enterococcus, Yeast (not C albicans) Pseudomonas and he was initially started on fluconazole for the yeast in addition to the Vanco and Zosyn started on admission.
Cholangiogram was performed on [**2187-3-1**] showing a persistent bile leak from the free edge of the residual liver (as previously), and small amount of contrast seen tracking along the insertion tract of the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1968**] tube.
Leakage of contrast is also noted at the anastomosis with jejunum.
On [**2187-3-9**] he underwent ERCP which showed a single stricture of benign appearance  in the mid CBD.
A leak with extravasation of contrast was noted at the site of the stricture in the CBD.
In addition on the same day he underwent paracentesis by Ultrasound-guidance for diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis, with drainage of 1 liter of clear dark yellow fluid.
Cultures did not yield any growth of organisms.
Chest xray was done on [**3-11**] showing increased opacity at the right lung base.
Underlying infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.
He then underwent a thoracentesis on [**3-12**] under CT guidance with removal of 500 cc fluid.
On [**3-16**] he underwent CT of abdomen showing: 1.
If there has been no history of recent manipulation to account for these findings, anastamotic dehiscence cannot be excluded.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Exploratory laparotomy, abdominal washout, drainage of intra-abdominal abscess.
This was aspirated and sent for microbiologic study, which grew out yeast (presumptively not C albicans) and Enterobacter.
The liver was then pulled off the anterior abdominal wall and the large retroperitoneal space seen on CT scan filled with air and pus was found.
Cultures taken from the drains on [**3-27**] continued to grow Enterobacter and yeast-non-albicans.
CT of the abdomen was obtained on [**3-27**] showing: 1.
He was transferred from bed to chair around 9:30 AM and it was noted that his O2 sat dropped to high 80's.
He was placed on O2 via NC at 4L and a chest xray was obtained.
The chest xray was read as Extensive bibasilar atelectasis with possible additional small left pleural effusion.
The patient was having tachypnea, labored breathing and O2 sats were difficult to maintain and he was placed on a non-rebreather and transferred to the Trauma ICU (bed availability) He was intubated immediately after arrival to the ICU, a BAL was performed and an additional chest xray suggested aspiration or pneumonia.
Serial lactates were performed with rising levels, the final Lactate was 16.
