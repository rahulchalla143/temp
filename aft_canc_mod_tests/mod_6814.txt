When EMS arrived patient's vitals were 110/64 86 100% RA, unclear RR.
ABG prior to intubation was 7.42/27/370 on a NRB.
The patient had a CT head which revealed no acute process and had a normal CXR.
Given history of distant breast CA a CTA was performed which revealed no evidence of PE or metastatic disease but did reveal a cirrhotic appearing liver and small ascites on abdominal cuts.
The patient had a tox screen which was normal.

Admission Chest CT: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: An endotracheal tube is seen with the tip at 4.5 cm above the carina.
However, evaluation of the subsegmental branches is limited due to respiratory motion artifact.
This study is not designed for the evaluation of the abdomen, however, the visualized portions of the upper abdomen demonstrate a cirrhotic liver, ascites, borderline enlarged spleen and collateral circulation.
Limited study without evidence of central and segmental PE.
Else the pateint would need a formal diagnostic mamogram to evaluate this lesion further.
Admission MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.
T1 axial, sagittal and coronal images were obtained following gadolinium.
Pre-gadolinium T1 images demonstrate hyperintensities involving the basal ganglia, predominantly the globus pallidus and putamen, but also involvement of the upper brainstem.
If indicated, a followup examination can help for further assessment.
Her most recent INR is 1.3.
