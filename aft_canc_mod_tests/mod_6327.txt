There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-2-11**], the pericardial effusion appears slightly smaller (still mainly anterior).
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is globally depressed (LVEF= 25 %).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-2-14**], the pericardial effusion has resolved.
Left ventricular systolic function is similar (was overestimated on the prior study).

Prominence of the bifrontal CSF spaces, which may be due to parenchymal atrophy or chronic subdural hygromas.
PATHOLOGY  Pathology Examination SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: BONE MARROW (1 JAR) [**2135-2-17**] [**2135-2-18**] [**2135-2-23**] DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 21496**]/ttl  SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS: HYPERCELLULAR MARROW FOR AGE WITH MILD DYSPOIESIS AND LEFT-SHIFTED MYELOPOIESIS, SEE NOTE.
Review of marrow core biopsy shows focal interstitial areas with left-shifted maturation and clusters of immature cells.
By immunohistochemistry, CD34 highlights rare scattered interstitial myeloblasts, which are less than 5% of marrow cellularity.
A CD4 stain highlights scattered small lymphoid cells without definite staining in immature cells.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.
The white blood cell count appears decreased.
Differential count shows 79% neutrophils, 6% bands, 3% monocytes, 11% lymphocytes, less than 1% eosinophils, 1% basophils.
Differential shows: 5% Blasts, 3% Promyelocytes, 11% Myelocytes, 10% Metamyelocytes, 22% Bands/Neutrophils, 2% Plasma cells, 27% Lymphocytes, 20% Erythroid.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation, and consists of a 1.1 cm core biopsy of trabecular bone.
A non-paratrabecular lymphoid aggregate comprised of predominantly small lymphocytes is present, and accounts for 5% of the marrow cellularity.
Cytogenetics studies: see separate report Flow cytometry studies: see separate report Cytogenetics Report BONE MARROW - CYTOGENETICS Procedure Date of [**2135-2-18**] Specimen Type: BONE MARROW - CYTOGENETICS Date and Time Taken: [**2135-2-17**] 5:30 PM Date Processed: [**2135-2-18**] KARYOTYPE: 47,XY,+8[2]/46,XY[18] INTERPRETATION: Two of 20 metaphases contained an extra chromosome 8 (TRISOMY 8).
Location: INPATIENT FISH evaluation for a chromosome 8 aneuploidy was attempted with the Vysis CEP 8 DNA Probe (chromosome 8 alpha satellite DNA) at 8p11.1-q11.1.
He had a MRI head which revealed leptomeningeal involvement.
Arrangements were made for the patient to be seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 15139**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 22114**] at [**Hospital3 3583**].
He developed low grade fevers again shortly before discharge and a repeat CXR showed possible ongoing vs slowly resolving PNA.
WBC initially improved but DIC & tumor lysis were noted to be worsening.
Urine cultures were NGTD x 2.
Renal u/s with no evidence of hydronephrosis.
# Hyperphosphatemia: On [**1-8**] the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] when it was noted that his phosphate level was 11.9 and nephrology thought that urgent dialysis was appropriate.
Corrected serum calcium fell to 7 and ionized calcium was 0.71.
A CTA was done which again revealed pneumonia but no PE.
A TTE was done to evaluate for tamponade and the patient was found to have developed a moderate loculated pericardial effusion but had no signs of tamponade.
A repeat TTE was done to evaluate his pericardial effusion and this was found to be stable, but his EF was now 30%.
- a repeat echo was performed on [**2135-3-1**], results of which were pending at the time of discharge  # Hypoactive Delirium: During his hospital course the patient was found to less interactive and shuttered.
Head CT showed no acute abnormality.
We performed bone marrow biopsy and found that you had acute leukemia.
