After a non-diagnostic liver biopsy during a previous admission, she ultimately decided to pursue palliative care and eschew further efforts at biopsy to obtain a diagnosis.
She was given dilt 120 mg PO x1 to treat the a-fib which had increased in rate to 140s.
Lung cancer:    - T3 N0 large cell s/p R pneumonectomy in [**2191-12-20**] 2.
?CAD --> negative MIBI [**2189**] 5.
CXR: Impression: Nonspecific findings are consistent with lymphangitic spread of carcinoma left lung.
PE is a consideration particularly given the risk factor of CA, although although with treatment of COPD the patient returned to her home O2 requirement so CTA chest deferred as alternative Dx more likely.
CHADS 3 so would benefit from anticoagulation but risk of bleeding likely outweighs mortality from metastatic lung CA so coumdain not started.
Lung CA with liver and bone Lesions: These likely represent metastases.
Pt has decided in the past not to pursue further diagnostics given that she had no intentions of undergoing chemotherapy, radiation or surgery except for palliation.
KUB and exam unremarkable.
