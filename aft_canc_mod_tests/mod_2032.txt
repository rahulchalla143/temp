Echo in [**8-20**] with EF 50-55% and in [**9-19**] with EF 20-25%.
In [**11-19**] showed EF 20% and moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade.
He had appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] today and Echo was done showing large pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade.

[**2143-1-4**]: Echocardiogram: EF 10-15%.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
[**2143-1-4**] TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained without contrast enhancement.
CT ABDOMEN FINDINGS: Images of the lower thorax demonstrate a hiatal hernia.
Images of the abdomen demonstrate a dense liver likely secondary to blood transfusions and iron deposition.
Dense lymph nodes are present in the porta hepatis and in the paraaortic regions which were seen on the CT from [**2141-8-15**].
Otherwise, fairly limited evaluation of the abdomen secondary to lack of contrast and large amount of ascites.
Hematocrit trend: [**1-2**] Hct 31.3 [**1-3**] Hct 23.2 [**1-3**] Hct 26.3 [**1-4**] Hct 22.7 [**1-4**] Hct 23.5 [**1-5**] Hct 25.2 [**1-5**] Hct 36.8  Brief Hospital Course: 49 year old male with CLL with cardiomyopathy, EF 10-15% and pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade s/p pericardial drain.
Several hours after the drain was pulled, the patient had a systolic blood pressure that decreased from 90's to 50's.
He was asymptomatic with this blood pressure, was mentating and making urine.
His white count increased from 4.5 to 29 in one day.
His Hematocrit was also noted to have dropped from 31 to 23 and he was tranfused 2 units.
The next day his hematocrit had not increased despite the transfusion and he had an abdominal CT scan that was negative for retroperitoneal bleed.
Hemolysis labs were checked and negative.
Patient likely had decreasing hematocrit because he is transfusion dependent at baseline requiring [**12-17**] transfusion/week also in setting of positive fluid balance by 1-2 liters/day as he was dehydrated on admission.
His Hct increased to 36 and remained stable.
Echo checked post-procedure and no evidence of reaccumulation of effusion.
Rhythm: Sinus tachycardia, monitored on Telemetry.
Started on Vanco and Cefepime when sbp dropped and temp 99F but these were d/c'ed after 2 days when no infectious source found and all cultures without growth.
