Imaging: CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST [**2118-3-20**]: 1.
Pockets of ascites appear to display hyperdense components within it, noted within the left upper quadrant and lower midline abdomen which are suggestive of regions of intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
CT Abdomen [**2118-3-23**]: 1.
# Anemia:  Patient presented with a hematocrit of 16 in the setting of recent chemotherapy and no clear source of acute bleeding.
An abdominal CT was performed and demonstrated ascitic fluid consistent with focal areas of hemorrahage from metastatic disease.
She was transfused a total of four units of blood and had a post-transfusion Hct of 34, suggesting that her initial Hct of 16 was erroneous.
Her Hct remained stable and she was subsequently transferred to the medical floor for further management.
On the floor patient had 1 L of fluid drained from abdominal port for comfort - the next day she had > 15 pt HCT drop (30.4 -> 15.7).
CTA was performed which demonstrated no active source of bleeding from vessels.
However, abdominal port was draining frank blood.
Regardless patient is suffering from intraperitoneal bleeding demonstrated by frank blood (drained from abdominal port).
CTA ruled out treatable vascular source, most likely bleeding is from metastatic peritoneal disease.
Abdominal port is currently draining frank blood (see above), but does provide significant comfort.
Patient was briefly started on antibiotics (Vanc, Ceftrioxone) for possible intrapertineal infection based on PMN 249 ([**2118-3-22**]), however culture returned negative and antibiotics were discontinued.
