Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Upper Endoscopy Colonoscopy Ultrasound-guided liver biopsy .
He looked sufficicently ill that he was intubated, had a R triple lumen placed, and an NG lavage showed 1.2 L of [**Location (un) **] blood return.
His INR was discovered to be 7, Hct 10.2, lactic acid 12.5, creatinine 2.6, INR 7.3. so he received 4 units of NS, 2 units PRBC and one unit of FFP, as well as 5 mg IV vitamin K and 5 mg Sub-q.
He was started on ocreotide and nexium and transferred here for further work-up and management.
He had labs drawn and is getting 2 units of emergency release blood while waiting for his type and screen to be completed.
He is being admitted to the MICU for close monitoring and possible endoscopy.

CXR [**2124-5-28**]: FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube is seen with tip approximately 7 cm above the carina.
Right upper lobe nodule concerning for possible malignancy, and further evaluation with CT recommended.
from [**Hospital1 4086**] -CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: Examination is a little limited by the lack of oral and intravenous contrast.
Upper Endoscopy [**5-29**]: Giant duodenal ulcer, nonbleeding, white base.
Colonoscopy [**6-2**]: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and distal descending colon Mass in the mid-transverse colon (injection, biopsy) Small, yellow, plaque-like lesions on an erythematous base were noted just poximal to the mass.
Transverse Colon biopsy [**6-2**]: A. Colon (transverse), mucosal biopsy: Colonic mucosa with regenerative changes and fragments of fibrinopurulent exudate, consistent with ulceration.
# s/p UGI bleed: Patient with giant duodenal ulcer which was likely cause for severe anemia and Hct of 10 upon arrival at OSH.
EGD showing no active bleeding so blood loss was likely chronic.
Patient's Hct has been stable, is 40 on admission.
Patient's supratherpeutic INR (thought to be [**2-12**] shock liver in setting of sepsis and possible infiltrative disease) also reversed with FFP.
# transverse colon/liver lesions concerning for malignancy: Colonoscopy on [**2124-6-2**] showing 4cm mass in transverse colon suspicious for malignancy.
Given high CEA, normal AFP, and appearance of liver lesions more consistent with metastasis on CT scan, most likely this is GI primary with liver metastasis.
Biopsy of the transverse colon mass from the colonoscopy was inconclusive.
Oncology recommended a biopsy of his liver lesions to obtain a more definitive tissue diagnosis.
Pt had speech/swallow eval on [**5-30**] but if patient with difficulty with current diet, can reeval by video swallow for aspiration .
Abdominal US showed no biliary tree abnormalities.
Plan was for him to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] in oncology for results of his liver biopsy and to discuss the treatment plan for his likely metastatic malignancy.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a low blood count and admitted to the intensive care unit.
You had a CT scan which showed a mass in your colon and also lesions in your liver consistent with cancer.
