TTE ([**6-29**]):  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40%), possibly in part secondary to tachycardia.
RUQ ULTRASOUND ([**6-30**]): 1.
CTA CHEST ([**7-1**]): There is a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion with areas of loculation.
Multiple scattered mediastinal lymph nodes are identified, none of which meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
CT CHEST ([**7-5**]): There has been interval decrease in a small-to-moderate partially loculated right pleural effusion.
From the previously described noncalcified lung nodules only one is clearly detected on this examination located in the right middle lobe (4, 133).
PLEURAL TISSUE Acute, chronic, and granulomatous inflammation with focal necrosis.
Her pleural effusion was tapped and showed an exudative process, likely parapneumonic effusion from previous pneumonia as bronchiectasis was seen on CTA chest.
TTE revealed an EF of 40% with 3+MR, but BNP was unremarkable at 347.
Liver US showed fatty infiltrate and no ascites.
Discussion with patient at this time revealed close TB exposure through deceased brother and positive PPD test within last year without treatment.
Patient returned the day after surgery to the medical floor with a temperature overnight of 104, tachycardia and hypotension.
Three concentrated respiratory sputum samples were negative for acid fast bacilli as of [**2131-7-17**], however, given her exposure and clinical picture, the patient was started on empiric weight bases therapy prior to her discharge from [**Hospital3 **].
She will need to have her eye exam followed while on the tuberculosis medications.
In addition, the patient will need to have her liver function tests followed weekly.
# Pain control:  The patient was in pain secondary to her chest tubes, the last of which was removed yesterday with no evidence of pneumothorax on x-ray.
Her blood cultures have all been negative to date.
All culture data including pleural fluid, blood, and urine was negative.
Sputum was sent for AFB x 3.
HIV Antibody was negative.
CIWA scale was discontinued on [**7-4**].
# Acute systolic CHF:  ECHO showed EF of 40%, 3+ MR, possibly [**3-17**] to ETOH cardiomyopathy.
CTA chest showed no PE.
# Acute Renal Failure:  The patient had a rise in her creatinine (peak 1.8) on [**7-11**]/3008 when she had episode of hypotension and was sent back to the MICU.
Her labs demonstrated a combination of pre-renal and ischemic ATN at that time.
Please continue to follow her renal function at least weekly to ensure her creatinine continues to improve.
# Thrombocytosis: Since admission, the patient's platelet count rose significantly peaking in high 900,000 range and rose rapidly around time of VATS surgery.
Her iron studies appear consistent with anemia of chronic disease/inflammation.
She will need f/u CT scan in 3 months for f/u.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed.
Pulmonary nodules were seen on your CT scan on [**2131-7-1**] so we recommend that you have a repeat CT scan in 3 months from that date to follow-up.
