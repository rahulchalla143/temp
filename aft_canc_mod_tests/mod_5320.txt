Wisdom teeth extraction x 2 ([**1-10**])  Social History: She notes exposure to a number of chemicals including organic solvents and possibly benzene.
Microbiology: [**1-25**], [**2-1**], [**2-7**] Urine clx: < 10,000 organisms.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-2-26**], a pericardial effusion with evidence of cardiac tamponade are now present.
[**2-28**] CT Torso: 1.
Three-month followup CT is recommended to assess stability.
[**2-28**] Pleural fluid cytology: negative for malignant cells.
[**2-28**] TTE: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-2-27**], the pericardial effusion appears smaller.
Further evaluation with gadolinium enhanced MRI is recommended.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-2-28**], the pericardial effusion appears smaller and the pleural effusion is not seen.
MRI of the brain [**Name13 (STitle) 4059**] areas of cortical infarction, primarily involving the frontal and parietal lobes, which are in a watershed distribution.
MR venography reveals normal flow in the major intracranial veins.
[**3-6**] TTE: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Compared to the previous study of [**2194-3-3**], the EF may be marginally less.
The background showed a persistent low voltage somewhat regular background with some episodes of generalized slowing.
Routine sampling showed an encephalopathic slow low voltage background persisting through the first many hours of the recording but a much lower voltage background after that, including most of that from [**3-10**].
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 66174**] is a 48 yo woman with M5 AML, s/p induction and consolidation who was admitted for an allogeneic SCT from her brother (recipient and donor CMV negative, A positive) with cytoxan and TBI conditioning.
Initially this was thought to potentially be due to her recent c. difficile infection ([**2-1**]) although a repeat c. difficile test was negative and she had been treated with flagyl.
As she recovered her white blood cells and remained afebrile, antibiotics were gradually stopped and she remained afebrile.
An ultrasound showed a heterogenous fatty liver but no signs of VOD.
Hepatitis serologies were negative.
Her liver enzymes gradually trended down and were stable for several days prior to her planned discharge.
CXR revealed minimal opacities in the BL bases.
Beside TTE revealed preserved systolic function.
ABG was 7.44/37/64 on a questionable amt of O2.
She was placed on AC with TV 450 and 90%FIO2 with ABG of 7.34/37/66.
Her Na dropped from 137 to 126 and her Cr increased from 0.7 to 1.5 within 6 hrs.
Repeat ABG later in the night was 7.06/46/89.
GIven BP of 76/57 maxed out on both levophed and neo, vasopressin was started.
MICU course: Her MICU course was quite complicated and included hypotension requiring up to three pressor agents at one point, renal failure that required one session of hemodialysis, elevated LFTS, question of TTP that required one session of plasmapheresis, multiple small cortical infarcts noted on her head CT/MRI, and questionable seizure activity that required both phenytoin and phenobarbital to control.
With supportive care she eventually stabilized, including stabilization of her blood pressure, resolution of her renal and hepatic failure, and pancreatitis.
She was extubated on [**2193-3-11**] and her O2 sat was stable on room air thereafter.
The patient's blood counts remained stable and she did well from a transplant standpoint.
She remained afebrile and her cultures remained negative, so she was kept only on prophylactic acyclovir, bactrim, and fluconazole.
