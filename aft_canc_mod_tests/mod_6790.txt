Upon arrival to the floor, her CXR showed multifocal PNA, renal failure of unknown chronicity.
She arrives to medicine for management of her multiple medical issues, namely treatment for her multifocal pneumonia, pre-operative evaluation of her cardiac risk factors and management of her chronic medical issues.
She acutely converted into atrial fibrillation with a rate into the 130s-140s about 1500.
Her BP was initially low with MAPs 50-52, but as her rate slowed to the 120s her MAPs increased into the mid-50s.
Since she did not convert to sinus rhythm after 1 hour of amio infusion, she was electrically cardioverted to sinus rhythm after her HCP consented to DC cardioversion.

EKG: Sinus bradycardia (rate 54) with a prolonged PR interval- first degree AV block.
IMAGING: [**2143-8-25**] AP pelvis/R Hip AP/Lat - Right femoral neck fracture .
[**2143-8-25**] CT C-spine 1.
[**2143-8-25**] CXR FINDINGS: There is bilateral lower lobe opacities with obscuration of bilateral hemidiaphragms likely representing infectious infiltrates.
Compared to the study from earlier the same day the right lower lobe infiltrate is slightly worse than the left lower lobe infiltrate, is slightly improved.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Her continued hypotension and elevated jugular venous pressure caused concern for pulmonary embolus.
# Pneumonia - Patient was diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia on admission to the hospital based on CXR findings.
At that time, her blood pressures transiently stabilized, but she continued to be hypotensive while in sinus rhythm.
Muddy brown casts were seen with urine microscopy.
# Pump - Patient with TTE that showed LVEF > 55% and PCWP >18, [**2-1**]+ MR, Severe AS (valve area 0.8-1.0) but poor output with lasix after episodes of hypotension.
The patient was likely slightly volume overloaded with increased JVP but her blood pressures would not tolerate lasix and her kidneys stopped responding.
# Anemia - She was anemic throughout admission, but her hematocrit was stable and most likely related to anemia of chronic disease.
