In the ED - VS Temp 97.8F, HR 100, BP 85/53, R 18, O2-sat 100.
Hct 20 (baseline 28), with Guaiac + brown stool.
The pt was started on PRBCs for transfusion, but he developed chest pain and diaphoresis, so the transfusions were stopped for concern for a transfusion reaction.
Per the blood bank there was no evidence of a transfusion reaction.
Upon transfer to the floor, the pt triggered for HR 130s and RR >30.
At 1230 am pt noted by nursing to have BP 50's/30's on automatic cuff, mentating well, asymptomatic.
Of note he had been given lasix 20mg IV x1 at 8pm when he was noted to be tachypnic to 30's, O2 sat 93-94% on 3-4L, diffuse crackles and expiratory wheezing with chest xray per the radiology resident showing worsened pulmonary edema compared with admission.
He responded well to lasix with resolution of respiratory distress and put out 600+ ml of urine with blood pressures 110-120.
At 12:30 he was noted to be hypotensive as above on bp check.
Recheck with manual cuff with blood pressure of 70's/40's, HR 70-73, RR 18, 97% on 2L NC.
He was given 500ml NS with improvement of SBP to 76.
After observing for 30-40 minutes blood pressure remained in the low 70's systolic so he was given an additional 250ml NS.
EKG showed improvement in precordial ST segment depressions compared with admission.

The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with infero-lateral hypokinesis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 95893**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with PMH of severe CAD s/p multiple prior PCI, moderate aortic stenosis, daily angina, anemia due to chronic GI blood loss admitted with NSTEMI and hematocrit of 21. .
His hematocrit was noted to be 21 which was the likely causing factor of his worsening symptoms.
He did not have any additional melena and his hematocrit remained generally stable, at 34 on the day of discharge.
During the initial night his blood pressure dropped to a systolic in 70's likely due to multiple etiologies including cardiac ischemia, gastrointestinal bleeding and antihypertensive medications.
In addition he received lasix prior to the episode for dyspnea and worsening pulmonary edema seen on CXR following transfusion.
He was given gently IV fluids and his blood transfusion were continued to total of 4 units.
4) Acute on Chronic Systolic heart failure- mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis and inferior septal/inferior lateral [**Last Name (LF) 95894**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 40%.
He had repeat echocardiogram which did not show any significant changes.
5) AF with RVR - he remained in sinus rhythm during the majority of his hospital stay but did have period of afib with RVR with HR 110s while he was in the ICU.
There was no growth on urine culture however he was treated with bactrim for 3 day course given that he had pyuria and bladder spasm.

You were found to have a low blood count of 21 which was likely the cause of your worsened chest pain.
You will likely continue to require occasional blood transfusions to treat the blood loss becausing having a low blood count will cause you to have more chest pain.
