CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2108-12-29**] 5:05 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-27**] and 19: Over the past two days, there has been a slight increase in background radiodensity of the lungs.
The esophageal ulcerations could be secondary to the prednisone use.
Her hematocrit remained stable throughout.
History of Deep vein thrombosis, possible pulmonary embolism:  She was persistently tachycardic, and had lower extremity ultrasounds that showed evidence of an old DVT.
Per discussions with her oncologist, and work up here, this was found to be metastatic to liver and lung.
She continued XRT while here in the hospital for palliation of her bladder tumor, and will continue this as long as she is able to tolerate it.
Her abdominal ultrasound showed no kidney on the left, consistent with her prior nephrectomy, and no hydronephrosis on the right.
She was hydrated, and continued to have a creatinine of over 2 which is her baseline.
Urinary tract infection:  Her initial UA showed many white cells, but culture showed gram positive rods.
She was treated with ciprofloxacin for 5 days, although the culture was never speciated due to technical reasons.
