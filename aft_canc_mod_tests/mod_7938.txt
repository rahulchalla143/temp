He was found in the ED to have a GI bleed, which was thought to be secondary to NSAID use for the flank pain.
He had a CT scan that demonstrated moderate to severe central stenosis at L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1 and mottled appearance of bone, worrisome for MM vs. mets vs. osteopenia.
CT head (negative per ED resident).

VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO VIRUS ISOLATED.
CT head [**3-21**] No definite acute intracranial process.
CT torso [**3-21**] 1.
ECHO [**3-22**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Femur AP and lateral 1) High suspicion for a new femoral neck fracture, new since [**2117-3-21**] torso CT.
This is new compared with a torso CT obtained on [**2117-3-21**].
MRI head without contrast Motion limited study.
routine EEG [**3-30**] This is an abnormal EEG because of mild to moderate diffuse background slowing and focal epileptiform discharges in the right temporal region.
CT head without contrast [**4-6**] No CT evidence for acute intracranial process, though MR would be more sensitive for acute infact, particularly given the extensive background abnormality.
CXR [**4-6**] As compared to the previous radiograph, the esophageal catheter has been removed.
ECHO [**4-7**] The left atrium is elongated.
No atrial septal defect (ASD) or patent foramen ovale (PFO) is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
No ASD or PFO seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
CXR [**4-8**] Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is new, and basal opacification is first attributable to dependent edema before considering concurrent pneumonia.
24 hour EEG [**4-9**] This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.

He started treatment for his multiple myeloma with good response in his SPEP and IgG Kappa labs and ultimately decided to undergo surgery to stabilize his femur fracture on [**4-21**] which was complicated only by some mild post-operative anemia requiring 4 units of pRBCs over 3 days.
At discharge, his HCT was stable.
Calcitonin was discontinued and calcium remained within normal range up to discharge.
CT head without acute intracranial process, only skull lytic lesions.
MRI also did not show acute process and LP did not show signs of infection.
CT head without contrast did not show evidence of bleed.
24 hr EEG did not show any epileptiform featurs or electrographic seizures, however per neuro the decision was made to continue to treat with keppra 750 mg by mouth [**Hospital1 **].
IgG Kappa and SPEP showed good response to chemotherapy.
Creatinine on presentation in the 3.7 range with response to hydration.
Creatinine returned to baseline and remained stable through duration of admission.
started vanc and zosyn for concern of possible aspiration pneumonia however CXR concerning for volume overload.
Had RUE ultrasound which showed clot around the midline in left cephalic vein which may have caused fever.
Cardiac biomarkers elevated slightly in the setting of renal insufficiency with flat CK-MB.
EKG reassuring on admission.
He had good oxygen saturations on room air at time of discharge from the ICU.
