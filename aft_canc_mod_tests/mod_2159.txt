Upon review of [**Hospital1 **] records it appears pt was treated for CHF exacerbation, an Echo was performed which showed significant pulmonary HTN in the 90s, preserved EF and moderate sized effusion in the posterior aspect, small anterior pericardial effusion.
During her admission she was also noted to be anemic with a Hct of 25 from a previously established Hct of 32 and was transfused 2u PRBCs.
Following her Echo findings of an effusion as well as pulmonary HTN pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for right cardiac catheterization and evaluation for possible pericardial effusion.
Has 6 children and 17 grandchildren  Physical Exam: VS: T=97.8, BP=141/64, HR=90, RR=22, O2 sat=93-96% on 3l GENERAL: Obses Caucasian Elderly Female in tripod position tachypneic on 3 l NC saturating well.
HEENT: EOMI, MMM NECK: JVP significantly elevated CARDIAC: S1, S2, ?pericardial rub, tachycardic to 110 irregularly, irregular.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-3-2**], the pericardial effusion is larger.
[**5-1**]/ECHO Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-4-30**], the pericardial effusion is now larger and echo dense suggestive of thrombus/clot.
Clinical correlation and serial evaluation is suggested.

On day of transfer pt was noted to have SOB with a rate in the 140s after which she received IV Metoprolol 5mg Tartrate with response of heart rate within 100-120.
Pt was changed to Metoprolol 100mg Taretrate TID, a heart rate of 100-120 was tolerated given the presence of hypoxia, pulmonary HTN, pericardial effusion.
Pt underwent pericardiocentesis that was noted to show 800cc serosanguinous fluid.
Analysis of fluid showed WBC 1000 but negative on fluid culture, anaerobic culture, AFB smear.
Gram stain also nowed no microorganisms and 2+ Polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
Cytology was also negative, an autoimmune panel of [**Doctor First Name **], double stranded DNA were still pending at time of discharge but unlikely to be positive given her lack of symptoms in the past.
Re-examination with repeat Echos showed no changes thus indicating no unstable bleed into the pericardium.
Suspect that the collection has always been present but hidden from prior Echos because of the pericardial fluid superimposed around it.
- Recommend pt undergo repeat Echo in 1 week to again reassess pericardium, specifically possibility of constrictive pericarditis.
Alprazolam was discontinued due it's increased risk of Delirium.
Her reason for transfer was due to her noted pulmonary pressures in the 90s-100s on Echo, right heart cath was performed to determine whether etiology is cardiac versus Pulmonary.
Her right heart cath pressures are notable for a high mean pressure, higher PA diastolic pressure when compared to the wedge (which is elevated by itself).
From her right heart cath results it is likely that there is a cardiac component superimposed on a pulmonary one given the elevated Wedge with an even greater PA diastolic pressure.
Her diastolic dysfunction and fluid overload state are likely the acute causes of her pulmonary HTN.
Unfortunately further studies such as PFTs, high-res Chest CT are not helpful given her current hypervolemic status.
Her WBC has been trending up during this hospitalization from 21.8->24.7->23.1->28.4->22.5->22.5->21.8.
