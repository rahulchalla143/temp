Work-up revealed CT findings concerning for CAP and a small-moderated pericardial effusion thought to be malignant.
During blood draw he became pale, diaphoretic and had brief LOC without evidence of seizure.
CT chest revealed new epicardial mets and multiple pulmonary nodules.
Bedside ECHO showing effusion, no tamponade.
Hct dropped with hydration and he was transfused 1u PRBC for concern of unstable blood volume.

Seizure disorder, diagnosed in [**2112**], last seizure in [**2128**].
He finally  sought evaluation in [**1-/2138**], at the office of his primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] that time, an MRI of the spine was performed on [**2138-1-10**].
This study demonstrated postsurgical changes at L4-L5 with a small right recurrent disc protrusion.
Given the findings of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy on his MRI, he was sent to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for evaluation in the [**Hospital 3242**] clinic.
His inpatient evaluation included a urine cytology analysis, which demonstrated atypical urothelial cells.
In addition, he underwent a CT scan of the torso on [**2138-1-21**], which demonstrated a right upper pole renal mass, xtending to the renal hilum and through the retroperitoneal space posteriorly (6.1 x 6.9 x 8.9 cm).
On [**2138-1-22**], a core biopsy of the patient's acetabular mass was obtained demonstrating carcinoma, consistent with renal origin.
An MRI of the abdomen was performed on [**2138-1-25**], which demonstrated a large heterogeneously enhancing mass within the right kidney.
Imaging characteristics were suggestive of a clear cell subtype.

For confirmation, or evaluation of possible involvement of the underlying myocardium, cardiac MRI can be performed, if warranted clinically.
CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST  [**2138-2-10**] 5:35 PM No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease or acute process.
Enhanced MRI would be more sensitive.
TTE (Focused views) Done [**2138-2-10**] at 9:22:59 PM The left atrium is elongated.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2138-2-11**] at 10:10:00 AM Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-2-10**], the findings are similar.
Has h/o of similar events with blood draws.
Monitored on telemetry without event.
# Hypoxia - Concern for CAP as seen on CT on last admission.
Improved on repeat CT chest.
