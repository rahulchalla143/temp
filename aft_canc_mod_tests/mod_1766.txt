Interval imaging showed decrease in abscess size in [**Month (only) 404**]; her last imaging was a CT scan on [**2123-1-18**] and showed no change in abscess size since [**Month (only) 404**] and showed intrahepatic biliary dilatation, as well as ill-defined opacity in caudate lobe worrisome for tumor recurrence.
On day prior to admission, she was noted to have temperature on VNA assessment of 100.0 and was noted to have WBC count of 2.5 on lab draw.
EGD on [**2122-4-10**] demonstrated normal esophagus without esophageal or gastric varices.

CT [**2123-1-18**]: 1.
Ill-defined low-attenuating area in caudate lobe concerning for tumor recurrence as suspected on prior CT, is better depicted on multiphasic study of [**2122-11-16**].
An area of contrast extravasation at the right posterior intrahepatic duct apparently corresponds to a prior drain site seen on a previous CT examination.
Blood cultures [**Date range (1) 28561**] positive for  PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA.
Cefepime & CEFTAZIDIME sensitivity testing confirmed by Microscan.
ECHO [**2-4**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
CT abd/pelvis [**2-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 58 year female with history of PBC complicated by cirrhosis, HCC s/p surgical resection, HCC recurrence s/p TACE complicated by biliary ischemia and hepatic abscesses s/p surgical drain placement and IV abx who presented with somnolence as well as fevers and was found to be hyponatremic with recurrent hepatic abscesses and blood cultures positive for MDR Pseudomonas.
MDR Pseudomonas bacteremia, hepatic abscesses: The patient's blood cultures were positive for MDR Pseudomonas from [**Date range (1) 28561**] likely secondary to recurrent hepatic abscesses which were discovered on a CT scan.
A TTE was negative for any vegetations.
A new double lumen power PICC was placed on [**2-9**] after the patient had been blood culture negative and afebrile for several days.
HCC: A CT abdomen/pelvis performed on [**2-7**] demonstrated progression of her known HCC as well as recurrent hepatic abscesses with no significant ascites.
Her MELD score was 22 on discharge, but the patient is not a transplant candidate.
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
You were found to have recurrent liver abscesses and your blood was infected with an antibiotic resistant bacteria called Pseudomonas.
