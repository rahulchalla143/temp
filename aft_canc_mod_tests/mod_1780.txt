When she was found on echo to have precipitous decline in her EF to 10% (from 20% in [**6-/2130**]) she was referred to the ED.
She underwent PE protocol CT to evaluate for possible PE in the setting of recent plane travel and complaints of asymmetric lower extremity edema.
The CT was negative for PE.
Remainder of review of systems is remarkable for persistent cough productive of whitish sputum.

CTA PE Protocol ([**2131-1-1**]): 1.
CXR ([**2131-1-1**]): Preliminary read, interval increase in size of cardiac silhouette, which could be partially secondary to techinical differences, however, possible pericardial effusion versus worsening cardiomyopathy cannot be excluded.
TTE ([**2131-1-1**]): Estimated EF 10%.
Her most recent echo revealed an EF of 10%, and her symptoms were thought to be due to volume overload.
CTA of the lungs was performed on admission and was negative for PE.
