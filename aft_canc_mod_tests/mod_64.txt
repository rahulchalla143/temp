Excisional biopsy demonstrated infiltrating and intraductal carcinoma which was greater than 2 cm and she subsequently went for a right modified mastectomy and axillary dissection.
Family History: sister died of breast ca, 56  Physical Exam: vitals- 98.3, 162/94,76, 18, 97% RA gen- NAd heent- EOMI.
no associated dermatomal rash  Pertinent Results: CXR [**2125-4-29**]: PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is an opacity within the left lung base with associated volume loss consistent with atelectasis/consolidation.
TTE [**2125-4-30**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
CT T-SPINE [**2125-5-2**]: CT scan of the thoracic spine which was obtained on [**2124-5-26**], and employed contrast administration intravenously.
The study was reported by myself and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5325**] as revealing "diffusely abnormal appearing vertebral bodies in the thoracic spine as seen on the prior MRI scan consistent with metastatic disease.
Comparison with the prior study of [**2124-5-26**] reveals likely progression of diffuse metastatic disease of the thoracic spine.
These pulmonary lesions were not present on the prior spinal CT scan but were seen, at least in part, on a recent torso CT scan.
It is suggested that these pulmonary issues be reviewed with the chest CT service, and if deemed necessary, a followup chest CT scan be obtained.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-4-30**], the mitral deceleration time is now shorter suggestive of more severe diastolic dysfunction/elevated left atrial pressures.
Rib films revealed multiple chronic and acute rib fractures.
Given persistently poorly controlled pain despite uptitration of narcotics, CT of her T-spine was obtained; this study revealed multiple vertebral compression fractures.
She did well, and was transferred to OMED on [**5-24**], however, became quite anxious, hypertensive and developed recurrent pulmonary edema requiring transfer back to the ICU on [**5-25**]; her respiratory status quickly normalized with diuresis as well as control of her anxiety and blood pressure.
Her INR was supratherapeutic at 3.5 at time of admission on home dose of 4.5 mg qHS.
C Diff was negative x2.
Her blood pressure is well controlled and she is in NSR.
Medications on Admission: Diovan 40mg [**Hospital1 **] Toprol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] Coumadin 4.5 mg qhs Timolol eye drops OD Alphagan OU [**Hospital1 **] Citrocal Percocet 5-10mg q 4-6prn   Discharge Medications: 1.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed.
Outpatient Lab Work INR check every thursday   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Rib fractures Vertebral compression fractures Metastatic breast cancer Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable, tolerating POs.
A stress MIBI test showed normal myocardial perfusion.
