Her OSH labs were significant for Na 119.

INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Portable study precluded photic  stimulation.
MRI Head [**5-19**]:  Limited study which was terminated early without the administration of gadolinium.
MRI Head [**5-20**]: Again an area of encephalomalacia is identified in the right parietotemporal region.
Again encephalomalacia in the right temporoparietal region and brain atrophy are noted as seen on the recent MRI of [**2101-5-19**].
CT Head With and Without Contrast, [**5-22**]: HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Compared with the prior exams, there has been no interval change.
HEAD CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  No enhancing lesions are seen on the contrast-enhanced images.
No change from prior exam on [**2101-5-21**].
CSF Cytology: Negative for malignant cells .
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
If available, comparison with previous radiographs would help to better assess for interval change.
EEG was performed (see results above) and showed R centroparietal theta slowing but no epileptiform discharges.
Head CT was negative for evidence of metastatic lesions or mass.
Her hyponatremia was worked up (see serum and urine lytes above) and was consistent with SIADH.
It was felt that this was most likely [**2-11**] her known lung cancer and improved with fluid restriction (which she should continue after discharge)  She was transferred to the floor in stable condition.
A CT with contrast was therefore performed and showed no evidence of metastatic disease as a possible seizure focus.
This showed no evidence of metastatic disease, 0 WBCs, 0 RBCs, protein 50, glucose 64.
A bone scan was performed (see results above) and did show evidence of bony mets.
