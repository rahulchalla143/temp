The pain subsided, but came back very strong again on [**3-14**] in the early am.
Here, a head CT showed a large R temporal mass with a hypodense center and surrounding vasogenic edema.
An MRI is recommende for further characterization.
[**3-16**] CTA HEAD 1.
Right temporal mass, similar to the recent MRI with marked mass effect and vasogenic edema; the overall appearance is highly suspicious for a high-grade primary glial neoplasm.
[**3-16**] CT Torso 1.
[**3-16**] MRI Brain Rim-enhancing right temporal lobe mass, similar to recent examinations with marked adjacent mass effect including uncal herniation and deviation and deformity of the midbrain.
This examination was limited and done only for preoperative planning.
[**3-18**] CT Head Expected post-surgical changes s/p right temporal resection.
27 x 18 mm (CC x TV) area in the posterior fossa which was present on the prior examination now demonstrates change in signal intensity(hyperintense) likley hemorrhage in an arachnoid cyst.
He underwent an MRI which showed large cystic comparing mass in the right temporal lobe with irregular rim enhancement and mild nodular components appear inferiorly measuring 2.7 x 5.2 cm with significant surrounding vasogenic edema.
He underwent CT of his torso which was negative for any malignancy.
A CTA of his head did not show any vascular abnormalities or potential vessels that could complicate the surgery.
