INR at that time was 4.1. .
Since that time, she has had progressive weakness and fatigue and has undergone extensive outpatient workup including labs, echo, ct of chest, abd, pelvis to assess the concerns of recurrent melenoma.
Labs have demonstrated a decline of hct from 41 on [**1-13**] to 34 on [**1-28**], to 28 today.
Repeat screening colonoscopy [**2165-8-21**] showed a hyperplastic polyp.

[**2166-1-28**] CT chest, abd, pelvis: At least three tiny noncalcified pulmonary nodules within the right middle lobe.
Given the patient's history of melanoma, a three-month follow-up examination is recommended to insure stability.
[**2-5**]: Pelvic CT wet read:no discrete retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF> 55%).
There was great concern for bleed with elevated INR, but CT showed no evidence of RP bleed.
Lab tests did not show any indication of mircoangiopatic hemolytic anemia on peripheral smear, nor was there any evidence of DIC.
Hematocrit remained fairly stable, however, the elavated LDH and concurrent lactic acidosis was thought to be secondary to the rapid cell turnover.
Bone marrow biopsy showed 2+ PMNs on the gram stain, but no orgs.
Thrombocytopenia/left shift: Platelet count low with concerning etiology of infection vs. malignancy.
INR elevation: Baselin INR 4.
INR peaked in the hospital at 41.
Urine ketones, serum acitone negative.
Serum ASA negative.
CT showed increase size in pleural effusions, subcutaneous edema, free abdominal fluid and a new pericardial effusion that was not seen on [**1-31**].
There was Concern for malignancy though no mass noted on CT scans.
