On [**2158-6-17**], she was still on TPN at rehab and spiked a temperature up to 103 and blood cultures were positive for yeast ([**Female First Name (un) **] albicans by telephone report but not documented in transfer records).
She was transferred to [**Hospital3 417**] in [**Hospital1 1474**] for further management.
An echo done on [**2158-6-18**] showed global hypokinesis with EF 25-30%, dilated LA, LVH, moderated MR, moderate TR, although image quality was poor.
Upon admission to [**Hospital3 417**] her Cr was 3.7 and remained elevated.

## Fungemia: Patient was diagnosed with fungemia by blood culture at [**Hospital1 **] and [**Hospital3 417**], likely due to TPN.
TTE on [**2158-6-23**] demonstrated no evidence of vegetations.
Ophthalmology eval demonstrated no opthalmic candidemia.
Another possible source was pulmonary since patient's CT chest from [**2158-7-6**] demonstrated interval development of bilateral pulmonary nodules.
Nodules may have represented septic emboli from endocarditis, although no vegetations were demonstrated by echo on [**2158-6-23**] or [**2158-7-11**].
Blood cultures from [**7-23**] had come back positive for yeast and per ID was switched to caspofungin.
Further workup was done to search for the source of the fungemia.
A renal ultrasound was done which was normal.
A TTE was done which showed a small (0.7 x0.7 cm) mass attached to the highly calcified mitral annulus which may be a vegetation or a mobile piece of calcification coming off the larger mitral annular calcification.
A follow up TEE was recommended, however the patient began to have increased emesis and it was unable to be performed.
Cultures from [**Date range (1) 21081**] remained negative and a urine culture from this time was negative as well.
Renal u/s [**2158-6-23**] showed stable borderline hydronephrosis in the transplant kidney with elevated resistive indices and CT ab/pelvis [**2158-6-23**] showed air within the transplant kidney collecting systems, new from comparison, likely iatrogenic from foley placement.
The patient's creatinine fell to a low of 1.9 while on the floor.
The renal service was closely following the patient and recommended placement of an HD catheter in preparation for hemodialysis based on her worsening renal function and fluid status.
Tacrolimus levels were followed with a goal trough [**2-26**].
Patient was started on cefepime and vancomycin initially for concern of gram negatives and MRSA, which was noted on OSH blood culture.
Vancomycin was then discontinued given negative blood cultures and concern for vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia.
However, a CT scan of chest demonstrated interval development of pleural effusions and bilateral pulmonary nodules, concerning for an infectious process.
A CXR was done which showed worsening pulmonary edema however the patient had good oxygen saturation The patient's mental status did not impro .
A bone scan was negative for metastatic osseous disease.
TSH and PTH were within normal limits.
Per renal, further calcitonin was held as the patient did not respond adequately to it and they did not recommend pamidronate as it can contribute to renal failure.
PTHrp was sent and was normal.
The patient's sodium remained stable while on the floor.
HCT was trending down and guiac was positive, and patient received 1unit pRBC.
## UTI: During admission, patient's urine culture began growing vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.
She again grew out many bacteria on a urine culture and was treated with ciprofloxacin and fluconazole (last day of cipro [**2158-9-23**], last day of fluconazole [**2158-9-18**]) .
## HTN: Patient's blood pressures have been occasionally elevated and hydralazine was increased to 15mg PO qid to assess for improved BP control.
As she was not felt to clearly be septic and didn't seem to briskly respond to stress dose steroids, she had an echo performed, showing an EF of 25%, down from an echo one month prior showing 35-45%.
Cardiology was consulted who felt that this was not acute ischemia, and that the decrement in function was likely overstated; it was felt that her prior study had been of sub-optimal quality and that probably had not been a significant interval change in LV-EF, and that this low EF was probably a mix of a baseline ischemic cardiomyopathy with a superimposed toxic/infectious cardiomyopathy.
At the time, her hr was in the 140's to 160's and a bp was not able to be obtained, though she did not lose conciousness.
She received 20mg of diltiazem IV with heart rate decreasing to the 90's to low 100's and bp up to the 120's.
MRI was unrevealing, Ca under control, head CT negative x2.
INR goal is 2.0-3.0.
