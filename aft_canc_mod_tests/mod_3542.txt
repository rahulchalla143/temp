[**2168-7-7**] 03:40AM BLOOD ESR-7 [**2168-7-7**] 03:40AM BLOOD CRP-0.5  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 25 year old woman who presented with abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea which resolved and was replaced with tachypnea, dyspnea and hypoxia.
A CTA performed in the ED excluded the possibility of a PE.
An ESR of 7 and a CRP of 0.5 made active autoimmune disease unlikely.
Her CXR and CTA showed evidence of moderate pulmonary edema.
Original abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea most likely represents viral gastroenteritis.
