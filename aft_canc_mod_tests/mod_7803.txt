HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old gravida II, para II-0-0-II, who presented to the Emergency Room with complaints of constipation, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia for the last two weeks.
The workup in the Emergency Room included a CT which showed bilateral pleural effusions, a large multiloculated mass filling the entire cul-de-sac measuring 15.8 cm in greatest dimension, extending out of the pelvis above the umbilicus towards the liver.
Because of the patient's GI complaints, she was admitted and placed on bowel rest with the diagnosis of a partial small bowel obstruction.
Her initial laboratory results revealed a white blood cell count of 27.8 with 89% neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes.
Her initial PT was 14.4 with an INR of 1.4.
Her sodium was 133.
Her liver function tests were within normal limits.
Her amylase and lipase were also within normal limits.
The patient was admitted for further evaluation of her pelvic mass, GI symptoms, and fever.
Her electrolytes were checked on a daily basis and were repleted as needed.
We continued to check her electrolytes on a daily basis and replete them through her TPN.
HEMATOLOGIC:  A lower extremity Doppler was performed on the patient on hospital day number two after suspicion for DVT was raised on the initial CT of the pelvis.
A CTA showed probably not clinically significant emboli.
The patient had her coagulation panel and CBC checked daily.
In addition, preoperatively, the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells given that her preoperative hematocrit was 25.
Postoperatively, the patient's hematocrit was stable in the low 30s.
A low-molecular weight serum level was drawn and was found to be subtherapeutic.
Her CA-125 returned at 475 and her CA19.9 was 14 (within normal limits).
The patient's urine output was adequate and her Foley was discontinued on postoperative day number two.
The rest of her vital signs were stable.
The final pathology from the surgery revealed a poorly differentiated papillary serous carcinoma arising from the ovary.
From a pain control standpoint, the patient was continued on Dilaudid PCA until postoperative day number seven.
Her blood cultures have been negative to date.
The triple lumen catheter that was placed intraoperatively was pulled and the tip was sent for culture.
The urine culture was positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.
All of her cultures at that time were negative for any organisms.
She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 150**] from Hematology/Oncology on [**2179-4-8**] at 2:00 p.m.  She will start her Lovenox with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 150**] who will also follow her serum levels to achieve therapeutic levels.
