He defervesced and blood pressure improved quickly on this regimen, however no source could be identified.
He had a sigmoidoscopy on hospital day number seven demonstrating radiation proctitis secondary to radiation therapy for bladder cancer.
Surgery was consulted on hospital day number 10, rectal tube placed, and CT revealed a stricture at rectosigmoid junction with transition point and cecum dilated to 11 cm.
Trans thoracic echo showed small pericardial effusion and TSH was WNL.
He remained in NSR (with the exception of PVCs and a short run of non-sustained VT on postoperative day number 8) as documented by EKG and telemetry for the remainder of the admission.
An ultrasound showed gallbladder wall edema and sludge and a CT scan demonstrated gall bladder distension.
A HIDA scan performed the following day was equivocal.
CT scan from [**2132-12-5**] demonstrated interval decompression of the gall bladder.
Additionally, while the patient improved clinically quite rapidly, his white blood cell count continued to increase until [**12-8**],  peaking at 25.8 before decreasing to 11.8 at the time of discharge.
A T-tube cholangiogram on [**2132-11-9**] (postoperative day number 26) demonstrated drainage from the gallbladder and [**Date Range **] ducts into the duodenum.
6) Acute renal failure: On [**2132-11-26**], postoperative day number 13, the patient's creatinine peaked at 1.5 from a baseline of approximately 1 and his potassium increased to 5.4.
However, given rapid improvement following adequate fluid resuscitation, high BUN/Cr ratio, moderate hypotension, a fractional excretion of sodium equal to 0.7%, and the fact that the ARF coincided with the patient's increasing negative fluid balance, it was concluded that the patient's ARF was secondary to dehydration.
At discharge creatinine was 1.2.
On [**2132-12-15**] (postoperative day number 32) output decreased to 2 liters and on the day of discharge output decreased to 1.3 L for 24 hours.
