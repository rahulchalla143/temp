Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2117-11-22**].
Current study demonstrates interval development of bilateral perihilar interstitial process consistent with pulmonary edema.
TTE [**12-9**] Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-12-3**], the current study has better image quality and is more complete.
Left ventricular systolic function is probably slightly better.
The right ventricle appears mildly hypokinetic on the current study (RV not well seen on prior).
CXR [**12-11**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC line is in unchanged position, but the left internal jugular vein catheter has been removed.
Regarding IL-2, treatment was stopped on [**2116-11-26**] due to lethargy and fatigue.
She was initially placed on dopamine that improved her pressures, however due to increasing ectopy Neo was added to try and decrease her dopamine.
Infectious work-up was unrevealing and antibiotics discontinued.
An echo was ordered, which was without sign of pericardial effusion.
She was bolused with gentle 500cc, and her hypotension resolved.
Blood cultures were sent given continued hypotension, and were pending at the time of discharge.
On arrival patient noted to be hypotensive and hypoxic - sterile femoral line was placed and patient was intubated and started on phenylephrine.
Her post arrest echo showed global left ventricular systolic function which was more depressed with similar regional distribution.
She was monitored on telemetry without events.
TTE on [**12-3**] demonstrated depressed systolic function.
Repeat TTE on [**2117-12-9**] showed slightly improved function.
She will need to follow-up with Cardiology, and have repeat TTE in ~1month to assess for improvement of systolic heart failure.
Her creatinine steadily improved, and was 1.1 on discharge.
INR 1.4.
# Anemia: Hct 28.9 on admission.
Iron studies showed elevated ferritin and low TIBC, suggestive of ACD.
Her hematocrit remained stable.
On discharge, she was instructed to have labs in the next 1-2 days to ensure hematocrit was not falling.
# UTI: Urine culture from [**2117-12-12**] grew Klebsiella.
A repeat Urine culture from [**2117-12-13**] was preliminarily read as gm negative rods, with final culture pending at the time of discharge.
