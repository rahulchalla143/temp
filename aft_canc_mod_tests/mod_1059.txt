Creatinine upon discharge was 2.2 up from 1.8 - etiology of increase not well understood but postulated secondary to previous nephrotoxin.
Yesterday, [**Hospital1 **] labs notable for worsening renal function and vitals signs with new hypotension with SBPs in to 80s so decision was made to transfer to the ED for further eval and potential initiation of CVVH/HD.
ECG without hyperacute t waves; SR at 94.
NANI, TWi V1-V3, no changes from prior.
CXR with bilateral pleural effusions, stable extensive opacification of right lung with rll collapse, hazy opacity in LLL, ?
Patient received levofloxacin for possible PNA, CTX for UTI and admitted to medicine for further eval of [**Last Name (un) **].
VS prior to transfer 98.5 82 96/61 20 95% 4L  Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**4-/2189**]: presented to an outside hospital with severe back pain, with CXR showing right upper lobe lung mass.
PET scan revealed FDG avidity at the periphery of the mass, with an FDG-avid paratracheal lymph node - [**2189-7-31**] cervical mediastinoscopy, multiple lymph nodes neg for malignancy (report not available).
- [**2189-8-5**] transthoracic biopsy at [**Hospital1 18**], nondiagnostic.
Pt declined RUL lobectomy - [**2189-11-3**] new moderate right-sided pleural effusion; right lung nodule increased from 6.6 to 7.7 cm and was again noted to have broad contact with the chest wall - [**2189-12-2**]: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] again saw the patient and recommended a right thoracotomy and RUL lobectomy.
Surgery was scheduled but was canceled by the patient - [**2190-1-1**] chest CT revealed further increase in the known necrotic RUL lung mass, now measuring 8.1 x 7.5 cm.
- [**2190-2-4**]: A repeat bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound was performed for diagnostic purposes, with a biopsy of the right upper lobe mass revealing poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with immunostains positive for P63 and CK7 (weak), negative for TTF-1.
A transbronchial needle aspiration of station 7, 4R, and R11 lymph nodes revealed no malignant cells.
- [**2190-2-18**]: A repeat PET scan demonstrated no evidence of bony metastatic disease.
[**2190-12-7**] CT torso showing a mildly enlarged cavitating lesion in the right upper lobe, which is now 6.5 x 4.4 cm, increased from 6.3 x 3.7 cm.
[**2191-2-25**]: CT chest without contrast showing slightly enlarged right upper lung mass, measuring 7.5 x 5.2 cm, with slightly enlarged soft tissue component at the right middle lobe bronchus, measuring 3 x 3 cm [**2191-2-22**]: Palliative chemo with taxotere, with doses held due to dehydration and cytopenias.
[**2191-7-14**] CT chest: decreased size in primary mass, measuring 6.5 x 4.1 cm, as compared to 7.4 x 5.2 cm previously.
[**Date range (3) 34677**]: Hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for enterococcus mitral valve endocarditis and T12-L1 diskitis/osteomyelitis.
He had a right internal jugular  and axillary vein thrombosis, associated with his right sided port-a-cath, which was initially diagnosed at [**Hospital3 34678**] on [**2191-7-29**], and has continued on Lovenox for treatment.
He was seen by cardiology for NSVT, mitral valve endocarditis, and was started on metoprolol for rate control.
[**2191-8-2**] CT angio of the chest showed a 4.5 cm x 3 cm thick-walled mixed solid and cystic structure in the right upper lobe corresponding to interval necrosis of treated tumor.
[**2191-8-5**] MRI of the L-spine showed resolution of previously noted diskitis and osteomyelitis at T12 and L1.
[**2191-8-15**] MRI of the brain showed no intraparenchymal findings, but there was a new clivus mass, most likely representing an osseous  metastasis.
-Emphysema/COPD -right internal jugular and axillary vein thrombosis, associated with his right sided port-a-cath   Social History: [**12-27**] ppd x 30 years currently still smoking, social alcohol use, history IV heroin use and cocaine use.

COMPARISON: CTA chest, [**2191-8-2**].
Although not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, the upper abdomen contains a small amount of ascitic fluid which is new.
When clinically appropriate, further evaluation with ultrasound should be performed.
On HD#2 pt had CT chest which showed extensive consolidation of R lung [**1-26**] progression of his known malignancy.
