His son apparently awoke when he heard the screaming and saw the patient shaking, his arms in the decorticate position with blood coming from his nose.
EMS arrived and he was taken to [**Hospital 5583**] [**Hospital 12018**] Hospital where he underwent CT head which showed left frontal edema.
His neuro exam by both the ED physicians and neurology was unremarkable aside from scattered tongue hematomas.
He underwent repeat CT head which showed left frontal edema c/f underlying mets given clinical history with recommendation for MRI.
He denies fevers, chills, night sweats, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, constipation, melena or hematochezia.
CT scan demonstrated a left renal mass.
- [**3-/2102**]:  CT scan demonstrated multiple small pulmonary nodules in the right lower lobe, left upper lobe, right lower lobe.
- [**6-/2102**]:  Subsequent CT scan demonstrated an increase in the size of the pulmonary nodule.
Subsequent CT scans demonstrated slow disease progression.
- [**2105-6-15**] CT showed disease progression - [**7-/2105**] resume sutent - [**2106-8-16**]: sunitinib dose changed from 37.5 to 50 daily (2 weeks on, 1 week off dosing schedule) - [**2106-10-15**] VATS with LUL and LLL wedge resection with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17109**] - [**2106-10-25**] resumed sunitinib 37.5 two weeks on, one week off with some treatment interruption due to wound healing, restarted [**2106-12-20**] - [**2107-12-26**]: CT showed increasing right upper lobe nodule - [**2108-2-23**]: underwent right VATS with RUL wedge resection x3 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; pathology consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, including multiple lymph nodes; resumed sunitinib [**2108-3-19**] - [**2108-10-9**]: re-staging CT scan: Interval increase in size of abnormal soft tissue in the azygoesophageal recess.
- [**2108-12-3**]: re-staging CT scan: Interval decrease in size of soft tissue lesion in the right paraesophageal region.
No new lesions identified  - [**2109-11-26**]: re-staging CT scan: Slight increase in right paraesophageal mass and left lower lobe pulmonary nodules.
- [**2109-6-4**]: re-staging CT scan: Mild interval increase in the right paraesophageal lymph node mass.
No new metastatic lesions detected in the chest, abdomen and pelvis - [**2109-7-29**]: re-staging CT scan: Unchanged size and appearance of left lower lobe pulmonary nodule and right paraesophageal mass.
- [**2109-11-4**]: re-staging CT scan: Interval decrease in size of a necrotic-appearing azygoesophageal nodal conglomerate and left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
- [**2110-2-12**] re-staging CT scan shows disease progression in the chest as well as a new left adrenal lesion.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.

[**2110-3-24**] CT C/A/P: IMPRESSION: 1.
Previously seen intramuscular mass within the right infraspinatus/teres minor muscle is barely visible on today's study which may be due to slight differences in contrast bolus timing.
