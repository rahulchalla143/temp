Workup included a [**2120-1-21**] CAT scan which demonstrated a 2- x 2.6- x 4.4-cm ill-defined enhancing mass in the left rectus concerning for recurrent desmoid which was not noted on a [**2117**] scan.
A subsequent [**2120-4-4**] MRI demonstrated a 1.8- x 2.6- x 5-cm enhancing mass within the left upper anterior abdominal wall of the rectus muscle very likely to represent recurrence in this region.
The patient's initial laboratories were significant for a white blood cell count of 8.4, a hematocrit of 32.3, and platelets of 391.
A sodium of 140, a potassium of 4.3, a BUN of 14, a creatinine of 1.2 - these were obtained on [**2120-6-4**].
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a [**2112**] right abdominal wall desmoid resection and reconstruction by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of the plastic surgery service, a chest wall right desmoid recurrence (status post resection in [**2113-5-12**]), multiple hernia repairs (most recently on [**2120-1-25**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] which also included an abdominoplasty with Marlex and mesh repair by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  The patient's medications include Prozac, hydrocodone, Percocet, and over-the-counter iron 325 mg b.i.d.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  As stated before, her laboratory values were significant for a white blood cell count of 8.4, a hematocrit of 32.3, platelets of 391.
A sodium of 140, a potassium of 4.3, a BUN of 14, a creatinine of 1.2.
STUDIES:  On [**2120-4-4**] a MRI showed a 1.8- x 2.6- x 5-cm enhancing mass within the left upper anterior abdominal wall and rectus muscle.
Her vital signs showed a blood pressure of 138/96, a heart rate of 72, a respiratory rate of 16.
The chest was clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.
Her coronary exam showed a regular rate and rhythm without gallops or murmurs.
HYPOXIC AND APNEIC EVENT OF UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY: As stated    previously upon awaking from anesthesia had a brief apneic    and hypoxic event with oxygen saturations that were    reportedly less than 50%, and the patient required    approximately 10 minutes of bag mask ventilation.
A    postoperative chest x-ray showed no pneumothorax and only    left-sided atelectasis.
On the night of postoperative day    #2, however, the patient was initially noted to be    tachycardic in the early morning hours of [**2120-6-19**];    and then at approximately 2:45 a.m. the patient was noted    to become unresponsive with oxygen saturations in the 60s,    bradycardic, with a palpable pulse.
Arterial blood gas    was rather unremarkable with a pH of 7.38, carbon dioxide    of 49, oxygen of 74, bicarbonate of 30, and a base excess    of 2.
Lactate was 0.7.
An aggressive workup was    undertaken; including a CTA of the chest to rule out a    pulmonary embolus.
In    addition, a head CT was obtained.
On their    recommendation an additional MRI/MRA of the brain was    obtained, and this study also showed no evidence of    intracranial hemorrhage or acute territorial infarction.
The patient had at least 1 set of    negative cardiac enzymes as well as EKGs that were not    consistent with ischemia; and thus, the tachycardia was    deemed not to be significant and resolved on its own.
The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]    in 2 weeks; to call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 110151**] for an appointment.
