His VS on presentation to the ED were T 99.6, HR 68, BP 106/56, RR 25, O2sat 97% RA.
His K was 6.0, so he was given Kayexalate 30g.
He was also noted to be somewhat dyspneic with an elevated D-dimer so he was sent for a V/Q scan to rule out a PE.
His VS upon return were HR 110, BP 144/65, O2sat 89% NRB.
CXR showed clear lungs.
He had 2 sets of blood cultures sent (though it's unclear if he was ever febrile) and grew gram(+) cocci in pairs/clusters from 3/4 bottles; he was started on vancomycin.
His sputum culture also had 4+ gram(+) cocci in pairs/chains.
He initially responded well to Decadron and was then intolerant to thalidomide/Decadron; he subsequently responded well to Cytoxan/Decadron with a marked decrease in his kappa excretion and improvement inhis renal function.
A bone marrow biopsy showed >60% plasma cells.
Was in remission with Zometa qo month until [**8-18**] when he had a marrow biopsy showing relapse.
Baseline creatinine 1.9-2.0.
Paroxysmal AFib- on Coumadin and rate-controlled 6.

He had 2 sets of blood cultures sent (though it's unclear if he was ever febrile) and grew gram(+) cocci in pairs/clusters from 3/4 bottles; he was started on vancomycin.
His sputum culture also had 4+ gram(+) cocci in pairs/chains.
## ID: - [**1-24**] blood culture bottles from admission grew vanc-sensitive coag negative Staph; he completed a 10-day course of IV vancomycin and remained afebrile - sputum culture grew non-Pseudomonas gram negative rods (CXR normal); completed course of levofloxacin - ceftriaxone was added for 3 days ([**Date range (1) 18881**]) due to concern for meningitis with his second change in mental status (see below) and was stopped once mental status returned to baseline and it became clear there was no meningitis .
A psych consult was obtained the next morning who recommended Haldol/Cogentin.
He required sedation with Haldol/Ativan/Dilaudid to get a head CT (which was negative for a bleed).
A neuro consult was obtained the next day who recommended stopping Haldol due to the rigidity.
An EEG showed nonspecific slowing consistent with his sedation.
Infectious workup (CXRs, cultures) remained negative and he remained afebrile.
## ?DI/endocrine: - during previous admission there was a reported history of diabetes insipidus; a water deprivation test was done during that admission, though endocrine did not see the patient.
Endocrine was consulted this time and recommended a pituitary MRI which showed a lack of expected hyperintensity in the neurohypophysis.
No water deprivatino test was done, though his ddAVP was stopped when he became psychotic and his sodium remained normal with normal urine output.
MRI chest showed no PE and PA hypertension - continued Advair - weaned off of O2 as tolerated .
## FEN: Poor po intake x weeks per sister; NPO in MICU - 500cc NS bolus then NS at 125cc/hr; check fluid status closely - daily lytes; watch for rising sodium - dysphagia diet, thickened liquids; may need speech/swallow eval .
