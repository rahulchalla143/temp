Biopsy of the mass demonstrated adenocarcinoma.
EUS staging was T3 possibly N1 disease, however CT of the torso and PET scan ruled out metastatic disease; he was stage IIA (T3N0M0).
Followup PET/CT on [**10-9**] demonstrated decreased uptake within known esophageal cancer following neoadjuvant therapy.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat are normal.
The chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.

[**2154-11-22**]: Chest PA/Lateral FINDINGS: In the interval, a nasogastric tube and a left chest tube have been removed.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
He was taken to the PACU, where he had no events, so he was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit for monitoring overnight.
On [**2154-11-20**] the patient had a radiographic swallow study that demonstrated no leak of or stricture at the anastamosis.
On [**2154-11-21**], it was noted that the JP drain fluid was somewhat darker and cloudier than previously, so the fluid was sent for amylase, which was found to be normal at 15.
The patient was transitioned from sips to a clear liquid diet, which he tolerated well without nausea or vomiting.
He had a semi-loose bowel movment, and he ambulated throughout the day without difficulty.
On [**2154-11-22**], the JP drain fluid from the neck was sent for gram stain and culture.
Gram stain demonstrated 4+ gram-positive cocci, 4+ gram-negative rods, and 3+ gram-positive rods.
Preliminary culture on [**2154-11-23**] demonstrated pseudomonas aeruginosa, determined on [**11-24**] to be sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
