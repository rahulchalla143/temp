Where vitals were 148/80 79 18 97% RA.
HGB/HCT was 13.6/41, INR 1.1.
Non-Con CT chest showed known pulmonary mets apparently unchanged from [**2135-1-4**] thought the final read was not available.
Labs were notable for Na 130, WBC 3.3, Hgb/Hct 12.5/37, Plts 129, normal coags.
CXR showed elevated right hemidiaphragm with minimal mediastinal shift to the right.
Vitals on transfer were P:71 BP:151/65 20 100% 3LNC.
Of note, patient underwent bronchoscopy [**2135-1-17**] with where stenosis of the bronchus intermedius stent was noted and treted with balloon dilation of the right middle segment/bronchus intermedius and tumor ablation with electrocautery of granulation tissue within the stent and in the distal end of the stent.
Pathology noted a 3-cm clear cell lesion, grade I - II, confined to the cortex.
Ureteral & vascular margins were  free of tumor, no vascular invasion was seen.
He was followed serially with CT scans.
- in late [**2132**], developed recurrent hemoptysis which prompted ENT  evaluation & chest imaging, which showed a compressive mass in  the right bronchus.
He had a flexible bronchoscopy at [**Hospital1 1562**] complicated by significant bleeding & was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2133-1-14**].
Chest CT showed a mass encasing the right pulmonary artery & invading the bronchus intermedius.
- [**Date range (1) 14706**] Sutent was restarted, completed 1 cycle; but [**2133-7-21**] bloodwork showed low WBC/Plts, drug was again held through [**2133-8-8**].
- on [**2133-11-25**], saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for bronchoscopy which showed stent in good position, no endobronchial lesions were seen.
- [**1-9**] Platelets>150 and CT chest showed interval growth of right hilar mass, w/ worse occlusion of the R mainstem bronchus.
- in follow-up [**2134-2-2**], his cough had improved but plts were low, necessitating hold - on [**2134-2-17**], restarted once plts 98 - follow-up [**2134-3-2**], He was doing well apart from ongoing respiratory symptoms of cough, sputum production & scant hemoptysis/mild epistaxis.
His platelets were 109.
platelets were stable at 95.
- On [**2134-7-13**] CT appeared to show overall minimal decrease to affected area and decreased compression of the right main stem  bronchus.

[**2135-2-2**] Bronchoscopy in brief: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
A physical exam was performed.

On the night of his admission he underwent rigid broncoscopy by IP who saw that he had a fractured bronchus intermedius stent with friable tissue around it, causing right main stem bleeding.
He had an uneventful night, and the was transferred to the floor for additional monitoring.
In the MICU that morning he had a fever to 100.4, which was believed to be from the procedure, and no cultures were taken, no antibiotics were given.
His O2 saturation and Hct remained stable on the floor during his stay.
Subjectively his cough decreased to him, and reports that the productive of his cough decreased, was less bloody.
# Chest Pain: The patient had an episode of chest pain on the night of his floor stay, and then again during the day on [**2-3**].
Because of this we cycled two troponins, which were negative, got a CXR which didn't show new focal consolidation, and got lower extremity U/S, which was also negative for DVT.
3) His amlodopine and atenolol were stopped during this admission due to concern of hypotension and blood loss.
His blood pressure will need to be re-checked to resume his medication.
GUAIFENESIN [MUCINEX] - 1,200 mg [**Hospital1 **]   Discharge Medications: 1. amlodipine 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
)(s)* Refills:*1* 11. codeine sulfate 15 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every 4-6 hours as needed for cough.
The interventional pulmonologists performed a bronchoscopy which showed that one of the your stents was broken, and that you had some bleeding tissue around the stent.
