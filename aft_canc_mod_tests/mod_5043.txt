The CT scan during this visit demonstrated a new 15 mm spiculated right upper lobe nodule.
Pulmonary function tests demonstrated a FEV-1 of 2.04 which is 68% of predicted and a DLCO of 59% predicted but he has restrictive lung disease.
A preoperative PET scan demonstrated activity within the lesion but not elsewhere within the body.
I had a long discussion with the family preoperatively and I indicated to them that there is a high likelihood of an open resection given the extent of scarring seen on CT scan from the asbestosis.

We performed a flexible bronchoscopy and examined the entire tracheobronchial tree.
We biopsied a lymph node from the pre carinal lymph node.
We then used the US Surgical thoracoscopic stapler with a 6 cm long, wide mouth thick tissue staplers to perform a wedge excision down to near the hilum.
On gross analysis, the tumor came close to the margin but I felt I had a clean margin.
His pulmonary function tests demonstrated restrictive lung disease and he has a history of pulmonary fibrosis and COPD.
Although his pulmonary function tests suggest that he might tolerate a lobectomy, his physiological status and his history suggests that he would not.
The plan will be to follow him closely with 3 month serial CT scans.
