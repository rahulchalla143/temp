Sclerotic appearance of right posterior 10th rib and adjacent pedicle of the T10 vertebra, with increased uptake seen on bone scan in [**2201**], which may represent an old traumatic injury, however, is also concerning for metastatic disease given the patient's history of metastatic prostate cancer.
-AP CXR ([**2203-2-18**]): enlarged heart.
His urine culture (from the replaced nephrostomy tube) showed pansensitive Pseudomonas.
We considered a nephrostogram to ensure proper placement of the tube, however IR felt the tube was correctly placed based on a KUB that was obtained.
His tachypnea was thought to be due to primarily CHF.
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient was found to be congested on CXR and exam, he was also significantly orthopneic.
# Depression: Continued home dose of fluoxetine  # Transitional issues: -Will follow-up with his urologist regarding removal of his Foley catheter -Will follow-up with his oncologist regarding his metastatic prostate cancer and alternative treatment options given that his PSA continued to rise on the current regimen -Amlodipine was held at discharge given SBP of 110-120, BP control should be re-evaluated as an outpatient -He will continue Cipro PO after discharge for a total 14 day course  Medications on Admission: - albuterol 90mcg 2puffs QID - albuterol nebs - amlodipine 5mg daily - finasteride 5mg daily - fluoxetine 20mg daily - fluticasone 100 mcg nasal daily - Advair 500/50mcg 1 puff [**Hospital1 **] - furosemide 80mg daily - gabapentin 300mg QHS - hydrocortisone 20mg QAM, 10mgQPM - ketoconazole 400mg [**Hospital1 **] - loratadine 10mg daily - lorazepam 0.5mg 1-2 tabs QHS - metformin 500mg [**Hospital1 **] - metoprolol succinate 50mg Q24hr - montelukast 10mg daily - omeprazole 40mg daily - rosuvastatin 20mg daily - tiotropium 18mcg daily - tramadolol 50mg 1-2 tabs QID - Aspirin 81mg daily - ferrous sulfate 325mg [**Hospital1 **] - senna 8.6mg 2 tabs daily   Discharge Medications: 1. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 2-4 Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
We stopped your amlodipine because your blood pressure was normal without it.
