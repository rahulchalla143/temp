Admission Date:  [**2151-6-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-6-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-9-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**] Chief Complaint: BRBPR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Examine under anesthesia with anoscopy Colonoscopy EGD   History of Present Illness: This is a 77-year-old Spanish-speaking Jehovah's witness with multiple medical comorbidities (HTN, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, anxiety/depression, Parkinson's and dementia) who underwent hemorrhoidal surgery on [**6-4**], developed BRBPR 2 days later and was found to have Hct of 24 and INR on 10 (not on coumadin), stabilized in MICU and now transferred to the floor for further w/u of anemia.
Her INR was found to be 9.9 although the patient reports to never having been on coumadin and was not taking any herbal medications or rat poison.
On transfer, patient was asymptomatic (HR 80s, SBP 130s).
Heme-onc felt that her presentation and labs were consistent with ingestion of vitamin-K antagonist (found that factors 2,7,10 were low, 5,8,9, normal).
Mixing studies were negative.
She was taken to the OR on [**6-11**] for [**Month/Day (4) **] with anoscopy where her hemorrhoids were noted to appear clean, although melena was found and her rectum was packed with Surgicell.
GI felt that her BRBPR was likely [**1-7**] lower GI but recommended endoscopy and colonoscopy to look for origin.
Endoscopy was unremarkable other than a polyp in the stomach and colonoscopy was remarkable for diverticulosis of the whole colon, several small (2-5 mm) polyps and ulceration in the rectum, the latter of which was thought to be the source of the patient's recent bleeding.
Her Hct on transfer from the MICU was 21.9 and the patient remained asymptomatic throughout.

Impression: Polyp in the stomach Otherwise normal colonoscopy to third part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: 77-year-old Spanish-speaking Jehovah's witness with multiple medical comorbidities (HTN, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, anxiety/depression, Parkinson's and dementia) who underwent hemorrhoidal surgery on [**6-4**], developed BRBPR 2 days later and was found to have Hct of 24 and INR on 10 (not on coumadin), stabilized in MICU then transferred to the floor for further w/u of anemia and management of rectal and abdominal pain.
We gave her senna, colace, miralax and an XXX enema to help her to continue having bowel movemenents.
The colorectal team performed a rectal exam which was unremarkable and suggested giving her low dose gabapentin.
# Coagulopathy: on admission, the patient's INR was 9.9.
Factor deficiencies (2, 7, 10 low) and correction of INR with vitamin K were consistent with ingestion of vitamin-K antagonist.
Her MCV was 94 but RDW was elevated, suggesting a combination of iron-deficiency from bleeding (though transferrin and were TIBC low, perhaps because there was not enough time to equilibrate) with macrocytic anemia.
She was found to have an innappropriately low reticulocyte count, although platelet and WBC count were normal thus not pancytopenic.
On discharge, her Hct was 22.3.
She should have retic count rechecked as outpatient once stable and consider heme/onc referral if persistently low.
# Abdominal pain: the patient had abdominal pain and abdominal exam was remarkable for diffuse tenderness without any peritoneal signs.
Of note, she had an abdominal CT in [**2148**] which was normal (but did not have elevated LFTs then).
On this admission, she underwent a RUQ u/s which showed no stones in the gallbladder but was remarkable for fatty infiltration of the liver.
We also sent an H. pylori which was negative.
On discharge, abdominal pain was improved and LFTs were normal with the exception of slightly elevated alk phos at 118.
She will have outpatient GI follow-up.
# Genital herpes: on the last day of your admission, you pointed out several small erythematous papules near your vagina, which appeared to be genital herpes.
Transitional Issues: 1) Will f/u with colorectal, GI, PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 478**] (for monthly IV iron infusions) 2) Please f/u warfarin levels  Medications on Admission: Preadmissions medications listed are incomplete and require futher investigation.

Several hours after arriving to the emergency room, you passed more blood from your rectum and your hematocrit dropped to a very low level, prompting your transfer to the medical intensive care unit.
You had an exam under anesthesia with anoscopy which showed that the sites of the excised hemorrhoids were not bleeding.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was unremarkable, however a colonoscopy showed that you had a rectal ulcer, which we thought was the source of your bleeding.
