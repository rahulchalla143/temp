Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation & bronchoscopy liver biopsy Left internal jugular central venous catheter placement Right radial arterial catheter placement bone marrow biopsy tracheostomy placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 72 yo F with h/o DM, OSA, right hemispheric CVA in the past, ?seizure disorder admitted on [**2146-12-4**] with chief complaint of ataxia and unsteady gait.
CT performed in the ED showed a 5 mm hypodensity in the right basal ganglia.
Neurology evaluation feels this is an evolving embolic CVA.
MRI showed occlusion of the R ICA with watershed infarction in the right hemisphere on [**12-4**].
Repeat MR today showed extension of the right infarct with multiple other small watershed infarcts in the thalmus and left hemisphere.
In addition, she was noted to have a nodule on a CXR performed in the ED, CT of the chest showed multiple nodules concerning for either infection vs. malignancy.
CT abd/pelvis showed hpodensities in the liver and spleen with multiple lymph nodes however no mass.
In [**4-26**] her plts were ~400 however on admission they were 30-40's.
Her Hct was 41 in [**2141**] then low 30's starting in [**11-25**].
Her WBC count started to trend down in [**11-25**] as well.
Of note, she reported a positive TB test in the past (15 yrs and 5 yrs ago) but never recieved treatment.
Past Medical History: 1)Diabetes mellitus - diet controlled 2)OSA - on BiPAP 12/8 3)Cataract in the left eye 4)CVA/TIA (positive MRI) - right frontal with L arm/hand hemiparesis; etiology likely moderate degree stenosis of the ICA in the cavernous region, stable on recent CTA 5)Asthma 6)Hypercholesterolemia 7)Seizure?
- L arm involuntary movements [**2144**] 8)Recent colonoscopy in [**2144**] with single sessile 4-5 mm non-bleeding polyp of benign appearance, s/p removal.

CXR [**12-4**] 2.5 cm and 8 mm nodular opacities projecting over right mid lung, highly concerning for malignancy.
Dedicated chest CT is recommended to further evaluate these findings.
CT Chest w/out contrast 1.
Please correlate clinically, and please perform dedicated abdominal imaging such as ultrasound or contrast enhanced CT if renal function permits.

CTA Abd/Pelvis [**12-6**] No clear primary malignancy.
With the constellation of findings of multiple pulmonary nodules, ill-defined liver and splenic lesions, and lymphadenopathy, metastatic disease cannot be excluded.
An MRI of the liver is recommended for further characterization of the liver lesions.

[**12-16**] TTE:Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-12-9**], a small pericardial effusion is now present; otherwise no major change.
Compared with the prior study of [**2146-12-16**] (images reviewed), the severity of  mitral regurgitation has decreased.
Aortic regurgitation and pulmonary artery  systolic pressure are similar (and were overestimated on the prior study).
[**1-2**] CT CAP:1.
[**1-10**] CT CAP:1.
Please note that this study was performed without intravenous contrast, limiting full evaluation for any change in the extent of liver lesions.
[**1-19**] chest USN for [**Female First Name (un) 576**]: No significant effusion seen at the right lung base.
[**12-9**] liver needle biopsy: Liver, needle-core biopsy:Liver with granulomatous inflammation including large necrotizing granuloma.
[**12-16**] Pleural fluid, right: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
However, a concurrent wedge biopsy of the lung, contains similar necrotizing lesions as in this liver, where there are acid fast organisms present consistent with mycobacteria (please see report: S07-3791).
An iron stain demonstrates increased stainable iron.
A GMS stain is negative for fungal organisms.
Immunoperoxidase studies show the following: CD3, CD5, and CD43 stain many T-cells, while CD20 stains a smaller percentage of B-cells.

For now, continue coverage with Vancomycin for positive blood culture on [**1-17**], source probably line infection.
However, sputum cultures still growing E. Coli on [**1-17**].
For evaluation of the fever infectious/autoimmune serologies and blood work as listed above in Pertinent Results section.
TTE was negative for endocarditis, and TEE was deferred due to inability reach family for consent.
2) Evolving Watershed Infarcts: Repeat MRI showed evolving infarcts in watershed distribution with progressive neurological decline.
DDx influces embolic from tight R ICA lesions vs. brain mets vs. infectious such as TB involvement of CNS.
TTE was performed to search for [**Month/Year (2) **] vegetations as etiology of ?
In the setting of her respiratory failure on [**12-9**], head was reimaged but CT without any interval change.
3) Respiratory failure - Patient with new onset respiratory distress on the evening of [**12-9**] with ABG 7.4/35/48.
