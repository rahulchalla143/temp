His blood cultures have remained negative, but his fluid culture has GNR growing and currently on Zosyn.
Biopsy results showed chronic gastritis, despite suspicious appearance on EGD.
It is thought that his bleeding was secondary to the biopsy site, from his gastritis or esophagitis.
He had a recent chest CT scan that showed a fluid filled esophagus.
Given progressive hypoxia and concern for aspiration, he underwent a chest CT which showed primarily bilateral effusions with associated atelectasis.
* goals of care - Discussed with family, but decision made to return to primary hospital under care of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] service, surgeon, all well known to patient and family for continued evaluation and treatment.
