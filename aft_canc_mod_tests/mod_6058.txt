Since that time she has had a PET scan for repeat staging which showed persistent upper mediastinal adenopathy, and head MRI revealing a suprasellar lesion that was biopsied by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and found to be consistent with a benign cyst.
Biopsy of the  mediastinal nodes revealed only non-necrotizing granulomas with no evidence for metastasis.

A pediatric bronchoscope was used to examine the central airways.
No endobronchial purulence, tumor, or blood was noted to the subsegmental level.
The patient was positioned in the left lateral decubitus position, and the right chest was prepped and draped as a single sterile field.
A standard serratus-sparing lateral thoracotomy was made, and the chest was entered through the sixth intercostal space.
Palpation of the lung revealed no nodules.
We incised the phrenoesophageal ligament and delivered the mobilized distal esophagus into the abdomen.
We secured a 30 mL balloon Foley catheter to the umbilical tape and put the balloon inside an arthroscopy drape which was secured around the balloon with a silk tie.
[**MD Number(2) 39921**]  Dictated By:[**Name8 (MD) 65844**] ***** [**2197-12-6**] POSTOPERATIVE CHEST XRAY: INDICATION: Status post esophagectomy.
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with a preceding similar study of [**2197-11-23**].
Area of upper abdomen shows now status post surgery with midline metallic staple line and surgical clips in left hiatal area.
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2197-12-7**].
TECHNIQUE: Oral contrast was administered through the J-tube, and MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images through the torso without IV contrast.
The study was compared with [**2197-10-23**] CT scan from PET-CT.  CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Esophagectomy surgical drainage tube to the left of the pull-through.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Gallbladder is distended, but without radiopaque stones or CT evidence of cholecystitis.
Liver, adrenals, pancreas, kidneys, and small-bowel loops are within normal limits.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Bladder is collapsed with a Foley.
Bilateral, right greater than left air space consolidations, which may represent an infectious process.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-12-11**], the pericardial effusion now appears slightly larger.
[**2197-12-30**] CT SINUS: [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 62 year old woman s/p esophagectomy complicated by pneumonia, afib, ARF, sepsis, febrile from unknown cause.
COMPARISON: Multiple prior chest radiographs, and head CT from [**2197-11-2**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial imaging of the paranasal sinuses was performed without intravenous contrast.
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained and reviewed.
CT OF THE SINUSES: Visualized paranasal sinuses are normally aerated, with the exception of a small amount of fluid and/or mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus and its lateral recesses.
The cribriform plates are intact, with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 36826**] type 2 configuration bilaterally.
The nasal septum is midline, with a small leftward deviated spur.
A small amount of pericholecystic fluid is thought more likely related to ascites, which was demonstrated on the recent CT study.
COMPARISONS: CT torso of [**2197-12-30**] and CT torso of [**2197-12-13**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images through the chest without IV contrast with coronal and sagittal reformatted images.
Limited noncontrast imaging through the upper abdomen demonstrates no gross abnormalities.
COMPARISON: CT torso from [**2197-12-30**], abdominal ultrasound from [**2197-12-31**].
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The visualized right hepatic lobe demonstrates normal echotexture without focal mass.
Limited views of the right kidney demonstrate no evidence for hydronephrosis.
She also had an episode of hypotension with concurrent ST elevations on EKG, so cardiac enzymes were sent and she was started on Levophed.
A post-intubation xray showed patchy opacities in the RML and LLL, concerning for ARDS.
She also became febrile to 102.1, so pancultures were sent and she was started on Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Zosyn in addition to Flagyl.
Sputum cultures grew out non-resistant Pseudomonas, and pansensitive enterobacter.
On POD 4 Nephrology was consulted for her rising creatinine and acute renal failure.
however she continued to spike fevers, so all of her lines were changed and cultures were resent.
She remained relatively stable, requiring constant pressors and ventilation and intermittently in Afib, but her chest xrays continued to show increased infiltrates bilaterally.
Her pupils were noted to be unequal on [**1-4**] so a CT head was ordered which showed only sinusitis and the previously visualized suprasellar mass.
Her WBC count started to rise again on [**1-6**] and peaked at  46.5 on [**1-8**].
Nonetheless her respiratory status continued to worsen, and her pressure continued to drop despite pressors.
