History of Present Illness: HPI: 71 y/o female with PMH significant for atrial fibrillation, CAD, St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mitral valve replacement, and sclerosing cholangitis admitted from OSH for an ERCP.
Admission blood cultures at the OSH grew 4:4 bottles of enterococcus.
In addition, her WBC count was elevated at [**Numeric Identifier 6085**].
A TEE was done that did not show any vegitations so the gentamycin was discontinued at that time.
An abdominal US at this time was negative for cholycystitis but showed cirrhosis and mild ascities.
Blood cultures from [**2-1**] were negative.
Pt had three negative cultures for C diff on [**1-30**] and [**1-31**].
Today's labs at the OSH were significant for: WBC 12.9, Hct 36.5, Na 136, K 4.1, chloride 106, bicarb 21, BUN 33, creatinine 1.2.
Pt is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to receive an ERCP to evaluate for strictures given her history of sclerosis cholangitis and positive bacteremia.
Sclerosing cholangitis- Pt reports that this was diagnosed approximately 10 years ago.
Pt is anticoagulated on coumadin with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
Cath at that time was negative per notes.
CHF with diastolic dysfunction 12.
2+ DP pulses bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: LIVER ULTRASOUND ([**2129-2-7**]) 1) There are probably two intraductal stones in the right lobe of the liver.
2) Hypoechoic lesion in segment 2 of the liver is unchanged when compared to the prior study and is concerning.
Recommend MRI of the liver for further evaluation.

Blood pressure- Initially, patient received dopamine, continous normal saline and pRBCs until BP stabilized.
Sepsis/ID- She has [**2-18**] blood cultures for enterobacter.
Urine cultures and U/A was negative.

Sclerosing cholangitis- Pt presents to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH for ERCP.
Liver ultrasound revealed likely intraductal stone and stable hypoechoic lesion.
Patient was scheduled to get ERCP, but her INR was 2.2 on transfer.
Due to her history of St. Jude's valve, atrial fibrillation, and also a history of HIT, decision was made to start renally dosed Lepirudin while coumadin was held and INR was reversed.
INR was lowered to 1.4 using vitamin K, and pt underwent successful ERCP and sphincterotomy with extraction of sludge on [**2-14**] after holding Lepirudin since midnight.
[**Name (NI) **] Pt with 4/4 blood clutures from OSH growing enterococcus sensitive to ampicillin.
Blood cultures from [**2-1**] were negative.
TEE at OSH was negative for vegetation.
Abdominal US did not show any cholangitis or cholecystitis.
Stool was negative for C diff.
At this time, pt is afebrile and WBC count was normal at OSH this morning.
After d/c her c dif toxin b returned negative, and her PO vanco was discontinued.
[**Hospital3 9642**] mitral valve- Pt is normally anticoagulated on coumadin with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
Sent home on alternating days dosing of 2 mg then 1 mg warfarin with f/u check of INR in three days.
