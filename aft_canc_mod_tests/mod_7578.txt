Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.

# Cardiac Ischemia: No evidence of active coronary ischemia.
Dilated cardiomyopathy, cardiac catheterization demonstrated three vessel disease, but patient is not a candidate for surgical revascularization based on poor myocardial viability.
Diuresed initially with lasix infusion and then with lasix 40mg IV bid, with slight improvement in valvular regurgitation on echo after diuresis.
Discussed invasive hemodynamic monitoring with tailored therapy as a potential option with patient and family, but patient did not wish invasive measures.
COPD, also restrictive lung disease post XRT: - no real benefit at this time for nebs, but pt may use for subjective relief - supplemental O2 as needed .
