Of note, pt had a colonoscopy on [**10-30**] that showed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and ascending colon, a polyp at 80cm in the colon (single piece polypectomy with cold snare), and friability and congestion in the sigmoid colon.
Labs showed stable H/H at 11.3/ 33.2 (11.9/34.6 on DC friday).
PLT 145 (170 on DC), and WBC of 17.3. .
Pt had a colonoscopy on [**10-30**] for thickening of his sigmoid colon seen on CT scan.
His Hct and hemodynamics were stable, and he had elevated WBC's after being given Neulasta recently.
Had sigmoidoscopy [**11-13**] which was unrevealing due to poor prep.
Repeat colonoscopy was done [**11-15**] and was concerning for necrosis of mid-sigmoid and proximal sigmoid.
Rheumatology was consulted on [**11-20**] for R knee pain and swelling and fever to 102 and tapped his knee which showed monosodium urate crystals consistent with his h/o gout; Gstain and culture were negative.
EKG was concerning for septal elevations, with TWI in II-III, and cardiac enzymes were seen to be elevated with an elevated BNP as well.
Echo showed EF 35-40%, TR gradient 33, near akinesis of the septum, 1+MR, [**12-10**]+TR, RV normal.
Cardiology was consulted and felt this was related to demand ischemia, but felt further work-up indicated.
CXR now shows substantial improvement in the previously moderately-severe pulmonary edema.
CT abd showed thickening of the distal descending colon as well as a small splenic mass and a large 6 cm mass in his buttock as well as new spiculated nodules at the base of his lungs.
He had a needle biopsy of his buttock mass done by IR at [**Hospital1 **] which showed recurrence of his large cell lymphoma from [**2102**].
He underwent a colonoscopy earlier in [**Month (only) **] that showed some very mild thickening of his colon that did not look malignant, biopsies consistent with radiation induced colitis.
Pt was admitted [**11-5**] for R-ICE therapy which he tolerated well (infusion reaction to rituxan resolved with slower rate of infusion and solumedrol) and was discharged [**2114-11-9**] and recieved neulasta that day in clinic.

Normal IVC diameter (<=2.1cm) with >50% decrease with sniff (estimated RA pressure (0-5 mmHg).
Mild (1+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets.
Suboptimal image quality - patient unable to cooperate.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated severe three-vessel CAD.
This was best visualized in the [**Doctor Last Name **] caudal and AP cranial projections, as other projections were limited by contrast streaming.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal left and right-sided filling pressures.
Cardiac output and index were preserved at 5.2L/min and 2.7L/min/m2, respectively.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis [**2114-11-28**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**12-2**] IMPRESSION: 1.
He had a CT abdomen which showed colonic thickening, and had colonoscopy [**10-30**] with biopsies showing ulceration consistent with radiation proctitis, but given poor prep, was difficult to visualize; also had polypectomy.
and had sigmoidoscopy [**11-13**] and colonoscopy [**11-15**] concerning for necrosis of mid-sigmoid and proximal sigmoid.
On post-op day 4, in the setting of fevers, pt underwent CT abdomen showing a 5.7 x 2.7cm partially organized fluid collection in the pelvis - likely representing a seroma given the time-frame post-op (as the patient had no intraabdominal intestinal anastomosis, there was no possibility that this could represent an anastomotic leak).
On [**11-21**] he began having chest pressure, acutely SOB and hypoxic, so started on NRB and CXR showed flash edema and transferred to MICU for diuresis.
There, on [**11-23**] he NSTEMI'd with positive uptrending cardiac enzymes and EKG changes, thought to be due to demand ischemia, so taken to cardiac cath which showed bad 3vd and 60-70% left main disease, but he was not felt to be an operable / intervenable candidate, so it was medically managed with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and ACS medications.
However, he then started vomiting and had abdominal pain, had a WBC count, and was tachycardic and found to have on CTAP [**11-28**] to have SBO with high grade transition point in the RLQ.
He defervesced, but over the next ~5-6 days his SBO was not getting better, NGT was putting out >1L of bilious vomit per day, WBC count back up, and he was persistently tachycardic.
Repeat CT abdomen [**12-2**] showed persistent high grade SBO in same location, getting worse with larger loops of bowel.
Broad spectrum ABx were stopped on [**12-5**], Morphine was given more liberally.
His SBO was not active at the time of discharge, but earlier in his course his secretions and symptoms were well controlled with SC ondansetron TID.
Your postoperateive course was complicated by a stress-related heart attack, fluid in your lungs causing low oxygen levels, fevers, a high white blood cell count, a fast heart rate.
You had a cardiac catheterization that showed diffuse severe coronary artery disease but you were felt to be too high risk for interventions at this time, so your heart attack was treated medically.
