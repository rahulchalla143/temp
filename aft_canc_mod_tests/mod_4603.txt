He denies any other weight loss and has been seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] and comes to the [**Hospital1 18**] for a thoracotomy and segmentectomy for his lung mass that was seen on CT.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for COPD and BPH.
Upon presentation, the patient was sent for a CT scan with contrast; which was notable for a 5.2- x 5-cm right lung mass with several small adjacent satellite nodules.
An EKG which showed normal sinus rhythm with no signs of ischemia.
An x-ray was also obtained on the 17th which showed a large right hilar mass.
Pathology was sent, which is still pending.
Postoperative chest x-ray was noted which showed a posterior section of atelectasis of the remnant upper lung with a 17-mm apical pneumothorax and an indwelling chest tube x 2.
His left chest showed decreased breath sounds with a faint wheeze.
A chest x-ray was obtained on the 20th which again - compared to the 19th - showed a small right apical pneumothorax which had a slight increase in size.
On the 21st, as well, the apical chest tube was also removed and an x-ray was also obtained which showed a moderate hydropneumothorax which was relatively unchanged from previous exams.
On the 22nd, the patient again underwent another chest x-ray which showed a slightly increased pneumothorax with a significantly pleural effusion which was possibly loculated.
Later in that afternoon he underwent another chest x-ray which showed an interval decrease in the size of the right apical pneumothorax.
Upon discharge, the patient is sent for an x-ray which shows no change from previous exams with the left lung being clear.
A PT evaluation was obtained on the 20th, which said the patient would probably need pulmonary rehab for his pulmonary issues and for pulmonary PT.
RELATIVE SIGNIFICANT RESULTS IN LABORATORIES:  Upon admission, the patient had a white count of 10.4, with hematocrit 35.5, a platelet count of 291.
He also had a sodium of 143, a potassium of 4.3, a chloride of 101, with a bicarbonate of 34, his BUN was 14, with a creatinine of 1.1, and a glucose of 109, and a calcium of 9.7, a phosphorous of 3.4, and a magnesium of 2.1.
Immediately postoperatively, the patient had a white count of 7.9 with a hematocrit of 29.3, a platelet count of 267.
Postoperatively, he had a sodium of 139, a potassium of 4.1, a chloride of 92, a bicarbonate of 43, a BUN of 11, a creatinine of 0.7, with a glucose of 128.
He also had a calcium of 8.3, a phosphorous of 2.7 and a magnesium of 2.0.
Upon discharge, the patient has a white count of 6.6, a hematocrit of 33.3 and a platelet count of 437.
He has a sodium of 138, a potassium of 4.0, chloride 91, bicarbonate 40, BUN 13, creatinine 0.8, and glucose of 172.
He has a calcium of 9.3, a phosphorous of 3.7 and a magnesium level of 2.2.
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  He is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in 2 to 3 weeks for a postoperative care evaluation and monitoring of his pulmonary status.
