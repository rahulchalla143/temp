Pulmonary vascularity and hilar contours are within normal limits.
#CT ABD/PELVIS [**2185-1-21**] STUDY: CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast; coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also generated.
COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen and pelvis from [**2176-12-19**].
BONES: Patient is status post posterior spinal fusion of L5-S1 with grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-21**], 2:11 a.m.:  Pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement are new and although heart size is normal and pleural effusions are small if any, the interstitial abnormality in the lungs is most likely mild edema.
Improved from [**1-21**]'s chest x-ray.
Initially also received vancomycin PO given concern for colitis based on symptoms and finding of bowel wall thickening on CT abdomen/pelvis on preliminary read; symptoms resolved, C. difficile toxin was negative, and final read changed to no evidence of colitis.
Creatinine (baseline 0.6) improved from 4.0 to 3.0 with fluid resuscitation; etiology suspected to be ATN and component of prerenal azotemia.
She remained afebrile, without leukocytosis, hemodynamically stable throughout her course, with blood pressures in the 110-120s systolic.
Although her admission urine culture grew out fungus and she clinically improved on fluconazole in the MICU, it seemed unlikely that fungal UTI was responsible for her sepsis (blood cultures showed no fungus growth, patient was non-toxic appearing).
Her foley was discontinued, and a repeat UA was obtained, which was negative except for trace leukocytes and an additional urine culture was sent.
At the time of discharge, the patient remained afebrile, hemodynamically stable and all of her culture data was with no growth to date.
We continued to hold all her anti-hypertensive medications, and her blood pressures were not elevated.
On the floor, her urine output improved and her phosphorus came down to normal range.
A stool c-diff was sent on admission and returned negative.
No stool cultures were obtained.
The diarrhea resolved on the floor without treatment and the patient reported that her stools were more formed at the time of discharge.
Her citalopram was discontinued, and she was started on mirtazapine 7.5 mg QHS.
QTc was obtained prior to each haldol administration and was consistently normal.
Her hematocrit was found to be [**Known lastname **] at 24 on admission, and she was transfused 1U PRBC in the MICU, but this Hct value was reportedly around her baseline in the setting of myelodysplasia.
Her hematocrit remained stable throughout her time on the floor until the time of discharge.
You were admitted for [**Known lastname **] blood pressure, sepsis, and kidney damage.
Your urine culture grew out yeast and your IV antibiotics were changed to oral antifungals and you continued to improve.
Your kidneys were damaged by the [**Known lastname **] blood pressure and IV antibiotics you were taking prior to your admission.
We made the following adjustments to your medications: STOPPED Valium 2.5mg PO every 6 hours as needed anxiety STOPPED Citalopram 5mg by mouth at night STARTED Mirtazipine 7.5 mg oral at night STARTED Haloperidol 1 mg PO at night as needed for agitation .
As a reminder, the following medications were discontinued at your rehabilitation facility due to [**Known lastname **] blood pressure.
We continued to hold your blood pressure because your blood pressure was not elevated.
