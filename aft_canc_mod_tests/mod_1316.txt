Labs significant for WBC count of 11.9, with 94% neutrophils.
INR 1.7.
Colorectal surgery was called and recommend a CT abdomen.
CT showed diffuse colitis from cecum to hepatic flexure and stable metastatic disease, no focal abscess.

?s blood pressures remained in the 80s-100s systolic despite fluid resuscitation and downtrending lactate.
Bedside echo did not show evidence of tamponade.
CT scan showed significant worsening of his pulmonary metastases, stable pleural effusions, and a likely pneumonia.
However abdominal exam is benign with good bowel sounds.
-hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia has been omnipresent [**6-20**] -CTA-Chest revealed new RUL ground-glass opacities c/w likely hemorrhage vs infectious process; the patient was started on cefipime, vanc, and bactrim (for PCP empiric treatment).
[**6-21**] -Continued progression of respiratory decompensation, CT scan findings were confirmed to be significant worsening of thoracic tumor burden, the patient had an episode of tachypnea and worsening tachycardia overnight which resulted in bipap, additional doses of ativan, and lasix for diuresis.
During this time the patient declined intubation, and discussion was made with SW/Onc/Family/MICU with little progression with regard to end-of-life issues and critical/emergent airway management.
A chest xray was performed which revealed worsening edema and collapse of the RUL, likely c/w obstructive process due to metastatic disease.
[**6-26**] -the patient remained somnolent, unresponsive to verbal stimuli, at rounds the patient had rapid/shallow respirations, his blood pressures were 50's systolic with mottling of his lower extremities and cool extremities throughout; his appearance was noted to be peri-arrest.
