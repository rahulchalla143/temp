There, he had a leukocytosis to 18.4 with 58% neutrophils and 39% bands, creatinine 1.5, lactate of 3.9, and an anion gap of 15; he was also hypoxemic with a 3 L.min oxygen requirement.
Blood cultures eventually grew pan-sensitive group A Streptococcus.
Of note, his CPK was 189 on admission to [**Hospital1 1562**] on [**9-7**] and peaked at 3842 on [**9-8**].

All cultures remained negative.
One OSH blood culture grew group A strep.
The patient did not grow anything on blood cultures in-house.
Despite effective removal of fluids, his creatinine continued to increase and peaked at >10 prior to reversal of renal function toward normal.
His HTN was mildly responsive to fluid removal with HD but was thought mainly to be related to pain as his BP increased dramatically with any movement.
A wound vac was used in the medial and lateral aspects of the LLE.
CK should be checked in follow up.
## Right Renal Mass on CT c/w Renal Cell Carcinoma: This was discussed with the patient's wife and son.
