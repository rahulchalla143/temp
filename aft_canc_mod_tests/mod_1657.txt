MRI HEAD without and with IV contrast per tumor protocol, is necessary for better assessment of the lesion and to exclude any associated lesions.
MRI Head [**9-16**]: FINDINGS: There is a heterogeneously enhancing lesion, with central nonenhancing necrotic areas and peripheral nodular enhancement in the right cerebellar hemisphere adjacent to the tentorium, measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm in the AP, transverse and the CC dimensions.
Mild-to-moderate obstructive hydrocephalus mildly increased compared to the recent CT study.
Neurosurgical consult and when appropriate, stereotactic-guided biopsy can be considered based on the neurosurgical consult.
Imaging of his head showed a t Rt cerebellar mass.
