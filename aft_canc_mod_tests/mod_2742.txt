Findings consistent with gastritis  Right upper extremity ultrasound: FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, and left subclavian veins were performed.
Limited evaluation of the right brachial vein demonstrates no evidence for occlusive thrombus  Echocardiogram [**2171-5-8**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
LVEF 50-60%     Brief Hospital Course: ## GI bleed:  Workup at outside hospital negative.
