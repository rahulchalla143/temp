The patient's previous workup for shortness of breath has included a CT angiogram on [**2161-12-2**] which was negative for pulmonary embolism but notable for bilateral ground-glass opacities.
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 70% with mild aortic and mitral regurgitation.
MRI of the head revealed no metastatic disease, however, bone scan indicated thoracic metastases.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission, the patient had a temperature of 97, blood pressure 162/82, heart rate 88, respiratory rate 28, and oxygen saturation 98% on three liters nasal cannula.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Oropharynx clear, moist mucous membranes, jugular venous pulsation not elevated, neck supple, anicteric sclerae, extraocular movements intact, no lymphadenopathy present in the cervical region.
Extremities:  2+ bilateral pitting edema, no cyanosis or clubbing, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally, skin warm and dry.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count 6.1, hematocrit 32.2, platelet count 263,000, sodium 137, potassium 4.1, chloride 106, bicarbonate 18, BUN 34, creatinine 1.3, glucose 109.
Chest x-ray, [**2161-12-12**] revealed bilateral interstitial infiltrates, bilateral pleural effusions, mild congestive heart failure.
Transthoracic echocardiogram, [**2161-12-16**] showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy, hyperdynamic left ventricular function with a moderate pericardial effusion, no change from echocardiogram on [**2161-12-8**].
Transthoracic echocardiogram, [**2162-1-4**] showed left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55% with loculated moderate sized 1.5 cm pericardial effusion with fibrin deposits on the surface of the heart; no echocardiographic signs of tamponade; compared with prior echocardiogram, the pericardial effusion appears loculated at this point.
Electrocardiogram on admission showed normal sinus rhythm, Q waves in III and AVF which were old and T wave abnormalities in V2 through V6 which were nonspecific.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was initially thought to be in congestive heart failure and was aggressive diuresed until her creatinine bumped.
She was ruled out for a myocardial infarction by negative cardiac enzymes on numerous occasions during her hospitalization.
Serial echocardiograms were performed times four, which showed moderate sized pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade but evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
As the pericardial fluid was bloody, there was concern for a malignant effusion, however, cytology revealed no malignant cells.
It was significant for reactive mesothelial cells, red blood cells, lymphocytes and neutrophils.
Upon medical record review, it appears that the patient has had complaints of dyspnea since [**2161-7-13**] and, during her previous admission at the beginning of [**Month (only) **], she was noted to have oxygen saturation of 91% in room air.
The Swan-Ganz was not placed and her volume status, instead, was estimated per clinical examination and radiograph evidence that was available.
With fluid hydration after the pericardial window was placed, the creatinine trended down and is currently at 1.6 at the time of discharge.
Liver function tests were performed and found to be normal on several occasions.
An abdominal x-ray showed a distended large bowel, however, she was eventually able to move her bowels two to three days prior to discharge.
Her abdominal exam did not significantly improve after the bowel movements and, given her elevated lactate, there was concern for bowel wall ischemia, ileus or obstruction from her previous known large pelvic mass.
The option of a CT abdomen was discussed with the patient and family, who both agreed not to perform the study given the risks of worsening renal function from contrast load and their wish not to pursue surgical intervention.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Throughout her hospitalization, the patient had a minimal appetite secondary to cancer anorexia and had a few episodes of nausea and emesis.
The family, however, did not think this was consistent with the patient's wishes and, therefore, no nasogastric tube was placed.
