At that time, films revealed compression fractures of L1 and L3.
A body scan was then obtained on [**2101-12-6**] for further evaluation showing bilateral renal enlargement without evidence of excretion (nonspecific but compatible with infiltrative disease or acute glomerulonephritis), increased uptake in left ribs, increased uptake in multiple joints suggesting polyarthirits, and increased uptake in the epigastrium.
DJD 4.
2+ DP pulses bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: Labs from [**Hospital3 **]: ([**12-6**]) C-ANCA- <1:20    P-ANCA- <1:20    C3 complement- 144 C4 complement- 39 ([**12-10**]) WBC- 9.4, Hct- 25.7, platelets- 252, Na- 142, K- 3.8, chloride- 117, bicarb- 14, BUN- 75, creatinine- 6.6, glucose- 83 .
CXR ([**12-7**])- Heat size is within normal limits.
Lumbar spine ([**12-7**])- Moderate loss of vertebral body height of L1 and L2.
Lateral film cervical spine ([**12-7**])- C1 through C6 is identified.
AP pelvis ([**12-7**])- Both hips are internally rotated.
Single view left femur ([**12-7**])- No blastic of lytic lesions seen.
Increased uptake in the epigastrium is a nondiagnostic finding and is not explained on the basis of either this exam or the recent abdomen CT scan.
Renal US ([**12-5**])- Kidneys are normal without evidence of renal mass, stone, or obstruction.
The right kidney measures 13.0 cm in length and the left measures 12.5 cm.
Noncontrast CT scan of abdomen and pelvis ([**12-5**])- Moderate compression of the L2 vertebral body and mild compression of the superior endplate of L1.
Noncontrast CT of T spine ([**12-11**])- Lytic destruction of the T4 verterbal body with extension into the perivertebral tissues bilaterally.
Noncontrast CT of L spine ([**12-11**])- Moderate/severe L2 and mild L1 insufficiency compression fractures.
MRI L-T spine ([**12-12**])- Pathologic compression fracture of T3, with a soft tissue lesion involving the vertebral body, pedicle and transverse process.
T-spine plain film ([**12-22**])- Patient is status post posterior thoracic spinal fusion, spanning T2-T6 with [**Location (un) 931**] rods and pedicle screws.
Loss of height is similar in degree when compared to the CT exam of [**2101-12-11**].
Bone Marrow biopsy ([**12-13**])- DIAGNOSIS: CELLULAR BONE MARROW, EXTENSIVELY INFILTRATED BY A PLASMA CELL MYELOMA.
The bone marrow aspirate shows a predominance of plasma cells, enumerated at 76% of marrow cellularity.
The concurrent bone marrow biopsy was sub-optimal for morphological evaluation and light chain immunoprofiling.
FISH evaluation for an IGH-CCND1 rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the Vysis LSI IGH/CCND1  Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe for IGH at 14q32 and CCND1 at 11q13 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL, although an IGH-CCND1 rearrangement was not detected.
A single hybridization was detected with the LSI D13S319 Probe at 13q14.3 in 5/100 nuclei, which is within the normal range established  for this probe in the Cytogenetics Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**].
Surgical pathology ([**12-20**])- T3 lesion: Fibrous tissue with plasma cell infiltrate, consistent with plasmacytoma.
Fragments of bone, cartilage and fibroadipose tissue with focal areas of necrosis, consistent with fracture.
ECG ([**12-27**])- Sinus rhythm.
Prominent U waves could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy or possible drug/electrolyte/metabolic effect.
TTE ([**12-23**])- The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Bilateral Lower Extremity ultrasound ([**12-26**])- No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.
AP and lateral CXR ([**12-27**])- Moderate-sized left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis versus consolidation.
Portable CXR ([**12-27**])- No pneumothorax.
Near complete interval resolution left- sided pleural effusion.
Microbiology: -Stool cultures negative for C. Difficile [**12-11**] & [**12-12**] -T3 wound swab negative for microorganisms [**12-12**] -Urine cultures no growth [**12-23**] -Blood cultures no growth x2 [**12-23**] -Pleural fluid no growth, cytology pending [**12-27**] -Blood cultures x2 pending [**12-28**]   Brief Hospital Course: 59 y/o man with PMH significant for hypercholesterolemia, HTN, and [**Hospital 22982**] transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further care for ARF and question of multiple myeloma.
Multiple myeloma- was the initial concern compression fractures, ARF, anemia, hypercalcemia, and blastic and lytic lesions seen on plain imaging (not on bone scan).
Here, imaging showed mass at T3, SPEP had + monoclonal spike and bone marrow bx.
His calcium was slightly elevated on admission (10), but has normalized.
He has been anemic, with low retic and elevated ferritin, and was transfused 2uPRBC's [**12-13**], 2 uPRBC's [**12-23**], 2 uPRBC's [**12-24**], with 2 uFFP [**12-20**].
[**Name (NI) 10271**] Pt with severe ARF on presentation to the OSH, creatinine initially 12.6 ([**12-5**]) ---> 11.4 ([**12-7**]) ---> 6.6 ([**12-10**]) with a BUN of 145 ([**12-5**]) ---> 133 ([**12-7**]) ---> 75 ([**12-10**]).
Urine protein was in the nephrotic range by a spot protein/creatinine ratio.
Renal US did not show obstruction, stones, or any other clear abnormality.
This improved here and by discharge creatinine was 0.8.
Additionally he had a DEXA to look for osteoporosis - has a T score -3.5, likely from his lactose intolerance.
4 Post-operative fevers - Started post op day 1 and continued for the remainder of his hospitalization, max 102.
Blood cultures pending NG [**12-23**] x4, urine neg [**12-23**], pleural fluid cx [**12-27**] NGTD, blood cx NGTD x4 [**12-28**].
Anemia - Normocytic, likely [**2-24**] infiltration of marrow by myeloma cells, inappropriately low retic on admission, with elevated feritin, could be a component of chronic disease, vitamin B12 and folate WNl, iron studies c/w anemia of chronic dx.
Tranfussion goal hct>21 unless brisk bleeding present or active end-organ damage/angina, active type and cross.
OSteoporosis  - should be considered for bisphosphinates after this acute phase, after discussion with heme onc re calcium levels etc.
