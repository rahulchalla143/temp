He was taken to a local emergency room and was evaluated with EGD and colonoscopy which did not reveal a clear source of the bleeding and no biopsies were taken.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis at that time showed a 15 x 14.6 x 10.7 cm mass involving the left upper quadrant contigous with the pancreas and pressing on the duodenum as well as encasing the SMV, although all the vessels were patent.
A biopsy later revealed follicular lymphoma Grade II/III, follicular and diffuse with focal progression to follicular lymphoma Grade III/III.
He had a significant residual abdominal mass but a PET scan became negative and was then under observation.
In [**12-27**], he was noted to have a rising LDH and underwent a repeat PET scan which showed uptake in the mediastinum, abdomen, and bright uptake in the right inguinal region.
In [**2155-9-24**], he underwent repeat scans which showed some new adenopathy in the groin and increased uptake in the area as well as around the large left upper quadrant lesion which has been stable.
He had repeat CAT scans done in [**2156-3-25**] which showed ongoing growth of his lymphoma particularly in the lesion in the pelvic area.
A CT scan on [**2156-6-9**] which showed that his disease was stable.

1) Liver: Given pt's elevated LFTs, a RUQ ultrasound was performed in the ED, which was normal.
An MRI of the abdomen was done and this also was negative for biliary obstruction and hepatic infection.
Liver enzymes trended upwards despite increasing immunosuppression and adding Tacrolimus, so on hospital day #3, the liver team was again consulted.
The biopsy specimen was sent for HSV stains which were negative.
Repeat biopsy on [**5-11**] was felt to be c/w improving GVHD and the decision was made to decrease methylprednisolone while continuing photopheresis.
However, after a few days he continued to have melanotic stools and repeat EGD had pathology concerning for CMV.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy showed normal mucosa.
Biopsy results from the first EGD came back positive for HSV and he was started on high dose foscarnet to treat for both HSV and CMV.
A tagged red cell scan was positive, however, so he underwent interventional angio procedure which confirmed active extravasation in the proximal jejunum.
He subsequently had a couple of episodes of melena which were thought to be clearance of remaining blood.
His hematocrit dropped from 29 to 25 the following day, however, and he therefore underwent repeat tagged RBC scan on [**5-24**] which did not demonstrate any further bleeding.
His hematocrit was subsequently stable and he was transferred back to the [**Month/Day (4) 3242**] service on [**5-25**].
His stay on the [**Month/Day (4) 3242**] service was brief, as the day after transfer he had one episode of maroon liquid stool in the morning, and another episode later that night, prompting transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 12837**] for repeat angiography (the angio on the East was flooded).
Repeat angiography on [**5-26**] demonstrated active bleeding in the region of the ligament of Treitz or proximal jejunum.
It was decided to attempt endoscopic hemostasis, therefore he underwent EGD on [**5-27**] which demonstrated active bleeding at D2-D3.
His hematocrit subsequently remained stable, and he was transferred back to the [**Month/Day (4) 3242**] service on [**6-2**].
He was continued on aminocaproic acid and his Hct remained stable.
All blood tests returned negative and again, GVHD was thought to be the cause.
However, intra-GI tract pathology was c/w HSV and possible CMV infection and the pt was treated with Foscarnet at high doses for over 3 weeks.
Serial viral cultures from oral lesions grew HSV, and acyclovir-sensitivity tests were sent out, and the results are pending.
A viral swab of the eye was negative for viral infection.
Despite this dosing pt continued to have sublingual lesions which were culture positive for HSV.
6) Cough: Given pt's worsening cough, a chest CT was done which revealed mild peribronchial wall thickening which may be [**1-26**] bronchiolitis.
Following this incident pt maintained his BP's and his line grew out coag neg staph, sensitive to vanco.
9) Sinus pain: CT showed sinusitis.
A repeat sinus CT showed interval improvement in sinus congestion.
There was some concern that his previously imaged mesenteric mass had spread to cause his persistent GI bleeding, however a CT scan done on [**6-2**] actually showed a decrease in size of his mesenteric mass.
Initially felt headaches were secondary to the med, however got CT sinus to make sure there was no worsening of his sinusitis.
MRI of the head was done which demonstarted a well demarcated enhancing lesion in the left medial temporal lobe and left basal ganglia.
A stereotactic brain biopsy was performed to determine whether the brain lesions represented toxoplasma infection vs. post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD).
The infiltrate contains small lymphocytes, some atypical cells, plasma cells, a few eosinophils, an occasional neutrophil, and in some sections many macrophages.
Immunoperoxidase studies show much of the increased intraparenchymal cellularity immunoreacts with the T-lymphocyte antibody CD3.
Varicella-Zoster vasculopathy or some reported cases of HHV-6), and possibly a biopsy near a site of principle pathology.
