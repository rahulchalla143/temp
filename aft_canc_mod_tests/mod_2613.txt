In the PACU, her oxygen saturation dropped to 68% on room air, but increased into the 90s with oxygen supplementation via nasal canula and deep breathing.
ECG obtained in the PACU showed sinus rhythm with no ST segment changes.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure.
A VQ scan showed no evidence of PE.

It was unclear why the patient suddenly became hypoxic from her congestive heart failure during the operation or in the interval following her operation as she only received 200cc of crystalloid during the AV fistula ligation and her oxygen saturation was 98% on room air pre-operatively.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.
A chest CT scan was obtained which showed:  1.
Further evaluation with MRI is recommended for better characterization of these findings.
The findings on the CT scan did not clarify the reason for the patient's gross hypoxia.
An transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed normal EF.
Prograf levels were checked on a daily basis and dosed accordingly.
