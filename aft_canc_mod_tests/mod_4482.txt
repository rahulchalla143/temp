Progression of right adrenal, likely metastatic lesion.
[**12-5**] AP CXR - FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-4**], there is little overall change in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with multiple pulmonary metastases apparently complicated by a pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.
CTA chest on admission was negative for PE.
On hospital day 3 he triggered for O2 sat of 86% on 4L nasal canula and was increased to 6L nasal canula and then transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring and placed on a face tent.
Chest x-ray demonstrated worsening bilateral patchy opacities.
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for 48 hours (vancomycin, levofloxacin, cefepime, and bactrim), however, his respiratory status failed to improve and cultures remained negative so antibiotics were stopped.
His hypoxia and dyspnea are most likely secondary to his widespread pulmonary metastatic disease.
The patient was continued on dexamethasone per his outpatient regimen which was initiated at the time of his whole brain radiation.
