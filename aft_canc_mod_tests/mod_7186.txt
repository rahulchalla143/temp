She reportedly had some radiological studies done at [**Hospital6 1129**], and was told that she had a benign tumor.
Just prior to meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3878**], she was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1906**] on the Neurosurgery service, and his workup revealed a 2.9 cm vestibular schwannoma on the right side, extending into the internal auditory canal.
An audiogram performed at her appointment in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year revealed no useful hearing on the right side, and so it was decided that a translabyrinthine approach to resection of this tumor would be the best option for this patient.
The remainder of her head and neck examination was within normal limits.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, the patient's vital signs showed a blood pressure of 137/73, pulse 75, weight 128 pounds.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination showed no scleral icterus, no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Her lungs were both clear to auscultation in all fields.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Negative other than the symptoms described in the history of present illness.
Specifically, she had a white count of 3.3, hemoglobin 13.2, hematocrit 39.5, platelet count 243,000.
Electrocardiogram done on [**2155-6-24**], revealed a normal sinus rhythm and no changes suggestive of ischemia or infarct.
Prior to her discharge, an MRI was performed as a surgical follow up, and this was read by the Neurosurgery service.
All of these discharge instructions and medications were discussed with the patient prior to her leaving the hospital, and she indicated that she understood them.
