A temperature of 101.1 was documented at time of admission.
A Neurology Consultation was obtained and CT and LP were performed which showed protein 75, glucose 58, WBC 13 (12N,78L,10M).
Given his persistent and declining mental status, he was transferred to the OMED service for further evaluation and management.
Upon arrival to OMED, labs were notable for cortisol of <0.3 and sodium of 122.
He was started on acyclovir empirically for possible viral meningitis and plan was for repeat MRI and LP (to obtain opening pressure and cytology).
He then developed right chest wall pain and a CT of the torso revealed metastatic disease to the lungs and the patient subsequently underwent 26 rounds of IL-2 therapy ending on [**2173-5-11**].
A head MRI in [**6-3**] did not reveal any intracranial masses.
On [**2173-11-2**], he was taken to an OSH for evaluation and found to have an intracranial lesion on head CT.
BPH 3.

Altered mental status: CSF analysis at OSH demonstrated protein of 75 with [**Hospital1 18**] LP with CSF of 65 concerning for HSV encephalitis.
Leptomeningeal spread of malignancy was also considered, with CSF cytology non-diagnostic and MRI without significant findings.
HSV PCR on the CSF as well as all other culture data was negative (though other viral PCR/cultures were not done).
We decided not to re-LP to perform further studies as the risks outweighed the benefits, his mental status had cleared, and it would unlikely change the treatment plan.
The patient was also found to be hyponatremic to 121 during his admission, which was may have contributed to his altered mental status and he had adrenal insufficiency which could have contributed as well.
EEG was done which did not show evidence of seizure, but did show possible subcortical dysfunction within the right temporal lobe.
Hyponatremia: Patient came in with sodium of 121 and the differential diagnosis included SIADH and adrenal insufficiency.
Random cortisol was low (0.3) and urine sodium was high.
We treated him with fluid restriction of 1L day and his sodium cam up to 130, then we changed this to 2L day so he would not become dehydrated at home and his sodium returned to a normal range.
On admission, his serum cortisol was below assay.
Medications on Admission: OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS: Dexamethasone taper since [**12-4**], stopped [**2174-1-10**] Atorvastatin Finasteride Levetiracetam 1g [**Hospital1 **] Lorazepam 1mg q6-8h prn Prochlorperazine 10mg 1 hour prior to radiotherapy Ranitidine 150mg [**Hospital1 **] Tamsulosin 0.8mg daily Azithromycin to have been completed [**1-15**] pet OMR .
