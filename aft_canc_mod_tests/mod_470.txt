Routine blood work revealed the hypokalemia and she was referred into the ED this afternoon for further treatment.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.8, HR 96, BP 96/60, RR 16, O2sat 100%.
Electrolyte abnormalities included K 2.1 and Mg 2.0 for which she received 40 mEq IV KCl and 2 gm IV magnesium sulfate as well as an additional 3L IV NSS.
EKG was without QTc or U waves.
SBP's were 85-low 90's.
Vitals on transfer were T 98.0 HR 90 BP 90/60 RR 16 Sats 100% on RA.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-1-13**], probably no major change but the technically suboptimal nature of the present study precludes definitive comparison.
Pt does have a history of a small pericardial effusion and low voltage on EKG in the ED, although no other overt signs of tamponade.
TTE was obtained and showed a small pericardial effusion and no signs of tamponade.
IVF resuscitation was continued overnight with an additional 2L overnight in addition to the 3L the patient received in the ED, with improvement in her blood pressures to 100's to 110's systolic, which remained stable during her hospitalization.
* Bacteremia - On the day of admission, had blood culture drawn that returned positive for enterococcus and GNR, which were later identified as Enterobacteria.
TTE was negative for vegetations.
She refused a CT scan in the hospital for further work up her bacteremia.
Outpatient Labs to be checked Mon [**2113-5-1**] and sent to Dr.[**Name (NI) 13339**] office.
She will need chem panels checked at home on Monday by VNA after discharge to ensure stability.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressures and low potassium.
Your blood cultures returned positive for bacteria and you were started on 2 IV anitbioics.
