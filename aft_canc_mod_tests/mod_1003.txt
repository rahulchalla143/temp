Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2204-11-30**], severe right ventricular pressure and volume overload with marked ventricular interaction are now present.
[**12-14**] Bilateral LENIs: IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with deep vein thrombosis within the Preliminary Reportbilateral popliteal and posterior tibial veins and right peroneal vein.
Upon admission, he was sent immediately to radiology for CT chest, and at that time was feeling dyspneic but was in no distress.
On arrival, chest compressions had been started.
He was given 2 rounds of Epi 1mg with ~ 10mins of CPR, with recovery of pulse.
On arrival to the ICU, VS were Temp 96.0 HR 104 BP 118/64 RR 23 O2 sat 67%.
Vent settings CMV FiO2 100% Tv 550 RR 20 PEEP 5.
He was given 2 amps of bicarb, 1 calcium gluconate, and 1mg Epi with return of pulse.
Bedside echo was performed and showed right sided volume overload with underfilling of LV.
Bedside bronchoscopy was performed and showed severe extrinsic compression of left bronchus from known hilar mass, but there were no secretions or mucous plugs.
He was aggressively resuscitated with IV fluids and phenylephrine and norepinephrine were started to help support blood pressures.
Formal echo confirmed rigth heart strain with under filling of the left ventricle, and bilateral DVTs were found on LENIs.
