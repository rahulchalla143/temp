PRIOR STUDIES: CT of the head done on [**2138-4-7**].
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head was performed without and with IV contrast.
There is a 1.7 x 1.6 cm round focus of increased signal on the FLAIR, with enhancement on the post-contrast images in the left parapharyngeal space, which corresponds to an abnormally enlarged lymph node, on correlation with the CT angiogram performed on the same day (series 9, image 1), however, this is not completely included on our present study.

GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN  HISTORY: Status post resection of right parietal mass.
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained pre- and post-gadolinium administration.
COMPARISON STUDY: MR scan of the brain from [**2138-4-8**].
A staging CT of the torso was obtained which showed metastasis to the lungs, left hilum, and spine.
He was hydrated with bicarb fluids and given Mucomyst for renal protection prior to the CT scans.
A WAND study was obtained for image guidance of the resection.
He was taken to the OR for resection of the brain mass on HD#5.
