Patient was in her prior state of health until [**2176-9-5**] when his PCP noted [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 15-pound weight loss.
TSH, CBC, mammogram and remaining of work up was unreveiling.
In the [**Hospital1 1388**] ER her pain [**4-14**], Temp 98.6 F, HR 104 BPM, BP 143/117 mmHg, RR 16 X', 94% on RA, FBS 192 (orthostatics not done).
Her ECG showed lateral ST-depressions.
She could not undergo CT scan until more sedated with medications described above.
Her CT head was negative for acute pathology and her CT neck showed extensive DJD with canal narrowing.
Her labs came back and she had a HCT of 23 from baseline of 36 ([**2176-9-5**]) with 14 WBC and 571 PLTs (85% PMNs, L12).Her CK was 500 with MB of 14 and Trop T of 0.19.
Her BMP was significant for sodium of 132, gap of 18, CO2 of 23, glucose of 179 with creatinine of 1.0 and BUN of 30.
She became transtiently hypotensive with SBP in 80s and received IVF.
Her NGT showed bile and was guaiac negative.
Her rectal exam was normal and guaiac negative.
Her repeat HCT after fluids was 18 from 23.
She was seen by trauma surgery who recommended admission to MICU for monitoring given negative RP-bleed, guaiac negative stool and NG-lavage.
In the ER to look for RP bleed she underwent non-con CT, which showed diffuse nodularity of the stomach, concerning for neoplasm, involving the retroperitoneum, eroding L2 and possibly infiltrating the spinal canal.
She then underwent a contrast CT, which showed soft tissue mass medial to L kidney, thickened gastric mucosa and lytic lesions in sacrum as well as stable pulmonary nodule.

[**2177-1-20**] CT head FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or evidence for acute vascular territorial infarction.
[**2177-1-20**] CT C-spine  1.
If there is concern for cord injury, MRI would be more sensitive for this evaluation.
Ultrasound could be performed on a non-emergent basis for further evaluation if clinically indicated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
CXR [**1-21**] Study demonstrates slight progression of the pulmonary edema, currently interstitial, with some degree of alveolar edema towards the lung bases in combination with bilateral pleural effusions and might be consistent with volume overload.
The small focal consolidations seen on the CT abdomen from [**2177-1-20**] are not visible on the current radiograph.
# Anemia: Hematocrit on presentation 23.7 down from 36 in [**2176-9-5**].
After EGD, her Hct remained stable.
# Abdominal Mass: CT abdomen on presentation was significant for nodular thickening of the stomach, a retroperitoneal mass with vertebral involvement, and bony lesions concerning for metastasis.
It was felt that EGD with biopsy was the easiest method to obtain tissue for diagnosis so GI was consulted.
EGD revealed multiple submucosal masses in the fundus and body of the stomach.
Biopsies were taken and consistent with High Grade lymphoma.
# Elevated cardiac biomarkers: On presentation the patient was noted to have a troponin T of 0.19 in the setting of hypotension in the ED.
Transthoracic ECHO showed normal wall motion and preserved EF.
Serial CXRs revealed small bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.
UA was obtained which revealed postive leuk esterase and nitrite.
Had 4 WBC and few bacteria.
CT head was negative for intracranial hemorrhage.
CT C spine negative for acute fracture.
There was no evidence of infection on evaluation, acute MI felt to be unlikely given absence of chest pain and wall motion abnormalities, and no evidence for seizures or focal neurological deficit.
# Hypercalcemia: Patient noted to be hypercalcemic on presentation with a corrected calcium of 11.
Labs were discontinued when goals of care were changed.
# Acute renal failure: Patient's creatinine was elevated to 1.0, up from her prior baseline of 0.6.
Her creatinine returned to baseline with hydration and transfusion.
# Hyponatremia: Serum sodium 132 on admission.
An x-ray during the work-up of your bleeding showed a mass in your abdomen, which was determined to be high grade B cell lymphoma.
During discussions with the oncology team, you and your family, it was decided to focus on your comfort and not pursue invasive or curative treatment for your lymphoma.
