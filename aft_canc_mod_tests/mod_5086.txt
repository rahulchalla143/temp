Cardiac catheterization [**2163-1-12**] 2.
BNP on admission was 1000, up from 600 during previous admission for pneumonia.
She was noted to have a Cr of 1.4 on admission, which rose to 4.8 with diuresis.
ID and heme/onc consultations were obtained for leukocytosis 19 with left shift.
She developed severe respiratory distress, was intubated, had then noted to have new inferiorlateral ST depressions on her EKG (I and aVL and V6) then goes to cath lab where they find 90% LM, 70% RCA, but no interventions were performed.
Last 2 checks were clear.
LUNGS: intubated, anterior lung exam revealed no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
EXTREMITIES: cold, clamy, faintly palpable DP and PT pulses b/l NEURO: sedated but arousable, able to squeeze with both hands and move both feet to command .
PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: 97.9 89 139/46 20 98% on 2L GENERAL: awake, in NAD, AOx2 HEENT: NCAT.
Grad [**11-26**] ejection systolic murmur, loudest in RUSB.
LUNGS: anterior lung exam revealed some crackles in bases, but no wheezes or rhonchi.
EXTREMITIES: faintly palpable DP and PT pulses b/l NEURO: Patient AOX2, but still appears very weak.

TTE [**2163-1-9**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to akinesis of the septum and hypokinesis of the anterior free wall, inferior free wall, and lateral wall.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Renal Ultrasound [**2163-1-9**]: IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.
No change from a CT in [**2160-1-20**].
CARDIAC CATH [**2163-1-12**] COMMENTS: 1.
CT head [**1-15**] IMPRESSION: 1.
An MR may be obtained for further evaluation.
MRI head [**2163-1-16**] IMPRESSION: 1.
CXR [**2163-1-19**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-18**], the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
Carotid Ultrasound [**2163-1-20**] Impression: Right ICA 70-79% stenosis.
Active Diagnoses: # CAD: Cardiac cath showed 90% LM, 70% RCA lesion, no intervention was performed initially.
Initial EKG at OSH showed severe STE in I and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depressions in lateral leads.
Repeat EKG on transfer looked improved although still with STE in I and [**First Name3 (LF) **].
CT surgery consultation believed patient was too high risk to take for CABG, due to multiple comorbidities.
Thus, patient was taken to cardiac cath and DES were placed in left main and RCA.
Patient was previously hospitalized a week prior to this current presentation for pneumonia (unclear course), discharged, and repeat CXR on admission looks like worsened pneumonia/CHF.
She was transferred intubated, sedated on CMV 400 x 14 50% FiO2.
CT head was obtained that showed question of ischemic injury in watershed zone between left MCA/PCA territories.
A MRI brain was obtained that showed no such infarction, but small areas of acute ischemia in the left frontal lobe.
Neurology recommended obtaining a carotid duplex for further evaluation of the acute ischemia.
OSH work-up revealed that patient may have renal artery stenosis as evidenced by atrophic kidney (however, this could just be from CKD)and elevated renin and aldosterone.
PPD was confirmed negative.
Now, WBC 37.7 with 6% bands points to infectious etiology.
Platelet count trended down with treatment of infection, indicating a probably reactive etiology as well.
Plt count on discharge 540k.
Heparin gtt was discontinued when INR was 2.5.
Goal INR [**12-24**].
You also had a test that was positive for a JAK2 mutation, which is often found in myeloproliferative disorders.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
