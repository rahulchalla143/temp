Admission Date:  [**2180-9-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2180-10-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2109-8-6**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIAC CARE UNIT  ADDENDUM:  RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray on [**2180-10-17**]: No pneumothorax.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound:  The liver has a homogeneous echotexture and contains two small echogenic lesions, both of which are in the right lobe.
Impression:  Normal appearing gallbladder given the patient's fasting state without evidence of cholelithiasis, small hemangioma ....................  CT of the abdomen and pelvis:  Impression:  1.
This pattern is persistent since the last CT examination and raises the possibility of colitis, infectious, ischemic, or inflammatory.
CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis:  Impression:  1.
Follow-up study suggested.
Echocardiogram on [**2180-9-11**]:  Conclusions:  1.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is very difficult to assess but is probably moderately depressed.
Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
Ejection fraction 20-25%.
Echocardiogram on [**2180-9-5**]:  Conclusions:  1.
Mild 1+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] pericardial effusion.
Blood cultures and cultures from site resulted in MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus).
The patient's blood cultures grew back fungemia with evidence of yeast in the blood.
Over time, the patient's total body edema decreased, the patient was able to be stabilized on breathing room air with 100% saturations and good stabilization of heart rate and blood pressure.
PULMONARY:  The patient was noted to have bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis on the chest x-ray and appreciated on the examination.
It was likely secondary to the patient's recent thoracotomy that he underwent prior to admission to our service.
With aggressive diuresis for volume status and continued respiratory support, the patient's lung examination improved with improvement and resolution of effusions.
RENAL:  The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.5 to 1.9.
The patient's creatinine waxed and waned with milrinone therapy with eventually stabilization of creatinine from 1.5 to 1.7.
OPHTHALMOLOGY:  The patient had an eye examination due to treatment of yeast infection with fluconazole.
Would also recommend that he have a repeat echocardiogram in three months.
