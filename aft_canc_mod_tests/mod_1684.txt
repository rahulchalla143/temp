Admission Date:  [**2145-3-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-3-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-8-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 31685**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital3 **] for EUS biopsy of GI mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: colonoscopy, endoscopy with fine needle aspiration of gastric mass   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 31686**] is a 62M with h/o CAD and 3-vessel CABG who presented to PCP for routine [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] and was noted to be pale with skin bruises on his right arm and left leg and was found to have a HCT of 21.
He underwent an EGD, which showed a polypoid submucosal mass in the gastric antrum which was biopsied.
A second EGD was performed on [**2145-3-8**], which showed blood in the stomach but no obvious source of bleeding.
Additional work up included an MRI of the right upper extremity which showed complex multiseptated mass in the right medial arm measured 7.7 x 7.2 x 14.7 cm.
CT scan showed nodular pleural based thickening and a small pleural effusions right more than left.
Oncology consult was obtained and transfer to the [**Hospital1 **] was recommeded for further work-up of these masses.
On arrival to the ICU, vitals 98.0 75 98/37 52 97% RA.
Pt was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and bone marrow biopsy performed.
Serial Hcts were checked, and the patient was transfused 1U of PRBCs for a goal of >27 given the EGD results at the OSH which showed blood in the stomach.
The patient's Hct increased appropriately after blood transfusion and counts remained stable.
He underwent various testing for further evaluation of his upper and lower extremity swelling including upper and lower extremity dopplers which were negative for DVT.

Venous U/S [**2145-3-10**]: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right upper extremity.
Left Lower Extremity Venous U/S [**2145-3-10**]: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower extremity  CT COLONOGRAPHY [**2145-3-12**]: This exam is extremely limited due to the suboptimal bowel prep, poor insufflation of air due to sigmoid stricture.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
# Gastric Mass: Patient underwent EGD with biopsy at outside hospital that demonstrated normal gastric mucosa.
He had a EGD for the purpose of EUS guided biopsy at [**Hospital1 18**] however no biopsy taken given patient's unclear coagulopathy.
A CTA/CTV here demonstrated a non-invasive submucosal mass.
Bone marrow biopsy was done to rule out lymphoma and was negative for hematologic malignancy.
# Right lower quadrant mass:  CT showed a vaguely defined soft tissue mass in the right lower quadrant with extensive tethering of small bowel loops.
Given the suspicion for carcinoid, chromogrannin A, serotonin, 5-HIAA were all sent and were normal.
Colonoscopy done for further evaluation was suboptimal because of partial stricture in the sigmoid.
Virtual colonoscopy done for follow-up was also a less than ideal study but was suggestive of a fluid collection near the mass.
# Right Upper Extremity Mass vs Hematoma: Patient had MRI of RUE at OSH that showed a possible mass versus hematoma.
A RUE extremity ultrasound showed a 14 x 4 x 7 likely hematoma.
Work-up of coagulopathy including PT/PTT, platelets, euglobulin lysis time, platelet activator inhibitor activity, plasminogen activator, were normal.
# Shrunken Liver/Splenomegaly: These symptoms coupled with finding of gastric varices of EGD were suggestive of chronic liver disease.
Given that the murmur was new/changed, a repeat echo was done which confirmed aortic insufficiency with no other significant changes.
You had a colonoscopy and an endoscopy with biopsy.
You may need a biopsy in the future.
Followup Instructions: Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 5452**] office to arrange follow-up:  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 31689**] You will need an MRI of your arm and a PET CT that Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will arrange.
