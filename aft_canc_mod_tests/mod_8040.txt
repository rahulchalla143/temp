He was treated initially with Vancomycin, Ceftazidime and Levofloxacin and later switched to Oxacillin and Levofloxacin when sensitivities revealed that his organisms were sensitive to these medications.
When cultures remained negative over 48 hours, those antibiotics were discontinued.
However, on [**6-4**], the patient spiked a temperature to 102.0 F.  Cultures were sent by Venipuncture and off of his central line.
Liver functions were checked and these were mildly elevated.
An abdominal ultrasound was obtained which was mainly negative.
Surveillance cultures were checked and remained mainly negative with the exception of one set of blood cultures taken off of the patient's central line which grew Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative, felt to be a contaminant, given no other blood cultures grew this.
An arterial blood gas was consistent with respiratory alkalosis and chest x-ray was negative.
A VQ scan was obtained which revealed a pulmonary embolism.
Although the study was poor, the patient was felt to be high probability for pulmonary embolism and he was treated with heparin.
An abdominal x-ray was obtained which revealed a partial small bowel obstruction versus ileus.
Repeat abdominal x-ray showed resolution of his small bowel obstruction/ileus.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  When initially transferred to the Medical Service, the patient was hypernatremic.
At the time of this dictation, his hyponatremia and hypernatremia are both controlled and he has normal natremic and continues to receive TPN.
Abdominal ultrasound:  Which revealed a simple cyst in the liver and a small amount of pleural effusion on the right (please see full report).
CT scan of the neck on [**2192-6-5**]:  Revealed a filling defect in the right internal jugular vein consistent with non-occlusive thrombus and a left subclavian line which was felt to be coiled upon itself.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2192-5-19**]:  Full transit of oral contrast through the GI tract; not unchanged from the [**5-18**] CT scan of the abdomen which revealed no evidence for pulmonary embolism in the main pulmonary arteries and intussusception and small bowel obstruction.
Echocardiogram on [**2192-5-18**], ejection fraction greater than 55%, left atrium moderately dilated; left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function normal; an left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%; right ventricular cavity dilated, right ventricular systolic function appears depressed; aortic root moderately dilated.
