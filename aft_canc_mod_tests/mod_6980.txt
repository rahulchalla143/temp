Te patient was seen by the orthopedic service [**2195-9-25**], and a knee x-ray was taken, which was within normal limits.
A repeat x-ray was taken [**2195-11-23**], with a small effusion noted.
Laboratories were drawn at that time with blood cultures, the blood cultures grew gram positive cocci in pairs and chains, in two separate bottles.
The patient's white blood cell count was 16.8 and her ESR was 96.
Of note, the patient had developed a heart rate to the 140s, noted to be atrial flutter.
She received Cardizem 5 mg intravenously with a decrease in her heart rate to the 70s and a decrease in her systolic blood pressure to 62.
The Dopamine drip was discontinued and her blood pressure correspondingly fell to 69 systolic.
She continued to receive normal saline boluses and Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure which was subsequently weaned in several days after admission.
The patient continued to have episodes of atrial flutter requiring Diltiazem boluses intravenously as needed, however, she had a tendency to drop her blood pressure with this medication.
A chest x-ray was performed which was consistent with congestive heart failure.
While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, a transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated no vegetation of the valves, and left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 65%, mild to moderate aortic regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation.
On [**2195-11-27**], the patient had two more episodes of supraventricular tachycardia of which she was asymptomatic with no decrease in her blood pressure.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was eventually performed to rule out valvular endocarditis which was significant for a vegetation demonstrated of her native aortic valve.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER:  Vital signs revealed temperature 100.8, blood pressure 148/70, heart rate 130, oxygen saturation 98% on two liters.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination is normocephalic and atraumatic.
LABORATORY DATA ON TRANSFER:  White blood cell count 12.5, hematocrit 28.0, platelet count 232,000.
Sodium 141, potassium 3.6, chloride 107, bicarbonate 26, blood urea nitrogen 8, creatinine 0.7, glucose 104.
Calcium 7.7, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus 2.1.
Right knee, three views, plain films obtained [**2195-11-23**], which demonstrated small joint effusion, no fracture was identified.
A portable chest x-ray on [**2195-11-24**], demonstrated no radiographic evidence of acute pulmonary or cardiac disease processes.
A chest x-ray on [**2195-11-29**], demonstrated small pleural effusions bilaterally, unchanged from the prior radiograph.
CT angiogram on [**2195-12-2**], was preliminarily negative for pulmonary embolus.
The pleural effusions noted on chest x-ray were also evident.
The fluid culture resulted in no growth.
The joint fluid analysis demonstrated 5,480 white blood cells, 945 red blood cells, 94 polys, 4 lymphocytes, 2 monocytes and no joint crystals.
Two separate blood cultures from [**2195-11-24**], demonstrated nutritionally variant Streptococcus sensitive to Clindamycin, Gentamicin, Penicillin and Vancomycin.
Urine culture on [**2195-11-24**], and [**2195-11-25**], were negative for growth.
Two blood cultures drawn on [**2195-11-25**], were negative for growth.
Two blood cultures on [**2195-11-27**], were negative for growth.
Electrocardiogram on [**2195-11-25**], demonstrated recurrent supraventricular tachycardia with a rapid rate of 171.
Electrocardiogram performed on [**2195-11-27**], demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response with occasional ventricular premature beats.
Compared to the previous electrocardiogram on [**2195-11-26**], this atrial fibrillation was new.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2195-11-26**], demonstrated left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, mild aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation, trivial tricuspid regurgitation, and physiologic pulmonic regurgitation.
A transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2195-11-27**], demonstrated a left ventricular systolic function which was normal, left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%.
Electrocardiogram performed on [**2195-11-30**], demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions.
The premature ventricular contractions were new compared to the prior tracing.
Her initial blood pressure support medication was Dopamine, however, her rhythm did not tolerate this as she went into supraventricular tachycardia.
Upon arrival to the medical floor, the patient's blood pressure remained stable between 110 to 140 systolic.
Her blood pressure tolerated this medication well, she had lowest systolic blood pressure of 100 during this episode.
Infectious disease - The patient was originally referred to the Emergency Department for blood cultures positive for gram positive cocci in pairs and chains.
Blood cultures were obtained in the Emergency Department on [**2195-11-24**], which demonstrated Streptococcus-nutritional variant, sensitivities as above.
While on the Penicillin, the patient will need weekly complete blood count and liver function tests.
Two sets of blood cultures will be required two weeks after completing the antibiotics and the patient's knee will need to be reevaluated at that point.
A repeat echocardiogram should be considered to check for valvular vegetations at this time as well.
While admitted, she has required supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations greater than 93%.
A chest x-ray was obtained on [**2195-11-30**], which was not significant for congestive heart failure or infiltrates.
Considering her chest x-ray and clinical examination is somewhat consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure as the etiology for the increasing oxygen requirement, a CT angiogram of the chest was obtained on [**2195-12-2**].
Preliminary report from this study resulted in no evidence of pulmonary thrombi.
The patient's cardiopulmonary status will need continual assessment at the rehabilitation facility.
There should be a low threshold for obtaining a repeat echocardiogram if she becomes short of breath and a chest x-ray is consistent with congestive heart failure to rule out valvular dysfunction.
Hematologic - The patient's hematocrit was 29.8 on admission.
It is unclear why she had anemia as her baseline hematocrit was 41.9 on [**2195-6-30**].
Her hematocrit remained stable, however, during admission with the lowest value of 26.0 on [**2195-12-1**].
She received one unit of packed red blood cells with an appropriate increase in her hematocrit to 30.0.
While on Penicillin, the patient should have weekly complete blood count as noted above.
Secondary to the patient's history of coronary artery disease, the threshold for transfusion is hematocrit of less than 28.0.
three times a day, hold for systolic blood pressure less than 100.
four times a day, hold for heart rate less than 65 and systolic blood pressure less than 105.
The patient will require q.Monday, Wednesday, Friday creatinine levels and Gentamicin peak/trough levels.
The patient will also require weekly complete blood count and liver function tests while on Penicillin.
The patient will also require two sets of blood cultures to be obtained two weeks after completing her antibiotics.
She will need an evaluation of her right knee at that time to determine persistent effusions and a repeat tap of that knee will be decided at that time.
She will also require a repeat echocardiogram after the antibiotics have completed to check for persistent valvular vegetation and valvular dysfunction.
