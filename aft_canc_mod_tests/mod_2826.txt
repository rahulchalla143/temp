On presentation to the emergency department her vital signs were HR to the 150s, BP dropped from 157/63 to 90/50, Hco3 19, lactate 3.7.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis were significant for no air in the soft tissues and both consult services agreed with medical management and close observation.
The patient was aggressively hydrated with 2L NS with improvement in her BP and Vancomycin 1 gram, Cefepime 2grams and Clindamycin 600mg were administered intravenously in the ED.
Physical Exam: T=103.9, HR 118, BP 92/43, RR 18, O2 sat 100% on RA Gen- non-toxic appearing HEENT-PERRLA, EOMI, sclera anicteric, OP clear Neck- no LAD, JVP est < 5 cm H2O Chest- slight decreased breath sounds at the left base.
L port C/D/I CV- tachycardic, regular, normal s1 and s2, no s3 or s4.

MRI pelvis [**5-13**]: 1.
Bilateral iliac lymphadenopathy, left greater than the right.
Brief Hospital Course: 1.  vulvitis - Pt was initially admitted to the intensive care unit, and the sepsis protocol was activated.
She was volume resucitated with 5LNS with improvement in tachycardia and blood pressure.
Two out of four blood cultures (both from the P-AC) were positive for E. coli, and pt was placed on broad antibiotics.
CT scan showed no evidence of fasciitis or abscess.
As there was further concern per surgery team to rule out abscess or fasciitis, an MRI was also performed, which showed neither of these processes.
Swabs of the area sent for VZV cultures are thus far negative.
It was thought unlikely that the area of necrosis/ulceration was due to lymphoma, given the results of the imaging studies, as above.
3.  supraventricular tachycardia - While in the MICU, pt's course was complicated by runs of SVT consistent with AVNRT, requiring adenosine to terminate the rhythm and initiation of metoprolol.
4.  hypertension - Pt's BP was in the 130s-140s, even with metoprolol.
This should be followed for further blood pressure control.
Electrolytes were repleted as needed, notably potassium.
