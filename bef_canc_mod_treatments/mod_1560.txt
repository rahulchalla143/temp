Hemoptysis:  It is very likely that cause of patient's hemoptysis was a consequence of recent stent removal that he had not too long ago.
Likely the patient might have had a mucosal tear as a consequence of the removal or some mucosal irritation.
Lovenox and Coumadin were held overnight for procedure.
Patient was started on piperacillin, tazobactam, and gentamicin for negative rods seen on bronchoalveolar lavage.
Patient was subsequently started on Vicodin to inhibit cough and allow the mucosal linings of the bronchus to heal.
Hypoxia:  The following day after admission the patient was noted to have a seizure with development of chest pain, tachypnea, shortness of breath with sats dropping to 85% on nasal cannula.
Patient was changed to face mask then without success, and then changed to a nonrebreather.
His oxygen requirement was increased to 2 liters on nonrebreather with improvement of oxygen saturations to 90%.
Patient's chest pain subsided with sublingual nitroglycerin but developed pleuritic chest pain and continued to desat while talking.
Patient was intubated and placed on mechanical intubation to maintain good oxygen saturation.
MICU stay was complicated by hypotension and oliguria which were treated with fluids and pressors.
The patient's status improved by days 2 and 3 of MICU admission, eliminating the need for pressors and subsequently extubating patient once procedures were done from the Pulmonary team.
Patient was extubated with good maintenance of saturations and subsequently transferred to the Medicine floor.
Pain:  Patient was continued on his outpatient regimen with good results.
Gout:  Patient was continued on his Allopurinol without any acute flares in house.
Phenytoin levels were checked everyday, and Dilantin was adjusted to keep patient at therapeutic levels.

Patient was continued on Prednisone in house and once transferred to the MICU was converted to an equal dose of hydrocortisone.
Patient was initially started on piperacillin, tazobactam, and gentamicin for treatment with a notable reduction of white blood cell counts and back to normal after two days of treatment.
Sensitivities at that time were pending and subsequently antibiotic regimen was changed to Ciprofloxacin and Cefuroxime which adequately covered both organisms, Pseudomonas and staph aureus.
