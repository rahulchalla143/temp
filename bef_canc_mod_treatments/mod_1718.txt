C2-3 flexion-distraction with comminuted fractures of posterior C2 body and bilateral transverse processes ("hangman's fracture").
Due to involvementof the transverse foramina, CT angiography should be considered because of the potential for vertebral artery injury.
Bilateral preseptal hemorrhages and right retroorbital fat stranding suggesting contusion with suspected hemorrhage.
Uncomplicated splenic arteriogram with coil and Gelfoam embolization of the upper pole branch distribution.
Further treatment will be attempted at a later time when the patient stabilizes  [**2184-1-15**]:  car./[**Last Name (un) **].
Further treatment will be attempted at a later time when the patient stabilizes.
[**2184-1-21**]: x-ray of c-spine:  FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube and temperature probe are present.
Surgical instrument is seen within the anterior disc space of C2-C3.
Subsequently ACDF of C2-C3 with anterior instrumentation at intervertebral cage.
[**2184-1-22**]: chest x-ray:  FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-21**], there is little overall change.
Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
[**2184-1-24**]: chest x-ray:  FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated.
[**2184-1-25**]:  chest x-ray:  FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a tracheostomy tube.
After splenectomy, free intra-abdominal air is now visible under the right hemidiaphragm  [**2184-1-27**]:  ct of the head:  IMPRESSION: 1.
Fracture lines involving the body of C2 extending to the bilateral transverse processes, compatible with a "Hangman's fracture" are still evident though the previously noted distraction of C2 on C3 is improved status post anterior C2-C3 fusion with intervertebral disc spacer placement.
Systems based hospital course as follows:  INJURIES: - bilateral comminuted mandibular fx (OMFS non-operative) - basilar skull fx (non-operative) - L squamous temporal bone fx (non-operative) - Post C2 body fx w/ C2-3 flex-distraction (s/p ant fusion ortho-spine) - bilat preseptal hemorrhage (s/p neuro IR coiling/optho following/stable IOP) - tiny bilateral PTX (stable) - splenic injury (s/p splenectomy) - bilat anterior acetabular fx (stable, WB as tol) - R inferior pubic ramus fx (stable, WB as tol) - laceration x2 R anterior shin/knee (stable, WB as tol) - Shallow impaction fx ant tibial cortex (stable, WB as tol) - RLL contusion (stable, WB as tol)  Neuro: Patient was intubated in trauma bay for altered mental status.
Sedation was administered as needed for patient comfort.
Followed commands when sedation lightened throughout.
Methadone was started [**1-25**] in combination w dilaudid combination long/short acting analgesia.
[**1-15**] patient went to neuro IR for embolization of carotid-cavernous fistula.
Neurosurgery cleared patient for c-spine repair [**1-18**].
Repair was initially deferred secondary to presumed pulmonary infection and hesitance to insert ortho spine hardware in setting of active infection.
[**1-21**] patient went to OR with ortho spine for C2-3 anterior fusion w/ iliac BG and halo application.
CV: Patient was resuscitated per trauma protocol with adequate/appropriate response.
Noted to have small B/L PTX though chest tubes not required.
Patient proceeded to decompensate from respiratory standpoint [**1-24**] requiring urgent nasotracheal intubation (given halo).
[**1-26**] patient weaned off of ventilatory support.
[**1-27**] tolerated trach mask throughout day.
Adequate hemostasis required coil/gel foam embolization multiple splenic branches.
Given likelihood of subsequent splenic infarct patient was taken to OR for splenectomy [**1-15**].
Patient tolerated this well and was brought to TSICU for further management intubated/sedated.
Patient was given IV fluids on arrival per trauma resuscitation protocol.
She was also started on a bowel regimen [**1-16**] to encourage bowel movement.
Foley was placed as part of trauma evaluation.
Tylenol and cooling measures were initiated.
4+GNR on sputum were found on gram stain and cipro/zosyn started for antipseudomonal coverage.
[**1-18**] abx were changed to Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for broad coverage on PNA.
Bronchs were repeated as needed with specimens sent accordingly.
Nystatin was started [**1-22**].
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
HEME: Patient required massive transfusion protocol initiation at time of arrival for hypotension.
[**1-26**] central line and a-line d/c'd with expectation that patient would go to floor [**1-27**].
She was evaluated for placement of a speaking valve in hopes of allowing her to speak and to assess her ability to manage her secretions.
She was reported to have severe coughing with the cuff deflated and recommendations made to down-size trach tube before attempts made to allow oral intake.
Her trach tube was down-sized to a #7 non-cuffed fenestrated trach tube on [**1-30**].
Tube feedings continued as per order.
A Sheily speaking valve was placed and patient was able to vocalize.
She will need to be evaluated again by Speech/Swallow prior to increasing her diet (see note Speech/Swallow)  The patient was found to be making good progress with ambulation, and balance, but continues to have require trach care and tube feedings and for this reason was evaluated for a rehabilitation facility where she can further regain her strength and mobility.
She did receive her post-splenectomy vaccines on [**2184-1-30**]  Of note:  she will need follow-up for repeat angio on [**2-9**].

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive( pt has trach) Activity Status: non-op pelvic fx WBAT; Spine-s/p C2-3 fusion with Halo   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after you were involved in a motor vehicle accident in which you sustained a cervical spine fracture, facial fracture, and a laceration to your spleen.
To stabilize your cervical spine, you had a bone graft and halo brace for additional stability.
Because of your injuries and your neck instability, you had a trach performed and a feeding tube placed for nutrition.
