She initially got ceftriaxone and azithromycin as well as several liters of intravenous fluids.
She was to be placed on a sepsis protocol, however, had catheterization of the right internal carotid artery during central line placement of an internal jugular.
Vascular surgery was then called because of patient's respiratory difficulty and internal carotid catheterization she was intubated.
Subsequently a femoral line as placed for intravenous access.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2144**] as well as [**2149-2-14**] sent.
MEDICATIONS:  Include Zoloft 40, metoprolol 100 b.i.d., Norvasc 2.5 b.i.d., Lisinopril 5 once a day, Zoloft 50 once a day, imipramine 25 once a day, aspirin 325, ipratropium MDI, Lasix 20 once a day, Levothyroxine 25 mcg which patient may not be taking.
However, she was not placed on sepsis protocol.
She was given aggressive intravenous fluid hydration initially over 10 liters.
An arterial line was placed and patient was slowly weaned off pressors.
Her antibiotics were changed to Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin.
Pulmonary:  Patient was initially intubated to facilitate line removal as well as because of some moderate respiratory distress.
However, she had some difficulty weaning off the ventilator, some difficulty with oxygenation and experienced some auto PEEP and elevated pips.
It was felt that given her past medical history she may have an element of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with reactive airway disease and was given intravenous steroids with standing nebs with much improvement in her arterial blood gases and ventilation.
She did not relay a history of diarrhea prior to intubation and she did no9t have evidence of renal failure.
She did receive aggressive fluid hydration which may contribute in part to this acidosis.
Cardiovascular:  Her blood pressure medications were held in light of her hypotension.
Her aspirin was restarted given her history of coronary artery disease and she had a transthoracic echocardiogram done that was difficult to read but appeared to have normal ejection fraction.
Her blood pressure medications will slowly be readded as tolerated.
Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  Nasogastric tube was placed and patient was placed on tube feeds.
Access:  Her femoral line was discontinued on day three and a PICC line was placed to avoid access complications.
