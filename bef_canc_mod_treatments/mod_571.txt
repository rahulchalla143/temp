RUQ U/S [**2191-2-20**]: IMPRESSION: Status post cholecystectomy without evidence for intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 78 year old man with Parkinson's disease, Atrial Fibrillation on anticoagulation (coumadin), with recent worsening in Parkinson's symptoms suspected due to improper administration of his own meds, and recent dyspnea on exersion.
# Parkinson's disease:  He was maintained on his outpatient Sinemet and Mirapex.
His PCP and wife were suspicious that he is no longer able to administer his own medications accurately.
A Neurology consult was obtained to comment on the possible etiologies of his gait difficulties, and whether they could be explained by medication nonadherence.
They felt his gait difficulties were likely multifactorial, with Parkinson's disease, cervical myelopathy, and possible [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia contributing, as well as improper administration of his parkinson's medications.
He has a history of significant worsening of his symptoms with nonadherence to medications and his cervical collar.
Therefore he was maintained on his outpatient parkinson's medications and discharged on these medications.
He was discharged to rehab for improved administration of these medications, and if patient returns home, his wife will likely need to take over administration of his medications.
Therefore patient underwent ERCP on [**2191-2-21**] that noted partial obstruction of common bile duct with 3 stones, stones unable to be removed, but stent placed for pus drainage noticed.
He was maintained on Zosyn throughout hospital course, but given the pan-sensitive bacteria, he was switched to levofloxacin on discharge to complete a 14 day course of antibiotics.
He then had some tenuos respiratory issues around the same time as his noted cholangitis, requiring nasal cannula oxygen for a short time period.
This was thought secondary to trans-abdominal fluid movement from his abdominal process.
As the cholangitis was treated as above, his respiratory issues and Oxygen requirement resolved and the patient no longer required supplemental oxygen.
Medication adjustments on discharge included restarting the patient's cozaar at 25mg QD, continuing lasix 20mg QD, adding spironolactone 25mg QD, discontinuing the patient's beta blocker (metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **]) and continuing his amiodarone 200mg QD.
He was kept on his aspirin dose 325mg QD.
# Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is on amiodarone and Coumadin as an outpatient.
The patient reached therapeutic values of his coumadin during hospital course, but then had his coumadin held and received FFP prior to his ERCP.
Coumadin remained held following the ERCP and discussions ensued regarding risk vs benefit of this patient being on coumadin for his atrial fibrillation given his fall risk.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] wanted an ECHO to assess heart function prior to making a decision of patient remaining on coumadin or not.
Given ECHO results above, it was decided to continue coumadin 4mg qhs, as patient will be in a controlled environment at rehab.
Long term coumadin administration will be addressed at a later time.
He otherwise had his amiodarone held during his acute LFT elevation, but this was restarted upon resolution of his cholangitis.
Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**], there is continued consideration of cardioversion in the future, once patient has a documented therapeutic INR for 1 month's time.
# Cervical myelopathy:  His myelopathy results in left leg weakness, contributing to his gait disturbances.
He was maintained on his outpatient oxybutynin and tamsulosin .
