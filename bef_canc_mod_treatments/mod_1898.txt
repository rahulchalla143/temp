Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 61 year old male with multiple ED visits and admissions for alcohol intoxication as well as withdrawal symptoms and DTs who presented with obtundation secondary to alcohol intoxication requiring intubation.
Active Problems: # Respiratory Distress: He was intubated for airway protection in the setting of acute alcohol intoxication and GCS <8.
# Alcohol intoxication/withdrawl: He had elevated alcohol levels (482) in the ED and was put on a CIWA scale for withdrawal symptoms.
He was also given thiamine, folic acid and MVI.
He was put on IV fluids and kept NPO initially.
Chronic Problems:  # Elevated LFTs: Had elevated LFTs in the setting of heavy alcohol use, but they were improved from previous.
# Hypotension: He had hypotension in the setting of intubation that was responsive to fluid and decreasing his sedation.
# Elevated lactate: Had elevated lactate to 3.1 which normalized with IV fluids.
