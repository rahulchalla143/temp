Brief Hospital Course: 51 year old male with COP on chronic prednisone, dCHF, COPD, DM, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, recent MICU admission for hypotension and [**Last Name (un) **] attributed to adrenal insufficiency now presenting with hypotension and [**Last Name (un) **].
He was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics in case the hypotension was from sepsis, but no infectious etiology found, so antibiotics stopped.
ALthough he insists on complete medical compliance, it is possible that this represented an adrenal crisis if he did not take his prednisone as prescribed.
He was given hydrocortisone IV q8 hours initially.
Another possibiliity is that he was overmedicated - on holding his prazosin, metoprolol, aldactone and lisinopril he was normotensive for many days on the medical floor.
Normalized to 1.2 after fluid resuscitateion.
On the day of discharge he was found to be 328 lbs, and was discharged on 120 mg po lasix daily, with instructions to increase his lasix if his weight were to increase by 3 lbs.
Given that he doesn't have known systolic heart failure, cardiology service agreed with holding aldactone and metoprolol.
ACE-I was continued given renoprotective effects with his diabetes.
PUlmonary service requested evaluation by thoracic surgery for VATS in order to make definitive diagnosis.
Thoracics felt that surgery would be very high risk in this patient with his multiple comorbidities, difficulty with intubation secondary to tracheomalacia and because he would need an thoracotomy for the procedure given his size.
Patient has known history of PE, but is off anticoagulation because he completed three months and had GI bleed.
The patient and I discussed this at length - on discharge his medication regimen was simplified as much as possible and his follow up appointments were consolidated as much as possible so as to reduce the need for multiple visits to [**Location (un) 86**].
I faxed his prescription list to [**Location (un) 57911**] Apothecary, and they will provide him with bubble packs of his meds  and group them into morning and evening doses.
We discussed his responsibility in working with VNA, taking medications and following dietary advice.
