In the MICU, pt was weaned off levophed (after only 5 hours) and started on ceftriaxone/azithro for presumed CAP as source of sepsis.

Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 78 y/o female with crohns disease on chronic steroids presenting with cough and fever.
Sepsis:  Pt's sepsis was likely secondary to pneumonia and mild element of adrenal insufficiency (in setting of chronic steroids for Crohn's disease) causing transient hypotensions requiring pressors esp given bandemia, infiltrate on CXR and rapid improvement with abx.
Pressors were discontinued soon after arrival to the ICU with the help of fluids, initiation of abx and steroids.
PCP was also considered given pt's immunosuppression but unlikely given an LDH of 194.
Pt was started on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for community acquired pneumonia.
She was given high dose steroids in the setting of her hypotension and these were weaned down to her home dose by the day of discharge.
She was continued on albuterol and atrovent nebs.
Pt was sent home on cefpodoxime and azithro for a total of a 10 day course.
Hypoxia: Pt required oxygen in the ICU but was never intubated.
She continued to desaturate to 87-89% on ambulation so she was discharged with home oxygen which she will use until she is able to maintain sats >92%.
DVT/ saddle embolus: Pt with subtherapeutic INR on admission likely secondary to missed coumadin doses during acute illness.
She was started on a heparin drip until her INR was therapeutic.
Pt's legs have chronically been swollen since her DVTs but she was given a few doses of lasix to aid in diuresis given the large amount fluid the pt received while she was hypotensive.
Fasting lipids were checked and a low dose statin was started for an LDL of 117.
Her beta blocker was titrated up as her BP would allow.
Crohn's: Pt's steroids were tapered down to home dose of 5mg [**Hospital1 **].
She was started on calcium and vitamin D given the chronic steroids.
