Suggestion of swirling of the mesentery and abnormal configuration of small bowel loops raises the possibility of internal hernia.
Bronchiectasis and reticulation could relate to chronic inflammatory/infectious changes within the bilateral lung bases.
Nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm.
Nasogastric tube has been inserted with its tip in the body of the stomach.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists in a patient with a dual-channel pacemaker device in place.
The nasogastric tube has been removed.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department on [**2115-12-30**] for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
In the emergency department, the patient was resuscitated, and a foley/NGT were placed with moderate relief of abdominal pain.

Cardiology also saw the patient and recommended restarting his home aggrenox and carvedilol when possible.
(The patient had been placed on IV lopressor while NPO).
[**2116-1-1**] The rest of his PACU stay was uneventful, and the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, NGT, and on tele.
He was receiving IV dilaudid for pain control, which was switched to IV morphine and toradol.
His narcotics were stopped and replaced with tylenol.
He was placed in soft restraints, and he was given haldol with minimal effect.
He was given lasix with good result.
His foley catheter was removed and replaced with a condom catheter.
NGT in place with good effect, still returned significant amounts of bilious gastric contents.
He was 8kg over his starting weight, so he was given lasix with good effect.
His staples were removed and steri strips applied.
Systems summary: Neuro: The patient received IV narcotics initially but was switched to tylenol only due to altered mental status.
Pulmonary: As discussed in the summary; intermittent doses of lasix for mild pulmonary edema; transfer to the unit for copious secretions, resolved with lasix.
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.
The wound dressing was removed on POD2 and the wound remained c/d/i.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
