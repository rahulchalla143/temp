According to my interview with the family, the nursing facility told them that on Monday he was drifting in and out of conversations and unable to articulate his needs in the usual fashion.
Started on vancomycin and cefepime after blood cultures, chose the abx based on past urine cultures.

Troponin elevated, but likely secondary to kidney injury, as Mb within normal limits.
Hypernatremia may be contributing somewhat to confusion.
Patient's family does not report any recent medication changes.
Pt has sterile pyuria on urine microscopy so was initially treated for a urinary tract infection with cefepime and vancomycin.
Pt's hypernatremia is likely the cause of his altered mental status and is likely from decreased access to free water in the setting of aggressive diuresis for sCHF.
We regularly reoriented patient, maintained sleep-wake cycle, and continued patient on home medications for dementia.
His Cr improved with fluid repletion and returned to baseline of 1.5 on day of discharge.
Initially he appeared dry on exam, likely in the setting of diuresis from heart failure.
He was given access to PO fluids.
# Sterile pyuria: Urinalysis showed pyuria, and in the setting of altered mental status was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.
Pt was initially put on vanc/cefepime which was stopped.
He was continued on home donepezil and ropinirole.
He was also continued on home citalopram.
# History of prostate cancer: Continue home finasteride.
# COPD: Continue home albuterol and ipratropium as needed.
We also initially held metoprolol in setting of possible sepsis.
We continued aspirin for CAD.
Metoprolol restarted.
# Glaucoma: Continue home brimonidine.
Torsemide will be halved in dose (from 20mg daily before admission to 10mg daily on discharge) to prevent hypovolemia.
Pt will continue voiding trial at rehab facility.
