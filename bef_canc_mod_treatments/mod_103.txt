Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known firstname 4317**] [**Known lastname **] is a very nice 84 year-old woman with chronic renal failure, colon cancer s/p resection, hypertension, and diastolic dysfunction with shortness of breath.
She was started on lasix 160 mg TID IV and diuresed 6 L. Furthermore, treatment was started with Vancomycin/Cefepime/Ciprofloxacin (Day 1 [**3-29**]).
Her oxygen requirements continued to worsen and her SpO2 dropped to mid 80s on 6 L NC and 75% high-flow.
GIven patient had been on steroids a short [**Doctor Last Name 2949**] of prednisone 60 mg and Bactrim was started to cover PCP while stains came back.
Once cultures negative and with no clear picture it was decided to give a 3-day burst of methylprednisolone 125 mg QID and then go down to slowly to 40 mg, which if she survives she should continue for 2-3 months with a very slow [**Doctor Last Name 2949**] for pneumonitis/AIP.
Her outpatient nephrologist thought there could be a small contribution of fluid and that diuresis could help with hypoxia, so recommended CVVH.
After extensive discussion, R pig-tail catheter was placed and pneumothorax resolved.
It was decided to continue high-dose steroids for any possible benefit.
She completed a course of antibiotics for pna.
Her vent was weaned to [**3-30**] for several days.
On [**2191-4-16**], she was successfully extubated and remained stable for several days without ventilation; however, her O2 saturations continually dropped into the 80s with movement and she required O2 by NC and by facetent.
On [**4-17**], she was reintubated for hypoxia and unresponsiveness while her HD line was replaced by IR.
She likely mucous plugged as she had some thickened secretions though the ET tube while she was intubated.
A steroid taper was begun with 40mg po prednison with plans to decrease by 10mg every 5 days.
She will need continued pulm toilet, pulm rehab, supplemental O2, and albuterol prn, and steroid taper (down 10mg every 5 days, last changed to 30mg on [**4-20**]).
It is possible she will need a longer taper given the length of time she was on high dose steroids.
She was started on DS bactrim daily for PCP prophylaxis while on high dose steroids.
Initial diuresis with 160 mg of IV lasix TID and metolazone 5 mg daily was started and -6 L of fluid were removed without improvement in the hypoxic respiratory failure.
She remained on CVVH/HD and was made and kept euvolemic with improvement in her respiratory status as above.
After intubation and further data it was thought she had a pneumonitis (medication effect, AIP, etc).
She was started on daptomycin on [**4-8**] with plans for 2 week course.
This was changed to linezolid to also cover her VAP on [**4-13**].
Hypertension - Initially continued her home diltiazem, but patient then developed hypotension.
Chronic kidney disease - eGFR of 18 ml/min with Stage IV CKD according to MDRD formula at baseline.
She became anuric, then CVVH was started for fluid removal and she was transitioned to HD on [**4-9**].
Initially she developed hyperphosphatemia, but after initiation of CVVH it resolved.
A tunneled HD catheter was placed on [**4-17**] and she will continue to require HD for the forseeable future.
Anemia - Pt with HCT of 24.3 with borderline normocytic (MCV 99) microcytic anemia with RDW of 25.1.
Iron 122, ferritin 249, TIBC 424, TRF 326 anemia of chronic kidney disease.
Repeat iron studies showed iron 81, TIBC 228, and Ferritin 723, though this was in the setting of previous blood transfusions.
She received intermittent blood transfusions throughout her stay, last on [**4-17**].
She had guaiac positive brown stools and may require outpatient colonoscopy or EGD if they continue.
Her home-dose thyroid hormone was continued.
thrombocytopenia - her plts dropped from 140s to 105 after starting cefepime and linezolid.
Access - PICC was placed on [**3-29**] for access.
After many meetings it was decided in a short intubation for diagnostic procedures and tailor therapy.
This should revert to DNR with possiblity for intubation when she arrives at her rehab.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Hypoxic respiratory failure, Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease, ventilator associated pneumonia, VRE bacteremia, decompensated diastolic heart failure  Secondary: Hypothyroidism, history of bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, mental status alert, following commands and oriented.
You were admitted with shortness of breath that required mechanical ventilation.
This is likely due to a variety of causes including heart failure, volume overload, kidney failure, infection and lung inflammation.
You still need extra oxygen and have poor lung reserve.
Your hospitalization was also complicated by blood infection (Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus) and kidney failure requiring initiation of dialysis.
