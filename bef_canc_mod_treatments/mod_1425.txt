[**2199-3-1**] BLOOD CULTURE x 2: NGTD  STUDIES PENDING ON DISCHARGE: [**2199-3-1**] BLOOD CULTURE x 2: NGTD   Brief Hospital Course: 53M w/ hemangiopericytoma s/p resection, s/p cranioplasty c/b MRSA infection and removal of bone graft and subsequent infection presenting with bilateral pulmonary emboli and right heart strain.
Although the patient showed signs of right heart strain with elevations in BNP, a mild bump in troponin, and increased RV to LV ratio on CTPA, S1Q3, the decision was made to use heparin gtt instead of thrombolysis given his history of intracranial hemorrhage and multiple cranial surgeries.
The patient was anticoagulated with a heparin drip and then transitioned to lovenox [**Hospital1 **] on [**3-4**].
We initiated coumadin 2.5mg on [**3-2**] given an INR of 1.5 and the fact that the patient was on antibiotics.
His dose was then increased to Coumadin 5mg [**3-3**] and his INR went to 1.8.
He received Coumadin 6mg [**3-4**] and his INR went from 2.1 to 3.5 both measured on [**3-4**].
His coumadin was then held on [**3-5**].
He was then instructed to take Coumadin 4mg daily based on his average dose requirement with instructions to have his INR checked on [**3-8**].
After his aspiration he was made NPO and re-evaluated by speech and swollow including a video swollow study and was found to be at his baseline and his diet of ground solids/nectar thick liquids and crushed meds was resumed.
He was continued on Levetiracetam 1000 mg PO BID.
Hemangiopericytoma: Dx [**2196**], s/p resection and hemicraniectomy complicated by multiple subsequent revisions and XRT.
The patient is maintained on doxycycline for prophylaxis.
Doxycycline was continued for prophylaxis.

A family member should then contact her for instructions on coumadin dosing.
