She is tentatively scheduled for ventral herniorrhaphy, proctosigmoidectomy and end colostomy with Drs.
Aspirin and humera were discontinued for now.
At baseline, she is not a candidate for cardioversion/anticoagulation given her active Crohns, and she takes diltiazem and metoprolol for rate control at home.
Her rate was initially difficult to control, but she eventually responded to titration of her metoprolol and diltiazem.
Her hypotension was responsive to fluid resuscitation and was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia due to massive GI losses and diminished cardiac output from atrial fibrillation with RVR.
The patient was initially treated with fluid boluses and rate control using B-blockers and calcium channel blockers.
#Skin boil/furuncle - The patient presented with a small, draining furuncle in her left labia.
