Subcentimeter hypodensities are seen in the right kidney and are stable, likely representing small cysts.
Immunostain for CMV is pending.
[**2116-11-7**] Colonoscopy w/ biopsy: Segmental continuous congestion and loss of vascularity with no bleeding were noted in the Distal ascending colon.
Impression: Congestion and loss of vascularity.
=====  [**2116-11-7**]	BIOPSY	VIRAL CULTURE: R/O CYTOMEGALOVIRUS-PENDING  Brief Hospital Course: 62-year-old male with h/o HCV cirrhosis, HCC s/p liver transplant (on tacrolimus), complicated by recurrence of hepatitis C who presents with fever, hypotension, leukocytosis, and acute renal failure, with fever of unknown origin.
# fever of unknown origin: patient initially met criteria for septic shock with fever, hypotension, leukocytosis, and evidence for end organ dysfunction.
Received a total of 7L IVF and briefly required norepi in MICU.
Pt was initially treated with very broad antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.
This was narrowed to ciprofloxacin / metronidazole on [**11-4**] to cover for colitis after CT result showing possible R-sided colitis.
Given his CMV positive graft and initially negative CMV status, suspected CMV colitis, especially given his recently completed 6 month course of valgancyclovir in [**Month (only) **] [**2116**].
Discontinued cipro/[**Doctor Last Name **] on [**11-5**], started ganciclovir @ 5mg/kg = 360 mg iv q12hrs.
Infectious diseases felt that CMV colitis given all the evidence so far was unlikely, and ganciclovir was discontinued.
Pt's Cr improved from 1.4 to 1.0 with fluids (baseline 0.7-0.8).
# HCV cirrhosis s/p transplant with persistent portal hypertension (ascites, rectal varices).
Tacro level normal at 6.9 on [**2116-11-4**], Pt was continued on home dose.
Pt's bactrim for ppx was also continued, as well as his home furosemide and spironolactone and lamivudine suppression.
His ribavirin and filgastrim were continued.
Pt states that despite his anemia / pancytopenia, he would prefer to continue treatment with interferon and ribavirin (see below), and would like to discuss additional treatments such as telaprevir or boceprevir.
Pt was transfused 1 x PRBCs on [**11-4**] for Hct 21 from baseline ~30, likely dilutional plus ribavirin effect, with appropriate bump to 24.
Pt may need erythropoietin injections to maintain his hematocrit while he remains on anti-HCV therapy.
If Pt develops fevers, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea, would consider further abdominal imaging / repeat colonoscopy given continuing suspicion for CMV.
-Pt has been a poor responder to traditional HCV therapy w/ interferon and ribarvirin.
[**Month (only) 116**] need erythropoietin or regular Hct checks and transfusions as needed.

You were initially treated with antibiotics for a suspected bacterial infection, but none of your stool cultures revealed any pathogenic bacteria, so this treatment was stopped.
Because of your prior CMV negative status and your receipt of a CMV positive liver, you were placed on antiviral medications to prevent CMV infection, which you stopped approximately one month ago.
You were started on antiviral therapy and had a colonoscopy with biopsy, which showed that you did not have any evidence of active CMV colitis.
You were seen by our infectious disease specialists, who felt that given all the evidence, you are very unlikely to have CMV colitis, and your antiviral medications were stopped.
We suggest that you continue monitoring your body temperature daily and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you develop worsening diarrhea.
You also had worsening anemia, and you were given blood transfusions.
You may need to start additional medications to increase your red blood cells and should discuss this with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
