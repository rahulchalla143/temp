HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post multiple myocardial infarctions in the past, status post right nephroureterectomy on [**2163-3-7**] for a transitional cell carcinoma, who presented on the day of admission to [**Hospital3 **] with worsening lower extremity edema and exertional dyspnea since discharge.
The patient was given Lasix 120 mg intravenously, nitroglycerin, morphine sulfate, given 100% nonrebreather, and his oxygen saturation improved to 100%.
On review of the patient's history, he admits to having frequent bologna sandwiches and can soups and was unaware of their sodium content.
The patient was given intravenous nitroglycerin, morphine, Lasix, and heparin.
He was found to have a left main coronary artery with a 40% distal lesion, left anterior descending artery with a 50% proximal lesion, left circumflex with a 50% middle lesion, second obtuse marginal and third obtuse marginal were totally occluded, right coronary artery with a 70% proximal lesion.
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for observation, diuresis, and afterload reduction in the setting of 3-vessel disease and left ventricular dysfunction.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction in [**2149**], as well as a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2159**].
History of colon cancer, status post right hemicolectomy.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without a history of intubation or hospitalizations.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post left femoral-popliteal in [**2155**] with known carotid artery disease with a right internal carotid artery of 80%.
Transitional cell bladder cancer, status post right nephroureterectomy on [**2163-3-7**].
ALLERGIES:  IODINE which causes anaphylaxis.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d., NPH 15 units subcutaneous q.12h., clonidine 0.15 mg p.o.
q.o.d., allopurinol 100 mg p.o.
q.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d., Lasix 120 mg p.o.
q.d., multivitamin, trazodone 25 mg p.o.
q.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Abdominal examination revealed no hepatosplenomegaly, normal bowel sounds, with a nontender and nondistended abdomen.
Within 48 hours of the patient being in the Coronary Care Unit, the patient developed an episode of bradycardia, hypotension, and hypoxic arrest requiring intubation and the use of pressors.
The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization four days later, at which point he received stents to his right coronary artery and first obtuse marginal.
He was maintained on aspirin and Plavix.
The patient initially required Levophed and dopamine which was able to be weaned off within the first 24 hours after intubation.
The patient was then started on afterload reduction with hydralazine and then nitrates.
The patient was eventually stabilized on a heart failure regimen that included hydralazine and Isordil.
PULMONARY:  From a pulmonary standpoint, the patient was initially intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of known poor systolic function.
He was started on continuous venovenous hemofiltration, and then the patient's clinical status improved.
At that point, Pulmonary was consulted and felt that the patient's multiple reintubations had to do with poor cardiac status limiting increase cardiac output and stress response to mild episodes of respiratory compromise including mucous plugging and aspiration.
Multiple meetings were held with the family regarding goals of care, and at all times they wished to pursue reintubation and resuscitation with the exception if the patient were to require long-term ventilatory care.
They were amenable to tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement if needed.
He was empirically started on Levaquin and Flagyl.
Subsequent cultures grew only pan-sensitive enterococcus in his urine.
The patient completed a 10-day course of levofloxacin and ampicillin for a urinary tract infection.
When the patient experienced his decompensation status post initial extubation, he was started on vancomycin and ceftazidime for a possible line-related sepsis and ventilatory-associated pneumonia.
The patient had a right femoral internal jugular tip which had grown out methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermitis for which he received a single dose of gentamicin.
The patient was continued on coverage for ventilatory-associated pneumonia for 10 days; after which his antibiotics were discontinued.
The patient subsequently underwent two cardiac catheterizations which also were felt to have contributed to dye-associated nephropathy.
The patient was initially started on continuous venovenous hemofiltration with excellent results and excellent control of his volume status.
The patient was then started on hemodialysis.
Although possible renal recovery was not excluded, it appeared to the Renal Service that the patient would remain on prolonged hemodialysis.
The patient had a Perm-A-Cath placed for durable hemodialysis access.
The patient had been anticoagulated for several of his catheterizations and after stent placement.
He was transfused with blood products to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 30.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient presented with borderline nutritional compromise.
He was provided tube feeds through nasogastric tube.
The patient underwent this procedure without difficulty.
He will receive tube feeds until it is felt that his swallowing capacity may be re-evaluated.
His daughters felt that he would want aggressive respiratory and ventilatory efforts as long as he was not to remain on machines indefinitely.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to acute rehabilitation for ongoing conditioning and management of pulmonary hygiene.
