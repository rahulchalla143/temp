HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, status post pacemaker placement, history of seizure disorder, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and numerous surgeries for his upper airway, who presented with hypoxia leading to generalized tonoclonic seizure.
The patient has a history of tracheal stenosis malacia resulting from prolonged intubation between [**12-19**] through [**2122-3-3**] and placement of tracheostomy after triple layer repair complicated by grafting section and revisions.
In [**2122-11-1**] the patient was found to have tracheal carcinoma in-situ and underwent multiple bronchoscopies with dilation and laser resection, as well as bronchial stent placements.
Most recently he underwent T tube placement in [**2124-1-1**] and was scheduled to be replaced due to inadequate length.
Per patient's wife he did not arouse with intervention but his breathing became "more normal".
The patient was treated with Ativan and Dilantin load.
He was taken to the Operating Room for removal of his tracheal stents and placement of that trach.
During the surgical exploration, the patient had episode of desaturation to 30% despite ventilation which lead to removal of the ET and T-tube and placement of tracheostomy.
Tracheal stenosis/malacia after prolonged intubation after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with complicated postop course including graft infection and revision.

His stent was removed and trach was placed in the Operating Room on the night of admission.
The patient was initially loaded with Dilantin with an increase in his dose to 500 mg p.o.
The patient initially persisted with high oxygen requirement, was febrile with productive cough and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia.
Because patient persisted with diffuse pulmonary effusions on his chest x-ray he was also started on Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
On [**2-18**], the patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy and T tube placement.
He tolerated the procedure well.
He is being discharged home with VNA Services for antibiotic administration for the remaining 11 days.
