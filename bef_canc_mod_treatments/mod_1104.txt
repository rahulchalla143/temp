# RUQ Ultrasound [**2157-8-3**]: FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to [**2157-7-6**].
Brief Hospital Course: 48F h/o HCV cirrhosis, admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10 with hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, and questionable respiratory symptoms.
In light of her recent hospitalization, pt was started on ciprofloxacin 400mg IV q12H ([**7-6**]) for nosocomial PNA.
To cover the possibility of aspiration PNA as pt's hepatic encephalopathy persisted, abx were broadened to vancomycin ([**7-9**])/pip-taz ([**7-9**])/azithromycin ([**Date range (1) 11067**]).
# Respiratory compromise: On admission, pt was ambulatory with no oxygen requirement, and pt was placed on home regimen of albuterol and fluticasone-salmeterol 100-50 mcg/dose [**Hospital1 **].
Pt's acute respiratory compromise was considered to be possibly multifactorial, with contributions from asthma exacerbation, PNA, fluid overload, and possible TRALI.
# Adrenal insufficiency [**1-7**] liver failure: Pt was initially maintained on her home regimen of prednisone 5 mg daily.
# Asthma: After pt's episode of respiratory insufficiency, pt was continued on standing albuterol and fluticasone-salmeterol nebs, with home regimen of montelukast held.
She continued albuterol and fluticasone/salmeteral nebs throughout her stay.
# [**Female First Name (un) 564**] overgrowth:  In the MICU, pt was started on casofungin x 4-5 days given yeast in sputum, as it was felt to be colonization.
Repeat sputum and urine cultures, however, demonstrated continued heavy yeast colonization, with urine growing C. glabrata, and sputum growing C. albicans (sensitive to fluconazole) as well as another yeast organism with indeterminate speciation.
Pt was started therefore on fluconazole 200mg daily on [**7-26**].
Per ID recommendations, fluconazole was stopped since yeast was likely colonizer and not reflecting true infection.
# Hepatic encephalopathy:  Pt was given regular doses of rifaximin, lactulose PO, and lactulose PR, titrated to achieve four bowel movements daily.
Pt's mental status was noted to wax and wane throughout admission, and therefore an NG tube, later a N-J tube, was placed to prevent aspiration.
Pt was placed on pureed foods with sips of thin liquids only after a bedside speech and swallow noted no active aspiration, but the need for precautions.
Pt therefore was intially fluid-restricted and administered albumin, with furosemide and spironolactone initially held.
# DM2: Pt's blood glucose was controlled with HISS, with home regimen of glipizide first reduced and then ultimately held out of concern for hypoglycemia in the setting of hepatic dysfunction.
Pt was placed on glargine 12 units at bedtime to provide basal glucose control, which was subsequently increased to 17 and then 20 on day of discharge to better control her glucose.
# Anemia: Hct was noted to drift downwards to a low of 20.9 on [**7-8**], and pt was therefore transfused 1 unit PRBC.
# UTI: Pt was noted to have entercoccus in urine culture on [**7-9**], treated with vancomycin.
# FEN:  Pt was placed on a low Na diet.
After extubation, pt was given NutrenPulmonary tube feeds at 60cc/hr, cycled from 1800 hrs to 1200 hrs, to increase her caloric intake, which was then changed to continuous 24 hr.
She passed swallow and is cleared to take a full diet, but should be watched directly whenever she is eating to keep her from trying to swallow too much at once (per speech).
