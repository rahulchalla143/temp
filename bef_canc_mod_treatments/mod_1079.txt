Brief Hospital Course: 58M with a history of pancreatic cancer s/p Whipple procedure and chemo, biliary cirrhosis requiring repeat paracentesis, and DM presented with AMS [**1-27**] hypoglycemia.
# Hypotension: Initially on dopamine 5mcg/kg/min with SBP 80s, MAPs>60.
?s liver disease and ascites and rapid repletion of Na, we attempted to avoid IVF boluses to maintain BP.
We treated empirically with ceftriaxone initially until the patient was transitioned to comfort-focused care.
Per family, they were withholding his oral hypoglycemics for the past couple of days as he was not eating and was refusing to have his FSBG checked at home.
Mental status rapidly improved after the first amp of dextrose and continued to improve after 3 amps and D5W.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Given BUN and Cr ratio and comparing to past records, this acute renal dysfunction was most likely pre-renal secondary to decreased PO intake.
We treated with patient's pain with Dilaudid IV gtt and titrated as needed to best treat his pain.
His family was aware of his terminal course and we requested spiritual and social work support.
We provided Ativan as needed for agitation, bowel regimen for constipation, and anti-secretion medications for oral secretions.
