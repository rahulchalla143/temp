The patient initially presented in [**7-1**] for fevers and rigors and was found to have a subdiaphragmatic abscess and underwent IR drain placement with cultures demonstrating polymicrobial growth including Bacteroides and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas treated with ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and fluconazole subsequently changed to amox/clav.
On [**7-16**], she underwent open left colectomy with colorectal anastamosis and diverting loop ileostomy, with stool noted in the abscess.
Her post-operative course was then complicated by a prolonged [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay for volume overload requiring mechanical ventilation and a left-sided watershed CVA, and was ultimately discharged to rehab on [**2160-8-13**] with persistent weakness on vanco, meropenem, and micafungin with plan for continuation of antibiotics for at least 7 days after drain was pulled.
Neuro is following, and the patient has received a total of 1500 mg fosphenytoin with most recent trough pending and standing ativan Q6H.
Of note, PICC line placed during prior admission has not yet been removed.
LUQ drain was subsequently removed, and CT guided aspiration of midline and RUQ fluid collections unsuccessful.

Changed anti-epileptic meds to PO, dosing per neuro.
On discharge the patient is on 200mg of Phenytoin (Suspension) every 8 hours at set times.
She will need a dilantin level on [**2160-9-21**] with an albumin for a corrected dilantin level.
# Stroke: TEE ruled out endocarditis.
Anti-cardiolipin IgG/IgM pending.
Heparin started [**8-27**] with plan to bridge to coumadin.
However, given no IV access in the ICU was changed to plavix bridge to Coumadin.
Neurology agreed that it was appropriate to start the patient on 325mg of Aspirin Therapy daily and continue Coumadin.
Today on discharge her INR is 1.8 and she is written to recieve 7.5 mg of Warfarin today [**2160-9-18**] which is an increase from [**2160-9-17**] when she recieved 5mg of Warfarin for an INR of 1.4.
# Fever/leukocytosis:  leukocytosis 11.3 and 13.2.
Potential sources include: evolving pneumonia, abdominal source given recent history and temporal association with drain removal.
Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Micafungin discontinued on [**8-27**].
The patient was noted to have some increased adjitation and a urinalysis and urine culture was sent on [**2160-9-9**] which showed possible VRE, infectious disease was consulted and it seemed as though the specimen was possibly contaminated, her foley catheter was removed and a repeat UA was then sent which again showed enterococus.
It was decided that at the recommendation of infectious disease to give the patient a one time dose of fofomycin 3gm by mouth and follow-up in 48 hours with a urinalysis and culture.
The patient was started on linezolid by mouth for possible VRE in the urine.
Because she was unable to maintain her nutrition with food, she was started on supplemental TPN.
After close follow-up with nutrition and calorie counts the patient was unable to maintain enough calories and a PEG tube was surgically placed.
She was taking all medications by mouth at discharge with cycled tube feedings overnight.
# SLE: Patient on chronic steroids, unclear history.
Continue prednisone 10mg daily.
# BP: Patient has been progressively more hypertensive so we restarted beta blocker.
Given complete R carotid occlusion and L partial occlusion, pt likely needs the blood pressure for cerebral perfusion so we will maintain SBPs 120.
Restarted metoprolol 25mg qd by mouth [**8-27**].
# DM 2: Per recommendation by geriatrics the patient was started on the following insulin regimen.
Ensure pt receives NO INSULIN on sliding scale if blood sugar <160, and then 2U for 160-180, 4U 180-200, etc.
Continue regular 6U q6 x2 during tube feeds and Lantus 8U standing at bedtime.
Ensure sliding scale is only used q6h, as yesterday pt received doses off the sliding scale <2h apart.
She has required seroquel at 8pm.
She has not required additional medication during the day.
