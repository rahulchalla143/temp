Patient was recently diagnosed with a UTI and started on macrodantin on [**2-17**] for culture positive UTI.
She was also noted to have worsening renal failure with increase in creatinine from 2 to 2.8, and worsening thrombocytopenia requiring a bag of platelets.
She received 1 gram of Vancomycin and 400 mg of IV Cipro, one amp of D50, and tylenol.
Excisional biopsy of left supraclavicular node pathology and immunohistochemistry c/w CLL.

Her post-chemotherapy course was complicated by febrile neutropenia and pancytopenia.
Her bone marrow was again assessed in [**8-/2162**] and was consistent with treated CLL.
She remained thrombocytopenic following this without a response to steroids and only minimal response to IVIG.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**10/2164**] suggested a sustained response to chemotherapy on the megakaryocytes.
Due to increasing painful lymphadenopathy and IVC compression seen on CT, she was treated with chlorambucil from [**2166-2-24**] through [**2166-4-3**].
Chlorambucil was restarted at 4mg dose on [**2166-8-29**] when she progressed with painful adenopathy.

The patient p/w known UTI and recent neutropenia, and was recently started on oxycontin for pain.
She was also on gabapentin while in acute on chronic renal failure.
Review of her meds show multiple sedating agents.
She received treatemnt for her UTI, as below.
The patient should avoid medications such as oxycontin, lorazepam, diphenhydramine, gabapentin.
Patient was being treated for reported "pan-sensitive" E. coli with nitrofurantoin at rehab.
On admission she was started on IV ciprofloxacin for coverage, which was changed to Bactrim for 10-day course given sensitivities.
The patient has lactam allergy and received imipenem at rehab, which could also be considered a cause of her neutropenia.
The patient was started on broad antibiotic coverage -- aztreonam for gram negatives, vanco for gram positives, and clindamycin for anaerobes (mouth flora in presence of oral sores) which was narrowed to flaygl (stomach upset with clinda) for mouth flora and bactrim (changed to nitrofurantoin based on sensitivities) for UTI.
TRALI was considered, but the patient improved quickly with diuresis and nebulizer treatments.
She was aggressively diuresed and continued on nebs ATC, supplemental O2 PRN, and continued on rate control with diltiazem and carvedilol.
She was continued on carvedilol and diltiazem with good rate control.
With cardiology input, she was determined not to be a candidate for anticoagulation secondary to chronic low platelets.
Patient is now on a fairly extensive med regimen including lisinopril, BB, nitrate, clonidine patch, and diltiazem which should be continued as an outpatient.
The patient did have significant chest pain with her rapid a-fib and received nitroglycerin with good effect.
#) ARF: The patient had a creatinine of 2.8 from baseline ~ 1.3 This trended back to baseline with diuresis and antibiotics.
Etiology was most likely felt to be c/w medication-effect as the patient did receive imipenem at rehab and has history of leukopenia w/ beta-lactam antibiotics.
She required a total of 3 platelet transfusions (on [**2-23**], -18, and -25) and 4 PRBC transfusions ([**2-21**] x 2, -17, and -21) during her hospital course.
Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
