There is stable scarring or atelectasis at the left lung base as well as calcifications at the costochondral junction.
IMPRESSION:  New left IJ catheter with tip in the upper SVC, no pneumothorax.
A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is present.
There is no right pneumothorax after failed internal jugular vein catheter placement.
The previously placed left internal jugular vein catheter has been removed.
Brief Hospital Course: 81-year-old female history of atrial fibrillation, CHF s/p mitral and tricuspid annuloplasty [**2-/2153**] c/b ACA infarct presenting from rehab with AMS and hypotension following a syncopal episode, transferred to the ICU for hypotension requiring pressor support.
Active Issues: #Hypotension/Shock: Initial SBP 50s was minimally responsive to fluid resuscitation and levophed was started in the ED.
She was started on cefepime based on prior sensitivities.
Patient was quickly weaned off levophed in ICU and remained hemodynamically stable.
Recommended considering amiodarone to keep patient in sinus rhythm, though would defer for now as [**Month/Day/Year 263**] subtherapeutic on admission, and goal would be for therapeutic [**Month/Day/Year 263**] x1 month prior to starting amio.
DDx included decreased cerebral perfusion in setting of hypotension, seizures/post-ictal state, toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, recrudesence of prior stroke symptoms and recurrent stroke.
#UTI: Hematuria and pyruria on urinalysis in ED.
Pt was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**7-25**] on amoxicillin for UTI which was changed to ceftriaxone x 5 days for planned 7 day course the following day when urine culture showed resistant proteus, but it is unclear if patient completed the full course of ceftriaxone based on rehab documentation.
Pt received 1g ceftriaxone in the ED.
Due to concern for resistance given possible inconsistency in ceftriaxone therapy, started treatment with cefepime to which the prior culture was also sensitive.
#CHF: Pt is s/p mitral and tricuspid annuloplasty [**2-/2153**] with recent EF 50% with trivial MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 17417**] TR, although presence of acoustic shadowing may have significantly underestimated valvular regurgitation.
Home metoprolol and digoxin initially held given current hypotension and bradycardia, though later restarted.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been dilutional effect in setting of aggressive volume resuscitation for hypotension.
Transitional Issues: -may need further neurologic work-up -restart warfarin once [**Month (only) 263**] no longer supratherapeutic -consider amiodarone in future once [**Month (only) 263**] therapeutic x1 month  Medications on Admission: 1.
