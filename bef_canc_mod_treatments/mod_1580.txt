She was started on sodium bicarbonate 650 mg tid.
There was probably a component of ATN given the presence of granular cast on urine sedimentation and prominant auto-diuresis on HD#3,4.
She was initially treated with calcium, insulin and dextrose in the ICU.
ACE inhibitor discontinued at this hospitalization.
Pt was treated with aggressive iv lasix diuresis for two days.
We therefore held diuresis until her urine output normalized.
We discontinued her enalapril and metoprolol, and started her on a low dose 10 mg pravastatin and carvedilol 3.125 [**Hospital1 **].
Pt was evaluated by the cardiologist, who also recommended aspirin for her CAD and compromised systolic function.
However, the decision was deferred given the complicated medical comordities and her age.
Regarding her diuretics, her home dose was increased from 20 mg qday to 40 mg qday.
Per discussion with cardiology, the underlying rhythm was afib with slow ventricular response and occasional slow a-flutter with variable block.
Patient was started on a low dose beta blocker on this hospitalization for generalized rhythm control and cardioprotective effects.
# Arrhythmia - Afib/Aflutter: Pt has known history of atrial fibrillation, CHADS score [**3-1**], on dabigatran prior to admission.
She was started on warfarin 5 mg qd, with an initial attempt of heparin bridge.
Her metoprolol was switched to carvedilol per above (initially held in presence of bradycardia), and she was discharged on a warfarin dose of 6 mg qday as INR remained subtherepeutic at time of discharge.
CHRONIC ISSUES # HTN: Pt's blood pressure medication was discontinued initially.
We held her enalapril and metoprolol, but restarted her amlodipine during this hospitalization as well as carvedilol per above due to systolic BP's as high as 180 mmHg.
# Diabetes: We continued her home dose 70/30 insulin and sliding scale.
# HL: We started pravastatin 10 mg daily given her CAD.
We continued her pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Osteopenia: We started pt on Calcium/ Vitamin D .

You were found to have a condition called renal tubular acidosis type 4 which was responsible for your potassium changes.
In regards to your leg swelling, we were able to remove significant amounts of fluid from you with diuretics, and your heart and kidney condition improved significantly.
You were seen by physical therapy, and it has been recommended that you receive physical therapy in a short term rehab facility.
Please note the following changes in your medication: - Please STOP taking enalapril - Please STOP taking metoprolol - Please STOP taking dabigatran (Pradaxa) - Please START to take sodium bicarbonate 650 mg tablet by mouth three times a day - Please START to take warfarin 6 mg tablet by mouth daily - Please START to take pravastatin 10 mg tablet by mouth daily - Please START to take carvediolol 3.125 mg tablet by mouth twice a day - Please INCREASE furosemide to 40 mg (from 20 mg) by mouth daily .
