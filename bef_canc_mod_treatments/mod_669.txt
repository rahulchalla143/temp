He had a known history of myocardial infarction with prior left anterior descending coronary artery stenting in [**2161-9-10**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post two stents.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Appendectomy in [**2119**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atenolol, Lipitor, Benicar and Amiodarone which had been discontinued.
An arterial line was started with strict blood pressure control with Esmolol and Nipride drips.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to Cardiac Surgery under Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who examined him and noted lability of his blood pressure.
He was on beta-blockade and Nipride.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] agreed with the plan to get a TEE first with tight blood pressure control and to have Vascular Surgery also consult on the patient and schedule an MRA approximately two days hence.
All recommendations and analysis of the scans were the same with a type B dissection requiring tight medical management.
The patient was also seen by Case Management to help plan for his hospital stay and eventual discharge.
His blood pressure was 100/44 on an Esmolol drip and a Nipride drip.
The patient remained on Esmolol drip at 200 and a Nipride drip at 0.5 mg/kg/min.
The patient was also started on beta-blockade orally with Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
He was also given 6 mg bolus of adenosine with no change and then a 12 mg bolus of adenosine which had terminated the supraventricular tachycardia and resumed sinus rhythm in the 70s with a prolonged QT.
The patient continued on Esmolol and Labetalol.
He continued to be monitored tightly with telemetry and remained in the CSRU.
On house-day 2, he was weaned off all of his intravenous drips.
Blood pressure was controlled through oral medications with beta-blocker.
Additional Labetalol was ordered and given with a goal range of 100-120 systolic.
He was administered intravenous adenosine again.
At 2 a.m. on the 8th, the patient again had a reemergence of his AV nodal reentrant tachycardia to 130s.
He was given additional 6 mg of adenosine with good affect.
A Foley catheter was replaced.
He was on Labetalol 800 three times a day, hydralazine and Losartan 100 mg p.o.
Lopressor was added back in addition to his Labetalol and Losartan with plans to complete the MRA that evening post EP ablation.
Additionally, intravenous fluids were given as the patient remained NPO.
He was unable to urinate after his MRI, and his Foley was replaced on the 11th.
The patient was also replaced on a sliding scale for regular Insulin.
He was also given Calcium Carbonate on house-day 8.
His type II dissection continued to be stable, and Vascular Surgery signed off.
Cardiology was reconsulted and also recommended starting Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
Magnesium Citrate was given for complaints of constipation by the patient.
daily at the recommendation of Cardiology, and Toprol, Labetalol, Hydrochlorothiazide were continued.
On postoperative day 10, he did have much better blood pressure control with decreased Labetalol with a blood pressure of 126/79.
He was also given clearance for discharge home by Vascular Surgery attending and to have repeat imaging with either CT Surgery or Vascular Surgery in approximately [**4-16**] mos to follow his dissection.
He was instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately one week, his cardiologist, and to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately three months for continued monitoring of his type B dissection.
Coronary artery disease status post left anterior descending coronary artery stenting times two.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Toprol XL 100 mg p.o.
once a day, Flomax 0.8 mg p.o.
once a day, Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
once daily, Amlodipine 10 mg p.o.
daily at bed time, Losartan 100 mg p.o.
at bed time, Labetalol 400 mg p.o.
