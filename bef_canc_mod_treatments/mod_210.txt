The patient's wife notes that she saw him at rehabilitation on Friday [**2160-4-25**], 4 days prior to admission, and the patient was noted to be the most alert he has been recently and was also able to ambulate with a physical therapist.
She reports that on Friday [**2160-4-25**], he received his routine Botox injection for muscle spasticity from his stroke, which he has tolerated well in the past.
However, he had also been receiving low doses of baclofen at rehabilitation, and received the Botox in combination with his baclofen.
However, he then was restarted on baclofen at his rehabilitation facility with a similar reaction to the medication, and the dose was decreased to 10 mg TID with the plan to taper his baclofen.
He was evaluated by the physician at the facility and his dose of baclofen was decreased to 10 mg qAM, 5 mg qPM, 10 mg qhs.
On Monday [**2160-4-28**], one day prior to admission, the patient appeared worse, not interacting at all and not eating, and his Baclofen was discontinued after his AM dose.
He appeared unwell today as well and was sent from rehabilitation to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation.
Additionally, he also became over-sedated and drowsy with vomiting on standing oxycodone, which improved with PRN oxycodone.
Patient was given 1mg IV lorazepam given for questionable seizure and 1 liter of normal saline.
Neuro-Oncology was called and recommended continued infectious workup and admission to OMED Service.
Patient underwent CT head and CXR and was admitted for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 16847**] is a 57-year-old with NSCLC/adenocarcinoma of lung with metastases to brain, s/p resection ([**2139**] and [**2140**]), seizure disorder ([**2140**]), CVA ([**2156**]) with residual right-sided hemiparesis and slurred speech presenting with lethargy, altered mental status.
(1) Lethargy/Altered Mental Status:  This is likely secondary to medication effect.

He was discharged on methylphenidate 15 mg [**Hospital1 **] and will have to increased this dose to 20 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**2160-5-20**].
Respiratory failure was attributed to an aspiration event and subsequent aspiriation pneumonitis/pneumonia.
Atrial line was placed and blood pressure was noted to be hypertensive.
Pressors were discontinued and blood pressure remained stable throughout the remainder of the hospitalization.
He was started on broad spectrum coverage with vancomycin and zosyn.
Sputum cultures grew MSSA and antibiotics were narrowed to nafcillin for a planned 8 day course.
There was initally concern for PE and the patient was breifly started on a heparin gtt.

We think that your change in mental status was likely due to medication side effects.
We had to place a tube in your throat to help you breath.
We made the following changes to your medications STOP Baclofen  START Ritalin 15 mg by mouth twice daily another four days INCREASE Ritalin to 20 mg by mouth twice daily on [**2160-5-20**]  START thiamine 100 mg by mouth daily START Duonebs every six hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing  Followup Instructions: Department: NEUROLOGY When: THURSDAY [**2160-5-29**] at 2:00 PM With: [**Doctor Last Name 640**] [**Doctor First Name 747**] [**Name8 (MD) **], M.D.
