She is being admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for airway monitoring given her swollen tongue.
She was seen at [**Hospital3 **] today for a pre-op assessment prior to a urinary sling procedure.
Her husband reports increasing confusion and frequent falls over the last two weeks.
She was treated for a UTI with Amoxicillin 1 month ago.
She has been on several different medications for urinary incontinence over the last 2 yrs including detrol and vesicare.
Past Medical History: - ?dementia - urinary incontinence since [**2099**] - chronic low back pain/degenerative disk disease s/p failed back surgery, epidural steroid injections, nerve blocks, facet injections, trigger point injections - hyperlipidemia - hypertension - major depression  Social History: She lives at home with her husband.
The tracheostomy and the right subclavian venous line are in good position, stable.
She was disoriented throughout her stay, and agitated and somnolent at times.
The pt was evaluated by the oro-maxillofacial surgery service from the [**Hospital1 756**] and no intervention was recommended.
The pt was empirically started on Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Acyclovir and Ampicillin.
Due to concern for Vancomycin or Acyclovir induced nephrotoxicity, these medications were held and Cr was rechecked; it normalized within days.
The pt was started on seizure prophylaxis with Phenytoin IV.
In light of mental status changes, the pt was also empirically started on Ampicillin, Vancomycin, Acyclovir and Ceftriaxone after 4 failed attempts at LP (pt has spine fusions from L3 to S1).
The Ampicillin was subsequently discontinued.
She was then loaded with dilantin and transferred to the neuro ICU on the [**Hospital Ward Name **].
All antibiotics were discontinued.
In the neuro ICU the patient was placed on continuous EEG monitoring.
She was started on IV glycerine to treat brain edema related to her fall.
A tracheostomy and g-tube were placed and the patient was transferred to the neurology step down unit.
Initially, she had absent reflexes and no withdrawal to noxious stimuli; she began to regain reflexes and withdrew her lower limbs to nailbed pressure, raising the possibility of resolving critical illness polyneuropathy.
She also had several routine EEGs with similar findings.
# Renal - the patient temporarily developed ARF on IV acyclovir.
The medication was discontinued and the patient received aggressive IV hydration.
She was given decadron 10 mg x1; this resolved.
Sling procedure was planned by urology prior to hospitalization.
She was started on Metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] in ICU (home dose was atenolol 50 daily).
The patient had been on Fluphenazine x 40 yrs- initially, this was thought to be related to change in mental status; however, two weeks later when she remained in coma, this was thought less likely.
#Pulm: The patient had a tracheostomy performed while here and then required oxygen through a trach mask for the remainder of her stay.
She did develop a bilateral PNA which was successfully treated and subsequent CXRs were clear.
She then had a tension pneumothorax requiring chest tube.
Her brainstem reflexes are normal, with normal corneals, gag, cough, OCRs, nasal tickle, and pupils.
