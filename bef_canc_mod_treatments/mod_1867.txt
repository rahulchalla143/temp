Post-operatively, the patient was taken to the recovery room before being transferred to the SICU for further care and management.
She was re-started on Dilantin (per the patient, she had run out of this medication prior to this hospitalization), with the head of the bed elevated from 0-15 degrees.
On [**4-23**], the patient was started on subcutaneous heparin, and her Foley catheter was discontinued.
She was given 75mg of trazodone which helped calm her.
Her subdural drain had an output of 240cc for 24hrs and 50cc for 8hrs.
She was restarted on half the dose of seroquel and her normal dose of zoloft.
Trazadone was held until seroquel tritrated to 300mg.
