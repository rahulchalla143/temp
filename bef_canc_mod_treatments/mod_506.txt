# Respiratory distress: Patient was treated initially with BiPAP in the emergency department.
She spent one night in the ICU with BiPAP which was able to be weaned off without difficulty and she was weaned down to to 1-2L nasal cannula by time of discharge with O2 Saturation in the mid 90s range.
Patient tolerated room air without difficulty, but was kept on nasal cannula for comfort.
Heart rate controlled with carvedilol and BiPAP intervention.
Also had better blood pressure control after continued [**Year/Month/Day 2286**] fluid removal and losartan therapy.
She will continue on losartan and carvedilol at discharge.
# Aortic Stenosis: Progression from mild to severe aortic stenosis in recent months with clinical decline and sensitivity to drops in pre-load volume with her [**Year/Month/Day 2286**] sessions has made management especially challenging.
Patient was seen and evaluated by cardiologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] who helped communicate to patient and family that future surgical interventions for aortic stenosis would not be feasible.
Additional cardiac medications with [**Last Name (un) **], beta blocker continued as above.
Patient and HCP both feel that they want to continue with HD and feel that quality of life is good enough to continue with it.
# ESRD on HD: Continued with hemodialysis per home schedule.
# Hypertension: Remained normotensive for majority of stay after initial hypertension on hospital day one.
Controlled with medications and HD .
The patient responded well to supplemental glucose.
