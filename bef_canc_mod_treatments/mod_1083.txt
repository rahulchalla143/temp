HISTORY: Hepatitis B cirrhosis with variceal bleeds, pre-operative for TIPS.
He was followed here by hepatology who recommended a TIPS procedure, unfortunately TIPS failed in IR.
He got a large dye load and had 1 hour of fluoro time, so he was discharge to return in 5 days for CT mapping of his liver on [**3-18**], and repeat TIPS on [**3-19**].
His heart rate was too low for nadolol and given his recent dye load we avoided diuretics to exonerate his kidneys.
