Pt is s/p stenting to R.ICA on [**2127-7-7**], L.ICA [**2-22**].
Pt denies that he had neurologic symptoms including difficulty with speech, confusion, numbness, weakness, paresthesias, or syncopal/pre-syncopal type episodes.
Past Medical History: Dyslipidemia CAD, s/p multivessel stenting Severe bilateral carotid disease Probable Interstitial lung disease Possible myelodysplastic syndrome with a history of pancytopenia  (s/p bone marrow biopsy [**10-24**]) BPH Osteoarthritis Remote Hydrocele repair Wrist fracture, s/p surgery Tonsillectomy Cardiac Risk Factors: Dyslipidemia, smoking hx  Social History: Patient smoked 4 ppd x 37 years, quitting 22 years ago.
Family History: Father died from an MI at age 62, paternal uncle died of an MI at age 62  Physical Exam: VS: T96.5 , BP114/66 , HR66 , RR 17 , O2 98-100% on RA Gen: NAD, appears his stated age, NAD HEENT: NCAT, perrla, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, no facial asymmetry Neck: no JVD, no LAD CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
[**3-22**] shoulder strength.
The intracranial internal carotid, anterior and middle cerebral arteries are patent without focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm more than 3 mm, within the resolution of MR angiogram.
Though there is decreased signal along the presumed course of the stents, with some hypointense areas on the medial aspect of the right cervical internal carotid artery which can be due to atherosclerotic calcifications, assessment is limited on the present study.
Pt was continued on ASA, plavix and a statin and anti-hypertensives and anti-anginals (imdur), and flomax were held upon admission to CCU to maintain pt's blood pressure at an adequate level post-carotid stenting.
Following carotid stenting the pt was placed on phenylephrine to maintain systolic blood pressures in the 120's.
The morning following the procedure the pt was administered a 250 cc normal saline bolus and tolerating weaning of phenylephrine.
# Rhythm: Following carotid stenting the pt was in sinus bradycardia.
As he had a history of sinus bradycardia the rhythm was expected post-procedure and he was monitored on telemetry.
# HTN: The pt was started on Neosyn following the carotid stenting.
Pt had poor urine output following the procedure that improved when a foley was placed.
On day of discharge the foley was discontinued and pt was restarted on Flomax and produced adequate urine.
Baseline creatinine was noted to be unknown but creatinine was stable at 1.3 (1.2 on admission) post-procedure.
# Neurologic: On day 2 of admission the pt developed left shoulder "weakness" s/p stent to right ICA with 4/5 proximal left upper extremity strength.
Hemoglobin A1C was within normal limits and a lipied panel was also within normal limits.
On day of discharge pt's left upper extremity strength was mildly improved, and a physical therapy consultation recommended outpatient occupational therapy for the left hand.
The patient was given a script for outpatient occupational therapy.
# FEN: Patient was administered a cardiac diet, and electrolytes were repleted as needed.
# Prophylaxis: The patient was continued on aspirin and plavix.
He was administered subcutaneous heparin.
A bowel regimen was administered and incentive spirometry was encouraged.
