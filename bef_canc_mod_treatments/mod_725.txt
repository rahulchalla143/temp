He received chemotherapy and radiation in [**Month (only) 404**]-[**2203-3-31**] and underwent an open proctosigmoidectomy with diverting loop ileostomy [**2203-6-29**].
PCI was deferred at that time due to urgency of his surgery and the need to be off ASA and Plavix prior to surgery.
He will be having ileostomy reversal sometime in the near future.
He is now being referred to cardiac surgery for redo-CABG.
