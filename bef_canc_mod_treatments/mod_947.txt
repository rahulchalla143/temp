CXR ([**4-15**]): IMPRESSION: New right IJ line tip projects at the cavoatrial junction.
CXR ([**4-22**]): Since [**2168-4-15**], right internal jugular catheter was removed and left-sided dual-lumen subclavian catheter was installed, ending in the low SVC.
Retrocardiac opacification is again seen as well as a probable small right pleural effusion.
Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
Nasogastric tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 year-old male with hepatitis C cirrhosis awaiting liver transplant, HCC status-post RFA, originally admitted on [**2168-4-6**] for umbilical hernia repair in the setting of ascites leakage, transferred to the hepatorenal medicine service for management post-surgery, with prolonged hospital course c/b MRSA peritonitis leading to sepsis, s/p MICU stay, ATN s/p temporary hemodialysis, as well as ?
Admitted for umbilical hernia repair because of ascites leakage through hernia ([**2168-4-7**]), subsequently transferred to medicine.
Following hernia repair, he had two therapeutic paracentesis with 5.5 L on the [**2168-4-11**] and [**2168-4-13**].
Treated w vanc/zosyn until cultures grew MRSA, then a 4-week course of vancomycin ([**Date range (1) 75691**]) was given.
Zosyn switched to ciprofloxacin at first, then restarted for a 7-day course ([**Date range (1) 75692**]) for a possible HAP, given low-grade fevers and ?
Otherwise, pt continued on prophylactic medications - lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy, nadolol for esophageal varices, furosemide/spironolactone for ascites.
Pt also required therapeutic paracentesis every 3-4 days for refractory ascites.
Received nutritional supplements through tube feeds.
Post-pyloric tube was replaced on [**2168-5-11**], day of discharge, due to clogging.
Patient remains active on transplant list, and is transferred to rehabilitation facility awaiting transplant.
He developed oliguric ARF in the setting of hypotension from large-volume paracentesis and sepsis.
Patient treated with volume expansion, as well as albumin/midodrine/octreotide.
Required temporary hemodialysis for total volume overload (though intravascular volume low).
Octreotide/midodrine stopped, albumin only given with paracentesis.
Due to risk of hypotension, the amount of fluid taken off during paracenteses was reduced to 3-4L/session.
Diabetes mellitus type II:  Prior to admission he was diet-controlled, however, with infection he became difficult to control and started on insulin drip in the setting of infection.
Once infection treated, pt transitioned to SC insulin with better sugar control - 100s-low 200s.
Most recent insulin regimen included with discharge paperwork.
