CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2131-5-23**] 8:51 AM SINGLE PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: A dual-lead pacing device remains in unchanged position.
IMPRESSION: Asymmetric right-sided largely parahilar airspace disease and re- accumulated large pleural effusion, as on previous episodes.
Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper to mid SVC.
He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, and was started on a neosynephrine drip which was weaned [**5-24**] and he was started on vancomycin and zosyn.
Vascular surgery and podiatry evaluated him and debrided the ulcers.
His blood grew proteus mirabilis (pan-sensitive) and streptococcus (penicillin-sensitive but clindamycin and erythromycin-resistant).
Zosyn was changed to unasyn, but the patient clinically worsened and with concern for an undetected element of the likely polymicrobial sepsis which started his course, unasyn was discontinued and zosyn restarted.
Gram-positive cocci and more Proteus grew out of a wound culture as vascular surgery continued to follow, drain abscesses and debride tissue.
The GPCs ultimately proved to be pan-sensitive MSSA, and once this sensitivity was available, vancomycin was discontinued.
Eventually, zosyn was discontinued and unasyn was restarted, with no ill effects.
Flagyl was added for C. diff protection although he did not grow out C. diff--see below.
There was some concern, particularly from the infectious disease service (which had been consulted, and which had followed the patient in the past for recurrent C. diff) that he would not be able to endure a six-week course of antibiotics because of his short gut, past history of recurrent C. diff, and that an operation might be superior.
In consultation with the surgeons and the primary care physician (who also served as the hospital attending), and after the primary care physician had [**Name9 (PRE) 103662**] discussion with the patient of risks and benefits of non-operative management, amputation was deferred in favor of medical management.
The total course of antibiotics will be six weeks, with day 1 of effective antibiosis = [**5-29**].
Flagyl should be continued through this time, and then for seven days after (until [**7-17**]).
In detail, starting dates were: Zosyn and vanco: [**5-23**] (on admission) Zosyn replaced with unasyn: [**5-26**] Flagyl: [**5-26**] (pt has had recurrent C diff as above) Unasyn stopped and replaced again with Zosyn: [**5-27**] Vancomycin stopped [**6-3**] Zosyn stopped and replaced with Unasyn: [**6-3**] Ending dates for Unasyn and Flagyl: [**7-10**] and [**7-17**] respectively, as above.
# Chronic systolic heart failure and cardiomyopathy: In the MICU, the patient had an increased O2 requirement, 93% on 6L NC O2, with large R sided pleural effusion.
He has a lasix requirement at home and ultimately as sepsis and hypotension resolved, he was started back on lasix, first prn, and then 40 [**Hospital1 **] (his home dose); on [**6-9**] this was changed to 60 [**Hospital1 **].
At home prior to this admission he has been on digoxin and lisinopril.
In light of his continuing renal insufficiency these were not restarted though the lisinopril in particular should be given consideration for restarting at the earliest opportunity.
Pain control was adquate with Oxycontin, Oxycodone, and Dilauidid for breakthrough pain.
# Ventricular Tachycardia: Early in the admission, the patient had one episode of asymptomatic VT that developed in the setting of dopamine and low Mg, and in the setting of the immediate post-sepsis period.
He does not have an ICD in place but given that he is being treated for infection, EP felt it would be better to keep him on telemetry but defer ICD placement if indicated.
On [**6-25**] mg of po HCTZ was added to his diuretic regimen, and was given [**Hospital1 **], 30 minutes prior to furosemide administration.
# Diabetes: Maintained patient on insulin sliding scale; his NPH was restarted and was titrated up as the patient's PO intake increased and his scale requirements  increased.
# Hypercoagulability: The patient has had disastrous sequelae of clotting in the past including ischemic bowel and resulting short gut, and stroke; thus anticoagulation was scrupulously maintained.
The patient was kept on a heparin sliding scale for much of the admission in order to preserve operative options while also continuing anticoagulation which is provided by lovenox as an outpatient.
On [**6-11**], with anticipation of discharge and no further operations planned, [**Hospital1 **] Lovenox was started.
Factor Xa level was drawn in the pm of [**6-12**] after the third dose of lovenox was given, and found to be 0.43 U/mL.
Given the very real stressors of his hospitalization here, including the ongoing possibility that he might lose his foot and his mobility, it was assumed that some portion of his mood was reactive,  management was not changed.
As his medical situation stabilizes and improves, if his mood does not improve simultaneously, he may benefit from revisiting his treatment for depression.
# PPX: The patient was given heparin for thrombosis prophylaxis which was converted to LMWH as above, as well as a PPI per home regimen.
