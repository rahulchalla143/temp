Back in [**2113-4-24**] she underwent a sternotomy for coronary revascularization.
Each operation was basically a debridement operation of a sequestrum of left-sided dead cartilage with treatment with the V.A.C.
I felt that it was necessary for her to have a radical debridement this time and definitive flap closure.
We need to have definitive debridement and then placement of healthy muscular tissue, and definitive closure without any open wounds to get this closed.
