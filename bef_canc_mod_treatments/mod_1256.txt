[**2184-9-12**] CHEST RADIOGRAPH, PA AND LATERAL Dual-lead right pectoral pacemaker with right atrial and right ventricular leads is unchanged from prior studies.
Cardiomegaly is again noted, although the right heart border is now obscured by right basilar opacity which also obscures the right hemidiaphragm, consistent with moderate-sized pleural effusion and related atelectasis, although underlying pneumonic consolidation cannot be excluded.
IMPRESSIONS: Increased right basilar opacity, with increased and now moderate-sized right pleural effusion, and related atelectasis, although underlying pneumonic consolidation cannot be excluded.
[**2184-9-16**] VASCULAR U/S-GUIDED CATHETER PLACEMENT FINDINGS: 1.
Placement of tunneled 15.5 French x 27 cm cuff-to-tip angiodynamics hemodialysis catheter via the left internal jugular vein.
Incidental note is made of atrioventricular pacing wires in expected position placed through the right subclavian vein.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of left internal jugular tunneled hemodialysis catheter.
Volume overload was refractory to diuretic therapy due to worsening renal function.
Left IJ tunneled HD catheter was placed on [**9-16**] with subsequent initiation of hemodialysis that day, followed by [**9-17**], [**9-18**], [**9-20**], and [**9-21**].
Lasix and [**Last Name (un) **] were discontinued.
Phosphate binder therapy was not added as the calcium-phosphate product was approximately 18.
The patient will continue to receive HD as an outpatient.
Attributed to an effect of cephalosporin therapy but other possible offending medications including heparin, protonix, and atorvastatin were discontinued.
Indwelling catheter was flushed with citrate solution rather than heparin during HD sessions.
PF4 antibody was negative.
The patient will have a repeat CBC two days after discharge to continue to monitor platelet count.
She may continue to receieve erythropoeitin therapy as an adjunct to hemodialysis.
She was treated with 3 days of ceftriaxone until urine culture revealed ~1000 colonies MRSA, likely a skin contaminant.
#Atrial fibrillation - Anticoagulation was reversed with vitamin K and FFP prior to HD catheter placement.
Coumadin was resumed after the procedure with a goal INR 2.0-3.0.
The patient will be discharged with VNA services to monitor INR and adjust coumadin dosing accordingly.
#Hypertension - Blood pressure was low-normal during the hospitalization and metoprolol was decreased to 25 mg qHS due to concerns for hypotension, particularly in the setting of hemodialysis.
