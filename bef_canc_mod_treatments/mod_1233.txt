After receiving IV lasix in the ED, he was sent to the SICU.
On [**4-9**] a right thoracentesis was performed for 1.8 liters.
Fluid was sent for cell count, cytology and gram stain.
Lopressor was given and he was intubated for cardiogenic shock.
Vanco and Zosyn were started for concern for sepsis.
Cardiology was consulted and recommendations included diuresis with avoidance of ace inhibitors.
A P-MIBI was deferred as well.
BP improved and pressors were weaned off.
Lopressor was eventually switched to carvedilol with up titration of dose and hydralazine was added.
A lasix drip was started with increased  urine outputs.
On [**4-10**] he had ultrasound-guided drainage of a large left hepatic abscess.
Attempt at aspiration of the right-sided subdiaphragmatic collection revealed old hematoma, therefore a catheter was not placed.
Under CT, there was successful placement of a right-sided pigtail catheter with drainage of approximately 200 cc of pleural fluid.
Meropenum, fluc and vanco were continued per ID.
Vitamin K was given x3 days.
The left hepatic drain was removed without incident on [**4-24**].
A bile duct stent was removed.
The Right C line was removed and he had successful placement of a 38 cm double lumen PICC into the left basilic vein with tip terminating in the SVC.
IV heparin was initiated for this as well as for a left ventricle thrombus seen on TTE on [**4-17**] ( A moderate sized thrombus was seen in the left ventricle (~1.3 cm diameter).
Coumadin was started and heparin was stopped when he became therapeutic.
Inr was 3.0 on [**4-27**] on coumadin 3mg qd.
Coumadin was later stopped when he became supratherapeutic to 3.6 on [**5-8**].
Coumadin was not resumed.
He received FFP and 1 unit of PRBC for hct drop to 25.9.
Nutritionally, while intubated he received postpyloric feedings of Nutren renal.
Therefore, after reversal of his anticoagulation with FFP and Vit K, Interventional Pulmonary removed 2.2L of straw-colored fluid during right thoracocentesis and left a pigtail in place to drain.
His SBP was persistantly elevated on Carvedilol and hydralazine and a PA catheter was placed to assist with management.
His PA numbers were initially elevated along with his SVR, and his cardiac output/index was normal.
Isordil was started as well to aid with BP control.
He also had transient ATN with creatine rise leading to a hold on lasix on [**5-2**], that resolved by [**5-4**] and he was autodiuresing well with normalizing creatine.
TPN was started for 2 days only to aid in nutrional supplementation.
His blood sugars were elevated requiring a transient insulin gtt while on TPN.
By [**5-5**] he was off supplemental 02 by face mask and was able to tolerate POs and TPN was stopped.
On [**5-8**] he was transferred back to the SICU for hypotension after receiving overdiuresis after FFP for pleural tube removal.
He required Levophed and 1unit of PRBC.
Carvedilol and isordil were resumed as well as hydralazine.
Levaquin was initially started then switched to meropenum.
Meropenum was stopped and tobra was started.
Numerous surgical clips were present.
He had placement of a plastic biliary stent across the stricture and leak.
Thoracentesis was done on [**5-31**] of the left lung for 1.3 liters.
Post procedure CXR was improved.
A simple appearing fluid collection within the left inguinal canal possibly trapped from previous intra-abdominal ascites was noted.
Urology was consulted and recommended cipro 500mg [**Hospital1 **] x 3 weeks for epididymo-orchitis.
Immunosuppression for discharge consisted of prograf 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
Prednisone 2.5mg qd x 4 more days then off.
Pentamidine was also due and was to be scheduled as an outpatient.
