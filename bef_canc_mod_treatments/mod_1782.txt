She had been treated with coumadin, but was stopped due to difficult to control INR from concomitant antibiotic therapy.
She had also been treated with lovenox but this was stopped due to skin welts.
She was then treated with fondaparinaux but then developed an ICH.
Since late [**2146-9-25**] she has not been anticoagulated given the intracranial hemorrhage.
Past Medical History: ++ [**Location (un) **] syndrome - diagnosed age 23 - total colectomy, end ileostomy [**2121**] - small bowel resection (multiple) secondary to recurrent polyposis - subsequent short gut syndrome - on TPN since [**2123**], [**9-/2131**] ++ Benign cystadenoma - partial hepatectomy, [**2131**] ++ Line-associated blood stream infections - Her CVL in her L leg has been in place for at least 5 years, when she has had infections the line has been changed over a wire as pt has limited remaining access (L groin vessels and hepatic vessels are only usable vessels).

Overall, the blood products and edema measure 6.5 x 3.7 cm compared to 9.0 x 5.4 cm previously.
[**2146-11-25**] 8:00 pm (after heparin drip started) FINDINGS: A non-contrast CT of the head was obtained.
CXR: [**2146-11-28**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-13**] and [**10-31**].
Again noted is a right parietooccipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage, currently measuring 3.7 x 1.7 cm with evidence of evolution of blood products as evidenced by the diminishing size of the hyperdense central focus.
A heparin drip was started, and repeat head CT showed no progression of ICH.
Heparin drip was difficult to titrate due to inconsistent PTT values, and patient was switched to lovenox 70mg SC daily.
Coumadin PO was started and dose was titrated to an INR of [**12-28**].
Lovenox was stopped, once therapeutic on coumadin for two days.
On discharge she was taking coumadin 2mg PO daily, and had been at this does for four days prior to discharge.
ASD, paradoxical emboli: Consideration for percutaneous ASD closure could be considered as an outpatient, pending clinical improvement.
SHORT GUT SYNDROME: Patient was continued on TPN per nutrition recommendations.
She was discharged home with TPN managed by NutriShare.
Before discharge, extensive teaching was held with her family regarding the importance of line care, and how to perform ethanol and heparin flushes.
Headache: Patient was continued on her prior treatment of fentanyl patch and PO morhine prn.
The headache reolved later that day with PO morphine and she had no other HA during her stay.

You were treated with anticoagulants, initially heparin, follwed by lovenox (enoxaparin) and coumadin (warfarin).
Neurosurgery was consulted given your prior intracranial hemmorhage, and agreed with this course of anticoagulation.
The following changes were made in your medications: Please START warfarin 2mg by mouth daily  Please continue all other medications as you were before.
Please review all medication changes with your primary care physician.
Followup Instructions: Please follow up with the following appointments:  MD: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3608**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 22917**] Specialty: PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2897**]/ Time: [**Name Initial (PRE) 16337**], [**12-13**] at 1:00pm They will check your INR at this visit and advise you regarding your coumadin dose.
