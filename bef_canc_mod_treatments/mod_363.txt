Admission Date:  [**2165-9-12**]     Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2092-8-17**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient presented with a perforation in his left anterior descending artery, just distal to occluded saphenous vein graft during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He is a 73 year old man, with history of coronary artery disease, including two prior coronary artery bypass grafts; myocardial infarction in [**2139**] and a lung nodule.
In catheterization, all the grafts were occluded, except for the saphenous vein graft to the right posterolateral artery.
However, his saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending was occluded and as the attempt was made to open up occluded vessel, the distal part of the catheter perforated the left anterior descending coronary artery and led to a small amount of extravasation of dye.
