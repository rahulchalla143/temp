Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 47 yo male w/ PMHx sig for HIV/AIDS off anti-retroviral therapy, pancreatitis, depression who was in his USOH last PM when he awoke this AM from sleep with acute onset abdominal pain.
Therefore he was transferred to the ICU and intubated for tachypnea and respiratory failure due to increasing metabolic acidosis.
Though this appeared to be neuroleptic malignant syndrome, he had not recieved any medications that could be implicated.
He was intubated for decreased mental status and respirtory alkalosis [**1-9**] to rigid rib cage and decreased inspiratory effort.
He was treated with broad spectum antibiotics (no antifungals per ID), aggressive fluid repletion, and aggressive electrolyre repletions.
For antibiotics, he was initially started on Imipenem but was changed to Zosyn due to leukopenia.
He continued to retain fluid in pleural effusions, ascites, and RP edema.
He underwent a paracentesis which by WBC was positive for SBP though the culture did not grow out.
On the floor, he seemed very slow and lethargic, but improved as we discontinued multiple psych medications he was getting (standing haldol 2.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], olanzapine prn, ativan).
When he was getting TPN, he required insulin sliding scale, but his FS has been normal after TPN was discontinued.
