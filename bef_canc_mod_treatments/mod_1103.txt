He was initially started on Vancomycin and Zosyn due to concern for sacral decubitus ulcer infection and possible osteomyelitis v. pneumonia.
The IV antibiotics were discontinued after 2 days as he underwent surgical debridement, which was felt to be the definitive treatment.
He also was found to have C. diff colitis and started on oral flagyl.
He was tachypneic and minimally responsive on arrival so was intubated and sedated with fentanyl and midazolam.
In the peri-intubation setting, he went into rapid afib with mild V4-V6 ST depressions captured on EKG; the RVR resolved with IV fluids.
Post-intubation CXR showed LLL infiltrates which were difficult to assess given his post-lobectomy changes.
Blood cultures were drawn, and patient started on vancomycin and Zosyn.
During his ED course, he received a total of 3L IVF with SBPs ranging from 79 to low 100s.
On the floor, pt appeared comfortable, intubated and sedated.
Past Medical History: - Severe dementia, unable to complete any ADL's on his own - S/p LUL lobectomy for spiculated mass: 3.3 cm adenocarcinoma with all regional lymph nodes negative, T2a, N0.
Then, L sided effusion s/p thoracocentesis [**8-/2106**] - Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, h/o RVR on initial diagnosis  - h/o DVT in RLE, [**4-/2106**] Tx'd with Lovenox - h/o TIA - colonic adenoma - hypothyroidism - Anemia - Osteoarthritis, s/p total L hip replacement, s/p total R knee  replacement - h/o tibial fracture - spondylosis of the lumbosacral spine - h/o Gastric ulcer - h/o urinary retention requiring Foleys - h/o GIB in [**2-8**], presumed to be lower source, resolved on own.
ABDOMEN: Soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding, clean stoma with no raw erythema, ostomy in place with soft brown stool; foley in place EXTREMITIES: WWP, no c/c, trace pretibial edema, with R leg with mild skin darkening and slightly more swelling, 2+ peripheral pulses.
NEURO: sedated, PERRLA, withdraws to deep pain RECTAL: decubitus (stage 4) on left presacral area, wound vac in place with no surrounding drainage .

Endotracheal tube in standard position.
Right sided pleural-based nodules and 5-mm nodule in the left lower lobe are likely part and parcel with the infectious process.
CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube.
The tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach.
Tip of the endotracheal tube is visible in unchanged location.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 year-old man with a history of lung adenocarcinoma s/p LUL lobectomy, DVT, afib on Coumadin, GI bleed, chronic stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer s/p diverting colostomy and surgical debridement, and mostly nonverbal at baseline from severe dementia who presents with worsened mental status, fever, and hypoxic respiratory distress.
Upon transfer to the floor an additional family meeting was held with the help of Palliative Care and it was decided that goals of care would shift towards being comfort focused.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Distress (MICU course): On arrival to ED patient had O2 sats of 82% on NRB and was minimally responsive.
Post-intubation CXR showed bibasilar infiltrates and patient was started on vanco/zosyn for broad HCAP coverage given recent hospitalization.
He was maintained on CMV and ultimately weaned down to PSV.
Family decided to continue antibiotics, but not to further escalate care and not to transfer back to the ICU.
S/P intubation and mechanical ventilation and initially on broad antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn); however, upon transfer to the Medicine floor the regimen was narrowed to Vancomycin alone given his endotracheal sputum culture grew coag + staph aureus.
Supplemental oxygen was provided as needed.
Clinically, WBC improved and stool well-formed in colostomy.
He was continued on Flagyl 500 mg TID (last day [**2107-6-20**]).
He is s/p I&D, diverting colostomy, surgical debridement, antibiotic therapy, and repeat debridement last in 5/[**2107**].
Wound vac was removed in the ICU.
-Contie wound care recs .
Coumadin was held given therapeutic INR on admission and initiation of antibiotics.
Initially continued ASA 81 mg, simvastatin 20 mg and Metoprolol; however, given change in goals of care to focusing on comfort measures these medications were discontinued.
Currently underway on 2-week course of Flagyl for positive C diff with resolution of symptoms.
