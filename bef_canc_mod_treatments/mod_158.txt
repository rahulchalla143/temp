Admission Date:  [**2142-5-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-5-16**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: I&D of R anterior leg hematoma Transesophageal echocardiogram  History of Present Illness: 82 year-old woman with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, complaining of increasing fatigue over the last 10 days.
She was noted to have increasing pedal edema at this week's dialysis, and an additional 3# of fluid was removed the day prior to admission.
She recently had Imdur 30mg PO qD added to her regimen for CP control during a recent admission for chest pain/SOB in context of two missed HD appointments, during which she was ruled out, noted to have no ECG changes, and did not have further CAD w/u done due to clean coronaries on [**2137**] cath.
Of note, however, ECGs from [**Hospital1 498**]-[**Hospital1 107**] demonstrated AF on [**4-10**] ECG, and not on previous [**3-18**] ECG.
Apparently had ARF from acyclovir given for Shingles, along with possible contrast nephropathy.
Has been receiving HD in [**Hospital1 1559**] through Hickman catheter for last six months.
Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information section).
Local anesthesia was provided by benzocaine topical spray.
0.1 mg of IV glycopyrrolate was given as an antisialogogue prior to TEE probe insertion.
Kept generally euvolemic, as borderline low BPs did not allow for aggressive diuresis, and extra fluid was taken off during hemodialysis, which was continued while in-house.
Switched BB to Toprol XL, and continued diltiazem SR for HOCM and diastolic dysfunction while in-house.
Kept on heparin to coumadin bridge for anticipated anticoagulation for minimum 4 weeks before repeat TEE to reconsider cardioversion.
Plastic surgery performed I&D, and evacuated large hematoma, which had intermittent bleeding while bridging to coumadin.
Coumadin was held prior to discharge for supratherapeutic INR (4.7 on AM of discharge).
INR should be checked every day, and coumadin restarted at 2mg PO qHS once INR falls below 3.5.
Denies F/C/NS or bowel symptoms, but will be very important to have colonoscopy as outpatient to r/o colon CA.
Pain control was provided as needed .
