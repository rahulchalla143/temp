ICU course was significant for:  # SEPSIS Mr. [**Known lastname 53270**] was admitted to the ICU in septic shock after bilateral ureteral stent change.
He has been admitted for severe sepsis after GU procedures on multiple occasions since his neobladder surgery in [**Month (only) 956**].
On admission to the ICU, the patient was requiring multiple pressors and was started on treatment with linezolid and zosyn.
He was slowly weaned off pressors and transferred back to the urology service when hemodynamically stable.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION The patient presented to the ICU from the PACU with heart rates in the 130s-150s, which appeared consistent with prior post-op course and contributing to his hypotension.
Triggers, likely multifactorial, likely included post-op stress, hypovolemia, and infection.
He was started on an amiodarone drip, which controlled his rhythm.
Prior to transfer back to the urology service, he was started on low-dose beta-blocker, which is to be increased back to his home dose of metoprolol prior to discharge from the hospital.
Lasix boluses were used to increase his urine output and keep his potassium in check.
# DIARRHEA The patient presented with stool incontinence.
On POD 8, the foley catheter was removed and the patient continued to be incontinent as he was prior to admission.
He was discharged in stable condition on POD 10, creatinie trending down, WBC normal, with a PICC line in place for 13 more doses of Zosyn and oral Vancomycin to be taken for two days following Zosyn.
VNA services were arranged for the administration of antibiotics and subsequent removal of PICC line and in home physical therapy.
