Admission Date:  [**2139-9-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-9-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-9-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Tape [**1-25**]"X10YD / Augmentin / Hydrocodone / Levofloxacin / Ciprofloxacin / morphine / fentanyl  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea, Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Ultrasound-guided renal biopsy CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation)   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 35 y/o F with a h/o Type I DM, HTN, CKD, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, depression, and osteoperosis who was recently on the SIRS service on [**2139-9-15**] when she had a 2 minute cardiac arrest, requiring 5 rounds of CPR, immediately following a renal biopsy prompting a 1-day admission to the MICU, who now presents back to the SIRS service with hypoxia, continuing bilateral pleural effusions, and concern for mixed respiratory acidemia/metabolic alkalemia of multi-factorial etiology.
At that time, the patient was breathing comfortably on room air following aggressive diruesis, with consistent O2Sats > 95%.
She was discharged on Lasix 20 MG PO QD, and soon redeveloped shortness of breath, LE edema and lethargy prompting her re-presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2139-9-12**].
She was aggressively diuresed with IV Lasix 40 MG [**Hospital1 **] overnight, and was then transferred to the SIRS service on [**2139-9-14**] after a noticeable improvement in her breathing.
Given the presence and recurrent nature of her bilateral pleural effusions, we continued IV Lasix 40 MG [**Hospital1 **] and consulted the Rheumatology and Renal teams.
Both teams agreed that the patient should pursue a renal biopsy, which was performed on [**2139-9-15**], and subsequently she had a cardiac arrest.
During the procedure, the patient received Versed 100 MG and Fentanyl 100 MG, and was conscious and able to follow instructions during the procedure.
No medication was administered during the event and she was placed on O2 and then transfered to the MICU.
In the MICU, she was monitored and was stable other than one episode of hypoglycemia with a blood sugar of 14 on the [**2139-9-16**], that was immediately managed with IV D50 and she responded appropriately with improved alertness and appropriate mental status.
A CTA ruled out pulmonary embolus.
The patient was immediately placed on 4L NC and her O2Sats increased back to the 90s.
Poorly controlled per recent records, with the exception of during her pregnancy when she required TPN (with insulin it) for hyperemesis.
Status post C section at 33 weeks because of hyperemesis.
Accquired hemophilia (FVIII inhibitor in [**2132**]) treated with steroids and rituximab 7.
Osteoporosis ([**2138-11-12**] T-score lumbar spine -2.2, femoral neck -3.1) .
Past Surgical History: - Cesarean section ([**2132**]) - Laparoscopic appendectomy ([**2132**]) - TAB [**3-31**] - Proximal gastroduodenal artery embolization - Excision of a skin mole - Achilles avulsion repair  Social History: The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol, transfusion in [**2132**].

CXR ([**2139-9-16**]): As compared to the prior examination, there is improved aeration at the lung bases with improvement in atelectasis and effusions as well as vascular congestion.
Two splenic hypodensities, the anterior lesion subcentimeter in size and stable, the second 14-mm lesion along the hilum demonstrates increase in size since [**2136-11-2**].
Differential includes but not limited to cysts, hamartoma, hemangioma, or lymphangioma.
1.5 cm septated right renal cyst without internal vascularity, with thin septations measure no greater than 1 mm.
She was monitored overnight in the ICU without any problems other than hypoglycemia the next morning in the setting of being NPO and receiving NPH insulin.
Cardiogenic pulmonary edema was thought to be unlikely given her recent normal echo and cardiac MRI.
She received antibiotics in the ED and these were stopped upon admission to the ICU.
She had no fevers, tachycardia, or signs of infection and was diuresed 3L of fluid with improvement of her O2 saturations to the mid 90s on 2L NC O2.
She was transferred to the floor and continued to improve on IV Lasix 40 MG [**Hospital1 **] when she was sent for a renal biopsy per the recommendation of both the Renal and Rheumatology teams.
ABGs obtained on 4L and RA revealed a picture of hypercarbia likely from narcotic medication administration and poor inspiratory effort from pleural effusions, chest pain due to CPR and healing rib fractures, in addition to hypoxemia likely from V/Q mismatch given elevated A-a gradient and improvement on oxygen.
The patient was given IV Lasix and kept on 4L of O2 and was slowly weaned off until she was stable on room air with appropriate ambulatory sats, over approximately 3-4 days.
The patient's creatinine on admission was 1.6, which improved initially following diuresis, but then became elevated to 2.6, 48h after a CT scan, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy.
The patient was not given IV fluids and instead was encouraged to take in PO fluids allow for self-regulation.
Within 3 days, her creatinine downtrended to 1.3 and she was subsequently started on torsemide 40 MD QD instead of Lasix, and the following day back on her home dose of valsartan 160 MG PO QD.
Repeat K+ after administration of Kayexylate gave a repeat [**Location (un) 1131**] of 4.2 and the patient had a stable K+, with occasional need for repletion with potassium chloride following initiation of diuresis.
However, a few days prior to discharge, the patient's K+ was elevated to > 5.0 following initiation of valsartan and thus we administered Kayexylate and discontinued the patient's valsartan.
She was given a diabetic diet.
She was placed on her ISS as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 9718**] recommendations and plans to follow-up with them regarding an insulin pump upon discharge.
# Hypertension: The patient was continued on her home regimen of amlodipine and metoprolol.
A limited supply of tramadol was provided to her at discharge.
[**Last Name (un) **] will be discussing the option of an insulin pump as an outpatient.

You were given intravenous furosemide (lasix) to help remove the fluid and you appropriately responded to the medication.
You recovered following the CPR and did not require any medications during the code.
When transfered back to the floor on [**2139-9-16**], you had an additional acute oxygen desaturation, but were placed on 4L of oxygen and given intravenous Lasix and you recovered well.
We closely watched your oxygen levels and you appropriately came off oxygen and had appropriate levels on room air and on the day of discharge.
Once improved, we started you a new diuretic known as Torsemide once a day for continual removal of fluid at a dose of 20 MG per day.
MEDICATION CHANGES: 1) CONTINUE Torsemide 20 MG once a day 2) STOP valsartan for now .
