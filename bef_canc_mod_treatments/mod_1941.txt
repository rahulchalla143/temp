During positioning on the OR table on [**9-22**] he had NSVT for ~3 beats (no strip available), followed by monomorphic sustained VT with hypotension (SBP of ~40) during preparation of the operation site.
In the CCU, post-op electrolytes were drawn and were normal,and he was started on amiodarone.
He was placed in a C-spine collar and received CT C-spine per neurosurgery recommendations which showed substantial narrowing of spinal canal which could represent old stenosis but would be potentially worrisome for acute cord impingement.
During this time, patient's neuro exam gradually resolved with improved L arm strength, then R arm strength, ultimately with improvement to what patient states is his baseline.

The surgery was aborted to cardiac arrhytmias discussed below, but completed on [**9-23**] with placement of a dynamic hip screw.
Patient should receive anticoagulation for 4 weeks with a target INR of 1.5-2.0, and followup at the orthopedic in 2 weeks.
The patient was kept on amiodarone during his time in the CCU, but per EP it was felt that continued therapy was not indicated at this time and so this was discontinued while the patient was in the unit.
Patient should not stop ASA for any minor surgeries in the future as he has a DES -> LMCA.
