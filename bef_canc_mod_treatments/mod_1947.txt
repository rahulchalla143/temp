HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was treated by the medical service and cardiology for her congestive heart failure that she presented with in preparation for cardiac catheterization and repeat echocardiogram.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient was diuresed and ultimately received echocardiogram on [**2150-12-8**], which showed global left ventricular hypokinesis, bilateral atrial enlargement, moderate aortic stenosis with two plus aortic insufficiency, one to two plus mitral regurgitation, and depressed right ventricular function.
The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] of cardiothoracic surgery for aortic valve replacement with a question of mitral valve replacement versus repair.
She was seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7625**] of cardiothoracic surgery who noted her prior history of bicuspid aortic valve, mitral valve prolapse and her history of left breast cancer, status post chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery with Adriamycin.
Of note, the patient also had left upper extremity lymphedema from her prior lumpectomy and axillary node dissection.
She had two plus bilateral carotid pulses, no palpable radial pulses, and one plus bilateral femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for evaluation of double valve surgery with additional studies to be done including the completion of her echocardiogram which was done on [**2150-12-8**].
Additional studies were recommended by hepatology service.
Preoperatively on [**2150-12-6**], the patient had an episode of left sided chest pain and was given intravenous Morphine and a bolus of normal saline.
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed and the patient was then intubated on [**2150-12-7**], by anesthesia given her aortic stenosis and increasing respiratory distress with respiratory rate over 30 and an unobtainable peripheral oxygen saturation.
Central venous line and Swan-Ganz was placed as mentioned previously.
At the time of cardiac catheterization on [**2150-12-8**], the patient underwent aortic valve balloon valvuloplasty in the catheterization laboratory.
This was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and cardiothoracic surgery service continued to follow from a distance preoperatively for potential aortic valve surgery.
She was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
The patient was also evaluated by the case manager for cardiothoracic surgery in preparation for her hospitalization and potential surgery.
Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] evaluated the patient on [**2150-12-10**], and noted that her situation was improving but was planned for surgery only once her liver function tests recovered.
Preoperative stroke risk was also evaluated by the stroke attending who recommended carotid ultrasound and MRI/MRA of the brain as well as tight glucose control.
Ativan was discontinued and neurologic examination was followed daily.
The patient did have some chest pressure briefly with tachycardia that resulted from the atrial fibrillation and was given Diltiazem and beta blocker with relief.
Nitropride was stopped on [**2150-12-14**].
Captopril was started with a goal systolic arterial blood pressure of greater than 110.
Urine culture showed E. coli with Bactrim resistance.
The patient's antibiotics were changed to Ciprofloxacin with a four to seven day course and was given Miconazole cream.
The patient was reevaluated by cardiac surgery on [**2150-12-15**], who noted her decreasing liver function tests and the fact that she had been cleared by neurology for cardiac surgery and heparinization.
The patient's preference was for mechanical valve and the plan was to schedule the patient for aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement on the following Friday.
The patient was seen again by the stroke service on [**2150-12-16**], and was evaluated again by the congestive heart failure service to make sure her diuresis and volume status had been optimized.
Additional preoperative laboratories on [**2150-12-17**], prior to surgery were as follows:  White blood cell count 11.6, hematocrit 35.8, platelet count 348,000.
Potassium 4.3, blood urea nitrogen 21, creatinine 0.5, ALT 194, AST 34, alkaline phosphatase 72, total bilirubin 1.2.
Antibiotics were given empirically prior to her valve replacement.
The patient remained on Ciprofloxacin also in addition to her usual medications prior to surgery.
On[**2150-12-18**], the patient underwent aortic valve replacement with a 23 millimeter pericardial valve and mitral valve replacement with a 29 millimeter pericardial valve by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2545**] and was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on an Epinephrine drip of 0.03 mcg/kg/minute, Nitroglycerin drip at 1.0 mcg/kg/minute and Propofol drip at 20 mcg/kg/minute.
The patient was given Aspirin and Toradol for pain.
Her chest tubes remained in place and Lasix diuresis was begun.
Carvedilol and Amiodarone was started.
The patient also continued with perioperative Vancomycin and was otherwise alert and oriented in no apparent distress and doing well with an unremarkable examination.
Lisinopril was also started low dose at 2.5 mg.
Chest tubes were discontinued.
Pacer wires remained in place with a plan for the patient to be transferred out to the floor the following day on postoperative day three.
The patient continued to do very well and was alert and oriented and continued with Lisinopril and Carvedilol.
Pacing wires were discontinued.
Heparin and Coumadin were both given.
Amiodarone was switched over to p.o.
The patient's Foley was discontinued and the patient was transferred out to the floor.
The patient continued to be anticoagulated with Heparin while her Coumadin dose continued to raise her INR.
The patient had some incisional pain which was medicated with Tylenol number three.
The patient was ambulating with assistance, continued to make very good progress, did a level three on postoperative day four, was restarted on her preoperative medications with the addition of Carvedilol and the Amiodarone.
Her postoperative atrial fibrillation had converted to sinus rhythm on Amiodarone and Lopressor.
The patient also received Milk of Magnesia and an evening dose of Coumadin 3 mg that day.
Amiodarone was decreased to 400 mg twice a day from three times a day.
The patient remained on a Heparin drip.
Lipitor was discontinued given her recent elevated liver function tests without any evidence of coronary disease.
The patient continued to stay on the floor and work with physical therapy and the nurses to improve her activity level and tolerance while we waited for her INR to rise.
Carvedilol was increased to 6.25 mg p.o.
The patient also had a small amount of back pain which was also medicated with Tylenol number three.
When her INR hit 2.1, her Heparin drip was discontinued.
A liter of saline bolus was given and the patient was placed back in bed.
Her Lasix diuresis was discontinued.
The patient was restarted on her home dose of Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
The patient was seen again by case management on [**2150-12-28**], in preparation for discharge, hopefully with VNA services.
