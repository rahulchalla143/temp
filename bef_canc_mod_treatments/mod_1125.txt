Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):       STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
# Hypotension/Shock: This is likely secondary to hypovolemic shock in setting of DKA and osmotic diuresis as well as multiple days of nausea and vomiting.
He was treated emperically with cipro/flagyl in the ED, but these were d/c'ed after c.diff was found to be negative.
After aggressive fluid resuscitation and pressors (norepinephrine), his BP increased and SBP remained stable 90-100.
Possible etiology could be due esophagitis leading to difficulty swallowing with decreased po intake vs noncompliance to insulin medication.
10 units of IV insulin and insulin drip at 10U per hour was started in ED.
Anion gap normalized at 0300 on [**2133-11-18**] and insulin drip was stopped several hours later and pt was started on glargine.
Patient is currently on 22U daily of glargine, HISS, and diabetic diet with FSG in 200s.
Vancomycin initially started prior to speciation and discontinued after speciation.
Has been typed and screened on PPI, off fluconazole, which was put on by GI after last admission for empiric treatment of [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis (day1=[**10-17**], 2wk course).
This is likely secondary to volume depletion in the setting of osmotic diuresis from DKA (above).
Pt denies chest pain, his ECG was reassuring without signs of ischemia, and troponins have trended down (though still elevated to 0.4).
Will follow up with outpatient cardiology and continue aspirin, atorvastatin, and metoprolol.
# Hypertension: Pt's home metoprolol was held in the setting of hypotension and was restarted [**11-18**] after hypotension resolved.
