She was admitted to the ICU and started on empiric treatment for meningitis.

She was transferred back to the ICU where she received 10 units of PRBC's and 8 units of FFP.
The patient was diuresed with lasix once hemodynamically stable and extubated without complication.

She was later controlled with amiodarone and metoprolol.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Cardiac Electrophysiology and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] of Cardiothoracic Surgery were eventually consulted and recomended a mini-Maze procedure.
