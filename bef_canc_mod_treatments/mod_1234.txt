[**Hospital3 26615**] urine culture growing GNR and proteus (no sensitivities at the time of discharge), and patient was placed on ciprofloxacin.
In addition, some of his medications could be contributing to his low blood pressure, such as morphine, multiple types of benzodiazepines, baclofen.
Please follow up urine culture sensitivities from [**Hospital3 26615**] and pending urine and blood cultures from [**Hospital1 18**], as patient may require an antibiotic change if he grows a resistant organism.
Polypharmacy in the setting of numerous sedating medications vs. infection was determined to be the most likely etiology of AMS.
Patient was started on ciprofloxacin as above.
Atrial fibrillation: Patient was maintained on telemetry.
His head CT showed no signs of intracranial bleed, and he was restarted on his home coumadin dose.
Chronic pain: Morphine sulfate SR QID was changed to Morphine Sulfate IR QID given concern for sedation contributing to hypotension.

History of PE: Patient has an IVC filter and is treated with coumadin.
Coumadin was restarted as above.
Psychosis NOS: Patient was continued on clonazepam and Prozac  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Follow up urine culture GNR sensitivities from [**Hospital3 26615**].
