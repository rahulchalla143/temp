Admission Date:  [**2147-2-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2147-2-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-8-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Paracentesis x 2 Thoracentesis RIJ central venous line placement Hemodialysis catheter placement Hemodialysis  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 32595**] is a 55 yo male with EtOH cirrhosis (hx of SBP and hepatic encephalopathy), DM who presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) 948**] office today for a regular appointment.
[**Name (NI) **] was recently admitted at [**Hospital3 **] for 5 days for RLE cellulitis in which he was d/c's one week ago and finished a course of keflex 2 days ago.
He was recetnly of his lasix dose during that stay [**1-16**] increased creatinine, but it was restarted upon his discharge.
His home dose of aldactone was stopped 1.5 weeks ago.
He has had no other changes in his medications and ocntinues to take his lactulolse, titrated to [**4-19**] BMs daily.
In the ED, he recieved a 500cc bolus with improvement in his BP to 101/59.
A paracentesis was not performed reportedly because of concern about his platelets being 21 and INR 1.8.
- On [**Hospital3 **] list after a recent 40lb weight loss - Multiple admissions to [**Hospital3 3583**] and [**Hospital1 18**] for hepatic encephalopathy - s/p TIPS [**2137**] with frequent revisions [**11/2145**] and then closure  in [**4-/2146**] secondary to hepatic encephalopathy # Pancytopenia -Chronic from underlying liver disease -Baseline HCT in mid 20s -Baseline platelets in 20-40 # CKD with baseline Cr 1.0 # DM2, insulin dependent # s/p cholecystectomy for porcelain gallbladder in [**10/2145**] # Carcinoid tumor in gastric fundus # OSA (doesn't use his home BiPAP) # Squamous cell skin ca on left shoulder # Morbid Obesity # Chronic Venous Stasis  Social History: Lives with his wife.
He previously worked as the director of food & beverage services on a cruiseline in the Hawaiian islands.
Brief Hospital Course: MEDICINE Course: 55 yo with EtOH cirrhosis admitted for hypotension who was found to have ESBL Ecoli PNA and new ARF believed to be 2/2 HRS now on HD but may also have a component of ATN from hypotension.
He was transferred off of Medicine for a liver [**Year (4 digits) **].
Encephalopathy was managed with high doses of lactulose and rifamixin.
Started on metoprolol with good effect.
Improved with management of his PNA and high doses of lactulose + rifaximin 600 mg PO BID.
Renal failure: Concern for HRS with worsening creatinine despite IVF and albumin.
Nephrology involved and patient had tunneled SC right side placed [**2147-2-13**], started HD [**2147-2-13**].
Treated with meropenem for known Ecoli and Klebsiella PNA.
Plan for total of 14 days of treatment to be completed on [**2147-2-24**], but transferred to surgery prior to that time.
He initially received significant fluid resuscitation, albumin, and blood products with refractory blood pressure.
Nonetheless, infectious work-up was pursued with a diagnostic paracentesis performed at time of admission to the ICU.
He was started empirically on Levofloxacin for empiric coverage of a community-acquire pneumonia.
Due to persistently low BP's, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was performed to rule out adrenal insufficiency with appropriate result 11.7 -> 19.7.
His home dose of Nadolol was held.
A central line was placed and CVP measured at 33, following fluid resuscitation.
BP's remained low for ~24 hours in the ICU, and antibiotic coverage was subsequently broadened to Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Levofloxacin.
Sputum culture eventually grew an ESBL e.coli and pan-sensitive klebsiella organism.
Vancomycin was discontinued, and patient was continued on Meropenem.
Foley placement attempt was unsuccessful and Urology was called.
Per Liver consult recommendations, patieht was started on standing albumin, midodrine, and octreotide for presumed hepatorenal syndrome.
On [**2-13**] a hemodialysis catheter was placed by IR, and HD was initiated without incident.
He was continued on Rifaximin and Lactulose.
4) Coagulopathy:  He required multiple transfusions of platelets and FFP in effort to modify his coagulopathy for invasive procedures, including CVL placement, paracentesis, HD line placement, and thoracentesis.
His home dose of NPH was discontinued, and he was continued on sliding scale insulin.
6) Pleural effusion:  s/p dignostic thoracentesis on [**2-10**] with removal of 1 liter serosanguinous fluid, consistent with transudate.
After his abdomen was closed, he remained critically ill with pressor requirements.
He was urgently decompressed with a 16gauge angiocatheter needle -- a formal 28Fr chest tube was then inserted at the bedside.
His oxygenation and pressures improved after these interventions.
On POD [**1-15**], he required multiple pressors to maintain his blood pressures.
His ionized calcium levels were persistently below 1.0, and his pressures transiently improved with calcium supplementation.
Given this complication, there were extensive discussions with the family about the patient's prognosis, and they chose to make him comfort measures only.
