Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  76 yo F w/ h/o pancreatic cancer, currently receiving chemotherapy who presented with fever and hypotension requiring pressors: pt initially admitted to ICU for r/o sepsis.
She was started on levophed in the ED and after 12 hours in ICU levofed was successfully weaned and BP was stable.
Pt had initially been started on cipro and flagyl for weakly positive UA and empiric coverage for possible intra-abdominal process.
These antibiotics were stopped shortly thereafter due to lack of data c/w infectious etiology (see below).
We were able to restart her atenolol but ACE was held on discharge, to be restarted as tolerated as an outpatient.
# Diarrhea: Pt was continued on home viokase for pancreatic enzyme replacement.
She also takes immodium and lomotil for chronic diarrhea.
Pt was transfused a total of 2 units pRBCs with appropriate HCT response.
Also received 1 unit platelets (see below).
Likely that fever on presentation was due to a viral URI, given history of rhinorrhea and sore throat.
Because Cx data was negative cipro and flagyl were discontinued on the day that she was called out from the MICU.
# Hx of PE: treated with coumadin at home.
Was transfused 1 unit of platelets (nadir value was 40 with bleeding), with resolution of epistaxis.
Resumed coumadin regimen prior to d/c, but was still not therapeutic prior to discharge.
