Regarding her complaints, she reports that her BP medications have been adjusted, but this has not helped.
She has also experienced intermittent L-sided sharp chest pains that worsen with arm movement, and was prescribed nitroglycerin that she ended up taking daily instead of on a PRN basis.
She was bolused 500 cc, given Vancomycin and Zosyn, and started on Levophed at 0.06.
CT C/A/P were obtained and prelim only significant for a right adenexal cyst (present since [**Month (only) 404**]).
CI and SVI improved with leg raise so Pt was given 250 cc, then on repeat given additional 250 cc.

Hypotension is likely secondary to a too aggressive antihypertensive regimen, current medication misuse, or possibly over-diuresis at HD (with need for reassessment of dry weight).
Additionally she was started on nitroglycerin and had been taking it daily rather than on a PRN basis.
She was started initially on road spectrum antibiotics which were quickly discontinued when all cultures were negative.
TSH, free T4, and AM Cortisol obtained and pt restarted home levothyroxine dose for significant hypothyroidism.
