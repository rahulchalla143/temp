The patient was maintained on a 100% face mask initially and did not require intubation through his course.
He was initially maintained on broadspectrum antibiotics including Zosyn and Vancomycin with eventual addition of caspofungin and Azithromycin (for consideration of Legionella) as per ID's recommendation.
As the patient's white count was noted to be dropping, Vanc and Zosyn (both may have this effect) was changed to Meropenem and Azthromycin without caspofungin, the regimen which the patient is currently on upon transfer to the floor.
The patient is still currently taking Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
The patient was treated with the antibiotic regimens as detailed above and was additionally diuresed for question of pulmonary edema as exacerbating factor.

Pneumonia - The patient was transferred from the MICU to the floor with multilobar PNA and sepsis, likely secondary to immunosuppression s/p orthotopic liver transplant.
On transfer the patient was continued on Meropenem and Azithromycin and was followed by ID.
The patient demonstrated significant improvement in his pneumonia clinically and radiographically without further need for oxygen requirement.
The patient was maintained on Meropenem and Azithromycin with Bactrim ppx for the majority of his admission with plan for total course of therapy of 14 days.
This was switched to levofloxacin prior to D/C per I.D's recommendation with planned course of therapy for 3 additional days on D/C to complete a 14 day course of abx.
As detailed in H+P, all sputum and blood cultures were unrevealing including extensive workup for atypical pathogens including crypto, CMV,EBV,legionella,AFB, and chlamydia Pneumoniae.
S/p Liver Transplant - The patient was admitted s/p orthotopic liver transplant for indications of HCC and hepatocellular carcinoma.
The patient's immunosuppression regimen was modified this admission secondary to leukopenia.
On admission the patient was maintained with rapamycin and CellCept with discontinuance of CellCept and change in rapamycin dosing from 1mg po qd to 2mg po qd as dictated by serum drug levels.
The patient will continue to have his immunosuppressive regimen and transplant function monitored very carefully as an outpatient.
Pain control was difficult and the patient's pain regimen underwent a number of revisions during his hospitalization.
On admission the patient was on a regimen including Oxycontin 10mg po bid, Neurontin 100mg po bid and Percocet PRN.
The patient was initially maintained with PRN oxycodone with addition of a Fentanyl patch for long acting control.
This was subsequently changed per the patient's request back to oxycontin with oxycodone rescue.
However, this resulted in recrudescence of the patient's pain for which his pain regimen was changed back to a Fentanyl Patch with standing oxycodone q 4hours (with refusal allowed) as well as an increase in Neurontin from 100mg po bid to tid.
The patient was not overly sedated with this regimen and was discharged with a final regimen of Fentanyl Patch 75mcg, Oxycodone 5mg po q4-6hr PRN and Neurontin 100mg po tid as well as plans towards ongoing pain management consultation as an outpatient.
Leukopenia - The patient developed a leukopenia with nadir ANC as low as 800.
Thought likely to be secondary to a drug effect, the patient underwent first alterations in his antibiotic regimen from Zosyn and Vanc to [**Last Name (un) 2830**] and Azithro as detailed above.
As this change did not result in improvement in the patient's leukopenia, it was thought most likely that his immunosuppressive regimen was likely responsible.
Given this, CellCept was discontinued and rapamycin was continued, dosed by levels.
The patient was started on neupogen with subsequent jump in WBC in one day from 1.4 to 10.8.
Neupogen was discontinued and the patient's white count was monitored.
The patient was discharged with rapamycin alone with plans to continue to monitor WBC as well as LFTs to guide the most appropriate level of immunosuppression as an outpatient.
Hypothyroidism: The patient was continued on his outpatient dose of Synthroid 75 mcg qd .
Hypertension - The patient's outpatient regimen of Lopressor 50mg po bid and Norvasc 5mg po qd was initially held given the patient's hypotension on admission.
During his MICU course, Lopressor was reintroduced with introduction of Lisinopril 5mg po qd instead of Norvasc, likely secondary to history of DM, although most recent HgA1C 5.5% and patient is off DM meds.
The patient was discharged with regimen of Lopressor 50mg po bid and Lisinopril 5mg po qd with follow up arranged as an outpatient.
