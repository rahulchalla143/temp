[**Hospital1 18**] Microbiology: [**2145-10-30**] Urine culture: > 100,000 E. coli   Brief Hospital Course: 33F with hx of NHL (at 3yo) s/p XRT in remission, radiation induced Meningioma s/p resection [**6-16**] c/b L pontine stroke who presents from OSH with complaints of CP and SOB, found to have saddle PE and RLE DVT.
She was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for further management.
However, given her severe RV strain and RLE DVT, an IVC filter was placed on [**2145-10-29**].
She began lovenox bridge to warfarin at 5mg daily on [**2145-10-29**].
Recommended at least 6-12 months of anticoagulation, consideration of ongoing anti-coagulation.
IVC filter placed as above.
DVT treated w/ anticoagulation (see above).
Heme/Onc consult felt that IVC filter should ideally be removed after several months of anticoagulation if Pt does not have any further symptoms to minimize long-term consequences of retained IVC filter (further clot formation behind the filter).
Given her previous somnolence, she began a 3 day course of cipro 250mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-30**] and had good response.
# Meningioma s/p resection c/b stroke: Patient has significant deficit subsequent to surgery, however improvement of strength and independence with rehab.
Her neurological exam was stable when compared with previous documentation in OMR.
The patient's home aspirin was continued through the admission.
Physical therapy as well as speech therapy also came to work with the patient.
She was discharged with home physical therapy and speech therapy.
Her oxybutynin was discontinued in light of recent urinary tract infection out of concern that the patient's urinary retention may have contributed.
Pt's oxybutynin was restarted after she completed her course of ciprofloxacin for UTI due to incontinence.
# chronic hypokalemia: thought to be due to several month course of steroids for her meningioma and post-op causing adrenal suppression.
Pt was discharged on her home dose of potassium 40mEq po bid.
# TRANSITION OF CARE: - Patient will need regular follow-up of INR in the setting of starting warfarin therapy to insure that the patient's INR is therapeutic between 2 and 3.
- Pt will follow-up in [**Hospital **] clinic for her meningioma - Pt will follow-up in [**Hospital 30818**] clinic for her incontinence  Medications on Admission: levetiracetam 500 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **] oxybutynin chloride 5 mg Tablet daily potassium chloride 40 mEq [**Hospital1 **] aspirin 81 mg Tablet, 1 Tablet daily   Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO DAILY (Daily).
