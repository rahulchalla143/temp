A discharge summary is not yet available, however he reports that a CT scan was completed that demonstrated "colitis," for which he was treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, having finished a course yesterday.
Of note, around that time, he had been tapering off methadone and started on clonidine for his withdrawal symptoms.
At that visit, the plan was to resume ribavirin and interferon for treatment of his recurrent hepatitis C after transplant; these had been stopped earlier this year due to concerns over suicide ideation.
Levophed was written for, but never started given response of blood pressure to IVF.
