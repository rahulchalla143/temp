Images were acquired with and without intravenous contrast.
Multiple low-density lesions are again identified throughout the liver which are unchanged in size and appearance compared to most recent MRI of [**2118-5-9**] and thought to represent bilomas with internal debris related to hepatic artery occlusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old man with a history of EtOH cirrhosis & HCC s/p OLTx [**2114**] c/b multiple episodes of acute cellular rejection, multiple episodes of biliary sludge / stones requiring repeat ERCPs, and delayed arterial thrombosis resulting in ischemic cholangiopathy and bile lakes, who is directly admitted from home for elevated transaminases on outpatient labwork, but also with biliary obstructive symptoms.
He was started on levofloxacin and flagyl on [**2118-12-13**] for possible cholangitis.
As the findings of stricture and stones were likely the cause of his symptoms, he was monitored overnight and discharged the next morning without liver biopsy to investigate organ rejection.
Mr. [**Known lastname 63532**] transaminases, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase improved on their own prior to ERCP, with reduction in total bilirubin from 7.9 to 2.8.
Cholestyramine was held, and hydroxyzine was prescribed PRN for itch.
He received levo/flagyl during this admission for possible cholangitis (no evidence of this on ERCP) which were stopped the day of discharge.
His serum CK was > 13,000 on admission, and trended consistently downward with IV fluids and cessation of gemfibrozil and simvastatin.
However, urine myoglobin screening (conducted when CK was ~8,000) returned "presumptively negative."
A decision was made not to restart these medications at discharge.
Furosemide and lisinopril were held in the setting of ARF but resumed on discharge.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was continued on his home medications of CellCept and rapamycin.
He was continued on ursodiol.
Other home medications were continued during this admission.
