History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 103090**] is a 76 year old female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes.
A urinalysis She was also reported to have altered mental status from her baseline.
Labs were notable for a serum potassium of 6.9 with an ECG demonstrating peaked T waves, for which the patient received calcium, insulin, and bicarbonate with a repeat serum potassium of 6.0.
The patient received vancomycin, cefepime, meropenem, and acyclovir prior to transfer.
CTAP was notable for a wall thickening and pericolonic fat stranding in the left colon.
ESRD on Hemodialysis 3.

Uncomplicated placement of a 20 cm double-lumen temporary hemodialysis catheter VIP via the right common femoral access with the tip terminating in the IVC.
INTERPRETATION: Following the injection of autologous white blood cells labeled with In-111, images of the whole body were obtained at 24 and 48 hours.
She underwent HD and was called out to the medical floor with improvment of her K. At baseline she is disoriented to person, place, mumbling speech, ambulating with walker; [**Name8 (MD) **] NP altered from baseline AND in setting of fever and elevated lactate strongly suggests underlying infectious etiology; initally, most likely etiology thought to be colitis apparent on CT abdomen; patient high risk for  diff colitis given past history of recent antibiotic use.
She was started on vancomycin on [**2-9**].
Initially there was also a concern for intra-abominal process and so she was started on cipro/flagyl.
Throughout hospitalization, her graft site was determined to be the likely site of infection.
For the work up of her fevers/baceremia she then underwent a TTE which was unrevealing and an U/S of her fistula/graft and stent in her left IJ which were also unrevealing.
During that time, transplant surgery cut down the fistula and tied the brachial artery and some veins off and packed the antecubital fossa with gauze and wrapped an ACE bandage around her arm.
She was transferred to the MICU for further care where she had received the massive blood transfusion protocol including 5U pRBC, 2U platelets, 2U FFP.
Arctic cooling protocol was discussed after her PEA arrest but deferred given patient's improved/return to baseline mental status shortly after the event.
It was also noted that a guide-wire from an emergent femoral a-line was mistakenly left in place and migrated to the abdominal aorta during the code and noticed afterwards while the patient was in IR for a HD catheter placement.
During her MICU stay, her hypovolemic shock was stabilized and her HD access issues were addressed with renal, ID, and transplant surgery.
A temporal femoral VIP line was placed and used for dialysis for two sessions.
Transplant surgery recommended to continue dressing changes and no OR at that time.
She was transferred back to the floor on daptomycin at this point but still growing positive blood cultures with Staph aureus.
Since that time her blood cultures have remained negative and she was able to have a tunneled HD catheter placed for long term HD access.
There was minimal bleeding over 24 hrs at the catheter tunneled site which IR injected with thrombin and achieved hemostasis, the patient should not be weight bearing for 12 hours after this.
She is to have 6 weeks of vancomycin (her graft MRSA was sensitive to vanc) starting from 6 weeks after removal of infected graft material, dated from [**3-3**], to end [**4-14**].
She was continued on humalog insulin sliding scale.
She was placed on a diabetic diet.
We continued HD for fluid removal.
Aspirin and statin were also restarted prior to discharge on the patient stabilized.
Citalopram, risperdone prn were continued while we held trazadone, olanzapine.
Initially her BP meds were held in the acute setting, however upon discharge she was on hydralazine, amlodipine, labetalol with good BP control.
Her hematocrit returned to baseline s/p massive transfusion protocol for her hypovolemic shock/PEA arrest and continued to remain stable throughout the rest of her hospital admission.
Aspirin was held when she was in the MICU in the setting of acute bleed.

Mental Status:Confused - always Level of Consciousness:Lethargic but arousable Activity Status:Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for treatment of high potassium levels in the blood and bacteria in your blood.
Initially, we could not perform a surgery on this site to remove the infectious nidus; however, the graft led to a serious bleed which required multiple blood products.
You continued to have positive blood cultures despite being on IV antibiotics after this time and ultimately had a graft revision by transplant surgery after which time your blood cultures remained negative.
You had placement of a tunneled HD catheter for dialysis which initially had small amounts of bleeding which was ultimately controlled.
The following changes were made to your medicines: - Please take vancomycin for 6 weeks after removal of infected graft material, dated from [**3-3**], to end [**4-14**].
- Please take amlodipine 10mg daily - Please take hydralazine 50mg every 8 hrs - Please stop taking Aspirin 81mg due to concerns for bleeding around your HD catheter site - Please stop taking olanzapine and trazodone There were no other changes to your medicines.
