This is a 59 year-old female with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**5-/2137**] status post exploratory laparotomy, status post chemotherapy with Irinotecan and Gemcitabine followed by resection two months later of the left lobe of the liver in [**12/2137**] who is being followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] without recurrence until recently.
Yesterday she came to the Emergency Room, the day prior to admission at an outside hospital in [**Location (un) 3844**] with poor po intake and was found to have a blood pressure in the 90s and was given intravenous fluids.
There she went into rapid atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 170s and blood pressure of 80/60, which converted after more intravenous fluids were given.
The patient was given 500 each of Levaquin and Flagyl.
The patient also received a drainage tube in her hepatic abscess per Interventional Radiology and was started on a course of intravenous Zosyn.
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, appendectomy and BTO, depression on Paxil, gastric duodenal ulcer in [**1-27**] with massive gastrointestinal bleed and perforation.
MEDICATIONS:  Paxil 30 mg, Nexium 40 mg q.d., Synthroid 50 mcg q.d.
O2 sat 99% on room air.
HEENT nasogastric tube in place when arriving to the MICU.
Her platelet count began to rise and the patient continued on intravenous Zosyn.
On [**2139-12-10**] the patient was taken to CT scan and per Interventional Radiology the patient's drains were placed with larger tubes and at that time there was instrumentation across the diaphragm and a chest tube was placed though the pneumothorax was very small.
The chest tube was never placed on suction or even hooked up to a Pleura-Vac.
Infectious Disease was consulted for recommendations on length of antibiotic course as well as the possibility of changing to po medications for discharge.
The patient is now tolerating a full po diet and ambulating in the hallways and denies pain except for at drainage sites.
