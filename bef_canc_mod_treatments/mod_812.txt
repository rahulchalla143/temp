Neurology was consulted to advise whether anticoagulation would be safe.
After discussing with oncology, heparin gtt was started.
Although the team was concerned about the possibility of heart failure, she was given SL nitroglycerin and ASA but not started on lasix or BP medications.
She did receive clindamycin and levofloxacin for concern of a possible RLL infiltrate.
She was also given prednisone 60mg x 1 because of the possibility that she might be adrenally insufficient on chronic steroids.
