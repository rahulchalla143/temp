Ms. [**Known lastname **] had been on prednisone taper for eosinophilic pneumonia in [**Month (only) 547**](mult recurrences, most recent in [**Month (only) **]) and was down to to 20 qd prior to admission.
Rec'd solumedrol in ED.
IN [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was treated with azithromycin and ceftriaxone to cover CAP(will hold on vanc and levo for now), prednisone 30mg each day (for possible eosinophilic PNA), ipratroprium/albuterol nebs.
No peripheral eosinophils at this time, which could be due to the fact that she has been partially tx with steroids and now she was rebounding as steroids continued to be taperred.
She was discharged on 14 day course of levofloxacin and 30mg of steroids to be tappered slowly by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] over the next many months.
Anti-hypertension meds held on admit and she responded well to 1L fluid challenge.
SBP b/w 100-130 and ace and bblocker restarted prior to discharge.
As discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], did not restart imdur on d/c but will restart at f/u appt.
Was on insulin drip in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with BG well controlled in low 100's.
On transfer to floor, she was restarted on outpt 8 units of NPH in am and cover with RISS.
However, BG levels occasionally jump to levels >300 and NPH was increased to 12 units in AM.
Anion gap much improved s/p dialysis.
Continue m/w/f dialysis after discharge.
6) h/o CHF - Not clinically volume overloaded, but evidence of CHF on CXR (not seen on admission) after fluid challenge in ICU to tx hypotension.
9) Anemia-cont EPO at dialysis.
