PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Clinical aortic stenosis, congenital hemangioma, recent enterococcal urinary tract infection, congestive heart failure, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, congenital telangiectasia syndrome, thrombocytopenia, appendectomy, attempted removal of hemangioma 30 years ago, tracheostomy, hypernatremia.
Glipizide 10 mg p.o.

She is taken to the operating room on [**2184-3-16**] where aortic valve replacement was performed.
The patient required Epinephrine, Dobutamine and Levophed drip postoperatively.
She also required an excess of blood products including packed red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma, secondary to her anemia and dilution of other factors through replacement.
The patient also received an excess in intravenous fluid in an attempt to maintain blood pressure.
The chest tubes were elevated and allowed to coagulate within in an attempt to tampanode the bleeding off to ensure that the patient did not suffer from cardiac tampanode, a transesophageal echocardiogram probe was left in her esophagus to continually assess collection of fluid within her mediastinum.
Postoperatively the patient did have chest tubes in place, she also had pacing wires in place.
In the evening of the postoperative night after significant amount of blood products and fluid have been given the patient experienced severe right ventricular dysfunction secondary to congestive heart failure.
She was also challenged with Lasix which did allow the patient to urinate minimally but while on CVVHD the patient did not urinate much.
Over the course of the next few days included Neo-Synephrine, Epinephrine, Pertussin, Esmolol and Sustacuriam.
The patient remained intubated and sedated for some time.
The patient received perioperative Vancomycin for anti-microbial prophylaxis.
Over the course of the next couple of days the patient was slowly weaned from ventilator to CPAP.
Over the course of the next few days the CVVHD was slowly weaned and Lasix challenge was performed.
After the CVVHD was discontinued however, that her urine output picked up and functioned well on her own.
The patient's drips were slowly weaned and the patient was slowly transferred to a ventilatory mask over her trach.
With Lasix treatment the patient became hypocalcemic for which she required aggressive potassium replacement.
The patient's chest tube and pacing wires were removed at the appropriate time although extreme caution was taken as the chest tubes did infiltrate the chest cavity at a location where hemangioma tissue was likely to be found.
While in the Intensive Care Unit the patient's tracheostomy was changed in order to facilitate easier usage of different ventilatory support system.
While in the Intensive Care Unit the patient also experienced thrombocytopenia for which a number of platelet transfusions were required.
Respiratory care was consulted for aggressive chest physical therapy as well as Mucomyst in an attempt to aid the patient in breathing and loosen up her trach secretions.
This improved both with the Mucomyst and after her tracheostomy apparatus was replaced.
While on the floor it was noted that her chest incision was leaking fluid but that was mixed with tracheostomy secretions.
Lasix was temporarily stopped.
On [**2184-3-31**] the patient secondary to complaints of dyspnea and left pleural effusion on chest x-ray the thoracic team was consulted who placed a pigtail drain in the pleural space to aid in drainage of the effusion.
