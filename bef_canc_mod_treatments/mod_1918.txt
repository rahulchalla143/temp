Perhaps related to adrenal insufficiency and patient was placed on hydrocortisone with improvement, she was switched to prednisone when called out of MICU.
Patient will need a very slow taper of prednisone given her history of a chronic eosinophilic pna, and perhaps outpatient [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test.
Patient bp improved as her underlying lung infection (see below) was treated.
--Patient was continued on ASA and beta blocker, Ace inhibitor held secondary to hypotension (and was restarted prior to dc) * 3.
Patient was given round the clock albuterol, atrovent nebs with inhaled steroids and prednisone.
Repeat chest x-ray showed no evidence of pna, but given her slowness to respond levoquin was added for question for bacterial superinfection-?
Pulm consulted indicated that likely she has a chronic eosinophilic pna and has been treated with too short courses of steroids in past.
They also recommended that she should be placed on bactrim ppx.
It was decided that the patient should be placed on respiratory isolation in order to rule out TB and to send sputum  x 3 for AFB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], bacterial cultures, and cytology (concern for malignancy given smoking history).
The sputum cultures grew gram neg rods, and given her history of pseudomonal pna, patient was placed on gentamycin.
At this point, the levoquin was stopped (she had been on levo for 9 days).
Eventually it was decided that patient would be treated with 14 days of gent and cipro for pseudomonas, and 14 days of bactrim for stentrophomonas maltophilia.
ID recommended that patient be treated only with cipro for pseudomonal infection (gent was dc'ed), and bactrim be lowered to PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] dose (felt that stentrophomonas maltophilia was likely a colonizer).
ESRD- On HD MWF.
Fluid removal helped respiratory status.
DM2- cont home regimen of NPH and ISS for coverage.
Patient was hemodynamically stable and patient was given some vitamin K. Coumadin was held until decreased.
Eventually coumadin was restarted with heparin bridge until inr was therapeutic.
