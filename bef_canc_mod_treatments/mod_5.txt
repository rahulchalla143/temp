HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 62-year-old male with a past medical history of lung carcinoma status post right pneumonectomy, multiple recent hospitalizations since [**Month (only) 205**] for bronchitic-like infections, on chronic alternating antibiotic regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim, recent hospitalization in MICU with intubation, chronic secretions, and congestive-related problems, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on home oxygen, congestive heart failure, prior PEs, history of atrial fibrillation, who presented with respiratory distress.
Respiratory distress:  The patient was given Lasix, Albuterol nebs, and Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department and had rapid improvement of his symptoms.
The patient also recently completed a steroid taper for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease component and was not clearly bronchospastic during this admission.
He continued to have aggressive chest physical therapy for secretion management and was continued on his Scopolamine patch, Serevent, Combivent, Atrovent/Albuterol nebs, and inhalers.
He was also continued on his alternating prophylactic antibiotic regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim.
He was given gentle fluid hydration.
He also had a cortical stimulation test to assess for renal insufficiency given that he had just finished his steroid taper; however, this was done after Solu-Medrol had been given to the patient.
It was reportedly negative, but it was unclear as to how accurate this is in the setting of recent Solu-Medrol dosing.
His Lasix was decreased from 160 mg b.i.d.
to 80 mg b.i.d., and his ACE inhibitor was discontinued.
Cardiovascular:  In terms of the patient's history of perioperative myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure, the patient was continued on his Amiodarone and Lasix 80 mg b.i.d.
He also continued Aspirin and Lipitor.
His electrocardiogram was unchanged, and it was thought that there was not any significant cardiac component to the patient's respiratory distress.
Endocrine:  The patient was continued on his Glyburide and was covered with an Insulin sliding scale in the hospital.
History of pulmonary embolus:  The patient was continued on his Coumadin while in-house.
He appears to be doing very well with physical therapy during this hospitalization and has slightly improved his exercise tolerance.
He will also be started on a Morphine Elixir 5-10 mg sublingually p.r.n.
