Status post exploratory laparotomy.
Diverting ostomy and repair of anastomotic leak.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 35654**] is a 58-year-old man with multiple polyps in his colon who underwent a total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis on [**12-8**].
Initial postoperative course was complicated by bleeding requiring urgent re-exploration on the night of surgery.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the operating room where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, ostomy repair of an anastomotic leak.
He was taken from the operating room to the SICU where he remained intubated overnight.
He had delayed ostomy function and was maintained on TPN with npo status on Fluconazole, Flagyl and Levofloxacin for antibiotics.
His bowels, as I mentioned, were slow to return to function, however, once ileostomy started to work he had no interruption in function.
He received ostomy training and became comfortable, taking care of his ileostomy.
His antibiotics had been off for 24 hours and he remained afebrile.
He is being discharged with his staples and will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately one weeks time for staple removal.
Of note, the patient was on a Somatostatin drip for approximately a week to slow down his NG tube output, however, once his ileostomy started to consistently function, he continued with elevated NG output.
His residuals after four hours of clamping were 55 and 10 and NG tube was removed without difficulty.
The patient does have significant reflux disease and intermittently had trouble with his reflex, however, never had any evidence of bowel obstruction and tolerated his diet throughout.
He is being discharged to home on Protonix, Imodium prn and Tylenol for pain medication as well as his preoperative medications.
