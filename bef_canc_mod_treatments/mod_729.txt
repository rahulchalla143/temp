HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 47-year-old woman with a possible history of rheumatic heart disease as a child, and an atrial septal defect repair in [**2133**], had a history of palpitations and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.
In [**2156-10-14**], she underwent transesophageal echocardiogram cardioversion and was started on sotalol.
In [**2156-11-13**], she was admitted to an outside hospital with congestive heart failure, and the sotalol was discontinued at that time.
She was started on Lasix, a beta blocker, and a calcium channel blocker at that time.
She was also seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from the Cardiology Service who suggested that she should undergo a mitral valve replacement.
The patient was admitted preoperatively to discontinue her Coumadin, to be started on heparin, and an amiodarone load.
In addition, to a mitral valve replacement she has a possible tricuspid valve replacement as well as a Maze procedure and plus or minus tieing off of a left atrial appendage.
Atrial septal defect repair in [**2133**].
Atrial fibrillation times four to five years, status post transesophageal echocardiogram cardioversion.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications prior to admission included verapamil 240 mg p.o.
q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o.
b.i.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2-10**], the patient was brought to the operating room at which time she underwent a mitral valve replacement and a tricuspid valve repair.
In summary, she had a mitral valve replacement with #28 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] and a tricuspid valve repair with a #30 .................... ring.
She tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
Her anesthesia was reversed, and she was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated.
During the night of on postoperative day one, she was noted to be in first-degree atrioventricular heart block until about 2 in the morning when it was noted that she had a paced rhythm at 60.
She remained hemodynamically stable with a paced rhythm.
It was noted that her hematocrit was 22, and her urine output was somewhat diminished; and, therefore, she received 2 units of packed red blood cells.
She was transfused with 2 additional units of packed red blood cells.
The Electrophysiology Service wanted to wait until the patient's respiratory and hematologic issues were resolved, and the Hematology Service felt that her anemia was possibly due to a delayed transfusion reaction.
On postoperative day 12, the patient lost capture from her epicardial pacing wires, and on postoperative day 13 she was brought to the Electrophysiology Laboratory where she underwent permanent pacemaker implantation.
In summary, the patient had a dual-mode, dual-pacing, dual-sensing pacemaker placed without complication.
Following pacemaker placement, she was transferred from the catheterization laboratory for [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Six for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
She was restarted on her heparin and was also started on Coumadin at that time.
Over the course of that time, she continued working with Physical Therapy and with the nursing staff to increase her activity level.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Discharge medications include) 1.
Niferex 150 mg p.o.
Folate 1 mg p.o.
Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets p.o.
