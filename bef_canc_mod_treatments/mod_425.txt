CT surgery was consulted, but determined that he was not a CABG candidate due to extensive aortic calcifications, so he was taken back to cath on [**5-17**] and had a single cypher stent placed to his mid-LAD on [**2125-5-17**].
He was kept on plavix to 75mg, ASA back to 325, statin, beta blocker, and ACE as tolerated for the remainder of hospitalization.
He was kept on bipap without success for 1 day then intubated.
He was put on levophedrine for hypotension on [**5-28**], and meropenem was substituted for vancomycin.
During this whole time he was diuresed for potential CHF, but his fluid status was unclear so a swan was placed with initial wedge 62/30 wedge 14-24 CO 5.9 CI 2.6 SVR 1100.
PPD, ANCA, anti-GBM, sputum for cytology and PCP were negative.
The decision was made to start empiric steroids, solumedrol 125 Q6H, which appeared to help for 2 days but then he started to become more hypoxic again.
Steroids were weaned off.
He was initially treated with vancomycin and transitioned to ampicillin based on sensitivities.
ID consultation felt it was contamination and antibiotics were discontinued.
#) Pump/CHF - Patient has severe class III symptoms at home with Lasix 40 PO BID dose.
He was maintained on metoprolol and captopril as tolerated.
#) Adrenal insufficiency - For hypotension, [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim was done which bumped from 33-39 so he was started on hydrocort/fludricort.
#) ARF - Baseline 1.0-1.3, but his creatinine became elevated from agressive diuresis and low BP up to peak of 1.9.
Then his creatinine started to rise again likley combination of ATN and pre-renal state.
