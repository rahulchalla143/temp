Brief Hospital Course: This is a 62 yo F with h/o squamous cell lung CA s/p induction chemotherapy, radiation and surgical resection [RUL lobectomy] as well as COPD who presents to ED with N/V/D/poor PO intake noted to be hypotensive with diarrhea.
#, Hypotension: Her hypotension was thought to be due to hypovolemia from dehydration and recent diarrhea in conjunction with her continuing to take both her diltiazem and metoprolol at home.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have been related to underlying infection given concern for a new infiltrate on CXR and h/o chronic aspiration so vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl were started to cover broadly for HCAP and aspiration.
Her tachycardia, thought to be MAT or AFlutter, was postulated to be contributing to the low BPs as well so a diltiazem gtt was started with moderate decrease in HR but minimal improvement in BP.
The pt was gently resuscitated with IVF boluses in the ICU and maintained sbp's in the high 90s to low 100s consistently which trended up into the low 110s on transfer to the floor.
Tachycardia: She has a known history of either MAT or atrial flutter managed on metoprolol and diltiazem.
The tachycardia improved with IVFs and diltiazem gtt.
Gtt was weaned off as pt was started on metoprolol and diltiazem po, both increased to more than home dosing.
The patient was started on antibiotics as well as solumedrol 60 mg q8h and started intermittent BiPAP on ICU day 2.
She was given a quick 5 day burst of prednisone after transfer from the ICU.
Pnuemonia: She completed an 8 day course of levofloxacin for CAP, although was initially given broader spectrum antibiotics for possible HCAP.
C.diff toxin and stool cultures were checked and were negative.
Flagyl for pts possible aspiration covered empirically for C.diff while waiting for the toxin result.
DM2: Pt was maintained on NPH and ISS with QACHS FBSGs while in the ICU.
Metformin was held given pts elevated lactate on admission.
She had high blood sugars immediately prior to discharge felt to be related to steroid administration.
# CAD s/p MI-PTCA: No evidence of active ischemia in the ICU.
Held home beta blocker at first given relative hypotension, continued daily ASA and statin.
She was restarted on her home meds at discharge.
