Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IR placed pigtail catheter placed in deep pelvic collection.
History of Present Illness: History of Present Illness: 67M with colon CA s/p colostomy and recurrent enterocutaneous fistula admitted with 2 days of copious rectal drainage.
Recent admission [**Date range (1) 49563**] for septic shock from ascending cholangitis, E. Coli bacteremia c/b liver abscesses s/p IR drainage [**9-16**], HAP, hypoxemic resp failure, ATN requiring CVVH, rapid afib/flutter s/p DCCV and GI bleed.
Underwent ERCP and CBD stent [**9-16**] to treat obstruction in the lower third of the biliary tree felt to be from stone or stricture.
EGD and C-scope [**10-10**] showed gastritis, duodenitis, and a small erosion/ulceration of the skin at the anal anastamosis with evidence of oozing.
Given vanco 1 g, zosyn 4.5g IV, flagyl 500 mg IV, and tylenol.
Surgery compared OSH CT to our prior images and felt that anastamotic leak was old with just increased output now, and recommended conservative management given his poor surgical candidacy.

Ulcerated non-mobile complex atheroma in the descending aorta at the esophageal level of 35 cm from the gum line  CT GUIDANCE DRAINAGE  [**2194-11-7**] Following this, an 8 French catheter was then introduced into the collection under CT fluoroscopic guidance using via trocar technique.
CT fluoroscopic imaging confirmed successful placement of the catheter.
At the time the catheter deployment, total of 200 ml of fluid drainage was removed revealing a mixture of stool and blood, of note blood clot was seen on the preprocedure scan in the collection.
IMPRESSION: Technically successful pigtail drainage catheter placement in the midline pelvic collection using CT fluoroscopic guidance.
[**11-14**] CT ABD/Pelvis - report pending  Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo male with complicated history including hx of metastatic rectal cancer s/p multiple surgeries including colostomy, and probable neoadjuvant chemo and XRT, and multiple rounds of chemotherapy, recurrent enterocutaneous fistula, and clear cell RCC (s/p partial nephrectomy), was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for cholangitis c/b liver abscesses (drained last admission), septic shock, respiratory failure (intubated).
During this admission, pt was also noted to have a signficant fluid collection in the pelvis, which is now s/p IR drainage.
He also had noted recent hepatic abscess as well as PICC line in place (concern for line sepsis) and multiple ostomys and enterocutaneous fistula as sources of possible infection.
He was intially started on daptomycin (history of VRE rectal abscess) and zosyn for empiric coverage of intra-abdominal process.
In addition, he was started on IV flagyl and PO Vancomycin for empiric coverage of C. diff.
ERCP was consulted for possible cholangitis secondary to elevated LFT's in setting of recent procedure and septic picture.
Pt was started on Micafungin and PICC catheter tip was sent for culture and also grew yeast.
Pt was treated for glabrata fungemia with micafungin for two weeks .
During the hospitalization, pt had been started on Pip/Tazo for empiric broad-spectrum coverage during his period of sepsis.
It appears that this infected area likely communicates with bowel, and thus there is likely no endpoint to antibiotic therapy, however, antibiotics obviously can not be continued indefinately.
JP drain for pelvic abscess now with no outpt since [**11-11**].
Case was re-discussed with surgery - who felt that the fluid collection represented stool output from fistula to small or large bowel,and that patient was not a surgical candidate for correction of this.
The drain was replaced on 11/2o to ensure on going drainage of the peri-rectal fluid collection (it had become partially dislodged and was no longer draining).
He required an esmolol and diltiazem drip to achieve adequate rate control.
This was subsequently converted to oral metoprolol and diltiazem.
chronic cholecystitis:  Ab ct showed large fluid collection in the liver, so patient was initially scheduled for IR drainage of this collection.
Case discussed with surgery, who felt that he should not have a cholecystectomy or drain placed in the gallbladder.
#COPD, chronic stable - - continued ipratropium prn .
#Ulcerated aortic ulcer/plaque - During TEE, pt was incidentally noted to have an ulcerated plaque on his aorta.
He wishes to continue full medical care and treatment for his conditions.
Yet, Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 4027**] was very clear in his wishes to continue hospitalization for his conditions when necessary.

You were treated with antibiotics for your infections.
Your heart rate was very high at times, so you were started on two medicines to control your heart rate - metoprolol and diltiazem.
