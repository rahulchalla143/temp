HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year old male with past medical history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2188**], and [**2196**], atrial flutter, status post ablation, congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 20 to 25%, status post AICD placement, multiple myeloma, diabetes mellitus, who presented to an outside hospital on [**2200-3-2**], with the chief complaint of shortness of breath times three days.
In late [**Month (only) 956**], he was seen in the Electrophysiology Device Clinic and begun on Lasix 20 mg once daily for congestive heart failure.
On [**2200-2-27**], his Lasix dose was increased to 40 mg per day when he was seen in clinic after an episode of feeling a sensation of chills that awoke him from sleep accompanied by shortness of breath.
He was found to have bilateral rales on examination and was given 40 mg intravenous Lasix, Aspirin, one amp of D50 and one half Nitroglycerin paste and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation given that his prior cardiologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
At the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department, he was started on a D10W drip and transferred to the floor with q2hour fingerstick glucose checks.
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, status post AICD placement in [**2199-8-26**].
Atrial flutter, status post ablation in [**2199-10-26**].
The plasma cells appear to be dysplastic with prominent nucleoli and there were multinucleated plasma cells seen as well.
He had been treated for multiple myeloma prior to this biopsy with Thalidomide as well as Methylprednisone in the past.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2178**], and [**2196**], with an episode of mediastinitis complicating one of the bypass surgeries.
His last coronary catheterization was on [**2199-10-9**], which demonstrated patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, and saphenous vein graft to R1/OM1 and right posterior descending artery, as well as severe three vessel coronary disease of a right dominant system, moderate diastolic ventricular function, left ventriculogram was not performed secondary to renal insufficiency.
Prostate cancer, status post radiation therapy.
Bladder cancer, status post BCG instillation.
It is unclear how the patient got this diagnosis, however, he has been on Glipizide and Metformin for approximately one year with no episodes of hypoglycemia in the past.
Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Lipitor 40 mg p.o.
Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
Lisinopril 20 mg p.o.
Tricor 160 mg p.o.
Metformin 500 mg p.o.
Glipizide 10 mg p.o.
Multivitamin one p.o.
Lasix 40 mg p.o.
Congestive heart failure - The patient was initially continued on 40 mg of Lasix per day, given the findings on lung examination and the peripheral edema.
He was continued on ace inhibitor, beta blocker, with a less than two gram sodium diet, one liter fluid restriction.
Blood pressure was initially controlled with a Nitroglycerin drip.
Once in the Intensive Care Unit, Natrecor drip was started with good effect on diuresis.
We used Lasix with caution given the patient's rising creatinine.
At the time of transfer to the floor, the patient had oxygen saturation of 99% on two liters nasal cannula.
Hypoglycemia - The patient was initially treated with an insulin sliding scale.
The Glipizide and Metformin were held and one amp of D50 was given for isolated low glucose levels.
He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where a D10W drip was initiated.
Nevertheless, the patient still required D50 pushes for two glucose levels below 50.
Insulin and proinsulin was checked.
An endocrine consultation was obtained which suggested that most likely the hypoglycemia was secondary to decreased excretion of Sulfonylureas in Metformin in the setting of acute renal failure, as well as possible contribution to Hydrochlorothiazide induced insulin resistant.
The D10W drip was eventually titrated down to D5W drip and then after the patient developed hyponatremia was changed to D5 normal saline and was then weaned off on the morning of [**2200-3-2**], at which time fingerstick glucose remained within normal limits and fingerstick glucose checks were changed to q4hours and then to q6hours.
Of note, the patient did have one episode of hyperglycemia in the 400s during this period of time and was covered with six units of regular insulin before transfer to the medical floor.
Coronary artery disease - The patient was continued on his outpatient regimen of Aspirin, beta blocker, statin and ace inhibitor.
Electrophysiology consultation was obtained and recommended continuing Amiodarone and beta blockers as he had been on previously.
The Amiodarone was increased to 400 mg once daily.
This was in the setting of bradycardia to 50 beats per minute on telemetry, which resolved after ten seconds.
Acute on chronic renal failure - This was felt to be secondary to an increase in the Lasix dose five days prior to admission as well as the use of Levofloxacin, see below, as well as the use of ace inhibitors as well as decreased p.o.
Urinary tract infection - The patient was felt to have urinary tract infection by urinalysis on admission and was started on Levofloxacin which was subsequently renally dosed.
Culture results were negative at the time of dictation and the patient will be given a total of five days of Levofloxacin at 250 mg p.o.
Atrial fibrillation - The patient was continued on Coumadin with INR goal of 2.0.
