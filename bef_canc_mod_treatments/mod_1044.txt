The procedure was explained to the patient.
TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the left brachial vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous access.
A peel-away sheath was placed over a guidewire and a single lumen PICC line measuring 23 cm in length was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the left subclavian vein under fluoroscopic guidance.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided single lumen PICC line placement via the left brachial vein.
INDICATIONS: 78-year-old man with pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.
A chest tube has been removed from the right hemithorax.
In the right upper lobe, there is scarring, with scattered micronodules and mild bronchiectasis, probably representing sequela of previous granulomatous exposure.
Bone windows show midline sternotomy wires and mild degenerative changes of the spine.
Scarring and multiple micronodules in the right upper lobe with very mild bronchiectasis, probably representing sequelae of granulomatous exposure but activity of disease is indeterminate without older studies for comparison; correlation with current infectious status or previous films is recommended to help determine chronicity of these findings.
Pacer leads seen with no definte associated vegetation (cannot definitively exclude).
Please note non contrast CT has limited sensitivity for detection abscesses.
No definite paraspinal fluid collections; however, CT has low sensitivity for evaluation of spinal abscesses.
HE was treated withceftriaxone and clida initially and then only high dose ceftriaxone.
