Patient is status post ileal conduit urinary diversion and urostomy, adjacent to which is a moderate-to-large right-sided abdominal wall hernia.
No clear wall is seen around the fluid in the hernia, although no IV contrast was administered.
[**2167-7-21**] CXR : Lung volumes are lower, the small bilateral pleural effusions are new, but the most important change is widespread multifocal peribronchial opacification--most likely widespread infection, perhaps embolic--almost nodular in the left upper lobe, a new large region of consolidation at both lung bases, the right anterior and the left posterior.
Given the persistence of the collection in spite of an indwelling pigtail drainage catheter, the patient will be transferred to the radiology department for upsizing of the catheter.

Plans were made for drainage of her abdominal abscess in Interventional radiology.
She also had multiple episodes of emesis requiring nasogastric tube placement for decompression.
On [**2167-7-17**] she had some hypotension and abdominal pain and was transferred to the Surgical ICU for further management.
She was then treated with IV Zosyn, Vancomycin and Flagyl.
A CT showed re accumulation of her abdominal fluid collection and she had a drain replaced under ultrasound guidance.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor she remained NPO and was hydrated with IV fluids.
Her gastric fluid drainage diminished and she was passing flatus so her nasogastric tube was removed.
During this time she developed diarrhea and specimens for C difficile were sent on 3 different occasions.
In the interim she remained on Flagyl and eventually oral Vancomycin was added.
Her Flagyl was discontinued but her oral Vancomycin remains as the plan for antibiotic treatment of her polymicrobial organisms including lactobacillus will continue indefinitely until her abscess is totally drained.
She has been off of IV Vancomycin since [**2167-7-24**].
A chest Xray was done which showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations and she was already being treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
She underwent chest PT, incentive spirometry and nebulizer treatments and within 24 hours had symptomatically improved with a decreased cough and Room Air saturations of 94-95%.
