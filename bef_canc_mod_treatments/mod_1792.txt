The pt was started on Vanc/Zosyn and PO Vanc.
Pt given Lidocaine bolus, started on a drip and EP was consulted.

Post ablation pt had repeated runs of NSVT and placed back on Lidocaine drip and PO amiodarone.
The pt was kept intubated post procedure for 18hrs as his BP stabilized and was briefly put back on pressors.
Pt was transitioned to PO Mexilitine with 24 hr overlap with Lidocaine drip.
The drip was subsequently d/c'd.
Over the course of his MICU course he was given IVF via his antibiotics and pt slowly became overloaded R>L as evident by CXR and increased 02 requirement up to 5L.
However, pt has hx of refractory C Diff and thus was placed on PO Vanc as prophylaxis while on Vanc/Zosyn for Cellulitis.
