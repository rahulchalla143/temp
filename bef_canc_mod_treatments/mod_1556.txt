While the patient was awaiting cardiac surgery the patient began complaining of pain over his distal sacrum.
The patient was started on antibiotics for a question of a pilonidal cyst.
On hospital day #3, [**6-25**] the patient was evaluated by General Surgery for the lesion at his gluteal cleft.

He did not require any surgical intervention but agreed with antibiotic therapy.
