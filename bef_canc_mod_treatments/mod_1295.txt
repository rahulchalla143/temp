Admission Date:  [**2106-2-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2106-3-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2028-5-12**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MICU ORANG  CHIEF COMPLAINT:   The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit status post cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Miss [**Known lastname 96805**] is a 77 year old female with metastatic ovarian cancer and multiple complications stemming from this, who presented to the Medical Intensive Care Unit status post cardiac arrest.
She was brought to the [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Department, and she was intubated and started on vasopressors and antibiotics (Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Flagyl).
The antibiotics were changed to Unasyn and Vancomycin.
On [**2106-2-19**], her antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and Ceftazidine and on [**2106-2-21**], the antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and Meropenem for pneumonia - antibiotics directed per sensitivities.
She also received hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.
On [**2106-2-24**], she was found to have dark drainage from her NG tube and was thought to be possibly blood from a potential perforation.
She was managed with supplemental oxygen up to 100% non-rebreather and then weaned downwards.
She had a small amount of ostomy output as well as an occult blood positive NG tube drainage.
She was noted to be pulseless and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated.
She was given one ampule of epinephrine, intubated and CPR was continued.
She was then given one ampule of Atropine and continued CPR.
After approximately five minutes of additional CPR (15 to 20 minutes total), the monitor revealed ventricular fibrillation.
One non-synch DC cardioversion at 300 joules was delivered.
Ovarian cancer diagnosed in [**2104-11-1**], status post debulking surgery, status post total abdominal hysterectomy, status post omentectomy, status post sigmoid resection and end colostomy.
She received chemotherapy including CBDCA, Taxol, and Doxil.
History of malignant pleural effusion, status post pleurodesis on two occasions.
Breast cancer status post left lumpectomy in [**2093**] and irradiation.
One plus aortic regurgitation was seen.
ALLERGIES:   Levofloxacin and Unasyn which cause a rash.
Metoprolol 15 mg intravenously q. four hours.
Famotidine 20 mg intravenously q.
Meropenem 500 mg intravenously q.
Vancomycin 1000 mg intravenously q.o.d.
Morphine sulfate p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, vital signs were temperature 102.4 F.; pulse 119; blood pressure 106/46 (on Dopamine at 5 mics per kg per minute).
Calcium 8.8, phosphorus 4.0, magnesium 2.2.  NOTABLE STUDIES:  Post code EKG demonstrated reversed on leads of I and AVR.
Large loculated peritoneal fluid collections with layering internal debris, possibly blood.
Most likely sources for sepsis included aspiration pneumonia but other sources cannot be excluded including intra-abdominal processes, Clostridium difficile or mucous plugging.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  She presented to the Intensive Care Unit from the Medical Floor after several days of increasing hypoxia requiring increased supplemental oxygen.
She was intubated during the code and remained intubated with decreasing levels of mechanical ventilatory support.
On [**2106-3-3**], she was extubated as she required very minimal support (RESBY was 47).
Secondary to her significant risk of aspiration with extubation, she remained intubated, requiring little ventilatory support until she was able to receive a tracheostomy.
The procedure was delayed secondary to her thrombocytopenia.
She underwent a tracheostomy on [**2106-3-15**].
She tolerated the procedure well with only a small amount of bleeding around the tracheostomy site.
Prior to discharge, the patient tolerated tracheal tenting for approximately 36 hours without requiring mechanical ventilatory support.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Hypotension; the patient was hypotensive status post P/A arrest on [**2106-3-1**].
She required vasopressors with Dopamine and Neo-Synephrine per peri-code.
She was volume resuscitated with six liters of normal saline as she was likely septic considering her fever prior to the code.
During the next several days, she was intermittently on vasopressor support for systolic blood pressures in the low 80s, not responding to Crystalloid.
She was maintained on Vancomycin and Meropenem as she had been on the Medical Floor.
Flagyl was added as a likely source for her potential sepsis was her intra-abdominal tumor invading her intestines.
She was initiated on hydrocortisone and fluticasone.
The fluticasone was not given as she was unable to take p.o., and the patient's NG tube was to continuous suction.
She required Neo-Synephrine transiently post-tracheostomy secondary to the station on [**2106-3-15**].
The patient's blood pressure responded to Lopressor intravenously and this medication was titrated up to effect.
Her steroids were increased to previous levels and she did not tolerate the weaning with the increase in her temperature as well.
She completed a 14 day course of Vancomycin that was previously initiated.
Abdominal ultrasound was performed on [**3-2**], to explore an intra-abdominal source for her fevers.
Antibiotics were discontinued on [**3-4**] and her temperature curve was followed.
She remained afebrile from [**3-7**] through [**3-16**] when she developed a temperature to 101.3 F., as her steroids had been weaned.
She had been administered one dose of Vancomycin for presumed Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia but without evidence for this, the decision was made to not empirically treat these sputum results.
The Foley catheter was changed and urine was resent.
Colostomy was noted to have no output several days prior to admission to the Intensive Care Unit and continued to have output of only minimally clear secretions.
She had an NG tube that has continuous suction, evacuating feculent material at times.
Her NG tube was to constant suction initially but it was changed to intermittent suction when she had minimal amounts of bloody particle suction.
She was maintained on Protonix 40 mg intravenously twice a day secondary to her blood positive NG output.
Her synthetic function remained intact as she corrected an elevated INR with the administration of Vitamin K.  5.
Her INR was elevated as well to 1.8 which corrected with the administration of Vitamin K.  Her last INR on [**3-15**] was 1.1.
Heparin was held as smear was reviewed with Hematology but was unremarkable.
Famotidine was changed to Protonix as well.
Anemia:  The patient had a history of anemia and had persistently diminished hematocrits while admitted requiring transfusion with eight units of packed red blood cells total during her admission.
Her last packed red blood cells unit transfused was on [**2106-3-8**].
She remained on a proton pump inhibitor twice a day for the GI prophylaxis, occult blood positive NG tube contents.
ONCOLOGY:  Metastatic ovarian cancer - Hematology/Oncology had been consulted while the patient was on the medical floor and noted that she had no further chemotherapy options based on the refractory nature of her tumor to her prior regimens and poor performance status.
Urology had been consulted during her Intensive Care Unit admission for the possibility of ureteral stents when her creatinine was 2.2, but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 96806**] in consultation with the attending doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 986**], felt that her decreased renal function was also possibly secondary to hypovolemia or nephrotoxicity of the Neo-synephrine.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient had electrolytes including calcium, magnesium and phosphorus monitored daily as she was maintained on total parenteral nutrition.
She required replacement of her potassium, magnesium, calcium and phosphorus which was accomplished mainly through the TPN.
PROPHYLAXIS:  While hospitalized, the patient remained on GI prophylaxis including Protonix ( twice a day for bleeding concerns) and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis with pneumatic compression boots.
She remained off subcutaneous heparin since [**2106-3-3**], secondary to the concern for heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
Her HIT antibody was negative but her platelets continued to rise after discontinuing heparin flushes and subcutaneous heparin (possibly a HIT type 1 reaction).
Acetaminophen 325 to 650 mg p.o./ NG tube q. four to six hours p.r.n.
Artificial tears one to two drops o.u.
Lacrilube ointment one application o.u.
Protonix 40 mg intravenously q.
Morphine sulfate 2 mg intravenously q. one to two hours p.r.n.
Miconazole powder 2%, one application topically three times a day p.r.n.
Metoprolol 10 mg intravenously q. four hours; hold for systolic blood pressure less than 100 or heart rate less than 60.
Hydrocortisone sodium succinate 15 mg intravenously q. eight hours.
The patient is to be weaned from mechanical ventilation as able.
She should remain on aspiration precautions.
