Admission Date:  [**2165-12-15**]              [**Month/Day/Year **] Date:   [**2166-1-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2125-12-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**] Chief Complaint: R flank pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IR embolization [**2165-12-15**] Endotracheal intubation Blood transfusion hemodialysis L knee arthrocentesis   History of Present Illness: For full H&P please see admission note.
Subsequently developed ATN with Cr 6.0 and progressive volume overload requiring intubation and CVVH.
The patient was transferred out of the TICU by urology to the medicine service for further management of anticoagulation (currently on heparin gtt, therapeutic x 48hours with stable HCTs).
Per urology there is right sided renal mass which does not require inpatient work-up at this time.
Past Medical History: Ascending aortic dissection s/p repair with st jude's valve ([**2160**]), transient HD during time of dissection, HTN .
occasional EtOH, denies tobacco  Family History: Mother, father with hypertension, sister with CVA  Physical Exam: VS 100.7 84 149/66 92-93% on 2L 16 GEN: pleasant gentleman in NAD HEENT: NCAT MMM anicteric Neck: R dialysis cath in place, dressing c/d/i Chest: L subclavian line removed, dressing c/d/i.
Increased heterogeneity suggests interval central necrosis possibly due to prior embolization procedure or hypoperfussion in the setting of prior hypovolemia and renal bleed.
Since prior embolization could explain the minimal to no enhancement, a neoplasm is not excluded.
He remained on heparin drip for anticoagulation.
Renal consult was called and suggested IV fluids and lasix.
However given aggressive fluid rescucitation and acute renal failure he developed fluid overload and respiratory distress, requiring intubation and CVVH.
The patient was also noted to have a right pleural effusion, but on ultrasound did not appear large enough to tap.
Once extubated, hemodynamically stable and no longer requiring CVVH, he was transferred to the medicine service on heparin drip for further anticoagulation and management.
# Coagulopathy: On arrival to the medicine service, the patient was on a heparin drip only, yet his INR was elevated to 2.7.
He was given a 2mg dose of vitamin K to which he responded appropriately.
Coumadin was initially held for thoracentesis and potential for other procedures but was eventually started with heparin bridge.
The patient was discharged with an INR of 2.5; he has an appointment on Monday (day post-[**Month/Day/Year **]) for repeat INR check and coumadin dose adjustment.
His creatinine and BUN were trended, nephrotoxins were avoided when possible, and the renal service was consulted for recommendations on treatment and restarting anti-hypertensives.
His iron studies were normal (except for ferritin which was elevated in the setting of acute illness).
He was continued on carvedilol, and several other agents were added during the course of his stay including amlodipine, lasix, hydralazine, clonidine patch and lisinopril.
With improvement in his renal function, we slowly removed hydralazine and clonidine from his regimen with good response.
Lisinopril was added on last but caused an acute jump in his creatinine from 1.9 to 3.0.
His blood pressure was well controlled and prior to [**Month/Day/Year **] lisinopril was restarted at low dose (5mg daily).
Initially afebrile, the patient had several fever spikes (max 102.3) which prompted a thoracentesis and addition of vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired and vent-acquired pneumonia.
His fevers resolved for several days, then returned at low grade despite antibiotics.
Coverage was switched to levofloxacin and flagyl for a 2 week course.
He remained afebrile and did not require supplemental oxygen for the remaineder of his stay.
Last day of antibiotics is [**1-16**].
Given his renal status, it was felt that a one-time dose of prednisone may be the best way to treat his symptoms.
A 50mg po prednisone dose was administered which resolved his symptoms.
His colchicine was restarted on [**Month/Year (2) **].

[**Hospital1 **] Disposition: Home  [**Hospital1 **] Diagnosis: perinephric, retroperitoneal bleed acute renal failure hyperbilirubinemia anemia hypertension   [**Hospital1 **] Condition: hemodynamically stable and afebrile   [**Hospital1 **] Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with flank and abdominal pain and found to have a bleed in your abdomen.
You were treated by interventional radiology and had embolization of actively bleeding arteries.
You were also treated for acute kidney failure, fluid overload with hemodialysis and intubation while you were having trouble breathing.
You will require close follow-up for your blood pressure and to make sure you are further evaluated by the urology service for your kidney mass.
Please make sure to follow-up with your physicans (appointments scheduled below) and have your coumadin level followed each week in coumadin clinic.
You need to have your coumadin checked first thing Monday morning ([**1-20**]) to ensure your INR is therapeutic.
Over the weekend please take your 3mg coumadin pills as you did prior to your admission.
For blood pressure control, your medications were changed to: amlodipine, carvedilol, and lisinopril.
You can continue taking your colchicine and tricor as before.
You will need to have your creatinine levels checked regularly as both of these medications may need to be adjusted based on kidney function.
to have your coumadin checked on Monday [**2166-1-20**].
