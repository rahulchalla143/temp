HOSPITAL COURSE:  On admission, the patient went for an emergent colonoscopy with diffuse blood seen throughout the colon except for the cecum, without a clear source of primary bleed.
His blood pressure decreased transiently to 52/25 at one point during the procedure but came up rapidly with minimal administration of intravenous fluids.
