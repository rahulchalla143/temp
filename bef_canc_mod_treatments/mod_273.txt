Admission Date:  [**2160-5-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-5-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-9-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Zithromax / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: Fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 79 yo M with h/o recurrent anaphylactoid reactions in the setting of viral/bacterial illnesses who now presents with fever and lethargy.
Because of his symptoms he went ahead and took his regimen of zyrtec and 20mg of prednisone.
As far as these anaphylactoid episodes are concerned, they date back to [**2151**] and almost always are preceeded by a viral prodrome which then progresses to a generalized urticarial rash, bronchospasm, and hypotension.
He had been admitted several times to the MICU and treated with steroids, bronchodilators, pressors, and antihistamines.
He has never been intubated for the bronchospasms.
He had started zyrtec and prednisone 3 days prior.
In the ED he was given levoflox and steroids; he was offered admission for obs but the pt declined.
He also received decadron 10 mg, levoflox, acetaminophen.
Usually treated with steroids and abx.
He was treated with levofloxacin for possible CAP, and given his history of anaphylactoid reactions in the setting of viral/bacterial illnesses, was treated with [**Doctor First Name 130**], zantac, steroids, albuterol PRN.
He was diuresed  and Vancomycin was added for broader coverage.
Blood cultures were sent and steroids were stopped.
In the ICU a foley catheter and an arterial line were placed.
He had poor urine output which was treated with multiple IV fluid boluses with good response.
His blood pressure also improved iwth IV fluids and remained stable in the low 100's.
He was noted to he hypoxic down to the 80's and he was  treated with oxygen wby nsal cannula.
The allergy service was consulted and on their recommendation, steroids were re-started to treat possible mastocytosis.
These were ordered and specifically ordered to be added onto patient's admission blood samples as it was felt that doing the labs on later samples after time and treatment with steroids would be of no diagnostic value.
His acute renal failure improved with IV fluids and his creatinine was trending back down when patient was called out to the floor.
Upon review of his old labs during other hopsital stays, his platetes were noted to trend down on all admission.
All heparin products were stopped.
Patient was then started on Argatroban and Heme-Onc consult was placed.
Heme-onc was uncertain if this was truely HIT and therefore anticoagulation was stopped with repeat labs sent and outpatient follow up scheduled.
#DM: Patient's outpatient oral hypoglycemics were held secondary to poor PO intake and he was covered with an insulin sliding scale with good control of his blood glucose levels.
Patient's home dose of atorvastatin was continued.
#Prophylaxis: Patient received pepcid and bowel regimen; He was started on heparin but was noted to have decreasing platelets.
Heparin was stopped.
