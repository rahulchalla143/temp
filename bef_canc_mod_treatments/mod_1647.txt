Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for admission Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old man with h/o colon adenoca, s/p open sigmoidectomy for colonic adenoca [**2149-6-12**], COPD, DM, EtOH cirrhosis, who is admitted to the ICU with hypotension, malaise and failure to thrive.
Hypotension: Patient with slightly lower BP than baseline, which is likely [**2-27**] to acute blood loss given the ongoing blood in the stool and lower HCT despite diuresis at the rehab.
He was transfused 1 unit PRBCs with appropriate increase in his HCT to 33.
His home diruertics and nadolol were held throughout ICU course.
This was felt to be reflective of hypovolemic hyponatremia due to diuretics vs cirrhosis.
A CT was done which demonstrated submassive PEs in the right upper anterior lobe (4:46) and lateral right middle lobe (4:80) subsegmental pulmonary arteries.
The patient was started on a heparin gtt.
He was ultimately transitioned to lovenox sc as cannot take warfarin given history of cancer.
# Abdominal distension- On HD 1 the patient was noted to have abdominal distension without associated pain.
Given recent antibiotic therapy the patient was started on flagyl for empiric coverage of c. diff.
Colorectal surgery was consulted and did not think pt had evidence of pseudo/partial obstruction, Ogilvies or or any other acute abdominal pathology.
Pt was noted to have copious ascitic drainage from midline surgical incision.
Notably, his lasix and spironolactone had been held during ICU course.
On HD 4 a wound vac was placed in the middle of his incision and continued to drain copius amounts of ascites throughout his hospitalization.
Due to the increasing bloody bowel movements, the heparin Lovenox  was stopped and heparin drip restarted.
He recieved on unit of PRBC then.
Ceftriaxone was dc'd.
His pressures began to drop during the surgery and the decision was made to finish at that point and send him to the ICU with an open belly and plan to close the next day once he stablizies.
Please refer to the operative report for more details on the procedure/ He went to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] postop intubated and with an open abdomen.
Throughout that night and the next day he required maximal pressor support and his HR was elevated to the 140's consistently and even to the 170's sometimes.
He remained in a septic but stable state the rest of the day and the decision was made to take him back to the OR on HD 8 POD 1 for another ex-lap and washout.
During this procedure, partial colectomy; end ileostomy and colostomy was done.
He was again sent to the ICU intubated and with an open abdomen with intention to close in a few days time.
His pressors were discontinued then and he passed away a little while later at 3:25 am.
