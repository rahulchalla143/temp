The patient's atrial fibrillation had been rate controlled in the past on diltiazem, but the patient was determined not to be a candidate for anticoagulation due a history of poor medication compliance and a history of melena and hematemesis secondary to gastric polyps.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Multivitamin, meclizine, Cordarone, metoprolol, Procardia, and Accupril (not entirely clear which medications the patient had been taking as an outpatient).
He was having atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and did receive a small amount of diltiazem which slowed his heart rate; however, he continued to have respiratory distress with a decline in his oxygen saturation.
Because of this, a code status was held with the son who felt that everything should be done for his father.
Thus, he was intubated and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
RESPIRATORY:  The patient's respiratory decline was felt to be secondary to an aspiration pneumonia, and decline in mental status, and mucus plugging.
He had thick yellow secretions suctioned once intubated and was started initially on Augmentin and then was switched to levofloxacin and Flagyl for the pneumonia and a urinary tract infection.
The patient remained intubated until [**4-26**], at which time he was extubated.
He continued to maintain his oxygen saturation without difficulty, though he was put on a shovel mask with moist mist.
CARDIOVASCULAR:   From a cardiac standpoint, the patient was given intravenous Lopressor p.r.n.
For the time being, he was placed on intravenous labetalol for blood pressure control and once an nasogastric tube was placed he was then started on Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
He did have an episode on the floor of a rapid heart rate which responded well to 5 mg of intravenous Lopressor, and he continued to maintain a good blood pressure throughout.
The patient is not an anticoagulation candidate and was simply continued on an aspirin.
Initially, the son was reticent to have percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed, but once he understood that this would be required in order to maintain his father and that an nasogastric tube could not be kept in for a prolonged period, the patient underwent a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement on [**2154-5-2**], with tube feeds started.
