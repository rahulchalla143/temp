Her myasethenia medications were continued and not changed per neuromuscular recommendations; in fact, her myasthenia remained at baseline and was likely not the reason for her dyspnea.
She was started on CPAP overnight, which she tolerated for approximately 6 hours.
She did not like it only because it was not humidified (unable to obtain a humidified CPAP within the hospital) and therefore made her throat sore and dry.
Her COPD regimen was changed to standing atrovent q6h and prn albuterol.
