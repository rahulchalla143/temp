In the setting of vertebral body chance fracture, this may represent a laceration (probably grade 3), though, given the adjacent surgical clips and lack of perihepatic fluid, other consideration includes post-operative sequelae.
Extensive multilevel vertebral signal abnormalities, raise the possibility of neoplastic disease, as opposed to trauma.

Right jugular line ends centrally.
Orthopedic Spine surgery was consulted; he was taken to the operating room on [**2173-6-5**] for T3-L3 posterior fusion.
He was eventually extubated and was noted to become agitated; he was given Haldol once with no further episodes of agitation.
The decision was made to give 1 unit packed red cells when his hematocrit dropped to 22.
Because of his rib fractures and pain associated with this he has not been able to effectively cough, deep breathe and use the incentive spirometer and therefore has required supplemental oxygen at 2 liters/ minute via nasal cannula.
He is on scheduled Tylenol and prn Oxycodone.
He was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and is being recommended for rehab after his acute hospital stay.
