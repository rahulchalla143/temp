He was initially treated for presumed systolic CHF exacerbation and COPD with CPAP, IV Solumedrol, nebulizers, Lasix, and Nitrates.
He was also given a dose of IV Levaquin out of concern for infection but his respiratory rate declined and his ABG's demonstrated severe respiratory acidosis so he was intubated in the [**Hospital3 **] ED.
He was placed on a Heparin gtt, ASA, beta-blocker, and a statin.
The following morning, his respiratory status improved and he was extubated and placed on BIPAP before being transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] at family request.
