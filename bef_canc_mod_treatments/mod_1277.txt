Initially he was treated with conservative medical management on Nitroglycerin drip, changed to Nitropaste, Heparin drip and Lopressor.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and the patient was scheduled for a coronary artery bypass graft.
He was transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiac Recovery Room, being atrially paced at a rate of 75 per minute, sedated on Propofol and intubated.
As a result he was not put on any Lasix and his BUN, creatinine and urine output were closely monitored.
His postoperative course was also complicated by some drainage from his chest wall which was initially felt to be from his chest tube sites, however, he was found to have some scant sternotomy wound drainage which eventually decreased and the patient was 24 hours without drainage at the time of discharge.
He received a dose of Vancomycin and his Vancomycin level remained around 14 at the time of discharge.
