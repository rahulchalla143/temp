She was given very gentle IV hydration, since the electrolytes were also consistent with dehydration.
She was requiring a nonrebreather to sustain oxygen saturation greater than 95%.
Initially Lasix was just used and towards the end of her time on the floor, she was given Natrecor with some improvement.
Her initial urine showed possible infection and so she was treated with Levaquin and Flagyl.
