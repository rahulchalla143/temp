Cardiac catheterization on that admission revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 48%, three to four plus mitral regurgitation, 30% left main coronaries without flow limiting stenosis.
Mitral valve surgery was delayed due to the recent onset of stroke.
The patient's symptoms subsequently improved and the patient is now being admitted for mitral valve repair.
Status post back surgery times two.
Potassium chloride.
Atenolol 100 mg p.o.
Ativan 0.5 mg p.o.
Xanax 0.25 mg p.o.
Klonopin 0.5 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.
The patient tolerated to procedure well and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
The patient was transferred on Milrinone for a decreased ejection fraction by echocardiogram seen in the Operating Room.
Immediately postoperatively the patient was noted to have large amounts of chest tube drainage.
The patient's coagulopathy was corrected and the patient was subsequently taken back to the Operating Room for re-exploration for bleeding.
The patient remained on Milrinone and the patient had been begun on amiodarone for bursts of atrial fibrillation.
Bilateral chest tubes were placed.
Chest tubes put out minimal amounts and the patient had developed large amounts of secretions being suctioned from his endotracheal tube.
It was decided to perform a bronchoscopy on the patient.
The patient tolerated this procedure well.
The patient continued to have episodes of atrial fibrillation and continued on amiodarone and Milrinone.
The patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical intubation on postoperative day number two.
The Milrinone was weaned to off with an adequate cardiac index.
The patient was started on diuretics.
The patient was started on a heparin drip for his continued atrial fibrillation.
Beta blocker was in place.
The patient tolerated this procedure well.
The patient has remained in sinus rhythm, anti-coagulated on Coumadin and the patient is cleared for discharge on [**2115-6-22**], postoperative day number ten.

on [**8-2**] and [**6-24**]; PT INR to be checked by visiting nurse on [**6-24**] and results are to be called to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Month (only) 18082**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2660**] for further Coumadin dosing.
Coumadin is to be titrated for an INR of 2.0 to 2.5.
Mitral regurgitation status post mitral valve repair.
Atrial fibrillation status post Maze's procedure and status post cardioversion.
