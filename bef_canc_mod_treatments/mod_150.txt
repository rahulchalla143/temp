He went to the Cardiothoracics service for EGD and balloon dilation of pylorus on [**9-18**] with improvement of chest pressure and tolerated PO diet without sxs.
Despite Bipap, patient's VBGs/ABGs fluctuated and patient remained tachypneic 30-36 breaths/min with shallow breaths and inability to complete sentences from being so out of breath.
He was subsequently transferred to MICU service for further management and Bipap.
Patient had baseline 1st degree heart block and developed 2 episodes of Wenckebach, HD stable and asx one resolved spontaneously other after fluid bolus.
Underwent thymectomy [**2095**].

Patient was initiated on plasmaphersis and continued on biPAP.
He was transferred to Neuro step-down unit for further neurologic care and to complete 5 cycles of plasmaphereis.
Neurology: Patient was treated with IV solumedrol, mestinon and cellcept.
IV solumedrol dose of titrated up to 24mg QD.
As a result, his outpatient seroquel and celexa were held until he was re-evaluated and approved for a ground diet and thin liquids.
Strict pulmonary toilet given increased secretions on cholinesterase inhibitor, mestinon to prophylax against developing pneumonia.
Cardiology was consulted regarding pre-operative risk for J tube replacement.
Per cardiology, if stent more than 9 months from placement, reasonable to hold Plavix prior to surgery; however, would continue aspirin pre-operative.
At discharge, continued aspirin, statin and plavix (for history of CVA).
Heparin products were held and HIT Ab was sent which was subsequently negative.
Thrombocytopenia was either secondary to HIT 1 as heparin products were held and the platelet count recovered.
However, heparin was subsequently listed as an allergy to avoid recurrence of thrombocytopenia and risk of bleeding.
Additionally, a pressurized PICC line was placed that only requires saline flushes.
Nutrition: Receiving TPN with plan for J tube replacement when patient breathing more easily and more nutritionally replete.
Since patient has not fully recovered, it was discussed with patient and his wife that there would be an increased risk of precipitating another myasthenic crisis with surgery so soon after this past one.
Since he is DNI and is currently declining a tracheostomy, the risks would not outweigh the benefits of J tube placement this admission since he is already getting TPN can continue at rehab.
Patient initally failed speech and swallow and is now able to take ground solids and thin liquids.
He will continue on TPN and PO diet until his J tube is placed.
Plan for J tube placement in ~3 weeks if continues to recover from most recent myasthenic crisis.
TPN as above with insulin additive.
PPX: PPI, boots, aspiration precautions, strict pulm toilet.
ACCESS: PICC line pressurized requires saline flushes only.
