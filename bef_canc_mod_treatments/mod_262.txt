CAD: The patient has known CAD, s/p CABG in [**2135**] with previous placement if a [**Hospital1 **]-Ventricular pacer/ICD.
Given the patient's hypotension with SBP < 90, the patient was initially placed on a dopamine gtt in the ED.
Dopamine gtt was discontinued and the patient was instead loaded with amiodarone in the E.D.
On presentation the patient had a V-paced ECG without obvious changes consistent with ischemia.
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was already taking ASA, Lipitor, metoprolol and digoxin.
Initially the patient's digoxin was discontinued although his blood levels were not supra therapeutic on admission.
On discharge the patient's metoprolol was changed to Carvedilol given his depressed EF.
It was thought that the patient's hyperthyroidism may have instead accounted for his physical findings and all antibiotics were discontinued.
After the patient's SBP stabilized on [**3-6**], gentle lasix diuresis was initiated to effect a net diuresis of 700cc.
With improved rate control and pressure the patient was more effectively able to be diuresed with net diuresis of approximately 5-6 liters since admission with IV antibiotics, usually requiring lasix 40mg - 120mg IV qd to achieve goals of 500-1000cc/day.
The patient was transitioned to PO lasix with regimen of 60mg PO bid to keep I=O.
Upon discharge patient appeared euvolemic to mildly fluid overloaded with more aggressive diuresis limited by patient's creatinine, which was 2.1 on day of discharge (2.7 on admission).
Prior to discharge digoxin was added back to the [**Hospital 228**] medical regimen for improved ionotropy and to help prevent repeat hospitalization.
Additionally, given the patient's depressed EF, his beta blocker was changed from his outpatient regimen of metoprolol to carvedilol.
Rhythm - On admission, the patient presented in a fib with RVR, which was thought to be exacerbating patient's hypotension given pre-existing LV systolic dysfunction.
Of note, the patient previously had a biventricular ICD placed for depressed EF and ventricular dys synchrony.
The patient was initially started on amiodarone for rate and rhythm control which unfortunately failed to control the patient's rhythm.
Additionally, given the patient's previous pulmonary toxicity secondary to amiodarone, he was thought not to be a good candidate for long term amiodarone therapy.
AV nodal ablation was performed on [**3-7**], with excellent effect.
The patient is currently with a therapeutic INR of 2.3 with discharge medical regimen of Coumadin 2mg po qhs.
This will need to be monitored carefully and adjusted as needed given the patient's regimen had to be altered throughout his hospital course to allow for his procedures.
In the future the patient may benefit from attempted conversion using quinidine and DCCV to augment the patient's CO with a normal atrial kick  as per EP's recs.
Antibody testing was negative including anti-peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin, making Grave's disease less likely.
Additionally, the patient has not recently been treated with amiodarone therapy (greater than one year) making amiodarone effect not likely.
# ARF - Patient is reported to have baseline creatinine of 1.2 - 1.4 on previous admission.
On discharge the patient has a creatinine of 2.1 which will need continued monitoring as the patient continues therapy with lasix.
Patient was continued on outpatient regimen of Advair, spiriva and PRN albuterol (not used this admission).
B12 and Folate were checked this admission, both within normal limits.
# FEN - patient was maintained on a low sodium/cardiac/renal diet with fluid restriction < 1200cc/day.
The patient was instructed about a low sodium diet and instructed to weight himself daily to guide lasix therapy .
However, again he would NOT want compressions or intubation.

if your weight increases by more than 3 lbs from your baseline, you should call your cardiologist immediately to see if a change in your medical regimen may be warranted.
You are being discharged with coumadin which requires careful monitoring of your blood levels.
You were seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who recommended treatment with Methimazole.
