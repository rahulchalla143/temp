Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 69 year old female, multiple medical problems, who was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 **] admitted with SOB in setting of missed HD secondary to clotted AV graft, complicated by PEA arrest and intubation now presents w/ obtundation, found to be hypoglycemic in the field and now transferred to MICU for persistent hypoglycemia in the ED requiring D10 gtt and q1 FS checks.
Hypoglycemia: Differential diagnosis includes excessive insulin (most likely), missed meal, worsening renal failure with resultant decrease in insulin clearance, medication induced, sepsis, or an endocrinopathy.
It is possible that the patient mistakedly took too much of her insulin and we are still seeing the effects of the NPH.
Patient also has ESRD on HD and thus insulin could be hanging around longer.
Adrenal insufficiency possible, as pt on steroids chronically for h/o eosinophilic PNA, however, no hypotension or other symptoms.
Patient was initially maintained on a D10 gtt which was later d/ced.
Patient was also started on NHP insulin of 10 units at a reduced dose from her home regimen of 20 units.

Patient was treated with cipro for a UTI.

[**Name (NI) **] Continued pt's home regimen on HAART.
H/o eosinophilic pneumonia- Continued prednisone and bactrim prophylaxis while immunosuppressed (bactrim leading to hypoglycemia low on DDx.)
Coumadin apparently d/ced in [**Month (only) **]/05 and then re-started in [**7-23**] for popliteal DVT, was held initially then restarted on [**2115-9-25**].
