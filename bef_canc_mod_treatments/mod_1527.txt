UPRIGHT AP CHEST: The patient is post median sternotomy.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 yo female with h/o with CAD, AVR secondary to endocarditis, Hepatitis C and a history of GIB admitted with severe anemia, supertherapuritc INR, and chest pain.
Coagulopathy:  Pt has been taking coumadin for her AVR; also, she had been taking lovenox in the days prior to admission.
She was reversed with FFP and vit K with good effect.
Coumadin was restarted shortly after admission, and she was bridged with a heparin drip while waiting for INR levels to be therapeutic.
However, given that she received multiple doses of vitamin K at admission, it was difficult to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation.
After consulting with Dr. [**Name (NI) 437**], pt's cardiologist, felt that it was acceptable to use lovenox for bridge therapy.
Both she and her mother (with whom she lives) have used lovenox in the past, and they were taught once again, prior to discharge.
This was likely secondary to hypovolemia as it stablized after volume repletion.
She was restarted on enalapril and lasix, and she had no further episodes of hypotension.
CHF/Severe mitral regurgitation: The patient takes Lasix 40 mg daily as an outpatient.
This was held initially as she appeared stable despite receiving multiple blood transfusions.
Daily lasix was restarted when pt c/o SOB and had pitting edema in lower extremities; did not have rales and never has rales as a manifestation of volume overload.
She was followed by plastics in-house who recommended that she continue dressing changes daily.
H/o IV drug use - Continue methadone and given letter for home service prior to d/c to make sure pt has medication at home.
Seizure d/o: Continued tegretol at home dose.
