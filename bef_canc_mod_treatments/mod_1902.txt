On today's examination, a complex-appearing hydrocele is again present in the upper part of the right hemiscrotum with internal echoes and septations (images 1 through 4).
Normal color flow and waveforms are identified within the right testis using color and spectral Doppler analysis.
A 10-mm calcification adjacent to the brachiocephalic artery (2:13) is stable from [**2163-10-10**].
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Surgical mesh for repair of the ventral hernia is stable.
No focal liver lesions are identified on this non-contrast CT. Post-surgical clips from prior right adrenalectomy are noted.
A Foley catheter is noted in the lumen of the gallbladder.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 77002**] is a 58 year old male with history of atrial fibrillation (on coumadin), diastolic heart failure, s/p [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] (on mycophenolate, cyclosporine, prednisone immunosuppresion), failed pancreas [**Known lastname **], hypertension, admitted for injuries sustained after mechanical fall and dyspnea, transferred to MICU for hypoxia.
Temporal association of increasing hypoxia s/p FFP tranfusion raises suspicion of fluid overload (transfusion association circulatory overload).
He was treated with diuresis and antibiosed for 8 days with vancomycin/zosyn/levofloxacin for HCAP.
He was never intubated or placed on bipap.
He was weaned off high flow mask and was satting well on nasal cannula so was transferred to the general medicine floor.
He was -1.8L fluid after ICU stay with elevated JVD suggesting he was still volume up so he was continued on lasix at 80mg po BID per [**Month (only) **] recs.
He was discharged on lasix 60mg po BID.
On the floor, he was weaned off of oxygen with continued diuresis.
He was continued on his immunosuppressive regimen (mycophenolate, cyclosporine, and prednisone).
Cinacalcet was discontinued as patient's calcium was low.
Bactrim SS prophylaxis was continued throughout admission.
Per [**Year (4 digits) **] nephrology recommendations, patient was started on renogel 800mg TID with meals.
Creatinine bumped slightly with lasix, and lasix was decreased to 60mg [**Hospital1 **] at the time discharge.
His pain was controlled with tylenol, oxycodone and lidocaine patch and his hemotocrit remained stable.
Coumadin held and was reversed with FFP 4 units and vitamin K 5mg due to concern for RP bleed as above.
Restarted coumadin on [**2165-12-27**], and patient was slowly titrated up to 4mg on the day of discharge.
INR was 1.6 on the day of discharge, and patient will need INR checked at [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital3 **] on Tuesday [**1-7**].
