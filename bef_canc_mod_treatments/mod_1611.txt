She was admitted to the MICU at the OSH where she was given stress dose steroids, empiric vancomycin and levofloxacin, 4L IVF, and blood cultures drawn.
An attempt at a right subclavian central catheter prior to transport failed, and a right femoral line was placed instead.
She received versed and vecuronium and was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] by [**Location (un) 7622**].

A single right axillary lymph node measures 1 cm.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] T-SPINE W &W/O CONTRAST ([**2125-4-17**]): There are signs of extensive osseous abnormality of the mid thoracic spine with a prevertebral collection associated with bone and interspace abnormality.
Peripheral opacity in the left lung (series 3, image 49) appears improved compared to prior study.
An initial incision and drainage of the right hand abscess had been performed at the OSH.
Here, she was started on vancomycin with gentamycin at synergistic dosing for gram positive cocci on outside hospital cultures.
She received a course of Xigris and stress dose steroids.
When cultures showed MSSA on HD #2, vancomycin was changed to nafcillin.
Gentamycin was stopped after 5 days of synergistic dosing.
She was weaned off of pressor support by HD #4 and remained hemodynamically stable thereafter, although she remained intubated on mechanical ventilation to facilitate operative debridement of her right hand osteomyelitis.
Her chronic PICC for home TPN was removed at the outside hospital.
Left and right internal jugular central catheters placed since admission were removed, as well as her arterial line.
A new left subclavian catheter was placed.
However, she continued to remain febrile.
The orthopaedic spine service recommended a conservative approach with CT guided drainage of the paraspinal fluid collection.
The patient underwent successful CT guided drainage of the superficial abscess on the back, in addition to the paraspinal fluid collection (with a pigtail catheter left in place for drainage).
She was taken to the operating room for bilateral shoulder washouts, which she tolerated well.
Pain control: She was initially placed on a morphine PCA for pain control, but had difficulty operating the PCA.
She was changed to a fentanyl patch with IV Dilaudid boluses for breakthrough.
IV Dilaudid was transitioned to PO Dilaudid prior to discharge.
On discharge, her pain was well controlled on 25 mcg/hr fentanyl patch with 8mg PO Dilaudid Q2h for breakthrough pain.
Respiratory failure: The patient had developed respiratory failure at the OSH and arrived on mechanical ventilation.
Her ventilator settings were weaned, and she was clinically ready for extubation several days after admission.
However, she remained intubated for an additional [**12-11**] days because of planned hand surgery by plastic surgery.
She was reintubated on [**4-17**] for a TEE and again successfully extubated on [**4-17**] after the TEE.
Crohns: She was given a short course of stress dose steroids on arrival, as described above, and subsequently put on 4mg IV Solu-Medrol QD.
She was transitioned back to her home regimen of prednisone 5 mg PO QD prior to discharge.
She was maintained on TPN throughout her hospitalization for short gut syndrome.
It was initially run by continuous infusion, but was transitioned to a cycled regimen over 12 hours prior to discharge.
In addition to treatment of her underlying infection and pain control described above, she was given anxiolytics as needed.
Prophylaxis: She received heparin in her TPN for DVT prophylaxis.
