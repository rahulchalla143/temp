He presented to an outside hospital where an endotracheal tube was place and was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] for management.
He was intubated and in no apparent distress or discomfort.
A sputum culture from HD 2 showed Pseudomonas, which was considered to be a contaminant.

His tube feeds were restarted on POD 1.
The patient was kept at [**Hospital1 18**] for increased secretions requiring frequent suction.
