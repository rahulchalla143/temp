DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 7410**] DR. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4130**]   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted directly to the operating room where he had an Aortic valve replacement andc coronary bypass grafting.
In summary he had an AVR(#27 [**Company 1543**] Mosaic tissue valve and CABG x2 with LIMA-LAD and RIMA-RCA.
A right femoral arterial line was placed in the Operating Room through a prior graft.
He tolerated the operation well, and was transferred from the operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition.
Vascular surgery was consulted (they were familiar with him from his prior procedure) and the femoral line was maintained with a heparin infusion overnight.
Postoperatively CXR showed right upper lobe collapse and he subsequently underwent a bronchoscopy.
Vascular surgery opted to take him to the Operating Room to evaluate the flow, and a thrombectomy of left lower extremity common femoral artery to peroneal artery bypass vein graft, balloon angioplasty of the left femoral artery to peroneal artery bypass graft, and balloon angioplasty of the distal anastamosis at distal AT/DP.
Right arterial line was pulled in the Operating Room by the vascular team without incidence.
He was continued on heparin gtt and started on Coumadin.
His diuretics were discontinued and his creatinine was back down to baseline (1.1) at the time of discharge.
He remained hemodynamically stable after resuscitation and was extubated the following day.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery protocol.
He went into rapid atrial fibrillation at that time and started on an amiodarone bolus and drip and Lopressor was increased.
He converted to sinus rhythm and remained in sinus for 24 hours prior to discharge.
He was started on warfarin to which he was extremely sensitive.
He received FFP to correct this and warfarin was held for 2 days.
He was slightly confused and all narcotics were discontinued and he cleared.
He was continued on Coumadin for anticoagulation for vascular issues and his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
