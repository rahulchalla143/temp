He complained of left forearm pain, nose pain (fracture nose last week with planned surgical repain in [**State 531**] in [**3-14**] weeks), and headache.
He had been living alone and has a tendencey to either over take medication or undertake medication when not supervised.
He was supposed to go to physical therapy and had missed his appointment this morning prior to the accident.
Remeron and Trileptal were tapered out of concern that these medications could be contributing to his altered mental status.
Since the patient has no indication for being on Trileptal with the exception of a possible history of basilar migraines, we conferred with his psychiatrist who agreed that this medication was unnecessary and could be contributing to the patient's falls.
Also it is likely that the patient's numerous  psychotropic medications in the setting of his leukocytosis have been attributed to his unsteady gate.
The patients mental status dramatically improved with antibiotics and IV hydration during this admission.
