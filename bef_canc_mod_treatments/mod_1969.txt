Seen by Pulm and Sleep who recommend BiPAP at night and at day as needed.
Improved with BiPAP qHS and diuresis.
Pt continued nebulizer treatments and inhaled steroids throughout admission.
She did not receive systemic steroids.
Pt's respiratory status improved with diuresis approximately 9L, BiPAP at night, and was successfully weaned off oxygen.
Lasix drip and fluid restriction was started on the floor.
The patient was placed on supplemental O2 on the floor.
Albuterol nebs were given.
In the CCU, pt continued diuresis with lasix drip (approximately 9L) and was intermittently on Bipap.
Lasix gtt was stopped and she was transitioned back to PO torsemide on the cardiology service, and maintained at approximately ins = output.
Creatinine rose again in the setting of aggressive diuresis and hypotension, but improved upon discharge after gentle bolus (500cc) of IVF.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: On admission, pt had supratheraputic INR to 6.2 and coumadin was held.
She was given 1mg vitamin K to reverse INR so that patient could go on to right heart catheterization, she did not end up getting procedure, INR normalized and coumadin was restarted.
Pt's carvedilol was held for hypotension in CCU and uptitrated to home dose as BP tolerated, then changed to metoprolol to minimize bronchospastic component.
Lisinopril held in setting of hypotension and elevated cr, restarted at 20mg, but ultimately discontinued because she became hypotensive to as low as 80/palp.
# HTN: Continued home meds (clonidine,carvedilol) as BP tolerated.
Lisinopril initally held, restarted at 20mg on [**8-10**], discontinued because she became hypotensive.
# BLOOD PRESSURE:  Normotensive with SBP in 110-120s on discharge.
HYPERTENSION: - Continued clonidine at reduced dose - Changed carvedilol to metoprolol for redued bronchospasm in the setting of reactive airway disease - Torsemide dose decreased - Lisinopril held on admission, attempted to restart on [**8-10**] at 20mg (half of home dose), but pt developed symptomatic hypotension, so it was discontinued indefinitely HYPOTENSION:  Normotensive on discharge.
Developed hypotension [**2202-8-10**] in setting of restarting [**12-7**] of home lisinopril 20mg and increasing torsemide to 80mg.
Gave gentle fluid bolus 500cc IVF, with appropriate improvement in BP and orthostasis.
Given nystatin SS.
