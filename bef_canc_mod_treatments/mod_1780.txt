# Sepsis / Hypotension / Fevers - While the patient did have a downward-trending WBC on admission, her high fevers and hypotension requiring pressors made sepsis the likely cause of her symptoms.
She was started on cefepime and daptomycin, based off of her medical history.
She will need 4 wks total of daptomycin (last dose 08/04) and to follow-up in ID urgent care clinic in one week when VNA can fax blood culture results to ID doctor (name listed in follow-up instructions) She will need weekly CBC/ Diff, CK, BUN/Cr as an outpatient on daptomycin.
