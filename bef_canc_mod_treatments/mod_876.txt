On discharge, plan was for colectomy per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2157-9-13**].
Past Medical History: (1) Splenectomy in [**2151-11-24**] when he had resection of a benign pancreatic mass at [**Hospital1 2025**].
bone marrow biopsy on [**2153-3-1**] consistent with myeloproliferative disorder (polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **])...as well as an abnormal karyotype with deletion 20q in 3 out of 20 metaphases increasing his risk of hypercoagulability.
(6) High-risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with radical prostatectomy on [**2151-5-31**], with no evidence of disease recurrence since that time.
(10) h/o thrombophlebitis in left leg (11) uveitis (12) C4-C5 radiculopathy (13) HLD (14) HTN (15) recurrent autoimmune pericarditis (16) h/o benign pancreatic cyst s/p resection   Social History: Lives with wife, has grown children.
Increased large bowel dilation from the cecum to the junction of the descending and sigmoid colon, with transition point noted in the left lower quadrant at the junction of the sigmoid colon with the descending colon, in a region which has been chronically inflammed by diverticulitis as noted on prior studies.
Status post distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, with left upper quadrant splenosis.
Status post prostatectomy with unchanged left pelvic side wall soft tissue nodule which remains suspicious for recurrence.
This may be benign pneumatosis in thisopatient on steroids and ventilated, but correlation and follow up to exclude ischemix injury is recommended.
Residual left hydropneumothorax with pigtail catheter in situ.
Patchy opacity in right cardiophrenic region slightly worse.
Feeding tube ends in the upper stomach.
Tracheostomy tube in place.
Brief Hospital Course: [**2157-8-22**]: sigmoid colectomy + diverting ileostomy [**2157-9-6**]: Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and therapeutic aspiration [**2157-9-12**]: ex-lap, removal of mesh from previous hernia repair, abdominal washout [**2157-9-13**]: emergent exlap, hematoma evacuation, abdominal packing, temporary closure [**2157-9-14**]: exlap, removal of packing, closure fascia [**2157-9-15**]: perc trach [**2157-9-19**]: exlap, hematoma evacuation, closure of leak site at anastamosis [**2157-9-22**]: left index finger amputation [**2157-9-26**]: pigtail catheter placement for L pleural effusion [**2157-9-29**]: bronchoscopy, removal of mucous plugging [**2157-9-30**]: bronchoscopy, removal of mucous plugging [**2157-10-17**]: bronchoscopy, removal of mucous plugging  The pt was admitted on [**2157-8-21**] with a large bowel obstruction.
He was taken to the OR on [**2157-8-22**] for an exploratory laparotomy with sigmoid colectomy and diverting ileostomy for diverticular stricture.
His postop course was complicated by retroperitoneal bleed, pulmonary embolism, RUE DVT, pseudomonal pneumonia, need for tracheostomy, recurrent mucous plugging, as well as significant pain and musculoskeletal spasm issues.
He required numerous operative procedures as outlined above as well as a prolonged stay in the ICU.
By the end of his hospitalization, he was able to sit at the edge of the bed, was taking PO using chin tuck as recommended by the Speech and Swallow therapists and was taken off of his tube feeds.
Neuro: Pt had post-operative pain which was treated with various pain medications throughout his complicated course.
He has experienced significant deconditioning and will require aggressive physical therapy in order to regain his previous functional status.
He is currently doing well on his regimen of Tylenol, Fent patch, Neurontin, tizanidine, ativan, with oxycodone or dilaudid for breakthrough.
Slow weaning of his narcotics should take place over time with a goal to have him off narcotics over the next few weeks to months.
CV: The patient had episodes of hypertension treated with beta blockers and hydralazine but also tachycardia and hypotension related to his bleeding episodes.
At discharge, he was on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **].
Most likely due to the placement of a L radial arterial line, the patient had ischemia to his L index finger, the tip of which ultimately necrosed, requiring amputation by the Hand Service.
He ultimately required tracheostomy on [**9-15**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and has since been weaned back down to trach collar/Passy-Muir valve and has tolerated this well.
He also had a PE treated with hep gtt, argatroban gtt, and transitioned to warfarin prior to discharge.
Earlier in his hospital course, he required numerous bronchoscopies in order to reinflate his lungs (mostly the left lung) and remove clinically significant mucous plugs.
He will hopefully move towards decannulation as his overall functional status recovers.
GI: The patient underwent sigmoid colectomy with primary reanastamosis and diverting loop ileostomy.
He required TPN for a significant portion of his stay, was then transitioned to enteral feedings per Dobhoff, and ultimately was able to begin taking POs and his Dobhoff was removed prior to discharge.
However, due to the patient's chronic steroid use for his sarcoidosis, he experienced a relative steroid deficiency (specifically aldosterone with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia) requiring treatment with fludrocortisone.
He was then slowly weaned off the fludrocortisone without issue.
Thus, he was maintained on a heparin gtt, which was then switched to argatroban due to this concern.
He was also restarted on his hydroxyurea with alternating hydroxyurea doses of 500mg and 1000 mg every other day.
ID: The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by VRE sepsis, as well as a pseudomonal ventilator associated pneumonia, requiring treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics.
His antibiotic treatments are summarized as follows: vancomycin ([**Date range (1) 29441**]), meropenem ([**Date range (1) 51012**] ), fluconazole ([**Date range (1) 51013**]), flagyl ([**8-26**]- [**9-1**], [**Date range (1) 51014**]), Linezolid (9/8-10-11), ceftaz ([**9-16**] - [**9-29**]), cipro ([**Date range (1) 51015**]), cefepime ([**Date range (1) 51016**]), vanc/cipro/zosyn ([**Date range (1) 51017**]).
He has been off abx since [**10-18**].
Endo: He was maintained on a sliding scale throughout his hospital stay.
Wound: The patient's wound is currently being treated with a V.A.C.
