Admission Date:  [**2116-12-17**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2042-8-14**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname 2048**] [**Known lastname 10680**] is a 74-year-old female with extensive past medical history including breast cancer, status post mastectomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease status post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**Month (only) 359**], and cardiac catheterization showing three-vessel disease status post stents times two.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 10680**] was diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer in [**2116-8-24**] and underwent left upper lobectomy on [**10-6**], which was complicated by respiratory decompression secondary to mucous plugging as well as Pseudomonas pneumonia and Klebsiella pneumonia.
She also previously was treated for CMV colitis with Ganciclovir.
She is status post tracheostomy with Passy-Muir valve.
She was doing well until [**12-17**], when she suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest, felt to be secondary to a primary respiratory arrest in the setting of mucus plugging.
She was transferred to the Medical ICU for further management of her respiratory failure.
Squamous cell lung cancer, status post left thoracotomy and left upper lobectomy, [**2116-10-6**], status post mediastinal lymph node dissection [**2116-10-8**].
Status post tracheostomy, [**2116-10-27**] with Passy-Muir valve for respiratory failure.
CMV colitis, status post treatment with Ganciclovir.
TPN dependent.
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.q.d.
Captopril 50 mg t.i.d.
Prednisone 20 mg as part of a taper.
CURRENT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the patient to be afebrile with the heart rate of 80, blood pressure 120/60, respirations 18, oxygen saturation 99% on ventilator setting of pressor support of 15; PEEP 5, FI02 40%; observed tidal volumes ranging from 280 to 350.
LABORATORY DATA:  The most recent labs revealed a white count of 11,000, hematocrit 33, platelet count 222,000, PT 13.8, PTT 26.4, INR 1.3, sodium 133, potassium 3.7, chloride 97, bicarbonate 30, BUN 20, creatinine .5, glucose 147, ALT 11, AST 17, alkaline phosphatase 69, total bilirubin 0.3, calcium 7.7, phosphorus 3.4, magnesium 1.8, albumin 2.6.
Radiology reports multiple chest x-rays, performed after admission, demonstrated tracheostomy tube in place 5-cm above the carina, total opacity of the left hemithorax with shift of the heart and the mediastinum to the left indicating total collapse of the left lung.
Chest x-ray on [**12-28**], showed some improved re-aeration of the left lung status post bronchoscopy, but persistent collapse and some shift of the heart and mediastinum to the left.
There remains extensive left sided volume loss likely due to a combination of left upper lobectomy and partial collapse of the left lower lobe.
Note was made of a blood clot in the junction of the left pulmonary vein and left atrium, which had been noted on a prior CT scan and had been evaluated by echocardiography and felt to be a lower embolism given its location in a vein, which was then tied off during left upper lobectomy and not in communication with a dynamic contractile structure.
RESPIRATORY:  Little progress was achieved in reversing the patient's persistent left lower lobe collapse and subsequently weaning her off the ventilator.
She currently remained on a low level of pressure support with adequate tidal volumes and no respiratory distress.
She has required serial bronchoscopy for clearance of thick tenacious secretions.
Interventional pulmonary was consulted regarding possible stent placement for this tracheomalacia, however, this was not felt likely be of therapeutic advantage for this patient.
Consideration was also given to possible completion pneumonectomy on the left; however, consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**], the patient's thoracic surgeon was obtained and it was not felt to be a viable option at this time given the patient's overall poor nutritional status and questionable therapeutic benefit.
Throughout her Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient was noted to have significant bronchospasm and she was treated aggressively with inhaled corticosteroids, beta agonist, Atrovent, and a low-dose steroid taper, with subsequent improvement in her bronchospasm and overall improvement in respiratory function.
She was also treated with a 14-day course of Vancomycin for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bronchitis with subsequent improvement in the amount and consistency of her secretions.
It is unclear at this point what the patient's prognosis is, as far as weaning off the ventilator.
She has, over the course of her Intensive Care Unit stay, shown significant improvement in re-aeration of the left lung; however, she has been slow to wean off the ventilator and has required repeated bronchoscopy several times a week.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient required escalating doses of Captopril in order to maintain her blood pressure in a normal range.
She is currently hemodynamically stable on Captopril 50 mg three times a day with blood pressures ranging in the range of systolic pressure of 110 to 140.
She has been continued on her Amiodarone for control of her intermittent atrial fibrillation; however, has not been in atrial fibrillation during her Intensive Care Unit stay.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient completed a two-week course of Vancomycin for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bronchitis.
Flagyl for Clostridium difficile colitis.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient has a history of CMV colitis status post treatment with Ganciclovir.
She has failed feeding attempts both through the NG tube and oral, with episodes of ischemic colitis with each feeding attempt.
She will not be able to undergo abdominal surgery until her nutrition status is optimized and the pulmonary status optimized.
Plan is for her to continue on TPN throughout pulmonary rehabilitation and return for colectomy at a later date.
The patient underwent both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram to further evaluate the clot in this vessel.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient has remained euvolemic.
She continues on TPN with plans to continue this indefinitely until definitive bowel resection can be performed to treat her ischemic colitis.
She has an indwelling PICC line in the left arm for TPN and any needed IV medications.
The patient and her family desire aggressive measures to attempt eventual weaning off the ventilator.
Further attempts to wean the patient off the ventilator will be undertaken at rehabilitation.
She should continue on TPN at rehabilitation and return for bowel resection once nutritionally optimized.
An addendum will follow this dictation listing the patient's final discharge diagnosis and discharge medications prior to transfer to the rehabilitation facility.
