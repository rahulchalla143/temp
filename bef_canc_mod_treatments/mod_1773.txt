Admission Date:  [**2157-7-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2157-7-20**]   Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]/MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, non-small-cell lung cancer, status post left pneumonectomy, and bladder cancer, status post transurethral resection, who presented to the [**Hospital6 1760**] Emergency Room on the evening of [**2157-7-18**] after transfer from [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital.
The patient was in her usual state of health until earlier on the morning of [**7-18**] when she was walking in her home, felt her walker begin to get away from her, and fell forward in her bedroom.
On arrival at the [**Hospital6 256**], the patient denied headache, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, abdominal pain, vertigo, or dysphagia.
Neurosurgical evaluation was undertaken; the Neurosurgery Consult Team felt there was no need for emergent neurosurgical intervention for the subdural hematoma.
Because of her high INR, secondary to the Coumadin, which she was taking for her atrial fibrillation, the patient was administered fresh frozen plasma and Vitamin K to correct her coagulopathy.
After fresh frozen plasma and Vitamin K, the patient's INR dropped to 1.6.
At that point, more fresh frozen plasma and intravenous Vitamin K was administered.
She revealed that she did not wish to pursue neurological intervention should her hemorrhage enlarge.
Given her neurologic stability and her lack of desire for neurosurgical intervention, the patient was discharged to home on the afternoon of [**2157-7-20**] with arrangements made for home nursing and home Physical Therapy.
