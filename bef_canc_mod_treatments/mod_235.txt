ICU  ADDENDUM:  The patient remained in the ICU from [**9-14**] through [**9-19**] awaiting placement at Rehabilitation-I.
Pulmonary:  The patient continued on Lasix for empiric volume overload treatment.
He continued on levofloxacin for Serratia pneumonia.
Additionally, he was started on prednisone 60 mg PO q d for empiric treatment of Dressler's syndrome.
The patient's case was presented at a pulmonary conference and the consensus of opinion was that he had enough features consistent with Dressler's syndrome, also known as post cardiotomy syndrome, to warrant treatment with steroids.
The treatment plan was for seven days at 60 mg of prednisone a day.
The patient had his pressure support ventilation decreased to 5 of pressure support and 5 of PEEP.
We suspect that with daily weaning of his ventilation assistance, he may be able to be completely weaned from the ventilator in a short period of time.
On [**9-17**], his INR drifted below this range and he was on hirudin for 24 hours.
CT Surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] and they instructed us that, because his mitral valve was a mosaic bioprosthesis, he does not require any anticoagulation for his valve.
On discharge, his INR was 1.9 and his daily Coumadin dose had been increased from 2 mg to 2.5 mg on [**9-18**].
Lasix is now 80 mg PO b.i.d.. 2.
Coumadin is now 2.5 mg PO q d.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Unchanged from previous summary.
FOLLOW-UP:  Unchanged from previous summary.
