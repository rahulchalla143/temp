male with history of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] who presented to [**Hospital1 **] with complaints of fatigue, "low vision" and nausea, and decreased function of his hands, b/l hip pain, constipation x 1 week.
While being worked up was found to have a low-grade fever (per wife- baseline temp is 94-95F) and UTI for which he received Ceftriaxone and Vancomcyin and was also hyponatremic to 120.
He was given NS and shortly thereafter had two seizures and bit his tongue during one of them with bleeding and was thus intubated for airway protection in addition to receiving a total of 3 mg IV Ativan.
Of note, patient does not have a history of seizure disorder and is not on seizure medications.
Meningitis was on the differential, though not felt to be very likely and given his clinical instability, an LP was deferred and Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin were continued.
HEENT: NCAT, R corneal hyphema at 3 0'clock, anicteric sclera, blood from mouth, + tongue trauma.
Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina.
VIDEO SWALLOW OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION:  An oral and pharyngeal swallow evaluation was performed in conjunction with speech and pathology department.
Under continuous videofluoroscopy, barium of various consistencies was administered orally to the patient.
Bolus control was mildly reduced with premature spillover into the pharynx.
Epiglottic deflection was incomplete, although NG tube presence may have been partially responsible.
A mild coating of residue remained in the vallecula and piriform sinuses after liquids and solids.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: There was penetration before the swallow with thin liquids, nectar thick liquids and pureed solids.
CXR [**2142-3-15**] PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Nasogastric tube is seen with tip overlying the stomach, with residual contrast material within the stomach.

male with MS who presented wtih UTI and [**Year (4 digits) **] s/p seizures x 2.
He was loaded with dilantin and then transitioned to Keppra.
Given that this was symptomatic [**Month/Day (2) **] and not clearly hypovolemic in nature, slow infusion of hypertonic saline was used to increase sodium by [**2-24**] mEq.
The importance of fluid restriction was discussed (previously drinking 3 liters per day free water).
UTI / PROTEUS, YEAST Patient has a history of recurrent UTIs s/p suprapubic catheter.
Cultures from OSH grew Klebsiella sensitive to ceftriaxone and he completed a 7 day course.
Suprapubic catheter was changed on [**3-9**].
His urine continued to grow yeast, and he was started on 5 days of fluconazole on [**2142-3-15**].
A modified soft solid diet with thin liquids was recommended after video swallow.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE Patient reportedly has a history of restrictive lung disease, which is evidenced on CXR, though by history, he was only intubated for airway protection in the setting of a seizure.
He initially had higher than anticipated oxygenation requirements, but this improved with treatment of his pneumonia.
He was pancultured for these in the ICU but cultures were all negative or no growth to date.
He had several swings in his blood pressure, for which iv medication for hypertensive urgency (BP 200/100) were avoided.
HTN Initially with borderline hypotension requiring decrease in hypertension regimen.
Eventually HTN worsened - added back home regimen (clonidine and beta blockade) plus hydralazine and amlodipine.
He was transitioned to carvedilol from lopressor.
BP was overall quite labile and required frequent adjustment of his regimen.
