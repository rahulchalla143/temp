RENAL U.S. Study Date of [**2168-10-10**] 1:25 PM IMPRESSION: Left nephrostomy tube in expected location.
This is plausible since the patient's NG tube was to suction for some time.
Impression: Mucosa suggestive of short segment Barrett's esophagus Ulcer in the stomach body Pills in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: 77M with h/o CAD s/p CABG and stent placement, pacemaker, hemorrhagic frontal CVA [**2152**], prior DVT and PE, BPH, type 2 DM, Hypertension, ulcerative colitis (with h/o of admissions for GI bleeding) transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with GI bleed and septic shock due to UTI with obstructive kidney stone.
- Zosyn empirically for gram negative and anaerobe coverage in the setting of recent instrumentation/hospitalization, which was changed on [**10-8**] to ceftriaxone with sensitivities.
Concern was for infected fluid collection behind stone so he underwent nephrostomy tube placement by IR to drain renal pelvic space behind stone.
They recommended leaving nephrostomy tube in place until definitive stone treatment can be done, which is to be arranged when patient is stabilized with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 986**] at NWH.
At the rehab he should have a daily potassium check, and supplementation as needed.
He may require chronic oral supplementation, but would not initiate this until he is clinically stable.
# Upper GI bleed due to gastric ulcers: Initially presented to outside hospital with coffee-ground emesis.
GI recommended placing patient on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] and Erythromycin to help propagate the bezoar.
He will remain on both the PPI and erythromycin until presenting to his followup GI appointment  # Fall: Patient had fall at home prior to presentation.
This is abberent conduction, and was evaluated by the EP service with his primary cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who concurred that there is no need for urgent intervention.
Improved with hydration, treatment of sepsis, and nephrostomy placement.
Most likely parkinson's or vascular EP syndrome but in the setting of enlarged ventricles on CT head, urinary incontinence and his h/o recurrent fall.
# CAD s/p CABG / chronic systolic CHF / Benign Hypertension: ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 35-45% at baseline.
ASA was held and remains held until the lithotripsy.
# Type 2 Diabetes Controlled without Complications: Continued standing NPH and sliding scale  # Depression - continued lexapro, seroquel, ritalin  # Constipation - patient became highly constipated, but was succesfully treated with PEG over 3 days.
