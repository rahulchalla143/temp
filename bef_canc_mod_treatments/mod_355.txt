[**2183-8-26**] CHEST X-RAY FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in extent of the pre-existing bilateral pleural effusions.
[**2183-8-29**] CHEST X-RAY In comparison with the study of [**8-28**], there is continued substantial pulmonary edema with bilateral effusions and compressive atelectasis in a patient with previous CABG and dual-channel pacemaker device in place.
Brief Hospital Course: 88M history of AF with tachy/brady syndrome s/p PPM in [**2175**] not on AC, DMII, CAD s/p CABG and recent NSTEMI, sCHF with EF45-50% and orthostatic hypotension who presents with increased work of breathing per the wife.
The patient was treated with a nitro gtt as well as daily diuresis with IV Furosemide (had not been on diuretics prior) which quickly weaned him from the need for BiPap.
The patient was also briefly on HCAP antibiotics, but upon [**Year (4 digits) **] from the ICU was felt to no longer need these medications given a presumed cardiogenic etiology.
Antihypertensive medications were uptitrated and upon [**Year (4 digits) **], he was normotensive with SBP 120-130, appeared euvolemic, with no oxygen requirement.
# acute on chronic systolic CHF, EF 45-50% [**10-9**]: Please see above discussion regarding respiratory failure.
Multiple medications including Carvedilol and Lisinopril initially helped in the ICU, subsequently patient transitioned back onto home Carvedilol and TID captropril (plan to transition back to lisinopril) as well as amlodipine, for BP control.
- Lisinopril 10mg - Increased carvedilol to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] - Diuresed over 8L with IV lasix, transitioned to PO torsemide 40 mg daily.
Adjusted medications as above and normotensive on [**Name (NI) **].
# Altered Mental Status - pt self dc'ed lines overnight [**8-28**].
- Negative infectious workup to date, afebrile, no leukocytosis, negative legionella, sputum, urine cx, CXR shows stable pleural effusion, LLL lung collapse  # Acute kidney injury - developed [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr 1.4 (from baseline 1.0-1.1) in the setting of aggressive diuresis, remained stable and was 1.4 on [**Last Name (un) **].
# Atrial fibrillation with tachy brady syndrome, s/p PPM in [**2175**]: - Increased carvedilol 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **], continued Amiodarone 200 mg PO Daily  # CAD s/p CABG in [**2169**], with recent NSTEMI [**10-9**] - Cont ASA 81 mg Daily, Atrovastatin 80 mg Daily - Increase lisinopril to 10 mg Daily  # Peripheral [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] disease, Left first toe ampuation and chronic necrotic eschar on left 2nd toe without evidence of infection - Cont ASA 81 mg Daily, Atrovastatin 10 mg Daily - Follow-up with [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] surgery regarding possible amputation # Diabetes mellitus, type II with complications, including neuropathy and [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] disease:  Cont home sliding scale insulin # GERD:  Cont ranitidine # Presumed BPH:  Cont tamsulosin HS # Glaucoma:  cont lantanoprost 0.005% qHS & dorzolamide-timolol eye drops [**Hospital1 **] # PSYCH:  cont sertraline and mirtazapine # General Care - Continue multivitamin - cholecalciferol 800 mg Daily  TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES - Continue aggressive chest physical therapy - Collapse of left lower lobe of the lung is most likely caused by pleural effusion from exacerbation of congestive heart failure.
