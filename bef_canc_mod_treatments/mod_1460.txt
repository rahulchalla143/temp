# GIB: Patient has history of GIB and has refused EGD and colonscopy in the past.

GI felt initially that patient would need [**Last Name (un) **] versus SBFT/CT scan, but could be done as an outpatient in addition to better managing her Crohn's medications and mesalamine and prednisone were continued during admission.
Per GI recs, IV solumedrol was started, and patient went for tagged red cell scan to evaluate the right colon and small bowel which found ?rectal bleeding, not supported by flex sig findings.
Patient was discharged on oral prednisone to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
