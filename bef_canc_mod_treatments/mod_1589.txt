History of Present Illness: This 79-year-old gentleman has had a previous total abdominal colectomy here at this institution 5 years ago for C difficile colitis.
He has been fine in this period of time but has recently presented with a bowel obstruction for the first time about 5 days ago.
We treated him with conservative care and found that over the next 5 days he did not open up a known transition point on a CAT scan.
NG tube suction care did improve his abdominal distention.
With these findings, I proposed an exploratory laparotomy for adhesiolysis.
