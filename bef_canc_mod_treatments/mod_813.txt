Pt started on HD 3 weeks ago using Shiley catheter.

After the post-HD blood pressure cuff was inflated on her left arm, the patient started bleeding from the closed fistula site.
The bleeding stopped with application of pressure but then the new surgical graft on her RUE started to bleed.
She was empirically started on Vancomycin and Zosyn and infectious work-up begun.
There was no urine for Cx.
Has had multiple regimens of chemotherapy c/b GVHD - Chronic Graft vs Host Disease, mild (cutaneous, liver) - CKD Stage V: Unclear if secondary to chemotherapy, cyclosporin, or GVHD.
Had LUE AV fistula placed but found to have occluded left brachiocephalic vessel on fistalugram.
- Hyponatremia felt to be due to increased fluid intake - s/p Thyroidectomy for thyroid mass, pathology was benign - Herpes zoster c/b post-herpetic neuralgia s/p nerve block   Social History: Married with 2 children.

# ESRD: The patient is s/p fistula placement on [**6-3**] and had HD via a right sided HD catheter on [**6-4**].
However, the more extensive bleeding was from her old left extremity fistula which was recently reversed and prompted to bleed by the squeezing of the blood pressure cuff during hemodialysis.
The patient's electrolytes were serially monitored and she did not require unscheduled hemodialysis.
She was treated with tylenol, vancomycin, and zosyn.
CXR was unremarkable, blood cultures peripherally and from her HD catheter were negative at time of discharge, and urine culture was also negative.
The patient was afebrile for 48 hours prior to discharge and was discharged on a 14 day course of vancomycin IV for possible line infection.
This was most likely secondary to the extensive bleeding at dialysis and was responsive to a 1L fluid bolus.
