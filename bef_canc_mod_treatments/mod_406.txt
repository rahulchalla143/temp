Brief Hospital Course: 74 year old woman s/p R total knee replacement in [**1-17**] with R knee liner exchange and wash out on [**2164-12-3**], with intra-operative cultures growing Streptococcus virdians on ceftriaxone who presented to the MICU with fever and hypotension.
Pt was admitted to the MICU out of concern for sepsis, however pressors were not required.
Highest on differential included evolving sepsis due to combination of fever, elevated WBC to 13, tachycardia, tachypnea (meeting criteria for SIRS) plus suspected source of infection as PNA.
The patient was started on Vancomycin and Cefepime for HCAP, and levaquin for double coverage of pseudomonas.
All of her Cxs returned negative (Blood, Urine, Sputum, catheter tip of PICC).
Levofloxacin was stopped after a 5 day course, and Vanc/Cefepime for 7 days as noted above.
The patient was prescribed Levoflox 750 mg PO daily x 3 months for continued suppressive therapy of strep viridans septic arthritis.
Lisinopril that pt is on as outpt was stopped as pt remained normotensive.
Also on ddx is malignancy and rheumatologic process, however given improvement with [**Last Name (LF) 621**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] defer further w/u for now and can be reassessed as outpt if remaining concern.
# Tachypnea: Pt was tachypneic upon transfer to MICU, which largely resolved after some ativan for anxiety.
Out of concern that she was a little volume up, she was diuresed with lasix x 1 which helped her symptomatically.
She was also continued on nebulizer treatments for her underlying obstructive lung disease.
# History of Mycobacterium avium intracellularae - treated for MAC from [**2-/2157**] to 06/[**2158**].
Vaginal bleeding/hematuria: Pt is s/p TAH-BSO, and without pelvic pain.
Per pt, recently saw GYN at [**Hospital1 112**] and usually uses vagifem and evista at home, which was recently stopped.
We were unable to prescribe these medications as they are nonformulary, and the pt declined pursuing this issue further.
# H/o Right total knee replacement [**2164-1-24**], c/b infx 2 months ago.
She still requires long term [**Month/Day/Year 621**] for the previous septic arthritis and was discharged on 3 months of Levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily.
# Anemia: long standing issue and pt is on iron supplementation at home.
Iron labs were again sent during this hospitalization and were c/w Fe-deficiency anemia.
iron supplementation was started in house and she was discharged back on her home regimen.
