He was treated empirically initially with vanc and zosyn, the vancomycin was changed to daptomycin for VRE given hx of VRE in peritoneal fluid in [**2119**] and chronic thrombocytopenia (so avoid linezolid).
He did receive albumin for SBP despite already having HRS and being on HD.
He was started on midodrine but was unable to take this secondary to his ileus, which was causing him not to absorb PO medications.
# Ileus: the patient developed a severe ileus, which was thought to be [**1-22**] his peritonitis and his ascites.
An NGT was placed with relief of nausea and vomiting, and he was discharged with this tube to hospice for intermittent suctioning.
In the setting of acute hematocrit drop, concern for bleed; no signs of acute bleeding despite history of varices.
Continued lactulose and rifaximin.
On prophylactic bactrim for SBP, which was held during his treatment of SBP.
He did receive a therapeutic paracentesis with removal of 10L of fluid on [**2122-1-28**].
After that point, although he was in pain with his distension, the patient could not have another paracentesis as his hypotension was preventative.
# End stage renal disease - Hemodialysis for hepatorenal syndrome in setting of cirrhosis.
Sevelamer and calcium acetate were continued.
#IDDM - continue home lantus and sliding scale.
This has been one of the patient's most significant sources of discomfort and embarassment for several years however he has been told that he is not a candidate for surgical repair until after he has a liver transplant.
Continue Levothyroxine at home dose.
