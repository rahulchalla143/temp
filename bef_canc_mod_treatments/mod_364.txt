Admission Date:  [**2165-9-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2165-9-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2092-8-17**]     Sex:  M   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old man with history of coronary artery disease including two prior coronary artery bypass grafts, myocardial infarction in [**2139**] and a lung nodule who had presented for catheterization pre-operative work-up for lung mass resection.
In the catheterization all the grafts were occluded except for the saphenous vein graft to his right posterolateral artery, however, when attempt was made to open the saphenous vein graft to the LAD, perforation occurred in the left anterior descending artery just distal to the saphenous vein graft.
Echocardiogram was done The patient was brought up to the CCU for monitoring and management of his hemodynamics.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease with two prior coronary artery bypass grafts in [**2145**] and a saphenous vein graft to his left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to his posterior descending artery.
In [**2152**] a left internal mammary artery to his diagonal and saphenous vein graft to his left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to his left circumflex.
He had a catheterization in [**2160**] which revealed a patent saphenous vein graft to his left anterior descending and a saphenous vein graft to his posterior descending artery.
MEDICATIONS:  On presentation, Aspirin 325 mg po q d, Colestid 2 gm [**Hospital1 **], Lopressor 25 mg po bid, Captopril 6.25 mg po q d, Darvocet 1 gm q 4 hours prn.
LABORATORY DATA:  Upon admission his white blood count was 9.9, hematocrit 32.9 with baseline of 40, platelet count 233,000, Chem 7 136, 3.3, 104, 18, 18, 1.1 with baseline of 1.0 creatinine and 230.
No left bundle branch block had been noted on previous EKGs.
Code was called and his pressure was stabilized on pressors and finally on Epinephrine.
Second concern was that of hemodynamic status and a Swan Ganz catheter was passed from his left femoral sheath which revealed a central venous pressure of 6, right ventricular pressure of 31/5 and a wedge pressure of 11 consistent with mild hypovolemia.
His pressures again had increased with Dopamine and Epinephrine.
He was sedated and intubated and an abdominal CT scan was done because of the concern of enlarging bilateral groin hematomas.
He received two units of packed red blood cells.
The next day he was able to be weaned off the Dopamine after one 250 cc normal saline bolus, after having received two units of packed red blood cells.
He converted to sinus rhythm and remained in sinus rhythm for the rest of his hospital course and was extubated after a successful trial of pressure supports.
Again, the next morning on [**9-13**] he had no further complications, was transferred to the floor on [**9-14**], was evaluated by physical therapy and then again on [**9-15**] physical therapy cleared him for discharge with cardiac rehab follow-up.
He was able to be restarted on regimen of 25 mg po bid of Lopressor and 6.25 mg po tid of Captopril.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 25 mg po bid, Captopril 6.25 mg po tid, Aspirin 325 mg po q d, Questran 4 gm po bid and Darvocet prn.
He should also follow-up in cardiac rehab and our plan would be to increase his Captopril dose to 12.5 mg po bid and possibly 25 mg po bid if his blood pressure tolerates it.
