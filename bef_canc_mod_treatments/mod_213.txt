She was initially broadly covered with vancomycin and cefepime, the vancomycin was discontinued when her blood cultures grew out GNR's.
On the general medical floor her antibiotics were narrowed to ceftriaxone for a planned 2 week course from first negative culture.
Pressures remained stable and patient was discharged home with IV antibiotic therapy to complete a 14 day course of ceftriaxone (Cipro was deferred given the Flecainide cross reactivity and possible gut edema from her CHF).
