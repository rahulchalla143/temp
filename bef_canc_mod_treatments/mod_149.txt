Admission Date:  [**2167-5-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2167-6-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2095-6-11**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old man with catheterization in [**2161**] showing a normal left main, left anterior descending, 60% proximal in mid, diagonal 70%, diagonal II 70%, intermediate 80%, left circumflex 80%, proximal 70-80%, OM1 70%, right coronary artery 95%, LVEDP 16, RVEDP 10, pulmonary hypertension, CF 39%, and a hypokinetic anterior lateral septal, apical, and posterior walls.
The patient is also status post coronary artery bypass grafting times four and a catheterization in [**2163**] with left main 20%, left anterior descending 40%, proximal diagonal 80%, left circumflex total ramus 80%, patent grafts, and a PAECW of 18, pulmonary hypertension, and global hypokinesis, with a 23% ejection fraction, and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
The treadmill test was stopped, and the patient was given sublingual Nitroglycerin times two with relief of pain.
In [**2161**] after coronary artery bypass grafting, the patient suffered from an myocardial infarction and felt similar symptoms as he experienced on the day of admission and also before an admission in [**2167-2-15**] secondary to congestive heart failure.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denied headache, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, palpitations, cough, abdominal pain, and indigestion.
Coronary artery bypass grafting times four with catheterization as listed above.
MORPHINE ALSO CAUSE THE PATIENT TO "GO CRAZY."
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Zaroxolyn 5 mg twice a week Monday and Friday, Verapamil 50 a.m., 60 noon, 40 h.s., Vasotec 5 b.i.d., Coumadin 5 q.o.d., 2.5 q.o.d., Imdur 30 q.d., Lipitor 10 q.d., Lasix 40 q.d., Serevent 2 puffs b.i.d., Flovent 2 puffs b.i.d., Proventil p.r.n., Xanax 0.25 p.r.n., Centrum q.d.
He was placed on telemetry and oxygen.
Heparin was started.
Coumadin was held.
Coronary angiography of the native vessels revealed a right dominant system with three-vessel disease.
Graft angiography showed a patent LIMA left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft posterior descending artery graft.
Rheolytic thrombectomy and stenting of the saphenous vein graft jump segment from R1 to OM was performed with no residual stenosis and improvement in the long laminar flow.
Final diagnosis was native three-vessel coronary artery disease, patent LIMA LAD and SVG PDA1 graft, nonlaminar flow in jump segment of SVG ramus OM1 with 60% lesion after first anastomosis.
This was suspicious for thrombus, moderate size ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and successful rheolytic thrombectomy, and PTCA stenting of the SVG jump segment from R1 to OM1.
After catheterization, the patient did well and was started on Heparin and Coumadin for atrial fibrillation with intention to titrate up Coumadin; however, the patient developed large hematomas and ecchymosis at the elbow, thigh, and leg while on Heparin.
Heparin and Coumadin were discontinued.
Three units of packed red blood cells were transfused, and hematocrit was stabilized.
The patient also intermittently complained of light-headedness, and on [**5-29**], the patient was with an increased heart rate early in the morning which was treated with 5 mg of Diltiazem IV and reinstitution of Verapamil.
On [**5-30**], the patient was without any complaints until 1 p.m. that day when he was walking with Physical Therapy and experienced shortness of breath and a tachycardiac atrial fibrillation rhythm to 106 with maintenance of good blood pressure.
Diltiazem 10 mg was pushed, and the patient's t.i.d.
Heart rate still rebounded in the 110s to 120s, and an additional 40 mg of Verapamil was given.
A Diltiazem drip was then started at 5:45 p.m. along with a 10 mg push of Diltiazem at midnight secondary to inability to control rate.
On the following morning, the patient's heart rate was in the 70s to 80s, but he was still experiencing desaturation and tachypnea.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable and on a Diltiazem drip for rate control.
He was seen by IR for IVC filter placement, and the question of anticoagulation still remained.
The patient's Heparin had been discontinued on [**5-27**] due to his retroperitoneal bleed and had subsequent 3 U packed red blood cell transfusion.
The patient was transferred to the MICU for critical care evaluation and evaluation by Pulmonary.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient underwent placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] IVC filter.
He did well status post filter placement with a stable hematocrit.
Given the patient's low ejection fraction and improved hemodynamic status, he was started on an ACE inhibitor and then transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service for further management.
It was decided after discussion with the patient's attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], that the patient would not be anticoagulated at the time of discharge due to recent history of retroperitoneal bleed requiring 3 U transfusion and recent IVC filter placement and the patient's present status of being hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic.
ASSESSMENT:  This was a 71-year-old man with coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, status post saphenous vein graft stent on [**5-22**], retroperitoneal bleed on anticoagulation, pulmonary emboli with transfer to MICU, with rapid atrial fibrillation, with subsequent IVC filter placement, and transfer back to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**], now stable on p.o.
Cardiovascular:  Coronary artery disease is stable status post stent on [**5-22**], with no complaints of chest pain.
The patient is to continue on Aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor.
Diltiazem:  The patient is to follow-up for a possible EP study as an outpatient, and Coumadin is to be reinstituted or addressed on the days following discharge by his primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/or cardiologist.
Coumadin issues should be readdressed as an outpatient.
The patient is to continue Flovent and p.r.n.
Status post stent of saphenous vein graft.
Retroperitoneal bleed status post 3 U packed red blood cells transfusion.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Flovent 4 puffs b.i.d., Captopril 12.5 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Atrovent 2 puffs q.4 hours p.r.n., Diltiazem 30 mg p.o.
q.i.d., Plavix 75 mg p.o.
until [**6-20**], Protonix 40 mg p.o.
q.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
q.d., EC Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d., Xanax 0.25 mg p.o.
p.r.n., Colace 100 mg p.o.
FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with his primary care physician in one week to the next few days to consider restarting Coumadin secondary to deep venous thrombosis and retroperitoneal bleed.
Heart-healthy and low-sodium diet.
