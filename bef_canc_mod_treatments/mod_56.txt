Thin liquid, Nectar-thick liquid, pureed consistency barium, and one cookie coated with barium were administered.
Results follow:  ORAL PHASE: The oral phase was noted for overall mild deficits with regards to decreased bolus control and formation, prolonged mastication, decreased ap tongue movement with pumping behavior, mildly prolonged oral transit with solids & liquids, and mild oral residue remaining on the tongue.
There was also intermittent trace premature spillover of thin liquids to the laryngeal vestibule with thin liquids.
Hyolaryngeal excursion, laryngeal valve closure were both mildly reduced, though epiglottic deflection was generally incomplete/absence which resulted in a moderate amount of vallecular residue (solids/purees were greater than liquids).
Bolus propulsion was mildly weakened with mild pyriform sinus residue noted, mainly with liquids.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Mild penetration occurred during the swallow with thin liquids due to decreased laryngeal valve closure and also at times premature spillover.
However, he still continues to present with a mild oropharyngeal dysphagia with the main issues being slowed mastication, the presence of pharyngeal residue and penetration with thin liquids.
As such, at this time, I would recommend that the pt begin a po diet consitency of ground consistency solids and thin liquids.
Therefore, at this time, I would recommend that po meds be administered crushed or in liquid form.
Lastly, discussed with MD that given recent lack of nutrition, team may wish to consider continuing NG tube feedings for ~24 hrs more, and then d/c tube.
PO meds crushed or in liquid form.
