Admission Date:  [**2160-10-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2160-11-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2114-10-13**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 46-year-old male with a complicated cardiac history including coronary artery disease status post CABG x2 ([**2139**], [**2152**]), pericardial constriction status post stripping, diastolic dysfunction, stable angina (patient no longer an operative candidate per Cardiothoracic Surgery).
While on the floor, diuresis was attempted with Lasix and nesiritide, but patient's heart failure was refractory to treatment, in addition he had worsening renal failure and became hypotensive.
Coronary artery disease status post CABG '[**39**] with SVG to LAD and D1 and CABG in '[**52**] with SVG to RCA, and pericardial stripping secondary to constrictive pericarditis.
Small [**Last Name (LF) 8714**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]-2 subtotally occluded status post PTCA with no stent, SVG to RCA patent, and SVG to LAD/D1 totally occluded proximally.
Patient with collateral perfusion of LAD territory.
Lasix 160 q.a.m., 80 q.p.m.
Tegretol 300 t.i.d.
Zestril 10 q.d.
Lopressor 100 b.i.d.
Aspirin 325.
Protonix 40 q.d.
Lantus 20 q.a.m., 18 units q.p.m.
Fluvoxamine 12.5 b.i.d.
Lipitor 10 q.d.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin results in hives.
Echocardiogram:  [**10-28**] EF 60%, E/A ratio 1.57, no evidence of effusion or constriction, trivial MR.  HOSPITAL COURSE: 1.
CHF:  Patient was transferred to the CCU and had a PA catheter placed without complication.
He was started on nesiritide drip, which he initially tolerated well.
Dopamine was added to increase renal perfusion and enhance diuresis, however, patient became tachycardic and experienced anginal symptoms which resolved upon discontinuing dopamine.
Patient's blood pressure remained stable and given that his heart failure was secondary to diastolic dysfunction, his beta blocker was titrated back on board and increased as tolerated, as it was felt that slowing his heart rate, increasing his filling time would improve his cardiac function.
Additionally, Lasix drip was added for further diuresis.
Coronary artery disease:  Patient remained chest pain free throughout stay except for episode of chest pain associated with dopamine drip.
He is known to have native LAD and SVG to LAD occlusion with perfusion via collaterals.
He is not an operative candidate for CT surgery given substantial mortality associated with third redo CABG, and patient with longstanding diabetes.
Tegretol was felt to be an unlikely etiology as this patient had been on this medication for many years with no prior history of hyponatremia.
Anemia:  Patient required several transfusions while in-house.
Diabetes mellitus:  Patient was initially maintained on his home insulin regimen, however, his p.m. lantus had to be decreased while in-house secondary to low fingersticks in the a.m.                              [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.
