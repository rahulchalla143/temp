Admission Date:  [**2133-9-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-9-10**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**] Chief Complaint: sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]F with h/o lymphoma, GERD, HTN, dCHF presented on [**8-28**] to [**Hospital3 628**] with shortness of breath and dxd with PNA.
Was previously dxd with PNA and placed on Levo but failed.
Placed on Vanco/Cefepime there.
This caused ARF on CKD and anuria, presumably from ATN, now placed on HD through femoral HD line.
Course also complicated by delirium and malnutrition requiring NGT and tube feeds (haldol and restraints in this setting).
Also with thrombocytopenia to low of 37 over last 3 days, concern for HIT so stopped heparin and checked HIT ab (pending).
Today HD line clotted and is no longer working.
She is now DNR/DNI and no pressors, but wishes to continue aggressive medical care otherwise.
Thus, they request transfer for replacement of HD cath and continued HD, as well as continued treatment of HCAP, delirium, and malnutrition, and also work up of thrombocytopenia.
-GERD -HTN -dCHF -Lung mass, possibly cancer, family denied any further workup or treatment since [**2129**].
TIP OF THE PICC LINE AT THE LEVEL OF THE SVC.
She received also another transfusion of blood packed red blood cells on [**9-6**].
Her microbiology preliminary catheter tip grew out [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.
It was from femoral line which was pulled and replaced with a PICC line.
We will start her on fluconazole for that as well.
The patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] to replace HD line and continue dialysis.
However, her pressure continued to drop and the decision was made to make her comfort measures only.
They do not desire any further drastic measures such as CPR, intubation, or pressors, but are ok with the patient getting dialysis including CVVH and other medical interventions to aggressivly treat her PNA and renal failure.
However, her pressures continued to trend down and it became clear that she would no tolerate or benefit fom CVVH or other invasive care, so the patient was made comfort measures only and passed soon thereafter.
# Healthcare associated Pneumonia: Course so far had been complicated by resp failure requiring BIPAP and hypotension requiring pressors.
Treated emperically with Vanc, Cefepime.
The patient's family initially desired dialysis or CVVH, and the patient was tansfered to the ICU with the intention of getting CVVH, but was unable to maintain her pressure and was made comfort measures only.
NG tube in place.
# Thrombocytopenia: Plts 37 on admission, trended down during prior admission.
Heparin SQ DVT PPx was DCed for concern of HITT.
