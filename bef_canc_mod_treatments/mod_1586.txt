HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year old man whose past medical history includes renal cell cancer, status post partial right nephrectomy, prostate cancer, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin, hypertension, Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus sputum, and Clostridium difficile colitis, status post ileostomy.
He started an ace inhibitor at about this time.
His potassium was subsequently checked and found to be 10.1.
The patient was then given two grams of Calcium Gluconate, intravenous insulin, amp of D50 and normal saline with two ampules of bicarbonate.
A dialysis line was then placed in the right femoral artery, and the patient was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
At the time of admission, the patient noted that he had recently been started on an ace inhibitor approximately at the time of his discharge from [**Hospital6 3953**].
In addition, the patient noted that he had chronically elevated potassium in the past, and that he has required bicarbonate, that he has been on Sodium Bicarbonate and Kayexalate.
At the time of his presentation, the patient admitted some left groin/left hip pain, which he thought to be musculoskeletal in origin.
The patient denied other complaints including fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation.
The patient denies urinary symptoms, including dysuria, pyuria, hematuria.
Renal cell carcinoma, status post partial nephrectomy ([**12-22**]).
Prostate cancer, status post radiation therapy.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Neurontin 300 mg p.o.
Lantus 56 units subcutaneous q.h.s.
Prevacid 30 mg p.o.
Lisinopril 5 mg p.o.
Reglan 10 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o.
Paxil 20 mg p.o.
Zocor 20 mg p.o.
Ambien 10 mg p.o.
Imodium 2 mg p.o.
ALLERGIES:  Adverse reactions - This patient states that he is allergic to Penicillin and Cephalosporins.
In addition, the patient appears to develop hyperkalemia on ace inhibitors and ARBS.
The patient complains of discharge and pruritus of the eyes bilaterally,  and he notes that he has recently been started on topical Erythromycin for presumed conjunctivitis.
Abdomen - positive bowel sounds, colostomy in right lower quadrant, bag intact with moderate volume brown stool.
Total protein 7.8, albumin 3.9, globulin 3.9, calcium 9.8, phosphate 3.1, magnesium 2.5.
There are multiple radiation seeds overlying the prostate as well as surgical sutures and a right lower quadrant ostomy.
A renal consultation was then called, and a double lumen Quinton catheter was then placed in the patient's right groin in anticipation of hemodialysis to dialyze off the patient's elevated potassium.
The patient was then admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and subsequently underwent hemodialysis on [**2167-5-12**].
With the patient's potassium stable, the patient's Quinton catheter was removed on [**2167-5-13**].
The etiology of the patient's hyperkalemia was felt to be multifactorial, including a combination of baseline elevated potassium, noncompliance with outpatient Kayexalate, diet at home, and medication induced with recent prescription of ace inhibitors at the outside hospital.
In addition, it was noted that the patient may have been on Heparin while at the outside hospital, and that Heparin has been known to have a direct toxic effect on the adrenal zonaglomerulosa cells.
At the time of his transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2167-5-14**], the patient's renal medications included Furosemide 20 mg p.o.
once daily, Fludrocortisone Acetate 0.1 mg p.o.
once daily, and Sodium Bicarbonate 1300 mg p.o.
In order to reduce the patient's potassium to a desire range of between 4.0 and 4.5, the patient's dose of Fludrocortisone was increased from 0.1 mg p.o.
At discharge, the patient was continued on his Fludrocortisone at a dose of 0.1 mg p.o.
During the time of his admission, the patient was maintained on a regimen of Glargine 54 units q.h.s.
While the patient was continued on his Fludrocortisone at admission, he was scheduled to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of nephrology in the [**Hospital 2793**] Clinic as an outpatient.
As mentioned above, given the patient's presumed type IV RTA and hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, the patient was continued on his Fludrocortisone, initially at 0.1 mg p.o.
In addition, as has been noted in prior discharge summaries, it was again emphasized that the patient should avoid treatment with ace inhibitors and ARBS.
The patient was continued on his Aspirin, Lopressor and statin.
Infectious disease - Conjunctivitis - The patient was continued on his Erythromycin strips for bilateral conjunctivitis.
While the patient continued to complain of some right groin pain, this pain was treated to good effect with heat packs and Acetaminophen.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction.
Glargine insulin 54 units q.h.s.

Fludrocortisone 0.1 mg p.o.
Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
