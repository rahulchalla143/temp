History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69-year-old gentleman now almost 3 months after [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy complicated by leak.
He has required 1 prior re-operation for anastomotic dehiscence.
CT scan suggested undrained collection up near the anastomosis, with moth-eaten bone in the posterior ribs.
As the tube was not providing definitive drainage, I recommended creation of a posterior [**Last Name (un) 72968**] window, and the patient agreed to proceed.
Invasive CA of GE junction, Barrett's esoph s/p remote fundoplication (20 yrs ago @[**Hospital1 **]) 2.
On [**11-4**] empyema tube fell out and was replaced.
On [**2110-11-7**] pt went to the operating room for bronchoscopy, flexible esophagoscopy, and right posterior thoracotomy with creation of [**Last Name (un) 72148**] window and primary suture repair of esophagogastric leak.
On [**2110-12-24**] pt underwent a tracheostomy, bronchoscopy with aspiration of secretions and esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
During his hospital course the pt was placed on multiple antibiotic regimens due to spiking fevers, diarrhea, and multiple positive cultures from blood, wounds, sputum and drainage.
He remained ventilator dependant and was eventually fitted with a tracheostomy tube for comfort.
The pt received tube feeds through a jejunostomy feeding tube.
Calcitonin was ultimately given with good effect in decreasing free calcium levels although the etiology of the hypercalcaemia was never discovered.
On [**2111-1-7**] during a family meeting, in light of respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and decreasing cardiac function, it was decided to withdraw vasopressor support and make the pt comfort measures only.
