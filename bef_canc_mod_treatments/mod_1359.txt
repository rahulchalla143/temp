He is concerned that he is aspirating again since he had similar symptoms prior to his zenker's diverticulum repair in [**2116**].
He was previously on lasix 20mg daily but his hematologist had him stop taking it two weeks ago because he appeared to be dry per their note.
While in the ED he desaturated to 70% on RA and he was placed on a 100% non-rebreather.
Given his history of aspiration he was treated with IV Zosyn.
He was also given 20mg IV lasix and put out 700cc's urine.

Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation,  DISCHARGE PE: VS - T 97.6 BP 161/52 HR 72 RR 20 SO2 96%/2L GENERAL - well-appearing man in NAD, comfortable, appropriate HEENT - NC/AT, PER, sclerae anicteric, poor dentition LUNGS - Inspiratory crackles in right base, good air movement, resp unlabored, no accessory muscle use HEART - Distant heart tones.
Dilated right ventricle with borderline-normal systolic function and evidence of pressure overload.
On arrival to the MICU, amp/sulbactam and azithromycin were started to cover atypicals and anaerobes as pt has significant aspiration risk with Zenker's diverticulum.
He had been off of his lasix for 4weeks and he appeared slightly volume up on exam and chest x-ray showed vascular congestion.
He received 20 mg IV lasix and put out 1 L overnight in the MICU.
On the medical floor, he was placed on 4L NC initially and weaned on [**8-12**] to 2L.
His anitbiotics were switched to PO augmentin and PO azithromycin and he was given 20 mg PO lasix for his SOB.
The medical team touched base with his PCP who agreed to keep pt on Lasix 20mg PO daily.
In regards to oxygen supplementation, pt desaturated to mid 80s on room air when weaning attempted on day of discharge and was then placed back on 2L NC where he continued to saturate in the mid to high 90s.
Pt is to continue augmentin for a 7 day course, and azithromycin 5 day course was completed on [**2119-8-14**].
He was transfused 1u of RBCs on [**8-12**] for hct of 20.7 and was also started on home dose Lasix to prevent fluid overload.
After speaking to pt's outpt hematologist, pt's baseline hct falls between 20-22.
Hypoxia was another possibility as pt has pulmonary hypertension seen on echocardiography with pneumonia, and thus pt required high amounts of O2 supplementation in the MICU.
Pt's pain in chin and L hand was controlled with acetaminophen 650 mg Q6h PRN.
Pt is to work on balance and lower extremity exercises at rehab facility.
Pain was manageable with PRN Tylenol and was no longer needed on day of discharge.
With pt living alone at home and legally blind, personal hygiene and medication compliance are issues.
Pt may have not been adherent with medications and will need TSH followed up on in near future.
#) Zencker's Diverticulum: He complains of episodes of N/V and chronic cough, which initially improved following surgical repair of diverticulum, but has now worsened; pt endorses having food particles regurgitation intermittently.
Aspiration was a concern and pt was seen by speech and swallow while in MICU; video study deferred as pt's bedside swallowing trials were acceptable.
We recommended outpatient psychiatry appointment (pt has specific preferences on who not to see) for psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy if needed.
