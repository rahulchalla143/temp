Admission Date:  [**2177-10-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-11-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2100-8-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7299**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right PICC insertion [**2177-11-7**] IR guided drainage of large abdominal hematoma [**2177-10-29**] Angiography of the celiac artery, SMA, GDA, and abdominal aorta [**2177-10-28**] Left Internal Jugular central Line insertion [**2177-10-28**] Arterial Line Placement [**2177-10-28**]   History of Present Illness: This is a 77 year old male with PMH of multiple myeloma s/p 11 months of chemotherapy through [**7-/2177**], RCC s/p left nephrectomy, CKI newly started on HD M/W/F as of 2 weeks ago, DM2 c/b gastroparesis/peripheral neuropathy, HTN, and CAD being transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] with altered mental status, Afib with RVR, hypotension requiring neosynephrine drip, and for IR embolization for what was thought to be a large fluid collection in his abdomen representing an actively extravasating hemorrhagic right renal cyst.
His current medical issues all seemed to start with several falls starting about a month ago when one of his outpatient doctors started [**Name5 (PTitle) **] on a new diuretic regimen which made him lose 40lbs in 2 weeks and threw off all of his electroyltes.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] following transfusion of 3 units of pRBCs, dialysis, and treatment with Epogen.
He was also noted to be in Afib with RVR to the 120s-130s and a diltiazem drip was started.
A neosynephrine drip was also started for hypotension and he was given 3L of NS.
He was then sent in an ambulance to [**Hospital1 18**] on a neo drip and dropped his SBP to the 80s transiently which responded to 110s systolic after a 1L NS bolus.
He was noted to be in Afib with RVR in the 120s despite a diltiazem drip started at OSH when he arrived with a SBP in the 110s on a low dose of neosynephrine drip.
He was also noted on CXR to have a RLL infiltrate concerning for PNA and was given a dose of vancomycin and ceftriaxone in the ED.
The diltiazem drip was also stopped and his HR remained in the 120s.
The ED also tried to shut off the neosynephrine drip, but his SBPs fell to the 90s and it was turned back on prior to going to IR for his procedure.
He also got 2 units of pRBCs for a hematocrit of 26.6 with an unknown baseline.
A left IJ triple lumen was also placed for access in the ED and blood cultures were sent.
The patient's main complaint was back pain which he has chronically and was exacerbated from laying still after his IR procedure.

Massive complex cystic lesion in the right hemiabdomen with internal hyperdensity suggestive of hemorrhagic components, with limited assessment of internal enhancement.
This lesion appears separate from the right kidney and liver, and while closely associated with the pancreatic head, appears to remain separate as well from the pancreas.
Status post left nephrectomy without evidence of local disease recurrence.
U/S guided drain placement of hematoma [**2177-10-29**] 9:51 AM IMPRESSION: Technically successful aspiration and drainage (8F Navare catheter) of right abdominal collection with imaging and gross findings representing a hematoma.
Specimen sent to microbiology for further analysis immediately following the procedure .
Interval decrease in size of right abdominal hematoma with drainage catheter in place.
Status post left nephrectomy with no evidence of local disease recurrence.
Dialysis catheter and PICC line remain in place.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old male with PMH of plasma cell dyscrasia s/p 11 months of Melphalan and Prednisone through [**7-/2177**] RCC s/p left nephrectomy, ESRD recently started on HD, DM and HTN who was admitted with hypotension, rapid AF and confusion for possible IR embolisation of what was thought to be a large intra-abd hematoma with concern for ongoing hemorrhage.
Pt had required blood transfusions prior to transfer and was hypotensive with a pressor requirement on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
BP improved after drainage and pt was able to weaned off pressor support in the following days.
Pt had considerable abdominal pain at the drain site which improved with IV dilaudid.
He will be followed by general surgery in their [**Hospital 2536**] clinic on [**11-25**].
His case was frequently discussed with IR and  drain continued to have approx 100cc of serosang drainage each day.
The patient had been diagnosed with pneumonia at his rehab hospital and was given one dose of vancomycin on [**10-22**] and continued on ceftriaxone and vancomycin for a 10 day course.
Pt had been started on HD 3 weeks prior to admission and presented with massive volume overload/anasarca that was complicated by his low albumin.
While in house, he underwent almost daily HD/UF for aggressive volume removal but this was limited by low BPs at HD.
This was managed with midodrine/albumin as needed.
Latterly his BP permitted significant fluid removal of 3-4L without the aid of albumin and his anasacra greatly improved as a result of this.
# Fast AF: This was noted on the outside hospital ECG, and required IV diltiazem and resolved.
He continued in sinus rhythm throughout the remainder of his hospital stay and he was monitored on telemetry.
He was therefore treated with a 1 week course of Erythromycin eye drops which stopped [**11-17**].
This resolved before his treatment course was completed.
# Plasma cell dyscrasia: Initially documented on admission to be myeloma but on further discussion with his outpt hematologist, it was felt that the exact nature of his plasma cell dyscrasia was not entirely understood.
Pt had been treated with Melphalan and Prednisone prior to admission which he did not tolerate well.
He was therefore treated with TPN for approx 2 wks and as his fluid collection decreased in size, his intake improved.
He was initially treated with TPN including insulin.
The gabapentin was decreased to 100mg qhs and neuropathic pain was controlled.

You were initially transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] with confusion and a low blood pressure requiring medications to support this in addition to an increasing collection of blood within the abdomen.
The outside hospital had taken a chest X-ray which showed pneumonia and you were treated with intravenous antibiotics for this completing a 10-day course.
You also briefly had a fast irregular hreat beat which was treated with medications to slow the heart and resolved with no futher episodes.
After this, you had a drain inserted by interventioanl radiology under ultrasound guidance to drain the hematoma.
Following initial drainage of this, your blood pressure was much easier to control as this was felt to have been compressing one of the major veins in the abdomen.
We had many discussions with interventioanl radiology and once your drain is drainig <10mL in 24 hours you will have your abdomen re-scanned and as necessary your drain removed or re-positioned.
Due to the blood collection, we held your aspirin and pain was controlled with appropriate pain-killers and improved during your admission.
Your drain was still draining on trasfer to rehab on [**11-20**].
You also required frequent dialysis due to having a lot of additional fluid in your body.
For this you received the medication midodrine and occasionally required fluids to support your blood pressure with albumin.
You did well on your dialysis and on transfer you will have a Monday/Wednesday/Friday dialysis regimen.
You initially required nutrition through the veins due to poor oral intake but latterly you no longer required this and were eating well.
Medication changes: We stopped aspirin due to your abdominal blood collection WE increased your levothyroxine to 137mcg daily Given your kidney function we reduced gabapentin to 100mg daily .
Patient instructions: Once you are draining <10ml/day you should be reassessed with a scan and seen by interventional radiology.
Your dialysis regimen will be Monday/Wednesday/Friday.
