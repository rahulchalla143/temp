He did not require intubation or ventilatory support.
Vanc/zosyn and levofloxacin given empirically.
Levofloxacin was discontinued after 2 days, when legionella antigen found to be negative.
A thoracentesis was performed: 1800cc clear, light yellow fluid removed, no empyema, transudate, culture negative.
He has had O2 saturations 97-100% on RA and did not require oxygen at any time.
He was started on lactulose without improvement and with worsening metabolic acidosis in the ICU; lactulose was stopped.
He did not have a paracentesis given the small amount of ascitis and the fact that he was treated with Zosyn.
However, he should have a paracentesis to rule out SBP the next time he is admitted with AMS.
He was treated with IVF D5 with resolution.
Has severe PVD, seen vascular in the past as well as wound consult.
Received clindamycin during last admit in late [**Month (only) 359**].
It is unclear if he truly had cellulitis vs venous status during this admission.

Given history of C.diff and recent clindamycin use, C.diff was considered although the patient only had diarrhea once with lactulose.
He had been on a course of ferrlecit infusions as an outpt.
# CHF, systolic dysfunction: Initially lasix and metoprolol were held in the setting of possible SIRS physiology.
His acidosis and bicarb resolved.

He was also started on Vit D 400units [**Hospital1 **].
