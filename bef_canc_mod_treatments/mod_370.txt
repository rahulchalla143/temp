The patient is a very poor historian but denies any fever, chills, sweats, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria or urgency.
He was given Lasix 40 mg intravenous in the Emergency Department with 1800 ccs of urine output and decreased FIO2 to 10 liters with oxygen saturation to 90%.
He was additionally given Solu-Medrol 125 mg intravenous and Levaquin in the Emergency Department.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he was continued on Solu-Medrol at 125 mg intravenous q6hours and was continued at that dose for the first 72 hours.
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he continued to receive Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q2hours.
He was also initially started on Levaquin for coverage of a possible pneumonia associated with his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as his chest x-ray showed increased interstitial infiltrate.
His respiratory status improved and he was gradually weaned off the 100% nonrebreather to face mask and then transferred to the Medicine floor on hospital day five.
While on the Medicine floor, he has continued to receive Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q4hours and his Solu-Medrol was switched to p.o.
The patient has a baseline oxygen requirement and while he was on the Medicine floor, his oxygen requirement was titrated to keep his oxygen saturation around the high 80s to low 90s.
On discharge, the patient was on five liters of nasal cannula oxygen with oxygen saturation in the low 90s.
He was continued on his Aspirin and Lipitor on admission.
He was initiated on Levophed to keep his blood pressure elevated.
His hypotension was thought to be secondary to sepsis and he was gradually weaned off Levophed and transferred to the Medicine floor when his blood pressure was stable off pressors for more than 48 hours.
On the Medicine floor, he did have one episode of transient hypotension to systolic of 60s to 70s that responded to intravenous fluid boluses of 500 ccs.
Infectious disease - The patient was initially started on Levofloxacin for coverage of pneumonia and received five days of the antibiotic.
This was presumed to be secondary to sepsis and he was pancultured and started on Vancomycin and Gentamicin in addition to the Levaquin for more broad spectrum coverage.
Blood cultures, four out of four bottles, cultured from his port-a-cath and peripherally, grew out Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Vancomycin sensitive Enterococcus.
The Levaquin was subsequently discontinued.
In addition, when the sensitivities returned, Gentamicin was also discontinued.
A PICC line was placed for intravenous antibiotic.
The patient will need to complete a fourteen day course of Vancomycin antibiotic for his bacteremia.
Access - The patient has a PICC line placed for intravenous antibiotic.
