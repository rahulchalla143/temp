Admission Date:  [**2190-7-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2190-7-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2141-5-30**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49 year old male with a history of schizophrenia, admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit with Lithium toxicity.
He was given Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone and four liters of normal saline.
He was intubated for airway protection, for which he was given two mg of Ativan intravenous times three and Vecuronium 5 mg intravenous times three.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for hemodialysis for Lithium toxicity.
MEDICATIONS:  Lithium 600 mg q. a.m., 300 mg at noon, 600 mg q. p.m.  Benztropine 2 mg p.o.
Haldol 10 mg at one a.m., 10 mg at one p.m.  Cogentin 2 mg at 8 a.m. and 2 mg at 8 p.m.
Chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe collapse, resolved on sequential chest x-rays following a bronchoscopy.
Lithium toxicity:  The patient transferred from an outside hospital for a Lithium level of 4.8 for emergent hemodialysis.
The patient was subsequently put on hemodialysis for six hours.
Lithium level following hemodialysis was 1.4 with a goal of Lithium less than 1.0.
On initial admission, the patient was aggressively rehydrated with intravenous fluids to enhance urinary excretion of Lithium.
Intravenous fluids were continued during his hospital course in order to match his output.
The patient's psychiatric medications were held initially to avoid the additive effects of Haldol on Lithium toxicity.
Haldol was restarted with a prn order for severe agitation; however, use of this medication was judicious to avoid further clouding of his mental status.
Methanol and Ethylene glycol were checked as possible sources of insult to the kidney.
During his hospital stay, the patient was maintained on aggressive hydration to keep his input and output equal.
This normalized following hemodialysis and was thought to be secondary to Lithium toxicity versus renal failure.
This level improved to potassium of 3.8 following hemodialysis and correction of his acidosis.
The patient's sodium improved following intravenous fluids.
The patient was changed to one-half normal saline with an amp of bicarbonate.
His acidosis improved following these interventions.
The patient was treated with Ativan for sedation and the added benefit of seizure prophylaxis overnight.
He was given Ceftriaxone and Zithromax.
The patient spiked a fever following his bronchoscopy.
He was dosed with Levo and Flagyl; however, in the morning, he remained afebrile without a white count, so further antibiotics were held.
He continues to be managed off of antibiotics and remains afebrile without a white count.
The patient was intubated at the outside hospital for airway protection.
He was managed with intravenous Hydralazine 30 mg q. six hours.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Subcutaneous heparin 5,000 units q.
Artificial tears, one to two drops ophthalmic prn as needed.
Famotidine 20 mg intravenous q.
Hydralazine 30 mg intravenous q. six hours.
Haldol 5 mg intravenous q. four hours prn for severe agitation.
