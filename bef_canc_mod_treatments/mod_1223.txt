Bilateral groin cutdowns.
The patient was consented for open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm with retroperitoneal approach.
After administration of both vancomycin and gentamicin IV and application of sequential compression stockings induction of general anesthesia was performed.
Bilateral groin incisions were performed in longitudinal fashion with simultaneous dissection performed at each groin initially utilizing electrocautery through the overlying soft tissues.
Both proximal and distal control was achieved utilizing encircling vessel loops at each branch vessel.
The tissues overlying the abdominal aortic aneurysm were carefully dissected away with visualization of both the infrarenal abdominal aorta and bifurcation and branch vessels.
Distal control was facilitated utilizing vessel loops at the left common iliac arteries.
Prior to heparinization iliac tunnels were created.
Heparin was then administered and re-dosed as necessary to keep ACTs>280.
A bifurcated Dacron 18x9 graft was then chosen and prepped.
Following this, a longitudinal arteriotomy was performed along the length of the aneurysm sac with removal of the intra-aneurysmal contents.
Urine output was slow to resume so IV Manitol was given.
The endarterectomized CIAs were closed with a double plegeted, technique.
The left common femoral, superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries were then crossclamped using atraumatic vascular clamps and an arteriotomy was performed at the left profunda femoris artery.
The right limb of the bifurcated graft was passed to the groin and flusched to check adequate flow.
The right common femoral, profunda femoris and superficial femoral arteries were crossclamped using atraumatic vascular clamps and a longitudinal arteriotomy was performed in the right common femoral artery down onto the proximal SFA.
Anastomosis was performed utilizing running 5-0 Prolene sutures in end-to-side fashion.
Endarterectomy of this area was performed with a clean endpoint.
An additional bovine pericardial patch was utilized for closure of the profunda femoris artery, effectively extending the patch 2.5cm onto the PFA.
The anastomosis was completed and after both antegrade and retrograde flushing of the vessels with subsequent removal of the replaced vascular clamps.
A #1 looped PDS was then utilized to close a second layer of external oblique and anterior rectus fascia.
The skin was then closed with staples as well.
The patient given significant volume resuscitation required during the open aortic procedure, remained intubated and was transferred stable and in good condition to the intensive care unit postoperatively.

TECHNIQUE: Evaluation of the femoral arteries in the left groin was performed with B-mode, color and spectral Doppler ultrasound.
FINDINGS: The distal end of the bypass graft is patent with monophasic Doppler waveforms and peak systolic velocities ranging between 57 and 76 cm/sec.
IMPRESSION: Patent distal bypass graft to the left lower extremity.
Patent left common femoral and profunda femoral arteries with monophasic Doppler waveforms.
The nasogastric tube and the right central venous access line have been removed in the interval.
