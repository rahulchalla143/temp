On [**8-9**], cardiothoracic surgery felt that the patient was ready for surgery and explained to the patient that the surgery would be high risk.
On [**8-10**], the patient was brought to the Operating Room and a mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve replacement was performed using a 31 mm St. Jude valve for the mitral valve and a 33 mm St. Jude valve for the tricuspid.
A pericardiectomy was also performed.
Anesthesia was general and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
The patient continued postoperatively to be intubated and on [**8-17**] had a right internal jugular vein cordis changed over wire to the triple lumen catheter.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with good blood return of all ports and the line tips of the previous line sent for cultures.
On [**8-25**], the patient returned to the Operating Room for tracheostomy and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.
The patient tolerated the procedures well and was returned back to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.
The patient continued to be intubated and on [**8-31**], was transferred to the Stepdown Unit on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6.
The patient at that point was then switched from Heparin to Coumadin and the PTT, PT/INR continued to be monitored.
On [**9-3**], the sputum cultures came back as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive and the patient was started on a course of Vancomycin 1 mg q.d.
Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was in place.
Incision for the chest tube and the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy were intact, clean and dry.

Bicitra 30 ml per percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy t.i.d.
Heparin drip titrated for a PTT between 60 and 80 until the INR is greater than 2.5 and then discontinue.
Heparin levels at discharge were 600 units/hr check PT/PTT q.d.

Tylenol 650 mg per percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy q.
6 hours prn  CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair but with tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive sputum.
Significant events or complications during the stay included prolonged intubation, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube and tracheostomy on [**8-25**], Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus sputum on [**9-3**] treated with Vancomycin.
Mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve replacement  SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Status post myocardial infarction 3.
Automatic implanted cardioverter defibrillator placement in [**2123-4-1**] 5.
