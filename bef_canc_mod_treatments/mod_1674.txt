Admission Date:  [**2114-11-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-11-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2047-3-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Rofecoxib  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath, renal failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 67 yo male with history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, s/p left ventricular septal myomectomy with MVR and AVR 2 years ago, CHF with baseline NYHA class II-III, PAF, heart block pacer dependent, HTN and obesity presents with 5 days of worsening dyspnea on exertion.
At that time he was started on metolazone in addition to his home lasix dose 80mg [**Hospital1 **].
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
A mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is present.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo male with history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, s/p two ETOH ablations, s/p left ventricular septal myomectomy with MVR and AVR 2 years ago, CHF with baseline NYHA class II-III, PAF, Mobitz II heart block, pacer dependent, HTN and obesity admitted for over-diuresis and renal failure, improved with gentle fluid repletion.
# Heart failure: The patient has a history of HOCM s/p myomectomy, AI s/p AVR and MR s/p MVR, paced.
The patient does not report a history of dietary indiscretion, however seems like prior to initiation of metolazone therapy he was having worsening heart failure symptoms.
He had been started on metolazone prior to this hospitalization which may have contributed to his euvolemic-dry state.
His lasix, lisinopril and metolazone were held given his renal failure but lasix and lisinopril were restarted on discharge.
His home doses of ASA, statin and metoprolol were continued while in-patient.
His amiodarone was continued for management of his afib and warfarin was temporarily held given supratherapeutic INR, restarted when INR was in the therapeutic range.
# ARF: His ARF was likely secondary to over diuresis with metolazone and lasix.
Renal function improved with gentle fluids and discontinuation of diuretics while in the hospital.
Lasix was re-started on discharge, however metolazone was not restarted.
Pt will require lab f/u to monitor for improvement of his renal function, may also require titration of diuretic meds to manage HF while preventing recurrent ARF.
# Gout: Home colchicine was temporarily held given renal failure but restarted on discharge.
