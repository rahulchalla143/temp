Found to have e.coli bacteremia originally treated with Levaquin, although strain was resistant and this was switched to CTX 1g QD on [**8-11**]; later increased to CTX 2g qD on [**8-13**].
He was given IVF x1L NS and had an NG lavage performed that was negative.
He was admitted to the MICU for monitoring  Of note, he had been started on a heparin gtt 2 days prior due to an upper extremity DVT; however, his heparin gtt had been turned off for the 24 hours prior due to a ?
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma- s/p Whipple [**9-28**] and chemo/XRT 2.
Recurred in [**5-31**]- Abscess composed of E. coli, Morganella morganii, and enterococcus-Rx w/ IR drainage, and 5 weeks of cefipime, vancomycin, Fungizone - treatment halted due to ARF 3.
Ascites-3L removed ([**5-/2149**]) 13.
Pertinent Results: MICRO: - Urine Cx from OSH grew klebsiella pneumoniae, sensitive to ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.
- Bcx [**8-10**] E. coli - Ucx [**8-9**] and [**8-11**]: negative - Bcx [**8-11**]: E. coli - Bcx [**8-12**]: 2/4 bottles E.coli, Klebsiella - Bcx [**8-13**] negative - Bcx [**8-15**]: E. coli, Klebsiella - Bcx [**8-17**]: E.coli, enterococcus - Abscess [**8-15**]: E. coli, strep viridans, [**Female First Name (un) **] [**Female First Name (un) 17939**], GPR - Abscess [**8-19**]: E. coli, enterococcus, bacteroides - peritoneal fluid ([**8-27**]): [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17939**]  IMAGING: -([**8-9**])Port AP CXR: Opacity at the right base which likely represents a combination of atelectasis and pleural fluid, view.
Catheter placement unable to be performed due to NPO status.
This raises the concern for peritonitis and a cytological tap is recommended to further evaluate.
Brief Hospital Course: In brief, Mr. [**Known lastname 52006**] presented to a [**Hospital6 **] with what was thought to be an acute hct drop to 25 and e. coli bacteremia and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for treatment and further workup.
He was initially treated with levaquin, then ceftriaxone when sensitivities returned quinolone-resistant.
He received a CT guided drainage of one liver abscess and drain placement on [**8-15**] -> growing klebsiella resistant to cetriaxone, enterococcus and yeast.
He also received a paracentesis and peritoneal fluid grew out [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17939**] and fluid analysis showed elevated WBCs c/w SBP.
Meropenem and vanco were started on [**8-17**] due to ceftriaxone and methacillin resistance profiles.
Attempted to replace percutaneous drains on [**8-27**] after drainage slowed but abscesses were not amenable to drainage by IR.
He was sent to the ICU and was stabilized with PRBCs and aggressive IVF rehydration.
Tube feeds were started with minimal increase in albumin to 1.3 after 1 week.
He continued to maintain marginal urine output despite fluid repletion and blood transfusions.
He received 1 paracentesis for fluid culture and at the time had 6 L of peritoneal fluid removed which reaccumulated rapidly.
At discharge patient's mental status had improved, he was tolerating tube feeds well, urine output was stable, he had been afebrile for 2 weeks, hematocrit had been stable, and he denied colonoscopy as an inpatient.
He received a PICC placement by IR, was given 2 units of blood to increase his hematocrit prophylactically, and he was discharged to an acute rehab facility for prolonged IV antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks with close monitoring by infectious disease.
