Pneumonia/sepsis:  The patient had one positive blood    culture with strep pneumonia treated with Ceftriaxone four    a two week course, which was discontinued on [**2151-4-29**].
Question of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The    patient has not had formal pulmonary function tests    performed, but she likely does have a diagnosis of chronic    obstructive pulmonary disease given that she had    difficulty weaning from the lead ventilator with auto PEEP    and increased peak inspiratory pressures that improved    with steroids and nebulizes.
The patient should also continue    with frequent nebulizer treatments standing q four hours    of Albuterol and Atrovent and likely before discharge may    want to be transitioned to inhalers.
Continue with    the Lisinopril and Atenolol q day.
When the patient tapers off her steroid taper    she should have her Haldol standing doses tapered as well.
She will not likely need continued doses of Haldol and    this should be tapered as soon as her steroids are    finished in order to prevent QT prolongation.
As the standing Haldol was titrated    off the patient should likely have her outpatient    psychiatric medications started back as an outpatient.
