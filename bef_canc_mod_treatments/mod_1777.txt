A PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava, as before, inserted via right-sided approach.
Tracheostomy tube is unchanged.
PT was recently treated for MDR klebsiella VAP with cefepime until [**6-2**] and vancomycin until [**2168-5-30**].
Pt's sputum culture grew Pseudomonas and received 8 days of meropenem for presumed HCAP.
Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs were also given during course along with Lasix diuresis.
Pt's respiratory status improved throughout sstay and tolerated 2 hour periods off of the ventilator by the end of course.
Electrolytes and weights should be monitored and lasix dose should be adjusted.
Of note, on the day of discharge it was noted that his sputum culture had grown Pseudomonas so [**Hospital 100**] Rehab was called and the physician taking care of him there was personally advised to continue Meropenem for a total of two weeks (with a planned stop date of [**2168-6-30**]) in an effort to completely and optimally treat this Pseudomonas.
Finally, there were multiple family meetings with the patient's wife and the patient - he is aware that he is chronically critically ill and that his likelihood of completely coming off the ventilator is guarded at best; he (and his wife) elect to continue pursuing rehab at this time, although the idea of hospice was introduced during this hospitalization - neither he nor his wife is ready to consider complete transition to palliative care at this time.
# C-diff by report: Pt was found to be C. diff toxin positive at previous hospitalization at OSH, and was continued on Flagyl at [**Hospital1 18**] with flexiseal in place.
[**2168-7-5**] was the projected date to stop Flagyl (2 weeks after completion of meropenem).
Coumadin restarted once INR was below <2.
Pt was rate controlled with Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg PO TID.
His INR was difficult to control likely due to antibiotic therapy and decreased hepatic clearance.
His warfarin was decreased to 2.5 and eventually held for multiple doses given a supratheraputic INR.
Today INR was 2.8 and warfarin can be restated at 2.5mg.
INR should be rechecked on [**2168-6-25**] and warfarin dose can be adjusted at that time.
# Polymyalgia rheumatica: Was previously treated with prednisone 15mg PO daily, but was never given PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
Bactrim PCP prophylaxis was given.
# Type II DM: Pt was on MetFORMIN (Glucophage) 1000 mg PO BID, Pioglitazone 30 mg PO DAILY and NPH 4 Units Breakfast, NPH 4 Units Dinner with ISS pre-admission.
# History of hypothyroidism: TSH 2.0 from [**5-10**] and was on Levothyroxine Sodium 300 mcg PO DAILY upon admission.
Pt was discharged on home dose of Simvastatin 40 mg PO DAILY and Niacin 250 mg PO TID  # Right sided PICC: PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava, as before, inserted via right-sided approach.
# Tube feeds: G tube in place.
# Rash in perianal area: Pt's decubitus wound was dressed with following regimen: Cleanse area around flexiseal with foam cleanser and pat dry.
Apply criticade clear, then wrap xeroform gauze around flexiseal.
# Med rec: - Continue Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN fever/ pain - Hold Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID:PRN constipation - Hold Senna 1 TAB PO BID:PRN constipation - Hold ALPRAZolam 0.25 mg PO TID:PRN anxiety - OxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  5 mg PO/NG Q8H:PRN pain - Hold Albuterol-Ipratropium [**11-30**] PUFF IH Q2H:PRN dyspnea  Transitional Issues: - Complete two weeks of Meropenem (last day [**2168-6-30**]) for Pseudomonas treatment.
- Consider further Prednisone titration if his PMR symptoms are adequately controlled on 10mg q24h - ideally would like to titrate Prednisone off if possible.
- TSH level in 6 months for followup - monitor INR while on coumadin - DISCONTINUE Flagyl on [**2168-7-5**] (end of 2 week course for C. diff) - DNR.
Discussion had with patient who does not wish to pursue palliative care at this time.
- Monitor I&O while on lasix, adjust lasix dose as needed.
