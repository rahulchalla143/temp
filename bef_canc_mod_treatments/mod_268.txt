DISCHARGE LABS: [**2145-1-1**] 05:48AM BLOOD WBC-10.3 RBC-3.77* Hgb-10.2* Hct-32.2* MCV-85 MCH-27.0 MCHC-31.6 RDW-15.9* Plt Ct-394 [**2145-1-1**] 05:48AM BLOOD Glucose-170* UreaN-32* Creat-1.1 Na-135 K-4.3 Cl-94* HCO3-35* AnGap-10 [**2145-1-1**] 05:48AM BLOOD Calcium-9.0 Phos-3.5 Mg-2.3  Brief Hospital Course: 86 yo M with multiple medical problems including 3VD s/p multiple PCIs, PVD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, AF, pulmonary fibrosis and DMI presenting from home with 2 days of lethargy, hypotension and subjective fevers initially thought to be most consistent with severe pneumonia complicated by septic shock.
The sputum gram stain revealed GNR diplocci, and GPC in pairs and the pt was given Vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin initially to cover for hospital acquired pathogens including MRSA and pseudomonas and was switched to Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone/Levofloxacin and then to Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin on [**12-21**] to cover CAP.
His sputum cx grew out Moraxella and his antibiotics were narrowed to ceftriaxone and azithromycin on [**12-23**].
He continued to be on Levophed on [**12-23**] with pressures in the 90's/40's.
The antibiotics were discontinued [**12-24**] as pt was essentially afebrile and had no leukocytosis and was likely colonized with Moraxella.
His hypotension resolved and he was successfully weaned off of pressors on [**12-25**].
The patient had repeat multiple episodes of SVT during his ICU stay, converting spontaneously until [**12-26**] when he required adenosine 6mg IV x 2.
He was then started on diltiazem qid.
On the floor he was transitioned from diltiazem to metoprolol 25mg three times per day, which helped his heart rate control.
He had a CXR on [**12-23**] that looked like he may have some pulmonary edema and a lasix gtt was started with attempt to diurese and improve respiratory status.
He was extubated on [**2144-12-28**] and was satting well on nasal cannula.
After further discussion with his family we found that he had recently been started on home oxygen and had been 2LNC at home.
At the time of his discharge he had been weaned to 2.5L nasal cannula.
His medications of ASA, statin and plavix were continued.
#) Acute Renal Failure due to Acute Tubular Necrosis: The patient presented with a creatinine= 2.4 which was likely secondary to hypotension/shock leading to ischemic ATN as the creatinine trended down to baseline of 1.0 with IVF hydration.
He was seen by geriatrics in consult who recommended preserving his sleep/wake cycle, to continue the trazodone as needed for sleep and if his delirium causes him to become a danger to himself then can try 0.5mg of po haldol, however this was not needed during his hospital stay.
