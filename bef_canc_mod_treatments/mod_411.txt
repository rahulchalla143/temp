# Hypoxia/dyspnea/acute COPD exacerbation/recent RML PNA - Presented with shortness of breath and cough, O2 requirement; + sick contact at home (son); no radiographic changes on CXR, overall improvement in prior PNA seen on CT scan comparison; thought to have likely COPD exacerbation; underlying trigger may be chronic subclinical aspiration events; given recent prednisone 40mg course, started on prednisone 60mg + azithromycin.
CTA was performed and was negative for PE, post radiation therapy changes were noted.
Pt was initially given 60mg prednisone which was tapered to 40mg daily.
Pt completed 5 days of azithromycin during her hospitalization for COPD flare.
She was given albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
She was encouraged to use incentive spirometry and continued to encourage smoking cessation.
Given the RML opacification that was seen on CTA and prior CXR, PT WILL NEED TO HAVE A REPEAT CXR OR CT SCAN TO ENSURE RESOLUTION OF OPACIFICATION GIVEN SMOKING HISTORY AND HISTORY OF MALIGNANCY AND POSSIBILITY OF RECURRENT MALIGNANCY SHOULD OPACIFICATION NOT IMPROVE.
