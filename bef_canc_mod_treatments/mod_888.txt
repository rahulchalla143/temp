He was sent to the ICU shortly after admission for closer glucose monitoring and was started on a D10 drip due to very difficult to control blood sugars.
The patient's hypoglycemia was felt likely due to the use of oral hypoglycemic agents in the setting of acute renal failure.
These medications may have longer half life in the setting of acute renal failure and, therefore, the patient's blood sugar was difficult to control.
The patient was weaned from his D10 drip and remained stable during the ICU stay.
The patient was transitioned to regular insulin sliding scale and then restarted on Glipizide only.
The patient will follow-up with his primary care physician for further monitoring of his blood sugars and titration of oral hypoglycemics.
The Metformin was held and will not be restarted due to the patient's chronic renal insufficiency on acute renal failure at this admission.

The patient was continued on aspirin, statin, beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor during this admission.

At the time of discharge, the patient was restarted on his Lasix 20 mg p.o.
In addition, the patient was continued on his Coumadin for A flutter.
The patient's Amiodarone was also increased to 400 mg p.o.
The patient's acute renal failure may be due to the addition of Lasix, 20 mg as an outpatient.
