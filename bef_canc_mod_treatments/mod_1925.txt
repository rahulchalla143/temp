Vitamin C  PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **], [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].D.
Chest:  Barrel chest with distant breath sounds, prolonged expiration with wheezes.
Colostomy bag intact, with soft formed stool.
The patient was started on empiric antibiotic coverage while waiting for sputum culture analysis with Levaquin 500 mg once daily.
She was also continued on stress dose steroids and nebulizers.
She was maintained on noninvasive ventilation through her hospital course in the  Medical Intensive Care Unit with mask ventilation transitioning to BiPAP.
She was able to maintain peripheral oxygen saturations and PCO2 in the 90s, with periods of rest off of her BiPAP on Venturi mask and nasal cannula combined, and also just nasal cannula on its own.
The patient remained tenuous during her Medical Intensive Care Unit course, and had an acute decompensation which was requiring increasing oxygen requirement in order to maintain her peripheral oxygen saturation greater than 88%.
The issue of intubation and difficulty weaning once this was to be instituted was discussed with the patient and her daughter, possible long-term chronic ventilation support would be required.
Both the patient and her daughter were in agreement if intubation was required.
She continued to improve, requiring mostly nasal cannula only, with periods of rest on the Venturi mask and nasal cannula ventilation.
She was given a dose of vancomycin and three days of ceftazidime during this increase in her sputum production for coverage of nosocomial infection, however, given her rapid clinical improvement, it was thought that this was unlikely, and the ceftazidime was discontinued.
She was then started empirically on Flagyl for likely C. difficile with cultures pending.
She was discontinued off of her Digoxin, and started on Diltiazem, which was titrated up to 60 mg four times a day for her heart rate control.
Her blood pressure was elevated, and the patient was continued on Zestril, started at 10 and increased to 30 mg once daily at the time of this dictation, which obtained better blood pressure control without any evidence of increase in her creatinine.
She received one time dosage of lasix secondary to desaturation and crackles on examination, presumed fluid overload with pulmonary congestion.
At that point, she diuresed on very low-dose lasix and then maintained negative I&O status for the remaining following days.
The patient was maintained on enteric-coated aspirin as well as her Lipitor.
Endocrine:  The patient normally is on Glipizide secondary to her diabetes from steroids.
She was maintained on regular insulin sliding scale only, and transitioned over to NPH, given the need to titrate while her steroids were being adjusted.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient was on Protonix given her steroids.
Her BUN and creatinine were borderline high upon admission, and she was given some intravenous fluid hydration, given the mask impeded full oral intake.
She had hypernatremia with a sodium of 149, for which she was given free-water repletion via intravenous and then encouraged to take in oral intake.
Neuropsych:  The patient was continued on her standing Remeron and Paxil.
She was on Ativan as needed in order to maintain compliance with her mask ventilation.
She was given Tylenol for pain as needed.
Receives standing potassium, magnesium and calcium.
Prophylaxis:  Maintained on Protonix and subcutaneous heparin.
Lines:  She had an arterial line while she was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, as well as peripheral intravenous lines and a Foley.
