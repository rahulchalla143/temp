Pulmonary:  The patient remained intubated postoperatively until day two secondary to bilious secretions aspirated from the endotracheal tube on postoperative day one.
Aspiration precautions were initiated and the nasogastric tube was replaced.
He was weaned off of his O2 nasal cannula with appropriate saturations on room air and no other respiratory events.
In the interim, he had been started on intravenous Lopressor, but on postoperative day eight, the intravenous Lopressor and Telemetry were discontinued.

In the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively, the patient was restarted on his total parenteral nutrition.
His nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day four.
A post-pyloric Dobbhoff feeding tube was subsequently placed on postoperative day 16 and tube feeds were initiated.

Normal saline was also added to the tube feed regimen.
He was discharged home with prescriptions for sodium chloride and bicarbonate tablets.
Infectious Disease:   At the time of admission, the patient was started on intravenous Fluconazole for oral thrush.
His postoperative course was notable for initiating Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl intravenously.
