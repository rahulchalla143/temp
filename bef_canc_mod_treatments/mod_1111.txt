Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-9-11**] there is variation in precordial lead placement but the T wave abnormalities recorded in leads V4-V6 are not apparent.
On the left, a segment of pleural drain is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 9147**] is a 78-year-old man with a PMH of gastric CA with known malignant effusions, obstructive uropathy of unclear etiology s/p right nephrostomy tube, and recent basilar stroke who presented from rehab with hypoxia and hypotension.
Review of prior culture data demonstrates pan-sensitive Klebsiella in [**8-23**].
He was treated empirically with vancomycin and Zosyn for urosepsis.
Urine culture taken from the nephrostomy tube later grew out Pseudomonas sensitive to Zosyn, so the vancomycin was stopped.
With regard to his recent recurrent urinary tract infections, review of the records shows that patient has had several such infections since his right nephrostomy tube was placed in late [**Month (only) 216**].
The nephrostomy tube has not been changed since that time.
Urology was consulted for management recommendations and recommended that patient have the right nephrostomy tube changed in interventional radiology.
This procedure was succesffuly performed on [**11-25**].
Patient will require 6 more days of Zosyn for completion of total 14 day course of treatment.
Per urology foley catheter should be continued until this appointment.
# Hypoxemia: Patient saturating well on 3L NC at time of admission.
Patient underwent left pleural catheter placement on the third hospital day.
The effusion is a known malignant effusion, and per interventional pulmonary, the catheter should be left in place.
His respiratory status improved with drainage of the effusion and he was able to be weaned off oxygen.
Patient subsequently required drainage Q3d and drained 1L on each occasion.
Per Pulmonary consult should continue drainage every 2-3 days or per symptoms.
A trial of capecitabine may be considered post discharge.
# CVA: s/p CVA in the setting of AF: Lovenox was held after the Pleurex was placed.
Gave IV heprin in the interim per renal functions.
Lovenox was restarted at 60mg [**Hospital1 **] (i.e.
less than 1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] as his renal functions are marginal), anti-factor Xa measurment may be done post discharge for optimization of dosing.
Good rate control was achieved by increasing PO Metoprolol dose to 25mg QID.
Anticoagulation with Lovenox as discussed above.
He received one unit of packed red cells on the third hospital day, due to slight drop in hematocrit.
# HTN: well controlled with metoprolol as above.
# Depression/Anxiety: Continue home trazodone PRN at HS.
# Obstructive Uropathy s/p right percutaneous nephrostomy: Management for his obstructive uropathy and recurrent urinary tract infections is described above.
