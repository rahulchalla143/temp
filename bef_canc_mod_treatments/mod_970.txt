The heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged, with gas containing structure and density along the right mediastinal border consistent with a a esophagectomy and pull- through.
IMPRESSION: S/P endotracheal intubation.
There are surgical sutures adjacent to this region.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is stranding in the left inguinal soft tissue, which could be post-op as there was prior lymph node dissection in this region.
According to the referring surgeon, this is consistent with the region of the recent post-surgical procedure in this region.
There are bilateral fat containing inguinal hernias.
