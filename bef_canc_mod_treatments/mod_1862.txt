Arterial blood gases on 100% nonrebreather was pH 7.21, pCO2 46, paO2 296.
Cardiac - The patient was admitted originally to the Medicine Service and placed on telemetry for rule out myocardial infarction protocol.
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed and a stent was placed.
The patient subsequently did well post cardiac catheterization.
The patient was continued on Aspirin and started on Plavix.
The patient's Lopressor was subsequently titrated up.
Given the fact that the patient had acute renal failure post cardiac catheterization and unable to tolerate ace inhibitor, the patient was started on Hydralazine and Isordil in order to decrease morbidity and mortality.
Neurology - The patient upon admission was relatively [**Name2 (NI) 3584**] and oriented times three, however, during hospital course status post cardiac catheterization and intubation and acute renal failure, the patient's mental status subsequently waxed and waned and the patient was subsequently confused most of the time.
Status post cardiac catheterization, the patient was subsequently Dopamine pressors for blood pressure support for a brief period of time.

As per hematology/oncology, the patient's Factor VIII deficiency seemed to have resolved and did not require any transfusions during this hospital course.
However, the patient required transfusion of packed red blood cells secondary to her anemia.
However, during transfusion, the patient had subsequently flash pulmonary edema requiring Lasix therapy and intubation.
As per hematology/oncology, transfusion of packed red blood cells will be held off until absolutely necessary due to the fact that the patient has a predisposition for congestive heart failure.
