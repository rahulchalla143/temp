Saphenous vein graft site was healing well.
His sternum was stable with wound mostly healed except for purulent to bloody discharge from the base with a sinus tract superiorly and an area of erythema of about 2 cm X 2 cm.
He was started on intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
He was taken to the operating room on [**2134-5-24**], where he underwent sternal debridement.
The wound was left open, and on [**2134-5-27**], the patient underwent partial sternotomy, debridement of skin subcutaneous tissue and bone, removal of hardware from sternum, omental flap to sternum, and bilateral musculocutaneous advancement flap, and closure of his open sternal wound under general anesthesia.
He tolerated the procedure well and was then sent to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
He was continued on vancomycin and ceftriaxone postoperatively.
The patient remained intubated after his initial debridement and was eventually extubated on [**5-29**].
He tolerated extubation well.
He was restarted on his CellCept.
His ceftriaxone was stopped on day 10 due to low suspicion for sternal osteomyelitis.
He was continued on the intravenous vancomycin which he was to continue on for two weeks postoperatively.
Due to the fact that the patient is a renal transplant recipient he will be dosed by vancomycin and levels checked randomly every two to three days.
He was on levofloxacin which he was to continue on until the drains are removed.
Postoperatively, the patient also had some swallowing difficulties and was placed on nectar-thick liquids for two days; however, he recovered normal function and was able to take a normal diet.
