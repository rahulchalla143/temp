Her infectious history begins when her left prosthetic joint speciated S.lugdenesis in [**2-/2204**] requiring washout with a retention strategy and 6-weeks of IV Vancomycin and Rifampin, followed by 3-months of Rifampin and Doxycycline.
She was subsequently re-admitted on [**2205-7-29**] with on-going left hip pain and underwent debridement and irrigation of a left hip abscess, removal of arthroplasty hardware components, antibiotic spacer placement, with VAC application for wound closure on [**2205-7-30**].
Her post-operative course was complicate by delirium, hypotension and acute renal failure and episodes of coffee-ground hematemesis without decreased hematocrit (treated for H. pylori infection) and she was discharged to rehab on IV Vancomycin for 6-weeks (on [**2205-8-9**]).
She was reportedly hypotensive to the 80s in the ED, but responsive to IV fluids and 2 units of packed red cells.
She underwent an uncomplicated incision and drainage and placement of articulating antibiotic spacer on [**2205-8-15**].
Tissue cultures from her prior debridement had speciated Staphylococcus lugdunensis (similar to her prior hip infection) and her blood cultures from [**2205-8-12**] speciated two species of Staphylococcus epidermidis.
Infectious disease was involved and recommended continuing the extended course of Vancomycin IV.
She was discharged to rehab on [**2205-8-20**] to continue IV antibiotics.
She is now being directly admitted from clinic given on-going hip pains and evidence of a larger open wound.
She has been working with PT at rehab, but has not ambulated since her first surgery in late [**2205-6-28**].

#Septic Joint/Left Hip Infection-  The patient went to the OR on [**2205-9-11**] for an I and D of her left hip, removal of antibiotic spacer, and placement of wound VAC.
Her post-op course was complicated by hypotension with BPs 85/50 requiring phenylephrine and transfer to the TICU from [**Date range (3) 98334**].
She was transferred to the MICU and transfused 2 additional units PRBCs and all BP meds were held given her hypotension.
Her wound VAC was not hooked up to suction, due to a large hematoma and concern for continued bleeding from wound She went back to the OR on [**2205-9-16**] for repeat washout and her post op course was again c/b by hypotension with SBPs in the 70s.
She received pRBC and FFP x1, vitamin K, and was admitted to the TSICU for close monitoring.
She had repeated washouts and final closure of her hip wound on [**2205-9-19**].
The patient was continued on her IV Vanc for her previous Staphylococcus lugdunensis infection.
Her wound cultures grew Serratia marcens and E. Coli, for which she was initially treated with Zosyn and subsequently narrowed down to IV ciprofloxacin.
She will continue IV ciprofloxacin for 6 weeks ( last day of [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 621**] [**2205-10-24**]).
