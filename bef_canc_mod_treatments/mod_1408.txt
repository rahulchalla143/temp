The stricture was unable to be safely dilated and after a lengthy discussion with the patient and family, he was brought to the operating room today for substernal colon interposition.

Because of these findings, it was determined that standard barium esophagram to evaluate for fistula would not be possible.
On [**2168-5-4**] the patient was taken to the operating room where he underwent re-do neck exploration, re-do laparotomy with harvesting of left colon and substernal colon interposition.
Due to ventilator dependence, he was taken for a tracheostomy on [**5-13**].
While intubated, propofol and fentanyl were used.
Due to hypotension, regimen switched to versed.
Patient improved with Ativan for his agitation control.
On discharge, he was then maintained on a roxicet down his j-tube for pain control.
Fluid bolus provided for hypotension and pressors avoided to perserve conduit vascular flow.
He did receive lasix for diuresis mid hospital course but appears euvolemic on dishcharge.
Extubated POD1 but required re-intubation due to respiratory distress.
ID consulted for antibiotic regimen and due to many allergies, started on aztreonam.
Interventional pulmonary performed a diagnostic thoracentesis, removing 500ml of exudative fluid.
A pigtail chest tube was then placed and drained > 1500ml during his stay and was subsequently removed on [**5-11**].
Bilious secretions were found in the airway, suggesting a re-occurence of his tracheo-gastric fistula.
With ventilator dependence and respiratory failure, he was taken to the operating room on [**5-13**] for tracheal stenting and a percutaneous tracheostomy.
GI/FEN: Pt is s/p colonic interposition for esophageal condiut.
Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.
He was started on trophic tubefeeds to J-tube.
Nutrition followed the patient and he was advanced and tolerated goal tube feeds.
This resolved with tube feed regimine change.
ENT also scoped him but visualization of vocal cords was difficult.
Received several boluses of fluid and albumin for low urine output.
While attempting to wean him from the ventilator, he was diuresed with lasix with a goal of 2-3L/day and reached his dry weight.
Lasix was discontinued and he effectively auto-diuresed.
Foley was discontinued and the patient was voiding fine.
He was given pre-operative antibiotics of ancef and flagyl.
With an elevated wbc and RLL infiltrate, he was started empirically on flagyl and aztreonam for pneumonia.
He was maintained on that antiobiotic regimen with vancomycin added for broader coverage.
Patient developed fever to 103 with elevated wbc 25, with worsening CXR, he received another bronchoscopy.
He continued on aztreonam, Flagyl, and inhaled tobramycin which was dc'd on [**2168-5-25**].
He did not require insulin on discharge.
Hematology: The patient was transfused with blood on [**2168-5-6**] for hypotension, hct of 27% and to prevent ischemia around his anastamosis.
Venodyne boots were used for DVT prophylaxis.
Wound: JP drains were removed on POD15 after amylase levels were checked and confirmed no evidence of any anastomotic leaks.
The staples from his abdominal incision were removed and steri-strips applied.
Neck staples near the trach were removed the date of his discharge.
IV: Left dual lumen PICC line inserted [**2168-5-14**] and should be dc'd upon rehab admission.
