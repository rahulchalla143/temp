HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 4410**] is an 82-year-old male with history of end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, SVT and triple A who presented with right upper quadrant pain, right flank pain, nausea, retching and decreased appetite.
Of note, on [**2111-6-29**] he was admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] for line sepsis with MSSA and treated with Vanc and Gent and then switched to Nafcillin for 6 weeks, despite a TEE that was negative for vegetation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, BPH, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, SVT, CVA, PVD with severe claudication in left leg, status post left transmetatarsal amputation, gastritis and esophagitis, atrial fibrillation, triple A 4.3 cm in 12/98, 4.6 cm in 3/00, right inguinal hernia, GI bleed [**2111-6-5**] while hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2025**] for line sepsis.
MEDICATIONS:  Amiodarone 200 mg q day, Nephrocaps one mg q day, Phos-Lo 667 mg, three tablets tid, TUMS 500 mg three tabs tid, Percocet 2 tabs q h.s.
LABORATORY DATA:  White count 13.2, 83 polys, no bands, 10 lymphs, 6 monos, hematocrit 41.5, platelet count 182,000, PT 13.4, INR 1.3, PTT 30.2, sodium 141, potassium 5.2, chloride 94, CO2 27, BUN 69, creatinine 10.5, glucose 87, blood cultures were sent.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions, septal line consistent with mild interstitial edema.
The patient was started on Vanc 1 gm IV q day.
He was given 2 mg of Morphine for the pain and they attempted to wean the patient off the non rebreather.
While in the ICU the antibiotic coverage was broadened to include Ceftriaxone and Flagyl.
The patient's pressures were supported with Neo and the catheter was changed to a right groin Quinton catheter.
On hospital day #5 a TTE was performed that showed a mildly dilated left atrium and a small mass or artifact seen on the aortic valve in the LV outflow tract.
At this point the patient had grown out 6 bottles of Oxacillin sensitive staff.
The patient's antibiotic coverage was now changed to Oxacillin and Gentamycin.
The goal was Oxacillin for six weeks and Gentamycin for two weeks.
Throughout the stay the patient received hemodialysis three times a week without complications.
At this time it was felt that it was unlikely to be able to get a PICC line in the patient.
So after discussion with ID, antibiotic coverage was now going to be changed to Oxacillin while an inpatient and Vancomycin dosed at hemodialysis as an outpatient, again for total treatment of 6 weeks.
On hospital day #9, also the right groin Quinton was removed without complication and on hospital day 11 a tunneled groin cath was placed by IR.
This tunneled groin cath was to be used for hemodialysis only.
Discussions with transplant surgery were begun and the plan is for an AV fistula after completion of the antibiotics.
The total antibiotic therapy was started on [**11-12**] and the end date is [**12-23**].
He will receive Oxacillin while an inpatient which will be changed to Vancomycin dosed at hemodialysis as an outpatient.
