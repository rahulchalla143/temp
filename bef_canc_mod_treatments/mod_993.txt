was restarted on Lisinopril, a medication which has been held in the past because of hypotension and acute renal failure.
Labs drawn after initiating a second trial of Lisinopril revealed the aforementioned renal compromise with associated hyperkalemia.
Persistently elevated creatinine and potassium were noted.
additionally received small IVF boluses with improvement in SBP to her baseline of high 90s, low 100s.
ROS negative for h/o stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
ECG [**2108-1-9**]: Sinus rhythm Ventricular premature complex Nonspecific ST-T abnormalities Since previous tracing of [**2108-1-2**], ventricular ectopy present and ST-T wave changes appear slightly less prominent   Stress: TOTAL EXERCISE TIME:  4 % MAX HRT RATE ACHIEVED:  55  INTERPRETATION: 74 yo woman (severe cardiomyopathy with LVEF ~ 20%) was referred for a CAD evaluation.
The patient was administered 0.142 mg/kg/min of persantine over 4 minutes.
The hemodynamic response to the persantine infusion was appropriate.
-Support BP with gentle NS boluses if SBP < 85 and symptomatic -QD potassium and creatinine -QD lytes in setting of metabolic acidosis -strict I/O's -Renal u/s --> renal consult -Avoid nephrotoxins (ie, contrast/NSAIDS)  .
Pump: CHF not an active issue, but EF = 20-25% ([**12-2**]) limits [**Female First Name (un) **] of fluid resuscitation for kidneys.

[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 44432**] PGY1   Past Medical History:  1) CHF: EF 20-25%, presumably ischemic 2) CRI: baseline creatinine of 1.1 - 1.7 recently in 1/'[**07**], now at 3 on transfer 3) CAD (Persantine MIBI 8/'[**06**]): Large reversible defect involving the LAD, fixed defects in the PDA with hypokinesis of the anteroseptal, distal anterior, distal septal,distal inferior and apical walls.
Patient deferred cardiac catheterization 4) Colon Cancer - s/p subtotal colectomy and ileostomy on 7/'[**06**]  5) Relative Hypotension - baseline SBPs in 90 - 100s .
The patient's creatinine quickly corrected and returned to near baseline with fluids and discontinuation of Lisinopril, such that creatinine was trending down to 1.8 on discharge.
Her pressures responded quickly to fluid boluses and cessation of her anti-hypertensives, including Lisinopril.
ASA was continued but BB was held given hypotention, with plan to re-start if possible after discharge in conjunction with the patient's PCP.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] statin was added to the patient's treatment regimen and prescribed at time of discharge.
#Proph: The patient was maintained on Heparin SQ throughout the hospitalization.
Medications on Admission: Aspirin 81mg QD Lisinopril 2.5mg QD Toprol XL 25mg QD  Discharge Medications: 1.
Aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO DAILY (Daily).
Atorvastatin 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Because high potassium can damage the heart, we treated you with medications to lower the amount of potassium in your body, including Kayexelate.
The amount of potassium in your body decreased and is now normal.
During your hospitalization, we stopped the following medications: Lisinopril Toprol XL (please discuss resuming this medication with your PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 503**]).
We began the following medications: Atorvastatin 10mg daily  Please keep all follow-up appointments.
Please ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31**] to discuss 1. the management of your blood pressure, and 2. the addition of Atorvastatin to your medication regimen, and 3. the addition of a beta blocker as your blood pressure and HR permit.
