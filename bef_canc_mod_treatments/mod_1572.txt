HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine of 2.1 to 3), type 2 diabetes, bilateral staghorn calculi, and presumed diastolic dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, and atrial fibrillation now being transferred from Medical Intensive Care Unit to the Medicine Service following treatment for acute-on-chronic renal failure with anion gap metabolic acidosis.
Of note, the patient was in the midst of completing a 14-day course of ciprofloxacin starting on [**12-17**] for Klebsiella cellulitis.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with a Renal consultation and was started on aggressive fluids and bicarbonate drip.
She continued to receive aggressive hydration, and her creatinine improved to 4.6, while a repeat arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.28, and her chemistries showed a bicarbonate which had increased to 20.
She continued to be followed by Renal and was recommended to be transferred to the floor with continued gentle intravenous fluids with continued bicarbonate repletion.
Peripheral vascular disease; status post left popliteal posterior tibial bypass via saphenous vein graft.
Status post left fifth toe amputation and left transmetatarsal amputation.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Her medications at home included)  1.
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once per day.
Hydralazine 250 mg by mouth four times per day.
Lopressor 100 mg by mouth twice per day.

Glipizide 5 mg by mouth once per day.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  (In the hospital, her medications at the time of transfer included)  1.
Epogen 5000 units every Tuesday and [**Year (4 digits) 2974**].
Hydralazine 10 mg q.6h.
Amphojel 30 mg q.8h.
Coumadin 5 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
Zantac 150 mg by mouth once per day.
Glipizide 5 mg by mouth once per day.
Isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg by mouth twice per day.
Lipitor 10 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
Metoprolol 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
Insulin sliding-scale.
Given the degree of her acidemia with a pH of 7.16, she was initially transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where she received aggressive hydration with bicarbonate supplementation.
[**Name2 (NI) 227**] her recent use of antibiotics and several eosinophils in the urine, there was concern for an acute interstitial nephritis.
Given that the patient was ineligible for magnetic resonance imaging given a pacemaker, it was decided that she may qualify for a follow-up ultrasound as an outpatient for further evaluation of possible renal artery stenosis and re-evaluation of hydronephrosis.
While on the floor, the patient was given gentle intravenous fluids with bicarbonate.
Her urine output increased markedly, and she was given fluids to help keep up with her losses.
Meanwhile, the patient was continued on phosphate binders for her elevated phosphorous; she had received calcium carbonate and aluminum hydroxide.
She was instructed to continue on calcium carbonate 1000 mg three times per day as an outpatient.
Her hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued secondary to concerns about her renal insufficiency.
Meanwhile, her beta blocker was increased from 100 mg twice per day to 100 mg three times per day.
Her hydralazine was titrated from 10 mg to 50 mg by mouth q.6h., and her isosorbide dinitrate was increased from 20 mg twice per day to 20 mg three times per day.
She was scheduled to be evaluated as an outpatient one to two days status post discharge for additional blood pressure measurements and electrolyte checks to determine whether it would be safe to resume her hydrochlorothiazide at this point.
She was continued on Coumadin once her INR was verified.
She was also continued on aspirin and Lipitor.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  Although the patient had rales on pulmonary examination, the patient continued to saturate well off nasal cannula oxygen during her hospitalization.
She did not require a transfusion; however, she was continued on Epogen 5000 units every Tuesday and [**Name2 (NI) 2974**].
She was continued on Coumadin for a history of atrial fibrillation.
Given concerns about an elevated INR on Coumadin, the patient had a right-sided peripherally inserted central catheter line placed on [**1-7**] that was subsequently discontinued at the time of her discharge.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was completing a 14-day course of ciprofloxacin for Klebsiella cellulitis.
Meanwhile, she was evaluated by both Vascular Surgery and Podiatry for a wound at the site of her left transmetatarsal amputation.
It was recommended that the patient continue on wet-to-dry Regranex dressings twice per day.
ENDOCRINOLOGY ISSUES:  The patient maintained excellent blood sugar control on her glipizide and insulin sliding-scale.
Status post left-sided transmetatarsal amputation; wound site stable.
Status post debridement of right toenails.
Zoloft 50 mg by mouth once per day.
Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once per day.
Glipizide 5 mg by mouth once per day.
Hydralazine 50 mg by mouth q.6h.
Coumadin 5 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
Metoprolol 100 mg by mouth three times per day.
Isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg by mouth three times per day.
Zantac 150 mg by mouth once per day.
Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.

Calcium carbonate 1000 mg by mouth three times per day (with meals).
Insulin sliding-scale.
Ambien by mouth at hour of sleep.
