# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic CHF with dilated CMP (EF <20%)/PUMP:  No clear precipitant for his worsening heart failure, he did not report symptoms of ischemia, infection and denies dietary indiscretion or medication non-compliance.
The patient was started on a lasix drip and milrinone infusion for inotropic support.
On [**9-22**], pt underwent right heart catheterization with PA cath placement which showed initial numbers: CI 2.92, demonstarting improved hemodynamics on milrinone.
The patient spiked a temp to 101 on [**9-23**] and therefore the PA catheter was pulled and cultures sent (see below).
On [**9-23**] lasix gtt was stopped and patient transitioned to PO torsemide.
Patient weaned from milrinone on [**9-24**] and isordil and hydralazine were started for afterload reduction.
Once patient appeared euvolemic torsemide was decreased to daily and dose titrated to maintain euvolemia.
On [**9-26**] metoprolol was restarted.
He was discharged with a dry weight of 161.5 lbs and on the following diuretic regimen: torsemide 60 mg daily.
# RHYTHM: Patient with AF and is s/p AVJ ablation with biventricular pacing at rate of 85.
INR supratherapeutic to 3.6 at admission and warfarin initially held.
Patient was placed on heparin gtt for anticoagulation during peri-procedural time.
His warfarrin was restarted after procedure.
The PA catheter was pulled at that time and cultures were sent.
The patient was started on empiric antibiotics of vanc and cefepime.
Catheter tip was with no growh.
Antibiotics were stopped at 48 hours when only culture data of gram positive rods (most likely contaminent).
Nephrotoxins were avoided when possible and medications were renally dosed.
#COPD: on home O2 at night- uses 2L NC overnight.
Home tiotropium and overnight supplemental oxygen was continued.
