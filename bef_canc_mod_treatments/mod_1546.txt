Admission Date:  [**2164-6-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-6-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-8-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: EMERGENCY  Allergies: Lipitor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation, PEG tube, trach  History of Present Illness: 65 year old woman with history of PE on lifetime coumadin, asthma, recent CABG [**4-20**] with long stay complicated by PTX, a fib, and pleural effusions presents with nonproductive cough, dyspnea and low grade fevers x 5 days.
Subsequently, she developed a nonproductive cough, fever to 100.6, fatigue, malaise, and worsening dyspnea.
She was evaluated by CT surgery who recommended IR guided tap once INR <2.
During her ED stay, she developed a fib with RVR in 170s, she was being given lopressor 5 when she dropped her SBPs to the 70s, then fortunately spontaneously converted to sinus tach in 110s.
She then later got up to go to the restroom and developed again a fib with RVR to 180s and againwas given lopressor 5mg IV x 2.
She was also given ceftriaxone 1gm IV ONCE, azithromycin 500mg PO ONCE and vitamin K 5mg IV ONCE.
She was also given levoquin 750mg IV ONCE just prior to transfer and sent to the MICU given her unstable hemodynamics.
She denied any chest pain, weight gain, abdominal pain, recent nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, calf pain, recent travel, hemoptysis, hematemesis, black or bloody stools, dysuria, urinary frequency, headache, neck stiffness.
Past Medical History: Diffuse carotid disease Hodgkin's disease stage 2 in '[**22**] treated with total body radiation Reactive airways disease/Pulmonary Fibrosis Multiple PNAs, most recently in [**2163-6-11**] requiring ICU care for sepsis/hypotension Functional Asplenism s/p radiation treatment Radiation induced ovarian failure s/p total hysterectomy and Estradiol therapy Hypothyroidism Supraventricular tachycardia (Presumably Afib) Gastroesophageal Pulmonary emoblism (VTE) in '[**54**] on longterm low-dose coumadin Right chest lentigo [**Female First Name (un) 564**]/HSV esophagitis in setting of being on steroids s/p Staging laparotomy [**2122**]  Social History: Patient is married and lives in [**Location 1514**], MA with her husband.
Micro: Catheter tip [**2164-6-14**]: [**Female First Name (un) **] ALBICANS, PRESUMPTIVE IDENTIFICATION.
CXR (portable AP) [**2164-6-25**]: In comparison with study of [**6-24**], the tracheostomy tube is unchanged, as is the central catheter and pacemaker leads.
Her hospital course has been most notable for intubation, VATS procedure, treatment for pneumonia, failed extubation, and subsequent tracheostomy and PEG tube placement.
During her ICU stay, she was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin.
She was subsequently broadened to vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin and completed 10 days of vanc/cef and 8 days of levofloxacin.
She underwent thoracentesis with placement of pigtail catheter initially, given loculated pleural effusion.
This was subsequently converted to two chest tubes, and she later underwent successful VATS with drainage of left sided effusion, drained 750cc of inflammatory appearing fluid that did not grossly appear infected (cx negative).
She was slowly weaned from the ventilator, however, failed her first extubation from multiple causes including poor nutrition, deconditioning/weakness, hypertension, tachyarrhythmia, mild volume overload and anxiety.
This was despite attempting nitro gtt during her SBT.
Per discussion with the husband and family, tracheostomy and PEG tube placement were pursued on hospital day 13.
-in order to optimize status would recommend diuresis (currently getting 40 PO daily) with goal of -500 to 1L daily while following creatinine.
It was changed from Diskus to HFA at the time of discharge.
She was loaded with amiodarone gtt and kept on maintenance 400 mg [**Hospital1 **], per discussion with her cardiologist Dr.[**Name (NI) 3733**].
She was bridged with heparin gtt and was started on coumadin prior to discharge.
Heparin gtt was changed to Lovenox prior to discharge.
-her INR was 1.2 on the day of discharge and she will need Lovenox 60 mg SC Q12H until INR is therapeutic (goal [**3-15**]).
Coumadin dose increased from 1 mg to 2 mg daily on the day of discharge.
The Coumadin dose will likely need to be adjusted once the patient is therapeutic.
She completed course of vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin for HCAP.
Remainder of culture data was negative, with exception of catheter tip growing [**Female First Name (un) 564**] (see below).
She was continued on IV flagyl and PO vancomycin during her Abx, given her history of Cdiff.
It was noted that her upper extremity BP were 40 points lower than her arterial line pressures.
# [**Female First Name (un) 564**] from catheter tip: she was continued on fluconazole to complete a 2 week course.
# Free air in abdomen: Small amount of free air seen in abdomen after PEG tube placement.
G-tube study was done that showed all contrast in the stomach so this was felt likely to be expected amount of air with PEG placement and not pathologic.
# Anemia: Patient required red blood cell transfusion on 3 occasions in the ICU, though the patient never had any signficant bleeding, she remained guaiac negative and and so her anemia was felt most likely due to frequent blood draws, poor nutritional status and laboratory fluctiations.
Her last HCT <25 occurred on [**2164-6-23**] and she received 1 unit PRBCs.
Her HCT on the day of discharge is 26.5 and should be rechecked every 3-7 days and transfused for HCT <24 given her cardiac history.
# Nutrition: PEG tube was placed on hospitald day 13.
-repeat Abd Xray to ensure improvement in free air -consider increasing fiber content of tube feeds if needed for constipation .
-will need social work and possibly psychiatric support ongoing.

We treated your pneumonia with antibiotics and took fluid from your lung.
Then Thoracic surgery did a VATS procedure which you tolerated well.
You were intubated and did not easily wean from the ventilator so you required trach and PEG.
You also had rapid atrial fibrillation and you were started on amiodarone which helps to control your rate.
