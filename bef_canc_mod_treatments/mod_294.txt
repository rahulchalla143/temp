Recent hospitalization was for a mitral valve replacement and a tricuspid valve repair, which resulted in a prolonged and PEG tube placement.
Additionally, during that hospitalization, he developed a right sided loculated effusion for which he underwent a videoscopic thorascopy for removal.
Of note, he was sent out on a course of Vancomycin for MRSA positive sputum culture on [**2113-8-22**].
Ceftazidime and Levofloxacin were added empirically for gram-negative coverage after a culture grew gram-negative rods.
Coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2097**].
Prostate cancer status post prostatectomy in [**2108**].
Status post coronary artery bypass graft times two in [**2097**].
Status post colonoscopy in [**2109**].
Status post colectomy in [**2107**].
Status post radial prostatectomy in [**2108**].
Status post right urethral stent with ileostomy.
Prozac 20 mg per G tube q.d.
Digoxin 0.25 per G tube q.d.
Protonix 40 mg per G tube q.d.
Lasix 20 mg per G tube q.d.
Simethicone 80 q.i.d.
On the vent he was in a pressure-support mode with pressure support of 8, PEEP of 5, and FIO2 of 50%.
Colostomy bag was in place.
Urostomy bag was in place.
The patient was status post thoracotomy, bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right than on the left.
Fluid collection has enhancing walls and empyema could not be excluded.
PULMONARY:  The patient's pulmonary status was believed to be complicated that he had infiltrates on chest x-ray and CT, as well as pleural effusions.
Our differential at the time of admission included that this was due to pneumonia, congestive heart failure, or post pericardotomy changes.
Because of this, the Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone were discontinued.
At the time of discharge, he is on the sixth day of Levaquin and he needs to continue a two-week course.
The patient was started on Captopril 12.5 t.i.d.
and Lasix 60 mg b.i.d.
with the goal of this therapy was to offload fluid from him since he was clearly fluid overloaded on examination.
Cardiology consultation was obtained to ask if the patient might have a post cardiotomy syndrome or be in CHF.
The long-term plan for the patient is as follows:  He will receive two weeks of treatment with Levaquin for presumed pneumonia.
Additionally, he will be put on Lasix for the next two weeks with the goal of diuresing at 500 cc to a liter a day.
If his pulmonary status is not improved with treatment for pneumonia and diuresis for fluid overload, consideration will then be given for performing a diagnostic thoracentesis or possibly giving a trial of Prednisone for post cardiotomy syndrome.
The decision was made not to do diagnostic thoracentesis on him in house, because the INR was therapeutic and if were to stop his Coumadin, he would have to be put on Lepirudin rather than heparin since he has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
The thinking was that before anything such as this would be done, he deserved a trial of antibiotics and diuresis.
Additionally, the Digoxin was decreased from 0.25 mg q.d.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  As mentioned above, continued Levofloxacin for a total course of two weeks.
He was put on Prevacid for ulcer prevention.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Multifactorial respiratory failure requiring maintenance on the ventilator.
Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d.
Prevacid 30 mg per G tube q.d.
Prozac 20 mg q.d.
Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
Promote tube feeds at 75 cc an hour.
Coumadin 3 mg q.d.
Captopril 12.5 mg t.i.d.
ADDENDUM: After considerable discussion, a trial of corticosteroids was initiated for presumed post-cardiotomy syndrome.
