# respiratory distress - pt with h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] induced BOOP, initially transferred to OSH [**1-9**] being found unresponsive, however apparently due to mucus plugging, and resolved quickly after suction.
Given ongoing secretions and worsening acidosis and patient's history of multiple drug resistent organisms in sputum, decision made to start pt on 10d course of meropenem and vancomycin for ongoing PNA vs tracheobronchitis (day 1 [**8-24**]).
Pt's suctioning requirements gradually decreased on meropenem and vancomycin, to q8h, and he was treated with aggressive pulmonary toilet.
Video speech and swallow was performed on [**2161-9-2**] and the results are still pending.
He will need to have daily prograf levels drawn, with levels faxed to his hepatologist (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**], ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1582**], fax=([**Telephone/Fax (1) 48518**]), so that these can be adjusted (pt has a history of mild rejection).
# ARF/CRI - baseline creatinine unclear (was 1.6-1.7 per OSH consult report).
cre= 2.2 at time of admission to OSH, trended down to 1.9, then up to 2.0, felt [**1-9**] dehydration, and pt's home lasix regimen d/c'd, in favor of rehydration with 125 ml/hr D5NS.
At time of admission, pt's creatinine 1.5, where it remained during hospitalization, this was felt to represent his baseline.
# anemia - baseline hct ~27-30 over past 6 months, though normal in [**12-14**].
Pt was treated for ongoing PNA as above with meropenem/vancomycin based on previous sensitivities.
intermittent heart block when placed on beta-blockade in past, remained in NSR on telemetry this admission.
## pump: euvolemic on exam, no need for lasix presently, had been discontinued at OSH.
## htn: pt hypertensive throughout this admission, his dose of norvasc was increased from 5mg po qdaily to 10mg po qdaily, and hydralazine was added.
Plan was to avoid beta blockade and CCB given h/o "heart block."
He continued to have elevated blood pressure and clonidine 0.1mg [**Hospital1 **] was added.
He was seen by speech and swallow service here and felt safe to advance to regular diet, with thin liquids, with aspiration precautions.
On [**2161-9-1**], patient was noted to have aspirated and a video speech and swallow was performed on [**2161-9-2**].
