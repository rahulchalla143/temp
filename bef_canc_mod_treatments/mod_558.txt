There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferoseptal, inferior, inferolateral, and mid to distal anterolateral hypokinesis.
# Diabetic Ketoacidosis/DM1: anion gap on admission which closed with insulin and IVF.
Restarted on lantus and ISS.
Treated with meropenem for 3-day course for simple cystitis.
# Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure was up to 190s systolic in the ED and required three doses of IV labetalol to bring the BP down to 160s systolic.
BP meds held.
Currently on Lisinopril 20mg and Metoprolol 75mg po bid.
Some concern for metoprolol in the setting of potential cocaine use but the decision was made to continue this as it was felt that the patient is very accustomed to this regimen and reports refraining from using cocaine at this time.
Her pain was treated with opiates and her gabapentin was restarted.
The etiology of her heart problems are likely a combination of her cocaine use, hyperlipidemia, and poorly controlled type 1 DM.
Beta blocker continued once blood pressures were stable.
Home medications including benzos and opiates were restarted once her mental status was felt to be at baseline.
