ALLERGIES:  Lasix produces a rash.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was electively sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, where he was intubated and started on Levaquin and Flagyl for a presumed aspiration pneumonia.
The patient had a rectal tube placed, and was given numerous enemas and stool softeners, which resulted in five to six large bowel movements.
The patient's renal failure gradually improved with intravenous fluids and hold of his Cozaar.
It was thought at that time that the patient's removal of his rectal tube probably caused increased abdominal distention and distention o his colon, which impinged his already tenuous pulmonary status.
A rectal tube was replaced.
The patient returned to the floor, did quite well, was followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] from Pulmonary, who recommended an outpatient sleep study since he thought that the patient had a flail chest status post his sternotomy and his wound dehiscence at that area.
It was thought that rest on BiPAP overnight would allow for better oxygenation, and the patient was placed on BiPAP during his last three to four days of hospitalization, and noted some mild improvement in his oxygenation.
It was decided that his amiodarone would be restarted as an outpatient.
It was decided by Gastroenterology to continue him on Miralax, Lactulose, as well as his as needed stool softeners to permit his bowels to continue to work and prevent them from getting distended, as they were this time.
