Patient was at her PCP's office earlier last week and was found to be anemic (HCT not in system) and was planned for a colonscopy this week.

A stent is noted in the left subclavian artery which is patent.
HbA1c 5.5 LDL 33   Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo female with CAD s/p CABG with only patent LIMA-LAD, COPD, HTN, afib who presents with hematochezia, anemia, and angina, sent to MICU initally where she was transfused with HCT back up to 31, c/b NSTEMI with CHF.
# Stroke: has h/o Afib but her anticoagulation was held in the setting of acute GIB complicated by NSTEMI.
It was felt she would restart ASA 325mg upon discharge.
Her coumadin has been re-started and her hematocrit has remained stable.
While on the floor she was transfused 1 more unit of blood and her HCT was maintained around 30 without any evidence of GI bleeding (stools were without blood).
Given her other comorbidities and stable hematocrit it was decided to defer this procedure at this immediate time.
# NSTEMI: Patient has known bad coronary disease with diseased grafts as well taking up to 3 NTG daily for anginal pain.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended holding anticoagulation until she was stable from her GIB.
she was started on metoprolol 25 tid, atorvastatin 80mg.
her lisinopril and imdur were held to avoid hypotension in the setting of GIB.
# Dyspnea/tachypnea: Patient has COPD at baseline, and uses O2 (2L) at night for comfort and angina with exertion.
Also likely worsened initially in MICU in the setting of volume (blood, FFP, and IVFs).
Diuresed well with IV lasix in the MICU and on the floor.
She was started on po 20mg lasix daily and maintained on her fluticasone and ipratropium nebs.
She is currently doing well on her home requirements of 2L O2 via nasal cannula.
# Afib: patient on metoprolol and coumadin as an outpatient.
Given her above h/o GIB complicated by NSTEMI, cardiology/GI consults recommended that due to her CHADS2 score of 3 she should be restarted on ASA 325mg once her GIB was stabilized.
Despite these efforts the pt suffered from an embolic stroke entailed above and therefore will be continued on coumadin with goal INR [**2-19**].
Glipizide may be resumed at the time of transfer.
