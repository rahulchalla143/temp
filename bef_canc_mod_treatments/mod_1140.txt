History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 27 year old male with past medical history significant for alcohol abuse, peptic ulcer, and a recent month long hospitalization in [**2162-4-27**] for necrotizing pancreatitis which was complicated by respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS), Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) bacteremia, probable pulmonary embolism (PE) for which he is now on coumadin, Clostridium difficile infection, and acalculous cholysystitis status post PCT drainage.
Following his discharge on [**2162-5-26**] he went to rehab on linezolid and reportedly developed a rash so this was stopped.
He was given 4 L IVF without improvement in blood pressure so a central line was placed and he was started on levophed.
His creatinine improved with hydration and he had CT abdomen which showed extensive abdominal and peripancreatic fluid collections but overall no change from prior CT abdomen in [**Month (only) **].
The patient's home coumadin dosing was held given supratherapeutic INR.
ID was consulted and recommended broad spectrum antibiotics including dapto (for VRE given linezolid rash), cefepime, flagyl, and PO vancomycin.
The patient was also started on pancreatic enzymes for continuing diarrhea.
Interventional radiology placed a percutaneous drain into the left paracolic gutter on [**6-25**].
The patient had both a cosyntropin stimulation test and his TSH checked given his SVT and both tests were normal.
Was given Diltiazem 10 mg IV for SVT to 180s but had no change in HR.
Per ID recommendations, the antibiotics were eventually decreased to Zosyn and PO Vancomycin (for C. diff).
Fluid cultures collected from the intra-abdominal fluid collection grew out Lactobacillus spp., and per ID recommendations, Zosyn was changed to PO Augmentin.
In preparation for discharge, he was switched from a Heparin bridge to Lovenox, which was to be continued until his INR became therapeutic on Coumadin.
He was given close follow-up instructions with surgery and infectious diseases.
Past Medical History: (+) Per HPI Gastric ulcer disease requiring EGD in [**2159**] with clipping ETOH abuse Necrotizing pancreatitis ([**5-6**]) with hospital course complicated by:     - VAP (Ventilator-associated pneumonia)     - ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome)     - VRE (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci) bacteremia     - Probable PE     - Clostridium difficile infection     - Acalculous cholysystitis s/p PCT drainage   Social History: Pt lives alone.
He was found to be severely hypotensive and required extensive intravenous fluid resuscitation and a brief course of pressors and a short stay in the medical ICU during which time he was on broad spectrum antibiotics.
A drain was placed into his left paracolic gutter.
His hypotension resolved and he was transferred to the floor and his antibiotic regimen was tapered.
Fluid cultures from the abdominal collection eventually grew out Lactobacillus and the patient was started on Augmentin.
He was discharged after being afebrile for approximately 48 hours with close outpatient follow-up.
His hyptension was refrectory to 8L of NS in ED, and he required pressors.
Potential sources infecitous included intraabdominal (pancreatic, biliary, C diff), bacteremia, with UTI and Pneumonia less likely given normal UA and CXR.
Blood and urine cultures were obtained and he was admitted the MICU and was started on Daptomycin (cover VRE, MRSA), cefepime (GNR), and flagyl (anaerobes).
In addition Levophed was used acheive BP goals.
Until a source of infection could be identified, he was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics: Daptomycin (for possible VRE recurrence), cefepime/flagyl (for possible enteric pathogen), and PO vanco (for possible persistent c diff).
The tagged WBC scan showed uptake in a fluid collection in the left paracolic gutter and a drain was placed in the fluid collection which returned fluid with gram positive rods identified as lactobacillus.
His antibiotics were narrowed to Augmentin, Vancomycin PO was maintained to cover for incompletly treated C. diff.
# History of PE: Coumadin started [**6-26**] with heparin drip to bridge.
Coumadin dose was eventually increased to Coumadin 3 mg by mouth daily but remained subtherapeutic at 1.5 on the morning of discharge.
He was transitioned from Heparin to Lovenox on the day of discharge.
Patient was discharged on Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg by mouth twice a day, which has been a stable dose for several days now, but, of note, was lower than his home dose of 50 mg twice a day.
This responded to intravenous fluids and was resolved by time of discharged.
His home dose of Lisinopril was held throughout the hospital course in order to prevent potential worsening of his renal failure.
# Hyponatremia: Sodium was 129 on admission.
Patient responded to intravenous fluids.
His Trazodone was held during his hospital stay.
