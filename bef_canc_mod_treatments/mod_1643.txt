Following chest tube removal, there is no definite evidence of pneumothorax.
The combined findings of an intraepidermal pustule, dyskeratosis, and dermal eosinophils favors a pustular drug eruption or acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP).

She was treated with vanc and zosyn at an outside hosptial for possible hospital acquired pneumonia based on CXR.
Her rash was felt to be related to a drug reaction and despite removing the most likely offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**] (zosyn) her respiratory status worsened and she was treated with IV steroids.
As patient had worsening hypoxia and increase in interstitial process seen on interval Chest CTs despite antibacterial and antiviral therapy a bronchoscopy was preformed which did not show evidence of bacterial infection.
The patient was started again on IV steroids and a lung biopsy by VATS preformed for evaluation of her lung process.
The patient improved with steroids after a total of three trips to the ICU for respiratory distress.
She was transitioned to PO steroids and had marked improvement in her oxygenation and rash.
This occured approx 10 days after completing a course of vanc/zosyn for a hospital acquirred pneumonia during a previous admission.
Patient did recieve this medication prior to transfer from the OSH complicating the evolution of her drug rash.
IgG was positive and IgM for viracella was positive as well, patient recieved a 7 day course of acyclovir while her pulmonary process was evaluated out of convern for a zoster pneumonitis.
The patient ultimately recieved 5 days of IV solumedrol prior to being converted to 60 mg prednisone with marked improvement in her rash.
# Acute on Chronic Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia:  prior to discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] in mid [**2103-11-8**] the patient developed respiratory distress and found to have a presumed multifocal pneumonia and was treated with vanc/zosyn for likely healthcare associated pneumonia.
Prior to this procedure, which was preformed in the ICU, the patient developed stridor and was started on solumedrol.
As her interval chest imgaging continued to show worsening of her inflammatory process with steroids a VATS procedure for biopsy was preformed.
The decision was made to continue steroids as infectious processes for her lung pathology were excluded by multiple cultures and serologies.
She improved dramatically with this treatment and was no longer hypoxic.
She had PFTs which showed a restrictive pattern and the patient was discharged on 60 mg prednisone daily, bactrim ppx, vitamin D and Calcium for a steroid course to be determined by outpatient pulmonology.
# Acute on chronic renal failure:  patient had rise in her creatinine to 1.8 over the course of her stay, renal ultrasound was normal and patient responded to albumin challenge.
# Hypercarbic failure:  Post VATS procedure and extubation the patient was noted to be hypercarbic with a pH of 7.19.
She was given nystatin oral rinse without response adn was therefore treated with a 7 day course of oral fluconazole to be completed as an outpatient.
# Leg Swelling:  felt to be secondary to hepatic chirrosis and vascular congestion, but patient was having improvement with diuresis with lasix.
Was discharged on 80 mg lasix and 25 mg spirinolactone daily.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Patient is a full code confirmed on this admission -Patient will need to undergo allergy testing 1-2 months after resolution of her acute illness as the specific [**Doctor Last Name 360**] has yet to be identified and carrying unconfirmed allergies to such broad spectrum antibiotics would severely limit future antibiotic regimens.

We are not sure which antibiotic caused this as you were exposed to several including:  Vancomycin, zosyn, meropenem and azithromycin.
This rash improved with topical creams and systemic steroids.
You recieved antibiotics at the outside hospital that may have contributed to the worsening of your rash and upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] these were changed and you continued to be treated for a bacterial pneumonia.
Despite antibiotics your breathing and oxygenation actually got worse and you were seen by our pulmonologists who felt that your rash and breathing could have been caused by a severe case of chicken pox, you were treated for this but ultimately this was not felt to be the cause of your sypmtoms.
A CT scan of your chest showed a large amount of inflammation in your lungs that despite steroids and antibiotics got worse on a repeat scan two days later.
You were brought to the ICU for a procedure called a bronchoscopy and cultures were sent from this material which were negative.
You tolerated the procedure well, but were slow to wake up so you were sent to the ICU for monitoring overnight.
Both of these processes are treated with steroids and you improved greatly with steroids while in the hospital.
You were discharged on steroids and will follow up with our pulmonologists in a few weeks to determine the course of treatment.
You will be discharged home on prednisone which is a steroid.
As you will be on this medication for several weeks you will need to take a medication called bactrim daily to prevent infections, vitamin D and calcium to prevent osteoperosis.
You have a fungal infeciton in your mouth from these steroids that you will treat with a medication called fluconazole for the next 7 days.
The following changes were made to your medications: -START Fluconazole 200 mg daily for 6 more days -START Prednisone 60 mg daily -START Vitamin D/Calcium supplement daily -START Bactrim SS 1 tablet daily -START Lasix 80 mg daily -START Spironolactone 25 mg daily -START Albuterol 2 puffs every 6 hours as needed for wheezing -START Moisturizing lotion daily  -CONTINUE Lactulose 30 ml twice daily -CONTINUE Rifaximin 550 mg twice daily -CONTINUE Pantoprazole 50 mg daily  -CONTINUE  Followup Instructions: Name: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],[**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Address: 99 [**Location (un) **] STRAITS, [**Hospital1 **],[**Numeric Identifier 19665**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 72602**] *It is recommended that you see your primary care doctor within one week.
