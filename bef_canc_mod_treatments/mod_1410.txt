Right thyroid cyst as described above.
The thyroid gland extends into the superior mediastinum, resulting in mass effect on the great vessels, particularly the right brachiocephalic artery, left common carotid and subclavian arteries, and brachiocephalic veins.
Cardiomegaly, coronary artery calcifications, aortic valve and mitral valve calcifications, and aortic atherosclerosis.

Simulatenous pressure  measurement in the LV and aorta demonstrated a mean 39mmHg gradient.
We exchanged for a 8F sheath with a Amplatzer super stiff wire in LV and advanced a 20mm Tyshak 2 balloon.
Heparin was used for anticoagulation.
She did not get lasix given hypotension.
Pt felt symptomatically improved after being diuresed with 20mg IV Lasix but then dropped her SBPs to 70-80s.
While in the MICU, pt was started on a 5-day course of Azithromycin.
Given the high likelihood of the critical AS contributing to pt's fluid overload and resultant shortness of breath, pt was evaluated for AV repair, and decision was made to proceed with valvuloplasty (see above) In addition, given patient's pulmonary function tests, her outpatient COPD medications were discontinued.
Patient was discharged on 60 mg PO daily of standing Lasix and dose to be adjusted as needed by outpatient cardiologist.
# Critical aortic stenosis: TTE on [**3-18**] revealed worsening of her critical AS with a valve area of 0.5cm2.
Pt discussed options for treatment extensively with her family, primary cardiologist, and the team, and decision was made to proceed with valvoloplasty instead of aortic valve replacement given higher risks of morbidity and mortality with surgery and with the plan that if this failed to improve her symptoms she could still undergo AVR in the future.
Valvuloplasty was performed with cardiac cath.
Because of the critical aortic stenosis and preload dependence patient's outpatient ACE inhibitor was discontinued.
Patient was restarted on outpatient lasix dose.
Patient underwent pre-operative work-up including cardiac catherization, panorex etc, so should patient require surgery she will be able to get it in the future.
In the setting of possible AVR surgery, goiter was further evaluated by CT, and was found to extend into the mediastinum.
Thoracics was consulted per request by CT Surgery, and it was decided that pt could undergo future chest surgery if needed as the mass was not invading the aortic arch.
Pt also preferred not to pursue any surgical interventions for her goiter.
# Afib: Pt home coumadin 2 mg daily, except Sunday 3 mg. Coumadin initially held in the setting of pericath/valvuloplasty.
Patient was not reversed with vit K. Patient was started on low dose beta blocker.
Coumadin was held pre-operatively and discharged on previous coumadin regimen, with follow-up as outpt with her PCP/primary oncologist for dosing adjustment.
Patient was not adequately rate controlled however did not have room to increase her beta blocker given low heart rate.
# Hypotension: Pt was transiently hypotensive in ED and responded to a 500cc NS bolus.
Also hypotensive in the unit after diuresis with 20mg IV lasix.
ACEI was held in the unit secondary hypotension and was not restarted in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
Once hypotension resolved, was was restarted on low dose beta blocker for afib rate control .
# Osteoporosis: Pt continued on calcium, vitamin D and evista.
Medications on Admission: # enalapril 10 mg AM, 5 mg PM # lasix 20 mg 2X /week # ranitidine 150 [**Hospital1 **] # evista 60 daily # warfarin 2-3 mg daily # lovastatin 40 mg daily # os-cal 500 [**Hospital1 **] # tylenol 2 daily  Discharge Medications: 1.
