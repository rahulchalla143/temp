The procedure was explained to the patient.
TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the left brachial vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous access.
A peel-away sheath was then placed over a guidewire and a single lumen PICC line measuring 36 cm in length was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided single lumen PICC line placement via the left brachial venous approach.

A JP drain is seen within the right hemipelvis.
650 cc of Cysto-Conray contrast was administered via Foley catheter into the bladder under fluoroscopic guidance which demonstrates extravasation of contrast along the right superior aspect of the bladder.
Status post ileo-right colectomy and resection of part of the posterior bladder, now on postop day #10.
There is limited evaluation of solid organs without intravenous contrast; however, the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are unremarkable.
CT OF THE PELVIS: A foley catheter seen within the bladder.

Repair of perforated colon anastomosis.
She was taken to the operating room for treatment of this.
The abdomen was prepped with Betadine and draped sterilely in the usual fashion.
Indigo [**Male First Name (un) **] into the Foley catheter and this was leaking into the bladder.
This was closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl full thickness sutures and then reinforced with 2-0 Vicryl Lembert sutures.
The wound was packed with Kerlix and covered.
The ileostomy was opened in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 34393**] fashion with the electrocautery, everted and  sutured in place with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl such that the distal side was flat and the proximal side was everted.
Ileostomy bag was placed over this and dressings were placed on the wounds and the patient was awakened, taken back to the intensive care unit intubated in guarded condition.
Following an initial CT scan of the abdomen which demonstrated ascites and a likely leak at the site of her ileo-colonic anastomosis, she was volume resuscitated and antibiotic therapy was initiated.
She was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy, and underwent repair of an anastomosis leak at the site of her ileo-colonic anastomosis, repair of a bladder perforation, and creation of a diverting loop ileostomy (see Operative report for details).
She returned to the ICU post-operatively, was weaned from the ventilator over the next 24 hours, and extubated successfully.
She initially required pressors for blood pressure support, but these were weaned successfully as well.
Nutrition was consulted early on and she was started on supplements.
She was started on Meropenem and Caspofungin per ID recommendations for gram negative & positive organisms identified from abdominal wound culture.
A wound VAC was placed on her abdominal wound.
She is also on Metamucil wafers tid.
Because of her high output she has been given IV fluids for replacement; her labs have been followed closely and her electrolytes have been stable (see pertinent results).
She will also require follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Urology, in [**2-5**] weeks because of her bladder perforation; the 22 Fr Foley will remain in place until that time.
Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have recommended rehab stay; her family would like to take her home following her rehab stay.
