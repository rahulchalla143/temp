Medics noted him to be moving all extremities, without focal weakness and gave him 250 cc NS en route.
His systolics were 80-90's through the ED so given 2L IVF's with improvement to 110; but then dropped to 70's and so got 3rd and 4th L's of NS and RIJ placed, started on Levophed, on small dose before transfer 0.03 mcg/kg/min with improvement in SBP to 120's by transfer to MICU.

EXTREMITIES: +1 pitting edema rt leg up to knee.
MRSA BACTERMIA/SEPTIC SHOCK: In MICU, pt continued IVF's and pressors were eventually able to be weaned.
He was started on Vanc/Zosyn/Levaquin intially but transitioned to vancomycin alone after multiple blood cultures showed MRSA.
CT of abdomen revealed AAA graft in good condition.
Patient was continued on vancomycin for planned 6 week treatment.
Diuresis was reinstated upon return of baseline kidney function.
Arterial duplex showed evidence of PVD and vascular surgery felt that he may benefit from revascularization.
He was discharged on metoprolol succinate 100 daily and amiodarone 200 daily.
Coumadin 2.5 mg daily was started prior to discharge.
This is likely due to frequent phlebotomy and poor production due to inflammation and CKD.
