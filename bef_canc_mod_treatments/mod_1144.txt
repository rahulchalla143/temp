She was at rehab in [**Hospital1 **] on a course of Zosyn and JP drains to treat her abdominal abscess.
She was admitted to the MICU briefly to start heparin and to monitor her complicated course, and then transferred to the medical floors for further management.

UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Bilateral, chronic, internal jugular vein non-occlusive thrombus .
CT ABDOMEN & PELVIS: Drainage catheters unchanged in position.
Brief Hospital Course: 25 yo female with post ERCP pancreatitis complicated by abdominal abscess admitted for bilateral upper extremity DVTs and PE.
She was started on heparin and then transitioned to lovenox.
She stayed on lovenox during her hospital course because it would be easier to stop if she were to have any procedures regarding her abdominal abscess and JP drains.
On discharge, she will continue loveonox for 3 more weeks until her flouroquinalone/bactrim course is completed, in case she needs more procedures, and then she should be switched to coumadin after 3 weeks.
# ABDOMINAL FLUID COLLECTION - Patient came into hospital with 3 abdominal JP drains and course of Zosyn.
Surgery was consulted, and the thought was that there is no need for surgical intervention at this time.
Her JP drains were pulled by IR to optimize the efficacy of Bactrim because stenotrophamonas quickly becomes resistent and the JP drains are colonized.
Zosyn was discontinued and bactrim and ciprofloxacin were started per ID recs on [**2140-10-18**].
Pt would continue on bactrim/flouroquinolone for three weeeks, and follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from infectious disease and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from surgery in four weeks-- already scheduled.
Per ID recommendations, she would be on flagyl for 2 weeks after the Zosyn was stopped.
She was on lasix and her edema improved on the lower extremities.
She used lamb skin boots to protect heel and ambulation was encouraged.
