HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2-17**] given that she did not have any active surgical issues and required continued ventilator weaning.
Pulmonary:  On [**2-17**], the patient was received from the Surgical Service for ventilator weaning on pressure support ventilation.
She experienced intermittent apneic episodes when attempted on pressure support ventilation and was changed to either assist control or SIMV ventilation.
Attempts at weaning were continued and her tidal volumes on the ventilator were decreased to increase her pCO2 thereby facilitating further weaning.
Her sedation and pain relief were also lightened.
Throughout the hospital course between [**2-17**] and [**3-1**], she tolerated progressive trials of trach mask with periods of rest on pressure support and ventilation.
She was status post pleurodesis of the right lung and was noted during admission to have a small left pleural effusion which was not thought to be compromising in terms of her respiratory status.
The patient was also tried on a pesseymuir valve during Medical Intensive Care Unit hospitalization, but demonstrated very limited speech.
She was initially bolused with IV fluids and transiently required dopamine for pressure support.
An arterial line was placed for invasive blood pressure monitoring on arrival to the MICU.
Initially her episodes of hypertension were treated with fluid boluses, but later she was thought to be volume overloaded and was subsequently diuresed with a Lasix drip.
She required Levophed and Neo-Synephrine for pressure support, but was subsequently weaned off of these pressures on [**2-24**].
Lopressor was restarted and Norvasc was added for increased blood pressure control on [**3-1**] given the patient has an intolerance/allergy to ACE inhibitors.
Patient was also diuresed approximately 700 cc on [**2-28**] in the setting of her continued hypertension.
She was noted from her culture data to have Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter cloacae in her sputum culture from [**2-17**].
She was started on Vancomycin for coverage of the Staphylococcus aureus.
She was also noted to have a urinary tract infection with Enterobacter and was continued on treatment with Bactrim.
In addition, she was growing Bactrim-resistant Klebsiella from her urine culture from [**2-17**].
Zosyn was then started for coverage of both of these organisms.
Vancomycin was discontinued at this time.
Given that the patient had completed a seven-day course for tracheobronchitis.
An Infectious Disease consult was also requested for management of patient's complicated infections with multi-resistant organisms.
On [**2-24**], the patient became febrile and hypotensive; sputum again was sent, which subsequently grew Enterobacter despite treatment with Aztreonam.
Further recommendations were to begin new antibiotic coverage for tracheobronchitis/pneumonia only if the patient demonstrated a clinical decompensation.
The patient also received a five-day course of Ilotycin ophthalmic ointment for conjunctivitis and a five-day course of fluconazole for oral thrush.
On [**2-23**], she was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells for volume in the setting of hypotension and for a hematocrit of 23.0.
He indicated that no further chemotherapy would be an option at this time.
A Neurology consult on [**2-25**] to evaluate the prognosis of the polyneuropathy recommended supportive care as the only therapy.
As the patient's sedation was held, she demonstrated improved alertness and minimal improvement in her ability to move her extremities.
Tube feeds were initially held and then she was rechallenged with slower doses of tube feeds.
Renal:  The patient's creatinine increased transiently after diuresis on [**2-22**] to 2.0, but returned to baseline 1.0 by [**3-1**].
Access:  The patient had a right A-line which was placed on [**2-17**], this was discontinued on [**2-22**], and then restarted on [**2-23**].
A new right sided PICC was placed by Interventional Radiology on [**2-25**].
During multiple family meetings with [**Doctor Last Name **], he explicitly stated that his mother was to be given aggressive care and to be full code should she experience cardiac arrest, despite explanation Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) 15380**] prognosis for resuscitation was extremely poor.
