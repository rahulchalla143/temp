Admission Date:  [**2113-11-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2113-11-9**]   Service:  ACOVE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old male status post TVR and MVR with prolonged intubation postoperatively back in [**Month (only) **], rapid atrial fibrillation, history of loculated right-sided effusion (status post decortication), history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, history of right diaphragmatic history and history of colon cancer and history of prostate cancer who re-presents from [**Hospital 1319**] Hospital with worsening shortness of breath, which has been nonresponsive to Lasix and nebulizers.
The patient was subsequently started on Bactrim, however, continued to develop increased somnolence and occasional episodes of nausea and vomiting.
He was noted to have a hematocrit drop to 25 and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells in hopes of relieving the patient's dyspnea.
The patient was also given Lasix between transfusions.
On the date of admission, the patient was reportedly on five liters of nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 90%.
The patient was given additional Lasix and nebulizers without improvement of dyspnea.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was given 60 mg of Solu-Medrol and 1 gram of Ceftriaxone.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he was closely monitored, restarted on digoxin and Lopressor for rapid atrial fibrillation and given frequent chest Physical Therapy, incentive spirometry and suctioning.
He was tried on nasal CPAP, but did not tolerate this at night.
The patient was also volume resuscitated with intravenous fluids and given no steroids as there was no evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
The patient had trachea and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placed.
A VATS procedure was done for right-sided effusion and atelectasis as per operative note, which showed blood clot, which was removed.
A decortication was done and re-expansion of right lower lobe was observed.
Sputum grew out Serratia and the patient was given Levaquin and Ceftazidime.
Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone were discontinued since Serratia was sensitive to Levaquin.
The patient was started on Captopril, Lasix and digoxin with improvement of bilateral effusions.
It was thought he may have had Dressler's syndrome and steroid was added to his regimen at that time.
The patient was given intravenous Lopressor which decreased the rate in the Emergency Department, but resulted in low blood pressure, which responded to intravenous fluid boluses.
The patient's heart rate was controlled with beta-blockers, however, the patient continued to have intermittent hypertension, in which he was given IV fluid.
The patient completed a course of vancomycin and Zosyn for pneumonia with suspected Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus or other resistant organisms.
Psychiatric was consulted for anxiety at that time and the patient was started on Zyprexa which decreased his vent dependence.
The patient was finally discontinued from the vent and maintained on trachea mask.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was also notable for worsening drainage of wound from his VAT site and the patient was evaluated by Plastic Surgery who recommended conservative treatment.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2097**] with left main disease.
Prostate cancer, status post prostatectomy in [**2098**], status post penile implant.
Colon cancer, status post colectomy in [**2107**].
Status post ureteral stent and urostomy.
Catheterization on [**2113-7-11**]:  100% occlusion of the left main coronary artery, patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to left circumflex, patent right coronary artery stent, severe mitral regurgitation and moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (pressure 45/26).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives alone at home before surgery in [**2113-7-13**].
Electrocardiogram:  Atrial fibrillation, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V4 through V6 old and an Q in V1.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2113-11-6**] and his hypoxia resolved rather quickly with nebulizers, chest Physical Therapy and incentive spirometry and some gentle diuresis.
There was a question as to whether the shortness of breath was a combination of mucous plugging plus right hemidiaphragmatic injury, as well as a question of mild congestive heart failure.
The patient also was continued on a ten day course of Ceftriaxone and did well with this.
For his atrial fibrillation, the patient was continued on Lopressor and digoxin, as well as Coumadin.
The patient's stool was OB positive, however, after blood transfusion, the patient responded well and the hematocrit remained stable.
The patient's Zyprexa dose was decreased to 2.5 mg b.i.d.
The patient will need further Physical Therapy, as well as to complete six more days of a Ceftriaxone course and his Coumadin will also have to be more therapeutic in light of his atrial fibrillation, as well as his MVR and TVR.
