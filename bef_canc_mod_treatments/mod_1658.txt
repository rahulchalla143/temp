[**2117-3-27**] CT guided drainage : CT-guided placement of 10 French pigtail catheter into the right complex pleural air/fluid collection.
[**2117-4-14**] Fluoro for HD catheter: Successful placement of a tunneled hemodialysis access catheter through the left internal jugular vein approach.
[**2117-4-15**] CXR: : Compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new hemodialysis catheter over a left-sided approach.
He was admitted to the hospital and placed on broad spectrum antibiotics.
On [**2117-3-26**] he underwent a bronchoscopy to R/O bronchopleural fistula.
He subsequently had a pigtail catheter placed in his right pleural space for drainage but did not improve.
His oxygen requirements increased and he eventually was intubated and transferred to the ICU.
He was taken to the Operating Room on [**2117-3-29**] and underwent  a Bronchoscopy, and right thoracotomy, right middle lobectomy with intercostal muscle flap buttress and decortication for a bronchopleural fistula and empyema.
He tolerated the procedure well but required aggressive fluid resuscitation and pressors to maintain stable hemodynamics.
His post op course was complicated by prolonged intubation and acute kidney injury requiring CVVH on [**2117-4-2**] with a high creatinine of 6.4 and eventually hemodialysis.
His kidney function recovered a bit after 4 days to a creatinine of 2.5 but unfortunately it was short lived and hemodialysis was restarted and continues.
He had a tunnelled line placed on [**2117-4-14**] via the left IJ and undergoes dialysis every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
From a pulmonary standpoint, he was finally weaned and extubated on [**2117-4-12**] and currently undergoes vigorous pulmonary toilet and is able to cough up his secretions.
His chest tubes were removed 10 days post op and all of his intraop cultures were negative.
He still uses 1.5-2L nasal cannula oxygen to maintain saturations > 90%.
His nutrition requirements are currently given thru an NG tube (dobhoff) as well as through oral thin liquid and puree solid feeds.
Tube feeds will be stopped when nutrition requirements are met solely via an oral route.
The patient continues on hemodialysis for improvement of the acute kidney injury he sustained as above.
The patient will receive 6 days of ciprofloxacin to cover a possible urinary tract infection, although to date, urine culture remains NGTD, the patient is afebrile, and white count continues downtrending.
