Status post recent ileostomy takedown with right lateral abdominal wound and underlying subcutaneous fluid collection, which could be a postoperative seroma, given timeframe.
Right hemiabdominal enterocolonic anastomosis without definite evidence of leak.
The left-sided PICC line has been pulled back by a few centimeters and is now seen to terminate just below the level of the carina.
The present termination point corresponds to the mid portion of the SVC and excludes the possibility of mechanical contact with cardiac structures.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was taken to the operating room electively for ileostomy takedown and subsequently admitted to the surgical floor.
Intra-operatively extensive lysis of adhesions was performed to take down the Hartmans.
She tolerated the procedure well, was extubated and brought to the PACU in stable condition.
She was started on Clindamycin post operatively.
Patient was given IVF resuscitation with crystalloids and Albumin.
At this time she was on PCA for pain control and her abdominal incision dressings were dry.
On POD 2 and 3 she continued to have marginal but improved UOP and was given boluses intermittently and 1 unit of pRBCs for hct 22.3.
She was advanced in her diet and was switched to PO medications.
On POD 4 her wound developed some erythema and a few staples were removed and swab was done and small amount of fluid expressed.
At this time the clindamycin was stopped and she was started on Vancomycin and cefpodoxime.
Through POD 4 into 5 she had an acute increase in oxygen requirement that responded well to nebulizer treatment but in this setting her wound was noted to have more induration and most of the remaining staples were removed.
At this point her antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone.
She was placed on IV medications and was made NPO in this setting.
An ostomy appliance was placed over the old ileostomy site incision, which had the higher output compared to the midline incision.
A PICC line was placed on POD 6 and patient was started on TPN and kept NPO.
TID dry dressing changes continued to her surgical wound site and IV vancomycin and ceftriaxone continued for a total 7 day course to be completed [**2159-3-10**].
She went to rehab with ostomy appliance over fistula site for skin protection and dry antimicrobial packing in midline surgical incision.
