Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
If you were on a medication such as Coumadin (Warfarin), or Plavix (clopidogrel), or Aspirin, prior to your injury, you may safely resume taking this after obtaining approval from your Neurosurgeon.
