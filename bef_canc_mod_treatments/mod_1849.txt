Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted electively on [**2141-11-16**] for DCD renal tranplant.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
He was admitted to the SICU because he required BIPAP overnight for hypoxemia, but was weaned off by the morning.
He required hemodialysis on POD 0 for fluid overload, and he tolerated temoval of 1.5 L. Early in the am of POD2, the patient was found to be recovering well, with no need for hemodynamic or respiratory support.
He was placed on an insulin drip, which was weaned off the next day with the aid of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult and the administration of a strict fixed and sliding scale insulin regimen.
Based on this information and his past medical history of CABG and NSTEMI, a cardiology consult was obtained.
The cardiology staff recommended medical management considering his recent renal transplant; a contraindication to cardiac catherization.
The transplant nephrology staff was impressed with this finding, and suggested that the patient may not need outpatient dialysis.
In fact, they suggested that his residual volume overload could be treated with lasix instead of hemodialysis.
He was instructed to take Lasix 100mg PO BID on days he was not going to have dialysis.
By this time he had received medication and insulin teaching, and had received treatment and follow up recommendations from the cardiology staff.
His post operative pain is well controlled on oral medications.

This may have been due to a myocardial infarction, likely due to the strain on your heart during surgery.
The Cardiologists saw you and recommended medical management instead of cardiac cath, because of the risk of contrast damaging your new kidney.
Please take all of the medications prescribed to you exactly as they are written, and remember to avoid all over the counter medications, especially if the transplant team has not ok'd them first.
You will likely need HD for a short while until your new kidney is at full speed.
