He transiently improved following dialysis on [**8-24**], then declined again on [**8-26**].
Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was recently diagnosed with lumbar compression fractures, and started on Percocet on [**8-20**].
No other recent medication changes.
Per daughter, has been getting intermittent Lactulose at home.
* EMS called given depressed MS, and recorded vitals were 90/40, HR 56, RR 20, Sat 100% on room air, BS 209.
In the ED, BP dropped to 70/35 with HR 55, and patient was given Naloxone 0.4 mg IV X 1 with improvement in BP to 116/40 as well as significant improvement in mental status.
He received an additional dose, with similar improvements, and was subsequently started on a Naloxone drip 0.6 mg IV/hours.
IVF X 2 liters of NS given.
He was also given Kayexalate and Lactulose for hyperkalemia.
ESRD [**3-8**] IgA nephropathy on HD Tu, Th, Sat 2.
Diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids 10.
Status post herniorraphy 13.
Status post prostate surgery  Social History: Patient lives with his daughter [**Name (NI) **].
At baseline, he able to ambulate with a cane, feed himself, communicate appropriately.
Physical Exam: VITALS: BP 89/36 on Naloxone 0.6 mg/hour, HR 58, RR 16, Sat 100% on room air.
Patient does NOT require MRSA precautions.
Altered Mental Status: Following admission to the MICU, the patient was continued on a nalaxone drip given suspicion that his change in mental status was secondary to narcotic toxicity.
Given that his urinalysis was positive (culture pending at time of dictation), he received 3 days of ciprofloxacin for suspected urinary tract infection.
His ammonia was not significantly elevated on admission, however, he was continued on lactulose for a goal [**4-7**] bowel movements per day, given possible contributor of hepatic encephalopathy (at time of discharge, ammonia level was 33).
TSH was within normal limits; vitamin B12 was elevated.
It is recommended that the patient does NOT receive any narcotics for pain control.
Hypotension: The hypotension noted on admission improved following a Narcan drip and several boluses of fluid.
Sepsis was felt to be unlikely, and infectious work-up was carried out as above.
He tolerated dialysis well on [**2158-8-30**].
His [**2158-9-1**] dialysis session was limited by mild hypotension, likely due to the fact that he received nadolol prior to dialysis.
Cirrhosis w/grade III varices: The patient was continued on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy.
Nadolol should be dosed after dialysis.
Compression Fracture: The patient was recently diagnosed with compression fractures.
His narcotics were discontinued given concern for narcotic intoxication as the cause of his change in mental status/hypotension.
He was maintained on standing acetaminophen (<2g/day) and was started on a trial of SC Calcitonin for pain related to a compression fracture.
The etiology of this patient's compression fracture is unknown and will require outpatient workup.
He received Vit D and Calcium supplementation in house, but a bisphosphanate was not started given his known esophageal varices.
DM-II: The patient was written for a sliding scale > 200, but his blood sugars were generally well controlled with diet control.
The patient in encouraged to continue diet control and to continue monitoring with outpatient PCP.
Pancytopenia: Patient has a baseline pancytopenia (baseline hematocrit 33-35, plt 40-60, wbc [**3-10**].
His anemia is likely secondary to ESRD, for which he receives erythropoietin at dialysis.
