In general, the patient was awake and alert with a cervical soft collar in place.
She had several units of packed red blood cells during this admission, and her hematocrit did not bump appropriately at first.
The patient had a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy which again showed the same lesions but did not reveal any actively bleeding ulcers.
She was also started on Epoetin for the thought that she had a chronic anemia.
A Surgery consultation was obtained, and they deferred any surgical intervention and agreed with the plan as was proceeding.
