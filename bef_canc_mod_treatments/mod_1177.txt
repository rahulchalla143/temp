# Hypotension: Patient was monitored in the ICU and initially resuscitated with PRBCs given concern for gastrointestinal bleeding.
With stablization of her hematocrit, patient was then rescusitated with IVFs for hypotension thought to be related to hypovolemia in part from possible GIB vs dehydration from ETOH-induced diuresis and poor PO intake.
She was started on amlodipine and lisinopril with normalization of BPs.
She was hydrated with NS IVF and monitored.
Her Na normalized with  fluid restriction and was felt to be related to SIADH [**12-30**] pain.
# Macrocytic Anemia/Concern for gastrointestinal bleeding: Outpatient work-up has been consistent with anemia [**12-30**] alcohol use given macrocytosis not explained with folate, b12, nor pernicious anemia (IF antibody negative).
Initially blood work upon reaching the floor was singificant for a hct of 17.2, however this was determined to have been taken off a line with normal saline flushed into it.
# Humeral fracture: Humerus fracture s/p a fall.
Followed by orthopedics inhouse who recommended a sling and outpatient follow up.
Pain was managed with PO hydromorphone.
She responded to valium and ativan.
Acidosis improved with IVF hydration.
Admission UA showed 7 WBC in urine and leuk esterase +, but given that she had no symptoms a urine culture was added on, no antibiotics given initially.
She was treated briefly with Levofloxacin due to positive culture however this treatment was discontinued because patient was asymptomatic and all U/As were negative.
In the ICU, she was maintained on a CIWA scale and given IV thiamine and IV folate.

They also recommended pendulums as you've done in the hospital.
For pain, we are giving you a prescription for Dilaudid until you see your primary care doctor.
Your blood pressures later became very high while you were hospitalized so you were restarted on your Lisinopril and given a new medicine called Amlodipine for better control.
