Her labetalol was also increased from 300mg to 400mg TID.
Treatment was started with metronidazole and levofloxacin, as well as vancomycin as 1 blood culture was growing GPC pairs/clusters.

Her PD catheter was left in place as the patient refuses HD any longer than necessitated by the healing of her recent laparotomy (see prior d/c summaries).
