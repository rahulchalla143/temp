Recieved 250 bolus and dopamine gtt.
CAD - s/p cath [**2128-7-30**]:stenting of the RCA with 3 overlapping cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]  -[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] [**2128-8-11**]: rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the LAD/LCX.
PAF s/p VVI pacemaker 5.
of perirectal abscess s/p surgery  Social History: no hx of etoh or tobacco, lives at home alone, widower.
There is evidence of prior cardiac surgery but the prosthetic valves are not clearly defined.
There is also evidence of CABG procedure with some cardiovascular clips and sternal sutures noted.
Therefore he was intubated and remained intubated until [**11-18**] when he was successfully extubated/  The patient's respitary failure was though to be due to a combination of CHF, a large pleural effusion and possibly a PNA.
He was aggressively diuresed, and his plueral effusion was tapped and found to be transudative, and he was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics.
The IV antiobiotics were switched to PO levofloxacin.
He was started on dopamine and natrecor for diuresis and Lasix IV bolsues were added as needed.
As his urine output fell, he was started on a Lasix drip.
Once he was close to his dry weight, Natrecor was stopped and he was switched to PO Zaroxyln and Lasix prn.
He was eventually switched converted to standing po Bumex 2 mg po bid and achieved his ideal wt of 60 kg and remained stable.
Once pt was off dopamine tolerating BP, Toprol XL was started.
Lisinopril was re-started as well.
These medications were administered at bedtime since his SBP drops to 80's with these meds.
He was discharged with Toprol 12.5 mg po qhs, Lisinopril 1.25 mg po qhs, Bumex 2 mg po bid.
Pt is very sensitive to ACEI and drops his BP in 80's, so it is given at bedtime.
It is emphasized that his baseline BP is in the 80's-low 100's, and no medications should be held for SBP of high 80's or 90's.
Toprol and Lisinopril should be spaced 2 hr apart.
His ASA and plavix were continued and carvediol and lisinopril were initially held for low SBP.
As above, after diuresis and improved cardiac output, pt was started on Toprol and lisinopril.
Rhythm: Chronic afib s/p VVI pacer [**2128-8-12**].
Pt was initially started on digoxin for rate control while he was hypotensive and on dopamine gtt.
But it was switched to Toprol later for rate control.
Coumadin was held for thoracentesis but re-started.
He was initially continued on iron and folate, but the EPO was given 10,000 units qMWF which is half of what he was getting on last admission to keep his Hct stable.
Pt will be discharged with EPO 20,000 qMWF and Iron supplement.
His creatinine improved to his near baseline after aggressive diuresis to improved the cardiac output.
9.Mechanical valve: Pt was on Coumadin which was held initiallya and bridged with Heparin gtt for procedures.
Coumadin was re-started with goal of INR 2.5-3.5.
Pt responded well to prednisone 30 mg x 3 days.
Pt was given additional 15 mg x 3 days.
Gout flare may have been triggered by chronic mechanical hemolysis, chronic diuresis, and CRI.
FEN: Pt needs to be on 2gm sodium diet, cardiac diet, and fluid restriction of 1.5 L.  Pt needs to be weighed daily and be reported to MD if he has more than 1 kg of weight gain, so his medications could be adjusted.
