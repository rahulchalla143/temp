Admission Date:  [**2172-4-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-5-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-1-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain, dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intra-aortic balloon bump central line PA catheter arterial line intubation  History of Present Illness: This is a 55 YOM with PMHX significant for CAD, HTN, smoking, hyperlipidemia who presents in shock.
Per his family he had onset of abdominal pain/indigestion (similar to 1st ACS presentation).
They are unaware of the nature of the pain or if he had any other symptoms including fevers, chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, or dysuria.
Their exam noted mild tenderness in LLQ and normal cardipulmonary exam aside from tachycardia.He was found to have an elevated WBC count and treated with levo/flagyl empirically for presumed diverticulitis.
He was given a total of 25 mg IV diltiazem, 30 mg po, atenolol 50 mg po.
He was then intubated and started on dopamine.
He then also started on levophed and given a total of 8L of NS.
Pertinent Results: Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2-23**] anatomy as follows:  1.
There was no gradient across the aortic valve on pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle.
The nasogastric tube projects only immediately beyond the hemidiaphragms and a side hole is within the distal esophagus.
Advancing the tube is recommended into the stomach.
There is dense material throughout the gallbladder, which is nondistended, which may represent sludge, and less intravenous contrast was administered recently, which could suggest vicarious excretion.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter in the bladder.
He initially required multiple pressors to support his blood pressure.
His hemodynamics were monitored with a PA catheter and he required an intra-aortic balloon pump to be placed.
Soon after the IABP was placed his cardiac indices improved and he was weaned off of pressor support and the IABP was removed.
On admission, he was started empirically on vanc/levo/flagyl for presumed sepsis.
More likely was cardiogenic shock in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR and many nodal blocking agents given at OSH.
A right-heart catheter was placed.
He required pressors to maintain MAPs >65.
He was placed on levophed and dobutamine drips transiently.
He eventually improved on the IABP which allowed weaning off the pressors.
His IABP was removed again and the patient remained hemodynamically stable off pressors and mechanical support and could be extubated.
He was discharged on ASA 81, BB, Lasix, Spironolactone and Dig (also for Afib, see below).
He should weigh himself daily and follow a sodium restricted diet.
He was started on vanco/levo/flagyl empirically.
Patient was intubated at OSH and remained intubated in the CCU.
Once his hemodynamics improved and he was maintaining his BP without pharmacologic support he was given boluses of IV lasix for diuresis.
His respiratory status improved with diuresis and he was successfully extubated.
4) CAD: Stent to OM in [**2168**].
DC cardiovesion was attempted several times without success in addition to medical management including frequent IV metoprolol doses.
He was eventually stabilized on a regimen of Amiodarone, metoprolol, and Digoxin.
Anticoagulation was initiated transiently with a heparin drip and with coumadin 5mg qHS towards his discharge.
Towards the end of his hospital stay, coumadin was started for anticoagulation for Afib.
11) Alcohol use: H/o [**12-24**] bottle of whiskey until recently.

Toprol XL 100 mg Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr Sig: Three (3) Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr PO once a day: Start on [**2172-5-13**].
Cardiomyopathy with cardiogenic shock and CHF (EF initially 15%, then up to 30%), status post intubation and inotropic pressure support and intraaortic balloon pump 2.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requiring DC cardioversion, on coumadin 6.
CAD s/p stent in [**2168**] 8.
You have been intubated and sedated and received intravenous medications to keep your blood pressure and circulation stable.
You have been started on several new oral medications: Amiodarone, Digoxin and Coumadin (a blood thinner) for anticoagulation and rate control for a heart rhythm condition called atrial fibrillation; blood pressure and heart failure medications (lisinopril, spironolactone, toprol XL, lasix).
Please take all medications as prescribed and discontinue your previous oral medications.
You should follow a low sodium diet and restrict your fluid intake to 1.5 liters per day.
Please take all your medications as directed.
The so called INR should be checked which is a lab test to determine if your anticoagulation (blood thinning) on coumadin is accurate.
