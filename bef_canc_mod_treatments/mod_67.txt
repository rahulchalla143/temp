Admission Date:  [**2134-3-2**]       Discharge Date: [**2134-3-16**]   Service:  HISTORY:  This is an 84-year-old right handed man with mild dysplasia with thrombocytopenia formerly on steroids, hypertension, intermittent claudication of the right calf, idiopathic nephropathy now presents with two weeks of symptoms culminating to progressive weakness in the right lower extremity over the last three days.
He needed to use his cane to ambulate.
He was admitted with rather rapidly progressive painful ascending, asymmetrical neuropathy with weakness.
His Cerebrospinal fluid protein was 157, his glucose was 65, four white cells and 75% lymphs.
We started on plasmapheresis and placed a consult to the Transfusion Service.
On [**2134-3-4**] he did have an episode of hypotension with lightheadedness on the day prior during his phoresis however, this responded well to normal saline bolus and he did well after holding his Lisinopril, we changed his Atenolol to Metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day and watched the blood pressure closely.
On the 28th he was on Morphine 3 to 4 mg q four hours for pain and also increased his Gabapentin for his neuropathic pain.
Pain was responding to Morphine and his weakness was somewhat improving.
We had arranged emergent plasmapheresis that night and used Dopamine for blood pressure support.
In the literature there has been described acute renal failure due to severe Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome and this was the likely etiology for this.
He was improving on the phoresis and he continued for five total treatments.
He had no problems with his respiratory status however, he still needed pressors to help with his pressure.
We had some problems at first controlling his pain since he was requiring Dilaudid and we consulted the Pain Service.
Percocet and this worked well to control his pain.
They noted a recent downward trend of his platelets were 19 on [**3-13**] when he was seen which was down from 20 on the 4th, down from 26 also on the 4th, 23 on the 3rd, 32 on the 2nd, 35 on [**2134-3-9**], 39 on [**3-8**] and 57 on [**2134-3-8**] despite therapeutic phoresis.
they felt that his ongoing anemia may be in part due to recurrence of ITP verses medication induced as Lisinopril has been indicative of cause of thrombocytopenia however, the [**Doctor Last Name 360**] is not new.
They told us to check Heparin induced thrombocytopenia antibiotics and this is pending at the time of discharge.
They felt we should start 1 mg per kg of Prednisone q day and start at 60 mg p.o.
They also felt we should use Sulfonate for gastrointestinal prophylaxis as we should avoid PPI as he has had a history of PPI related thrombocytopenia.
In the days prior to discharge he again did well, he maintained stable on steroids and his strength somewhat returned.
We continued all meds as previous and continued checking vital capacities and these were all normal.
The cerebrospinal fluid protein remained elevated at 117 and his glucose was 69.
Timolol 8.5% drops one drop twice a day.
Dulcosate sodium 100 mg p.o.
Bisacodyl 10 mg p.o.
Surcifate 1 gram tablet, one p.o.
Atenolol 25 mg one p.o.
Terazosin 2 mg two tablets q h.s.
Lisinopril 10 mg three tablets p.o.
Prednisone 60 mg p.o.
Gabapentin 300 mg two capsules three times a day.
Percocet one to two tablets p.o.q  4 to 6 hours.
