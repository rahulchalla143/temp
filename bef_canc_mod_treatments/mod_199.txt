History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 15633**] is a 79 yo female with a complex medical history including severe aortic stenosis, s/p bioprosthetic AVR/CABG([**2118**]-F [**Doctor Last Name **]) now with bioprosthetic restenosis and recurrent systolic heart failure requiring multiple hospitalizations, Patient also s/p CABG x1([**2118**]) and PCI-LAD([**2119**]).
She was treated with IV Lasix and a repeat TTE showed progression of the restenosis of her bioprosthetic valve.
At that point her beta-blocker was increased to carvedilol 25 mg twice a day, her Diovan was decreased from 120 mg twice a day to 120 mg once a day and diltiazem XR was started.
She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for surgical evaluation.
The patient refused surgery at that time.
Her dose of lasix was increased.
She was subsequently admitted to CCU with congestive heart failure placed on BiPap and Lasix gtt.
Cardiac surgery was reconsulted for surgical evaluation Cardiac Echocardiogram: [**2125-10-16**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.

A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2125-10-22**] where the she underwent a redo sternotomy with a Bentall procedure with a 21 mm [**Company 1543**] Freestyle    bioprosthesis with coronary button reimplantation, as well as redo coronary artery bypass grafting with reverse saphenous vein graft from the [**Company 1543**] Freestyle graft to the existing reverse saphenous vein graft to the distal right coronary artery.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU on Epinephrine, Neo-Synephrine, Propofol and Dobutamine in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
She had been doing well on [**2125-10-24**] and had her chest tube removed earlier in the day when she suddenly had arrhythmia issues and became hypotensive.
She had multiple clots evacuated and a repair for bleeding coming from a hole in the vein graft proximally.
A sheet of Cormatrix was used to cover the vein graft repair and 2 chest tubes were placed.
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the ICU in stable condition.
She did go into rapid atrial fibrillation post operatively and was bolused with Amiodarone and loaded with a drip.
She was started on Coreg and Amiodarone was changed to Maltaq and she was in sinus rhythm under her AV pacing at the time of discharge.
She was on Coumadin preoperatively for atrial fibrillation but this was held per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] due to post operative bleeding.
Resumption of Coumadin is to be decided at a later date.
Pacing wires were discontinued without complication and permanent pacemaker was interrogated by EP.
She was weaned slowly from the ventilator with copious secretions initially.
Once CVVH was started and fluid was removed she was able to be extubated on [**2125-11-4**] without complications.
She was started on Vancomycin/Zosyn while awaiting sputum cultures and these were discontinued once cultures came back negative.
She was cleared by speech and swallow for a regular diet with thin liquids at discharge.
It was thought that her renal failure was a combination of acute tubular necrosis and renal hypoperfusion in the setting of decompensated congestive heart failure causing poor forward flow.
CVVH was started for volume removal and she tolerated a negative fluid balance.
She was eventually weaned off CVVH and transitioned to HD.
She was producing adequate urine with stable electrolytes and the HD was discontinued at the time of discharge and her HD line was pulled.
Renal recommended no standing Lasix dose and follow up Friday [**11-16**] with renal labs.
Foley was reinserted for urinary retention and she will be discharged with Foley catheter in place.
The infectious disease team was consulted and recommended Ciprofloxacin for a 14 day course from [**11-5**] (Blood cultures negative x 2 on [**11-5**]) Ciprofloxacin is to be continued until [**2125-11-19**].
By the time of discharge on POD the patient was ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
