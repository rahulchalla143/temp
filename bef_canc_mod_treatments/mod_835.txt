He was placed transiently on a dopamine drip to maintain blood pressure.
He was intubated and brought to the OR, where pericardiocentesis and creation of a pericardial window were undertaken.
Close to 1 L of bloody pericardial fluid was removed, and L pleural and pericardial drainage tubes were placed.
Dopamine drip was weaned, pt was extubated, and pt recovered well with no further reaccumulation of fluid.
The last drain was removed on [**11-23**].
Given the concomitant presence of a pulmonary embolus (see below) and lymphadenopathy on CT, a tissue diagnosis is necessary.
Pt was placed on a heparin drip and had no further complication, with good oxygen saturation.
The initiation of coumadin was deferred until after pt's definitive procedure for tissue diagnosis, and he will follow up as an outpatient for management of his coumadin.
The presence of both PE and pericardial effusion placed malignancy higher on the differential.
ENT was curbsided, and ciprofloxacin drops were recommended, as well as po Augmentin, both for 10 day course.
Pt was placed on fluid restriction and was advised to continue this at home.
Pt was placed on oxycodone and tylenol for control of back pain.
His hydrochlorothiazide was held in the hospital and then was restarted at discharge.
Pt also started on Toprol XL with good BP control.
FEN/GI - Pt was placed on a cardiac/heart healthy diet on transfer to the floor, with fluid restriction due to hyponatremia.
