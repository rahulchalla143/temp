ET tube in standard placement.
Right subclavian line ends in the upper SVC and a nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
The nasogastric tube has been removed in the interval, the PICC line has been slightly advanced, the tip now projects over the lower SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan:  IMPRESSION: [**Age over 90 **]F with PMH significant for dementia, chronic diastolic CHF presenting with cough, lethargy and evidence of acute hypercarbic-hypoxic respiratory distress requiring intubation, initially thought to be neuromuscular in origin with potentiating URI, on IVIG, s/p extubation and transfer to medicine floor.
Acute respiratory failure/Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure - The patient was initially intubated given concerns for neuromuscular respiratory failure given a prior diagnoses of at least partial ptosis and a positive anti-cholinesterase antibody on outpatient laboratory studies.
She was evaluated by Neurology and trialed on cholinesterase inhibitor therapy (pyridostigmine) with IVIG infusion with minimal improvement in her NIFs and respiratory status.
She was also diuresed with Lasix to promote a negative fluid balance and she showed no signs of infectious concerns.
She tolerated intermittent transition to pressure support ventilation but overall failed to show marked improvement and tracheostomy was considered.
On [**2188-4-3**], she was successfully extubated and was weaned to an oxygen facemask and then nasal cannula for supplemental oxygen.
She will complete a pyridostigmine taper.
She remains on PO Lasix at this time, slightly reduced from her home dose and has remained on room air, appears euvolemic, without evidence of pulm edema.
Given recent decreased PO intake, would continue the current dose of 40mg po daily and monitor clinically and titrate Lasix dose appropriately.
## h/o Stroke - on Plavix at baseline given severe ASA allergy.
She was also on a statin, which was held at one point due to concern for neuromusclar disease, but can be restarted now that she is stable.
## Neuromuscular disorder NOS - this diagnosis is controversial, as the neurology consult team thinks that it is unlikely but the ICU felt it warranted consideration and treatment; Pyridostigmine given empirically.
She will continue on her current dose of 60mg po daily x 1 day ([**4-24**]), followed by 30mg po daily x 3 days, and finally 15mg po daily x 3 days On D/C, they recommended that we wean it, decreasing interval from QID to TID then.
2nd stool sample on [**4-10**] positive for C. diff, started on PO Flagyl.
She will need to complete a 14 day course of flagyl ending on [**2188-4-25**].
Prophylaxis: Heparin sub-Q 5000 Units TID for VTE prophylaxis.
Nutrition:  Pt was on tube feeds initially while intubated.
She was seen by Speech and Swallow and cleared for PO intake, with thin liquids, ground solids, and 1:1 supervision.
