)Respiratory Intubation/Extubation   History of Present Illness: 69yo woman with PMH as below which includes CAD s/p MI/CABG, A-fib on coumadin who presented to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital on [**2128-2-13**] with fever, shortness of breath and cough.
She was diagnosed with a LLL pneumonia and initially treated with Ceftriaxone and Azithro.
Her respiratory status worsened, she was transferred to their ICU and intubated for respiratory failure.
She was continued on abx and given stress dose steroids given her chronic Prednisone for RA.
She had been restarted on Heparin after her INR on [**2-17**] was 1.2.
ICU course was remarkable for episodes of hypertension requiring labetalol and nitroglycerin gtts.
She had been started on ceftriaxone/Vancomycin and changed to Ceftazidime for concerns of VAP.
Antibiotics were altered on [**3-2**] from Vanco to linezolid given the continued fevers and antibiotic resistance profile of the enterococcus.
There had been concern for possible CHF as the cause of her declining respiratory status on the floor and was diuresed with 20mg iv furosemide x 2 on [**3-2**] and 20mg iv furosemide x 1 on [**3-1**].
Her urine output was reported to be 500cc to the last dose of furosemide on [**3-2**].
CAD s/p MIx2, s/p CABG in [**2115**] 2.
A-fib on Coumadin 3.
Rheumatoid arthritis on MTX and prednisone s/p Remicade therapy in past, osteoarthritis 4.

Reports:  CXR [**2-23**] 1) Cuff of endotracheal tube is overdistended and tip of vascular catheter abuts the apparent lateral wall of the superior vena cava.
2) Lingular and left lower lobe consolidation suggestive of pneumonia  CXR [**3-3**] SEMI-UPRIGHT AP CHEST: The patient is post median sternotomy.
The NG tube is unchanged.
[**3-9**] C-Spine No fracture or malalignment is identified of the cervical spine.
IVC GRAM/FILTER [**3-14**] Successful placement of retrievable recovery IVC filter inferior to the level of the renal veins via right common femoral access  CT ABD W&W/O C; CT PELVIS W&W/O C [**3-14**] ) A large, extraperitoneal heterogeneous mass representing a hematoma is seen arising from the left rectus abdominis muscle posteriorly.
HTN: The patient remained fairly hypertensive following admission, and at one point required a NTG and then labetolol drip.
Rheum: Hydrocortisone was initially started, then changed to Prednisone as the patient was taking prior to admission.
Course on Floor: [**0-0-0**]  In summary, this is a 69yo female with hx of respiratory failure in the MICU, CAD, Afib( was on Coumadin), RA, HTN, and r adrenal adenoma presents who from OSH w/ PNA, supratherapeutic INR, and abdominal mass concerning for rectus sheath hematoma.
Fever: Despite current negative sputum cx, negative BCX, and therapy w/ ceftaz and vanc, patient continued to spike fever.
Try and avoid turning patient on right side as hematoma puts pressure on IVC.
On [**2128-3-2**] patient was given dose of dilaudid for pain.
Rheum: C/w maintenance prednisone for treatment of RA during her hospital course.
FEN: During her hospital course tube feeds were increased to 45cc/hr.
Given that the patient received pain meds the night of [**2128-3-2**], it was hypothesized that this reduced her respiratory effort.
Patient received BIPAP and improved.
The patient was immediately started on Heparin 600u IV q hour.
Throughout the hospital course the patient's respiratory status continued to improve and the patient was weaned off nasal canula.
It was suggested that the patient avoid opiates and benzodiazepines and obtain an MRI to rule out stroke.
The patient was placed in a soft [**Location (un) 2848**] J Collar and MRI of the Cervical Spine was ordered in order to rule of spinal cord compression.
Neurology felt that patient did not require further spinal cord imaging.
On [**2128-3-11**] the patient was started on Zoloft after being discontinued per earlier neurology recs for concern about serotonin syndrome.
On [**3-2**] patient received 20mg lasix x2 and breathing status improved.
Patient's afib controlled on coumadin, she was started on heparin and coumadin overlap on [**3-9**].
On [**2128-3-5**] patient was restarted on Ceftazadime which was discontinued on [**2128-3-3**] and also started on Flagyl for prophalaxysis against aspiration PNA.
Endocarditis was also considered as a cause but ruled out by echo on [**2128-3-3**].
On [**3-7**] she had a positive UA and as a result the foley catheter was changed and UA repeated, which was negative.
However, blood cultures were collected and the patient was started on Flagyl and levofloxacin.
Throughout her hospital course HCT stabalized and Coumadin was restarted for proph against AFIB.
HTN: Patient has labile HTN being controlled on HCTZ, Metropolol and Captopril.
Rheum: Patient continued on prednisone.

Her current problems include, likely resolving ICU neuropathy with  mental status change, fevers, compromised respiratory status from resolved LLL PNA and bilateral PEs for which she was on heparin between [**Date range (1) 50572**], and labile HTN.
She has a resolving abdominal hematoma, which again enlarged during her course of heparin between [**Date range (1) 50572**].
Patient was given haldol prn overnight for hallucinations and is now on standing seroquel.
3.ID: +UA, UCx for g- rods while in MICU, now on IV Levofloxacin.
If she has difficulty breathing consider one time lasix 20mg.
No Coumadin for rate controlled afib.
While no DVTs or Pelvic thrombosis were noted on abd/pel CT or lenis, IVC filter placed and patient now off heparin and coumadin.
Patient s/p transufsion for HCT drop while in MICU.
HTN: C/w Lopressor, increase as tolerated.
Resp: Sat'ing well on room air, weaned slowly from oxygen, has history of bilateral PE was on heparin/coumading, now with IVC filter secondary to HCT drop and abdominal hematoma.
CXR on [**3-18**] revealed LLL PNA vs atelectasis slightly increased from prior studies.
Access: Central line removed in MICU, has PICC.
