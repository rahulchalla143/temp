course c/b pericarditis and radiation pneumonitis and esophageal stricture,  requiring G-tube placement.
Prior cholecystectomy with unchanged mild extrahepatic biliary dilation likely related to postcholecystectomy state.
He was also started on prednisone 60 mg daily steroid burst for presumed COPD exacerbation.
He had systolic blood pressure in 90s on admission which responded to three liters of normal saline bolus.
