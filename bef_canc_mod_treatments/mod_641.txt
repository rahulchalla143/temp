The patient has a significant history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, mitral valve regurgitation, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke, as well as a history of rectal cancer (status post resection and colostomy).
The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for definitive treatment prior to mitral valve replacement.
Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery bypass graft and mitral valve disease.
History of burns as a child; he has had bilateral upper extremity with skin grafting.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Home medications included Zocor, Elavil, Synthroid, Lasix, potassium chloride, Colace, lactulose, amiodarone, Protonix, allopurinol, and captopril.
Shortly following angiography to fully study the extent of his basilar artery aneurysm on hospital day two, the patient experienced an episode of acute respiratory distress requiring emergency reintubation and was subsequently transferred to the Coronary Care Unit on [**2179-4-17**].
An Infectious Disease consultation was obtained given reports of a positive catheter tip culture at [**Hospital6 2561**] which reportedly demonstrated Pseudomonas and Escherichia coli, as well as a reported recent history of Clostridium difficile colitis.
Although no evidence of bacteremia was noted at that time, the patient was prophylactically begun on perioperative Flagyl for Clostridium difficile prophylaxis beginning on [**2179-4-19**].
40% to 50% serial stenoses in the proximal and medial portions of the left anterior descending artery were noted.
Following stabilization of the patient's respiratory status, extensive conversations were held with the patient and his family with regard to the risks of additional cardiac surgery given his fusiform basilar artery aneurysm.
Following extensive discussions surrounding the risks of potential stroke during the course of his procedure, the patient and his family agreed to mitral valve replacement on [**4-26**], and the patient was subsequently scheduled for a mitral valve replacement on [**2179-4-27**].
On [**4-27**], the patient underwent a right thoracotomy with mitral valve replacement with a 31 Mosaic porcine valve.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with a bypass time of 100 minutes.
Lines placed included a right radial arterial line, a right internal jugular with a Swan-Ganz catheter.
Two atrial wires were placed and two right pleural tubes were additionally placed during the course of the procedure.
Drips on transfer included Milrinone and Levophed.
The patient was initially weaned and extubated shortly following his procedure; however, he required reintubation for respiratory distress and atrial fibrillation on postoperative day one.
An Infectious Disease consultation obtained at that time recommended starting the patient on empiric Zosyn coverage in addition to his standing Flagyl dosage.
Further consultation with Pulmonary Medicine resulted in continued aggressive diuresis of the patient with good effect.
Intermittent temperature spikes resulted in the addition of vancomycin to the patient's antibiotic regimen with continued aggressive respiratory care.
The patient demonstrated gradual improvement in his respiratory status with aggressive diuresis and continued antibiotic therapy through [**5-6**], at which point he was successfully extubated while in the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit.
Extensive review by Physical Therapy recommended the patient for rehabilitation placement following discharge.
On the floor, the patient continued to demonstrate a gradually improving clinical examination with continued aggressive diuresis.
On postoperative day 17 ([**2179-5-14**]), the patient was being planned for transfer to rehabilitation when he demonstrated an episode of tachypnea with associated diaphoresis.
The patient was noted to demonstrate increasing respiratory status once again with aggressive diuresis and was subsequently cleared for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on [**2179-5-15**].
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility for further care and management with instructions for followup.
