He underwent ERCP and stent placement at each admission for possible stricture at site of anastomosis.
He presented for initiation of infergen/ribavirin therapy for recurrent hepatitis C. .
Had been stable on Wellbutrin and Lithium since [**29**] and 93 respectively, except for during a trial of IFN therapy in [**2138**] where hospitalization was required.
Developed hepatic encephalopathy in [**2142**] requiring hospitalization at [**Hospital1 2025**], started on lactulose with good effect.
Past treatments include peg interferon and ribavirin in [**2139**].

RECURRENT HEPATITIS C S/P OLT- transaminitis was likely secondary to recurrent infection with HCV.
Pt started treatement with infergen and ribavirin on [**5-12**] but viral loads did not seem to respond to this therapy.
Pt had abdominal imaging including doppler U/S to ensure graft patency which was normal as well as KUB to visualize correct placement of prior biliary stent via ERCP, and the stent was confirmed to be in the correct position in the RUQ.
However, bilirubin  and transaminases continued to rise.
Code blue was called for airway protection and pt was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring (see below).
In the ICU, Since Cellcept can potentially interact with Colesevelam, Colesevelam was discontinued.
Additionally, Cellcept was discontinued [**5-20**].
Sirolimus 2mg PO daily was initiated on [**5-21**] per liver recommendations, as pt was no longer on tacrolimus (since [**5-18**]) Lactulose and rifaximin were continued.
Pt was on prophylactic Bactrim, however this was held due to patient's decreasing renal function (see below).
Final pathology demonstrated findings consistent with early recurrent hepatitis C.  Upon the patient's return to the floor, his bilirubins began to slowly trend downward, but the patient's alkphos continued to rise, raising concern for an ongoing acute process, such as fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (FCH).
At this time it was determined that the patient should reach equilibrium levels on his keppra and that his creatinine should be allowed to return to baseline prior to initiating any infergen and ribavirin therapy again.
On [**5-31**] he was restarted on his rapamune at 3mg daily, but his tacrolimus remained held.
On discharge, he was to follow up as an outpatient on [**6-3**] and [**6-6**] for monitoring of his liver functions and drug levels, at which time a future date for inpatient antiviral therapy will be decided upon.
Immediate tx for pt's seizure included Keppra (loading dose) and Ativan; however, Ativan may be responsible (paradoxically) for agitation seen well after post-ictal period had passed.
Keppra was started and has been continued for SZ prophylaxis according to neurology recommendations.
Empiric antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin) and Acyclovir were begun as well.
Antibiotics and Acyclovir were discontinued with negative LP.
Of note, pt also displayed asterixis at this time.
C3/4, cryoglobulin were normal.Etiology of seizure was likely a combination of drugs that could lower the seizure threshold.
C3/4 and cryoglobulin were still pending at transfer, Cre was trended, and medications were continued with renal dosing as needed.
IV fluid trials were started, and 150mEq NaHCO3 was giver per renal.
Bactrim was discontinued because of elevated Cr.
Creatinine improved with gentle hydration and was 1.4 on the day of discharge.
Diarrhea: Pt noted to be C.diff positive on [**5-15**], and was started on PO vancomycin which was switched to PO Flagyl.
However, since Flagyl can lower the seizure threshold, patient was switched to PO Vancomycin after the episode (Day [**12-2**] on [**5-19**]) and kept on contact precautions.
14 day course of antibiotics was completed on [**5-28**], and repeat C. diff toxin was negative.
Patient was planned for a bacterial overgrowth test as an outpatient.
[**Name2 (NI) **] acute tx for lower quadrant abdominal pain that had no guarding/rebound, with CT abd/pelvis on [**5-20**] negative for abdominal hemorrhage.
DEPRESSION- Wellbutrin was slowly tapered down as this can also lower seizure threshhold.
Wellbutrin was discontinued and pt was started on venlafaxine for insurance/cost reasons which he tolerated well.
