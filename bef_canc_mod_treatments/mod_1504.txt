G-J tube in expected location with the tip at the duodenojejunal junction.
Video swallow eval: Oropharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed in conjunction with the speech and swallow division.
Mild to moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia is noted with reduced tongue movement, epiglottic deflection, pharyngeal contraction, and narrow upper esophageal sphincter relaxation.
There is evidence of valleculae residue often spilling to the poorly defined pyriform sinuses resulting in penetration of thick liquids and aspiration of thin liquids after the swallow and during follow-up swallows.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 y/o M PMH SCC of the tongue, PE on lovenox who presents with hematemesis.
Two large bore IVs were maintained, hematocrits were checked every 6 hours, IV PPI and H2 blocker continued.
The mucosa in the upper third of esophagus was very friable with some amount of diffuse oozing compatible with radiation-induced esophagitis.
It was recommended by the ENT attending that patient be further [**Last Name (un) 6349**] by GI for reflux control and other etiology for his bleed.
Patient endorsed improved GERD control with IV PPI twice daily staggered with IV H2 blocker.
He was transferred to the floor on these medications and had no further issues with vomiting.
# Nausea and inability to tolerate TPN or PEG feedings: The patient was continued on TPN in the MICU, and a PICC was placed for better access, but upon arriving on the medical floor, had constant complaints of a chemical taste in his mouth as well as a strong burning sensation in his throat, which he said began when TPN was initiated and only would stop when it was turned off.
Patient was insistent that TPN was stopped, and refused it for >24 hours.
Patient also endorsing history of fullness after tubefeeds or getting meds via PEG tube.
Given suspicion that PEG (per reports, tip in jejunum) might have migrated leading to feeds ending in stomach, a PEG/GJ study was done at the bedside with gastrograffin contrast.
He was then started on Vivonex TEN tube feeds at 10 cc/hr.
He was seen by speech and swallow, and they recommended a video swallow eval.

He was able to tolerate these and was discharged home on this regimen with TF at 65/hr.
# Squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue: Patient received IV narcotics until [**2-4**], when he was re-started on his home narcotic regimen.
Metoprolol was held in the MICU given the recent bleed, but was re-started after he was noted to be hemodynamically stable with no evidence of further bleeding on the floor.

We gave you a maximum amount of medications to help with nausea.
It is very important to take your anti-nausea medications around the clock to prevent nausea so that you can get the maximum dose of tube feeds.
We tried to keep as many of your home medications as possible.
We ADDED: Lansoprazole (for stomach acid) Famotidine (for stomach acid) Bisacodyl (for constipation) Ambien (Zolpidem), a medication for sleep  We CHANGED: Decreased Lovenox dose to 80 mg twice daily.
You should continue to take your other medications as prescribed.
