polyposis, she had resection of her colon at age 20 and now has a high output ileostomy.
She is dependent on TPN although she can take small amounts of oral food.
She came in [**2138-7-26**], to our attention when she had developed Staphylococcus aureus sepsis At this time, we removed a tunneled femoral catheter which had been tunneled from the right groin into the left upper chest and placed temporary access.
After clearing of the infection, we were attempting to recanalize the occluded central veins but were unsuccessful, even with a sharp recanalization technique.
On [**2138-12-9**], I then decided to place a new tunneled right femoral 7French double lumen Hickman catheter with tip at the level of L1 and the exit site over the lateral thigh.
She had noticed some sluggishness of return during TPN infusions and then had stopped TPN and only placed hydration.
The catheter over the right thigh had pulled back with the calf being outside of the skin.
There was some swelling and induration over the right thigh extending to the level of the knee which was suggestive of deep venous thrombosis but additional superinfection and cellulitis could not be ruled out.
She received an infusion of Magnesium.
I removed the tunneled right femoral line and replaced it with a 7French bright tip sheath.
Infusion catheters were placed and TPA was infused for the remainder of the day and of the night.
The TPA infusion was continued until the afternoon.
In the meantime, she had been transfused with two units of packed red blood cells and her hematocrit had reached 30.0.
The main goal for this day's procedure was to give the patient also a superior vena cava access since it became clear that she would be having recurrent infections in the long run.
The main treatment goal was to provide for the future three access sites: one for a tunneled line, one for a temporary line should the permanent one become infected and needs pulling, and a 3rd for a new tunneled line, considering this patient is life- long tpn.
With input from infectious diseases consult over the next days, appropriate Vancomycin regimen was obtained.
A regimen with one gram Vancomycin every eighteen hours was then achieved with appropriate trough levels.
Ultimately, the right internal jugular line was exchanged for a tunneled 7French double lumen Angiodynamics catheter of 57 centimeter length.
An ultrasound on [**2139-9-13**], demonstrated that the internal jugular vein and superior vena cava were patent compatible with a successful recanalization.
We had attempted to Coumadinize her since she had been on Coumadin on the outside.
However, because of the unreliable gastrointestinal absorption, we decided to add instead greater amounts of Heparin to her TPN and her daily infusion regimen.
We therefore transfused her again with two units of packed red blood cells.
We will keep her on Vancomycin until [**2139-9-24**].
B12 may not be stable in TPN, so she may need addional injections.
Heparin in the TPN infusion bag should be increased to 8000 U per day.
The daily 1 L infusion of  D5-/2NS should be supplemented with 5000 U heparin to be infused over the day.
Additional fluid should not contain heparin if need for hydration in presence of a high out put ileostomy.
This resulted in the B12 and folate additon recommendation.
Recommend also bone density study because of prior hysterectomy and heparin use as well as genetic cousneling because of [**Doctor First Name **] familial inbcidence of cancer to assess for Li-Frameni BRCA.
Occlusion of the inferior vena cava and both common iliac veins treated by stent reconstruction.
Superior vena cava syndrome with occlusion of all central veins treated by reconstruction of the right internal jugular, brachiocephalic and superior vena cava.
TPN with Heparin at mixture of 8000 U for nightly infusion .
She treats pain with Dilaudid subcutaneous and wears a Fentanyl patch.
