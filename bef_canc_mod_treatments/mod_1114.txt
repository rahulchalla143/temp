She was admited to the medical floor for treatment of PNA and hyponatremia, with CTX/azithromycin, and gentle IVF hydration.
On [**4-30**], pt desaturated to the the 80s, with BP 180-200, she was placed on BiPaP and transferred to the ICU and ultimately intubated.
Blood cultures from [**4-29**] returned positive for GPCs x2 sets (strep salivaria), for which ID consult obtained, and patient started on vancomycin 1g Q12H, azithromycin stopped.
After discussion of possible valvular intervention, pt was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] given her previous valvular surgery here.
An emergent bronchoscopy was performed, while pt was on coumadin and lovenox, which revealed bleeding from the inferior segment of the lingula on teh left, into which 10mL of epinephrine were injectied in addtion to cautery.
A urology consult was obtained given hydronephrosis [**2182-4-30**] (R kidney 10.9, left 10.2, with mild hydronephrosis), which recommended monitoring the patients creatinien and consideration of CT ABD/PEVLIS.
She was given propofol to facilitate sedation.
Past Medical History: - H/o aortic stenosis - COPD (not on home O2) - S/p resection of cardiac atrial myxoma [**2177**] - H/o aortic valvular thrombus - chronically anticoagulated - Autoimmune hepatitis - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Peri-rectal abscess [**11-2**] - Anxiety - Osteoporosis - "Inflammation of stomach" w/neg EGD.
ET tube in standard position.
# Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, with contributions from apparent RLL PNA, pulmonary edema 2/2 systolic CHF requiring intermittent diuresis, RLL pleural effusion s/p 800cc thoracentesis (transudative), and an episode of pulmonary hemorhhage felt [**12-31**] anticoagulation.
For the COPD, she was continued on prednisone taper and bronchodilators.
No interventions other than cold saline injections were done.
She eventually underwent tracheostomy on [**2182-5-14**].
# Mitral valve endocarditis: Shown on TTE here.
ID consulted and recommended continuing PCN x 6 weeks with evaluation of oral cavity for abscess.
ddx currently includes pre-renal [**12-31**] diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction.
Urine cx grew yeast despite foley changes; ID recommended no further treatment as the fungal infection would only return in 14 days after treatment.
heparin gtt discontinued.
CT surgery was consulted who felt that she was not a surgical candidate for multiple reasons including HIT positivity, recent embolic events, renal failure, operative mortality for two valves, and significant aortic valvular calcifications.
# Thrombocytopenia: HIT positive here, serotonin release assay returned marginally positive.
All heparin products were held.
Anticoagulation was discontinued here after TTE showed no atrial thrombus.
# C. Difficile Colitis - Prior to discharge, she was found to be C. difficile positive and started on po vancomycin since she was not actively having diarrhea.
It is recommend she continue on po vancomcyin until her course of pencillin is completed.
Was placed on air mattress.
Wound care was consulted and recommended dressing changes.
# OA: Receiving morphine 2mg po prn pain.
Per husband, she takes percocet at home for pain, but he is unsure for what.

Continued morphine 0.5mg iv q6hr prn pain.
# Anxiety: per husband, takes anti-anxiety medications at home, and receiving lorazepam 0.5-2mg q1hr prn agitation at OSH.
# Goals of Care: Family was presented with the poor prognosis of mitral valve endocarditis in the setting of critical aortic stenosis.
We discussed with family plan to complete 6 weeks of IV antibiotics and attempt ventilator titration but possibility of a transition to a more palliative care approach.
They will continue to discuss this decision as her clinical course plays out in rehab and would benefit from a palliative care consult in the future.
