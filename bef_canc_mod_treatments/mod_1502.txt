HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old male with a long history of coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2138**], multiple catheterizations and interventions), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, past tobacco history, family history of coronary artery disease, who reports a long history of angina manifested as left elbow pain.
He took sublingual nitroglycerin without relief, only later realizing that his nitroglycerin had long ago expired.
Coronary artery disease; status post 4-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2148**] (saphenous vein graft to D1, left anterior descending artery, first obtuse marginal, posterior descending artery); status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2152-4-3**] after an acute myocardial infarction with stenting of the saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal (95% occlusion); [**2152-11-3**] catheterization with 40% lesion in the saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and a 90% lesion in the saphenous vein graft to first obtuse marginal which was stented times two;  [**2154-11-4**] catheterization and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stenting of saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery;  [**2155-11-4**] catheterization with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the left circumflex.
Renal cell carcinoma, status post nephrectomy in [**2156-2-2**]  7.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Isordil 20 mg p.o.
Norvasc 10 mg p.o.
Lopressor 100 mg p.o.
Accupril 40 mg p.o.
Cardura 4 mg p.o.
Lipitor 40 mg p.o.
Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.3 mg p.r.n.
Chem-7 revealed sodium of 140, potassium 4.8, chloride 105, bicarbonate 23, BUN 27, creatinine 1.7, glucose 95.
Creatine kinase 125, MB 10, MB index 8, troponin 2.5.
Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 92 beats per minute, right bundle-branch block, borderline first-degree AV block, axis 93 degrees, 1-mm ST elevations in V4 through V6 (new compared with electrocardiogram from [**2156-6-24**]).
[**2158-3-2**], catheterization revealed a right-dominant system and 3-vessel disease.
Regarding the patient's grafts:  Saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending artery with no stenosis, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery with 90% proximal, 50% in-stent stenosis, saphenous vein graft to left circumflex was patent with native obtuse marginal with 80% lesion.
The patient underwent successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery with direct stenting of the proximal lesion.
In addition, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was done on the in-stent restenosis of the saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery with less than 20% residual stenosis and TIMI-III flow.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 75-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft and multiple interventions, and smoking who presented with five hours of resting angina partially relieved by nitroglycerin.
The patient was admitted to Eleven Riseman and started on IV nitroglycerin, continued on beta blocker, heparin, and aspirin.
He was placed on Integrilin and taken to cardiac catheterization on [**3-2**].
Catheterization revealed 3-vessel disease with totally occluded right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery, 90% proximal stenosis and 50% in-stent stenosis of the saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery graft, native obtuse marginal 80% lesion, 60% proximal left circumflex lesion.
His saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending artery graft revealed no stenosis, and the saphenous vein graft to left circumflex graft was patent.
The patient had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stents placed to his 90% proximal saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery graft leading to 0% residual stenosis.
The patient also had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to dilate the in-stent stenosis of the saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery which lead to less than 20% residual stenosis and TIMI-III flow.
This occurred over the weekend, and the patient was scheduled to have thrombin injection on Monday; however, a repeat ultrasound on Monday (two days after appearance of the bruit) revealed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
On the following day the patient saw physical therapy and was discharged home.
Of note, the patient's cardiac medications were maximized during his hospitalization.
Because the patient was still hypertensive with mild ventricular systolic dysfunction, captopril was started and increased to 75 mg p.o.
He will be sent home with antibiotic drops to treat conjunctivitis.
Successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent of proximal saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery lesion.
In addition, successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of in-stent stenosis within the saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
Right groin pseudoaneurysm, self resolved.
Polytrim 1 drop three times a day times seven days to left eye.
Plavix 75 mg p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Lipitor 40 mg p.o.
Captopril 75 mg p.o.
Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
Cardura 4 mg p.o.
Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.3 mg p.r.n.
