IMAGING: [**2117-9-13**] RUQ ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLERS 1.
There was no evidence of blood     Brief Hospital Course: 54 yo M with hx of hep C cirrhosis s/p transplant who presents with worsening fatigue and weakness found to have anemia from gastric variceal bleed.
On the initial EGD the source of active bleeding was injected with epinephrine however the patient's HCT continued to drop.
During the third EGD hemostasis was achieved with dermabond injections into the large varix in the gastric fundus.
Patient was started on octreotide gtt and protonix IV BID.
He was also started on cefrtiaxone for prophylaxis.
Ceftriaxone was switched to po cipro at treatment doses to complete 5 day course and ultimately transitioned to prophylactic doses.
He was continued on his octreotide which he completed 72 hours of, without any further episodes of hematochezia or melena.
His Tacrolimus was held along with other medications that interfere with clearance (HAART and fluconazole).
# Hep C s/p liver transplant: most recent viral load 13,900,000 IU/mL on [**8-24**].
Most recent bx c/w chronic rejection vs cholestatic variant of Hep C. Patient was continued on cellcept and prednisone.
He was initially given tacro dose but this was d/c after levels were in the 20s.
He became more short of breath following his blood transfusions and received lasix which some improvement in his breathing, he never had an increased oxygen requirement.
Patient had multiple paracenteses, none of which showed evidence of SBP however with his low total protein he was started on cipro for SBP prophylaxis.
# Dermabond Pulmonary Embolisms: After the patient's dermabond procedure a CXR showed multiple opacities that were consistent with dermabond pulmonary embolisms.
# Elevated INR: Improved from 2.2 to 1.2 after vitamin K IV 5mg X 2.
Likely a combination of synthetic dysfunction with vitamin K deficiency given longstanding poor PO intake.
Unlikely to absorb PO vitamin K given severe cholestasis.
# Diabetes: Started on home dose of NPH however was still having very elevated sugars.
Started NPH [**Hospital1 **].
Initially restarted on HAART regimen, however held in the setting of elevated tacro levels.
His home regimen was restarted prior to discharge.
Also continued on ppx with bactrim, azithromycin and fluconazole.
# Herpes lesions: He was treated with acyclovir while in the hospital but can go back on valtrex as an outpatient.
