Brief Hospital Course: This is a 69 year old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and recent radical cystectomy and neobladder who was initially transferred to the ICU from the floor for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure.
# Atrial fibrillation with rapid rate: Since his surgery last month, his rate has been very hard to control, but he was discharged on 100 mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **].
At time of arrival to ICU, his blood pressure was stable, so he was given IV beta-blocker and loaded with digoxin, as wished to avoid potentially chemically cardioverting.
He was started on anticoagulation, and INR will need to be followed by his PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 197**] was increased to 5 mg daily on [**3-29**], but INR trended up to 4.1 quickly.
Metoprolol was increased to 100 mg tid.
Given HR increasing to 130s-140s with activity once transferred to the floor (not orthostatic), pt was given IV digoxin again given concern for poor po absorption in the setting of his colitis.
Because of continued poor rate control with activity, diltiazem 30 mg qid was started.
Pt then had 2 second pauses  digoxin was stopped per cardiology recs (in addition, pts BP was higher so did not required digoxin anymore).
He was discharged on 100 mg of metoprolol TID and 120 of diltiazem daily.
Imaging of his abdomen and pelvis to look for abscess was deferred given that urology reported that soft tissue infections of the neobladder may be slower to resolve.
He was initially on ceftriaxone, however changed over to ciprofloxacin after sensitivies returned on his urine.
Cystogram was performed and pts foley was removed by urology.
Per urology, no further treatment is needed at this time.
He refused a nasogastric tube on admission.
He was started on flagyl on [**2127-3-27**] for this and should complete a 2 week course (1 week after cipro has been completed for UTI).
KUB appeared benigin on [**3-31**], and he was given antiemetics for his nausea (likely due to flagyl).
Will discharge with compazine as needed while pt is completing his course of flagyl.
# Fever: Pt continued to spike temps after cipro was started for UTI and flagyl started for C diff.
His antibiotics were changed back to IV in the case of poor GI absorption and once afebrile for 48 hrs, po antibiotics were resumed.
Will continue cipro for UTI and flagyl for C diff .
Continued ASA, statin, and beta-blocker .
He was not on any nephrotoxic medications.
He was treated initially with narcotics for this (Vicodin), but pt did not want to take any more.
