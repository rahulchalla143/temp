Admission Date:  [**2102-2-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-3-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2019-7-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Olanzapine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath, rapid atrial fibrillation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 82M hx severe dementia, DM, CHF, PVD (stent x2, most recent [**5-/2101**]), reported recent NSTEMI on [**2-10**] with trop 0.24 in setting of demand (no records of this), recent PNA dx at rehab on [**Last Name (un) 2830**], who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab after being noted by staff to be short of breath today with sats of 60% on RA.
In the ED, he was placed on Bipap initially in spite of 100% on 4LNC and diuresed with 40 IV lasix.
He was rated controlled with IV and PO metoprolol, with rates in the 100s.
His EKG showed afib with nonspecific ST-T wave changes, trop was 0.24.
He was placed on a heparin gtt in the setting of possible ischemia and anticoagulation for afib.
Past Medical History: PMH: - Dementia - Alzheimers - Bipolar (hx of hypersexual behaviour) - Type 2 DM - AKA [**8-/2099**] - CAD, history of MI - CHF (EF 30%) - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - PVD - Hx of TIA/CVA (left frontal, right occipital, right basal ganglia - Severe dysphagia s/p g-tube - Recurrent Aspiration pneumonia - Andemia - Chronic nausea - Ulceration of right big toe - c diff, VRE, MRSA  PSH: Right lower extremity diagnostic angiography ([**2100-9-3**]) Left above knee amputation ([**8-/2099**]) Cholecystectomy   Social History: Born in [**Location (un) 86**], never married, 2 adult children with minimal involvement.
Valve regurgitation cannot be compared given limitations in current study.
One of two views shows a slightly more confluent right upper lobe opacity of uncertain significance, quite vague, and there is also focal left infrahilar opacity.
More focal patchy right upper lobe and left infrahilar opacities of uncertain significance but possibly due to coinciding atelectasis or scarring.
Has been on heparin TID at rehab making PE less likely, however it was considered in setting of new atrial fibrillation, dyspnea, hypoxia and evidence of right sided overload on ECHO with preserved LV function.
Pt was rate controlled with metoprolol 25 QID changed to metop 50 [**Hospital1 **].
He was started on a heparin drip for CHADS score of 2.
#hypoxia - pt uses oxygen at the rehab facility.
Initially was hypoxic and required facetent and nasal cannula to maintain saturation.
Pt was moved to the floor, but continued to desat at night on nasal cannula.
He appears to be a mouth breather and sats were much improved when he was on facetent at 35% Fi02.
Pt will need to be maintained on oxygen as prior to admission, would suggest facetent at 35% FI02.
Pt was started on aspirin, metoprolol, and atorvastatin was held given his age.
# Hypoglycemia/DM2: on presentation tube feeds had been stopped and pt had repeated FS in the 40s, 50s.
Blood sugars to normal range once tube feeds were restarted.
#hypernatremia - pt presented with hypernatremia which improved with stabilization of fluid status.
# Dementia/Psych: hx of severe dementia, is incontinent of bowel/bladder at baseline and dependent of all ADLs.
Beta blocker was continued.
# HLP: not on a statin at rehab.
Did not start atorvastatin given pt's age.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - we DCd home isordil, amlodipine, and hydralazine as pt was hypotensive on admission.
Tomorrow to restart hydralazine 10mg TID and isosorbide dinitrite 10mg TID as per med list.
