HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57 year-old female with a history of inflammatory breast cancer, morbid obesity, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, systolic and diastolic heart failure, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease and anemia who felt short of breath on the morning of [**2114-4-10**].
The patient reports that at baseline she has shortness of breath, however, on the day of admission the patient's shortness of breath did not resolve with supplemental oxygen.
Consequently she was brought to the Emergency Department this a.m. where she was found to be hypoxic with O2 sats in the approximately 75%, hypotensive with blood pressure 90/50 and was treated with supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, broad spectrum antibiotics initially on Dopamine drip and started on a sepsis protocol.
Inflammatory breast cancer recently treated with Herceptin and Navelbine.
Lisinopril 40 q.d.
Aspirin 325 q.d.
Toprol XL 12.5 q.d.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes hives.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary this is a 57 year-old female Jehovah's witness with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea requiring BiPAP at night, congestive heart failure, hypertension, anemia and inflammatory breast cancer who was originally admitted [**4-10**] from her nursing home for hypoxia and hypotension and treated in the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was initially treated with Levofloxacin for pneumonia, BiPAP and noninvasive pressure ventilation for hypoxia without intubation.
She was subsequently transferred to the floor to continue treatment for pneumonia and hypoxia.
She was treated with Lasix for diuresis and moderate improvement of respiratory status.
On representation to the Intensive Care Unit [**2114-4-15**] the patient spiked a fever to 104, developed significant respiratory distress and was then emergently intubated semiemergently admitted and initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for her continued respiratory distress.
Respiratory failure:  The patient is currently being treated for multifactorial respiratory failure in the setting of congestive heart failure, marked obesity, obesity hypoventilation syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea who was semiemergently intubated [**3-/2039**] for progressive hypercarbic respiratory failure and a newly developing sepsis.
The patient's blood gas prior to intubation was 7.23, 68 and 385.
The patient was intubated and continued on her settings.
She ultimately had tracheostomy performed on [**2114-4-26**] per the ENT Service.
However, she remained difficult intubation and exacerbated primarily by her recurrent congestive heart failure and over 30 liters positive, fluid balance since her admission.
At this point in time she remains trached on pressure support ventilation and has been doing quite well.
The goal would be to continue diuresis gently approximately 500 cc to negative one liter per day in order to avoid intravascular of the patient and acute renal failure.
Additionally the patient was treated aggressively for her MRSA sepsis.
She completed a course of antibiotics for presumed pneumonia and subsequent treatment for urinary tract infection as well.
She continues with trach care and nebulizers prn and aggressive suctioning as needed.
She was approximately 30 liters positive for fluid following treatment for MRSA sepsis and remains volume overloaded at this time.
She was initially started on a Lasix drip and subsequently developed acute renal failure and that was discontinued and the patient was started on Nesiritide with minimal effect on diuresis.
Ultimately Nesiritide was discontinued minimizing her fluid intake and she responded to Lasix intravenously prn as needed for goal as stated above.
She was seen on the CH Service by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] and upon resolution of her hypotension the patient was started on low dose beta blocker and treatment of her congestive heart failure.
The patient was treated with Vancomycin and subsequent surveillance cultures were negative.
The patient's antibiotics course will be extended for a minimum of four to six weeks intravenous Vancomycin for an underlying right IJ clot that is being followed serially.
She was given intravenous fluids, starting on intravenous Hydrocortisone 50 gallop or murmur intravenously q.i.d.
and required Dopamine for blood pressure support.
She will be continued on Vancomycin for approximately one month.
Empirically while the patient did not demonstrate evidence of adrenal insufficiency removal of intravenous steroids complicated the patient's picture and she subsequently became hypotensive.
In addition, the patient responded poorly to Natrecor requiring Dopamine for blood pressure support in attempt for diuresis.
With subsequent discontinuation of the Natrecor and continuing of the intravenous Hydrocortisone the patient was effectively diuresed and continued to be diuresed at the time of this dictation without significant hypotension.
Acute renal failure:  The patient has a baseline creatinine of .5 to .7 and subsequently developed acute renal failure with a creatinine rising to 2.1 with diuresis presumed to be prerenal.
With gentle diuresis her creatinine slowly improved and it was approximately 1.3 at the time of this dictation.
Goal was to continue diuresis gently in order to avoid acute renal failure.
Right IJ thrombus:  The patient has a known right IJ thrombus as a presumed complication from right IJ line placement in the setting of sepsis.
She has a recent history of inflammatory breast cancer and had been receiving weekly Navelbine and Herceptin.
The plan was to try to reduce the size of her left breast mass so she could become a candidate for a mastectomy.
Heparin products had been avoided and she has not been anticoagulated.
She continues on Epogen and iron and her hematocrit seems to stabilize between the 23 and 26 range.
Vaginal spotting:  During her hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit the patient had repeated vaginal spotting with an associated drop in her hematocrit.
Perirectal swab was polymicrobial in nature including MRSA, however, it was thought that this was unlikely to be the source of the patient's MRSA bacteremia though should be considered if the patient has recurrent event without additional line placement.
The patient continues to be followed serially with examinations with no obvious signs of infection.
FEN:  The patient remained NPO and during the initial part of her hospitalization was started on tube feeds.
The patient continues with tube feeds at this time.
She unfortunately was not a candidate for PEG or open G tube placement given her [**Doctor Last Name **] habitus and potential surgical risks.
She continues on her tube feeds at this time.
