There is a jejunostomy tube overlying the left upper quadrant in suitable position.
Enteric contrast has been administered via that tube for this study.
This appearance may relate to radiation change or involvement with tumor.
We could not get a histologic diagnosis and at the first operation I did not think that I could extirpate the rectum very well, and so we did an end sigmoid colostomy and treated her with radiation and chemotherapy.
At the time of surgery, we were able to take down the enterorectal fistula and close the enterotomy and then do a low anterior resection, takedown the colostomy and resect it and then do an anastomosis and then because of the situation with the previous radiation then do a protected colostomy.
OPERATIONS:  Exploratory lap, lysis of adhesions (3 hours), resection of fistula, and closure of the enterotomy, low anterior resection and colorectostomy, coloproctostomy, takedown of colostomy, transverse colostomy and frozen section biopsy.
PROCEDURE:  Under satisfactory general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine and prepped and draped in the usual manner.
After we saw that we could get a reasonable length of rectum up to do the anastomosis, we took down the colostomy which had a pericolostomy hernia and then transected it with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3224**] stapler and then anastomosed it with 2 layers of 4-0 silk, initially by using the rectum as a handle, but then dealing with the front and taking it off and then getting a very nice 2-layer 4-0 silk interrupted anastomosis.
This was subsequently matured at the end of the procedure by dividing the anterior wall.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the PACU and will likely go to the ICU.
She was placed NPO; tube feeds were held; and a foley catheter was inserted.
Her j-tube was placed to gravity.
A pigtail catheter was placed.
She remained NPO and continued  nutrition via TPN.
On HD 7 she was taken to the operating room where she underwent an exploratory lap, lysis of adhesions, resection of fistula, and closure of the enterotomy, low anterior resection and colorectostomy, coloproctostomy,takedown of colostomy, transverse colostomy and frozen section biopsy.
She tolerated the procedure well.
Estimated blood loss was 600ml and she received 2 units of PRBCs and 500ml albumin.
She remained intubated after surgery and was taken to the ICU for further care.
By POD 1 the presacral fluid culture grew staph aureus susceptible to Vancomycin and her Levo/Flagyl were discontinued.
At POD 3 narcotic pain control was weaned and she was receiving tylenol with good control.
Her colostomy was functioning well with good output.
1/2 strength tube feeds were started and TPN was continued.
Vancomycin was continued.
Her tube feeds were advanced to 30cc/hr and her TPN was continued.
Her tube feeds were advanced to 40 cc/hr, which she tolerated well.
Her antibiotics were continued and her pigtail continued to have minimal output.
She remained afebrile and her tube feeds advanced to 70 cc/hr cycled overnight with non-generic imodium.
She was discharged home with nursing services for her tube feeds and IV antibiotics.
