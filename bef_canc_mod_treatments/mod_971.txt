He was admitted to the medical ICU for airway management and close monitoring.
Given limitations of a non-contrast examination, no evidence of abscess.
The etiology of the patient's symptoms remained unclear; he was therefore covered empirically for fungal infection with fluconazole (2 week course planned, IV while inpatient, PO as outpatient) and for bacterial infection with Unasyn, which was converted to augmentin PO for 2 week course upon discharge.
He also received dexamethasone 10 mg IV Q8H x 3 doses.
On the floor, he continued to improve, able to tolerate PO and pills, hoarse voice improving, good SpO2 on room air, never with airway compromise.
Repeat visualization by the ENT team demonstrated improved edema, and they felt a laryngitis was most likely bacterial or fungal (had a visual question of a fungal appearance); ie: possible fungal supraglottis.
He was continued on fluconazole and Unasyn as above, and became afebrile.
S/P Transplant: The patient was unable to take his immunosuppressant medications for approximately 2 days due to his odynophagia.
He was evaluated by the transplant team and pharmacy service, who recommended switching to liquid formulations of the patient's immunosuppressants while in-house to facilitate swallowing.
DM: Patient was maintained on a humalog sliding scale while in-house.
