MRSA Endocarditis: Now cleared on [**4-8**] TEE after vanco x8wks and gent & rifampin x2wks; however, dehiscence of porcine appeared.
Heart and hepatic function are now optimized with reversal of coagulopathy and improvement in thrombocytopenia.
-liver bx consistent with recovery from episode of CHF induced hepatocellular damage from which complete recovery may be expected.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent aggressive diuresis and treatment of her heart failure preoperatively, which included an intra aortic balloon pump and inotropic therapy.
Once she was cleared by the hepatology service, she was taken to the operating room on [**4-28**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a redo MVR via R thoracotomy with a 27mm mosaic valve.
She also required a R femoral artery thrombectomy by vascular surgery.
Post operatively she was started on epinephrine, milrinone and inhaled nitric oxide, continued with her IABP and transferred to the ICU in stable condition.
She was started on heparin for anticoagulation.
She was started on fluconazole postoperatively because it was noted that she had a rash consistent with yeast on her chest, this was continued for 14 days postoperatively per the infectious disease team.
Her nitric oxide and milrinone were weaned over the next several days, her support from the ventilator was decreased, and she was extubated on POD#4 without difficulty.
She was started on Natrecor and aggressive diuretic therapy to achieve diuresis.
She had been started on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, which she had a few short episodes postoperatively.
Her anticoagulation was discontinued on POD#14.
