[**6-7**] CT-Head IMPRESSION: 1.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is gallbladder distention presumably due to NPO status.
Gallbladder distention, presumably due to NPO status.
[**6-18**] Liver and Gallbladder US - FINDINGS: Limited views of the gallbladder demonstrate small amount of sludge.
IMPRESSION: Interval evolution of bilateral parenchymal hemorrhage, without change in size or associated mass effect.
[**6-29**] CXR -  FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-19**], there has been placement of a right central catheter that extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
IMPRESSION: Little change except for placement of new central catheter.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: This is a 30 yo F with h/o SLE, ESRD on HD (T, Th, Sat), HTN, anemia, sickle trait, with multiple [**Hospital1 18**] admissions and recent MSSA endocarditis (tx w/ vanco until [**5-14**]) and osteomyelitis with BKA admitted for S. aureus bacteremia.
The patient continued to c/o headache after dialysis and it did not improve with tylenol or dilaudid.
She had two siezures and was treated with dilantin that was eventually switched to PO keppra.
The patient had already received vancomycin 1gm during dialysis on [**6-2**] and [**6-4**].
ID was consulted and continued vancomycin 1gm at dialysis pending sensitivity results.
Because no source of infection was found in cultures or CT scans, [**Month/Year (2) 621**] was switched again to ceftriaxone to cover MSSA on [**6-24**].
Pt has remained afebrile and we will complete [**5-17**] week course of hemodialysis dosed ceftriaxone for endocarditis.
She will complete her cefazolin course and get dosed at dialysis, 2 gm M and W, 3 gm on Friday.
# ESRD on HD: The patient had received dialysis on the day of transfer.
Dialysis was given with isotonic fluids for her increased ICP from the hemorrhages.
Pt also has history of HIT so did not used heparin at all.
# Nutrition - patient had NG tube placed after ICH and was being fed on tube feeds.
She did pull our her NG tube once, but was replaced while she was under anesthesia for her EJ catheter.
She is currently being fed and having tube feeds to meet appropriate calorie demands.
If at rehab, she is able to keep up with calories on her own, the NG tube can be pulled.
We discussed the option of placing a PEG tube, but since her mental status improved, we decided against it.
# Pain control - pain control has been an issue for the patient since her mental status improved.
Pain service was asked, and they recommended restarting her amitryptline, as well as adding gabapentin for neuropathic pain.
Wound care consult was called and recommended routine management of ulcer.
After her EJ placement had an acute Hct drop to high 20s that has been stable since the procedure.
She will need to have her main meds continually titrated for relief.

We performed a ECHO of your heart and found a vegatation on your heart valve.
You were treated with Vancomycin at dialysis for this infection, and then when you kept having fevers, we broadened your coverage.
You then stopped having fevers and the infectious disease team decided to just keep you on cefazolin as an antibiotic.
We are trying to control your pain with dilaudid and fentanyl patch.
You were kept on dialysis throughout your hospital stay for kidney failure from your lupus.
We put in an external jugular catheter for dialysis access.
Followup Instructions: Pt going to acute rehab facility - will have doctor at next facility who will continue management of care.
Pt needs to continue dialysis on MWF schedule.
Dialysis will also dose and give her cefazolin (2gm given after HD M and W, 3gm on F), which she will need to continue for a total of [**5-17**] weeks.
The start date of her cefazolin was [**6-22**].
