The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, Levaquin, and Flagyl.
Blood cultures were drawn and stool was sent for testing for Clostridium difficile toxin as well as ova and parasites.
Their recommendation was that vancomycin by mouth be added to the patient's treatment regimen.
Following an evaluation of the patient's status, it was decided that he needed an emergent colectomy with ileostomy for fulminant Clostridium difficile colitis.
The risks and the benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient agreed to proceed.
The patient underwent a total abdominal colectomy without complication.
The patient's early postoperative course was complicated by hemodynamic instability requiring massive volume resuscitation and Levophed supplementation as well as multiple ventilator changes to maintain adequate oxygenation.
He required paracentesis, during which approximately 3,400 milliliters of peritoneal fluid was drained as well as the placement of a chest tube on [**2167-2-13**].
Tube feeds were started.
The patient's tube feeds by NG tube were advanced to goal.
Of note, a small portion of the patient's incision was opened distal to the umbilicus to allow for the patient's diagnostic and therapeutic peritoneal lavage.
This part of the incision is currently packed with wet-to-dry dressings.
The patient was noted to aspirate on thin liquids but tolerated thick liquids and his diet, therefore, was advanced.
Plans are to initiate a diet of nectar-thick liquids with ground solids.
Basic aspiration precautions will be maintained.
