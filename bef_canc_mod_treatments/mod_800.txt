Lactulose 15 mL via G-tube b.i.d.
Ativan 0.5 mg IV q.4 h. p.r.n.
ProMod tube feedings at 80 cc an hour.
Ventilatory settings have been constant SIMV of 10    to 12, tidal volume 700, PEEP 5, and oxygen content 30    percent.
Urinalysis unremarkable for blood, nitrate, protein, glucose, ketone, bilirubin, and urobilin, however, greater than 50 RBCs and greater than 1000 WBCs.
There is a healthy-appearing colostomy with appliance in place in the left lower quadrant.
There is a triple-lumen subclavian catheter on his left side.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2105-2-9**], the patient underwent a surgery without any complications.
The ventilator was then rapidly returned to his home settings without any problems.
On the night of postoperative day zero, a femoral arterial line was placed after several failed attempts at radial and ulnar arterial lines.
Therefore, on hospital day three, the patient was taken to Interventional Radiology and a dual lumen PICC catheter was placed in his arm.
The subclavian line was then removed and several sets of surveillance blood cultures had been sent and will continue to be followed.
As a final recommendation, Infectious Disease suggested that the patient's antibiotic coverage be changed from amikacin and Zosyn to meropenem 1 g IV q.8 h.  A full course of his meropenem would be two weeks, having started this on [**2105-2-11**], and the meropenem should be run until [**2105-2-28**].
On postoperative day three, the patient was restarted on his home benzodiazepine regimen p.r.n.
