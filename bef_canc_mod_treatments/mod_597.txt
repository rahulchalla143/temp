Admission Date:  [**2113-4-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-5-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2039-11-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**] Chief Complaint: fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central venous line placement (Attempted EGD, patient unable to tolerate w/ low oxygenation)   History of Present Illness: 73 year old male with history of renal transplant, CAD, PVD, DM presenting with marked fatigue, poor appetite, nonproductive cough and generalized weakness/failure to thrive.
While in the ICU, he was treated with cefepime, vancomycin and azithromycin for pneumonia in an immunosuppressed patient.
He was started on IV iron supplementation for plan of 8 doses.
His creatinine mildly improved after the blood transfusions and some diuresis to 4.5 at transfer.
Troponin was elevated at 0.16-0.18, thought to be due to renal failure and anemia.
ESRD s/p LRRT ([**9-/2105**]) 8.
PVD s/p R SFA-tib/peroneal trunk NRSVG (99), jump graft from R tib/peroneal trunk to distal R PT NR cephalic VG ([**4-/2105**]), PTA of R SFA-PT bypass ([**10-2**]), angioplasty L CIA ([**11/2104**]), L CFA-PT [**Name (NI) **] with in-situ SVG ([**1-29**]), b/l TMA, b/l sesamoidectomies 9. lung adenoca s/p VATS/wedge resection of nodule 10.
Family History: Significant for lung cancer in the patient's father who developed this at age 75, but subsequently died of a stroke.
Brief Hospital Course: 73 y.o male with h.o renal transplant in [**2104**], CAD, diastolic dysfunction, PVD, DM, HTN, severe OA presented to the ED from home with six weeks of productive cough, nausea, decreased po intake, generalized weakness.
# Failure to thrive / poor PO intake Poor PO intake / nausea / vomiting initially had a very long differential, including med toxicity (sirolimus), uremia, depression, diabetic gastroparesis, peptic ulcer disease, colonic mass, obstruction, and chronic mesenteric ischemia.
Reglan 5 mg QID was started emperically; after 3 days his diet improved, and all nausea / vomiting ceased spontaenously.
Regarding depression, patient was also started on citalopram and mirtazipine, which he tolerated well.
On the medical floor his HCT remained stable, however he was transfused another unit of PRBCs to help with his generalized weakness.
He received 8 days of IV iron repletion as well, and was continued on PO iron repletion thereafter.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure/bacterial pnemonia He was admitted with respiratory distress, secondary to acute on chronic diastolic CHF.
He was diuresed with IV lasix and received vancomycin/cefepime / flagyl initially and then levofloxacin for his RLL infiltrate on CXR.
He completed a 7 day course of antibiotics for the pneumonia.
# Acute on Chronic Renal failure, autolgous renal transplant Renal transplant was consulted.
His rapamycin was held until the level was < 8.
His other immunosuppressants, including prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil were continued.
Bactrim prophylaxis was changed to single strength daily.
After diuresis and a low creatinine of 2.8, his creatinine trended up again to 4.0.
His FeUrea at the time was low, and lasix was held.
He was instructed to hold his lasix for 2 days post discharge and then restart at the initial home dose, 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] PO.
Head MRI with gadolinium was recommended non acutely to better evaluate this and rule out the unlikely possibility of a primary lung metastasis; the MRI was witheld due to ARF, decreased GFR, and as mentioned above, the patient's inability to tolerate MRIs.
Given shoulder aches and weakness, ESR ~ 60, patient was thought to potentially have PMR.
His prednisne dose was increased to 10 mg / day.
After no response after 2 days of treatment, the prednisone was dropped back to 3 mg / day.
His neurontin was stopped initially in the MICU.
Given lack of symptomatic changes with respect to peripheral neuropathy, we kept holding off on this medication.
The team's preference was to rehab the patient before surgery with diet.
# Wound care The wound care team was consulted, and left recommendations regarding the ulcers on his feet/legs as well as sacrum.
# DM type 2 uncontrolled with complications Transitioned to lantus and blood sugars ranged 100-200.
The wife and patient were agreable to humalog prandial dosing as well with sliding scale.
This change was made when the patient was not taking POs well, such that long acting lantus could be dosed unchanged and humalog used for mealtime BS control.
