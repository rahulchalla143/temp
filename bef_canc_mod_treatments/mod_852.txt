A left cervical rib is incidentally noted.
Re-evaluate after diuresis can be helpful to exclude superimposed infectious process.
Flow could be restored temporarily, but rethrombosis occured twice, despite mechanical thrombectomy, chemical thrombolysis, balloon angioplasty, [**Doctor Last Name **] embolectomy and stenting of the venous anastomosis.
Recommend secondary prevention of CAD including plavix 75mg daily for 6 months, and medical management of the patient's ACS.
Unsuccessful vascular closure with Mynx  Tunneled Cath pending   Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo M with history of CAD s/p NSTEMI, ESRD on HD, DM2, HTN, HL, presents with shortness of breath due to volume overload  #Shortness of breath/volume overload: Likely due to ESRD with insufficient volume removal on HD.
Symptoms improved once given lasix and placed on nitro drip in the ED; nitro drip was gradually weaned off.
He was continued on metoprolol 25 mg PO BID and lisinopril 40 mg PO daily.
He was given lasix 120 mg IV but did not make significant urine so lasix was discontinued.
His fistula for dialysis was found to be clotted so an IR fistulogram and thromectomy was attempted but failed with immediate reclotting so an IJ temporary dialysis catheter was placed with plan for tunneled catheter in 2 days.
Dialysis was done twice in the CCU with 1.8 L removed each time.
The patient had a tunneled HD catheter placed in IR.
He is not on aspirin or plavix at home.
Patient reports that he was on aspirin previously but was told to stop it approximately 5 months ago.
Cards was consulted and a heparin gtt was started.
# HTN - elevated BP on admission, was given metoprolol in the ED without much effect, but also in setting of volume overload.
Continued on metoprolol and higher dose of lisinopril; HD x 2 in CCU.
He was started on carvedilol and lisinopril 40mg with good control of his BP.
# ESRD - history of right nephrectomy for suspected malignancy, but found to be benign pathology.
ESRD thought to be secondary to HTN and FSGS, is currently on HD qMWF at home.
IR attempted thrombectomt but failed due to reclotting so a temporary IJ catheter was placed for dialysis.
This was replaced by a tunneled HD cath placed in IR.
His phosphorous was climbing so the patient was started on sevelamer.
He was started on valtrex which gave relief to his discomfort.

You were found to be volume overloaded and you were treated with diuretics and dialysis.
The IR doctors tried to restore the blood flow, but were unable to, so you received a temporary catheter through a vein in your neck and a more permanant tunnelled catheter that was placed on [**9-3**].
We started the following medications: START Aspirin 325 mg daily START taking labetalol 200mg twice daily to lower your blood pressure and heart rate (this medication will be instead of metoprolol) START taking calcium and Sevelamer with meals to lower your phosphate level  We increased the following medication: INCREASE Lisinopril to 40 mg daily INCREASE Simvastatin to 40 mg daily  We stopped the following medication: STOP taking Metoprolol STOP taking ciprofloxacin as you have finished the course of the antibiotic.
