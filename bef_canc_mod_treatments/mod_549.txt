Ms. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 38F with a PMH s/f type 1 Diabetes Mellitus with prior episodes of DKA in the past, complicated by and NSTEMI in [**8-/2111**], biventricular CHF, severe PVD s/p recent femoral bypass for an ischemic right foot, and current cocaine abuse.
Last night, her father noted her to have a decreased appetite, and "changes in her body language" consistent with past presentations of hyperglycemia.
He spoke to the [**Last Name (un) **] coverage, who recommended administering her 75/25 and sliding scale, and to continue monitoring.
Her exam was notable for dry gangrene on her right foot.
She was given a 7 unit bolus of insulin, followed by 7units/hour infusion, and a 2L NS bolus.
Utox on admission positive for opiote (on as rx) as well as cocaine.

Diabetic ketoacidosis:  The etiology of the patient's DKA was thought to be medication noncompliance in the setting of polysubstance abuse, as her tox screen was positive for cocaine and she had no evidence of acute infection or cardiac ischemia.
She was also initially managed with an insulin infusion at 5-6units/hr (0.1units/kg/hr) until her blood sugar fell below 250 and her anion gap closed, at which point she was started on an ISS.
Her anion gap did widen to 17 on hospital day #2, [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted, and she was transitioned back to insulin gtt overnight.
Her finger stick glucose, lytes, and pH were monitored closely, and potassium was repleted prn throughout her ICU course.
Patient was given juice and crackers and blood sugar returned to the normal range.
# Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration, as evidenced by BUN/Cr ratio >20 in the setting of DKA.
Her Cr improved to 1.7 after intravascular volume repletion.
She was also continued on nephrocaps and her medications were renally dosed.
[**Name (NI) **] home regimen of metoprolol was held given the risk of unopposed alpha agonism in setting of beta blockade.
CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction:  Monitored closely during volume resuscitation for signs of hypoxia.
Her BB and lisinopril were held in the setting of hypotension and ARF, but restarted before [**Name (NI) **].
Chronic Pain: Her home regimen of oxycodone was held until her mental status cleared.
