He was lethargic and nauseas with worsening ataxia and he underwent a revision of the distal portion of the VP shunt.
Post-operatively, he remained intubated and was then extubated in the PACU.
However, he had an episode of emesis that evening and then again overnight requiring NG tube placement by general surgery.
CXR appeared wet and he was given Lasix per the medicine team request.
CT abdomen showed dilated small bowel with decompression in terminal ileum.
He was taken to the OR on [**3-3**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for abdominal exploration for obstruction vs. infection.
An external drainage device was set attached to the shunt to drain CSF.
He was taken to the OR emergently for removal of VP shunt and placement of a new antibiotic impregnated external ventricular drain.
His post-op CT showed significant decrease in ventricular size and his drain was raised to 10cm H2O.
On [**3-6**], patient was examined and he continued to have limited R lateral and upward gaze, he was also aphasic and not following commands as well as he has been in the past.
His drain was dropped back to 0cm H20 to drain for 20cc and then EVD was raised to 5cm H2O.
He was to drain 400cc/day or 100cc/6hr, if goal is not met,the orders were to drop the drain to 0cc H2O and drain until goal is achieved, then raise back to 5cc H2O.
On [**3-8**], patient's exam remained stable, he was placed on Dilantin for his complex partial seizures and his level was 11.1.
On [**3-9**], his EVD output was lower than the desired goal, his drain was dropped to 0 to drain 20cc then raised back to 5.
A repeat head CT showed improvement of hydrocephalus and CSF was sent for vancomycin trough.
Patient had lateral and upward gaze limitation, but was following complex commands.
His drain is periodically dropped to -5 to drain CSF to obtain goal of 400cc/day.
On [**3-11**] his daily goal of CSF drainage was dropped to 320cc/day.
His daily goal from EVD drainage was increased to 360cc/day.
No heparin was started.
PICC line for TPN administration located near clots and was removed.
He tolerated the procedure well and was intubated without incident.
He was transferred back to SICU for further management.
New Left frontal catheter tract ICH without significant mass effect.
Subsequently, R EVD was removed in routine fashion on [**3-19**] and post pull CT showed stable ICH and decrease in ventricle size.
He was experiencing narrow complex tachycardia, cardiology was consulted and beta blocker was started.
He was seen to have LUE rhythmic tremors, he was restarted on dilantin.
Over the weekend, patient was found to have positive c.diff culture and fevers were thought to be from a combination of IV vancomycin and c.diff.
He was started on Flagyl and vancomycin changed to oral medication.
Cardiology recommendations were to start him on metoprolol 12.5 PO BID for tachycardia.
Flagyl was made po per ID.
On [**3-25**], he was following commands and moving his four extremities spontaneously.
Calorie counts were continued and his calcium was repleted.
