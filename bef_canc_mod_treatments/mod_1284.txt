She was intubated and placed on AC ventilation without problem.
[**Name (NI) **] follow up ABG's showed adequate ventilation and oxygenation on the ventilator.
Since then, the pt has done well from a resp standpoint and was extubated [**8-23**].
Hypertension:  Pt was admitted to MICU with SBP>180 and treated with labetolol drip for 5-8 minutes before her BP dropped to SBP 60's.
She was sedated with propofol prior to this and her precipitous drop in MAP was thought to be [**3-2**] propofol and vasovagal reaction from intubation.
She did require dopamine and levophed and fluids (2L) to maintain her SBP > 70.
Her blood pressure significantly improved after dialysis with removal of fluid and optimization of anti-HTN meds labetaolol, valsartan, and norvasc.
Renal Failure:  Dialysis was attempted on pt [**8-22**] but failed due to labile BP's.
Dialysis will be attempted today agian.Dialyzed off 3L on [**8-23**].7L on [**8-26**] and 1.6 L on [**8-28**]  4.
