On [**11-11**], we restarted his tube feeds, albeit slowly.
He was given Reglan and Zofran for nausea.
His chronic pain medication was increased to Dilaudid 1mg q3hrs.
He was initially started on Levofloxacin IV, but switched to PO as the patient tube feeds were resumed.
# Hypertension: Per wife, baseline BP is usually 85-110's systolic.
# Hyponatremia: Patient's sodium at admission was 126 (with a baseline appears in the low 130s)  Initially, we thought that this could be due to dehydration [**1-23**] to emesis and diarrhea and history of stopping his tube feeds.
He was given 2L of fluid overnight and was found to have a Na of 122 in the am on HD#1.
We started him on strict fluid restrictions with his Na improving to 124.
We started him on maintenace fluids and ordered 1g salt tabs TID.
We continued nadolol given history of varices.
He responded well to IV dilaudid 1mg Q3hrs during his hospital course.
See pain management as above.
# Seizure disorder: We continued home medications of keppra and neurontin.
# Hx throat/neck cancer:  We continue maintanence medications (nystatin, bactroban, nebs, scopolamine patch, etc).
Therefore, we doubled his dose of Levothyroxine to 50mcg QD.
Restarted tube feeds slowly [**11-11**].
The patient was administering his own feeds at the time of discharge .
He was also started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
On [**2190-11-14**] he developed profuse epistaxis that resolved with packing and compression.
His bleeding subsequently stopped and he was transferred to the ENT service for further management as his abdominal issues had resolved.
Once on the floor his labs continued to be checked, his tube feeds were advanced and his pain medication was administered.
PT saw the patient and determined that he was safe to d/c home with his previous level of home services.
At the time of discharge, the patient was administering his own bolus tube feedings, ambulating without assistance, voiding without difficulty, using humidified oxygen via his trach mask, and his pain was well controlled via narcotics administered via his G-tube.
Lastly, his wife was given additional training in appropriate trach care and suctioning per her request.
