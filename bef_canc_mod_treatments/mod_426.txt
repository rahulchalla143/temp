CHF exacerbation/cariogenic shock: Patient was started on dopamine for inotropic support.
He was then started on a lasix gtt to decrease volume overload.
He was able to have around 500mL UOP on the lasix gtt but this was not sufficiently diuresing him as he took in more than this in fluids.
He maintained his UOP with lasix and maintained a net even fluid status this way.
He was discharged with TEDS for LE edema and lasix 40mg day.
With pre-load dependence was very hard to diurese patient and required lasix gtt then CVVH as well as pressors as above.
A pacer was placed on [**2112-3-24**] with substantial improvement in patient's hemodynamics.
# ARF: Renal was consulted after patient failed to increase uop sufficiently with lasix gtt.
Therefore, a CVVH line was placed and this was initiated both for volume overload and ARF.
Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors were held in setting of hypotension.
