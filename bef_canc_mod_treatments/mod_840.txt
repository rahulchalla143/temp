MEDICATIONS:  Meds at home include Combivent and occasional Prilosec.
His bypass time was 158 minutes with a cross clamp time of 124 minutes, and circ arrest of 16 minutes.
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.
He had propofol infusion at 20 mics per kilogram per minute and nitroglycerin at 1.5 mics per kilogram per minute.
However, he had a fair amount of bleeding and required several transfusions of packed red blood cells, as well as fresh frozen plasma.
Additionally the patient suffered from persistent fevers, for which he was pan cultured on numerous occasions.
Eventually the patient grew methicillin sensitive staph from his sputum and was treated with appropriate antibiotics.
From a respiratory standpoint the patient remained paralyzed and sedated and fully ventilated.
However, every attempt to turn down his sedation and remove the paralytics was met with increased hypoxia, as well as acidosis requiring reinstitution of these measures.
During this entire period the patient was undergoing bronchoscopy on an every other day basis.
A right thoracentesis was performed on that day and drained about 600 cc of serosanguineous fluid.
Bilateral chest tubes were placed and a Swan- Ganz catheter was also placed.
Additionally following the placement of the Swan-Ganz catheter, the patient appeared to be septic and his antibiotic coverage was broadened.
He did, however, continue to require full ventilation and was sedated with morphine and Ativan, which were slowly weaned over the next several days.
However, thoracic surgery was also consulted and a trache and PEG were placed on postoperative day 25, following which the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation, from which he was DC cardioverted into a sinus rhythm.
At the time of this dictation the patient has been on trache call for approximately 5 days without requiring any ventilatory support.
