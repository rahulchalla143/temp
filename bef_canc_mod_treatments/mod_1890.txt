Benign right frontal cystic tumor status post right frontal craniotomy on [**2109-7-1**].
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband, daughter, and son.
She was started on prophylactic Oxacillin to cover skin flora, and Dermatology was consulted along with Neurology and Ophthalmology for the ophthalmic involvement.
With regard to her skin lesions, they continued exfoliate over the next couple of days, and her skin care included frequent Vaseline hydrated petroleum application to decrease insensible losses.
The patient's intake and output were closely monitored and replaced appropriately; however, the intensive nursing care requirement made it difficult for the patient to receive adequate on the floor, and therefore, she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit again for frequent ophthalmic applications and skin care.
While in the MICU, the patient continued to have meticulous skin care and eye care.
From and Infectious Disease standpoint, the patient was started on intravenous Oxacillin empirically.
Blood cultures on the 5th was with no growth times two; however, one bottle from her PICC line grew out gram-positive cocci on [**7-27**].
Subsequently the organism was found to be CNS with Corynebacterium, and Vancomycin was discontinued prior to transfer to the floor on [**8-5**].
Her skin care requirements decreased to Petroleum jelly twice a day at the time of discharge.
Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition:  On admission the patient was begun on TPN for nutritional support.

Infectious Disease:  At the time of admission, she was started on empiric antibiotics and placed on contact precautions secondary to her extensive skin lesions; however, as the patient improved throughout the course of this admission, contact precautions were discontinued, and the patient was discharged home with services.
Neurology:  The patient has a history of cystic tumor status post resection in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year and was started on prophylactic Dilantin leading to presumed [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.
At the time of this admission, the patient's Dilantin was discontinued, and no other anticonvulsants were started, given the patient's risk of seizures several weeks after her surgery was unlikely.
The likely etiology of this is orthostatic hypotension from her fluid losses; however, given the patient's neurologic history, Neurology was consulted to evaluate for possible seizure.
A follow-up MR scan would be recommended with gadolinium to evaluate for the presence of residual tumor.
Rehabilitation:  The patient throughout this admission worked with our physical therapy people and continued to improve with regard to range of motion and strength in the upper and lower extremities, and by the time of discharge, she was ambulating throughout the [**Doctor Last Name **] and around the hospital without problems.
She was therefore discharged home without need for Physical Therapy Services.
