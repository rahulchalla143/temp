Admission Date:  [**2171-11-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-12-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-7-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Cipro  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2171-11-12**] Left heart and Right heart cardiac catheterization, coronary abgiography [**2171-11-16**] Extraction of 6 teeth [**2171-11-20**] Coronary artery bypass graft x2(left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal artery), Aortic valve replacement(19mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve),Mitral valve repair(26mm CG Future mitral band).
tracheostomy/percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement [**2171-12-12**]   History of Present Illness: This 69 year old female with dilated cardiomyopathy with LVEF 20-25%, moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis presented for right and left heart cardiac cath in the setting of prorressively worsening dyspnea and fatigue.
She did not want to have cardiac cath and she was lost of follow-up.
Crackles at bases with intermittent wheezes as well.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
Mechanical aortic valve prosthesis (AVR).
POST-CPB: A mechanical valve is seen in the aortic position.
The patient is on milrinone, vasopressin, norepinephrine and epinephrine infusions.
Brief Hospital Course: Following admission she was diuresed with a Lasix drip at 10-15 mg/min which was then switched to torsemide.
She was treated with cefepime as recommended by infectious disease for 3 days peri operatively.
Additionally surgery was delayed due to increased creatinine which peaked at 2.1 on [**1-19**] with BUN 39, the diuretic was held over the next few days and creatinine decreased to 1.6 on [**11-20**] and she was taken to the Operating Room.
She underwent aortic valve replacement, mitral valve repair, and coronary artery bypass graft.
She was taken to the intensive care unit on vasopressin, Milrinone, norepinephrine and Propofol.
She remained intubated overnight due to hemodynamic instability and was able to be weaned and extubated on post operative day one.
Additionally her inotropes and pressors were progressively weaned as tolerated and discontinued on Day 3 with stable hemodynamics.
She went into a rapid atrial fibrillation and given an Amiodarone bolus and drip on POD#3.
She converted to a sinus rhythm later in the day and was started on low dose beta blockers.
Hydralazine was started for afterload reduction as blood pressure tolerated (ACE-I was not started due to increased creatinine.)
On POD#4 pacing wires were pulled and she was started on Heparin bridge later that day for mechanical AVR.
Coumadin was initiated and she was anticoagulated to a goal of 2.5-3.5 for mechanical AVR and afib.
She was aggressively diuresed with a Lasix drip due to CXR showing pulmonary edema and respiratory issues.
She was taken off the Lasix drip and started on Spironolactone due to her heart failure.
She had a poor oral intake and she was given Glucerna for additional nutrition support.
She was ultimately reintubated secondary to pulmonary edema and requiring pressor support on [**11-30**].
A temporary hemodialysis line was placed for anticipation of possible dialysis.
She responded to diuresis and never required dialysis.
Vancomycin and Flagyl were given for c.diff treatment.An EGD revealed that the patient likely had oozing from the antral gastritis in the setting of high PTT.
Heparin, initiated for mechanical valve bridging, was held.
A PPI drip was continued along with supportive care.
On [**2171-12-12**] she underwent a Percutaneous tracheostomy tube and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement/Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.
Nutrition was consulted for tube feed recommendations.
She continued on antibiotics for C-Diff and surveillance cultures were followed.
Her amiodarone was increased for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and ultimately on POD# 21 she converted back into normal sinus rhythm.
Three negative c. diff cultures were obtained after treatment was discontinued and precautions were stopped.
