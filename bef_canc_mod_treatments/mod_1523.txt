Brief Hospital Course: 59 yr old female with hx of IgA deficiency and multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerances admitted with worsening nasal cellulitis and GI intolerance of her antibiotic regimen.
She presented with cellulitis on the tip of her nose for which she had been given minocycline as an oupatient.
Unfortunately, the patient had been having worsening of the appearance of her nose as well as increasing GI intolerance while on minocycline therapy.
She was initially treated with vancomycin, but the primary team hoped to find a simpler regimen the patient could take at home.
Given her history of multiple infections and multiple antibiotic intolerances the infectious disease service was consulted and recommended nafcillin desensitization in the ICU with transition to dicloxacillin for discharge.
She was transitioned to dicloxacillin and discharged with plan to complete a 14 day course of therapy.
2) Right Upper Quadrant Pain: The patient had a normal right upper quadrant ultrasound and presentation and normal transaminases and bilirubin so this was presumed to simply be part of her GI intolerance syndrome to minocycline.
The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms improved during her first and second day in the hospital off minocycline but then began to worsen again, presumably secondary to nafcillin therapy.
This was alleviated somewhat simethicone but other symptomatic therapies were not possible as the patient has a history of intolerances to almost all anti-emetics and anti-diarrheals including ondansetron, lomotil, and immodium.
Eventually, she was put on lorazepam with some improvement of her nausea.
The patient had been on IV fluids but eventually these were discontinued and the patient, despite complaints of considerable diarrhea, did not appear dehydrated and in fact had improved creatinine from presentation.
She was eating and drinking despite abdominal complaints.
Given there was no further indication for hospitalization as she was tolerating a PO diet and there was no suspicion of a dangerous etiology of her GI symptoms she was discharged with encouragement to keep up good PO intake and  use probiotics for GI symptoms.
This resolved with IV fluids and required no further management.
She was not put on SC heparin as she has a history of easy bleeding but did ambulate TID as she was asked by the primary team.
