He received IV antibiotics while inpatient.
On [**6-28**], he was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 55**], given oxycodone for pain and lasix for volume overload, becoming increasingly lethargic and sustained another fall on [**7-14**].
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2112-7-17**] very dehydrated, received 5L NS in the ED (T102, BP90/49, HR103, O293%RA), and was found to develop MRSA sepsis.
He was intubated and on pressors in the MICU.
He was covered broadly with Vanco, Zosyn, and Levofloxacin and narrowed to Vancomycin when he grew MRSA in [**7-18**] bottles.
TEE could not be performed and PICC was placed for planned 6 week course of vancomycin for empiric treatment of MRSA bacteremia.
Studies were sent and he was empirically started on PO Flagyl on [**8-6**].
On the night of [**2112-8-8**], Medicine [**Hospital1 **] team signout was concerned about EKG changes (STE in III and AVF with reciprocal depression in I and AVL felt to be underlying artifacts given his lack of CP - per cardiology).
He recieved multiple fluid boluses.
He did not tolerate neb treatment and no response to 20mg IV lasix, and then 40mg IV lasix.
Peri-intubation he was hypotensive down to 50/30 mmHg, received fluids via PICC.
He was started on dopamine initially but did not respond, then he was switched to levophed.

Brief Hospital Course: 83 yoM with complicated PMH and recent MICU admission for MRSA sepsis presents from Rehab (NBOTC) with fever, diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration.
He was treated for dehydration with repeated IVF bolus and presumed c. diff.
He was intermittently hypotensive, and required repeated iv fluid boluses and nebs.
He recieved multiple fluid boluses.
He did not tolerate neb treatment and 20mg IV lasix did not touch him.
Then 40mg IV lasix was given.
He was started on dopamine initially but did not respond, then he was switched to levophed and transferred to the MICU.
The MICU course over the ensuing 24 hours was characterized by increasing mechanical ventilator demand and dependence, increasing vasopressor requirement, worsening renal function, worsening coagulopathy, anemia, and neurological unresponsiveness.
With the progressive overall clinical decline and multisystem organ failure, the family (including wife health care proxy and four children) expressed that the continued invasive interventions (including intubation and mechanical ventilatino) were not consistent with the patient's previously expressed wishes, and the decision was made to focus care primarily on comfort.
