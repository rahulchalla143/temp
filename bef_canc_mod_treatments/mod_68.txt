He completed an 18 day course of vancomycin to treat sputum cultures which grew oxacillin resistant staph aureus.
The patient's antibiotics were then discontinued and the patient remained afebrile without leukocytosis until [**6-14**] when pt developed a temperature to 101.9.
CT imaging of his abdomen revealed multiple abcesses and thus the patient completed a 5 day course of IV vanc/cipro/flagyl/fluconazole during which time his abscess resolved without the need for drainage by IR.
The patient has a history of hypertension and was continued on lisinopril 40 mg qd.
He quickly responds to Lasix for chest pressure d/t CHF.
The patient responded well to IV lasix and upon discharge his peripheral edema was much improved.
Nutrition The patient has had a long convalesence marked by poor po intake resulting a low albumin which contributed to his peripheral edema.
In order to address this the patient's po intake was supplemented with TPN in order to ensure adequate calories.
TPN was supplemented with standard electrolytes, 10U insulin, 10mg zinc, and 40mg Famotidine.
On D/C, we are holding Phos and Mg until these electrolytes normalize.
Using incentive spirometer.
The patient's pulmonary status improved with gentle diuresis along with the use of incentive spirometer.
Anemia: The patient last received 1 U pRBCs on [**6-6**] with appropriate bump in HCT.
ITP: The patient has a history of ITP and was thus continued on 20 mg of prednisone qod with an increase to 20 mg qd when the patient was febrile to prevent adrenal insufficiency.
He has been cleared by both physical therapy and general surgery to begin acute physical therapy and rehabilitation.
