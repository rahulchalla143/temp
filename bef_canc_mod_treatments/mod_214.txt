There is again seen a central venous catheter with tip in the cavoatrial junction from a right IJ entry.
NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
Feeding tube passes to the region of the pylorus or proximal duodenum and, as before I see no weighted tip at the end of the tube which I discussed with the house officer caring for this patient to exclude separation of the tip.
The distal cervical internal carotid arteries measure 5 mm in diameter on the left and 5 mm in diameter on the right.
ROUTINE SAMPLING AND SPIKE AND SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS WERE UTILIZED.
Routine sampling and automated detections showed no epileptiform  features.
EEG Study Date of [**2186-3-9**] FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: The background rhythm was disorganized throughout the record and generally remained with a 6 Hz maximum in most areas.
She was initially admitted to the MICU where she was weaned off levophed with IV fluids and was continued on levoquin and ceftriaxone.
After being off pressors for 48 hours she was transferred to the floors.
She was given ativan and loaded with dilantin and since then she has had much improved strength and is back to baseline mental status.
# Frequent Falls/weakness/AMS- The patient has chronically had frequent falls, and had been evaluated in past and thought her falls were due to peripheral neuropathy from ETOH.
Her levoquin was discontinued as it lowers the seizure threshold and as she completed 3 day course for UTI.
She responded to ativan and she was loaded with dilantin.
She has been started on keppra ([**3-14**] 1st dose) as this may be a better medication for her as dilantin can worsen her bone marrow toxicity.
Once this is reached, her dilantin should be tapered down with the assistance of her neurologist - has outpatient neuro f/u w/ Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]/[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2808**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1726**] on [**2186-3-30**] at 4:30pm, she will arrange outpatient EMG if the patient is still profoundly weak at that point - fall precautions, OOB to chair - cont thiamine/folate - monitor electrolytes (particularly magnesium) every 2-3 days, replete with IV mag .
Per neuro recs we added flexeril as well as a soft cervical collar for comfort.
Her gabapentin can also be increased if necessary.
Once on floor, she did not need any other inverventions and her BPs were 110-120's.
Ceftriaxone was discontinued as PNA was not suspected and she completed a 3 day treatment w/levofloxacin for UTI (started levofloxacin [**3-4**]).
Continue folate and MVI.
Nutrition was consulted and she received tube feeds.
Tubefeeds were discontinued and her NGT was pulled on [**3-13**] as the patient's strength improved and she was able to swallow per speech and swallow eval.
Her magnesium should be followed periodically as above and repleted.
