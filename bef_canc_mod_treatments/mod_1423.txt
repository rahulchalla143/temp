History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 8163**] is a 65 year-old woman with a history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], stroke ([**2121**]), lung cancer s/p chemoradiation, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation who presents from her NH with a history of worsening NIF and weakness.
Her overall post-operative course was complicated by a myasthenia flare requiring MICU stay with intubation x2, plasmapheresis x5 treatments, mestinon and steroids.
She received levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1, methylprednisolone 125 mg IV x 1.
Medications which can exacerbate myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] were held including beta blockers and calcium [**Last Name (un) 21766**] blockers.
Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]: - [**2121**]: diagnosed; closely followed by primary neurologist in [**Location (un) 38**] - mild crisis in the past marked by visual changes (diplopia) and generalized weakness - has been on mestinon 60mg TID for her maintenance and recently prednisone 60mg qd since discharge on [**2122-4-16**] - at baseline, uses wheelchair for any extended travel and walks around the home with a walker most of the time - not really able to perform activities of daily living without substantial support by her husband who is also her primary caretaker 2.
Bilateral knee arthroscopy 12.
Cholecystectomy  Social History: Lives with husband.
Post-surgical changes following prior right frontal burr hole.
Non- opacification of right SFA given recent right femoral endarterectomy.
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with patent aortobiiliac graft without evidence of endoleak.
Due to decreasing NIF and VC she was transferred to the MICU:  This is a 65 year old female with history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], recent prolonged hospital course after MG flare s/p elective AAA repair who is transferred to the MICU for increasing weakness and worsening NIF/Vital Capacity measurements.
Her metoprolol was restarted for atrial fibrillation.
Of note she had recently received Ambien for insomnia.
Sedating medications including Ambien were held.
She was continued on Prednisone, with addition of standing vitamin D and calcium, insulin sliding scale while on prednisone.
She was also continued on Pyridostigmine, Mycophenolate, and Bactrim prophylaxis.
Also her prednisone was decreased to 40mg [**5-1**].
After discussion with transfusion medicine, we decided not to pursue plasmaphoresis for multiple reasons: no fatigability or physical signs of active [**Month/Year (2) 15099**], risks associated with putting phoresis catheter in her right atrium with new onset a. fib, and it would pull off her coumadin and make anticoagulation more difficulty.
We intiated CPAP at night to improve her respiratory mechanics and treat OSA in hopes it would help her fatigue as well.
-Follow NIF and VC [**Month/Year (2) 41412**] daily - Avoid sedating medications as these have been coorelated with poor NIF/VC this admission - Continue cellcept 500mg [**Hospital1 **], prednisone 40mg daily, and pyridostigmine 60mg q8h.
Atrial fibrillation:  Patient with episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation in the setting of holding metoprolol (held due to potential to worsen her Myasthenia).
She was also continued on Digoxin and Coumadin.
On the neurology floor her INR was 1.3 the day prior to and the day of discharge so lovenox subcutaneous was started while INR is subtherapeutic.
She needs to be anticoagulated for A fib and DVT.
- Follow daily INR and adjust coumadin as needed - Continue lovenox while INR is subtherapeutic  #.
Pt began to improve on a 1.5L fluid restriction, and may need a 1L fluid restriction for full improvement.
She has a history of small cell lung cancer (per pt) which can be attributed with SCLC but no neoplasm was seen on CT chest done [**4-7**].
We attributed her SIADH to her moderate to severe COPD which she has on chest CT.  - Continue fluid restriction of 1.5L.
She was maintained on coumadin after that discharge and this was continued here (see A. fib section).
Stauts-post AAA repair: She had a successful repair on [**3-25**].
During plasmapheresis treatment during the prior admission, the patient had developed bleeding from wound.
This was treated with Kelfex which she took for one week after discharge.
On the neurology floor she complained of hip pain and CT pelvis was done to evaluate for hematomas at catheter sites or avascular necrosis given pt's treatment with prednisone.
