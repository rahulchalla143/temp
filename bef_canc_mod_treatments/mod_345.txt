This patient is a 76-year-old man who had a prior partial colectomy with an ileostomy who presented to [**Hospital1 346**] with a parastomal hernia.
It was decided that the patient was going to go to the operating room for repair of this hernia.
The patient was taken to the operating room and repair of the parastomal hernia was performed.
The ileostomy that he had prior had was taken down and a new ileostomy was created.
Intraoperatively, the patient also had a PA catheter placed.
A peritoneal culture at this time subsequently revealed [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans and Clostridium perfringens and other gastrointestinal flora.
On [**6-4**], the patient underwent a second operation because of his recurrent tachycardia and spiking fevers.
This enterotomy was repaired and afterwards the patient was sent back to the intensive care unit.
The patient was intubated after the surgery and remained intubated in the intensive care unit for the next eight days.
As of now, he is tolerating a regular diet and has been weaned off of his parenteral nutrition.
He is also able to ambulate with assistance from his family members, although physical therapy has recommended that the patient should remain at a rehab facility.
In addition, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course is significant for the placement of a vacuum assisted closure device to help with granulation of the previous ostomy site.
He will go home on this vacuum drainage and have services assist with his management.
