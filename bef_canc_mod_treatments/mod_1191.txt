Brief Hospital Course: He was admitted to the Trauma Service for pulmonary care; pain management and anticoagulation for his multiple pulmonary emboli.
He was immediately bolused and started on a Heparin drip.
His Coumadin was started on [**6-9**] at 5 mg and increased to 7.5 mg due to sub therapeutic INR; his last INR on [**6-13**] was 1.5.
Once INR goal range of [**3-7**] reached his Heparin drip can be stopped.
Mr. [**Known lastname 20400**] has a long history with chronic pain requiring long and short acting narcotics at home to manage this.
Both his long and short acting medications were increased; it was noted however that the Oxycodone increased breakthrough dose was not offering much relief for his rib fracture pain.
He had been receiving intermittent IV Dilaudid for severe breakthrough pain and this was stopped and he was changed to oral Dilaudid.
It should be noted that he is requiring larger than usual doses of this medication 12-14 mg every 3-4 hours prn.
His adjunct medications, Neurontin and Topamax were increased.
Tizanidine was added as well.
His oxygen saturations have ranged in the low 90's and he has made very slow progress with Physical therapy who are recommending acute rehab after his hospital stay.
