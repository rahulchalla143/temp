Admission Date:  [**2127-12-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-1-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-2-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11892**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation PICC Placement ([**2128-1-6**])   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 60 year old man with no significant PMH who presents with a one-week history of increasing fatigue, cough, and chest pain.
Per the patient and his [**Month/Day/Year 802**], he was in his normal state of health until approximately 3 weeks ago, when he developed a non-productive cough, congestion/rhinorrhea, and dysphonia.
He has also had subjective chills and was found to have a temperature of 99.0 at home.
He described it as a dull, constant, [**4-20**] pain that was located on the right side of his chest and occasionally radiated to his LLSB.
He was given ASA 325 mg, 1 L of NS and was started on Levofloxacin and Vanc for PNA.
Followup radiographs after interval treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of this finding.
Bronchoscopy with lavage may be helpful .
Since the prior film, there has been interval insertion of a right-sided PICC line with the tip terminating at the right high/mid SVC.
Successful PICC insertion.
While in house, he was originally started on levofloxacin (and received 1 dose).
On HD2, we switched him to IV CTX and Azithromycin.
Usually fluid responsive, and actually received >5L of fluid for tachycardia.
However, given the patient's current lung pathology, SIADH is also on the differential.
With aggressive IVF repletion, pt's sodium normalized to 136. .
Thought is that could stand small dose of beta blocker, however did not start given tachycardia.
# FEN: IVF boluses for tachycardia, regulars, replete lytes # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, no indication for ppi, bowel regimen # Access: peripherals # Code: Full (confirmed) # Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 96454**] [**Name (NI) **] - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 96455**])  <-- informed regarding ICU transfer .
Acute decompensation was thought multifactorial including PNA with superfluous secretions causing mucous plugging.
Since he had clinically deteriorated on ceftriaxone/azithromycin therapy on the floor his antibiotic coverage was broadened to vanco/zosyn/levo and will likely need a prolonged course given the cavitation seen on CT.
On [**1-3**] he has an increase in his ventilator requirements.
Plan for antibiotics will be to complete 10 day course on [**1-8**] and change to PO Augmentin on [**1-9**] for at least 2 week course.
However, in the setting of alcohol consumption and persistent tachycardia, there was some concern as well for DRs.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was kept on Versed gtt initially and then transitioned to Ativan PRN.
# Tachycardia: Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of aggressive infection.
His respiratory status improved and he was weaned off oxygen with SpO2 in the mid to high 90s at rest and stable during ambulation.
He was continued on HCTZ 50 mg PO daily at discharge.
He was oriented only to person, requiring frequent redirection and reorientation, as well as a 1:1 sitter for fall safety.
He was given Olanzapine 5 mg QHS as needed.
# Followup: -- No pending labs or reports -- Followup appointment with his PCP scheduled one week after discharge -- Followup in Pulmonary clinic on [**2128-2-5**] -- Repeat chest imaging and bronchoscopy will be needed to guide further treatment   Medications on Admission: None   Discharge Medications: 1. hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 2. amoxicillin-pot clavulanate 875-125 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) for 14 days: Last dose evening of [**2128-1-26**].

Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 5. thiamine HCl 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
You were found to have a severe pneumonia and required transfer to the Intensive Care Unit and intubation for part of your stay.
You were treated with antibiotics and your condition improved.
You will need to complete a 14 day course of antibiotics and have close followup and repeat imaging to determine whether you will need a longer antibiotic course to completely clear the infection.
START: Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid (Augmentin) 875 mg by mouth twice daily  Your blood pressure was found to be elevated during your stay and you were started on the blood pressure medication Hydrochlorothiazide.
You should continue taking this medication after discharge.
START: Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg by mouth daily START: Multivitamin 1 tab by mouth daily START: Folic Acid 1 mg by mouth daily START: Thiamine 100 mg by mouth daily  You have a followup appointment scheduled with your PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 778**] next Monday.
