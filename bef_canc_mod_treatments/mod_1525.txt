Past Medical History: severe C3-C4 and C6-C7 spinal stenosis Afib (not on coumadin secondary to falls) CAD - '[**52**] BMS to mid RCA, '[**64**] DES to mid RCA Diastolic CHF - [**11-26**] EF 55%, LA mod dilated, mild LVH, RV normal, aortic root mildly dilated, no AS, no AI, trivial MR, mod pHTN PAD - s/p stent to RLE SFA in [**12-26**] Prostate Cancer H/o bladder cancer in [**2166**](s/p local resection) hx of urethral stricture requiring permanent indwelling foley catheter h/o prostate CA (s/p external beam radiation and Lupron injections)  Social History: Currently living at rehab, just discharged today.
A paratracheal curvilinear density on the right is of uncertain etiology.
CXR does show pleural plaques, low O2 sats may be the product of chronic lung disease versus effects of scilent aspiration.
No focal neurologic deficits, and no history of fall, so did not get a head CT.  With holding of meds and addressing ARF, symptoms resolved.
PAD: Recent stent placement to SFA on right to treat non-healing ulcer in [**12-26**].
Persued wound care and continued aspirin and plavix.
Continued aspirin and plavix as above.
The patient has a history of bradycardia, which is likely why he is not maintained on a beta blocker.
Will hold lasix in the setting of acute renal failure.
Not on rate control secondary to bradycardia, not on coumadin secondary to falls.
