Unsuccessful attempt to recanalize the left brachiocephalic vein using a catheter and guidewire technique.
# L facial/arm and breast swelling: Initially this presented only as facial swellingand ACE and [**Last Name (un) **] were held for possible angioedema, however holding medications nad giving benadryl failed to relieve symptoms.
For this reason, the patient was placed on Heparin IV as a bridge to coumadin anticoagulation with goal INR [**2-12**].
Per consult with hematology the patient is to remain on this regimen for at least 6 months, and will then revisit as an outpatient the question of possible lifelong anticoagulation.
The patient has had extensive negative testing for hypercoagulable states, including during this work-up with negative anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid, Beta-2 glycoprotein and AT3 antibodies.
This was communicated tothe patient and she understands and plans to be compliant with frequent blood draws for INR testing and varying her coumadin dose as directed.
The patient received frequent extra doses during her stay (especially of hydralazine), however, this occasionally causes her blood pressure to swing too low to tolerate her subsequent standing dose of medication.
She is discharged on clonidine patch 0.3mg qweek, labetalol 900mg po tid, nifedipine CR 90mg po bid, hydralazine 35mg po tid.
These medications were reviewed extensively with the patient and she was given prescriptions for all meds.
She has purchased a portable BP cuff and will keep a BP diary to bring to subsequent appointments as well.
PD catheter was placed before admission and the patient received morphine prn pain at her catheter site.
Her regimen was changed to calcitriol 0.25mcg po qday, sodium bicarb 1300mg po qday, cholecalciferol 400units po qday, ergocalciferol 50,000 units po qweek for ten weeks.
# SLE: The patient was maintained on her home dose of prednisone 15mg po qday throughout her stay.
The patient was discharged to home with a clear plan to call [**Doctor First Name 3040**], the PD nurse on the day after discharge to set up an appointment to have her PD catheter flushed later this week, as well as to set a date to start her PD.
She will have her blood drawn for INR in two days and faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**], subsequently this will be faxed to the [**Company 191**] coumadin clinic and her dose will be adjusted for INR [**2-12**].
We have also given her the phone number to call [**Company 191**] and establish care with a new PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] her old PCP has now graduated and her complex management makes a PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 44540**].
