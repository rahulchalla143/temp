Her urine grew coag-negative staph; one blood Cx showed coag-negative staph; her sputum Cx grew methacillin resistant coag-positive staph, which was a colonizer of her chronic tracheostomy and did not cause her clinical symptoms.
She was initially treated on vanc and cefepime, until the sensitivities came back, after which the cefepime was discontinued.
The patient will continue to receive the vancomycin for a 10 day course ending on [**2145-8-17**].
We kept her on her trach mask during the day with vent support PRN at night.
She was transitioned from ventilator support to vent use prn and did not require the vent during hospitalization.
She has been treated with triamcinolone which was continued and the [**Name2 (NI) **] looked improved upon discharge.
She did not need a PICC, because the rehab facility could do IV antibiotics through a PIV.
