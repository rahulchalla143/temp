Of note, she is currently on nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for a UTI (?
She was originally on peripheral dopamine for BP improvement but as this was not effective, it was changed to peripheral levophed with subsequent improvement in blood pressures to 120s systolic.

Successful CT-guided aspiration of approximately 1 cc of bloody pus from the left parasacral/left gluteal collection.
Chest x-ray PA and lateral ([**2137-11-16**]) There are multiple healed rib fractures from prior thoracotomy on the left, with residual osseous deformity.
Right PICC terminates in the superior vena cava.
Brief Hospital Course: A 72 year-old woman with past medical history notable for paraplegia secondary to spinal artery infarct, COPD, and indwelling suprapubic catheter admitted with mental status change, fever, and leukocytosis.
Overnight, she was started on vancomycin and cefepime for empiric coverage of sepsis from UTI versus other source, such as large stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer.
Thus the vancomycin was continued and cefepime discontinued on hospital day 3.
Her suprapubic catheter was changed in the ICU.
Vancomycin was continued.
She will need to complete a six-week course of vancomycin (last day will be [**12-24**]) for treatment of osteomyelitis.
A right PICC line has been placed for this purpose.
She had been started on fluconazole in the unit and her suprapubic catheter changed.
Plastics, consulted in the ED, recommended wet-to-dry dressing changes three times daily, with frequent turning and kinair bed.
Patient was started on zinc/vitamin c/mvi and nutritional supplements to ensure adequate wound healing.
Interventional radiology drained this abscess percutaneously under CT-guidance.
She will continue IV vancomycin as above for a total six week course.
Initially she required oxygen in the ED and overnight in the ICU.
We continued her home COPD regimen of inhaled steroids and bronchodilators, and her oxygen saturation steadily improved.
Paraplegia s/p spinal artery infarct.
We continued her outpatient calcium, vitamin D, and fosamax.
She was kept on subcutaneous heparin for venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
