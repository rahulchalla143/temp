Brief Hospital Course: MICU Green Course  78 year old female with h/o meningioma c/b sroke and respiratory failure in [**1-31**] who presents on [**2105-12-7**] from NH with UTI, HCAP, [**Last Name (un) **], likely demand ischemia, c/w septic shock now resolved with abx and fluids.
Possible etiologies of Ms [**Known lastname 90127**] septic shock included HCAP given infiltrate on CXR and UTI.
In the MICU, she was treated and became hemodynamically stable on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Cefepime (started on [**2105-12-7**]).
She received fluid resuscitation with MAP goal 55.
No central line or pressors were given per goals of care.
Her vancomycin, cefepime and levoquin was continued for an 8 day course for HCAP to end on [**2105-12-15**].
Given a negative urine legionella antigen test, her foley was subsequently pulled.
This was most likely secondary to free water deprivation in setting of fevers and insensible losses, and also possibly secondary to tube feed interruptions.
Ms. [**Known lastname 46555**] was volume repeleted via tube feeds and her hypernatremia subsequently resolved.
She was monitored closely and given oral suction Q4H.
#) Hypoxemia: This was most likely a manifestation of multifocal pneumonia/hcap and stabilized above 95% on [**12-25**] L NC.
Ms [**Known lastname 46555**] was given 10mg IV lasix piror to transfer to the floor because of a CXR indicating some pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid resucittation.
She did require Q4H superficial suction and oral care for her secretions, but no deep suction in >48 hours.
CHRONIC ISSUES:  #) Hypertension: Ms [**Known lastname 46555**] 's metoprolol was held initially but then subsequently restarted and converted to a long acting regimen.
Lisinopril was held prior to discharge.
#) Seizure disorder: Continued levetiracetam 1000mg liquid per g tube qAM, 1500mg qPM  #) Meningioma with stroke: Continued tube feeds  #) Atrial Fibrillation: Continued asa 325mg daily and restarted metoprolol  #) GERD: Continued omeprazole  #) Goals of care: She was confirmed DNR/DNI by her HCP/son [**Name (NI) 449**].
I explained to him given her bedbound status, 4 bed sores, and poor mental status she was at high risk for readmission for HCAP, urosepsis, or wound infection.
