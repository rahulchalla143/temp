O2 saturation 96% on an unknown amount of oxygen, which became 100% on 100% nonrebreather.
The patient was given Ceftriaxone, Vanco and Tylenol and intravenous fluids times 4 liters of normal saline.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for C section, cholecystectomy, ovarian cancer in [**2131-9-29**], status post TAH/BSO, omentectomy, ileocolectomy complicated by a perforation of the anastomosis in [**2131-12-29**], which led to peritonitis and resection and a perihepatic abscess and a new ileostomy.
Status post PEG removal on the last admission.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes rash.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Risperdal 0.5 mg po q.a.m.
Magnesium oxide 400 mg po q.i.d., Epogen 40,000 units q week, aspirin 81 mg po q.d., heparin subQ, Protonix 40 mg po q.d., Allopurinol 100 mg po q.d., [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg po b.i.d., B-12 1000 mg IM q month, Levaquin 500 mg po q.d.
times two days, Bactroban, MVI, Lopressor 12.5 po b.i.d., Neurontin 600 mg po t.i.d.
and Acyclovir 450 q 8 hours times seven days.
She was begun on antibiotics with Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin and Flagyl given her history of MRSA, pneumonia and aspiration.
A PICC line was placed for long term Vancomycin administration.
Her beta blocker was held.
Intravenous fluids were given.
Her hypotension improved and her beta blocker was restarted.
On approximately [**6-4**] to [**6-5**] the patient had an episode of four beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, however, this was in the setting of the patient being off of beta blocker and it was noted that the patient's electrolytes were not within normal limits.
She was continued on Vancomycin, Flagyl and Ceftriaxone.
The patient received a transthoracic [**Year (4 digits) 461**] to look for possible endocarditis.
She was continued only on Vancomycin and Flagyl for pneumonia.
Ceftriaxone was discontinued.
Pneumonia treatment continued as above.
Cardiovascular:  For the patient's rhythm and episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, no further episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurred when the patient was restarted on her beta blocker and magnesium and potassium were repleted.
However, the patient did have frequent ectopy and occasional couplets of premature ventricular contractions.
It was thought that this could be secondary to heparin induced thrombocytopenia and heparin flushes were discontinued.
The patient continued to appear depressed with flattened affect, but her psychiatric medications were not restarted.
Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient required repletion of magnesium and potassium on several occasions as well as phosphorus.
Routine PICC line care with no heparin flushes.
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
