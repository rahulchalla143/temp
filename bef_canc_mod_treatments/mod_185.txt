CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post cardiac arrest.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 16762**] is a 73-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for CAD, status post three vessel CABG in 3/00 with non Q wave MI in [**7-29**], status post proximal LAD OM1 stenting with PTCA of the left circ, also with metastatic renal cell cancer status post bilateral nephrectomy, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia.
He underwent CABG [**3-/2163**] with SVG to the LAD, SVG to the PDA and SVG to the D1.
Also had a pericardectomy at that time.
Nuclear images showed inferior apical lateral partially reversible perfusion defects with global hypokinesis in the context of preoperative for right nephrectomy he underwent elective cardiac cath [**8-17**] and [**8-20**] which showed an LVEDP of 30 mmHg, severe native three vessel disease, sequential 50% and 70% proximal LAD with small aneurysm proximal to D1, severely diseased D1 with twin LAD up to 95% proximal stenosis, rotablated PTCA stent in origin of the mid C1, left circ 90% proximal, 40% diffuse in the lesions, proximal lesion involving OM1 origin, SVG 100% proximal discrete lesions times three.
Cath [**8-20**], left circ intervention, PTCA stent OM1 with rescue PCA left circ, 70% stenosis distal to proximal LAD stent, PTCA stent of LAD.
He underwent adrenal sparing right nephrectomy [**2164-10-5**].
Today the patient went to hemodialysis, had substernal chest pain and noted one episode prior to that evening, relieved with sublingual Nitroglycerin.
He was placed on an Amnio drip and intubated for airway protection.
He had PTCA and kissing balloons of the left circ and OM1 lesions, also had PTCA of the LAD and D1 lesions.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD status post three vessel CABG in 3/00, systolic heart failure, recent [**State 531**] Heart Association class II, EF 20-25%,renal cell carcinoma, status post left nephrectomy in [**2153**] with high dose IL-2 for pulmonary mets [**2153**], status post resection of penile recurrence [**2158**], right renal mass in [**2162**], status post IL-2 low dose, acute renal failure secondary to right renal hemorrhage treated with embolization [**3-29**].
GI, he had multiple well healed abdominal scars, nontender, soft, positive bowel sounds.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission sodium 133, potassium 5.6, chloride 95, CO2 23, BUN and creatinine 72/7.7 with glucose of 146, hematocrit 38.1.
The patient underwent brachytherapy on [**12-28**].
He had left circ marginal long overlapping stents redilated with 3.5 by 20 balloon and proximal stent deployed just distal to the left main overlapping the proximal prior stent.
Beta cath brachytherapy delivered to both left circ with overlapping margins and no angiographic mist and delivered to proximal LAD, transient hypotension with both brachytherapies.
He was brought back to the floor on a Dobutamine infusion with a heart rate of 75/minute, no ectopy and systolic blood pressure of 100-120.
He was also placed back on Reo-Pro and Plavix and Aspirin.
The patient was intended to be on Dobutamine for 24 hours and weaned if severely bradycardic.
He was quickly switched to Dopamine and received a normal saline bolus.
The patient subsequently had a Swan Ganz catheter placed which revealed PA pressure 57/23 with a wedge in the 17-19 range, maps at this time were 38-74, CVP was 5, FVR was calculated at 437 with a cardiac output of 6.7.
The morning following the Swan placement the patient had a lower GI bleed which required transfusion of 18 units of packed red blood cells.
The patient had an EGD done by the gastroenterology consult service as he had coffee grounds in his NG lavage and it was thought this could be a rapidly bleeding duodenal source.
It was ultimately determined that the patient had a right groin fistula status post sheath removal which may have contributed to his elevated MBO2 and a potentially falsely elevated cardiac output.
The patient continued to do well after the blood transfusion and weaning of pressors.
Given the patient's fresh stents and brachytherapy, Heparin was introduced 48 hours after the bleed with no bolus and he subsequently had Aspirin and Plavix reintroduced.
From a cardiac standpoint, the patient denied any chest pain throughout the entire hospitalization following his interventions.
The patient will be continued on Aspirin and Plavix in addition to his Coreg which was restarted on [**2165-1-1**].
Given the patient's persistent bradycardia throughout the hospitalization with heart rates in the high 30's to low 40's, a pacemaker was placed on [**2165-1-2**].
Discharge medications:  Aspirin 325 mg po q d, Plavix indefinitely, Coreg 6.25 mg in the morning and 12.5 mg in the evening, Captopril 12.5 mg po tid and the cardiac medications.
Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated for airway protection in the setting of a V fib arrest.
The patient was on assist control throughout the majority of his hospitalization.
He maintained excellent oxygen saturations on room air and was able to work with physical therapy without dropping his saturations.
The patient had mild congestive heart failure and fluid overload on chest x-rays which were subsequently improved after hemodialysis throughout the hospitalization.
The patient was seen by the renal service at [**Hospital1 69**] and had dialysis every other day with removal of several liters of fluid, especially in the setting of 18 units of blood transfused.
The patient had no subsequent episodes of bleeding despite being on Heparin, Aspirin and Plavix.
The patient should be continued on Protonix 40 mg po q day for GI prophylaxis.
Status post V fib arrest, status post MI with two cardiac interventions, catheterization resulting in stenting of multiple vessels as previously indicated with the second procedure on [**12-28**] during which he underwent brachytherapy and redilatation of previous stenotic areas.
Intubation for airway protection.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg po q d, Plavix 75 mg po q d indefinitely, Coreg or Carvedilol 6.25 mg po q a.m. and 12.5 mg po q p.m., TUMS 3 po tid after meals, Lipitor 20 mg po q d, Prednisone 5 mg po q d times two days, then discontinued as part of a steroid taper that was initiated during a hypotensive period, Protonix 40 mg po q d.  The patient should follow-up with GI in [**5-4**] weeks.
