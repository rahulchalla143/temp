Recent Imaging: [**2182-3-26**]: CXR - A dual-lumen right subclavian dialysis catheter and left subclavian central line remain with tips projecting over the junction of the brachiocephalics with the SVC.
The ossibility of acute cholecystitis cannot be excluded with this appearance.
At present the inflated balloon of the urinary catheter lies at the level of the prostate gland rather than within the bladder and needs to be deflated and advanced.
There are surgical skin staples seen posteriorly.
[**2182-2-19**]: PROCEDURE: Under fluoroscopic guidance and aseptic technique, a 16 gauge needle was introduced at the C5 level via a posterior mid-line approach.
A sample of the fluid was sent for various microbiological and biochemical analysis, as requested.
[**2182-2-17**]: MRI brain with contrast: CONCLUSION: Unusual tiny areas of high signal on diffusion-weighted imaging within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, more evident on the left side.
Patient is status post median sternotomy with mediastinal clips.
Surgical staples are seen projecting over the cervical spine with the plate overlying the lateral masses of the lower cervical spine.
NG tube tip is in the stomach.
The endotracheal tube has been removed.
INDICATION: Recent MRSA meningitis, PE, nosocomial pneumonia with spiking fevers.
Air bronchograms and consolidations are still seen, consistent with pneumonia.
The patient is status post CABG with coronary artery calcifications.
Multiple subcentimeter retroperitoneal nodes, none pathologically enlarged by strict CT criteria.
Foley catheter in a nondistended bladder.
BONE WINDOWS: Lytic lesions involving the iliac bones bilaterally, likely site of prior bone graft harvest.
2) Liver and spleen suboptimally evaluated with out IV contrast.
5) Subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
8) Lytic lesions in the iliac bones, likely the site of prior bone graft harvest.
Foley catheter in the non-distended bladder.
Incidental note made of penile prosthetic with indwelling reservoir.
Lytic lesions involving the iliac bones bilaterally represent sites of prior bone graft harvest.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2182-4-23**] 12:53 PM  [**Hospital 5**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 70 year old man with CAD, DM s/p fall complicated by c7 fx, complicated course including MRSA meningitis, CSF leak, MRSA PNA, PE on heparine, Acute renal failure, who is still encephalopathic.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE:  Pt is a 70yM with h/o CAD status post fall on [**2182-1-2**] with R C7 fx s/p ORIF and laminectomy with fusion on [**2182-1-23**] admitted to the SICU on [**2-8**] with sepsis.
The pt was admitted that day to NSGY service, and underwent ORIF C6-7 fracture, laminectomy C6-7 posterior fusion and iliac crest bone graft with wire placement.
He was treated with IV Vanco and CTX.
He then underwent cervical wound exploration repair of CSF leak, removal of C5 spinous process, removal of wires and dural autograft.
Pt was started on Vanco/Ceftazidime with cervical swab [**2-9**] and [**2-13**] growing MRSA.
Flagyl 500mg po q8h was added to his regimen of Ceftaz/Vanco on [**2182-2-13**].
The pt was extubated [**2-15**], and Ceftaz and Flagyl were d/c'd [**2-15**], with Acyclovir IV 5mg/kg q8h being started for perioral HSV.
Neurology was consulted and recommended MRI/MRA brain, repeat LP w/ HSV PCR, echo, and eventually pt was dx with encephalopathy [**1-17**] infection/metabolic.
LP was attempted [**2-18**] --unsuccessful, so LP under fluoro was performed [**2182-2-19**] as well as drainage of C spine fluid collection.
At this pt, the pt was on Vancomycin IV and Acyclovir IV (finished a 7 day course), ended [**2-23**]).
On [**2-22**] the pt went to OR for repair of CSF leak and I&D of cervical wound.
Vancomycin was continued, rifampin added at 300mg po /ng q8h on [**2-23**], and acyclovir was d/c'd (completed course).
Pt failed S&S study, and had PEG placement [**3-1**].
He was transferred to surgical floor on [**2-26**], w/ vanco and rifampin continued.
PICC line placed [**2-28**].
The pt started tube feeds with [**Last Name (un) 616**] following for strict glucose control.
He was noted to have a pulm embolism and was started on heparin gtt and transferred to medicine floor team for further management.
**** Respiratory **** # Respiratory Failure: Upon transfer to MICU, pt found tachypneic to 40's w/ ?altered mental status on shovel mask.
Intubated for management of hyercarbia thought related to meds (narcotics prior to BiPAP and ?resp fatigue).
On heavy sedation and AC ventilation, PH remained in 7.15-7.2 range.
He was treated with Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl for an 8 day course.
He had been off of heparin gtt for a procedure.
It was thought that this did not constitute a failure of anticoagulation and IVC filter was not pursued at the time.
He was started on CVVH and then HD when his BP stabilized for fluid removal.
Patient has been satting 94-95% on Shavel mask since arrival to the floor.
#  PE - Maintained on heparin gtt.
ENT pulled out a bloody crust from the oropharynx and recommended saline nasal sprays, vaseline to nares and humidified O2.
**** Cardiovascular **** # Hypotension/Hypertension: Although initially normotensive in the micu following intubation patient developed hypotension requiring max doses of Levophed as well as vasopressin.
He was weaned off pressors and after transfer to the floor was hypertensive and started on Metoprolol, Amlodipine.
Anticoagulated with heparin gtt which may be transitioned to coumadin.
# NSTEMI: Has h/o CAD, s/p 3V CABG in [**2145**].
Maintained on ASA, BB (once off pressors).
LDL was low and statin was deffered.
ACE inhibitor started on [**2182-4-14**] once renal function had improved.
Ace inhibitors started on [**2182-4-14**].
# Arrythmias: Pt had an episode of a bradycardic junctional rhythm [**3-18**] as he was having TTE performed.
Aggressive search for a source of infection was unrevealing which included RUQ US, repeat LP, MRI/CT of C-spine, MRI head, and multiple blood, urine and stool cultures.
His abx regimen was broadened to Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl per ID recs.
Rifampin was discontined given concerns about generalized erythrodermic rash, peripheral eosinohilia and urine eosinophilia concerning for a drug hypersensitivity reaction.
Zosyn was d/c'd on [**3-23**] and Vanco was switched to linezolid on [**3-26**].
After transfer to the floor he was continued on linezolid and remained afebrile for several days and then spiked again on [**4-3**].
Fevers resolved.Patient compleated 59 days of linezolid and was switch to doxicicline on [**2182-4-23**].
Blood cx on [**2182-4-15**] showed [**Female First Name (un) **], patient was started on Caspo and then switch to voriconazol given elevated Alk phoph and LDH.
He should continue on doxacicline indefinite for suppresion therapy.
He was weaned off all sedatives and remained minimally responsive for several days.
His mental status has wax and wainin thought to be multifactorial.
He will continue on MRSA therapy indefinite.
Neurology and orthospine following patient.
Neurosurgery was consulted and they recommended continuing antibiotics and a repeat MRI in 4 weeks.
***MRSA Meningitis with cervical stablizing hardware: Cont Linezolid (start [**3-26**] to be continued until ID appt [**4-30**], switched to PO [**4-6**]) Day 58-  switched  to suprresion therapy on [**2182-4-23**] with doxicicline.
Etiology thought to represent sequalae of septic shock and interstitial nephritis given urine eos.
He had a right subclavian temporary HD line placed [**3-21**] and was started on CVVH and then transitioned to HD on [**3-25**].
Also started on Calcium Carbonate/Renagel for phos binders.
His renal function improved and patient started making urine and was HD was discontinued.
On day of d/c creatinine 1.3, good urine output.
will consider swithch to renal (low K) tube feeding formula if K persist trending up.
Caspo switched to voraconazol [**1-17**] hepatic dysfunction.
Dermatolgy has evaluated and thought to represent delayed hypersensitivity drug eruption with unknown precipitant given many drug regimen changes around this time.
He was started on Bactroban ointment for these lesions.
After medication changes rash improved slowly.
**** Endocrine **** # Diabetes: In the ICU required insulin gtt and was taken off insulin gtt on [**3-26**].
[**Last Name (un) 616**] followed patient and glargine dose adjusted based on fasting sugars.
Please follow attached insulin sliding scale and adjust as necessary.
He required PRBC tranfusion on [**3-19**].
He was also started on Epotein and dose titrated up.
# Access: Picc line place by IR [**2182-4-23**] .
Family feels that when patient is off all sedation/narcotics, afebrile and hemodynamically stable, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is able to communicate with them at a near-baseline functional level.
Medically, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is stable will finish out the remaining 14 days of antifungal therapy and will continue on MRSA suppressive therapy.
He will also continue on Heparin for his PE as his HCT is stable and his repeat CT of his RP bleed is stable.
