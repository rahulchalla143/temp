In summary he had: Redo sternotomy, replacement of ascending aorta and hemiarch using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest with a 30-mm Vascutek Dacron tube graft, catalog number [**Serial Number 102644**], lot number [**Serial Number 102645**], serial number [**Serial Number 102646**].
He tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
Heparin was initiated as a bridge to coumadin for his mechanical valves.
By the time of discharge on POD #7 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
