She was referred for coronary angiogram after having an "abnormal EKG" at Dr.[**Name (NI) 9654**] office.
The patient was admitted for pre-cath hydration given her Cr of 1.8.
Past Medical History: Aortic stenosis (valve area 0.5 in [**2198**]) s/p mechanical aortic valve replacement [**8-4**] Afib s/p cardioversion HTN GERD thyroid nodules/thyroid goiter peripheral neuropathy degenerative joint disease sciatica chronic bilateral pleural effusions s/p cholesterol emboli to left eye in [**2188**] (per patient)- Started on Coumadin at that time s/p tonsillectomy s/p laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy for benign ovarian mass [**1-3**] s/p cholecystectomy [**7-7**] s/p right hammer toe surgery [**8-6**]   Social History: Tobacco: Denies currently; 45 year history of smoking ~2 cigarettes/day.
4- Successful revasculrrization of a chronically occluded (recanalized) right renal artery, stented with a 5.0x18 mm Genesis Aviator stent with excellent result.
5- Return for LCX intervention on Thursday after hydration FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Successful stenting of right renal artery with Aviator stent.
Return to cath lab for LCX intervention on Thursday [**2202-4-29**] after hydration  CXR AP [**2202-4-27**]: IMPRESSION: New left mid lung opacity, concerning for pneumonia.
Recommend followup radiograph in 4 weeks following treatment to assess for resolution.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LCX with two overlapping Vision BMSs 3.
Monitor renal function, continue with Mucomyst and hydration (add lasix to maintain urine output of 100 cc/hour) 6.
Continue medical therapy  CARDIAC CATH [**2202-5-4**]: 1.
Pt needed cardiac cath but renal functions following renal artery stenting was elevated.
Patient maintained on nitrodrip while renal functions improved.
Overnight in the CCU the patient had more chest pain and concerning EKG changes which prompted a second cardiac catheterization on [**2202-5-4**] where she underwent a [**Hospital1 2177**] also placed in the LAD.
She then remained on Aspirin 325mg PO daily after which was switched to 81mg PO daily upon starting heparin and coumadin (pt also on plavix 75).
The patient was also started on atorvastatin 40 (not 80 due to ARF).
Instead they recommended Lasix gtt, which resulted in pt slowly starting to make urine.
Unfortunately, the patient developed hyponatremia thought to be secondary to diuresis from lasix and this was discontinued.
Electrolytes remained grossly normal except for hyperphos and hypermag which remained stable.
Pt was aggressively fluid restricted down to 1L/day and heparin drip D5W solution was changed to NS and sodium improved on its own.
Diuresis was also thought to wait given the patient's resolving ARF.
No endoscopy or colonoscopy in our system.
Bleeding is in the setting of being on a heparin drip.
# History of AS s/p mechanical AVR: patient was maintained on heparin drip for most of her admission because warfarin was held for procedures.
Pump:  history of AS s/p mechanical AVR in [**2199**].
Patient does not have baseline BNP for comparison.
Patient was maintained on heparin drip for mechanical AVR while warfarin was held because of need for procedures.
No prolonged diuresis was attempted.

Renal Artery Stenosis:  Patient with severe 95% R renal artery stenosis now s/p stenting on [**2202-4-26**].
Creatinine worsened in setting of cardiac and renal angiogram, may have been due to IV contrast, embolized plaque from stenting, newly started antibiotics, hypoperfusion of kidneys from hypotension.
Hypertension: patient was controlled on carvedilol .
Changed to ranitine given need for plavix .
Thyroid nodules/thyroid goiter:  Continued on home Levothyroxine.
