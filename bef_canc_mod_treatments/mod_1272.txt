His procedure was complicated by ventricular fibrillatoni arrest which requierd 2 shocks.
During that admission he was noted to have persistent large pleural effusions but was not considered a candidate for pleurex catheter placement given his need for aspirin and plavix.
He was started on digoxin and underwent scheduled dialysis and was discharged home.
He initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] where he received plavix, cefepime and vancomycin and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
There was initially concern for pulmonary embolism but the patient refused heparin gtt and CTA.
Antibiotics were discontinued on admission.
He underwent right sided thoracentesis on [**2102-5-29**] complicated by the development of a small basilar pneumothorax.
600 cc serosangionous fluid was removed and fluid studies were consistent with transudate.
He underwent hemodialysis on [**2102-5-29**] and [**2102-5-30**] with blood pressures ranging from 90s to 100s systolic.
He was evaluated by thoracic surgery for potential VATS decortication and pleurodesis and was felt not to be a surgical candidate.
He had a right EJ 18 g placed and received 2 L normal saline bolus and was transferred to the MICU.
He did not receive antibiotics prior to MICU transfer.
Peripheral dopamine is currently running at 20 mcg/kg/min with blood pressures in the 70s systolic.
He had a left sided subclavian line placed.

Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE, BY PROBLEM: 65 year old male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF > 60%), CAD s/p CABG in [**2079**] and STEMI [**2102-5-19**] with three stents placed, ESRD on hemodialysis s/p failed transplant and known chronic bilateral pleural effusions with associated trapped lung who was admitted to the hospital with NSTEMI in the setting of a recent STEMI with stent placement.
He required initially dopamine and levophed.
Patient was ablee to be liberated from dopamine fairly rapidly after MICU admission.
Patient on low dose prednisone and random cortisol yesterday was 11.5.
His blood pressures improved on vanco and zosyn and he was weaned off levo without complications.
He was continued on a course of vanco and zosyn for HAP.
He was initially started on stress dose steroids and then tapered appropriately.
On [**6-2**] he was completely off pressors with stable blood pressure.
Hemodialysis was reinitiated and he tolerated it well.
With abx treatment, his oxygen requirement was weaned down to 3L by nasal cannula and dyspnea is resolved.
Given his need for aspirin and Plavix, in addition to the loculations of the left pleural effusion, interventional pulmonary and thoracics did not think he was a surgical candidate.
#Coronary Artery Disease: s/p recent posterior MI with PCI and three vision stents complicated by vfib arrest requiring shocks.
He was continued on ASA, plavix and his statin through his hospital course but his antihypertensives were held after he became hypotensive, and restarted (carvedilol and isosorbide).
# Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: He was continued on carvedilol (at lower dose, prescription provided) once his blood pressures could tolerate them.
Digoxin was discontinued during this hospitalization, with the thought that it might be worsening his heart failure.
Aggressive fluid removal via HD was attempted but was not particularly successful.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient was put on heparin gtt as well as ASA/plavix through his hospital course.
His anticoagulation was initially discontinued, and warfarin was restarted on [**6-4**].
He was then restarted on coumadin on [**6-2**] (2mg daily).
Digoxin was discontinued as above.
# ESRD on HD s/p failed transplant:  HD started back on [**6-2**] once he was liberated from pressor requirement.
He was continued on sevelamer and fluconazole.
Patient continued on home allopruinol 100mg PO.
He was treated with fluconazole without complications.
