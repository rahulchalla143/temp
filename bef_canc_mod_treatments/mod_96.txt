DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post left internal carotid artery aneurysm coiling on [**2116-6-2**].
Status post thyroid carcinoma.
SPOT was 97 percent on four liters of nasal cannula.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2116-6-2**], the patient was given a ventricular drain to relieve pressure of his subarachnoid hemorrhage.
He was prepped and draped and drain was placed for 7 cm.
His vent drain was kept at 15 and he was given Ancef for drain prophylaxis.
Endocrinology saw the patient on [**2116-6-3**] and agreed that he should continue on his Levoxyl dose of 175 mg q.
Plan was to start Impact with fiber and nasogastric tube.
On the same day, [**6-19**], the patient was prepped for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.
His tracheostomy was a number 7 Portex tracheostomy.
Tracheostomy site was intact.
The patient was placed on Cefazolin  one gram q.
Continue to follow blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid cultures.
The patient continued to spike fevers and had difficulty with his tracheostomy and CTA showed bilateral large pulmonary effusions.
The patient was followed throughout his course by infectious disease and was placed on Vancomycin, Cefazolin and Flagyl.
They continued to follow cerebrospinal fluid cultures, sputum cultures, blood cultures and urine cultures.
The patient was continued on Cefazolin and started on 4 mg intrathecal Gentamycin q.
On [**2116-6-28**], infectious disease said that the patient still had pseudomonas meningitis and was being treated with systemic Cefazolin and intrathecal Gentamycin.
He was to be continued on Vancomycin and Flagyl for now.
Infectious disease had advised to add Gentamycin systemically; watch the fever specifically with Gentamycin intrathecally as inflammatory reaction could cause this.
They advised to continue Vancomycin and Flagyl empirically and continue Ceptaz for pseudomonas and consider repeat chest x-ray if still with fevers.
intrathecal Gentamycin, systemic Gentamycin, Vancomycin and Flagyl.
On [**7-8**], on the advice of infectious disease, intrathecal Gentamycin was discontinued, continue Ceptaz.
At this time, the patient is being considered for ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
On [**2116-7-10**], the patient had a lumbar drain placed and the patient was prepped and draped in the usual way, positioned and a lumbar drain was placed without complications at L3, L4.
The patient's final shunt cerebrospinal fluid profile prior to discontinuing drain was quite benign and initial lumbar puncture soon after, we discontinued the drain.
There was concern to the infectious disease people that prior antibiotics were not adequately distributed throughout cerebrospinal fluid.
Infectious disease felt that nosocomial meningitis regimen should be reinstituted.
This lumbar drain was placed so that we could start IT Gentamycin regimen should be reinstituted.
This lumbar drain was placed so we could start IT Gentamycin via lumbar drain.
8 hours intravenously and restart intrathecal Gentamycin via lumbar drain, 4 mg q.
Also felt to start intravenous Gentamycin at the same dose, 180 mg q.
Neurosurgery would like to place a ventriculoperitoneal shunt when all cultures are negative.
Endocrine follow-up on [**2116-7-16**], patient still with nosocomial meningitis.
Beta blocker to keep heart rate around 60.
Patient on subcutaneous heparin, Dilantin, gastrointestinal prophylaxis.
Renal failure starting 10 to 12 days after beginning high dose Gentamycin, in the setting of Vancomycin and fevers consistent with Gentamycin toxicity.
Suggest hold ace inhibitors for now.
Vancomycin [**Hospital1 **] levels less than 15.
Intravenous Gentamycin was discontinued and would also consider changing intrathecal Gentamycin to other [**Doctor Last Name 360**] as even small systemic penetration will up his total Gentamycin dose that accumulates and, if this is Gentamycin toxicity, it can take days to weeks after discontinuing Gentamycin to see resolution.
Renal attending agreed with this and states that he has been on intravenous Gentamycin for treatment of meningitis for two courses.
Agreed that he has ATN due to prerenal Gentamycin toxicity, renal function can be very slow to recover with Gentamycin toxicity.
On [**7-20**], renal consult, Gentamycin toxicity leading to mild acute renal failure, is improving slowly.
On [**2116-7-22**], the patient had completed 14 days of Vancomycin and intrathecal Gentamycin course on antibiotics to be discontinued today.
Antibiotics to be discontinued today.
Check lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid culture off antibiotics ideally for a few days and then place ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
Protein was decreasing.
The patient was brought to the operating room for ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement.
On [**2116-7-30**], the patient was taken to the operative suite for ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement.
Ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed without complication and he was sent to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.
