Syncope a month prior to admission with increasing dyspnea on exertion ultimately led to preoperative evaluation for probable valve replacement.
PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:  Hodgkin's disease, status post XRT and lymphadenectomy.
Status post median sternotomy, T&A as a child.
She had a left mastectomy with reconstruction for cancer back in [**Month (only) 404**]  [**2121**].

She underwent a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] #19 aortic valve repair on [**2123-8-24**].
She left the operating room off cardiopulmonary bypass with EF noted to be greater than 55%, mean arterial pressure was 70.
She was on nitro and Propofol.
She left with a right radial line and right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter, two ventricular leads, two atrial leads, two mediastinal chest tubes.
Intermittently she was on Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure management, but thereafter when off this she became relatively hypotensive after she recovered from bypass.
She was on a Nipride drip and nitroglycerin drip for blood pressure control.
She was given a liter of Hespan and a liter bolus of crystalloid to assist her with her relative hypotension.
She was transfused a unit of packed cells for the hematocrit of 23, started on Coumadin for her valve.
