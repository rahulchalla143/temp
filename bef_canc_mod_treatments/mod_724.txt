You were admitted for infection in your legs and you were also found to have low blood pressure requiring brief care in the intensive care unit.
For your leg infection, we treated you with antibiotics and you will complete a 14-day course.
We also performed aggressive wound care on your legs to help keep the wounds clean and dry.
We made the following changes to your medication: We STARTED Vancomycin - 1 g every 8 hours for leg infection to be taken for 9 more days - last day is [**12-5**].
We CONTINUED Coumadin - it is important for you to have your INR routinely checked.
We STOPPED torsemide because of low blood pressure - this medication may need restarted if you begin to have more swelling in your legs or abdomen We STARTED oxycontin and oxycodone for pain -> these are very powerful pain medications and you should take the lowest possible dose necessary.
This medications should be weaned when your legs begin to heal.
