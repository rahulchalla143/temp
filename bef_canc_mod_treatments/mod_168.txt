There, she was lavaged, fluid bolused, and a CT scan with oral contrast (no IV contrast due to creatinine of 3).

The insulin drip was stopped at 2 am on the 7th, and she was switched to RISS.
Her sugars were then controlled with NPH insulin and eventually [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] 18 units due to some high glucose levels throughout her course.
She will then resume her previous insulin regimen.
