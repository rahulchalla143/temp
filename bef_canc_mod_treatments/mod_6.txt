Admission Date:  [**2177-11-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2177-12-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2114-2-8**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old male with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, status post right pneumonectomy in [**2175-1-26**], complicated by pulmonary artery laceration, status post transtracheal catheter placement for oxygen and suctioning who was in his usual state of health until [**2177-11-24**] when he developed nausea, lower abdominal pain, and projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis.
Attempts to place a nasogastric tube in the Emergency Department were unsuccessful.
While in the Emergency Department, he was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and got 2 mg of subcutaneous Vitamin K.  The patient was admitted to the Medicine Floor.
The nasogastric tube was placed on the floor with nasogastric lavage negative for fresh blood.
Workup while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit included two esophagogastroduodenoscopies, both without fresh blood or old blood but demonstrating a single raised 5 to 7 cm esophageal nodule on an erythematous base at approximately 25 cm.
He was stabilized with a total of seven units of packed red blood cells, seven units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit of platelets.
He also received intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline.
Internal hemorrhoids were noted but no stigmata of recent bleeding.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, this is a 63 year old male with past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy in [**2175-1-26**] complicated by a pulmonary artery laceration, status post transtracheal catheter placement for oxygen and suctioning.
Anemia secondary to acute blood loss - The patient's gastrointestinal workup included two esophagogastroduodenoscopies and colonoscopy times one without source of frank bleed.
After stabilization in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with blood products, fresh frozen plasma and platelets, he was transferred to the Medicine Floor after having stable hematocrit for greater than 24 hours.
All told the patient received 7 units of packed red blood cells, 7 units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit of platelets during his hospital stay.
On [**2177-12-3**], the patient underwent repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy in order to obtain biopsy samples of the esophageal nodule, not noted on previous study.
While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient also had workup for hemolysis to evaluate whether hemolysis could be attributing to his anemia.
He had a normal left ventricular hypertrophy, haptoglobin and bilirubin on admission, however, making hemolysis a very unlikely explanation for his presentation hematocrit of 19.
Hemolysis laboratory data were checked several days into his hospital course and were consistent with changes status post large volume transfusion with no evidence of active ongoing hemolysis.
In light of his recent bleeding episode, anticoagulation was held initially.
Although upper extremity deep vein thromboses do not embolize as often as lower extremity deep vein thromboses, there was still a very high concern for pulmonary embolus in light of the patient's history of right pneumonectomy and the functionality of his one remaining lung.
In particular there was concern that the patient might have an obstructing mass lesion or fibrosis-post his pneumonectomy that could be contributing to venous stasis and obstruction leading to deep vein thrombosis formation.
The patient is likely hypercoagulable as evidenced by the development of this right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis spontaneously after being off anticoagulation in the setting of his acute bleed for only several days, there was concern for recurrent deep vein thromboses.
Therefore, an inferior vena cava filter was placed on [**2177-12-2**].
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
However, as the patient already had an inferior vena cava filter placed and delineation of a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis would not change management plans at all, the decision was made not to undergo ultrasound doppler imaging of the right lower extremity.
His INR should be checked remotely at the rehabilitation facility and his Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly for a goal INR of 2 to 3.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/lung carcinoma status post right pneumonectomy - The patient was continued on aggressive regimen of chest physical therapy and pulmonary toilet.
He was continued on antibiotic prophylaxis with Bactrim Double Strength in light of his history of bronchiectasis.
He was monitored for acute decompensation and his respiratory status, particularly concerning for pulmonary embolism in light of his right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.
He was diuresed gently after arriving to the Medicine Floor status post fluid resuscitation and blood product administration in the Medical Intensive Care Unit in the setting of his acute bleed.
However, he is not back to his baseline of 2 liters of oxygen nasal cannula at home.
Diabetes mellitus 2 - The patient was maintained on a diabetic diet, with q.i.d.
fingersticks, fingerstick blood glucose testing and coverage with a regular insulin sliding scale.
He was maintained on his outpatient dose of Neurontin for neuropathy.
His acute renal failure resolved after fluid hydration.
Vitamin B12 deficiency - The patient was continued on his outpatient regimen of supplementation with Vitamin B12, 1000 mcg p.o.
Hypercholesterolemia - The patient was continued on his outpatient dose of Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
Depression/anxiety - The patient was continued on his outpatient dose of Paroxetine 20 mg p.o.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was fed a diabetic heart-healthy diet.
He received supplementation with multivitamins and Vitamin B12.
Oxygen saturation stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula, ambulating independently, tolerating [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 243**] intake without nausea or vomiting.

He will decide on the timing and the necessity of any further testing or studies that will be required including any further gastrointestinal workup for bleeding.
