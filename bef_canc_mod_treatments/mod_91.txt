Because BiPAP could not be done on the floor, the patient was then transferred to the MICU.
Patient was placed on BiPAP in the ICU and pCO2 levels only mildly improved.
Patient's ability to tolerate BiPAP improved with the introduction of ativan 0.25 mg qhs.
She was encouraged to wear her supplemental oxygen at all times and to use BiPAP whenever sleeping or feeling tired.
As a result of the right heart catheterization she was started on sildenafil 20 mg po tid.
It was unclear whether the increased oxygenation decreased respiratory drive or whether use of ativan contributed to this presentation.
He ativan dose was decreased, she was placed on BiPAP and her pCO2 returned to her baseline of 115 and her symptoms resolved.
After discussion with Ms. [**Known lastname **], her pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**], and her family the decision was made to transfer her to a pulmonary rehabilitation center that could work with her increase her BiPAP tolerance and increase her mobilty.
Patient's ability to tolerate BiPAP improved with the introduction of ativan 0.25 mg qhs.
She was encouraged to wear her supplemental oxygen at all times and to use BiPAP whenever sleeping or feeling tired.
She was symptomatic with lightheadedness, hypotension (SBP 80s), and neck palpitations.
