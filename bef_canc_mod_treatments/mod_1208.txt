Was transferred to the floor and given acetazolamide 500 mg IV x 1 with minimal net diuresis given that patient's oral intake matched his diuresis.
He was then placed on home BiPAP settings and had desats to 70s which improved with discontinuation of BiPAP and increased suplemental oxygen.
Patient reporting that he is most comfortable when sitting upright with his legs hanging over edge of bed.
Upon arrival to the MICU, patient was given 60 po potassium and oxygenation improved to 90-92% on 6.5 Liters.

CXR notable for increase vascular congestion likely secondary to chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia as this has been shown to cause sodium retention due to aldosterone imbalance.
Since patient does not use supplemental oxygen at home to improve his hypoxia, and ?using BiPAP consistently, he was likely retaining more salt and water causing him to become more volume overloaded causing worsening hypoxia.
On day of transfer to ICU, patient received 60 mg IV lasix x1 and was 5L negative.
On ICU day 2 patient continued to have oxygen requirement and received an additional 60 mg IV lasix.
On transfer to medicine floor, total cumulative fluid balance was almost negative 6 L. Patient also had hypokalemia and was started on spironolactone 12.5 mg daily.
On the floor, he was started on torsemide as he may not be adequately absorbing lasix at home.
Dose was uptitrated to 100mg daily with approx 3L UOP per day.
For additional diuresis, he was given lasix 60-100mg IV in the afternoon/evening and was negative approximately 4L per day with 6L UOP and 2L fluid restriction.
Spironolactone was also increased to 25mg daily and he only required potassium repletion approximately once every 3 days.
He was discharged on torsemide 120 mg PO daily and IV lasix 100 mg daily at 4 PM.
His electrolytes were stable on this diuretic regimen with minimal potassium and magnesium repletion.
He was also started on home oxygen which should be continued upon discharge from rehabilitation.
# Hypokalemia: On IV lasix plus aldosterone/renin imbalance in setting of chronic hyercapnia (see citation above and paper in chart).
Patient was repleted with IV and PO potassium.
Patient had PICC line placed to administer concentrated IV potassium.
Spironolactone was added to medication regimen and uptitrated to 25mg daily with good effect.
Patient continued on bipap at night.
Pain was controlled with home oxycontin and oxycodone and IV dilaudid prn breakthrough.
He was also given triamconolone cream for venous stasis changes and legs were wrapped with ACE bandages as much as possible.
# COPD: Patient on high doses of steroids on admission for presumed COP flare in last admission.
His steroids were tapered from 40 to 30mg daily for 1 week then 20mg daily until he is seen by outpatient pulmonary.
He was continued on mycophenolate as patient is on several month trial as per outpatient pulm.
Continued bactrim prophylaxis and calcium and vitamin D  # Diabetes: Patient was started on sliding scale and glargine.
Blood sugar was not well controlled, so glargine dose was increased to 50 units qam and 80 units qhs with a humalog insulin sliding scale.
Prednisone also tapered as above.
# Chronic anemia - Continued iron and B12.
Continued home regimen of oxycontin and oxycodone (see discharge medications).
Patient also received IV dilaudid for lower extremity pain as needed to relieve pain from his lymphedema while he is being diuresed.
