African American female recently diagnosed with DM, HTN,  tracheobronchomalacia from multiple intubations, s/p metal stent  placement at OSH and recent removal of Y-stent.
In her hospital course, she was emergently intubated, fibrooptically and was taken to the OR for emergent rigid bronchoscopy with baloon dilatation of her tracheal lesion up to 16 mm.
Patient sent to Hospital for Special Care for vent weaning but has failed multiple attempt to wean.
Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for placement of a silicone stent to aide in vent weaning.
Past Medical History: # Panick attacks with respiratory compromise # Tracheobronchomalacia s/p recent Y silicone stenting and subsequent removal on [**2149-5-15**] # Obesity # Diabetes Mellitus type 2 # Hypertension # Obstructive Sleep Apnea # Anxiety Disorder   Social History: Patient originally from [**State 2748**], used to live with his daughter who is the primary care taker.

Indwelling tracheostomy tube with likely overinflated cuff.
CXR: [**2149-11-7**] COPD, bilateral CPA blunting, tracheostomy tube and the left PICC line are without change.
On [**2149-11-6**] she was taken to the operating room for Rigid bronchoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy but were unable to perform rigid bronchoscopy and stent placement due to significant narrowing of the airway just distal to the vocal cords.
Thoracic surgery was consulted who felt since she did not improve markedly with a Y-stent trial previously, and her malacia appears to be more extensive (specifically, more distal) than might be ameliorated with a stent or surgery tracheobronchoplasty.
The patient was treated with bactrim for UTI x 5 days and repeat UA came back negative.
