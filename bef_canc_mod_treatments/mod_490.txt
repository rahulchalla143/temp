Has grown VRE (E faecalis) in blood cultures sent [**6-28**], for which he is on linezolid at [**Hospital1 **] Care; sputum cultures have grown Enterbacter cloacae (sensitive to imipenem, genta, tobra, and amikacin).
Labs remarkable for ARF with hyperkalemia, rx'd with calcium, insulin + glucose, bicarb.
Surgery consulted and CT thorax obtained, which showed large L pleural effusion, large ascites; surgery did not think any acute surgical pathology.
Past Medical History: 1.Aortic Stenosis (Moderate aortic valve stenosis by [**2188**] echo; aortic valve area 1 cm squared.
Maximal gradient of 42, with a mean gradient of 26) 2.PVD s/p R fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass 3.Carotid Artery disease 4.COPD 5.HTN 6.Paraganglionoma diagnosed during ex-lap in [**2191**] 7.s/p tracheostomy, vent dependent 8.s/p PEG-J   Social History: Past history of tobacco use, none in past 25 years, no alcohol, no drug use.
Has been living at vent facility almost one month   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: 98.5 127/37 59 20 92% on AC 650x20, 40% FiO2, 8 PEEP GEN: grimaces to painful stimulus, does not follow simple command HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL but sluggish, will not track to allow assessment of EOM, poor dentition NECK: trach, jugular veins appear flat CHEST: rhonchorous on L, bronchial breath sounds on R CV: heart sounds obscured by breath sounds ABD: marked distension, healing midline surgical scar, PEG/J in epigastrium with bilious drainage around site.
The tracheostomy tube and percutaneous gastrostomy tube appear in unchanged positions.
Mildly thickened loops of small bowel with evaluation limited by ascites and lack of intravenous contrast.
# Respiratory: Trach/vent dependent; continued ventilation to keep Sats >90%.
# Cardiovascular: chronic problems include: - [**Name (NI) 31196**] AS by last echo, so would avoid sudden volume shifts as patient is likely very pre-load dependent - afib--rate controlled with metoprolol .
Renal team offered dialysis to patient's family, but explained that with his other significant co-morbidities, dialysis would not be likely to change his overall prognosis, and healthcare proxy decided that dialysis would not be in keeping with patient's wishes.
- elevated AST/ALT--could be drug effect, infection, shock liver as patient was reportedly hypotensive - chemical pancreatitis--CT did not reveal pancreatitis .
For now, continue ampicillin for Enterococcus; Enterobacter was sensitive to imipenem (although not tested for meropenem) and aminoglycosides but no others, will use meropenem since less seizure risk in renal failure.
# Skin--breakdown on coccyx as well as upper back, and thin skin on arms with tears and ecchymoses.
After several discussions of the futility of additional interventions such as dialysis in the setting of his numerous comorbidities and the low likelihood that he would survive any surgery to address the dehisced PEG and peritonitis, his family agreed he would want to focus the goals of his care on comfort.
