Status-post balloon pericardiotomy with marked decrease in pericardial effusion.
[**11-10**]: SPECIMEN RECEIVED: PERICARDIAL FLUID  DIAGNOSIS: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
A balloon pericardiotomy was performed as well.
#Anterior Mediastinal Mass: He was treated with a five day course of Solumedrol 125mg IV qD, and there was no interval change in the size of the mass by repeat CT. CT surgery and interventional pulmonary were consulted and the decision was made to biopsy the lesion by bronchoscopy.
The benefits and risks of the procedure was discussed with the patient.
Another primary malignancy, including lymphoma was also in the differential.
By the second or third day on the floor, he was intermittently requiring 2L oxygen by nasal cannula to have oxygen saturation of 95-96% and his pleural effusion was larger on both cxr and CT.
