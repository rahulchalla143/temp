Right internal jugular central venous catheter placed.
Endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: 69 year old male with h/o CVA and baseline non-communicative, aspiration pna, hydrocephalus s/p VP shunt who was brought in from NH by son for nausea and vomiting.
Did not know whether tube feeds have been a problem.
NGT placed with coffee-ground return.
Past Medical History: Alzheimer's dementia Bipolar disorder PVD DM type II Hydrocephalus s/p VP shunt (son says it was placed 3-5 years ago  at [**Hospital3 **] with no revisions, unknown cause of hydrocephalus) H/o subdural hemorrhages (unknown if before or after shunt placed) Hearing loss with hearing aids Cataracts Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia h/o SIADH with fluid restriction of 1L per day h/o aspiration PNAs s/p recent CVA ([**2190-6-3**]) Recent C. diff infection h/o VRE UTI   Social History: Resides in NH.
Physical Exam: T:98 BP: 123/61 HR: 129 R 20 O2Sats 98% on Vent support Gen: Intubated, sedated, NG tube with some coffee-grounds.
Foley in situ.
Neuro: Intubated and sedated, therefore could not be assessed, therefore, mental status could not be assessed.
VP shunt catheter tip in the right hemiabdomen appearing unremarkable.
CT Head ([**8-18**]): Continued evolution of blood products of left MCA territory infarction.
Renal U/S ([**8-19**]): IMPRESSION: No definite son[**Name (NI) 493**] correlates identified for bilateral renal hypodensities seen on previous CT, with no solid masses identified.
There is still some right infrahilar and left suprahilar opacification consistent with aspiration.
Right cephalic vein was not definitely identified.
Patient was intubated in the ED for concerns regarding airway protection and continued vomiting.
He also received Vanc/Levo/ Flagyl in the ED.
He was on aspiration precautions and treated with a regimen of vanco and ceftriaxone.
However, the ceftriaxone was switched to meropenem given ESBL Klebsiella in the urine.
He will complete a 10d course of vanco and a 14d course of meropenem.
He received 4L IV NS in the ED via intraosseous line as no peripherals or central lines could be placed.
Also, he was tachycardic, likely both from volume depletion and holding his antihypertensives due to hypotension.
# Hypertension Occurred a few days after his hypovolemia and hypotension were corrected.
The hypertension resolved after these medications were resumed, albeit at lower doses and with clonidine given PO.
- Also, his other antihypertensives are at lower doses - please titrate to his prior regimen as tolerated.
Neurosurgery was consulted initially for concern of worsening ICP in a patient with a VP shunt, but felt his head CT was not suggestive of this.
Following extubation, TFs were restarted gradually with high residuals, so he was started on reglan for presumed diabetic gastroparesis as the cause of his vomiting.
His inital ceftriaxone and bactrim were switched to meropenem 500mg q6h and will be continued to complete a 14 day course.
He was started on lansoprazole.

This was likely because the tube feeds were passing through your bowels very slowly, perhaps due to diabetes.
We also found a bladder infection, and treated both infections with IV antibiotics.
We also gave you 2 units of blood because your red blood cell level was low.
Please take all medications as prescribed and go to all follow up appointments.
