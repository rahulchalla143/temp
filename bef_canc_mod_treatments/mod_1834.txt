Physical Exam: VS: HR 101, T 100.2, BP 165/105, RR 40, 100% on NRB Gen: tachypneic, labored breathing, sleepy but arousable HEENT: EOMI, o/p clear, NC, AT, PERRLA CV: tachycardic, no m/r/g Pulm: Crackles diffusely, no wheezing Abd: soft, NT, ND, bowel sounds present Ext: no peripheral edema Neuro: A&Ox3, motor and sensation grossly intact.
In light of this respiratory distress, CXR finding, and fever of unknown source the patient was started on empiric antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia.
Upon transfer to the MICU, the patient developed increased respiratory distress requiring oxygen supplementation.
This was felt to be a result of aggressive IV fluid resuscitation in the ED.
The patient was diuresed on lasix as needed and responded appropriately with resolution of her respiratory distress.
Her oxygen requirement decreased from NRB to 2L NC.
However, on [**10-14**], the patient was found to again have an O2 requirement of 4L NC at baseline and 5L NC when the patient was ambulating.
At this time, the patient was started on ceftriaxone/azithromycin for treatment of community acquired pneumonia.
Her coverage was broadened to Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Azithromycin since she continued to spike temperature.
She was agressively diuresed with IV lasic and her respiratory distress improved.
Her antibiotic regimen was changed to Levaquin x 5 days and her fever eventually defervesced.
2) Diabetes:  Upon arrival to the ED, the patient was noted to be hypoglycemic in the setting of cocaine use, poor PO intake and glargine use.
The patient was started on a D5W drip and her sliding scale/glargine was stopped.
Her glargine changed from a nightime dose to an after breakfast dose and her sliding scale was tightened in order to better control her sugars.
On discharge, the patient was placed on 6 units of glargine after breakfast and her insulin sliding scale.
The patient also underwent diabetic teaching regarding diet and compliance with insulin regimen.
She will follow up with her [**Last Name (un) **] physician for further optimization of her insulin regimen [**1-26**] weeks after discharge.
She developed chest pain and SOB both of which resolved on nitroglycerin x 3 and ativan.
At this time, the patient was placed on a heparin drip.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended medical management with Aspirin and Verapamil for blood pressure control.
At this time, the patient was started on additional afterload reduction medications, hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate.
4) Hypertension:  The patient's Nifedipine was held due to concern for tachycardia in the setting of an NSTEMI.
The patient was instead started and uptitrated on verapamil with excellent control of her blood pressures.
Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate were added for afterload reduction as discussed above.
