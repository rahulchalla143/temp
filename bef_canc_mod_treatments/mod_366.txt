HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, an 85-year-old gentleman with subtotal colectomy and ileocolic anastomosis presents with an upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to duodenal ulcers which was found to be Helicobacter pylori positive.
The patient was started on a clear liquid diet and started on amoxicillin, Biaxin and Prilosec for triple therapy of his Helicobacter pylori.
The patient also remained on high dose Prilosec for treatment of his duodenal ulcers.
The patient was evaluated by surgery, in which the patient was made NPO and a nasogastric tube was placed.
The patient also received a tube in his ileostomy for decompression through his ileostomy site to decompress his small bowel.
PARTIAL SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION:  At this point, the patient continues to remain NPO on TPN with a nasogastric tube.
There was some discussion with surgery whether the patient may require a surgical procedure to assess whether adhesions are the source of the patient's obstruction.
The patient underwent a barium enema per surgery to assess the patency of the ileosigmoid anastomosis and the ilium distal to the stoma.
The patient's regimen for Helicobacter pylori eradication was switched to intravenous Protonix, intravenous azithromycin and intravenous Flagyl.
Once the patient is able to take po's again, this regimen can be switched to a po antibiotic regimen.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Infectious disease consult was asked to asses the duration of patient's treatment with Staphylococcus epidermitis bacteremia as the cultures that grew the Staphylococcus epidermitis were drawn from the patient's right IJ catheter.
The patient had been receiving vancomycin therapy since the beginning of his hospitalization.
Currently, there are plans to consider removal of the triple lumen catheter once decision for surgery had been finalized and a PICC line for additional access had been placed.
At that point, decision for continuation of vancomycin therapy will be made pending.
The patient was then started on intravenous acyclovir at 10 mg per kg per day for a total of a 7 day course.
PSYCHIATRIC:  The patient was noted to be somewhat depressed during his admission and was restarted on his Ritalin therapy.
