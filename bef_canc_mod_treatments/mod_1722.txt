HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89 year old male (Russian noncommunicative) with multiple medical problems who initially presented with vomiting and loose stools as well as dyspnea at his nursing home and was admitted to [**Hospital 517**] Medical Floor for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
The patient's hypotension resolved after intravenous fluid resuscitation.
The patient on admission to the Medical Floor, Acove Service, [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] was day #3 of Flagyl, Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin for broad coverage for pneumonia.
Antibiotics were discontinued given decreased white count, no fever and no copious sputum production, arguing against active pneumonia.
However, Flagyl was continued for possible Clostridium difficile infection given that the patient was having continued loose foul-smelling diarrhea.
A pleural tap was performed prior to transfer to the Medical Floor.
End stage renal disease secondary to nephrotic syndrome on hemodialysis started in [**2154-6-30**]; 3.

MEDICATIONS:  (On transfer)  Enteric coated acetaminophen, Folate, multivitamin, Ilotycin ointment, Prevacid, heparin subcutaneously, Tylenol, Lopressor, Diltiazem, Digoxin, Nepro, tube feeds.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 89 year old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident, atrial fibrillation, hypertension and end stage renal disease on hemodialysis who was transferred to the Medical Floor in medically stable condition from the Intensive Care Unit status post resolved hypotension with intravenous fluids, questionable pneumonia treated with three days of Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl as well as a chronic left pleural effusion, status post thoracentesis.
Initially a left lower lobe opacity versus atelectasis versus chronic effusion was visualized on chest x-ray.
The patient has been afebrile without sputum production, therefore after three days of broad spectrum antibiotics, all antibiotics were discontinued.
No further thoracentesis were recommended at this time.
This is most likely secondary to volume depletion from loose stools and resolved upon resuscitation with intravenous fluids.
No additional intravenous fluids were necessary.
In addition the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with good rate control using Diltiazem as well as Lopressor and Digoxin.
The patient has not been on anticoagulation due to the history of gastrointestinal bleeds.
Renal - The patient has a history of end stage renal disease on hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
The patient received hemodialysis at [**Hospital6 649**].
The patient has been guaiac negative times three as well as Clostridium difficile negative times three.
The patient was continued on Flagyl but was then discontinued.
In the past fiber has been added to tube feeds with good results and continued diarrhea.
