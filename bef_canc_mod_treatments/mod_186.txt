1) Hypotension: Likely [**1-17**] to dehydration from decreased PO intake and in the setting of blood loss.
He had an episode of hypotension on HD 6 also with sinus tachycardia.
He was initially given Vit K and FFP to reverse INR.
Home coumadin restarted [**2-27**] when INR < 3.0.
He also received heparin IV bridge.
His INR was subtherapeutic after several days of coumadin and his dose was increased.
At the end of his hospital admission, the only issue keeping him in the hospital was heparin IV dependence while await INR to return to therapeutic range.
4) Seizure disorder: The patient has been taking dilantin for decades.
He was started on coumadin in [**11-20**] after a PE.
Dilantin and coumadin often can interact and it was thought that this interaction may have led to the supratherapeutic level of dilantin.
Neurology recommended discontinuing dilantin given drug interactions with coumadin and starting keppra.
Keppra was started and dilantin was dicontinued.
