IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided double lumen PICC line placement via the left brachial venous approach.
Aspiration  VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOW EVALUATION: Study done in conjunction with speech and swallow division.
The pharyngeal phase was characterized by moderate delay in initiation of pharyngeal swallow.
Penetration and aspiration were seen with multiple consistencies of barium.
CTA OF THE HEAD AND NECK Please note there was very poor contrast opacification of the neck and intracranial vessels due to infiltrated IV during bolus injection.
CTA uninterpretable due to suboptimal bolus from IV infiltration.
RIGHT SIDE: There is mild plaque at the distal common carotid artery and proximal internal carotid artery with respective peak systolic velocities 61 cm/sec, and 51 cm/sec.
LEFT SIDE: There is mild plaque in the distal common carotid artery and proximal internal and external carotid arteries with respective peak systolic velocities 52 cm/sec, 33 cm/sec, and 79 cm/sec.
Infection, toxic metabolic disturbances, and medication effects are among the most common causes.
Aortic valve gradient is now higher.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]: Assess J-tube tract; patient had a surgically placed jejunostomy tube which fell out yesterday.
A guide wire was advanced into this loop, but due to the lack of normal peristalsis, catheter and guide wire were removed.
The procedure was discontinued.
[**2129-6-9**] 9:06 AM - SMALL BOWEL ONLY (GASTROGRAF) Reason: TO STUDY J TUBE AND TO ASSESS BOWEL WALL FOR THUMB PRINTING /EDEMA INDICATION: Assess for small bowel ischemia.

[**2129-6-22**] G/GJ TUBE CHECK PORT 15ml Gastrograffin injected into J tube by surgical md [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] taken.
A J tube was noted entering the left lower quadrant with contrast noted within loops of small and large bowel.
[**2129-10-18**] RENAL ULTRASOUND The right kidney measures 11.7 cm.
The left kidney measures 13.1 cm.
A Foley catheter is seen within a distended bladder.
Foley catheter within a filled, distended bladder.
The plan was to place a feeding jejunostomy tube, as he had failed multiple swallowing evaluations and coverage for continued TPN in the presence of functional bowel was in question.
His urinary catheter was exchanged and he was started on Vancomycin/Zosyn for empiric coverage.
The PICC line was removed.
Urine culture was (+) for coag(-) staph and enterococcus.
Abx coverage was changed to Zosyn/Linezolid.
A PICC line was placed; TPN was restarted.
On HD25 he was taken to the OR where he underwent a feeding jejunostomy placement.
He tolerated the procedure well and was returned the floor after recovery in the PACU.
On POD2 tube feedings were being tolerated.
Coumadin was started for a. fib prophylaxis.
On POD 5 the patient was started on a heparin gtt and Coumadin, with a therapeutic goal of [**1-15**], as well as a statin.
Low dose beta-blockade was initiated at that time.
Following placement of the patient's J-tube for enteral feedings and subsequent embolic CVA, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by chronic aspiration and bile reflux resulting in numerous bouts of aspiration pneumonia.
This was complicated by the fact that the patient required aggressive diuresis to avoid CHF exacerbation, which also occured multiple times during his course.
Throughout his course he was treated with multiple broad spectrum antibiotic regimens.
Aspiration events were treated with similar regimens, this included: aspiration precautions (ie sitting patient upright), stopping TF, NT suctioning, aggressive pulmonary toilet, hydrocortisone lavages, NGT decompression, and nebulizers.
Once the patient improved, the NGT was discontinued (usually after 24-48 hours) and TF were restarted and advanced as tolerated until the next aspiration event.
Nutritional support was provided by TPN and varying rates of TF's.
Multiple interventions were performed during his hospitalization, including multiple therapeutic bronchoscopies and multiple studies and manipulations of his jejunal feeding tube.
He would tolerate a general anesthetic for laparoscopic or open surgical intervention to accompish this procedure.
Later in his course, on HD 120, the patient underwent tracheostomy placement with local anesthesia to see if this would help to avoid further aspirations.
He continued to aspirate despite this intervention, more so when he underwent Passe-Muir valve trials, which were eventually discontinued.
The patient remained on therapeutic anticoagulation following his CVA caused by AF/embolism.
The regimen initially consisted of Heparin gtt and coumadin, and for a brief period, Lovenox.
Rate control was maintained with beta blockade, Amiodarone, and Digoxin.
The patient also received multiple blood transfusions and was treated with Epogen and iron for anemia of chronic disease.
His final decompensation and eventual decline resulting in death started with his final transfer to the ICU on  HD 144.
Tracheostomy secretions were noted to be increased and CXR was consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
Antibiotic coverage consisted of Zosyn and Gent at that time.
PMV trials were discontinued on HD 148.
During the next few weeks he continued to aspirate despite the aggressive measures as outlined above.
More aggressive diuresis was performed to avoid volume overload.
Albumin was given on multiple occasions, only for a CVP less than 4 as it was felt a CVP at or around 4 was the optimal volume on his Starling curve.
Later in the course his antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin, Tobramycin, Fluconazole and Ciprofloxacin and his WBC had decreasaed to 10.3 by HD 176.
It was around this time that the patient's BUN began to rise and urine output to decrease, requiring increasing doses of diuretic to try and maintain euvolemia.
On HD 177, the patients BUN was 46 and Cr 0.9, however his BUN and Cr subsequently steadily increased and urine output gradually decreased.
On HD 182 the patient was noted to have 200cc of blood suctioned from his trach and received a 1 unit pRBC transfusion.
Anticoagulation was discontinued at this time.
Nephrology was consulted and it was recommended that the tobramycin be discontinued and to avoid diuresis if possible.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and the Troponion was noted to be elevated to 0.18 on HD 183.
Gentle diuresis was recommended, however his ARF obviously complicated the treatment plan.
His volume status was in question, but at this point the patient's family did not want to pursue further invasive interventions, such as a PA catheter.
TPN was adjusted to provide only essential amino acids to avoid exacerbating the rising BUN.
His renal failure progressed, with his potassium eventually rising to 7.0 despite aggressive treatment with calcium, bicarbonate, and glucose/insulin.
