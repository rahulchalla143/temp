In the field she received nebs without improvement.
She was then given 80 mg IV of Lasix with diuresis and subsequent improvement in oxygenation and dyspnea.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 95.9, heart rate 111, blood pressure 138/71, respiratory rate of 24, 96% on 6 liters of nasal cannula.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medicine service for evaluation and treatment of her multifactorial respiratory distress.
While ABG was not significantly abnormal, her work of breathing was increased, and her symptoms did not initially respond to IV Lasix, nebs, IV Solu-Medrol or Nitro Paste.
She was then transferred to MICU for trial of C-PAP on which she gradually improved.
CHF:  The patient's initial history and physical was most consistent with CHF, and she responded to initial diuresis to 80 mg IV Lasix on the field.
After initial aggressive diuresis, her diuretic regimen was changed to 40 mg po bid in order to avoid compromising her preload too significantly.
She was also continued on her calcium channel blocker in light of her diastolic dysfunction.
She was treated with nebs and parenteral steroids and MDI with Prednisone taper.
On this admission chest x-ray did show a right lower lobe opacity suspicious for pneumonia, and she was treated with Levo and Flagyl, again for suspicion that this process might be post obstructive.
