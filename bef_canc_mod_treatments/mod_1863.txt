CARDIAC:  The patient was watched on cardiac medications.
Aggressive nebulizers were given.
Gas improved slowly throughout the course of the night, 40 mg intravenous Lasix and then 120 mg intravenous Lasix were given.
The actual cause of this acute decompensation was not fully known, probably a combination between congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare since it improved with nebulizers and Lasix, not clear which one, but we do not think she had another cardiac event.
RENAL:  Creatinine continued to trend down.
