-UCx ([**2137-10-10**]): <10,000 organisms/ml -BCx ([**2137-10-10**]): Pending x 2   Brief Hospital Course: MEDICINE SERVICE COURSE:  56 year-old woman with a history of HCV and autoimmune hepatatis with a baseline MELD score of 32, on liver and kidney [**Month/Day/Year **] list and previous admissions for hepatic encephalopathy, who was admitted on [**9-27**] for fever and altered mental status.
The patient was initially treated with ceftriaxone empirically for SBP from [**9-27**] to [**10-1**].
She has completed a 2nd course of ceftriaxone and 1 course of Vancomycin empirically for SBP on [**10-7**] to [**10-14**].
Started on empiric linezolid for VRE in urine.
On [**10-15**] with AMS, her lactulose was increased to 60mg po q3h and transferred to the ICU for further management.
In the MICU, the patient had her INR corrected and had a LIJ placed and dobhoff placed on [**2137-10-16**].
She was treated for the following issues:  ESLD: The patient was intermittently encephalopathic during her admission, especially when she was not given her lactulose strictly Q3 hrs.
She was also continued on rifaximin.
Her INR was consistently elevated, and she required occasional doses of FFP to reverse her INR when she developed low-grade bleeding from the corner of her mouth and lips.
Her diuretics were held for the duration of her time on the hepatorenal service, given her acute kidney injury.
Her hand was felt to be cold and plastic/hand surgery was consulted.
She was followed with serial hand sensation/strength exams.
She was given benadryl and IV steroids.
Linezolid was started for the patient's [**10-12**] trigger (altered MS), given the culture data.
The linezolid was discontinued on [**10-14**].
# Anemia: The patient had a generally stable hematocrit and did not require frequent blood transfusions.
She was continued on her regular dose of erythropoeitin, and her aspirin and warfarin (for portal vein thrombosis) were held.
She had low-grade vaginal and oropharyngeal bleeding, as above.
She was also continued on daily PO vitamin K, and was given 5 mg of IV vitamin K on day of transfer to MICU, in anticipation of IR-guided line placement and paracentesis.
She was placed on octreotide and midodrine, and received daily doses of IV albumin.
Her creatinine improved to 1.5 on day of transfer to the MICU, but her midodrine regimen was occasionally interrupted secondary to hypertension.
She had a foley placed on day of transfer to the MICU.
She was started on a D5W fluid infusion.
She was written for a low-protein, diabetic diet.
# Access: The patient had an EJ line placed in her right neck, and also had a peripheral IV placed on her right arm.
At the time of transfer to the MICU, there was a plan in place for the patient to receive vitamin K via the IV, and have her coagulation studies checked overnight, with FFP/cryoprecipitate given as needed to reduce her INR to <2.0.
Angio and ultrasound were contact[**Name (NI) **] to arrange central venous line vs PICC placement and diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis on the morning of [**10-15**].
She is intubated and a cordis is placed for rapid resucitation.
She was given 3U PRBCs, 4U FFP, 1U cryo and started on dopamine drip.
CVP was noted to be elevated to 30s and heart was enlarged on CXR so stat echo was ordered and showed no effusion but PASP 40-48 with a normal LVEF.
On [**10-19**], a temp femoral line placed by renal and CVVH started.
SQ methylnaltrexone was given for trace stool.
She was started on amiodorone and given lidocaine boluses.
She was then found to be in pulseless VT.  She had return of spontaneos circulation with DC cardioversion.
