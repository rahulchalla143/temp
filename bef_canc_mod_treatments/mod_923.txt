Overt coughing was noted with thin liquids and pt confirmed sensation of aspiration.
Notes from discharge facility indicate poor po intake has been an issue, but the pt was on a full po diet so it appears that he was able to advance off of tube feedings.
Unclear whether this decline is related to post op somnolence or possible toxic-metabolic issues noted per neurology.
However, at this time, I would recommend the pt remain NPO with enteral nutrition and medications via the PEG.

Tolerated the procedure well.
Had epidural placed for pain control .L renal cross clamp time 25 minutes.
Argatroban was administered intra-operatively  Prolong intubation in SICU / requiring pressure support / metabolic acidosis  On [**5-2**], there was a period of hypotension to 90s/50s requiring pressor support, but this was transient.
Pain is currently being managed with Dilaudid PCA and Bupivacaine epidural.
The last morphine dose was at 4:50pm on [**5-2**].
Epidural DC by pain service  Pt has been somewhat difficult to arouse with limited speech output and eye rolling during morning rounds [**5-4**], prompting consult for seizure evaluation from Neurology  CT scan / MRI done - no acute process.
Final neurological - toxic-metabolic encephalopathy related to post-surgical state and sedative medications (Dilaudid) being used for pain control  Pt received fundaperinox from transition to coumadin for Afib.
AAA was diagnosed when pt was admitted [**12-12**] s/p right parietal subacute infarction as well as right intraventricular hemorrhage.
Neurology consult reported that the pt may have toxic-metabolic encephalopathy related to post-surgical state and sedative medications being used for pain control.
PMH includes: s/p right parietal subacute infarction and right intraventricular hemorrhage,  Seizure disorder, Abdominal aortic aneurysm, Atrial fibrillation, Hypertension, COPD, CHF, Pulmonary hypertension,Benign prostatic hypertrophy, T2 compression fracture found [**2199-1-7**], s/p MRSA bacteremia [**1-13**], s/p heparin induced thrombocytopenia, s/p cholecystectomy [**1-12**],(+) UTI.
Pt was observed to penetrate both thin and nectar thick liquids with eventual aspiration of residue of thin liquids.
As such, we recommended that  the pt remain primarily NPO at this time with nutrition, hydration, and medication via PEG.
Per discharge summary from rehab facility, the pt participated in speech therapy, had a repeat video swallow study and progressed to a ground solid, thin liquid po diet while at rehab.
However, his po intake remained poor despite stopping tube feedings and starting the pt on Megace.
However, notes from rehab facility and extended care facility indicate the pt was solely on a po diet, not on tube feedings prior to admission here for AAA repair.
Overt coughing was noted with thin liquids and pt confirmed sensation of aspiration.
Notes from discharge facility indicate poor po intake has been an issue, but the pt was on a full po diet so it appears that he was able to advance off of tube feedings.
Unclear whether this decline is related to post op somnolence or possible toxic-metabolic issues noted per neurology.
However, at this time, I would recommend the pt remain NPO with enteral nutrition and medications via the PEG.
Remain NPO with enteral nutrition and medications via the PEG.
Will discharge to rehab with tubefeeds via Gtube.
