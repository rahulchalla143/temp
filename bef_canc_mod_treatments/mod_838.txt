Admission Date:  [**2149-9-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-9-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-12-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 76M h/o pancreatic CA (s/p Whipple), upper GI bleed and liver abscesses with recent admission to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2149-8-9**], d/c'ed on [**2149-9-2**] on antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, meropenam, and caspofungin.
He was discharged to New [**Hospital3 105**] for IV antibiotic therapy after he had improved for a few days before discharge.
He had been feeling well after discharge, but returned to the ED today after he began experiencing shortness of breath.
He was then started on vancomycin, meropenam, and caspofungin.
He received 1 paracentesis for fluid culture and at the time had 6 L of peritoneal fluid removed which reaccumulated rapidly.
He was given Percocet 5/325 mg per NGT.
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma- s/p Whipple [**9-28**] and chemo/XRT 2.
In [**5-31**]- Abscess composed of E. coli, Morganella morganii, and enterococcus-Rx w/ cefipime, vancomycin, Fungizone 3.
Ascites-3L removed ([**5-/2149**]) 13.
DM- well controlled w/ Prandin 14.
He received a CT guided drainage of one  liver abscess and drain placement on [**8-15**] -> growing klebsiella resistant to cetriaxone, enterococcus and yeast.
He also received a paracentesis and peritoneal fluid grew out [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17939**] and fluid analysis showed elevated WBCs c/w SBP.
Meropenem and vanco were started on [**8-17**] due to ceftriaxone and methacillin resistance profiles.
Attempted to replace percutaneous drains on  [**8-27**] after drainage slowed but abscesses were not amenable to drainage by IR.
Planning for antibiotics will need to be continued for 6 weeks with serial imaging to monitor for resolution of absecesses.
Recently transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for IV antibiotics on [**2149-9-2**].
Patient refused further invasive interventions including thoracentesis.
Recommended carafate and PPI IV BID.
No need for repeat transfusions after repeat episode.
Episodes of tachycardia treated with IV lopressor prn.
Standing metoprolol dose gradually increased.
#)Liver abscesses and Bacteremia - Continued vancomycin, caspofungin, and meropenem.
Were not amenable to further percutaneous drainage on last admission.
Would have needed long term antibiotics with serial imaging to assess responsiveness.
The utility of repeating head imaging to reevaluate his possible septic emboli was believed to be low without further intervention options.
#)Ascites- persistent ascites with low albumin minimally responsive to aggressive tube feeds.
Patient refused repeat paracentesis.
#)Pancreatic insufficiency - Was given viokase per NG while he was getting tube feeds to assist in breakdown and absorbtion of nutrients.
# Renal failure: Creatinine elevationa after aggressive diuresis for pleural effusions.
# DM2- controlled with insulin sliding scale.
#)HTN- controlled with increasing doses of metoprolol .
#)FEN- frequent high residuals over this admission.
Patient switched to TPN given the need for nutrition to increase his albumin.
#)Prophylaxis- Heparin SC 5000 units .
Patient pulled out his NG tube on [**9-13**] and refused replacement.
He explained that he was tired of aggressive treatment.
His therapeutic medications were stopped and he was started on a morphine drip.
