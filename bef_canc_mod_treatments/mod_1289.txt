On [**2173-10-9**] the patient underwent a ultrasound-guided puncture of left common femoral artery, contralateral second-order catheterization of right external iliac artery, serial arteriogram of right lower extremity, balloon angioplasty and stenting of right superficial, femoral artery, AngioJet mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis of tibioperoneal trunk and posterior tibial artery, and placement of 40 cm [**Location (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 6632**] thrombolysis catheter along the length of the posterior tibial artery, tibioperoneal trunk and popliteal artery.
Postoperatively the patient experienced motor and sensory changes status post AngioJet thrombolysis and returned to the OR for Removal of [**Last Name (un) 73395**]-[**Doctor Last Name 6632**] catheter, serial arteriogram of right lower extremity, balloon angioplasty of right posterior tibial artery, and perclose closure of left common femoral arteriotomy (Reader referred to operative notes for details).
It was felt that he likely obstructed his airway requiring placement of a nasal trumpet and a positive pressure ventilation.
A left axillary line was placed.
Because it was felt that his profoundly ischemic right foot was contributing to his overall condition, it was felt that we should proceed with the operation to remove it.
The procedure was otherwise uneventful and the patient was transferred to the ICU post operatively for continued monitoring.
The patient did well overnight on just 02 via nasal cannula and was able to be transferred to the VICU the afternoon of POD1.
Neuro: The patient received dPCA which malfunctioned and required IV dilaudid to cover his pain until dPCA functionality could be restored.
Patient did not feel he was getting adequate pain control and was transitioned to intermittent IV dilaudid and PO oxycodone with good effect and adequate pain control.
IV lopressor was used for rate control and the patient's home atenolol was increased to 125mg with good effect and IV lopressor was discontinued.
Good pulmonary toilet, raised head of the bed and sitting upright and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
Due to concerns for possible OSA patient was put in contact with the sleep clinic at [**Hospital1 18**].
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.
The patient was put on an aggressive bowel regimen with good effect.
Patient had urinary retention on POD 3 from the Right BKA and the foley catheter had to be replaced.
He was dishcaged with foley in place.
Patient was put on IV Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl.
His WBCs began to down trend after the BKA and he was transitioned to Bactrim PO.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; the patient received 1 unit of PRBCs on [**2173-10-10**], [**2173-10-12**], and [**2173-10-16**] for HCT less than 30 in light of evidence of heart strain via elevated cardiac enzymes.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; A knee immobilizer was used to prevent contracture of his right lower extremity.
He is being sent to a rehabilitation facility for continued work to improve mobility, endurance, and for amputation teaching and training.

When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision.
Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the medications you were taking before surgery.
Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet.
Smoking causes narrowing of your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation.
Staples can be removed in about 4 weeks if still in a Rehabilitation Center.
We also had to increase your dose of atenolol during your stay.
