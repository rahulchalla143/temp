He was started on Lopressor and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
His left circumflex showed major OM with 40% ostial lesion and a 70% distal stenosis.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  He did not taken any medications at home but on transfer was taking Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
and aspirin 325 mg.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unremarkable.
They did feel that his syncopal episode was consistent with a possible vagal episode but they felt that they would rather do EP studies following his CABG and at that point may or may not place an AICD.
On [**2114-11-23**], he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the OM, and saphenous vein graft to the PDA.
He also had a mitral valve replacement with a #31 Carbomedics mechanical valve and intra-aortic balloon pump placed intraoperatively.
This surgery was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], nurse practitioner as the assistant.
The surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with the cardiopulmonary bypass time of 175 minutes and a cross-clamp time of 154 minutes.
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on epinephrine, milrinone, nitroglycerin, and propofol in normal sinus rhythm, two atrial and two ventricular pacing wires and two mediastinal and one left pleural chest tube.
In the immediate postoperative period the patient was noted to have a nosebleed and increased chest tube drainage.
On postoperative day number one, he remained sedated and intubated.
He continued on the milrinone drip and the epinephrine drip was weaned to 0.01 micrograms.
His epinephrine drip was eventually weaned and discontinued during that day.
By postoperative day number two, his milrinone was decreased and he was started on Lasix for diuresis.
Also on postoperative day number two, his sedation was lightened.
By postoperative day number three, he was continued to be hemodynamically stable after epinephrine with the milrinone weaned down slightly.
His intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued without incident.
He continued to be sedated and the ventilator was weaned.
Also, on this day he was noted to be in atrial flutter and an Amiodarone bolus was given.
Also, his propofol was weaned to off on this day.
By postoperative day number four, the ventilator continued to be very slowly weaned and his milrinone was decreased to 0.25.
He continued on Amiodarone and had started on heparin.
On postoperative day number five, he had his chest tube discontinued and he had a new left subclavian Cordis and Swan placed.
By postoperative day number six, his milrinone was discontinued and he continued to have good cardiac function.
By postoperative day number seven, he was started on heparin for anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation and his mechanical mitral valve.
By postoperative day number eight, it was decided that his Coumadin should be held in case the plan for EP study and insertion of a ICD would be done this admission.
He continued to be treated with heparin and have his Coumadin held while the Electrophysiology Service sorted out his echocardiogram and decided when would be the best time to do his studies.
His chest x-ray did show a left lower lobe consolidation and he was started on levofloxacin.
He was noted to have a purulent exudate around his uvula and he was started on Rocephin for that and his Levaquin was discontinued.
His Coumadin continued to be held because his INR had bumped high and were waiting for it to decreased to remove his pacing wires.
By postoperative day number 12, his INR had drifted down to 1.9 and his pacing wires were discontinued without incident.
He was restarted on his Coumadin and was awaiting elevation of his INR to be discharged home.
Over the next week, he did receive doses of anywhere from 1-3 mg of Coumadin each time his INR would bump into the range of 5.
By the second attempt at anticoagulation, his INR drifted down to 2.6 and he was started on 1 mg of Coumadin and was discharged on this dose.
Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Captopril 12.5 mg p.o.
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
Atenolol 25 mg p.o.
Coumadin 1 mg p.o.
Status post coronary artery bypass grafting times three with a left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery with a #31 Carbomedics mechanical mitral valve replacement on [**2114-11-23**].
