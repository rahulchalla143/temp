1)Epistaxis: initially required nasal packing by ENT which required continuous O2 monitoring, but remained stable and although embolization was considered, it was not done because patient did not want elective intubation which would have been required for the procedre and with the risk of stroke with embolization this procedure was deferred.
The packing was eventually removed and an absorbable intranasal packing was placed and nares kept moist with ocean spray and vaseline.
She did have occasional episodes of minimal epistaxis which was managed with courses of afrin and supportive measures and her hematocrit remained stable after 3 total units of blood transfusions.
She was continued on ancef while packing remained in place.
She did have some pressure headaches from the packing which was stable on percocet and dilaudid as needed.
2)s/p MVR: for severe mitral regurgitation 6 yrs ago-- stable for now-- initially coumadin held and reversed with vitamin K and 2units of FFP and eventually she was restarted on coumadin with goal INR around 2.5-3.0 as her risk of bleeding is significant.
During her stay she was bridged with heparin until INR was therapeutic.
3)Anemia: acute on chronic with blood loss anemia on top of anemia of chronic disease with baseline hematocrit around 30.
She was transfused total of 3units of PRBC and her hematcrit remained stable above 30 during the rest of her stay, she was also restarted on her home epogen regemin.
Drainage from trans-tracheal catheter was managed by interventional pulmonary team with periodic strippings and bronchoscopies as above.
Otherwise she was continued on her home doses of albuterol, combivent and inhaled steroids.
5)CHF: 40% EF, but stable and euvolemic-- continued on home bumex and [**Last Name (un) **]  6)Hypothyroid: stable on home thyroid meds   Medications on Admission: Coumadin 7 x6 days and 12mg x1 day bumex 1mg qd levoxyl 112mcg qd lipitor 20mg qd cozaar 50mg qd quinine 260BID tums [**Hospital1 **] Flovent Combivent Mucinex DM 600BID  Discharge Medications: 1.
