Admission Date:  [**2196-1-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-2-29**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Erythromycin Base / Motrin / Ampicillin / Lactose / Latex / Adaptic / Amiodarone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**] Chief Complaint: Confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 86y/o F with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG  86F with CAD s/p CABG [**10/2189**] (SVG-OM, LIMA-LAD), AS s/p valvuloplasty [**11-3**], diastolic CHF, AF on coumadin, s/p R colectomy [**12-6**] admitted with generalized tonic clonic seizure.
Her course was complicated by LGI bleed and on colonoscopy a precancerous 2cm cecal polyp was found.
Her hospital course ([**2195-12-7**]- [**2195-12-16**]) was complicated by hypercarbia requiring intubation and fluid overload requiring diuresis.
Subsequent to this she developed C. difficile colitis, for which she has been on PO vancomycin since; she continued to complain of abdominal pain, with fevers post op and had a CT in [**2195-12-28**], that revealed slight increased fat stranding in the region of the sigmoid colon at sites of diverticula, representing a mild case of uncomplicated diverticulitis.
Her daughter and husband were visiting her and they noticed a self-limitted 5 minutes seizure, described as acute onset of LOC, followed by whole body stiffens and later shaking.
To stop the cluster she received Ativan IV and later she was loaded with 1000mg of IV Keppra.
She was admitted to the Neuro ICU for further management.
She was initially treated with broad spectrum abx including vancomycin/cipro/bactrim and acyclovir for concern for meningitis/encephalitis.
On evening of [**1-28**] the patient triggered for altered mental status and lethargy following head [**Date Range 4338**].
O2 sat found to be 84% and HR 130s, SBPs in 80s.
Lasix 10mg IV given with no improvement.
MICU consult was called and an additional 30mg IV lasix given with metoprolol 5mg IV.
AMS felt most likely secondary to ativan given for head [**Date Range 4338**].
Given continued tachypnea and hypoxia requiring 4-5L NC, the patient was transferred to the CCU for further managment.
CAD status post CABG [**2189-9-26**] 2.
AFib on coumadin 4.
Chronic venous stasis with ulceration 9.
Right retinal vein clot with mild loss of vision 13.
Status post right hemicolectomy in [**2195-12-7**]    Social History: Has been staying at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab since her partial collectomy and C.diff.
At baseline is awake, interactive with family but confused about dates, current events and prior conversations.
Not following verbal commands.
Note is made of extensive [**Month/Day (2) 1106**] calcifications in the bilateral cavernous carotid, vertebral, and leptomeningeal arteries.
IMPRESSION: Critical aortic valve stenosis.
[**Date Range 4338**] Head ([**2196-2-19**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 1st NEURO ICU COURSE: 86 year-old woman with CAD s/p CABG, HTN, HL, R retinal vein occlusion and recently dx.
colon cancer, s/p colectomy c/b C.Diff coilitis who now presented from NH with two episodes of GTC seizures.
She was loaded with Keppra IV and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
At [**Hospital1 18**] upon evaluation in the ED, she was found to be "obtunded" s/p Keppra load and given multiple hospitalizations, WBC and seizure, she was felt to be at risk for meningitis, thus was treated with Vancomycin IV, Bactrim IV and Acyclovir IV for possible meningitis.
LP couldn not be performed due to requirement of remaining on coumadin and INR of 2.6.
Given sudden improvement and no menigismus the antibiotics were discontinued.
s/p CABG and AV valvuloplasty.
Patient was noted to have episodes of hypotension in setting of her home BB dose, this was decreased to 1/2 dose and her lasix was held x 1 day in this setting.
We held lasix after transfer to floor as there was concerns about lowering her blood pressure in setting of possible ischemic stroke.
1st CCU COURSE: Pt was found to be in Afib with RVR on admission secondary to missing several doses of metoprolol on the floor.
She was also found to be in acute pulmonary edema likely secondary to combination of afib with RVR and missing lasix doses.
She was initially kept NP[**MD Number(3) **] her depressed mental status and her Afib with RVR was rate controlled with IV metoprolol.
As her sensorium cleared she was transitioned to p.o metoprolol with effect.
She was treated for HAP aspiration pneumonia with vanc/falgyll/cefepime.
She was kept on broad spectrum coverage with culture data pending.
She was noted to have some new anisocoria on exam on hospital day three felt likely [**12-29**] nebulizer treatment, given that her was still overall improved but should be followed with serial exam.
The neurology service had recommended [**Month/Day (2) 4338**] with gadollinium once medically stable to evaluate hyperdensity noted on prior imaging.
Given her AS she was being judiciously diuresed with lasix drip, was running negative and was switched to her home lasix p.o dosing.
Discussion is underway with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding percutaneous Aortic valve replacement once she is medically stable.
She was seen by speech and swallow with recommendation made for tube feeding and an NGT was placed.
As her mental status was not improving, she was started on continuous EEG monitoring.
She was given ativan 0.5 mg x1, continued on keppra 1g [**Hospital1 **] and loaded with dilantin and was no longer in status.
2nd NEURO ICU COURSE: Neurology; The patient remained on continuous video EEG monitoring.
Her keppra was increased to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] and her dilantin was adjusted for goal levels 15-20.
Therefore, she was given ativan 1 mg x1, her keppra was decreased to 500 mg q12h, and she was loaded with phenobarbital at 15 mg/kg with maintenance dose of 1 mg/kg.
Her keppra was discontinued [**2-13**], and phenobarbital was decreased to 60 mg [**Hospital1 **] [**2-15**].
Her phenytoin is continued with goal level of 8 (which corresponds to free dilantin level 1.9 as per [**2-8**] draw).
Trough levels are requested for dilantin and free dilantin levels on [**2-15**].
ID; The patient completed a seven-day course of vancomycin and cefepime [**2-9**] for a presumed pneumonia.
She required pressors to maintain her SBP (phenylephrine).
She is on coumadin for goal INR [**12-30**].
At this time, she was intubated and unresponsive.
The prospect of dialysis was brought up; however, it was felt that the patient was not a candidate for dialysis at that time.
