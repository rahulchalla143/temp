HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and treatment for her increasing shortness of breath.
Given that, IV Lasix was initially attempted to treat her congestive heart failure, without significant improvement.
Thereafter, she was given a trial of dopamine with concomitant Swan-Ganz monitoring.
However, the patient showed no significant improvement in objective or subjective parameters while on pressors, and the dopamine was weaned off.
Given her hypotension, it was not felt that Natrecor, other pressors, or Flolan could be reasonable options at this point.
Given the direction of her care at that point and the small likelihood for any meaningful recovery, further pressors were not attempted.
