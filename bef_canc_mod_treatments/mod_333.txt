On hospital day two, he had significant hematochezia and at that time he was transfused two units of blood and was immediately transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] in anticipated of a tagged red cell scan and subsequent angiography to attempt embolization of the bleeding vessel.
On hospital day five, the patient again had a massive bleed and at this point it was decided, due to two negative EGDs at the outside hospital, one negative EGD here, and a negative colonoscopy at the outside hospital, a negative CT scan here, three negative tagged red cells scans, to directly take the patient to the operating room for a planned total abdominal colectomy which was potentially the only procedure that could save his life.
Initially the patient's family had declined surgery but agreed to proceed if a straightforward outcome could be assured.
He appeared to have a fistula from an infected distal aorto-iliac graft to common iliac anastamosis to the appendix, requiring division of his graft.
