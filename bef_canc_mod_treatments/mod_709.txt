Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endoscopy, colonoscopy, right and left cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 63 year old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG (SVG-D, SVG-RCA and LIMA-LAD SVG-RCA which was occluded on [**12/2107**] catheterization), diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation/flutter, type II diabetes presented to an OSH with worsening dyspnea over one day.
Also of note, the pt's post-cath course  on prior admission was complicated by large groin hematoma; he required 3 units pRBC and repair by vascular surgery.
Over the last few days he has been using his wife's oxygen with some relief.
The patient was briefly on Bipap, transitioned to 4L NC maintaining sats between 97-100%.
He was treated with lasix 60 IV and nebulizers.
Past Medical History: Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] CAD s/p CABG [**2091**] Hypertension Dyslipidemia Atrial flutter/fibrillation Diabetes Mellitus Ventral abdominal hernia s/p MVA in [**2092**].
5.The aortic valve is not well seen.
Bleeding Study [**2108-2-7**]: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 120 minutes were obtained.
Bleeding Study [**2108-2-8**]: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen from 0-79 minutes and from 150-180 minutes were obtained.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 63 year old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG, CHF (diastolic) and atrial flutter/fibrillation who presented to an outside hospital for dyspnea and found to be hypoxic on room air.
He was transferred here for CHF management and for repeat catheterization.
On transfer his oxygen status appeared improved after diuresis and patient seemed more comfortable.
Further diuresis was stopped as his creatinine trended upward the following day.
Heparin was started.
The patient was therefore started on heparin on HD 2.
Heparin was discontinued for this reason.
Planned catheterization on HD 3 was therefore deferred.
GI was consulted and they planned for endoscopy to be done on [**2-6**] prior to his catheterization.
BP and pulse remained stable until the afternoon of HD 5. .
It was believed the hypotension was secondary to posterior ischemia given the anatomy of his CAD and his EKG changes .
This was not reported to the medical team until the afternoon of HD 7.
GI consult was notified and he was taken to the intensive care unit for endoscopy and further monitoring.
He required 1-2units PRBCs daily.
He was treated with PPI IV.
He was continued on aspirin and plavix given recent MI and s/p cardiac cath with stent placement which likely contributed to persistent bleeding.
Eventually, the melanic stools and BRBPR resolved and HCT remained stable.
## Cardiovascular disease, s/p PCI to OM1 a) Ischemia: CAD s/p CABG.
He is s/p BMS to OMI and was treated with aspirin and plavix, metoprolol and lisinopril.
He was treated with lisinopril, metoprolol, diuresis.
He is not on anticoagulation given history of groin hematoma and GIB.
## Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], continue home regimen of imuran, prednisone, and mestinon.
The patient had previously been on cell cept instead of prednisone for myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] but due to insurance coverage issues, cellcept was discontinued.
The patient required intubation in [**2-/2107**] after first stopping cellcept and had to be started on prednisone.
His outpatient regimen was eventually restarted and his creatinine remained at baseline at the time of discharge.
