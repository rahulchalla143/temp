His coumadin was being held as it was supratherapeutic prior to discharge (INR = 3.4).
Therefore, coumadin was not on the active medication list when the patient was sent to rehab, though it is listed within the hospital course of the discharge summary.
The need to continue coumadin and check INR daily was communicated to both Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17788**] and to nursing staff at [**Location (un) 42**] Center for rehabilitation.
