The superior vena cava oxygen saturation was elevated suggesting the possibility of partial anomalous pulmonary venous return, of unknown significance.
Successful placement of two overlapping Cypher drug-eluting stents in the proximal (3.0 x 23 mm) and mid-LAD (2.5 x 28 mm) after successful rotational atherectomy using a 1.5 mm burr.
Successful balloon angioplasty of chronically, totally occluded diagonal with a 2.5 mm balloon.
Successful placement of drug-eluting stents in proximal-mid LAD.
Successful balloon angioplasty of diagonal branch.
CAD:  Pt was admitted with stuttering chest pain and troponin leak, worrisome for progression of his presumed CAD, given his last stress was 2 years ago.
Integrillin was used for 18 hours and he was plavix loaded.
Mr.[**Known lastname 105524**] was maintained on aspirin, plavix, statin (low dose [**3-5**] medication interactions), and beta-blockade.
His ACE inhibitor was stopped [**3-5**] hypotension (see below) and will not be re-started (he may actually not require an ACE based on the reversal trial).
He was volume overloaded on admission and was diuresed with IV lasix.
He required dopamine gtt and was admitted to the CCU after the cath, then transitioned to neosynephrine.
He required a vasopressor for 4 days.
He was also treated with stress dose steroids and emperic antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn given history of MRSA and pseudomonas).
During his second CCU transfer (transferred twice to the CCU during this admission), he was aggressively diuresed, and dropped his blood pressure acutely after a 5L diuresis over two days with the addition of captopril.
He required dopamine for only a few hours.
Diuresis was halted and he was kept negative, with return of his blood pressure.
Volume overloaded on admission and IV lasix used to diurese.
Subsequently, he was continued to be diuresed with a lasix drip while in the CCU, titrating to PCWP (were in the low 20's with a cardiac output/index 9.9/3.6).
His heart failure regimen will include anti-ischemic meds, in addition to beta-blockade and standing PO lasix.
ID:  Pt was admitted with LE cellulitis for which he was treated with IV oxacillin.
He remained afebrile and without leukocytosis, until he went to the CCU, where he developed ventilator-associated pneumonia for which he was broadly covered with vanc/zosyn for a two week course.
It was unclear whether or not pulmonary edema was a component of his diffuse infiltrates, as his fluid balance is difficult to assess on physical exam secondary to obesity, therefore a swan ganz catheter was inserted which demonstrated an elevated wedge pressure.
Aggressive diuresis was begun with a lasix drip.
He was treated with ARDS protocol (low lung volumes and oxygenation sparingly) and aggressive diuresis.
While in the CCU the patient was given stress dose steroids while on the ventilator, however post-extubation was weaned back down to his maintenance dose of 20 mg.  8.
Guaiac positive stools/Anemia:  He was found to have guaiac positive stools during the admission, and a stable anemia, with one hematocrit drop on the day before the second transfer to the CCU at which time he received a PRBC transfusion.
He was noted to become quite lethargic, with slurred speech following his oxycontin doses.
While in the CCU on the ventilator he was not given any opiates, and after extubation he was given only 20 mg of Oxycontin TID.
It is suggested that he not recieve the extraordinarily high doses of opiates that he requests, both secondary to extreme lethargy with potential contribution to hypotension, as well as the fact that 20 mg kept him pain free.
