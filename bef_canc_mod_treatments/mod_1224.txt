Evacuation of epidural abscess with debridement and     extensive incision and drainage.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 53-year-old male who is well known to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] from previous surgeries including resection of posterior cranial fossa tumor two years ago.
He had approximately 8 weeks ago presented with an abscess of his skin at the level of his neck wound from his brain surgery approximately 2 years ago.
The patient at that time had a neck exploration, washout, and primary closure.
The patient was placed on IV antibiotics.
After the antibiotic course had been finished and re-imaging showed stable contrast enhancing signal changes in the posterior fascia, we followed the patient with serial labs showing a rebound elevation of CRP and ESR.
Since Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] was concerned of a deep wound infection around the hardware, we decided to bring the patient back for elective surgery for exploration as well as a shunt tap.
