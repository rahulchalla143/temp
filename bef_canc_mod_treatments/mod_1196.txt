On prior admissions, further invasive testing was discussed, and the patient and HCP opted for more conservative measures including transfusions and iron supplementation.
No NG lavage was performed given patient's stability and multiple prior similar presentations.
Patient was given a protonix bolus and started on a drip.
He was admitted to the ICU for further management.
Specifically denies dizziness, chest pain, SOB, palpitations or other symptoms currently.
Incontinent of urine and stool at baseline.
Also reports left arm pain when his arm "gets cold," which is responsive to tylenol and has been present for several weeks.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Past Medical History: # Anemia, multifactorial as below, baseline HCT 28 # Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (Coomb's +, warm autoantibody), on prednisone 10mg Po daily # Listeria Endocarditis s/p AVR, suppressive amoxicillin stopped due to hemolytic anemia # Aortic mechanical valve, recently Coumadin resistant so intermittently on Lovenox bridge, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] # hx recent GI bleeds: colonoscopy [**1-10**]: noted normal colon with melanotic stool in terminal ileum # GERD: EGD [**12/2159**] Polyp in the area of the papilla; found on the wall opposite the ampulla.
# H/o presyncope # CKD Cr 1.6-2.0  Stage III # CAD s/p NSTEMI [**7-10**] # Chronic CHF, likely diastolic, ([**9-9**] EF=50%) # Hyperlipidemia # Hypertension # Depression vs adjustment disorder after death of brother # Prostate cancer- s/p radiation # Bladder/bowel incontinence # Right lateral malleolus stage 1 pressure ulcer # Dementia   Social History: Never smoked, no EtOH or other drugs.
Uses wheelchair typically.
A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]M with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, mechanical aortic valve on coumadin and recurrent GIB, who presents with low HCT and guaiac positive stool.
He had dark guaiac pos stools, but has had work up in past including colonoscopy and capsule endoscopy without finding source of bleed.
CBC should be monitored periodically as well as stool output for recurrent bleeding.
GI team was aware of him, but since prior EGD/Colonoscopy has failed to reveal a source, decided conservative treatment was the best.
Patient on brdiging IV Hep/Warfarin.
Cardiology felt the risk was not well definable and not worth it, so he was continued on anticoagulation.
His INR was reveresed in the ICU with Vit K and he was restarted on IV heparin drip (wt based protocol without bolus) to bridge until therapeutic INR on warfarin.
He was started on cipro 500mg Q12H with plans for a 7 day course.
He was otherwise not inattentive as usually seen with acute delierum, and his psychosis was not agitated.
He received one nightime dose of Haldol 0.25mg on [**2160-4-29**] and slept very well without PM or [**2160-4-30**] AM recurrent hallucinations (though patient has good recollection of the hallucinations).
# Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia: Chronic - is on Prednisone for this.
At the time this diagnosis was originally made, the patient was on Amoxicillin, so there was some concern at that time that Penicillin associated drug hemolyis was possible.
# GERD: Initially he was treated with PPI IV BID and subsequently transitioned to PO.
