An intramedullary rod and interlocking screws have been removed from the tibia.
The alignment, however, is unchanged.IMPRESSION: Status post removal of intramedullary rod from the tibia and placement of an external fixation device across known tibia and fibula fractures.
CXR [**2177-11-4**]: New ET tube tip is 4.3 cm above the carina.
Patient is post median sternotomy.
Left PICC tip remains in the left subclavian vein.
Fragments of soft tissue with gangrenous necrosis.
Cut off of bone marrow activity at the site of white cell uptake suggests the white cell uptake is secondary to osteomyelitis involving the distal third ofthe right tibia.
Cut off of bone marrow activity at the site of white cell uptake is suggestive of osteomyelitis involving the distal third of the right tibia.
Tib/Fib in OR [**2177-10-10**]: FINDINGS: Some fluoroscopic images from the operating room demonstrate interval removal of the intramedullary rod with proximal and distal interlocking screws within the tibia.
CXR [**2177-9-29**]: Mild pulmonary edema has developed since [**9-6**] superimposed on chronic atelectasis at the lung bases, mild chronic interstitial abnormality, severe pulmonary hypertension and vascular engorgement and moderate cardiomegaly.
Fluoro Placement of PICC [**2177-9-29**]: IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided single lumen 4-French PICC line placement via the brachial venous approach.
Pathology [**2177-9-23**]: DIAGNOSIS: Right foot tissue and bone (A):Acute osteomyelitis.
Circumferential edema within the lower extremity soft tissues, worse in the area of skin ulceration as described above.
Enlarged right inguinal lymph node as described.
Distal right tibial and fibular fractures status post ORIF of tibial fracture.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 14323**] is a 30 yo F w/PMHx sx for ESRD on HD, SLE, HTN, and tib/fib fracture w/ hardware repair c/b bacteremia s/p course of antibiotics who presented with RLE pain, swelling, erythema, fever, and hypotension.
This phlegmon extended to the anterior tibial cortex and distal interlocking screws.
Meanwhile, all of the patient's antibiotics were held awaiting the redeclaration of the patient's infectious nidus in her leg.
Patient was restarted on antibiotics including cipro, daptomycin, aztreonam.
A bone marrow scan was completed on [**2177-10-28**] to investigate progression of her infection compared with a scan on [**2177-10-17**], which was found to be unchanged.
On [**11-1**] she was started on Meropenem in addition to bactrim.
Pt had a short MICU course surrounding the [**Month/Year (2) 6024**] due to hypotension likely [**1-10**] epidural and narcotics for pain control.
Pt will undergo extensive PT and eventually be fitted with a prosthesis.
Pain control LLE pain: Patient remained on PCA for pain relief and was followed by the chronic pain service.
She progressively began to use less of her PCA and was weaned to oral medications.
She was continued on fentanyl patch, oral dilaudid, amitryptiline, and lyrica.
Pt followed by chronic pain service and PCA dose converted to long acting narcotic (fentanyl patch at 125mcg/hr) with 4-8mg po dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
Also started on topamax for neuropathic/phantom limb pain .
She will require hemodialysis three times a week.
Hypotension: On [**9-30**] s/p a wash out/vac change with orthopedics, Ms. [**Known lastname 14323**] required Neosynephrine in PACU for high narcotic requirement with hypotension.
On [**10-4**] after yet another day of dialysis and going to the OR with orthopedics, Ms. [**Known lastname 14323**] returned to the floor in agonizing pain and was given a total of 3mg dilaudid IV in addition to PCA.
On [**10-14**], she had dialysis and subsequently returned to the OR for vac change.
She was started on pressors and stress dose steroids and a femoral line was placed.
She again improved, was taken off pressors and stress dose steroids, femoral line removed and was transferred back to the floor on [**10-16**].
Her HD schedule was changed so that she would not have hemodialysis on the same day as the OR washout and vac change (from T/Th/Sat to M/W/F) schedule and she tolerated 2 weeks of vacuum changes without an episode of hypotension.
On [**2177-11-4**], the patient went back to the operating room to remove the vacuum and to continue with wet-to-dry dressing changes.
She was sent to the SICU for recurrent hypotension/hemorrhage after wound debridement and placement of VAC sponge.
She received a large amount of fluid (3.5 L fluid, 4 units PRBCs, and was initially on pressors (Levo 0.08).
Pt again had a short micu course [**11-21**] to [**11-24**] for hypotension surrounding her [**Month/Year (2) 6024**] and subsequent revision.
Hypotension was attributed to narcotics and epidural.
Anemia: The patient received epoeitin at hemodialysis for her anemia.
She had been on 50 mg IV hydrocortisone q8hrs in MICU, but was returned to 5 mg PO prednisone on the floor.
