Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed common bile duct of [**9-16**] millimeter diameter and gallbladder containing gallstones.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Following the results of the right upper quadrant ultrasound, it was felt that the patient had a dilated common bile duct secondary to obstruction by gallstone and the patient was treated with Ampicillin, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl and given intravenous fluids.
An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was attempted but cannulation of the biliary duct was unsuccessful despite multiple attempts because the patient became very agitated and uncooperative and therefore, the procedure was aborted.
Original impression was that this elevated troponin represented demand ischemia imposed on the heart by the pancreatitis and the cholestatic picture in the setting of aortic stenosis/aortic regurgitation.
Given the rising trend in the troponin, as well as need for general anesthesia to perform the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, it was decided that the patient should be evaluated by cardiac catheterization.
Severe but not critical aortic stenosis with moderate aortic regurgitation, severe pulmonary arterial hypertension, systemic systolic arterial hypertension, severe left ventricular diastolic heart failure, patent left internal mammary artery - left anterior descending, patent saphenous vein graft OM and saphenous vein graft posterior descending artery, presumed occluded saphenous vein graft - diagonal and severe disease in unusual OM4 to AV groove with complex OM lesion arising from bifurcation and distal lesion with limited runoff.
Stenting of the OM4 would be associated with increase of stent thrombosis given poor runoff.
It is doubtful that balloon angioplasty of this OM which supplies only a small area of myocardium would significantly improve his perioperative risk of cardiac events.
However, a MRCP demonstrated persistence of gallstones in the common bile duct, necessitating an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedure and sphincterotomy.
During the hospitalization and at the time that the patient was in a pancreatitis abdominal pain picture, intravenous fluids were given resulting in an increase in total body weight and fluid retention.
The patient's platelet count on admission was 55,000 and remained in the 40,000 to 50,000 range until the patient was transfused platelets prior to the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedure.
DI[**Last Name (STitle) 408**]E INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient as of [**2198-12-23**], is expected to be discharged to home pending endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2198-12-24**], and with recommended follow-up by primary care physician as well as by his primary cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1399**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17915**] and it has been recommended that he follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] of cardiothoracic surgery for an outpatient evaluation and potential consideration of an aortic valve repair.
Also during this hospitalization and while the patient was on telemetry, he demonstrated frequent premature ventricular contractions as well as runs of ventricular tachycardia.
Medications and discharge information will be dictated by the intern taking over the service on [**2198-12-24**].
