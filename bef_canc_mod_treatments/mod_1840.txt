DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Perforated appendicitis, status post appendectomy and exploratory laparotomy, hypovolemia, acute renal failure HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old woman who had complaints of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for two to three days prior to admission.
Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.
Postoperatively, the patient required multiple fluid boluses in the immediate postoperative period in order to maintain a good urine output.
The decision was made to continue attempting fluid resuscitation and simultaneously give 10 mg of Lasix.
She did require IV fluid resuscitation to maintain a good urine output.
Her subjective symptoms of shortness of breath and objective slight decrease in oxygen saturation returned with the chest physical therapy, Albuterol nebulizers, and ambulation.
She required periodic replacement of potassium and magnesium.
The patient was maintained on Levaquin and Flagyl throughout the postoperative period and transitioned to p.o.
She had been restarted on her Zestril and hydrochlorothiazide prior to discharge and tolerated this well.
Zestril 5 mg q.d.
Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.
Percocet p.r.n.
Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
It was decided not to continue the patient on outpatient antibiotics given her white count and the fact that she had been afebrile for more than 24 hours prior to discharge.
