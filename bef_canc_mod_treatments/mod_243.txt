End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday     and Friday secondary to lupus.
History of VSD status post corrective surgery at age 13.
Status post left oophorectomy related to IUD-associated     infection.
Most recently is status post cadaveric renal on [**8-31**], [**2174**], complicated by delayed graft function.
ALLERGIES:  Levaquin, cephalosporin, Unasyn, vancomycin and derivative, Demerol and meperidine.

daily for a left axillary thrombus, Rapamune 6 mg once a day, the patient at that time was on Linezolid because of a gram-negative staph urinary tract infection, and on Coumadin for a non-occlusive thrombus of left axillary vein that was documented on [**2175-10-24**].
In the emergency room was intubated and sedation.
Exploratory laparotomy and transplant nephrectomy was performed due to a ruptured kidney.
A French [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was brought out through a separate incision and sutured in place with 3-0 nylon.
The patient remained intubated and was taken to the ICU in stable and satisfactory condition.
The patient had a right femoral arterial line and left triple lumen.
The patient continued with hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
CAT scan was obtained postoperatively on [**2175-11-8**], to evaluate the abdomen and hematoma which demonstrated interval removal of the transplant kidney with extravasation of right extraperitoneal __________ .
He was placed for tube feeds, and tube feeds were started for nutrition.
Tube feeds were continued.
The patient was also continued on a Fentanyl patch for pain control.
Chest tube was placed that evening.
The patient required another catheter for drainage of collection.
Antibiotics were changed to Meropenem.
Linezolid and gentamicin were discontinued.
Nepro tube feeds were started per recommendations from nutrition.
Tube feeds were advanced.
On [**2175-11-20**], the patient needed central venous access, and there was successful placement of an 8.5 French 16 cm long four-lumen catheter via the left common femoral vein.
Also the venogram demonstrated occlusion of the left IJ and the left subclavian vein with multiple collaterals, and also the right IJ was shown to be occluded on ultrasound scan.
Using an endotracheal tube, which was flexible, it was documented that her airway was clear.
On [**2175-11-30**], the patient had an open tracheostomy performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] because of respiratory failure and failure to wean off the ventilator status post tracheostomy tube with a 7 French non-fenestrated tracheostomy tube.
The case was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 816**] who requested drainage of subhepatic fluid collection.
This was drained with an 8 French pigtail catheter     which was left in place.
There was a JP drain in the right pericolic fluid     collection which was in good position.
Persistent, although smaller multiloculated fluid     collection along the right flank, status post removal of     drainage catheter.
The patient continued on antibiotics for pseudomonas coverage and VRE bacteremia related to lines and questionable abdominal fluid collections.
Later that day on [**2175-12-22**], the patient had a CT- guided abdominal drainage using CT fluoroscopic guidance.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Physical therapy and occupational therapy met with the patient for evaluation and treatment and definitely felt that the patient needed to go to rehab.
Feeding tube ends at the pylorus.
Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.
Pigtail catheter was removed on [**2174-12-21**], and tracheostomy was downsized, and there were no adverse events over night.
intake 640, tube feeds 710; does not void.
vancomycin and Cipro until her follow-up appointment with infectious disease on [**2176-1-9**].
At that time, abdominal/pelvic CT will be obtained to assess fluid collections to help define further duration of antibiotics.
On [**2175-12-22**], another CAT scan was performed to evaluate the abdominal collections after the drains have been removed.
Dilaudid regimen and to discontinue her IV Dilaudid.
Currently the patient is on Cipro for pseudomonas.
The patient is also on linezolid for enterococcus and history of VRE.
The patient continues on vancomycin for prior C-diff.
The patient will need to have a CBC with diff and a post dialysis tobramycin level.
Also the facility should make an appointment with transplant surgery potentially on the same day; please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**].
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Prednisone 5 mg daily, Mucomyst solution q.4-6 hours as needed, heparin 5000 units subcu b.i.d., vancomycin 125, which is the oral liquid, q.6 hours, Prevacid 30 mg suspension 1 tablet daily, Albuterol aerosol puff inhalation 1-2 puffs q.6 hours, Lopressor 4.5 b.i.d., Fentanyl patch 100 mcg, please change every 72 hours, __________  750 q.24 hours, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Dilaudid 2 mg tablets 1-3 tablets q.2 hours p.r.n., Linezolid 600 mg q.12 hours, Ativan 1 mg IV q.6 hours, tobramycin as needed, the last dose was 140 mg, but please check level prior to giving dose.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  This is a 28-year-old woman with lupus nephritis status post renal transplant on [**2175-9-1**], with acute rejection and subsequent graft rupture.
Peritoneal abscess/necrotizing fascitis.
