She was weaned off supplemental O2 and continued on HD, where some of the excess fluid was removed.
Her PICC was removed at discharge.
3) Macrocytic anemia: Initial hematocrit drop in setting of IV fluid resuscitation.
She was given epo at HD, and later iron was added.
4) Afib with tachy-brady: Metoprolol was held throughout the admission as the patient had no hypertension or tachycardia.
Her INR was initially supratherapeutic and vitamin K was given.
It later became subtherapeutic and her warfarin was restarted.
