There is a predominantly hypodense right frontal and right temporal extra- axial collection, which is similar in size from [**2185-8-20**], and may reflect evolving post-surgical blood products.
However, there is a new left acute-subacute subdural hematoma overlying the left frontal and parietal convexity with a fluid level, measuring up to 20 mm in width maximally.
A hypodensity in the right basal ganglia may be chronic.
Osseous structures reveal craniotomy defect in the right frontal bone.
Evolving hemorrhagic products in the right frontal subdural space, from prior surgery.
The collection now measures 12 mm in maximal radial dimension (2A:13).
A hyperdense focus (2A:15) within the left sylvian fissure is likely due to layering of blood products in addition to different slice position on this examination; however, a small new bleed cannot be completely excluded.
The patient is status post remote right craniotomy and status post left craniotomy.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the ICU/neurosurgery service following vague complaints of right sided weaknes and gait abnormality.
She had been on lovenox for the treatment of a subsegmental pulmonary embolus that was diagnosed on [**8-20**].
She was taken to the operating room on [**9-5**] for a craniotomy to decompress the subdural collection.
The following day on [**9-6**], an IVC filter was placed, as she would be unable to continue on her lovenox therapy in the setting of intracranial hemorrhage.
She again tolerated this procedure well and was transferred out of the ICU to the neurosurgical floor.
