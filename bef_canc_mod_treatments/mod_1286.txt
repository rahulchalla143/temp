Pertinent Results: LABORATORY DATA: CBC ([**2188-9-16**]): 9.3<8.2/26.4/186 MCV 99.0 RDW 17.3 BMP ([**2188-9-16**]): 136/5.1/99/23/118/5.4<151 Ca 7.8, Phos 6.5, Mg 2.7  Coags ([**2188-9-16**]): PT 11.7, INR 1.1, PTT 32.6 LFTs ([**2188-8-31**]): ALT 36, AST 62, Alk Phos 127, TBili 0.9, Lipase 28 HgbA1C ([**2188-8-25**]): 8.6% Ammonia ([**2188-8-31**]): 14  STUDIES: ECG ([**2188-8-27**], post-code): Sinus rhythm with left axis deviation.
EEG ([**2188-8-27**]): This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of continuous slowing of the background activity with 5-7 Hz theta and occasional [**2-12**] Hz delta activity.
In this patient, hypoxic ischemic brain injury, hypothermia and use of sedative medications are all potential causes of diffuse slowing.
ABI ([**2188-9-15**]): On the right side, monophasic Doppler waveforms were seen at the right femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries.

underwent angiogram with distal superficial femoral artery angioplasty and stenting with subsequent PEA arrest (HR 40s, pulseless, and apneic) in the PACU likely [**3-13**] apnea from sedation (versed and propofol) where she was down for approximately 5-10 min.
ACLS was initiated with CPR, epinephrine x2, and atropine x1.
She did not respond to IV diuresis with torsemide and metolazone.
As such, she was evaluated by nephrology and in the setting of increasing BUN and volume overload, they recommended initiation of dialysis which she has now been started on.
Etiology for AMS is likely multi-factorial, including hypoxic encephalopathy s/p arrest, uremic metabolic encephalopaty, and labile serum glucose.
Early after surgery she had elevated white count suggesting infectious etiology for AMS and her right internal jugular line was removed with subsequent normalizing of WBC count.
PNA was suspected on [**2188-9-17**] and treated empirically for 7 days of Vancomycin and Cefipime, but remained afebrile with normal white count and negative blood and urine cultures taken before Abx admin.
Had a cognitive-linguistic evaluation on [**9-24**] that showed some deficits with complex manipulation of information, including short-term recall, executive functioning, and attention.
Recommended that she continue to receive cognitive-linguistic tx with SLP/OT here and upon d/c.
# PVD with ischemic right foot: Admitted directly from clinic, superficial right femoral stent was placed [**8-27**].
Patient received Plavix x 1 month.
Right heel ulcer was extensively debrided by podiatry with failure to heal despite daily dressing change with hydrogel and coverage with Augmentin x 14 days, ultimately eroding to the calcaneus.
Pain was covered with oxycodone and acetaminophen.
Recommended continuing beta-blocker and did not recommend stress test.
# ESRD: History of nephrotic range proteinuria and baseline Cr 2.9-3.1 developed post-PEA ischemic ATN, given numerous muddy brown casts in urine sediment.
Patient developed volume overload that did not respond to diuresis with metolazone and toresemide with fluid restriction, and HD was initiated on [**2188-9-16**].
A temporary line was placed initially due to epistaxis prior to anesthesia, which the patient removed during agitation overnight [**9-19**], tunneled catheter on the right placed [**2188-9-22**].
Received bilateral vein mapping.
Transplant contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding graft/fistula placement.
They plan on doing this procedure after Ms. [**Known lastname 449**] completes rehab.
Tolerated self-removal of right IJ line without significant blood loss.
Desmopressin therapy initiated [**Date range (1) 98762**], converted to conjugate estrogen [**Date range (1) 22898**].
Stopped SQH, stopped heparin dwell during HD.
# T2DM: Insulin requirement trended up after surgery and then down during final week of admission with concomitant decreased appetite.
Please titrate insulin NPH and sliding scale at rehab.
Covered with vancomycin and cefepime for a 7-day course, from [**9-18**] to [**9-24**].

You were admitted to the [**Hospital3 **] to have a [**Hospital3 1106**] stenting procedure to open up the blood vessels leading to your right foot, so that it might heal better.
After this surgery in the recovery unit, your heart stopped briefly.
You were revived using cardiac life support techniques and you were temporarily put on a cooling protocol to protect your organs.
Unfortunately, this damaged your kidneys to the point where they needed the support of hemodialysis to clear the toxins from your body.
For your foot, podiatry and [**Hospital3 1106**] surgery determined that the ulcer is not healing and that it has gone down to the [**Last Name (LF) 500**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] it will require an amputation below the knee.
