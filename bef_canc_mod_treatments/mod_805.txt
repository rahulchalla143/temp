The patient underwent PTC drain placement initially; however, the drain would not pass the obstruction and therefore only drained externally.
On [**1-6**] the patient underwent a hepaticojejunostomy to correct the biliary stricture.
He was taken to cardiac catheterization for further evaluation.
Bare mental stents were placed in the LAD and RCA.
Given persistent shock a balloon pump was placed in the cath lab and he was brought to the CCU.
He had been started on vanc and zosyn prior to transfer and these were continued given concern for sepsis as a cuase for his persistent hypotension.
He was also placed on dopamine for pressure support.
Fluconazole was added for fungal coverage as the patient is immunosuppressed.
He therefore returned to the operating room on POD 7, for exploration and revision.
On the 24th, the patient had his roux tube capped which was well tolerated.
