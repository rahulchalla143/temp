Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 82 year-old gentleman with history of CAD with NSTEMI s/p cath with DES to LAD in [**2183**], ESRD on HD, DM2, HTN, HLD, Hepatitis C, with recent admission for volume overload and NSTEMI s/p cath with no intervention 1 week ago prior to admission who presented with lethargy, SOB, and volume overload.
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema while in the ED and was briefly on BiPap with improvement in symptoms.
Bipap was removed, per patient request, upon arrival to CCU and tolerated transition to nasal canula well.
Nitroglycerin drip was weaned off slowly.
#  Hypoglycemia: Patient has history of DM2, previously diet-controlled but started on glipizide about four days prior to admission.
He had been maintained on D10 drip in the ED.
Glipizide was held on discharge, and patient was told to return to diet control for his diabetes.
Patient is on HD schedule of MWF at home; he uses tunneled dialysis catheter which had been placed on recent admission.
He was continued on nephrocaps and sevelamir.
Mental status appeared to be secondary to hypoglycemia, improved with D10 and normalization of blood sugars.
#  HTN: Patient is on labetalol 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] at home but continues to have episodes of acute pulmonary edema likely secondary to poorly controlled hypertension.
He was hypertensive in the ED and started on nitro drip for blood pressure control, though he did miss [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] dose of home meds.
Nitroglycerin drip was weaned successfully and pt was continued on home labetalol dose.
He did undergo hemodialysis x1 for fluid removal.
It was considered that pain may have been secondary to foley placement.
Patient had recently been started on 3 day course of phenazopyradine 200 mg Tablet tid, which was not helping symptoms, so it was discontinued during this hospitalization.

You were fluid overloaded so you received medications and dialysis to normalize your fluid levels with improvement of your breathing.
The following changes were made to your medications: - Please START taking Aspirin 81mg daily - Please STOP taking Glypizide as this may have lead to your hypoglycemic episode (i.e., episode of low blood sugar leading to confusoin and lethargy).
- Please STOP taking Phenazopyridine - Please continue to take all of your other home medications as prescribed.
