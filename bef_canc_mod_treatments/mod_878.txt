In brief, the patient is a 63-year-old woman who has undergone a combined liver, kidney transplant who has had recurrent right pleural effusions that had been managed by repeat thoracenteses.
She is currently in the hospital for management for urinary tract infection and has planned to undergo an umbilical hernia repair by the transplant service.
They have asked if we would consider performing a talc pleurodesis in the same setting.
We also discussed other risks of the operation and include bleeding, infection, pneumonia, and death.
She is willing to proceed and we will schedule for surgery for tomorrow [**2153-11-28**].
