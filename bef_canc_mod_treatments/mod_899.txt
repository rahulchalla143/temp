You were admitted on [**2139-8-22**] for close monitoring after an antibiotic related allergic drug reaction.
You had been taking the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin for your recent right lower extremity cellulitis, when you developed significant facial swelling.
The swelling has now resolved and your foot looks well-healed at this time having completed your full treatment of Vancomycin and Cefepime for this infection.
Given this sudden decrease in your respiratory function, you were placed on oxygen and received a chest X-ray on [**2139-8-26**] that revealed significant fluid around your lungs, known as pleural effusions.
Approximately 1.5 liters were removed from around your right lung on [**2139-8-28**], and the fluid was sent for studies which revealed that it was largely free of protein and cells.
Thus, rather than remove the fluid again, we initiated you on intravenous diuretic therapy (Lasix) at 20 MG twice a day.
You responded well to the medication, putting out nearly 2L more that you were taking in.
You had some elevated blood sugars which were may have been from recent steroids given in the emergency room for controlling your allergy symptoms.
Given your history of GI bleeding and recent use of ibuprofen you should continue taking a daily anti-acid medication called omeprazole and stop using any ibuprofen as this medicine can promote GI bleeding and worsen kidney function.
MEDICATION CHANGES/INSTRUCTIONS: 1) Decrease usual simvastatin to 20mg daily (this is due to possible interaction with amlodipine) 2) Please do not take ibuprofen, instead take Tylenol 650mg q6hrs as needed for headaches and/or leg pain 3) Continue glargine at 3 Units in morning and 7 Units at bedtime and see attached full Humalog Sliding Scale insulin dosing schedule which is [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] 4) Please restart omeprazole 40mg daily 5) Please start ferrous sulfate 325mg iron tablets twice daily 6) If you develop constipation on iron, please take over the counter colace 100mg [**Hospital1 **] as needed to help soften stools 7) Hold valsartan on discharge 8) Increase metoprolol tartrate to 37.5 mg twice a day .
Otherwise, please continue taking your usual home medications as previously prescribed.
