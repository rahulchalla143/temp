Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo woman with diastolic CHF, CAD s/p RCA stent, DM, HTN, restrictive pulmonary disease (on 2L home O2), OSA, pulmonary HTN, CKD, who originally presented to an OSH in respiratory distress.
She was intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU where she was treated for septic shock in the setting of pneumonia.
In the MICU an arterial line and right IJ were placed and she was started on pressors, vancomycin, and zosyn.
She eventually improved hemodynamically so pressors were stopped, she was extubated, and the vanco and zosyn were switched to levofloxacin and she was transferred to the floor.
She completed a total of 14 days of antibiotics and the levofloxacin was stopped.
She was restarted on all of her home medications including the advair.
Her left arm PICC site was clean and w/o erythema, but the tip was sent for culture when the PICC was pulled on [**10-9**].
It is unlikely that there is any source of infection, and the eosinophilia suggests that there is likely a hypersensitivity reaction, perhaps to the antibiotics since all other medications the pt is currently taking are her home meds.
The last day of levofloxacin was today ([**10-10**]).
The pt would benefit from physicial therapy to help regain her stregth.
She is written for morphine 7.5-15 mg q4 PRN, with the intention to switch to tylenol when possible.
Continued home dose of ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily.
# Diabetes: Blood sugars were poorly controlled in the MICU, requiring an insulin drip.
After transfer to the floor we uptitrated her insulin and she is now on her home dose of novolog ISS and lantus 55 units every morning and 65 units every evening.
# CAD s/p RCA stent: Continued plavix 75 mg daily.
# Depression: Stable, patient was restarted on her home dose of fluoxetine 20 mg daily.
