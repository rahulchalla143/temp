Admission Date:  [**2117-10-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2117-10-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-6-8**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Company 191**] MED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 71-year-old female with a past medical history significant for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, with a history of bilateral pneumonia with chest tube placement, status post VATS without a diagnosis, and status post decortication and empyema, history of congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram in [**2117-8-4**] with an ejection fraction of approximately 40%, with positive wall motion abnormality, also a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and C. difficile, who presented to [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department on [**10-16**] with complaints of dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath, along with hypoxia and lower extremity swelling.
[**2117-8-8**]:  Bilateral pneumonia with empyema, status post VATS and decortication, complicated by pneumothorax secondary to thoracentesis, status post bilateral chest tubes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, C. difficile, history of gastrointestinal bleed, H. pylori positive, history of bilateral pneumonia with bilateral chest tube, VATS and decortication, history of congestive heart failure, ejection fraction of 40%, with wall motion abnormalities and 2+ mitral regurgitation, subtotal thyroidectomy, history of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bilateral adrenal masses, cerebrovascular accident 11 years ago, emphysema, cataracts, peripheral vascular disease, and pneumothorax x 2.
Initial physical examination, laboratories, and initial radiologic studies will be dictated as an addendum to this discharge summary.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   While in the Emergency Department, the patient underwent thoracentesis for her pleural effusions.
The patient was then admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for management of her volume overload/congestive heart failure.
While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was placed on BiPAP and was diuresed approximately 3 liters.
She was also started on Digoxin.
Her ACE inhibitor was continued, and lasix was administered in order to produce diuresis.
She was continued on her albuterol and Atrovent metered dose inhalers.
She was given nebulizers as needed.
She was status post thoracentesis as described above in the Emergency Department.
No further intervention was made to this pneumothorax.
To be noted also that, throughout the admission, there was no evidence for pneumonia, and no antibiotics were administered.
The patient was diuresed and given BiPAP as described above during her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay.
Intravenous diuresis was continued for one day while on the general medical floor.
This dose was adjusted in order to achieve a diuresis of approximately -500 cc/day.
The patient's oxygen saturation status was markedly improved from that upon admission, however, she continued to require 2 to 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula in order to maintain oxygen saturations around 93%.
The patient was continued on her aspirin and ACE inhibitor.
The patient was continued on Lipitor 10 mg by mouth daily at bedtime.
The patient was continued on her ACE inhibitor because it was felt that the patient's cause of acute on chronic renal failure was most likely secondary to poor cardiac output.
It was felt that ACE inhibitor would assist by afterload reduction.
The patient had not been on insulin, but was started on NPH insulin while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, along with a regular insulin sliding scale and a twice a day standing dose of regular insulin subcutaneously.
The patient's sugars remained in good control on her twice a day NPH scale along with a regular insulin sliding scale for additional coverage.
There was no indication for transfusion, and no indication for iron administration.
She should try to maintain approximately 1 liter/day of fluid intake.
Activity:  The patient should resume normal activity as tolerated under the direction of Physical Therapy at [**Hospital3 **] facility.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   Lasix 50 mg by mouth twice a day, Captopril 12.5 mg by mouth three times a day, albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers, NPH insulin 20 units subcutaneously every morning and 10 units subcutaneously every evening, regular insulin sliding scale, aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily, Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once daily, Synthroid 75 mcg by mouth once daily, Protonix 40 mg by mouth once daily.
