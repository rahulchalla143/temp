Admission Date:  [**2166-6-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2166-7-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2092-11-3**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 29876**] is a 73-year-old male who presented during a routine physical examination with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8430**] with an abnormal EKG.
Given these findings the patient was referred to the cardiothoracic surgery for coronary artery bypass grafting evaluation.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Nexium 40 mg p.o.
Lipitor 5 mg p.o.
Zestril 40 mg p.o.
Glucophage 500 mg p.o.
Atenolol 50 mg p.o.
Triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide 37.5/25 mg p.o.
Clarinex 5 mg p.o.
Advair 500/50 mg puff b.i.d.
Abdomen: Soft, obese but nontender to palpation with positive bowel sounds and no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly and no inguinal lymphadenopathy.
After obtaining a successful preoperative evaluation, the patient underwent an uncomplicated coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 (left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to right posterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to diagonal) on [**2166-6-26**].
Postoperatively the patient was extubated and transfused with three units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma with two units of platelets.
The patient also maintained good oxygen saturation post extubation and maintained adequate blood pressures after Lasix administration and beta blocker initiation.
By postoperative day number two the patient's Foley catheter was removed.
That evening the patient developed an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation to 130-140 beats per minute which was treated initially with 10 mg of Lopressor and 500 cc of normal saline bolus to maintain the systolic blood pressure greater than 100 mmHg.
Because of the hypotensive episode, 150 mg of amiodarone bolus was administered and the patient's rhythm converted to sinus.
The patient underwent an uncomplicated sternal debridement and localization of substernal fat and closure with wires.
Postoperatively the patient was taken to the cardiac surgery recovery unit for close observation and maintained on SIMV ventilation, and Zosyn.
Given chest x-ray findings which showed bibasilar atelectasis and rather unimpressive bronchoscopy findings, the patient was initiated on aggressive chest physiotherapy regimen.
Vancomycin was also added during this time.
The patient was then extubated on postoperative day number two following the sternal debridement and the patient maintained good oxygen saturation on four liters nasal cannula.
By postoperative day number eight the decision was made to take the patient back to the operating room for another sternal debridement with placement of split-thickness skin graft on the sternal wound site.
This procedure occurred uneventfully however during the following day the patient required right chest tube placement to maintain reexpansion of the lung for the presence of pneumothorax.
The patient's condition continued to improve following the second sternal debridement and split-thickness skin graft.
Despite the overall clinical improvement the patient continued to require ventilatory support following the second sternal debridement.
Subsequently the patient's narcotic usage was decreased and the patient was continued to be weaned off of the ventilatory support.
By postoperative day number 13, the patient's pressure and oxygen saturation maintained adequate levels and physical therapy reevaluation was sought.
By [**2166-7-28**] the patient's white blood cell count rose moderately and urinalysis indicated the patient had developed a urinary tract infection following prolonged catheterization.
The Foley catheter was promptly removed and the patient was initiated on oral ciprofloxacin.
By postoperative day number 17 following the second debridement, the patient's graft site continued to take well with no evidence of erythema or purulent drainage and the patient continued to progress adequately while being oriented x 3.
At this time after discussion with the plastic surgery service the decision was made to discharge the patient to the rehabilitation service for wound care as well as for physical therapy for endurance training purposes.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to RPDA, SVG to OM, SVG to diagonal).
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
Lasix 40 mg p.o.
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 50 mg p.o.
Haldol p.r.n.
Vitamin C. 12.
Potassium 20 mEq p.o.
The patient's Lasix dosage should be administered for approximately two weeks.
