After significant volume reduction and initiation of midodrine pressors were d/c'd and pt was able to maintain adaquate BP's.
He received 2 units of blood in the ED.
Also, due to dropping hematocrits, he received blood on several occasions.

The patient has atrial fibrillation; however, he is not on Coumadin secondary to his recent GI bleed.
On admission, his nodal blocking agents were held secondary to his hypotension and were not restarted secondary to his persistent hypotension and borderline pressures.
His catheter was changed twice and he was also eventually given a 3 day course of fluconazole.
