CXR ([**2120-2-22**]): In comparison with study of [**2-21**], there has been placement of a left IJ catheter that extends to the upper to mid portion of the SVC.
His hypotension was believed due to a combination of impaired cardiac output from infiltrative cardiac amyloidosis, autonomic dysfunction, and decreased effective circulating volume secondary to amyloid infiltration of peripheral vasculature with resulting capillary leak.
Initially a central line was placed and he was started on vasopressin and norepinephrine.
Midodrine was continued per outpatient regimen.
However, his MAP remained low despite these aggressive interventions.
Given the lack of other treatment options and the rapidly progressive nature of his disease, a goals of care discussion was held on the first hospital day.
With the agreement of his healthcare proxy and the patient, his code status was changed to DNR/DNI.
On the second hospital day, the palliative care service was consulted and it was decided to continue the vasopressin as long as he remained interactive and conscious, but to otherwise withdraw all unnecessary treatments, including close monitoring of urine output and blood pressure.
