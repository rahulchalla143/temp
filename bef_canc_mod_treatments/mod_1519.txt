MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: The patient was on the following medications at the time of admission to [**Hospital1 69**]: Haldol 0.5 mg p.o.
Vistaril 25 mg p.o.
Zyprexa 10 mg p.o.
Dietrol LA 4 mg p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Physical examination at the time of admission to [**Hospital1 69**] revealed the following:  Temperature 100.7; blood pressure 189/83; heart rate of 112; 83% on room air; 93% on six liters.
He was initiated on Levofloxacin 500 mg q.
24 hours as well as Flagyl 500 mg q.
A repeat speech and swallow evaluation with this tensilon was performed with similar results to his initial evaluation -- namely considerable aspiration with inability to propel pureed foods as well as inability to protect his airway.
Oxacillin was added to his antibiotic regimen for further coverage of his aspiration pneumonia and his persistence of a leukocytosis.
On hospital day number ten, consent was obtained from his legal guardian, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], phone #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 108932**] and a percutaneous gastric jejunostomy tube was placed without complications.
Tube feeds were initiated through this gastrojejunostomy tube and the patient tolerated goal feeds of Ultra-Cal at 75 cc an hour.
However, he continued to sound somewhat congested and may be chronically aspirating despite the placement of the gastrojejunostomy tube.
He continues to remain a chronic aspiration risk and was started on Bactrim DS p.o.
It was difficult to determine the baseline mental status of this patient and given the possibility of neuroleptics causing dystonia, interfering with his oral motor weakness, his psychiatric medications were held, though upon further review of his history, he had speech and swallowing difficulties prior to admission.
The psychiatry service was consulted in regards to further evaluation of his dementia as well as recommended medications that would not interfere with his oral and motor function.
Multiple laboratory studies were sent including liver function tests, B-12, folate and TSH and RPR all of which were normal and was started on Trilafon 8 mg by gastrojejunostomy tube twice a day.
The psychiatrist at [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital was informed of his hospital course and will continue further neuropsychiatric evaluation at this facility.
An arterial blood gases was drawn during this event which revealed a pH of 7.17, Pc02 of 87 and P02 of 104, indicative of a respiratory acidosis.
He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for a trial of mask ventilation.
He was also started on stress dose steroids, Solu-Medrol 80 mg intravenous three times a day as well as nebulizer treatments.
He was discharged from the Medical Intensive Care Unit after a three day stay and sent back to the floor, with continuation of treatment for aspiration pneumonia as primary treatment of his dyspnea.
His oxygen requirements gradually tapered throughout the rest of his hospital course, to a requirement of two liters nasal cannula.
His nebs were switched to an as needed basis and he was quickly tapered off of steroids over a three day course in total.
Therefore, he will be discharged on a standing order of 250 cc of free water every six hours through his gastrojejunostomy tube to replenish his free water.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, Psychiatric Unit, where he will have further evaluation of his mental status and indication for Trilafon.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Aspiration pneumonia, status post gastrojejunostomy tube placement.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Trilafon 80 mg by gastrojejunostomy tube twice a day.
