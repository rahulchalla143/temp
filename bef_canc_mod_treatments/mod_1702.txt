Admission Date:  [**2142-7-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2142-7-25**]   Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction thirty years ago who presented with increasing angina over the past year associated with nocturnal orthopnea.
Since he was an otherwise healthy older gentleman, it was determined that he would benefit from coronary artery bypass grafting.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial     infarction thirty years ago.
Atenolol 25 mg q.d.
Dyazide 25/37.5 q.d.
Atorvastatin 10 mg q.d.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Insulin 70/30 60 units q.a.m.
Nitroglycerin p.r.n.
Chem7 revealed sodium 140, potassium 5.4, chloride 107, CO2 20, blood urea nitrogen 41, creatinine 1.8, glucose 194.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted the morning of [**2142-7-16**], and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, saphenous vein graft to OM1, saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery under general anesthesia.
The patient spontaneously converted but continued to have bursts of atrial fibrillation and was therefore started on Amiodarone p.o.
The patient was also started on his preoperative insulin 70/30 at 60 units q.a.m.
The patient was given an amp of D50 in addition to an additional 25 mg Lopressor.
On further investigation, it was found that the patient had a history of over one year of having a sella turcica mass which was completely compressing his internal carotid artery on the left per magnetic resonance scan., The patient's neurologic status continued to improve to baseline at which he was alert and oriented times four with sensation grossly intact, cranial nerves grossly intact except for mild right ptosis and motor strength intact bilaterally.
The patient remained stable hemodynamically with his rate controlled on Lopressor and in sinus rhythm on Amiodarone.
On discharge, with suspected patient mental status change, it was felt to possibly be multifactorial taking into effect his history of an intracranial mass which is chronic with no acute changes found on CT, possibly metabolic with tighter glucose control sought, his postoperative atrial fibrillation controlled on Lopressor and Amiodarone.
