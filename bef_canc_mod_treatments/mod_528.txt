Admission Date: [**2151-6-7**]        Discharge Date: [**2151-6-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-1-27**]        Sex:  F  Service:  OME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56 year old woman with a history of locally advanced Stage 3B gastric cancer status post subtotal gastrectomy who presents with febrile neutropenia and diarrhea.
She had a subtotal gastrectomy in [**Month (only) 958**] with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3928**] postoperative course including sepsis, intubation and small bowel obstruction requiring several re-explorations.
VRE infection and HEPARIN INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA, without clear evidence of thrombosis.
It was a Grade 3, T3, N2 tumor with peri-neural lymphatic invasion.
She is status post subtotal gastrectomy in [**2151-3-15**] that was complicated by sepsis and respiratory failure, small bowel obstruction, encephalopathy and abdominal abscess.
HEPARIN INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA without thrombosis.
Status post lower mandible resection with prosthesis several years ago.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin which causes anaphylaxis, latex which causes a rash, heparin and nickel.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atenolol 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], Protonix 40 mg qd, hydralazine 25 mg tid, Compazine 10 mg q6h, prn, Ativan 0.5 to 1 q6h, prn, K/B/L and oxycodone 5-10 mg q4-6h, prn for pain.
She tolerated the antibiotics without any complications.
The patient was started on Neupogen to increase her counts.
At this point, she had loading with Dilantin and phenobarbital which achieved adequate levels after several days.
One possibility is that she had 5-FU toxicity, perhaps secondary to dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency, although one would not have expected her counts to recover as they did.
She was started on thiamine empirically which may or may not have made a difference, although its use has been reported (micromedex) in similar situations.
She was initially continued on her outpatient medications of atenolol and hydralazine.
However, her blood pressure dropped when she started on the Dilantin and so she was just maintained on atenolol therapy.
Once it became evident she would not require intubation, it was changed back to DNR/DNI which is where she is at this point.
Dilantin 120 mg po q8h.
Colace 100 mg po bid.
Lactulose 30 cc po tid prn, constipation.
Phenobarbital 100 mg NG qd.
Lansoprazole 30 mg NG qd.
Atenolol 50 mg po qd.
With respect to her nutrition, the patient was continued on her tube feeds.
