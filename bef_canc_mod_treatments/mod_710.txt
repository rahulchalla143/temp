PROCEDURES:  Left hemicolectomy, splenectomy, removal of Marlex mesh, and ventral hernia repair and end transverse colostomy.
HISTORY:  This elderly male with significant comorbidities of severe coronary artery disease, having had an acute episode with stenting in [**2108-1-9**], now on Plavix, and additionally having a chronic course of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], which is requiring large steroid doses, presented to the emergency department in transfer from [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital, having had a history of approximately 2 weeks of lower abdominal pain, which got dramatically worse during the night, awakened him from sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Under adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, following a 4 liter bolus with central line getting therapy getting a CVP up to 4, the patient was brought urgently to the operating theatre, where he was placed under general anesthesia.
Having accomplished the colectomy to the transverse colon, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3224**] was utilized again to transect.
The pancreas could not be identified because of the diffuse edema and pus that was coming out from behind it, so a right-angle clamp was placed on the actual arterial bleeding site and a 2-0 silk suture ligature was placed, and this controlled the bleeding.
At this point in time the left upper quadrant was again packed, after diffuse irrigation along the left side of the abdomen with warm saline was completed.
Consideration for a feeding tube was entertained, however it was elected to get him off the table and get him back to the ICU for further resuscitation.
An NG tube was placed and in good position.
He had 3 units of blood, 500 cc of Hespan, 2 units of albumin that is 500 cc at 5% albumin, and his urine output at the end of the case was 1000 cc.
The patient had sterile dressings applied, and was returned immediately to the ICU for continued resuscitation on the ventilator, and to slowly wean him off the ventilator, because of the myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] issue.
PROCEDURE:  Exploratory laparotomy with repair of fascial dehiscence, insertion of a Surgisis Gold mesh.
HISTORY:  This 64-year-old male, with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], having presented with sepsis, a free abdominal perforation of a large retroperitoneal diverticular abscess, had a left hemicolectomy along with splenectomy to adequately drain the retroperitoneum approximately 10-14 days ago.
This was placed in an anterior fascial position as opposed to a preperitoneal position because of the lack of omentum and the appearance of the bowel.
Upon completion of the placement which was secured with transfixing abdominal wall sutures with 0 PDS, as well as running circumferentially around the graft with 0 Prolene running suture, the skin was reclosed with staples.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain was placed because the subcutaneous space was potentially infected, and the skin was closed with staples and Steri-Strips and a sterile dressing was applied.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, had 100 cc of urine output, and had 1000 cc of crystalloid during the course of the case.
He was taken to the operating room where he underwent a left hemicolectomy, splenectomy, removal of Marlex mesh, ventral hernia repair, and end transverse colostomy.
He was taken to the ICU postoperatively for further resuscitation.
Neurology was consulted for postoperative management of his myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
Stress dose steroids were given.
At POD 3 the patient was weaned from the ventilator but required ventilatory support and reintubation.
Plasmapheresis catheters were placed and plasmapheresis was administered per neurology.
Tube feedings were started.
At POD 4 purulent drainage was cultured from the abdominal drain.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis showed  two small fluid pockets two small for drainage without evidence of leak or obstruction.
At POD 17 he remained extubated and was transferred to the floor.
Repeat video swallow was completed with approval for thickened liquids.
He was taken to the operating room where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy with repair of fascial dehiscence with mesh.
He tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the ICU intubated.
At POD 20/2 he was febrile and with decreased urine output which responded to fluid bolus.
Central line was removed and PICC was placed.
Abdominal drain was discontinued.
He remained with PICC line for one week of abx coverage per ID recommendations.
Pyridostigmine Bromide dose was continued at 30mg q3H and we decided not to increase to his usual home dose per inpatient neurology recommendations.
He remained on Amiodarone.
