Was transiently responsive to fluid boluses but because of refractory hypotension and concern for urosepsis, transferred to the MICU for observation; flagyl was empirically started because of concern for C.Dif.
As discussed above, vanc was discontinued; flagyl was also stopped once clinically stable.
Given patient's history of antibiotic use, C.dif was considered when hypotensive; started on empiric flagyl therapy in the acute setting of labile pressures as discussed above.
The patient did not produce any stools for culture/guaiac after transfer from MICU even with bowel regimen.
C.Dif was never confirmed; Flagyl was discontinued.
# Recurrent UTI s/p suprapubic catheter: Underwent placement of a suprapubic catheter [**2172-11-20**] with urology for recurrent UTIs and bladder spasm.
# Post-procedure hypoxia and CAD: Became hypoxic after placement of the suprapubic catheter, thought to be due to volume overload from IVF administered during the procedure.
The day of discharge a nuclear stress test was performed that showed a partially reversible inferior wall defect with associated hypokinesis and reversible low inferolateral ischemia associated with hypokinesis; EF was 43% from 63% in [**2164**] and EDV was elevated at 104cc.
Results were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who deferred invasive intervention this admission; the patient was sent home on medical management, including statin, ASA, atenolol, ACEi.
tinea cruris: The patient was given topical Miconazole Powder 2% as needed.
Although he was asymptomatic, he was given Bacitracin/Polymyxin B Sulfate Ophthalmic Ointment for a 7 day course to cover for bacterial conjunctivitis.
Hypertension: The patient was restarted on his lisinopril following transfer from the MICU back to the medicine floor and discharged on his previously prescribed regimen.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Newbridge on the [**Doctor Last Name **] - [**Location (un) 1411**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Antibiotic resistant urinary tract infection associated with urinary catheter Bladder spasm  Secondary Diagnoses: Diabetes Mellitus type 2 Coronary Artery Disease High blood pressure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were hospitalized because of a recurrent urinary tract infection, which you were susceptible to developing because you had an indwelling foley catheter in your penis.
Your infection was treated with IV antibiotics and your condition improved.
This pain improved with IV antibiotics but did not resolve completely because of your chronic bladder spasm.
You underwent a procedure this hospitalization to place a urinary catheter into your bladder through your lower abdomen.
This catheter should improve your abdominal pain and also make you less susceptible to infection.
You were briefly transferred to the ICU for close observation and fluids until your blood pressure returned to [**Location 213**].
