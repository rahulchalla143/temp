She was started on a Natrecor drip due to her worsening renal function with Lasix.

She was started on dofetilide per the Electrophysiology Service in an attempt to convert her to sinus rhythm to improve her congestive heart failure.
Per the Electrophysiology Service, there were no other antiarrhythmic options and the patient will need to follow up for a flutter ablation and if the flutter ablation is unsuccessful, likely AV node ablation with pacemaker placement.
