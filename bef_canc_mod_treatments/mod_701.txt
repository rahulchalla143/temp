She completed an 8 day course of vanc/zosyn/cipro but remained febrile throughout until day of d/c on [**9-12**], and by report remained afebrile thereafter, leading to a working diagnosis of drug fever in the context of a resolving PNA.
She contiuned to require mechanical ventilation until [**2152-9-13**], when she was successfully extubated.
CXR from [**9-14**] s/p extubation showed marked improvement in pulmonary volume overload and pleural effusions.
Was easily weaned down to 2L NC with sats in the high 90's.
Despite resolution of her hypoxia, her renal function did not improve and she required HD on [**9-15**].
&#9658; CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.

Pt continued to spike fevers on prolonged treatment for suspected PNA with Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date 7.26), d/c these abx [**9-13**] out of suspicion that fevers may be drug fevers.
Bronchoscopy was done [**9-12**] was concern of ongoing infection, however, unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.
&#9658; RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine 1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now downtrending to 3.1.
However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted to continue.
CVVHD was started, but pt required pressors for much of the treatments.

Pt tolerated HD well, and renal believes that she will need at least 1 mo of HD before they will know whether pt needs HD indefinately or whether renal function will recover.
Had good response to increased Hydralazine for preload and afterload reduction, however holding to avoid hypotension with HD at this time.
Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].
HBG now 9.1, stable, consider transfusion if clinical situation worsen or hgb below 7.0 - on [**Hospital1 **] PPI - no need for repeat EGD now that pt is s/p TIPS  &#9658; DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II difficult to control, at home on large lantus doses, approximately 60 Lantus [**Hospital1 **] BG more controlled, stoped TF with extubation yesterday, Insulin gtt turned down from [**1-22**] to 5mg/hr.
Restarted Glargine + HISS on [**9-14**]   &#9658; Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
Pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP.
Pt's line was taken out [**9-21**] since pt now has permanent HD line, but did not believe that the line was infected.
- at this point ASA has been contraindictaed given GIB on ASA - she will defer statin and ACEI at this time as per discussion with her during last admission, she wished to discuss with her cardiologist.
