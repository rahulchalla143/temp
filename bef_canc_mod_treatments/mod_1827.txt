He was started on a Heparin drip and later started on Coumadin and Lovenox as a bridge until his INR becomes therapeutic.
He again experienced a similar episode on HD #7, EKG without change compared to previous one; chest radiograph performed and pending at time of this dictation.

He will remain on lovenox until his INR is at a therapeutic range of [**1-7**] at which point the lovenox will be stopped and he will be continued on coumadin only for anticoagulation.
