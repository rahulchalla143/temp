Admission Date:  [**2146-9-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-10-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-3-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ampicillin / Ceftriaxone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1646**] Chief Complaint: Transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital with fevers and lower back pain.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Transesophageal echocardiogram [**2146-9-21**] Femoral line placement [**2146-9-27**] Hemodialysis [**2146-9-28**] Transfusion of 2 units of red blood cells [**2146-9-29**] Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram [**2146-9-30**] Laminectomy of L5-S1 for removal of epidural abscess [**2146-9-30**] Removal of surgical drain [**2146-10-6**]   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 76-year-old male with no significant past medical history who was transferred from an OSH for 6 weeks of fevers and acute onset lower back pain.
He was given ceftriaxone and metronidazole and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
A post-void residual was measured at 80cc.
The patient was given 1g IV vancomycin and morphine for pain control.
In the MICU, he was started on a nitro gtt, placed on NIPPV, and effectively diuresed.
The patient was placed on heparin for 24 hours and metoprolol for blood pressure control.
ACEi, hydralazine, and isosorbide mononitrate was also recommended for blood pressure control, but ACEi was held as pt was in acute renal failure.
In [**Month (only) 956**], pt had transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or prostate Bx, which could have led to endocarditis.
Bacterial sensitivities were completed and pt was started on a course of Ceftriaxone and Ampicillin.
IR and Neurosurgery were consulted, surgery is being held for now as pt pain has been improving.
Back pain is currently an issue, for which he's on Dilaudid PCA, Neurontin, and Valium.
However, he has not been using his dilaudid PCA.
Pt had been encouraged by family and staff to use Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
Somnolence likely secondary to gabapentin and dilaudid dose.

FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler images were acquired of the left common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, tibial and peroneal veins.
There is also some evidence of intervening L5-S1 discitis, as well as anterior subligamentous phlegmon, as before.
A few, tiny foci of restricted diffusion in the cerebral hemispheres, on both sides, in the ACA, MCA, and PCA distributions as described above, likely embolic infarcts.
Assessment for enhancing lesions is limited due to lack of IV contrast.
Given the patient's history, it is possible the infarcts relate to underlying infection, and a repeat examination with gadolinium could be considered as indicated clinically to look for evidence of meningitis.
Nevertheless, acceptable background rhythms were reached at times.
IMPRESSION: Probable aortic valve endocarditis with mild aortic regurgitation.
The patient was taken to the operating room for evacuation of this abscess.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  L5 laminectomy and S1 laminectomy and epidural abscess evacuation under microscopic visualization.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent and preoperative laboratory values were verified, the patient was brought into the operating room and he underwent general anesthesia and intubation without difficulty.
The planned incision was initially infiltrated with local anesthetics with dilute epinephrine.
The incision was then opened using a scalpel.
The subcutaneous dissection was done using electrocautery.
Periosteal dissection was carried out to define the L5 and S1 lamina.
The laminectomy was performed using a combination of drills, curettes and Leksell, revealing the epidural space.
This was carefully dissected off the dura using microdissection techniques and under microscope visualization.
After this was achieved the wound was amply irrigated with approximately 500 mL of bacitracin- containing irrigant.
# Enterococcal Bacteremia / Aortic Valve Endocarditis The patient's subacute history of fevers was concerning for endocartidis, and blood cultures on the day of transfer grew gram positive cocci ultimately speciated as enterocccus faecalis that was vanc/amp sensitive.
He was initially on vancomyin that was changed to ampicillin and ceftriaxone for synergy.
Infectious disease service was involved and recommended for six-week course of antibiotics with ampicillin and ceftriaxone starting from the day of surgery ([**9-30**]).
This course of antibiotics will end on [**11-11**].
A discussion regarding surgical intervention was made between neurosurgeons, patient and family, and given his recent NSTEMI/demand ischemia event surgery was felt to be an option of last resort.
He was taken to the OR on [**2146-9-30**] for laminectomy of L5-S1 with washout of the area (see OR report for further information).
He tolerated the procedure well.
Tissue and fluid samples were sent for gram stain, culture and pathology, but did not yield the identity of the causative organism (sterile after prolonged treatment with ampicillin and ceftriaxone).
# Pain Control: Post-operatively patient was treated with Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
This was weaned to oral medications as his overall status improved.
His current pain regimen consists of oxycodone 5 mg four times daily (standing dose).
Neurosurgery has confirmed that anticoagulation can be started at rehab facility with heparin drip transitioned to coumadin.
Cardiology has recommended for 2 months of anticoagulation with follow-up in cardiology clinic and repeat transesophageal echocardiogram at that time.
As the post-operative drain was pulled yesterday [**2146-10-6**], the patient has not yet started anticoagulation.
He should begin heparin gtt today titrated to PTT of 60-90, and begin coumadin 5 mg PO today titrated to goal INR of [**1-18**].
# NSTEMI / Demand Ischemic Event The patient was transferred to the medical ICU in the setting of hypertensive emergency with SBPs > 200, pulmonary edema requiring bipap, and a rise in CK/CK-MB/troponin with question of lateral ECG changes/ST depressions.
He was managed with heparin for 24 hours and aspirin.
He was on a nitroglycerin infusion and weaned to oral metoprolol.
Statin was stopped due to slight transaminitis.
Aspirin has not been restarted yet as he is only one week post-op.
Nevertheless, he was treated with 10-days of intravenous vancomycin.
The vancomycin was stopped on [**10-6**].
# Acute-on-Chronic Kidney Disease The patient had a creatine of 2.0-2.5 during recent admission, with baseline estimated at 1.5-low 2s with h/o BPH, h/o TURP and obstructive symptoms.
A temporary right femoral line was placed for hemodialysis following the MRI with gadolinium to prevent nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.
He underwent two cycles of hemodialysis following the MRI.
During this admission he received 2 units of packed red blood cells prior to surgery.
We held his colchicine during this admission.
# BPH The patient has had a foley catheter in place for most of this admission.
His home medications were held, but may consider restarting in the appropriate clinical context.
This phenomenon is felt to be related to dual-beta lactam therapy, which is needed to treat the patient's endocarditis/abscess - therefore, the current plan is to continue to monitor LFTs and as long as no significant change, to continue with the treatment course.
The alternative would be to exchange ceftriaxone for gentamicin, but this may place the patient in danger of permanent renal failure and cause need for hemodialysis.
Vancomycin (started for MRSA-positive sputum) was stopped as patient had no evidence of PNA and antibiotics may have been contributing.
At the present time, it is expected that low-grade fevers may persist, but this should not prompt change in medication regimen.
