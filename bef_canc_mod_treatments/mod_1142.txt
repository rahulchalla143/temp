Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] later on [**1-19**], where had continued right arm twitching, head deviation to right, eye twitching, which improved with propofol infusion and resolved with IV phenobarbital load.

1) Status Epilepticus/Seizures: On [**1-19**] AM, was found to be unresponsive with posturing; given Ativan 4mg and taken to [**Location (un) 12914**], where he continued to have recurrent generalized seizures despite Ativan 10mg, Dilantin 1g, and Keppra 2g.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Neuro ICU later on [**1-19**], where he had continued right arm twitching, head deviation to right, eye twitching, which improved with propofol infusion and resolved with IV phenobarbital load.
He was maintained on Dilantin, Keppra and Phenobarb.
The doses of these medications were adjusted during hospital course.
His continued unresponsive to commnads during hospitalization was thought to possibly be related to his [**Last Name (LF) 85127**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the plan is to slowly taper this, while continuing his current doses of Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Dilantin 200 mg q8h.
His Phenobarb dose is currently at 60 mg [**Hospital1 **], with the plan to taper this to 45 mg [**Hospital1 **] next week and then to call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] the following week regarding further medication adjustments.
2) Respiratory: Initially intubated for airway protection in setting of status epilepticus.
Unable to be weaned off [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] tracheostomy was eventually performed and he is currently maintaining good O2 sats while on 40% trach mask.
He was started on Vancomycin for this and his central line was pulled as a possible source of infection.
For the bacteremia, he was started on a 14 day course of Vancomycin and for the pneumonia he was started on a 14 day course of Ceftazadime.
Repeat blood cx have been negative and a repeat sputum cx only showed sparse growth of Pseudomonas and Coag + Staph; this is likely colonization and as per ID, there is no need to continue antibiotics longer for this as long as there is no further fevers or respiratory distress.
For his DVT/PE, he was started on therapeutic Lovenox.
The decision was made to not start Coumadin given its interaction with Dilantin; he will thus need to remain on therapeutic Lovenox for [**3-24**] months for his DVT/PE.
His Metoprolol was increased during hospitalization to 25 mg tid to help control his heart rate.
