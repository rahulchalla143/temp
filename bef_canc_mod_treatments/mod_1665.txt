In the emergency room the patient was noted to be pain free after sublingual nitroglycerin as well as intravenous nitroglycerin and intravenous heparin.
The patient has agreed to undergo coronary artery catheterization on this admission.
MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Atenolol 25 mg once daily; Isordil 20 mg t.i.d.
; Plavix 75 mg once daily; Zestril 10 mg once daily; NPH insulin 30 units q.a.m.
; Protonix 40 mg once daily; aspirin 325 once daily; and Lipitor dose undisclosed.
When the patient was pain free after sublingual nitroglycerin and intravenous nitroglycerin as well as heparin, the electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 92 with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in V4 and 5 and T wave inversions in V3 through 5.
In summary, the catheterization showed 40% left main, 90% left anterior descending coronary artery, 95% circumflex coronary artery, and 90% right coronary artery.
The patient continued to experience pain during the catheterization procedure and for that reason, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed without complication.
Following the catheterization, CT Surgery was consulted.
The patient was seen by CT Surgery and accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting.
On [**2130-8-20**] the patient was brought to the operating room at which time she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 5 including a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, a vein graft to D2, a vein graft to obtuse marginal #1 and obtuse marginal #3 sequentially, and a vein graft to the posterior descending coronary artery.
She tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
At the time of transfer the patient had an intra-aortic balloon pump at 1:1 propofol, milrinone at 5 mcg per kg per minute, Neo-Synephrine and nitroglycerin infusing.
She was weaned from the ventilator and extubated, however her balloon pump was left in place, and she was left on her milrinone throughout the course of her first operative day.
She did, however, continue to require small doses of milrinone to maintain adequate cardiovascular function.
Her milrinone was weaned to off and discontinued.
She did however, on that day, experience an episode of atrial fibrillation, which was treated with intravenous Lopressor and amiodarone, after which an initial loading dose the patient converted to normal sinus rhythm.
Also on postoperative day two the patient's chest tubes and Foley catheter were discontinued, and she was transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
She remained hemodynamically stable, and on postoperative day five it was deemed that she was stable and ready for transfer to a rehabilitation setting for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended; positive bowel sounds with well-healed scars from a prior cholecystectomy and hysterectomy.
Furosemide 40 mg b.i.d.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq b.i.d.
