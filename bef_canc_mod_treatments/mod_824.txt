CXR: [**2160-10-13**] FINDINGS: A temporary pacemaker lead has been placed via a left internal jugular approach and there is a defibrillator pad overlying the lower right hemithorax.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 64 y.o male w/ h/o HCV cirrhosis s/p liver transplant, and several other comorbidities presents s/p complete heart block.
Pt had temp pacer wire placed at OSH.
His temp line was eventually removed here as there were no further signs of AV block.
Placement of permanent pacer delayed due infectious issues.
Pt spiked temps, had (+) bld and line cx's--bld cx grew enterococcus and PICC line grew coag negative staph.
Given these issues, plan made for pt to have permanent pacer placed after completion of 4wk course of antibiotics, followed by 2wks of monitoring for fever and blood cultures.
If pt is fever free and has no further positive cultures during this period, he will go for pacemaker placement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of [**Hospital1 18**].
Pt's right PICC line (from [**10-15**]) grew coag negative staph resistant to oxacillin.
Pt did have pseudomonas in the sputum, which was treated for a period with cefepime.
It may be possible to change to ampicillin for treatment of enterococcal infection (since amp sensitive); however, this was not done as pt's right arm still emdematous & slightly erythematous from thrombophlebitis (from initial PICC line, which grew coag negative staph, resistant to oxacillin).
Pt continued on prednisone and prophylactic bactrim.
Pt treated with Epogen & iron.
# Baslic vein thrombophbletis: partial, non-occlusive thrombosis of Right basilic vein on U/S.
# DM2: Pt's glucose was managed with humalog sliding scale & daily glargine.
Albuterol & atrovent given PRN .
Treated pain control with morphine sulfate immediate release PO.
# Anxiety/Bipolar Depression: Pt treated w/ Ativan PRN for anxiety & zyprexa for bipolar.
