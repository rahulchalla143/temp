Coronary artery disease   Brief Hospital Course: 42F w/ ESRD on PD and CHF referred from hemodialysis for asymptomatic H/H drop.
Haptoglobin wnl, retic count decreased but this is expected in the setting of her renal disease; MCV normalized.
Patient is on protonix [**Hospital1 **].
We spoke with GI who recommended trying to do a colonoscopy and endoscopy prior to discharge.
It was agreed that the procedure could wait till after the HD catheter issue was resolved (see below).
#ESRD/HD Catheter Line Infection: Basline Cr 2.7-4.9 over past few months.
Pt c/o severe chronic generalized itching [**3-7**] ESRD w/ associated scratching and excoriations for which she takes benadryl at home.
Renal was consulted and patient was continued on scheduled dialysis.
Patient continued to get fluconazole with HD sessions.
After speaking with renal/ID, all agreed that the left HD tunneled catheter line should be removed due to the fungal infection.
After 24 hours with the infected catheter line removed, both ID and renal approved the placement of a new permanent right tunneled HD catheter.
ID recommended continuing Fluconazole 200mg PO Daily x7-10days after removal of the infected line as the final treatment of the fungal line infection.
The temporary catheter was removed and another permanent HD line was paced in the LIJ.
This was a concern given need of volume resuscitation in setting of anemia/GI bleed while in the ICU.
Pt was discharged on levofloxacin (course ending [**10-26**]).
Patient will be continued on levofloxacin (course ends [**10-28**]).
Effusion could also have been due to CHF.
She was continued on a 2 week course of vancomycin with last dose to be given on thursday [**10-24**].

#Chronic Phantom Pain: S/p bilateral below the knee leg amputations.

You were given blood in the ICU, and you were stabilized.
Instead, we put in a temporary HD catheter in the groin.
You were treated for the line infection with anti-fungal medications because we found fungus growing at the site.
When the infection cleared, we placed another permanent HD catheter in your left neck, which will be used for dialysis in the future.
You had a fever after the temporary HD line was placed in your groin.
You had no further fevers, and you do not need to take antibiotics when you leave the hospital.
While here, you were seen by gastroenterology who initally recommended a colonoscopy and EGD.
However, because we were unable to get a peripheral IV in your vein, we were unable to do the colonoscopy and EGD.
He will help connect you with a gastroenterologist to evaluate whether colonoscopy and EGD are still necessary.
