Admission Date:  [**2107-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-2-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2036-6-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardial drain placement and removal PEG placement PICC placement Intubation/extubation, mechanical ventilation Thoracentesis X2 (bilaterally)   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 70 yo man with ho DM2, HTN, and recent diagnoses of AFib who was transferred from OSH on [**2107-1-10**] for evaluation of pericardial effusion.
Around [**2106-12-17**], pt had CHF-like symptoms, and he was started on diuretics.
Four days prior to admission patient had  new onset Atrial flutter and was started on Coumadin.
He was intubated in the ED and transferred to the CCU, where he was started on a Dilt gtt and was eventually extubated on [**1-6**].
On the floor he has had more agitation and has been given haldol 1mg and zyprexa 5mg.
Then pt became more somulent and a ABG showed 7.19/92/56 on a shovel mask with 2 liters.

Pericardiocentesis was performed with needle entry from the subxiphoid position.
Subsequent to removal of 920 cc of blood fluid (all sent for studies) and confirmation by echocardiography of complete fluid removal, the pericardial pressure decreased to -2 to 1 mmHg and RA pressure decreased to 15 mmHg.
Pericardial drain in place.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo man with h/o HTN and recently diagnosed AFlutter who presented from OSH with pericardial effusion, AMS, and ARF.
He was intubated for 10 days after presentation to OSH.
He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] on Imipenem and Levofloxacin for management of the effusion.
After failing multiple speech and swallow evaluations, the plan was for the patient to receive a PEG (once his INR was within acceptable limits).
He became more agitated on the Medicine floor, and received Haldol 1mg and Zyprexa 5mg.
Upon intubation, large amounts of tube feeds were found in his throat, so that his acute respiratory failure was felt due to his chronic large bilateral pleural effusions in conjunction with an aspiration event.
The patient was continued on a heparin drip in the MICU and started on bridge to Coumadin on [**1-28**], upon transfer back to the regular floors.
At the time of discharge, the patient was taking 6mg of Coumadin with a subtherapeutic INR, compensated by Heparin gtt.
# Respiratory Distress/Pleural effusions: Patient's initial hypercarbic, respiratory acidotic episode was felt likely due to the exacerbation of his pulmonary status with the large pleural effusions by aspiration of food contents.
Haldol and Zyprexa may have also slightly contributed.
Patient was trialed on Bipap on admission to the MICU without significant improvement and was shortly intubated.
Patient was extubated on [**1-22**] after Lasix diuresis but developed hypercarbic, respiratory acidosis 10 hours later.
Etiology unclear - ?flash pulmonary edema as patient was hypertensive to SBP190s during this vs. tiring off the ventilator vs. continued significant pleural effusions.
Etiology for patient's large pleural effusions remains unclear but the patient may benefit from anti-histone serology or cardiac MRI for further work-up if his effusions recur.
Pericardial drain was placed, and bloody effusion was noted.
Repeat TTE demonstrated no reaccumulation of the effusion, so drain was pulled on [**1-13**].
Repeat ECHO on [**1-28**], after removal of large pleural effusions (and pericardial effusion), showed global biventricular systolic function was less vigorous (now low normal), consistent with a diffuse process.
He was transferred on Imipenem and Levofloxacin.
Upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**], he was treated with Zosyn for 8 day course from [**1-10**], last day [**1-20**] (given aspiration found when intubated).
A PEG was ultimately placed with good effect while patient was intubated.
Digoxin & Cardizem were held and Metoprolol was continued.
He was anticoagulated with Coumadin after pericardial drain was pulled.
These episodes resolved, but he also had intermittent episodes of AF with RVR that responded to IV Metoprolol.
Patient may benefit from discussions with EP as an outpatient regarding need for ablation for his AFib or pacer placement if he has recurrent episodes of bradycardia.
His hematuria improved after anticoagulation was held, but resumed with restarting Coumadin.
The patient will need follow up with Urology as an outpatient and his home Flomax should be restarted prior to discontinuation of his Foley which was in place at the time of discharge.
Fe studies showed 19% saturation, Fe 43, and Ferritin 1190, consistent with ongoing inflammation and possible mild Fe deficiency.
Ferrous Sulfate 325mg PO daily was continued.
He did not require any pRBC transfusions while in the MICU or on the medicine floor and was discharged with a Hct of 24.8. .
# Hypertension: Patient's home regimen is Lopressor 25mg twice daily and Nifedipine 30mg daily.
While in the hospital, patient was kept on Amlodipine 10mg daily and his Lopressor was titrated to 50mg TID.
PEG placed on [**1-18**] without any complications, but he continued to fail speech and swallow evaluations until the day of discharge and was recommended to remain NPO.

A drain was placed, which provided sufficient drainage of the fluid.
The drain was pulled out 3 days later after an echocardiogram confirmed no more accumulation of fluid.
Furthermore, you were treated with antibiotics for your pneumonia.
You will need to be on blood thinners for further stroke prevention.
You were also seen by the Speech and Swallow service, who noted that you have a high risk of aspirations, so a gastric tube was placed by the Gastroenterology service.
You will get tube feeds through this gastric tube.
Your medications have been changed and are as follows: Acetaminophen 325-650 mg PO/NG Q6H:PRN pain/ fever Lansoprazole Oral Disintegrating Tab 30 mg PO/NG DAILY Metolazone 5 mg PO DAILY Amlodipine 10 mg PO/NG DAILY Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg PO/NG TID Artificial Tears 1-2 DROP BOTH EYES PRN dry eyes Docusate Sodium (Liquid) 100 mg NG [**Hospital1 **] Ferrous Sulfate 300 mg PO/NG DAILY Senna 1 TAB NG [**Hospital1 **]:PRN constipation Warfarin 4 mg PO/NG QHS   Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with a neurologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 162**], MD on [**2107-2-14**] at 2:00PM.
