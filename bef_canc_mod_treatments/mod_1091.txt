He underwent a ORIF of C6-7 with posterior fusion, laminectomy, and iliac crest bone graft with wire placement in [**1-21**].
His course was complicated by a CSF leak which was repaired, but then followed by development of MRSA meningitis, cerebritis, sinusitis, and mastoiditis, PE/DVT, NSTEMI, acute interstitial nephritis and hypersensitivity desquamative dermatitis believed secondary to vancomycin or rifampin, respiratory failure from pneumonia, ICU neuropathy/myopathy, candidemia, and mental status changes.
He had an ABG of 7.14/74/83 on unknown O2 settings and was found to be satting 91% on NRB mask and have systolic pressures from 40-60, so he was intubated and transported to [**Hospital1 18**].
His pressures stauyed in the 40-60's and he was started on levophed and fluids.
He was given 4L more fluid and a right IJ sepsis line was placed with CVP from [**5-23**].

New right IJ catheter without pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Septic shock with respiratory failure from pseudomonas line infection - Pt was hypoxic and hypotensive on presentation and intubated in the field.
The potential sources were recurrence of meningitis/cervical fluid abscess, UTI, C dif given antibiotic use, PICC line infection, persistent candidemia, sacral decub inflammaion.
He received 1 dose vancomycin in the ED and levo/flagyl, but on admission to the MICU was changed to linezolid and cefepime to add pseudomonas coverage.
He was continued on voriconazole for history of [**Female First Name (un) **] blood infection.
His PICC line was pulled.
After 2 days, he was weaned from levophedrine then extubated with improvement in SVO2 to the 80's.
ID was consulted and recommended continuing linezolid and cefepime, and obtaining MRI of the neck area which showed no drainable fluid collection.
He will be continued on cefepime for 14 days total, and doxacycline indefinitely for MRSA prophylaxis.
Plastic surgery felt not need for surgical interventions.
He was continued on aspirin, and beta blocker and captopril were restarted when blood pressure tolerated.
He received a dose of vancomycin in ED and developed eosinophila, but no evidence of rash or kidney failure.
His creatinine improved with hydration to baseline.
6) history of PE/DVT, on anticoagulation - He was reversed on admission with 1 mg IV vitamin K in anticipation of possible LP, but then started on heparin when INR was < 2.
He was restarted on coumadin 5 mg po qd on the evening of [**2182-5-6**].
