Admission Date:  [**2132-3-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-3-28**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Plavix  Attending:[**Location (un) 1279**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation Diuresis   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] y/o F w/3VD CAD, CHF, severe MR, and mild AS who opresented with shortness of breath.
The night prior to admission, she became short of breath at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, and was given Lasix 60 mg po,  NTG paste, and morphine, and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER.
She was urgently intubated and given lasix, and admitted to the CCU.
CAD: 3VD, cath [**2128**] with 99% LAD, 90% LCx, 100% RCA stenoses.
NSTEMI [**9-11**], hospitalization complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring pressors and intubation and NSVT.
Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended, with normoactive bowel sounds.
The evening of admission, she was 1-2 liters negative, with acceptable ABG's on pressure support, and so was extubated.
She was slightly hypotensive after that (systolics in the 80s) and was placed on dopamine for a day (the hypotension was felt to be secondary to aggressive diuresis.)
She was placed back on her lisinopril and restarted on her carvedilol.
She was continued with Lasix prn for a goal 500 to 1000 cc negative per day (she usually responded to lasix 40 mg IV).
She was wheezing on exam, CXR c/w pulm edema, and was given an ipratropium neb and Lasix 40 IV.
Because of her severe mitral regurgitation, she was also begun on a nitrate, Imdur 30 mg po qd, which should be given at night because her ACE should be given in the morning.
She tolerated the addition of these medications well.
Her CXR showed a retrocardiac opacity, and she was begun on Levaquin for a 7 day course (renally dosed at 250 mg daily).
Heme:  Her platelets were very high at over 1,000 on admission, and came down to the 600s by discharge, which is around her baseline.
She received 2 units of PRBCs throughout her stay, and her hematocrit was stable at 31 by discharge.
She realizes that with her significant CHF and MR, these episodes will become more frequent, and that she will likely come to a point where she doesn't want to be intubated again, if even for a short time.

You are still on carvedilol, and we have added another medication for your blood pressure called Imdur, which you should take at night.
We have increased the dose of your Lasix and changed the dosing so that you take it twice a day instead of once a day.
If you become short of breath again, your doctor should give you Lasix 60 mg IV as this will work faster than po, and you respond very well to this medication and dose.
Please resume taking your regular diabetes medication (you were on insulin while you were here.)
