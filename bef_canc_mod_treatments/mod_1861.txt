He was initially treated with nitro drip, biPap and lasix.
He had symptomatic improvement and was weaned off nitro gtt and bipap to cool nebulizer face mask at 12 liters/min.
He continued to have an oxygen requirement and diffuse wheezes on exam, therefore CTA was performed to rule out PE as a cause of his symptoms.
There was no noted infiltrate by CXR or chest CT, therefore antibiotics were not continued (he recieved one does of ceftriaxone/azithro in the ED).
He was given albuterol/ipratropium nebs for symptomatic relief, with some effect.
Mucomyst nebs were also tried, without much improvement.
He was diuresed aggressively with lasix (40mg IV prn) with some improvement in wheezing and air entry as well.
