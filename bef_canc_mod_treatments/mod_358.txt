His verapamil was discontinued, and he was started on Quinaglute (did not start amiodarone due to lung issues).
ROS: He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, DVT, PE, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CAD, s/p CABG in [**2169**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-Ramus, SVG-RCA), s/p cath on [**2177-9-10**] found to have totally occluded SVG-Ramus and SVG-RCA.
It was at this time he was found to have a lesion in his left subclavian and had a stent placed there.
Lung cancer, s/p right upper lobectomy, chemo, & XRT 6.
VS: T 98.4  BP 107/69  HR 94  RR 18  O2sat 100% on 2 L/min NC HEENT: NCAT.
The proximal left subclavian artery stent was patent, with a 20 mnHg gradient in the subclavian distal to the LIMA origin.
Abdominal aortography using an angled pigtail catheter just below the level of the renal arteries revealed no apparent renal artery stenosis.
The right femoral artery had been noted to be heavily calcified during arterial access.
Successful prophylactic placement of an IABP via the left femoral artery for cardiogenic support during PCI.
Successful stenting of the left main coronary artery extending into the proximal left circumflex artery with a Xience (3x23mm) drug eluting stent postdilated with a 3.5mm balloon.
Successful closure of the right femoral arteritomy site with a 6F Mynx closure device.
Right Knee X-rays [**2181-10-20**] Right medial post-surgical clips projecting over the soft tissues.
He had severe LMCA and three vessel disease with patent proximal left subclavian artery stent and patent LIMA-LAD.
This procedure was delayed for several hours due to arrhythmias (see below), but on [**10-18**], a Xience DES was placed in the LMCA into the circumflex artery with right femoral arteriotomy closure using the Mynx device and IABP secured in place in the left femoral artery.
The patient was stable after the balloon pump was removed.
He was continued on maximal medical management with aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, and rosuvastatin.
Lasix and spironolactone were continued, and captopril was decreased then changed to low dose lisinopril due to hypotension.
# Rhythm - Has a pacer and ICD.
He was on an amiodarone drip for three days, but then switched back to quinidine, increased to QID instead of his prior dosing at TID.
He triggered for atrial fibrillation with VR to 160 the night prior to discharge, however, he had not received his quinidine or metoprolol that evening.
He was asymptomatic and his arrhythmia resolved after receiving these medications.
His dose of metoprolol was increased on this admission.
The patient's dyspnea at rest resolved, however, he desaturated to 84% on room air with amublation the day prior to discharge and again on the of discharge, despite receiving extra Lasix.
# Diabetes mellitus - The patient was placed on an insulin sliding scale with good blood sugar control.
He was given indomethacin for 24 hours with resolution of his knee pain.
This medication was discontinued due to its potential to interfere with the antiplatelet effects of aspirin.
He was discharged with a prescription for a prednisone burst-taper in the event that his symptoms recur.
With pre-hydration prior to catheterization and judicious diuresis, his creatinine had returned to a baseline of 1.2 on the day of discharge.

Your metoprolol dose was increased to 100 mg daily.
Your quinidine was increased from three to four times daily (~ every 6 hours).
You were also started on two new medications: clopidogrel 75 mg daily and digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
You have been given prescriptions for these changes.
This may have been a gout attack, however, the indomethacin was stopped because it may interfere with aspirin.
If your knee pain or other gout symptoms return, you should take a short course of a steroid medication called prednisone instead of indomethacin.
