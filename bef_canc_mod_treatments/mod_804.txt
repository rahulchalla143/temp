He received 1L NS and his BP improved to 116/58.
Also in the ED his son seemed to communicate with him that he (patient) was having chest pain so he was given morphine 2mg iv and oxygen with improvement in his moaning.
He received 1L NS and his BP improved to 116/58.
With his h/o VRE, MRSA, ESBL klebsiella, he was covered with linezolid, meropenum, IV flagyl and PO Vanco.
He remained afebrile and normotensive (his BP medications were held).
#C. Difficile Colitis: Arrived with diarrhea but soon became constipated so C. Diff toxin could not be sent.
Given his history, however, he was empirically treated with 4 days of IV Flagyl and 4 days of PO Vanco.
Patient was initially started on heparin gtt, ASA 325, simvastatin 80mg.
However, he was then seen by cardiology who felt the changes were due to hypotension in the setting in sepsis, the did not want to proceed to catheterization and suggested stopping heparin gtt in setting of h/o SDH along with guiac + stools.
Once normotensive, the patient was re-started on home metoprolol and lisinopril.
His medications were renally dosed.
After aggressive fluid resusciation, his creatinine decreased to 0.3 and his BUN slowly decreased throughout his stay.
Recent baseline HCT in the low 30's, with suspected hemoconcentration on arrival, repeat at baseline despite guaiac + stools.
# h/o Hypertension: In the MICU, his [**Last Name (un) **] clonidine, lisinopril, metoprolol were held.
Upon transfer to the floor, he was restarted on home metoprolol.
His systolic blood pressure remained >130 and he was started on home lisinopril the following day.
with baseline left hemiparesis, limited vocalization, continued the patient on aspirin 325mg and monitored neuro exam closely.
# Diabetes: Given high home insulin dose and unstable intake was covered with insulin gtt for optimal glucose control and switched to SSI with glargine 20ccs to begin (home dose 80ccs).
Once tube feeds were started his glargine was increased to 30.
#Sacral Decub Wound: Stage 2, followed by wound care nursing.
