We treated you with steroids and admitted you to our ICU for close airway monitoring since you have needed intubation in the past to protect your airway.
You are also being given prescriptions for stool softeners since iron can make you constipated.
Please note that you will be discharged with a prescription for a steroid taper.
It is very important that you take these, as well as all of your previous medications, as prescribed.
