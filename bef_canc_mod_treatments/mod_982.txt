Mitral Valve: A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present.
The distal LAD filled via left-to-left and right-to-left collaterals.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 68 yo male with h/o CAD s/p CABG, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, esophageal cancer, MVR and bradycardia s/p PPM/ICD who presented with somnolence, hypercarbic respiratory failure, bradycardia, hypotension and likely urosepsis.
* Respiratory failure: Patient was transferred from an OSH for possible pacemaker replacement and had significant respiratory distress at presentation.
He had been on Bipap at the OSH but had worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure upon arrival here.
He was covered broadly with vancomycin, levaquin and flagyl to cover for a PNA.
Pt was continued on ventilator but did not tolerate PSV very well.
After d/w the pt and his family he had a trach placed on [**6-16**].
He completed 8 days of levaquin to cover for a PNA and had sputum cx that had rare growth of coag + staph, but this was thought to be colonization.
A Cook catheter was passed via trach distal to obstruction allowing ventilation with improvement in O2 sats from 70%->96%, but tidal volumes remained low.
Case was discussed with wife and decision was made to discontinue ongoing aggressive resuscitation and focus on comfort.
He was pan cultured at that time and started on vancomycin, flagyl and levaquin at that time.
Pt also had a cotrosyn stimulation test and the initial cortisol level was low, so he completed a dose of stress dose steroids for 7 days.
He was weaned off pressors over several days.
B/c of his h/o of esophagectomy he required EGD to evaluate his esophagus and then esophageal dilatation prior to TEE.
His ucx from [**6-13**] showed continued growth of enterococcus so foley was changed on [**6-16**] and ucx re-checked.
*Bradycardia: Patient was initially admitted to cardiology for w/u of bradycardia and possible pacemaker replacement.
Pacemaker settings were changed by EP on [**6-8**].
He did not respond to fluid boluses and CVPs were high.
He had guiac + stools in the setting of being on heparin but had been seen by GI and a decision was made that he did not need to be scoped at this time.
His secretions continued to increase, and on [**6-19**] frank [**Month/Year (2) **] was found in the trachea at time of emergent bronchcopy described above.
He had not had a BM in multiple days, so his bowel regimen was increased.
He was being treated with lactulose, senna and colace.
He was continued on ASA and started on a statin.
*MVR: Pt has MVR in place and took coumadin at home.
He was started on a heparin gtt at admission.
Good UOP so no worry about clot at this time  *DM:  Sugars well controlled with SSI and QID FS.
* Access: - R subclavian placed [**6-8**] - A-line placed [**6-8**] .
