CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**6-2**] Reason: Please evaluate for ICH   [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    83 year old woman with s/p fall, on coumadin REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    Please evaluate for ICH CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:    None.
There is minimal motion-related distortion at the inferior aspect of the brain, subsequently improved on repeat acquisition.
TECHNIQUE: Helical CT acquisition from top of the lungs to upper abdomen with and without intravenous contrast and with multiplanar reformations.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal akinesis, anterior and inferior hypokinesis.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 83yo female with a fib, HTN, and hyperlipidemia who was admitted to the CCU on [**2179-6-2**] s/p mechanical fall at home with acute onset SOB in setting of CHF, possible pneumonia, a fib with RVR, and elevated cardiac enzymes.
She received metoprolol 5mg IV in the ED for rate control, after which her BP dropped to the 70s/40s.
She required oxygen delivery via a non-rebreather upon admission to the CCU, but was later weaned to oxygen via nasal cannula.
She was then started on furosemide for diuresis, with good response.
She underwent continued diuresis with furosemide, with close monitoring of her fluid balance and electrolytes.
Metoprolol tartrate was added on [**2179-6-3**] for rate control, as the patient's heart rate remained elevated in the 90s-100s.
She was also treated empirically with levofloxacin for CAP, as CXR and chest CT findings on admission suggested possible focal consolidation, and the patient had an elevated WBC of 20.9 on admission.
On [**2179-6-5**] she was started on Lasix 40mg PO BID.
Her oxygen was weaned down to 2 liters nasal cannula, and her symptoms were much improved.
She remained afebrile and her antibiotics were stopped due to diarrhea (C diff negative x2) but her WBC continued to fall - WBC 13.4 on discharge.
The patient was initially started on Aspirin 325mg, Plavix, and high-dose statin while the diagnosis of NSTEMI was considered.
Her aspirin dose was later decreased to 81mg, and her Plavix was stopped.
Patient was started on lisinopril 20mg daily and tolerated well with systolic blood pressures in the 90-120.
She was given metoprolol 5mg IV in the ED, which dropped her BP to 70s/40s but did not significantly decrease her HR.
Metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID was started on [**2179-6-3**] for rate control, although the patient's HR was persistently in the 90s-100s.
She was started on a digoxin load for better rate control.
Her metoprolol dose was changed to 25mg PO BID, however it was soon changed to 12.5mg TID as the patient's BP did not tolerate the higher dose.
Coumadin was initially held as the patient's INR was therapeutic on admission, but it was re-started on [**2179-6-5**] with close monitoring of the INR.
Her CK was initially elevated, but trended down quickly and rhabdomyolysis was not a concern.
Hypercholesterolemia - The patient's atorvastatin dose was increased to 80mg daily.
C. diff toxin assay was negative X twice and colace/levofloxacin was discontinued given her diarrhea.
