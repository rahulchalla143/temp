Admission Date:  [**2178-10-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-10-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-4-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Zofran  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**] Chief Complaint: transfer from OSH for acute renal failure, nephrolithiasis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation placement of left nephrostomy tube cystoscopy  History of Present Illness: 70 y/o M with a PMHx of nephrolithiasis, COPD, UC, HTN who was admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] Hosp on [**10-2**] for 3d of worsening L flank pain.
An U/S showed 11mm calculus in mid-portion of L kidney and 8mm in lower pole.
Made NPO, placed on PCA which was weaned to Percocet PO prn.
Foley placed with initial hematuria now clearing.
The patient was not believed to be a candidate for a surgical procedure given the requirement of general anesthesia and intubation.
US-guided percutaneous nephrostomy placement was attempted [**2178-10-7**] but was unsuccessful.
Per report, during the procedure the patient's blood pressure dropped to the 80s after initiation of propofol and was slow to improve despite 700cc NS bolus (not well documented).
Radiology has suggested a CT-guided procedure as the next step.
The first was for AF with RVR responding to lopressor and diltiazem with conversion to NSR.
The second and third were for anxiety, hypoxia, and SVT, again responding to lopressor and diltiazem.
Past Medical History: 1) COPD on 2L home O2 (FEV1 1.17L (35% pred) in [**2175**]), steroid-dependent 2) HTN 3) UC 4) BPH 5) Nephrolithiasis 6) Stage III CKD Cr 1.5 thought due to recurrent nephrolithiasis   Social History: Tob: 100pk yr hx; quit 8 yrs ago.
Prolonged expiration, sparse wheezes Abd: soft, nontender Back: left nephrostomy tube with clear yellow urine drainage Ext: 2+ edema bilateral LE to knee Neuro: AAOx2.

No distal ureteral/bladder calculi could be identified, however, exam is limited due to bladder decompression from decompressed Foley.
Air bubbles along the dependent cecal and ascending colon wall are most likely luminal but the possibility of a component of pneumatosis cannot be completely excluded in this patient with mechanical ventilation and sepsis.
Limited study due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Interval placement of percutaneous nephrostomy catheter, with a left renal stone and two left ureteral stones.
Ecoli subsequently grew out of urine and blood cutlures.
Nephrostomy tube was placed on [**10-10**] after failure to place on [**10-7**].
Total 14 day course of ceftriaxone will be completed [**10-23**] (counting starting date [**10-10**] when nephrostomy placed, although he received cipro/cefipime for four days prior).
He was intubated [**12-26**] respiratory failure and remained ventilated for roughly 6 days.
There was no evidence at that time of URI as he was without CXR infiltrate and sputum production.
He was maintained on IV methylprednisolone and bronchodilators.
He was discharged on spiriva, advair, albuterol nebs, and a prednisone taper (over 3 weeks).
Haldol, zyprexa, and mophine was given as above and his agitation and AMS improved by the 3rd or 4th day after extubation.
He was maintained on supportive treatment with bowel rest.
It was likely multifactorial from steroids and urosepsis.
He was maintained on oral vancomycin and IV flagyl while not taking PO given concern for possible c. diff, however he was toxing negative x3.
He was started on PO dilt which was titrated for more ideal BP and HR.
# Hydronephrosis/nephrolithiasis: Left proximal ureter obstructing stone with moderate hydronephrosis and proximal ureter dilation noted on CT as above.
Left nephrostomy tube placed by IR on [**10-10**].
He was begun on heparin briefly for anticoagulation, but he developed a urological bleed, so the heparin was stopped.
# Hematuria: likely [**12-26**] heparin and large bladder stone/tumor.
His heparin was d/c'd and he received continuous bladder irrigation, which began to clear on [**2178-10-18**].
Foley was discontinued without difficulty on [**2178-10-19**].
# Acute on CRF: Improved to 1.1 then jump to 1.4 o/n in setting of lasix and ketorolac.
Plan for three days of gentle diuresis for goal of 1 liter negative over those days.
- sulfasalazine d/c'd as there is tentative evidence that it may exacerbate lung disease and already on steroids for COPD - can consider restarting sulfasalazine when respiratorily stable .
