Admission Date:  [**2195-8-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-9-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2142-7-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**] Chief Complaint: acute left lower extremity ischemia and hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2195-8-29**] Mesenteric arteriogram, SMA stent, thrombectomy of left limb or aortobifemoral graft, endarterectomy of left CFA/SFA/PFA, left lower leg fasciotomy   History of Present Illness: 52 year-old gentleman with a complicated h/o peripheral vascular disease s/p aorto-bifemoral bypass in [**2191**], pancreatic mass s/p Whipple in [**2192**], and esophageal cancer s/p esophagectomy with colonic interpostion 4 months ago complicated by necrosis of the neoesophagus and development of an enterocutaneous fistula who presents with altered mental status.
Pt was started on abx prior to being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Past Medical History: Aorto-bifemoral bypass [**8-19**] MI HTN R CEA ([**7-19**]) Knee athroscopy Whipple operation ([**Doctor Last Name 468**]) in [**2192**] for benign pancreatic mass Esophagectomy with colonic interposition complicated by neoesophagus necrosis requiring resection and spit fistula creation ([**2195-4-22**])  Social History: Pt lives with family.
Family History: Father with liver cirrhosis from ETOH use   Physical Exam: Afebrile/VSS No distress, alert and oriented x 3 PERLA, EOMI, anicteric Neck with spit fistula draining to ostomy appliance RRR, no murmurs, lungs clear Abdomen soft, nontender, midline wound healing by secondary intention with good granulation tissue in place; known ECF in right aspect of wound drainge brown fluid Left groin incision C/D/I, left lower leg fasciotomy incisions C/D/I .
A CT revealed a SMA stenosis with concerns for acute mesenteric ischemia given the patients hypotension requiring a vasopressor.
It also revealed that the left limb of his previous aorto-bifemoral graft was thrombosed causing his left leg to be ischemic.
On [**2195-8-29**] he was taken emergently to the operating room where an arteriogram and SMA stent were performed.
Simultaneously, his left groin was explored and a thrombectomy performed of the left limb of his aortobifemoral graft.
An endarterectomy was performed of his left CFA, SFA, and PFA.
He was taken to the CVICU and continued on broad spectrum antibiotics post-operatively.
Initially, in the post-operative period, his left PT signal was weak, but this was due to global hypoperfusion and vasopressors.
Once his pressors were weaned down, his PT signal became very strong.
His fasciotomy incisions are healing nicely.
Neuro: Post-operatively he required propofol and then fentanyl and versed to maintain adequate sedation and pain control while intubated.
Cardiovascular: He required vasopressor support post-operatively and aggressive resuscitation.
Pulmonary: He remained intubated until POD4.
He underwent a bronchoscopy where copious secretions were encountered and suctioned.
He was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics with double coverage for Pseudomonas due to his recent hospitalization being complicated by resistant Pseudomonal pneumonia.
His BAL specimen never grew any organisms and his antibiotics were discontinued by one antibiotic daily.
Gastrointestinal: He was able to be started on trophic tube feeds while in the CVICU.
General and Thoracic surgery were consulted and a wound vac was placed in attempts to isolate the fistula.
Thoracic surgery is managing his fistula and recommended discontinuing the wound vac and starting moist to dry dressing changes to his abdominal wound.
His foley catheter was able to be removed once he was out of the ICU and he voids without difficulty.
Heme: He was maintained on a heparin gtt to maintain patency of his circulation.
Infectious Disease: Due to his septic physiology on admission he was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics empirically.
On POD zero there were concerns for pneumonia based on CXR and bronchoscopy so double coverage was started for his history of Pseudomonas pneumonia.
All of his culture date returned negative so his antibiotics were discontinued one at a time.
He is currently on no antibiotics and his WBC is normal.
He will need physical therapy and nursing care for his spit fistula, enterocutaneous fistula, and healing midline abdominal wound.
