His daughter had called his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**8-13**] for weight gain but the decision was made not to increase the Lasix at that time.
During that admission, the patient was diuresed with Lasix in the MICU for his acute CHF exacerbation.
His Spironolactone 25 mg daily was also discontinued during that admission for unclear reasons.
He was treated for the pneumonia with Levofloxacin x7 days and a prednisone burst, and PO2 was 95% on 3L at time of discharge with ambulatory sats of 85% RA, unknown ambulatory PO2 on 3L NC.
He has been on supplemental O2 at 2L NC since discharge from his recent hospitalization.
MS improved after BIPAP and breathing better, now at FIO2 at 30% on BIPAP.
labs - K 5.4 - no peaked T's on EKG, given kayexalate 15gm, BNP: 4239 same as last CHF exacerbation, trop was at baseline, CXR was done and showed heart mod enlarged, worsened pulm edema, small b/l pleural effusions.
Bipap started ~10:45, no IV lasix or nitro drip due to critical AS and didn't want to reduce preload, tried to bump down to nc at 12:45, sats dropped to low-mid 80's  On arrival to the MICU, patient was on BIPAP, awake alert following commands and a little irritated wanting to leave the hospital emergently.

This was felt to be caused by inadequate diuresis prior to admission as his outpatient lasix dosing had been decreased prior to admission.
He was put on a lasix drip in the MICU and given Bipap and his oxygenation improved substantially.
He required initially PRN zyprexa but eventually was changed to PRN haldol PO and IM, as his agitation was quite pronounced.
COPD: He was continued on his home medications and was not felt to have an acute COPD exacerbation on this admission.
Due to his preload dependance and blood pressures near 110, his diuresis was gentle on the floor to prevent hypotension and needing to fluid bolus.
Hematuria: He self-discontinued his foley catheter on HD1 and subsequently had hematuria which gradually resolved.
Hypothyroidism: Continued on home levothyroxine which was increased to 50mcg for a TSH of 19 and decreased T4 on admission.
Maintained on his home regimen of amiodarone 200mg and coumadin.
On the day of discharge, his INR was supratherapeutic at 3.4, so his coumadin was held.
He should have his INR rechecked in [**1-4**] days to ensure that he is not still supratherapeutic and to resume his coumadin dosing.
Coronary artery disease:  Continued on ASA and atorvastatin.
BPH: Continued Finasteride 5 mg daily  #.
Hypercholesterolemia:  Continued home atorvastatin 10 mg daily  #.
Atopic dermatitis:  Continued triamcinolone cream as above.
