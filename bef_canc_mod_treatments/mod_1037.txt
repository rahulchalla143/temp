He was treated with levofloxacin from [**11-2**] to [**2188-11-8**] for a 7 day course.
Pigtail drains were placed in the retroperitoneal abscess and VATS was performed to debride the empyema.
Warfarin was held to prevent bleeding.
He was anticoagulated once again with Lovenox as a bridge to warfarin.
He complained of SOB, PND, and DOE.
Given the possible PNA, he was treated with azithromycin 500mg plus ceftriaxone 1g IV for CAP and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation by Thoracic Surgery here.
He was placed on BiPAP but his mental status worsened and he became unresponsive.
He was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
No cultures were taken but the patient was treated empirically for HAP with vancomycin 1g IV x 1 on top of the ceftriaxone plus azithromycin received at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.

Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80 year-old man with s/p recent VATS and drainagae of an empyema and retroperitoneal abscess infected with Pantoea spp (an Enterobacter-like bacteria) and PE on warfarin as well as CAD s/p CABG, CHF, and Afib, admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Although the patient's respiratory failure was initially though to be infectious in origin, and he was treated with Vancomycin  Flagyl and Levofloxacin for aspiration pneumonia (given his history of aspiration--see speech and swallow notes--as well as his recent history of hospitalization, rehab and empyema + retroperitoneal abscess growing Pantoea spp), antibiotics were discontinued after 2 days when the patient failed to spike a fever, become hypoxic or develop any significant leukocytosis or infiltrate on chest xray.
He was intubated and mechanically ventilated for one day, and was extubated without difficulty.
Based on the patient's ABGs, he seems to be somewhat of a chronic retainer (possibly due to pulmonary physiology s/p effusions and empyema and abscess and surgeries) and his pCO2 settled out at approximately 54.
After transfer to the floor he never required supplemental oxygen, worked easily with physical therapy and had a rather uncomplicated hospital course.
# Aspiration - The patient was evaluated by video swallow, which showed aspiration with straw sips of thin liquids; penetration with cup sips of thin liquids.
PO diet: regular solids, nectar thick liquids during meals; 2.
Warfarin as an outpatient.
Although initially held, the patient was started back on Warfarin while hospitalized.
# CAD: S/p CABG in [**2182**], chronically in Afib.
His Levothyroxine was increased from 75mcg daily to 100mcg daily.
