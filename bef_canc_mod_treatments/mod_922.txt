On [**2173-5-15**], he was prematurely changed from IV steroids to po Medrol.
He had severe pain and at first we increased his methadone and Neurontin, and started a Morphine PCA pump.
We had him on pantoprazole GI prophylaxis, and watched him closely on the neurologic service.
Over the coming days with his movement and pain was somewhat better controlled, Rheumatology saw him and agreed with Solu-Medrol, and then felt that he would also benefit from steroids after that as well.
He was given naloxone with much benefit.
We transferred him to the Intensive Care Unit for further observation on [**5-20**] as well as a STAT electroencephalogram was performed.
It was felt that his acute change in mental status was attributed to his increased pain medications especially his PCA pump.
IV steroids and Solu-Medrol were continued, and a full course was given in five days.
Again Rheumatology recommended to continue Imuran 50 mg q day as well as continue 1.2 mg of Medrol IV divided in [**Hospital1 **] dosages.
They also recommended that infliximab may be used 5 mg/kg IV x1, and after the IV steroids were completed, and then two weeks later as well as six weeks after that.
He was also given a bowel regimen of Senna, Dulcolax, and Colace, and he was able to control his bowels as well.

His pain was controlled on his gabapentin, nortriptyline, Percocet, and methadone and his leg shaking was controlled on increasing doses of primidone tapered up to 225 mg po tid.
