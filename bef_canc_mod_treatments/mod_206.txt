He was given ASA 325mg and Tylenol 650mg as well as Metoprolol 5mg IV.
Levaquin 750mg po was administered at 16:00 for concern of pneumonia.
Patient was evaluated by the cardiology fellow, and a heparin gtt was ordered, but not started per nursing notes.
Past Medical History: -Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation, not on coumadin -ESRD s/p living donor (sister) renal transplant in [**5-/2154**] -CAD:    - s/p acute MI [**2143**] with Palmaz LAD and RCA stents    - s/p rotablation and hepacoat stent to the D1 in [**6-/2149**], treated with brachytherapy for instent restenosis in [**10/2149**]    - s/p Taxus stent in RPL in [**10/2151**]    - s/p two Cypher stents placed in the RCA [**10/2152**]    - cath in [**7-23**] with 60-70% ostial stenosis of LAD, moderate diffuse disease of LCx, 60% proximal of RCA with in stent restenosis with a 70% in the PL branch Taxus stent(for latest cath, see pertinent results) -Denies h/o DM; however, sugars have been elevated in past -Chronic angina -Hypertension -Hypercholesterolemia -Wegener's granulomatosis (renal/pulmonary involvement) diagnosed [**2143**] s/p cytoxan/prednisone x 1y initially, ANCA neg.
since (chronic proteinuria); now s/p renal transplant in [**5-/2154**]  -Idiopathic pericarditis [**2150**] -GERD -Anxiety, endorses dysthymic symptoms but not depression -Gout -Umbilical hernia repair -Restless leg syndrome .
EKG demonstrated NSR with old Q wave in V3 but new ST depressions in V5-V6 and I, aVL as well as ST elevations in V1 and V2 as compared with prior dated [**2154-7-25**].
Was started on heparin gtt, integrillin gtt the latter of which was d/c'd on the day of transfer to the CCU.
Was treated with abx for PNA, and pulm also had plan for bronch/IBAL [**10-14**] but course was complicated by intermittent hypotension and hct drop to 25 for which he was transfused 3 units of prbc's and 1L of NS.
Patient was given furosemide 40mg IV with urine output of 700cc in 2 hours.
He was also given morphine 1mg IV x 4, and lorazepam 0.5mg IV x 1.
# PNA Pt arrived to the CCU in respiratory distress with RR of 40, ABG 7.44/18/56/13; BiPAP was tried but pt was eventually intubated since the CCu teamed feared he was becoming fatigued.
Pulm bronched pt showing minimal blood and hemoptysis resolved quickly after intergrillin had been stopped.
He was given IV lasix over the next couple of days with great results.
# CAD s/p mulitple stents Pt likely had a minor NSTEMI on admission and definitely had interval inferolateral wall motion abnormalities from prior to admission.
The decision was made to continue to [**Hospital 18110**] medical management and do a stress MIBI as an outpatient for risk startification since this all happened in the setting of an acute illness.
# Atrial Fibrillation On the evening of extubation ([**10-15**]) pt entered afib with a ventricular resonse rate of 100-120s.
Lopressor 5mg IV x3 and diltiazem was both tried but unsucessful.
Therefore, cardioversion was performed with pt returning into sinus rhyhtm.
Pt was therefore given bicarb per renal recommendation with good effect.
Immodium was prescibed with some effect and mycophenolate preparation was changed since the different preparations have different GI side effects.
# Wegener's disease Patient is s/p 6 match donor transplant in [**2154-5-17**] with basline Cr 1.8-2.1 since [**Month (only) 205**].
Meds were renally dosed, bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 5**] while on immunosupression, lisinopril was held due to raised creatinine.
sirolimus and cellcept initially continued sirolimus level was normal/elevated, then sirolimus was d/c'd due to concern over pulm toxicity.
Perhaps a medication effect, although bone marrow biopsy may be indicated if persists and other causes are ruled out as an outpt.
