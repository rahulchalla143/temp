His coumadin was held during his stay given his acute bleed but restarted per his PCP with the guidance of GI on the day of discharge.
- Biopsies were obtained during his colonoscopy and he should follow up with gastroenterology for the results.
The exception is that per his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] aspirin will be held for 2 weeks given that he was restarted on coumadin with his risk of bleeding.
#DM-2 -- The patient was maintained on his home insulin regimen.
#h/o DVT/PE:  Coumadin was initially held.
It was unclear at first as to why the patient required life-long anticoagulation.
After discussing this with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was clear that the patient had had recurrent DVTs and ultimately a PE and his PCP felt strongly that he required long-term anticoagulation.
