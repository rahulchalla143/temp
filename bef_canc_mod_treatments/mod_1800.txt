He was treated with blood products, PRBC's and FFP, GI was consulted and the plan was discussed at length with his family along with his primary care physician.
The patient was re-started on IV PPI's because of his inability to tolerate po medications and the families concerns that he was symptomatic from reflux.
The patient was also transfused at the end of his hospitalization without incident with lasix following transfusion.
The patient is lethargic and fluctiations in sodium are likely without any po intake.
1/2 NS was given to try and correct this and was ineffective.
It was stopped due to concerns of too much volume with his TPN and blood products.
The patient was given vitamin K and his INR corrected to 1.2 on discharge.
Vitamin K can be given on an as needed basis.
Last admission made NPO and on TPN, will continue per families request.
#severe AS ([**Location (un) **] 0.6 cm) EF 50% Continue supportive care, patient may need as need lasix 10 mg IV for SOB QD.
The patient has required a minimal amount of oxygen while here (1-3L NC).
##Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] (MG)/Dementia Was on pyridostigmine 60 Q8H, called pharmacy to see if this can be given IV-can be given IV but only on short term basis-1.9 mg Q3-4H because drug has a short half life and also has alcohol based preservatives which can cause renal toxicity.
Continue supportive care.
Patient appears to be well rate controlled not on po medications .
# Goals of Care: After initial decision was made not to pursue an endoscopic intervention, palliative care was consulted to help with further discussions about his goals of care given his current GI bleed in the context of extensive medical co-morbidities.
After a long discussion between all parties involved it was decided that he would remain on TPN as per the families wishes.
The following day on the medical floor, the family decided to reverse the patient CMO and switch to DNR/DNI with supportive care but no invasive procedures.
A family meeting was held again with Palliative care and the family on [**2116-1-7**] and they decided that they wanted the patient to continue to receive blood and IV medications.
