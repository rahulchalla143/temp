[**2179-6-28**]: PICC line insertion   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 51 year old female diagnosed with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma by wedge biopsy in [**2179-2-26**].
She underwent right portal vein embolization on [**2179-3-30**], followed by right hepatic trisegmentectomy, lysis of adhesions, appendectomy, and repair of cecal enterotomy on [**2179-5-7**].
On [**2179-5-12**], she underwent ERCP with stent placement for stenosis of the proximal left intrahepatic duct.
Past Medical History: cervical ca in [**2151**] s/p partial vaginal hysterectomy, ovaries still in place osteopenia benign breast tumor s/p resection Hypothyroidism Depression multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma s/p liver resection & appendectomy, s/p right portal vein embolization  Social History: Married.
Biliary drain in the right lobectomy bed, terminating adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm, not within the liver.
[**5-26**] CXR: FINDINGS: Compared with [**2179-5-7**], there are now two chest tubes present at the right base.
A new (presumed drainage) catheter is seen overlying the right upper quadrant.
The JP tube located at the hepatic resection bed is draining the right pleural cavity.
The contrast injected through this drainage catheter is being suctioned by the chest tube.
Gastrografin enema was performed up to the level of the mid transverse colon.
ET tube, nasogastric tube, and right subclavian line are in standard placements respectively.
Right subclavian central venous catheter is unchanged.
[**5-31**] CXR: Small right apical pneumothorax and tiny right pleural effusion unchanged over 48 hours, two right basal and two right upper chest tubes in place.
Minimal residual right pneumothorax and small amount of residual pleural fluid/pleural reaction.
She was started on abx (vanco, meropenem, fluc) and was also noted to have a sodium of 115.
She was given albumin for rehydration.
Thoracic surgery was consulted for her lung issues.
Chest tubes were then inserted.
She was started on meropenem and vancomycin for VRE in her pleural fluid on [**5-26**].
On [**5-28**], she was also taken to the OR for a Right empyema and diaphragmatic injury with thoracic surgery; the procedure performed was Right thoracotomy, total pulmonary decortication, diaphragmatic defect repair, pleural flap buttress,  intercostal muscle flap buttress and flexible bronchoscopy.
Methadone was started for pain control on [**5-31**].
She was started on TPN on [**6-1**] and was encouraged to increase her PO intake.
She was hence scheduled for an ERCP on [**6-3**], which confirmed a biliary leak likely due to stent migration.
She had a PTC on [**6-7**]; on the same day, her chest tubes were placed to water seal per the thoracics service.
One chest tube was later d/c'd by thoracics.
She received lasix daily, with a goal of 1 litre negative per 24 hours.
Her JP drain was manipulated beside, with drainge of approx 100cc and she taken back to radiology for drainage of another 60cc.
Pt's chest tube was noted to have decreased drainage on [**6-18**]; hence, a CXR was done which showed a small amount of fluid within the right lateral basal pleural space, unchanged from prior films.
The Thoracic team converted this to an empyema tube on [**6-21**].
They recommended continuing antibiotics to finish a 6 week course.
ID recommended using Ertapenem instead of meropenum, voriconazole instead of caspo and discontinuation of daptomycin.
Linezolid was recommended if an oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for VRE was needed.
Meropenem was switched to Ertapenem, capsofungin was switched to voriconazole, and dapto was stopped on [**6-23**].
On [**6-25**], a torso CT demonstrated decreased subhepatic fluid collection with appropriate position of pigtail drain and nearly resolved right medial pneumothorax and foci of loculated air along prior chest tube tract.
Her PICC line was d/c'd and sent for culture, which was also negative.
On [**6-25**], meropenem and daptomycin were restarted; ertapenem was stopped.
Voriconazole was continued until [**2179-6-28**], when it was stopped due to concerns about its effects on liver function; her LFTs were still elevated at that time.
Daptomycin was d/c'd on [**6-29**].
