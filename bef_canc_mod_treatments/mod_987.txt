This did not appear to be cardiovascular or infectious in nature, but rather an inbalance of insulin administration and food ingestion.
He responded well to gluocose administration and was discharged from the ICU in stable condition.
While on the floor he underwent dialysis without event and was seen by the [**Last Name (un) **] team who suggested modifications to his insulin regimen.
He remained on his outpatient regimen, and aside from the new insulin regimen he had the following changes in his BP regimen: His labetolol 100 mg tid and metoprolol 125 mg [**Hospital1 **], was changed to metoprolol 125 tid, and the patient tolerated this well.
The thought was that perhaps this could be changed to Toprol XL 300 mg daily in the future.
