Your low oxygen levels were caused by heart failure and fluid around your lungs which was seen on chest x-ray and chest CT.  On admission, it seemed possible that you had an infection so you were given IV antibiotics until infection was ruled out.
You were treated with lasix, a diuretic, to removed the fluid from around your lungs.
You responded well to the treatment with improvement in your blood's oxygen level.
You will need to follow-up with your physician at your nursing home regarding titration of your diuretic.
------- The following changes were made to your medications: Your lasix dose was increased from 20 mg by mouth daily to 40 mg daily ------- You should seek medical attention at your facility if you experience any of the following symptoms:  increased confusion, fevers, shortness of breath, chest pain, increased swelling in your legs, blood in your urine or burning upon urination, light-headedness to the point of feeling like you may pass out.
If her weight increases by 2 pounds, please give a second 40 mg dose of lasix that evening and continue 40 mg of lasix twice daily by mouth until she returns to her goal weight of 155 lbs.
If the patient becomes short of breath or drop her oxygen saturation, please give a dose of 40 mg of lasix by mouth and monitor for improvement.
As high doses of lasix can drop her blood pressure, please monitor it closely.
