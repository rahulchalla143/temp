Enteroccocus was sensitive to ampicillin but given resistence pattern of staph, he needed to be maintained on vancomycin with gentamicin synergy.
ID was consulted and recommended a 2 wk course of vancomycin with gentamicin to treat the staph.
As an outpatient, he will then be changed to ampicillin and gentamicin for 4 additional weeks to treat the enterococcus.
Vancomycin and gentamicin peaks and troughs were monitored to ensure therapeutic dosing and avoid toxic levels.
After blood cultures cleared, patient had a PICC line placed at bedside for outpatient antibiotics.
CVL was discontinued and tip sent for culture which had no growth at the time of discharge.
He will receive 2 weeks of vancomycin 750 mg Q12H and gent 100 mg Q12H to treat staph line associated bacteremia.
He will then change vanco to ampillin 2 grams Q4H to complete 4 additional weeks of amp/gent for enterococcus [**Date range (1) 68706**].
CBC/diff, renal function, electrolytes, LFTs, gent peak/trough, and vanco trough will need to be checked every 5 days and results should be faxed to the [**Hospital **] clinic as instructed.
Patient will likely need suppressive antibiotics after completing his 6 wk course of vancomycin and gentamicin given sternal wires in place.
Ace inhibitor was held due to low normal blood pressures.
He was continued on aspirin and statin.
Beta blocker was held in the setting of GI bleed and then restarted.
# Delerium: Patient had prolonged delerium following recent CABG.
His mental status rapidly improved once antibiotics were started suggesting his delerium was most likely due to his endocarditis.
Hypnotic and sedating meds were held and patient was at his mental status baseline for the remainder of his hospitalization.
Duodenal ulcer treated with injection and clipping.
He was treated with PPI [**Hospital1 **].
He received 2 units of PRBCs during admission.
Aspirin was initially held but was then restarted without incident.
He was started on niferex for presumed iron deficiency anemia.
H pylori Ab was sent which was positive so he was set up to receive triple therapy for treatment.
The plan was to continue PPI [**Hospital1 **], change to ampicillin after 2 weeks of vancomycin (which would take the place of amoxicillin), and then add clarithromycin at that time x 7 days.
# DM: type 2: well controlled on insulin sliding scale and lantus.
Home medications were eventually reconciled and found that patient had been taking metformin SR 1000 mg qpm.
This medication was restarted and his lantus was discontinued.
He was continued on insulin sliding scale.
He was continued on a baby aspirin throughout.
He was started on a statin which continued throughout hospitalization.
He was treated with CPAP nasal pillow, autoset 5-12 mmHg during hospitalization.
# glaucoma: after home medication reconciliation, patient was restarted on his outpatient eye drops for glaucoma.
