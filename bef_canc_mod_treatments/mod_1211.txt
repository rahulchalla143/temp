Treatment with steroids was deferred at the time of diagnosis because of multiple infections (see below) and was ultimately decided to be of little utility due to high risks in the setting of multiple infections, amount of time elapsed from the time of diagnosis, and the advanced stage of scarring seen on biopsy.
Complications included removal of 4 HD catheters, the first of which she pulled out while delirius, the second of which was changed for catheter failure, and the third bled from inlet site, and the fourth of which she agian pulled out while delirious.
CVVH was not considered a treatment option given the  Her hospital course was also complicated by UTI and two pneumonias (community acquired PNA treated on admission with levofloxacin, and later hospital-acquired pneumonia treated with flagyl, cefepime, and vancomycin).
