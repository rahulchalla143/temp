RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, spectral, and color Doppler analysis of the right internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, axillary vein, brachial veins, cephalic vein, and basilic vein was performed.
PICC catheter is seen in one of the brachial veins.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 71 year old man s/p MVR REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please place PICC INDICATION FOR EXAM: This is a 71-year-old man status post MVR, needs IV access.
RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs.
After injection of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine, 21-gauge needle was advanced into the right basilic vein under ultrasonographic guidance.
The needle was then exchanged for a 5 French micropuncture sheath.
The line was then trimmed to this length and advanced over the wire into the distal part of the SVC.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 43 cm long double lumen line with the tip in the distal part of the SVC.
[**12-13**] TECHNIQUE: CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast.
CT CHEST: The patient is status post median sternotomy and near complete removal of the sternum.
There is interval placement of an omental flap and closure of the skin.
ET tube is located 1-1.5 cm from the carina and could be withdrawn approximately 1 cm.
A feeding tube with the tip in the stomach.
Right IJ Cordis catheter within the upper right brachiocephalic vein.
Small periportal nodes do not meet CT criteria for pathology.
Multiple nodules in the subcutaneous tissues in the anterior abdominal wall, likely from medication injection.
CT PELVIS: There is malposition with the Foley catheter likely with the balloon in the urethra.
Right occipital lobe lesion as described above, of uncertain etiology.
A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 year old male admitted from outside hospital with mitral valve endocarditis, R PCA infarcts, and ATN for preop evaluation.
He underwent preoperative workup including cardiac catherization and infectious disease consult.
He received hydration and creatinine was monitored closely.
On [**11-20**] he was brought to the operating room and underwent mitral valve replacement #27mm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9041**] porcine valve.
He was transferred to the cardiac surgery recovery unit requiring vasopressors and blood products.
He returned to the CSRU and postoperative day 1 he was weaned from vasopressors and sedation.
He awoke and responded to voice, weaned to pressure support.
He became asystolic, intubated, and returned to the operating room for reexploration [**11-28**].
He was weaned off pressors and underwent flap closure [**12-12**].
He required returns to the operating room for sternal exploration due to bleeding.
He has continued to progress since sedation was weaned and he underwent a tracheostomy due to failure to wean from the ventilator.
Neuro: required Nimbex while chest open, discontinued with closure.
He is alert, follows commands, and tramadol for pain control  Pulmonary: He was extubated POD 2 and then reintubated [**11-28**] due to cardiac arrest.
Do to failure to wean he required prolonged ventilation, he had a tracheostomy placed # 8 Portex without complications.
He has since been able to tolerate trach collar during the day and rested on the ventilator overnight.
He has required vasoactive medications during ICU stay for blood pressure support with b/p stable off pressors.
Nutrition: Has been receiving tube feeds via NG and now dobhoff.
He passed his swallow evaluation on [**2149-1-3**] for a full diet, but given his poor PO intake, he remains with tube feeds.
Heme: Received multiple blood products due to coagulopathies and falling hematocrit.
Plastics: On [**11-28**] went to operating room due to sternal drainage, he underwent mediastinal exploration with sternal debridement and chest open Underwent sternal wound debridement and VAC dressing placed [**12-1**].
He remained on Nimbex while chest open.
[**12-11**] he returned to the operating room for sternal debridement and omental flap closure and bilateral pectoralis advancement flaps and Nimbex discontinued.
Due to bleeding he returned to the operating room multiple times for reexploration of chest and washout.
JP have been removed by plastics and sternum has staples that are to be maintained for four weeks.
ID: enterococcal mitral valve endocarditis with septic emboli, Mitral valve replaced [**11-20**] and valve tissue culture + enterococcus received vancomycin, fluconazole,levoquin, ampicillin and ceftriaxone based on increased WBC and culture data.
