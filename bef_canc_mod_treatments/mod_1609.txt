# Osteomyelitis of left foot and pelvis: Patient was empirically started on vancomycin and meropenem given previous culture sensitivitis for treatment of her osteomyelitis.
She was continued on her her vancomycin and meropenem per infectious disease recommendations.
Given the multifocal and significant disease burden, debridement and amputation were tabled during this admission and therapy with antibiotics alone was pursued.
Patient will need to follow up with outpatient infectious disease specialists for further management as well as with her outpatient orthopedic surgeon to discuss possible future left below knee amputation.
# Tachycardia/hypotension: Initially there was high concern for sepsis given her pressures in the 70s and tachycardia in the 130s.
The levophed was tapered off and patient remained with similar pressures.
Differential for the patient's strange hemodynamics include neurogenic causes given her transverse myelitis as volume repletion, pressors, and treatment of her infection had little effect on her heart rate and blood pressure.
The possibility of PE was considered but was felt unlikely given the patient's pristine oxygen saturations on room air, lack of dyspnea and baseline paraplegia as well as the chronic nature of her hemodynamics.
She was given enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis.
We also noticed that anxiety and pain were at times contributors and recommend continuing her lorazepam and morphine as needed.
# Anemia- Patient with baseline hematocrit around 25 (microcytic anemia).
She remained close to this baseline during hospitalization with an occasional dip to 20.
Continued her home iron supplements.
Of note, patient is not a candidate for blood transfusions given her religious views (Jehovah?????
Recommend monitoring stools since patient is at risk given her long term antibiotics.
She was continued on her home zyprexa 5 mg PO qHS and home ativan.
She also received her home dose of risperdal 50 mg IM on [**2-25**].
She will need to receive her next dose on [**3-10**] (medicine is written for every two weeks).
# Neurogenic bladder- Chronic Foley use leading to wide open patulous urethral meatus, requiring Foley to be blown up 30 cc.
She was given ditropan (is on vesicare at home) and foley was left in place.
She was seen by wound care who recommended dressing changes as above.
She was also seen be Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], a plastic surgeon, who felt there was no acute indication for debridement, but felt that she would benefit from outpatient follow up and consideration of a skin flap.
On DC needs to pursue wheelchair repair and seating eval.
