Admission Date:  [**2190-9-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2190-9-13**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 78-year-old male with a complicated medical history, status post three myocardial infarctions with multiple interventions, multiple gastrointestinal bleeds, and hypercoagulable state, also chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who was unable to sleep last night because of his "angina," stronger than usual.
The pain was relieved temporarily with a sublingual nitroglycerin.
The patient came to the Emergency Room when the chest pain persisted after three nitroglycerin tablets.
The patient was taken straight to the cardiac catheterization laboratory when the pain persisted after nitroglycerin drip and heparin drip in the Emergency Room.
The patient was sent to the floor on Integrilin, Plavix, aspirin and nitroglycerin drip.
In [**2190-2-28**], the patient had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and PTCRA of the left anterior descending and D1.
In [**2190-2-28**], the patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing gastric varices and Grade I-II esophageal varices and gastric ulcers, status post laser cautery.
The patient has hypercoagulable state and is status post splenic infarct, multiple pulmonary emboli, cardiovascular accident, and portal vein thrombosis.
He also has chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 to 1.8, mild congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 50 to 55%, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy and CMML diagnosed in [**2188**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29050**] at [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Synthroid 50 mcg by mouth once daily, Lopressor 50 mg by mouth three times a day, Epogen 40,000 units weekly with hematocrit is less than 36, aspirin 81 mg by mouth once daily, Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once daily, lasix 20 mg by mouth once daily, Prilosec 20 mg by mouth twice a day, and Augmentin 500 mg twice a day for a urinary tract infection started on the [**3-2**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:   This is a 78-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including multiple myocardial infarctions with interventions in the past year, who was admitted with unstable angina.
At this time, he had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to his posterior descending artery, however, this was complicated by loss of a small marginal branch.
The chest pain and the electrocardiogram changes resolved after two sublingual nitroglycerins.
The patient was restarted on heparin drip and observed over the weekend.
The patient had a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to the D1 leaving less than 50% residual.
Integrilin was started, and Angioseal was done to the right femoral artery.
A pressure dressing was applied.
In the Coronary Care Unit, heparin and aspirin were restarted.
While the patient was in the Coronary Care Unit, he did have one episode of chest pain on [**9-7**], with lateral ST depressions, similar to previous episodes, which were again relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin.
Coumadin and Plavix were also restarted on the [**9-9**].
There we continued him on Lopressor 25 mg twice a day, Imdur 30 mg by mouth once daily, and aspirin 81 mg by mouth once daily, as well as Plavix 75 mg by mouth once daily and Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once daily, as well as heparin drip.
Coumadin was initiated at 5 mg by mouth once daily.
The patient quickly recovered with 1 liter of fluid resuscitation, and had no further episodes of bradycardia or hypotension after his Lopressor was again put back to 25 mg by mouth twice a day.
His Imdur was also increased to 60 mg by mouth once daily, which the patient tolerated well.
This was seen in the patient's CBC, where his white blood cell count increased to 29,000 after his right groin hematoma developed, and then came back down to his baseline of 15 to 20,000.
After his bleed into his right thigh hematoma, the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells, as his hematocrit was lingering at about 29 or 30.
We gave him a dose of Epogen 40,000 units x 1 to help him regenerate his red blood cell count, as well as continuing him on iron sulfate and vitamin B12 and folate.
We maintained him, for the most part, on heparin while he was in-house, and then dosed him on Coumadin before he was discharged.
He was given Protonix 40 mg by mouth once daily as prophylaxis.
We continued him on Proscar and Flomax throughout his stay.
Infectious Disease:  The patient is status post urinary tract infection.
Repeat urinalysis after his antibiotic course was completed showed negative urinalysis.
Because we were concerned that the patient may have a cellulitis developing over the skin over the hematoma, he was started on oxacillin 2 grams intravenously every six hours.
This resolved within two to three days on oxacillin, and the patient was discharged home on a course of dicloxacillin to complete ten days of antibiotic coverage.
He was maintained on Synthroid 15 mcg by mouth once daily during his hospital stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   Dicloxacillin 250 mg four times a day until [**9-19**], Zestril 10 mg by mouth once daily, lasix 20 mg by mouth once daily, atenolol 25 mg by mouth once daily, Imdur 60 mg by mouth once daily, iron sulfate 325 mg by mouth once daily, Coumadin 5 mg by mouth once daily, nitroglycerin .4 mg sublingually every five minutes x 3 for chest pain, folic acid 1 mg by mouth once daily, Flomax 0.4 mg by mouth once daily, Proscar 5 mg by mouth once daily, Darvocet N 100 one tablet by mouth every four hours one-half hour before physical therapy as needed, percocet one to two tablets by mouth every four to six hours as needed for pain, Protonix 40 mg by mouth once daily, Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once daily, Plavix 75 mg by mouth once daily until [**2190-10-10**], enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily, Synthroid 15 mcg by mouth once daily, vitamin B12 15 mg by mouth once daily, Tylenol 650 mg by mouth every four to six hours as needed, Serax 15 mg by mouth daily at bedtime as needed, Colace 100 mg by mouth twice a day.
