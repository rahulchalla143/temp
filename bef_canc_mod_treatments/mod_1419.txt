After her operation, the patient was admitted to the ICU NPO, on IV fluids, on a 1-day course of antibiotics, with a foley catheter, JP drain, PTBD, and NGT in place.
On POD#1, the patient was successfully extubated, and placed on a ketamine drip for pain control.
Later that day, the ketamine drip was discontinued, and an epidural was placed for pain control.
For a short period (approximately 1 hour) after placing the epidural, the patient required a small dose of pressor support to maintain her blood pressures.
She remained NPO, with JP, PTBD, NGT and foley in place, as well as the epidural continued for pain control.
On POD#5, her NGT was clamped, and epidural and all other drains were maintained.
On this day, due to some concern about erythema around her incision, she was stared on IV cefazolin.
Her foley was removed and she urinated independently.
On POD#6, her PTBD had a drain study performed on it, and upon satisfactory results (reader referred to "Pertinent Results") the drain was removed.
Additionally, her JP drain was discontinued.
On POD#7, due to a marked improvement in the appearance of her incision, her IV cefazolin was discontinued.
Her epidural was removed, and she was transitioned to oral pain medications, which she tolerated well.
Her staples were removed on POD#10 and steri strips were placed.
Wound care was performed regularly and thoroughly.
The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
