Admission Date:  [**2195-7-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-8-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2139-1-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Azithromycin / Metformin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CVL placement Midline access placement Intubation Thrombolysis of submassive PE EGD and Colonoscopy IVC filter placement   History of Present Illness: 56 yo [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] male with Crohn's disease, diverticulosis s/p hemicolectomy times 2, type 2 diabetes, and obesity who initially presented to OSH for shortness of breath of one week duration and found to have bilateraly submassive PEs and intubated for respiratory failure.
Received TPA for thrombolysis and heparin gtt was started.
After the heparin gtt was initiated, pt developed maroon stools mixed with BRBPR, thought likely secondary to underlying crohn's disease.
Hcts were measured closely and fell from 40 on admission to 30 following heparin initiation.
Steroids were increased from 20mg daily to 40mg daily and pt was continued on pentasa.
In the ICU, patient underwent colonoscopy, showing diffuse crohn's disease consistent with a flare but no intervention was warranted.
IVC filter was placed on [**2195-8-4**], should the patient require emergent cessation of anticoagulation secondary to large GI bleed.
Bridge to coumadin has been initiated.
Past Medical History: Type 2 Diabetes Obestiy Crohn's disease, with history of GI bleed Hypertension Diverticulitis s/p Partial Colectomy x 2 s/p Multiple Herniorraphy's Arthritis   Social History: Patient is not married but lives with significant other (female) and lives in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 19700**].
Right femoral site has dressing from IVC placement - c/d/i.
CXR ([**2195-7-30**]): The ET tube tip is 4.5 cm above the carina.
Bilateral Lower Extremity Vein Ultrasound ([**2195-7-31**]):  IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 yo [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] with DMII, HTN, crohn's disease on steroids, diverticulosis s/p colectomy X 2, who was admitted to the MICU on [**7-29**] for respiratory failure requiring intubation secondary to submassive PE.
Patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] and found to have submassive clot burden on CTA with significant hypoxia (PAO2 only 130 in spite of 100% oxygen).
He required intubation for respiratory failure and also had evidence of right heart strain from bedside echo.
He was lysed with TPA and extubated afteward.
He was begun on heparin gtt.
Shortly after the initiation of heparin, pt developed maroon stools with BRBPR and required transfusion of 4 u PRBC.
Hematocrits were measured closely and fell from 40 on admission to 30 following heparin initiation.
Steroids were increased from 20mg daily to 40mg daily and pt was continued on pentasa.
He underwent colonoscopy and was found to have evidence of active Crohns disease, though no active bleeding was identified.
His hematocrit stabilized but because he had a clot in his lower extremities in combination with concerns regarding his ability to tolerate anticoauglation in the short term, an IVC filter was placed on [**2195-8-4**].
Vital signs remained stable without any requirement for supplemental oxygen.
On the floor, heparin gtt was continued with bridge to therapeutic INR with Coumadin.
The option to be discharged home on lovenox therapy was presented to the patient on several occasions but given the gravity of his presentation and his underlying anxiety, pt preferred to remain hospitalized until his INR was therapeutic.
In order to reach this INR, coumadin doses were increased as tolerated, with daily doses between 5-15 mg daily depending on the INR.
On [**2195-8-10**], patient reported that central line was accidentally removed during showering, and occlusive dressing was placed.
Patient was given midline access and was without anticoagulation for approximately 3-4 hours.
He will likely need anticoagulation for at least 3 months, with repeat LENIs to determine if clot burden is still present.
If clots are absent, stopping of anticoagulation may be considered.
However, if his underlying crohn's disease is the etiology of his increased susceptibility to hypercoagulability, patient may require life-long anticoagulation with coordinated care between his PCP and gastroenterologist.
In regards to patient's IVC filter, it was not removed during this admission due to persistent clot burden and the necessity to continue heparin gtt.
Patient developed maroon stools with BRBPR in response to initiation of heparin gtt, with concurrent drop in hematocrit from 40 on admission to 26 on [**2195-8-2**].
Prior to admission, patient was on 20mg PO prednisone taper for prior crohn's flare.
As above, following administration of tpa lysis and heparin gtt for PE, patient developed BRBPR and maroon stools.
GI followed patient during this admission and increased PO steroid dose to 40mg PO in the MICU.
He was continued on mesalamine 500mg PO BID.
On [**2195-8-10**], GI was re-consulted and his prednisone was tapered down.
Patient will follow up with his gastroenterologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], for further management as an outpatient.
Patient will be discharged on his home insulin regimen, which he reports was effective in controlling his sugars.
The tapering of steroids will help with better sugar control.
Patient's outpatient medication for hypertension included lisinopril.
Blood pressures remained stable following re-initiation of this medication.
Patient believed that he was not medically stable, was anxious, and demanded to stay on heparin gtt until he was therapeutic.
Denied several offers to leave on lovenox therapy.

We treated your with medication to dissolve your clot and this caused you to have lower GI bleeding.
We then put a filter in your IVC, put you on blood thinners, and your bleeding has improved.
Your vital signs and hematocrit continue to remain stable.
You were given coumadin to thin your blood and now your INR levels are therapeutic.
We made the following changes to your medications: -ADDED Coumadin 7.5mg by mouth daily.
Your primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] tell you whether to increase or decrease this medication to keep your INR between 2 and 3 -ADDED Prednisone 30mg by mouth daily.
Please talk to your doctor about starting Bactrim for prophylaxis if you will require long term steroids.
Please follow up with him regarding the tapering of your steroid doses.
The clinic will call you in the afternoon and tell you if you need to adjust your coumadin dose.
If this ultrasound is negative, you may consider stopping anticoagulation and schedule to remove your IVC filter.
