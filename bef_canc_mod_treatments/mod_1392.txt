Uncomplicated placement of 8 French, 25-cm internal-external biliary drain [**2173-5-24**].
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 69 year old man with a history of PUD s/p gastric resection followed by Roux-en-Y in the distant past, recently hospitalized ~3 months following a Whipple procedure [**12-28**], who presents with failure to thrive.
He underwent the aforementioned procedure on [**2173-1-20**], and had a very complicated post-operative course with anastomotic leak of the hepaticojejunostomy and of the pancreaticojejunostomy, associated with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections (pathology revealed moderately differentiated T2N0 adenocarcinoma).
He had multiple IR drains placed, and was taken back to the OR on [**2-5**] for repair of the pancreaticojejunostomy.
His course was also complicated by allergic reactions to multiple antibiotics, acute renal failure, pulmonary failure requiring a tracheostomy, and cholangitis.
He was dependent on TPN for an extended period of time.
He last underwent ERCP on [**2173-5-13**], which demonstrated a widely patent choledochojejunostomy, and his PD stent was removed.
