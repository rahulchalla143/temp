**Overdue for colonoscopy and will need follow-up scheduled with gastroenterology for colonoscopy by PCP after discharge.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Intubated in the ED for hypercarbic respiratory failure and transferred to the ICU, where she was aggresively diuresed for dCHF decompensation as detailed below and a suspected multi-drug resistant PNA in light of the patient's history of MDR GNRs on sputum culture.
Her condition rapidly improved on antibiotics and with diuresis and she was durably extubated [**2197-12-27**] and subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service for further management as detailed below.
# Suspected MDR PNA: Initially treated with vancomycin, meropenem, and azithromycin for MDR PNA given the patient's history of sputum growing GNRs sensitive to meropenem during a recent hospitalization.
On admission to the ICU, sputum cultures were collected and confirmed GNRs, at which point vancomycin and azithromycin were stopped; however, it was not until after the meropenem course was completed that sensitivities showed resistance to meropenem and sensitivity to imapenem.
Further antibiotics were deferred in the absence of any clinical signs or symptoms of PNA, including no leukocytosis, fever, or productive cough.
# COPD Flare: Started on a steroid pulse in the ICU for a presumed COPD flare in the setting of dCHF decompensation - methylprednisolone 125 mg IV q8h tapered to 80 IV q8h over 3 days; transitioned to Prednisone 40 mg daily with taper planned to 10 mg, ending [**2197-12-29**].
She was diuresed aggressively in the ICU with lasix and metolazone and continued diuresis on the floor to her dry weight, being mindful of the patient's preload dependence with dCHF/AF/mod-AS.
Diuresis resulted in a contraction alkalosis in the setting of chronic metabolic abnormalities as detailed below.
**Potassium will need to be closely followed after discharge and KCL supplementation adjusted accordingly.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Diuresis was complicated by Cr bump, which showed a trend toward normalization with PO intake of fluids.
**Cr will need to be followed after discharge and Torsemide potentially adjusted accordingly.
# (Rhythm) AF: Rate controlled on her home dose metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] and diltiazem, which was uptitrated from her home dose of 360 mg daily to 420 mg daily.
TEE was raised as a potential therapy but ultimately it was decided that the potential benefits of an atrial kick in the setting of chronic AF and dCHF were outweighed by the risks conferred by anticoagulation subsequent to the cardioversion in light of the patient's history of GI bleed on coumadin.
Discharged on an increased dose of diltiazem in addition to metoprolol as detailed below under discharge medications.
**HR will need to be closely followed after discharge and diltiazem and metoprolol titrated accordingly.
Was maintained on home dose ASA 325 mg for primary prevention of MI and CVA.
# Blurry vision: Noted new onset blurry vision without pain or discharge after transfer to [**Hospital1 1516**]; symptoms did not improve with empiric artificial tears for presumed dry eye.
# GERD: Continued home omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 **] unchanged.
# Allergies: Continued home fexofenadine 60 mg unchanged.

You were also treated for a suspected pneumonia, but in retrospect, you may not have had a pneumonia and your symptoms were likely the result of your heart failure.
Your breathing was supported on the ventilator until you were well enough to breathe on your own; you were extubated without any problems and transferred to the cardiology floor for further care, where you continued to receive medication to remove the fluid from your lungs.
Your cardiologist recommended that this rhythm not be corrected by cardioversion and that your heart rate be controlled with medication.
Several changes were made to your medications as detailed below.
Please take your other medications as previously prescribed.
# STOP: Diltiazem 360 mg daily # START: Diltiazem 420 mg daily # STOP: Potassium 40 meq twice daily # START: Potassium 60 meq twice daily  # START: Heparin Subcutaneously unless you are ambulating three times a day; this is to decrease risk of deep vein clots  Please attend the follow-up appointments that we have scheduled for you as detailed below.
