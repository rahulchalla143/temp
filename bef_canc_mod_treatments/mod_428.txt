Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 22873**] is a 57 yo M with non-ischemic CM and other medical problems who presented from [**Hospital3 **] with fevers, altered mental status/agitation, and report of headache, photophobia and confusion at home.
CXR showed multifocal bilateral pneumonia, however the patient was recently treated for pneumonia at [**Hospital1 2177**] and it is cunclear what his CXR looked like at that time.
He was therefore intubated for sedation to attempt LP.
The patient was empirically started on vancomycin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone and acyclovir.
LP was not able to be obtained by several teams over two days and was finally obtained via fluoroscopy by interventional radiology.
After OSH blood cultures revealed strep pneumonia, dexamethasone was started for a planned total of 16 doses.
CSF was consistent with bacterial meningitis, despite the patient being on antibiotics for approximately three days.
We stopped empiric ampicillin and continued acyclovir only until HSV PCR was negative.
The patient continued on IV ceftriaxone and vancomycin, had a PICC placed and was transferred to the floor.
He is on prednisone 40mg po qday as an outpatient for this possible vasculitis and therefore will be maintained on this dose.
An HIV test was done given multiple infections over past few months.
