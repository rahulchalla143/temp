In the late [**2092**]'s, the patient was run over by a train and has since required multiple reparative operations since that time.
The patient had a tracheostomy placed, and was ventilated for a prolonged period of time.
Subsequent to coming off the ventilator, the patient has had the tracheostomy removed and placed multiple times with a tracheal T tube for post-tracheostomy tracheal stenosis.
The patient has also had multiple dilatations and ablative therapy without sustained efficacy.
The patient most recently had his tracheal T tube removed, and underwent a rigid bronchoscopy performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**].
The patient was also noted to have a wire stent in his left main bronchus, which was noted to be patent.
The patient was subsequently recommended for a tracheal resection that will take place on [**2125-6-20**] under the direction of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**].

The patient was therefore cleared for surgery, and on [**2125-6-20**], underwent a tracheal resection and reconstruction.
The patient tolerated this procedure well and was noted to have an intraoperative estimated blood loss of 150 cc.
Patient was administered Levophed and transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells with good effect.
His JP drain and central venous line were discontinued without complication, as was his Foley catheter; the patient was subsequently noted to be independently productive of adequate amounts of urine for the duration of his stay.
Due to some mild erythema at his neck surgical site, the patient was started on oral levofloxacin on postoperative day #5 on which he remained for the duration of his stay.
In addition, the patient's Coumadin was restarted and titrated for a target INR between 1.5-2.5.
Following review of the patient's past medical records, it was noted that the patient had exhibited similar episodes of unexplained hypotension on prior admissions, which were at that point ascribed to adrenal insufficiency in the setting of steroid discontinuation and the patient on chronic low dose steroid therapy.
It was noted that the patient had undergone a steroid taper prior to his current operation, and that for healing purposes, he had not been restarted on his standard prednisone scheduled postoperatively.
The patient was therefore started on IV dexamethasone 4 mg [**Hospital1 **], to good initial effect.
Endocrine consultation deemed the patient's episode less likely to be attributable to adrenal insufficiency, considering the patient had experienced an additional episode of hypotension following reinstitution of his steroid therapy.
Nevertheless, Endocrine recommended continuation of the patient's steroid schedule with prednisone 10 mg po q day and advised followup on an outpatient basis with the autonomic dysfunction laboratory.
The patient's neck incision was subsequently aspirated with drainage of [**11-14**] cc of serosanguinous fluid and no evidence of purulence.
