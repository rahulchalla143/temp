She had also used her BiPAP overnight the day prior to admission, which she does not always use unless she is not feeling well.
PCO2 was 51, received .5 mg of Ativan and started on BiPAP, received 1 gram of Ceftriaxone 10 units of insulin, 1 amp of D50, 1 amp of calcium gluconate for K of 6.4.
G tube in place with some erythema and induration.
Neurological sedated after Ativan and on BiPAP, later responded appropriately to questions and moved all extremities.
Respiratory:  The patient has a baseline elevated CO2 likely due to bronchiectasis with VQ mismatch as well as [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 12794**] effect and decreased respiratory drive.
The patient was treated with Ceftazidime and Levofloxacin.
She received BiPAP as tolerated during the day as well and Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers and chest physical therapy and frequent suctioning.
The patient was initially treated with intubation and mechanical ventilation, but was successfully extubated on [**2131-1-16**].
On the [**7-17**] the patient's blood gas was 7.40/62/181 and it was felt the patient had improved significantly enough to transfer to pulmonary rehabilitation or the floor service.
The patient was transferred to the floor, but returned to the Intensive Care Unit on [**1-18**], with hypercarbic respiratory failure likely secondary to decreased ability to suction the patient, provide chest physical therapy and respiratory treatment on the floor.
She continued on BiPAP at night and received 2 liter transtracheal oxygen with saturations in the 100% range.
After intensive suctioning and chest physical therapy the patient could tolerate even 1 liter transtracheal O2 with an oxygen saturation on 100%  Subacute decline necessitated reintubation [**2131-1-21**], and eventually patient underwent bedside percutaneous tracheostomy placement to facilitate ventilation and allow adequate suctioning.
Plan was to work towards eventual liberation from mechanical ventilation if tolerated..  She is to be screened for and admitted to a pulmonary rehab facility.
Cardiovascular:  The patient had no signs of pulmonary edema on chest film.
When she returned from the unit to the floor she received a Lasix drip, which resulted in greater then 1 liter fluid extraction.
She was started on a po regimen of Lasix, which she could continue as an outpatient.
Infectious disease:  The patient was given Ceftazidime and Levo empirically for coverage of gram negative, Pseudomonas and pulmonary gram positive and atypical pathogens.
She completed a fourteen day course, but appeared to have some increasing patchiness in her right lower lobe on chest film of [**2131-1-18**] and was restarted on Levo and Ceptaz after a fourteen day course had just completed.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient tolerated tube feeds well and was given Zantac for prophylaxis.
For this reason she was starred on a Lasix drip and titrated after which she was started on a po Lasix regimen and the Foley was removed.
Psychiatric:  The patient expressed significant grief of the difficulty she is faced due to her medical issues and the desire for her to go home and refuse care.
to be initially used for sedation at night, while weaning her off 1 mg of Ativan she has usually been taking in house, but then the Remeron could be increased to give as an anti-depressant dose as an outpatient.
