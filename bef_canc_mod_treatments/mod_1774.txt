Please get MRI with gadolinium and diffusion weighted imaging.
Following gadolinium, irregular enhancement is seen in this region.
The diffusion signal changes have decreased since the previous study, but the T2 abnormalities have increased with well-defined margins.
However, given the clinical history of listeria meningitis, associated infection could not be excluded and correlation with CSF findings and followup up are recommended.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o toxic megacolon SUPINE AND ERECT - ABDOMEN  HISTORY: 54-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis and abdominal pain, rule out megacolon.
