She was sent from rehab to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for HD due to her current diarrhea from c.diff colitis and concerns about her volume status.
She was seen in the ED then sent for HD with 2.5 fluid removed.
She had a RIJ placed for access.
Allergies: Aspirin / Aleve / Codeine / Depakote  Past Medical History: * Chronic Gastric Angiodysplasia (GAVE)and consequent chronic low-grade UGIB, and has therefore been advised not to take aspirin or other antiplatelet agents.

The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber, with atherosclerotic calcifications.
Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology in this case.
Extensive third spacing of fluid including subcutaneous fluid, pleural effusions and ascites.
# Hypotension:  Coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hypothermia and hypotension was concerning for sepsis.
Her BP was not responsive currently to IVF, she received total of 1.5 L in ED and 1 L on floor, she was started on neo (did not tolerate levophed) and started on broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin IV and cefepime IV as well as vancomycin po and flagyl iv for her c.diff.
She received her usual dialysis, but did not tolerate much fluid removal.
She was eventually weaned off of her pressors.
For several dialysis sessions, she was unable to have a high enough BP for adequate fluid removal, but BPs started to improve and patient was tolerated dialysis with approx 2-3L removal per session.
Patient evenutally converted with HRs in 80-100s and BPs improved.
Electrophysiologists were consulted and started 4 week amiodarone load with 400 mg daily.
Also on digoxin 0.125 mg every other day.
Pt was not on beta blocker during this time because blood pressure were unable to tolerate.
Will continue amio 400 mg until [**7-10**], then switch to 200 mg daily.
Would treat aggitation with SL zyprexa.
Pt was refusing narcotics for pain control because she could feel herself not thinking clearly.
# Hypoglycemia: Pt has history of diabetes, but is no longer on any diabetic meds because of these low blood sugars.
While on the general medicine floor, had a period ofo altered mental status in which she was too somnolent to eat, and to maintain sugars, we had her on a d10W gtt at 500cc/hr for about 3 days.
# ESRD/HD: On HD MWF.
Needs to continue this schedule as an outpatient.
She was given vitamin k initially, however her coagulopathy is likely [**12-27**] to her hepatopathy [**12-27**] to right heart failure.
No further intervention was necessary.
We discussed possibly doing a therapeutic paracentesis, but with her his risk and lack of symptoms, we decided against it.
Tylenol up to 2 gms daily can be used for symptom relief.
Was treated with appropriate course of PO vanco and PO flagyl.
Will continue keppra as outpatient.
A thoracentesis was attempted previously, but unsuccessful.
