Patient received 5L NS in ED and [**Month/Day (4) **] pressure responded adequately.
Transfered to MICU, where she received another 3L NS, resulting in hemodynamic stability.
Never required pressor support.
Started on PO vanc and IV flagyl initially, narrowed to PO vancomycin alone.
Initial concern for infection, but after discussion with ID/Neurosurgery/Neuroradiology, felt less likely an infection and antibiotics were stopped.
Also had burst fracture of indeterminate age at L4 that Nsurg recommended a TLSO brace when out of bed.
She was not discharged on IV antibiotics, and will follow-up with ortho spine on [**2144-9-30**].
Ortho spine also saw the patient while in house and also agreed with conservative management and follow-up as an outpatient.
#AMS: Secondary to septic encephalopathy/hypotension, improved significantly back to baseline with fluid resuscitation and antibiotics.
#Tachycardia: History of SVT, developed narrow complex tachycardia while off home metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and verapamil 40mg daily, resolved after fluid and restarting home meds.
#Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient received stress dose steroids in the setting of her infection and chronic prednisone use at home.
Then, she was rapidly tapered and subsequently maintained on her home prednisone dose.
Plan is to continue home prednisone dosing.
#Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has been on chronic warfarin since [**2134**] when she had bilateral PEs.
INR will need to be monitored while at rehab in light of antibiotics for treatment of C. diff infection.
#HCT drop: HCT dropped from 32 on admission to 23, likely hemoconcentrated, baseline crits ~25 secondary to ACD, sideroblastic anemia, G6PD deficiency, and sickle cell trait.
Hematology consulted, and recommended against transfusion as patient has received many transfusions in the past and there is concern for iron overload.
She was seen by the chronic pain service, who recommended continuing her home tizanidine, lidocaine patch, and gabapentin.
#G6PD: stable; continued folic acid 3 mg daily, and avoided NSAIDs/sulfa drugs.
#Allergic Rhinitis: stable; maintained on Fexofenadine 60 mg (home loratidine not on formulary).
- Monitoring INR in light of oral antibiotic regimen for treatment of C. diff, adjusting coumadin dosing as needed.
- Ensure compliance with TLSO brace   Medications on Admission: Preadmissions medications listed are incomplete and require futher investigation.
