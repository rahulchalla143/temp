Admission Date:  [**2125-12-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-1-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2079-11-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ampicillin / Ciprofloxacin / Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**] Chief Complaint: right flank pain, fever, N/V  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: NONE  History of Present Illness: 46 yo F, 1 day post right ureteral stent removal p/w right flank pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting.
She denies any new medications or exposures.
She first had cystoscopy and stent placement at OSH on [**2125-9-26**].
During the procedure she was noted to have pyohydronephrosis.
Her post-hospital course was signifiant for urinary retention (possibly due to narcotics) on [**10-7**] with foley catheter placement and repeat placement on [**10-11**].
She was readmitted due to fever, abdominal pain and a UA at that time at [**Hospital3 **] had [**11-23**] WBC and she was started on Levaquin IV X3 days and she was discharged with oral bactrim again and with a foley catheter.
She received Vanc/Rocephin first at an OSH and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with urosepsis, and was transfered to the ICU and treated with Vancomycin/Meropenem.
Patient improved with Meropenem, so gave 14 days of Ertapenem with a PICC at d/c.
On [**12-7**], patient had a cystoscopy, ureteroscopy, laser lithotripsy and basket extraction of right ureteral stone, along with placement of a double-J stent.
She was d/c'd on bactrim and within few hours after taking bactrim, was readmitted to hosp with presumed urosepsis and treated wtih course of levaquin.
then returned on [**12-24**] for stent removal.
once again, given bactrim proph, and within 1hour of taking dose, developed chills, nausea, vomiting, and back pain, with associated flushing, red eyes, and myalgias.
She states she had the same reactions every other time she became "septic" which she correlates with some sort of GU procedure or urinary retention.
Pharmacy did not give her Zosyn because of Ampicillin allergy.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: (+)ve: endorses SOB in ED, improved now, skin sensitivity, mild HA (-)ve: chest pain, palpitations, cough, sputum production, hemoptysis, diarrhea, constipation   Past Medical History: updated on discharge [**2126-1-1**] 1. nephrolithiasis with obstrucive (ca oxalate) 5.5 mm right stone s/p ureteral stent [**2125-9-26**] c/b urosepsis, recurrent admissions for presumed urosepsis.
s/p stent exchagne and lithrotripsy [**12-7**] and then stent removal [**12-24**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] 2. urinary retention-resolved.
symptoms of diffuse erythrodermic rash, pruritis, red eyes/blurry vision, skin pain, myalgias, arthrlagias, fevers, low BP-->all initially misinterpretated as urosepsis during [**10-12**] to [**12-12**] period.
ferritin 134 [**Doctor First Name **] 1:40 RF 9 anti ccp pending am cortisol 15.8 .
However, the possibility of emphysematous pyelonephritis cannot be entirely excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 45year old female with complicated recent urological history with obstsructing stone s/p stent [**9-26**] complicated by urosepsis, then urinary retention and recurrent UTIs, lithotripsy/stone removal/stent exchange on [**12-7**], now transfered from OSH 24hours after stent removal [**12-24**] with fevers/hypotension presumed to be urosepsis.
Pt was admitted once again with presumed sepsis after stent removal.
She was given IV vanc/cefepime and supportive care in the ICU.
However, she has more or less been on Abx and this was felt to be the cause.
On review of all of her records, it is now clear that pt has recieved bactrim on multiple occasions after her first exposure in [**9-12**]  and each time has had this similar reaction  (pt recieved bactrim on [**10-4**] (first exposure), then 2nd exposure on [**10-14**] with similar symptoms starting within 12hours (back pain, flushing, fevers, hypotension, arthralgias), then 3rd exposure [**12-8**] wtih symptoms occuring a few hours after, then 4th exposure [**12-25**] am with symptoms occuring shortly after that led to this admission, and now 5th exposure [**12-29**] with symptoms occuring 30min after)  which was interpreted each time as urosepsis given time correlation with invasive urological procedure.
Her Symptoms include: malaise, fever, diffuse rash, hypotension, arhtralgias/myalgias/skin pain, eye tearing, conjunctival injection, periorbital erythema, leukopenia on labs.
She was started on solumedrol with improvement over next 36hours.
She was convered to prednisone 60mg on [**1-2**] with plan to taper slowly over 3weeks per derm to prevent relapse.
Bactrim added to allergy and pt counseled.
She was given symptomatic management otherwise.
She should have a CBC done 1 week after discharge and fax it to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12838**] (ID).

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Bactrim Hypersensitivity-severe reaction Possible mild UTI post stent removal   Discharge Condition: STABLE normal mental status ambulating independently  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a complex of symptoms which we initially thought were due to sepsis from UTI but are now more clearly related to severe allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) to bactrim (sulfa drugs).
you should NEVER take sulfa drugs again, especially bactrim.
For your rash, you will need to be on a slow prednisone (steroid) taper for 3weeks.
You probably did not have a UTI after your stent removal and again, the whole set of symptoms with fever/rash/diffuse pain/blurry vision/eye pain/joint pains were all due to bactrim.
You did recieve 5-6days of antibiotics regardless but you dont need to continue these.
Your stone was made of calcium oxalate.
