Admission Date:  [**2179-11-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2179-11-23**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 72-year-old female with past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was admitted to the CCU with bradycardia and hypotension status post cardiac catheterization.
She was scheduled for mitral valve replacement and required a catheterization as part of her preoperative evaluation.
Patient was then intubated and got Lasix, a nitroglycerin drip, and beta blocker.
She was then started on a Dopamine drip, at which point her rate and pressure both stabilized.
Non-small cell lungs cancer status post right upper lobectomy and mediastinal and lymph node dissection.
She was maintained on aspirin and statin.
However, following stabilization of her blood pressure, beta blocker was added on to her medication regimen.
Based on patient's three-vessel disease she was thought to be a candidate for coronary artery bypass graft.
Patient did require intubation given her pulmonary edema.
She also developed cardiogenic shock during the catheterization, likely a combination of her congestive heart failure decompensation and multiple medications administered.
Pericatheterization, she received Lasix and beta blocker and was started on a nitroglycerin drip.
Following this she was also placed on a Natrecor drip.
However, she then developed hypotension and bradycardia requiring a Dopamine drip for her cardiogenic shock.
A Swan-Ganz was placed for close hemodynamic monitoring.
Following transfer to the unit patient was able to be weaned off the Dopamine drip and her blood pressure stabilized.
There was concern for overdiuresis following her respiratory decompensation.
Patient actually following discontinuation of Lasix and Natrecor continued to autodiurese several liters.
She was gently rehydrated and further diuresis was avoided.
Following stabilization off of pressors, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta blocker were added on and titrated up as tolerated.
Patient with history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on Amiodarone at time of admission:  When patient was first admitted to the CCU she was in sinus rhythm.
However, given her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation she was maintained on a Heparin drip with plans to eventually transition her to Coumadin.
She was then restarted on her Amiodarone, and her Heparin was transitioned over to Coumadin.
Patient is planned for a mitral valve replacement in the near future.
Patient was started on the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for afterload reduction at time of discharge.
She is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for mitral valve replacement.
Following intubation patient was aggressively diuresed, which markedly improved her oxygen.
She was subsequently weaned off the ventilator and easily extubated without any further complications.
Hypothyroidism:  Patient maintained on Synthroid as per her home regimen.
A TSH was checked which showed her to be euthyroid at this time on an appropriate level of thyroid hormone replacement.
Urinary tract infection:  On routine urinalysis a urine culture did grow out Enterococcus.
However, given the finding of Enterococcus in her urine it was decided to treat patient empirically with Cipro as per the Cardiothoracic Surgery service.
Patient was given a prescription for Ciprofloxacin for a total of seven days of treatment.
Coronary artery disease status post cardiac catheterization showing three-vessel disease.
Aspirin 325 q. day.
Atorvastatin 20 mg q. day.
Levothyroxine 125 mcg q. day.
Pantoprazole 40 mg q. day.
Lisinopril 10 mg q. day.
Toprol XL 25 mg q. day.
Amiodarone 200 mg b.i.d.
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg b.i.d.
DI[**Last Name (STitle) 408**]E INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] for plans of mitral valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft.
