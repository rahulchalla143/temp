Started on nitro gtt, and also given ASA 325 and tylenol for ?PNA.
Notes headache that coincided with initiation of nitro gtt in the ED.
ESRD secondary to IgA nephropathy in [**2169**] s/p renal transplant [**2173**] with acute on chronic rejection, resumed HD [**1-25**]; per priro renal notes, there may have been a component of non-compliance with immunosupression meds 2.

Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 59F h/o ESRD on HD [**2-21**] IgA nephropathy s/p failed cadaveric transplant, malignant HTN complicated by seizures, diastolic CHF, Afib, h/o medical non-compliance presented with SOB and hypertensive urgency.
BP's and SOB normalized after dialysis x2 and patient was discharged home in stable condition.
Patient was started on a nitro gtt and place on oxygen on arrival to the ICU, both of which were quickly weaned.
During hemodialysis 3L of fluid taken off with subsequent resolution in respiratory symptoms.
Repeat dialysis removed an additional 2.2 kg.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled, and she received morphine PRN for pain serial ECGs, and fluid and Na restricted diet with monitoring of both.
Nitro gtt weaned as pt transitioned to her home medications.
She was discharged on her home medications of Toprol XL, Diltiazem ER and a new medication of Lisinopril 20mg.
# Headache: Likely due to nitro gtt and temporally coincided and worsened with improved control of HTN.
# Afib: Stroke risk factors include HTN, currently on ASA 325 daily.
Could consider coumadin as likely beneficial, however defer to outpatient providers.
