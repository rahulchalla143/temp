ileal resection [**3-26**] in [**State 108**] for bleeding ulcers.
She recently was long hospitalized in [**State 108**] for GIB, complicated by multiple cscope, EGD, push enteroscopy, pill endoscopy and finally an distal ileal resection for bleeding ulcers, complicated by [**Female First Name (un) **] torulopsis fungemia, treated with fluconazole.
In the ED, VS 96 66 106/86 17 99RA, was noted to have an initial HCT of 38 which trended to 31 over 18hrs, an NGL was performed negative for heme, protonix administered, GI, Heme, [**Doctor First Name **] Consulted, given 1 UPRBC, 2 U Plts, and sent for tagged RBC scan.

However, given recent intervention, attention to this area on a short-term followup radiograph with standard positioning would be helpful to exclude mediastinal hematoma.
IR guided port placement [**6-6**] - Placement of a 7 French right internal jugular double-lumen Port-a-Cath with tip in superior vena cava.
1) GIB - The pt presented with BRBPR with an 8 point Hct drop and required 4 units of pRBCs and 4 bags of platelet tranfusions during the first 24 hours of hospitalization.
GI was emergently consulted and a colonscopy and small bowel enteroscopy performed on the day of admission were also negative for a source of bleeding.
However, the pt subsequently had no furhter episodes of BRBPR and her Hct remained stable without need for further pRBC transfusions after the second hospital day.
Her prednisone dose was increased from 10 mg daily to 60 mg daily to give the pt stress dose steroids in the setting of GI bleed, which was eventually titrated back down to 10 mg daily by the time of discharge.
A R sided port was placed by IR prior to d/c (see below for details).
She was given blood products as above and IVFs with a decrease in her Cr back to baseline.
4) Elevated transaminases - Had been noted as an outpatient in [**4-26**] and medications, including fluconazole, danazol, and a statin were d/c'd.
A RUQ US was unremarkable and a liver MRI was obtained to r/o any evidence of fungal infection given her recent h/o candidemia, the results of which were pending at the time of discharge.
By the time of discharge, her transaminitis was resolving and was thought to be secondary to medication effect.
She was placed on cipro with resolution of fevers and will complete a 7 day course of antibiotics as an outpatient.
She previously had a L sided port which was removed during a hospitalization in [**State 108**] in [**3-26**], which was complicated by candidemia, presumably from a line infection.
On presentation, 2 large bore IVs were placed in the setting of GI bleed.
Surgery attempted port placement on [**6-5**], which had to be aborted due to technical difficulty.
A CXR performed after the procedure was significant for a question of a possible R sided mediastinal hematoma.
The pt underwent a successful IR guided R sided port placement the following day without any complications.
This resolved well with hydration with normal saline.
Statin had been held as an outpatient due to elevated liver function tests as above.
9) HTN - Lopressor and HCTZ were held on admission in the setting of GI bleed, and were restarted by the time of discharge.
