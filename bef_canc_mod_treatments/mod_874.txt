Admission Date:  [**2116-3-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-4-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2038-5-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Hurricaine / Benzocaine / Adenosine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5827**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation Central line placement PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: 77 yo woman w/ h/o Adeno Ca s/p chemo/xrt/resection, COPD, DVT, and HTN, who presents from NH w/ lethargy, worsening shortness of breath, and respiratory distress.
Nitro drip was started which brought SBP down to 140s.
She was given lasix w/ ~500cc urine output, as well as combivent nebs.
Patient was also given antibiotics for UTI.
Aspiration was treated w/ levo 500mg x1, and flagyl 500mg x1.
Patient admitted to MICU for further treatment.
BP's improved on nitro gtt at 133/70.
500cc fluid bolus started, BP's continued to drop to SBP in 70's; therefore, levophed started.
SBP increased to 100-110's after 1.5L NS, levophed, and decadron 4mg x1.
ABG on NRB prior to BiPAP 7.32/72/272.
Past Medical History: Lung Adeno Ca s/p chemoradiotherapy and resection [**6-5**] COPD h/o DVT Hypercholesterolemia Hypertension GERD +PPD  Social History: Lives at [**Hospital3 **].
Consolidation and peribronchial thickening in the right lower lobe, with retained secretions in the trachea, suggesting aspiration or aspiration pneumonia.
Previous right partial pneumonectomy and other stigmata of treatment for lung cancer.
Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube.
WBC 12.5  PLT 163 HCT 37.2 LFTs including amylase and lipase were all WNL .
She also was noted to have HTN with SBP 200s, which improved with nitro gtt.
Respiratory status initially improved with lasix and nebs.
Etiology was felt to be multifactorial, including CHF, COPD exacerbation, and pneumonia.
She ultimately required intubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure (elevated PCO2 around 70s) with decreased mental status on BiPAP.
She had initially been on zosyn, cipro, and flagyl as well, but these were discontinued as there was no evidence of GNR infection.
Sputum culture grew only beta strep (not group A).
She was initially on hydrocortisone (due to hypotension and adrenal insufficiency) and was continued on a prednisone taper for COPD when this was completed.
She was also on standing albuterol and atrovent.
She was then further diuresed with lasix and was ultimately extubated on [**3-25**].
From that time she did well, continuing on her prednisone taper and prn nebs.
She was also started on spiriva to maximize her COPD regimen.
She will complete a steroid taper with 4 more days of 30mg prednisone, then 4 days of 20mg, then 4 days of 10mg, then stop.
She was on a nitro gtt, which was titrated off after diuresis.
The patient's SBP then dropped to the 70s, requiring fluid boluses and pressors.
She was therefore treated with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone as stress dose steroids.
The hypotension was felt to be due to sepsis from her pneumonia, which was treated with vancomycin as above.
She was therefore started on a diltiazem drip, and then converted to PO diltiazam which controlled both her BP and HR.
Her home dose of metoprolol was added back to achieve the best control of her tachycardia.
The patient completed a course of antibiotics for pneumonia as above.
Thereafter, diltiazem was used as above to treat MAT and also to manage blood pressure.
Her home dose of metoprolol was added back to her medications as well.
#) PPX: patient was placed on heparin SC for DVT ppx, bowel regimen, H2 blocker for GI ppx but she will be discharged on her home prilosec.
