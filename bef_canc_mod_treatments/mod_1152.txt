[**12-7**] MR Abdomen 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 YO F with multiple medical problems recently including AAA [**6-17**] c/b pancreatitis, right nephrectomy and cystecomy with ilealconduit in [**9-17**], and MI s/p cardiac stenting in [**10-18**] initially admitted to the MICU with pancreatitis and ARF.
Surgery was consulted, but deferred surgical management pending clinical decline.
Pt was treated with NPO and copious resuscitation via IVF per routine, and was advanced as tolerated over the course of her stay.
In setting of chronic HTN, pt will need continued f/u for possible underlying chronic renal disease, but her ARF was largely prerenal based on post-resuscitative improvement.
Pt was maintained on PPI, HCTs were rechecked and were stable, and stools were guiac negative for the remainder of her course.
Central line and blood cultures grew multi-resistant coag negative staph sensative to vanc; PICC was placed under IR for long-term vanc (at least 2 weeks) given bacteremia and AAA vascular graft.
Pt's other cultures remained negative, she responded well to vanc (afebrile, normotensive), and was discharged with IV vanc with close PCP f/u and weekly BUN/Cr and trough checks.
C-Diff Positive Stool - pt was asymptomatic with normal WBC and was afebrile when test posted as positive; pt began oral vanc and will continue as outpatient with close PCP f/u.
HTN - when NPO, utilized IV metoprolol and hydralazine for control; once ARF resolved and tolerating po's, continued oral lopressor, avapro, hydralazine with moderate success.
