Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80 year-old male with coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary emboli, multiple severe GI bleeds in the setting of anticoagulation for above, S/P IVC filter placement, S/P NSTEMI, S/P intubation for respiratory failure(pneumonia, COPD, etc.
For his respiratory failure, he required a course of steroids for COPD and for PNA, multiple courses of antibiotics, most recently on linezolid and meropenem for Multidrug-resistant Klebsiella (to complete course on [**2107-3-20**]).
Patient also developed line infection with coagulase negative Staph bacteremia on [**2107-2-20**], and was treated by removing line and Vancomycin course.
Infections were complicated by intermittent septic shock which temporarily required vasopressors and IV fluid resuscitation.
His multiple episodes of septic shock complicated by acute oliguric/anuric renal failure with resultant volume overload, that was intermittently responsive to vasopressors as well  He was unable to wean from ventilator so tracheostomy/PEG were placed.
The patient subsequently developed ventilator associated pneumonia, for which he is on his current antibiotic course (Linezolid and Meropenem until [**3-20**]).
It was agreed that the following would no longer be pursued: vasopressors and fluid boluses for hypotension/oliguria, renal replacement therapy (either CVVHD or intermittent HD) for his anuric renal failure, anticoagulation for stroke/CAD/atrial fibrillation.
While hospitalized, patient continued to accumulate substantial amounts of fluid due to exogenous administration for hypotension in setting of hypoalbuminemia and renal failure, which led to marked anasarca, and marked amount of pain related to the oedema and the skin ulcerations.
For this reason, his pain medication regimen was uptitrated to oxycodone via G-tube 15mg q6 hours, fentanyl patch (absorption probably variable given oedema), and intermittent IV morphine 2-4mg.
Due to continued deterioration, he was made comfort measures only and expired on [**2107-3-20**].
