The patient was managed conservatively with IV antibiotics (Vanc, Zosyn), and his fistula fitted with an ostomy appliance.
On [**5-18**], PICC line was placed and patient was started on TPN for bowel rest.
The patient was continued on IV antibiotics per ID, TPN and IV fluids.
On [**5-31**] patient went in OR, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, complex lysis of adhesions, exploration of the right colon with drainage of mesenteric micro perforation, irrigation and drainage of the colocutaneous fistula and diverting loop ileostomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
He received 1 unit of RBC and 750 mg of albumin, the patient was hemodynamically stable.
[**6-1**]: worsening tachycardia (ST to 150-160) and hypotension, fever spike (102), given 1L fluid bolus, neo gtt restarted, repeat Hct sent (27->24), given 1 unit PRBCs; neo gtt able to be weaned [**6-2**]: Persistent tachycardia (120s) Received 500ml albumin & 1u pRBC w/o change in heart rate.
[**6-3**]: Persistent tachy (100's), received 5mg metoprolol IV.
Fluconazole was changed to Micafungin to treat [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
[**6-7**]: Afebrile, fiber added to the tube feed secondary to persistent diarrhea.
[**6-8**]: Stable, screened for Rehab [**6-15**]: Discharged in Rehab By system: Neuro: The patient received PO oxycodone with good effect and adequate pain control.
Post op patient was started on Dilaudid PCA, which was weaned off.
This was managed with IV Lopressor, and was thought to be related to his underlying infectious process.
The patient's hypotension was treated with pRBC, albumin and fluid boluses.
Prior discharge, patient was started on PO Lopressor.
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially placed NPO due to his noted stool output from his left flank wound, which previously was suspicious for a fistula but was found not to be so on fistulogram during his previous hospitalization.
He was fitted with an ostomy appliance, and provided TPN given his decreased oral intake.
The TPN was weaned off on [**6-7**] as fistula output subsided, and patient was started on tube feeds.
His wound culture, however, was noted to grow Klebsiella and E coli which were resistant to Zosyn, which was discontinued;he was previously discharged on daptomycin and Zosyn for known VRE in his abdominal collections, and this was modified to include these antibiotics as well as Flagyl per ID recommendations.
The ID followed the patient during hospitalization, his current list of antibiotics included Ciprofloxacin, Flagyl and Daptomycin.
He received Fluconazole for positive [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] infection, which was changed to Micafungin on [**6-7**].
The VRE sensitivity test came back resistant to Daptomycin and antibiotic was discontinued.
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly in both his sliding scale and through his TPN.
The patient also received 2 units of plasma and 6 vials of albumin during hospitalization.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
The patient was tolerating some intake of a regular diet with Tube feeds supplementation, ambulating with some assistance, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled with oral agents.
