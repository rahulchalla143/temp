Per her daughter she has had chronic diarrhea with C diff alternately on and off flagyl or vanco, and has had some abdominal pain at her J tube site since it was placed.
Goal of care is for pt to eventually go home, at this time the family is not thinking with hospice but rather with home nursing.
Urine, blood and sputum cultures were sent and the patient was given vanco, levo, and flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
The patient is not aware of her husband's diagnosis, nor that he is having surgery tomorrow, as her family does not want to upset her.

Brief Hospital Course: The pt is an 80 yo woman with a history of several strokes, dysphagia s/p GJ tube placement, laryngeal cancer s/p tracheostomy who presented from rehab after vomiting tube feeds, temperature as high as 102 and desaturation down to 88%.
The pt was started on Levofloxacin for aspiration pneumonia, in the setting of an episode of vomiting.
She was maintained on an oral Vancomycin dose given CT evidence of focal wall thickening at junction of sigmoid and descending colon and the pt's history of recurrent Cdiff.
Thus her antibiotic regimen was changed to Bactrim.
The pt's hypoxia gradually resolved with frequent suctioning.
FEVER: The pt was noted to have fever and an elevated white cell count in the setting of sputum and urine cultures that were positive for Ecoli (resistant to Levaquin bt sensitive to Bactrim).
The pt's foley was replaced and her antibiotic regimen was changed to Bactrim DS; she will need to complete a 14 day course of this antibiotic.
The pt had been started on oral Vancomycin for (presumed) Flagyl-resistant Cdifficile.
However, two sets of stool were negative for Cdiff.
The pt did complete her 10 day course of PO Vancomycin while in the hospital.
The pt was started on octreotide and tinctiure of opium that were held during the hospitalization, given possible Cdiff and propensity towards toxic megacolon if given antidiarrheals.
The pt's rash was treated with topical clotrimazole cream perirectally.
A rectal tube was place to allow the perirectal area to heal, this tube should be removed once the pt's diarrhea resolves.
She will need to have her INR checked daily with uptitration of her Coumadin dose at the rehab.
POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA: The pt was maintained on her out-patient dose of Prednisone for PMR.
FEN: Thept was maintained on her outpatient regimen of tube feeds.
