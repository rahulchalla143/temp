The patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after placement of endobronchial Y stent on [**2157-6-13**], discharged to rehab, then transferred back to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-4**] for worsening dyspnea and audible stridorous respirations.
The patient underwent removal of Y-stent and placement of a new longer stent reaching up into cervical trachea.
She remained stridorous and wheezy, making her a poor candidate for surgical intervention as the cause of these paroxysms are less likely to be associated with tracheobronchomalacia in the absence of improvement with stent placement.
She was started on mucomyst therapy, continued albuterol, ipratropium, mucinex, hypertonic saline nebulizer treatments, and BiPAP, and was able subsequently to tolerate the stent with no subsequent episodes concerning for mucous plugging.
ENT was consulted for evaluation of potential vocal cord dysfunction as etiology of symptoms, and found no evidence to support this diagnosis.
She represented today as an outpatient for stent removal.
She received 10 IV dexamethasone and transferred to the MICU.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 13143**],  You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] for removal of a Y-stent placed earlier this month to treat your laryngotracheomalacia.
The removal was complicated by larygospasm, a tightening of the throat that can occur during procedures involving the airway, which required intubation and respiratory support in the medical intensive care unit after the procedure.
At the time of your transfer your no longer required oxygen at all times.
