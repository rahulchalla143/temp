He was treated for COPD exacerbation and CHF with steroids, nebs and lasix.
He was not discharged on lasix but had been on it during a previous admission.
He was recently prescribed Relexa as a sustritute for nitroglycerin and he may have taken both.
He had shortness of breath after going to the bathroom and took a nebulizer treatment as well as ativan.
He arrived in the [**Hospital3 **] ED nonverbal requiring intubation on arrival.
He was given Etomidate and succinylcholine for intubation, ativan 1mg IV x 2, then ativan 2mg IV.
He was given combivent MDI via ETT, IV morphine gtt for management of agitation and discomfort and Lasix 20mg IV x 1.
After discussion with the [**Hospital3 **] ICU and cardiology teams, the decision was made to transfer him to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management of his critical AS and respiratory failure.
Of note, his wife states that he was intubated 3 times during his prior admission.
She does not have his medication list on discharge from [**Hospital3 **].
In the ED, he was given vancomycin and zosyn for possible PNA.
He was started on fentanyl and versed for sedation.
He had a small PTX after central line placement which resolved by x-ray.
He had a blood transfusion for a HCT of 25 which was complicated by respiratory failure requiring intubation and ?TRALI but was extubated within 24 hours.
Per the discharge summary he was briefly on antibiotics for bilateral infiltrates but these were stopped when the infiltrates resolved.
He was discharged on a prednisone taper 60mg daily with a decrease by 5mg every 2 days.

RESISTANCE 838   FICK **VALVULAR STENOSIS AORTIC VALVE GRADIENT {mmHg} 33.23 AORTIC VALVE AREA {sq-cm} 0.99  **PTCA RESULTS   AORTIC BALLOON VALVULOPLASTY  PTCA COMMENTS: Initial baseline studies confirmed severe aortic stenosis with a  calculated valve area of 0.8mm2.
Heparin was started prophylactically and a therapeutic ACT was confirmed.
A 5 French balloon tipped transvenous pacing catheter was then postitioned in the RV apex.
With moderate difficulty, the aortic valve was crossed using a straight 0.035in wire through a 4 French [**Doctor Last Name **]-1 catheter.
The catheter was exchanged over a J wire for a 4 French Pigtail catheter and a gradient was measured.
The pigtail catheter was then exchanged out for an Amplatz Super Stiff wire.
During transient rapid ventricular pacing, aortic balloon valvuloplasty was performed using a 22mm x 6cm Tyshak II balloon.
After bedside transthoracic echocardiography was performed and documented mild aortic regurgitation, aortic balloon valvuloplasty was repeated with the same balloon.
Successful aortic balloon valvuloplasty unsing a 22mm x 6cm Tyshak II balloon.
Following aortic balloon valvuloplasty, the mean gradient was  reduced to 15mmHg and the calculated valve area increased to 1.2cm2.
Successful aortic balloon valvuloplasty x 2.
In the interval, the nasogastric tube and the endotracheal tube have been removed.
He underwent a balloon valvuloplasty on [**2142-3-29**] which resulted in mean gradient reduction to 15mmHg and the calculated valve area increased to 1.2cm2 from 0.8cm2.
He tolerated the procedure well and had no compliations associated with the procedure.
For heart failure, he was diuresed with lasix IV boluses with good effect.
For COPD, he was started on IV solumedrol, which was soon changed to oral prednisone.
He was discharged with a prescription for a rapid prednisone taper.
# Hypotension: The patient transiently required vasopressor support for hypotension in the Emergency Department.
