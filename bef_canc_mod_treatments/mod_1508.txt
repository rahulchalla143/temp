Next AM patient developed hypotension to 60s/30s while at HD, as well as dizziness and mental status changes that did not initially resolve with fluid bolus; HD stopped, patient given 2 units of pRBCs w resolution of pressures to 100s .
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - ESRD [**3-15**] interstitial nephritis  versus post-infectious glomerulonephritis s/p allograft ([**2138**]), c/b failure ([**2156**]), HD dependent - Secondary hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcemia.
-  GERD w Barrett's esophagus ([**2152**]) - Peripheral vascular disease - Colonic polyps - Prostate adenocarcinoma ([**2156-5-12**]) s/p CyberKnife therapy - s/p appendectomy.
Family History: Mother with CABG at 60.
Father with CABG at 70.
Brother with CAD status post PCI in 62.
Hemodialysis post-procedure.
Ongoing optimal medical therapy for CAD and CHF.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 63M with ESRD on HD, CAD s/p CABG ([**2156**] - LIMA to LAD, SVG to RPDA, SVG to OM1, SVG to ramus), sCHF (EF 20-30%) admitted after elective PCI c/b inability to  Circ, psuedoaneurysm, and hypotension in the setting of HD who experienced in-hospital Vfib arrest greater than 48 hours after NSTEMI.
# NSTEMI/VFib Cardiac Arrest In-Hospital: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for elective cardiac catheterization for optimization of cardiac function in preparation for possible renal transplant.
During the procedure he was noted to have severe native vessel disease, 2 patent grafts (LIMA-LAD, SVG-RI), and one occluded graft (SVG-OM).
During the procedure OM1 was successfully stented with BMS x 2, but there was an unsuccessful attempt to revascularize AV groove LCx.
Following the procedure the patient developed chest pain with ST depressions in II/III/aVF and positive CKMB and troponins (CKMB peak of 24.1).
On arrival to the CCU he was continued no aspirin, plavix, heparin drip, abciximab, and atorvastatin.
Five days following this patient's NSTEMI, he experienced a VT -> Vfib arrest (caught on telemetry) and was rapidly coded receiving chest compressions and defibrillator shocks with rapid ROSC.
He was transferred back to the CCU for continued evaluation and treatment and was loaded with IV then PO amiodarone.
# Femoral Pseudoaneurysm: Following initial catheterization the patient was found to have a pseudoaneurysm reported as 1.2x1.1cm by radiology, read as 0.7cm by interventional radiology.
# Symptomatic Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive in dialysis following his initial catheterization to the 60's systolically with mild light-headedness which resolved quickly with fluids and 2 units of PRBCs.
He continued to be mildly hypotensive mostly to the high 80's-low 90's during subsequent dialysis sessions but this continued to improve until he was able to tolerate full dialysis with significant fluid removal.
It did not become apparent until just prior to discharge that this patient was previously on home oxygen for the same reason.
His home metoprolol and lisinopril were held for a period following his NSTEMI due to hypotension as above.
He was re-started on lower doses of both medications prior to discharge.
He will likely benefit from spironolactone in the future when his blood pressures are more robust.
His warfarin was held for a period of time given elevated levels and possibility of placing an ICD.
He was continued on his home warfarin dose at the time of discharge and instructed to follow-up as usual with coumadin clinic.
# ESRD s/p Kidney Transplant: Stable.
He will need continue dialysis and prednisone QOD as an outpatient.
Continued on home omeprazole.
: He will be following up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for discussion of his treatment options.
#Blood Pressure: His blood pressures have been a little soft, especially following dialysis which has caused us to lower his home BP regimen (metoprolol succinate 75mg PO daily -> metoprolol succinate 25mg PO daily, and lisinopril 20mg PO daily -> lisinopril 10mg PO daily).
#Atorvasatin: We have lowered his lipitor dose from 80mg PO daily -> 40mg PO daily due to the addition of amiodarone .

You had a cardiac catheterization with a placement of a bare metal stent.
We did another heart catheterization, but no further interventions were able to be made.
We performed CPR and shocked your heart three times back into a normal rhythm.
Once you recover from your heart attack, you should not be at risk for this rhythm and you may not need a internal defibrillator.
You should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as scheduled to arrange to have further studies and potential implantation of a defibrillator device at a later time.
We also started a medication called amiodarone which will help prevent this arrhythmia.
You will need to take Aspirin 325mg daily indefinitely.
You will need to take Plavix 75mg daily for minimum of one year.
Stopping these medications prematurely can put you at risk for in stent clot and subsequent heart attack.
You should NOT stop these medications unless Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] tells you otherwise.
Your kidney doctor may want to give you blood transfusions at dialysis.
The following changes have been made to your medication regimen: -START amiodarone 400mg twice a day until [**1-4**], then you should take 200 mg three times a day until [**1-11**], then you should take 200mg twice daily until [**1-18**], then you should take 200mg daily -START oxycodone 5mg every 6 hours as needed for pain.
-START docusate 1 pill twice daily as needed for constipation -START senna 1 pill as needed for constipation -START Plavix 75mg PO daily - Do NOT stop this unless Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] instructs you to!
-START Triamcinolone 0.1% cream twice daily as needed to affected areas.
-INCREASE Aspirin 325mg by mouth once daily - Do not stop this medication unless Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] instructs you otherwise!
-INCREASE Sevelamer (PhosLo) to 2400mg by mouth three times daily -DECREASE Lisinopril to 10mg once daily (this can be increased to your home dose by your primary care doctor or cardiologist) -DECREASE atorvastatin to 40 mg daily -DECREASE Metoprolol Succinate 25mg PO daily -Continue your other home medications as previously directed .
