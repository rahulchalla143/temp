Admission Date:  [**2157-6-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-6-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2094-3-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: latex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - bronchoscopy - rigid bronchoscopy with Y-stent placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 63 year old female presenting with a chief complaint of shortness of breath.
This has been worked up by various physicians who have referred her complaints to multiple diagnoses, including COPD, asthma, and most recently, tracheobronchomalacia.
In [**2157-3-2**], she underwent stent placement given TBM; between [**Month (only) 956**] and [**Month (only) 547**], she tolerated the stent with initial improvement in her breathing, however, over the last several weeks, she has started to make increasing secretions with daily cough.
In early [**Month (only) 547**], given advancing symptoms, her stent was removed and significant laryngeal edema was identified.
She was started on steroids which have been tapered over the past three weeks; she finished her steroid course 2 days ago.
She presented to [**Hospital **] clinic on morning of this admission for consideration of repeat stent placement.
However, given respiratory rate of 30, saturations near 92% on ambulation, she was sent to the ED for respiratory distress; she was started on nebulizers amd required BiPap initially.
She was started on solumedrol.
At time of transfer to the MICU, she is weaned off BiPAP and tolerating a non-rebreather with good saturations.

Surgical chain sutures also seen suggesting prior resection.
Normal postoperative appearance of left lung following subtotal resection from the lingula.
Dynamic airway maneuvers were then performed, with the following findings: proximal trachea - moderate collapse; mid-trachea - severe collapse; distal trachea - mild collapse; RMS - moderate collapse; [**Hospital1 **] - mild to moderate collapse; LMS - mild collapse.
The scope was removed, and the procedure completed.
Flexible bronchoscopy with dynamic airway maneuvers was performed today.
Rigid bronchoscopy [**2157-6-15**]: Rigid bronchoscopy and flexible bronchoscopy with deployment of Dumon Y stent for tracheobronchomalacia.
She had recently completed a steroid [**Last Name (LF) 15123**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] airway inflammation was thought to be the cause, and she was restarted on steroids again.
ENT evaluated pt with laryngoscopy and did not feel that this was consistent with vocal cord dysfunction.
# Tracheomalacia: she thus had a Y-stent placed on [**6-15**].
She required respiratory therapy to do deep nasopharyngeal suctioning [**1-31**] x/day after stent placement, and this relieved the obstruction.
She will continue on mucinex, and standing duonebs to help manage her airways.
She will need Q6H hypertonic saline.
One of these saline nebulizer treatments should be in the middle of the night (2-5am), to help deal w/ AM secretions.
She will f/u in Interventional Pulmonary clinic, to see if tracheoplasty is a viable option for her.
She will be continued on standing duonebs for now (per tracheomalacia / stent) and symbicort.
Her steroids will be tapered over 2 weeks.
Increased her citalopram to 20mg daily (from 10), and changed ativan to klonapin TID, with an additional 1mg klonapin TID PRN anxiety.
# Lasix: she is on lasix for unclear reasons.
# Hypertension - held metoprolol to see if that made any difference w/ SOB, but it did not so we restarted it .
# Hyperlipidemia - continued simvastatin .
# history of pulmonary embolus - several years ago, likely in setting of underlying malignancy, now resected, off anticoagulation .
===================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # Will f/u with IP in ~1 week for further management of her severe tracheomalacia # At discharge, she should be set up to have home suction and yankaur device at home # She will need Q6H hypertonic saline.

For this, you received a stent in your trachea.
You will need nebulizer treatments for this.
You were started on steroids, and will [**Known lastname 15123**] off of them over 2 weeks.
You will also need a saline nebulizer 4 times daily.
We have also made several changes to your medications ** START prednisone [**Known lastname 15123**] [steroid] over 2 weeks ** START guiafenesin (mucinex) [help with airway secretions] ** START hypertonic saline nebulizer.
