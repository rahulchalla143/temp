He denies any recent fevers, chills, coughing, sore throat or nasal congestion.

POST- INTERVENTION There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
Expected post-surgical appearance of the mediastinum consistent with esophagectomy and gastric pull-through.
With ultrasound guidance a pigtail catheter was successfully placed in the pericardial space and 400cc of serosangous fluid was removed.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 54 year old male with locally advanced esophageal cancer s/p chemo and radiation and more recently s/p esophagectomy who presents with progressive shortness of breath and found to have pericardial effusion and left sided pleural effusion which were drained resulting in improvement of symptoms.
Patient's shortness of breath continued despite this intervention so CTA chest was performed that demonstrated a large pericardial effusion.
He underwent c. cath on [**2112-5-23**] that demonstrated right heart filling pressures with a mean RA of 12mmHg and near equalization of diastolic pressures consistent with early tamponade physiology.
A pigtail cath was placed that drained 400cc serosangous fluid.
The drain put out an additional 270cc and no further drainage since evening.
The drain was removed on [**2112-5-24**] and the patient's respiratory status improved.
On [**2112-5-22**] patient was admitted to the thoracic surgery service where he underwent left thoracentesis yielding 1200 cc of dark serous fluid and an exudate.
Patient should follow up with his PCP in one week for BP check to determine if this medication should be restarted.
# RHYTHM: Remained in sinus rhythm with rates in the 70's-80's as monitored on telemetry.
# Esophageal CA: Patient is s/p chemo, radiation and esophagectomy.
Plan for further treatment per primary oncology team as an outpatient.
# Hypotensive Episode: A few hours following pericardial drain removal patient noted to become diaphoretic and have transient episode of hypotension to 84/51.
# HTN: Initially patient's atenolol 50mg daily was continued, however, given that his SBP's were running in the high 90's to low 100's consistently for 24 hours prior to discharge (while on the atenolol) we decided to have him stop the atenolol and follow up with his PCP within the next week for a blood pressure check.
