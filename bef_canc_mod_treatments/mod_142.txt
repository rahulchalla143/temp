Nonspecific 4-mm ground-glass nodules at the lung apices, with incompletely visualized consolidation laterally in the left upper lung, which could reflect aspiration or pneumonia.
Small region of consolidation in right middle lobe, could be contusion from chest tube insertion.
MRI Neck w/ and w/o contrast [**2157-11-28**]: FINDINGS: The patient is intubated and there is a nasogastric tube in place.
The imaged portions of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx appear grossly normal.
Chest x-ray [**2157-11-29**]: FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube sits 4 cm above the carina.
A right-sided IJ central line tip sits in the upper SVC.
The endogastric tube side port sits well below the GE junction.
Three cerclage wires project over the lower cervical spine.
Gastrograffin  swallow [**2157-11-29**]: FINDINGS: Images obtained in AP and oblique positions with patient tilted at angle of 70 degrees.
Following this, barium was utilized instead.
Video Oropharyngeal swallow [**2157-12-1**]: FINDINGS: Swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed in conjunction with the speech and swallow division.
There is mild-to-moderate intermittent aspiration with thin and nectar-thickened liquids.
A central catheter is in place.
IMPRESSION: Aspiration and penetration with thin and nectar-thickened liquids.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 y/o M with history of chronic dysphagia, presents with worsening dysphagia, stridor, and respiratory distress, on imaging found to have soft tissue infection in retropharyngeal space as well as pneumonia and R. pleural exudative effusion.
# Respiratory distress/Stridor - Patient presented with stridor, found to have upper airway edema, intubated in the ED.
Patient initially covered with Clindamycin and Levaquin.
Levaquin switched to meropenem once patient's UA showed pyuria as he has a history of resistant UTI.
A gastrograffin swallow study was performed to evaluate for potential esophageal leak, and none was found.
On discharge, patient will complete a 14 day course of Clindamycin 600mg PO q8h for the retropharyngeal space infection.
He was evaluated by speech/swallow and had a video oropharyngeal swallow study which showed aspiration and penetration with thin and nectar-thickened liquids,osteophytosis, and a small esophageal Zenker diverticulum.
Chest tube was placed and drained ~900cc exudative fluid with pH 7.1, but low amylase.
On the day of extubation, the chest tube was removed and there was no pneumothorax on chest xray.
Patient completed a course of Ceftriaxone which covers the pneumonia in house.
Patient transiently required levophed for pressure support.
Responded well to 0.5mg atropine x1, and did not need any further intervention for the remainder of hospitalization.
Warfarin held in the acute setting for potential procedures.
