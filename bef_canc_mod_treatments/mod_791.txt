STUDIES: ========= CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2140-8-25**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 11:49 a.m.: Tip of the new endotracheal tube, with the chin slightly flexed is no more than 15 mm above the carina, 2 cm below optimal placement, as reported to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 805**] by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2026**] on [**8-25**].
An ascending caval catheter ends in the low right atrium.
Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.
Nevertheless, if further evaluation is felt necessary clinically, axial and coronal-acquired 2D time-of-flight MR venography sequences could be performed, allowing each of the major venous sinuses to be imaged orthogonally, a procedure which would minimize any in-plane flow artifacts simulating thrombus.
Vasogenic and interstitial edema in a strikingly symmetric and posterior distribution involving both [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter of the occipital lobes and frontalparietal regions, bilaterally.
However, given the history of SLE, suspicion of underlying "lupus anticoagulant" and non-arterial distribution of edema and hemorrhage, cerebral venous (including dural venous sinus) thrombosis should be excluded, and urgent MRI with MRV has been recommended, below.
Continued dilantin 100 mg tid for seizure prophylaxis, and pt scheduled for follow up at neuro clinic in two weeks after discharge.
Continued po regimen of labetolol 1000 mg TID, hydralazine 75 mg PO BID (the only change in home meds), lisinopril 40 mg [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 320 mg PO daily, nicardapine 60 mg PO TID, as well as clonidine patch when transferred to the floor.
Pt achieved goal of SBPs in 150-160s on this regimen and was discharged home.
HD cath was d/c'ed.
Ideally, vancomycin would be continued for 14 days after first negative blood cultures.
Repeatedly, pt was told that vancomycin was superior to linezolid for bacteremia, but she still refused PICC.
Thus, pt started on po linezolid and discharged with linezolid.
Received one unit platelets with placement of R femoral line.
# SLE: The patient was previously treated with Cytoxan/Prednisone and on admission was on low dose prednisone.
Some residual kidney function and awaiting kidney transplantation from a relative.
HD catheter was pulled during this admission due to high grade bacteremia.
