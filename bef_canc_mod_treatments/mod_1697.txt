The significance of this finding is uncertain; this may be relate to technical reasons, seizures, propofol administration, or other inflammatory/infective etiology.
IV contrast could not been administered due to low EGFR.
EEG: [**Date range (1) 80477**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG, due the presence of an unreactive, mixed [**3-29**] Hz theta frequency and [**1-27**] Hz delta frequency background, with significant voltage suppression.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 M with cryptogenic cirrhosis s/p OLTx on [**9-/2184**] p/w altered mental status with a clinical diagnosis of PRES, who is status post intubatation for airway protection who was discharged home in stable condition.

Also, left arm and leg weakness but normal tone (hard to assess strength with lack of cooperation with exam [**1-26**] confusion/L-neglect), hypertonicity of the Right-UE (flexed and tremulous) and hypertonicity of the Right-LE (extended and still).
Patient was then intubated for airway protection, started on Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] and admitted to CVICU (due to bed availability).
Patient was emperically started on Vancomycin, Zosyn and acyclovir.
The significance of this finding is uncertain; this may be relate to technical reasons, seizures, propofol administration, or other inflammatory/infective etiology.

There was concern for a potential seizure but no evidence of seizure activity on EEG and he was started on Keppra.
# Hypertension: He presented with high blood pressure and Amlodipine was added to his medication regiment to meet his BP goal of <140 given his diagnosis of PRES.
His Hypertensive medication regiment prior to discharge was amlodipine 10mg, metoprolol 150mg tid, HCTZ 25mg daily .
# Sinus tachycardia: He had an elevated HR that was thought to be secondary to decreased volume and delayed administration of beta blocker.
