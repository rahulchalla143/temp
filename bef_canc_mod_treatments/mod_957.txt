Arrived from rehab   Family History: diabetes mellitus   Physical Exam: PEX on day of discharge: V: HR 70 BP 112/50 RR 14 O2 99% RA Gen: NAD, lying in bed, comfortable, conversant HEENT: O/P clear Neck: supple CV: RRR, III/VI systolic murmur at apex Pulm: clear anteriorally Abd: soft, NT.ND Ext: left BKA, necrotic toes of right.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 yo M with metastatic calciphylaxis and ESRD s/p kidney transplant on chronic immunosuppressive therapy admitted with fevers and hypotension.
Was placed on broad spectrum Abx including Vancomycin/Meropenem/Fluconazole to cover both bacterial and fungal sources.
No bacterial source was ever isolated despite multiple urine, sputum and blood cultures.
His Meropenem was d/c'ed on [**10-11**] and then Vancomycin was removed on [**10-14**].
His fluconazole was to continue for a 2 week course to end on [**2172-10-22**] .
Thought secondary to his narcotics given that Morphine/Oxycodone are renally cleared.
He was monitored off narcotics and his MS slowly improved back to his baseline.
He was continued on Dilaudid, Neurontin, and Ibuprofen only for pain control.
Please give doses as specified in his medication planning as these prevent profound hypotension.
He was found to be volume overloaded given his need for IVF resuscitation with his hypotension.
His dialysis should be continued as per nephrology recommendations.
# Hypotension He has been intermittently hypotensive throughout his ICU stay mainly due to over-aggressive dialysis or narcotic medication administration.
His BP is difficult to measure with non-interventional means (ie BP cuff) as they are not accurate compared to when arterial line was in place.
Please hold dilaudid on the mornings of dialysis so that his blood pressure is not too low.
He should be given a dose of dilaudid right after dialysis.
Renal was involved who recommended trying IV pamidronate for experamental tx without much improvement in his symptoms.
He was on metoprolol for rate control, but given his hypotension, this was discontinued (he also had no more episodes of afib).
On chronic immunosuppressive therapy and ESRD.
When his BP stabilized, he was transitioned to HD with intermittent ultrafiltration to remove excess volume.
He was continued on prednisone 5mg daily, cinacalcet and renagel per renal recommendations.
No DVT ppx given poor skin (avoid Hep SC and pneumoboots), PPI.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Altered MS/confusion due to iatrogenic narcotic overdose Fever/Hypotension Dyspnea due to volume overload ESRD on CRRT/HD Necrotic skin wounds  Secondary Diagnoses: Hypotension ESRD on HD Metastatic Calciphylaxsis   Discharge Condition: Stable to be discharged to rehab   Discharge Instructions: Please follow up with his nephrologist after you are discharged from the hospital.
Do NOT give any opioid pain medications that are renally cleared (morphine, Oxydodone, percocet, vicodin, Oxycontin) as these made him quite confused.
You may use Dilaudid only for pain control (and acetaminophen and ibuprofen).
Please hold dilaudid on the mornings of dialysis so that his blood pressure is not too low.
He can be given acetaminophen and ibuprofen on those mornings.
He should be given a dose of dilaudid right after dialysis.
He should NOT receive any skin biopsies, suturing, or subcutaneous injections of any kind (including Heparin SQ) as these make his calciphylaxsis worsen.
His foley catheter should NOT be removed for concern over his necrotic skin.
This can decrease with narcotic medications - please monitor his mental status rather than just the BP as it measures inappropriately low in his arm.
Also consider checking the BP above the AV fistual (non-functional fistula) for better readings.
