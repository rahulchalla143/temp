Admission Date:  [**2161-10-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-11-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-6-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: ORTHOPAEDICS  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Ciprofloxacin / Nystatin / Erythromycin Base / Aspirin / Epinephrine / Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14197**] Chief Complaint: right thigh wound infection  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**10-21**], [**10-23**], [**10-25**], [**10-27**], and [**10-28**]: irrigation and debridement of wound and placement/change of vac dressing starting with [**10-23**] procedure [**11-11**]: removal of allograft prosthetic composite and placement of antibiotic cement coated unipolar spacer   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 72-year-old woman who underwent resection of an osteosarcoma of her right proximal femur approximately 3 weeks prior to admission and was reconstructed with an allograft prosthetic component.
Past Medical History: osteosarcoma right proximal femur hypomagnesemia hypokalemia status post right colectomy hypertension H. pylori osteoporosis thalassemia minor paroxysmal atrial tachycardia hepatic hemangioma parathyroid adenoma Grave's Disease  PSH: right proximal femur resection with APC reconstruction [**2160**] partial colectomy [**2160**] partial thyroidectomy [**2157**] parathyroid adenomectomy TAH [**2136**]   Social History: lives alone, avid ballroom dancer and walker denies alcohol denies tobacco   Family History: Brother with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer  Physical Exam: Patient presented with erythema surrounding her wound and drainage from the wound.
We held her coumadin and started her on lovenox post-operatively.
The wound continued to improve in appearance with vac therapy and subsequent debridement.
Following an ID consult the patient was started on linezolid due to her multiple antibiotic allergies.
As a result, she underwent a successful vancomycin desensitization and has had no difficulty with vancomycin.
We discussed the option of keeping the APC in place with further IV antibiotic treatment, and the patient decided she would prefer to undergo surgery rather than spend six weeks undergoing antibiotic therapy with no guarantee of resolution of the infection.
She was taken to the OR on [**11-11**] for removal of the APC and placement of a unipolar spacer coated with antibiotic cement.
She required blood transfusions following this surgery, and her hematocrit stabilized.
She was discharged to rehab on long-term vancomycin per ID.
