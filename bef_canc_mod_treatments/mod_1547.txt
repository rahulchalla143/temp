She was dischared to LTAC on [**6-25**] and was being actively diuresed there with 40mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **] and having received an additional 40mg IV on [**6-30**] for dyspnea associated with e/o CHF on CXR.
Given her hypotension, cultures were drawn and broad spectrum antibiotics initiated.
A femoral line was placed (given elevated INR and trach).
ECG showed a paced rhythm at 80 with LVH and <[**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V3-V6.
She reports that the only significant change was realtively aggressive diuresis with IV lasix over the past day and transfusion of 1 unit pRBCs for anemia with additional lasix.
Underwent CABG on [**2164-4-18**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to RCA and SVG to OM.
Pt transferred to CVICU post-procedure with course complicated by a right-sided pleural effusion requiring a thoracentesis and complete reexpansion of her right lung, multiple pneumothoraces and subcutaneous emphysema requiring reintubation, and intermittent episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation alternating with periods of junctional rhythm requiring pacemarker placement.
Patient was discharged to rehab and was readmitted on [**6-11**] with loculated left sided pleural effusion requiring left thoracotomy and decortication with hospital course complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure thought secondary to pneumonia now s/p percutaneous tracheostomy tube and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
Her active problems there included: --hypokelmia --loose stools on vanc po, cdiff pending --anxiety on ativan prn --supratherapeutic INR, coumadin held --Anemia: ob + stool --metabolic alkalosis --delerium, improved on haldol --respiratory failure with complicated pleural effusions, CXR with bilateral fibrosis, effusions --systolic CHF on aldactone, metoprolol, amio reduced and lopressor increased on [**6-29**] --candidiasis with catheter tip positive on fluconazole --anasarca, albumin 1.8 .

Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo F with recent AFib, CABG in [**Month (only) 958**], s/p trach and PEG secondary to repeated respiratory failure, presented on [**6-30**] s/p pulseless arrest, course complicated by klebsiella and pseudomonas pneumonia.
She was started broadly on VAP protocol with vancomycin/zosyn/tobramycin.
Tobramycin was discontinued and she was switched to meropenem 2 g every 8 hours, infused over 3 hours, for pseudomonas and klebsiella pneumonia.
However, the final recommendation was to switch patient back to meropenem and resend doripenem sensitivities.
If the MIC of doripenem is less than the MIC of meropenem ( less than 8), we recommend that [**Hospital 100**] Rehab switch back to doripenem 1 g every 8 hours infused over 4 hours for the same 14 day duration.
Day 1 of antibiotics was [**7-6**] for a total 14 day course.
*Continue antibiotics up to and including [**2164-7-19**] *Will need to conitnue Flagyl for C.Diff prophylaxis per below.
She alternated between pressure support and trach collar, progressively spending more time on trach collar.
She usually rests on the vent overnight; however, on final night in the hospital, she was able to stay off the ventilator and maintained adequate respiratory status on the trach collar.
*Continue intermittent pressure support for respiratory assitance.
This nausea was controlled with zofran 8 mg PO every 8 hours.
We recommend that [**Hospital1 100**] Rehan hold all nonessential medications (multivitamins, vitamin supplementation) in the short term, and then restart slowly.
She was continued on Albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
Device not placed and pacer remained.
She was continued on amiodarone.

Following this date, PO vancomycin should be discontinued if there are no signs of symptoms of a C. diff infection.
Required IV lasix for several days for pulmonary edema.
Once patient euvolemic, she was switched to her home dose Lasix 40mg PO once a day.
