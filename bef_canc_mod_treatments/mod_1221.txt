Vanc and Zosyn were initially started, then coverage was broadened to Vanco, Zosyn, Cipro and Caspofungin.
Patient was continued on coumadin.
However, he had a long history of weight loss and poor PO intake (had required feeding tube for several months after [**Female First Name (un) **]) and was thought to also have some underlying depression.
Given that he was on the [**Female First Name (un) **] list, feeding tube was considered however patient had refused initially at admission and then was transplanted.
He was maintained on TPN post [**Female First Name (un) **] and was using PO supplements with good tolerance and was encouraged to use the supplements at home following discharge.
He received routine induction immunosuppression to include Cellcept, solumedrol with prednisone taper and Prograf restarted on the evening of the [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The broad coverage with antibiotics was continued with patient receiving 12 days of Vanco, 15 days of Cipro, 19 days of Zosyn and 14 days of Caspo which was then converted to PO fluconazole.
On POD 6 his coumadin was restarted.
The lateral drain was removed on POD 3.
The medial drain was noted to be becoming more bilious in nature and he was having increased abdominal pain and an elevation in his WBC.
An ERCP was attempted and extravasation of contrast was noted at the duct to duct anastamosis and a stent was placed.
However, it was determined that he was going to require Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and was taken back to the OR with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He did well following the surgery but was continued on the TPN until he was able to start tolerating liquids and started supplements.
He was still refusing Dobhoff tube placement and instead wanted to eat and use supplements.
On POD 13/3 he was switched to oral Fluconazole off the Caspofungin with appropriate adjustment in the Prograf dosing.
ID recommended changing to Ceftrixone and getting him off the other antibiotics and keeping him on the antibiotic until the second JP drain was removed.
That drain continued with about 1 Liter output daily, but remained serous, so it was decided to remove the drain and suture.
His Coumadin was managed, INRs followed daily.
