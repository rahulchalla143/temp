Endotracheal tube tip in the right mainstem bronchus, recommended withdrawing approximately 5 cm.
CXR ([**11-18**]): Endotracheal tube has been pulled back in the interval, and is now approximately 4 cm from the carina, in appropriate position.
Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the expected position of the diaphragm; however, distal aspect is not fully included on the image.
Left-sided triple lead pacer device is unchanged in position change given change in patient position.
There is increased right lower lobe opacity, suggesting increase in small right pleural effusion seen on prior CT, although underlying consolidation not excluded.
There is preservation of the cervical lordosis.
She was on propofol on arrival to the ICU, which was held to reassess mental status.
She became agitated but did not open eyes or follow commands, so was kept on propofol overnight.
Next am, she was much more alert off the drip and was extubated.
Her C-spine was kept in a C-collar, but remained tender after extubation.
Her benzos were held until HD5 and she was restarted on oxycodone with close monitoring for sedation.
This was felt to be [**2-22**] a cognitive decline as opposed to encephalopathy.
No fever, leukocytosis, O2 requirement, or sx suggesting pneumonia, so antibiotics were held.
Patient is on anticoagulation and initially had a R main stem intubation, so hemothorax possible; her hct decreased initially, but then remained stable.
EKG showing only paced rhythm and unable to assess symptoms while intubated.
Thought to be due to fluid overload given that patient was receiving IVF boluses for reduced urine output.
Improved with lasix (patient put out 2 L) and termination of IV fluids.
Thought likely to hypovolemia as patient responded to 500 cc IV boluses with subsequent increase in UOP.
Coumadin was withheld and PO vitamin K given.
Patient was dc'd on home dose of warfarin and scheduled for PCP f/u day after admission for management of anticoagulation therapy (pt also has VNA that routinely draws her INR).
Resolved with IVF and holding HCTZ on admission.
Hypertension: Initially kept on carvedilol and held HCTZ/valsartan/spironolactone with good BP control.
Patient gradually restarted on home medications (spirinolactone -> HCTZ -> valsartan) with good control of blood pressure on discharge.
Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has been adequately rate-controlled on home medication without issue(carvedilol 25mg daily) with HR ranging from 50-70.
Patient also on coumadin during stay, excluding period when patient had supratherapeutic INR.
Patient will have home PT to further evaluate and treat this issue.
