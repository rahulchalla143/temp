Stable 5.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm sac, status post endovascular repair.
After 2L of NS in ED his blood pressure increased to the 110s.
Acute MI was ruled out with CE flat x3 (though troponin 0.14 0.12 in setting of ARF)  He was not given any further fluid but transfused 3 units of PRBCs.

Coumadin was not restarted given head laceration and high risk of fall.
