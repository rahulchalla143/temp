Most likely cause is post-renal obstructive, in the context of rising creatinine since recent radical surgery, that may have altered his anatatomy in a way that predisposed him to developing obstruction.
A L percutaneous nephrostomy was placed under IR on [**8-6**] and follow-up u/s done on [**8-12**] showed almost complete resolution of hydronephrosis on the L.  His creatinine trended down during the admission and on discharge, was 2.6.
He maintained good urine output through the nephrostomy and urostomy and had no electrolyte shifts from post-obstructive diuresis.
He will be discharged with nephrostomy in place and will f/u with urology and nephrology regarding how long the nephrostomy should be kept in place vs. possibility of needing ureteral stent for stricture.
He was initially treated empirically with daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole, and micafungin but this was narrowed to fluconazole only when sensitivities for his [**Female First Name (un) **] returned and given continued negative blood cultures.
Towards the end of his stay, his WBC rose (detailed below) thus UA and UCtx were obtained from his nephrostomy and urostomy.
However, given his increasing white count, there was suspicion that these fluid collections may have become infected.
The patient underwent IR sampling of the fluid collections on [**8-13**] which returned as gram stain negative, cultures pending.
Colorectal surgery will be calling him to follow-up with this.
No further episodes, never required any medications for this.
Tbili, LDH, and haptoglobin were not consistent with hemolysis.
