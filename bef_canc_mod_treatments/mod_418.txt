Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations Rifampin          should not be used alone for therapy.
Limited examination secondary to lack of intravenous contrast and opacification of small bowel with oral contrast.
Lack of intravenous contrast, limits sensitivity for the detection of a small intra-abdominal abscess.
Patient admitted to the medical ICU and insulin drip initiated.
Patient eventually transitioned to Lantus and Humalog sliding scale.
Given significant renal failure patient's insulin regimen has required close monitoring and daily adjustments.
Please monitor blood glucose carefully and adjust both lantus and humalog as needed.
2) Respiratory Failure: Pt found unresponsive at home and intubated at OSH and remained intubated when transferred to the MICU.
Determined to have sputum cultures positive for MRSA and treated for multifocal pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn.
He was transferred to the medical floor on 2-3L of oxygen via nasal cannula and O2 sats have beens stable around 94-96%.
Description of penumonia treatment regimen listed below.
Would suggest continuing to wean oxygen as tolerated.
Metabolic significantly improved with resolution of DKA as well as treatment pneumonia.
He was followed by the renal service who also recommended oral bicarbonate which was discontinued when bicarbonate corrected and renal function improved.
Continue to renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
Patient started on Vancomycin/Zosyn.
As noted abovePatient will need a total of 14 day course of this antibiotic combination since his last negative sputum cx ([**2128-1-19**]).Last dose on [**2128-2-1**].
Vancomycin dosed q48 given GFR of 11 at time of discharge.
We do not think this is infectious, likely side effect from antibiotic side effect.
However, we have treated him empirically for cdiff with metronidazole.
6) Anemia: Found to be anemic to 23 and required 1 unit PRBC during this admission.
Pain has been managed with fentanyl patches and IV morphine.
He should be con on his outpt dose of Neurontin 300 mg TID.
Given patient's questionable hx of substance abuse suggest trying to wean down morphine as tolerated.
Please note he was on percocet 5/325mg [**1-23**] QDailyPRN prior to admission.
We have started him on lasix 20 mg daily.
10) Depression: Pt continued on his lexapro.
