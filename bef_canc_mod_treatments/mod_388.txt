Suggestion of a schatzki's ring although a barium tablet was not administered per request of speech and swallow pathologist.
However since patient had witness seizures in the hospital it was decided to load patient with Dilantin which was then transitioned to Keppra.
She was briefly intubated for airway protection but was quickly extubated once her mental status improved.
She was started on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**2193-3-8**], this should be increased to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**2193-3-14**] and the dilantin should be decreased to 200mg daily.
On [**2193-3-20**] Dilantin should be decreased to 100mg daily and then stopped on [**2193-3-27**].
She was breifly on pressors for blood pressure support but this was stopped as patient was treated with antibiotics.
She was initially treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime for empiric coverage.
The vancomycin was discontinued and the ceftaz was continued which should be completed on [**2193-3-13**].
She had a PICC line that was removed upon admission.
A new PICC line was placed on [**2193-3-7**] once patient was being treated for infection and no longer had fevers.
She was put on loppressor 10mg IV q4 as patient was not taking PO meds.
Once patient able to take PO meds her IV lopressor was stopped and she was given PO metoprolol.

While she was unable to take PO medication she was put on levothyroxine 100mcg IV which was then switched back to Levoxyl 150mcg [**Hospital1 **] when she was again able to take PO meds.
Her TFTs were monitored as there was concern that she would require more levothyroxine since she was started on Dilantin.
However now that she is being transitioned to Keppra she will most likely remain on Levoxyl 150mcg [**Hospital1 **].
Coumadin was held as patient's INR supratheraputic.
Her INR should be checked regularly and once < 2 her coumadin should be restarted with careful monitoring while still on dilantin.
