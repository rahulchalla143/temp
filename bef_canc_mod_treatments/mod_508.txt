Brief Hospital Course: The patient was taken to the OR for a completion colectomy with j-pouch ileorectal anastomosis for [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome.
He initially tolerated the procedure well.
#Atrial Fibrillation: On POD#3, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, after having missed a dose of his metoprolol; this resolved with iv metoprolol, and his po metoprolol was re-dosed to TID to provide better control.
The next day, he went into afib again, and was rate controlled with iv metoprolol; by this time, the patient was having nausea and emesis with gastric distension likely secondary to ileus, and it was thought that his PO metoprolol was not being absorbed.
By POD#5, after continued afib with occasional tachycardia to the 130s, it was decided to transfer the patient to the ICU for rate control with esmolol and diltiazem drips.
He was started on a heparin gtt in preparation for possible cardioversion.
He underwent cardioversion on [**2116-5-15**].
He will be continued on an amiodarone taper until he follows up with his outpatient cardiologist.

The patient is status-post renal [**Last Name (un) **], and he was maintained on his cellcept, cyclosporin, and prednisone in consultation with the nephrology [**Last Name (un) **] service.
His doses were adjusted appropriately per his cyclosporin levels, and the routes of administration appropriately changed when his diet order was changed to NPO: when NPO, his prednisone was changed to iv methylprednisolone, his cellcept changed to IV, and his cyclosporin was given as a liquid through the NGT.
Potentially nephrotoxic home medications (allopurinol, furosemide, and lisinopril) were held.
GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient was NPO following his procedure.
Beginning POD#3, the patient had liquid bowel movements with some expected dark clots.
