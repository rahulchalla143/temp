Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]M with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, mechanical aortic valve on coumadin and recurrent GIB and admissions for anemia presenting from rehab with anemia.
He has had work up in past including colonoscopy and capsule endoscopy without finding source of bleed.
Other possible etiologies of his HCT drop are recurrent autoimmune or mechanical hemolysis, but this seems unlikely with LDH and bilirubin nl range.
Coumadin was held, a small dose of Vitamin K was given, and the patient was transfused with 3 units of RBCs.
There was no concern for ACS given nl EKG and No concern for PNA clinically or on CXR.
This is likely due to coumadin dosing.
Per discussion above, was given Vitamin K 0.5 mg PO x1 on admission.
Coumadin was held on admission due to supratherapeutic INR; he was discharged with INR 2.1 and 2mg coumdin daily.
# GERD: Patient was on PPI drip here but discharged on home omeprazole dose of 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
Held carvedilol in  setting of GIB and stable blood pressures during admission but resumed home dose of medications prior to discharge.
