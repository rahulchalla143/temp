In addition, Mr. [**Known lastname 108684**] beta blocker was discontinued as uptitration of it was thought to exacerbate his wheezing.
Hemodialysis was initiated.
The patient was diuresed to a net negative fluid balance of ~10 L on HD with significant improvement in wheezing/decreased O2 saturations/rhonchi after dialysis.
Pulmonary was consulted and there was no indication for an antiviral medication for RSV.
Bactrim was continued for prophylaxis.
END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE ON HEMODIALYSIS See above.
Failed cadaveric renal transplant in [**2109**], initiated on hemodialysis on this admission with successful placement of tunneled line on this admission.
For renal transplant, continued low dose prednisone, and cyclosporine was decreased to 25 mg daily.
He was maintained on a fluid restricted diet.
He was scheduled for a vascular surgery appointment as an outpatient for fistula placement.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion and re-presented in atrial fibrillation in the setting of metabolic derangements and fluid overload.
Home betablocker was discontined (due to persistent wheezing), and diltiazem was provided for rate control.
In the future if respiratory distress deemed not to be related, beta blocker may provide more cardiac benefit and also does not have cross reaction with cyclosporin; defer to outpatient PCP.
Per ther recs: outpatient cardiology f/u in [**2-11**] weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] for outpatient cardioversion once respiratory status improves.
