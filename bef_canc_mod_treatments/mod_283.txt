Past Medical History: -CAD s/p CABG in [**2156**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-D1, SVG-ramus, SVG-PDA) PACING/ICD: -Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation -AICD place in [**2151**] after an episode of VFib arrest -Recently admitted to CCU for recurrent ventricular tachycardia successfully terminated by ICD; started on amiodarone - chronic renal insufficiency (baseline Cr 1.3) - AAA s/p endovascular repair in [**2163**] - s/p cholecysectomy - s/p TURP - chronic anemia (early myelodysplasia), s/p 2 units of pRBC about 2 months ago  Social History: -Live with wife.
Biosense mapping of the LV performed, after the administration of IV heparin, via a retrograde aortic approach using a long sF sheath.
Extensive mapping of the LV and an area with a mid-diastolic potential and perfect entrainment was found in the basal region of the LV at 4-5 oclock on the mitral annulus.
Ablation was performed in that area and resulted in termination of the VT.  A total of 3 RF applications were performed.
Post ablation repeat EPS with double VES were delivered without induction of VT .
Conclusion: Successful ablation of V-tach from basal left ventricle  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 89 year old gentleman with PMH significant for HTN, dyslipidemia, CAD s/p CABG in [**2156**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-D1, SVG-ramus, SVG-PDA), remote history of VF arrest in [**2151**] s/p AICD, hospitalization in CCU in [**7-/2167**], [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] [**8-/2167**] due to multiple AICD firings, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin, history of endovascular AAA repair who presented to [**Hospital6 17032**] earlier this AM after his ICD fired 8 times due to Monomorphic VT 120s, now s/p ablation.
