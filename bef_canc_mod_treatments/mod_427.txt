PORTABLE CXR FINDINGS: Compared with [**2178-12-19**], there has been interval placement of a single lead right ventricular pacemaker from a left subclavian approach.
PA/LATERAL CXR Single lead of the pacemaker projects over the right ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 76 year-old male with history of chronic Atrial Fibrillation, CAD s/p CABG [**2168**], CHF (EF 30%), and COPD who presented with progressive dyspnea.
DYSPNEA/CONDUCTION ABNORMALITIES Patient was initially thought to have COPD flare vs. CHF exacerbation, and was treated with Levaquin and diuretics in the ED.
Patient was defibrillated immediately with restoration of baseline rhythm, and transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring.
Given supratherapeutic INR in the 40s, temporary lead wires were not placed.
He was started on a dopamine drip which did not improve cardiac function - HR remained in low 30s, with resultant hypotension.
Patient was then switched to Isopril gtt with good effect.
Once COPD exacerbation and supratherapeutic INR were adequately dealt with, patient received single chamber [**Company 1543**] VVI pacer.
Patient tolerated procedure well.
Post-pacer interrogation was successful, and CXR confirmed proper lead placement.
Regarding his COPD flare, patient's outpatient medications were restored and he was started on a short 5-day prednisone taper, with improvement in lung function.
Supratherapeutic INR Etiology unclear, as patient reportedly stopped taking his Coumadin 1 week prior to presentation.
Patient received several units of FFP and SC Vitamin K, with normalization of INR after 24 hours.
Coumadin was held.
CAD Given bradycardia impairing blood pressure control, patient's Lisinopril was held until after pacemaker insertion.
Outpatient Lisinopril was then resumed.
Anemia Hct stable, at baseline on discharge.
