HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department, the patient became hypotensive, 87/40 with continued fevers to 102 and received 7 liters of normal saline and was placed on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl in the Emergency Department.
The lumbar puncture was performed in the Emergency Room and during this lumbar puncture he became dyspneic complaining of neck swelling, throat closure and was taken to the Operating Room for emergency intubation which was unsuccessful secondary to questionable airway edema and emergently had his old closed tracheostomy sites accessed by endotracheal tube and was admitted to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit.
His Medicine Intensive Care Unit course was notable for ventilator support until [**5-6**] when Otorhinolaryngology changed the endotracheal tube to a tracheostomy and the patient weaned to a tracheostomy mask.
Pressure support was continued with Neo-Synephrine.
The patient continued to be treated on Vancomycin, Clindamycin, Levofloxacin for presumed postoperative otorhinolaryngology infection, however, blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid cultures from admission remained negative and computerized tomography scans of the neck and chest did not reveal any abscesses.
Vascular Surgery consults suggested likely extraluminal hematoma.
Right Port-A-Cath was removed on [**5-4**] without complications.
On [**5-3**] he was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells due to a hematocrit of 23 and bloody airway secretions and on [**5-7**] was transferred to the floor where he remains hemodynamically stable and successfully weaned to a tracheostomy mask on [**5-6**].
He continued to have secretions around the tracheostomy and will continue on antibiotics for a total of ten days.
