However, there is an apparent inferior and medial left orbital blow out fracture, of uncertain chronicity.
ET tube in standard placement, nasogastric tube ends in the distal stomach.
Loculated-appearing right pleural effusion, with subsegmental atelectasis.
Satisfactory position of IVC filter, right PICC line, and gastrostomy tube.
The telemetry during these recordings was obscurred given significant lead artifact.
Automated and routine sampling also was showed significant slowing predominantly over the left central and parietal leads, consistent with a focal area of subcortical dysfunction and potential seizure focus.
A gastrostomy tube is noted in the right upper quadrant.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted on [**2181-1-8**] after being found on his porch with an unwitnessed seizure with bowel and bladder incontinence.
He was given ativan 2 mg IV x2 and 30-40 of diazepam IV.
He was given Ativan 2mg IV x2.
He was started on Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (?
He had another episode of "tonic UE and eye rolling" on [**1-9**] or [**1-10**], for which he was given Ativan 2 mg IM with ressolution in 10 minutes.
He was also treated with Valium CIWA.
He was not anticoagulated given suspicion that clots were chronic.
He had recurrent seizures on the floor treated with IV ativan.
They were initially concerned for seizure, and gave him Ativan 1 mg IM x2.
No further intervention needed at this time as at least >5 days out from injury and no evidence of decreased eye ROM, impingement of EOM, or other concerning findings.
He was also maintained on keppra.
He had recurrent seizures despite therapeutic dilantin levels.
Of note, he was strictly NPO after his PEG tube was placed so his po dilantin was changed to fosphenytoin.
However, once his tube was ready for use he was changed back to oral dilantin.
He is currently on Keppra 2g [**Hospital1 **], Phenytoin 200mg TID, Zonegran 200mg/500mg, and Trileptal 1200mg [**Hospital1 **] plus standing Ativan but continues to have intermittent clinical seizures responsive to 2mg to 6mg of IV Ativan or 10mg IM Diazepam.
After PEG placement can discontinue LUE restraint.
Initially required 1:1 sitter but able to be safe with bed alarm only.
He was initially treated with heparin but due to difficult blood draws this was transitioned to lovenox.
Lovenox was transitioned back to heparin for 24 hrs for PEG tube placement and he was restarted on lovenox 4 hours after tube placement.
Given suspected hypercoaguable state, he will likely require lifelong anticoagulation.
However, due to extremely difficult blood draws and poor access, the decision was made to continue long term lovenox therapy.
He was started on calcium and vitamin D for osteoporosis prophylaxis given suspected lifelong LMWH requirements.
If worsening density despite calcium and vitamin D, could consider addition of bisphosphonate or transition from lovenox to fondaparinox or coumadin.
He has an infrarenal IVC filter in place which was old, likely placed for chronic LE clots.
PULMONARY  In the setting of acute ICH and status epilepticus, he had an aspiration pna s/p multiple intubations and multiple central line attempts without success.
He is s/p CT x 3.
Last CT was removed [**1-19**] without evidence of recurrent pneumothorax on repeat CXRs.
He was treated with 10 days of clindamycin and 8 days of vancomycin for presumed aspiration pna.
He was maintained on anticoagulation as above.
GASTROENTEROLOGY:  A PEG tube was placed for nutrition and medication administration.
He was started on tube feeds per nutrition recs.
As mental status improved, he passed a swallow evaluation for a modified diet with supervision.
He still receives cycled nutrition via PEG overnight.
IV ACCESS:  Patient had L midline which was changed to R PICC at the time of PEG placement by IR.
This PICC fell out on [**2-25**], requiring replacement in IR.
PICC line was subsequently discontinued prior to discharge as antiepileptic levels and labs had been within normal limits and stable.
He had family consent for all procedures through his sister, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4882**] (sister) (w)[**Telephone/Fax (1) 12803**], (c)[**Telephone/Fax (1) 12804**], (h)[**Telephone/Fax (1) 12805**].
