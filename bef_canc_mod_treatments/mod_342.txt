Following catheterization, the patient was referred for surgical intervention with the Cardiothoracic team at [**Hospital6 1760**].
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  The past surgical history revealed cholecystectomy, cystography, trigger finger release, PTCA, tonsillectomy, testicle removal, and nasal septoplasty.
PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol 2 puffs b.i.d., Lovenox 3 mg subq.
following the discontinuation of his Coumadin which he had been taking for atrial fibrillation, Lipitor 10 mg q.d., Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg q.d., Prilosec 40 mg q.d., multivitamin, folate, thiamine, and Nicoderm patch.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service on [**2117-6-21**], following cardiac catheterization and placement of intra-aortic balloon pump.
The patient also had mitral valve replacement with a 31 mm St. Jude's valve.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in a stable condition.
Weans were begun on the intra-aortic balloon pump and the ventilator.
The patient was afterwards paced but a strip of several seconds was obtained which showed complete absence of P waves, absent QRS, and absent pacer spiking.
Electrophysiology consult was obtained at this time and the patient was increased on the V lead sensitivity to improve the pacing of the patient's heart rate and anticoagulation was done for the patient's persistent atrial fibrillation.
On postoperative day #2, the patient's intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued and the patient tolerated this well.
The patient's Amiodarone was converted to 200 mg p.o.
The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2117-6-25**] and continued to do well on the floor.
The patient was placed on Heparin drip for anticoagulation while Coumadin was held pending possible placement of pacemaker.
The patient also had some brief episodes of nausea during the day on [**2117-6-28**] which responded well to Zofran medication.
He was given Thorazine for hiccups and had slow advancement of diet.
The patient was seen by the EP Service and was felt to be ready for DC cardioversion and placement of pacemaker.
The patient had a urinalysis which showed 11 white blood cells in the urine and subsequently the patient was started on Ciprofloxacin for possible urinary tract infection.
It was felt at this time the patient was stable for transfer to the Electrophysiology Service for DC cardioversion and placement of pacemaker.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Reglan 10 mg p.o.
t.i.d., Ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o.

4-6 hours p.r.n., Colace 100 mg p.o.
