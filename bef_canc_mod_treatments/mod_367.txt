Admission Date:  [**2164-5-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2164-6-18**]   Service:  General Surgery  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient presents with ileostomy status post total colectomy and ileostomy for diverticulosis in [**2163-10-2**] with recurrent episodes of small bowel obstruction after surgery.
Briefly, the patient was an 84-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding in the past and also a total colectomy ileostomy for diverticulosis in [**2163-10-2**].
The patient was admitted on [**5-23**] in transfer from ............... Hospital for evaluation of abdominal plane, melena and clots from his ileostomy.
The patient developed a gram positive cocci bacteremia initially at presentation and was started on intravenous vancomycin for a moderately elevated white count and temperatures.
It was felt that the patient was a very high surgical risk at this time and therefore no surgical approach was offered.
The patient was followed peripherally by general surgery over the following two weeks.
The patient showed evidence of small bowel obstruction, was made NPO and started upon total peripheral nutrition.
The patient required nasogastric tube with significant amounts of drainage, as well as decreased stool output through his ostomy bag.
Over time, the patient's obstruction appeared to open up with decreased nasogastric tube output and increased ostomy output.
The patient became nauseated and required the replacement of the nasogastric tube.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**6-10**] and underwent a closed loop ileostomy and small bowel resection which he tolerated quite well.
The patient was placed on an epidural catheter for pain control postoperatively.
Intraoperatively, an adhesive band with chronically dilated small bowel was noted proximal to the previous repair of an enterotomy (which had incurred during a previous ex-lap), as well as finding a minor peristomal hernia.
The patient was initially confused for the first few days postoperatively secondary to his significant surgical procedure and medication usage.
The patient was restarted on his TPN and was given both Protonix and Zantac for ulcer prophylaxis.
Postoperatively, the patient completed a full seven day course of vancomycin for his confirmed line sepsis.
The patient also completed the 14 day course of Flagyl and azithromycin.
He also completed a course of acyclovir before the operation.
