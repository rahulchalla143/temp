History of Present Illness: 64-year-old male with a past medical history of hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma who is status post liver transplantation on [**2145-12-7**].
He was treated with Infergen and ribavirin, but this was discontinued as the patient developed seizures on this therapy.
The switch to rapamycin was also done due to the fact that he had hepatocellular carcinoma, and evidence has demonstrated reduced recurrence of HCC in patients on rapamycin therapy.
He was therefore treated with Solu-Medrol 500 mg daily for three days and then discharged on oral prednisone.
He currently takes prednisone 20 mg daily.
His rapamycin levels at that time were elevated at 27.3, and therefore this medication was held.
Upon discharge, he was told to have his rapamycin levels checked on the 29th and then to restart this medication on the 29th after getting his levels checked.
A rapamycin level was drawn: 18.2 on [**10-20**] with plan for followup [**2146-10-26**].
However, he notes that his BM have not changed in frequency or consistency recently- instead he has had diarrhea since starting on an extensive course of liver medications, including bactrim for prophyolaxis while on sirolimus and prednisone taper.
He was started on PO vanc for presumptive C diff, and was given 1 mg Rapamycin per GI recs.
Had been stable on Wellbutrin and Lithium since [**29**] and 93 respectively, except for during a trial of IFN therapy in [**2138**] where hospitalization was required.
Developed hepatic encephalopathy in [**2142**] requiring hospitalization at [**Hospital1 2025**], started on lactulose with good effect.
Past treatments include peg interferon and ribavirin in [**2139**].
These meds were discontinued due to suicidal ideation.
- HCC: Recently noted 1.4 cm enhancing lesion on liver imaging, proved to be small, well-differentialed HCC on bx in [**9-26**] s/p cadaveric liver transplantation on [**11-28**] (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**]) - Hypothyroidism.

Interval removal of CBD stent without intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Otherwise normal post-[**Date Range **] cholngiogram A 11cm by 10FR biliary stent was placed successfully across the anastamosis [stent placement].
Recommendations: If the LFTs improve following stent placement, balloon dilation of the anastamosis could be performed in 1 month.
If the LFTs fail to improve following stent placement, we will remove the stent in 1 month.
Further management as per hepatology service.
Moderate portal/periportal, and mild lobular mixed inflammation including lymphocytes, plasma cells, occasional neutrophils, and eosinophils.
Trichrome stain shows increased portal fibrosis with septa formation and focal minimal sinusoidal fibrosis (stage 2).
Brief Hospital Course: 64-year-old male with a past medical history of hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma who is status post liver transplantation on [**2145-12-7**] and presents with fevers at home and diarrhea.
# Fevers (MICU added course, primary team please update): There was concern for C.diff in the ED given diarrhea with fevers; treatment was started with PO Vancomycin.
He was subsequently transferred to the MICU for closer hemodynamic monitoring in setting of GI bleeding for which colonoscopy indicated a bleeding at his sphincterotomy with hemostasis acheived.
He received 4 units of pRBC total.
He received another unit PRBC that night, continued to have maroon stools and w/ continued low Hct's.
Had positive tagged RBC scan, then went to angio on [**11-6**], but unable to localize on arteriogram so transferred to [**Month/Year (2) **] surgery service in case surgery indicated.
Had episode of ACR s/p steroids and re-bx confirming no evidence of rejection.
The patient was continued on home med of Rapamune 1 daily and MMF 500 [**Hospital1 **] was started by floor team.
His levels were followed and re-dose as appropriate .
# Hypothyroidism: Continued Synthroid  The following is a brief summary of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course while on the [**Hospital 1326**] Surgery Service beginning [**11-7**]:  The patient was taken to the operating room for massive melena s/p [**Month/Year (2) **] sphincterotomy on [**2146-11-7**].
They recommended Zyprexa at night and good sleep hygiene which were followed.
His NGT was discontinued on POD3, and the patient was started on a clear liquid diet.
He was started on Ceftriaxone (later converted to PO Keflex) on POD 3 for erythema around his incision site.
At this time his course was notable for persistent serous drainage in his JP bulb, close to ~500cc a day.
By POD 8 the patient's pain was well controlled with oral medication, and was eating and voiding with no difficulty.
He was discharged on a 7 day course of keflex for management of his wound incision.
His JP drain was left in, and the patient had VNA services arranged to help with it's care and output recording.
Lastly, the patient was given a 5 day course of oral lasix to aid with his lower extremity edema.
Of note, the liver biopsy performed during his operation was notable for recurrent HCV as well as acute rejection.
His rapamycin was transitioned to prograf in the interest of better wound healing, and his levels were aimed at slightly higher values.
