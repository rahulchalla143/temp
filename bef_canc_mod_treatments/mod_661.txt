The patient was initially diagnosed with meningioma [**2183**] when she presented with L vision changes.
She underwent a resection in [**2183**], then a repeat [**2194-1-16**] for enlargement.
She was discharged on Keppra 500 mg for prophylaxis and a dex taper.
The patient went to sleep, and the patient's mother checked on her with a flashlight every few hours- she would reply that she was awake and she was OK.

HYPERVENTILATION: Hyperventilation could not be performed due to history of intracranial mass.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There are 224 automated spike detections predominantly for electrode and movement artifact.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There are no automated spike detections predominantly for electrode and movement artifact.
Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound Report [**2194-1-23**] TCD Results: Transcranial doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed with insonation of the left middle cerebral artery at a depth of 67mm and at 56mm.
The patient was receiving phenylephrine at 1mcg/min for two minutes.
Then the phenylephrine dose was decreased to 0.5 mcg/min for ten minutes.
For the next ten minutes, phenylephrine drip was turned off.
Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound Report [**2194-1-24**] TCD Results: Transcranial doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed with insonation of the left middle cerebral artery for 32 minutes at a depth of 63mm.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 yo RHW with HTN and recently s/p re-resection of large tuberculum sellae meningioma [**1-16**], with silent L basal ganglia infarct noted on post-op MRI, and presented on [**2194-1-20**] with a 2 hr episode of R weakness and speech difficulties [**1-19**] that resolved after 2 hours and was taken to hospital the following morning.
MRI showed scattered recent left frontal craniotomy with interval reduction of left frontal subdural fluid collection, evolution of scattered infarcts involving the left basal ganglia, inferior and lateral frontal, and left temporal lobes with an increase in the size of the left frontal lobe and most significantly a high-grade stenosis at the proximal aspect of the left M1 segment with small caliber of the more distal branches on MRA.
She was therefore started on IV heparin and started on concomitant warfarin.
Stroke risk factors were assessed with HbA1c 5.3%, FLP Chol 192 TGCs 125 HDL 58, LDL 109.
Concern was for hypoperfusion given her very significant left MCA stenosis and stat CT-head showed no new infarct and EEG bedside monitoring showed pronounced left hemisphere slowing but no seizures which could be compatible with hypoperfusion.
She was initially trialled on the floor and latterly stepdown unit with aggressive IVF resuscitation but her SBP was only maintained in 120s and deemed not sufficient to maintain perfusion, with persistence albeit with some improvement of her symptoms she was transferred to the ICU on [**2194-1-22**] for initiation of pressors.
In the ICU she was continued on pressors and had a PICC line inserted, which kept her SBP in the 130-140's.
We then weaned her off the pressors, and her neurological exam remained stable.
It was determined that she also had a UTI, so she was started on ceftriaxone and treated for 3 days.
She was started on fludrocortisone to help maintain her BPs with an oral medication and lisinopril was stopped and given patient stability, she was able to be transferred back to the floor on [**2194-1-24**].
Endocrinology felt this was not concerning and was likely due to her concomitant dexamethasone administration and did not require further evaluation.
Pituitary hormone panel with FSH, LH, TSH and prolactin were all entirely normal.
While on the floor, Keppra was tapered and stopped and dexamethasone taper was completed and stopped prior to discharge.
Therefore, her left MCA high-grade stenosis was felt likely secondary to a dissection at the time of surgery which would also account for her prior infarcts in this region.
She was started on fludrocortisone as above due to relative hypotension to aid in left MCA perfusion.
Due to continued mild aphasia persistent at the time of discharge and only obvious on probing (poor ability to name animals as described) she was discharged home on [**2194-1-26**] with outpatient speech therapy and neurology stroke follow-up in addition to her planned neuro-oncology follow-up.
PICC line was removed on discharge.
Patient was therefore discharged on warfarin which will be managed by her PCP and had instructions to have her INR drawn on [**2194-1-27**].

Outpatient Speech/Swallowing Therapy Patient requires outpatient speech therapy   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Likely left middle cerebral artery dissection likely traumatic at the time of surgery with resultant high-grade stenosis and prior left MCA distribution embolic infarcts Relative hypotension and started on fludrocortisone to aid in left MCA perfusion  Secondary diagnosis: Urinary tract infection   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent but still word-finding difficulties which are relatively mild Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Neurologic: A+Ox3 but mild aphasia with poor naming (only 6 animals and 3 words beginning with F) and difficulty with the finer details in conversation.
As a result, you were started on IV heparin which is a blood thinner in addition to warfarin to stop blood clots forming at the site of this dissection and causing further strokes.
The heparin was stopped when the warfarin level was therapeutic.
You were briefly transferred to the ICU and treated with IV medications to maintain higher blood pressures after a further episode of word-finding difficulty and this improved and we were then able to be transfer you back to the floor.
You had a PICC line inserted which was subsequently removed.
In order to improve blood flow to the left side of your brain, given this narrowing in the blood vessel, we started you on a medication to increase the blood pressure called fludrocortisone.
The continued need for this medication will be assessed at the time of follow-up.
You have been started on a medication called warfarin (as above) which is a blood thinner and as a result, the major side-effect is bleeding.
Warfarin requires close monitoring and therefore you should have your labs taken tomorrow and regularly after this as your PCP will have to let you know about any need for a dose change.
You also had evidence of a urinary tract infection which was treated with 3 days of IV antibiotics.
Medication changes: We STARTED warfarin 5mg daily - as above please have your INR drawn tomorrow We STARTED fludrocortisone 0.1mg daily We STOPPED dexamethasone as you have now finished your taper We STOPPED keppra We STOPPED lisinopril to allow for higer blood pressures given your brain artery narrowing  Followup Instructions: Given that we started you on warfarin you should have your warfarin level (INR) taken tomorrow and checked by your PCP as your dose may need to be changed.
