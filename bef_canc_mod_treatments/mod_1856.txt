His altered mental status may be postictal, from his hemorrhage, due to the enormous dose of Ativan he received while in ED, or due to ongoing non-convulsive seizure activity.

Neurosurgery evaluated patient and imaging and deemed the patient's cervical spine stable for removal of the cervical collar placed upon arrival to the emergency department.
The patient received Ativan in the emergency department and also during his imaging studies on the day of admission and his diminished mental status could be secondary to this medication combined with his series of seizures.
