Pericardial reconstruction with CorMatrix pericardial closure device, reference number [**Serial Number 42232**], lot number [**Serial Number 101279**].
History of Present Illness: 64 year old female with a PMH of ESRD [**2-21**] IgA nephropathy, a-fib/flutter (on coumadin in the past, recently being held for hx of septic emboli), MSSA bacteremia/endocarditis in [**9-/2198**] and hypertension who was brought in from dialysis with a chief complaint of chest tightness x 1 hour and shortness of breath for 1 day.

She is known to cardiac surgery and being evaluated for a mitral valve replacement.

She was taken to the operating room where she underwent a mitral valve replacement using an on-x mechanical valve.
Hemodialysis was initiated for volume removal.
Anti-coagulation was initiated with Warfarin for the mechanical Mitral Valve.
Transplant surgery was consulted to evaluate the left upper extremity AV fistula as the possible source of bacteremia.
She was given FFP and Coumadin doses were very carefully titrated.
The patient received a PICC on [**2198-12-10**] for continued IV antibiotic therapy.
The patient converted to Sinus Rhythm with IV Amiodarone and IV Lopressor.
Amiodarone was discontinued for prolonged QTC.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD #13 the patient remained deconditioned ambulating short distances with assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
