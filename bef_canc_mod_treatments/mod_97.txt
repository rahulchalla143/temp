The patient is status post median sternotomy.

Microbiology [**2154-11-9**] 10:19PM URINE Streptococcus pneumoniae Antigen Detection-PND [**2154-11-12**] 2:27PM C. Diff Toxin A & B Negative [**2154-11-10**] Urine Legionella Negative x 2 [**2154-11-9**] : Bld Cultures x 2 negative, pending final results DIRECT [**2154-11-10**]: Influenza DFA A&B negative  ### Pending studies: URINE Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen   Brief Hospital Course: 85-year-old female with chronic diastolic congestive heart failure along with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p CABGx3, history of PE in setting of immobility, and multiple recent orthopedic procedures that presents with fever, hypotension requiring massive fluid resuscitation and pressor support thought to be secondary to septic process and decreased PO intake, resolved altered mental status, and infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia that is improving clinically.
She was admitted to the ICU and was briefly on pressors for a day, she did not require intubation.
She was treated empirically on Zosyn, Vancomycin and Azithromycin.
On the floor her antibiotic regimen was further tapered down to Zosyn, Vancomycin given her recent hospitalization and stay in rehab.
She has been written for a total treatment course of 8 days.
Her last day of antibiotics will be on [**2154-11-15**].
# Hypotension: In the ED Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was noted to be in septic shock and required 7L of normal saline for fluid resuscitation as well as Levophed for approximately 24 hours in the ICU.
Her cortisol level was 5.81 in the ICU but did not require steroids for adrenal insufficiency.
Given her recent hospital course and antibiotic coverage a C. Diff toxin was sent and was ultimately negative, she also had no evidence of fevers or leukocytosis.
She was started on Maalox for her diarrhea.
Her diarrhea may be related to her antibiotic regimen, specifically Zosyn given its 8-11% association with diarrhea.
Recommend continuing Maalox for now, if the diarrhea persists would recommend recheck a C. Diff toxin as well as a complete blood count to check for leukocytosis.
- recommend continuing Maalox for diarrhea - recommend rechecking C. Diff toxin assay, complete blood count for leukocytosis if diarrhea is persistent .
Acute renal failure: Patient had creatinine of 2 on admission with baseline around 1 consistent with pre-renal acute renal given responsive to fluids and FeUREA of 25 %.
She will need to have a Creatinine check on [**2154-11-15**] to ensure she remains close to her baseline especially as her furosemide regimen will be restarted.
- recommend check a repeat BUN, Creatinine on [**2154-11-15**] to ensure Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] renal function remains stable and close to her baseline - would restart her home dose of Furosemide 20mg on [**2154-11-14**] .
Her INR was reversed with PO vitamin K and 3 units of FFP with a subsequent nadir to 1.2 in the ICU given the Hgb drop and concern for a possible bleed.
With her hgb remaining stable she was restarted on Coumadin and bridged on a heparin gtt.
Would redose Coumadin based on INR goal.
- Recommend continuing Heparin bridge until Coumadin is therapeutic .
She has remained asymptomatic, her Metoprolol was increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
The patient also had a CT abdomen/pelvis which did not show any retroperitoneal bleed, this was checked as she had a femoral line placed for her septic shock.
