Adequate positioning of endotracheal and nasogastric tube, though the ETT cuff is overinflated.
Hyperinflation of the endotracheal tube cuff, with a slightly low position of the endotracheal tube.
Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, though should be advanced for optimal positioning.
[**10-8**] CHEST RADIOGRAPH: IMPRESSION: Esophageal tube has been removed.
Right internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC.
The patient underwent broad spectrum treatment for pneumonia, thoracentesis, and once hemodynamically stable was diuresed allowing extubation on [**2164-10-7**].
He initially intermittently required norepeinephrine but this was stopped on [**2164-10-5**] and pressors were not restarted.
3) Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient was started on vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and azithromycin on presentation for broad empiric coverage of health care associated pneumonia (as he came from a facility).
The patient received five days of azithromycin and a total of eight days of vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole for empiric coverage of pneumonia.
Prior to admission, pt was on lasix 80 mg daily, which we stopped on discharge because he appeared to be euvolemic both by exam and on chest xray and will follow up to determine further need for lasix as outpatient.
His beta blocker was held due to hypotension so he was amiodarone loaded to try and achieve better rate control with good effect.
After hypotension resolved his beta blocker was restarted with good effect.
6) Hypertension: As sepsis resolved the patient become somewhat hypertensive so after being restarted on his home metoprolol he was also started on captopril, which was then switched to lisinopril for easier dosing with good control of blood pressure.
Lisinopril was stopped on transfer to the floor in the setting of elevated creatinine, with systolic BP 110s-120s.
