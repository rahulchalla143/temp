Admission Date:  [**2166-4-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-4-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-10-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: Cough and Malaise  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar Puncture Bone Marrow Biopsy Bronchoscopy with Bronchoalveolar Lavage Hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: 60 M with a history of Hepatitis C, HIV (last CD4 of 137 on [**2166-3-18**]) brought to the ED by his friends after the patient had been complaining of generalized malaise and cough x 1 week, as well as diffuse joint pains.
On ROS, the patient denied any fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, back pain, dysuria, dysphagia, or odynophagia.
At that time, the patient was admitted with acute on chronic renal insufficiency, started on hemodialysis which was continued as an outpatient, and was diagnosed with a RML/RLL PNA and completed a course of CTX/Azithromycin.
The patient's HAART therapy had been held earlier in [**Month (only) 956**] due to concern regarding potential medication related ARF, and has been on hold since.
The patient's renal function progressively declined and HD was started on [**3-20**].
Given concern for PNA with a leukocytosis and symptoms of a productive cough, and rhonchi noted on exam, the patient was given CTX and azithro for a possible CAP.
However, Abx coverage was broadened to include Vanco and Flagyl for a possible biliary source of infection after the patient was found to also have a new transaminitis.
Home ARV regimen was discontinued on [**2166-2-24**]: Atazanavir 300mg Qdaily, Ritonovir 100mg Qdaily, Truvada 1 tab qdaily, and bactrim ppx.
3) COPD 4) GI bleed/ shock [**9-22**] Workup notable for CMV esophogitis s/p valganciclovir, Cdiff positive s/p po vancomycin.
5) Blindness R eye since [**2152**], unclear etiology 6) HTN 7) Polysubstance abuse 8) Diverticulitis s/p resection [**2150**] 9) Hypoplastic L kidney 10) CRF with concern for medication induced AIN/ATN as noted above 11) Tobacco Abuse   Social History: The patient is a widower, he currently lives in [**Hospital1 392**] with his sister.
The patient reports his Sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] to be his HCP [**Name (NI) 1139**]: 2 PPD ETOH:  Reports prior heavy use, none current Illicits: History if IV Heroin and Cocaine, last documented use [**2153**]   Family History: Mother: [**Name (NI) **] CA Father: CAD  Physical Exam: VS: Afebrile 140/60 60s 95% RA GEN: Severely cachetic male with buccal lipoatrophy, awake, opens and closes eyes intermittently, oriented to person, place, year, date, month, situation HEENT: EOMI, right [**Doctor First Name 2281**] and pupil occluded with scarring, sclera anicteric, conjunctivae clear, MMM but intact, no thrush, poor dentition NECK: Supple, no JVD CV: Reg rate, normal S1, S2.

Bone Marrow [**4-9**]: Pathology - Hypercellular bone marrow with megakaryocytic hyperplasia.
Overall, diagnostic features of lymphoma are not seen.
Erythrocytes show mild anisopoikilocytosis with macrocytes, dacrocytes, and rare schistocytes.
Erythroid precursors are present with overall normoblastic maturation; forms with mild nuclear membrane irregularities, occasional asymmetric nuclear budding, as well as occasional megablastoid forms are seen.
Erythroid precursors are normal in number and exhibit megaloblastic maturation.
Marrow clot section is not submitted.
Clonality could not be reliably assessed due to non-specific staining by surface immunoglobulin antibodies (cytophilic staining pattern).
B-cells are 4% of lymphoid gated events, however B-cell clonality could not be reliably assessed due to non-specific staining of B-cells by surface immunoglobulin light chain antibodies.
Cytogenetics - KARYOTYPE: 46,XY[CP20] INTERPRETATION: No clonal cytogenetic aberrations were identified in 20 metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated  specimen.
Bronchial Washings [**4-10**]:  Bronchial lavage (right lower lobe): ATYPICAL.
BAL [**4-10**]:    Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)    (Final [**2166-4-11**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)..     FUNGAL CULTURE (Final [**2166-4-24**]):       YEAST.
Cryoglobulin   TRACE POSITIVE .
Fungitell (tm) Assay for (1,3)-B-D-Glucans   285 pg/mL   Brief Hospital Course: 60 YO M HCV, HIV (recently off ARVs w CD4s in the mid-100s), CKD on HD, admitted with joint pain, leukocytosis, new transaminitis, hypotension, and short MICU stay for hypercarbia which improved without intervention.
He was transferred to the MICU but improved prior to treatment with alternative ventilation.
Given concurrent anemia, thrombocytopenia, and worsening renal function, there was initial concern for TTP/HUS although bili and haptoglobin were normal.
Shortly after admission, he was started on his home narcotics regimen per OMR followed by the nadir of his mental status.
Once his narcotics were stopped for a short time and then re-titrated up to his home dosing schedule and he was started on antibiotics, his mental status was completely normal.
Alternative diagnoses included ITP, medication effect, and HIV induced thrombocytopenia.
Hematology was consulted and performed a bone marrow biospy with results c/w HIV associated myelopathy with megakaryocytes present in increased numbers and focally in clusters.
Although he was noted to be hypotensive early in his stay, this was likely either related to hypovolemia or SIRS phenomena in the setting of pneumonia and resolved with fluids and was not consistent with acute blood loss anemia.
Given the patient's initial hypotension and leukocytosis w CT findings suggestive of penumonia, the patient was covered broadly with meropenem, fluconazole and vancomycin for an 8 day course.
His transaminitis may have been related to a viral URI that then predisposed him to a bacterial or fungal pneumonia.
Trial of Pendamidine for PCP prophylaxis during last hospitalization not well tolerated by patient and he has not been taking PCP prophylaxis since that time.
PCP DFA from bronch was negative, G6PD was normal, and so the patient was started on dapsone for ppx during this hospitalization.
He was scheduled to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10103**] for re-initiation of ARVs as an outpatient.
Possibly related to tenofovir/bactrim as above although seems somewhat unlikely given severity requiring HD.
He was started on HD during his last admission.
The patient was continued on calcium acetate and sevelamer.
Albuterol/Atrovent nebs were given.
The patient's reported pain regimen was provided as discussed above.
On [**4-12**], the patient was hemodynamically stable, alert and oriented and with platelets trending upward.
