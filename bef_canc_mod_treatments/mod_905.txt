Respiratory failure: Patient has a history of severe COPD, O2 and steroid dependent, and presents with acute worsening SOB requiring intubation on presentation.
He was treated with both a 5 day course of tamiflu as well as Ceftriaxone and azithromycin for a possible underlying pneumonia.
He was also treated for COPD flare, as his lung exam was quite wheezy on initial presentation, so was treated with solumedrol, converted to prednisone taper, as well as combivent MDI.
Patient underwent extubation during MICU course with failure x 2, requiring re-intubation.
His BP and volume status were optimized prior to 2nd extubation, but this also faiiled due to tachypnea --> autopeep, requiring re-intubation.
His anti-anxiety regimen was also optimized as it was felt that he had a large anxiety component peri-extubation causing tachypnea --> autopeep.
He is on home 2-4L NC and prednisone 5 mg daily.
He was also started on advair 500/50 [**Hospital1 **] and spiriva.

Patient was initially started on heparin drip x 48 hrs (now off), started aspirin 325mg PO daily, plavix load given in ED then maintained on plavix 75mg daily, maintained on beta blocker and started on lipitor 80mg daily.
Felt to be due to dehydration given infection, less likely sepsis given nromal lactate in ED, also contribution of intubation/medication given peri-intubation.
