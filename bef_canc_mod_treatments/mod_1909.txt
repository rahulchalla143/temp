Her pain was controlled with morphine 2 mg IV q6h prn.
In the OR, she received a total of 600 cc NS, versed, succinylcholine, phenylephrine, metoprolol, glycopyrrolate, morphine IV (6 mg), etomidate, fentanyl (200 mcg), cisatracurium, neostigmine, dolasetron, and propofol.
* In the MICU the pt was changed from neosynephrine to levophed.
Heparin drip was started at that time.
HD terminated, and she was DCCV at 200 and 300 J.
150 mg Amio was given x 2 and she was then started on an IV drip,  She was shocked again at 300 J.
After approximately 20 minutes on amiodarone she revereted to NSR.
* Pt was transferred to the CCU on [**7-28**] b/c of hemodynamic instability during HD and continued hypotension possibly secondary to cardiogenic shock.
A subclavian line was placed and swan showed PCWP of 28, CVP 18, PAS/PAD 55/34 and Co/CI  5.2/2.65 and estimated SVR 761.
This may have been due to fluid shifts during surgery and exacerbated by HD but sepsis was also thought to be contributing since she was hypothermic, her SVR was reduced, and she developed a cellulitis over her wound on POD 7.
Since [**8-6**] vasopressin was used in the peri-HD stage to maintain her BP because of concern of possible bowel ischemia.
Two days prior to d/c, both pressors were stopped and the pt was started on midodrine (her outpt med to prevent hypotension during HD) and she tolerated HD w/out problem.
RLE tibial fracture/cellulitis:  She became febrile on [**7-25**] in the MICU and was on vanc, flagyl and cipro on admission to CCU on [**7-28**] with continued fevers.
The cipro and flagyl were stopped quickly in the CCU b/c there was no source for fevers.
During this time she was re-started on zosyn and ID was involved.
Ortho contemplated taking her to OR to clean out wound but the wound improved w/ abx therapy and the swelling slowly decreased.
She was started on morphine and tylenol after her procedure but this was noted to be sedating her and lowering her respiratory drive.
Morphine was stopped but the same problems were experienced with vicodin/gabapentin.
Her pain was better controlled using this medicine w/out sedation.
ESRD: Pt has been on HD since [**2167**] and, during this admission, had episodes of afib and hypotension during HD requiring pressor support.
After she had been weaned off the pressors during the day, she was transitioned to HD.
Initially, she required levophed pressor support during the process but this was eventually changed to vasopressin.
For the 2 days prior to d/c she was pretreated with midodrine and tolerated HD w/out the need for pressor support.
SHe was tolerating HD w/out pressor support outside of midodrine prior to callout to the floor.
Tachyarrhythmia: Pt had episodes of afib during HD requiring cardioconversion during her MICU course.
She was started on amiodarone and has remained in sinus rhythm ever since.
At this time, she was still requiring high levels of oxygen support that were eventually weaned down to 2L NC on her day of d/c.
Her narcotics were changed as above and, along w/ HD, this improved her O2 sats and subjective SOB.
The CHF improved markedly w/ HD but her effusions persisted until d/c.
Her mild coagulopathy was corrected with vitamin K and her GI bleed slowed.
Her tube feeds were stopped during this episode but were restarted following its resolution.
She tolerated 30cc/hr well and was taking pureed solids and thin liquids prior to d/c.
She again required transfusion (3u) and was taken to colonoscopy which demonstrated a 4mm sessile polyp that was not removed.
Scattered diverticula and hemorrhoids were seen.
CAD: The pt was maintained on her aspirin and statin were continued throughout her admission but her BP meds were held secondary to hypotension.
Her plavix was eventually d/c secondary to bleeding concerns.
She was taken back to the OR for removal of her internal fixation and replacement of this with external fixation rods.
She tolerated her surgery w/out event and was transfered to the SICU after the surgery.
This problem was exacerbated by the fact that her BP could only be taken on her L forearm as she had a PICC line in her R upper arm and a fistula in her L arm.
Multiple different strategies were employed to keep her BP above 85 on the floor including frequent NS boluses, PRBC transfusions, and alterations to the amount of fluid taken off during HD.
HD - Just as the patient had problems w/ hypotension during her time on the floor, her HD treatment were also limited by this factor.
The patient frequently became hypotensive to a sbp in the 60s while in the HD suite and required fluid boluses and albumin.
The possibility of peritoneal dialysis was also discussed with the family but her feeding difficulties and the possibility of placing a PEG made this an impossibility.
was intubated, epinephrine, atropine were administered and the pt.
She remained hypotensive on 3 pressors despite aggressive fluid resuscitation.
She died of respiratory failure 1 hour after extubation  Medications on Admission: 1.
