This was likely a result of your underlying lung disease and possibly exacerbated by sedating medications that you were taking.
You should avoid taking tylenol PM with seroquel.
You should use your BIPAP face mask EVERYTIME you sleep.
You are also on antibiotics for a possible pneumonia and a tapering dose of steroids (see medication list and prescriptions).
Because we are tapering them, it is best not to add more insulin at this time.
