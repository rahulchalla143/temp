Since the previous exam, the endotracheal and  right mediastinal drain have been removed.
Sternotomy wires and skin staples are again noted.
2) Normal position of NG tube and subclavian venous catheter.
[**4-28**] CXR: There has been interval placement of right-sided chest tube.
There has been interval removal of two left-sided chest tubes.
The examination is otherwise without change since the recent study a few hours earlier  [**4-30**] CXR dobhoff: Successful post-pyloric nasal intestinal feeding tube placement.
Right pleural tube is unchanged in position at the mid level of the chest.
MICROBIOLOGY:  [**4-19**] blood culture: Serratia (levofloxacin sensitive) [**4-21**] sputum: MRSA [**4-28**] urine: negative [**4-29**] c. diff: negative [**5-4**] urine: negative [**5-4**] blood culture: pending  CARDIOLOGY:  [**4-22**] Echo: .
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 79 year old gentleman with a complicated past medical history who was admitted on [**2151-4-16**] for aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis.
His operation went without complicated (please see the operative report of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2230**] for full details) and was transferred to the cardiac ICU per routine post-operatively.
He required some neosynephrine for blood pressure control in the immediate post-oeprative period.
His chest tubes were removed on post-op day 2 and he was given 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a gradually decreasing hematocrit.
After gentle diuresis he was extubated on post-op day 2.
He developed fevers on post-op day 3 and blood cultures were sent which revealed Serratia; he was started on Levofloxacin on [**4-19**] for this.
He was transferred to the floor ,however he developed severe respiratory distress requiring re-intubation on post-operative day 5.
Chest x-ray revealed significant bilateral effusions and bilateral chest tubes were placed.
At this time, cultures from his sputum revealed MRSA and he was started on vancomycin on [**4-26**].
He again required neosynephrine for blood pressure support, however this was eventually weened off with low systolic blood pressures in the 90s-100s tolerated (a cortisol stimulation test was normal).
His chest tubes were placed to water seal on [**4-28**] and subsequently removed, however he required a new right chest tube for a new-onset pneumothorax after one of his chest tubes had accidentally fallen out; this new chest tube was eventually removed with no resulting pneumothorax.
He failed a swallow evaluation and a dobhoff tube was placed for tube-feeding; he failed a repeat swallow evaluation on [**5-6**].
He had some significant diarrhea and leukocytosis on [**4-29**] and flagyl was started on [**5-1**] empirically for c.diff though cultures were negative; nonetheless his leukocytosis resolved after commencement of his flagyl and it was continued through [**5-7**].
He worked with physicaly therapy and was able to get out of bed with assistance.
Anticoagulation with coumadin was started on [**5-6**] with goal INR in the sub-therapeutic range (1.5-2.0) given his history of GI bleeding.
