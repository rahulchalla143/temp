ESRD: the pt was admitted for HD cath placement and transition to peritoneal dialysis.
On admission, his tunneled HD catheter was not functional, requiring placement of R femoral catheter that was later complicated by femoral bleed as below.
Following bleed, femoral catheter was removed and temporary HD catheter was placed.
Before d/c, peritoneal catheter was placed by the Transplant Surgery service.
CAD: he is s/p CABG in [**9-4**], w/ no evidence of active ischemia during his admission.
Treatment was continued w/ his outpt regimen of ASA, carvedilol, and lisinopril during his stay.
Coumadin was held on admission given need for PD cath placement.
After d/c, the pt will continue his usual outpt regimen and will f/u with his PCP to determine the need for resuming coumadin therapy.
There was no evidence of hemolysis given normal haptoglobin and LDH.
HCT dropped transiently to nadir of 15 in setting of femoral bleed, requiring PRBC transfusion to HCT of 27.
Treatment was started w/ epogen during HD.
The pt will continue epogen therapy after d/c.
Right femoral bleed: he had bleeding into his right thigh [**2-2**] walking to the bathroom after placement of temporary dialysis catheter in R femoral vein on [**2185-2-2**].
