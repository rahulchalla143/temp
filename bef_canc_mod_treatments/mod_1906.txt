CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
A positive result in a recently treated patient is of uncertain          significance unless the patient is currently symptomatic          (relapse).
Obtained random cortisol as pt on chronic steroids and unsure if she abruptly discontinued, within normal limits.
Monitored FS BG, labile, episodes of hypoglycemia, d/ced NPH dose and controlled on sliding scale.
Most likely mixed etiology of delirium secondary to infection with c. diff and hypoxia from OSA, pulmonary edema (volume overload) and baseline pulmonary sarcoidosis.
Encouraged CPAP machine at night and during the day with napping.
There was initial concern for pneumonia given her WBC and cough, however, the improvement of her CXR after dialysis argued against pneumonia.
She was subsequently found to have C. diff so vanco/zosyn for pneumonia were stopped and patient was started on flagyl.
ID consulted, unlikely to be truly infected, held antibiotics, until second episode of unresponsiveness on [**2109-8-19**] and restarted vancomycin and zosyn empirically.
Had drop in pressure during dialysis on [**2109-8-16**].
Held antihypertensive medications (initally admitted on quinapril, but changed to lisinopril).
Renal has made adjustments in rates during HD, and patient tolerated HD better prior to discharge.
Cortisol was wnl on random check but [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim not done and pt is on 5 mg prednisone.
Will not restart antihypertensives at this time.
Started Flagyl 500mg [**Hospital1 **] PO on [**2109-8-20**], switched to Flagyl 500mg TID IV as patient was refusing PO on [**2109-8-21**].
# ESRD on HD: patient getting HD on M, W, F at rehab facility.
Patient is due for HD on Sat this week.
Continued sevelamer and epo at dialysis.
Other etiologies included breast ca, sarcoidosis, calcium supplements, or immobility.
Patient maintained BG less than 200 on sliding scale insulin only.
Will send patient out with understanding to just monitor FS BG and adjust with SS insulin only for now, and readdress in the future with PCP.
H/O HIT per patient, not documented, heparin dependent antibodies negative.
Question of secondary to vancomycin in the past.
Held all heparin products.
Continued increased dose of synthroid at 50mcg.
Will have patient follow up with primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 6 weeks to recheck levels and adjust meds as necessary.
