# Hyponatremia- Likely secondary to poor PO intake superimposed on chronic hyponatremia in setting of cirrhosis.
She was given albumin with gradual improvement of her sodium levels.
She was treated with insulin, calcium gluconate, albuterol, and kayexelate.
Her [**Month/Day/Year **] was attributed to her recent decrease in lasix dose from 120 to 80 mg. Lasix was increased during this hospitalization to 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] and spironolactone was decreased to 100 mg daily.
She required aggressive lactulose therapy (which she had stopped at home for one week prior to admission) and was transferred to the SICU for management of hypoxia and hypothermia in the setting of encephelopathy.
Lasix was uptitrated to 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] and spironolactone was downtitrated to 100 mg daily given her [**Hospital1 **] on presentation.
A Dobhoff was placed in the post-pyloric position for tube feeds as the patient exhibited poor PO intake.
She was discharged with instructions to continue her tubefeeds.
# Pneumonia- Patient became hypoxic and hypothermic one day after admission, though she remained hemodynamically stable.
She was transferred to the SICU where she was empirically treated with zosyn for a possible pneumonia seen on CXR.
She completed 8 days of treatment with zosyn and was given albuterol, ipratroprium nebs PRN.
Infectious disease consultants recommended holding treatment for osteomyelitis given the negative biopsy results and low likelihood of osteo.
This was attributed to a pre-renal etiology in the setting of poor PO intake despite tube feeds.
Patient was given albumin and encouraged to increase PO intake.
Linezolid was discontinued after 8 days of treatment.
# Adrenal insufficiency: Patient was continued on her home prednisone 5 mg daily.
She was on stress dose steriods briefly during the time of her SICU transfer, but these were promptly discontinued as her condition quickly stabilized.
# Hip wound: s/p R hip ORIF in [**2156**], c/b multiple joint/hardware infections and sepsis, spacer inside, wound vac in place.
They recommended discontinuing the wound vac due to concern for premature closure of the wound with atypical granulation tissue (cauliflower tissue) which could potentially cause collection or abscess formation.
She was continued on her oxycodone for pain control during this hospitalization.
Her venlafaxine dose was increased from 75 to 150 mg PO BID.
Nutrition consulted and recommended Dobhoff placement with tubefeeds (isosource 1.5 tube feeds at 45 cc/hr).
She was continued on a diabetic diet and her home vitamins.
On discharge she had achieved good glucose control with glargine 20 units qHS and ISS.
Patient was continued on her home albuterol, ipratroprium, and fluticasone.
Patient d/c to home with the understanding that she will return to this medical center for further hosptial care should her condition deteriorate.

You were continued on your home medications and restarted on your lactulose and improved.
In order to ensure you received adequate nutrition, we placed a feeding tube and started giving you tubefeeds.
It is important that you continue the tube feeds at home to increase your calorie intake and build your strength.
While you were in the hospital you were seen by wound care specialists for your right hip wound- they felt that the wound vac was not appropriate for your wound and advised daily dressing changes - we advise that you continue to do this at home.
We have made the following changes to your medications: - RESTART taking your lactulose as indicated - CHANGE your dose of venlafaxine to 150 mg twice daily - CHANGE your dose of insulin glargine at night and change your sliding scale to regular insulin - CHANGE your dose of furosemide to 80 mg twice daily - CHANGE your dose of spironolactone to 100 mg daily - STOP taking magnesium  You may continue to take your other medications as you were previously.
