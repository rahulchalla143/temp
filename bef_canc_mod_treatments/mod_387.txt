[**2193-2-18**] CXR: Tip of left-sided PICC catheter within distal SVC or upper cavoatrial junction.
The catheter tip visibile in the right atrium near the tricuspid valve (contact with valve notclearly documented).
Likely due to underlying infection ([**Female First Name (un) 564**] Albicans fungemia) as she has had mental status changes in the past with infections that have resolved once her infection is treated with concern for brain lesions.
Transiently on precedex with improvement.
- Caspofungin x14 days, to end on [**2193-2-26**] - She currently has a Left arm picc.
When IV medications are complete, this should be removed.
It is strongly recommended by our ID consultants that she not have a new central line placed in the near future.
- surgery D/C'd line [**2-12**], tip culture NGTD - ophtho exam [**2-12**] showed no eye involvement - Chest CT showed multiple nodular paranchymal lesions with tiny cavitations concerning for fungal infection, inflammatory process, or metastatic thyroid CA - Pt will require repeat chest CT in 2 months time - TTE/TEE to eval for vegetation were negative .
#) UTI - Bacterial: Neurogenic bladder with intermittent catheterizations.
- changed foley on admission to ICU - Received Cefepime x 3 d given her history of UTIs with E coli and Pseudomonas that have been resistant to Bactrim and fluoroquinolones.
- Cefepime D/C'd [**2-13**] - Patient initially also given vancomycin, which was discontinued due to no bacterial infection found .
-No evidence of fungal organisms on PAS-D stain.
#) Thyroid Carcinoma: Metastatic papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy [**2165**] + XRT.
Found to have elevated thyrotropin stimulated thyroglobulin and treated with radioactive iodine in [**2189-12-27**].
- Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 574**] - Endocrine consulted - Changed from levothyroxine to levoxyl 150mcg [**Hospital1 **] (goal is suppression therapy) - TSH and free T4 were rechecked to assess trend (will require 6-8 weeks on this new regimen to reach steady state) - Outpatient endocrine follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 574**] .
#) Acute Renal Failure: -resolved after IV hydration.
- The patient is normally on hydralazine, however she has gotten in trouble in the past with concurrent titration of her pain regimen and antihypertensives at the same time.
#) Diabetes, Type 2 uncontrolled: - insulin sliding scale - Metformin 850 [**Hospital1 **] .
- Hct baseline of 30 - follow hct, transfuse 1 unit for syptomatic improvement; otherwise transfuse for Hct < 21 .
#) H/O DVT/PE: - On warfarin at home for h/o hypercoaguability and h/o DVT and PE.
- warfarin at home dose, follow INR  #) BACK PAIN - CHRONIC - We started fentanyl patch for our basal rate at 50mcg, then using morphine PCA have determined: 1. currently she requires the patch alone while sleeping (reports no pain, and used no PCA doses overnight).
Given her all her breakthrough doses have been during the day, we are adding a low dose Sustained-release Morphine at 15mg 3.
I would strongly recommend that you continue the PCA currently to capture further timing data, and that would make a very small increment in her daytime Morphine-SR doses (such as to 30 only).
I would not add any nighttime meds 4.
