During that admission her digoxin levels were noted to be 2.5 and her digoxin was held.

# Digoxin toxicity/Hypotension and bradycardia: Secondary to cardiac glycoside toxicity.
Also has been confused about medications and there for there may be some component of BB and CCB toxicity.
This is less likely however bc glucagon had little effect on her status.
She was transferred to the ICU on dopamine, but it was weaned down overnight and then stopped on HD #1.
Given her digoxin toxicity, it was decided that she should not be restarted on digoxin in the future.
When she had stabilized, she was restarted on her metoprolol at half dose of 50mg PO BID.
Her blood pressures and heart rate were stable and it was felt she was safe to be discharged on half dose metoprolol and diltiazem and her lisinopril could be restarted in the outpatient setting.
She should not be restarted on her digoxin.
It improved as she was treated for her digoxin toxicity.
As a result she may in fact turn out to be total body potassium deplete given recent diarrhea.
# Supratherapeutic INR: Likley secondary to poor adherence to medication regimen.
We held her coumadin throughout the length of her stay.
We controlled her pain effectively with oxycodone 5-10mg PO Q4-6H:PRN.
She will follow up with her PCP for further management of her pain.
# AMS: Likley secondary to digioxin toxicity.
Her confusion resolved with treatment of her digitalis toxicity.
She was not restarted on her lisinopril because her BP was controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem and given admission for hypotension, we wanted to only add on medications one at a time.
She was treated for her digitalis toxicity and all her rate control medications were initially held.
We spoke with EP and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who felt she could be rate controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem for now and he would discuss further management concerning dofetilide or AV nodal ablation in the outpatient setting.
Once her bradycardia resolved she was given metoprolol 50mg PO BID (half her home dose).
She will be discharged off her digoxin with no plan to restart.
Her metoprolol and diltiazem will be halved for now and can be increased in the outpatient setting if needed.
# DM: Held metformin and continued ISS.
Metformin was restarted at the time of discharge .
# S/P completion colectomy and end ileostomy on [**2179-6-21**] for enterocutaneous fistulae from active disease in her old colostomy: Colorectal surgery is following and did not make many recommendations.
The wound ostomy nurses would be in contact with her regarding her next visit.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Need to follow up INR and restart coumadin when between [**3-12**] - Need to restart lisinopril when indicated - Consider increase nodal agents if needed back to home doses - Will need to follow up and continue evaluate abdominal pain - She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding further management of her a-fib - Follow up with wound ostomy nurse regarding further post-op care   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
