Supratherapuetic on admit with INR to 7 after being anticoagulated for LIJ thrombosis [**9-28**] in setting of PICC line.
INR was reversed with vitamin K. Upon admit surgery was called to evaluate her and thought her to be a poor surgical candidate.
HCP [**Name (NI) **] agreed with conservative management given her high risk of perioperative mortality.
Initially thought to be septic so treated with vanc for GP bacteria and IV cipro/flagyl for GI bacteria.
Once C.dif positive, cipro was discontinued given negative repeat UA and po vanc/flagyl were continued for severe C.dif colitis.
Haldol allergy 8.
10.PICC line thrombus x3, treated.
12.Left axillary-femoral bypass with a left femoral to distal bypass on [**2129-9-18**].
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
A positive result in a recently treated patient is of uncertain          significance unless the patient is currently symptomatic          (relapse).
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 85 yo female with PVD, DM2, s/p multiple bypasses who presents with n/v/cp, found to have AAA with possible dissection and C. difficile colitis.
# Pain: Patient was tachypneic and tachycardic at times.
edema->congested on exam, given 20mg IV lasix x1, with good output.
Will discharge on morphine sulfate 1-2mg IV q6hours PRN pain.
# Left groin ulcer: S/p left femoral bypass with continued ulceration at left groin.
Vascular was consulted and followed her throughout her hospitalization recommending wound dressing changes and duration of IV antiobiotics for wound infection.
Prior to discharge PICC was placed for continued antibiotic therapy.
Was instructed to continue IV vancomycin until seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] on [**2129-11-2**] at which point he may discontinue or extend the duration of therapy.
Initially evaluated for surgery given concern for ischemic colitis, but area of involvement thought to be too extensive.
Antibiotics to be continued in rehabiliation facility for complete 14 day course.
Given no surgical intervention, patient was medically managed with blood pressure control and her Hct was followed as an inpatient.
Did not require pressors while in the MICU, and upon transfer is to the floor was hemodynamically stable.
# Coagulopathy & Left IJ Thrombus:  Previously being treated for Left IJ thrombus found on prior hospitalization [**1-7**] to PICC placement.
Warfarin held and DIC panel ordered.
Was given Vitamin K 5 mg PO x1, 5 mg SC x 1.
Anticoagulation was initially discussed in MICU with the vascular team.
However, once it was determined that no surgical intervention was indicated, the plan was to re-anticoagulate for an additional 14 days for his Left IJ thrombus given risk for PE.
Rehab instructed to monitor INR and add warfarin PRN for goal INR [**1-8**].
Was continued on humalog ISS and q6 hour fingersticks.
To be monitored in rehabiliation facility and continued on tubefeeds with flushes to maintain hydration.
# Hypernatremia:  Na up to 148 after multiple NS boluses.
Resolved with 1/2 NS fluids to correct free water deficit.
[**Month (only) 116**] consider heparin SQ once completed 2 week course of anticoagulation.
