Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: This is a 56 yo male h/o Crohn's, diverticulosis s/p hemicolectomy, with recent hospitalization for bilateral PE discharged on warfarin anticoagulation who was readmitted for lower GI bleeding.
Pt was recently admitted with a gi bleed and during admission developed pulmonary emboli necessitating intubation in the intensive care unit.
Mesalamine was increased to 2grams twice daily and prednisone 40mg was continued.
Pt was given another trial on anticoagulation and heparin was started with the hopes of bridging to coumadin.
Pt remained hemodynamically stable however had a significant drop in hematocrit necessitating one unit of packed red blood cells and transfer to the ICU.
At this time it was decided patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation until his Crohn's Flare is stabilized.
# Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli/s/p IVC filter: On admission anticoagulation was reversed given GI bleed.
After stablized anticoagulation was restarted with Heparin, however as noted above pt had further bleeding.
Pt had IVC filter placed during previous admission.
# Type 2 Diabetes, poorly controlled, no complications: Pt was continued on lantus with sliding scale insulin.
Was evaluated on [**Hospital3 4298**] and started on Citalopram and Ativan PRN anxiety.
