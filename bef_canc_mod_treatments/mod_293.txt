He is postoperative admission scheduled for a redo mitral valve replacement with a tricuspid valve replacement via a right thoracotomy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old gentleman status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2097**] and a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2109**] with complaints of shortness of breath on exertion and fatigue over the past four years which has worsened over the past year, prompting the patient to finally consent to surgery which he has been refusing for at least one year prior to this surgical date.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization done on [**7-11**] that showed left main disease with a patent right coronary artery stent a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the left circumflex; both patent.
Status post coronary artery bypass graft times two in [**2097**].
Status post colonoscopy in [**2109**].
Status post colectomy in [**2107**].
Status post radical prostatectomy in [**2108**].
Status post right urethral stent.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications prior to admission included atenolol 50 mg p.o.
q.d., aspirin 81 mg p.o.
q.d., Coumadin 2 mg p.o.
q.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o.
q.d., and Vasotec 5 mg p.o.
A colostomy bag and the ileostomy bag were both intact.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**8-9**], the patient was a direct admission to the operating room at which time he underwent a beating heart mitral valve replacement with a #27 Mosaic valve and a tricuspid valve repair with a 32-mm ring.
The patient tolerated the operation and was transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
He had propofol at 30 mcg/kg per minute, and epinephrine at 0.3 mcg/kg per minute.
He did, however, have frequent episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation; for which he was initially loaded with amiodarone and later switched to digoxin for rate control.
During the surgical repair of the patient's mitral valve and tricuspid valve repair, he received large amounts of fluid, and the first several days of the Intensive Care Unit were spent with the patient undergoing vigorous diuresis in an attempt to successfully extubate him.
On [**8-23**], the patient underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous gastric tube placement.
He had a #8 percutaneous tracheostomy placed at the bedside.
The patient tolerated that procedure well and remained in the Intensive Care Unit for the next several days; again, undergoing ventilatory wean and ramping up of the patient's tube feeds.
On [**8-29**], he underwent a right videoscopic thoracoscopy for removal of his loculated right pleural effusion.
From that time forward, the patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit with attempts being made to wean the patient from the ventilator and get him to tracheostomy collar.
The patient did tolerate ventilatory wean to a pressure support of 5 and 5 during the day, resting at night, with increased amounts of pressure support (up to 15) or intermittent mandatory volumes with a rate of 8 to 10 breaths per minute.
During this period of time, the patient was also restarted on his anticoagulation given his history of atrial fibrillation.
The patient is now postoperative day 27 from his valvular surgery and on postoperative day seven from his tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, and it was felt that he was stable and ready to be transferred to rehabilitation for continuing weaning from his ventilator.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  A review of the patient's physical examination at this time is as follows;  temperature was 99.8, heart rate was 100 in atrial fibrillation, blood pressure was 129/50, respiratory rate was 20, oxygen saturation was 100% (that was with pressure support of 10, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, and 40% FIO2).
He remained on CPAP 40%, 5 of positive end-expiratory pressure, 10 of pressure support, oxygen saturations were 96% to 100%.
Tube feeds via his gastrectomy tube at a goal rate.
He also had an intact colostomy drainage bag.
Endocrine wise, the patient was receiving sliding-scale insulin to cover blood sugars of greater than 150.
Vancomycin 1000 mg q.24h.
Fluoxetine 20 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o.
Xanax 0.25 mg p.o.
Prevacid oral solution 30 mg p.o.
Combivent 4 puffs q.6h.
Tolnaftate powder topically t.i.d.
Regular insulin sliding-scale; less than 150 use 0 units, 150 to 200 use 4 units, 201 to 250 use 7 units, 251 to 300 use 10 units, 301 to 351 use 13 units, greater than 350 use 16 units.
Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
Tube feeds via his percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube; Impact with fiber at 75 cc per hour.
Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery bypass graft times two.
Prostate cancer; status post radical prostatectomy and ileal conduit.
Colon cancer; status post colectomy and status post colonoscopy.
Status post mitral valve replacement with a #27 Mosaic valve.
Status post tricuspid valve repair with a #32 annuloplasty ring.
Status post percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement on [**8-23**].
Status post right videoscopic thoracoscopy on [**8-29**] for evacuation of a loculated pleural effusion.
Also, the patient was noted to have a positive screen during this admission, and he was treated for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his sputum.
