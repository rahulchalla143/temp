Given her creatinine increase her zaroxylyn and lasix were held for the 3 days prior to admission, with a resultant increase in weight by 3 pounds.
EMS was called and 40 mg IV lasix and nitro patch were administered.
Patient was placed on NRB and brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
She was given albuterol/atrovent NEBS and placed on BiPap, with 800 cc UOP after 40 mg more of IV lasix given (total 80 mg).
She ws also given ASA, started on a nitro drip and given IV morphine x 2 with symptomatic improvement, though she continued to require BiPap.
Also given solumedrol and levaquin for WBC 17.9.
CAD: 3VD, cath [**2128**] with 99% LAD, 90% LCx, 100% RCA stenoses.
NSTEMI [**9-11**], hospitalization complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring pressors and intubation and NSVT.
Family History: non-contributory  Pertinent Results: EKG: Sinus rhythm Long QTc interval Q's in the inferior leads consider old inferior infarct Poor R wave progression consider probable anteroseptal infarct - age undetermined Lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia Lateral ST-T wave changes less pronounced than previous  CXR [**3-10**]: The diffuse perivascular haze greater on the right than on the left has regressed since the most recent study but has not completely disappeared, indicating improved congestive heart failure.
female with history of three vessel disease (99% LAD, 90% LCx, 100% RCA), NSTEMI 8.04, CHF with EF 20%, 3+ MR, who has repeatedly refused CABG/cath, admitted for respiratory failure in setting of rising BUN/creatinine (baseline 1.2).
Pt's lasix had been held for last week or so secondary to low blood pressures.
CHF exacerbation:  Resolved with diuresis and BIPAP support, as CXR with marked improvement, diuresed to -2.5 L since admission, O2 requirement decreased to room air.
Pt improved to baseline after an hour of BIPAP and with IV Lasix.
Pt was discharged on carvedilol and Lasix.
An ACE inhibitor was held due to hypotension and history of acute renal failure while on an ACE I.  Zaroxylyn was stopped because pt responds to Lasix alone.
Pt will need daily weights and lung exams with diuresis as needed.
She was placed on IV heparin for two days and her cardiac enzymes trended down.
Acute on chronic renal failure:  Patient has chronic renal insufficiency with reported baseline creatinine of 1.2, but seems to have been between 1.3 and 1.8 on past admissions.
After diuresis and correction of CHF exacerbation, pt's creatinine on discharge was 1.3.
Renally dosed levofloxacin was started on [**2132-3-7**] for a 10 day course.
