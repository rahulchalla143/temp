The patient is a 25 yo F with post-ERCP pancreatitis transferred from an OSH for further management.
She was given pain meds and fluids at 200cc/hr, however, pt continued to complain of pain and she began to third space all fluids.
A PICC was placed for TPN and pt was on a dilaudid PCA.
The patient was transferred to MICU for further management.
Over the next two days, she received a total of 12L and her pain was controlled with 1mg of dilaudid every 3hrs.
She was given dilaudid, nebs and ativan and she improved both symptomatically and clinically.
On day of transfer, pt's HR again increased to 140 with worsening abd pain, located in RUQ associated with more SOB.
Again, the team tried nebs, ativan and dilaudid, this time with no improvement.

Pt was continued on the ventilator for 14+ days.
Slowly with extensive diuresis and recovery from her initial insult, pt's ventilator requirements decreased, and pt was transitioned to PS.
On [**8-27**], pt had a SBT that she tolerated fairly well but required more diuresis prior to her successful extubation on [**8-28**].
The patient was weaned down to 2L NC without desaturation.
Pt was placed on double pressor therapy with levophed/vasopressin along with broad spectrum Abx coverage.
Antibiotics were tailored to Levo/Amp and her pressors were discontinued after 48 hours but patient continued to spike on a daily basis despite negative cultures and therapy was broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Amp/Flagyl.
Eventually, her Abx were again narrowed to Levaquin/Ampicillin given a lack of source for her fevers and she completed a 2 week course of [**Last Name (un) **] for her e.coli bacteremia and a 10 day course of Ampicillin for her Enterococcal UTI.
On [**8-20**], blood cultures (from [**8-18**]) grew [**2-10**] coag (-) Staph; she was started on vancomycin until speciation.
Her central lines were re-sited numerous times (x3) during her MICU stay without any evidence of a central line infection.
Vancomycin was discontinued (on day 9) as a possible cause for the possible drug rash and zosyn was started for ?
Once extubated and taking PO she was switched to PO dicloxacillin for 10 day course.
She had a post-pyloric feeding tube placed to help with pancreatic rest, and TFs were initiaed.
On day of discharge, pancreatic enzymes and LFTs were normal.
* # Tachycardia: Pt with a persistant tachycardia that despite adequate fluid resuscitation did not reverse.
Initially a pleurex catheter was placed that decompressed the PTX but this had to be slightly readjusted on [**8-26**] as the PTX had reaccumulated.
The catheter was removed sucessfully on [**8-29**] without complication.
Aggressive diuresis was instituted once her BP had stabilized post-intubation and patient remained on Lasix 20mg IV tid to remove the 20+ liters that she had accumulated during her length of stay.
She is now transitioned to lasix 60mg PO tid with good effect.
Her lasix shoudl be titrated for goal I/O - 1 liter/daily and adjusted depending on clinical status.
ID was initially concerned for infectious cellulitis despite being on Vancomycin therapy and Zosyn was added for broader coverage.
She was switched to PO dicloxacillin prior to discharge.
* # FEN: Due to her being intubated in the setting of post-ERCP pancreatitis, pt was initally placed on TPN.
However, due to episodic flares of pancreatitis, her NG was advanced to a post-pyloric position and TFs were continued until she was extubated.
