He was placed on a diuresis holiday to allow his kidneys to recover.
A PICC line was placed and he was started on a dopamine drip and given 100mg IV torsemide with brisk diuresis.
He was transferred to the CCU on [**2152-2-8**] for further management and was inubated for poor oxygenation on non-rebreathing mask.

He continued to required significant diuresis and his dopamine drip was subseqently stopped and he was started on a lasix drip with excellent response achieving lenght of stay fluid balance approaching negative 20L.
He was then transitioned to po torsemide and was discharged on torsemide 40 mg po daily along with a 1.5 L fluid restriction.
