His infections were initially responding to IV fluids and antibiotics but on [**3-29**] he developed increasing abdominal pain and distention.
Per a recent urology note, patient is "s/p appendicovesicostomy and ACE which have not been used in some time due to indwelling Foley and rectal tube."

This isolate is an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase(ESBL) producer and should be considered resistant to all penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam.
Upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring, could reflect mild CHF.
Equivocally increased prominence anteriorly of the cavum septum pellucidum, of doubtful significance.
# ESBL urinary tract infection/sepsis:  Patient was initially septic with hypotension and required pressors in the ICU.
He was started was treated with meropenem from [**3-28**] to [**4-11**] (14-day course).
As his condition improved, he was weaned off of pressors and transferred to the medical floor.
# C. diff colitis: The patient was treated with PO Vancomycin and IV Flagyl (later changed to PO).
The plan is to continue Flagyl until [**2170-4-18**] (one week after other antibiotics were discontinued).
Vancomycin should be tapered as indicated in the discharge medication list.
IV vancomycin was added to the patient's other antibiotics on [**2170-4-3**] and was discontinued until [**2170-4-11**].
# Abdominal fluid collection: The patient was noted to have an intra-abdominal fluid collection.
The patient developed confusion hallucinations following extubation on [**2170-4-2**].
The patient continued Keppra and Dilantin (pre-admission medications), and was briefly on haloperidol.
Haloperidol was stopped on [**2170-4-9**].
The patient was discharged on Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Phenytoin was dosed at 150 mg QAM and 200 mg QPM.
This showed mild oropharyngeal dysphagia characterized primarily by intermittent premature spillover and swallow delay resulting in silent aspiration of thin liquids before and during the swallow.
The use of a chin tuck (single sips and consecutive straw sips) was effective in preventing and eliminating aspiration of thin liquids.
However when patient was noted to aspirate thin liquids when attempting to self-feed straw sips of thin liquid [**12-26**] reduced coordination resulting in poor chin tuck position.
The speech and swallow service recommended a PO diet of thin liquids and regular solids.
The patient will require strict 1:1 supervision to assist with feeding and cue him to use a chin tuck with ALL sips of thin liquids.
The patient was treated with IV fluids.
Review of records shows that he has developed similar pancytopenia in the setting of acute illnesses (previously during admissions in [**Last Name (LF) 547**], [**First Name3 (LF) 404**], and [**Month (only) **]).
# s/p appendicovesicostomy/ACE-[**Location (un) **] (anterograde continence enema): The patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (urology) as an outpatient.
The patient needs urinary catheterization times daily through his appendicovesicostomy (6a/12p/6p/12a), using 8FR straight catheter (at umbilicus, patient left side).
Procedure: (sterile technique) cleanse bladder ostomy area with chloraprep; lubricate catheter tip and insert catheter a few inches (does not need to be inserted the whole length & you may pull back if no flash of urine once fully inserted); attach catheter end to urinary leg bag collection bag to capture drainage (drain approx 30 mins); remove catheter, cover ostomy with sterile 2X2, and apply tegaderm.
# Hypertension: Metoprolol was started due to hypertension after extubation.
However, the patient was noted to be bradycardic to as low as 48 on metoprolol 25 mg TID.
Therefore, metoprolol was stopped at the time of discharge.
# Depression: Sertraline was initially held.
Consideration can be given to further titration of the patient's sertraline dose (his pre-admission dose was 100 mg daily).

You were admitted to the intensive care unit, where you initially required medications to support your blood pressure.
There are some changes to your medications: START Flagyl 500 mg every 8 hours for 5 more days START vancomycin taper CHANGE phenytoin dose to 150 mg in the morning and 200 mg in the evening DECREASE sertraline to 50 mg daily.
You will need to have your phenytoin (Dilantin) levels followed closely.
