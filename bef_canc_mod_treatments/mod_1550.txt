She was seen in Dr.[**Name (NI) 19759**] office and on examination it was noted that the extremity was cool to touch just inferior to the knee, the patient has dopplerable signals up to the superior component of the leg.
The patient is admitted for emergency evaluation and treatment.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Illnesses - Coronary artery disease with a history of ventricular tachycardia, status post automatic implanted cardioverter defibrillator in [**2163**], history of myocardial infarction times two in [**2151**] and [**2152**], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, history of cerebrovascular accident with residual right arm weakness, history of ischemic bowel syndrome, history of renal artery stenosis with chronic renal insufficiency, history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], history of deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremity in [**2155**].
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post aortic valve replacement, type not documented, history of cholecystectomy, history of right inguinal herniorrhaphy, history of appendectomy, status post cesarean section, status post nephrectomy on the right.
Vascular surgeries included aorto-bifemoral bypass graft with thrombectomy, anastomotic aneurysm repair in [**2168-6-14**], status post left femoral-popliteal, status post left superficial femoral artery to posterior tibial bypass with nonreverse saphenous vein graft, status post aorta to superior mesenteric artery bypass with 6 mm Dacron.
Status post aorta to splenic artery bypass graft with 4 mm PTFE.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coumadin, dose not documented, Lasix 40 mg b.i.d., Tylenol 650 mg q.
6 hours, Folate 1 mg q.d., Arborstatin 10 mg at h.s., Amlodipine 5 mg q.d., Moexipril 7.5 mg q.d., Lorazepam 2 mg b.i.d., Metoprolol 25 mg q.d.
Electrolytes, sodium 139, potassium 5.4, chloride 100, carbon dioxide 25, BUN 47, creatinine 2.1, glucose 76.
She had an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft with an automatic implanted cardioverter defibrillator in the left lower quadrant.
The posterior tibial artery was with severe narrowing with distal graft changes and marked stenosis.
The patient was not given total parenteral alimentation and intravenous heparin was begun.
A noninvasive arterial study for graft duplex was done the following morning which demonstrated that the distal half of the graft was occluded.
Because of the urgency of the vascular procedure, the patient proceeded to surgery after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 22.5.
She underwent on [**2169-7-28**], a left femoral-posterior tibial bypass with nonreverse lesser saphenous vein.
She required 2 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen platelets intraoperatively.
She was begun on intravenous nitroglycerin and Lopressor for systolic hypertension.
Her intravenous fluids were decreased to 50 cc/hr.
She required an additional transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells over the next 24 hours and her intravenous Lopressor dose was increased.
After the additional unit of packed cells her hematocrit was 27.9 from 22.5.
She continued on her intravenous Nitroglycerin, Coumadin was begun.
She has received a total of three doses of Lasix intravenously.
Her Lopressor was increased to 50 mg b.i.d.
She was given Dilaudid for analgesic control.
We continued Lasix to continue diuresis and Lovenox was begun while awaiting therapeutic INR levels.
Ambulation was continued and Coumadin was continued.
She underwent an arteriogram at that time along with a renal artery angioplasty with stent placement.
The patient required an additional 2 units of packed red blood cells for a drop in her hematocrit with additional Lasix.
Hematocrit was 25.2 post transfusion of 2 units of red blood cells.
The patient was begun on Pletal 100 mg b.i.d.
Nitroglycerin was given with some improvement in her symptoms.
Intravenous Lopressor was begun to decrease heartrate.
Recommendations were serial enzymes and electrocardiograms to allow the patient's renal function stabilize post angioplasty and angiogram, and they strongly recommended the patient to undergo a cardiac catheterization.
They recommended P-[**Male First Name (un) **] evaluation and if anterior ischemia continued would strongly recommend a cardiac catheterization, but if just inferior changes were noted she could be managed medically.
The patient had no further electrocardiogram changes but continued to refuse any further cardiac workup.
Coumadin dosing adjust to maintain an INR between 2.0 to 3.0 2.
Folic acid 1 mg q. day 3.
Moexipril 7.5 mg q.d.
Arborstatin 20 mg q.d.
Amlodipine 5 mg q.d.
Lorazepam 2 mg b.i.d.
Metopralol 50 mg b.i.d., hold for heartrate less than 55 or systolic blood pressure less than 100 8.
Lasix 40 mg b.i.d.
Pletal 100 mg b.i.d.
Enoxaparin 30 mg subcutaneously q.
12 hours, this will continue until the patient is at therapeutic Coumadin dosing.
This should be called to Dr.[**Name (NI) 5695**] office so Coumadin dosing can be adjusted.
Ischemic left foot, status post angio, status post left femoral-posterior tibial bypass graft with lesser saphenous vein 2.
Renal artery stenosis, status post left renal artery angioplasty with stent placement 3.
