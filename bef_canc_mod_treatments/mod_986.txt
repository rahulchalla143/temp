He received 4L NS with resolution of BP.
He reports being admitted to St. [**Hospital 11042**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 1468**], MA last year, and was apparently diagnosed with autoimmune mediated pericarditis.
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is significant for chest pain, but absent for dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Large pericardial effusion, heterogeneous perfusion of the liver with periportal edema, gallbladder wall edema, enlarged IVC and interval development of ascites (between initial and 20-minute delayed imaging) all suggest impaired venous return to the heart (early tampanade physiology?)
Pericardial drain placed with initial CI 2.46 up to 3.01 l/min/m2 and RA pressure 18 down to 10 mmHg.
Areas of focal pericardial thickening with circumferential pericardial late-gadolinium enhancement suggestive of pericardial inflammation.
Pericardial tethering on tagged images is consistent with, but not diagnostic of pericardial constriction.
On admission, the patient had an Echocardiogram that was suggestive of tamponade but he was hemodynamically stable with IV fluids.
He had equalization of pressures, consistent with tamponade, and a pericardial drain was placed with removal of pericardial fluid.
He will continue indomethacin, colchicine, and percocet prn for pain.
Indomethacin 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) for 2 weeks.
Famotidine 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) for 2 weeks.
Colchicine 0.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) for 2 weeks.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain for 10 days.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) for 2 weeks.
The fluid caused decreased function of your heart and therefore you had a procedure performed to remove the fluid.
Please take all medications as prescribed.
