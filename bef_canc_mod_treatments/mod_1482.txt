HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 37 year old female with a complex respiratory and cardiac history including nonHodgkin's lymphoma, status post CHOP and radiation resulting in pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, status post left pneumonectomy for aspergillosis infection.
He is status post tracheostomy.
In the Emergency Department the patient was treated with calcium, insulin and Kayexalate.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  NonHodgkin's lymphoma, pulmonary histoplasmosis and pulmonary aspergillosis, pulmonary fibrosis with the following pulmonary function tests, FVC .6, FEV 1/FEC 68%, tuberculosis in [**2121**], status post splenectomy, status post left pneumonectomy, cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%, anxiety and depression.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Trazodone, Captopril, Lasix 40 b.i.d., Atrovent, Serevent, Protonix, tube feeds, Ativan subcutaneous Heparin, Digoxin, Haldol, Risperdal, inhaled Tobramycin, Lopressor and Remeron.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has allergies to sulfa, oxacillin and Verapamil.
The patient lives with her mother but has recently required prolonged hospital care for tracheostomy and ventilator support.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, 100.7, heartrate 110, blood pressure 76/30, respiratory rate 19, oxygen saturation 97% on pressor support ventilation of 5 with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, and FIO2 of .4.
Tracheostomy tube is in place with minimal secretions.
Abdominal examination, soft, nontender, gastrostomy tube in place with significant drainage at the bandage and erythema surrounding the gastrostomy tube site.
PT is 12.7, PTT 26.6, INR 1.1, calcium 8.3, magnesium 2.0, albumin 2.6, Digoxin level 1.5, CK of 15, troponin of less than .3.
Chest x-ray on admission revealed congestive heart failure, however, improved from previous x-rays during previous admission.
The patient responded well to insulin, Kayexalate and calcium given in the Emergency Room and repeat potassium was 5.6.
With the initiation of aggressive Lasix diuresis, the patient became hypokalemic for the rest of her hospital course with values ranging between 3 and 3.6.
The patient was placed on a standing dose of 40 of [**Doctor First Name 233**]-Ciel by gastrostomy tube once a day and additionally the patient required frequent intravenous doses of [**Doctor First Name 233**]-Ciel.
At the time of discharge, the patient will likely require an increase in the dose of [**Doctor First Name 233**]-Ciel for maintenance.
Respiratory - The patient was having difficulty weaning off of ventilator support via tracheostomy during her previous admission and throughout her current hospital stay.
The patient was initially on pressor controlled ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit with inspiratory pressures of 35, FIO2 of .4 and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.
The patient was soon changed over the pressor support ventilation initially at 20/5 with an FIO2 of .40.
The patient was clinically volume-overloaded and it was felt that the patient's ventilator dependence would improve with aggressive diuresis.
Throughout the remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course through [**2131-3-26**], the patient was switched over the pressor support ventilation, initially 20/5 and eventually weaned down to 8/5.
The patient had a successful tracheostomy masked trial lasting two and a half hours on tracheostomy mask on [**2131-3-25**].
The patient was rested during the evening of [**2131-3-25**] on pressor support of [**7-23**].
Throughout, the criteria used for pressor support weaning throughout the patient's Intensive Care Unit stay was based on the title volumes the patient was taking as well as the patient's subjective feelings of shortness of breath and anxiety.
Cardiovascular - The patient was felt to be volume overloaded upon admission and was felt that she would benefit from aggressive Lasix diuresis.
The decision was made to discontinue the patient's Lopressor and Captopril and after this change the patient's blood pressures were much more appropriate and Lasix diuresis was instituted successfully.
The goal of the diuresis was to bring the patient down from an admission weight of approximately 59 kg to her calculated dry weight of approximately 51 kg.
The patient was initially on an intravenous Lasix b.i.d.
regimen, however, diuresis was not successful with this, therefore on hospital day #4 the patient was placed on a Lasix drip.
The patient remained on a Lasix drip of 7 mg per hour through hospital day #10 ([**2131-3-25**]) with daily diuresis between 1 and 1.5 liters.
On [**2131-3-25**], the patient was taken off of Lasix drip and was placed on a Lasix dose of 80 mg intravenously b.i.d.
The patient's Digoxin dose was also increased on hospital day #4 after a Digoxin level came back subtherapeutic at .7.
The patient's Digoxin dose was increased from .125 q.d.
Gastrointestinal - The patient presented with a percutaneous gastrostomy tube in place, however, there was a significant amount of drainage from the site in addition to some skin erythema and excoriation.
At the time of this dictation the patient is planned for laparotomy with gastrostomy tube resiting on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**2131-3-26**] or Tuesday [**2131-3-27**].
Anemia laboratory data were notable for a low iron level of 24 and the patient was started on iron supplementation, 325 mg p.o.
On hospital day #4 the patient was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells and on hospital day #5 the patient's hematocrit had gone up to 30.6.
Infectious disease - The patient was initially admitted on a regimen of inhaled Tobramycin 300 mg q.
The patient continued this treatment throughout her Medicine Intensive Care Unit stay and will continue on a schedule of one month on and one month off, the present cycle of Tobramycin is scheduled to end on [**2131-4-5**].
On hospital day #2 the patient had gram positive cocci on gram stain of blood drawn off of the patient's PICC line and the patient was started on Vancomycin.
The test was negative and the patient was not started on any supplemental corticosteroids.
Pain - Throughout the patient's Medicine Intensive Care Unit the patient experienced a significant amount of pain related to manipulation of her gastrostomy tube as well as drainage from the site of her gastrostomy tube.
The patient was treated with small doses of Morphine for this pain after the failure of Ultram and Toradol to relieve the pain.
