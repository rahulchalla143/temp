The axillary-femoral graft was punctured with a Cook needle, a wire advanced into the graft under fluoroscopy, and a 7-French sheath placed.
We then directed an angled glide wire into the axillary artery proximal to the proximal anastomosis and, over this, advanced a Omni Flush catheter, which was then connected to the power injector.
We then replaced the Omni Flush catheter and shot a completion arteriogram, which showed complete resolution of the waist previously seen in the graft.
A catheter was then placed and connected to a pressure transducer and a pull-back pressure done, which showed about a 5-mm systolic pressure gradient across the anastomosis, with no change in diastolic blood pressures, and about a 2- to 3-mm drop in the mean arterial pressure.
Proximal and distal control was obtained on the axillary-femoral graft.
It was pulled through the tunnel at the proximity with the superficial femoral artery, where proximal-distal control was again obtained, and a longitudinal arteriotomy was made.
The distal end of the graft was trimmed and spatulated appropriately and a 2nd end-to-side anastomosis fashioned, again with 6-0 [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex sutures.
Hemostasis was then secured, the heparin was fully reversed with protamine, and the wounds were closed in layers with 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures.
Dermabond skin dressing was applied over the wounds.
The patient tolerated this procedure well and, upon awakening, being extubated, was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.
Brief Hospital Course: [**2143-10-2**] Taken to the OR for Angioplasty of Left Proximal Anastomosis Ax-Bifem and Jump Graft Ax-Fem SFA with 6mm PTFE (see Op note)Tolerated procedure well.
