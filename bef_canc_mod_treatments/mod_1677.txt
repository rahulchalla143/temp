His vent was changed to FiO2 100%, Rate 30, TV 450, PEEP 10 with a resulting pH of 7.08, pCO2 59, pO2 141, HCO3 19.

CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - CVA [**2195**] without residual deficits - Gastric Ca s/p Bilroth II ([**2177**]) - Recurrent hyperplastic polyps w/ high grade dysplasia - HTN - BPH  Social History: Per prior d/c summary.

On admission, patient was started on and required additional pressure support with neo.
He went into AFib with RVR, started on amiodarone gtt, then taken off when he spontaneously converted to sinus brady.
He continued to be dependent on pressors, and balloon valvuloplasty was done with a goal to bridge to valve replacement once acute status improves.
He improved and was able to come off pressors and was eventually extubated.
He was evaluated by cardiac surgery, who felt he did not require AVR at this time.
Plan for this to be restarted, but given BP well-controlled without, this was not restarted during this admission.
His home Imdur was held given preload dependence.
On aspirin, plavix; held beta blocker initially, isosorbide while on pressors.
Plavix was discontinued on admission, as it was not thought to be clinically indicated and pt had recent GIB.
He was continued on ASA 325mg daily.
He was started on captopril on HD 5.
Captopril was uptitrated, and then switched to Lisinopril 40mg daily initially.
However, after pt made npo as discussed below, this was held, and not restarted at discharge.
He was started on IV metoprolol briefly given agitation and need for more tight BP management.
This was switched to po metoprolol to continue on discharge.
He was treated with beta blockade and kept on ASA 325mg.
He was initially started on seroquel qHS, but this did not effective and was started on Haldol with frequent re-orientation.
# HTN: His BP was difficult to control when he became agitated, requiring nitro gtt initially.
He was then transitioned to captopril with uptitration and hydral.
He was started on metoprolol 5mg IV q6hrs.
He was discharged on po metoprolol.
He was treated with free water, and his Na improved.
# Aspiration, failed swallow eval: Pt's voice was hoarse after extubation, and he repeatedly failed swallow evals, and eventual video swallow on [**1-15**].
He failed a second video swallow, and ACS was consulted for j-tube placement.
Given his anatomy, he had an open j-tube placed, and tube feeds were started.
He was discharged on his Lansoprazole (switched from aciphex), Lipase-Protease-Amylase, and Hyoscyamine Sulfate per prior regimen.
# Thrombocytopenia: Suspicion for HIT while on heparin subq.
Patient started on argatroban for DVT prophylaxis briefly.
Heparin SC was restarted for PPx.
INACTIVE ISSUES: # BPH: Finasteride was held during admission, and restarted on discharge.
Started on Flomax on discharge.
# HLD: Continued on Atorvastatin 40mg daily.
