In summary, the patient had mitral valve replacement with a #25 Mosaic and coronary artery bypass grafting times two, with LIMA to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.
She tolerated the operation well.
Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 224 min, and her cross-clamp time was 181 min.
At the time of transfer, she had Milrinone at 0.5 mcg/kg/min, Propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min, Neo-Synephrine at 3 mcg/kg/min.
Additionally the patient had epinephrine and Nitroglycerin drips with no dose identified at this time.
Her anesthesia was reversed.
She was allowed to awaken initially and was then resedated after a neurological check.
Her epinephrine drip was weaned to off shortly after arrival into the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
The cardioactive medications were titrated as tolerated by the patient's hemodynamics throughout the night on her operative date.
She was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated.
Her Milrinone was weaned to off.
Her Neo-Synephrine was weaned to 0.25 mcg/kg/min.
Additionally, her Nitroglycerin drip was maintained at 0.25 mcg/kg/min.
On postoperative day #3, all cardioactive intravenous medications were weaned to off and transitioned to oral medications.
The patient's chest tubes were discharge, and she was transferred from the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to Far Two for continued postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Over the next several days, the patient had an uneventful hospital course with the exception of intermittent atrial fibrillation which was treated with Amiodarone and beta-blockade.
Additionally the patient was restarted on her anticoagulation, which she had been receiving preoperatively for atrial fibrillation.
Right saphenous vein graft site with Steri-Strips and large echymotic area of upper thigh.
