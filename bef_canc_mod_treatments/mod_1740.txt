Brief Hospital Course: (This is a 65 year old female with PMH significant for multiple drug resistant PNAs, asthma/COPD s/p multiple intubations on 2.5L of home O2, pulmonary hypertension, diastolic heart failure, morbid obesity, OSA (not compliant with CPAP), aortic stenosis with valve area of [**2-3**].2 cm2), atrial fibrillation off Coumadin due to GI bleed, and HTN presenting with worsening cough over the last 4-5 days, worsening shortness of breath, and new greenish sputum production consistent with PNA.)
# Dyspnea, multifactorial with the recent pneumonia, baseline COPD, asthma, disastolic heart failure, and OSA.
She initially did well with medical therapy on the inpatient floor with antibiotics, nebulizers, and asthma therapy.
The patient was started on lasix drip with good response, diuresing ~24-25L of fluid.
While in the MICU, discussions regarding tracheostomy were had on multiple occasions  but the decision to proceed was defered to another date due to remarkable improvement in clinical respiratory status (although the patient and family understand that this might be the eventual endpoint of her respiratory disease).
She tolerated her nasal BIPAP well.
She was discharged home on 10mg of po Prednisone to complete her taper over the next three days.
# Chronic diastolic CHF, EF >55% (7/[**2197**]).
She received diuresis using lasix drip while in the MICU, and was net negative 24-25L upon leaving the MICU.
Patient is maintained at lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
(Of note, patient reported using torsemide 20 mg [**Hospital1 **] in the past which worked well for her.)
Patient as baseline alkalosis; however, it went up to > 50 while in the MICU, [**3-7**] to extreme diuresis the patient went through.
She was started on diamox, which decreased her bicarb, as well as her CO2.
She was treated empirically initially with meropenem given her history of multi-drug resistant bacterial infection in the past, then later added on levofloxacin and vancomycin.
She completed a 10 day course of vancomycin, meropenem, and levofloxacin on [**2197-10-29**].
She continued with alternative albuterol and ipratropium in additional to Advair, fexofendine and Singulair.
The patient was started on a prednisone taper prior to transfer to MICU and was continued on the floor.
She should continue to have a slow prednisone taper 10mg qd for three days following discharge.
Patient is rate controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol.
She was transitioned to short acting diltiazem (360 mg XR) to 90 mg 4 times daily.
She has not been anticoagulated with coumadin given her history of GI bleeding.
Patient had been quite resistant to using CPAP for OSA.
However, during this admission, she was placed on BIPAP in the MICU, and initially had a tremendous amount of difficulty due to nasal abrasion.
Patient was evaluated by physical therapy who recommended follow up and discharge to a rehabilitational facility.
Patient has been seen and assesed by wound care who reccomend daily softsob sponge and kerlex wrap.
