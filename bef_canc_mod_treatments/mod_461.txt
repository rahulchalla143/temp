HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname 4115**] [**Known lastname 17147**] is a 77 year-old white female with a past medical history significant for colon carcinoma status post sigmoidectomy in [**2158-3-5**] who presents with a 5.6 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm found on workup for her colon cancer.
She had a full course of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and her last colonoscopy revealed no recurrent cancerous lesions.
He decided that she had no previous angiographic evidence of progression of her coronary artery disease and in view of her mild stable symptoms and it was reasonable to proceed with her aneurysm surgery with the usual perioperative precautions without any intervention at that time.
She was evaluated for a endoluminal stent graft, however, was not a candidate possibly due to her femoral and iliac disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for sigmoid and colon cancer managed with surgery, chemotherapy and x-ray therapy.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Colon resection, appendectomy, left salpingo-oophorectomy and splenectomy.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] where she underwent open repair of her abdominal aortic aneurysm with an aortobifemoral bypass.
Details of this procedure are dictated in a separate operative note.
The patient was subsequently transferred up to Far Nine in the Vascular Intensive Care Unit where she was monitored for any hemodynamic changes, drop in urine output, and cardiac events.
She was evaluated by physical therapy and got out of bed and the Swan-Ganz catheter was discontinued.
She responded rather well with beta blockade and with Cardizem 25 mg intravenous bolus.
She was seen by cardiology who started her on a Cardizem drip at 5 cc per ml to be titrated slowly.
They were advised not to give any bolus of Cardizem after that.
Her blood pressure did remain somewhat low being less then 100 and one unit of packed red blood cells was transfused.
She was started on a heparin drip with PTT being monitored anywhere between 50 and 60.
The heparin was subsequently discontinued after an echocardiogram.
The echocardiogram failed to reveal any kind of mural thrombus present and it was decided by cardiology that she could be maintained on oral aspirin rather then chronic anticoagulation.
This was susceptible to Bactrim and she was subsequently started on this twice a daily.
It should also be noted she was discontinued off her cardizem drip and advised by cardiology to remain on her Atenolol.
She was then evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who was concerned about an intra-abdominal process due to her history of the colon cancer as well as her new aortic graft.
This was negative for any kind of abscess or perforation and only revealed gallstones without evidence of gallbladder wall thickening as well as a left flank hematoma beneath her kidney, which was expected secondary to her aortic surgery and the retroperitoneal incision.
Her Bactrim was discontinued and she was started on Levaquin and Flagyl to cover for any kind of occult infection or C-diff.
She continued to do well over the weekend and her white count dame down and she is currently afebrile.
She has been discontinued from her antibiotics and will go home with visiting nurse this evening.
