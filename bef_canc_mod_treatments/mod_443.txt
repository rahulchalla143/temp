The patient is now admitted for aneurysm resection with renal artery surgery.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2137-11-21**] and underwent bypasses to the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal I and II, and saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bilateral carotid disease status post endarterectomy, chronic renal insufficiency, diverticulosis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Include coronary artery bypass graft in [**2137-11-21**], bilateral carotid endarterectomy done in [**2132**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Include metoprolol 50 mg twice a day, Diovan 160/12.5 mg once daily, Norvasc 10 mg once daily, Norvasc 5 mg every evening, Coumadin 1 mg once daily, Ambien 5 mg daily at bedtime.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was without adenopathy, with bilateral carotid bruits, right greater than left.
The patient had a well-healed median sternotomy incision.
He underwent, on [**2138-12-2**], abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with a right renal artery endarterectomy and a left renal artery re-implantation, with an aortobifemoral.
He tolerated the procedure well, and was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for continued care.
The hypotension improved with intravenous fluid bolus.
They did feel that his beta blocker should be continued.
The patient did require inotropic support and vasopressor support during this incident and overnight.
He was continued on propofol secondary to intubation.
He was weaned off his Neo-Synephrine.
He continued to get fluids, normal saline one-half at 125 cc/hour.
He required an endotracheal tube change under direct laryngoscopy for hypoventilation.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
They felt he needed a total caloric intake of 1675 to [**2136**] calories/day with 67 to 100 grams of protein per day.
His epidural was discontinued on [**2138-12-5**], and the patient self-extubated himself on [**12-6**] and required re-intubation.
The nasogastric tube was removed on postoperative day five.
His lasix drip was discontinued.
He was placed on a T-piece on postoperative day seven, with the expectation to wean to extubate.
Renal was consulted regarding his continuing elevated creatinine, and their recommendations were to check urine for eosinophilia, renal ultrasound to rule out obstruction, and would continue to hydrate and increase oral intake.
Total parenteral nutrition continued to be held because of elevated BUN.
Total parenteral nutrition was discontinued, and the patient was continued on oral feeds with supplements three times a day.
The patient continued to remain anxious.
Oxycodone with acetaminophen tablets one every six hours as needed 2.
Isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg twice a day, hold for systolic blood pressure less than 110 3.
Calcium acetate tablets two three times a day with meals 4.
Protonix 40 mg every 24 hours 5.
Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously every 12 hours; this will be continued if he goes to rehabilitation 6.
Metoprolol 100 mg twice a day, hold for systolic blood pressure less than 110 or heart rate less than 60 7.
Tylenol 325 to 650 mg every four to six hours as needed 8.
Amlodipine 5 mg every evening, hold for systolic blood pressure less than 110 9.
Amlodipine 10 mg every morning, hold for systolic blood pressure less than 110  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm status post aortobifemoral 2.
Renal artery atherosclerosis status post endarterectomy of the right renal artery with re-implantation of the left renal artery 3.
