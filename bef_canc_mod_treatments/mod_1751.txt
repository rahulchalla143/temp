Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old female with past medical history significant for diastolic heart failure, moderate aortic stenosis with valve area of [**2-3**].2 cm2, bronchietasis and COPD with stage II gold criteria and home oxygen 2-4L admitted with one day history of shortness of breath, change in her productive [**Date Range **] and pleuritic chest pain.
She was treated with BIPAP and started on steroids, initially hydrocort 125mg IV Q8 which was gradually tapered to 60mg PO prednisone daily by the time she was called out to the floor.
Then she was transitioned to 30mg of prednisone prior to discharge.
She was diuresed with lasix; given a significant metabolic alkalosis she was briefly treated with acetazolamide with continued diuresis.
IV lasix was stopped and she was put on her home torsemide dose of 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
Prior to discharge, we held one dose of torsemide and prescribed half of a dose on the morning of [**2198-3-16**], with resuming her home dose in the evening on [**2198-3-16**] because of metabolic alkalosis.
She remained on CPAP at night, and her O2 saturations were titrated between 92-94% on 2-4L of oxygen which is her home baseline.
She was started on levofloxacin (at the time for empiric coverage of respiratory organisms when this was being entertained on the SOB ddx) and then transitioned to cipro when sensitivies grew out (and PNA was felt less likely) for a total of a 3 day course.
She had episodes of inconitnence in the setting of a foley that was traumatically partially removed.
Was amiodarone loaded and given diltiazem as her pressures would tolerate, which was gradually uptitrated to 90mg QID.
He continued to have episodes of RVR, and given her borderline blood pressures, we started metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and uptitrated to 37.5mg which caused her to have mildly worse [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] we decreased it to 25mg [**Hospital1 **], with a decrease in incidence of RVR.
Amiodarone was discontinued as the risks were thought to outweight the potential benefits in this patient.
She was anticoagulated with aspirin alone given a history of a prior GI bleed.
