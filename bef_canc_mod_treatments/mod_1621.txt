BRONCHOSCOPY [**8-28**]: INDICATION:  Respiratory failure with left-sided atelectasis,hypoxemia, lack of chest rise on the left.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 46 year old female with alcohol and questionable HCV cirrhosis and portal hypertension, admitted for variceal bleed and status post TIPS revision and varix embolization.
No bleeding was visualized so no intervention was performed.
Patient was continued on octreotide gtt and protonix gtt; she also received 6 units packed RBCs and 6 units FFP.
On [**8-28**] patient underwent TIPS revision and repeat embolization.
Once transferred from the MICU, she continued proton pump inhibitor, [**Hospital1 **].
She received lactulose, rifamixin and spironolactone during hospital stay; she was discharged on these medications.
The patient has no history of SBP, so prophylaxis was not restarted.
She was maintained on low dose nadolol 10mg.
Lasix and sliding scale insulin were discontinued, but she remained on spironolactone.
She was not discharged with any potassium supplementation due to concern for hyperkalemia on spironolactone.
4) Hypoxemia: -Bronchoscopy revealed and therapeutically aspirated left mainstem mucous plugs, presumed to be the result of pneumonia secondary to aspiration.
Patient was treated with 7 day course of vancomycin and aztreonam.
Patient was slowly weaned off the ventilator on [**9-2**].
On discharge, she did not require supplemental oxygenation to maintain an oxygen saturation in the mid 90's.
There was initial concern for sepsis, so patient was started on a seven day-course vancomycin, aztreonam and flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia (stopped on [**9-2**]).
Patient initially required levophed for pressure support, but was weaned off pressors, as she was stable following blood product and IVF bolus infusions.
On [**9-5**] she was started on nadolol 10mg for her portal hypertension, had some SPB's in high 80's/low 90's.
This prompted a questioned underlying adrenal insufficiency given her low level on admission and patient received a week's course of hydrocortisone 50mg (finished [**9-3**]).
Patient should have a repeat cortisol stimulation test at PCP visit on [**2176-9-13**] to assess adrenal function in non-stress situation and after a period since finishing steroid course.
