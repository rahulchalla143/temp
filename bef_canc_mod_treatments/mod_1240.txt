The 30% proximal LAD lucency seen on prior angiogram was  unchanged.
The OM2 had 65% in-stent restenosis at the proximal segment of the stent and 60% at the distal end of the stent.
Resting hemodynamic assessment revealed a 12 point step-up from the SVC to the PA. A full saturation run was performed (see table above) and The findings were consistent with a possible small left-to-right  intracardiac shunt at the upper chamber (RA) level.
