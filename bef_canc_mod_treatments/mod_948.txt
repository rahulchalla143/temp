Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure after taking an extra dose of your sleeping medication Ambien.
Given that you have had 2 recent prior admissions for respiratory failure, including one that led to intubation and tracheostomy, it is likely that you have an underlying breathing disorder that caused you to be extra sensitive to the Ambien.
You were briefly intubated in the medical intensive care unit but quickly stabilized and they were able to take the breathing tube out without any difficulty.
On the medicine floor you were treated with a breathing machine called BiPAP for one night.
At home you should use oxygen at night while sleeping.
You should NOT take Ambien at nighttime.
It was recommended that you have an outpatient sleep study, and one was in the process of being arranged for you during your admission, however you have declined having the study performed.
