Case discussed with surgery consult.
Pt received antibiotics at OSH but no clear source of infection and these were stopped.
Surgery recommended keeping patient NPO, continuing IVF and providing supportive care (including optimizing nutrition).
Given his contrast allergy, he was prepped for a CT scan with prednisone but surgery did not feel any further imaging was necessary.
His pain was managed with oxycodone which he required q 3 hours.
The aim was to eventually wean off the oxycodone and the marinol as well.
# Malnutrition, severe with anorexia; The patient's malnutrition was likely multifactorial [**2-2**] anorexia due to continued pancreatitis, alcoholism and depression.
GI did not recommend PICC placement for TPN, and also did not feel that starting tube feeds again was warranted.
He had a GJ tube placed in the past and had complications from it, but as he was not a good candidate for TPN (given psych and substance abuse history and risk of line infection), and as nutrition is ideally given enterically in pancreatitis, we felt the benefit far outweighed the risks and he [**Known lastname 1834**] IR guided J Tube placement on [**4-23**].
During his hospitalization he did advance his diet to solids but he had persistent pain, so it was restarted on clears and then advanced to clears.
He is taking full liquids with glucerna shakes.
He will require J-tube feeds overnight - 12 hours - with Peptamen 1.5 at 100 cc/hr.
He was repleted with lytes PRN .
He was started on meropenem for coverage of pacnreatic necrosis and biliary flora.
He was placed on a CIWA scale with diazepam.
Due to increasing benzo requirements, he was transferred to the ICU for further monitoring.
# Depression Patient was evaluted by psychiatry who recommended medical/alcohol rehab, continuing citalopram and minimizing benzos.
# Diabetes Mellitus: pt was placed on insulin sliding scale and started on lantus as his AM sugars were consistently elevated.
