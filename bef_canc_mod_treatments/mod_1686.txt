[**2190-1-10**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS: IMPRESSION: No evidence for DVT   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented for elective removal of her gallbladder on [**2190-1-6**].
She was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
The operation took approximately 4 hours total and proceeded without complication.
Post-operatively, a foley catheter was placed with good urine output >500 cc.
She was transferred to the ICU for further post-operative monitoring.
Given her 7L positive fluid status she was given one dose of albumin on transfer to the ICU.
Hyperkalemia was treated and trending down.
Seen by renal service and given lasix 160 mg in PM of POD 1 then 80 mg on POD 2 AM.
Her oxygen requirement increased on the AM of POD 1, requiring intubation later that day.
With aggressive chest PT, pulmonary toilet, and physical therapy, she was weaned to 5L NC with good O2 sats by POD#4.
Her oxygen saturation was routinely monitored and her supplemental oxygen was weaned from 5 L to 3 L NC.
She remained without respiratory compromise and continued with incentive spirometry and pulmonary toileting.
She was also started on a bowel regimen to avoid constipation.
Her foley catheter remained in place with adequate urine output.
Suicide precautions were maintained with a 1:1 sitter.
However, upon later re-evaluation on POD#6, it became clear that she was not actively suicidal and that some of her behavior and statements may have been related to delirium related to pain/medications/hypoxia.
Suicide precautions and section 12 were removed and she remained without evidence of suicidal ideation for the remainder of her hospitalization.
