He was intubated electively for airway protection.
Following intubation, he underwent bronchoscopy which demonstrated aspirated food particles in his RLL and purulent secretions.
He was continued on empiric vancomycin and levofloxacin for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
Metronidazole was added for expanded anaerobic coverage.
He initially had difficulty weaning off of the ventilator due to intermittent episodes of tachypnea with low tidal volumes, particularly when his pressure support was weaned; this was thought to be due in part to anxiety/withdrawl, and so he was put back on a low dose of standing diazepam and his propofol was weaned.
He was continued on Levofloxacin and Flagyl, but Vancomycin was discontinued as Flagyl could adequently cover anaerobes in aspiration.
He was evaluated by speach and swallow who did note Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of 4, mild-moderate dysphagia but not over aspiration.
They recommended PO diet of thin liquids and puree consistency solids with supervision with all PO's and suction as needed.
He was discharged afebrile, feeling better with minimal SOB, slight hypoxia at baseline given underlying emphysema and prior home O2 usage.
