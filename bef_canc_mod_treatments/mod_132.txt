We think that this occurred because you had not been taking all of your COPD medications, and also caught a cold that caused inflammation in your airway and affected your breathing.
During this admission, you were treated with COPD medications like albuterol, Advair, and ipratropium inhalers.
You were also started on oral prednisone and an antibiotic called azithromycin.
You were also kept on oxygen during your hospital stay.
Your Metformin and Furosemide were stopped while you were in the hospital, because of the elevation of the kidney blood tests.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] will decide whether or not you should restart this medication when you see her in follow-up.
This is due to the prednisone that you are taking and should resolve once this medication course is completed.
We started you on 5 units of NPH in the hospital twice daily, which you were taught to give yourself in the hospital, and should take this before breakfast and at night while you are on the prednisone.
You should continue the insulin while on the prednisone and then follow up with you PCP about further blood sugar control as your blood sugars will be lower once you stop the steroids.
It is very important that you adhere to the medication regimen that is prescribed for you.
There have been several changes to your medications during this hospital stay as outlined below:  MEDICATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN STOPPED: Metformin 1000 mg po twice daily Furosemide 20 mg PO daily These medications should be re-started only if advised by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**].
NEW MEDICATIONS: Prednisone 60mg PO once daily for 2 days, then 40 mg po once daily for 3 days, then 20 mg once daily for 3 days, then 10 mg once daily for three days then stop Mucomyst 600mg PO twice daily Fluticasone nasal spray, 2 sprays per nostril twice per day as needed for nasal congestion Ipratropium inhaler, 2 puffs every 8 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing 5 units NPH insulin injected subcutaneously before breakfast and at night CHANGED MEDICATIONS: Fluticasone-Salmeterol 500mcg-50 mcg 2 puffs once daily changed to two puffs twice daily.
