In the ED, he was treated with 2L NS for concern of hypovolemic hyponatremia.
Neurology was consulted for his AMS and seizure and they felt that his hyponatremia was likely related to recent initiation of carbamezapine for sensory illusions.
Carbamezapine has a known ADH like effect and can cause hyponatremia.
Following discontinuation of carbamezapine along with fluid restriction, his Na increased.
He has a suprapubic catheter [**12-24**] neurogenic bladder and on the day prior to admission, he had a urine sample that grew pseudomonas, a bacteria he has had in the past.
He has also had several pneumonias in the past, most likely [**12-24**] frequent aspirations and his first CXR was concerning for lung infiltrate.
He was treated with one dose of vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia.
Because of his pseudomonal bacteriuria, he was started on ciprofloxacin.
However, he was treated with a full course of cipro for a complicated UTI.
His catheter was changed and all other cultures remained negative.
During this time he was mentating well, he did not have any complaints, denied chest pain, headache, and visual changes.
Maintained other blood pressure medications at home doses.
Pneumonia had been ruled out and his UTI was being treated with a medication that was appropriate per sensitivities.
However, he was started on meropenem and was treated for 2 days.
He was still slightly febrile but his meropenem was discontinued for concern of drug fever.
