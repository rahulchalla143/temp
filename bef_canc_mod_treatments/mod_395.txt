Short-term followup radiographs are recommended to reassess, and particularly of suspicion for discrete nodules were to persist, then chest CT could be considered.
RUQ U/S [**2184-1-6**] Status post cholecystectomy without intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation; trace amount of perihepatic ascites, similar to prior exams.
There was silent aspiration of thin liquids with multiple sips.
There was a thin line of penetration noted in the laryngeal vestibule with thin liquids during chin tuck.
There was mild pharyngeal residue with cup sips of nectar thick liquids but no penetration or gross aspiration.
IMPRESSION: Silent aspiration of thin liquids with persistent penetration on thin liquids with chin tuck.
Brief Hospital Course: 41 yo female with history of childhood ALL, pulmonary fibrosis s/p left lobe lung transplant, left mainstem bronchus bronchomalacia s/p stent placement, and sinus tachycardia presented with fever and cough, found to be tachypneic, tachycardic, and hypotensive with infiltrates on CXR.
Due to her respiratory failure, she was intubated in the ED and placed on ventilation with low tidal volumes per ARDSnet protocol.
Her left mainstem stent remained patent but was noted to have migrated distally; this was taken up with interventional pulmonology but per their recommendation, there was no indication for intervention at this time.
Given her prior history of MRSA pneumonia, multiple health care encounters and recent CAP, she was treated presumptively for HCAP, and was started on Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin (discontinued on [**1-6**]).
The patient's leukocytosis continued to improve throughout her course and her ventilatory support was gradually weaned until she was successfully extubated on [**2184-1-13**].
She completed her antibiotic course on [**2184-1-16**].
A central line was placed, and she was given aggressive fluid resuscitation as well as started on norepinephrine and phenylephrine drips to keep her MAP on target per early goal-directed therapy protocol.
Her phenylephrine was discontinued late on [**1-3**], and she received several additional boluses of IV fluid, to which she responded.
Her pressures continued to improve, and her norepinephrine drip was gradually decreased, until it was finally discontinued on [**2184-1-7**].
The patient's home carvedilol was held for the duration of her stay due to her hypotension, and she was later transitioned to low-dose metoprolol due to its superior cardioselectivity.
