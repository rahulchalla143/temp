The patient's pneumonia sepsis is noted to be ceftriaxone sensitive but resistant to oxacillin and the patient was continued on ceftriaxone.
The patient was able to come off of pressors on [**2151-4-19**] so the patient's acid base status resolved with the fluid resuscitation.
As above, the patient continued on ceftriaxone 1 gram b.i.d.
Her Fentanyl and Versed drips were weaned by 20 percent per day.
She required frequent nebs for several days but these were eventually able to be spaced out.
She had initially been started on her own dose of metoprolol 1 b.i.d.
At the time of this dictation the patient was requiring 6 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula and nebulizer treatments every four hours.
She was treated with Haldol and also with restraints when needed.
Psychiatry was consulted and they felt that as she did have a psychiatric history notable for panic disorder that her behavior was likely delirium in the setting of a medical illness.
The patient was placed on imipramine which had been restarted when her outpatient doses were held.
Initially the patient was tried on Zyprexa 2.5 mg p.o.
but if anything she got worse on this dose and the Zyprexa was discontinued and as of this dictation Haldol was being used p.r.n.
The differential for agitation included Intensive Care Unit and acute illness related delirium, benzodiazepine withdrawal given her recent treatment with the Versed drip, or possibly steroid-induced psychosis.
Needless to stay during her treatment for sepsis patient's blood pressure medications were held.
Once she recovered her volume and was no longer septic she was restarted on her blood pressure medications including metoprolol, Lisinopril and amlodipine.
The patient was treated with tube feeds during her intubation and these were discontinued upon extubation and she was eating a robust p.o.
The patient was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and heparin subcutaneously.
Her arterial line has been discontinued from the time of extubation.
The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course including discharge disposition, diagnoses, medications instructions will be dictated at a later date.
