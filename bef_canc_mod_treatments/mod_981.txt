Creatinine and BUN rising so aggressive diuresis aborted.
His respiratory distress was thought to be multifactorial; due to CHF (he was in afib, likely volume overloaded), influenza (tested positiv from nasal aspirate), ?pneumonia, and his underlying lung disease.
They felt that the differential for his interstitial lung disease was UIP, amiodarone toxicity, and BOOP.
They recommended high dose steroids to be continued for a month (prednisone 60 mg).
He was diuresed in the unit, started on broad spectrum antibiotics, and given supportive care.
He remained in normal sinus rhythm after this intervention and had not more problems with volume overload.
Esophageal Cancer (T3N0M0): He is s/p chemotherapy and radiation in [**6-29**] followed by esophagectomy in [**10-30**].
Postoperatively, he had a J-tube placed to aid with nutrition, and he has not been able to take PO's safely (has failed multiple speech and swallow evaluations).
He should be maintained solely on J-tube feeds until that time.
Beta blocker, statin, and ace were started.
He was discharged on a regimen of Toprol, Lisinopril, and Digoxin.
He was aggressively diuresed in the unit (component of volume overload likely contributing to his respiratory distress and requiring [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay).
c) Valve: S/p MVR: He was kept appropriately anticoagulated on heparin and coumadin as necessary while in-house and discharged on coumadin.
He will need to have his [**Hospital Unit Name 263**] checked twice a week (goal [**Hospital Unit Name 263**] 2.5-3.5), and his coumadin dose may need to be adjusted accordingly based on these results.
Required cardioversion initially in hospitalization and was paced out of afib [**1-31**].
Hypothyroidism: He was continued on levoxyl throughout his hospitalization.
Diabetes: He was continued on 40 U lantus and covered with sliding scale insulin while in-house.
FEN, s/p Esophagectomy: he was continued on tube feeds via his J-tube.
He failed speech and swallow evaluations on multiple occasions, and had a video swallowing study on [**2116-2-7**] where he failed thin and nectar thick liquids (frank aspiration noted with inappropriate coughing/clearing reflex).
Disposition: He was quite physically debilitated at the conclusion of his hospitalization, and he required rehabilitation where aggressive physical therapy and occupational therapy can be continued.
