Liver was consulted and agreed to do endoscopy non-urgently; however, given patient was hemodynamically unstable due to withdraw (tachycardia, agitated, tachypnic)- this was deferred to an outpatient process.
Home anti-hypertensive (atenolol) was changed to half the equivalent dose of metoprolol.

Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus, will hold anticoagulation given bleed.
He was placed on his home medications at the time of discharge.
H/o hypertension: Will permit him to be mildly hypertensive as he is now, will control hypertension via withdrawal as above and address any urgency without beta blockade given GI bleed.
He voiced appropriate understanding of the pros and cons of having the procedure and that he understood the reasons of why we want he to get the test (please refer to omr for full note).
