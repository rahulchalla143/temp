Admission Date:  [**2176-6-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-6-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2130-4-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: CC: coffee ground emesis, black diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Upper endoscopy  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 46 year old woman with EtOH/HCV cirrhosis, grade 1 varices and portal gastropathy who presents with n/v/d, abdominal pain and coffee ground emesis since this am.
In the Ed she was given 2 units of FFP, vitamin K, levofloxacin 500 mg x 1, octreotide gtt, and 1 liter of NS.
Had "DTs" in during years of EtOH abuse never admitted for withdrawal symptoms.
She was volume expanded with normal saline and a total of 9 pRBC units.
There were no active bleeding vessels visible during the procedure and none of the lesions detected required intervention.
She was discharged in stable condition, tolerating oral food and medication.
She was referred to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] in the Liver Center with the consideration that a TIPS procedure might be therapeutic to treat her duodenal varix that was the presumptive cause of the bleeding.
She was vigorously volume expanded with saline and blood products and transfered to the MICU for close observation.
Following stabilization and transfer to the medical floor, she stated that her blood pressure has always run low and 80s and 90s systolic are not uncommon for her.
Her home diuretics were held during the hospitalization, and only the furosemide at a low dose was to be re-started at discharge.
Hypoxia:  With the history of diastolic CHF the patient developed mild hypoxia  following the vigorous volume expansion with saline and blood.
This was corrected with natural diuresis and supplemental oxygen.
The smear did not reveal appreciable shistocytes and the DIC panel including trend did not support DIC.
Heparin was held.
The platelet level should be followed as outpatient for return with consideration for discontinuing the PPI if the platelet count does not recover.
At discharge she was re-started on low dose nadolol and furosemide and scheduled for Liver Center follow-up.
However, a large RBC count was measured in a sample from a foley catheter.
A follow-up UA after the foley was removed showed a decrease in the RBC by more than half the prior level.
Routine UA follow-up is recommended to confirm the clearance of the urine.
Her bowel regimen was changed and she was tolerating food upon discharge.
