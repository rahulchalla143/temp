Subsequently he had a Quinton catheter placed and was dialyzed from [**11-21**] until [**11-24**] without any incident.
His atrial fibrillation was resolved with Beta blocker treatment.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further care and cardiac catheterization.
MEDICATIONS:  His medications on presentation were Nephrocaps, Vasotec, Aspirin, Sulfasalazine, Lopid, Prevacid, PhosLo,      , Isordil, Tenormin and Ambien.
His albumin was 3.6 with a calcium of 10.2, magnesium 1.7 and a phosphorus of 3.7.
He was then rate-controlled with beta blockers and nitroglycerin and has remained in sinus rhythm throughout his hospitalization.
The patient was started on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation anticoagulation.
He had no further issues with congestive heart failure during his hospitalization once he was rate-controlled with beta blockers, ACE inhibitor and nitroglycerin prn for dyspnea.
Pulmonary - The patient had a question of an aspiration pneumonia with right middle lobe and right upper lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray.
He was started on Flagyl and Levaquin.
The patient's pulmonary status improved with hemodialysis and fluid removal as well as the institution of beta blocker and ACE inhibitor to decrease both his preload and afterload.
The patient is on hemodialysis Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday schedule.
It was thought the patient tolerated the hemodialysis without difficulty.
His antibiotic of Levaquin and Flagyl were stopped and the patient remained afebrile and without complaints.
It is recommended the patient receive serial blood cultures during hemodialysis to rule out the possible occult bacteremia.
It was noted that the patient had persistently elevated white blood cell count throughout his hospitalization with an increase of a high of 30 subsequently to the beginning of Prednisone for pretreatment for his computerized axial tomography scan.
He was on Protonix for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.
She was also on heparin during his one episode of gastrointestinal bleeding.
The patient is on Coumadin for anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.
He will need Coumadin anticoagulation for a total of 30 days status post his episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
He also had a left forearm arteriovenous fistula placed status post surgery at [**Hospital3 **].
The patient has a right subclavian Hickman catheter which can be used for dialysis as an outpatient.
It was noted by Vascular Surgery as well as Transplant Surgery at [**Hospital6 256**] that the patient's fistula is patent and will be usable in two to three weeks when his postoperative changes have resolved.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response now in normal sinus rhythm on Coumadin 3.
Left subclavian vein stenosis, status post total parenteral alimentation and stent 5.
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis 6.
Hypertension  MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Warfarin 2 mg p.o.
Atenolol 25 mg p.o.
Lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
Isosorbide Dinitrate 20 mg p.o.
Gemfibrozil 30 mg p.o.
Ambien 5 mg p.o.
prn Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
Atorvastatin 20 mg p.o.
Zantac 40 mg p.o.
FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 44748**] his Nephrologist in hemodialysis on Saturday as well as to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 44748**] more closely, phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 44749**].
It is recommended the patient receive a cardiologist as an outpatient for follow up of his myocardial infarction as well as for Amiodarone management.
The patient also needs close follow up secondary to his new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and possible medication and/or diet control.
He is to receive dialysis on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and it is recommended that surveillance blood cultures be drawn during this time.
