Pt reports symptoms started on [**5-18**] after she had received dialysis that day.
During her next HD session on [**5-23**] it was noted that pt had SBP >200-250 patient was also c/o headache and sent to ED for HTN management.
Pt was admitted to the ED for severe hypertensive crisis, given captopril, labetolol 20mg, 40mgx2, 80mg then started on nitro and labetolol gtt.
She also received dilaudid for her HA and she was transferred to the MICU for hypertensive urgency and fevers (102).
Shortly after she suffered from a second seizure which stopped after Lorazepam 2mg iv, pt was then successfully intubated and entered brief post-ictal coma (with intact brain stem reflexes).

The urothelium of the renal pelvis is abnormally thickened and edematous and demonstrates enhancement on post-gadolinium imaging.
Severe cortical thinning of the transplant kidney.
Abnormally thickened and edematous renal transplant urothelium.
Apparent FLAIR-hyperintensity in the sulcal subarachnoid spaces.
F admitted for malignant hypertension after missing HD session and nonadherent with her medications.
Patient was also found to be in microangiopathic thrombotic anemia with platelet consumption.
She was disoriented to location, time and suffered from post-ictal amnesia.
The pt also just had been intubated and had central lines in place.
Pt was initially started on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis to which she responded well.
Therefore phenytoin was d/c and pt was started on valproic acid instead.
Her valproic acid have been monitored closely to titrate dosage, currently she is on Valproic acid 500mg po bid standing, last valproic level on [**6-3**] was 75.
MRI Abdomen, TSH, Cortisol - serum epinephrine and metanephrine were within normal limits).
She has a history of not taking her medications, missing HD may also have complicated situation along with worsening renal failure/hypoperfusion/high RAAS.
History from previous admission of bp elevated >200s but responded to Lasix and labetalol.
Pt in ED initially was started on nitro gtt and nipride gtt in ED.
Drips were stopped after seizures and improved BP control.
BP was hard to control at first but stabilized over the past 72h under enforced treatment with Labetalol, Lisinopril, Clonidine, Nifedipine and intermittent Hydralazine (which was d/c on [**6-2**], due to orthostatic symptoms).
Repeated adjustments in BP-regimen were made to optimize current treatment and prevent hypotensive episodes.
Pt is discharged on Lisinopril 40mg po to qhs, Clonidine TTS 3 patch qthurs, Labetalol 800mg po bid and Nifedipine 120mg po qhs.
Also considering a component of non-compliance it is important that the pt will f/u with PCP and for monitoring of compliance.
ESRD Pt is s/p renal transplant in [**2173**] and tx rejection in [**Month (only) 404**] [**2193**], now back on HD, 3 times a week.
Pt received HD throughout her hospital course and will be followed by renal as an outpatient, receiving HD at the [**Hospital1 18**].
She will be continued on her prednisone taper for immuno suppression with her graft.
deviation/diplopia and mydriasis (reactive to light), accompanied by right hemicranial HA during HD on [**6-4**] - resolving within 10 minutes.
stenosis <40%) and LP (no xanthocromia,clear and colorless).
The HA was thought to be triggered by pt not following instruction after LP, such as bed-rest and high pressure overnight (up to 220s SBP.
HA resolved throughout the day, initially treated with Oxycodone-Acetaminophen and Fioricet for HA, as well as Dolasetron for nausea.
Pt was given 2 Units of Blood on [**6-6**] at HD, in addition to usual Epoetin administration during HD sessions.
Indicative for an underlying TTP are the following findings are thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, schistocytes, elevated LDH, decreased haptoglobin, elevated creatinine, mental status changes and fever.
Interestingly, the pt had a similar thrombocytopenic episode in [**2193-1-20**] when she was hospitalized for her renal tx rejection.
