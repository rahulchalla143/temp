There has been interval opacification of the retrocardiac left lower lung which is presumably in part due to atelectasis and large effusion although a concurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Interval increase in size of right pleural effusion and dependent consolidation at the right lung base.
Brief Hospital Course: 58 year old male with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease who presented from an LTAC following an episode of hypoxia with O2 sats in the 70's.
Hypoxia:  He has underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD that causes persistent respiratory compromise requiring 4L NC of oxygen at baseline.
He was treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn empirically, which was then stopped after a 7 day course ([**Date range (1) 12917**]).
Consideration was given to organisms likely to infect immunocompromised hosts; however, patient has been on prophylaxis with acyclovir, bactrim, voriconazole, and tobramycin.
He was maintained on 4L nasal cannula and required deep suctioning to maintain his O2 sats.
He was continued on 30mg of prednisone daily, and tapered to 20mg po prednisone on [**2124-10-20**].
He was also trialed on BiPap which he did not tolerate as his O2 sats decreased to low 80's.
A tracheostomy was performed on [**10-24**] and the patient maintained on a ventilator thereafter.
Currently, the patient is maintained on Pressure Support at 5/5 with FiO2 at 40%.
He should be weaned off of the ventilator to trach mask as tolerated.
Continue aggressive suctioning, atrovent and albuterol MDIs.
CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD: He was continued on mycophenolate mofetil and continued on prednisone, which was tapered to 20mg po daily as above.
Additionally, he continued on his home prophylaxis with bactim, voriconazole, tobramycin and acyclovir.
He was started on azithromycin for Mac prophylaxis and completed a week of 500 mg daily, and was switched to 250 mg three times weekly on [**10-27**].
He initially continued on his home regimen of fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches, and pregabalin.
A pain management consult was obtain, and it was felt that the patient was likely not absorbing his fentanyl scondary to skin tears and generalized edema.
Consequently, his fentanyl patch was discontinued and he was started on a dilaudid PCA with improvement in his pain control.
He should continue on the dilaudid PCA with both a basal and bolus rate.
Additionally, he was started on amytriptiline for improvement in neuropathic pain control.
# Risk for Serotonin syndrome: The patient is currently on various drugs that can precipitate serotonin syndrome (amytriptiline, citalopram, dilaudid).
He was continued on enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H, which is a reduced dose because of a prior episode of profuse bleeding when on a higher dose.
His rate was more responsive to diltiazem than metoprolol, and his medications were adjusted accordingly.
He should be continued on diltiazem for rate control, although he is in sinus rhythm at the time of discharge.
# Depression: The patient has appeared withdrawn since admission, which worsened after intubation and tracheostomy.
He was started on citalopram on [**2124-10-25**].
# Hypotension: Intermittently hypotensive to 80s systolic, likely related to administration of sedating medications.
FEN: A PEG was placed on [**10-25**] and the patient began receiving tube feeds for nutrition.
