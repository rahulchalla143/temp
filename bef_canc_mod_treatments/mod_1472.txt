[**2136-10-2**] CHEST X-RAY:  Consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.
[**2136-10-3**] CHEST X-RAY: IMPRESSION:  Status post right IJ central line placement without evidence of complication; worsening heart failure.
Atrophic kidneys with multiple indeterminate lesions, some of which are cysts, but many of which are incompletely characterized, so RCC cannot be excluded; MR may be considered for further characterization.
[**2136-10-5**] PHARMACOLOGIC STRESS IMPRESSION:  1.
# CHF:  Pt was found to have new biventricular heart failure (EF 20%) on echo with LV thrombus.
P-MIBI [**2136-10-5**] showed no reversible or fixed myocardial perfusion defects, diffuse hypokinesia, EF 24%.
- CT of head was negative for any intracranial process, so patient was given heparin bolus and heparin gtt was started for LV thrombus, until therapeutic on warfarin.
- Continued home valsartan, started metoprolol at decreased dose (25mg TID) then uptitrated as tolerated back to home dose - Cont simvastatin 20 mg PO/NG DAILY - Cannot get spironolactone given ESRD - Continue HD for fluid removal qSaTuThu - Thiamine levels were not drawn prior to starting IV thiamine, empirically treating with daily thiamine supplementation as wet beri-beri is on the differential for cardiomyopathy with elevated lactate.
- Heparin gtt bridge until therapeutic on warfarin  # Elevated lactate: Rose to lactate of 8 on day of admission and then decreased to 1.8 with HD.
Got Vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin for one day but was discontinued on HD2 because no evidence of infection.
Continued azithromycin for 4 days for possible atypical pneumonia vs pertussis given history of 6 weeks of severe cough with post-tussive emesis - HIV pending at time of discharge - Hep serologies pending at time of discharge - CT abd/pelvis negative for bowel ischemia, transplant surgery saw and felt no surgical issues - LV dysfunction without hypotension unlikely to cause this kind of lactate elevation.
- Other etiologies include toxic ingestions:  Patient has arthritis and dementia but does not endorse taking increased amounts of over the counter pain medications such as tyelenol or aspirin.
Sertraline was held per toxicology recommendations, but restarted with no new elevation in lactate.
- Thiamine deficiency can also cause a lactic acidosis.
Rec'd azithromycin [**Date range (1) 6230**].
Infection control stated that patient does not need to be on droplet precautions because onset was 6 weeks ago and cough is improved.
# ESRD on HD TThSa schedule: When she was admitted she had missed a day of dialysis because of fatigue.
On [**10-3**] she received dialysis and then received a partial dialysis on [**10-4**] to get her back on schedule.
Received dialysis [**2136-10-8**] prior to discharge.
# HTN: Kept on home valsartan.
# HLD: Kept on home dose of simvastatin  # Osteoarthritis: Home tylenol was discontinued because of concern for toxicity while in the hospital.
