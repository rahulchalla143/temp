Surgical clips are seen in the right upper quadrant.
Anterior abdominal surgical staples are unchanged.
This initial management repair was done in [**State 108**], and subsequent problems with [**Name2 (NI) **] limb occlusion and infection resulted in left above knee amputation, removal of an infected femoral- femoral bypass [**Name2 (NI) **], and ultimately removal of the infected main body of the endovascular device.
This was performed 2- [**1-19**] years ago, and the aorta was reconstructed with a rifampin-soaked tube [**Month/Day (2) **] from the infrarenal aorta to the common iliac artery on the right.
She was unable to tolerate her Bactrim due to neutropenia, and after stopping it, never resumed any suppressive antibiotic therapy.
She was  treated with a covered stent [**Last Name (STitle) **] R iliac anastamosis.
HD was initiated and a tunneled line was placed.
The pt together with her family decided that she would not want extensive surgery to explant her aortic [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Her abdominal incision line is non erythematous and has staples in place.
