CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There has been a hysterectomy and apparent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.
Apparent rectal and sigmoidal bowel wall thickening which may relate to prior radiation treatment for cervical cancer or an acute colitis.
Initial scout view demonstrated surgical clips overlying the lower mid abdomen and residual contrast material in the colon.
On [**5-27**] she had a brief episode of rapid Afib, which was treated successfully with IV lopressor.
Her cardiac treatment was complicated by occasional episodes of bradycardia with increasing doses of lopressor.
Cardiology consult was called, and her lopressor dose was eventually titrated to 50 mg PO bid.
Electrophysiology was consulted as well to assess whether a pacemaker would be indicated, but by this time her tachycardia was relatively well controlled with the lopressor and the pacer was declined.
The plan will be to follow up the final pathology reports and bring her back in an interval of several weeks for excision of the paraduodenal mass.
