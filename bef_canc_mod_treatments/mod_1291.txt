Pleural thickening and enhancement around a partially loculated right pleural effusion, probably due to chronic pleural effusion but which can be seen complex pleural effusions.
Status post esophageal stent placement.
Small left pleural effusion stable  [**2197-5-2**] Ba swallow : Small quantity of extravasation of Omnipaque elicited only during retrograde filling of the esophageal stent with slow passage of small amount of contrast through to the adjacent surgical drain.
Stable ectatic aorta with extensively ulcerative calcified and non-calcified plaque.
If there is a history of malignancy, an MRI can be considered for further evaluation.
Unchanged appearance of the esophageal stent and fluid filled esophagus.
[**2197-5-12**] G/J tube study : 30 mL of Gastrografin was injected into the J-tube.
[**2197-5-13**] CXR :  Again seen is left-sided PICC line with tip over proximal SVC, bilateral L>R effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation, and upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora, consistent with CHF.
He gradually became more hypotensive, required more fluid resuscitation and pressor support and was admitted to the SICU in preparation for emergent surgery due to intra abdominal sepsis.
He was given broad spectrum antibiotics and emergently taken to the Operating Room where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy and repair of a Colles staple line perforation.
He returned to the SICU with an open abdomen, requiring volume resuscitation and pressors.
He eventually became hemodynamically stable off of pressors and was taken back to the OR for abdominal closure and G/J tube placement on [**2197-4-10**].
His abdomen was essentially closed except for the skin and he underwent saline damp to dry dressing changes.
He was extubated easily post op but developed bilateral pleural effusions which required pigtail catheter drainage.
He remained NPO and was fed via his J tube.
A EGD was done on [**2197-4-25**] and an esophageal stent was placed to obliterate the leak.
He also had a right pleural pigtail catheter placed for drainage of a right effusion.
His nutritional status was maintained with J tube feedings to meet 100% of his requirements.
An esophageal stent was placed within the prior stent.
He was placed on Zosyn and Fluconazole and a PICC line was also placed as access was a problem.
During his episodes of sepsis he developed some SVT then bradycardic episodes while on atenolol which he was on pre op.
The Cardiology service evaluated him on multiple occasions and recommended keeping him on Atenolol 25 mg daily which has helped to control his SVT.
His urologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**University/College **] Vangard in [**Location (un) 1468**] and he has been awaiting treatment for his prostate cancer which was recently diagnosed.
He will follow up with him after discharge from rehab and in the interim hopefully he will have a successful voiding trial after he is more ambulatory.
He had some trouble with thin liquids but tolerates pureed solids and nectar thick liquids without difficulty.
His room air saturations are 97% but he still gets nebulizer treatments to help him cough up secretions.
His J tube is clamped during the say and he receives cyclic tube feedings at night.
His abdominal wounds are healing well and he is working well with physical therapy to increase his mobility and endurance.

You required an operation to repair a small hole in your esophagus and you spent many days in the ICU as you required special medications, antibiotics and a breathing tube.
The stent will need to be removed in a few weeks to assess the healing of your esophagus *A feeding tube was placed in the Operating Room so that you can get all of your nutrition thru it.
* Your antibiotics will continue through [**2197-5-22**] * The urinary catheter will remain in place until you are more ambulatory then a voiding trial will be attempted again.
Department: ENDO SUITES When: MONDAY [**2197-6-5**] at 8:30 AM for EGD and possible stent removal.
