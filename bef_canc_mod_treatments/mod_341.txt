The patient reports that he was in his usual state of health until approximately two weeks prior to the admission, at which time he had hematochezia that led to the loss of approximately two liters of blood, Medical Intensive Care Unit admission, and emergent placement of TIPS following hemodynamic stabilization.
Genotype 1A, diagnosed in [**2120**].
Treated with regulated Interferon as well as Vibrovirin for 12 weeks with failure to eradicate the virus.

LABORATORY FINDINGS:  On admission, alpha-fetoprotein 12.3.
Hematocrit 33.4 with three plus macrocytosis and two plus anisocytosis.
While in the Emergency Room, the patient was seen by the GI fellow and due to the fact that the patient was hemodynamically stable, his melena subsided and hematocrits remained at approximately 30, the decision was made not to start Octreotide.
The patient was continued on his Protonix and all the medications that could effect his blood pressure including Nadolol and Aldactone were held.
He was transfused another unit of packed red blood cells on his way to Interventional Radiology for revision of his TIPS.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Following additional treatment with packed red blood cells the patient's hematocrit remained at 32.
He was restarted on his outpatient medications with blood pressures in the 120s.
Status post variceal bleed times two.
Status post transfusion of four units of packed red blood cells.
Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o.
