The pt underwent a TEE to rule out thrombi in the heart [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] and underwent successful cardioversion on [**2111-11-20**].
He stated his SOB was improved s/p cardioversion and he was discharged in stable condition in sinus rhythm and without complaints.
The patient was scheduled for a pulmonary vein isolation on the day of admission.
He underwent endarterectomy of the LCF with bovine patch with a drain left in place.
In the CCU, patient arrived intubated on propofol, dopamine 6 mcg/kg/min and neo 0.3 mcg/kg/min from the OR.
ROS was unable to be obtained because he was intubated and sedated.

ACUTE CARE #Left femoral artery repair - Pt initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for a PVI for refractory Afib.
The beginning of the procedure was complicated by inadvertent arterial puncture x3 in the left groin.
Pressure was applied and vascular surgery was consulted.
He was taken for surgical repair of the left common femoral, superficial femoral, and profunda femoris arteries with bovine patch amgioplasty.
A JP drain was initially placed and was subsequently removed after drainage had slowed.
There was evidence of a seroma after the drain was removed which was managed conservatively.
#Hypotension - Upon presentation to the CCU, he was hypotensive and briefly required dopamine and phenylepherine to maintain his MAP >60.
The hypotension was thought to be related to the sedation used during his procedure and subsequent surgery, he did not appear hypovolemic and there was no evidence of cardiogenic shock.
#Rhythm/atrial fibrillation (CHADS2=2) - Pt has refractory AF with multiple prior cardioversions and trial of many antiarrhythmics, including amiodarone.
In an attempt to chemically convert him to NSR, he was started on doeftilide after a TEE was negative for thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] RA.
He was anticoagulated with dabigatran after the femoral artery repair operation.
His ASA and Plavix were initially held after the arterial puncture with repair, but were restarted after discussion with vascular surgery.
#Mental status changes - On hospital day 5, after transfer from the CCU to the floor, he was noted to appear more confused and was using words inappropriately.
This concern was also dismissed and the prevailing theory was that his mental status changes were a result of delirium from a combination of oxazepam and ambien.
#Dilated cardiomyopathy (EF=15-20%) - He initially appeared volume overloaded on exam and his family gave a history of worsening dyspnea and LE edema prior to presentation (patient was intubated and initially unable to provide history).
He was treated with a lasix drip at admission and diuresed well.
After the lasix drip was stopped, we slowly added back his home dose of oral lasix as his blood pressure tolerated.
CHRONIC CARE #Hypertension - He was hypotensive upon arrival to the CCU and, as above, his Coreg, ramipril and eleprenone were initially held.
These were slowly restarted and at discharge he will continue on his home regimen except a decreased dose of carvedilol.
#Hypothyroidism - Continued on levothyroxine 50mcg daily.
#Hyperlipidemia - Continued atorvastatin and Zetia  #COPD - Noted on CT scan prior to admission, not reporting any wheezing at admission.
He does not take any medications at home  TRANSITIONS IN CARE: #Code status this admission - FULL CODE # Contact: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] (wife, [**Name (NI) 382**] - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 101485**] #Transitional issues: -Will need follow-up of pulmonary nodules in 1 year -Dofetilide management -Sleep study and fitting of face mask #Pending Studies: Carotid ultrasounds  Medications on Admission: 1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable  PO DAILY (Daily).

You were admitted for a pulmonary vein isolation to treat your atrial fibrillation.
The procedure was aborted because the femoral artery was accessed.
You were then started on dofetilide.
Please note the following changes to your medications: - START dofetilide - START Cefpedoxime for 5 more days - START Potassium - CHANGE carvedilol to 3.125mg twice a day - CHANGE Lasix 120mg each morning; 80mg each evening - CHANGE ramipril to 2.5mg daily - STOP amiodarone - CONTINUE the remainder of your medications as directed  Please be sure to follow up with your physicians.
