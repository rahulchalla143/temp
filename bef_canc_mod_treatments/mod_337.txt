ETT performed on [**5-/2103**] demonstrated: This 76 yo man (s/p stent amd pacemaker '[**00**]; CVA '[**02**]) was referred to the lab for CAD evaluation (viability; ischemia).
The patient was administered 5 ug (5 min stage), 10, 20, 30 and 40 ug/kg/min (3 min stages) of Dubutamine for a total infusion duration of 17 minutes.
The ECG is unintepretable secondary to AV paced rhythm.
At mid-dose dobutamine [20 mcg/kg/min; heart rate = 69 bpm, blood pressure =  178/86 mmHg), there was augmentation of the basal inferoposterolateral wall and anterior wall.
Left ventriculography revealed a moderately severe anterolateral and apical hypokinesis, with posterobasal and inferior akinesis.
CXR [**10-11**] AP UPRIGHT CHEST:  The patient is status post median sternotomy.
The thoracic aorta is somewhat tortuous, but unchanged given differences in technique.
No definite change in the cardiac or mediastinal contour from prior studies given differences in technique.
He was continued on aspirin, statin, and a beta-blocker.
The day after presentation, the patient received a persantine MIBI which was found to have EF of 35% and a mild inferior wall defect thought to be secondary to attenuation.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] also has a h/o AV block and AFib s/p PPM; he was monitored on telemetry and had no significant events during his admission.
# Acute renal failure Patient has baseline creatinine 1.0-1.4, found to be 1.7 on admission.
He received gentle IV fluids and urine was sent for electrolytes and eosinophils.
