A left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending into the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus.
[**5-22**] IR guided left sided PICC (also had right sided PICC placed and removed, then left sided IR guided PICC placed and removed, and then finally this PICC) IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided 4 French single lumen PICC line placement via the left brachial venous approach.

# Unresolved leukocytosis: The patient presented with a WBC of 17, which downtrended with blood and was initially attributed to bone marrow stress response but then attributed to infection with resolution of the leukocytosis on both GP and GN/Anaerobic antimicrobial coverage.
He is discharged on antibiotics and plans to follow WBC closely in rehab.
**The patient will follow-up with his PCP to discuss goals of care and whether further diagnostic procedures are warranted, including potential consultation with surgical oncology.
# Lower GI Bleed: Presenting Hct was 18, was transfused 4 units of blood in the ICU, and transferred to the floor after reassuring trends were demonstrated in lactate and pre-renal [**Last Name (un) **]; the floorm Hct remained stable until the end of the hospitalization, when the patient required an additional unit for a Hct of 22 with subsequent Hct appropriately increased and stable on discharge.
The patient was discharged with follow-up with the GI department for further management of the bleed.
[**Last Name (un) **] was attributed to nephrotoxicity from a brief interval on Gentamycin, with urine lytes ruling out pre-renal and the patient being clinically euvolemic thereby lowering the possibility of decreased effective circulatory volume.
EP was consulted and deferred removal of the pacemaker, deciding instead to treat and reassess at a later time.
The patient was treated with Vancomycin, Gentamycin, and Rifampin before being transitioned to Daptomycin due to nephrotoxicity of Gentamycin in the setting of a delicate fluid balance.
Discharged on Daptomycin for a total course of 6 weeks with follow-up with ID and EP.
# GNR, Klebsiella PNA bacteremia: After an interval of sterile blood cultures, the patient grew out one culture of K.PNA and was started on Zosyn before being narrowed to Cipro/Flagyl PO.
Anticoagulation was deferred in absence of good data on this clinical scenario and clear contraindications - GI bleed.
# Superficial thrombophlebitis R forearm: Resolved with removal of the line and hot packs.
Remained on diuretic pre-hospitalization diuretic regimen, with Torsemide intermittently held for BP < 100 and BP medications held in the acute setting of GI bleed.
# Cough: Presented with an long standing cough attributed to bronchitis; treated with 5 days of Azithromycin without significant improvemend.
It was restarted on discharge.
