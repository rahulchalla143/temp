Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 27785**] was taken to the operating room on [**2182-12-9**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] where she underwent EGD with dilation for her esophageal stricture and rigid bronchoscopy with cryoablation of the granulation tissue surrounding the left main stem stent.
She recovered in the PACU, but over the evening developed respiratory distress, therefore was admitted under Thoracic surgery and stayed in PACU with Bipap.
Her respiratory status improved with bipap, albuterol, and morphine.
She was observed and in the morning, after examination by IP attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the Thoracic surgery service, and review of chest xray, the patient was deemed stable for discharge home.
