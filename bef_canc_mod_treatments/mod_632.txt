When BPs were lower (see below) patient's BP meds were held occasionally, but as she was transfused and the BPs started to trend back up the meds were re-initiated.
BP meds were held and then re-initiated as the pressure came back up once she was able to eat.
At first the pain resolved and she was continued on her outpatient regimen of: 2-4 mg po dilaudid q4 h as needed.
She was placed on IV PPI and transfused two units of blood.
GI felt that the patient would need general anesthesia in order to undergo an EGD which showed an ulcer at the GE junction.
She was started on empiric treatment for H. Pylori and serologies were sent which came back negative so the antibiotics were stopped.
Her pain was controlled with her outpatient regimen of PO dilaudid.
she was started on reglan and continued on zofran and compazine PRN howeve she continued to have n/v.
Surgery was consulted, NGT was placed, she was made NPO and serial abdominal exams were done.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated (vanc ctx) at meningeal dosing.
She improved over the next few days and antibiotics were discontinued because the suspicion for a bacterial meningitis was low.
Seizure: This occured in the setting of fever, hypotension, and initiation of reglan for vomiting.
Neurology was consulted and felt she should be continued on keppra indefinitely.
She should be continued on keppra 1gm with dialysis three times weekly.

After EGD the coumadin was re-started at 3mg daily however, in setting of poor po intake her INR was supratherapeutic - likely [**2-12**] nutritional deficiency of vitamin k. coumadin will be restarted when INR [**2-13**] at dialysis.
# OSA: She is on CPAP at a setting of 7 as an outpatient.
OB/GYN service was called re: doing colposcopy in hospital as patient rarely makes o/p appointments, hwoever they do not do this procedure in hospital especially because it does not have to be done emergently - just within one year.
Will need outpatient colposcopy at some point in next few months as they do not do this procedure in the hospital.
