Brief Hospital Course: 47 year old man with diastolic congestive heart failure, hypertension, pre-diabetes, obesity hypoventilation syndrome and severe obstructive sleep apnea, presented from his skilled nursing facility for hypoxia.
He was given albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments for possible bronchospasm (he may have underlying obstructive component, possibly asthma, although recent pulmonary function tests would be needed to confirm this), 80mg IV lasix, and was placed on his home Bipap settings overnight.
He reported improvement in his shortness of breath on the day of [**Month/Day/Year **] and was at baseline for his oxygen requirements and saturations.
We discussed placement of a tracheostomy tube as a means of a more effective therapy for his severe hypoventilation and obstructive sleep apnea, however, the patient declined.
