After the LAD stent, the patient was continued on aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor for treatment of coronary artery disease.
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed.
He responded well to Lasix diuresis with decreased wedge pressure and increased cardiac index.
The patient was restarted on Metoprolol and Hydralazine when the blood pressure could tolerate it.
These medications were titrated up to their maximum doses after the patient became hypertensive post extubation on [**10-28**].
Prior to discharge, he was evaluated by the cardiothoracic surgery service for future aortic valve replacement.
PULMONARY:  The patient was maintained on a ventilator for the first several days of stay in the ICU.
The oxygenation improved with diuresis and the ventilator was weaned and discontinued on [**10-28**].
The patient was treated for the pneumonia with a course of Ceftazidime and Vancomycin, which was changed to IV Levofloxacin and the cultures did not grow organisms.
He was noted to drain preferentially out of his right nephrostomy tube, but that he did drain out of the suprapubic tube as well.
He had been started on Vancomycin and a ten-day course of this was completed at [**Hospital1 188**].
The patient also completed a course of Ceftazidime/Levofloxacin for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia as above.
