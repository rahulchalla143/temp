His mental status/somnolence and hypercarbia improved after BiPAP set at 18/10 4L O2.
#CKD - his creatinine did rise from 1.2 on admission to 1.7 with diuresis in the ICU.
Potentially nephrotoxic meds were held,  #MGUS: f/u on UPEP  #HTN: continue home meds  #Nutrition consult for obesity/dietary input.
# Acute on chronic respiratory failure requiring ICU stay but not intubation - MICU team felt COPD exacerbation main component and started high dose steroids, Abx, nebulized bronchodilators - no evidence of bronchospasm on my exam - am tapering steroids rapidly -D/C levofloxacin - wean O2 to maintain sats 88-92%, down to home flow of 2L/min via NC.
Check ambulatory sats - OSA likely large component - needs to wear BiPAP at night.
-FeNa yesterday = 0.95%, suggesting pre-renal azotemia but creatinine continues to increase despite IV hydration and holding ACE-I -no evidence of urinary retention (PVR < 350) -He was seen in consultation by Nephrology on [**2195-10-12**], and they agreed with trial of IV hydration and with holding the ace-inhibitor and the diuretic.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure -last echo in [**2195-6-24**] showed right heart failure (likely due to chronic lung disease and resulting pulmonary hypertension) but preserved LV function -no evidence of acute HF now - received torsemide inthe ICU with resulting decrease in BNP, but increase in creatinine - on the floor, we held off on further diuresis -there was no peripheral edema .
Lisinopril D/C'd in the setting of rising creatinine .
# MGUS: Patient has been on bortezomib and velcade to treat MGUS-associated VWd and subsequent GIB.
