Brief Hospital Course: 68 year-old man with a history of hepatitis C/cirrhosis/hepatocellular carcinoma s/p cadaveric liver transplant in [**1-/2118**], also with a h/o CAD s/p RCA and LAD stenting, dementia and recent admission for pneumonia, now presenting with a 1-day history of fever, hypoxia and mental status changes.
1) Fever: A CXR on admission was suspicious for a RLL infiltrate (atelectasis versus pneumonia), and Mr. [**Known lastname 111034**] was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin, Flagyl and Ceftazidime pending culture data.
In light of these results, Vancomycin was D/C'd on [**2120-1-11**], and Cipro was added for double gram negative coverage pending final organism identification and sensitivites.
Hence, Ceftazidime and Flagyl were D/C'd on [**2120-1-12**], and Imipenem was started.
The patient defervesced on the above antibiotherapy, and plan is to complete a 14-day course of Imipenem monotherapy (last doses on [**2120-1-25**]).
He was transferred back to the floor on [**2120-1-12**] on supplemental oxygen 4L via NC.
A CXR on [**2120-1-11**] was consistent with mild CHF, and Mr. [**Known lastname 111034**] was gently diuresed while on the floor with Lasix 20 mg IV prn with goal negative 500cc/day, with good response.
He will need continued chest physiotherapy as an out-patient.
Both Metoprolol and Captopril were titrated up, with improved blood pressure control, although systolic blood pressure remains elevated at discharge (130-160).
Regimen at discharge includes Metoprolol 100 mg PO TID and Captopril 50 mg PO TID.
4) CAD: Patient with known CAD s/p RCA and LAD stenting in 2/[**2117**].
Aspirin therapy was resumed (stopped for an unclear reason during a prior admission) after confirming with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**].
5) Status post liver transplant: Patient on Tacrolimus therapy 1.5 mg PO BID with goal trough [**5-5**].
6) DM type 2: While in hospital, Avandia was held and patient was kept on a regular insulin sliding scale, with fair glycemic control.
Avandia 8 mg PO QAM resumed on [**2120-1-18**].
Of note, prior to admission, patient started on Sinemet and ?
Ritalin [**Hospital1 **], and unclear if Prozac D/C'd.
While in hospital, he was continued on Fluoxetine.
Will discharge on Fluoxetine and Sinemet, and leave it to his PCP to decide re: Ritalin.
8) FEN: While in the ICU, a bedside swallowing evaluation and video swallowing revealed aspiration with thin liquids but adequate swallowing with pureed foods/nectar-thick liquids consistency.
After discussion with the patient and his wife, a post-pyloric feeding tube was placed and tube feeds initiated on [**2120-1-16**].
Unfortunately, patient removed tube on [**2120-1-17**].
Hence, the feeding tube was not replaced and MR. [**Known lastname 111034**] was discharged on PO feeds.
