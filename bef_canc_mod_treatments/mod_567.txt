This was managed with a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube by one of my colleagues prior to his care being turned over to myself.
He required ICU care and multiple antibiotic courses for bacteremia and sepsis.
The percutaneous cholecystostomy tube did have to be replaced secondary to this being displaced.
He has some baseline renal insufficiency, but did require CVVH and then dialysis during his hospital stay.
He was admitted for planned laparoscopic cholecytectomy.

The specimen is then represented as follows: A = cystic duct mucosa and sections of gallbladder wall, B = additional sections of gallbladder wall.
The left kidney measures 10.6 cm.
On [**2166-8-8**], the patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor tolerating a clear liquid diet, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter and JP drain in place, and Percocet PO and Morphine IV PRN for pain control.
He received two doses of IV Ciprofloxacin peri-operatively.
Failed to void after foley discontinued; foley replaced.
Lasix discontinued.
Again required restraints and frequent re-orientation.
Diuresis with Lasix continued.
Transferred back to floor NPO except medications, on IV fluids, oral medications, and a foley catheter in place.
Started on IV Levofloxacin.
Foley discontinued; voided adequately.
Urine culture revealed VRE UTI senstive to Linazolid; started on Linezolid for 2 week course.
Continued on Levofloxacin and Linezolid.
