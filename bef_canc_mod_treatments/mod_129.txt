Right hip XR [**5-13**]: Two frontal radiographs of the right hip are obtained in relatively similar positioning.
A small amount of penetration and aspiration was noted with thin liquids.
Left PICC withdrawn, tip now in the left subclavian vein.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo M with severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation on coumadin transferred from OSH with respiratory failure and hypovolemic shock s/p stabilization with course c/b delirium, aspiration pneumonia, deconditioning and dehydration.
Patient required intubation early in his hospital course and had several episodes of apnea, which were felt to be due to sedation (fentanyl, midazolam).
These episodes stopped after these medications were held.
Several days thereafter, the patient was noted to be tachpneic with leukocytosis which improved with treatment of hospital acquired pneumonia.
C-scope was not done as patient had outpatient c-scope 1 month ago showing only polyps.
His coumadin and aspirin were held and stopped indefinately given the severe, life-threatening nature of his bleed.
# s/p Right parietal CVA.
not candidate for lysis, anticoagulation at this time).
was not deemed a candidate for anticoagulation given lifethreatening GIB, despite a very high risk for a recurrent CVA (CHADS = 6, ~ 20% risk of CVA within a year).
Patient was off coumadin in the setting of acute GI bleed.
CHADS2 score 6 -> ~ 20% risk of recurrence of a CVA within one year.
Patient was continued on Carvedilol.. .
Patient's fluid balance was tenuous and he required lasix dose titration as well as holding lasix for several days in the setting of orthostasis.
He should be restarted on lasix 80mg PO BID on the day after discharge.
He was kept on his coreg and Low dose ACEI was added to his regimen .
No pain evident w/ flex/ext/abd/add/rotation and plain films of hip and ankle were unrevealing.
Given variable PO intake, standing insulin was stopped and a low dose, prn sliding scale was used.
He will likely need addition of a long-acting insulin such as lantus/glargine once his PO intake becomes more reliable.
Longstanding hypertension treated with carvedilol.
Lisinopril 2.5mg was added for its cardioprotective effects as above.
