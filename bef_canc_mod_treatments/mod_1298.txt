HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was deemed hemodynamically stable by the Surgery Team, and it was felt that an emergent segmental colectomy was the optimal treatment.
The patient was taken to the operating room to undergo a segmental colectomy removing the left transverse segment, splenic flexure, and left colon.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged to the PACU in stable condition.
For prophylaxis, the patient was placed on Kefzol and Flagyl.
No interventions were undertaken at that time; however, it was decided that BiPAP support would be administered if the acidosis persisted.
