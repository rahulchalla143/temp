In [**Month (only) 205**] he had a lower gastrointestinal bleed on coumadin and work-up revealed an adenocarcinoma.
Given his critical aortic stenosis, he underwent an aortic valvuloplasty so that he could undergo a hemicolectomy.
Postoperative course was complicated by heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
He was evaluated by cardiac surgery and deemed to be of prohibitive extreme surgical risk for conventional surgical AVR.
He is admitted for transfemoral TAVR procedure.

: none   Brief Hospital Course: 89 year old gentleman with history of severe aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation on low dose coumadin, systolic CHF (EF 45-50%), h/o DVT, HIT, GI bleed on coumadin and colon CA s/p resection came to [**Hospital1 18**] for a corevalvae for severe aortic stenosis.
# Severe aortic stenosis: [**Location (un) 109**] 0.4cm2, peak gradient 60mmHg prior to corevalve.
The corevalve procedure was uncomplicated (please see the results section for detail on the procedure) He was extubated the evening after the procedure.
He was on neosynephrine the day after the procedure but that was discontinued the next day.
He was discharged on an increased dose of Metoprolol succinate 100 mg daily and a decreased dose of Lisinopril 10 mg daily (from 40 mg).
His lasix 120 mg daily was also held as patient was euvolemic during hospital course after the procedure.
# Bradycardia: Noted to have bradycardia in the 30s prior to corevalve placement, so opted to have permanent pacemaker placed during corevalve procedure.We gave him cefazolin 2g IV q8H for 3 days as per protocol for placing a pacemaker.
Lisinopril management as above.
# Atrial fibrillation:  At home he is rate controlled with metoprolol and anticoagulated with coumadin at home.
His metoprolol was held at first and then we started him back on it.
We also gave him  IV metoprolol 2.5mg boluses PRN for HR >100 though when his PO metoprolol dose was increased heh no longer needed those doses.
He was successfully bridged back to coumadin and is being discharged on 5 mg daily.
Differential included: blood loss from hematuria vs hemolytic anemia from corevalve causing shearing of RBCs vs GIB (though he has adenocarcinoma s/p colectomy GIB unlikely bc he did not have bowelmovements) vs TTP (he did have low platlets as well however his kidney function, mental status were fine he has no fever either).
He has h/o HIT however he was not been given any heparin, not even heparin flushes while in house.
He was not been given thiazides or sulfa medications which are also known to cause HIT.
We continued to monitor his platlets and there was no further acute drop  # H/o HIT: Bivalrudin used in the peri-op period rather than heparin, however it was stopped.
Patient was given no heparin products while here.
He was given plavix and ASA as dual antiplatelets  CHRONIC ISSUES:  #BPH: patients tamsulosin was restarted soon after the procedure  #GERD: continued omeprazole  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # patient will follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding how he is doing post-corevalve.
# Discharged on lower dose of lisinopril than admitted with.
Needs cardiology f/u for uptitration  # Also needs f/u for his lasix 120 mg daily that was being held in the hospital.
This will be followed up in the outpatient settingwith Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]   Medications on Admission: FINASTERIDE -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 5 mg tablet - 1 tablet(s) by mouth daily FUROSEMIDE -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 40 mg tablet - 3 tablet(s) by mouth daily 120mg daily HERBAL LAXATIVE -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) -   - 2 tabs daily LISINOPRIL -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 40 mg tablet - 1 tablet(s) by mouth daily METOPROLOL SUCCINATE -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 50 mg tablet extended release 24 hr - 1 tablet(s) by mouth DAILY (Daily) OMEPRAZOLE -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 20 mg capsule,delayed release(DR/EC) - 1 Capsule(s) by mouth DAILY (Daily) POTASSIUM CHLORIDE [KLOR-CON 10] -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 10 mEq tablet extended release - 1 tablet(s) by mouth daily TAMSULOSIN -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 0.4 mg capsule,extended release 24hr - 1 Capsule(s) by mouth DAILY (Daily) WARFARIN [COUMADIN] -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 4 mg tablet - 1 tablet(s) by mouth Once Daily at 4 PM dose daily based on INR goal of [**1-17**]  Medications - OTC CALCIUM CARBONATE [ANTACID] -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 200 mg calcium (500 mg) tablet, chewable - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth three times a day COENZYME Q10 [CO Q-10] -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 300 mg capsule - 1 capsule(s) by mouth daily  Discharge Medications: 1.
