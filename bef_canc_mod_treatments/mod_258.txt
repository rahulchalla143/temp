Admission Date:  [**2159-4-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-5-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-8-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfonamides  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15519**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: picc line placement thoracentesis chest tube placement  History of Present Illness: 73year old man with history of right non-small cell lung ca s/p pneumonetctomy, COPD, hypertension, sick sinus syndrome s/p [**First Name3 (LF) 4448**] and ICD placement, BPH, and depression presenting with shortness of breath.
Extensive work up at that time included cardiac catheterization which showed total occlusion of RCA, although no intervention was done.
He underwent thoracentesis on [**2159-4-25**]; 1300cc bloody fluid was drained.
He was subsequently intubated and started on empiric antibiotics for a suspected pneumonia.
He also became hypotensive after receiving sedation for intubation and was transiently on pressor support.
He remained intubated with difficulty to wean from ventilator.
He underwent repeat thoracentesis to r/o empyema/help improve respiratory status, which revealed a chylous effusion thought to be due to disruption of thoracic duct during his lobectomy in [**2158-9-27**].
A chest tube was placed with persistent output.
On [**2159-5-8**], chest tube was changed from suction to wet seal.
The patient was started on TPN which theoretically will decrease chylothorax.
He was continued on inhalers for treatment of his COPD.
The chylous effusion was followed by the pulmonary team, who recommended the patient be kept NPO and be treated with 2weeks of TPN.
As a result, thoracic surgery was consulted and performed a mechanical pleurodesis.
In the SICU, the patient developed a respiratory acidosis and was intubated and extubated on [**2159-5-22**].
SICU course was also notable for complicated left subclavian central venous access attempt with cannulation of the subclavian artery resulting in signficant bleeding and requiring vascular consultation.
He was seen by plastic surgery, who recommended treatment with oxacillin which was discontinued.
There were no plans for further surgery by the plastics team.
He continued to have wound care addressed by the wound care service.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for re-accumulating / expanding effusion s/p chest tube to water seal.
SINGLE UPRIGHT PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The patient is status post right pneumonectomy, with associated thoracic wall changes and shift of midline structures to the right.
A left-sided [**Year (4 digits) 4448**], median sternotomy wires, and wires in the mid-right chest are unchanged.
HISTORY: 73-year-old man status post right pneumonectomy with respiratory distress.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector axial images of the chest were obtained with IV contrast.
CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient is status post right pneumonectomy.
The left sided chest tubes remain in unchanged position and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
S/P right sided pneumonectomy and left sided permanent pacer with dual electrode system unchanged.
NG tube reaches far below diaphragm as before.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 73 year old male with a history of NSCLC s/p right pneumonectomy, chemo/XRT and COPD, presenting with dyspnea, transferred from thoracic surgical service after VATS/mechanical pleurodesis for chylous pleural effusion.
They placed a chest tube and recommended TPN with octretide to help decrease tryglyceride intake and chylous output.
a PICC line was placed in the left upper extremity on [**2159-5-16**], and TPN was begun on [**2159-5-17**].
The plan was for pleurodesis when drainage was <100 to <125 cc/ day.
However, as mentioned, the CT continued to put out a significant amount of fluid and as a result, the patient was transferred to the thoracics service where he underwent a VATS and talc pleurodesis on [**2159-5-18**].
The chest tube was pulled [**2159-5-23**] with post xray showing possible small apical left pneumothorax.
Thoracic surgery signed off prior to discharge and recommended continued dry dressings to the chest tube site.
# COPD: He was continued on atrovent and albuterol inharlers per his outpatient regimen.
He was diuresed to euvolemia after receiving fluids in the MICU and ED for resuscitation.
Given his elevated bicarb, he was started on diomax in addition to the lasix.
Beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor held due to blood pressure.
Once stabilized, he will likely be restarted on these medicaitons and statin.
# Back wound from previous pneumenctomy:  The wound was growing MSSA and patient was started in oxacillin (started on [**2159-5-5**]).
Duration of treatment was determined by wound response, and we monitored LFTs q 3-4 days while on oxacillin.
Oxacillin  was discontinued [**2159-5-14**].
For details of wound care recc's, please see page 1 summary.
# Right upper extremity DVT:  Given the the patient's tenuous status and history of coffee-ground emesis, and low risk of PE and stroke with upper extremity clot no anticoagulation was initiated.
He will be referred to GI for colonoscopy and further work-up once his acute pulmonary issues resolve.
He will continue with physical therapy at [**Hospital3 **] for further care.
he should continue on a low triglyceride diet.
