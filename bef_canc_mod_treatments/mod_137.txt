Cardiomegaly, pleural and pericardial effusion as well as ascites could represent congestive cardiac failure.
There is mostly left-to-right shunting, but after injection of aerated saline into the right atrium, right-to-left bubble transit is seen, as well.
Endotracheal tube extends into the main stem bronchus.
MRI/MRA brain [**5-13**] - MRI of the Brain: The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation of the brain is well preserved.
MRA OF THE BRAIN: The anterior circulation including the intracranial internal carotid artery, anterior and middle cerebral arteries bilaterally appear normal.
Whether this is related to sleep deprivation or medications that the patient is taking or represents an early encephalopathy cannot be determined from this record.
EKG [**6-1**] - Compared to prior tracing irregular sinus mechanism at rate about 55 has replaced atrial flutter.
She was refusing NGT and PEG was contraindicated with her ascites.
After admission and ICU course: Admitted to floor after dialysis [**12-27**] somnolence.
Transferred to MICU after only a few hrs [**12-27**] [**Month/Day (2) **].
Pt was emperically treated w/ Vanc/Meropenem, then was switched to cefepime for possible PNA (now s/p 10-D course).
Pt also has a L-sided chronic pleural effusion (exudative), pt is s/p thoracentesis of 1.5 L w/ exudate, but no infection.
Pt had a possible seizure during thoracentesis, so she was intubated and started on neosynepherine.
HSV PCR was negative and acyclovir was stopped..  Pt has gone in and out of aflutter, but was transfered to the floor in sinus rhythm with 2-3 beat runs of NSVT.
Pt was on heparin ggt briefly but this has been stopped.
She was extubated on [**2156-5-16**], and has been off pressors since [**2156-5-17**].
Has NGT and on tube feeds.
She had pulled out her NG tube and kept not cooperating for replacement.
She was unable to get a PEG tube d/t ascites.
Pt believed to have seizure during thoracotomy as stated above.
Likely cause of mental status changes was multifactorial - including metabolic derangements from kidney and liver disease.
# [**Month/Year (2) **]: Unclear etiology, originally thought due to possible pneumonia, as stated above, pt required pressers in ICU.
Pt treated with empiric vancomycin and meropenem (switched from imipenem due to lower seizure threshold from imipenem)for 10 day course.
Pt was monitored on telemetry and had intermitenty ectopic beats, NSVT up to 3 beats, which may have been related to hypokalemia.
Pt was started on metoprolol.
Metoprolol was stopped at this time and she was not discharge .
During this stay, thoracentesis was performed but resulted in intubation as stated above.
# Hyperlipidemia: statin was held in setting of transaminitis.
# ESRD/HD: On HD MWF.
Pt will need to continue HD upon discharge MWFs for fluid status management.
On the day of admission, pt was given 4 packets of neutrapohs.
Continued to have episodes of hypoglycemia while on floor and there was no way to have nutritional support (no NGT or PEG and somnelent).
She passed a speech/swallow test and was started on ground food and thin liquids.
Day 1 of antibiotics was [**2156-5-30**].
She was still having diarrhea at the time, but no white count, fevers or abdominal pain.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for being somnulent after a dialysis session.
The medical team tried to get the fluid off of your lung with a procedure called a thoracentesis.
During this your blood pressure became very low and you had to go to the ICU where they kept your blood pressure high with IV medicine and helped you breathe with intubation.
You will continue physical therapy in rehab to try to regain your strength.
