Brief Hospital Course: 56-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy w/ EF 20% s/p ICD, CAD s/p post stenting of the LAD and RCA, and pAF s/p multiple cardioversions (last [**1-8**]) on dofetilide admitted for worsening CHF; course complicated by hypervolemic hyponatremia.
He was admitted for worsening CHF and for upgrade of his single-lead pacer to a [**Hospital1 **]-V pacer.
On admission, patient was diuresed with a lasix drip at 5cc/hr with UOP 100+cc/hr.
He had a biventricular pacemaker placed on Friday ([**2112-1-15**]).
Lasix drip was stopped following marked improvement in volume status, and the patient was transitioned to torsemide by mouth.
24 hrs after cessation of lasix drip, the patient's ins and outs remained even, but he became increasingly volume overloaded with predominantly right-sided symptoms, and acutely worsening hyponatremia from 130 to 120.
He was restarted on a lasix drip that was titrated up to 12cc/hr with less responsive urine output (50-70cc/hr).
In the CCU, the patient began to diurese well with a lasix drip at 15cc/hr.
He diuresed to euvolemia, and was transitioned to lasix 120 mg PO BID.
During admission, ramipril held for acute kidney injury and eplerenone held for hyperkalemia.
Eplerenone was also resumed prior to discharge.

On admission, the patient was in a V-paced rhythm at 80 BPM.
The patient was treated with IV vancomycin x 2 days, and then transitioned to PO keflex x 5 days to complete 1 week course s/p pacemaker placement.
Digoxin was held for a supratherapeutic level in the setting of acute kidney injury.
Sodium improved to 130 with diuresis on a lasix drip.
Lasix drip was restarted, the patient was placed on a strict free-water restriction, and sodium began to slowly improve.
Ramipril was held due to [**Last Name (un) **].
Digoxin was also held, as it became supratherapeutic in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **].
The patient will follow up with his PCP on discharge for a creatinine check.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  Patient s/p multiple interventions to LAD and RCA.
The patient was continued on home levothyroxine.
No dose adjustments were made to the patient's levothyroxine given acute illness.
The patient was continued on home oxazepam.
He was discharged on home oxazepam and Ambien.
Prior to admission, wound was adhesed with dermabond and sutures.
He was continued on allopurinol throughout admission.
#CODE: full code ================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # Patient on levothyroxine with TSH 10 in setting of acute illness.
If persists as outpatient, may need higher dose of levothyroxine (dose not changed as inpatient in setting of illness) # Ramipril was held at discharge for acute kidney injury.
The patient should discuss reinitiation of this medication with PCP after BUN/Cr check.
# Digoxin was supratherapeutic during admission due to acute kidney injury.

To help manage your fluid overload, you were treated with a lasix drip.
Your breathing and leg swelling improved markedly.
Your pacemaker was also replaced with a [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacer to help the efficiency of your heart.
Your sodium improved with removal of fluid from your body and restricting your intake of fluid.
If you do not do this, your sodium could drop, and you could experience complications such as seizures.
Your fluid overload also caused temporary injury to your kidneys.
At discharge, you should stop taking your ramipril and digoxin because of your kidney function.
You can likely resume these medications in the near future.
Please discuss reinitiation of these medications with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**].
You should also decrease your allopurinol to 150 mg daily.
Please discuss increasing this medication with your primary care physician.
