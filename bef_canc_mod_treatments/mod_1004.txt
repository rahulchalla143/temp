Neuro: Patient was initially brought to the ICU for management of intracranial bleed and right sided weakness.
He received 2 units of FFP on [**1-8**] and another 2 units on [**1-9**] to correct INR of 2.1 for goal of 1.5-1.7.
Since his bleed was stable and since he will need continued long-term anticoagulation given his risk for ischemic [**Month/Year (2) **], it was decided not to give vitamin K, but rather to follow his INR and correct with FFP as needed.
After that time, coumadin should be restarted with goal INR 2-2.5.
His outpatient medications were used.
Lisinopril was increased to 10 mg, but now that his toprol xl has been increased to his home dose, it may be necessary to decrease his lisinopril again.
Cholesterol was excellent (total 152 LDL 74, HDL 62, TG 82), and lipitor was continued.
HgbA1C was 6.7, and his amaryl was continued, in addition to insulin sliding scale.
He was maintained on Dilantin 100mg PO TID for seizure prophylaxis given initial presentaion with possible right-sided shaking, and the cortical location of teh bleed.
ID: He was started on 14 day course of Levofloxacin 250 mg PO QD for possible aspiration pneumonia.
Cardiac: He has remained on cardiac telemetry and has had persistent atrial fibrillation with occasional sustained tachycardia to 117, exacerbated by dehydration, and requiring NS fluid boluses.
Patient has not received maintanence fluids given concern for fluid overload due to his baseline CHF.
Toprol XL was increased to home dose of 100mg to improve rate control.
His home dose of lasix for his CHF was held as he had elevated creatinine and was dehydrated.
ICU staff was unable to pass foley and urology called to perform flex cystoscopy and placement of foley over guidewire at bedside, and drained 900cc of urine from bladder.
Urology recommends that his foley remain in place for 5 days, and then he should have a voiding trial beginning at midnight.
