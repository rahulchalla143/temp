He was most recently discharged w/ a dx of vasovagal syncope with a increase in his bowel regimen, decrease in his metoprolol and plan for a two week course of ciprofloxacin for his pan-sensitive pseudomonal UTI (he has h/o recurrent UTIs including pseudomonal, proteus (R to cipro/bactrim/amp), enterococcus (R to tetracycline), and klebsiella).
His family reports that he left the hospital in excellent shape but has gradually deteriorated with weakness, lethargy and poor PO intake.
He has been continued on his 40 mg torsemide daily at the rehab, anti-hypertensives, and supplemental potassium.
He was also reportedly not behaving like himself- sleeping more, needing additional help with feedings and not oriented.
He was transitioned to 6L NC, but tired out so was put back on NRB then CPAP was started [**3-11**] tachypnea.
He was also given vancomycin, CTX and levofloxacin.

Limited view of right globe with suggestion of internal high density material, to be correlated clinically.
Collapsed thick-walled urinary bladder with internal debris.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo M w/ h/o COPD on 2L O2, cor pulmonale w/ severe RV diastolic dysfunction, OSA, R hemiparesis s/p CVA, and dementia who presented from [**Hospital1 1501**] w/ altered mental status in setting of hypoxia and hypernatremia.
Will continue on cipro through [**2179-4-3**] for treatment of previously diagnosed UTI.
He was then quickly transitioned to nasal cannula and by hospital day 2 was on his home oxygen requirement.
He was stable on this oxygen requirement on the floor.
Was on CPAP at night for OSA.
# Acute renal failure: Patient w/ baseline creatinine around 2.0 during last hospitalization, w/ elevation to 3.9 on admission.
Likely secondary to h/o poor po intake in setting of altered mental status, lack of access to free water, and continued use of diuretics and lisinopril.
Held diuretics and lisinopril and gave fluids as above with gradual improvement in creatinine.
Renal ultrasound was done which showed multiple bilateral up to 11-cm cysts, collapsed thick-walled urinary bladder with internal debris, but no hydronephrosis.
Patient was restarted on lisinopril.
Will resume decreased dose of torsemide, 20 mg daily.
No signs of infection (see above) and was maintained on broad spectrum abx.
Given recent exposure to heparin during last admission there was concern for HIT.
Heparin was stopped and HIT antibody was sent; this returned as equivocal.
He was placed on pneumoboots for DVT ppx.
Until results return, patient should not receive any heparin products.
He had no sign of thrombosis, and thus systemic anticoagulation was not given.
Was discharged on robust regimen of torsemide after BNP came back at over 20K during last hospitalization.
BNP improved at 17K and per records torsemide regimen was recently ramped up.
Torsemide will be restarted at 20mg daily, though patient will require ongoing assessment of his volume status at his facility, and may need increase in torsemide back to prior 40mg daily dose if weight increases or he develops signs/symptoms of worsening heart failure.
Continued home aspirin and metoprolol.
Restarted ACE inhibitor once renal function improved.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Patient was FULL CODE this admission, though per his wife they will likely continue discussion in outpatient setting about possible transition to hospice care -Patient should have repeat chem7 checked [**2179-4-3**] to ensure renal function remains stable at baseline and to assess electrolytes in setting of restarting torsemide -Patient will need ongoing monitoring of weight and daily fluid balance, and may need increase in torsemide dose to 40 mg daily if weight increasing.
Pending results, would hold all heparin products.
