Asymmetric soft tissue density in right supraclavicular region could be due to asymmetrical musculature but is difficult to distinguish from lymphadenopathy in the absence of intravenous contrast.
Right renal artery stent is present.
If nephrectomy was performed for renal cell carcinoma, followup CT with intravenous contrast would be recommended to exclude the possibility of metastatic lymphadenopathy.
Status post left nephrectomy and right renal artery stenting.
Limited images reveal hyperintense cerebral sulci, which could be due to be retained CT contrast given intravenously, considering the patient's renal failure          Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an elderly female who had undergone a left nephrectomy at an outside institution.

There are two general categories of kidney failure: acute and chronic.
The toxins that can trigger acute kidney failure include such medications such as antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and certain anesthetics.
At this point, the patient will need treatment -- either dialysis or a kidney transplant -- to stay alive.
