Initial concern for UTI given recent instrumentation of the bladder (bladder tear s/p repair in [**State 108**] recently) and dirty UA, but UCx was negative.
Patient noted to have elevated AP, as well as biliary sludge on Abd U/S and ?obstruction on CT abdomen, concerning for cholangitis, started on Zosyn for empiric coverage.
Patient had a biliary stent placed in the past for obstruction that migrated and was replaced in [**1-3**].
Hospital course at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] was complicated by hypotension (SBP 90s), for which the patient was given some gentle IVF with improvement of pressures.
He developed flash pulmonary edema and responded well to Lasix 20mg IV x1.
Patient was also delirious/agitated, given Ativan and Haldol prn.

- Pus, sludge, and debris was seen coming out of the bile duct after stent removal.
- Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
- Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification.
- A previously placed plastic stent was noted that had migrated well into the right hepatic duct/bilary tree - removal was not attempted given concurrent cholangitis.
- A 5cm by 10FR double pig tail biliary stent was placed successfully for decompression with the proximal end terminating in the left hepatic duct.
Good bile flow was seen after stent deployment.
Pneumobilia with double pigtail biliary stent with one end of the stent appearing to open within the duodenum and the other appears to end in the common bile duct.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old man with h/o CAD s/p MI [**2095**], Afib on Coumadin, CMP EF 45%, s/p AAA repair, PVD s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass, cognitive impairment, HTN, HLD, biliary obstruction s/p biliary stent placement and revision in [**2126**], who was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with altered mental status and fevers.
Patient had a prior h/o obstruction, s/p instrumentation with 2 stents currently in place.
He was originally supposed to get a stent removed in summer [**2126**], but as the pt spends part of the year in FL, this was lost to f/u.
During ERCP, a previously placed metal stent was removed; pus, sludge, and debris was seen coming out of the bile duct after stent removal.
A previously placed plastic stent had migrated into the right hepatic duct/bilary tree - removal was not attempted given concurrent cholangitis; a 5cm by 10FR double pig tail biliary stent was placed successfully for decompression with the proximal end terminating in the left hepatic duct.
Good bile flow was seen after stent deployment.
We continued antibiotics d1=[**4-16**] for a 14 day course, initially with zosyn and then with Augmentin (stop date [**2128-4-29**]).
# Intubation: Intubated for airway protection and ERCP, and was extubated without event.
He received 250 cc of normal saline and his creatinine improved slightly to 1.3.
Patient given another 250 cc of normal saline and his creatinine improved to 1.2.
Patient only given small boluses of iv fluids given report that he developed flash pulmonary edema with gentle hydration at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].
Altered mental status: Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, with agitation at OSH requiring ativan and haldol.
He was transferred to the ICU where he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc and zosyn).
Vancomycin was discontinued and the patient remained afebrile.
His Ace-I was restarted prior to discharge from the ICU.
Continued Metoprolol TID.
He was noted to have a large amount of ectopy and his dose was increased to 37.5 mg TID.
Coumadin was held for procedure, was restarted thereafter at a decreased dose of 1mg by mouth daily given history of supratherapeutic INR and concominant treatment with augmentin.
His dose of coumadin will likely need to be adjusted as an outpt.
CAD/PVD: Patient was off ASA since [**3-4**] for hematuria and bladder tear.
We  continued BB and restarted baby ASA after ERCP.
Continued BB and held Lisinopril initially given recent low BPs and [**Last Name (un) **].
He was then restarted on lisinopril 10mg by mouth daily.
TRANSITIONS OF CARE: -Pt's code status this admission was Full Code -Patient will be contact[**Name (NI) **] by the ERCP team for repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal -INR will need to be trended every other day given unstable INR and concurrent use of augmentin.
