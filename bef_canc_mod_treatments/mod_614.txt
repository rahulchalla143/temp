Patient was first seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**2164-3-26**], was felt to be in Class II to III heart failure, and felt to be fluid overloaded, so Lasix was increased from 40 [**Hospital1 **] to 80 [**Hospital1 **], and he was started on hydralazine 10 mg po tid for hypertension, given elevated creatinine at 2.0 and previous worsening renal failure with ACE inhibitor.
The patient elected to remain outpatient, where Lasix was increased to 120 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Hydralazine was discontinued.
He apparently lost 4 pounds inpatient, and he was discharged on [**4-5**] on Bumex 1 mg po q day.
He was then seen in Dr.[**Name (NI) 22966**] Clinic again on [**4-11**] and Bumex was increased to 2 mg po bid and aldactone 12.5 mg q day was added.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2137**].
CABG in [**2135**] with a saphenous vein graft to the OM-1 and OM-2, and right coronary artery.
pressure at 31/14, wedge 12, ejection fraction of 30%, proximal right coronary artery 100%, OM-1 diffuse disease to right coronary artery, both saphenous vein graft occluded.
Anterolateral hypokinesis, apical akinesis, and no intervention was performed.
Status post TURP one month ago at [**Location (un) 620**] [**Last Name (un) 4068**].
ALLERGIES:  Iodine, he is pretreated for catheterization with Benadryl and Solu-Medrol.
He did have it years ago with his diverticulosis.
Calcium 8.2, magnesium 2.0, phosphorus 4.9, digoxin 0.6.
Cardiovascular system: A:  Systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation:  The patient was started on a nisseratide drip, continued on Bumex, his spironolactone was held secondary to low blood pressures and his beta blocker was held secondary to low blood pressures.
Patient's systolic blood pressure remained in the 80s and 90s, so he was started on a dopamine drip on the floor to 2.5, however, he still did not diurese, and so on [**2164-4-20**], he is admitted to the CCU for Swan placement, and Swan-guided therapy.
Swan was placed and revealed pulmonary capillary wedge pressure around 25, central venous pressure around 20, P.A.
Poor diuresis was felt secondary to poor renal perfusion from hypotension, so dopamine drip was increased from 2.5 to 7.5.
The patient diuresed well with 1500 cc net output over 24 hours.
The patient was called out to floor for continued diuresis on [**2164-4-21**].

Acute blood loss anemia:  Patient's hematocrit dropped significantly secondary to severe hematuria, and he required 4 units of packed red blood cells transfusion.
He was not started on ACE inhibitor secondary to renal failure.
Disposition:  The patient was seen by PT who felt that he needed rehabilitation after admission for deconditioning, and he was discharged to rehabilitation.
He was treated with Tylenol prn consistent with therapy.
