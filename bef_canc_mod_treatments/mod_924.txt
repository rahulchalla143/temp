Discharged from rehab and home (wheelchair bound) with recent clinic followup [**9-26**] noting baseline health.
His wife attributed his somnolence to recently starting Ambion and Valium 3 days prior to admission in addition to his home narcotic regimen of oxycontin and dilaudid.
Given his somnolence, EMS was called and administereed narcan in the field without improvement so he was admitted to Study hospital on [**9-30**] for acute respiratory failure.
He was bolused more NS (unclear how much) and remained hypotensive so was started on norepinephrine 2mcg/min and given stress dose hydrocortisone.
He was given an additional dose of narcan given continued somnolence and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] at the family's request given that all of his care has been here.
In the ED, initial VS were T 98.6 HR 128 BP 89/69 RR 17 99% on BIPAP and initial ABG was 7.27/61/83.
He has an indwelling foley catheter that was changed this past Thursday.
He had received emperic vancomycin at the OSH and received a dose of Zosyn in the ED here.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were T: 99.5 HR: 115 BP 121/69 RR 20, O2 sat 93% 100% NRB and was receiving levo at 1mcg/min on arrival.

[**2148-10-6**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Widespread combined alveolar and interstitial opacities affecting the left lung to a greater degree than the right have progressed in the interval, particularly in the right lower lung where there is also an increasing pleural effusion with adjacent consolidation and/or atelectasis.
[**2148-10-5**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Status post removal of right subclavian vascular catheter.
Dual-channel right supraclavicular central venous set ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
Brief Hospital Course: 57-year-old man with AML s/p matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplant in [**2142**], complicated by GVHD on chronic prednisone with multiple admission for infections now presents with somnolence in the setting if increased sedative medication use, hypercarbic respiratory distress, cough and CXR with LLL consolidation found to have segmental PE.
# Goals of care: After frequent discussions with family and physicians involved in the pt's case and gradual reduction in number of interventions performed, it was decided to transition to comfort measures only on [**10-12**].
The below medical treaments, lab draws, and imaging procedures were held.
The pt was kept in IV morphine, tylenol, and ativan to keep comfortable.
# PE: Patient with tachycardia, hypoxemia, hypotensive on admission and history of PE not anticoaguated, with IVC [**Date Range 7448**] in place.
Non contrast head CT was without hemorrhage, so started on heparin drip with intention to bridge to lovenox.
Per discussion with inpatient heme attending and outpatient hematologist, it was decided that the pt's risk of hemorrhage was greater than his risk of clot given the negative LENIs and clean IVC [**Last Name (LF) 7448**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] heparin gtt was held.
He was continued on prophylactic heparin subc.
# Pneumonia: Productive cough followed by somnolence in the setting of starting Ambien and Valium in addition to his home oxycontin.
Due to worsening CXR, vanco was changed to linezolid (day 1: [**10-6**]) per ID recs.
Also question of possible pulmonary congestion, so pt was started on IV lasix.
He was started on ambisome and given a dose of tobramycin.
The tobramycin was thereafter uptitrated with little effect.
Antibiotics were continued despite little improvement.
He was continued on micafungin (day 1 = [**10-3**]) and will need two week course following clearance of fungus.
Pt was started on ambisone for presumed fungal pneumonia.
ENT was consulted for possible involvement of nasal sinuses, who recommended nasal irrigation as tolerated given sedation.
# Hypotension: He was hypotensive to 60s-70s at OSH and required pressor support prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Possible sepsis as patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia and leukocytosis with possible sources of infection including pulmonary given LLL opacity on CXR and productive cough.
Urine source also possible given dirty urinalysis in the setting of indwelling catheter.
He was started emperically on vancomycin and meropenem (day 1 = [**9-30**]) for pneumonia to complete an 8 day total course (through [**10-7**]).
His urine, blood, and sputum cultures all returned positive for budding yeast (ID is [**Female First Name (un) **] (TORULOPSIS) GLABRATA), so he was initially started on IV fluconazole and was later transitioned to micafungin (day 1 = [**10-3**]).
Ambisome was started and uptitrated as above.
Likely multifactorial with hypercarbia from hypoventilation in the context of new sedating medications (ambien and valium, in addition to home narcotics), untreated OSA with likely CO2 retention at baseline, pneumonia, underlying GVHD of lung and PE.
His pneumonia and PE were treated as per above.
His dyspnea was treated with either non-rebreather, venti mask, or bipap as tolerated in order to achieve sat > 90%.
Ambien and valium were held.
After a goals of care discussion was held with pt, family, and specialists, it was decided to make the pt comfortable and give ativant and morphine despite hypercarbia.
Likely multifactorial with PE, pain, hypovolemia, and withdrawal from opioids all contributing.
He was given several doses of narcan at OSH and his home narcotics were initially held in the setting of hypotension.
Morphine drip was started to relieve any pain without any improvement in tachycardia.
Creatinine improved back to baseline with treatment of septic shock.
Continue with vancomycin and meropenem as per above.
# AML s/p MUD SCT in [**2142**]: Daily CBCs were checked and there was no evidence of reoccurance.
He was continued on bactrim, acyclovir, and azithromycin.
He was continued on prednisone 10 mg PO daily, and ppx with with acyclovir, bactrim, and azithromycin.
He was also placed on a sliding scale.
# Hypertension: metoprolol was held given hypotension  # Clot history: Prior PEs for which he was previously anticoagulated.
Anticoagulation was discontinued in the setting of back surgery and an IVC [**Year (4 digits) 7448**] was placed.
Now with segmental PE treated with heparin as per above.
