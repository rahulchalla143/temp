PSH: Tonsillectomy at age 14 and a cholecystectomy at age 25, rotator cuff surgery at 64 and knee surgery at age 55. .
[**6-/2108**]:  Underwent bilateral mastectomy for what appeared to be multifocal disease in both breasts and had negative sentinel lymph node biopsy.
B/l chest tube sites with clean dressings.
A singel chest tube is presenting in right lung base.
Bilateral left greater than right ground-glass opacity with septal thickening is most likely pulmonary edema, though in this patient on chemotherapy accompanying atypical infection would be difficult to exclude.
She had persistent hypoxia and a trapped right lung, for which further intervention could not be undertaken.
During this hospitalization, she made a transition to defer further aggressive treatment or diagnostics and was transitioned to comfort measures.
She was initially admitted to the ICU, however after her decision to focus on comfort was transferred to the floor on a morphine drip.
She does have notable h/o recurrent bilateral malignant pleural effusions with bilateral pleurx catheters - s/p right sided Pleurx on [**2112-4-11**] and left sided PleurX on [**2112-4-20**].
The improved fluid drainage after the loculations were broken up, however the right lung remained trapped and did not reexpand after fluid removal.
She was also found to have a PNA (had new GGO's on CT chest), and was treated with vanc, cefepime and azithro which was subsequently changes to levofloxacin.
She was placed on a morphine gtt on [**2112-7-3**].
