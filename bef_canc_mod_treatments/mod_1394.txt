He was recently discharged from the hospital after a long course of treatment for Klebsiella bacteremia from hepatic abscesses and obstructive cholangitis and issues with enteral feedings.
He was to continue his antibiotics for 2 more weeks after drain removal.
He says that he still has poor PO appetite, but is tolerating tube feeds at 90cc/hr overnight.
PSHx: s/p gastric resection [**2134**] for PUD s/p revision with Roux-en-Y and partial gastrectomy in [**2143**] s/p whipple [**2173-1-20**] s/p .
Drainage of intra-abdominal abscess through reopening of recent laparotomy; Repair of pancreaticojejunostomy through a bridge stent technique; Mass closure of the abdominal wall [**1-29**] for pancreatic and biliary fistula, and intra-abdominal abscess s/p Tracheostomy [**3-1**] s/p GJ-tube placed on [**2173-8-27**].
s/p PICC line placed on [**2173-8-30**].
s/p Hepatic drains placed on [**2173-9-2**] -- removed [**2173-10-8**] s/p Right-sided thoracentesis on [**2173-9-8**].
s/p J-tube placement via EC fistula [**2173-9-12**] and [**9-13**]  Social History: He used to work as property manager but is now retired.
EC fistula/J-T complex covered with ostomy appliance with bilious drainage.
Imaging: [**2173-10-15**] CT ABD/PELVIS W/CONTRAST: Interval decrease in size of multiple gas containing hepatic fluid collections.
A percutaneous feeding tube is present terminating in the expected location of the jejunum.
[**2173-10-17**] CXR: Interval placement of right subclavian catheter terminating in the lower SVC with no evidence of pneumothorax.
FINDINGS: Again noted are multiple peripherally enhancing hepatic fluid collections containing foci of gas consistent with abscesses.
For example, the collection within segment VII posteriorly measures 2.9 x 3.3 cm in its entirety, with the central fluid component measuring 1.7 x 1.1 cm.
The central fluid component on prior CT measured 1.6 x 1.5 cm.
The collection within segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] measures 2.7 x 1.9 cm in its entirety, with the anterior central fluid component measuring 0.9 x 0.9 cm.
There are two foci of enhancement within the right lateral abdominal wall in the site of prior drainage catheter tracts.
A percutaneous jejunostomy tube is identified.
Multiple hepatic abscesses, not significantly changed in size given differences in technique.
There is enhancement within the right lateral abdominal wall in the region of prior drainage catheters, without focal fluid collection.
[**Name (NI) **] was continued on a regular diet with supplements, cycled tubefeeds via the J-Tube, which enters the duodenum via a EC fistual, on home medications and oral antibiotics, the latter consisting of Ciprofloxacin, Clindamycin, and Linezolid.
These antibiotics were prescribed during his last admission for abdominal abscesses, which grew out Pseudomonas, MRSA and beta Strep.
Nutrition, Ostomy Nurse, Physical Therapy, and Occupational Therapy were consulted early during this admission.
On HD#2, the patient received an additional unit of PRBCs responding with a HGB of 10.4 and HCT of 31.4.
He was given supplemental hydration with Lactated Ringer's via the J-Tube.
Tolerated tubefeeds at goal, but only fair intake of his diet.
A foley catheter and A-line were placed.
The EKG was unremarkable, and the CXR showed moderate (R) pleural effusion increased, rightward mediastinal shift with opacification in (R) lower lobe most likely representing atelectasis.
He was given a 1L LR bolus with good response.
He was started on IV Flagyl for possible colitis.
A CVL was placed, and IV Cefepime was added for temperature spikes to cover Pseudomonas.
On [**2173-10-22**], the patient underwent MRCP, which revealed multiple hepatic abscesses, but not significantly changed in size given differences in technique, and no new fluid collections.
Infectious Disease continued to follow along, updating antibiotic recommendations.
The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay.
After his foley was discontinued, he voided without problem with an adequate urine output.
He tolerated cycled tubefeeds via the J-Tube and a regular diet.
He was also started on Viokase and Imodium PRN for loose stools with improvement.
He was tolerating cycled tubefeeds via the J-Tube, placed through the EC fistula.
The ostomy appliance as ordered remained intact.
