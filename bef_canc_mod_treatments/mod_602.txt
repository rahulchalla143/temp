[**2146-1-10**] Colonoscopy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 74 year old female with extensive PMH including colonic neoplasm resection in [**2136**], who presented to the [**Hospital **] hospital on [**2145-12-28**] with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and distention for 3 days.
The surgeon at [**Hospital **] hospital felt that she needed resection of the narrowed decending colon segment.
She is now directly transferred to us for further managment.
The presumptive diagnosis at the NEB was diverticulitis / constipation, patient was on sips of water, IVF with foley in place.
She was on a bowel regiment and had only 4 BMs yesterday.
At NEB she was treated with zosyn from [**12-28**] until [**12-30**], when she was switched to ertapenem.

[**2146-1-10**] Colonoscopy Multiple shallow ulcers in sigmoid colon (17-25 cm) c/w ischemia [**2146-1-5**] KUB massively dilated bowel, cecum less than 10cm in diameter.
Intubation (per patient request) for the colonoscopy.
Colonoscopy was limited due to the poor prep, but they were able to get beyond a long narrowed segment (almost 10cm in length in decending colon.
Due to co-morbidities, patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate and we sought alternatives to a major operative procedure for this long stricture of uncertain etiology and possible mass vs impacted stool just proximal.
She was started on a heparin drip.
An attempt to insert a cecostomy tube via interventional radiology was not successful as the bowel had suprisingly significantly decompressed after the colonoscopy.
We elected to wait on any further intervention and eventually the patient's obstructive symptoms subsided, and she began to pass stools with decrease in abdominal distention.
Rectal tube inserted.
Underwent colonoscopy under general anesthesia on [**2146-1-10**] which revealed Multiple shallow ulcers in sigmoid colon (17-25 cm) consistent with ischemia.
Started on more aggressive bowel regimen to prevent constipation-colace and Miralax.
Continued with Heparin drip.
Coumadin dosed daily, INR's checked daily.
Started on Lovenox with planned bridge to Coumadin once INR therapeutic ([**1-19**]).
Patient will continue Lovenox bridge at home.
She has experience with self-injections in past.
Coumadin management will be continued per Dr.[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who was contact[**Name (NI) **] by phone by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] prior to the patients discharge to co-ordinate her post-hospital management.
