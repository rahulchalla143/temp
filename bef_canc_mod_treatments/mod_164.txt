DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post coronary artery bypass graft times five vessels; status post coronary syndrome with previous coronary artery disease history.
PROCEDURES:  Coronary artery bypass graft times five vessels; mitral valve replacement; coronary artery catheterization.
The patient's symptoms resolved in seconds with one sublingual Nitroglycerin; however, the day before admission he had to take two sublingual Nitroglycerin to relieve his symptoms.
Within a few days he saw his primary care physician who recommended he be admitted for coronary catheterization.
The past medical history also includes diabetes mellitus occasionally with low fingersticks, hypertension, amoebic dysentery five years ago, and anemia.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Glucotrol 10 mg p.o.
q.d., Atenolol 25 mg p.o.
q.d., and Diltiazem 60 mg p.o.
q. day with or without Amlodipine 10 mg p.o.
Hemoglobin A1C was 6.3.
AST was 80, iron 30, B12 275, folate 9.3, ferritin 58, LDL 48, HDL 14.
On hospital day #4, the patient was taken to the Operating Room under the care of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 13624**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10102**] where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times five vessels with LIMA to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the RPDA, saphenous vein graft to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft to a ramus of the posterior descending artery.
He also had a mitral valve replacement with a 31 mm mechanical valve.
He also underwent endarterectomy of the right posterior descending artery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit while being AV paced on Levophed, Milrinone, and Propofol.
As he was stable, he was seen by physical therapy who recommended mostly patient education and ambulation.
The patient was transferred to the floor and on postoperative day #2, he was found to have continuous large chest tube output which had been only gradually improving since the time of surgery.
This did not completely resolve his physical findings therefore the patient was transfused with a unit of packed red blood cells and given Lasix to help prevent fluid overload.
The mediastinal tubes were removed at that point and the patient was treated with long-acting pain medications as well as short-acting pain medications for breakthrough pain.
The patient recovered from the junctional rhythm when his blood pressure recovered and diuresis was commenced the following day.
The patient tolerated this well and on postoperative day #4 after the chest tubes had been discontinued and the patient was feeling as though there was better control of the pain, he was still requiring a fair amount of oxygen, approximating an O2 saturation of 100% on 65 liters of oxygen per nasal cannula.
Diuresis was continued and the patient was still having a difficult time cooperating in physical therapy.
The patient was therefore placed on Levofloxacin on postoperative day #6 in the event that these bullae/blisters could become superinfected and in this diabetic patient complicate his saphenectomy.
They felt this was an asymptomatic run of a nonsustained supraventricular tachycardia and that the patient would be safe to go home with prescriptions for Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
q.d., and Lisinopril 5 mg p.o.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o.

x7 days, K-Dur 20 mEq p.o.
x7 days, Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o.
3-4 hours p.r.n., Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Glucotrol 10 mg p.o.
q.d., Lisinopril 5 mg p.o.

The patient is to follow up with the nurses on Fahr Six for a wound check in approximately one week.
