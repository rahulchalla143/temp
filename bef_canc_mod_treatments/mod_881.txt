Joint aspiration Bronch   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 65 yo woman with h/o DM2, ESRD, AFib on coumadin, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis s/p liver and kidney transplant in [**2153**], on cellcept/prograf, and prednisone taper (for gout flare), who presents with a four-day history of fever (tmax 101 at home), headache, neck pain, and confusion.
She was given Ceftriaxone 1g and Vancomycin (at 3:25pm), and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
She was unable to have a LP because her INR was 2.7, and there was concern that her picture was more consistent with an epidural abscess.
Neurosurgery was then C/S, who recommended CT spine with contrast, as a MRI cannot be performed because of her pacemaker.
She was given another 1 g of CTX, Ampicillin, Acyclovir, and Decadron 10 mg in the ED.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

Empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated which included vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin and acyclovir along with a 4 day course of dexamethasone to be completed which completed on [**3-8**].
Antibiotics were discontinued per ID recommendations.
Improved to 1.3 with intravenous fluids.
Clinical exam and urine lytes showed a pre-renal picture and the patient's lasix was temporarily held and she was given IV fluids.
Creatinine 1.1 and she was restarted on her home dose lasix.
INR was elevated as she had been on coumadin for atrial fibrillation and splenic vein thrombosis.
INR dropped below 2 and a heparin drip was started pending decision for any invasive procedures.
Once this was determined her coumadin was restarted and she was being bridged with Lovenox.
Gout - continue allopurinol 200mg daily; When dexamethasone was disconitnued, pt gout flared up again.
She was started on a prednisone taper and then the renal attending decided that given she has been on multiple pred tapers in the past, she may benefit from colchicine therapy while her allopurinol is being titrated up.
She was started on colchicine and rheumatology was consulted.
Transplant surgery was consulted on [**3-11**] for severe abd pain and hypotension.
She was taken to the OR on [**3-11**] for exploratory laparotomy, evacuation of intra-abdominal blood, exploration of retroperitoneal hematoma,and left salpingo-oophorectomy for retroperitoneal bleed.
SICU course was notable for volume overload requiring diuresis and CVVHD for ultrafiltration.
No further intervention was done.
ATN gradually resolved and CVVHD was stopped.
She required bronchoscopy with BAL which was negative.
Once volume status improved she was weaned and extubated.
CTA was done noting concerns for hepatic artery stenosis.
She exerienced a right groin hematoma at the groin site, but right leg CSM was intact.
Once HCTs were stable, Aspirin and plavix were started.
No coumadin was indicated.
Steroid taper was started on [**4-2**] consisting of 30mg x3 days then 20mg x3 days then 10mg x 3 days then resumption of home dose of prednisone 2.5mg qd for transplant immunosuppession along with cellcept and prograf.
Rheumatology recommended holding off on previous allopurinol for several weeks to prevent flare up of gout.
She will require a rheumatology f/u as an outpatient in a couple of weeks.
Ariprazole 5mg daily was increased to [**Hospital1 **] on [**4-4**].
She required rare doses of intermittent ativan 0.5mg for anxiety.
Given h/o diastolic heart failure previous home dose of lasix 120 mg po qam was initiated on [**4-7**].
Carvedilol and valsartan were continued.
Atrial fibrillation: Coumadin was discontinued and the plan was to not resume this.
Seizure disorder - cont  She continued on keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **].
Depression - continue home aripiprazole, desvenlafaxine, trazodone.
Primary biliary cirrhosis - continue ursodiol 300mg [**Hospital1 **].
Given prolonged hospital course and poor appetite and intake, post pyloric tube feeds were started in the SICU and continued during the hospital stay.
She tolerated Novasource renal with beneprotein, 21 gm/day at 40ml/hour continuous.
