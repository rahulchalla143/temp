The patient's antibiotics of Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone were continued for broad spectrum coverage.
The patient remained afebrile with a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray.
Therefore Vancomycin was continued for gram positive coverage, Flagyl was continue for anaerobic coverage, and Ceftriaxone was changed to Levofloxacin for further gram negative and atypical coverage.
The patient's vent settings were weaned slowly and eventually the patient tolerated pressure support of 5 with a PEEP of 5 on FIO2 of .4.
The patient was optimize with suctioning of secretions prior to extubation and was successfully extubated on [**2144-8-25**].
The patient was diuresed aggressively with Lasix and oxygenation improved as well as resolution of his congestive heart failure.
