Furthermore, in       infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may vary.
In a patient at low risk for intrathoracic malignancy, a dedicated followup CT should be obtained in one year; if high risk, a dedicated followup can be obtained in 6 to 12 months.
# Pneumonia - In the ED the patient was ruled out for a PE with a CTA given her Aa gradient.
The patient was initially admitted to the MICU as she was on a non-rebreather, but was weaned down to 3L NC overnight.
She was continued on levofloxacin 750 mg for community acquired pneumonia and continued to improve clinically.
She was given nebulized albuterol and an ipratropium MDI for wheezing.
She was given morphine IV, tylenol, and ibuprofen with resolution of her chest pain and no further episodes.
# Anemia - On arrival to the MICU, the patient received 2 additional units of blood and her hematocrit increased appropriately to 20 and she remained hemodynamically stable.
The anemia was also evaluated with haptoglobin (nl), nl folate, nl B12 and reticulocyte count which was appropriately elevated.
It should be noted, however, that these studies were performed after the patient had already received some blood and therefore, may not be entirely accurate.
The patient was transfused an additional 2 units of PRBCs on the medicine floor with an appropriate hematocrit increase to 26 that remained stable.
The patient has never had a colonoscopy previously and they recommended a colonoscopy as an outpatient given trace guaiac positive stools in the ED and the uncertainty around the acuity of the patient's anemia, though she denied melena or BRBPR.
