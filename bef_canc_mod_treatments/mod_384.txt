She was given Anzemet, hydralazine, narcan 0.2 mg IV, morphine 2mg IV, and 1gm Vancomycin.
Given concern for meningitis or meningoencephalitis, pt was initially admitted to the floor by NF overnight with empiric treatment with Ceftriaxone (only 1 gm by POE) and Vancomycin.
Ceftriaxone was changed to meningitis dose 2 gm q12, and acyclovir to cover HSV encephalitis, and neuro consulted for LP.
Through the course of the day, the patient spiked a temp to 104, HR 130s and SBP was persistently elevated above 200s not responding to IV hydralazine and lopressor.
Required IV to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (no west MICU beds) for Bblocker drip for HTN and for further w/u & monitoring.
Neuro suggested that [**Hospital Unit Name 23792**] was a recently added medication and could possibly be the source of mental status changes.
The most likely diagnosis was thought to be serotonin syndrome given her high dose Celexa & trazadone as an outpatient and the recent addition of [**Hospital Unit Name 23792**] (non-specific serotonin inhibitor) combined with her sx of fever, rigidity and hypertension.
All anti-depressant medications and sedatives were stopped.
Cyproheptadine was started initally for serotonin sundrome but dc'd per neuro recs.
The patient was still continued on her regimen for infectious meningitis since an LP had not been obtained yet.
Acyclovir and ceftriaxone were dc'd b/c suspicion of meningitis was low.
SVT did not resolve with adenosine, but she went into rapid AFib which resolved with IV lopressor.
She was continued on coumadin and was switched from heparin to lovenox so she could go home, with plan to d/c lovenox once INR >2.
She initally required IV labetolol to bring her pressures down, but thus was dc'd and she was continued on low dose BB, hydralazine and clonidine patch.
HCTZ was eventually added back into her regimen and she was discharged on these medications.
Her trazodone was dc'd d/t her possible serotonin syndrome, and she has hallucinations when she takes Ambien.
She was continued on gentle IV hydration and meds were dosed by Cr clearance.
* Spinal Stenosis: Patient had pain secondary to this and was on IV Morphine at home.
Switched to a morphine PCA for home use.
* DM2: Was on metformin as an outpt.
Continued pt on RISS and qid fingersticks.
*Elevated INR: Was 3.1 at admission and likely secondary to coumadin use.
Fibrinogen was not low so this was likley not secondary to DIC.
Her INR was reversed with Vit K and FFP prior to LP.
She was discharged on coumadin and lovenox.
*Prophylaxis: lovenox and coumadin, PPI, bowel regimen .
