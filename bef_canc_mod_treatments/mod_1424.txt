In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 67736**] has a history of a recurrent hemangiopericytoma s/p resection that was complicated by a bone flap infection and tumor recurrence.
The tumor recurrence was successfully treated with Cyberknife radiosurgery [**2197-6-19**].
He underwent placement of scalp expanders by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.
in preparation for placement of the cranioplasty.
Past Medical History: (1) a left hemicraniectomy on [**2196-6-24**] to [**2196-6-25**] for removal of a hemangiopericytoma at [**Hospital6 1129**], (2) a craniplasty with placement of a synthetic bone graft on [**2196-9-27**], (3) a wound revision on [**2196-12-10**] to remove MRSA-infected cranioplasty, (4) s/p Cyberknife radiosurgery radiosurgery to the tumor from [**2197-6-19**] to [**2197-6-23**] to 3000 cGy (600 cGy x 5 fractions) at 83% isodose line.
(5) placement of scalp expander  Social History: He previously was a driver for UPS.
Little overall change in multiple foci of intracranial hemorrhage including extensive parenchymal, intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage, and posterior fossa edema.
Interval evolution and redistribution of blood products.
There is stable appearance to the 7 mm of midline shift towards the left.
Further evolution of the extra-axial collections and right basal ganglia and left temporo-parietal hemorrhage.
He was placed on vancomycin upon admission for surgical prophylaxis, and an ID consult was obtained for specific guidelines for post operative antimicrobial management.
He was taken to the operating room on [**9-21**] for cranioplasty and repair of cranial defect.
[**9-21**]- Pt taken to OR for cranioplasty and repair of cranial defect.
Pt remain intubated and sedated post operatively.
He was continued on vancomycin and ceftriaxone was added for drain prophylaxis.
On post op exam he was not following commands but localizing his LUE and withdrawing both lower extremities.
He did have a subgaleal JP drain placed by plastic surgery at the time of his procedure and this draining 300cc of serosanguineous fluid.
His JP drain was taken off suction and his EVD output did increase.
Head CT showed good placement of EVD catheter and a subgaleal fluid collection.
[**9-25**]- CT head showed slight interval decrease in subgaleal fluid collection and his JP drain was removed by the plastic surgery team without difficulty.
Speech and swallow evaluated pt on this day and he was not safe for PO diet.
In the evening he had decreased O2 sats and suction at bedside showed he was aspirating his tube feeds and they were held.
His ceftriaxone was changed to cefepime and Flagyl was added.
On [**9-29**] the tube feeds were continued and the patient seemed to be tolerating them.
General surgery was consulted for PEG placement and the plan was made for [**9-30**].
It was discussed with the surgical and ICU teams and was decided to not place the peg at this time due to risk of failure of extubation post op.
CSF was sent due to the fever for culture, glucose,protein and cell counts.
Tube feeds were held and oxygen was being weaned.
Subcuatneous heparin was held in anticipation for PEG placement.
Head CT showed no change in ventricle size after removal of EVD and he was transferred to the step down unit in stable condition.
Antibiotics were continued upon transfer with plan to undergo full 2 week course for aspiration pneumonia.
Scopolamine patch was added to help with secretions.
His antibiotics will continue until [**10-12**] at which time they can be stopped.
