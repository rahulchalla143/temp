HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 29-year-old female with multiple medical problems including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, anorexia, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and multiple line infections, who was in [**Hospital **] Clinic today for parenteral iron treatment and became hypotensive.
She was premedicated with Benadryl, Tylenol, and Pepcid with a subsequent test dose over 15 minutes of IV iron.
One hour later, an infusion of 100 mg of Ferrlecit was infused and five minutes after the infusion started, the patient complained of back pain radiating to her shoulder blades bilaterally and she received 10 mg of Decadron for concern of allergic reaction.
She was given IV fluids, 20 mg of Decadron, 50 mg of Benadryl.
She was given vancomycin and Levaquin for presumed line sepsis, and her blood pressure and heart rate stabilized.
This was removed in [**2157-2-6**],  and a PICC line was placed, which was later discontinued due to concern for upper extremity DVT despite negative ultrasound.
A left subclavian Hickman line was placed in [**2156-3-6**].
Status post laminectomy times three.
Penicillin leads to hives.
Erythromycin leads to hives.
Sulfa drugs lead to hives.
Fentanyl causes seizures.
Clindamycin causes nausea and vomiting.
Dilantin 100 mg q.d.
Neurontin 300 mg t.i.d.
Vitamin B6 50 q.d.
Florinef 0.3 mg b.i.d.
Adderall 3 mg b.i.d., 10 mg q.p.m.
Left subclavian line site clean, dry, and intact, no erythema.
It    was felt that this was most likely a parasympathetic surge    given her bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia,    anhidrosis.
All culture data    were negative for signs of infection including urine and    blood.
She was continued on levofloxacin and vancomycin    for presumed line sepsis, and was discharged on    levofloxacin monotherapy empirically treating an unknown    source.
It    was strongly encouraged that she reconsider the use of IV    iron given the symptoms that she seem to develop    concurrent with IV iron administration.
Tylenol was    effective at controlling the patient's pain.
Please be sure to eat frequent small meals throughout the day given your propensity for hyperinsulin secretion, ensure adequate fluid intake, and although most patient's with heart failure (low ejection fraction) require low salt and low fluid diet given your postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, you require a high salt, high fluid diet.
