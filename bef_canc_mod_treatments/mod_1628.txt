Generalized  superimposed beta activity was seen, likely due to a medication effect, most commonly from benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
Additional bursts of beta activity were seen in the cardiac monitor which, at times, correlated with left frontotemporal beta activity likely due to artifact.
EEG [**2118-7-6**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to generalized slowing, with continuous theta and delta slowing, which are much more prominent than the previous day's recording, with occasional brief periods of generalized suppression.
These findings are indicative of a severe encephalopathy which could be due to ischemia, infection, or toxic/ metabolic disturbances and medication effects, among other etiologies.
Generalized superimposed beta activity was seen, likely due to a  medication effect, most commonly from benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
