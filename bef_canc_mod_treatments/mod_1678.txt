A Foley terminates in the collapsed bladder.
Moderate amount of pneumoperitoneum in the upper abdomen may relate to recent procedure.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 86 year old male with CAD, AS, DM2, HTN, HLD, and recent J tube placement and balloon valvuloplasty who presented with dyspnea and chest discomfort, and was found to have worse anemia due to an intraperitoneal hematoma at his J tube site.
He was initially admitted to the ACS service for evaluation and treatment of low Hct and an anterior intraperitoneal hematoma.
CT abdomen showed a 7.8 x 3.6 x 7.1 cm hematoma in the anterior abdomen intraperitoneally near the site of his recent J-tube placement and lysis of adhesions.
J tube was initially put to gravity and then connected to tube feeds on HD1.
He had a J-tube placed for tube feeds and meds at that time.
His J tube became obstructed in the ICU and again on [**2201-1-27**], and he was unable to take his morning meds until it was cleared later in the morning.
# Urinary Retention / BPH: He had urinary retention during his last admission with plan to keep Foley in place for 2 weeks and treat with Finasteride and Tamsulosin.
He denied any urinary complaints with the Foley in place.

# Dyslipidemia: He was discharged on Atorvastatin 40 mg PO daily after his last admission.
He was given IV fluids and remained normotensive for the remainder of his stay.
# CAD: He usually takes Aspirin 325 mg daily.
Given his stable Hct and lack of further bleeding, he was restarted on a lower dose of Aspirin 81 mg PO daily on discharge.
He was continued on his Metoprolol with conservative holding parameters.
