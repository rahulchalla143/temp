He became hypotensive after two sublingual nitroglycerin, and transiently bradycardic.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, noninsulin dependent diabetes, hypothyroidism, hiatal hernia, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2192**] with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his right coronary artery, history of guaiac positive stools after receiving aspirin, depression, anxiety.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lopressor 50 mg twice a day, Lipitor 20 mg once daily, Vasotec 10 mg twice a day, Norvasc 5 mg once daily, Levoxyl 75 mg once daily, Prilosec, Avandia, Glucotrol, Prozac 20 mg once daily, Xanax .5 mg four times a day as needed.
Catheterization results revealed three vessel coronary disease, elevated left-sided filling pressures, lateral wall acute ST elevation myocardial infarction with revascularization of the diagonal branch with good results.
The patient started on Integrilin for 18 hours, started on Plavix 75 mg for a 30 day course.
He was given aspirin 325 mg once daily.
The patient was started on aspirin despite his past history of bleeding and would be monitored carefully with guaiac testing of all stools.
The patient was continued on Lipitor and also restarted on his ACE inhibitor on hospital day two.
Echocardiogram on [**2198-8-23**], showed a mildly dilated left atrium with a left ventricular cavity that was mildly dilated, showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, resting regional wall motion abnormalities including inferolateral akinesis/severe hypokinesis.
Anticoagulation was not pursued for left ventricular thrombus prevention in light of the patient's relatively productive ejection fraction.
Pulmonary:  The patient was hypoxic on admission and required oxygen both before and after this catheterization.
The patient was weaned down from 7 liters of oxygen to 4 liters of oxygen by [**2198-8-24**].
For this reason, the patient was given two doses of Mucomyst after his intervention.
The patient's creatinine initially decreased with large diuresis on hospital day one.
The urine was sent for analysis and was found to be positive for a urinary tract infection with positive nitrites, positive leukocyte esterase, and positive finding of white blood cells in the urine, along with large amount of red blood cells.
The patient was started on levofloxacin for a presumed urinary tract infection.
Urology was consulted on the [**8-24**], and their input included continuing the bladder irrigation until bleeding was stopped, consider Foley catheterization after the cessation of bleeding, and follow up CT of the pelvis along with cystoscopy in outpatient fashion.
The patient did not require transfusion as of [**2198-8-25**].
The patient was continued on his presumed outpatient Xanax regimen, as well as his antidepressant regimen.
The patient complained of sleeplessness on the day of the 26th, and was given a 2 mg Haldol dose.
Prophylaxis:  The patient was given Protonix for peptic ulcer disease prevention, docusate for constipation.
He was given subcutaneous heparin initially for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
Discharge condition, discharge disposition, and discharge medications will be included in the addendum which will be dictated when the patient is actually discharged.
