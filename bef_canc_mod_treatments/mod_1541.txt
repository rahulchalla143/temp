She received ativan 2mg IV x 2 by EMS for recurrence of seizure activity, which then broke, and upon arrival to ED she was no longer seizing.
She was found to be stuperous and intubated for airway protection (etomidate, succs, dexamethasone 10mg ivx1).
BP dropped to 92/50 after intubation for which she received 4L IVF.
She received CTX 2g, acyclovir, dilaintin 1g x1 @ 2250. .
Upon arrival to the MICU, pt is intubated and sedated, minimally responsive to noxious stimuli (responds minimally to sternal rub, withdraws to pain), with RR 20s (overbreathing [**Name2 (NI) **]).
Past Medical History: - SLE c/b lupus nephritis - Rheumatic heart disease, s/p bioprosthetic AVR [**9-9**], s/p mechanical MVR with tricuspid valve annuloplasty [**10-13**].
?s syndrome - s/p cholecystectomy - chronic anemia [**2-7**] recurrent GI bleeds, source unclear (extensive GI workup including capsule endoscopy on [**11-26**] showed no significant source for bleeding), on procrit [**2-7**] CRI, PPI for GIB prophylaxis.
Inferior/lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia/myocardial infarction Since previous tracing of [**2202-12-27**], rhythm new, axis more right inferiorly, shorter Q-T interval and peaked T waves - consider hyperkalemia - clinical correlation is suggested .
Satisfactory positioning of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present.
A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is present.
No vegetations identified but a TEE is required to assess prosthetic valves for endocarditis.
Bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis with 2-cm long adjacent vegetation.
Well-seated, normally functioning bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement.
Brief Hospital Course: # Endocarditis: Patient had staph aureus in [**4-9**] BCx bottles from admission and a history of mechanical valve as well as bio-prostetic valve.
Id was consulted and recommended she start on vanc and gentamicin while awaiting sensitivities.
She was also started on rifampin for better penetration into the prosthesis.
On further discussion, given that she was failing medical therapy and was not a surgical candidate focus was shifted towards comfort.
She was continued on dilantin, dosed by level, and antibiotics as above for endocarditis with presumed seeding of the CSF.
She was maintained on dilatin while she was comfort measures.
# hypotension - Patient had septic shock on presentation and required levophed to maintain pressures after receiving 9L IVF.
After treatment with antibiotics for several days she was weaned off levophed and maintained better BPs.
# metabolic acidosis - likely [**2-7**] lactate and infectious etiology, lactate trended down with IVF and antibiotic treatment.
# Rheumatic heart disease, s/p AVR, MVR: She was started on a heparin gtt and coumadin was held given likelihood of procedures during her hospitalization.
# HTN - Her home medications of coreg, valsartan and lisinopril were held during this hospitalization.
