Friability and ulceration at the base of the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear in the cardia compatible with the source of bleed.
Both an endoclip was placed and 1.1mg of epinephrine was injected around this area and the GE junction and Bipap cautery was also applied with successful hemostasis.
HCT remained stable at 24-25 post procedure after transfusion of total of 4units pRBC.
Patient was discharged with plan per GI for PPI [**Hospital1 **] indefinitely and repeat EGD in [**2-27**] wks to reevaluate area and perform APC of erythematous mucosa.
Decision made to transfer to the MICU with plan to start PPI infusion for better hemostasis, monitor serial HCTs, and transfuse for goal hct > 26, INR < 1.6 .
On arrival to the MICU, patient without complaint; at this time he is without complaints of abdominal pain, n/v, melena, hematchezia, hematemesis.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Past Medical History: 1) Stage IIB pancreatic adenocarcinoma (T3N1M0) 1.9 cm poorly differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma, involving [**2-3**] lymph nodes;  distal pancreatic margin was involved and there was disease in the SMV, now s/p Whipple w SMV reconstruction ([**4-/2155**]), C2 gemcitabine ([**6-/2155**]/[**2154**]), XRT+capecitabine ([**9-/2155**]) 2) XRT-induced strictures in the bile duct, s/p PTC requiring multiple balloon cholangioplasties 3) s/p ex-lap for SBO/LOA 4) HTN, not on anti-hypertensies 5) DM, on glipizide 6) Thyroid nodule - ?papillary thyroid ca - [**7-/2156**]   Social History: Works at Shaws as produce manager.
cachethic, jaundice  HEENT: Sclera icteric, MMM, oropharynx clear without exudates or lesions Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi, decreased bs at b/l bases CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Midline incision from previous ex-lap well healed, abdomen non-tender though distended with full flanks, tympanitic with bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly, dressing in place over right perc drain/tube without surrounding tenderness, erythema GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, 1+ bilateral edema  Pertinent Results: TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
CTA (prelim): - bilateral pleural effusions, large on the right, small on the left with adjacent compressive atelectasis - massive simple ascites, new compared to prior study - Focus of arterial hyperdensity noted in distal esophagus (4a:231, 4b:231, 600b:38) expanding on delayed phase imaging concerning for active extravasation in pt with prior [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear.
- pt is s/p WHipples with expected post-operative anatomy including absent GDA.
Other abdominal arterial vasucalture is patent and without evidence of dissection, or stenosis - the hepatic veins are patent though diminutive - portal veins and major tributaries are patent - redemosntration of single loop of non-dialted bowel with minimal bowel wall thickening- of unclear significance - may be related to third spacing - PTBD is stable in position - atrophic residual pancreas - stable splenomegaly - diverticulosis without colonic bowel wall thickenign to suggest diverticulitis - L sacral bone island.
However, when the patient is able, a dedicated hepatic MRI or multiphasic liver CT would be suggested for further characterization  .
1.1mg of epinephrine was injected to the area with hemostasis.
1.1 cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] hemostasis with success.

Patient presented for surveillance EGD during which scope withdrawal on retroflexion, demonstrated active bleeding and a large blood clot was seen at the site of his prior bleed at the GE junction.
1.1mg of epinephrine was injected to the area with hemostasis.
This episode mimicked that of last EGD on [**2156-8-16**] during which 1.1 cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] was injected, clip placed with successful hemostasis.
Patient initially placed on a PPI bolus + ggt and transitioned to [**Hospital1 **] IV therapy on HD2.
