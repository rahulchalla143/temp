CXR showed Rt-sided infiltrate so he was started on CTX and azithromycin to treat community-acquired pneumonia.
His hypoxia quickly worsened to requiring 100% NRB and was noted on CXR to possible pulmonary edema with BNP of 1259.
He was treated with lasix without good result.
He later went into rapid atrial fibrillation with heart rates in the 130's-140's and was subsequently placed on a diltialzem and heparin drip.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, joint pains, black stools or red stools.
At baseline he has no dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

He had presented to an OSH with URI-like symptoms one month ago and been treated for CAP with a course of Azithromycin.
The patient was transferred to MICU care given hemodynamics consistent with sepsis, and eventually initiated on HD for worsening volume status and renal function.
The patient was eventually successfully extubated although noted to develop hypoxia previously while awaiting HD over the weekend, and has now completed 14 day course of Vanc for MRSA PNA.
On [**2203-9-26**], while on medical floor, the patient developed hyperglycemia into the 600s, uncontrolled with NPH, and SOB for 2-3 hours, with oxygen sats dropping to 88% even on supplemental oxygen.
Due to this hypoxia and hyperglycemia he was transferred to the MICU for insulin gtt, HD, and closer monitoring.
Hypoxemia has responded to one session of HD [**9-28**] with 2kg of ultrafiltration.
He was taken off insulin gtt on [**2203-9-28**] and placed on Lantus 40 and RISS.
The Insulin was then sequentially lowered to 30, then 24, the following nights [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs.
Patient was initially admitted for atrial fibrillation with RVR to 140s, which required esmolol gtt and diltiazem gtt.
He has not reached target HR but well tolerates high HRs (90-110) and drops SBP when rate control is very aggressive.
Although he was initially anticoagulated with Heparin gtt this was discontinued for GI bleed on [**2203-9-6**].
- We held ASA for risk of bleed, and started ASA after his repeat EGD which showed normal gastric mucosa.
- Current rhythm afib on high-dose Metoprolol and verapamil, with SBP maintained in the 110s-130s and HR ranges from 80s-90s.
We changed his metoprol and verapamil to long-acting forumulations the morning of discharge.
He is currently Toprol XL 200 mg po and Verapamil long acting 120 mg po.
Metoprolol can be titrated up as he was previously on metoprolol 100 mg tid.
- HD on Mon/Wed/Fri schedule .
Required intubation during first CCU stay and was extubated, then reintubated during following MICU stay, stabalized, and sent to the floor, extubated.
- Continued HD on Mon/Wed/Fri schedule per above .
Labile and high blood sugars required insulin gtt and MICU transfer.
We stopped ASA initially but restarted after the repeat EGD.
Patient with chronic renal failure secondary to hypertensive and diabetic nephropathy as well as s/p nephrectomy for TCC.
