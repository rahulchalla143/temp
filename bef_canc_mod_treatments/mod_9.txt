Arterial line finally placed successfully.
Placed on BIPAP and reintubated.
Pt has been maintaining stable oxygenation and ventilation on pressure controlled ventilation with PS 3, PEEP 5, Fi02 0.5, PIP 22, TV 500-600, RR18.

Pt was also anticoagulated on a heparin drip and on [**11-24**] began coumadin loading.
