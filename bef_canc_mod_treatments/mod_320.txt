The patient was treated for a COPD exacerbation with IV solumedrol and azithromycin, BIBAP.
After being tachypnic on NRB and having a arterial blood gas which revealed hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and acidosis with mental status changes he was intubated.
10 minutes after intubation his BP's dropped to SBP-60-70's and it was noted his PEEP was gradually increasing, with low tidal volumes.
He was not auto PEEPing; exam was concerning for pneumothorax, so right and left chest tubes were placed, with initial poor return so they were repositioned.
Right chest tube then had air return.
He was empirically treated for sepsis with Cefazolin, Vancomycin, Azithromycin with Albuterol nebs.Sedated with Midaz and Fentanyl.On levophed with SBP-120-130's on transfer to the MICU.
Patient recieved a CT chest on transfer to MICU  In the ED, initial VS were:  100.6 108 170/68 32 87% 4L Nasal Cannula .
Past Medical History: # Severe Emphysema # Afib vs MFAT #[**2183-5-15**] R thorascopy, bleb resection, and pleurectomy/pleurodesis #R chest tube with talc pleurodesis on [**2184-8-25**] # [**2179**] left upper lobectomy  for ruptured emphysematous bleb # Prostate Cancer # Nephrolitiasis #[**4-/2194**]- tracheostomy, PEG after complicated MICU stay.
Bilateral chest tube in place bilaterally with air bubbles and some bloody output.

POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION (Final [**2195-2-5**]):       Test cancelled by laboratory.
Detection of viruses other than those listed above will only be       performed on specific request.
BLOOD CULTURE/URINE CULTURE AND STOOL FOR CDIFF AT MULTIPLE TIMES WERE NEGATIVE  =========== IMAGING: ===========  CXRAY ON [**2-4**]: Chest single frontal view.
Potential malposition of the newly placed right-sided chest tube in the lung parenchyma, potentially draining emphysematous lung instead of the pleural space.
Removal of the pre-existing right chest tube and of the pre-existing left chest tube.
Malpositioned right chest tube with the tip terminating within the lung parenchyma of the right upper lobe.
Right-sided chest tube is again visualized.
The tracheostomy tube is in standard location.
Right subclavian line tip is in the mid SVC.
=============== PROCEDURES: =============== BRONCH ON [**2-12**]: Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with percutaneous dilational tracheostomy and serial airway balloon occlusion.
Following creation of a 1 cm skin incision as the prior tracheostomy site, blunt dissection to the trachea was performed.
Wire introduction with serial dilation resulted in the straightforward placement of a #8 Portex Per-fit.
Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with successful percutaneous dilational tracheostomy, and serial airway balloon occlusion was performed with identification of an air leak from all three RUL segments.
BRONCH ON [**2-16**]: findings: Flexible bronchoscopy with intrabronchial valve placement.
The endobronchial sizing balloon was used to determine the diameter of the apical RUL segment while monitoring for decrease in chest tube leak.
A 7mm intrabronchial valve was placed without difficulty.
The anterior segment of the RUL was next sized, again documenting a decrease in the chest tube air leak.
A 6 mm valve was placed in this location without complication.
Flexible bronchoscopy with intrabronchial valve placement in the anterior and apical segments of the RUL was performed with decrease in the air leak.
He was then intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to a long hospitalization course which was complicated by having multiple chest tube placed and developing subcutaneous air leakage, requiring trach placement, pneumonia, sepsis, acute renal failure and choledolytiasis.
#Hypoxemic Resp Failure- The patient had a pmh significant for very severe COPD on home O2 and he was admitted for respiratory distress leading to hypercarbichypoxemic respiratory failure thought to be related to his COPD.
He then had a needle placed on a right lung needle decompression was performed.
He remained hypotensive and pressors were started in addition to have bil chest tubes placed.
Both chest tubes were subsequently seen in the lung on CT imaging.
Possible right lower lobe infiltrate seen on imaging and he was covered with vancomycin and Cefepime.
Left chest tube was removed by thoracics on day # 2 with no pneumothorax seen on subsequent imaging.
Right chest tube was readjusted by thoracics on day #2 and they felt it was placed in the pleural space, even though CT chest revealed possible position in lung.
He was intially treated with steroids for 4 days because of COPD exacerbation and azithromycin for 5 days, with standing nebs.
He was also started on vanco and cefepime for a ?
There were many attempts to place pt on pressure support for trials of SBT which he failed due to labile BP and agitation.
His agitation and hypertension was thought to be related to ICU delirium, he was then started on Haldol PRN then switched to [**Hospital1 **] dosing of seroquel.
His drips were also changed: he was weanned off versed and had fentanyl bolus as needed for pain.
Given his sginficant COPD hx w/ recent hx of trach in [**4-/2194**] and failure of SBTs regardless of multiple attempts, he had a tracheostomy and a Peg tube placed by IP.
He then had a 2 bronhcial valve placed on [**2-16**], after the placmenet of his trach as noted above.
His antibiotics were then switched from vanco and cefepime which he was on for a 14 day course ([**Date range (1) 21801**]) to tx HAP pneumonia to Linezolid and [**Last Name (un) 2830**] given concern for resistant bacteria.
Their recommendation was to have a percutaneous gallbladder drain placed, however after discussion with the family they did not want to escalate care or have any surgical interventions.
So he was continued on Linezolid/[**Last Name (un) **] and added Cipro which was then switched to Tobramycin and [**Last Name (un) **] given concern for gallbladder/GI related bacteria leading to sepsis.
# SEPSIS: He became hypotensive during his initial presentation, and with ?
Given the severity of his illness and his tenous clinical status he was then started emperically on vancomycin and cefepime.
pneumonia on image and he was initially treated for 8 day course of antibiotics which was prolonged to 14 days since his clinical picture was still concerning for infection and he had increase in his WBC and recent procedure with placement of bronchial valves.
On his last day of antibiotics he then developed a significant fever with increase in his WBC to 19 K , hypotension requiring pressors, low urinary out up.
His LFT's also had a marked increase to ALT 4830, AST 7800,  AP 114.
Abx were changed to Vanco, Linezolid, Meropenem and Tobaramycin.
R SC line changed thinking of possible infectious sources.
Surgery was consulted and recommended a percutaneous drain which the family refused given change in goals of care to do not do any invassive procedures and preeceding his CMO code status.
He was requiring maximun dose of levophed prior to him being made CMO and his renal function was worsen while his transaminitis were slightly improving.
# Labile BP: He was initially hypotensive which was thought to be related to intubation and high PEEP with potential right sided pneumo and possible sepsis.
So he was treated for delerium/anxiety with changes in his drips adding standing seroquel.
His pain was also treated with fentanyl bolus.
However, even though his agitation improved he would still have episodes of hypertension.
He was then started on some of his home meds including losartan and carvedilol, in addition to lasix and as needed labetolol.
So we decreased home dose of medications and tried labetolol as needed.
We had discussed starting on nitro drip for better BP controlled, however he became hypotensive in the setting of sepsis and all his antihypertensives were stopped.
He was initially rate controlled and as he became septic around [**2-18**] he started having episodes of A-fib with RVR and hypotension.
We attempted to give small dose of BB then later CCB which lead to worse hypotension, he was then started on amioderone and his rythm was reverted to sinus.
We had previously discussed with the family possibility of CVVH however given changes in goals of care this was not done  # Transaminitis:  His ALT peaked in the 4000s while AST in the 7000s on the same day as his hypotension.
Surgery was consulted initially t for question of percutaneous drain placement for the distended gallbladder, which may be a source of sepsis; however family decided to not have any invasive procedures.
We also held Tylenol and other liver toxic medications.
On [**2-17**] and on [**2-18**] pt had oozing from multiple sites including trachea, ET tube, with ET suction, around central line, catheter and rectal tube.
He did not required transfusion and his bleeding improved.
He his versed drip was stopped and he was placed on seroquel in addition to the celexa that he was on.
He also had small doses of ativan as needed.
We treated his pain with fentanyl which was then switched to morphine which he appeared much more comfortable on this regimen.
# FEN: IV fluids as needed, replete electrolytes, NPO and he had Peg tube placed which he was receiving tube feeds # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin # Access: peripherals , central line, A-line # Communication: Patient, wife, daughter [**Name2 (NI) 21803**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21800**] and son, [**Doctor First Name 21804**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21805**] # Code: Initially full then DNR with escalation of care, then CMO on [**2-23**] # Disposition: Patient expired on [**2-23**] at early evening  17:55 .
