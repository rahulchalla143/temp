Admission Date:  [**2136-11-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-11-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-7-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension and hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 20400**] is a 51 yo M with a h/o diastolic heart failure, diabetes mellitus, COPD, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia on chronic steroids since [**2-/2136**], pulmonary emboli off coumadin [**3-6**] GI bleed, hypertension, tracheobronchomalacia, morbid obesity, and difficult intubation with recent hospitalization for shoulder pain s/p fall who was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic (SBPs in the 70s and SaO2 88%) on follow up clinic visit in the setting of abrupt cessation of steroids for cryptogenic organizing PNA (decreased from 25/day x 5 days to 5/day).
He received vanc and zosyn x1 for presumed bilateral lower extremity cellulitis.
CXR was clear, sats progressively decreased to 86% on 5L, improving to 99% on NRB, received 10 mg of decadron for presumed adrenal insufficiency, had ARF with Cr of 3.9 from baseline of 0.9 with good UOP, hyponatremia (129), troponin negative x2, EKG with NSR and no ST changes.
There was concern for pulmonary emboli, especially given past history but no CTA was performed due to ARF and no heparin gtt started.
He was started on levophed and transferred to the MICU.
Hypotension: Levophed was discontinued (SBP increased to 190s briefly) and SBP stabilized in 110s after dexamethasone, 1L IVF, and vanc/cef x1.
He was started on stress dose steroids (hydrocort 100 Q8H) and tapered to prednisone 50 mg QD the following day.
Autodiuresesd 1.7L in ICU with no diuretics.
He was weaned to 2L NC with sats in low 90s.
ACEi and spironolactone were held.
Cellulitis (chronic) treated with vanc and cefepime.
Also, the patient was noted to have asterixis, normal LFTs, and known EtOH abuse so he was started on CIWA scale with diazepam, gabapentin and lower dose narcotics (given recent hypotension).
On the floor VS were T 97.2, P79 BP 115/52 RR18 SaO2 94% on 2L NC   Past Medical History: -Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, dx via RML wedge resection [**2-/2136**], on chronic prednisone.
-Crush injury to his legs after being involved in a [**Doctor Last Name 9808**] collapse in [**2116**], leading to right knee replacement and bilateral femoral pins.
-Obesity -tracheobronchomalacia with difficult intubation -Severe obstructive sleep apnea -- restarted biPAP [**5-/2136**] -HTN -Hyperlipidemia -Diastolic CHF, EF>55% in [**8-11**] -Diabetes mellitus -- developed secondary to steroids -Depression and PTSD -Tobacco abuse -Alcohol abuse -Squamous cell carcinoma on dorsum of right hand s/p Mohs micrographic surgery -Back pain s/p multiple surgeries in cervical through lumbar spine on narcotics contract -Questionable h/o pericarditis with pericarial effusion requiring drainage at [**Hospital1 **] (patient report)  Social History: Per MICU admission note, and in speaking with patient: Lives alone in [**Location (un) 5289**].
Family History: Per MICU admission note - Brother with heart transplant for pericarditis - No other family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death.
Pulmonary opacities, better evaluated on the recent CT.  Brief Hospital Course: Hypotension: On transfer to the MICU, Levophed was discontinued, and systolic blood pressures stabilized in the 110s with dexamethasone, 1L IVF, and one dose of vancomycin and cefepime.
Mr. [**Known lastname 20400**] was continued on stress dose steroids (hydrocort 100 Q8H) which were tapered to prednisone 50 mg QD the following day and to prednisone 30 mg QD on transfer to the floor.
He remained on prednisone 30 mg throughout the remainder of hospitalization.
Hypoxia: Mr. [**Known lastname 72546**] hypoxia was felt to be due to acute respiratory acidosis and acute metabolic alkalosis from worsening chronic lung disease in the setting of a rapid steroid taper in addition to volume overload (as evidenced by recent weight gain, medication and diet noncompliance, and though proBNP was low at 106, his morbid obesity may artificially lower this result).
Following steroids and autodiuresis in the ICU, he was weaned to 2L NC with sats in low 90s; on transfer to the floor his O2 saturations were in the low 90s on room air, near baseline.
Pulmonary emboli was also considered as an etiology for his hypoxia, as his D-dimer was slightly elevated at 630, however LENIs were negative for DVT, he was not tachycardic, noncontrast chest CT showed no change from prior, and CTA could not be performed due to renal failure.
He was not considered a candidate for heparinization given recent history of a significant GI bleed, and his oxygenation status improved with steroids and diuresis (lasix 80mg IV X2).
He was maintained on DVT/PE prophylaxis with heparin SC TID.
He was treated with IVF in the MICU, and his ace-inhibitor and spironolactone were held.
Hyponatremia: Mr. [**Known lastname 72546**] hyponatremia improved from 129 to 134 with IVF and steroids.
Cellulitis: Mr. [**Known lastname 72546**] chronic lower extremity cellulitis with venous stasis was treated empirically with vanomycin and cefepime while in the MICU for ?infectious sepsis.
Antibiotics were stopped on transfer to the floor.
The patient was started on compression stockings and his legs elevated.
He was also started briefly on terbinafine for tinea pednis and onychomychosis management as these were felt to be exacerbating causes for his ongoing cellulitsi.
DM Type 2: Mr. [**Known lastname 20400**] was maintained on an insulin sliding scale and his evening basal lantus dose was adjusted daily.
Chronic pain: Mr. [**Known lastname 72546**] pain medications were gradually uptitrated.
His gabapentin was increased from 100 to 300 TID as his blood pressures and creatinine improved.
His oxycontin was increased from 30 to 40 to 50 mg Q8H with lower doses (10-15 mg Q6H of oxycodone) for breakthrough due to concerns over the effect large doses of short-acting opioids would have on his blood pressure.
Hypertension: Mr. [**Known lastname 72546**] ACE inhibitor and spironolactone were held throughout hospitalization.
He received 80 mg of Lasix IV daily while on the hospital floor.
He was continued on his home doses of bupropion and citalopram and was seen by social work and psychiatry daily while on the floor.
His prazosin was uptitrated from 1 mg to 2 mg nightly for nightmares.
He recieved thiamine, folate, and multivitamin daily.
Hyperlipidemia: He was maintained on his home statin on transfer to the floor.
In the future, Mr. [**Known lastname 20400**] should receive E-antigen negative products for all red cell transfusions.

Your blood pressure was thought to be low because your steroids were tapered too rapidly.
You will need a long steroid taper over several weeks.
While you are on higher doses of steroids, you will need more glargine/lantus insulin to prevent severely elevated blood sugars.
You should take 23u of lantus while you are taking prednisone 30mg.
You should taper your lantus while you taper your insulin as follows: *** prednisone 25mg, lantus 18mg *** prednisone 20mg, lantus 15mg *** prednisone 15mg or less, lantus, 12mg .
Given your history of intermittent kidney failure, you are at high risk for developing a side effect of metformin called lactic acidosis.
You may need slightly higher doses of insulin overall.
You should resume your other medications as you were prior to this hospitalization.
