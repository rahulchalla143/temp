He was begun on an intravenous heparin drip.
Intravenous hydration and Mucomyst preparation was begun because of his chronic renal insufficiency.
This demonstrated bilateral femoral-popliteal bypass grafts were intact.
The left renal artery which had previously received endarterectomy was widely patent; although, there was a fibrinous probable hyperplastic intima at the renal artery midportion prior to its bifurcation.
The bypass graft was visualized coming off the profunda, and there was no evidence of stenosis proximally.
Other recommendations were to add and aspirin after there was no surgical contraindication.
He underwent a left femoral to distal anterior tibial bypass jump graft from the lower end of the previous saphenous vein femoral-popliteal bypass to the distal anterior tibial artery using right arm vein, cephalic and basilic loop partially valve optimized.
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.
Otherwise, he received hydrocortisone stress perioperatively.
A hydrocortisone taper was begun.
