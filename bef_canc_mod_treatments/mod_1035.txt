Left ureteral stent placement.
Brief Hospital Course: 64yo M with HIV, HBV, HCV, HCC, cirrhosis status post orthotopic liver [**Year (4 digits) **] ([**6-4**]), a history of DVT/PE and nephrolithiasis, who was admitted on [**5-28**] for antibiotic treatment of a VRE UTI and bridge from coumadin to heparin for lithotripsy procedure [**6-1**].
# UTI/Urosepsis/Urolithiasis: On admission, an oupatient culture was reported as growing Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus.
Treatment of a VRE UTI infection with daptomycin was initated on [**5-28**], with a documented negative urine culture on [**5-31**].
On [**6-1**] patient underwent lithotripsy and placement of a stent.
He had taken off his heparin gtt and was walking around saying that he was ready to go home.
They continued to hold his heparin gtt at that time.
He was placed on 2L NC and improved.
He received a second L bolus and at 8 am this morning, was rigoring again with T 102.6, BP 110/50, P 100, R 36 and 97% on 2L.
A urine culture drawn at this time grew out polymicrobial (klebsiella, enterobacter, nonpsuedomonas nonfermenter) and the patient was appropriately started on meropenem on [**6-4**].
Urology confirmed placement and draining of stent on [**6-4**].
A larger foley was placed to aid in the drainage of the stones.
On [**6-7**] the patient had a PICC line placed for outpatient antibiotic administration.
The patient completed his course of daptomycin on [**6-12**].
The patient will continue PO Cipro until [**6-15**].
Other etiologies considered were hypoxia secondary to volume overload from IV fluid boluses (last echo in [**2132**] was normal) and pneumonia.
Antibiotic coverage for hospital acquired pneumonia with meropenem was started on [**6-2**] and vancomycin was added on [**6-3**] to provide better coverage for MRSA.
On transfer to the floors, the patient was continued on meropenem for possible hospital acquired pneumonia.
Vancomycin was stopped as per ID's recommendations.
Antibiotics were continued as discussed above.
On arrival to the hospital, a heparin bridge was initiated to prepare for the lithotripsy procedure.
On [**6-1**] the heparin was held, the patient underwent the lithotripsy, and the heparin gtt was restarted after the procedure.
The heparin was held during the events leading up the [**Hospital 228**] transfer to the MICU, resulting in subtherapeutic PTTs.
He was restarted on heparin in the MICU and bridged to coumadin.
On transfer to the floors, his INR was supratherapeutic, requiring adjustment of the coumadin to 5mg.
When the patient was transitioned to cipro, his coumadin was empirically lowered to 3mg.
His INR trended downwards and his coumadin was increased to 5mg.
On admission he had stable LFTs and no signs of encephalopathy on tacrolimus, cellcept, and bactrim prophyllaxis.
On [**6-2**] the patient was started on lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, then transitioned to rifaxamin on [**6-4**].
The patient was continued on his tacrolimus and cellcept.
He will require an INPATIENT stay for this biopsy so that he can bridged from coumadin to heparin prior to the procedure.
HIV: Stable, CD4 65, VL 120, immunosuppressed on anti-rejection medications.
No modifications were made to his HAART regimen (RiTONAvir, Raltegravir) and bactrim ppx.
Lyrica (for HIV neuropathy) was held while in MICU, but restarted on the floors.
DM: Stable, continue insulin sliding scale.
Depression: Continued mirtazapine and lexapro.
