Patient also reported increased fatigue, non-productive cough, neck stiffness, decreased PO intake and increased NSAID use in the setting of recent vocal cord surgery.
Patient was again treated with 20mg IV dilt and SBP dropped again again to the 60s.
CXR showed LLL pneumonia for which he received a dose of levaquin and was eventually intubated with worsening ABGs.
He was started on Neo dopa and vasopressin.

Initially the patient's pneumonia was treated with Flagyl, levofloxacin and vancomycin.
However, when an endotracheal sample grew out Strep pneumoniae his antibiotic regimen was switched to ceftriaxone.
At this time the patient's antibiotic regimen was again switched to penicillin alone and the antibiotics were discontinued.
With the severity of the patient's pneumonia, ceftriaxone was again added to the patient's antibiotic regimen to ensure broader coverage.
He was started on zosyn, flagyl & vancomycin.
Since the d/c of antibiotics he remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
He was extubated on [**8-17**], and he did very well with minimal supplemental oxygen.
His renal failure was felt to be secondary to his long-standing diabetes and hypertension in the setting of NSAID use, decreased p.o.
intake, dehydration and persistent hydrochlorothiazide and ACE inhibitor use and low blood pressure in the setting of pneumonia/sepsis.
He was initially started on a bicarb drip which was discontinued in the MICU as the patient's bicarb on his Chem-7 was greater than 20.
However, he eventually entered a polyuric phase of ATN with increased urine output.
Due to his septic shock and hypotension, he received many fluid boluses and was net + over 30 liters.
He was fairly aggressively diuresed with Lasix and required dopamine to maintain his BP & UOP.
Lastly, the patient received multiple liters of normal saline infusion and does likely have a non anion gap acidosis from this.
The patient was also hyperventilated on the vent which also helped improve his acidosis.
He was started on vasopressin, Neo-Synephrine and dopamine.
Upon arrival to the floor he was switched to Levophed, dopamine and vasopressin.
He had a central line placed for CVP measurement.
He was weaned off of dopamine and continued on Levophed and vasopressin.
Because the patient had persistent bradycardia, these two medications were stopped and he was started on dopamine at the time of this dictation.
On [**7-24**], when he became hypotensive, he was restarted on pressors, eventually requiring dopamine to maintain adequate MAPS & urinary output.
His blood was sent in a special tube for platelet analysis.
In addition, some element of bone marrow suppression was thought to be contributing to his thrombocytopenia.
Concern was for heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
Diabetes: The pt required close management of his blood sugars throughout his stay, and was on an insulin drip for most of the time he was intubated.
In the setting of broad spectrum antibiotic use, his INR increased to 3.1.
At this time he received vitamin K. Initial HIT panel showed HIT+, another cause of his thrombocytopenia.
There was discussion about starting argatroban or lepirudin for anticoagulation, but it was decided, in concert with heme, that the risks outweighed the benfits, and no further anticoagulation was started.
Occluded and expanded portal vein, right portal vein and anterior and posterior right portal vein with thrombus extending  down the SMV.
With these radiographic findings, anticoagulation was again considered.
