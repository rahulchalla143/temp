A nodular density seen adjacent and anterior to the right main pulmonary artery (2:23) may reflect a vessel.
A catheter is visualized within the visualized right upper extremity, which may reflect a PICC line that terminates within the right subclavian vein.
Additional small clustered foci of extraluminal air is seen adjacent to the proximal stomach and the gastroesophageal junction, with a focus of air tracking into the fissure of ligamentum venosum.
There is no obvious evidence of extravasation of oral contrast into the peritoneum.
Of note, a peritoneal dialysis catheter is in place that could represent a route of entry of intraperitoneal air.
A peritoneal dialysis catheter is in place and could represent the route of entry of free intraperitoneal air.
Large amount of free intra-abdominal fluid in the setting of peritoneal dialysis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 24 year old woman with ESRD secondary to SLE (started peritoneal dialysis approximately one week prior to admission), malignant HTN, h/o SVC syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events (on warfarin) who is presenting with persistent suprapubic/lower abdominal pain and new onset severe epigastric pain w/ nausea and vomiting, and hypertension.
The patient was empirically placed on IV flagyl, but this was discontinued when stool samples were negative for C.difficile.
A heparin drip and warfarin were started for treatment of possible microthrombotic ischemia, although this was stopped when the patient had evidence of a possible GI bleed.
Pericarditis was considered, but her EKG was unchanged from prior studies and there had been on interval increase in her pericardial effusion since [**2141-10-13**].
However, her abdominal CT on [**2141-10-26**] showed a large amount of free intra-abdominal fluid in the setting of peritoneal dialysis.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and immediately reported that both her epigastric and suprapubic pain were gone after the surgery.
Her hospital course was complicated by extremely labile HTN and was transferred back and forth between the MICU and the floor on three separate occasions ([**10-19**], [**10-21**], and [**10-22**]) for identical episodes of SBPs > 260.
Multiple medication regimens were attempted and changed throughout her hospital course.
However, her blood pressures finally stabilized when she was placed back on her oral home regimen, which includes nifedipine, clonidine patch, labetalol, aliskiren, and hydralazine, with a hydralazine sliding scale for SBPs > 180.
At discharge, the only change from her home regimen that was made was increasing her nifedipine to 90 mg PO.
Her regimen as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4883**]: Nifedipine SR 90 mg daily Aliskiren 150 mg [**Hospital1 **] Labetalol 300 mg TID Hydralazine 75 mg TID Clonidine patch 0.3 mg/24 hr patch qWed When SBP>180, she then uses a hydralazine sliding scale.
Prior to her exploratory laparotomy, she was scheduled to have peritoneal dialysis four times per day over 4hrs with 2% solution at 1.2L per PD.
After her exploratory laparotomy, surgery strongly advised the medical team that she should not restart peritoneal dialysis until she was at least 3 weeks out from her surgery.
As a result, after a long coversation with her primary renal physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] agreed to restart hemodialysis.
A tunneled catheter was placed in her R femoral vein on [**2141-11-1**] and she subsequently started hemodialysis the same day, which she tolerated well.
She underwent hemodialysis two more times prior to discharge.
She is expected to undergo hemodialysis (Tues/[**Last Name (un) **]/SAT) as an outpatient.
# H/O Thrombosis: The patient was initially placed on her home dose of warfarin 2mg qd.
She was also started heparin drip secondary to concern for ischemic bowel [**2-11**] microthrombotic disease.
The heparin drip was discontinued on [**10-22**].
The patient remained off heparin and coumadin from [**2141-10-23**] - [**2141-10-25**] given her drop in HCT and in preparation for a possible GI intervention.
After her surgery, her coumadin was held and she was off the heparin drip, but her INR continued to drift up, getting as high as 2.6 on [**2141-10-30**].
As a result, she was given a test dose of vitamin K, which she responded to well (Her INR came back down to 1.4).
As a result, her home dose of coumadin at 2 mg qday was restarted.
Both parties wanted to keep the patient on her home dose of prednisone of 4 mg qday, which was continued throughout her entire hospital course.
Patient attempted 1 trial of CPAP at 2L/min for 1-2 hrs with nasal mask, however did not tolerate as she complained of claustrophobia.
The paitent stated that she would pursue further work-up and treatment for OSA as an outpatient.
