HOSPITAL COURSE:  She came to this hospital on [**2104-12-24**], at which point she was febrile, hemostasis unstable, intubated, and on pressors.
She remained intubated and unstable and had repeated drops in her hematocrit despite multiple transfusions.
She was treated with H2 blockers for ulcer.
She was also on broad spectrum antibiotics for her sepsis.
Subsequently she continued to drop her hematocrit despite repeated transfusions.
This was injected with epinephrine, and she also received BIPAP treatment; however, the oozing still continued.
As the patient continued to have a transfusion requirement, Surgery was reconsulted for management of this bleeding duodenal mass.
