He was taken to Interventional radiology for drainage on [**2192-9-15**] and 2 drainage catheters were left in place.
The initial consistency was described as purulent and 70 cc was aspirated and sent for culture.
In the interim he was placed on Cipro and Flagyl.
Due to his debilitated state and possible need for long term antibiotics a PICC line was placed on [**2192-9-16**].
Many discussions with his sons took place in case surgery was necessary.
They did not want any surgery but wanted as much done as possible to try to get him back to his baseline.
Following transfer back to the Surgical floor he was started on TPN as he was taking minimal amounts orally and certainly not enough to maintain his nutritional needs.
His sons agreed to a PEG tube placement so as to wean the TPN and again hopefully get him to take a regular diet.
His PEG tube was placed on [**2192-10-3**] without difficulty and tube feeding were started later that evening.
His TPN was weaned off on [**2192-10-4**] and his PICC line remains for antibiotics.
As far as his abdominal abscess goes, repeat imaging was done on [**2192-9-19**] and [**2192-9-27**] without much change although the drainage catheters were in the proper place and patent.
His antibiotics were stopped after a ten day course on [**2192-9-26**] and he subsequently spiked a temperature of 101.6 on [**2192-9-27**].
He was restarted on Fluconazole and Zosyn.
He has no abdominal tenderness and will remain on antibiotics until [**2192-10-17**].
After a  difficult course he returns to rehab on tube feedings which can be gradually increased to a goal of 60 cc/hr, IV antibiotics and abdominal drains to bulb suction.
He will return to the [**Hospital 2536**] Clinic in 4 weeks for evaluation and possible removal of the drains.
