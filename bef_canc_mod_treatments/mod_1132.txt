Stable appearance of the ascending thoracic aortic graft and widely patent left axillary to femoral bypass graft.
He was found to have inflammatory changes in his retroperitoneum and a large inflammatory phlegmon at his rectus.
The distal portion of his axillofemoral graft was detached and a saphenous vein graft was placed.

Patient remained intubated on return from OR  Due to his massive bleeding and transfusion requirements, he developed abdominal compartment syndrome overnight and was taken back to the OR on [**4-25**] for exploration of retroperitoneal space, washout of retroperitoneal space and intra abdominal cavity, packing of the retroperitoneum with Ioban closure of the abdominal incision which was left open.

Sedation was transitioned to Precedex and vent was changed to PSV, with improvement in alertnent.
Systolic blood pressure rose to 200s with agitation, which responded to Fentanyl and hydralazine.
When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.

GI: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until tolerating oral intake.
He was also started on a bowel regimen to encourage bowel movement.
Pt did have trouble with nutrion, started on dronabinol  2.5 mg PO BID.
Pt also had loose stools - neg C Diff x 3, d/c'ed IV flagyl per ID  GU: Foley was removed when apprpriate.
