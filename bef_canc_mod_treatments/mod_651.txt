PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Showed a temperature of 98, blood pressure 91/46, heart rate 129, respiratory rate 25, O2 sat 99% on mechanical ventilation.
His goal blood pressure was set at 130s-170s using IV fluids and vasopressors as needed.
He was placed on cardiac and respiratory monitors.
Blood and urine cultures were obtained, and he was started on antibiotics for the fever.
He was also started on Plavix for secondary stroke prophylaxis.
He was emergently given 50 grams of mannitol for presumed cerebral herniation, and his respiratory rate on the ventilator was increased to decrease his PCO2.
A hemicraniectomy was considered but felt not to be indicated due to the poor overall prognosis.
At that time, it was decided not to pursue the hemicraniectomy given the overall poor prognosis.
