# POST OP HYPOTENSION: Multifactorial in this elderly woman with severe valvular heart disease and fixed cardiac output, acute blood loss, and sedation / intraoperative beta blocker administration.
Lastly, although sinus tachycardia / atrial fibrillation is compensatory in setting of hypovolemia, given her fixed cardiac output she may have benefited from more agressive rate control, however difficult to do in setting of vasopressor requirement.
Patient was maintained on Neosynephrine drip and transfused a total of 3 units of PRBC over 48hrs.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Most likely result of poor forward flow from AS and also from hypovolemia and anemia.
