They recommended a 10 day course of antibiotics (initially ceftriaxone/clindamycin, transition to levofloxacin prior to discharge).
At time of discharge, strongyloides serologieis and HCV PCR were pending.
3) Hyperlipidemia: The patient's lipitor, which had been held in the setting of acute illness, was restarted prior to discharge  4) Edema/mild CHF: EF 50-55%, [**12-24**]+ MR, impaired LV relaxation.
Following transfer to the floor, the patient was noted to have marked lower extremity edema, which improved with furosemide diuresis.
This likely represents fluid overload in the setting of volume resuscitation while in the ICU.
He was started on low dose furosemide, and will have his electrolytes checked within 1 week followed discharge to ensure stability.
