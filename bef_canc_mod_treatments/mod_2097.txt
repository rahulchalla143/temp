On [**2105-3-5**], the patient was called out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit after an extended course there, in which she was intubated and received a tracheostomy, and was treated for multiple infections.
At the time of her discharge, the patient's history has included pulmonary issues with her being on a tracheostomy mask at 40% but off all antibiotics and on albuterol and Atrovent inhalers as needed.
From a cardiovascular standpoint, she was on Lopressor, Norvasc for hypertension, amiodarone for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
From a gastrointestinal standpoint, the patient had reportedly had some recent abdominal pain and was receiving morphine as needed for this, also Protonix and a bowel regimen.
A urinalysis was done which ultimately grew out Klebsiella culture and she was started on ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day for this.
From [**3-8**], the patient continued on ciprofloxacin and had no new issues.
The only changes to her medications were that her Norvasc was discontinued since it was deemed that she had these occasional low blood pressure episodes and she likely did not need this, as she could tolerate slightly higher blood pressures.
