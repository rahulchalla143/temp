During the hospital course the patient had a new onset atrial fibrillation and DDD pacemaker was placed and patient was started on Amiodarone.
He went to the cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**] on [**7-3**] where pacemaker was interrogated and one episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was noted on the pacer.
The patient was switched from Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] to Toprol 25 mg q d in order to improve his sleeping.
Over the last couple of weeks the patient has also been complaining of neck and shoulder bone pain, chills and spells in which he reportedly looked [**Doctor Last Name 352**], according to the wife.
The patient was put on C-pap and given Morphine and Ativan for agitation and Lasix and started on Nitro drip.
His respiratory rate fell with the C-pap and his O2 sats improved.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes hypertension, coronary artery disease, syncopal event, atrial fibrillation, right colon cancer, status post resection in [**2099**], left colon cancer status post resection in [**2115**], benign prostate hyperplasia status post prostatectomy in [**2116**], thalamic bleed secondary to hypertension in [**2125**] and a renal mass, hemorrhagic cyst in [**2129**].
ALLERGIES:  ACE inhibitor which causes angioedema.
MEDICATIONS:  Outpatient medications include Amiodarone 200 mg q d, Fluconazole 100 mg q d, Nystatin 100,000 units, [**3-28**] ml qid and Toprol 25 mg q d.  In the hospital the patient was given Morphine 4 mg, Lasix 200 mg IV, Ativan 2 mg and the Nitro drip.
He was lying in bed, sedated with C-pap mask on with deep breathing and no acute distress.
Cardiovascular:  The patient has known coronary artery disease, he was started on Aspirin.
Heparin was initially held secondary to his history of thalamic bleed and the fact that he had guaiac positive stools on his last admission on [**6-17**].
Beta blockers were also initially held secondary to his CHF.
On admission his CPK was 141 and troponin 2.3.
The patient was started on IV Heparin.
Possible options were discussed with him including surgical, PCI and medical management.
It was agreed upon that the patient would give a trial of medical management for the time being and if he became symptomatic, he would then go for PCI.
He had no longer had shortness of breath or chest pain and IV Heparin was discontinued and patient was started on beta blocker.
Pump:  Since his chest x-ray was consistent with CHF, the patient was started on Lasix and diuresed 2??????
Along with beta blocker, patient was started on Isordil, initially 10 mg tid, then 20 mg tid.
He was later switched to Imdur 30 mg q d for discharge.
Long-term anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis was determined to be unnecessary and would be too risky due to the patient's history of thalamic bleeding.
He was started on 25 mg of Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], however, during the course of his admission, he was noted to have a sustained run of atrial fibrillation lasting over three hours.
The patient was also started on Amiodarone initially 400 mg tid but later decreased to [**Hospital1 **] as per EP consult.
The patient will be taking Amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for the next 7 days at which point he will go to a 400 mg q d dose indefinitely.
Pulmonary:  Patient initially was in respiratory distress requiring C-pap with pressor support with the face mask, however, after diuresis, the patient no longer required face mask and was put on nasal cannula for which he tolerated having good O2 sats.
During the hospital course the patient initially was on nasal canaculi 2 liters.
He was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
He was again transfused one unit of packed red blood cells in order to protect his coronary artery disease.
Since on last admission he was noted to be iron deficient, the patient was started on Iron Sulfate 325 mg q d for which he will take after discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol 50 mg po bid, Imdur 30 mg po q d, Amiodarone 400 mg po bid for the first 7 days, then Amiodarone 400 mg po q d indefinitely, Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg po q d, Aspirin 325 mg po q d.
