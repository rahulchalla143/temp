Central access was obtained via a right femoral line, and fluids and dopamine were started, with stabilization in her pressures.
She was given intravenous levofloxacin and Flagyl.
While in the Emergency Room, she became increasingly wheezy and labored, which improved with nebulizers and 20 mg of intravenous lasix.
Left atrial myxoma status post embolus in the left middle cerebral artery, right hemiparesis and aphasia 2.
Breast cancer status post left mastectomy in [**2133**] 7.
Status post three cesarean sections 8.
Status post right cataract surgery, left eye glaucoma 10.
Trazodone 50 mg by mouth daily at bedtime 2.
Paxil 20 mg by mouth once daily 3.
Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once daily 4.
Neurontin 600 mg by mouth three times a day 5.
Multivitamin one tablet once daily 6.
Calcium carbonate 650 mg by mouth twice a day 7.
Atrovent/albuterol metered dose inhalers as needed 8.
Timoptic 0.5% to left eye twice a day 9.
Xalatan 0.005% to left eye daily at bedtime  ALLERGIES:   Digoxin, erythromycin  SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient is a resident, with her husband, at the [**Hospital3 **] Center.
The patient's extremity examination shows the patient to be contracted and hemiparetic in the right upper and lower extremities.
Chem 7 showed a sodium of 139, potassium 8.3, chloride 104, bicarbonate 20, BUN 37, creatinine 1.9, glucose 120.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   Upon admission, the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and stabilized with dopamine, then Neo-Synephrine and intravenous fluids until [**5-7**], when all pressors were discontinued.
The patient had continued coverage with levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
The patient was switched to intravenous ceftriaxone on [**5-8**].
Also the patient was treated for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare with nebulizers and intravenous Solu-Medrol.
Ativan, lasix, morphine sulfate and nebulizers were used with good effect.
Noted to have decreased mental status and less responsiveness following anxiolytics and morphine sulfate.
The patient also underwent a swallowing study, which was positive for aspiration, and had to have a nasogastric tube placed in order to start feedings.
The patient was noted to be slightly hypernatremic, and was started on nasogastric tube water boluses.
The patient was also noted to have decreased platelets, and heparin and Zantac were stopped as possible antiplatelet agents (antiheparin antibodies were sent, which were negative).
Given that the patient had been started on levofloxacin as well as Flagyl, it was decided to change the patient's antibiotic coverage to ceftriaxone 1 gram every 24 hours, based on her renal clearance.
Multiple cultures, including stool, urine, blood and a left intravenous catheter tip remained no growth to date, however, urine samples taken three days prior to discharge demonstrated urine cultures positive for yeast.
This was felt to be a result of extensive antibiotic use, and no treatment for yeast urinary tract infection was indicated at that time.
The exact etiology of the patient's low-grade temperatures was not clear.
At the time of discharge, the patient was scheduled to have four additional days of ceftriaxone to treat the proteus urinary tract infection as well as proteus sepsis (cultures taken early on during the patient's admission demonstrated one out of four blood culture bottles positive for proteus.
