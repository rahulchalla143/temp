On [**2160-6-27**] the abscess was drained under the CT guidance and a drain was left in place.
She was discharged from the hospital on [**2160-7-1**] on ciprofloxacin and Flagyl with the drain in place.
Several days after discharge, her antibiotics were switched to Augmentin, as she reported nausea to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] via the phone.
The drain was positioned within the abscess.

Pigtail catheter remains in place.
Similar size of left upper quadrant abscess, now with drain in place.
Persistent appearance of fluid collection in right upper quadrant with subtle rim enhancement.
This fluid collection is not grossly changed since [**7-25**] but is amenable for percutaneous drainage/drain placement as discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 4 p.m. 2.
Interval decrease in size of left upper quadrant and right lower quadrant fluid collections, with pigtail percutaneous drainage catheters in place.
[**2160-8-8**] IR PICC line Placement  [**2160-8-8**] MRA/MRI Brain MRA IMPRESSION: Non-visualization of the left internal carotid artery in the petrous and cavernous as well as supraclinoid portions indicate occlusion in the neck.
A drain is located in the left upper quadrant.
Brief Hospital Course: 71yo F with splenectomy, on chronic steroids who presented with unresolved subdiaphragmatic abscess despite adequate drain placement and antibiotics.
Given that the abscess continued despite appropriate drain placement and antibiotics, she was taken to the OR for laparoscopic converted to open extended left colectomy with colorectal anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy.
She required aggressive fluid resuscitation for low urine output and lactic acidosis and she was given stress-dose steroids.
She was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn and micafungin was added when peritoneal fluid gram stain showed budding yeast, which ultimately grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**].
When her WBC did not decrease her antibiotic regimen was changed to Vanc/meropenem/micafungin.
She became consistently normotensive on post-op day 3 and began mobilizing her fluids on post-op day 4 and was given small doses of Lasix and then placed on a Lasix drip on post-op day 6 with a goal of [**11-24**] L negative per day.
She was diuresed on the Lasix drip for another week until her weight returned to baseline.
Her heart rate was controlled with metoprolol IV and hypertension was controlled with increased diuresis.
Also near post-operative day 4 the patient was noted to have some decreased movement on right side while intubated and a CT of the head was obtained which showed: cortical hypodensity in the left frontoparietal region, no significant mass effect or volume loss which appeared to represent a subacute infarction, no encephalomalacic changes in the right occipital lobe, and no intracranial hemorrhage or brain herniation.
325mg Aspirin therapy was continued.
On post-op day 8 purulent drainage was expressed from the drain exit site and she underwent bedside incision and drainage.
Purulent fluid was drained and the site was packed with wet to dry dressing changes.
This was opened and washed out and packing was placed for wet to dry dressing changes.
After wet to dry dressing therapy with antimicrobial Kerlix gauze and debridement, it was decided that VAC therapy would most effectively manage these wounds.
On post-op day 8 she was started on tube feeds which were ultimately advanced to a goal of 55cc/h, which she tolerated well.
The patients ability to safely tolerate a regular diet was assessed on postop day 15 by the speech and swallow team and the patient failed the first attempt at which time tube feedings were continued.
The patient remained stable in the ICU and was transferred to the floor on postop day 18 with a Dobbhoff Tube for feeding.
On postop day 20 the Dobbhoff Feeding Tube was found to be in the esophagus and was removed.
The patient was cleared for a ground solid and thin liquid diet.
With encouragement and supervision the patient was able to take in a moderate amount of nutrition and she was supplemented with liquid supplements at all meals.
Peripheral access was obtained however after consideration of the duration of the antibiotic and antifungal therapy needed, a PICC line was placed in the left upper extremity by interventional radiology.
Which appeared to show no new focal collection within the abdomen or pelvis, interval decrease in size of left upper quadrant and right lower quadrant fluid collections, with pigtail percutaneous drainage catheters in place, low attenuation pelvic fluid collection appears similar as before, Improved appearance of lower midline and left hemi abdominal wall wounds as compared to [**2160-7-31**], and interval decrease of bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
The patient was continued on Aspirin 325mg daily.
She will follow up as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6938**] of neurology and will receive occupational therapy and physical therapy at the acute rehabilitation center after discharge.
Cultures were routinely monitored and the patient was continued on intravenous Vancomycin, Meropenem and Micafungin for optimal coverage through the time of discharge and will continue on these medications until approximately one week after her drain is taken out per the recommendations of the infectious disease team.
She will also have repeat imaging as an outpatient to evaluate for resolution of her intra-abdominal abscesses with are believed to be her continuing source of infection.
Her blood glucose levels have been elevated at lunch and covered with sliding scale insulin however, it would be in the patients best interest to have an endocrine consult at the rehabilitation facility for continued monitoring.

Your current antibiotic/antifungal regimen is prescribed exactly for the microorganisms that have caused your infection and these should continue while you have the drain in your left side and at least 7 days after it has been removed.
You have follow up appointments with the infectious disease clinic here at the hospital and you should have weekly labs drawn to monitor the medications you are currently taking.
You have also had some waxing and waining confusion since the breathing tube was removed from your throat.
You do not require additional medication than aspirin, but you must follow-up with neurology as listed below and participate in occupational and physical therapy at the rehabilitation hospital.
At this appointment Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will monitor the abcess in your left upper quadrant where the drain is located and evaluate the rest of the abdomen and determine if that drain can be removed.
You will recieve IV antibiotics through your PICC line.
You will continue the VAC dressing therapy and the left upper quadrant drain will remain in place until Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommends it is removed.
