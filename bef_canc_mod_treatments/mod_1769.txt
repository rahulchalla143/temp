Per daughter and wife, patient was experiencing on and off chest pains since [**Month (only) 404**] with associated L arm numbness.
Daughter would see him lefting his left arm up with the right as he couldn't move it voluntarily during these episodes.
PCP had recently increased his lasix dose from 20mg to 40mg daily.
He also recently went to an urgent care clinic 4 days prior to presentation and was given Azithromycin for presumed CAP.
Art line placed upon transfer to CCU.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

On left side a mild amount of calcified plaque is seen in the common and internal carotid arteries.
On the right side peak systolic velocities were 24 cm/sec for the common carotid artery and 203 cm/sec for the external carotid artery.
On the left side peak systolic velocities were 75 cm/sec for the proximal internal carotid artery, 106 cm/sec for the mid internal carotid artery, 100 cm/sec for the distal internal carotid artery and 55 cm/sec for the common carotid artery.

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 8711**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Approved: SUN [**2195-7-5**] 8:53 PM   Brief Hospital Course: 72 y/o male with PMHx of Ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe AS, Severe PVD and other medical comorbidities admitted after PEA arrest with CHF exacerbation s/p diuresis and hemodynamic optimization  # PUMP: ECHO shows LVEF of 45% with mild MR and AS.
The patient was aggressively diuresed and put on nitro gtt titrated to appropriate BPs while in the ICU.
He was optimized hemodynamically with captopril and metoprolol tartrate.
These medications were then switched to Lisinopril 10 mg daily and PO Lasix as well as Sprironolactone.
Patient was over net 6.5 L out, on nasal cannula and discharge.
Given the collaterals supported adequate flow, the CAD was thought to be chronic in nature and no intervention was performed in cath lab.
Aspirin and atorvastatin were continued.
The patient's heparin was discontinued on [**7-11**] as the patient's clinical status improved.
A heparin drip was started.
The vascular surgery team did not recommend intervention as he is a poor surgical candidate and the operation would be major.
His metformin was discontinued on admission to the hospital and his glucose was kept under good control with insulin.
His metoprolol was increased to 125 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Diabetes: The patient will be discharged on his pre-admission dose of metformin without any insulin.
Medications on Admission: Preadmissions medications listed are incomplete and require futher investigation.

Ambulatory Status: _____________---______   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr [**Known lastname 111747**],  You came to the hospital after a cardiac arrest at an outside hospital with congestive heart failure and intubated (tube in your airway).
You improved with the diuresis and also with control of your blood pressure using Metoprolol Tartrate 125mg twice a day and decreased your previous dose of Lisinopril to 10mg daily.
As you were being treated for your heart failure, we were able to wean you off the ventilator that you came to [**Hospital3 **] requiring and eventually extubate it.
You will be discharged on Metoprolol Tartrate 125 mg [**Hospital1 **], Lasix 20 mg PO daily, Spironolactone 12.5 mg daily (new medication), and Lisinopril 10 mg.
For your coronary artery disease, we put you on medical management including Aspirin 325mg, Atorvastatin 20mg, and the above doses of your Metoprolol and Lisinopril.
We consulted vascular surgery who suggested we put you on a Heparin drip (a blood thinner) and your pulses returned and your foot became warm and pink.
The source was unsure at first with an unidentified reason for your hemoglobin dropping.
You were transfused with a total of 4 units of Red Blood Cells and your hemoglobin was checked to make sure that you no longer were bleeding.
Your Heparin was also adjusted at that time.
We have recommended to receive open heart surgery to help treat these problems.
A carotid artery ultrasound (a non-invasive test looking at the blood vessels in your neck) was done showing complete blockage of your right carotid artery and a 40% narrowing of your left.
