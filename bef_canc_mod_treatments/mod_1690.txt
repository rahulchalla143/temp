Head CT was conducted, which was within normal limits with no acute changes or intracranial hemorrhages, however, subsequently  patient had bright red hematemesis of approximately 700 cc and nasogastric tube was attempted, but not tolerated.
He was given Ativan and Protonix 40 intravenous times one and Octreotide 50 GTT and he was given 1 unit of fresh frozen platelets, platelets, 1 unit of packed red blood cells, 2 liters normal saline and 1 gram of Ceftriaxone intravenous and 10 mg of vitamin K subq on a banana bag.
Given the patient's gross hematemesis on presentation the patient was transferred to the MICU and admitted for treatment and evaluation.
MEDICATIONS: Vicodin for pain.
O2 sat 95% on room air.
His head CT showed no hemorrhage and small soft tissue attenuation, but most likely status post trauma, but no acute changes.
Therefore he was given platelets and fresh frozen platelets for coagulopathy and vitamin K as well.
He was also transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells to stabilize his hematocrit.
He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which showed varices, however, he started having alcohol withdraw at the time so the esophagogastroduodenoscopy was halted and the patient was intubated and treated for alcohol withdraw.
He was transferred to the floor from the MICU on [**2113-7-13**] to the [**Hospital1 139**] Service for further management of his hematemesis and gastrointestinal bleed.
He was continued on Octreotide to prevent further bleeding and the patient denied any further reports of gross hematemesis during the hospital course.
The patient was also treated with Nadolol 40 mg q.d.
and he continued to show no signs of ascites and no evidence indicating SBP, therefore he was not started on Fluoroquinolone.
He was also continued on his proton pump inhibitor with good results.
Acute blood loss:  Decrease in hematocrit and acute blood loss was thought to be secondary to esophageal varices, which on esophagogastroduodenoscopy was grade three.
Banding of the varices, however, stabilized his hematocrit and his transfusion requirement.
The platelets were at 41 on presentation and with acute gastrointestinal bleed status post 1 unit of platelets and fresh frozen platelets as needed on the MICU.
He was given vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma and platelets.
Subsequently he did well without further need of coagulation factors.
Ethanol and drug abuse:  His serum tox and urine tox indicated the patient had been recently on alcohol and he was started on a CIWA scale with Ativan p.r.n.
FEN:  The patient had hypokalemia on admission and given his chronic ethanol abuse the patient's calcium, magnesium and phosphate and other electrolytes were repleted prn.
Thiamine, folic acid were also given he was initially NPO given the gastrointestinal bleed, but following his banding he was restarted on a house diet.
The MRI revealed two focal hepatic lesions with imaging characteristics most consistent with hemangiomas concerning the presence of cirrhosis were quite evident in the MRI and dilatations and sequences;  follow imaging in approximately four months is to be considered.
On discharge the patient was given instructions on continuation of Nadolol and proton pump inhibitor.
His follow up plan was to have a repeat banding of his esophageal varices on [**8-3**] at 1:00 p.m. at the GI Unit on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
