She initially presented on [**2125-8-5**] with 1 day of nausea, vomitting, and abdominal pain.
The patient denies any fevers, chills, chest pain, SOB, dizziness, or bloody/black tarry stools.
She complains of significant abdominal bloating, distension, and dry mouth.

Multiple dilated loops of small bowel, with fluid distension of the colon.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo female with HTN, HL, lung mass, and rheumatoid arthritis admitted for recurrent idiopathic ileus ([**2125-8-18**]), with hospital course complicated by acute decompensation in respiratory status due to saddle PE and heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
Pt had slight wheezing on physical exam so nebulizer treatments were given, dose of solumedrol was given as well but no improvement seen.
Lasix was then given for possibility of overload with no improvement.
Pt became hypercarbic and continued with increased work of breathing so she was intbuted and placed on AC mechanical ventilation; she had a recent associated episode of RUQ, right flank pain ([**8-21**]) two days prior which was concerning for pleuritic chest pain and PE.
Right IJ central line placed and the patient was placed on levophed drip with good response.
She was placed on an argatroban drip for anticoagulation adjusted for a PTT goal of 60-80.
During this episode, the patient was intubated for respiratory distress, but upon discharge from the MICU was extubated successfully extubated and transferred on 2L NC saturating between 96-100%.
She was also bridged to coumadin anticoagulation upon transfer with goal INR of 2.5.
She will likely need coumadin for long term anticoagulation.
Pt was successfully bridged on argatroban to coumadin and currently has INR =2.3.
# Heparin induced thrombocytopenia - Pt had a drop in her platelet count by >50% from 132 to 56.
Discontinued all heparin products when drop occurred as the concern was for HIT since this drop in platelets ocurred after induction of heparin drip s/p PE.
She was started on argatroban as above for her PE with transition to coumadin.
Right IJ central line was discontinued when the patient did not require access for argatroban and TPN.
PICC was placed on [**9-4**] and will continue vancomycin for 14 days from last negative BC [**2125-7-30**] --> last day of vanco [**9-13**].
Nasogastric tube was placed to suction.
Levofloxacin and flagyl were begun for empiric coverage of diverticulitis; pt completed a 14 day course of abx  # Diarrhea - Pt complaining of chronic diarrhea x50 yrs.
Pt started on cholestryramine and nortryptaline per GI recs for symptomatic improvement.
Given current labile state with PE and anticoagulation, held off on biopsy to be rescheduled on discharge.
# Hypertension: BP meds were decreased in setting of hypotension; restarted meds and gently titrating up.
She was d/cd on Metoprolol 25mg TID, Lisinopril 5 mg po daily, and HCTZ 25 mg po daily.
Treated with Metoprolol 25 TID for HTN.
# Thrush - nystatin swabs.
Creatine bump was likely prerenal in etiology; patient was dehydrated since NPO and Cr trended down with fluid repletion.
# PPX: Protonix and agatrobran bridged to coumadin; patient only on Coumadin upon discharge.

While you were being treated with "heparin", a type of blood thinner, you had a reaction to heparin which caused you to have low platelets in your blood.
Your blood thinner was changed to a different type of IV blood thinner and now to oral blood thinner called "coumadin."
Also during your time here, you completed a full course of antibiotics for "diverticulitis" or an infection in an outpouching of your bowel.
You also had a bacterial infection of your blood for which you are now taking an antibiotic called "vancomycin."
In addition to your new antibiotic and coumadin medications, some of your blood pressure medication doses have been changed due to fluctuations in your blood pressure and you have been started on new medications for your diarrhea.
