Exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions (3 hours), rectosigmoid resection and coloproctostomy, mobilization of the splenic flexure, repair of ventral hernia, post colostomy.
History of Present Illness: 67F with h/o obstructing sigmoid mass of indeterminant pathology s/p chemo/rads and resection of mass with transverse colostomy ([**9-20**]).
Presented for left ureteral stent placement (which was unsuccessful) and elective resection of strictured sigmoid.

A #22 French cystoscope was inserted into the urethra which was normal.
A #8 French tapered catheter was gently inserted into the left distal ureteral orifice and 5 cc of contrast dye was injected which revealed a distal ureter with complete retrograde obstruction.
A straight sensor wire was attempted to be placed beyond the strictured area but was unable.
At this point the decision was made to abort the stent placement rather than continued attempts at the wire placement or ureteroscopy without wire access which can result in ureteral rupture.
PLAN:  The patient will likely require a left percutaneous nephrostomy tube and possible antegrade wire access which may allow retrograde access to the stricture and possibly the stone.
[**MD Number(2) 66700**]  PROCEDURE:  Exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions (3 hours), rectosigmoid resection and coloproctostomy, mobilization of the splenic flexure, repair of ventral hernia, post colostomy.
She underwent resection and then a protective colostomy because of the fact that the anastomosis never seemed to heal and indeed the most recent barium enema revealed that she did not have adequate healing and as a matter of fact had several leaks, probably disruptive of the anastomosis either because of tension, which I had doubted, or because of the previous radiation.
After preparation the following procedure was carried out.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  Under satisfactory general anesthesia the patient was placed supine and prepped and draped in the usual manner.
We opened up the left paramedian incision and were able to free-up of lysis of adhesions in the pelvis which were extensive and which required extensive revision starting with the ligament Treitz taking down the previous feeding jejunostomy, but in fact we were able to get the entire pelvis freed up without any difficulty.
There was only one area where there was ballooning out of the serosa which was later repaired with interrupted 5-0 Prolene and we were then able to go to work on the previous rectosigmoid which required rectosigmoid resection in order to get an adequate connection with the anastomosis on the bottom.
Initial attempt at irrigation did not pass any fluid into the pelvis, only later when we mobilized the colon and had a hole in it was there any irrigation that came through.
After this and the anastomosis we then changed gowns and gloves for closure, irrigated and then checked for hemostasis in the left upper quadrant, as well as around in the pelvis.
A closure of the hernia was done internally first with approximating the fascia from within with interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures and then closing the peritoneum under it with a #1 Vicryl suture.
We decided not to do a feeding jejunostomy because there was no anastomosis between the mouth and the transverse colostomy.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**MD Number(1) 26005**]   Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 1743**] [**Known lastname 54371**] underwent cystoscopy, left retrograde pyelogram, and attempted left stent placement.
After the procedure she was admitted to the surgery service under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**].
The following day she underwent exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, rectosigmoid resection and coloproctostomy, mobilization of the splenic flexure, and repair of ventral hernia.
She tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the floor after recovery in the PACU.
Troponin was negative.
Lasix was provided.
She remained tachycardic despite beta blockade.
PICC line was placed and TPN started.
Later in the evening she was intubated for respiratory distress.
At POD 9 she underwent percutaneous drain placement in the retroperitoneal fluid collection.
A left nephrostomy tube was placed with antegrade nephrostogram showing probable transected left ureter with free extravasation of contrast into the pelvis.
Abdominal drain began to appear bilious.
The pigtail catheter was exchanged.
She was receiving CBI for hematuria.
Nephrostomy continued to drain clear urine.
The urinary catheter was discontinued.
The pigtail catheter drainage was decreased to ~50ml per day with increased ostomy output.
She remained NPO with TPN for nutritional support.
TPN was continued and cycled over night.
Nephrostomy remained in place and draining adequately.
A PICC line was placed and the CVL was removed.
A PICC line was placed prior to discharge for TPN, as she was not taking in adequate calories.
The pigtail and nephrostomy tubes remained.
