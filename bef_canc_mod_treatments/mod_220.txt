There is irregularity of the cartilage of medial tibial plateau posteriorly, with subjacent bone marrow edema.
This is a nonspecific finding, of uncertain etiology.
The differential is extensive, but given the multifocal nature of the abnormality, it may represent changes of renal osteodystrophy Discharge Labs: [**7-5**] WBC 7.7, Hct 34.3, Plt 157 [**7-4**]: 134/4.5/94/27/45/5.9<103 Ca 6.7, Mg 2.4, Phos 6.0 [**7-5**] CK 22   Brief Hospital Course: 32 y/o female with complicated past medical history with SLE with decubitus ulcers admitted for fever and pain control.
However, she was hemodynamically stable after fluid resuscitation and discharged to the floor.
Emperic antibiotics, Vancomyocin and Meropenem were started.
Several surgical subspecialties were consulted for possible debridement and flap reconstruction.
She was transitioned to tigicycline antibiotics to increase the antibiotic penetration in the skin.
She was restarted on Daptomycin and Meropenem.
Per infectious disease, she will require 8 weeks of antibiotics with Daptomyocin and Meropenem.
She will also need weekly CK levels for daptomycin treatment.
She will need a wound vac for her ulcer, and a PICC line for her antibiotics to be placed at rehab.
She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17597**] [**Name (STitle) 1007**] [**Doctor Last Name **] at [**Hospital1 100**] Outpatient clinic for wound care on [**7-13**].

Ortho was consulted for possible brace, however they felt there was no need at this time for intervention or stabilization.
Her current regiment of Fentanyl Patch 75 mg q72h, Dilaudid 8 mg q4 PRN pain allows her to rest comfortably without oversedation, or hypotension.
She was also kept on her  Pregabaline, and Liderm patch (tendonitis of the shoulder).
For wound changes in the hospital she received Dilaudid 1-2 mg IV.
Her vitamin D-25 hydroxy level will need to be followed up.
Recently her Calcitrol dose was changed from 0.25 to 0.5 mg, due to a PTH level of [**2176**] and CT findings consistent with osteopenia.
She received her antibiotics after [**Year (4 digits) 2286**].
In order to ensure adequate fluid removal at [**Year (4 digits) 2286**], she should receive her midodrine prior to [**Year (4 digits) 2286**], at noon, and at 4 pm.
Her calcium level has remained low so she was not restarted on her cinacalcet.
SLE:  She was maintained on her home dose of Prednisone 5 mg daily.
Due to her infected decubitis ulcer, we opted to treat her synovitis with local steroids.
