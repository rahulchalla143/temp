She was intubated and started on pressors and antibiotics; including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and Flagyl.
These antibiotics were then changed to Unasyn and vancomycin.
On [**2-19**], antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and ceftazidime.
On [**2-21**], these were changed to vancomycin and meropenem for pneumonia once sensitivities were determined.
She received hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.
A Neurology consultation on [**2-23**] found the patient able to follow one-step commands and state her name, and her encephalopathy was attributed to sepsis.
On [**2-24**], she was found to have dark drainage from her nasogastric tube which was thought to be blood.
Anticoagulation was not started given the patient's risk of a gastrointestinal bleed.
She was managed with oxygen up to 100% on nonrebreather and then weaned downward.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun.
She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where she was rapidly weaned from pressors, and she was treated for her pseudomonal pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
She continued to have minimal output from her colostomy secondary to her obstruction by tumor.
She was discharged to rehabilitation on [**3-18**].
Ovarian cancer diagnosed in [**2104-11-1**]; status post debulking, status post total abdominal hysterectomy, status post omentectomy, status post sigmoid resection, and end colostomy.
History of malignant pleural effusions; status post pleurodesis times two.
Breast cancer; status post left lumpectomy in [**2093**] and radiation therapy.
A number of aortic valve leaflets could not be determined.
ALLERGIES:  LEVOFLOXACIN (causes a rash) and ENALAPRIL (causes a cough).
Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg intravenously q.12h.
Hydrocortisone 50 mg intravenously q.8h.
Morphine as needed.
The patient had a tracheostomy and unresponsive to deep sternal rub.
The patient was jaundiced with scleral icterus.
She was initially put on a ventilator.
She had a tracheostomy and needed no sedation at that time.
She did require frequent suctioning for thick sputum.
She was also started on Zosyn for her urinary tract infection.
Her small-bowel obstruction was medically managed with a nasogastric tube to intermittent suction.
She was maintained on a proton pump inhibitor for her history of gastrointestinal bleeds.
Initially, she had occult-blood positive nasogastric tube output.
The patient was maintained on hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.
Initially, the patient was seen by the Gastroenterology Service who felt that her gastrointestinal bleed should be managed conservatively with proton pump inhibitors.
The patient required multiple blood transfusions to keep her hematocrit above 21.
On [**3-23**], a family meeting was held, and the decision was made that cardiopulmonary resuscitation was not indicated in this patient.
The following day, the patient had a large amount of coffee-grounds emesis.
Her nasogastric tube was placed to intermittent suction.
The patient was weaned off the ventilator by [**3-25**].
She did well on a tracheostomy mask and eventually was weaned down to an FIO2 of 40%.
Again, she required transfusions to keep her hematocrit above 21.
On the night of [**3-29**], the patient was noted to have a large amount of blood coming out of her tracheostomy tube.
This required aggressive suctioning which could not be managed on the floor.
After much discussion with the Ethics Service, Medicine attending, and Medical Intensive Care Unit attending the decision was made that the patient should be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for management of her airway.
This was reversed with vitamin K.  The patient was transfused several units of platelets as well as units of packed red blood cells to maintain a platelet count of above 50 and a hematocrit level above 21.
The patient's bleeding from her tracheostomy tube slowed down.
On [**4-2**] she required an additional transfusion of platelets to keep her platelet count above 50.
