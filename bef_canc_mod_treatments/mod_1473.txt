He was started on an octreotide and bolus + PPI drip.
He then vomitted 250cc bright red blood and was subsequently intubated for airway protection.
Peribronchial consolidations and ground-glass opacities in the lungs bilaterally greater in the upper lobes could be due to pulmonary edema.
Hematemesis/melena: The patient presented with large volume hematemesis and was initially managed in the ED with ocreotide, PPi drip and transfused 1 unit (HCT 24).
He remained HD stable and was transferred to the MICU where he was intubated for airway protection.
Given equivocal results on H.pylori serologies, he was started on 10-day triple therapy for H.pylori.
On MICU day #1, the patient was tolerating pressure support well and was able to be extubated.
The patient required re-intubation due to poor oxygenation.
He was extubated on [**8-22**] and had a decreasing supplemental oxygen requirment over the next 24 hours.
Antibiotics were discontinued prior to transfer from the MICU.
A pigtail was placed with interval improvement in the PTX.
The chest tube was removed on [**8-22**] with resolution of the pneumothorax.
24 hours after chest tube removal patient developed tachipnea and desats to the 70s he was emergently reintubated for respiratory distress, CXR did not show rexpansion of the PTX.

Also had initially been refusing PO medications for unclear medications.
He was started on levothyroxine.
TSH levels will need to be checked in 6 weeks and levothyroxine dose adjusted accordingly.
Endocrine consult suggested hypothyroidism may be secondary to large iodine dose and that he should be trialed off levothyroxine as an outpt after discharge as this can lead to transient hypothyroidism.
Anti-TPO anti-bodies were negative, decreasing suspicion for hashimoto's thyroiditis.
CDiff was sent and patient emperically treated with IV flagyl and PO vanc in the setting of neutropenia.
C. difficile toxin was negative x 3, and empiric therapy was stopped after the patient completed his course of HCAP therapy.
