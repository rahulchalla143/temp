3.4-cm septated fluid collection corresponding to the palpable abnormality in the left lateral ankle, a finding that is of uncertain significance but could represent hematoma, synovial cyst or infectious collection, among other entities.
Again there is some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with fullness of the pulmonary vessels and a dual-lead pacemaker device in place.
The PermCath catheter can be visualized up to cavoatrial junction.
Brief Hospital Course: 70F h/o DM2, atrial fibrillation, CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF 45-50%), and CRI with volume overload.
Her diuretic regimen was titrated while on the floor with good response initially, but she continued to have worsening renal failure.
She was therefore consented to suspend her DNI status for intubation to place the tunneled catheter.
She was extubated with difficulty after the procedure and suffered desaturations and delirium.
She was given HD in the MICU as is her course on the general medicine floor.
Her diuretic regimen was titrated and while her Cr worsened.
She suffered worsening pulmonary edema in the days before the tunneled catheter was placed and she was nearing HD.
Follow-up sputum Gram stain demonstrated Gram-positive rods and cocci, as well as Gram-negative rods.
Acute desaturation was therefore considered likely triggered by mucus plugging [**2-6**] hospital-acquired PNA (although pt was chronically on prednisone 25mg daily [**2-6**] presumed psittacosis without Bactrim ppx, her desaturation was considered unlikely related to PCP).
Patient therefore received extensive chest PT and BiPAP with good effect, and started vancomycin/cefepime/ciprofloxacin.
# Acute-on-chronic renal failure:  As above for the floor.
In the MICU, patient underwent hemodialysis with removal of approximately 500 cc.
Patient required soft two-point restraints overnight during her first night in the MICU, but returned to near baseline subsequently.
# CAD s/p CABG: Patient was initially continued on her home regimen of aspirin, metoprolol, and simvastatin, with no ACE inhibitors in the setting of her renal dysfunction.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient was not anti-coagulated given her history of hematuria, and was continued on metoprolol and quinidine for rate control.
# DM2: Patient was continued on her home regimen of insulin NPH [**Hospital1 **] with sliding scale.
Her insulin regimen was titrated for blood sugar control, though her glycemic control proved difficult.
# GERD: Patient was continued on her home regimen of omeprazole.
# Hypertension: Patient was continued on her home regimen of metoprolol.
# Hyperlipidemia: Patient was continued on her home regimen of simvastatin.
# Back pain: Patient was continued on home regimen of Vicodin PRN.
