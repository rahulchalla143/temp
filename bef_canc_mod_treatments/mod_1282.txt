HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old female with a history of diabetes and hypertension with a resultant end-stage renal disease who recently has had fatigue and coughing spells making it hard for her to catch her breath, with fevers and chills and dark sputum for one week.
She was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin, enalapril, MSO4, aspirin, and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
She was treated with her Cardizem and Lopressor which was increased to 75 mg b.i.d.
She was also given a dose of Lasix and hydralazine.
Initial electrocardiogram changes with ST elevations in V2 to V3 were attributed to her underlying congestive heart failure by Cardiology.
Her creatine kinase and troponin were negative.
She underwent ultrafiltration later that day with removal of 4.2 kg.
She also had several episodes of chest pain with ST elevations in V2 to V3 on the electrocardiogram, treated with nitroglycerin and Lopressor, and the pain resolved.
She had low-grade temperatures thought secondary to possible aspiration and got one dose of zithromycin on [**3-4**].
Intravenous nitroglycerin was weaned off to her home Isordil.
With increased phosphate, Renal recommended checking PTH and starting Amphojel 30 cc t.i.d.
Cerebrovascular accident in [**2158**] with occasional word-finding difficulties as only deficit.
Cholecystectomy and total abdominal hysterectomy.
Loop graft for hemodialysis in [**2165-5-30**].
Cervical spondylosis, status post multiple discectomies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home include Calcitriol 0.25 mcg p.o.
q.d., isosorbide/Isordil 10 mg p.o.
t.i.d., meclizine 12.5 mg p.o.
p.r.n., metoprolol 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Nephrocaps 1 tablet p.o.
q.d., Zoloft 100 mg p.o.
q.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
q.d., Cardizem 180 mg p.o.
q.d., Celebrex 100 mg p.o.
p.r.n., Renagel 4000 mg t.i.d., hydroxyzine 25 mg p.o.
p.r.n., Lomotil 2.5 mg p.o.
p.r.n., Ativan 1 mg p.o.
q.h.s., Epogen 3500 units at hemodialysis, quinine sulfate 260 mg p.o.
Sensation was slightly decreased in the lower extremities with diabetic neuropathy, dysesthesia when extubated today (on Sunday).
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube in place with heart size at the upper limits of normal, diffuse bilateral opacities more focal in the right perihilar regions, small effusions, right chronic hemidiaphragm elevation.
While she was in the hospital Amphojel was added to control PO4.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  On transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit she had a creatine kinase of 387 with a negative MB and troponin which was attributed to immobility in the unit.
We tried to initiate [**Last Name (un) **], but after repeated hemodialysis she was a little volume depleted with low blood pressures, so this was held.
Diovan 81, her volume status is worked out as a good option.
Aspirin, beta blocker, Lipitor, and Isordil were continued.
The beta blocker was increased to 75 b.i.d.
PULMONARY/INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Oxygen was weaned off.
No antibiotics were used despite low-grade temperatures and a white blood cell count of 12.4.
ENDOCRINE:  Fingersticks and regular insulin sliding-scale were used.
PROPHYLAXIS:  Prophylaxis was with subcutaneous heparin and Zantac.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
Zantac 150 mg p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Tums 1000 mg p.o.
Lopressor 75 mg p.o.
Zoloft 100 mg p.o.
Isordil 10 mg p.o.
meclizine 12.5 t.i.d., and her Celebrex 100 p.r.n., and her Vistaril 25 t.i.d., and her quinine sulfate 260 q.h.s., Renagel 4000 mg p.o.
with meals, Calcitriol 0.25 mcg p.o.
