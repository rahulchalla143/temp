He awoke spontaneously approximately at 19:15 and noticed a sharp epigastric discomfort, [**5-25**], non-radiating, associated with nausea and shortness of breath, that was relieved 30 minutes later after taking 1 sublingual nitroglycerin.
He had another episode of chest discomfort at 03:00 on [**2128-4-11**] that resolved in 45 minutes with 3 sublingual nitroglycerin.
Left knee plain film was also obtained.
Given elevation of troponin and Creatinine Kinase, outpatient cardiology coverage for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16801**] was notified and advised against initiating heparin at this time given marked impairment in renal function making troponin unreliable, and small MB index despite large CK elevation, suggesting against cardiac aetiology of biomarker elevation.
He was given 1 dose of levofloxacin 750mg for possible infiltrate on chest x-ray.
Also given ASA 325 mg PO x1 and Morphine 2 mg IV x1.

They can also be due to small vessel infarction, demyelinating disease, infection including Lyme disease, and occasionally seen in patients with migraine headaches.
Findings most consistent with diffuse osteopenia in this patient status post below-the-knee amputation.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed minimal disease of the LMCA, widely patent prior LAD stents, mild restenosis of OM1, and 100% occluded RCA that fills via LCx collaterals.
Patent prior LAD stent, mild restenosis of OM1 stent.
Head CT showed no acute intracranial pathology, MRI/MRA Head showed no evidence of acute infarct but did show multiple periventricular FLAIR hyperintensities, for which the differential diagnosis is broad (no cause, small vessel infarction, demyelinating disease, infection including Lyme disease, and occasionally seen in patients with migraine headaches).
He again had hypotension in the MICU after aggressive diuresis with SBP down to 60-70 but asymptomatic.
He then developed further volume overload likely from aggressive volume resucitation given his hypotension on admission.
His Lasix was held during this admission because of his hypotension, and he was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about when this should be restarted.
# Emphysema/Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient reported he is on 3L home oxygen at night.
CTA chest was initially deferred given his ARF and recent contrast load with catheterization.
He was continued on fluticasone/salmeterol and tiotropium.
# NSTEMI: The patient has a history of CAD s/p 1v CABG in [**2111**] (SVG -> RCA), known occluded RCA and SVG->RCA graft on Cath in [**1-20**] and RCA fills with collaterals, and s/p PCI to LAD (3.0x23 Cypher) in [**8-20**] and OM1 (2.5x15 Vision-BMS) in [**5-22**].
He had a bump in troponin from 1.85->2.14 after the catherization but his CK remained normal (69-84).
He was continued on ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, and Metoprolol 25 tid.
His Atorvastatin was held in the setting of transaminitis.
He received Mucomyst and NaHCO3 pre-catheterization.
He was given IVF with improvement of Cr to 0.8 at the time of discharge.
CT of the LLE showed diffuse osteopenia status post below-the-knee amputation, no displaced fracture, mild patellofemoral compartment osteoarthritic change, and small joint effusion.
Orthopedics determined that the team should hold off joint aspiration as it would likely reaccumulate.
He was continued on Gabapentin 800 mg q8hr and prescribed a Lidocaine patch to his left BKA.
His Atorvastatin was held during this admission, and he was instructed to have his LFTs rechecked as an outpatient for consideration of restarting the Atorvastatin.
He was continued on Keppra 1500 PO bid.
# Psych: The patient was continued on Clonazepam 1 mg tid.
# Peripheral neuropathy: He was continued on his home dose of Gabapentin 800 mg tid.
