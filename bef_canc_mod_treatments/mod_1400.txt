Atrial fibrillation Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 78765**] on metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] on admission for rate control; it was titrated to 37.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] with HR in the 50 - 60's.
He was changed to metoprolol XL 50 mg QD prior to discharge with stable HR and BP.
The risks vs. benefits were discussed at length with the patient, and he decided to restart warfarin given the stroke risk.
A lower INR goal of 2.0 - 2.5 was chosen given his history of bleeding, and he was discharged on warfarin 2 mg QHS.
