PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature was 97.8 F.; heart rate 93; blood pressure 103/48; respiratory rate 22; 100% O2 saturation on room air.
Two plus dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was brought to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further work-up where he had an urgent endoscopy by the Gastrointestinal Service which showed evidence of old esophagitis.
At the conclusion of the esophagogastroduodenoscopy, the patient vomited a fairly large amount of blood and was immediately placed on his side and able to cough up most of the bloody emesis, however, there was a concern for possible aspiration, although patient's respiratory status remained stable with normal respiratory rate, O2 saturations at 100% on two liters nasal cannula which he had been put on prior to the procedure and a chest x-ray was obtained that was clear.
A proton pump inhibitor was started on Gastrointestinal's recommendation at 40 mg intravenously twice a day and his aspirin was held.
On arrival to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was started on intravenous normal saline at 200 cc an hour after a 500 cc normal saline bolus, and received one additional unit of packed red blood cells.
Blood pressure was increased following a 500 cc normal saline bolus and two additional units of packed red blood cells.
In the morning, his hematocrit following total now of five units of packed red blood cells was 28.1 and he was given one further unit of packed red blood cells in anticipation of an esophagogastroduodenoscopy in the a.m. by the Gastrointestinal Service.
The second esophagogastroduodenoscopy was carried out in the Intensive Care Unit by the Gastrointestinal Service on hospital day number two and showed evidence of an ulcer in the distal esophagus as well as ulceration at the gastroesophageal junction near the prior anastomosis.
four times a day was started and his proton pump inhibitor was changed to Propranolol 40 mg p.o.
Given the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeds and history of partial gastrectomy, iron studies and B12 were added on to his initial laboratory tests and he was noted to have a low B12 as well as iron deficiency, and so he was started on B12 oral replacement and iron sulfate.
Also, because of the patient's history of long term alcohol use with two to three beers per day, he was started empirically on thiamine, folate and a multivitamin.
The patient is instructed to hold his aspirin and avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs until this time.
Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o.
