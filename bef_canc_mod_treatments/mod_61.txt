Blood cultures 10/29 grew 2 species of GNR, vancomycin discontinued.
Urine was believed to be likely source given chronic indwelling foley and past urine Cx's.
On [**11-30**] antibiotics were switched to Meropenem and Ciprofloxacin for double anti-pseudomonal coverage.
Antibiotics were then narrowed to Meropenem only on [**12-1**] after sensitivities returned.
Speciation of ED blood Cx + for E.Coli and K.Pneumo x 2 sets with sensitivities K.Pneumo (pan-sensitive) and E.Coli (sensitive to only genatmicin and meropenem).
indewelling foley with past urine Cx's showing same MDR E.Coli as current blood Cx.
There was initial concern for prostatitis in setting of malpositioned foley catheter; however, rectal exam was unremarkable.
Patient was continued on Meropenem as discussed above.
