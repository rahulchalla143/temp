Surgical staples project over the right groin and vascular calcifications project over the low pelvis and left thigh.
A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
Right femoral neck fracture, better seen on recent hip radiographs.
Moderate hematoma involving the right gluteal muscles in this patient status post right hip replacement.
CT Right Lower Extremity - [**2128-7-28**] - Large predominantly intramuscular hematoma involving the right gluteal muscles and anterior thigh musculature as above.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Mr [**Known lastname 16642**] is a 74 y/o M w h/o CAD (s/p CABG), aortic regurg (s/p mechanical valve replacement), chronic combined systolic/diastolic CHF (LVEF 45%) [**1-24**] ischemic CMP s/p ICD placement for primary prevention, chronic a-fib, who originally presented w fall and was diagnosed with R hip fracture.
His course has been complicated by post-op bleeding in the setting of required anticoagulation for the presence of a mechanical valve.
Given history of mechanical aortic valve, anticoagulation with heparin drip was re-initiated and cardiology consult was obtained for pre operative assessment.
Patient underwent successful hip arthroplasty on [**2128-7-21**], and heparin drip was restarted 6 hours post procedure.
The pt was transferred back to the MICU and received total of 4units pRBCs while in MICU.
Hct has been stable, thus restarted heparin gtt on [**2128-7-31**].
Fall / Syncope: History was very suggestive of syncopal episode, with prior history of orthostatic hypotension and recent medication change (may have predisposed to medication error).
Acute anemia: In setting of fracture and extensive hematoma, as above, patient responed appropiately to blood transfusions.
We continued aspirin 81mg and statin, but held nitrate, [**Last Name (un) **] and spironolactone.
Aspirin, atorvastatin and metoprolol continued.
Pt was started on bumetanide and treated with a dose of 2mg PO BID for aggressive diuresis.
His heart failure regimen metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID, spironolactone 12.5mg PO daily, atorvastatin 80mg PO daily were continued.
# Mechanical Aortic Valve: Heparin drip restarted in the MICU, after pt's Hct stabilized.
Coumadin restarted very cautiously on [**2128-8-2**], however, having trouble increasing INR, so Coumadin increased to 6mg PO daily for now.
Needs to be increased to an INR goal of 2.5-3.5, with heparin bridge to cover in the interim period.
Afib: Patient's rate has been controlled with a low dose beta blocker and he has not had a significant bp drop from this either.
Coumadin was held for bleeding issues and surgery, restarted on [**8-2**].
Recommend avoidance of narcotics/sedative (used tramadol prn for pain and haldol prn for hyperactivity or agitation).
Unlikely PE (pt not tachycardic, on heparin drip, R unilateral LENIs negative), CXR neg for aspiration, blood and urine cx's show NGTD.
He was also started on keflex for ?cellulitis around groin site.
He has had a RIJ line since [**2128-7-21**] and this may be source, so it was d/c after peripheral access was attained.
