Admission Date:  [**2120-7-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-7-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-7-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Optiray 350 / Clindamycin / Aldactone / IV Dye, Iodine Containing / pyridostigmine  Attending:[**Last Name (un) 2888**] Chief Complaint: Fall and increased weight gain   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2120-7-12**] Cardiac catheterization [**2120-7-14**] Pulmonary arterial catheterization [**2120-7-14**] Intra-aortic balloon pump insertion [**2120-7-15**] Dialysis catheter placement [**2120-7-15**] Arterial line placement [**2120-7-17**] Intra-aortic balloon pump re-insertion [**2120-7-17**] Intubation   History of Present Illness: 68 year old man with a history of coronary disease status post cabg in [**2107**] and multiple PCIs since then presenting on the [**7-7**] with weight gain at home and altered mental status resulting in a fall at home.
In the ED he had a possible seizure with dilantin loading.
Patient was given 80mg IV lasix given last night and this morning still volume overloaded and given another 100mg IV lasix and metolazone and lasix gtt.
Team is concerned for poor forward flow given LFTs have increased to >1000, creatinine to 3.3, INR >2, and only 600mL UOP with 20mg/hr lasix gtt yesterday.
At this point, he was transferred to the HF service and admitted to the CCU for inotropes, swan, and lasix drip.
He endorses discomfort around his foley site but denies cough, chest pain, sob, abdominal symptoms, fevers/chills.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - CAD - Chronic systolic & diastolic CHF, EF 40-50% [**5-/2119**] - CABG: s/p CABG in [**2107**] (LIMA-LAD (patent), SVG-PDA (occluded), SVG-OM(occluded)) - PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: multiple stents (s/p DES to LMCA into LCx, RCA, r-PL) - PACING/ICD: - ?Afib 3.
Family History: His mother had CAD and a CABG in her 60's.
STUDIES: [**2120-7-6**] CT Head w/o contrast- No acute intracranial process [**2120-7-6**] C Spine w/o contrast- No acute fractures or malalignment [**2120-7-6**] CXR Portable AP- Midline sternotomy wires are again noted.
[**2120-7-10**] MRI Head w and w/o contrast- 1.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated three vessel disease in the right dominant system The LMCA had a patent stent with mild in stent restenosis, there was a 30-40% distal LMCA stenosis beyond the distal edge of the LMCA stent which was unchanged from prior.
Upon careful pullback of a pigtail catheter from the LV to the aorta no pressure gradient was seen.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid RCA with a 3.5x12mm INTEGRITY stent which was postdilated to 3.5mm.
Successful closure of the 6 French right femoral arteriotomy site with a 6 French ANGIOSEAL VIP device with good resultant hemostasis.
2) Multiple clustered locules of air in the right mid abdomen may represent stool within the colon in an area of prior surgery and are similar to the appearance on the [**2120-7-7**] abdominal CT.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital Course: 68 year old man with a history of coronary disease status post cabg in [**2107**] and multiple PCIs, DM type II, hypertension and depression who presented initially on [**2120-7-7**] with weight gain at home and altered mental status.
CCU Course:  On arrival patient was started on inotropes, pulmonary artery catheter was placed, and intra-aortic balloon pump was initiated for support for his cardiogenic shock.
Given his renal failure, CVVH was initiated (mostly for ultrafiltration).
On [**2120-7-17**], he self-discontinued his balloon pump, leading to rapid decompensation necessitating urgent intubation and transfer to the cath lab for IABP re-placement.
He was able to wean off the balloon pump on [**2120-7-19**], however his hemodynamics then worsened again, necessitating the use of pressors.
Upon frank discussion with his family regarding his grim prognosis, they felt that he would never want to continue with aggressive care if there was little chance of full recovery.
On [**2120-7-21**], they decided to transition his care to comfort measures only.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # [**Date Range 7792**]/Cardiogenic Shock: On [**2120-7-11**] while on medicine service, experienced chest pain with troponin of 0.1, negative MB, but echo with new anterior WMA and EF depressed at 25% (down from 40-45%).
He had 2 BMS placed to his RCA, his LVEDP was elevatd at 30, pulmonary pressures were also elevated so the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service.
Patient was started on dobutamine for inotropic effect (could not do milranone because of [**Last Name (un) **]).
He was also on lasix drip.
Patient had an intra-aortic baloon pump to improve systemic perfusion and coronary artery perfusion.
While in CCU a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to monitor CO. Dobutamine drip was started in setting of low CO.
The patient was also started on CVVH to remove fluid thought to be contributing to decreased CO as renal failure persisted.
Decision was made to remove pump at this time and heparin ggt d/c and pressure held at site.
Decision was made to intubate and transfer to cath lab for replacement of pump.
Ballon pump was weaned off of IABP on [**7-19**].
Renal was consulted who started CCVH to remove fluid to help relieve strain on his heart.
The following day, he developed encephalopathy and lactulose was started.
IDDM: Patient was kep on insulin sliding scale and hi blood surgars well well ontrolled in the CCU.
?s goal of care was focused on comfort only, with cessation of all supportive measures including pressors, CVVH, and the ventilator.
