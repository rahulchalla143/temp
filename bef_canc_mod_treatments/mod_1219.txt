He was scoped emergently after intubation and found to have stage 3 variceal bleeding which was unable to be stopped with banding.
He was started on Protonix and Octreotide drips with Ciprofloxacin prophylaxis.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] esophageal balloon was placed with stabilization of bleeding.
He required 12U pRBCs and 7U FFP on HD1.
A TIPS was successfully placed on [**12-8**], but followed by continued bleeding.
2) Liver disease: Etiology is unclear but has been described as NASH and cryptogenic in nature.
On the general floor, the patient was maintained on Lactulose and Rifaximin for ammonia control.
He was discharged on Rifaximin and Lactulose, which he should continue given his TIPS.
The patient was discharged on Dilantin with instructions to have Dilantin levels checked, with goal of 15-20 (corrected for albumin).
5) DM: The patient's outpatient Metformin was held given the extent of his liver disease.
His blood sugar was monitored and treated with an insulin sliding scale and Glargine QHS.
He was started on Vancomycin, which was later switched to Nafcillin once sensitivies came back showing MSSA.
He was treated for a total of 8 days.
7) F/E/N: The patient was started on tube feeds in the ICU, which were continued on arrival to the general medicine floor.
Thus, it is important that his nutrition be closely followed on discharge and tube feeds should be reconsidered if the patient's appetite or food intake should decline.
