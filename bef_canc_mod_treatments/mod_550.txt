Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 27548**] is a 77 year old male with extensive history including heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease complicated by myocardial infarction (CAD c/b MI), diabetes mellitus, type 2 (DMT2), lung cancer status post VATS, and end stage renal disease (ESRD) status post kidney transplant in [**2104**] (on immunosuppresion), who presented from clinic with pneumonia, new thrombocytopenia and hyperkalemia.
His immunosuppression (rapamune and cellcept) was discontinued when it became clear that his kidneys were not recovering and his thrombocytopenia was worsening.
ITP was also on the differential.
Then, he was given a trial of prednisone for possible TTP/HUS, which worked for only one day and was confounded by platelet transfusions at the same time.
Finally, his immunosuppression was held to let his bone marrow replace the platelets, which showed potential with a reticulocyte count of >7.
He has been on prednisone chronically and may be playing a role in suppression of his fever response in the case of TTP/HUS and sepsis.
On [**11-30**] during a family meeting it was decided that the patient should be made comfort measures only.
We held labs, discontinued any unnecessary medications that did not contribute directly to patient comfort, discontinued dialysis.
His vent was changed to pressure support.
