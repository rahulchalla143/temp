All antiplatelet agents were held and his INR was reversed.
He was started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
On hospital day #2, his blood pressure medications were transitioned to oral meds and his blood pressure remained resonably well controlled although he required several doses of IV metoprolol to maintain SBP<140.
He will resume taking an aspirin (325mg) next week.
At his follow up visit, we will consider the option of re-starting Coumadin (perhaps low dose to maintain INR between 1.5-2.5).
We will also consider whether he may be a candidate for a PFO closure procedure at that time.
