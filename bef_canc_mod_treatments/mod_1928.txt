Cardiology was consulted with recommendation to treat comorbidities and maximize med regimen without likely plan for cath.
Patient is currently well rate controlled with Metoprolol with potential plan for PPM at some point in future.
In the MICU, the patient initially required BiPap for resp distress.
She was subsequently diuresed and started on broad spectrum coverage abx (Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl) given fever on admission and course pulmonary exam.
With above treatment patient's fever curve improved as did her resp status.
Antibiotics were then narrowed to levofloxacin and she will complete a 14 day course to finish on [**2150-2-16**].
Her fluid status will need to be continually addressed while in rehab with reinitiation of her diuretics as needed accordingly.
Changed to levaquin PO for ?
Aggressive pulmonary toilet should be continued in rehab as well.
If clinical status were to deteriorate, broadening antibiotic coverage to include hospital acquired infections is very reasonable given her multiple hospital and rehab admissions.
She is to complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin on [**2150-2-16**].
CAD: Patient with troponin elevation, peak 0.77 and subsequent downward trend.
She was started on plavix for anticipated cath but no plan for that currently so it was discontinued.
She will be continued on ASA and statin for discharge.
Had 2 episodes of A-fib w/ RVR on [**2-5**], which were largely unresponsive to IV lopressor, but broke with diltiazem 10-20 mg IV.
She will be continued on PO metoprolol at 50mg QID.
Her coumadin was originally held for the potential of PPM placement by EP.
However, given her pulmonary status currently, there are holding on PPM placement currently.
Currently, she remains on heparin gtt and will be restarted on coumadin.
Weight based heparin gtt (as included in discharge paperwork) can be discontinued when her INR is again therapeutic, but this will need to be followed in rehab.
Her foley catheter was discontinued and her UA did not reveal evidence of infection.
Should be monitored at rehab given anticoagulation and recent hematuria.
Creatinine normalized on day of d/c to 1.0 after small IV fluid bolus.
Prior to her creatinine bump, she had been kept NPO for the potential PPM placement.
Her diet has since been restarted and she was given a small fluid bolus (given known CHF and recent aggressive diuresis).
Depression:  She was continued on Celexa per her outpatient regimen.
Given concern for aspiration pneumonia, she was evaluated by speech and swallow twice during this stay and was cleared to take PO (ground and thin liquids) diet without evidence of aspiration.
