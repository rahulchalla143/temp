Status post right VATS procedure.

Ca: 8.3 Mg: 1.9 P: 4.2 CBC:  WBC 4.6 Hct 26 Plt 188 PT: 13.0  INR: 1.1   Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a a 63yo M s/p OLT ([**5-11**]) for HepC cirrhosis/HCC on immunosuppression, s/p tracheostomy for subglottic stenosis ([**7-11**]), recurrent pna admitted from [**Hospital3 **] rehab for increasing dyspnea x 1 month, found to have multiple pulmonary nodules but no PE seen on CTA.
Of note, recently d/c from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2160-1-22**] for pneumonia, empirically treated with vanc/ceftaz for unclear duration.
Chest tubes placed to suction postoperatively.
[**Name (NI) 4452**], pt received 1 mg midazolam and intraoperatively 340 mg Propofol, 125 mcg Fentanyl, 12 mg Vecuronium.
Also received 14 mg of morphine (last given at 10:45 pm), Ceftaz, Vancomycin, Hydrocort 100 mg IV, Neostigmine, and glycopyrrolate.
[**Name (NI) **], pt initially placed on 100% trach mask and sent to PACU.
He was briefly placed on CMV for 30 minutes then CPAP PS 10/5.
He was transferred to ICU for further ventilatory management.
The acute respiratory acidosis was thought to be secondary to narcotics/sedatives causing hypoventilation as well as exposure to 100% FIO2 leading to decreased respiratory drive and causing more shunt lung physiology given his chronic obstructive lung disease and Pickwickian syndrome.
He was initially placed on ventilator and then eventually weaned off to trach mask.
He required very frequent pulmonary toileting due to copious amount of sputum production which was thought to be secondary to his pulmonary nodules vs infection.
Liver transplant consultants thought that Sirolimus was likely the culprit for the cause of BOOP and discontinued sirolimus on [**2-21**] and increased Cellcept to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] and continued prenisone 5mg daily.
These organisms could very well have been colonized however after discussion with ID, patient was continued on vanco and ceftaz to finish a 10 day course on [**2160-2-23**].
The chest tube was placed during VATS procedure was managed by thoracis and initially planeed on removing the chest tube on [**2160-2-23**] or [**2160-2-24**].
On the floor he was continued on ceftaz/vanco for 10 days as above.
Chest tubes were discontinued on [**2-26**].
He was also requiring frequent suctioning, nebs.
Plan is for trach collar during the day and BIPAP 8/5 at night.
The creatinine and urine output improved with aggressive IV fluids.
Continue Tacrolimus 2mg [**Hospital1 **].
#  DM II - Glucose control maintained with Sliding scale insulin.
#  Hypertension - Continued on metoprolol and amlodipine.
Speech and swallow were consulted for Passy Muir Valve Evaluation, but pt was thought not to be safe to use it due to his tracheal stenosis.
# Ppx: Maintained on SC heparin + pneumaboots.
