The decision was made by her PCP and ID specialist to treat through the line with vancomycin given recent multiple line changes.
She is currently on Day 13 of Levofloxacin and Vancomycin.
There was a concern for narcotics overdose from her PCA and she was given narcan 0.4mg x3.

Her mental status improved with three doses of narcan and holding her morphine PCA.
Over the next several days of her hospitalization, her various pain medications were gradually restarted and she was given prn morphine doses.
The pain consult service was contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended starting methadone and titrating according to morphine needs.
This decline in mental status was almost certainly related to her methadone and multiple pain medications.
On transfer back to the floor, she was placed again on a morphine PCA at her outpatient basal rate of 2mg per hour and was noted to become somnolent and less responsive once again.
Her basal rate of morphine was discontinued and she returned to baseline.
She was maintained on the morphine PCA with demand doses only.
In addition, her baclofen and tizanidine are being held.
Given continuing fevers on Vancomycin and [**12-2**] blood culture bottles on [**3-8**] that grew staph epi, the Hickman catheter was discontinued.
She was treated with a seven-day course of Ceftazadime.
History of PE and DVT: She was continued on Coumadin with a therapeutic INR throughout her hospitalization.
As her pain medications were restarted and morphine dosing increased, she would become somnolent suggesting a very fine line between pain control and over-narcotizing.
On discharge, her pain is very well controlled with only demand doses of morphine PCA, without a basal rate.
In addition, her baclofen and tizandine are being held.
DM: She was covered with an insulin sliding scale and continued on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] diet.
Her metformin was restarted prior to discharge.
