This morning she noticed that her vision was slightly blurry when she was [**Location (un) 1131**] directions on her cereal and her newspaper.
She also complained of chronic chest pain at that time, and anti-fungal treatment with fluconazole was recommended.
On [**3-20**] she was switched from warfarin to dabigatran for anti-coagulation, although the patient believes that dabigatran was later stopped.
On [**3-31**] her VNA reported volume overload and her Lasix was restarted at 40mg daily.
Started on heparin gtt, nitro gtt, Plavix loaded with 600mg, ASA 325, morphine 5mg IV.
Per report, her catheterization showed that 2 of her 3 CABG grafts are occluded.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated normotension.
Evaluation of mesenteric ischemia is limited due to lack of IV contrast.

# CORONARIES:  History of prior IMI, CABG in [**2106**], subsequent stenting to SVG to PDA and anterograde limb of PDA.
Per prior cath records, the LIMA-LAD graft has been occluded since [**2130**].
Lisinopril was held for two days due to acute kidney injury (see below).
Home Lasix was initially continued, then held for two days due to acute kidney injury (see below).
Ranolazine was started [**4-3**] in an attempt to reduce her chronic chest pain.
# RHYTHM:  Chronic Afib, on anti-coagulation with dabigatran, recently switched from warfarin due to compliance concerns.
Metoprolol continued to rate control, digoxin started [**4-3**].
# Enteritis:  On the evening of [**4-4**] at 2200 the patient was given a dose of kayexelate for K 5.5.
IVF boluses used to support fluid balance and pressure.
Lactate elevated to 5.9, lactic acidosis with venous pH 7.32.
Lisinopril and Lasix were held.
Her home dexedrcalciferol was continued and all medications (including dabigatran and Cipro) renally dosed.
Inactive issues: # Hyperlipidemia: continued statin as above, held fish oil (not available on formulary) # Anemia:  Baseline Hb 10.
Continued iron supplementation, vit B12 # Hypothyroidism: last TSH 2.4 in [**2132-8-28**], continued levothyroxine # T2DM:  on insulin, recently started sitagliptan.
While inpatient we used ISS and held sitagliptan.
The ACS service was consulted on [**2133-4-5**] for acute abdominal pain with distension and copious diarrhea that began hours after patient had received kayexalate for treatment of hyperkalemia on [**2133-4-4**].
Her symptoms persisted and she was reportedly hypotensive and tachycardic briefly but responded to IV fluid boluses on morning of [**2133-4-5**].
A KUB was done that demonstrated markedly distended cecum, without evidence of distal colonic decompression and raised the possibility of intermittent cecal volvulus.
Initial discussion of potential surgical intervention with the patient was met with indecision and the patient wanted to discuss this possibility with her son/family.
At this juncture, it was felt that this was possibly a pseudoobstructive picture of the colon and GI was consulted for colonoscopy for further evaluation of the colonic mucosa along with potential endoscopic decompression.
Chemical decompression was not attempted given the patient's significant history of cardiac dysrrhythmias.
Her lactate had improved to 2.9 after IV fluid boluses.
However, she had some intermittent episodes of hypotension to SBP 90's along with tachycardia and was transferred to the MICU (no available SICU beds) with surgery following closely.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.
This was confirmed with discussions with hematology.
Despite continued fluid resuscitation, she started to become hemodynamically unstable around 10pm on [**2133-4-5**] and vasopressors therapy was started along with arterial line placement.
Her son was [**Name (NI) 653**] earlier in the day to discuss his mother's condition and the possibility of surgical intervention if she did not improve or got worse.
The great likelihood of death associated with surgery was reinforced and her son understood this risk.
She was coagulopathic despite pre-op/intra-op FFP and required multiple units of blood and albumin.
At the conclusion of the case, the patient had cardiovascular collapse despite maximal vasopressor and IV fluid support.
ACLS protocol was initiated and eventually a perfusing cardiac rhythm was recovered.
At this time, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] had already been in contact with the patient's son and she explained to him his mother's critical condition and her son wished to continue resuscitation as needed.
