He completed chemotherapy in [**2154-9-13**] and radiation therapy to the neck in [**2154-5-14**].
He underwent modified radical neck dissection in [**2154-10-14**] which was complicated by a fluid collection that was drained incompletely by placement of an IR drain.
He subsequently underwent incision and drainage of the collection.
At the time of admission, the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was holding suction and had drained approximately 45 cc of serosanguineous fluid over the last 24 hours.
He was maintained on airway observation.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lamivudine and Pepcid.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken back to the operating room on [**2155-1-16**] for incision and drainage of the right neck abscess.
It was packed with Nu-Gauze, and two Penrose drains were left in place.
The patient was treated with 10 mg of Decadron intravenously.
Fiberoptic examination revealed a swollen epiglottis with pooling of secretions at the malicola.
The airway was narrowed but not significantly changed from prior examination.
He was again treated with intravenous steroids.
He was started on a trial of Heliox without effect.
He was again given intravenous steroids, and he consented to a tracheostomy for airway protection.
On [**2155-1-22**], the patient underwent an uncomplicated tracheostomy placement.
He tolerated the new tracheostomy well.
On [**2155-1-23**], the Plastic Surgery Service was consulted for placement of a vac sponge over the neck wound.
On [**2155-1-24**], a trial with a Passy-Muir valve was attempted; however, he could not tolerate the valve, likely due to swelling at the level or above the tracheostomy tube.
On [**2155-1-27**], the patient's tracheostomy was changed to a Shiley #4 cuffless fenestrated tube.
The following day, the patient's left subclavian Port-A-Cath was removed given suspicion that it was contributing to the patient's facial and upper extremity edema.
He was also started on clindamycin for mild cellulitis of the right neck.
Given difficulties with his insurance coverage, the patient's vac was removed and he was discharged to home on [**2155-2-2**] with wet-to-dry dressing changes.
Keflex 500 mg by mouth four times per day (for five days).
Lamivudine 100 mg by mouth once per day.
Pepcid 20-mg tablets one tablet by mouth twice per day.
Clindamycin 600 mg by mouth three times per day (for five days).
