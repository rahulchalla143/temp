On admission here, pt thought not to have acute ischemia; finished course of PO vanco for c diff and IV vanco for MRSA pna.
In [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was rapidly weaned to nasal cannula, CPAP at night (has OSA).
[**7-29**] Recurrence of tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension on [**7-29**] that was thought [**3-15**] aspiration vs flash pulm edema vs mucous plugging, again improved w/o intervention.
Cards consulted who wished to optimize his CHF mngt w/ Ace-i, cont amio/bb and stop digoxin.
Cath tentatively planned for [**8-7**], pt started on heparin today for stroke ppx since INR now.
Intubated and brought to MICU.
He was initially on a levophed gtt for hypotension, but with fluid boluses he was weaned off the gtt.
He was started on Flagyl for a ten day course.
He was also -started on levofloxacin/flagyl for empiric treatment of aspiration pneumonia.
[**Date range (1) 44757**] This period was characterized by recurrent episodes of chest pain, respiratory distress, hypotension, and tachycardia.
Aggressive suctioning with O2 therapy successfully resolved all of these episodes, and it was felt these episodes were secondary to mucus plugging.
Chest PT, nebulizer therapy, and mucolytic therapy were instituted with success.
PTT was supratherapeutic GI consulted, felt endoscopy would not be of benefit unless catheterization performed.
[**8-17**] Thallium viability performed revealed no reversible defects, as no tissue could be recovered by reperfusion, Cardiology decided catheterization would not benefit the patient and signed off.
Per there recommendations, beta blocker and ACEi therapy were titrated up.
[**8-18**] Thoracentesis performed 2L removed transudative negative for gram stain and culture, largely for respiratory comfort.
In summary this is a 73 year old Caucasian gentleman with a prior history of coronary artery disease s/p myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on amiodarone and anticoagulation, ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 25%, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
Resp distress:  Improved s/p thoracentesis and with nebulizer, chest PT and mucinex therapy.
Prior episode of pneumonia during stay successfully treated with levofloxacin.
We have attempted to optimize medical management using beta blocker and ace inhibitor for protection of remainder of myocardium.
PAF:  Appears stable, on amiodarone and now transitioned to Coumadin for anticoagulative therapy last INR: 2.9.
End Stage Renal Disease:   On hemodialysis Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
GI bleed:  No further episodes of GI bleed since [**8-16**]; this was probably secondary to his supratherapeutic INR  C. Dificile:  On discharge, he will be on day 10 of 14  DVT prophylaxis: Coumadin  Anemia: Likely from chronic disease, ESRD, on epogen.
