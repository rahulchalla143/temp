She was treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole which was continued on discharge for a full 2 week course.
Surgery and GI were consulted who felt that no intervention was necessary as acute cholangitis was probably related to recent ERCP and further intervention would only increase infection risks.
#Acute pulmonary embolism: Left lower lobe segmental PE was found on imaging and patient was started on LMWH bridge to Coumadin.
#Hypertension: Given initial hypotension and infection the patient's Lisinopril was held during hospitalization and not restarted upon discharge as she was not hypertensive while hospitalized.
Therefore, it was felt that the benefits of anticoagulation outweighed the risks and that the risk of recurrent/worsening PE was higher than an aneurysmal bleed.
