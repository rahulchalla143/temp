Admission Date: [**2118-10-29**]        Discharge Date: [**2118-12-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-10-29**]        Sex:  M  Service:  Neonatology  HISTORY:  This is a 27-1/7 week infant who is now being transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**], 7 North for further care due to diagnosis of a colonic stricture following medical necrotizing enterocolitis.
The infant was born to a 34 year-old gravida II, para I, now II mother with prenatal screens A positive, antibody negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and group B strep unknown.
She was started on magnesium sulfate and given a complete course of betamethasone.
Magnesium sulfate was discontinued and mother had further bleeding and concern for abruption.
Due to this concern for abruption and mother's decreasing platelet count the infant was delivered by cesarean section on [**2118-10-29**] at 6:57 p.m., 20 minutes post onset of general anesthesia.
Heart rate about 60, received bag mask ventilation with improved heart rate to over 100 .
2+ peripheral pulses including femorals.
Then [**Known lastname **] was taken     off of CPAP and placed on nasal cannula on [**12-5**] and     he has continued in nasal cannula up until this date.
He     had received maximum flow of 1 liter of room air     humidified and now has weaned to today's nasal cannula     setting of 100 cc on room air.
His platelets have remained stable throughout the entire     course and he has not received any platelet transfusions.
Endocrine: [**Known lastname **] had normal sugars in the first 2 weeks     of life and on day of life 18 was noted to have a D-stick     of 36 and he then continued over the next 1 to 2 weeks to     have intermittent low D-sticks and endocrinology consult     had been obtained and recommended sending an insulin     level as well as growth hormone, urine for ketones,     cortisol, and a blood gas if the blood D-stick was <50.
As a result of his previous history of low D-sticks     which were presumed to be a period of hyperinsulinemia, we     have not advanced his TPN glucose beyond 12.5 trying not     to induce hyperinsulinemia as he was weaned off the PN with     refeeding.
His blood     cultures were negative and antibiotics were     discontinued after 48 hours.
ON [**12-5**], he was started on     vancomycin and gentamicin after he had grossly bloody stools     with the significant bandemia of 27 bands.
This was changed     to Zosyn after initial blood cultures were negative and he     continued on Zosyn to complete a total of 16     days, which was 2 days after the KUBs normalized.
On [**12-12**] he had a right stage 1, zone 2, 1     to 2 o'clock hours and left eye was immature with follow     up in 1 week.
Immunizations: He did receive 1 dose of hepatitis B     vaccine on [**11-30**] and will be due to for his first     set of immunizations over the next week.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To [**Hospital3 1810**] level 3 for surgical repair of the colonic stricture.
Medications: Caffeine 3.
Immunizations received: As noted above, hepatitis B     vaccine and infant will require first set of vaccinations     within a week.
As noted above, will require a repeat HUS at term gestational     age.
Discharge Diagnoses: 1) prematurity 2) s/p medical necrotizing enterocolitis 3) apnea of prematurity 4) s/p hypoglycemia 5) s/p PDA treated with indomethacin 6) s/p RDS requiring surfactant 7) anemia of prematurity 8) now with colonic stricture requiring transfer to [**Hospital3 18242**] 7N Surgical Service for repair.
