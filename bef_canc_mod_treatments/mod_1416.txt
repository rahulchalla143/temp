History of Present Illness: 69 year old male with a history of high grade invasive transitional call carcinoma of the bladder s/p laproscopic cystectomy and neobladder formation [**2-24**] and multiple complications including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and bacteremia presenting to the ED for evaluation of fast heart rate.
The last inpatient stay was from [**2127-6-10**] through [**2127-6-18**] during which time he had sepsis from obstructive pyelonephritis and had a right sided nephrostomy tube placed.
On [**2127-6-16**] his left percutaneous nephrostomy (placed for obstructive nephropathy) was internalized to a JJ ureteral stent after balloon dilation of a left utretero-iliac anastamotic stricture.
He tolerated the medication well.
He was given a total of 6 liters of IVF and had no other BP readings <100.
Due to the initial low BP, the ED team did not want to treat his AF/RVR, but he ultimately received 5 mg IV Lopressor at 2300 (arrived at 2:45 pm).
A repeat CT with rectal contrast was then performed which demonstrated possible sigmoid diverticulitis and fluid, gas and stranding in the pelvis.
After a long ED course, he was admitted to the ICU for management of AF/RVR.
Past Medical History: 1. h/o MI - 17 yrs ago, treated at [**Hospital **] Hospital, per patient treated with a "clot busting medication" (possibly tPA), hospitalized x 6 days and discharged.
As noted previously, he did not take medications after discharge and did not follow up with any physicians 2.Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, discovered at time of cancer diagnosis [**10/2126**], difficult to control post-operatively [**2-24**].
Gastritis/duodenitis 8.Left Percutaneous nephrostomy tube for presumed obstructive uropathy.
9.Right percutaneous nephrostomy tube, emergent, for obstructed pyelonephritis.

It became evidence that his recent IR internalization of his nephrostomy tube had been difficult secondary to ureteroileal anastamotic stricture, and that significant manipulation had been necessary to place the stent.
General surgery was consulted for possible diverticulitis, and recommended conservative management with IV antibiotics.
The patient was placed on levofloxacin and metronidazole empiric treatment of his diverticulitis for a seven day course.
Infectious disease commented on the presence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in the patient's urine - it was advised that linezolid not be started because the bacteria was likely present secondary to colonization of the existing foley catheter in an ileal bladder.
The foley catheter was changed, and repeat urine culture two days later was negative.
