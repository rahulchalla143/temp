He was seen by ortho who planned on admission to medicine and surgery in the morning.
He was admitted from [**2162-4-23**] - [**2162-5-7**] for diarrhea likely from Crohn's flare and was started on 40 mg prednisone at that time.
His platelets fell during that admission, which was thought to be due to heparin induced thrombocytopenia from SQH, so he was switched to fondaparinux, which resulted in rectal bleeding, likely complication of Crohn's.
His PF4 Ab came back positive during that admission, so he was continued on fondaparinux for prophylaxis.
He was discharged on continued prednisone and mesalamine.
He was started on IV heparin and bridged to coumadin.
He has been on coumadin 4 mg daily since that time and LENIs in the ED on [**8-26**] were negative for DVTs.

On [**8-28**], the patient underwent uncomplicated right hip surgical fixation with orthopedics.
Post-operative pain was controlled with oxycodone and home oxycontin.

The patient receive intravenous analgesia after the surgery.
Once tolerating clear liquids, the patient was transitioned to oral analgesia.
