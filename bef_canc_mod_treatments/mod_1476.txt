The patient has a long history of tracheal stenosis and tracheal malacia following a long period of intubation while hospitalized at [**Hospital6 2561**] from [**2121-10-1**] to [**Month (only) 958**] to [**2123**] for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair complicated by graft infection requiring revision.
The patient underwent laser photodynamic therapy for stenosis endotracheal cancer in [**2123-9-1**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The patient was admitted from [**10-30**] to [**11-6**] for elective procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as well where he received tracheal and left main bronchus stents complicated by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bronchitis and diarrhea.

He was given a single dose of vancomycin and Levaquin in the Emergency Department.
Heart rate was 140, down to 100, blood pressure 106/45, respiratory rate 28, 96% on a nonrebreather.
The patient was placed on BiPAP in the Emergency Department with improvement in SpO2 to upper 90s.
Tracheal stenosis and tracheal malacia, status post photodynamic therapy in [**2123-9-1**].
Status post tracheal and left main bronchial stent on [**10-30**].
Status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair complicated by graft infection, status post revision at [**Hospital6 **] from [**2121-10-1**] to [**2123-4-1**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature 100.7, heart rate in the 100s, blood pressure 100 to 110/40s, respiratory rate 15 to 28, oxygen saturation 99% on PEEP, 10 on pressure support 5.
Midline surgical incision was well-healed.
Creatine phosphokinase 196, MB 6, troponin I was 0.8.
He was quickly weaned off the dopamine.
He had a left subclavian placed as well as a arterial line.
The patient was continued on Levaquin and vancomycin and started on steroids.
Subclavian and arterial line were removed.
Oxygen was weaned off.
Lasix was slowly restarted.
Norvasc was stopped, and ACE inhibitor was started at a low dose as the patient has had congestive heart failure.
He was started on captopril 6.25 mg t.i.d.
and then changed to Mavik 0.5 mg q.d.
He underwent bronchoscopy to examine the stents.
In addition an tracheal stenosis of 0.5 cm proximal to the stent was found, and it was recommended that likely he would need resection of the stenosis with electric cautery and silicon stent placed at some point.
Mucomyst was added to outpatient regimen to help with secretions.
A peripherally inserted central catheter line was placed without complications, as the patient will need a 14-day course of vancomycin.
He was on subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis as well as Protonix, and blood pressure remained stable.
