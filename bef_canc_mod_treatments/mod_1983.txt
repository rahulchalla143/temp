Admission Date:  [**2138-9-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-9-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-10-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: acute onset chest tightening, dizziness, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: coronary catherterization  History of Present Illness: 81 y old male with hx of dyslipidemia, HTN, CAD s/p NQWMI in '[**32**] s/p bare metal stenting of proximal and mid LAD as well as OM1 presented to ED by ambulance with acute onset chest tightening, dizziness, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath, was found to have STE >5mm in II, III, aVF, V4-V6 along with 3-4mm ST depression in I and aVL.
Code STEMI was called, pt was given ASA 325mg, plavix 600mg (although takes plavix at home), Heparin 5000 units x 1, Integrillin 17mg IVx1 and then transferred to cath lab.
Pt became bardycardic intermittently in the cath lab and required atropine x2.
Of note, pt states he was on ASA 325mg up until about 2 years ago when he was noted to have "blood from below".
Cardiac review of systems when seen on the floor is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: # CAD s/p NQWMI in '[**32**] s/p bare metal stenting of proximal and mid LAD as well as OM1 # HTN # Dyslipidemia # Hx of ulcers on feet bilaterally # R eye blind after traumatic injury at age 11  Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of tobacco use.
Pt became bardycardic intermittently in the cath lab and required atropine x2.
On the second day the pace was briefly needed but then heart rate remained in to 60-s and 70s, therefore the pacer was removed after 48hrs, lopressor was again started after 72 hrs without a drop in the heart rate (bradycardia improved as expected since RCA reperfused) Enzymes were negative in the emergency room, but second set came back VERY elevated at CK 2713, Trop T 11.23, CK-MB 363 and MB index of 13.4.
Medically, plavix 75 mg was continued, atorvastatin 80mg was started (for pleotropic effects, i.e.
anti-inflammatory ect, and for mortality benefits), ASA 325 mg was restarted in hosp on admission.
The reason for pt not taking it the past 2 years prior to presentation was cleared up with PCP who stated this was b/c pt had nose bleeds during his performances, and therefore elected not to take ASA anymore.
PCP agrees pt needs to be on lifelong ASA and plavix and will follow up closely in the case of another bleed.
