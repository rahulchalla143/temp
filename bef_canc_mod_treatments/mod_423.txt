History of Present Illness: 67yoM with hx of HCC s/p liver [**Month/Day/Year **] in [**2174**] now relisted, s/p ichemic cholangiopathy with bilateral biliary stent placements, and recent [**Hospital1 18**] admission for similiar symptoms, re-presents today with persistent chest pain.
During the admission the patient had his left percutaneous biliary catheter exchanged, treated for suspected cholangitis with Cipro/Flagyl however his chest pain persisted.
His Total Bili, which was elevated to 7 from a baseline of 1.5 to 3, improved following the drain exchange.
The patient was given PO tylenol that decreased the severity of the pain, however the pain was still persistenting on his discharge.
Today the patient presents with continued chest pain.

Focal hyperemia in the left hepatic lobe as described above; this could represent early inflammatory hyperemia or focal pericholangitis or reactive changes secondary to trauma from recent percutaneous catheter exchange.

Tamponade/pericarditis: The patient presented with tamponade physiology and was sent to the cardiac cath laboratory [**2178-9-1**] for drain placement, with 700 cc serosanguinous drainage.
The drain was removed [**2178-9-2**] and repeat TTE showed only a trivial effusion.
This was unlikely to represent TB with [**Doctor First Name **] minimally elevated and PPD negative.
The patient was initially treated with NSAIDs, which were discontinued due to chronic renal failure, and he was subsequently treated with a prednisone burst with good effect.
He was treated with prednisone 20 mg daily x 2 days and 10 mg x 2 days during admission, and discharged with 10 mg x 4 days until further evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] at his follow-up appointment.
Hyperechoic liver lesion: There was a hyperechoic liver lesion noted on ultrasound as above.
It is unlikely that this represented cardiac ischemia and cardiac enzymes were negative at the time, however, he has numerous risk factors and should be considered for outpatient cardiac stress test for further evaluation.
His CHADS2 score is 2, and he should be considered for anticoagulation as an outpatient.
Anticoagulation was not addressed during admission due to pericarditis and risk of hemorrhagic effusion.
Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.6, with creatinine 2.1 on admission.
Hydrochlorothiazide and valsartan were held.
Bilateral pleural effusions: He was noted to have small bilateral pleural effusions on chest x-ray.
Further evaluation and management was deferred to the outpatient setting.
Diuretic use was likely contributing, and his hydrochlorothiazide was held during admission.
The patient was continued on tacrolimus and mycophenolate, with adjustment of the tacrolimus level during admission.
He was continued on rifampin and bactrim prophylaxis.
He was continued on ursodiol for cholangiopathy.
His valsartan and triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide were held for acute renal failure as above.
His valsartan was restarted on discharge, but triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide was not.
He was continued on felodipine and metoprolol.
