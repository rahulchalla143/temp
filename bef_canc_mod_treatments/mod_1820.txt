A KUB again demonstrated dilated loops of bowel with multiple air fluid levels very suggestive of sigmoid volvulus.
Surgery was consulted and after discussion with the pt the decision is that the pt would not want to live with a colostomy which would be the outcome of the surgery but this was not definitive.
She was given vanc and zosyn for possible evolving sepsis and was admitted to the MICU.
GI was consulted who recommended emergent sigmoidoscopy for decompression.
The sister and HCP agreed with this plan and sigmoidoscopy was performed.
Of note the patient was recently admitted [**Date range (3) 100915**] for multifocal PNA treated with vancomycin, zosyn for 10 day course.
Past Medical History: Depression Bilateral breast CA Thyroid CA (had short term trach after this, was removed at age 29) Movement disorder (blepharospasm) psychosis bilateral blindness (retinal detachments from trauma) HTN atrial fibrillation hypercholesterolemia hypoparathyroidism s/p tracheostomy (complication of intubation from lumpectomy about 4 years ago)  Social History: lives at [**Hospital3 2558**], sister and brother-in-law live nearby but spend the summers in [**Country 6607**].
The patient has tracheostomy in appropriate position.
IMPRESSION: Dilated large bowel in a configuration that may represent a sigmoid volvulus, see subsequent CT. .
Left-sided subclavian line ends at mid SVC.
A tracheostomy tube is present in situ.
The findings regarding the pneumoperitoneum and subclavian line was already communicated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1603**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1743**] by phone at 10:54 p.m. on [**2177-4-29**].
Brief Hospital Course: 72F AFib, COPD, h/o SBO, HTN, breast and thyroid CA, s/p tracheostomy several years ago after breast cancer surgery and hysterectomy presenting from [**Hospital3 **] with respiratory distress found to have sigmoid volvulus.
The surgical team recommended surgery for decompression and likely colectomy.
There was a discussion with the patient and her sister who is her HCP with the decision that she would not want to live with a colostomy which would be the likely result of a surgery and that she would prefer less invasive option.
They expressed understanding that her condition was very serious and that not undergoing surgery would expose her to the risk of death.
The GI team was then consulted who performed a successul reduction by sigmoidoscopy.
A central line was placed and vasopressor medications were started.
Despite aggressive IV fluids and multiple vasopressor medications she was unable to maintain an adequate blood pressure and she passed away.
