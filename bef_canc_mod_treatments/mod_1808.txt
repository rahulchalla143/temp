Pancreatitis - Following admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient required modest volume resuscitation as she was briefly hemoconcentrated.
On hospital day #3 her amylase and lipase dropped precipitously consistent with her previous presentation of transient pancreatitis.
Since stones had not been identified in her gallbladder it was suspected that her pancreatitis was due to medications or other nonstone causes.
In reviewing her medication list, it was decided to ultimately withhold her Atorvastatin as her cholesterol panel was well within the normal range and this is a medication known to cause pancreatitis, however, Ursodeoxycholic, a medication not listed above, in her outpatient medication that she was discharged with on her last presentation and this medication may have to be withheld in the future as may Furosemide.
She received Proton pump inhibitor and it was decided to withhold Clopidogrel indefinitely owing to her gastrointestinal bleeding.
Coronary artery disease - Following admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit serial evaluation of her cardiac markers supported evidence of myocardial infarction, medical management was pursued exclusively.
Clopidogrel was held indefinitely.
Metoprolol was added to her regimen and Lisinopril was ultimately restarted.
Atorvastatin was discontinued as described above.
Diabetes - A modest sliding scale of subcutaneous insulin was administered.
The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was significant for one episode of flash pulmonary edema for which she received Furosemide, Nitroglycerin and nonmechanical ventilation as she and her daughter had stated previously that she does not wish to have mechanical ventilation during this hospitalization.
