Given the current presentation, the patient was noted to be in cardiogenic shock and was started on an intra-aortic balloon pump.
A dopamine infusion was also begun.
This clot was removed, and a stent was placed in the proximal and distal lesions of the right coronary artery with resultant TIMI-III flow.
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit on an intra-aortic balloon pump and dopamine.
On [**7-29**], status post catheterization, resolution of the ST changes in leads II and III were evident.
Status post bladder surgery.
Atenolol 25 mg by mouth once per day.
Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
Zocor 20 mg by mouth once per day.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was in place.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  On admission to the Coronary Care Unit, the patient was noted to be on an intra-aortic balloon pump and came to the Coronary Care Unit on a dopamine drip.
The patient was acutely transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and received intravenous fluids.
Therefore, she was switched to a Levophed drip of 0.027 mcg/min.
Over the next 24 hours, the patient was weaned from the intra-aortic balloon pump by initiation if captopril.
Captopril was titrated up from 6.25 mg three times per day to the current dose of 25 mg by mouth three times per day.
The patient tolerated the captopril without significant decreases in creatinine.
However, a pressure dressing was placed to control the bleeding, and upon removal of the pressure dressing the patient was not noted to have a femoral bruit.
Overall, the patient was a 71-year-old female with coronary artery disease, hypertension, stroke in [**2107**], diabetes, and chronic atrial flutter now with inferior myocardial infarction, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of her proximal right coronary artery.
The intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned and removed.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Ischemia:  Inferior myocardial infarction, status post stent to the proximal right coronary artery.
The patient was started on a beta blocker for adequate control of her blood pressure.
Captopril was titrated and switched to lisinopril.
Anticoagulation was started per request of outpatient treating physician.
The patient was noted to have decreased platelets upon placement of the intra-aortic balloon pump; however, she had appropriate correction of her platelets after removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump.
ACE inhibitor was titrated as required.
Status post percutaneous coronary intervention.
Medication compliance.
Insulin adjustment.
Plavix 75 mg p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
Simvastatin 20 mg p.o.
