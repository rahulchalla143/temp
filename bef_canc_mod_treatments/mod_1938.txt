Right heart catheterization is recommended if definitive knowledge of pulmonary artery pressure is required.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure [**3-3**] to his OSA and obesity ventilation syndrome in the context of not wearing his CPAP at night.
The patient was extubated and did well on BIPAP overnight.
While on the medicine floor, the patient was instructed to continue using BIPAP at night.
He was maintained on 3-4L NC during the day, and maintaining O2 saturations >85%.
He was continued on his aspirin and metoprolol (hold parameters were defined).
# Hypotension: While in the MICU, the patient was initially hypotensive, which was attributed to hypovolemia in the setting of sedative medications (midazolam and fentanyl).
There was a low suscpicion for sepsis, adrenal insufficieny, and cardiac event, as the patient was fluid responsive.
The patient also has a history of being non-compliant with his CPAP at night, which likely accounts for his repeat admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
The option of tracheostomy has been discussed with the patient in the past, as well as during this most recent admission; the patient continues to decline this option.

We were able to remove the breathing tube and you were then breathing comfortably on the same amount of oxygen you use at home.
We think that the reason this keeps happening is because you do not use your CPAP at home.
It is VERY important that you use your CPAP at home.
If you do not use your CPAP at home, you will continue to not breath properly and keep returning to the hospital.
