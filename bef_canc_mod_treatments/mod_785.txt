She's been medically managed on prednisone and had a trial of cytoxan which she did not tolerate due to nausea and vomitting.
Her hypertension has been controlled with enalopril, atenolol, and nifedipine until about 7 days prior to admission when she ran out of medication and for that reason has been non-adherent.
Morphine, labetelol 20 IV, atenolol 50 PO, and enalapril 20 PO were administered.
She was then started on a nifedipine drip.
Later, the nifedipine was weaned for a concern of renal insufficiency and a NTG drip was started at which point her systolic blood pressure decreased to 180.

She was started back on metoprolol and nifedipine, but her ACE I was held for the renal failure.
The metoprolol was changed to toprol xl and a clonidine patch were added for better control and a simplified regimen as there was concern for patient compliance.
Titration of these medications on the medical floor and addition of hydralazine did not result in adequate BP control as the patient had several systolic blood pressure readings in the 250s.
Once there, she received IV antihypertensives and HD was initiated.
Several lbs were taken off, facilitating BP control with oral medications.
She was transferred back to the medical floor and stabilized on a regimen of clonidine patch Qweek, TID labetolol, and QD lisinopril.
She was started on a prednisone burst with calcium supplementation.
She was also started on plaquanil for 1-2 months for her discoid rash.
Her ACE inhibitor was initially held, and her creatinine continued to worsen.
Her blood pressure remained difficult to control, requiring another trip to the MICU for administration of IV antihypertensives.
It was decided that some of this was attributed to volume overload, so HD was initiated.
A tunnel line was placed and the patient tolerated the procedure and the HD well.
She was also started on mycophenolate mofetil in the hopes of slowing her progression to ESRD and giving her a few months before having to start HD as more permanent renal replacement.
She was also started on folate and iron for her anemia.
This was comprised of approximately 5 cc of clots of blood concurrently with a hematocrit drop.
She was started on a PPI and asked to avoid NSAIDs.
