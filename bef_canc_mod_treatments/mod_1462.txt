As noted previously the patient had wheezing and dyspnea on admission with oxygen saturation 84% on room air, which improved with nebulizers and Lasix treatment.
The patient was started on IV Solu-Medrol for treatment of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare with nebulizers with marked improvement over the course of her hospital stay.
The patient was eventually transitioned to a oral Prednisone taper and by the day of discharge was nearly completing that course.
Therefore the patient was fed with tube feeds via an NG tube.
Following resolution of the patient's primary infection the patient's mental status improved and the patient was reevaluated by swallowing study who felt that although she was a high risk of aspirating liquids she could tolerate soft solids and pureed foods.
It was ultimately decided to place an NG tube in the patient then and refeed with tube feeds to prevent the aspiration risk.
However, the patient's son for now feels that an NG tube is adequate at this point with hopes that the patient will be able to eat on her own once her condition improves.
The issue of a PEG tube will be addressed at a later date by staff at the [**Hospital6 46219**].
At that time Zantac and heparin were discontinued and the patient's platelet count returned to [**Location 213**] levels at 212 by the date of discharge.
As the patient defervesced on Ceftriaxone the patient's mental status continued to wax and wane, but was remarkably better.
While the patient had NG tube placed in her stomach it was noted that aspirates of gastric secretions were positive for coffee ground substances.
