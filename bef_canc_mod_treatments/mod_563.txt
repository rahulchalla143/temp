Details of this procedure are dictated in a separate operative note.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the post anesthesia care unit.
He was subsequently transferred to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit where he was monitored with a central venous pressure line.
The patient was then placed on a nonrebreather and a repeat gas revealed a pO2 of 139.
He was scheduled for a split thickness skin graft to his right foot ulcer, however this was canceled to avoid placing patient under anesthesia again.
An Apligraf synthetic skin substitute was placed on postoperative day #4 at the bedside with no pain medication given.
The patient tolerated this procedure quite well and Adaptic and dry sterile dressing were placed over the wound and will remain there for one week.
He was started on Bactrim on [**2167-4-6**] 1 double strength tablet twice daily to continue for five days and to end on [**2167-4-11**].
For this, he has been placed on vancomycin throughout his hospitalization 1 gm intravenous q 12 hours with peak and trough levels done periodically.
For his dressings, a dry sterile dressing and Ace wrap are to be placed from his toe up to his thigh.
His dressing over his right foot wound is not to be removed.
He will, however, need to have an Ace wrap placed up to his thigh daily.
Staples are placed from the knee down and are also clean, dry and intact without dehiscence, drainage or erythema.
