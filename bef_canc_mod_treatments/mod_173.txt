Brief Hospital Course: Patient was aggressively diuresed in house using lasix and natrecor so that he would be able to tolerate cath.
Integrilin and heparin were stopped when patient began having melena.
NG lavage was not performed secondary to fragile respiratory status.
Patient was placed in PPI and HCT was kept above 30.
Heparin was restarted once INR fell to below 2.5; Hct was stable.
Patient was then taken to cath lab a day later for stent placement of SVG-PDA.
While waiting for biopsy results, patient was anticoagulated (AVR) on heparin and bridged to coumadin.
He was not discharged home on Lasix as the patient had some low bp while in house, but he should follow up with cardiologist within one week in order to reevaluate use of lasix.
