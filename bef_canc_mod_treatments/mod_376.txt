On the day prior to admit, she saw her psychiatrist who recommended admission given changing psychiatric picture and continued low grade fevers.
The family favored waiting to see if stopping ativan and initiating zyprexa would help.
She was given CTX and vancomycin.
On return from the radiology suite, she had a desaturation event to 89% on RA but recovered with supplemental oxygen.
Of note, pt was just discharged on [**2202-7-28**] after a week long hospital course that was notable for sepsis, requiring a central line, fluid resuscitation and IV pressors in the ICU and complicated by C.Dif colitis.
Past Medical History: # Post-tx lymphoproliferative disorder, NHL of transplant kidney and GI tract # ESRD [**2-19**] lithium toxicity - s/p failed renal transplant [**2-19**] PTLD, tx kidney removed in [**2196**] - now on HD through R sided tunnelled line # Myelofibrosis # Thrombocytopenia - s/p IVIG and rituxan for ?
ITP - heme consult felt multifactorial, mostly consumptive due to meds/bleeding # Anxiety # Bipolar disorder # s/p exlap, LOA, drainage of intraabdominal fluid collections, subtotal gastrectomy and repair of incisional hernia w/ mesh [**2202-5-21**] # h/o hypothyroidism   Social History: Married and lives with her husband, [**Name (NI) **], who is a [**Hospital1 18**] employee.
Began to comply with strength testing, but then stopped, raising question of whether or not her lack of response to questions/commands may be volitional.
Review of recent micro: [**2202-7-21**] stool + Cdiff [**2202-4-30**] blood + enterococcus, [**Last Name (un) 36**] to linezolid and daptomycin .
Dual-lumen dialysis catheter is stable in course and position.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS  W/O CONTRAST; Study Date of [**2202-8-5**] 9:50 PM As best can be determined due to limitations in technique, no significant interval change with the exception of likely improved wall edema suggesting healing colitis.
Moderate to large pericardial effusion with thickened and questionably hyperenhancing pericardium as detailed above.
Successful pericardiocentesis with aspiration of 480 cc of bloody fluid.
There were not focal findings on neurological examination.
CT head showed advanced global parenchymal atrophy related to patient's stated age, findings were consistent with remote head MRI dated [**11-13**], [**2196**].
They suggested returning her psychiatric medications to baseline and obtaining an EEG.
Ativan was titrated to 1 mg po TID with great improvement in speaking, however she continued to be confused and agitated.
She remained withdrawn and slow to respond to questions, and would easily fixate on certain concepts.
A behavoiral plan was put in place and all members of the care team attempted to follow it.
At time of discharge her medication regimen included ativan, risperidone, and lamotrigine.
She was given IV metoprolol and her heart rate improved greatly.
She was transferred to the MICU for hypotension and started on amiodarone and spontaenously converted to sinus tachycardia.
Amiodarone  was continued for three days then discontinued.
She was given 325 mg of aspirin but no anticoagulated given her low risk of embolic event.
Aspirin was discontinued after she had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation for one month, and the reason for her atrial fibrillation appeared clear, due to the effusion, which had resolved upon repeat echo on [**2202-9-24**].
TTE [**2202-8-30**] showed echo evidence of tamponade; a large, circumferential effusionwith stranding was appreciated.
She was started on Vancomycin and Flagyl with the addition of cefepime when fevers did not resolve.
All antibiotics were discontinued after a 14 day course.
Blood cultures were persistently negative prompting discontinuation of repeat cultures.
Cultures off of her dialysis catheter were negative, and her PICC line was pulled.
Treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl.
All antibiotics were discontinued after a 14 day course without return of pulmonary infiltrates on repeat CXR.
# C. Difficle:  Patient had been on treatment for Cdiff with flagyl since previous hospital admission.
Her stool was serially monitored for C.dif given intermittent diarrhea and she did have a positive c. difficile culture on [**2202-9-8**] and was again started on flagyl.
Given her difficulty with repeated infections, and recent antibiotic use, she will continue on flagyl until [**2202-10-26**].
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine at 125mcg PO QD (new dose per endocrinologist).
TSH was mildly elevated at admit at 5.3, but given recent change in medication, she was continued on her outpatient dose and TSH was monitored.
She was continued on this schedule during admission.
On discharge, pt is to continue on HD MWF and nephrocaps 1 CAP PO DAILY.
On [**2202-10-8**] transplant surgery placed an AV fistula in the right upper extremity.
After the procedure the pt some overlying erythema which resolved with elevation.
Known history of ITP, as well as on several psychoactive medications and a PPI with possible contribution of platelet suppression.
All medications were continued given that the potential harm of discontinuation did not outweigh the benefit of increased platelets given she was never low enough to require transfusion or be at risk for spontaneous bleeding.
She was supplemented with nutritional shakes.
# Mobility and conditioning: Physical therapy worked with patient to increase her mobility and maintain and increase her endurance.
She ambulated with assitance and Podus boots were placed while she was in bed to avoid contractures.
