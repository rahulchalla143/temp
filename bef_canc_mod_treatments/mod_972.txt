We did several tests while you were in the hospital, including an ultrasound and a cat scan which showed a clot in your right portal vein (the vein going to your liver).
You were started on some blood thinning medications for your clot, however your levels became very elevated requiring you to stay in the hospital a few additional days while this value (INR) corrected.
Initially you were given fresh frozen plasma and ultimately a small dose of vitamin K which helped improve this value.
You will be contact[**Name (NI) **] by the transplant center with instructions on dose adjustments of warfarin and continued monitoring.
The following changes have been made to your medication regimen:   Please START the following medications: - coumadin  No other medication changes have been made.
