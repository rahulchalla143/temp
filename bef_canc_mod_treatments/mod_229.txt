She received one dose of gentamicin at that time.
She had a PICC line catheter tip culture on [**7-12**] which grew coag negative staph sensitive to vancomycin.
She had another catheter tip sent for culture on [**7-18**] (unclear what line) which did not grow anything.
Coumadin and heparin were discontinued (started for DVT prophylaxis after tib/fib surgery) and she was anticoagulated with Lovenox.
The septic knee reportedly has improved significantly with surgery and antibiotics.
She received dilaudid IV for pain, in addition to vancomycin IV x 1 (preceded by Benadryl) and clindamycin IV x 1.
She was given 2 L NS for rehydration.

- GERD - S/p cadaveric renal transplant on [**8-/2175**] complicated by rejection and capsule rupture 11/[**2174**].
- Right pelvic abscess s/p TAH/RSO - B/L renal solid masses s/p resection pathology was negative for carcinoma - R tib/fib fx with ORIF [**2177-6-24**]  Social History: No smoking, occasional alcohol, no drug use.
Distal calf intermuscular hypoattenuation which should be followed on further series but is likely to represent muscle edema.
Interval removal of left-sided PICC line.
[**8-14**] IR embolization: IMPRESSION: Angiographically successful embolization of left obturator artery pseudoaneurysm with microcoils and thrombin.
Swab wound cultures: no growth (final)  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 14323**] is a 29yo female s/p failed renal transplant (rejection [**2174**]) and s/p bilateral nephrectomy, now s/p right tibial IMN on [**2177-6-24**] who was transferred from [**Hospital **] rehab with bacteremia, worsening RLE, and concern for hardware infection.
#) Bacteremia: The patient was transferred from rehab with positive BCx growing coag negative staph sensitive to vancomycin on [**7-12**], and grew VRE sensitive to Linezolid in BCx on [**7-24**].
Surgery and orthopedics were not concerned for wound infection or hardware infection as a possible septic source.
Surgery was not concerned for the L obturator hematoma (see below) as potential source for sepsis.
The ID service was consulted, and the patient was treated with Linezolid for VRE bacteremia and vancomycin for coag.
Vancomycin will be dosed at dialysis.
She had received Dilaudid >10mg IV over the course of the day and had a rapid yet brief improvement in her mental status and BP in response to Narcan.
BP was unresponsive to IVF boluses and she was transferred to the MICU for closer management, where she briefly required pressors in addition to multiple fluid boluses.
She was started on Linezolid, Aztreonam, and Flagyl for presumed sepsis, with sources likely either hardware or abdomen.
She was started on stress dose steroids, which was quickly tapered.
She was started on clindamycin and vancomycin, and plastic surgery and orthopedics were consulted for wound care.
She was continued on dry sterile dressing changes during her hospital course.
The patient will see orthopedics as an outpatient to follow-up re: IMR placement and plastic surgery to follow-up progression of wound healing.
General surgery did not suspect any acute process that could account for her symptoms.
The patient was able to tolerate po well subsequently and had much improved pain managed by a fentanyl patch (uptitrated to 200mcg) and oral dilaudid by discharge.
#) S/p nephrectomy: The patient was continued on a Tues, Thurs, Sat schedule for dialysis without any complication.
She was discharged to home with PT follow-up and VNA for dressing changes.
