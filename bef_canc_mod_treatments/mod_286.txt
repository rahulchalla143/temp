Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 73 yo Ukranian female with MMP who presents with hypotension, despite fluid resuscitation, and with diarrhea.
She initially required pressors (epinephrine).
During this time, she was also changed from flagyl to PO vancomycin (for positive c. diff colitis), given her initial lack of progress.
Her blood pressures again required pressor support (despite IVF), her WBC began to increase (with 14% bands) and her blood gas showed a worsening acidemia.
Treatment with vanc and flagyl for c. diff and gent/cefepine for UTI were begun.
Despite this, she required more pressor support and her respirations became less strong.
