Discharge Labs:   Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo female with extensive past medical history including severe AS, AFIB, ESRD s/p cadaveric renal transplant, s/p OLTx [**2153-7-21**], presenting from OSH with worsening anemia and [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.
She was successfully resuscitated after 2 rounds of CPR and epinephrine and transferred to the MICU.
She required dopamine for blood pressure support.
#  [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD:  Creatinine 3.4 on adm from baseline of approx 1.3-1.5.
DDx includes prerenal azotemia from some combination of dehydation from poor PO, poor forward flow from systolic heart failure (possibly with some contribution from clinically severe AS), and lasix use.
Also considered possibility of AIN vs ATN vs late rejection though these seem less likely.
No new medications per patient or medical history to suggest cause of AIN and urine eos negative.
S/p gentle IVF daily.
Lasix held.
Pt started on temp HD [**10-26**] via L AVF x3d.
Pt discharged from last adm [**8-/2156**] on fosfomycin weekly ppx for recurrent UTIs, but not clear if taking this.
Was put on fosfomycin at OSH for planned 14 day course per OSH report started on [**2156-10-11**].
Was previously on fluoroquinolone but discontinued after senstivities returned.
OSH sensitivities only to carbapenems and cefotetan.
Pt started on tigecycline [**10-13**].
Pt completed 10d course of tigecycline for complicated UTI.
UCx from [**10-25**] and [**10-26**] returned with >100K Klebsiella, so pt restarted on tigecycline [**10-27**] with plan for 3wk course of complicated UTI.
# Leukocytosis: Chronic leukoctyosis dating back to [**2153**] with baseline WBC count [**12-24**] rarely into 9-11 range.
Etiology of persistent leukocytosis unclear but could be related to chronic prednisone use vs chronic infection, including possibility of recurrent UTIs with low-grade pyelo.
Psych [**Month/Year (2) 6349**] the pt and agreed may be component of catatonia but treatment would be benzos; held off on benzos in the setting of lethargy.
MS slowly improved with HD suggesting AMS most likely [**3-11**] uremia; pt became more alert and returned to baseline MS. Neuro recommended continuing keppra as no good alternative.
Keppra dose was decreased [**10-26**] to 500 daily and 250 supplement after HD sessions.
Pt weaned from supplemental O2.
# Drop in plts in the setting of abnormal RBC smear: Plt count has decreased from 500-600s to low 200s where stable.
Cards recommends slow bolusing with close monitoring of volume status.
>> Chronic issues: # S/p Renal/Liver Transplant: on tacrolimus and prednisone.
Continued vitamin D/Calcium Carbonate for prevention osteopenia.
Held on PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] for now (prev on Bactrim ppx).
Low iron in setting of normal ferritin and transferrin may suggest some component of iron deficiency anemia though seems less likely in setting of normal MCV and MCHC.
Started trial iron supplementation in setting of low iron sat.
PO iron changed to QOD IV iron in setting of nausea, which was subsequently discontinued in the setting trying to reduce medications that could contribution to AMS.
Continued venlafaxine at 150 mg XR given [**Last Name (un) **].
Continued Haloperidol qam/qhs.
