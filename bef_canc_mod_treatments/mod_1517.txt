Had been working prior to brain tumor.
MRI from [**2182-7-5**]: Status post right temporal lobe brain tumor resection, with cystic CSF space at the surgical site.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course: In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], empiric antibiotics were continued.
Pt's hyponatermia was thought to be secondary to a combination of dehyration and polydipsia.
The  patient was given normal saline and placed on fluid restriction with subsequent correction of her sodium.
Pt's mental status was most likely secondary to hyponatremia; and it gradually improved with correction of serum sodium.
Pt was initially given a dilantin load; followed by reinitiation of keppra, overlapping with dilantin.
Glyburide and lisinopril were held and the patient was placed on an insulin sliding scale.
She was transferred to the general medicine service for further care and treatment.
On the floor, Infectious Diseases was consulted and made the recommendation to stop the patient's empiric antibiotics as her CSF profile was not suggestive of bacterial meningitis.
Pt was restarted on lisinopril and glyburide.
The patient's dilantin level was below 10 so she was given an additional dose of dilantin 500mg po.
Pt was discharge home after return to baseline mental status, normalized sodium, on her home regimen of keppra, dilantin, and decadron with instructions to f/u with her PCP.
