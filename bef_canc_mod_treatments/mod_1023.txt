Although these findings could be due to prior granulomatous disease, further evaluation is necessary.
Recommend comparison with prior studies.
A right-sided dual lead pacemaker, midline sternotomy wires, staples overlying the heart, a tracheostomy tube, a right internal jugular catheter, are all in place.
These findings are of uncertain significance.

Her permenant pacemaker was interoggated by the electrophysiology service and reprogrammed.
A heparin induced thrombocytopenia was sent for thrombocytopenia which was negative.
Given her decreased level of consciouseness, the stroke service felt that she liklely experienced a cerebrovascular accident and coumadin should be started when it was safe.
It was decided that she was indeed a candidate for a tracheostomy however given her history of radiation, an open procedure may be best.
On [**2117-8-25**], the thoracic surgery service performed a tracheostomy without complication.
The ventilator was slowly weaned to CPAP.
As she had not tolerated a passe muir valve, a bedside swallowing evaluation was defferred and a PEG feeding tube was recommended.
A PEG was placed on [**2117-8-31**] for long term nutrition needs.
As she was subtherapeutic on coumadin, heparin was started as a bridge.
She began to tolerate her tube feeds and continued to improve over the next several days, using her trach collar.
Trach site C/D/I, RRR, no murmur, lungs CTA bilat,sternal incision C/D/I, abdomen has minimal distention, nontender, no c/c/e of extremities, foley cath in place.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] continued to make steady progress and was discharged to [**Hospital **] rehabilitation on [**2117-9-8**].
