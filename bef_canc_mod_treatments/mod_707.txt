She was started on Ceftazidime, Amikacin, and Diflucan after receiving a 17-day course of Ceftriaxone and Levaquin.
She also had a prolonged need for mechanical ventilation at [**Hospital3 417**] and arrived at [**Hospital3 **] status post tracheostomy and peg-tube placement on [**10-27**].
Status post trans-abdominal resection of stomach and distal esophagus in [**2136**], status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

GENERAL:  She was an obese intubated woman on a ventilator in no apparent distress.
There was a tracheostomy tube in placed.
A right IJ triple-lumen catheter was also placed.
There was a right radial arterial line in place.
LABORATORY DATA:  Data revealed the white cell count of 19.3; hematocrit 30.6; platelets 234,000; sodium 137; potassium 3.7; chloride 96; bicarbonate 35; BUN 22 and creatinine 0.2; glucose 164; ALT 70; AST 35; alkaline phosphatase 171; total bilirubin 0.4; albumin 1.8; calcium 7.5; magnesium 1.4; phosphate 3.
Microbiology tests done at [**Hospital **] Hospital revealed the following:  negative tests for hepatitic C antibody, hepatitis A, IgM hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis B core IgM.
Pulmonary:   Ms. [**Known lastname **] remained on mechanical ventilation throughout the duration of her hospital course.
The indication for mechanical ventilation was hypoxic respiratory failure.
At the time of admission to [**Hospital3 **], the question was raised of the diagnosis of BOOP, for which she had been started on high-dose intravenous corticosteroids at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital.
She remained on Ceftazidime, Amikacin, and Diflucan for several days after admission cultures at that point ruled Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
At that time, her antibiotic regimen was changed to Imipenem and Zosyn.
After several days on the combination of Imipenem and Zosyn, the decision was made to change the antibiotic regimen to Zosyn and Bactrim.
A day later the antibiotic regimen was changed to Trinamm and Bactrim because of a possible drug reaction to Zosyn.
She was started on Bactrim on [**11-9**], and Triamm on [**11-10**].
She received a course of Acyclovir per the dermatology recommendations.
She received treatment with appropriate antibiotics.
She was gradually weaned to pressure-support ventilation, and on [**11-14**], she successfully tolerated a four-hour, tracheostomy-collar trial.
In the last week, prior to discharge, the number of secretions gradually declined and her lung examination dramatically improved.
She began receiving physical therapy in the Intensive Care Unit and will need [**Hospital 4820**] rehabilitation to improve her muscle strength.
Sugars had been fine off supplemental corticosteroids.
Hematology:  The patient received several transfusions of red blood cells for dropping hematocrit.
She does have a history of pernicious anemia for which she received vitamin 12 shots (100 mcg every month).
DISCHARGE STATUS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] will be discharged to a rehabilitation facility for [**Hospital 4820**] rehabilitation and long-term intravenous antibiotics.
Per the recommendations of the Infectious Disease Consult Service, she should receive six-week course of Trinamm and IV Bactrim.
She began receiving the Trinamm on [**11-10**] and began receiving Bactrim on [**11-9**].
If there is no improvement, a surgical opinion regarding hospital resection would be indicated.
