She also received small doses of IV lasix with a small improvement.
She eventually weaned from a NRB to 6L nasal cannula on the day of discharge.
We advise continued weaning of her oxygen as tolerated by the patient.
Hypotension: We thought that the patient's hypotension was secondary to volume depletion as demonstrated by its rapid response with IV fluids.
We held her antihypertensive medications initally and slowly added them as her pressure stabilized.
PNA: The patient was first started on levoquin but in light of her increasing hypoxia she was switched to zosyn to broaden her coverage.
She remained afebrile and without a leukoctyosis was thus discharged on a 7 day course of levofloxacin.
The abd on exam is soft, and completely benign, without a suggestion of a surgical abdomen.
Afib/Sick Sinus:  Pt is s/p pacemaker placement.
Prophylaxis:  The patient was continued on heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis along with a PPI as per her outpatient regimen.
