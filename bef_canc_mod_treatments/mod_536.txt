old  with history of Crohn's disease who presented with recurrent fevers and abdominal pain consistent with a Crohn's flare.
After completing his antibiotic course as an outpatient setting he developed fevers to 102 F that persisted over 10 days.
The patient was admitted to the East Surgical Service on [**2186-11-30**] and started on Cipro/Flagyl intravenous empirically.
Patient continued to spike fevers and was taken to the operating room on [**2186-12-5**] where he underwent exploratory laparoscopic, total abdominal colectomy and splenectomy.
Patient received a total of  3 units red blood cell, 4.5 Liter lactated ringers and 500 ml Albumin 5% throughout the procedure in response to estimated blood loss of 1500 cc  during splenectomy.
Patient required phenylephrine briefly during the operation but was easily weaned off at closing.
Due to difficulty oxygenation on PEEP of 5, patient was kept intubated and was transferred to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation and monitoring overnight.
He was successfully extubated on [**2186-12-6**] on 40% aerosol cool and sats in the mid 90's.
He had a nasogastric in place and complained of difficulty swallowing most likely due to intubation.
He also had bilateral JP drains which were eventually discontinued.
Postoperatively he was weaned off the patient care analgesia and was transitioned to oral analgesia.The nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day 5.
On [**2186-12-8**], the patient was noted to have an oxygenation saturation of 85% on 3L NC O2, lungs sounds were diminished but the patient appeared stable.
He responded appropriately to an albuterol nebulizer however, after the therapy was completed, he promptly dropped his O2 sat back to the 80's.
The patient was taken to radiology for drainage of this pleural effusion.
Because of concerns for pneumonia, the patient was started on a coarse ceftriaxone intravenously until eventually being changed to Augmentin by mouth.
Chest PT, nebulizing treatments, and incentive spirometry continued and the patient improved to sating 96% on room air.
The Foley catheter was discontinued and he is voiding without any difficulty.
Of note he was noted to have +2 lower extremity edema and was restarted on home dose Hydrochlorothiazide.
