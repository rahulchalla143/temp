Incidental note of an adherent cholesterol stone versus gallbladder polyps.
Calcified right upper lobe granuloma, calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, calcified intra-abdominal lymph nodes, as well as punctate calcifications in the spleen and liver and atrophic calcified left kidney are all consistent with previous granulomatous infection including tuberculosis infection.
Markedly abnormal appearance of the large bowel leading into the patient's diverting colostomy with edematous-appearing wall again demonstrated.
Peripherally enhancing cystic structures in the seminal vesicles are new since the study of [**11-15**], and raise the possibility of seminal vesiculitis and/or prostatitis with abscesses.
Transrectal aspiration can be performed under ultrasound guidance if clinically indicated.
He was admitted for ATG and cyclosporine therapy.
His cyclosporine was started at 300 mg PO BID.
His dose was changed initially to 200 mg PO q12 because of hypertension, tachycardia and developement of spasms, that were thought to be secondary to cylosporin.
The rigors resolved with demerol and for the fevers, he was given tylenol.
For the hypertension, he was started on nifedipine with good control.
He was also started on prednisone during his course and this was slowly tapered down.
He was started on GCSF 480 mcg qd b/c of this.
He was started on Atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
He was continued on isoniazide and pyridoxine for empiric treatment of TB and was to follow-up with ID after discharge regarding when to stop these medications.
* Enterococcus bacteremia: Patient spiked a temperature and was found to have growth of enterococcus sensitive to ampicillan from PICC line on [**1-21**].
The PICC line was removed and the patient was treated with ampicillan and gentamicin.
She was treated with fluids, lasix and lactulose to help decrease her potassium levels.
Her potassium levels normalized after addition of florinef and remained stable throughout the rest of her admission.
* Pseudomonas UTI: Patient developed pseudomonas UTI for which he was treated with Ceftazidime for 7 days.
He was treated for this with acyclovir and the lip lesions resolved.
Nystatin was started and the lesions disappeared over the course of the admission.
* HTN: His hypertension was well controlled with Nifedepine TID.
He received sugar on bowel to try to osmotically shrink the edema; this was tried 3 times with small improvement.
We felt that it would be advantageous for him to have surgical intervention while in house, in a situation where his medical issues were better controlled rather than to send him to rehab, where potential worsening of his bowel edema would constitute a surgical emergency.
Patient received stress dose steroids, platelets on call to the OR as well as dapsone, gent, and flagyl for 72 hours.
Steroid taper was also initiated.
BP control was done with lopressor and hydralazine.
C.Diff x 3 was sent - all of which were negative and pt was started on Zosyn along with flagyl and linezolid, and made NPO.
Tx to TSICU on POD9 after started on ambisome and had BP drop.
On [**2-19**] he was tx to Heme/Onc and Surgery will cont to closely follow.
Subseqent BMT Course: # Aplastic anemia: Danazol and epogen ([**2-27**]) were started in addition to prior neupogen to try and aid hematopoiesis.
Neupogen was stopped on [**3-18**] as his ANC did not seem to improve on this therapy.
He was tapered off of cyclosporin, stopping on [**2-26**].
He was also continued on atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis and fluconazole was added for ppx.
He will follow up with hem/onc ([**Doctor Last Name 410**]) as an outpatient for repeated transfusions and decision regarding need for further epogen and danazol.
# Bradycardia: pt was put on telemetry after having a brief episode of disorientation, red face, ?dyspnea (witnessed by nurse) - recovered quickly.
metoprolol was lowered to 12.5 tid as of [**3-22**].
# H/o of granulomatous disease: As above.
The patient was treated with nifedipine, metoprolol, and hydralazine at the time of transfer from SICU.
Lisinopril was added and hydralazine discontinued to simplify the regimen.
# Colostomy revision: Surgery continued to follow the patient when he was transferred back to the BMT service.
# Fever: At the time of transfer the patient was afebrile, and he was soon switched to PO antibiotics.
Urology evaluated the patient and recommended ultrasound guided aspiration of this area.
Ultrasound revealed no abnormality, so the aspiration procedure was cancelled.
# Mild Renal Insufficiency: Patient had poor PO intake and was maintained on gentle IVF's for much of his hospital admission.
However, he was encouraged to increase intake and florinef was added to aid in retention of intravascular volume, and Cr was stable at ~1.1.
# Confusion: The patient developed mental status changes while on the surgery service.
Sedating medications were held.
