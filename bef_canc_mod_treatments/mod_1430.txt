4- Successful primary angioplasty to the LAD with two Promus DES to mid vessel (culprit lesion) 5- Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD with two Cypher DESs 6- Successful closure of the RCFA (arteriotomy) with a 6F Angioseal  Echo ([**2165-3-26**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o M who presented with substernal chest pain, STEMI and Vfib arrest.
