However, patient spiked T to 101.4 one week later, and blood cx's drawn from his temp HD line grew Enterococcus raffinous and micrococcus on [**11-14**] and VRE (E. Facecium) on [**11-17**].

Subsequent cannulation and opacification of the biliary tree reveal normal-sized CBD, intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ducts, and cystic duct as well as the gallbladder without evidence of filling defects or strictures.
Elevated liver enzymes, cholestatic pattern:  The ddx includes but not limited to cholangitis (given fever, leukocytosis, and possible partially treated process at OSH that worsened with discontinuation of gram negative/anaerobic coverage), cholestasis from sepsis, medication-induced hepatotoxicity (i.e.
nafcillin given peripheral eosinophilia), and vanishing bile duct syndrome.
Both hepatology, ERCP, and general surgery followed the patient.
Bacteremia: Patient with [**Month/Year (2) 8974**] on [**11-4**] -[**11-6**], enterococcus and micrococcus on [**11-14**] and VRE on [**11-17**] catheter blood cx.
Pt then had a temporary HD line in R groin, which grew enterococcus raffinosis and micrococcus in one sample, but no others.
This line was removed and he had a second temporary HD line placed.
Patient was switched from antibiotic regimen of vancomycin, nafcillin, and cefepime to linezolid on [**11-22**].
New tunnelled hemodialysis line was placed on [**11-28**].
Linezolid was switched to daptomycin for greater efficiacy against endocarditis.
Given patient's multiple episodes of bacteremia and new murmur on physical exam, the infectious disease team recommended treating patient with full 6 week course of daptomycin (end date [**1-3**]) from last positive culture for presumed endocarditis.
Unhealed left proximal tibia fracture: Patient presented with left knee swollen and warm.
Aspirate showed 70,000 WBCs, 330,000 RBCs, and gram stain was negative in the setting of longterm antibiotics.
Patient tolerated the procedure well, without any acute complications.
ESRD on HD:  Patient had a line holiday from [**Date range (1) 71409**].
New tunnelled catheter placed on [**11-28**].
Diabetes Type I:  His glucose was well controlled on Lantus and RISS.
Olanzapine was held due to possible side effect of cholestasis and restarted on [**2176-11-27**].
Patient required several doses of halidol during hospitalization for agitation, but this resolved by the time of discharge.
He was treated with lactulose, rifaximin for empiric treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.
Lactulose and rifaximin were stopped by time of discharge.
Acute on chronic anemia of iron-deficiency and CKD:  His baseline Hct ~28%.
He received a total of 3 units of PRBCs following evacuation of septic hematoma on [**11-28**].
