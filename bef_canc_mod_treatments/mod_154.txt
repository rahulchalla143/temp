Labs on discharge:   Brief Hospital Course: 74yo Russian speaking M with h/o ?CHF (normal stress test [**2151**], normal EF), lung cancer s/p LUL lobectomy and radiation, bladder cancer s/p radical cystectomy, UC on Prednisone/Azathioprine presented 1 wk ago with productive cough of green sputum, fevers, and dyspnea on exertion for [**3-15**] wks, found to have PNA.
On arrival pt triggered for AFib/RVR to 140-150's given Metoprolol IV x3 leading to hypoTN, given IVF's and became hypoxic.
Sent to MICU where RVR controlled with Diltiazem and converted to NSR.
Called out and was continued on treatment for PNA, AFib and continued to improve.
Community acquired-pneumonia: Complicated by chronic immunosuppression on Prednisone and Azathiprine.
Treated initially for CAP with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin; however given decompensation and MICU admission, pt was broadened with Vancomycin.
Completed 6d course of Azithromycin, 7d course of Vancomyin, and 14 of Ceftriaxone transitioned to Cefpodoxime to complete as an outpatient.
Given nodal agents that dropped his blood pressure, so given IVF's to maintain pressure but then had some element of flash edema with hypoxia, so sent to MICU where Diltiazem was initiated and converted him to NSR.
Per discussion with son, and with [**Name (NI) 16064**] of only 1, pt was only treated with ASA 325.
On discharge, home Atenolol was stopped in favor of Diltiazem, and of note pt without known h/o low EF or infarct; had normal mibi scan in [**2151**].
Likely due to V/Q mismatch from PNA and low reserve given s/p LUL lobectomy.
Ulcerative colitis/proctitis: Was on home mesalamine, Prednisone, Azathioprine before admission and per discussion with pt's GI Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**], these were all continued; Prednisone was given 30 mg x3d, 20mg x3d, then 10 mg every other day per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] continued until he sees Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] in follow up.
Atenolol was stopped and switched to Diltiazem as above.
