History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 yo woman with pulmonary fibrosis and COPD on transtracheal home oxygen (3-4L) and chronic prednisone (10mg po daily) who was admitted to the MICU on [**2136-6-6**] for worsening dyspnea and hypoxia after elective bronchoscopy earlier that day.
Because of the six weeks of worsening dyspnea and two days of increased cough productive of prurulent sputum (which coincided with an episode of prolonged epistaxis c/w prior history, though patient denies any link to her SOB), she was scheduled for elective bronchoscopy on day of admission.
Pt was monitored post procedure without event and was transferred back to the rehab where she and her husband have been living for the last 2 months.
She was given Vanc/Levofloxacin, Albuterol and Ipratropium for possible PNA.
She denies any dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, or vomiting.
She has baseline dark stools due to iron replacement and this remains unchanged.

# Dyspnea:  The etiology of Mrs.[**Known lastname 670**] acute worsening of her chronic dyspnea was not clear, but the differential at admission included bronchospasm s/p bronch, ACS, respiratory infection, IPF flare, acute anemia, and CHF.
She was clinically euvolemic with TTE unchanged, troponin peak 0.09, which trended down; EKG changes in absence of symptoms thought to be due to LVH with strain in the setting of acute hematocrit drop.
Given the history of increased cough and sputum production with no acute process on chest CT, sputum positive for GPC and GNR (likely colonization, but possibly bronchitis), she was treated empirically for COPD exacerbation with levofloxacin (completed 6 day course) and rapid prednisone taper to chronic 10mg dose.
Patient is maintained on chronic ferrous sulfate and epoetin for anemia of chronic disease with a history of transfusion requirements at times of bleeding, including epistaxis.
She was seen by ENT, who felt there was no need for intervention and recommended nasal saline.
Epoetin was due (but not given) [**6-8**].
# Anticoagulation (s/p mechanical MVR in 99): INR was 2.3 on admission.
Baseline warfarin dose is 5mg.
ICU re-started coumadin at 2.5 mg given that patient received levofloxacin in the ED.
On the floor, the patient was covered with LMWH given subtherapeutic INR, and warfarin dose was increased to baseline 5mg.
# AF/Aflutter s/p PCM for sick sinus node: Pt followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], maintained on Dofetilide, anticoagulated with coumadin.
# Systolic CHF: baseline EF 40-45%, though denies any symptoms of volume overload and appears clinically dehydrated on exam with mildly elevated creatinine.
Continued spironolactone and held Bumex initially given that patient was hypovolemic-euvolemic on exam.
Patient continued to appear euvolemic throughout admission, and Bumex was restarted at 2mg po BID upon discharge.
# Hypertension: Amlodipine 5mg daily was continued and patient remained normotensive throughout admission.
