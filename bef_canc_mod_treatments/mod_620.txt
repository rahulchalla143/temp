The procedure with intravenous contrast was done but the patient developed respiratory distress and her arterial blood gases were pH 7.07/88/56 with oxygen saturation 70%.
She was bradycardic and required admission to Medical Intensive Care Unit, responded well to Epinephrine and then Atropine on second occasion.
She was started on Aspirin and Nitroglycerin which produced transient hypotension requiring Dopamine.
She was extubated after one and one half days on the Intensive Care Unit stay and was transferred to C-Medicine with successful extubation for further medication management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 72 year old woman with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, now transferred from Medical Intensive Care Unit after respiratory arrest after intravenous contrast.
After she received intravenous contrast, she had respiratory distress and bradycardia.
She required intubation but responded well to Epinephrine and Atropine.
Her echocardiogram revealed moderate depression of ejection fraction, and she was started on the above medications.
Status post respiratory arrest requiring intubation - As I mentioned in the history of present illness, the patient required intubation and her respiratory arrest was most likely due to contrast allergy, less likely due to ischemic event.
She was started on ace inhibitor and beta blockers which will be continued for presumed coronary artery disease.
Pulmonary - The patient had acute respiratory arrest after intravenous dye.
She required intubation for over 24 hours, after extubation remained without any signs of hypoxia and stable.
LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count on admission revealed white blood count 13.0, on discharge 7.0, red blood cells 3.46 and on discharge 3.34, hemoglobin 12.2, hematocrit 33.3, MCV 100, RDW 11.9, platelet count 221,000.
