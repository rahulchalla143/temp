Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1. tracheostomy 2. sinus biopsy 3. arterial line 4.
Past Medical History: -breast cancer, diagnosed in [**2102**]; bilateral with metastases to lymph nodes, s/p lumpectomy, local radiation and 5FU/adriamycin -osteoarthritis -s/p R-knee and L-hip replacement ([**2109**]) -Atrial fibrillation -rheumatoid arthritis -h/o adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy -ulcerative colitis, s/p ileostomy -restrictive lung disease (related to radiation and/or amiodarone) -dilated cardiomyopathy   Social History: The pt denied use of tobacco or illicit drugs.
Imaging: [**2111-7-17**]: Chest CT (oupt): Bilateral apical consolidation with traction bronchiectasis consistent with post-radiation changes.
A Foley catheter is present within the collapsed bladder as well as note of a small amount of air, which may be seen with recent manipulation.
An ileostomy is noted in the right lower uadrant.
No definite signs of infection given limitations of technique and streak artifact.
Enhancement in this area has also decreased.
Followup is recommended and should be based on clinical grounds.
[**9-12**]: Portable CXR: A left-sided PICC line terminates at the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein, and upper superior vena cava.
A tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position.
A Dobhoff tube is seen extending towards the stomach antrum.
Lines and tubes as indicated above.
In addition, the pt was ruled-out for tuberculosis with acid fast smear taken from endotracheal samplings.
A biopsy would have been the only means to make the ultimated diagnosos, but this procedure was considered to be too dangerous (per Neurosurgery).
The infectious disease consult team recommended treating for presumptive bacterial infection with intravenous ceftriaxone, ampicillin, vancomycin and metronidazole.
It was felt that given the location of the lesion, biopsy or drainage would entail too great a likelihood of morbidity.
The antibiotic regimen at this point was changed to meropenem (to cover gram positive and negative organisms as well as Nocardia) and ambisome to cover fungal pathogens.
High-dose dexamethasone was also added and later tapered.
This demonstrated decreased size of the lesion and surrounding edema after treatment with antibiotics  Given the high suspicion for Listeria as the etiologic [**Doctor Last Name 360**], with other possible pathogens including HSV, the antibiotic regimen was changed to high-dose penicillin and acyclovir at this time.
Acyclovir was discontinued after 10 days.
The steroids have been tapered down to prednisone 8 mg daily, on which she needs to remain (i.e.
SHe completed course of penicillin G to treat the presumed Listeria abscess.
She was maintained on metoprolol and diltiazem was added to aid in rate-control.
Amiodarone was discontinued per her cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**].
Anticoagulation was held early in the course of the admission over concern for hemorrhage into the pontine lesion, but was later restarted.
Coumadin was held until PLT had recovered (i.e.
She was reloaded on amiodarone as it seemed to be the only [**Doctor Last Name 360**] that adequately rate controlled her which was necessary to improve filling times forward flow but this was subsequently d/c.
She is currently rate controlled on digoxin (last level 1.1 on [**10-8**]) and metoprolol 25 mg QID with hr ranging from 90-120.
She is currently being reloaded on coumadin as she is subtherapeutic.
These might have been related to her primary brainstem lesion in combination with sedation and blood loss (see below).
For support she was started on neosynephrine gtt when needed.
Most recently she again required pressors on [**10-6**] following a large volume thoracentesis.
She was able to be weaned off pressors w/o stress dose steroids and stabilized on vanc/meropenem.
Thus, plan for 10 day course of vancomycin to end on [**2111-10-17**].
Patient has now been stable off pressors x 7 days.
She should be started on diureses while at rehab, when her BP is stable.
We opted not to start diuresis on discharge as we were titrating her metoprolol.
We recommend a dose of Lasix 10 IV BID with goal negative fluid balance of 500-1000cc per day.
A tracheostomy was performed on [**8-13**].
She was placed on ventilator support.
Bronch specimen produced stenotrophomonas maltophilia and patient completed a 21 day course of bactrim for this.
As described above, patient also being tx for MRSA PNA and is currently d9/10.
Erythromycin gtt and artificial tearts should be continued.
A patch over her left eye will help her manage her diplopia.
Bactrim was therefore discontinued but later restarted without further thrombocytopenia.
Infectious disease: -Brainstem abcess: Responded well to penicillin G i.v.
She has received a total of 8 week course with penicillin G. -MRSA in sputum/sinus/stool culture, representing colonization.
The patient was started on PPI iv q 12hrs, to be converted to PO BID upon discharge.
This should be improved by ace-wraps, improvement of protein status and mobilization.
