Admission Date:  [**2199-5-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-6-4**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status, hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: right-sided thoracentesis [**5-20**]  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]yo F with a PMH of SDH s/p burr hole evacuation [**2199-4-14**], recent STEMI and medical management [**2199-4-17**], and multiple UTIs, now presents with CHF, fevers, and altered mental status.
Ms. [**Known lastname 4402**] was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-4-30**] after a 4d hospitalization for altered mental status, felt to possibly be due to UTI and/or pneumonia (treated with levaquin) and benzodiazepine usage (ativan).
She had been on her baseline O2 requirement of 2L by nc, but over the last week, was noted to have increased O2 need and crackles on exam.
Attempts were made to diurese her with 40mg IV lasix daily.
A foley catheter was placed on [**2199-5-14**] for better I/O monitoring.
A UA was checked and was suspicious for a UTI, so she was started on levofloxacin.
In speaking to her RN at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, the patient was noted to have lost 6 lbs in the last week (wt of 131 -> 125 lbs) with diuresis and there was a concern that she was becoming dry.
She was given 500cc NS in ER, then 40mg IV lasix (once her CXR returned).
She spiked a fever, so was given PR tylenol and levaquin IV.
Her troponin also returned elevated at 0.20 and she was given a rectal dose of aspirin.
Past Medical History: # SDH s/p burr hole on [**2199-4-14**] - SDH dx [**2199-3-26**] after fallx2 (on coumadin for afib) - had 6mm MLS to the right - started on dilantin - dx w/ pneumonia, treated w/ Augmentin - readmitted [**4-6**] for worsening mental status changes - rpt head CT showed worsening MLS, increased edema - given ciprofloxacin for UTI - underwent burr hole evacuation on [**2199-4-14**] # STEMI s/p vfib arrest - had witnessed CP -> cardiac arrest at rehab on [**4-17**] (was vfib)  - shocked x6, lidocaine bolus, then lidocaine gtt -> NSR - then went into afib, amio bolus and then amio gtt - was intubated for airway protection - ECHO on [**2199-4-18**] showed EF 30-40%, with severe HK of inferior, posterior, and lateral walls; RV function also depressed - ?
diastolic as ECHO in '[**98**] showed EF 60% # atrial fibrillation # ventral hernia # multinodular goiter # diverticulitis - s/p fistula between bowel/bladder -> surgically corrected # h/o MRSA in abdominal wound in [**2192-2-10**], nares negative in [**5-14**]  # HTN # s/p hemangioblastoma at C5/6 level with cord compression [**2-15**] bleed - s/p neurosurgical decompression on [**2193-6-6**] - has residual L-sided weakness and neuropathy # macular degeneration # h/o CVA (?)
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferolateral hypokinesis/ akinesis.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
Evidence of right ventricular strain including persistence of contrast and dilatation of the IVC and hepatic veins.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]yo F with history of SDH s/p burr hole evacuation, recent STEMI medically managed, now with Staph aureus bacteremia and left atrial clot, transferred to the MICU for worsening hypoxia and unresponsiveness, then called out to the floor for further management of her multiple medical problems as below.
Repeated CXRs revealed stable b/l pleural effusions (R>L) with amount of pulmonary edema varying with diuresis vs. fluid administration; there were no infiltrates.
She was maintained on shovel mask as above, while on the floor.
# Mental status changes:  Throughout her hospital course, her mental status waxed and waned, and delirium was thought to be multifactorial given her age, hospitalization, infection, sedating medication (zyprexa), and hypercarbia.
ABG did reveal hypercapnea with pCO2 in the 60-70 range, however family wishes were not to intubate nor transfer to the ICU for noninvasive measures such as bipap.
She remained somnolent and largely unarousable on the floor.
She was started on vancomycin and surveillance cultures have shown no MRSA growth since [**5-25**] (at which time [**1-17**] were positive).
She does have a right shoulder effusion, but clinically and on orthopedics evaluation, it does not appear to be a septic joint.
Midline and right IJ pulled on [**2199-5-30**] and new PICC line was placed.
Given the evolution of code status and family wishes to a focus on comfort due to lack of substantial clinical improvement, antibiotics were continued until discharge at which time they were discontinued.
Likely formed in the setting of v. fib arrest and chronic atrial fibrillation as she was not on anticoagulation most recently prior to this admission given her recent SDH and subsequent burr hole evacuation.
As above, subsequent surveillance cultures have been negative while on vancomycin therapy.
She was originally placed on heparin gtt and was then transitioned to PO coumadin which, given her decline in mental status and transition to focus on comfort was discontinued.
Given her tenuous respiratory status on shovel mask on the floor IVF were intermittently administered while on the floor without significant improvement in urine output nor renal function.
# CV: a. CAD:  s/p STEMI and v. fib arrest in [**4-/2199**], medically managed.
She was continued on ASA, BB, and statin while able to take oral medications.
These were also discontinued with decline in MS. .
Pump:  EF 45% w/ inferolateral hypokinesis s/p STEMI as above, diastolic dysfunction as well.
She was diuresed prn without improvement in O2 requirements on the floor and additionally developed increased bicarb in the setting of diuresis (contraction), but also in the setting of worsening respiratory acidosis as above (increasing pCO2).
c. Rhythm:  Atrial fibrillation with largely in the 90s-100s occasionally requiring IV lopressor for rate control when unable to take PO meds.
She was transitioned from heparin gtt to coumadin as above.
Iron studies reveal low iron at 17, TIBC 213, and ferritin of 171 and appears to reflect iron deficiency anemia and element of ACD given low TIBC.
Neurosurgery evaluated her on this admission and cleared her for the reinitiation of anticoagulation as SDH had resolved.
She was maintained on insulin sliding which, but finger sticks and SS coverage were discontinued to maintain patient's comfort.
# UTI:  Had enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin at OSH that was treated prior to this admission.
# Access:  Left PICC placed [**5-30**].
Medications on Admission: amiodarone 100mg PO QD ASA 81mg PO QD RISS lisinopril 2.5mg PO QD megace 40mg PO BID metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID MVI 1 tab PO QD pantoprazole 40m PO QD   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: MRSA septicemia Left atrial thrombus Hypoxia due to end stage COPD Acute renal failure Systolic and diastolic heart failure .
