Thoracoabdominal repair of incarcerated paraesophageal     hernia with reduction of gastric volvulus.
Repair of esophagotomy and gastrotomy.
Bronchoscopy with aspiration of secretions.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is unfortunate 41-year-old gentleman with Marfan syndrome status post extensive aortic dissection who has had multiple vascular procedures including de-branching of the head vessels which are now fed with new grafts from the ascending aorta and the femoral axillary graft with Endo grafting of the ascending aorta, arch and descending aorta, de-branching of the visceral aorta with static grafting and extra-anatomic reconstruction of both renal arteries, the celiac access and superior mesenteric artery.
About 10 months ago he presented with spontaneous rupture of the esophagus and underwent a very complex repair of the left thoracotomy with primary repair buttressed by gastric fundus and transposition of the omentum.
He had a very long convalescence but eventually did well.
After careful radiographic and endoscopic evaluation it was recommended that he undergo a thoracoabdominal repair of this.
It was unclear prior to surgery whether we would perform separate thoracotomies and laparotomy or one thoracoabdominal incision.
