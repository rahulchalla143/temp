PROCEDURE:  Abdominal aortogram with unilateral extremity runoff, Perclose of right groin, left groin exploration with common femoral and profunda endarterectomy with bovine patch angioplasty, SFA embolectomy, below-knee [**Doctor Last Name **] exploration with vein patch angioplasty following embolectomy of anterior tibial and posterior tibial arteries; four compartment fasciotomies through 2 incisions.
URINE OUTPUT:  Zero as the patient was on peritoneal dialysis.
COMPLICATIONS:  There were no complications and the patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated and taken to the cardiovascular intensive care unit in guarded condition.
The decision was made for urgent arteriography with decisions for possible embolectomy versus bypass versus catheter based intervention.
Retrograde access was obtained to the right common femoral artery using the micropuncture technique after infiltration of local anesthesia.
A 4-French angled glide catheter was placed into the left external iliac artery after this was accessed using the floppy angled Glidewire and then serial images were obtained of the left lower extremity down to and including the foot.
At this point, the decision was made to cut down the left groin so the glide catheter was removed and the 4-French sheath was sutured into place.
She was given intravenous antibiotics.
A longitudinal arteriotomy was made in the common femoral artery and there was a large amount of thrombus present.
This was pulled out using a snap and then a #3 and #4 embolectomy catheter was passed down the superficial femoral artery with a large amount of clot removed.
A #3 embolectomy catheter was passed down the profunda and there was excellent amount of clot removed.
A bovine pericardium patch was created and sewn into place using a 6-0 Prolene.
This was not feasible so the SFA and funda were back bled and then there was good forward flow and the sutures were tied and the patch was punctured with a regular 0.018 needle and then [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire was placed and a long 6-French sheath was placed into this patch.
Arteriography was then performed of the left lower extremity and there was still noted to be a large amount of clot at the tibioperoneal trunk and despite multiple attempts with the export catheter over a [**Name (NI) 41314**] PT wire which had been placed into the posterior tibial artery and despite multiple passes with the excisor vacuum assisted battery-operated thrombectomy device, there was still a tremendous amount of clot in the anterior tibial and the posterior tibial so these were pulled out and the sheath was left in place.
The proximal below-knee popliteal artery was isolated and vessel loops were placed around the anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial artery and tibioperoneal trunk.
At this point a longitudinal arteriotomy was made in the below-knee popliteal artery and a #2 embolectomy catheter was passed into the anterior tibial artery all the way to approximately 60 cm and a large amount of thrombus was removed after multiple passes and ultimately there was excellent backbleeding.
Attempts were made to pass the #2 embolectomy catheter down the posterior tibial artery but there was a clot lodged immediately distal to the arteriotomy and this would no come out so the arteriotomy was extended onto the posterior tibial and ultimately this clot was removed.
The #2 embolectomy catheter was passed easily down into the foot and pulled back with a good amount of clot removed and excellent backbleeding.
A patch was created and sewn into place using 6-0 Prolenes.
A fasciotomy was performed of the anterior and lateral compartments through a separate incision which was 1 cm anterior to the tibia.
The sheath was removed from the left groin and a U stitch Prolene was placed.
Surgicel was placed and then hemostasis was checked for.
The patient had been on heparin throughout this case and was intermittently bolused to keep her ACT's around 300.
At this point 20 mg of protamine was given and the left groin was closed in layers of 2-0, 3-0 and staples for the skin.
The decision was made to leave the patient on heparin as multiple attempts had been made without success to remove all the clot from the distal foot.
There is patency of the external and internal iliacs bilaterally.
There are then images taken after there was a sheath placed through the left groin patch.
There is patency of the below- knee popliteal artery and the proximal anterior tibial artery but clot sitting in the anterior tibial artery going down towards the foot.
There is injection of papaverine followed by one completion run showing the same appearance with poor flow into the foot.
Successful removal of clot from the common femoral     artery followed by bovine patch angioplasty.
Heparin gtt initiated.
Radial a-line placed and bear hugger applied for hypothermia.
Continued on a heparin gtt and diet advanced to regular.
Continued on peritoneal dialysis per nephrology recommendations.
2 units of PRBC given for hct= 29 and symptomatic hypovolemia.
Coumadin started for anticoagulation with goal [**12-22**].
Wound irrigated and packed with wet-dry dressing and ace wrap twice daily.
2 units of PRBC given for hct 24.3 which increased to 29.3 post-transfusion.
Pain control with tylenol (not a true allergy).
Coumadin for anticoagulation.
Statin started.
Continues Coumadin dosing, PD and rehab screening.
