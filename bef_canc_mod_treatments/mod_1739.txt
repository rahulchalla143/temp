She took 50 mg po prednisone at home the night before admission and nebs x 2, however her symptoms worsened so this morning she called EMS.
She was given solumedrol 125 mg IV once and multiple neb treatments.
Her inital EKG had a widened QRS and peaked T-waves so she was given 10 mg IV insulin, 1 amp D50, 1 amp sodium bicarb, and 1 gm calcium gluconate all x 2 with eventual improvement in her EKG findings.

She was also found to have acute renal failure with creatinine to 1.8 associated with a Klebsiella urinary tract infection and marked hyperkalemia to K 8.4.
Acute exacerbation of COPD The patient was found to have a pneumonia, the likely trigger of her Asthma/COPD exacerbation.
She was started on Levofloxacin for treatment of community acquired pneumonia and given a dose of IV steroids in the ED.
In the ICU, ceftriaxone was added to her antibiotic regimen, and she was started on oral prednisone, starting at a dose of 60mg and continued on nebulizers.
The patient has a baseline O2 requirement of 3L on nasal cannula at home; she was saturating at 98-100% on 2L nasal cannula upon discharge.
She is to complete a 5 day burst of prednisone 60mg daily from [**Date range (1) 51720**]/09.
She is also on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for treatment of community acquired pneumonia.
Please continue treatment to complete a 7 day course from [**Date range (1) 111062**].
Her lasix and aldactone were held on admission.
Lasix should be restarted in the next few days, as her creatinine improves and if she develops any lower extremity swelling.
She was taking KCl 20 mg po bid and aldactone 100 mg po daily as an outpatient which likely contributed to her hyperkalemia in the setting of ARF.
She was treated for her hyperkalemia in the ED with insulin, dextrose, bicarbonate, kayexalate, and calcium gluconate.
The patient did have EKG changes showing widening of the QRS complexes in the ED, but these changes resolved with the treatment she received in the ED.
She was admitted directly to the ICU, where she was treated with further insulin, dextrose, bicarbonate, adn kayexalate; her potassium responded well and was brought down to 4.8 by the next afternoon, so she was transferred to the floor.
We would recommend daily electrolyte checks for the next week to ensure stability of her potassium and continued improvement of her creatinine.
Urinary tract infection: The patient was found to have a urinary tract infection; the levofloxacin and ceftriaxone she was getting for pneumonia adequately covered for her urinary tract infection.
The patient stated that the last time she used steroid therapy for her COPD was about 1 year ago, so she was unlikely to have steroid-induced myopathy.
Atrial Fibrillation She has atrial fibrillation and is on rate control with both metoprolol and diltiazem.
She is not a candidate for anticoagulation due to gastrointestinal bleeding.
