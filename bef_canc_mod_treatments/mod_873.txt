He was hypotensive at OSH to SBP 80s, started on peripheral dopamine and sent to the ED.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.9 86 94/45 on dopamine 20 95%.
Vascular was consulted and felt aortic dissection was unlikely.
Due to persistent hypotension, a RIJ was placed and he was started on levofed.
He was not given any antibiotics as he was afebrile without e/o infection.

Dissection cannot be detected due to lack of IV contrast.
This may represent a mucocele, and elective resection should be considered.

# Shock/Hypotension: On arrival to the ED, patient's exam was most consistent with cardiogenic shock, with a prior known EF 25-30%.
His hypotension was likely triggered by new administration of minoxidil causing hypotension and stress leading to stress and demand ischemia.
Home BP medications were held, and he was started on levophed with a goal MAP of 55-60.
On admission to the MICU, an a-line was placed for monitoring of his blood pressures.
His CE were trended, showing elevation of troponin and mild elevation in CK in setting of acute kidney injury and demand ischemia.
Levophed was transitioned to dopamine and patient was started on lasix gtt for diuresis with good result.
Dopamine was weaned off on [**2204-4-11**].
Throughout hospitalization, patient was maintained on therapeutic INR with coumadin or with therapeutic PTT with heparin gtt given history of recently diagnosed LV thrombus.
In setting of renal failure, patient was started on carvedilol on [**2204-4-11**] and was not restarted on atenolol.
As an outpatient, the patient should be restarted on [**Last Name (un) **] and spironolactone as tolerated by BP and recovery of kidney function.
Carotid dopplers showed possible subclavian steal on right, so BP should be monitored on left.
Patient continued on ASA, plavix and atorvostatin through duration of hospitalization.
Atenolol was held secondary to renal failure and hypotension, and was later transitioned to carvedilol once cardiogenic shock had resolved.
Renal was consulted for help with management given his possible need for catheterization and severe renal dysfunction.
Kidney function improved with initiation of dopamine and lasix gtt.
Home [**Last Name (un) **] and atenolol were held given worsened renal function.
For secondary prevention,  risk factor management was optimized and patient constinued on strict control of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and on antiplatelet agents.
Patient contined on coumadin to prevent embolic stroke from known LV thrombus although this was held for a couple days during hospitalization while there was concern that proceedure might be needed as below.
Had been on warfarin as an outpatient but this was held for a couple days as inpatient as concern that patient would need additional invasive proceedures.
Placed on heparin gtt to cover while INR subtherapeutic.
Warfarin was restarted 2 days prior to D/c and INR climbing but only up to 1.8 on day of D/c so pt administered one sub-cutaneous dose of 80mg enoxaparin on day of discharge and given script for one additional dose of 80mg enoxaparin the next day.
Pharmacy was contact[**Name (NI) **] to confirm that dosing should be 80mg daily for therapeutic anti-coagulation in setting of improving renal failure.
Home regimen was held upon admission given poor PO intake and patient transitioned to glargine + ISS.
Insulin regimen was adjusted to maintain blood sugars in 100-200.
Ultimately put on NPH (70/30) regimen of 15 units in AM and 15 units in PM with ISS to cover.
Large appendix (12 mm diameter) but no secondary signs of appendicitis, enlarged pretracheal lymph node and hyperdense right renal mass that may represent a hemorrhagic cyst requires outpatient surgical follow-up.

You initially were sent to the cardiac ICU where medications were used to support your blood pressure.
You received contrast with this CT and medications after the CT to protect your kineys from the contrast.
Your warfarin was stopped for a couple days because we thought you might need additional proceedures with high risk of bleeding.
We also stopped many of your blood pressure medications because you had such a low blood pressure initially.
Your INR is currently slightly less than 2 even though we have restarted your warfarin so you will get a shot of lovenox today and give yourself 1 shot of lovenox tomorrow to make sure your blood is thin enough until you are seen in clinic on Monday.
The following changes were made to your medications: - Start carvedilol 25mg by mouth twice each day for blood pressure - Increase home furosemide to 80mg by mouth once each day for fluid - Start enoxaparin 80mg sub-cutaneously for 1 day (only take this medication on Saturday, then stop) - Your insulin coverage was changed to NPH 70/30 taking 15 units in the morning and 15 units in the evening with a sliding scale to cover your meal time insulin (see attached sheet) - Continue your home Atorvastatin, warfarin, plavix, aspirin, folic acid - Stop all your other home medications for now until further instructed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]: stop minoxidil, hydralazine, isosorbide mononitrate, spironolactone, cilostazol, atenolol, benicar, your former sliding scale.
Please make sure to check your blood sugars before each meal and give yourself the additional insulin as instructed by the attached insulin slidding scale.
This may represent a mucocele, and elective resection should be considered.
