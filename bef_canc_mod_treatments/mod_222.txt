The patient underwent rigid colonoscopy in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit which relieved the dilatation and allowed the patient to pass stool in there.
Initial blood and urine cultures were positive for E. coli in the urine and the patient was subsequently treated with Levaquin while on the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for urosepsis.
The patient was briefly on Levophed pressors for two days for hypotension, however, the patient subsequently responded to intravenous fluid hydration and was weaned off the Levophed, however, during the Surgical Intensive Care Unit admission, the patient had difficulty weaning off the ventilator and was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2134-4-19**].
The GI Service was consulted and on that date, the third out of third stool for Clostridium difficile came back positive.
Subsequently, the patient was started on Flagyl 500 mg p.o.
three times a day for C. difficile colitis and the Levaquin which the patient was being given for the urosepsis was discontinued.
The patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit for increased oxygen requirement which resolved with chest pulmonary toilet, mobilization and mobilization of secretions.

He was previously at [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation for the compression fracture.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 98.6 F.; blood pressure was 112/76; pulse was 56; respiratory rate was 24; O2 saturation was 94% on four liters nasal cannula.
Nasogastric tube was in place.
The patient had Venodyne boots in place for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
TSH was 0.4  Portable imaging:  The patient had a portable abdominal film which showed that they could not evaluate for placement of the nasogastric tube but there was a dilated sigmoid [**Hospital 499**].
The patient already had an echocardiogram with bubble study to evaluate for left-to-right shunt for his hypoxia.
While the patient was on the Floor, the patient was encouraged to continue with incentive spirometry.
Infectious Disease:  The patient was treated with a ten-day course of Flagyl for Clostridium difficile colitis.
The patient was on Prednisone so it was difficult to say why the patient's white blood cell count remained slightly elevated, however, at the time of dictation, the white blood cell count went back down to normal.
The patient was not started on any further antibiotics for pneumonia at the time of dictation given his history of C. difficile colitis.
Captopril was started at a low dose and titrated up to 25 mg p.o.
Albeit the risks of the patient being on an aspirin outweighed the benefits, the aspirin was held.
No further adjustments were made to the patient's blood pressure medications at the time of dictation.
The patient was continued on Protonix throughout the hospital stay for GI prophylaxis as well as for gastroesophageal reflux disease.
There was an incomplete evaluation of the larynx during swallow and a small amount of penetration without aspiration of all consistency liquids and mid-swallows followed with a neck inflection did not prevent penetration.
Subsequently, the patient's nasogastric tube was removed and the patient was allowed to tolerate p.o.
The patient did not have any problems with aspiration when he was allowed to eat, however, the advice was given with Speech and Swallow pathologists, that the patient should have only small sips of liquids when he drinks.
Endocrine:  For the patient's history of panhypopituitarism, the patient was continued on testosterone patch.
Prednisone was tapered to 10 mg from 40.
It was tapered by 10 mg every four to five days and is still in the process of being tapered down to the patient's baseline replacement dose for his history of panhypopituitarism.
The patient was also continued on Levoxyl for thyroid hormone replacement.
It was felt that this should be monitored while the patient is an inpatient as well as an outpatient as the patient may not be a great candidate for an ACE inhibitor.
Initially the Coumadin was held as per GI recommendations for the C. difficile colitis and the guaiac positive stools.
The patient was restarted on his Coumadin.
Aspirin was not restarted given the patient's history of rectal ulcer and lower gastrointestinal bleed.
It was felt that the patient probably should not be getting a lot of chest PT as well, although that would probably help out with his secretions, it may worsen the patient's rib fractures and T10 compression fracture.
Discharge diagnoses as well as Discharge Disposition, as well as Discharge Medications to be dictated as an addendum by the next covering intern.
