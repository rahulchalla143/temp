Admission Date:  [**2159-5-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-6-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-4-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ciprofloxacin / Opioid Analgesics / Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**] Chief Complaint: fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation/Extubation RIJ central line, now removed Lumbar puncture   History of Present Illness: 60 y.o.
M with hx of ESRD s/p cadaveric renal tx in [**2155**], on immunosuppressants, Hep C, HTN, [**Year (4 digits) 2320**], PVD presents from home with  fever to 105.8.
Patient says he was in his usual state of health as recently as Weds, when he saw his cardiologist in preparation for hernia repair surgery early next week.
Some of his usual medications including his prophylactic bactrim were held and he stayed home from work trying to avoid sick contacts pre-operatively.
He took some tylenol and his fever appeared initially to abate, but returned [**Year (4 digits) 2974**] with nausea and vomiting, constant shivering, shoulder aches, headaches, and three episodes of loose stools.
A R IJ line was placed and he was started on Vancomycin and Gentamycin for presumptive endocarditis.
End-stage renal disease, status post cadaveric renal transplant, creatinine 1.5 in [**2159-4-17**] Peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease.
Post-Op AFIB s/p DCCV in [**2-22**] Rt rectus femoris intramuscular hematoma - [**2-22**] (INR 4.2) ?
enlarged LN in his neck s/p bx - 2-3 years ago, pt reports nl EBV IgG positive in [**2154**]/CMV IgG positive hep B core ab + transplant: on lamivudine .
Cadaver renal transplant in [**2155-2-16**].
Induction with Thymoglobulin and Tacrolimus 4.
Parathyroidectomy in [**8-19**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] - path c/w hypercellular parathyroid 6.
Aortic Valve Replacement [**2157-12-15**] - Well seated aortic bioprosthesis with high-normal gradient and trace aortic regurgitation ([**2158-6-13**]).
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-6-16**], the aortic prosthesis gradient is significantly elevated.
There is no significant perinephric stranding about the transplant or about the transplant ureter.
This suggests possibility that this air may have been related to Foley catheter insertion.
[**6-3**]: CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-1**] and 17: Mild pulmonary edema, seen best in perihilar left lung has worsened slightly since [**6-2**], accompanied by persistent increase in caliber of mediastinal veins.
Right lung base is elevated, and atelectasis may explain consolidation in the right lower lung, but I am more concerned this is pneumonia.
Right jugular line ends in the SVC.
Air-fluid levels in paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells may relate in part to recent intubation and recently removed NG tube.
Right cephalic vein was not visualized in the present exam.
[**2159-6-6**]: MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**]: FINDINGS: There is diffuse low signal visualized in the vertebral bodies which could be due to marrow hyperplasia or infiltration and clinical correlation recommended.
[**2159-6-6**]: MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 60M PMH ESRD s/p cadaveric renal transplant in [**2155**] on immunosuppressants, HBV/HCV, HTN, DM2 presented from home with fever to 105.8, malaise, with nonspecific GI symptoms but no other localizing signs or symptoms.
He was maintained on antibiotics as discussed below for and has completed his course.
He became hemodynamically unstable [**5-27**] requiring aggressive volume resuscitation and pressors which were discontinued on [**5-30**].
He was covered broadly with vancomycin, zosyn and flagyl, which were discontinued on [**6-5**].
he was given a course of stress dose steroids during his acute hypotension.
#Penile lesions: Pressure ulcers formed while in the ICU, both a large frank ulcerated area on the glans penis (multiple smaller ulcerated areas on the foreskin) for which he was seen by urology, who recommended treatment with bacitracin with improvement, and a sacral decubitus ulcer for which we have tried turning patient and keeping him out of bed as much as possible, as well as general wound care.
# Hypotension: Most likely this was secondary to septic shock, also possibly  relative adrenal insufficiency given chronic prednisone use.
He was given Cortisol empiric high-dose steroids [**5-29**] and discontinued [**5-31**], without recurrence of hypotension.
He required pressors for a short period in the ICU.
# Acute on chronic kidney failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5 per recent records but has had intermittent acute on chronic disease, thought due to prograf toxicity.
At the time of discharge his renal function is normal and we have restarted lasix at 1/4 of his home dose (prior home dose 80mg po qday).
He was on lasix at home.
During his admission he was noted to have an EF of 40% on echocardiogram with global hypokinesis in the setting of his SIRS.
Only new medications at that time were lasix IV and chlorthiazide so these were discontinued (lasix PO is a home medication).
It began to abate after cessation of antibiotics and was felt to be antibiotic associated diarrhea.
# Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Likely bone marrow suppression in the setting of sepsis versus side effect of CellCept.
Once coumadin was restarted, the patient's stool became guaiac positive and required 2 units total of pRBC's (given on different days) to maintain Hct > 21.
He improved on an insulin gtt was then resumed on his home lantus and an insulin sliding scale with good control.
Coumadin was held on admission due to supratherapeutic INR.
He was given vitamin K. Coumadin was  restarted on callout to the floor from the ICU, however his INR was elevated after 5mg dosing.
His coumadin is now being held for drifting down of INR and should be restarted at 1mg po qday once his INR is <2.5.
# HTN: Initially, anti-hypertensives were held given septic shock.
Once hemodynamically stable, his metoprolol was restarted at half of his home dose, with plan to titrate up as tolerated.
