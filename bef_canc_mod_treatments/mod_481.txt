He saw his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2119-10-16**], who started him on Clindamycin 300 mg QID for 14 days for recurrent cellulitis, however, he was not tolerating the abx.
He was placed on Bactrim for 10 days (last day - [**2119-11-9**]).
He was also started on Miralax for 17 g daily for constipation.
Today, he was seen by visiting nurse today for INR check but was found to be in CHF exacerbation (SOB, edematous, 02 sat 87% on 3L, crackles 1/2 up.
He was given aspirin, lasix 40 x1, sl NG x2.

IMAGING STUDIES: [**2119-11-6**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and mitral valve replacement.
A left-sided AICD device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus.
[**2119-11-7**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST - Since [**2119-9-12**], bilateral interstitial thickening and ground-glass opacities have progressed, new multifocal peribronchial consolidations and small bilateral pleural effusions, right side more than left, are concerning for concurrent multifocal lung infection and pulmonary edema in the background of pre-existing interstitial abnormalities.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation in spite of a well seated mitral annuloplasty ring.
The urinary bladder could not be assessed as a Foley catheter is in place.
[**2119-11-12**] CXR - Since the prior radiograph there was interval insertion of right internal jugular line with its tip terminating in the level of cavoatrial junction.
The ET tube tip is 4.3 cm above the carina.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2119-11-25**] 11:54 AM Bedside frontal radiograph centered at the diaphragm shows nasogastric tube ending in the proximal duodenum, and the distal portions of a transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator and left ventricular pacer leads, as well as a right PICC lead that ends in the upper right atrium and retained epicardial leads.
BRONCHIAL WASHINGS Procedure Date of [**2119-11-7**] NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS Abundant hemosiderin-laden macrophages and squamous cells.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 M w Hx of systolic congestive heart failure (EF 50% in [**2119-8-26**]), CAD s/p CABG (SVG-LAD, SVG-OM1), PCI with LCx, mitral valve repair in [**2115**] (28 [**Doctor Last Name **] physio ring), biventricular ICD implantantation, and atrial fibrillation s/p AV-nodal ablation in [**2114**] (on Coumadin, INR 10.1 on presentation), who presented with worsening shortness of breath x 1-days duration found to have diffuse alveolar hemorrhage resulting in acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, coagulopathy and anemia with thrombocytopenia, which all fortunately resolved.
He also is on 2-3L home oxygen via nasal cannula at baseline.
On admission, he was acutely hypoxic with labored breathing and tachypnea, thus he was switched from his home nasal cannula to BiPAP with partial response initially.
He was also aggressively diuresed (with good diuretic response) on admission with a Lasix gtt and his CXR appeared worsened with worsening pulmonary status.
Etiologies considered: diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage (DAH) given coagulopathy and worsening CXR findings and acute hypoxia in the setting of adequate diuresis vs. lobar consolidation and pneumonia with superimposed pulmonary congestion vs. worsening diastolic heart failure with pulmonary congestion.
Pulmonary Medicine was consulted and a bronchoalveolar lavage with bronchoscopy was requested.
He was also noted to spike fevers to 101F with negative culture data, but he was covered with IV Vancomycin, Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone since admission -- and was broadened given concern for on-going fevers to Cefepime on [**11-9**].
We sent a number of vasculitides laboratory studies given the concern for a primary lung, renal and dermatologic process (see below), which included: a negative ANCA, negative [**Doctor First Name **], negative HIV antibody, anti-GBM, anti-histone, cyroglobulins, anti-lupus antibody, C3 and C4 levels were normal.
He received 5 mg PO Vitamin K, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (for an INR of 10.1 on admission, which improved) and 2 units of packed red cells total given an HCT of 21%.
The patient presented with a known CHF history; 2D-Echo from [**8-/2119**] showing a moderately dilated left ventricular cavity with mildly depressed LV systolic function and mid- and apical septal hypokinesis with inferior akinesis/hypokinesis (LVEF 34-50%, discrepancy with perfusion imaging and 2D-Echo).
Although his clinical picture became more concerning for a primary pulmonary process, etiologies to consider for acute diastolic CHF exacerbation: infectious (WBC 7.2, afebrile.
U/A negative, urine and blood cultures drawn and CXR showing pulmonary congestion without focal consolidation on admission (but CT imaging later showing multifocal consolidation and edema), lower extremity venous stasis changed noted) vs. dietary indiscretion vs. medication non-compliance vs. uncontrolled hypertension (unlikely) vs. worsening valvular disease (s/p MVR repair with 2+ MR noted on 2D-Echo from [**2119-8-26**]) vs. ACS/MI (EKG stable, Troponin 0.02) vs. Bactrim interacting with his heart failure medications vs. progression of restrictive lung disease (PFTs showing restrictive ventilatory defect).
He was placed on a Lasix gtt and has had adequate diuretic response with minimal oxygenation improvement on his ABGs.
Therefore he required intubation (see above).
We decreased his diuresis goal to even or 0.5L daily given the suspicion of a primary pulmonary process.
We attempted to maintain his home heart failure regimen, but held many of his medications given his diastolic dysfunction and hypotension.
We intermittently dosed IV Lasix for diuretic effect given his diastolic failure.
# CORONARIES - The patient presented with 3-vessel coronary artery disease status post-CABG in [**2091**] and a re-do in [**2099**] (SVG-LAD, SVG-OM1), PCI with LCx proximal Cypher stent in [**2110**] ??????
stress testing with myocardial perfusion imaging [**2119-9-1**] showing stable moderate predominantly fixed defect in the inferior, inferolateral walls and apex with inferior wall hypokinesia and an LVEF of 34% with no anginal symptoms on stress testing.
Troponin 0.02 (times 2-sets) in the setting of renal insufficiency, CK-MB 3.
He was initially continued on his home Aspirin dosing, but this was discontinued given the concern for DAH.
His statin medication was continued.
# RHYTHM - The patient has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and is status-post ablation in [**2114**], with placement of a biventricular device and ICD previously.
For his atrial fibrillation, his CHADs-2 score is 6 and Coumadin and Aspirin were utilized at home.
Given his 2 prior ischemic stroke events, we judiciously held anticoagulation when his INR dropped below 2, but his bleeding concerns were more of an issue at the time.
His Coumadin was resumed on [**2119-11-14**] after his INR and coagulopathy had normalized and his diffuse alveolar hemorrhage concerns subsided.
Patient presented on Coumadin for chronic atrial fibrillation with a supratherapeutic INR of 10.1 given his recent initiation of sulfa drug (Bactrim) for presumed lower extremity cellulitis vs. chronic venous stasis changes.
His INR was serially trended and improved following administration of vitamin K and FFP while holding his anticoagulation.
Given the concern for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (see above), his anticoagulation was held, we transfused him 2 units of packed red cells for a HCT of 21%, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma for INR reversal and dosed 5 mg of PO Vitamin K. An active type and screen with adequate IV access was maintained at all times.
Hematology was consulted and felt that marrow suppression was most likely, but other factors were contributing, such as low iron utilization in the setting of chronic renal insufficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia and active infection.
His electrolytes were closely monitored, his creatinine was trended and we avoided nephrotoxic medications and renally dosed his medications.
He has evidence of chronic venous stasis changes of the lower extremity; was started on Clindamycin and then Bactrim by his PCP for presumed [**Name9 (PRE) 24093**] MRSA coverage and lower extremity cellulitis vs. erysipelas.
At home, has been on Hydralazine, Isosorbide mononitrate and Spironolactone.
His Hydralazine was held given concerns for vasculitis, and his aldosterone antagonist was held given concerns for hyperkalemia initially.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA - We continued him on Simvastatin 40 mg PO daily.
# GERD - We continued Ranitidine 150 mg PO daily intially, but this was switched to Protonix 40 mg IV daily in the setting of guiac positive stools.
An H pylori antigen returned positive, however after discussion with his PCP and gastroenterologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**], we decided against triple therapy as the risks of infection outweighed the benefit of treatment.
# NUTRITION - On day 3 of intubation, while the patient remained NPO, we started Isosource tube feeds for a goal rate of 45 cc/hr given Nutrition's recommendations, which he tolerated well.
Heparin bridge to coumadin (goal INR [**12-29**]) for a fib with RVR (per his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 24094**] he should be on lifelong anticoaggulation.
