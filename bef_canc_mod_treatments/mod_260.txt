Both of these etiologies were treated, and he continued to oxygenate and ventilate well on his usual ventilator settings.
The end result of these discussion was that the patient's wishes would not be consistent with this new level of functioning from which he had little hope of recovery; the family decided to make him comfort measures only.
He was disconnected from the ventilator and all medications beyond a morphine drip were stopped, and he expired shortly thereafter.
