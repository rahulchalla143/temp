Stable appearance of left parieto-occipital encephalomalacia with associated ex vacuo dilatation of the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] consistent with remote infarction.
The background remained of low voltage throughout the recording, with similar frequencies in all areas, generally indicating medication effect.
The tip of the endotracheal tube and side port are below the gastroesophageal junction.
The endotracheal tube tip is at the level of the clavicular heads, 6 cm above the carina.
Femoral catheter is seen with distal lead tip projecting over the right sacral ala. On the lateral view, there are no compression deformities.
Feeding tube is seen with the distal tip and side port below the gastroesophageal junction.
Brief Hospital Course: # SEIZURES: EEG in the ED showed seizures, so the patient received 3 mg lorazepam and 1 g Keppra and was admitted to the epilepsy service.
In the MICU, the patient was intubated and given phosphenytoin, Keppra, and Vimpat, along with a midazolam gtt for refractory seizures.
She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible meningitis.
Seizures stopped on [**2167-5-23**] and the patient was weaned off the midazolam drip on [**2167-5-24**].
She was continued on phenytoin 100 mg PO TID, lancosamide 200 mg IV BID, and Keppra 1500 mg PO BID.
# FEVER/POSSIBLE MENINGITIS: As above, the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftriaxone) plus acyclovir for possible meninigtis.
However, ID eventually recommended leaving the baclofen pump and discontinuing antibiotics as low level WBC in the pump fluid and negative culture suggested against hardware infection.
Antibiotics were discontinued on [**2167-5-27**] and the patient remained afebrile through the remainder of the hospital course.
# SPASTICITY: The patient has spasticity in all extremities, legs greater than arms, secondary to hemorrhagic parieto-occipital stroke in [**2158**], s/p baclofen pump placement in [**2159**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 54184**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 174**] ([**Hospital1 2177**] orthopedics - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94375**] or pager [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94376**]).
He mentioned that the first sign of baclofen withdrawal (if the pump malfunctions) is itching without rash and if this happens to use ativan IV and not PO baclofen, and that this is a medical emergency as withdrawal can precipitate seizures.
The patient was kept on a bowel regimen and the constipation resolved.
PENDING RESULTS: [**2167-5-23**] BCx [**2167-5-24**] CSF from baclofen pump EEG final read [**2167-5-27**]  TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: Patient will need to be followed to ensure that she does not have any fevers now that she is off of her vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
If she spikes, she should be started on menigitic dose of vancomycin and ceftriaxone and sent to the Emergency Department.
