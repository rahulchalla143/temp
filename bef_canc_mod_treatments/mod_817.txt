These can be further evaluated on ultrasound or MRCP.
A stent was placed.
nuclear medicine scan for detection of additional lesions and MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] for complete assessment.
Additional probable superimposed consolidation and changes of aspiration pneumonitis at the left lung base.
A pigtail catheter in a left lobe abscess has been partially withdrawn and now side holes are located outside of the collection.
Moderate left-sided hydronephrosis with ileal conduit in place.
Continued attention on followup imaging recommended.
Interval increase in the small amount of perihepatic ascites as well as bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
Persistence of the air-containing fluid collection in the pelvis with suspected communication with bowel.
He was resuscitated with IVF and required three pressors on admission (vasopressin, norepinephrine and phenylephrine).
A stent was placed.
He was started vancomcyin and pip/tazo.
As described below, CT also showed liver abscesses which were drained by IR and required repeat drainage and catheter placement given reaccumualtion.
Repeat drainage with catheter placement occurred on [**2194-9-24**].
LIVER ABSCESSES: Multiple hypodensities seen in the left lobe of the liver on CT were concerning for abscesses.
A ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage of two of the abscesses was pursued on [**2194-9-16**] and showed frank pus (see report for further details of anatomy; no cytology sent due to low volume of aspirate).
Repeat drainage with catheter placement occurred on [**2194-9-24**] and drains were left in place.
Twenty-four hours after drains pulled pt transitioned from IV zosyn to PO cipro/flagyl per ID recs.
Stayed on this regimen until [**10-22**] when Abx switched to amoxicillin/clavulonic acid due to developing neutropenia and concern for antibiotic toxicity as the cause.
Pt to continue these PO antibiotics to complete 4-6 weeks of therapy.
He remained intubated with two unsuccessful attempts at extubation.
He was weaned to 2L nasal cannula without incident.
Pt then developed a hospital acquired pneumonia and required brief re-intubation in setting of acute respiratory distress.
Only stayed intubated for a brief period of time and then was successfully extubated.
He did not have further respiratory issues during the hospitalization and was quickly weaned off oxygen to room air.
He was loaded with amiodarone and rate-controlled with metoprolol.
He still had episodes of tachycardia to the 120's in atrial flutter and repeat cardioversion was planned.
However, in the setting of GI bleed and concern over dangers of any anticoagulation, the electrophysiology service elected to not perform either cardioversion or flutter ablation.
He was resuscitated with IV fluids and transferred back the MICU.
This was done on showing gastritis, duodenitis, and an area of anal fissure.
The stomach and intestine were attributed as the most likely sources of the bleeding.
Pt continued to have large volume stool output through his ostomy and was started on loperemide and metamucil to reduce this output.
He was started on coumadin for his atrial flutter and his INR increased to 4.1.
He then had BRBPR as above and his INR was reversed with FFP and vitamin K. Coagulation parameters normalized but the decision was made not to further anticoagulate him acutely [**2-4**] to the GI bleed.
This was attributed to the anal fissures which had been noted on colonoscopy and as a result of this second episode of bleeding decision was made to hold even anticoagulation with aspirin for pt's afib/aflutter until pt stable as an outpatient.
His gap closed with treatment of underlying infection.
Because of the temporal relation to the initiation of these two medications and no other medication addtions, neutropenia was attributed to medication cause and antibiotics switched to augmentin.
HIT work-up was negative and falling plts were deemed [**2-4**] to PPI so this mediation was stopped and H2 blocker started as GI bleed prophylasix.
ADDITIONAL ITEMS IN NEED OF OUTPT FOLLOW-UP:  1) CALCIFIED GALLBLADDER: Noted on CT ABD.
This collection showed more organization than on previous scans, but has been present since [**2193**].
