He vomits up any food that he has eaten, even up to 6 hours prior, but has been able to keep liquids and his medications down.
He says he has been taking all of his medications on time and as directed, and has not been eating outside of his home or had any unusual or poorly cooked meals.
He has a multi-resistant  virus, due to serial monotherapy in the early [**2142**]'s and some  adherence problems thereafter.
[**Name2 (NI) **] is currently on a regimen of  atazanavir 300 mg/day boosted by ritonavir 100 mg/day,  emtrictabine 200 mg/day, tenofovir 300 mg/day, and zidovudine 300  mg po bid.
His last CD4 count in [**12/2157**] was 126, with a  corresponding viral load that was undetectable.
In [**6-12**], he started radiation therapy  with chemotherapy for augmentation (5- fluorouracil and cisplatin).In early [**11/2157**], he had an antrior/posterior resection of the primary tumor.
This was initially treated with dietary  intervention.

He had some cosmetic surgery at the age of 18 to correct a scar on his head sustained in some childhood head trauma.

Brief Hospital Course: A/P 73 yo male with AIDS, DM2, invasive carcinoma of the anorectal canal s/p resection and diverting colostomy [**11-12**] presented with vomiting and and intermittent RLQ pain.
The operation was made much more challenging by the existence of radiation changes in his pelvis after treatment for anal cancer.
On [**3-30**], he developed gross hematuria, and a Urology consult recommended a cystoscopy.
His surgery on [**4-5**] consisted of an ex lap and construction of an ileocolic bypass.
Although he was clearly improved, it was felt he would be unable to support himself nutritionally, and a Dobhoff feeding tube was placed on [**4-25**] and he was placed on Ultracal 1/2strength without fiber at 30cc/h.
It is our belief that he can successfully wean off the TPN and onto regular food.
