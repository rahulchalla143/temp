On [**2182-12-27**], the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times two with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal artery.
The surgery was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 53911**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **]) as assistants.
This surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with a cardiopulmonary bypass time of approximately 112 minutes and a cross-clamp time of 88 minutes.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit with two arterial and two ventricular pacing wires.
The patient was placed on dobutamine, Levophed, and propofol drips.
By postoperative day one, the patient was weaned of his dobutamine but remained on Levophed which was titrated to correct a systolic blood pressure in the 80s.
The patient was also restarted on his digoxin and placed on Neo-Synephrine.
The patient continued to do well from a respiratory standpoint and was gently weaned off his ventilatory support and eventually extubated on [**12-29**].
This was done without any difficulty, and the patient was placed on nasal cannula at 4 liters and was able to maintain an oxygen saturation of greater than 98%.
The patient's insulin drip was quickly weaned to off, and the patient was started on a heparin drip due to his chronic atrial fibrillation.
By the end of the day, the patient was completely off the Neo-Synephrine.
The patient was started on Lasix and achieved a moderate amount of diuresis.
The patient continued to be on a heparin drip at 600 units per hour.
The Foley catheter was removed on this day.
The emesis was maroon in color with coffee-grounds appearance.
The patient was placed on a proton pump inhibitor and scheduled for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
The patient was advised to continue high doses of the proton pump inhibitor.
The patient was advised to undergo a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy following his discharge.
The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation and was started on beta blockade.
The patient was taken off his digoxin but continued with the beta blockade.
By postoperative day eight, the patient was started on his by mouth diet following his bout of gastritis.
The patient was restarted on a heparin drip at 500 cc per hour for his atrial fibrillation.
The patient continued to be followed by Physical Therapy and was making slow but steady progress.
Cardiac enzymes were sent which revealed a transient increase of his creatine kinase value to 45 and his troponin to 0.39.
Recommendations from Neurology indicated that the patient may be suffering from a toxic/metabolic cause due to the waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] of his symptoms.
A repeat complete blood count, Chemistry-10, liver function tests (including albumin and ammonia), and thyroid-stimulating hormone were sent.
Per their recommendations was placed on thiamine, folate, and a multivitamin.
The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation, but his blood pressure was holding steady with peak systolic blood pressures of approximately 110 to 120.
The patient had been placed on Coumadin for several days and was at therapeutic levels.
It was felt that the patient was stable to be discharged to home with further continuation and recovery of his cardiac surgery along with outpatient Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy.
His sternal wound was clean, dry, and intact only with Steri-Strips present.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4469**] was also contact[**Name (NI) **] prior to the patient's discharge, and he stated that he would be able to follow the patient's INR and Coumadin dosing.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient's condition on discharge was good; the patient was afebrile, ambulating independently, pain well controlled on oral medications, and tolerating a regular diet without difficulty.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq by mouth twice per day (times seven days).
Colace 100 mg by mouth by mouth twice per day as needed (for constipation).

The patient was further instructed to take a dose on [**1-11**] and [**1-12**] of 5 mg of Coumadin each.
Atenolol 25-mg tablets one tablet by mouth every day.
Status post coronary artery bypass grafting times two (with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal).
