Also on [**6-16**] she pulled out her PICC line and since then she has not recieved TPN.
Chief Complaint: Severe pancreatitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Percutaneous Tracheostomy PICC Line Placement.
Her ALT was 380, AST 514, T bili 1.1, Alk phos 242, amylase 2960, lipase 3990, and she was  admitted to [**Hospital1 **] ICU with a presumed diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis.
She received 2L NS bolus and her UOP remained low (15-30 cc/hr).
This follow-up CT with contrast confirms the prior impression that most of the pancreas is replaced by a necrotic fluid collection.

There is an endotracheal tube in place.
There are bilateral subclavian IV lines with tips in the proximal IVC and left brachiocephalic vein.
There is a feeding tube with distal tip within the fourth portion of the duodenum.
PELVIC CT:  The bladder is not distended with Foley catheter in its interior.
Stable appearance of severe pancreatitis with inflammatory phlegmon/fluid within the neck and body of the pancreas with retained enhancement of head and tail of pancreas and no new gas  collections.CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2187-5-9**] 3:28 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: eval pleural effusions/ pneumonia  [**Hospital 5**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 66 year old woman w/ pancreatitis, eval for pleural effusions/ pneumonia REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval pleural effusions/ pneumonia AP CHEST, 3:49 A.M., [**5-9**]  HISTORY: Pancreatitis, evaluate for effusions and pneumonia.

NASOINTESTINAL TUBE PLACEMENT UNDER FLUOROSCOPY: A feeding tube was advanced via the right nostril under fluoroscopic visualization to the fourth portion of the duodenum with approximately 5 cc of water soluble contrast administered via the tube to confirm placement.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 8 French [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] feeding tube into fourth portion of the duodenum.
TECHNIQUE: After administration of oral contrast, MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images through the abdomen, followed by IV contrast-enhanced images through the abdomen and pelvis.
The nasogastric tube can be seen coursing into the fourth portion of the duodenal.
A Foley is seen in the collapsed bladder and a rectal tube is seen.
Mesenteric fat necrosis also appears mildly improved.

She was found to have high fevers and was tachycardic,  she was started on empiric antibiotics for pancreatitis.
Per surgery, it is unlikely infected, at present, fevers may be due to cytokine release.
A operation was deferred at present and can be readdressed later if persistent fevers occur without a source.
She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 3 weeks to discuss cholecystectomy and another CT scan to see any interval changes before her follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The NGT was left in place and TPN started.
Next, a Dobbhoff was placed and trophic tube feedings were started and she was tolerating them fine.
A rectal tube was placed for liquid stool.
A new tube was inserted.
She was seen by Speech and Swallow after her tracheostomy was downsized and passed a speech  and swallow evaluation.
[**5-30**], a PICC was placed and TPN started after her Dobbhoff was self D/C'd.
[**6-16**] She pulled out her PICC line and the TPN has been stopped since then.
We are going to see how she does with out TPN and see if she will take enough calories by mouth.
She was on Vanco and Zosyn for PNA.
She was on Metoprolol and Enalapril  for HR and BP control.
[**Month (only) 412**] develop pulmonary edema as a result of her fluid resuscitation and require intubation.
CHF in setting of aggressive volume repletion, interstitial infiltrates  on CXR, BNP 1305.
A tracheostomy was placed on [**2187-5-10**].
She had a prolonged intubation and was weaned off the ventilator  on HD 30.
Passy-Muir valve was attempted with this patient, but she was unable to tolerate it.
She was suctioned and her inner cannula was removed.
She continued to do  well with the Trach and Passy-Muir and able to vocalize.
Physical Therapy After the Passy-Muir was placed and tolerable, she seemed highly  motivated to ambulate and increase daily activity.
She will continue to need physical therapy to improve functional activity,  Comm: with patient and son-in-law, [**Name (NI) **].
