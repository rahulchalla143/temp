He was placed on Flagyl, Cipro and Aztreonam.
Unfortunately he continued to spike temperatures and was hypotensive therefore he transferred to the ICU for closer management.
His antibiotics were adjusted due to his prior h/o ESBL Ecoli.
Gentamycin was added as was Vanco for MRSA coverage.
Based on an abdominal CT which was done on [**2173-9-7**] and showed multiple fluid collections, he was sent to IR on [**2173-9-2**] and had 2 drains placed and a 3rd site aspirated.
These were cultured and grew Pseudomonas, MRSA and beta Strep.
His antibiotic regimen included Clindamycin, Ciprofloxicin and Bactrim DS however on [**2173-9-7**] he had another temperature spike and was recultured.
On [**9-8**] and 21 his blood cultures were positive for enterococcus therefore his PICC line was removed.
His chest xray showed an enlarging right effusion for which he underwent thoeracentesis and he returned to Interventional Radiology for manipulation of his drains to aspirate any undrained collections.
His Bactrim was subsequently changed to Linazolid.
Final recommendations from the Infectious disease service include the continuation on Linazolid, Ciprofloxicin and Clindamycin for 14 days AFTER the drains are removed along with weekly CBC with diff, BUN Creat and LFT's.
From a nutrition standpoint, his Fibersource tube feedings were infusing at 90cc/hr over an 18 hour period however he had many interruptions in his feedings secondary to the tube either being dislodged or removed by the patient.
Due to the fact that the feeding could not be replaced until the week of [**2173-9-20**] and he was feeling better and anxious to get home, he was discharged on [**2173-9-17**] and will return for placement of the feeding tube next week.
