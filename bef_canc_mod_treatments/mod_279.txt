Ms. [**Known lastname 18995**] had an SVC obstruction which led to her having to have her R subclavian HD catheter removed today, and a R IJ tunneled HD line placed.
A stent was placed to the SVC through her R femoral vein, but had a significant amount of oozing and thus a triple lumen catheter was placed to help achieve hemostasis.
She became transiently hypotensive after receiving protamine in IR suite, but her BP responded on its own.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Type II DM ESRD on HD [**1-26**] DM2 MWF LGIB s/p cauterization/capping in ([**2-27**]) CAD, s/p NSTEMI PVD s/p R fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass ([**2172**]) & s/p R AKA; L bypass ([**2163**]).
[**6-6**] IR Procedure summary: IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a new 14.5 French 23-cm cuff-tip tunneled right internal jugular vein hemodialysis catheter with tip in the superior aspect of the right atrium.
The previously placed tunneled right subclavian hemodialysis catheter was removed.
Post-procedure, there was bleeding from each of the catheter sites likely secondary to heparin administered for an earlier performed procedure.
The effects of heparin were reduced with protamine and the bleeding stopped with the aid of manual compression.
Post-procedure changes in the right groin as described after line placement.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo F with h/o CAD, DMII, PVD, s/p IR removal of R tunneled subclavian catheter, placement of R subclavian tunneled catheter, dilation and stenting of SVC, who was transferred to MICU s/p procedure because of hypotension and 10 point hematocrit drop.
Blood loss/anemia: noted to have 10 point drop in HCT following extensive bleeding at IR procedure to HCT 24.
Received protamine after procedure to reverse heparin and DDAVP overnight for improved platelet function.
Pt has close f/u given that she is scheduled for dialysis tomorrow.
H/o afib - not on anticiagulation at home presumably due to h/o GIB.
ESRD: On HD, received one session without complication, scheduled for next session as outpt.
