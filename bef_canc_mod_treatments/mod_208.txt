MICROBIOLOGY: [**2158-2-17**] BAL: no bacterial growth, no [**Month/Day/Year 14616**], no PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] AFB, no CMV **All blood, urine, and sputum cultures were negative** .
Brief Hospital Course: 60 M w/ ESRD [**1-18**] Wegener's granulomatosis s/p kidney transplant [**4-/2154**] on tacro/cellcept, severe CAD s/p five-vessel CABG w/ PFO closure in [**2154-12-17**] and s/p multiple previous PCIs,(most recently in [**2-22**]), sCHF (EF=30%), PAF, HTN/HLD gout, and depression/anxiety p/w 3 weeks of productive cough and SOB.
# HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Mr. [**Known lastname 5850**] was admitted from the ED in respiratory distress w/ increasing O2 requirement, likely [**1-18**] post-infectious bacterial PNA given recent admission for Influenza.
There was also likely a component of volume overload that contributed to his respiratory dysfunction given IVF and antibiotics given in ED in the setting of pt's poor forward flow (CHF w/ EF~30%).
Unfortunately, during a speech and swallow evaluation the following day, he had a significant aspiration event, which shortly required reintubation secondary to respiratory distress.
He was liberated from the ventilator on [**2158-2-24**] following the placement of a large bore NG tube.
He completed a 7 day course of levofloxacin for aspiration pneumonia.
He was diuresed with lasix as needed and received nebs/mucolytics as needed.
Recommend continuation of incentive spirometry and ambulation with PT .
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Mr. [**Known lastname 18118**] baseline Cr was 2.4 as he is s/p renal transplant ([**2153**]) and his creatinine slowly increased during his admission, with Cr peak at 5.4.
The renal transplant team followed the patient closely during his hopsital course, monitoring his renal function and immunosuppression with tacrolimus and mycophenolate.
Due to a reported moderately positive ANCA sent from [**Hospital1 2025**], there was concern for recrudescence of Wegener's granulomatosis and patient underwent urgent bedside renal biopsy on [**2158-2-17**].
He was given DDVAP 1 hr prior to biopsy given uremic platelets as well as 6 units of platelets.
Cardiology was consulted to determine whether patient could safely go off [**Date Range **]/[**Date Range **] for biopsy but given pt's multiple cardiac risk factors and severe CAD, he was kept on [**Date Range **]/[**Date Range **], with only SC heparin being held for the biopsy.
All medications were renally dosed.
He should continue sodium bicarbonate supplementation.
Prior records show that he was initially anticoagulated on Coumadin until [**2153**] when it was discontinued due to severe epistaxis requiring transfusions as well as difficulty controlling his INR.
Pt's rate was initially controlled on home metoprolol 150mg [**Hospital1 **] but he frequently was tachycardic in atrial fibrillation and required some additional IV lopressor.
On [**2-18**] he was changed to 100mg metoprolol q6h, which helped somewhat, and he was also loaded with amiodarone on [**2-22**], with a significant improvement in his rate control.
His cardiologist, Dr.[**Name (NI) **], was contact[**Name (NI) **] for advice on continuing the amiodarone and a formal cardiology consult was initated.
Additionally, he was started on a heparin drip for bridge to coumadin given stroke (see below).
He will be discharged on amiodarone 200 mg daily and metoprolol 100 mg q6.
Neurology felt that the source of the infarct was likely embolic and he was started on a heparin gtt/coumadin.
He will be discharged on coumadin with INR goal 2.0 - 3.0 and should continue to have coag panel monitored .
A flexiseal was placed to help protect his skin from breakdown given his volume of stool.
Transplant surgery recommended a CT scan which revealed that the hematoma was actually an abdominal wall hematoma with concern for active bleeding from R inferior epigastric artery.
Due to a drop in Hct, the patient was taken for IR embolization on [**2158-2-28**].
He tolerated the procedure well without complication.
His heparin gtt/coumadin was held for the procedure and was restarted 4 hours after the procedure per IR recs.
[**Date Range **] and aspirin were continued throughout his hospital stay.
He received IV lasix for diuresis while in the unit and was transitioned to his home dose of lasix.
Lisinopril was held given his renal issues described above.
Nifedipine was initially held and was gradually re-introduced at a low dose.
He should be seen by cardiology for further medication adjustments and consideration of cardiac rehab in the future.
Haldol was started and will be continued at discharge per recommendatino of the accepting facility.
