Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 56 year old male with hepatitis C cirrhosis/HCC s/p liver transplant ([**2156**]) with recurrent decompensated hepatitis C cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, diabetes mellitus type II, who was admitted for acute on chronic low back pain and was found to have coag-negative staph bacteremia and L2-3 discitis / osteomyelitis.
# GPC Bactermia: He has had several prior episodes of bacteremia requiring removal of his HD catheter.
Blood culture from his HD line on [**2161-12-2**] grew coag negative staph.
His HD catheter was removed on [**2161-11-5**] after an early HD session.
ID was consulted and recommended an 8 week antibiotic course.
He was treated with Vancomycin following HD protocol from [**2161-11-4**] through [**2161-11-11**] without clearing the bacteremia, at which point he was switched to Daptomycin.
His Daptomycin dose was increased from 500 mg Q48H to 650 mg Q48H on [**2161-11-19**] per ID recs for 8 week course to be completed with last dose on [**2162-1-7**] per ID.
A new tunneled HD catheter was placed on [**2161-11-20**].
Lumbar spine MRI with contrast on [**2161-11-27**] showed increased collapse of the superior endplate of L3 and an epidural soft tissue mass spanning L2 and L3, which most likely reflects a phlegmon and causes moderate to severe canal encroachment.
He received dialysis immediately after the MRI study and again the next day.
His PICC line was pulled and the tip sent for culture.
His HD line was pulled on [**2161-11-28**] after dialysis.
Ortho Spine was consulted regarding the possible need for surgical debridement of the phlegmon.
# Left Flank Erythema: He had significant leakage from a prior paracentesis site noted on [**2161-11-17**] with some flank swelling from subcutaneous fluid.
The itching is fairly well controlled with Sarna lotion.
A Pain Service consult was called and did not believe that a procedural intervention would be helpful, though TENS may be useful as an outpatient.
His back pain on [**2161-11-21**] was significantly worse after walking to the bathroom and he required additional pain meds for the first time in many days.
His Oxycontin dose was increased to 20 mg PO BID on [**2161-11-24**].
His initial MS changes were most likely due to medication effects (received Dilaudid 1 mg IV and Lorazepam 3 mg IV total over 24 hours for back pain).
He was continued on his home regimen of Lactulose and Rifaximin for most of his stay.
# ESLD:  He was transplanted in [**2156**] for HCV cirrhosis, with subsequent HCV recurrence and cirrhosis of the transplanted liver.
He was continued on Pantoprazole and Propranolol per his home regimen.
# Liver Transplant History:  He was previously on Tacrolimus 0.5 mg PO BID.
# Adrenal Insufficiency: He has a history of adrenal insufficiency and is on chronic Hydrocortisone 10 mg PO QAM and 5 mg PO QHS.
He did not require stress dose steroids during this admission, though it was considered initially.
# Diabetes mellitus, type II:  He was previously well controlled on his home regimen of NPH 55 units [**Hospital1 **] and Humalog sliding scale.
# ESRD: He is usually on a MWF hemodialysis schedule.
He had an early session on [**2161-11-5**] prior to HD catheter removal and an HD holiday.
He was started on Calcitriol on [**2161-11-5**] based on his elevated PTH level of 135 from [**2161-11-4**].
His phosphate levels have been mildly elevated, and he was started on Sevelamer 800 mg PO TID.
He was also started on Nephrocaps.
A new tunneled HD catheter was placed on [**2161-11-20**].
With his recurrent bacteremia on [**2161-11-24**], his new tunneled catheter was pulled on [**2161-11-28**].
He has tolerated the disruptions in his dialysis schedule well, without any significant problems.
[**Name (NI) 3003**] to spine surgery, patient had temporary line placed on [**2161-12-7**] and received dialysis on [**2161-12-7**] and [**2161-12-8**].
# Depression: Paroxetine was continued per his home regimen.
# Nutrition: He was kept on a low sodium, diabetic diet.
After his HD catheter was pulled, he was temporarily placed on a more restrictive diet.
PO intake was encouraged and he was provided Ensure supplements and Beneprotein with meals.
He was seen by Nutrition who recommended Dobbhoff placement and initiation of tube feeds which he tolerated well.
SICU course: Patient underwent spine surgery for debridement of L2-L3 osteomyelitis on [**2161-12-9**].
Difficulty weaning off ventilator for one week due to fluid overload.
Received CVVH but eveually transitioned to HD.
Post-pyloric Dubhoff tube placed.
Treated empirically with Zosyn for VAP.
Post-pyloric Dubhoff placed and tubefeeds initiated.
Wound culture from spine grew Coagulase negative Staphylococcus resistent to daptomycin, switched to linezolid at ID recommendation.
Placed on hydrocortisone given known adrenal insufficiency.
He was continued on linezolid and ciprofloxacin was started empirically for SBP prophylaxis.
Therapeutic and diagnostic paracentesis were performed.
There was a pararenal collection of fluid which was drained and culture negative.
Multiple paracentesis were negative for infection, but given continual leukocytosis, fever, and mental status changes, patient was kept on linezolid, ceftriaxone, and po vancomycin for broad spectrum coverage.
Patient was continued on dialysis.
He worked with physical therapy to regain strength and made minimal progress.
Linezolid was d/c'd for possible association with lactic acidosis and was changed to tigecycline for SBP coverage.
He was started on CVVH on [**1-10**] after transfer and the lactate improved to 5.6.
He needed to be intubated for the EGD and was kept intubated for aspiration risks given the amounts of blood in the stomach.
On [**1-12**] a postpyloric dobhoff feeding tube was placed.
