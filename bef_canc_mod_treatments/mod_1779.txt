Mr. [**Known lastname **] was started on amiodarone in the setting of atrial fibrillation.
The amiodarone was discontinued after he converted back to sinus rhythm, and he was not discharged on amiodarone.
We made this decision because 1) his atrial fibrillation only occurred in the setting of pneumonia, and 2) we did not want to continue a medication with potential pulmonary complications given his already significantly compromised pulmonary reserve.
