HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft and mitral valve prosthetic replacement, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who presents with shortness of breath progressive over the past four days after undergoing a transesophageal echocardiogram several days prior to admission.
He denies chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, rhinorrhea or sore throat.
In the Emergency Department the patient received Atrovent and Albuterol nebulizers times three, Solu-Medrol, aspirin and Lasix 40 po.
Coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in [**2189**], coronary artery bypass graft times four in [**State 108**] in [**2189**].
Mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve in [**2189**].
Bilateral carotid stenosis status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent to the left ICA.
Aspirin 81 once a day.
Vitamin C. 4.
Nexium 40 twice a day.
Simvastatin 20 once a day.
Lasix 40 once a day.
Prednisone 10 once a day.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare:  The patient was treated with nebulizer and intravenous steroids.
Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm with thrombus as noted on transesophageal echocardiogram.
Mitral valvular regurgitation with mild paravalvular leak:  CT surgery was consulted and they did not advise any acute intervention.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient did not have evidence of ischemia by history or electrocardiogram, but he was ruled out for a myocardial infarction by enzymes and he was continued at this point on his aspirin and statin as beta-blocker was held, because of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of his respiratory failure.
Anemia and blood loss:  As noted the patient had a history of gastrointestinal bleed on anticoagulation in the past and had a slew of heme positive stools, melena and hematocrit drop, which required approximately one unit of packed red blood cells per day for several days to maintain his hematocrit above 28.
He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy with push enteroscopy on [**2193-5-1**].
No interventions were undertaken.
GI's recommendation was that if the patient continued to have a stable hematocrit over time consideration could be given to restarting anticoagulation with the risk that he may bleed again.
It was felt that Linezolid was the culprit.
He was continued on his Amiodarone and Digoxin.
The Amiodarone was decreased from 400 b.i.d.
He will continue on the Digoxin 0.125 q.d.
He is not anticoagulated at this time given his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, though he obviously remains at risk for clot given his known left ventricular thrombus, known left superficial femoral vein deep venous thrombosis status post IVC filter and his atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure with an EF of 35% on his echocardiogram on [**2193-4-10**]:  The patient was diuresed with Lasix 40 mg intravenously b.i.d.
The day prior to discharge he was switched to a more stable regimen of Lasix 40 po and Aldactone 25 po.
We feel that he may have several more pounds of fluid to come off with a gentle diuresis over the next week and he should certainly not become fluid positive at this time.
Diuresis was slowed just because his bicarbonate had creeped up to 38 though his BUN and creatinine had remained relatively stable at 34 and 1.1.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient is on a Prednisone taper from his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
Left superficial femoral deep venous thrombosis:  The patient has an IVC filter in place, but as noted above is not on anticoagulation given his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient is continued on his statin and ace inhibitor.
Diabetes mellitus type 2:  The patient is controlled in the hospital on NPH and a regular insulin sliding scale.
Carotid stenosis:  The patient is status post left carotid stent.
FEN:  The patient has been on a cardiac and [**Doctor First Name **] diet, however, he certainly could use nutritional consultation and supplementation given his low albumin of 2.6 recently and his mild whole body edema.
Access:  The patient is a very difficult to place an IV in and has a right double lumen PICC line in place.
Please check daily weights and adjust diuretic regimen accordingly.
Adhere to a 2 gram sodium diet.
You should have your Digoxin level checked in one week.
You should have your hematocrit and platelets checked in three days.
You should have your potassium and chem 7 checked in three days as you have recently started on Spironolactone.

Nexium 20 mg po b.i.d.
Prednisone 10 mg q.d.
Spironolactone 25 mg q.d.
Lasix 40 mg q.d.
Insulin NPH 20 units q.a.m.
