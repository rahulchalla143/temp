Admission Date:  [**2169-1-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-1-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-6-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: sudden cardiac arrest; ventricular fibrillation arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None this hospitalization  History of Present Illness: This is a 59 year-old Male with a PMH significant non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (cardiac MRI showing dilated LV with mild-to-moderate global systolic dysfunction, EF 42%, mild MR in [**2165**]), HLD, known LBBB who was in bed this morning at 7:45 AM and his wife noted him to be unresponsive with agonal breathing.
He was intubated (had spontaneous respirations, dilated pupils, rechecked at 3-4 mm) and sedated with a Propofol gtt.
Propofol gtt was continued.
A Dopamine gtt was started given some SBP in the 70-80 mmHg range.
He was given Fentanyl 250 mg IV x 1 and Rocuronium 50 mg IV x 1.
He was also given Amiodarone 300 mg IV x 1.
Prior to in-flight arrival, he received an additional 200 mg of IV Fentanyl, Midazolam 2 mg IV and Rocuronium 60 mg IV x 1.
Given these findings, he was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Electrophysiology clinic, and he recommended repeating a 2D-Echo, which was done in [**8-/2167**] and showed an LVEF of 40-45% and thus ICD placement was deferred at that time.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient arrived on cooling protocol and was minimally responsive given sedation and paralyzation.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope.
They deny bleeding at the time of prior procedures or surgeries.
Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (cardiac MRI showing dilated LV with mild-to-moderate global systolic dysfunction, EF 42%, mild MR in [**2165**]; cardiac catheterization in [**2165**] was without coronary disease) 2.
Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 59M with a PMH significant for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (cardiac MRI showing dilated LV with mild-to-moderate global systolic dysfunction, EF 42%, mild MR in [**2165**]), HLD, known LBBB who is status-post sudden cardiac arrest (with undetermined rhythm) who had ROSC after shocks and CPR who is now intubated, sedated, paralyzed and on a hypothermia protocol, and is now hemodynamically stable.
Etiologies for sudden cardiac arrest included ACS versus arrhythmia, enzymes flat and EKG with LBBB but not meeting criteria for ACS.
The Artic Sun cooling protocol continued for 18-hours and then the patient was rewarmed without issues.
We also started Aspirin, Atorvastatin and Metoprolol given the concern for acute coronary syndrome; but ultimately his cardiac biomarkers were reassuring and he had no new wall motion abnormalities on 2D-Echo so atorvastatin was discontinued and his aspirin was lowered to 81mg.
He received an Amiodarone load of 300 mg IV at the outside hospital, but this was not continued on arrival to the CCU.
His CTA chest was negative for pulmonary embolus and his heparin gtt was discontinued.
A 48-hour EEG was continued per post-arrest protocol and showed no evidence of epileptiform foci, only moderate global encephalopathy.
Following his rewarming protocol, sedation was weaned off, he awoke and was extubated on [**2169-1-25**] without issues.
He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Electrophysiology clinic, and he recommended repeating a 2D-Echo, which was done in [**8-/2167**] and this showed an LVEF of 40-45% and thus ICD placement was deferred at that time.
He has been managed as an outpatient with ACEI and beta-blocker.
We started Metoprolol and titrated this to control his heart rate; we discontinued his home Carvedilol dose.
We started Atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily given concern ACS/MI.
His lipid panel was overall reassuring and ultimately atorvastatin was discontinued as it was felt that his arrest was likely related to arrhythmia rather than ACS/atherosclerosis.
