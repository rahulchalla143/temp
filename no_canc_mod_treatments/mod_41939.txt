An enteric tube traverses inferiorly into the stomach out of view.
No right-to-left shunt is seen on agitated saline injection at rest.
COPD- During hospitalization, patient's COPD was initially treated with Advair, Spiriva, and albuterol nebulizers as needed.
She was noted to become tachycardic and acutely desaturated to 70% requiring emergent intubation by anesthesia.
She was started on treatment for COPD exacerbation.
The patient was subsequently extubated, but quickly required re-intubation for respiratory distress and concern for fatigue despite PPV.
After patient's third intubation, the decision was made by the patient's daughter with the help of on-going discussions by palliative care to transition the patient to comfort measures only.
Brief outline of on-going issues during patient's hosptalization prior to be made CMO:  # GI bleed- Based upon colonoscopy at OSH, patient's ulcerated appendiceal/cecal mass was felt to be the most likely source.
She also remained hemodynamically stable and was restarted on her Metoprolol for BP control.
In spite of the fact that patient had stopped bleeding, we continued to hold her Coumadin and Plavix given that we did not have source control.
# Colonic mass- Patient's 2cm, ulcerated appendiceal/cecal mass had been biopsied during colonoscopy at OSH and pathology revealed high grade dysplasia concerning for malignancy.
GI at [**Hospital1 18**] was consulted and felt that mass could not be managed or excised with an endoscopic approach, so colorectal surgery was consulted.
Surgery was not purused given her respiratory status.
# HTN- Home antihypertensives Lisinopril and Metoprolol were held at OSH in the  setting of patient's GI bleed.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], patient was hemodynamically stable and telemetry demonstrated occasional PVC's, so Metoprolol was restarted.
#  UTI- Patient was diagnosed with a UTI at OSH.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], patient denied urinary symptoms and Levaquin was discontinued.
She was initially started on Ampicillin based on sensitivities, but this was then discontinued.
# AAA repair c/b embolism to Left Leg and Left Foot Amputation- Patient's Coumadin was held given recent GI bleed.
# CAD -  Patinet has a history of drug eluting stent placement in her RCA in [**2159**].
Presumably, her Plavix was not discontinued after stent placement but we were unable to clarify the indication for Coumadin with patient and with her outside records.
Her Plavix was held in the setting of GI bleed.
# Hypercholesterolemia- Patient's home dose of simvastatin is 70 mg daily.
While in house, she was continued on simvastating 40 mg daily.
# GERD- Patient was continued on ranitidine   Medications on Admission: Preadmissions medications listed are incomplete and require futher investigation.
