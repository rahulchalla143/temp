Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.
Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**7-/2416**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal anteroseptum, anterior wall, and distal inferior wall hypokinesis.
A right IJ tube is present, tip over distal SVC.
An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm off film.
Right groin subcutaneous hematoma, better evaluated on most recent CT. .
Brief Hospital Course: # Takotsubo's Cardiomyopathy: At an OSH, the patient developed 10mm ST elevation anterolaterally on telemetry, confirmed by 12 lead EKG (V2-V6, I, aVR) while being transferred to a chair in the ICU.
A repeat TTE showed mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with mid to distal anteroseptum, anterior wall, and distal inferior wall hypokinesis, and an EF 50-55%.
A second repeat TTE later in the hospitalization showed mild symmetric LVH, mild to moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with an EF 45% and with distal LV and apical akinesis, the remaining segments are hyperdynamic.
She was initially placed on a heparin gtt as she had increased risk of thrombus formation at the akinetic segments; however, this was discontinued after she formed a right groin hematoma later in the hospitalization (see below).
She was continued on ASA 81 daily, and started on Captopril 12.5 tid and Metoprolol 12.5 tid to help with catecholamine stress on the heart.
She will be discharged on Metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] and Lisinopril 5 mg daily.
**She was started on Lasix 40 mg PO daily for her edema, and this should be titrated to her edema and physical exam.
**Her cardiologist can consider adding back oral anticoagulation at a later date.
# Respiratory Distress: During her initial hospitalization, she would trigger for desaturations to SaO2 80% on 2 L, but she improved to 96% on 5 L. CXRs were consistent with volume overload with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Her O2 requirement was weaned down to 1 L by the time of discharge.
She received multiple doses of Lasix 40 IV to keep 1 L negative over the day.
She was continued on ASA 81 daily and Atorvastatin 10 mg daily.
She was started on Lisinopril 5 mg daily and Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Hypotension: On day 2 of admission to [**Hospital1 18**], she became hypotensive in the CCU into the 60s after receiving one dose of Metoprolol 12.5.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on Methylprednisolone -> Dexamethasone, and an AM cortisol was 18.2, which is low for acute infection, but the patient was on steroids.
Endocrine was curbsided, and did not think she was adrenally insufficient and recommended steroid taper.
She then triggered for hypotension on [**1-29**] secondary to a right groin hematoma (see below) in the setting of supratherapeutic PTT on heparin gtt and on a steroid taper.
Her heparin gtt, Coumadin, and ASA were discontinued at that time.
She was transiently given stress dose steroids with Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q8H while hypotensive, which was quickly changed back to her previous taper dose of Prednisone 10 mg PO x2 days.
Her beta blocker and ACE-I were held during the episode of hypotension, and have since been added back.
Her beta blocker and ACE-I were discontinued, and she was given 1 L NS without an increase in her blood pressure.
Her heparin gtt and Coumadin were discontinued as her PTT had been >150 over the previous 2 days and her INR was 2.0->5.3 on Coumadin, and there was concern for increased ecchymosis and expanding hematoma at her right cardiac catheterization site.
She was transferred back to the CCU, where she was given 5 U PRBCs, 4 U FFP, IVF NS 4 L, Phenylephrine and Norepinephrine gtt overnight, Vit K 10 SC x1, Protamine 10 IV x1, Lasix 20 IV x1 and Lasix 60 IV x1.
She received several hours of manual compression for her expanding hematoma.
Vascular surgery was consulted and thought the most likely cause of her hematoma was a ruptured pseudoaneurysm s/p catheterization in the setting of supratherapeutic INR and recent cardiac catheterization.
The patient's HCP did not wish for surgical correction of the hemorrhagic source.
She was treated at a rehab facility with moxifloxacin for the PNA and a steroid taper for the COPD.
She received 1 dose of Levaquin in the OSH ED, and her coverage was switched to Unasyn.
At the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, her antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and Zosyn when she became hypotensive with low grade fever, as there was initial concern for sepsis.
Repeat CXR showed bilateral upper lobe infiltrates as well as infiltrate in the right lung base and left retrocardiac region, concerning for a new hospital acquired pneumonia.
**She will have 1 more dose of Vanco on [**2-16**], and 2 more doses of Meropenem on [**12-8**].
# Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient is s/p ex lap and lysis of adhesions on [**1-22**] at an OSH.
She was placed on Unasyn at the OSH.
Her antibiotic coverage was advanced to Vanc/Zosyn when she became hypotensive, then changed to Vanc/Meropenem.
Surgery was consulted at [**Hospital1 18**] for her SBO, and recommended initially continuing NPO and NG decompression until passing flatus.
Her staples were removed on POD 20.
Her diet has now been advanced to regular with supplements for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
She continues to complain of [**8-4**] abdominal pain, and is being treated with Oxycontin SR and Oxycodone prn.
# Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC was persistently elevated during this hospitalization.
She was intially on steroids, with Solumedrol->Dexamethasone->a prednisone taper; however, her WBC was still high for a week after her steroid taper was discontinued.
However, C. diff negative x3 and C. diff toxin B negative, so Flagyl was discontinued.
# Hypothyroidism: The patient reported taking a thyroid medication at home, but no documentation of this was in her transfer records.
She was initially placed on Levoxyl 25 mcg daily, as we were unsure of her home dose.
After speaking with her outpatient pharmacy, it was determined that she actually takes Levoxyl 88 mcg daily.
She was started back on Levothyroxine 100 mcg daily.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued Atorvastain 10 mg daily.
# COPD:  The patient was discharged from an OSH with PNA and COPD on a steroid taper.
She was placed on Solumedrol and Dexamethasone initially in the CCU for concern for adrenal insufficiency in the setting of hypotension.
Once she improved, she was transitioned to a short prednisone taper.
She was continued on tiotropium 1 cap IH dialy, albuterol IH q6hr prn, and Advair 500-50 1 puff [**Hospital1 **].
She also had a Hct drop during her groin hematoma (see above).
**She can have iron studies rechecked as an outpatient, with consideration of uptitrating her dose to her previous regimen.
# Ulcerative Colitis: Continued Asacol 400 mg PO bid.
# GERD: Continued Protonix daily.
Psychiatry was consulted and recommended continuing her Bupropion 150 [**Hospital1 **].
Her amitryptilline was held during this hospitalization, as it was unclear what the indication was for this medication.
