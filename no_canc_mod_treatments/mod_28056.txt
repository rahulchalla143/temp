Admission Date:  [**2137-9-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-10-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-6-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ace Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: s/p cath for NSTEMI, Vfib arrest, GIB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation central line placement CVVH cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: HPI: 64yo woman with DM, HTN, ESRD on [**Hospital 58910**] transferred to the CCU service from the MICU s/p cardiac catheterization.
At the OSH, she was treated with insulin, glucose, and bicarb for hyperkalemia (6.5) and was started on an amiodarone drip.
Here, she was found to have a K of 7, and was treated with bicarb, Ca, insulin and glucose.
She was started on levophed for hypotension and was noted to have an elevated WBC with a left shift.
She had two stents placed to the mid-LAD, but during the procedure she vomited coffee-ground emesis and the catheterization was terminated.
She had an OGT placed but she chewed it and it was removed.
[**Name (NI) **] does not know any details, but said that this occurred while she was on heparin and prevented her from getting a renal tx at the time.
Past Medical History: h/o GIB in the past, as above DM not on insulin since [**5-19**] infection ESRD secondary to PCKD, with HD qMWF s/p renal transplant several years ago HTN, not medically treated since [**5-19**] infection h/o line infection [**5-19**]   Social History: Married with children  Physical Exam: On arrival in MICU: Afebrile SBP 80s-100s on pressors RR10, 100% O2 on CMV at 40% FiO2 Gen: Intubated, sedated, nonresponsive HEENT: mmm, OP benign, PERRL CV: RRR systolic murmur Resp: coarse breath sounds bilaterally anteriorly Abd: obese, NABS, soft, nondistended Ext: edematous, warm.
Left subclavian dialysis catheter, R forearm fistula (maturing), left radial arterial line, left femoral line Skin: no rash Nro: Intubated and sedated.
See Neuro note for complete exam when patient awake (prior to intubation)  Pertinent Results: **SELECTED STUDIES**  SPINE MRI: IMPRESSION: Endplate irregularity and enhancement at T7-8 level is suggestive of discitis.
Limited study consisting only of DWI and FLAIR sequences.
A focal area of non-herpetic meningitis cannot be excluded.
CXR: ([**10-7**]): A single portable chest radiograph again demonstrates an endotracheal tube with its tip at the clavicular heads.
A left-sided central venous catheter is present with its tip in the IVC.
A nasogastric tube is present with its tip in the stomach.
Retrocardiac opacity and mild pulmonary edema remain unchanged.
The patient remained persistantly hypotensive on levophed during her 2 week stay in the MICU, with the addition of vasopressin and continued hypotension.
She received antibiotics and antivrials to treat possible infections; her MRI was suggestive of HSV encephalitis although CSF cultures were negative, and only one set of sputum cultures ([**9-28**]) were positive, with no positive blood cultures.
From the first conversation, her family (husband and children) were adamant that she would not have wanted continued mechanical support and probably would not have wanted admission in the first place.
She was made DNR/DNI and, after continued discussions, CMO with withdrawal of pressor support and antibiotics.
After a time of extreme hypotension (SBPs 20s) and bradycardia, and after further discussion with her family, the ventilator was turned off and she passed away.
An MRI was suggestive of temporal lobe enhancement suggesting HSV encephalitis and the patient was maintained on acyclovir.
After her reintubation in the CCU prior to transfer to the MICU, the patient never regained a normal mental status.
Pt only on Reopro, which was stopped, ASA and plavix.
ASA and plavix were continued.
* GI Bleed - The patient had  a h/o GIB, and was on multiple meds for cath that were anticoagulants, so the GIB not surprising.
She received blood transfusion at the time and had no reoccurrance of bleeding, with a stable hematocrit.
*DM - She was monitored closely and treated with an insulin drip.
*Prophylaxis: - no sc heparin as initial GI bleeding; pneumatic boots, PPI, bowel regimen  *Communication - with husband [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 42632**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 63275**]), daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 22807**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 63276**](H), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 63277**](C))  Medications on Admission: ASA 81mg protonix lidoderm patch SSI + NPH  Discharge Medications: None  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Respiratory failure Persistant hypotension status-post Ventricular fibrillation arrest Encephalopathy with concern for herpes encephalitis Polycystic kidney disease Diabetes GI bleeding Hypertenion End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis  Discharge Condition: Expired
