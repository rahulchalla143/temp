Chest Port Line Placement   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 57-year-old female well known to Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] for multiple prior admissions, last [**2182-7-20**], for small bowel obstruction relating likely to adhesions as well as to her multiple incisional hernias which appeared to be a swiss cheese type of hernia.
Therefore consent was obtained from her attorney after reviewing the procedure with him in detail.
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and his colleague were asked to assist with the open hernia repair anticipating need for component separation as well as a mesh repair.

Findings are suggestive of acute cholecystitis; however son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name (NI) **] sign was confounded by pain medication.
However, given ground-glass appearance, a six-month followup to exclude BAC is recommended.
Therefore consent was obtained from her attorney after reviewing the procedure with him in detail.
In anticipation of the complexity of the required operation, plastic surgery was also consulted for assistance.
We elected to keep the patient intubated expecting requirement for additional fluid in particular.
She was transferred to surgical intensive care unit post-operatively for further management.
While intubated, she was sedated with propofol and fentanyl, which was then switched to precedex as a temporizing wean.
Her psychiatric medications were restarted as she was able to tolerate orals.
Immediately, post-operatively, lopressor was used and now added to her regimen for more effective management.
Hydralazine was used for additional break through relief with good effect.
Pulm: Patient has underlying COPD which made ventilator management a challenge.
CXR were taken daily to monitor for interval changes.
Several days of antibiotics were initiated for presumed pnuemonia.
Due to prolonged course, she was taken for a tracheostomy on [**2183-1-3**] by the thoracic and interventional pulmonary services.
With nebulizer and inhaler treatments for her obstructive airway disease, she was transitioned to trach mask ventilation.
She is currently still on trach mask support.
A swallow evaluation was deferred but she should be followed by speech therapy upon arrival to rehab.
Continued speech therapy intervention in rehab s/p d/c to continue monitoring her for tolerance of the PMV and to advance her to POs as able.
Remain NPO with continued tube feeds.
Pt may require a trach downsize before she can tolerate a PMV/capping.
She also had Bilateral component separation and had ventral hernia repair with placement of Prolene mesh.
Tube feeds were started when deemed appropriate and Reglan and erythromycin used to facility motility.
She is status post perc chole [**1-6**], and continues to drain draining brown, muddy bile, cipro-S e. coli on Culture.
Patient was maintained on a bowel regimen as appropriate throughout  Renal:  Patient with base line CKD became anuric in operating room.
Tunnelled HD Catheter per IR on [**1-10**].
On discharge she has a Foley in place and is making good urine.
Hemodialysis three time weekly is recommended as well as routine checking of labs.
