Name:  [**Known lastname 1028**], [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]                  Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 8367**]  Admission Date:  [**2107-10-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2081-2-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2065-7-27**]     Sex:  F  Service:  ADDENDUM:  The patient was scheduled to be transferred to [**Hospital6 8368**] on [**2107-10-21**]; however, the patient, despite the conditions of her transfer at that time, was offered the opportunity to stay at [**Hospital6 4122**] for the remainder of her IV Oxacillin therapy treatment for her methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
The patient had a PICC line to receive this; however, was not a candidate for VNA services given her history of IV drug use and was not eligible for rehab transfer given her insurance status.
The patient was educated that this is not the standard of care for the MSSA bacteremia and that any other types of treatment would not necessarily completely treat the infection that she had.
She was discharged with her medications and in place of Oxacillin was given by mouth dicloxacillin 500 mg p.o.
for the remainder of her therapy for four days.
