Once the kidney was placed, the kidney pinked up and immediately began making urine, however the kidnbey was placed intra-peritoneally as the patient had previus surgery with placement of a VP shunt so there were dense adhesions.
Patient tolerated the procedure and she was transferred to PAVCU in stable condition.
The wound started having large volume drainage, and a specimen was sent for creatinine, however this did not appear to be urine.
Output since the VAC placement has been 100-600 cc daily of sero-sanguinous drainage.
The patient was dialyzed on POD 1 for potassium elevation and has remained on routine hemodialysis since that time using a tunneled dialysis catheter.
The dilantin she was taking prior to transplant was transitioned to Keppra due to the effects of dilantin on prograf levels.
She received 5 doses af ATG for delayed graft function.
As there is no evidence of rejection the patient can be discharged with close follow up Patient was screened and accepted for rehab for mobility issues and help with VAC maintenance, hemodialysis and medication teaching.
