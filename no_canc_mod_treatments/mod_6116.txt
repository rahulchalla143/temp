Admission Date:  [**2111-9-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-10-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2026-5-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Indocin / Minocycline  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: 85 y/o M with PMH of COPD, HTN and recent admission [**8-29**] to [**2111-8-31**] with chest pressure (negative stress test) who presents after 3-4 days of recurrent intermittent chest tightness/pressure.
Saw his new cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who repeated a nuclear stress test and echo which were reportedly negative and given NTG for the chest pressure.
Troponin was negative.
Pt was having chest pressure during and after the cath and was started on nitro gtt during and post-cath.
Transferred to the floor on a nitro drip and still with intermittent chest pressure.
Pt was continuing to have ongoing chest pain, initially [**2109-12-14**] that increased to [**6-21**] despite treatment with imdur and IV morphine.
He was also given IV lopressor and started on heparin gtt.
It was unclear if the pt was going to have a CABG in the future as his PCP wanted him to be evaluated by Csurg first.
His nitro gtt was shut off, he was put in trendelenberg and given a liter of fluid, run wide open.
After a few minutes, SBP increased to 120s, pt regained color in his face and his chest pain was much relieved.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: COPD Angina (30 years ago, normal stress test, never had cardiac cath) BPH Osteoarthritis Kidney stone Bronchiectasis Herniorrhaphy in [**2077**] Appendectomy [**2041**] Cataract surgery [**2102**]  Social History: Lives with wife, worked as machinist.
Initial laboratory studies including CBC, Chem-7 and troponin were largely unremarkable.
During the procedure the patient described chest pressure.
No intervention was done and CT surgery consulted.
Started on a nitro drip which initially improved his symptoms however the pain did not resolve.
The nitro drip was uptitrated to 200mcg however the patient still described [**2110-2-13**] pain.
Given lopressor, morphine and started on a  heparin drip.
In the CCU, pt continued to have transient episodes of chest pain, but that improved upon administration of a PPI and maalox/lidocaine.
COPD - Pt was switched from albuterol to atrovent so as not to irritate/aggravate the heart with beta agonist activity.
HTN - Held home anti-hyprtensives in the setting of being on the nitro gtt, but then re-initiated on his home atenolol as the drip was shut off and his blood pressure could tolerate it.
[**Month (only) 116**] benefit from lisinopril as an outpatient.
Anxiety - Pt was continued on his home lorazepam and ambien prn.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES -- He may benefit from further BP control.
