CXR [**2130-8-20**]: The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.
The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
On the right, there are focal consolidations with some lucencies that might represent cavitary lesions and should be correlated with cross-sectional imaging.
No evidence of intramuscular abscess on this exam.
Minimal decrease in the size of mediastinal lymphadenopathy  CXR [**2130-9-11**]  In comparison with the study of [**9-9**], there are slightly lower lung volumes but little overall change in the bilateral lung abscesses.
Stomach:  Contents: A large amount of bilious fluid with mx pills was seen in the body of stomach.

Two chest tubes placed on [**8-15**] and removed on [**8-18**] prior to transfer for hypoxic respiratory failure.
She was placed on a single ventilator within two days, and then underwent bronchoscopy on [**8-24**] by IP, revealing air leakage of most major segmental bronchi which essentially precluded an endoscopic plugging of the BPF.
Thoracic surgery followed throughout the hospitalization, and intermittently applied pressure dressings to prevent air efflux.
She did require oxygen during her hospitalization, but it seems likely that there is a component of anxiety as she was satting 100% on 2L but would not allow weaning initially.
She was using ipratropium nebs intermittently during her course but was no longer using them at time of discharge.
Please see individual problems for treatment details.
RIGHT PULMONARY ABSCESS/LEFT PNEUMONIA:  She received vanco/zosyn at the OSH, and continued to receive vanco/zosyn/tobramycin for enhanced gram negative coverage.
ID was consulted for antibiotic guidance.
CT scan of chest on [**8-22**] showed marked pulmonary parenchymal damage with multifocal cavitary consolidations, ground-glass opacity and nodular opacities, all compatible with advanced infectious process.
Despite broad antibiotic coverage, she remained intermittently febrile to 102 during her ICU stay.
Antibiotics were later changed to linezolid/zosyn/ tobramycin on [**8-29**] when blood cultures grew VRE from a suspected infected femoral CVL, subsequently, zosyn/tobramycin was discontinued per ID recs and meropenem was started.
A left chest tube was placed on [**8-29**] with drainage of about 1L of fluid.
Clinical and radiographic improvement noted thereafter, with removal of the drain on [**2130-9-2**].
Her sputum culture from [**8-27**] revealed ALCALIGENES FAECALIS, which was treated with meropenem from [**Date range (1) 91431**].
She had bilateral lower extremity DVT on ultrasound following transfer as well.
She arrived and was maintained on a heparin gtt thoughout her stay, before changing to subq lovenox prior to floor transfer.
Consideration for bridging to coumadin in the future is indicated, after the patient has met with surgery and interventional pulmonary regarding her care and they have determined her need for intervention.
Vascular surgery consulted, and unroofed and evacuated the lesion on [**8-29**], clearing abundant clots.
General surgery was consulted for management, and they recommended wound care with collagenase ointment on the necrotic areas.
She requires morphine with dressing changes, we were using IV morphine because of the patient's nausea and vomiting, but recommend transition to PO and eventual discontinuation, especially given her hx of opioid abuse.
she began linezolid on [**2130-8-27**] to complete a 2 week course on [**2130-9-12**].
TPN was continued during her acute illness, with her GI tract slow to regain motility.
She was likewise slow to resume PO intake following extubation and experienced significant anxiety and nausea related to eating and pre-treatment with lorazepam and zofran did not improve her appetite.
Dobhoff was placed for tube feeds with discontinuation of TPN, however, the patient twice vomited up the Dobhoff and was unable to tolerate this.
The goal is for the patient to avoid PEG placement as she will likely regain her ability to eat orally again and should not undergo a surgery when there are alternatives.
Source of bleeding unclear, with iron studies reflecting some degree of chronic inflammation.
The patient had a low iron, of 6, which was improved with administration of IV iron.
She did not require further transfusions after she was discharged from the MICU and maintained a hematocrit of 22-24.
OPIATE DEPENDENCE:  She was on methadone 137mg daily at home, and had large sedation/narcotic requirement while intubated.
She was continued on Methadone 20mg QID while in house.
As mentioned above, a small amount of blood had been seen at OSH with NGT placement and the patient had been c/o ongoing nausea and vomiting.
H. Pylori is positive, found after the patient left, called rehab to initiate treatment and spoke to the physician caring for the patient.
No bleeding was seen on the EGD and so recommendation for continuation of Lovenox (for bilateral PEs).
- the patient can be bridged to Coumadin after she has met with interventional pulmonary and surgery regarding procedures in 2 weeks.
- the patient will need to follow up with surgery in about 2 weeks to discuss management of the areas of debridement in her LLE.
- the patient will require management per interventional pulmonary/ thoracic surgery of her fistula.
- the patient will require management of her methadone use - the patient will require psychiatric care to manage her methadone use, anxiety, depression, anorexia - encourage PO intake - taper methadone dose - follow up repeat EGD and biopsy results from gastric biopsy with GI  Medications on Admission: on transfer TPN (stopped once deemed septic), not tolerating OG feeds Ativan 2mg Q2H prn sedation Methadone 50mg daily Reglan 10mg QID Nicotine 14mg patch Protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] Zosyn 3.375mg Q6H [**7-20**] 12:41, started [**8-19**] Vancomycin 750mg Q12H 8:30, started [**8-19**] Heparin gtt 21ml /hr propofol 1.8-18mL/hr .

2. methadone 10 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO four times a day.
3. pantoprazole 20 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
5. morphine 5 mg/mL Solution Sig: Two (2) mg Injection Q12H (every 12 hours) as needed for dressing changes: use for dressing changes.

7. ondansetron 4 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: One (1) Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for nausea.
After the tubes were removed, you had a hole which was leading from inside your lung outside to your skin.
Please note the following changes to your medications: - START Lovenox - START Pantoprazole - START Collagenase ointment for your leg - START morphine for your dressing changes on your leg - START Reglan - START Zofran - AVOID NSAIDS, which are medications such as ibuprofen, naproxyn, etc.
Please be sure to keep all of your follow up appointments, including re-imaging of your lungs in about 2 weeks.
Also, please discuss transition from Lovenox to Coumadin with your physicians.
