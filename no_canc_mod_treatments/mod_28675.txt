Recently admitted [**11-3**] to [**11-6**] with chills and rigors, tap not c/w SBP however.
Vancomycin, ceftriaxone were started empirically then d/ced and sent home on SBP ppx with Bactrim and Cipro.
Albumin given, 200 cc then 50 g. Given Ceftrixone 1 g and Vanco 1 g, lactulose and rifaximin.
DM2- on glipizide 3.
Depression 5. s/p TAH 6.
Family History: no hx of liver disease, cancer, heart disease  Physical Exam: VS: 97.9, 102/74, 82, 20, 100% RA, FS 198 Gen: lethargic, but arouses to name Skin: spider telangiectasias on face, +jaundice Heent: dry mmm, icteric, PERRL, EOMI Chest: CTA no wheezing/rales CVS: nl S1 S2, RRR, no m/r/g appreciated Abd: distended, soft, +ascites, + BS, NT Ext: warm, 1+ edema in upper and lower ext, multiple eccymoses Neuro: lethargic, able to follow simple commands, oriented to self, moving all 4 ext.
Peak velocity in the distal TIPS currently 78 cm/sec (previously 120 cm/sec).
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 68 yo F with cirrhosis [**3-15**] presumed NASH, s/p large volume paracentesis on [**11-13**] presents with hypotension, hypothermia and hypoglycemia.
Patient started on D5 gtt, bolused NS with improvement.
It was felt this was due to glyburide that was recently started and its interaction with ciprofloxacin (unclear if she ever got cipro, per family) vs. bactrim (which she was definitely taking).
Her FS are now in the mid 100's off glucose drips.
Her mental status was still poor after FS normalized and was given flumazenil empirically (last dose AM of [**2192-11-19**]) as she had been given benzos one week prior for ?seizure in setting of hypoglycemia.
She was continued on home rifaxamin and lactulose doses, and after ativan wore, off her MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5348**] until d/c.
Her BP normalized with fluids and albumin.
She was started on empiric tx for HRS with midodrine and octreotide.
[**Last Name (un) **] consulted and didn't believe she was a candidate for oral hypoglycemics given liver dz.
the decision was made to allow more permissive glucose control given the risks and benefits of tight control given recent episode of hypoglycemia and her poor longterm prognosis and inability to qulaify for ongoing VNA teaching.
- she was started on lantus and HISS d/c'd prior to discharge - she was given diabetic insulin administration teaching for her family in hospital as does not qualify for VNA as well as nutrition consult for diabetes.
- She should avoid all oral hypoglycemics as well as bactrim in the future.
It is unclear if she should avoid ciprofloxacin in the future as well.
Unclear etiology, likely NASH, dependent on frequent large volume paracentesis, SBP r/out multiple times.
received 6L tap yesterday.
lactulose, rifaximin - She had a therapeutic paracentesis on [**2192-11-19**].
- restarted on diuretics 20mg lasix, with increased dose of 100mg aldactone to improve diuresis as she has had refractory ascites.
- she was not placed on SBP ppx given possible hypoglycemia induced by cipro vs. bactrim and since she has no h/o of SBP that we could identify in her chart.
- Urine Cx.
