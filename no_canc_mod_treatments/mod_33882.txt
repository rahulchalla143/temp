While in the cath lab there was residual stenosis of LM and consideration should be considered to revascularize the lesion.
Cardiothorasic surgery came by to start to discuss the possibiility of CABG in the future becasue of left main disease.
We had occupational therapy come by to assess the patient and recommedned patient have his son with him 24 hrs and have OT in outpatient settign and VNA carotid u/s came back showing FINDINGS:  There was minimal heterogeneous plaque at the proximal right ICA.
#Hypertension: Pt had hypertension when first came to the ER and was on a nitro drip briefly.
Nitro drip was weaned and while in CCU his pressures were within normal limits  # PUMP: After MI pt got an echo which showed LVEF 35-40%.
This may be because heart is still stunned after MI and this may improve somewhat in a few months.
CHRONIC ISSUES # GERD: continued home ranitidine .
#Glaucoma: continued timolol eye drops  #Mild Cognitive impairment: patient went home with VNA and will see occupational therapist.
Pt has LMCA disease and is unsure if he wants to pursue CABG and will discuss this more in the outpatient setting with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 911**].
