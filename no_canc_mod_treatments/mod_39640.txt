Cyclosporin was not restarted given her infections.
Her cholesterol was found to be elevated while her triglycerides were normal and she was started on a statin.
She should follow up with nephrology as scheduled and results of her weekly urine protein:creatinine  and serum albumin should be faxed to Dr.[**Name (NI) 433**] office.
# Leukocytosis: Total WBC normalized, but did have a bandemia that maxed at 13% prior to her 2nd surgery and then resolved following debridement of her surgical wound.
There was also some concern for abscess given recent surgery with abdominal approach and CT abdomen/pelvis showed no definitive abscess or evidence of such.
Her white blood cell count and differential should be monitored at rehab given her multiple sources of infection and treatment with linezolid.
Her PICC line was pulled and her foley changed and subsequent cultures have been negative.
Given her recent orthospine surgery and hardware, infectious disease was consulted.
Given there was no involvement of hardware on 2nd trip to the OR, ID has reccommended a 2 week course of linezolid to be completed on [**2130-3-24**].
Daily CBCs must be monitored while she is on linezolid and it should be discontinued on [**3-24**] with close monitoring following its discontinuation.

# Elevated bicarb: Elevation occurred in the setting of diuresis with IV lasix so thought to represent a contraction alkalosis.
Per renal, diamox should be discontinued at rehab when bicarb is 26-27.
Home CPAP should be reinitiated while at rehab.
# MRSA Cellulitis: She had a recent history of MRSA cellulitis and given her known VRE as above, was continued on linezolid.
Course of linezolid as above (to finish [**3-24**]).
# Osteoporosis: Most likely related to vitamin D deficiency with low vitamin 25 hydroxy D.  She has a history of several vertebral compression fractures, present since [**2116**].
Endocrine was consulted and she was started on vitamin D supplementation, calcium and calcitonin.
She will need to follow up with endocrine as an outpatient at her convenience for continued management of her osteoporosis and multiple medications for this problem.
Additionally, spinal arthritis was seen on KUB during this hospital stay.
Her pain remained well controlled with tylenol and dilaudid (used post operatively).
Throughout this hospitalization, with surgery x2, and hematoma, she received a total of 23 units of prbcs.
Additionally, erythropoeitin was initiated per renal which should be delivered qMWF.
# F/E/N: Speech & swallow evaluated her and cleared her for thin liquids and soft solids.
