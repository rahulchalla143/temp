Admission Date:  [**2168-7-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-7-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-6-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation  History of Present Illness: Patient with recent illness and admission to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for pneumosepsis, discharged home on [**2168-7-12**] to rehab at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital on vanc/cefepime with vanc scheduled to complete on [**7-21**].
The patient had initially been doing well at rehab, and according to her daughter, coming to terms with her current rehab arrangement and shortness of breath.
She was unfortunately diagnosed with c.diff colitis on [**2168-7-14**] in the setting of increased stool output and was started on oral vancomycin.
2 days ago on [**7-19**] the patient was noted to have acute worsening of her mentation following feeding, which was normally alert and verbal to be found complaining of shortness of breath, despite having normal oxygen saturations - she was found to have hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and anemia - she was treated for all three including transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs and subsequently underwent suctioning with transient improvement in her mental status.
The next day, [**7-20**], the patient was noted to have similar symptoms but even worsening mental status requiring from the rehab area to the intensive care unit as she had a diminished mental status and was being ventilated with a bag-valve mask.
She was seen and evaluated by neurology who recommended volume expansion for possible dysautonomic crisis.
She was also started on an ativan drip at 0.5mg per hour which was discontinued around 8am on [**7-21**].
Labs were drawn, a CXR was ordered, and a neurology consult was ordered who initially recommended MRI/MRA of the head and neck.

MRI/MRA BRAIN AND NECK WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2168-7-22**]): 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 year old woman with a history of C5/C6 [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 39850**] status post cervical decompression surgery 1 year ago, trach collar dependent, admitted with encephalopathy and [**Last Name (un) **].
Neurology was consulted and recommended MRI/MRA head which ruled out stroke.
24-hour video EEG showed generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDs) superimposed on encephalopathic slowing, but no explicit seizures.
She was started on Keppra which was uptitrated to 750mg PO BID.
Based on her presentation with acute renal failure, it was felt that she likely developed renal failure due to vancomycin toxicity, which caused accumulation of psychoactive meds including Baclofen, Tizanidine, Morphine, Tramadol and Gabapentin resulting in toxic/metabolic encephalopathy as well as some uremic encephalopathy.
All of the above meds were held.
On discharge she remained on Keppra but the Baclofen, Tizanidine, Morphine and Tramadol were all stopped given that her renal function was still not back to baseline.
# Rigidity: The patient has rigid upper extremities, decorticate posturing, spastic quadriparesis secondary to her C-spine injury.
This was previously managed with Baclofen and Tizinidine, but even with both being held per above her rigidity improved during hospitalization.
She was therefore treated with an 8-day course of Meropenam to decrease her bacterial burden (last day [**2168-7-30**]).
The patient was taken off the vent on [**7-27**], and did well off the vent without respiratory distress until discharge.
The patient had had no exposure to nephrotoxic drugs and had no documented episodes of hypotension, but her prior treatment with vancomycin and cefepime could have precipitated her ATN or AIN.
The patient's lisinopril, tizanidine and tramadol were held during her hospitalization to limit exposure to potentially nephrotoxic medications.
#HTN: The patient's lisinopril was held while she was in renal failure, but she was treated with IV Hydralazine prn for SBPs > 160.
She is reportedly normotensive at baseline on her home meds prior to admission, likely partly due to her multiple neuropsych meds (Baclofen, Tramadol, Tizanidine etc) blood-pressure lowering effects.
Since all of these meds are still being held, she was discharged on Lisinopril 5mg daily (home med) as well as hydralazine 50mg PO q6 hrs.
As her neuropsych meds are added back on, hydralazine should be downtitrated or stopped as needed.
She has a hx of guiaic positive stools, anemia, requiring transfusion at outside hospital.
#H/O C. diff colitis: Patient was admitted on PO and IV vanc, with toxic serum vanc level as mentioned above.
Given her toxic vanc levels, IV vanc was held and levels were trended throughout hospitalization: trended down to 24.5 on [**7-27**].
Her PO vanc was continued in light of C diff history and because being treated with broad spectrum abx (Meropenam), will continue PO vanc for two weeks after Meropenam course is completed (last day of PO vanc is [**2168-8-13**]).
#LUE DVT:  The patient was prevously on Coumadin for a DVT diagnosed back in [**2167-5-8**].
Given the patient's quadriplegid status, the patient's Coumadin was d/c'ed on [**7-27**] (because all venous tone is lost after several months of [**Month/Year (2) 39850**], her risk for DVT/PE is significantly lower).
DVT prophylaxis was with pneumoboots.

This most likely occurred because you developed a kidney failure and as a result your medications were not filtered.
The build-up of these medications caused metabolic encephalopathy (delirium) and seizures.
The cause of your kidney function may have been from an allergic reaction to one of the antibiotics you were taking (vancomycin) at the level of your kidney.
Most of your medications were stopped and as your kidneys continued to improve so did your mental status.
We have completely stopped some of the medications that you take chronically.
You have tolerated being off these medications well.
The following changes were made to your medication list: 1.
START hydralazine 50mg every 6 hours for hypertension 2.
START keppra 750 mg twice a day 3.
CONTINUE meropenem 500mg IV every 8 hours until [**2168-7-30**] 4.
CONTINUE vancomycin oral 125mg every 6 hours until [**2168-8-13**] 5  INCREASE metoprolol tartrate to 25mg twice a day 6.
STOP gabapentin 400mg daily 9.
STOP hydroxyzine 25/12.5 mL [**Male First Name (un) **] every 4 hours as needed for pain 10.
STOP lisinopril 5mg daily 11.
STOP morphine 10mg every 6 hours for pain 12.
STOP nitroglycerin 0.4mg for pain 13.
STOP tizanidine 4mg every 8 hours as needed for pain 14.
STOP tramadol 50mh every 6 hours as needed for pain 15.
