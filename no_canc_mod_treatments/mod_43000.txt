He was in his USOH yesterday afternoon, and remembers sitting in his recliner [**Location (un) 1131**] a paper in his den.
His wife supplied an antacid and ice packs for his head.
On my review of the images, it looks like a round, moderately hyperintense mass (just under a centimeter in diameter) in or immediately atop the dorsolateral aspect of the mid-to-caudal medulla (near or at the caudal end of the inf cb peduncle, perhaps overlying the vestibular and rostral dorsal-column nuclei and extending medially to or near the rostral DMV/NTS/AP complex).
First dose of IV labetalol 10mg reduced this to 194, and he came down to 166 following a second dose of 10mg IV labetalol.
Says may have had TIA once before the CEAs (episode of vertigo at a barbershop).
- CABG (five-vessel) in [**2102**] at [**Hospital1 18**] - Renal artery stent (which improved his BP and allowed him to stop two anti-HTN agents) - bilateral femoral artery stents for PAD 2.
Gout on allopurinol 7.
Chest: midline sternotomy scar.
-Cranial Nerves: II: PERRL, 3.5 to 2.5mm, brisk.
IT is primarily side-by-side, goes away when covering the left eye (or right), and the separation increases with increasing left-[**Hospital1 **] gaze angle.
No dysdiadochokinesia noted on rapid-alternating movements.
This is a small discrepancy and may be related to technical difficulties.
His ASA was initially stopped and restarted 2 days ago along with heparin SQ.
He requires active titration of the medication to be normotensive.
His hypokalemia has been stable with about 20 meq of potassium given per day (HCTZ).
We sent off serum renin and aldosterone which are still pending.
