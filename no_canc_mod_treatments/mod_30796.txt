Disp:*10 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: RSV bronchitis Diastolic chronic heart failure Acute on chronic renal failure Gout Diabetes   Discharge Condition: Improved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation and treatment of shortness of breath, need for oxygen, and [**Hospital3 **] in your sputum, as well as [**Hospital3 **] after vomiting.
You were treated supportively for the viral infection.
You were also given antibiotics to treat an underlying bacterial lung infection.
After your kidney failure resolved, your Lasix was restarted to get some water out of your lungs, which also helped to improve your breathing.
To keep improving your breathing, you should continue to take your Lasix daily, as well as try to be out of bed, walking as much as possible with assistance, physical therapy, and using your incentive spirometer to open up the collapsed part of your lung.
While you were in the hospital, you had a flare of gout on your finger and ankle, likely due to the fact that we were taking a lot of fluid out of your body with Lasix, and because some of the medications you have to take for your renal failure put you at risk for it.
After discharge, you can take your kidney medications the same as you did prior to admission to the hospital.
You are taking a higher dose of Prednisone than usual to treat the gout flare.
You should measure your [**Hospital3 **] glucose 4-5 times a day and treat with your Novolog as needed and continue taking the Levemir.
You should follow-up with your nephrologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] for the gout in [**12-30**] weeks after discharge and she will start a medication to help prevent further gout attacks.
You can discuss with your primary care physician whether to start taking iron supplements after you are discharged.
You are being discharged with home physical therapy services.
