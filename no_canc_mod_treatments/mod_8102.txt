The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Room for shortness of breath and tachypnea to a respiratory rate of approximately 42 per minute with vital signs at the nursing home of a temperature of 99.8, heart rate of 100 to 110, blood pressure 220/90 and 78 percent oxygen saturation on room air.
Reportedly this patient was previously being treated for a perihilar bilateral pneumonia and given Levaquin 250 mg p.o.
for ten days and then Flagyl 500 mg.
There was a reported episode of vomiting on the day prior to admission with desaturation of his oxygen during those times.
There was also annotation of low-grade temperatures prior to admission.
On presentation to the [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Department, the patient was entered in the MUST sepsis protocol for suspected source of infection with a fever, tachycardia, tachypnea as well as an elevated lactate which on presentation was 5.7.
In the Emergency Department, a right internal jugular central line was placed.
The patient was given Zosyn and Vancomycin for antibiotics and fluid resuscitation and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Dysphagia resulting from the cerebrovascular accident, now    status post G-tube placement.
History of Proteus back abscess, status post incision and    drainage.
MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Levaquin, Flagyl, Tylenol, Zoloft, Seroquel, Lisinopril, Lactulose, Trazodone, Zantac and Colace.
The patient was initially treated    with Zosyn and Vancomycin which was continued for the time    being.
On the Zosyn and Vancomycin,    the patient continued to spike despite treatment with    Zosyn and Vancomycin.
A computerized axial tomography scan done on [**4-1**] showed    an 8 mm obstructing right proximal ureteral calculus with    marked proximal hydroureter and hydronephrosis, bilateral    renal calculi, bilateral renal cysts with a right renal    cyst containing calcification, descending thoracic aortic    aneurysm and cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
For    this problem, Interventional Radiology was consulted and    on [**2141-4-2**], they placed a percutaneous nephrostomy    tube with initial serosanguinous drainage.
As far as the sepsis goes, placement    of the nephrostomy tube helped relieve the infection in    the right kidney caused by the obstructing ureteral stone    and the patient defervesced with minimal fevers and no    signs of worsening sepsis after the nephrostomy tube was    placed.
Renal issues - As noted above, the percutaneous    nephrostomy tube was placed at midnight for the Proteus    sepsis for the obstructing ureteral stone.
After the    nephrostomy tube was placed, the patient's hematocrit    decreased over the next two days from a hematocrit of 40    to 30 and then to 20.
Again for this, Urology as    well as Interventional Radiology were consulted and the    patient was taken on [**2141-4-5**] to the Intervention    Radiology Suite for angiography of the right kidney during    which time several areas of bleeding were found and    embolized.
There is some thought this might    represent renal cancer, although this patient will likely    not undergo surgery in the future.
The patient's acute    renal failure resolved after the nephrostomy tube was    placed, returning to a baseline creatinine of    approximately 1.2 by discharge from the Medical Intensive    Care Unit.
The patient    was continued on pulmonary toilet aspiration precaution    treatment of a potential pneumonia and treatment of    sepsis.
Hematologic - This patient's anemia continued for which    the patient was taken to Interventional Radiology for    embolization of the bleeding vessels within the right    kidney, status post percutaneous nephrostomy tube    placement.
In summary, on transfer from the Medicine Intensive Care Unit this patient's sepsis had resolved after placement of the right percutaneous nephrostomy tube.
The patient required embolization of some bleeding vessels within the right kidney due to a large perinephric hematoma resulting from the placement of a right nephrostomy tube.
The patient will likely be discharged home with the percutaneous nephrostomy tube and bag.
