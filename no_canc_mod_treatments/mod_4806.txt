Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF OVERVIEW: 85 YO female with severe dementia admitted for UTI/Urosepsis and was intubated for airway protection after receiving ativan.
She was quickly extubated and was treated with abx and aggressive fluid resuscitation.
It was found that she had had an acute MI at admission based on enzymes, EKG, and ECHO with segmental WMA c/w infarct - she was managed medically and had been on all cardioprotective medications except a BB, which was added to her regimen prior to discharge.
Adding enzymes retrospectively showed an MB elevated to 18, and troponin to >1.5.
On her final day of hospitalization, BB was added to her regimen.
Their questions were answered regarding the function of the heart that remained, the reason that the MI was not diagnosed initially (complicated diagnosis in the setting of sepsis), the pt's new regimen, the importance of follow-up, and the option of stress test and even elective cath in the future.
It was clearly stated from [**10-2**] forward that neither the patient nor the family would agree to elective cath nor surgery for the patient.
The PMD was notified of the event and we worked closely with her to establish the proper regimen of cardioprotective medications and follow-up plan including VNA, home PT, and close f/u with her PMD and establishment at that time of f/u with a cardiologist.
* UTI/Urosepsis: Due to the Dirty UA, High WBC count, elevated lactate (but below 4.O) and worsening mental status, patient was started on levofloxacin and to double cover gram negatives, ceftazadime (pseudomonal coverage).
She was aggressively fluid resuscitated in the ED and was started on antibiotics.
The patient was put on levoquin alone after transfer to the medical floor.
* Respiratory distress: Intubated for airway protection in the ED.
Patient was placed on AC while in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
She was first placed on cool mist O2 by face mask, was satting between 97-100% and was eventually switched to 4L nasal cannula.
She continued to do well while on nasal cannula w/o desaturations.
The patient was also diuresed with 20IV lasix and put out 2400cc of urine.
Upon admission, her anti-hypertensive meds were held since the team was worried that the patient was septic and owuld rapidly deconpendsate, alhtough the patient was never hypotensive throughout this whole admission.
On ICU day 2, patient was restarted on HTCZ and PO Verapamil and maintained her SBP > 110.
On transfer to the medical floor, [**Last Name (un) **] was restarted at home dose, Verapamil was titrated to home dose, and the pt was started on atenolol 25 qd after speaking with her PMD to establish an acceptable regimen (see above).
* IDDM: Insulin gtt was planned to be started at the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Therefore, the insulin gtt was never started.
On the medical floor, the patient was restarted on her home regimen of long acting insulin and her blood glucose was very well controlled.
RISS was left in place, but the pt rarely, if ever, required additional insulin on her home regimen of long actings.
*Severe Dementia- the team refrained from using benzos & anticholinergic agents as this may worsen disease process.
* Code Status- The patient remained FULL CODE as discussed with patient and with patient's daughters.
