He was stabilized in the Trauma Bay and Neurosurgery Spine Service was called for consultation as well as Ophthalmology and ENT.
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring and he was started on a protocol.
He was electively intubated on [**4-15**] due to oropharyngeal bleeding and high risk of aspiration with initiation of a Propofol drip for sedation at that time.
No percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed.
He underwent ablation for supraventricular tachycardia on [**2194-3-19**], for an atypical nodal re-entry.
Status post left hip replacement.
Status post bilateral inguinal hernia repair.
Status post left rotator cuff repair.
Vitamin B12.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His examination upon admission, he had a blood pressure of 196/90; heart rate of 80; respiratory rate of 18; 99% on two liters nasal cannula; his temperature was 98.6 F.  In the Trauma Bay, he was awake, alert, oriented times three, [**Location (un) 2611**] Coma Score of 15.
HOSPITAL PROGRESS AND COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 96823**], on [**4-18**], was taken to the Operating Room by the Neurosurgical team after cardiac clearance and underwent a C4-5 anterior fusion with diskectomy and fixation.
This included an open reduction of a hyperextension injury followed by a C4-5 ALDF with a fibula allograft and ventral screw plate fixation.
This patient tolerated well the complicated procedure and he was transferred in stable condition to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
Cardiology was again consulted and they recommended to start him on Amiodarone as well as beta blockers.
He was not spiking fevers and we tried to wean him off the ventilatory support.
He continued to require suctioning multiple times on the different shifts and he was producing fairly large amounts of bronchial secretions.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] put a #8 Portex tracheostomy on [**2194-4-25**].
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
He started to spike temperatures and because of the increasing amount of secretions he was started on Levofloxacin empirically.
He was started on Vancomycin and the Levofloxacin was discontinued.
Once again, Cardiology recommended to continue the Amiodarone and the beta blockers.
On the night of [**5-5**], the patient bradied down to the 40s, requiring Atropine to increase his heart rate and the Amiodarone as well as the Lopressor was held.
The patient was started on Dopamine and Levophed to keep his blood pressure, and a new Cardiology evaluation was obtained.
Their recommendation was to hold the Amiodarone and the beta blockers and wean the pressors as tolerated.
By the next day he converted to normal sinus rhythm and he was restarted on a lower dose of beta blockers, Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
A GJ tube was placed by Interventional Radiology and the patient was started on tube feeds.
His tube feeds were advanced to Impact with fiber at 90 cc with good tolerance and he was continued on the antibiotic therapy.
The rest of his hospital course, once on the Floor, was relatively uneventful, and finally today he was offered a bed on the Rehabilitation Facility and he is being transferred to this institution to continue his recovery.
