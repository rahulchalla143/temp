On Monday, she was discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**]; she was frustrated by the leg swelling she continued to have, but understood that the doctors were recommending [**Name5 (PTitle) 74510**] of lasix because of concern over her renal function.
Leg elevation did help with this, and a visiting nurse took measurements at home that suggested no major change in size of her LEs.
Combivent nebs x2 were given; azithromycin 500 mg PO x1 was given; albuterol was given; the patient was placed on NIPPV by respiratory and based on possible ongoing need for NIPPV, was admitted to the MICU.
By the time she arrived in the MICU, she was back on nasal cannula, breathing comfortably and satting well.
From a cardiology standpoint, she was considered low-risk, but pulmonary put her at a high risk for failure to wean from the vent based on a FVC of 1.4 and an FEV1 of 0.52; ultimately, with the resolution of her possible biliary symptoms, and these risks, surgery elected not to go forward with an operation.
