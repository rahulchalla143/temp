Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 97194**] is an 89y/o man with an extensive cardiac history including chronic systolic CHF (last EF 30%), CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**], last PCI in [**10/2157**] with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**] to LIMA, Afib not on coumadin and recurrent pleural effusions s/p recent large volume thoracentesis, who presented with hypotension and weakness in the setting of increased diuretic regimen.
# Hypotension: Was likely related to large volume thoracentesis on [**11-11**], hypovolemia from being NPO and poor PO intake since last discharge, strict 6 cup fluid restriction, and recent change and titration up of diuretics and antihypertensive regimen.
He would clearly benefit from Spironolactone and Valsartan but his BP does not tolerate these medications.
I addition, Tamsulosin was stopped (he had no trouble urinating).
He will continue on his home dose of Torsemide and Sotalol.
Patient would [**Doctor Last Name **] benefit from Spironolactone but does not seem to tolerate.
He declines coumadin at home.
He was continued on Sotalol.
# Coronary artery disease: Troponin was stable at .03 x3, most likely demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension, less likely [**2-8**] atrial stretch given no evidence of overload.
He was continued on ASA 325 and plavix 75. .
He was continued on simvastatin.
# BPH s/p TURP: holding Tamsulosin due to low BP/lightheadedness, but hehad no trouble urinating.
In discussions with Mr. and Mrs. [**Known lastname 97194**], it was clear that they understand the prognosis of advanced heart failure, especially in the setting of needing to cut back on medications such as Spironolactone that would benefit him in the long run.
