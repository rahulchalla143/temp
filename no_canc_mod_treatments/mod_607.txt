Admission Date:  [**2123-3-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2123-3-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2064-4-28**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Coronary Care Unit  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 58-year-old man with history of coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial infarction [**2113-4-28**] with stent to the right coronary artery, angioplasty to the obtuse marginal in [**Month (only) 359**] of '[**14**], stent to the right coronary artery in [**2114-11-28**], angioplasty to the posterolateral branch of the right coronary artery in [**2116-6-28**], who presented with unstable angina x3 weeks to an outside hospital.
On the evening of admission, the patient awoke from sleep with 9/10 chest pain and diaphoresis, and took six sublingual nitroglycerin as well as aspirin without resolution of chest pain, so he called ambulance.
Patient received Heparin drip, Morphine, and nitroglycerin at the outside hospital and became chest pain free.
Patient also received Retavase at the outside hospital.
Patient had been scheduled for elective cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 **], therefore he was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2123-3-26**] the same evening that he presented to the outside hospital.
However, his pain recurred, and a repeat electrocardiogram showed ST elevations approximately 1 mm in the inferior leads, st depression in V1 and V2 and 1 & avl with t wave inversion in avl.The patient was therefore brought from the Emergency Room to the Coronary Cath Laboratory.
The patient received two hepacoat stents to his right coronary artery with good flow afterwards.
Patient was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further management.
The BUN rose to 34 while the  creatinine remained normal, presumably after lasix and contrast induced diuresis given earlier in his course.
Patient is status post thrombolytics at the outside hospital, but with recurrence of symptoms and underwent catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**].
Status post repeat cardiac catheterization with stent placement and resolution of symptoms:  Patient's ECG changes normalized after coronary catheterization and the patient remained asymptomatic throughout the remainder of his hospital stay.
Patient was also started on Plavix 75 once a day.
Patient was maintained on his beta blocker of Toprol XL 50 mg q.d.
Patient had not been on a statin for approximately 1.5 years due to leg cramping, however, he was started on pravastatin 20 mg once a day with planned close followup with his primary care physician.
The patient was also continued on his Heparin drip, which he was on upon transfer from the outside hospital, and this was continued for 48 hours post catheterization.
Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Patient was maintained on a cardiac diet and his electrolytes especially potassium and magnesium were repleted as needed.
Prophylaxis:  Patient was on a Heparin drip throughout his hospital stay and was eating well without history of gastroesophageal reflux disease or peptic ulcer disease.
Aspirin 325 once a day.
Plavix 75 once a day.
Toprol XL 50 mg once a day.
Pravastatin was discontinued at discharge because of the severe episode of leg weakness on Lipitor.
