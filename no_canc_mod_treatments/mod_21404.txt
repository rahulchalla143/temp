Admission Date:  [**2146-7-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-7-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-8-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Codeine / Benzodiazepines  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14037**] Chief Complaint: fever, respiratory distress, altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 70 year-old man with history of dementia (attributed to Korsakoff?????
He was given 2 grams of CTX IV for meningitis dosing, as well as one gram of IV vancomycin.
110 with removal of restraints, and when allowed to rest.
Dementia/Korsakoff's psychosis (attributed to history of alcohol abuse), with agitation and hallucinations 3.
COPD: on chronic predisone 5mg tid, s/p previous intubation in the setting of percocet OD 4.
He was given 2 grams of CTX IV for meningitis dosing, as well as one gram of IV vancomycin.
110 with removal of restraints, and when allowed to rest.
He was treated empirically for an aspiration PNA (seen on CXR) with levo/flagyl and his temperatures subsequently decreased to 99.
He continued to complain of dyspnea with hypoxia.
Psychiatry was consulted and did not feel that the etiology of his fevers was secondary to NMS as he had been tapered on haldol and then stopped prior to admission and fevers and that his mental status improved on the floor while off all neuroleptics.
His metronidazole was discontinued and his levofloxacin continued.
Given a concern for PE, a femoral line was placed and CTA performed which revealed no PE and stable RLL infiltrate.
Recommended stopping Zyprexa as it can cause extrapyramidal side effects and restarting Seroquel (as patient had been treated with it prior to admission).
His respiratory distress was felt to be more likely psychiatric in origin, as he improved while sleeping and his symptoms did not seem to be related to his level of hypoxia.
An NG tube was placed for tube feedings and medications.
He was transitioned from Zyprexa to Seroquel and trazadone for agitation, with the reasoning that his respiratory status would improve once he was back on his full psych regimen.
Finished a course of Flagyl and levofloxacin for pneumonia but his WBC continued to trend up.
Pt continued to be more agitated, pulling his NGT and refusing another NG replacement, requiring constant nursing care.
At this point, his guardian and family were called to have a family meeting to discuss about code status and whether to continue aggressive treatment.
All aggresive treatments including vanco, solumedrol, prophylactic meds were discontinued as well as checking labs.
Pt was started on morphine drip, ativan, and haldol for comfort and delirium.
