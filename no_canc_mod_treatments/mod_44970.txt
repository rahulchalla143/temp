Upon hearing this plan, I uttered my concerns to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] that this potentially lead to discontinuity of care and, in addition, that abnormalities might be detected on this laboratory testing that would require prompt treatment.
I confirmed with her my notion that it would be best that the child receive both confirmatory laboratory testing and subsequent treatment within a single institution.
She was to attempt to contact the father on his cell phone to discuss having the evaluation and treatment at one institution but is unable to contact him.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will be providing care on the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit this evening and will continue discussions with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the family.
