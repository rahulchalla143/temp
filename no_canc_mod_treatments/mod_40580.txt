She was given ASA 325, Heparin 60U/kg, Atorvastatin 80 and Plavix 600 and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for PCI.
Cardiac cath showed total mid RCA occulsion (R dominant) and a DES was placed with restoration of flow to the distal RCA and PDA.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes, Hypertension 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - cataracts - GERD - osteoporosis - spinal stenosis - gastric ulcer - asthma - hysterectomy - cholecystectomy - multiple back surgeries   Social History: Lives alone in [**Location (un) 26671**], retired office worker.
- Mother: Died at age 87, unclear history of CAD - Father: Stroke at age 65  Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: VS: T 98 BP 93/48 HR 63 RR 17 O2 Sat 97% 2L NC Wt 153 lbs GENERAL: NAD.
There is a focal defect in the basal inferior septum on 2D and color Doppler with continuous left-to-right flow c/w a post infarction ventricular septal defect (VSD).
Increased T2 signal in these segments, consistent with edema/inflammation and acute/subacute timing of infarction (within 2 weeks).
However, there is no correlate on prior chest radiograph.
She was started on ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin, metoprolol and lisinopril during her hospital course.
Her O2 sat remained >93% on RA throughout her course and she was given diuresis for reducing pulmonary edema and shunt, and minimizing pulmonary hypertension.
The definite treatment will require surgical repair of the interventricular septum defect.
Percutaneous VSD closure may also be an option.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: - F/U WITH CT SURGERY/INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY - Adjust lasix 80 mg po qd - Should have RHC to assess shunt function which could help decide whether patient needs to have her shunt fixed  # A-fib: Pt was found to have a period of unsustained symptomatic A-fib, lasting ~30 mins.
This could be a result of changes in RA volume and dynamics.
Amiodarone was started for rhythm control.
She was continued on metoprolol for rate control.
She was restarted on pioglitizone prior to discharge.
# HTN - Her home Verapamil was held and she was started on Metoprolol and Lisinopril with SBP goal in the 90s given the lack of mortality benefit of CCB (especially verapamil)  # GERD - Patient has a documented history of GERD, and takes omeprazole at home.
Omeprazole was stopped in setting of plavix while ranitidine was started at 150 mg po qhs.
# HLD: She was started on atorvastatin 80 mg po qdaily (PROVE trial) but it was decreased to 40 mg po qdaily given she was on multiple medications (amiodarone) which would uptitrate her statin dose putting her at risk for rhabdomyolysis.
