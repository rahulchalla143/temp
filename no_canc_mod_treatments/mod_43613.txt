The patient believes she hit her right hip and lip.
Coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in [**2115**] with cardiac catheterization and RC stent in [**2115-6-15**], [**8-/2119**] catheterization, RCA with 40% stenotic in the midportion, 30% distally, LAD 70% mid portion stenosis, D1 70% to 80% stenosis, left circumflex diffusely diseased and completely occluded beyond the first obtuse marginal branch.
Prednisone 2.5 mg q.a.m.
Protonix 40 mg q.a.m.
Aspirin 325 mg PO q.d.
Detrol 4 mg PM.
Synthroid 0.125 mg PO q.d.
Neurontin 300 mg b.i.d.
Prozac 20 mg q.a.m.
Digoxin 0.125 mg q.a.m.
Glucophage 500 mg t.i.d.
Regular insulin sliding scale 25 units AM, and 20 units PM NPH insulin.
The patient was held off the carvedilol secondary to active congestive heart failure.
The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells due to anemia.
Unfortunately, this worsened the congestive heart failure with crackles remaining 2/3rds of the way up, even after IV Lasix dose.
The patient was also held on her ACE inhibitor since the creatinine was high and potassium was high.
Renal consultation was curbsided and it turns out that the patient had hypoaldosteronism in the past, which explains her chronically elevated levels of potassium and three times a week of Kayexalate.
The patient continued to remain on heparin drip, and the patient was scheduled for catheterization after the weekend.
The patient could not be given beta blocker or Cardizem due to decreased blood pressure.
The patient was given two fluid boluses of 250 normal saline, which resulted in systolic blood pressure coming up to 85 and decreased heart rate to 95.
The patient's pain resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
It was decided that the patient should go to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for elective cardioversion due to atrial fibrillation resulting in cardiovascular compromise.
The patient was transferred up to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for cardioversion at this time.
The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit for further management.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] [**Name (NI) 653**] the family at that time to discuss further management options and interventions.
The patient remained in the coronary care unit for three days, where she was given stress dose steroids, secondary to PMR.
She was continued on heparin since she had ruled in for a second MI due to that brief episode of chest pain.
The patient was also noted ....................and was placed on insulin drip with glucoses running greater than 400, accompanied by anion gap.
The patient's hematocrit was low, and the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
The patient was started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for a ten-day course due to the possibility of aspiration pneumonia with the intubation, as well as positive urine culture for E. coli.
The patient was changed over to PO Amiodarone after two days and she was continued on 400 mg t.i.d.
The Digoxin was restarted for better rate control.
IV Vancomycin was also started, while she was in the coronary care unit for one out of four bottles positive for gram-positive cocci, which was possibly thought to be a contaminate, but secondary to the presence of central line.
This medication was discontinued.
During all these interventions, the patient was positive six liters of fluid, but diuresed approximately two liters with crackles remaining half way up her lung fields, prior to discharge from the coronary care unit.
She was continued on the Amiodarone and antibiotics.
While on the [**Hospital Unit Name **] floor, the patient was continued on Amiodarone and Digoxin for the atrial fibrillation.
On the second day, status post coronary care unit stay, the Digoxin was discontinued, secondary to heart rates around 56 since she was on Amiodarone, Digoxin, and beta blocker at this time.
The beta-blocker was held secondary to acute congestive heart failure.
The ACE inhibitor was also held due to high creatinine and potassium and hypokalemia.
The patient was diuresed with Lasix 40 mg b.i.d.
The patient had been transfused three units of packed red blood cells during the stay at [**Hospital1 1444**] at this time, which was worrisome.
The patient was placed on iron, since she has been on iron in the past.
Iron stains were not performed since she had received three units of packed red blood cells and this would confound the results of iron studies.
The patient was continued on her gastrointestinal prophylaxis and Reglan for nausea, from an Infectious Disease standpoint.
Levofloxacin and Flagyl were continued for ten days as PO.
Surveillance cultures were taken and pending results of the cultures, the patient was to have the Vancomycin discontinued or PICC line placed.
The patient also had her code status changed to DNR/DNI, after a long discussion with the family, but at the time that I left the service it was quite uncertain if she still wished pressors to be used and this issue was to be further discussed with the family and decision was to be made by the time of discharge.
Of note, the patient was markedly depressed after her coronary care unit stay.
Measures were ensured to make sure that her pain control was adequate.
The patient was also to be followed up by the Department of Physical Therapy for evaluation on Monday to see if her new MI and numerous interventions would prevent her from returning back to her independent lifestyle.
