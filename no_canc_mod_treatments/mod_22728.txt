A 0.035 inch Bentson guidewire was advanced through the needle into the inferior vena cava.
The needle was removed off the wire and a 5 French Omniflush catheter was steered into the left external iliac vein.
Review of the images demonstrated no caval anatomic variations, a single inferior vena cava, without intraluminal filling defects.
Based on the diagnostic findings, it was determined that an IVC filter placement was indicated.
The in situ catheter and sheath were removed over the wire, and the IVC filter sheath was advanced over the wire.
A Gunther Tulip filter was then delivered uneventfully to the lower margin of the L2 vertebral body, inferior to the renal veins.
Hemostasis was achieved using digital compression for a total of 5 minutes.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate postprocedure complications.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a Gunther Tulip IVC filter.
upper and lower US neg for clot REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please perform MRV of HEPATIC VEINS to evaulate for clot/source of PE INDICATION: Four weeks status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy with known pulmonary embolism, subcapsular hematoma.
Visualization of the left adrenal gland and pancreas appears unremarkable.
Low signal within the inferior vena cava after administration of gadolinium at the infrarenal level likely represents an IVC filter.
She was placed on a Heparin drip and later changed to Lovenox; an IVC filter was placed.
She did remain on the Lovenox for several days after IVC filter placement, but this was eventually stopped.
Initially she required high FIO2 to maintain her oxygen saturations; at one point endotracheal intubation was being considered.
Her FIO2 requirements did decrease and she was transferred to the floor where she continued to require nasal oxygen.
Interventional radiology was consulted for the subcapsular hepatic hematoma noted on abdominal CT imaging; a percutaneous drainage catheter was placed.
She will follow up with her primary doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further treatment if necessary.
Physical therapy and Occupational therapy were consulted and have recommended home with services.
