Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2140-3-15**] PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION: Indication: Intraoperative TEE for Re-do Bental Procedure Status: Inpatient Date/Time: [**2140-3-15**] at 13:55 Test: TEE (Complete) Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler Contrast: None Tape Number: 2007AW1-: Test Location: Anesthesia West OR cardiac Technical Quality: Adequate REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**] MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 1.0 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: *9.2 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 20% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Ascending: 2.8 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aorta - Descending Thoracic: 2.3 cm (nl <= 2.5 cm) INTERPRETATION: Findings: LEFT ATRIUM: All four pulmonary veins identified and enter the left atrium.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA  and extending into the RV.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal anterior  - hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid anteroseptal -  hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal inferior - hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid inferolateral - hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo; anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex - hypo; apex - hypo; RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity.
The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.
Patient is s/p aortic homograft placement in past.
POST CPB The patient is receiving infusions of milrinone, dobutamine, and norepinephrine.
Prior to surgery, TEE was performed which revealed severely dilated right and left ventricles with severely depressed right and left ventricular function.
Given these new findings, surgery was postponed and additional evaluation was performed, including potential cardiac transplantation.
In the operating room, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] performed redo sternotomy along with aortic valve replacement and replacement of ascending aorta.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and weaned from inotropic support without difficulty.
He was transfused with packed red blood cells to maintain hematocrit near 30%.
Wafarin was dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 2.5 given his mechanical aortic valve.
He temporarily required Heparin for a subtherapeutic prothrombin time.
He spiked a fever on postoperative day four for which pan cultures were obtained and empiric antibiotics were given.
