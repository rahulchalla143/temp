HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old gentleman with history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2150**].
In [**2154**] patient underwent a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to left anterior descending artery.
Catheterization showed ejection fraction of 50%, 100% native LAD disease, 90% thrombotic OM1 lesion, 100% proximal RCA lesion, occluded saphenous vein graft to OM1 and LIMA to LAD small but filling the distal LAD.
In the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory patient underwent PTCA to the OM with no stent placement and was admitted for observation.
Patient's nitroglycerin drip was increased.
The patient tolerated this procedure well.
Patient was started on heparin and given morphine and Lopressor.
Patient's cardiac enzymes continued to trend upward and Cardiac Surgery was consulted.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2150**] and status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to left anterior descending artery in [**2154**].
Status post myocardial infarction [**2151**] and [**2154**].
Status post dilation of esophagus in [**2164**].
Lopressor 75 mg p.o.
Lorazepam 1 mg p.o.
Isordil 60 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Ambien 5 mg p.o.
Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Plavix 75 mg p.o.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
Asacol 800 mg p.o.
Neurontin 100 mg p.o.
Flexeril 10 mg p.o.
Patient was also on Aggrastat and a nitroglycerin drip.
Patient was referred to Cardiac Surgery for medical management.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to Cardiac Surgery on [**2166-9-18**], for a re-do coronary artery bypass graft times three, saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
The patient had 106 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass with 74 minutes of crossclamp.
Patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on low dose Neo-Synephrine and propofol.
Patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation on postoperative day one.
The Infectious Disease team was consulted and it was recommended that patient continue on intravenous vancomycin and intravenous levofloxacin for broad spectrum antibiotic coverage.
Patient's chest tubes were removed on postoperative day two.
Patient was treated with intravenous and oral Lopressor without successful rate control.
The patient was started on diltiazem infusion for control of his heart rate with moderate results.
Patient's diltiazem infusion was increased over the next day to maintain ventricular response less than 120.
On postoperative day four patient continued on diltiazem infusion at 20 mg an hour and atrial fibrillation with heart rate of 120.
Patient was started on intravenous amiodarone and Electrophysiology Service was consulted for possible cardioversion.
After intravenous amiodarone load patient converted into sinus rhythm.
The diltiazem infusion was discontinued and p.o.
Patient was again pan cultured as well as stool being sent for Clostridium difficile.
Patient continued on the intravenous vancomycin and levofloxacin for empiric broad spectrum antibiotic coverage.
The recommendations of the Electrophysiology Service were to continue the patient on amiodarone and Lopressor.
No need for anticoagulation as the patient had converted into sinus rhythm unless the patient had further episodes of atrial fibrillation.
It was presumed that this was the cause as patient was on broad spectrum antibiotics.
It was recommended continuing with the current treatment and no further intervention was required.
The patient had also been empirically started on Flagyl for Clostridium difficile.
On postoperative day eight a Gastroenterology consult was obtained for colonoscopy to rule out ischemic colon.
The Psychiatry consult felt that the conversation that they had with the patient helped alleviate many of the patient's anxieties and recommended continuing with the present treatment and having the patient follow up as an outpatient.
On postoperative day 13 after discussions with the Infectious Disease team and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**], it was felt that as the patient had no positive cultures and the white blood cell count was down, the suspected source for the elevated leukocytosis was the thrombophlebitis and the patient would be safe for discharge to home on oral levofloxacin for two weeks.
Status post re-do coronary artery bypass graft times three.
Percocet 5/325 one to two p.o.
Enteric coated aspirin 325 p.o.
Zantac 150 mg p.o.
Plavix 75 mg p.o.
Asacol 800 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Niferex 150 mg p.o.
Lopressor 75 mg p.o.
Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
Ativan 1 mg p.o.
Neurontin 100 mg p.o.
