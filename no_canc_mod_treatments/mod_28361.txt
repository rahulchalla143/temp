Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan:  Patient is 59 yo woman without known cardiac history, presented to OSH with suicide attempt o/d on zyprexa and adderall, now intubated w/ pna and course c/b NSTEMI.
# Aspiration PNA/MSSA sepsis:  The patient was started on levo ([**3-19**]) at admission and then added vanc the following day.
The patient finished 7 day course of levoquin (750mg/day) on [**3-25**] and was switched to oxacillin on [**3-25**] as BCX came back as MSSA.
The patient will finish 14 day course oxacillin on [**4-2**].
# Respiratory failure: Pt was initially intubated for airway protection after found unresponsive and subsequently found to have bilateral pneumonia thought to be [**2-9**] aspiration.
The patient was extubated on [**3-23**] and has required high O2, so empirically started short-course prednisone (5days) for presumed COPD exacerbation on [**3-25**].
Lipitor was not started as cholesterol was low.
The patient has been auto-diuresing without needing lasix for all the fluid she received for sepsis.
# Suicide attempt/OD:  Per OSH records, pt OD on zyprexa and adderall.
After extubation, she was placed on CIWA scale and 1:1 sitter for possible alcoholism and SI.
Pt was also started on Remeron per psych recs.
Since she was not exhibiting signs of SI to the psych service, SW or to us, it was felt that reinstituting a sitter would be seen as punitive.
She was continued on IV oxacillin and was changed to Levofloacin on discharge - since her bacteremia was also succeptible to this antibiotics.
Patient's BP remained in the 80s-90s for much of her stay on the floor making it difficult to add on BB and ACE-I.
She was on ASA on the floor.
20mg lipitor was started on discharge.
During her stay on the floor, she was walked with PT and her oxygen requirements were weaned down slowly; on discharge patient was completely off of oxygen and was comfortable.
She finished a 5 day course of steroids for putative bronchospasm in the hospital and was maintained on nebulizers.
