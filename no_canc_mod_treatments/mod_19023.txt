The patient was intubated for airway protection and initially brought to the [**Hospital6 5016**].
It was decided to place bilateral chest tubes in the trauma bay, obtaining about 100 cc of bloody drainage total.
A left subclavian triple-lumen was placed without any complication as an accessory line and the placement was verified by the chest x-ray, as well as repositioning of the ET tube that was pulled about 3.0 cm out as it was placed too close to the carina in the prior film.
The next serial hematocrit, about half an hour later, came back at 26 and the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
The nursing staff noticed that the left chest tube had about 300 cc of bloody drainage into the canister.
An additional right femoral Cordis was placed and the patient dropped her blood pressure to the 70s systolic.
She was placed emergently in Trendelenburg position and bolused with IV fluids as well as the remainder of the packed red blood cells.
At that point, the left chest tube had drained about 900 cc of blood and was still draining bright red blood into the canister.
A new hematocrit was obtained, as well as coagulation studies which revealed a hematocrit of 26 despite about five units of packed red blood cells that were already infused.
Upon reviewing the patient's case, the blood pressure of this unfortunate woman dropped once again to the 70s and this time, despite positioning changes and an additional five units of packed red blood cells for a total of ten, and one unit of fresh frozen plasma, the patient's blood pressure did not recover.
