She was also found to have oropharyngeal dysphagia of unclear etiology s/p PEG tube placement and was transferred to [**Hospital **] rehab on levo/flagyl for her PNA.
Since her transfer to [**Hospital1 5595**], she developed superficial cellulitis of her PEG tube site and was started on keflex x3days.
Initially, the pt was attempted to be managed medically with Diltiazem 50mg x1 but was unsuccessful - remained tachycardic.
However she was started on DA gtt for unclear reasons and subsequently reverted to SVT.
She was also given Vancomycin 1g and Flagyl 500mg for her PNA and ?c.diff.
She was a given a total of 4L of NS in the ED.
She was started on an esmolol gtt without significant effect.
She subsequently reverted back to SVT 30 min later at which time adenosine 6mg IV x1 was given with again temporary relief.
At this time, she was given Digoxin 0.25mcg x1.
Oral and Pharyngeal dysphagia of unclear etiology - EMG, MRI and neuro eval without clear cause - Failed speech and swallow with video swallow test s/p PEG tube placement on [**2108-6-5**] by GI 3.
Loculated pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis (exudative) and s/p VATS for decortication and drainage and chest tube x2.
Aspiration is greatly reduced with nectar thick liquids and pureed solids, but not completely prevented, when using a  right head turn and a chin tuck, which the pt uses independently at this time.
Suggest a PO diet of nectar thick liquids and pureed consistency solids.
Pt should turn her head towards the right and tuck her chin to her chest with liquids and solids.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 80yo F with recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for loculated pleural effusion s/p VATS/pneumonectomy who was recently treated with keflex for G tube site cellulitis p/w tachycardia in setting of c.diff.
Pt was given digoxin 0.25mg x1, followed by 0.125 mg qd on [**6-26**], per EP.
Digoxin d/c'ed, amiodarone continued at 100 mg qd.
Continued ASA 325mg once daily.
Hypotension: The hypotension may have been secondary to her AVnRT, however since her BP did not improve even after restoration of NSR at 70s, more likely due to her initial infected/septic presentation.
This was attributed to vasodilation from ongoing sepsis (tachycardia, WBC count with source of infection (c diff), and hypotension).
Patient was on pressors from [**Date range (1) 95249**] weaned off neo gtt on [**6-27**].
ID: Given the development of fever and diarrhea along with positive C.diff stool and WBC count of 20.5 on admission, this was most likely due to c.diff especially in the setting of recent antibiotic use.
Should continue Flagyl PO TID x 2 additional weeks with last dose [**2108-7-14**].
Hypothyroidism: although unlikely, the pt may also be overrepleted with her thyroid medication resulting in SVT.
Continued on Levothyroxine 37.5 mcg Daily.
Continued on Buspirone 10 mg Daily and Diazepam 2 mg QAM.
- will hold off on initiating vancomycin at this point, but this site should be monitored clincally for signs of infection.
Had Re-S&S on [**6-29**], which suggested ongoing evidence of aspiration, but recommended allowing nectar-thick liquids and pureed solids.
