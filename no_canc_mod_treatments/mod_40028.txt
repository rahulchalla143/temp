His hospital course was notable for hypoxia and hypotension on [**2-28**] in the setting of blood transfusion, with Klebsiella pneumoniae in [**5-14**] blood culture bottles.
He was empirically treated with levofloxacin and flagyl.
He did experience an elevation of his cardiac enzymes thought c/w NSTEMI vs demand ischemia; this was medically treated with beta blocker/ASA/statin.
ERCP was delayed until [**3-11**] as he was not felt to be stable enough for the procedure prior to that time.
At ERCP, the CBD was cannulated with pancreatogram showing distal filling defects c/w stones.
Subsequently he was intubated and transferred to the CCU.
His antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and Zosyn per the OSH ID consultant's recommendations.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-12**] for ERCP and further management of his biliary sepsis.

Successful cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
[**3-18**] CXR Minimal interval improvement in pulmonary edema is noted with unchanged left retrocardiac atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions.
He was continued on vancomycin and zosyn for coverage of the Klebsiella and MRSA isolated at the OSH.
His dopamine was weaned off, but by [**3-13**] he again required pressor support despite aggressive fluid resuscitation so he was started on levophed.
He underwent the planned ERCP on [**3-13**] with stenting of the biliary duct and drainage of dark bile.
Subsequent to the ERCP he required additional ventilatory support and addition of vasopressin for additional blood pressure support.
He was started on Xigris on [**3-14**] which was initially complicated by some hematuria and heme positive stools.
Xigris was discontinued by [**3-15**] in anticipation of central line change.
After discussion with the family regarding the patient's extremely poor prognosis in setting of respiratory failure, candidemia, cholangitis, and transfusion dependent GI bleed the decision was made to make the patient CMO.
He was extubated and pressors were discontinued.
He was empirically started on caspofungin on [**3-16**] when this positive result returned.
Respiratory failure, ARDS The patient remained ventilatory dependent during his hospitalization with P/F ratios less than 200 and bilateral infiltrates c/w ARDS.
The family declined the procedure given the patient's extremely poor prognosis by the time gross GI bleeding had developed.
COPD We continued the patient on his bronchodilators.
