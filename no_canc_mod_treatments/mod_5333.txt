She was given Solumedrol, Benadryl, tylenol, and 20 IV lasix and was sent to the ED.
Her CXR was felt to be consistent with CHF so she was given an additional 40 mg IV lasix with 530 cc UO.
She remained tachypneic so she was placed on Bipap for 35 minutes with improvement in her oxygenation and shortness of breath.
She was given a dose of vancomycin and was transferred to the ICU for further management and supportive care.
She reports an 8lb weight gain over the prior week with increasing abdominal girth and lower extremity edema.
ITP - [**10-27**] - antiplatelet ab positive - no significant response to IVIG, platelet transfusion, low-dose prednisone, and most recently prednisone 60 mg daily x 7 days (now tapered off x 1 week.
S/P Winrho today (works by production of anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] (D)-(anti-D) coated RBC complexes resulting in Fc receptor blockade, thus sparing antibody- coated platelets).

Hypercellular bone marrow for age with erythroid hyperplasia, see note.
Although rare dyspoietic erythroid precursors are seen, overall morphologic findings are not diagnostic of a primary myelodysplastic syndrome.
However, this process could potentially obscure underlying chronic interstitial disease, and if clinically indicated, repeat scanning following diuresis could be performed.
Brief Hospital Course: # MICU course: In the MICU, the patient was stablized with IVF, however her laboratory values showed a severe hemolytic reaction with an rise in her total bilirubin to 21, a drop in her hematocrit to 23, acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2, and LDH >800 and haptoglobin <20.
She received 1u pRBC and her Hct stabilized at 23.
Cardiology and renal were consulted to help guide further management, given that she was in need of diuresis in the setting of severe aortic stenosis and acute renal failure.
She become hypotensive when diuresis was attempted with IV lasix.
She was switched to a lasix gtt with improvement in her diuresis and less change in her blood pressure.
She was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 for continued diuresis and CT surgery evaluation for valve replacement.
She was started on a lasix gtt for diuresis given that she was in renal failure and was not making large volumes of diuresis.
She then began a post-ATN diuresis and 2kg were able to be diuresed using a lasix gtt and IV diuril.
CT surgery was consulted for evaluation of the patient's candidacy for aortic and mitral valve replacement.
Discussions between all of the consulting teams led to the decision to hold off on surgery currently given the patient's tenuous medical status.
She was tried on lasix 120mg PO TID, which was a dose equivalent to what she as receiving on the lasix gtt.
Her BP remained in the high 70s and low 80s, which limited our ability to use spironolactone and metolazone as additional diuretic agents.
Her electrolytes were checked regularly given the aggressive diuresis and were repleted as needed.
She was not able to receive aspirin given her thrombocytopenia and she could not take an ACE-I given her hypotension and acute renal failure.
She was started on nadolol for b-blockade, cirrhosis and varices; however, her BP often prohibited her from receiving this medication.
She was monitored on telemetry daily and her electrolytes were repleted regularly.
DAT was positive, haptoglobin was <20, LDH >800, and bilirubin of >21.
She was essentially monitored and given supportive care until her labs began to improve.
She was given another trial of IV Ig followed by 2 bags of platelets, in order to see if the patient could tolerate this during surgery in case the need arised.
The possibility of using rituxan as an outpatient was considered by her hematologist and will be discussed as a potential therapy at her next hematology appointment.
Hypoxia - The etiology of her hypoxia is most likely multifactorial, with elements of volume overload, CHF, and valvular disease contributing.
She was discharged on a diuretic regimen of lasix, spirinolactone and metolazone.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] wanted to continue with surgery but the decision was made to hold off for now until her liver function improves in order to improve her chances of survival.
She was discharged on a standing dose of lantus as well as a humalog sliding scale.
Her electrolytes were checked regularly and were repleted to keep K >4, Mg >2.
PPX - She was ordered for pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, but the patient did not wear them due to her low plts.
She was treated with a PPI and sucralfate daily, but the sucralfate was discontinued after consulting with hepatology.
She was also given a  bowel regimen prn.

You were then transferred to the cardiac floor for careful monitoring of your volume status.
Discussions were held about the possibility of surgery to repair your heart valves, but the decision was made to wait until your body recovers further from the Winrho reaction.
Please take all your medications as prescribed.
Your LASIX dose has been increased to 120mg three times a day.
PROTONIX was added to prevent bleeding from the varices.
For now we are holding the NADOLOL as well as the SPIRONOLACTONE because your blood pressure has been low.
