Admission Date:  [**2122-10-23**]       Discharge Date:   Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 92935**] is an 85 year old man with a past medical history significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation for the preceding one year, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% to 45% in [**2121-11-12**], who presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2122-10-23**] with a complaint of one month of progressive dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea plus a one day history of substernal/epigastric chest pressure.
There was no improvement in his hemodynamic status, and evidence of worsening congestive heart failure despite initial treatment with intravenous diltiazem 70 mg, intravenous Lopressor 40 mg and intravenous Lasix 40 mg.  DC cardioversion was attempted twice, with reversion to a nodal rhythm with a heart rate in the 40s and a blood pressure of 80 to 120/palpable.
The intubation was traumatic and required multiple attempts before successful endotracheal placement was achieved.
There was approximately a five minute period in which he was esophageally intubated with an SAO2 dropping to the 60s.
He remained hypotensive and bradycardiac and received Atropine once before being started on a Dopamine drip.
He was then transferred one day later to the Medical Intensive Care Unit service with rising creatinine, rising liver function tests and concern for aspiration pneumonia.
Given his aspiration, bilateral infiltrates on a chest x-ray, hypoxia and poor pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, there was an initial concern that he was entering acute respiratory distress syndrome.
However, he did not have difficulty with ventilation or oxygenation and was quickly weaned down on his FiO2, eventually being weaned from the ventilator by [**2122-11-5**].
It was unclear whether he had actually suffered a myocardial infarction in the setting of his presentation.
Shortly after his admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient reverted to rapid atrial fibrillation and was controlled with nodal ablations.
He required frequent intravenous Lopressor boluses to control his heart rate and was started on a diltiazem drip.
His blood pressure was controlled with a Neo-Synephrine drip for approximately three days following admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
He was started on levofloxacin and Flagyl for concern for aspiration pneumonia.
The patient's neurological status was depressed during his Medical Intensive Care Unit stay, presumed to be secondary to an undetermined period of hypoxia during his initial presentation as well as large doses of Ativan and fentanyl for sedation while he was intubated.
On [**2122-11-5**], the patient was transferred to the floor, where he stayed briefly, however, he had persistent agitation, requiring a one-to-one sitter and a significant amount of Haldol.
The patient was treated with intravenous Lasix and placed on a nasal cannula.
On [**2122-11-10**] a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding tube was placed due to the patient's inability to swallow without aspiration.
He was restarted on a diltiazem drip for heart rate control.
He was weaned off all pressors and sedatives, extubated, and sent to the floor once again.
MEDICATIONS:  On arrival to the floor, the patient was taking Protonix 40 mg per G-tube daily, saline nasal spray, ProMod fiber tube feeds, intravenous Flagyl 500 mg every eight hours, diltiazem drip, prednisolone eye drops 1% one drop both eyes at bedtime, digoxin 0.25 mg per G-tube, intravenous ceftriaxone 1 gram every 24 hours, and heparin drip.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, mildly distended, positive bowel sounds in all four quadrants, no rebound or guarding, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube in place.
Cardiology was consulted regarding rate control and they felt he would benefit from an atrial ablation with pacemaker placement.
This procedure was performed on [**2122-10-30**] without complications.
A dual chamber pacemaker was placed.
He was continued on diltiazem and amiodarone.
His beta blocker was restarted, which he tolerated well.
In general, his cardiac status was stable and he required no further additional rate control agents.
Pulmonary:  The patient was continued on levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
Neurology:  The patient's neurological status slowly resolved over the course of his stay, with increasing alertness, interaction and orientation.
However, he will require rehabilitation for his neurological issues.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient remained on tube feeds via his gastrostomy tube, which he tolerated well at 100 cc/hour, with occasional boluses of free water.
He will require follow-up from speech and swallow in the future to re-evaluate and see if he can begin to take oral supplements and food.
Rehabilitation:  The patient will require a rehabilitation stay.
He was seen by both physical therapy and occupational therapy, who felt that he would benefit significantly from rehabilitation therapy from both aspects, given his current inability to care for himself as well as his severely deconditioned status from a one month hospital stay.
