Interval ventricular shunt placement with mild decompression of the ventricles.
The intraventricular drain tip lies in the thalamus.
Ventriculostomy catheter terminates in the third ventricle with unchanged appearance of the known intraparenchymal hemorrhage and 9 mm of rightward midline shift.
Right scalp soft tissue swelling and fluid collection measuring 12 mm thick, likely secondary to recent ventriculostomy catheter revision.
====== Video Oropharyngeal Swallow ([**2182-2-8**]): IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate impairment of oral phase; however, there is no penetration or aspiration.
---- EEG ([**2182-3-9**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to an intermittent asymmetry between the two hemispheres, with loss of faster frequencies and more prominent delta slowing noted broadly over the left side.
He was also maintained normothermic and normoglycemic.
His blood pressure was somewhat difficult to control requiring metoprolol 100 TID, lisinopril 40mg daily, norvasc 10mg daily and HCTZ 25mg daily.
- upon arrival to the floors, multiple adjustments were made to her blood pressure medications and proper control was eventually obtained.
- Provigil was trialed with regard to his increasing somnolence, but there was no benefit from this.
He was also started on lexapro and psychiatry team was consulted.
Lexapro provided little benefit, and psychiatry believed that a lack of response to ritalin made one lean away from the diagnosis of depression and more toward a diffuse encephalopathic state entered after his large hemorrhage.
The drain was reopened and the patient was taken for a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placment.
3) The patient's decreased arousal prevented him from taking adequate nutrition.
A PEG tube was placed.
He was started on tube feeds.
He passed his speech and swallow study and was then started on PO feeds.
He had a tracheostomy performed to prevent aspiration.
He required oxygen via trachmask for a significant proportion of his stay.
Aphasia by itself can lead to depression especially if too many motor deficits elements given the frustration of not being able to communicate one's thoughts and feelings in words.
He was started on Lexapro, eventually up to 20 mg QD, but efficacy may not be evident until 6 - 8 weeks out.
Regarding activating medication like Provigil, it was of no effect and discontinued - as outlined above.
