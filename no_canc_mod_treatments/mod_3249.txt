[**2-19**] CXR FINDINGS: Compared with [**2193-2-16**], there has been interval placement of a left subclavian single-lead ICD with its tip at the right ventricular apex, in unremarkable position.
Image  quality is suboptimal due to poor acoustic windows but there is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with probable anterior, inferior, and anterolateral hypokinesis.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2189-12-4**], the inferior hypokinesis may be new.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal SVG-->OM in-stent restenosis with a 4.5 BMS.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 59 YO man with CAD s/p CABG and recent NSTEMI p/w CP and found to be in stable VT which responded to amiodarone.
When he initially presented to OSH was in stable VT - converted to NSR on amiodarone drip.
Now s/p ICD placement.
# Ischemia: history of CAD s/p CABG and recent NSTEMI.
Second set of cardiac enzymes indicate troponin leak [**1-25**] MI; s/p BMS to SVG-OM1 - continue ASA, plavix, [**Last Name (un) **] - holding beta blockers given h/o asthma and bronchospasm (BB poorly tolerated in the past) - holding statin and zetia given history of intolerance (severe mylagias); started gemfibrozil which he has tolerated well .
SBP dropped to the 70s in the ED, which repsonded to fluid boluses.
Received 500 cc NS boluses x 3 with increase in SBP to high 90s.
# Asthma: lungs with diffuse expiratory wheeze likely asthma vs cardiac wheeze - continue home regimen of singulair, Advair - ipratroprium nebs prn .
# H/O HTN: - continuing valsartan - hold norvasc and Dyazide since he's currently well-controlled  .
# Esophagitis: on omeprazole at home - continue PPI .
# PPX: heparin sc, bowel reg prn, ppi .
