Today, the baby is returned to [**Hospital3 1810**] for continued management of prematurity and complications of ileostomy.
Returned to the [**Hospital3 **] on [**1-21**] where he continued his management of prematurity.
He was maintained on caffeine     citrate during this time and did well.
He transitioned     to nasal cannula oxygen at 200 cc on day of life #44 for     5 days.
He returned to nasal prong CPAP because of     increased periodic breathing on day of life #49.
The endotracheal tube     was midway between the carinae and the thoracic inlet.
He has not     required pressors at this time.
He had a peripheral     arterial line placed in his left dorsalis pedis artery to     monitor his mean [**Month (only) **] pressures.
He had 1 episode of a mean [**Month (only) **] pressure in     the 60s earlier today, responding to a dose of fentanyl     for presumed discomfort.
On [**1-25**], secondary to     lethargy and a decreased urine output, a workup revealed     a serum sodium of 118, a serum potassium of 8.9;     necessitating a normal saline bolus and a sodium     replacement infusion.
He also received calcium gluconate     x 1 dose and an insulin infusion with concurrent high     glucose infusion to decrease his serum potassium.
It was reduced to half cc-for-cc replacement     over time.
The serum electrolytes continued to improve     on this half-volume replacement with half normal saline,     and he was transitioned off of his replacement on [**2-8**]; at which time oral sodium chloride and potassium     chloride supplements were started.
Also in relation to his fluids and     electrolytes, [**Known lastname **] was restarted on feeds on [**1-28**] after the electrolyte aberration and quickly advanced     to full volume.
Increasing calories on [**2-6**], was     tolerating continuous feeds of breast milk 30 with     Beneprotein.
This was made with 4 calories of human milk     fortifier, 4 calories of MCT, 2 calories of Polycose and     Beneprotein as well.
He transitioned to bolus slowly,     going from continuous to being fed over 3-1/2 hours; and     most recently tolerating bolus feeds over 2-1/2 hours.
Calories were reduced to 28 calories by eliminating the     Polycose due to increased [**Known lastname 9341**] output.
Total volume     was increased to 150 mL/kg, which also increased [**Known lastname 9341**]     output; so, the total fluids were trimmed to 140/kg of     breast milk 28 with Beneprotein over 2-1/2 hours.
In addition, on [**2-13**], Imodium     was added to [**Known lastname 9231**] regimen to help decrease his [**Known lastname 9341**]     output; and that was also well tolerated by [**Known lastname **].
He responded to a single     dose of subcutaneous insulin and has been euglycemic on a     decreased GIR as above.
Most recent set of electrolytes were at 11:00 a.m.     on [**3-2**]:  Sodium 134, potassium 3.6, chloride 101,     and CO2 of 29, glucose was 88.
He     received 7 days of ampicillin and cefotaxime.
On [**2-4**], he had a repeat sepsis eval secondary to his CVL     dressing becoming contaminated.
His CBC was benign, and he completed 48 hours     of vancomycin and cefotaxime.
He was started on     ampicillin, and gentamicin and clindamycin.
The ampicillin was discontinued on [**3-2**].
[**Name (NI) **] received transfusions on [**1-27**], on [**2-5**], on     [**2-28**].
On [**3-1**], twenty per kilo of packed red [**Month (only) **] cells.
Subsequent head ultrasounds performed at the [**Hospital3 **]     on [**1-29**] and [**2-19**] were considered to be     normal for his age.
On [**2-28**], because of the     acute abdominal process, [**Known lastname **] was started on bolus     doses of fentanyl at 2 mcg/kilo every 2 to 4 hours.
On     [**3-1**], was started on a 2 mcg/kilo per hour drip     with good affect, requiring occasional boluses for     procedural discomfort.
IMMUNIZATIONS RECEIVED:  Hepatitis B vaccine on [**1-30**], and a single dose of Synagis on [**2-20**].
