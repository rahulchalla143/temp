Admission Date:  [**2139-7-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2139-7-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2077-9-9**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Surgery, Blue Team  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old white woman with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, multiple sclerosis, and hypercholesterolemia who presents with lethargy and purulent discharge from her vagina.
At [**Hospital6 33**] the patient was resuscitated with intravenous fluids and given vancomycin, ceftazidime, and clindamycin.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Her home medications were Pravachol and digoxin.
A PA catheter as well as an arterial line were placed, and the patient was placed on high-dose penicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin.
A pressure PA catheter was not placed.
A central venous catheter was placed, and the patient was quickly transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Later in the same day (on [**2139-7-3**]), the patient was taken to the operating room and underwent an exploratory laparotomy, appendectomy, Hartmann and sigmoid colostomy, and opening of her right thigh including fasciotomy.
A PA catheter was then placed, and the patient was placed on intravenous antibiotics which included high-dose penicillin, clindamycin, and meropenem.
The patient also had to be placed on a dopamine drip and Levophed to maintain her blood pressure.
On [**7-5**], the patient's condition continued to deteriorate requiring the addition of epinephrine to maintain vascular and her blood pressure.
Also noted was that the patient's cardiac enzymes, and her MB fractions, as well as her troponin were noted to be significantly elevated.
At that point, a Quinton catheter in the patient's left femoral vein, and she began continuous venovenous hemofiltration (or CVVH).
The patient was then started on total parenteral nutrition, and she was also started very slowly on tube feeds.
She initially did not tolerate her tube feeds due to the fact that her feeding tube was not passed post pylorically.
However, after leaving the feeding tube in her stomach the patient spontaneously passed the feeding tube post pylorically and was able to tolerate some of the tube feeds that were given to her at a rate of 40 cc an hour.
The whole time, the patient was receiving total parenteral nutrition, and her clinical condition appeared to improve slightly.
After multiple transfusions of platelets, the patient had likely developed anti-platelet antibody and was able to continually drop her platelets despite multiple transfusions.
However, despite her platelets dropping to as low as 11, the patient's hematocrit remained relatively stable and did not require large amounts of blood transfusions.
Her base pressors were reduced only to dopamine renally dosed.
Although, the patient's heart rate spontaneously returned to her baseline, her blood pressure remained low requiring increasing her dopamine drip from an initial renal dose to up to 10, even as high as 15.
Her blood pressure became more labile, dropping spontaneously to the 80s and requiring increases in her pressors.
Despite having the patient on continuous venovenous hemofiltration, her acidosis did not improve.
The fresh frozen plasma was given since the patient suddenly had become coagulopathic and her PT went up to as high as 26 with an INR going up a high as 5.
