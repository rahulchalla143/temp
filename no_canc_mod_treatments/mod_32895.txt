PROCEDURE: Right vertebral arteriogram, right common carotid arteriogram, right internal carotid arteriogram, left vertebral arteriogram, left common carotid arteriogram, left internal carotid arteriogram, and left external carotid arteriogram.
The discussed risks included stroke, loss of vision and/or speech which may be temporary or permanent, injury to blood vessels, and possible treatment with stents and coils if needed.
The patient was brought to the interventional neuroradiology suite and placed on a biplane table in the supine position.
Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a micropuncture kit with 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate for local anesthesia.
A 5 French vascular sheath was placed over the wire and connected to a saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units and 500 cc of saline) with a continuous drip.
Through the sheath, a 5 French [**Doctor Last Name **] II catheter was introduced and connected to a continuous saline infusion (mixed with heparin 1000 units and 1000 cc of saline).
The following vessels were selectively catheterized and arteriograms were performed from the following locations: Right vertebral artery, right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, left vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left external carotid artery, and left internal carotid artery.
After review of the films, the catheter and sheath were withdrawn.
Hemostasis was obtained using an Angio-Seal device.
RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY: The right vertebral artery and the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery appear normal.
RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: Cervical, petrous, cavernous and supraclinoid segments of the internal carotid artery are normal.
LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: Cervical, petrous, cavernous, and supraclinoid segments of the internal carotid artery are normal.
Manual compression views of the cervical carotid artery were not performed to visualize the anterior communicating artery.
Diffuse fine prominence of interstitial markings could reflect chronic pulmonary disease, increased pulmonary venous pressure, or both.
Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 19 gauge single wall needle under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine.
Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to the saline infusion (mixed with epinephrine 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a continuous drip.
Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced and connected to the continuous saline infusion.
After review of the films, the catheter and the sheath were withdrawn and pressure was applied on the groin until hemostasis was obtained.
The procedure was uneventful and the patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
Moderate sedation was obtained using 15 mcg of Fentanyl and 1 mg of Versed.
Nimodipine was started on hosp day one and will continue for a total of 21 days/.
She was transistioned from Dilantin to Keppra for sz prohylaxis.
She had a UTI that was treated with bactrim and follow up analysis was negative.
