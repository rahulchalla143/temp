Admission Date:  [**2133-12-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2134-1-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2097-2-22**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 36 year old male who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on [**2133-12-18**].
MEDICATIONS: Zantac 150 mg twice a day.
Ursodiol 300 mg twice a day.
Sodium was 135; potassium of 3.3; chloride 96; bicarbonate 20; BUN 12; creatinine 1.0; blood sugar 157.
Given his epigastric pain with unclear etiology, he was admitted for hydration and observation.
He was maintained on Kefzol postoperatively.
He was, thus, started on a heparin drip.
Therefore, it was decided to stop the heparin drip and get a stat head CT as this examination was concerning for bleed.
It was noted, however, that his platelet count had fallen from his admission level of 186 down to 64, which presumptively diagnosed him wit heparin induced thrombocytopenia and his anticoagulation was switched to Loperidine with a goal PTT of 2 to 2.5 times normal.
Vancomycin in addition to the Levo-Flagyl that he was already being given.
Approximately 10 to 15 minutes after intubation, he became hypotensive and bradycardiac and approximately 3 minutes of CPR were started on him before complete return of his vitals.
This was achieved with success, removing clot from both the right and the left vessels, with return of perfusion in both lungs.
It was at this time that we were made aware of the bilateral adrenal hemorrhages, in addition to pressures in a bicarbonate drip, he was given stress dose steroids.
He was also being given nitrous oxide through his ventilator.
He was presumed to be going through advanced stages of heparin induced thrombocytopenia with multiple thromboses.
He did, however, continue to have fevers and so we expanded his antibiotic regimen to include Vancomycin, Zosyn, Flagyl and Fluconazole.
As his kidney function worsened to a creatinine of six, his Loperidine was held and he was given intermittent Loperidine as indicated.
He also had an element of anticoagulation due to his liver failure.
All of his sedatives were stopped on the morning of [**1-2**].
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
Bilateral pulmonary embolisms, status post pulmonary thromboembolectomy.
Status post laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.
