Evaluation of the prevertebral soft tissues is limited due to endotracheal and orogastric tube placement.
CXR ([**5-7**]): There is an endotracheal tube and a feeding tube whose distal tip is not well seen.
DIAGNOSTIC C. CATH (right heart) [**2183-7-22**] (done [**1-11**] NSVT on [**6-17**] stress test): Left dominant heart.
40-50% stenoses at mid and distal LAD.
EXERCISE STRESS TEST/MR SPECT [**2183-12-28**] for atypical CP: Excellent exercise capacity (15 mets).
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  The pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified with intravenous contrast to the subsegmental levels without filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolism.
An endotracheal tube appears appropriately positioned.
An orogastric tube is also seen coursing through the esophagus and terminating in the stomach.
A right-sided chest tube is in place with the tip terminating posterior to be lung which is inadequately positioned.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is relatively decompressed by a Foley catheter in place.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There are multiple displaced fractures involving the right anterior second, third, fourth, fifth and a minimally displaced fracture involving the right anterolateral sixth rib.
A left-sided PICC line tip terminates in the low SVC.
An enteric catheter courses into the stomach.
A 2 cm CC x 4.3 cm TV hyperdense lesion at the left liver capsular edge (401B:25) was hypodense on the portal venous phase of prior imaging studies.
An abdominal MRI is required for further characterization when the patient's acute issues have stabalized.
An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating at the level of the clavicles.
An orogastric tube is in place.
A left-sided PICC line is seen with the tip terminating in the low SVC.
Calcification of the coronary arteries is noted with a possible stent in the left anterior descending artery.
Multifocal consolidations have coalesced to predominantly bibasilar consolidations with air bronchograms (2:43).
An enteric feeding tube is in place within the stomach.
The urinary bladder is decompressed by a Foley catheter with a locule of air in the nondependent portion of the bladder dome consistent with Foley placement.
The rectum and sigmoid colon are mildly distended with stool but otherwise unremarkable.
Pre- and para-vertebral soft tissues appear unremarkable.
[**5-19**] MRI HEAD AND CSPINE: CONCLUSION:  Hyperintense lesions in the medulla and upper cervical cord, not detectable on diffusion images.
[**5-24**] VIDEO SWALLOW STUDY FINDINGS:  Video swallow fluoroscopy was performed in conjunction with speech and swallow division.
There was aspiration with thin and nectar consistencies, which improved on chin tuck.
IMPRESSION:  Mild aspiration of thin and nectar consistencies which improved with chin tuck.
Pharyngeal residue with pureed consistency.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old male with coronary artery disease (CAD) status post stent to proximal LAD in [**2182**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was found down on side of road in ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest s/p resuscitation and intubation.
He underwent cardiac cath with placement of DES to mid-LAD, and post-cath arctic sun cooling protocol.
He had an ICD placed before discharge for a primary vfib arrest.
His course was complicated by rib fractures and resultant right pneumothorax requiring chest tube and ventilator-associated psuedomonas pneumonia.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Primary Vfib arrest: Although he had a history of CAD and is s/p drug eluding stent (DES) to proximal left anterior descending (LAD) in [**2182**], he had been doing well prior to this incident.
He was found down after riding a bike home, requiring multiple shocks for ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest in the field and endotracheal intubation for respiratory failure.
Arctic Sun Cooling protocol was initiated in the ED on arrival.
He was placed on neuromuscular blockade (cisatracurium) as well as fentanyl and versed.
After rewarming, he remained became mildly hypertensive so he was restarted on home antihypertensives, which included metoprolol and lisinopril (takes captopril at home).
He began to trend towards fevers (see below) so he was continued on artic sun device which kept him maintained at 37'C with cooling for an additional 48 hours.
He was not extubatable after warming so tube feeds were initiated and he was transitioned to fentanyl/propofol.
He was treated for MI with plavix 75mg daily, aspirin 325mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, metoprolol tartrate 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Sedation was changed to precedex nearing extubatation.
Since he may have had a primary vfib arrest (due to previous MI in [**2182**] and structural heart disease), he was a candidate for ICD placement during this admission.
He had an ICD placed on [**2187-5-25**] and tolerated the procedure well.
CXR the following day confirmed lead placement and interrogation by the EP team showed that it was functioning well.
He should keep dressing on for three days, take keflex 500 mg 4x/d for 3 days, and follow-up in [**Hospital **] clinic.
CXR revealed right apical pneumothorax and trauma surgery placed a pigtail catheter on [**2187-5-8**].
Initially, this tube drained air and serosanguinous fluid and repeat CXR showed improvement in the pneumothorax.
However, the following day his ventilator oxygenation requirements did not improve.
This showed a large persistent right pneumothorax which was layered anteriorly and thus not visible on portable CXRs and the apical pigtail catheter was inadequately placed to drain.
Trauma surgery returned and placed a right chest tube on [**2187-5-9**] with repeat CT chest the following day showing resolution of pneumothorax.
He ventilator dependence and mild hypotension improved following chest tube placement.
When he became hypoxic with increasing vent requirements, he was started on empiric coverage for VAP in addition to treatment of pneumothorax as above.
Pseudomonas was pan-sensitive so he was narrowed to ciprofloxacin only.
However, he remained febrile so vanc and cefepime were added back on.
Flagyl was added to his regimen on [**5-15**] for anaerobic coverage given fevers and concern for aspiration.
Vancomycin and ciprofloxacin were subsequently weaned off and he completed a 8 day course of cefepime and metronidazole from [**5-16**], which was the last day of positive sputum cultures.
He was transitioned to precedex with apparent improvement in mental status and was extubated shortly thereafter.
To improve his sleep/wake cycle in the setting of sundowning, he was started on seroquel 25mg po qhs prn for insomnia and delirium.
He was followed by the trauma surgery team but they did not think he had any indications for surgery to fix the flail chest.
Chest tube placed on hospital day 4 as above for new onset pneumothorax.
His C-spine was cleared with CT neck on admission and C-collar was removed per trauma surgery recommendations.
# Diabetes mellitus type 2: On insulin at home, complicated by peripheral neuropathy and proteinuria (baseline creatinine 0.9 in [**2183**]).
He required insulin drip while being cooled due to delayed absorption.
Transitioned to long-acting insulin plus SSI once pt was warmed.
Sugars again became difficult to control in the setting of continous tube feedings and infection.
He again necessitated insulin drip before weaning to lantus with HISS.
Regimen on discharge included glargine 23 units at bedtime and a sliding scale insulin.
This should be titrated based on QID fingersticks.
# Bladder atony:   Similarly, he had bladder atony after the foley was removed (in place 18-20 days) but eventually recovered his ability to urinate.
# Hypertension (HTN)/ hypotension: Initially normotensive on admission to ED and CCU s/p cardiac arrest and resuscitation.
Antihypertensives including metoprolol and lisinopril were restarted when patients pressured had stabilized following treatment of ptx.
On discharge his regimen consisted of lisinopril 10 mg daily, metoprolol succinate 100 mg daily.
# Hyperlipidemia (HLD): He was taking simvastatin at home but was transitioned to high dose atorvastatin given his acute MI.
Discharged on atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
He should have these rechecked in a month or so and also should have a f/u MRI of his liver for nondescript findings on CT.  # H/o depression: not currently being treated for this, but has taken meds in the past.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - For his ICD: He should keep dressing on for three days and then leave his steri strips on until they fall off by themselves, take keflex 500 mg 4x/d for 3 days, and follow-up in [**Hospital **] clinic in one week.
-Follow-up needed for Liver lesion seen on Ultrasound- recommended a nonemergent MRI to further characterize - recheck CK and AST/ALT after stabilized as an outpatient to ensure no toxicity from high dose atorvastatin - To improve his sleep/wake cycle in the setting of sundowning, he was started on seroquel 25mg po qhs prn for insomnia and delirium.
