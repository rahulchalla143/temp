Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet.
Smoking causes narrowing of your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation.
Since a reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the bad cholesterol).
We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be easy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new attitude.
