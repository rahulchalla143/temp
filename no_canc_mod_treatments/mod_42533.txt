[**Location (un) 2611**] coma scale was 4, 5 and 6 for a total of 15.
Chest tube in fissure.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, where he continued to do well with a chest tube in place.
Physical therapy was started on that day, and the patient only was limited by a high amount of pain, for which the Acute Pain service was consulted and recommended Oxycontin 20 mg by mouth twice a day and codeine 5 to 10 mg for breakthrough pain.
Oxycodone was increased to 20 mg by mouth three times a day, with Toradol, and a morphine patient-controlled analgesia was also added on to the patient's pain regimen.
On hospital day six, the patient was placed on water-seal.
The following hospital day, cultures grew out 4+ gram-positive cocci and 3+ gram-negative rods, at which time he was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin.
The chest tube over the previous two days had had minimal drainage.
Based on the history and hospital course, Thoracic Surgery thought that the concern is for a blood collection in the left chest which would require thoracoscopy and decortication for evacuation and lung re-expansion.
If the effusion was simply fluid, it could potentially be drained by Interventional Radiology.
CT scan done on [**2157-11-7**] showed that there was a left-sided chest tube with associated left hydropneumothorax.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2157-11-7**], where a VATS and decortication and a placement of a chest tube was completed.
Postoperatively, the patient did well, and the chest tube that was placed intraoperatively was put to suction.
His temperature subsequently decreased, and then x-ray done on [**2157-11-11**] showed that there was no evidence of pneumothorax, and there was a left lower lobe atelectasis and effusion, for which the patient was on continued incentive spirometry and chest physical therapy.
The patient was discharged on [**2157-11-12**] in good condition, with pain medication and instructions to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**].
Status post pneumothorax complicated by loculated effusion 2.
Oxycodone sustained release 20 mg by mouth three times a day 2.
Percocet one to two tablets by mouth every four to six hours as needed for severe pain  FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in two weeks.
