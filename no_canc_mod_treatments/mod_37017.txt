Admission Date:  [**2105-12-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2106-1-5**]   Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, who presents for elective catheterization in the setting of worsening shortness of breath.
He does not note any chest pain, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, lightheadedness.
He now comes in for elective cardiac catheterization.
History is also notable for chronic renal insufficiency and, thus, he will require close observation and optimization prior to catheterization.
Coronary artery disease, as outlined above.
Atrial fibrillation, status post pacer placement in [**2103**].
Coumadin 5 mg p.o.q.d.(held).
Lasix 80 mg p.o.b.i.d.
NPH 50 units p.o.q.a.m.
Regular insulin 14 units subcutaneously q.a.m.
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.q.d.
Accupril 10 mg p.o.q.d.
Toprol XL 25 mg p.o.q.d.
Neck was supple with jugulovenous pulsation at 10-cm.
He was admitted for elective catheterization.
He was continued on aspirin and beta blocker.
He was briefly transferred to the Coronary Care Unit, where a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed which showed normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, but elevated right sided pressures.
Diuresis was held at that point.
The patient was taken off an Ace inhibitor and placed on Hydralazine for afterload reduction secondary to his chronic renal insufficiency.
At cardiac catheterization on [**1-4**], the patient was found to have elevated left and right side filling pressures, as well as pulmonary artery hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure 59/21; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 21).
In the meantime, the patient is continued on Hydralazine and nitrates for afterload reduction, as well as Lasix 80 mg p.o.b.i.d.
PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient's Coumadin was held while he was hospitalized.
He should be started back on his Coumadin at his usual dose of 5 mg p.o.q.h.s.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had a Foley catheter placed for fluid monitoring.
He was found to have a urinary tract infection and Levofloxacin renally dosed was begun for a five-day course.
He was given Mucomyst and hydration before his catheterization.
Following the catheterization, the patient was placed on Hydralazine and nitrates for afterload reduction.
He was continued on NPH and a regular insulin sliding scale.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had a hematocrit drop following the catheterization and he was transfused three units of packed red blood cells.
The patient also had a drop in his platelet count to a level of 90 while on heparin in the Intensive Care Unit.
The heparin was discontinued and the platelets rose back to his baseline of 150,000.
He will require [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation as he was seen by the Department of Physical Therapy and felt not to be ambulating his baseline and safe to return home.
The patient's INR, potassium, BUN and creatinine should be followed closely until stable.
Status post coronary catheterization.
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.q.d.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.q.d.
Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d.
Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.b.i.d.
NPH insulin 25 units subcutaneously q.a.m.
Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o.q.d.
Hydralazine 10 mg p.o.q.i.d.
Imdur 30 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Lasix 80 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Coumadin 5 mg p.o.q.h.s.
