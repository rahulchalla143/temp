He underwent a mitral valve repair with a 26 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] ring and a quadrangular repair by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
He left the operating room in normal sinus rhythm, rate of 88 on a propofol and Neo-Synephrine drip.
On postoperative day two, the patient experienced some breakthrough atrial fibrillation above his paced rate and an EP consult was gotten.
EP recommendations though were to start and continue Heparin and Coumadin.
Keep him on the Coumadin for 4-6 weeks for anticoagulation.
On the same day, he was transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 26.9.
On [**9-27**], postoperative day five, the patient experienced several episodes of atrial fibrillation with a repeat EP consult, which recommended beta blockers for rate control and again Coumadin therapy for at least six weeks.
Heparin was D/C'd, decided it was not necessary and amiodarone was not recommended at this time.
Following atenolol doses on postoperative day six, heart rate dropped to the 30s and 40s with no symptoms and blood pressures stable 110s/50s, and atenolol was D/C'd.
The patient continued even after the atenolol was D/C'd to be in a junctional rhythm with episodes of his heart rate dropping to the 30s and 40s again asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable with blood pressure 100-120s/50s-60s.
Patient also had symptoms of urinary retention throughout his hospital stay, which has [**Last Name 19301**] problem for him in the past as he does have benign prostatic hypertrophy status post TURP x2.
