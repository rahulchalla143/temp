The operation proceeded without complication.
Her post-op course was dominated with pain control issues, requiring initial stay in the PACU extending through the night of POD 0 into POD 1 after which she was transferred to the surgical ICU for pain management issues.
Pertinents of her hospitalization, by systems:  Neurologically: Pain control continued to be an issue through the initial portion of her hospital stay.
She was followed closely by the acute pain service - an epidural was placed and she was started on her regimen of fentanyl patch/methadone/neurontin.
Her epidural was removed on POD 3 without incident and she was transitioned to a dilaudid PCA then eventually oral dilaudid medication at a rate of [**2-25**] mg PO every 6 hours.
Psych: Ms. [**Known lastname 2808**] was seen by the psychiatry service to assess for acute delirium on POD 4 after alleged refusal to take medication and reported uncooperative behavior with her care.
Cardiovascular: no issues  Respiratory: The patient continued to require 3-4 liters oxygen via nasal cannula throughout her hospital stay.
Based on previous office visits and per patient history, this was assessed to be baseline for the patient who has arrangements for home oxygen therapy.
GU: Foley cathether was removed at midnight after the epidural was removed on POD 3.
Endo: Ms. [**Known lastname 51974**] fingersticks were found to be elevated on her existing sliding scale.
She was restarted on synthroid during this hospitalization.
