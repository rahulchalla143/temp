Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
As pt continued to be febrile with climbing WBC, his hemodialysis line was removed and thought to be the culprit infectious source as she developed rigors with removal.
