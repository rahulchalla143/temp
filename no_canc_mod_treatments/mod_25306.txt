Patient was given haldol 5 IV with minimal effect then switched to geodon 10 * 3 with good effect.
Neurosurg and trauma surgery were consulted and both felt that the patient was stable and inappropriate for their services so the patient was admitted to the MICU for continued monitoring of his agitation.
Admission complicated by PEG tube [**6-7**].

Multiple foci of magnetic susceptibility are noted adjacent to the subdural collection and also in the left cerebral hemisphere as described above, likely consistent with microhemorrhages, possible slow flow is demonstrated in the right insular region, possibly related with brain edema.
Unchanged left temporal bone fracture with opacities in the left mastoid air cells.
Initially admitted on [**2193-6-20**] to the micu for increased nursing needs and intubation for MRI, then transferred to the floor.
This was difficult to control, but eventually was controlled with haldol which was titrated down to 2.5mg qhs before discharge, with neurology recommendations to continue for 2 more nights post-discharge and eventually switch to seroquel.
Pt was also started on depakote 500 mg po bid, citalopram 20mg daily, and trazodone 50mg qhs for sleep per neurology recs.
His Trazadone was eventually decreased to 25mg QHS with continued good response.
He was not able to undergo LP due to concerns for mildline shift on head imaging.
He was started on Acyclovir 800mg IV q8H for empiric treatment of HSV enecephalitis, which was  transitioned to PO, and he completed a 10 day course.
He was started on Vancomycin.
His vancomycin was stopped on [**2193-6-27**].
He was started on Propranolol 20mg PO TID per neurology recommendations, which was increased to 40 mg po TID once he got to the floor.
His tremor remained but was stable throughout the remainder of admission, and he was instructed to continue his propranolol at 40mg TID after discharge.
Neurology felt that there was likely more of a behavioral component to his posturing as opposed to a neurological change.
#Nutrition: He was started on tube feeds through a PEG briefly in the MICU, but this caused him to have diarrhea.
Tube feeds were held.
Once he was transferred to the floor, tube feeds were then restarted on [**7-2**].
He has tolerated the feeds well, and was instructed to continue this.
