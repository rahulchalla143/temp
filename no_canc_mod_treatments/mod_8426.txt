HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery x 2, aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension with a prolonged complicated recent hospital course at [**Hospital1 1444**] from [**1-30**] to [**2104-3-26**].
On [**2-5**], the patient underwent redo coronary artery bypass grafting with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to the diagonal, and saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending coronary artery.
The patient's postoperative course was complicated by hypotension requiring pressors, failure to extubate, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate with failure to cardiovert, and acutely worsening congestive heart failure with a decreased ejection fraction of less than 20% (prior to coronary artery bypass grafting the patient's ejection fraction was 50%).
The patient returned for relook cardiac catheterization with noted acute graft closure and underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, and saphenous vein graft to the diagonal.
Post cardiac catheterization the patient developed acute renal failure with volume overload requiring CVVH, worsening heart failure requiring intra-aortic balloon pump complicated by rectus sheath hematoma, and ventricular fibrillation arrest requiring amiodarone and lidocaine.
The patient again failed to extubate on multiple occasions and a tracheostomy was placed on [**3-2**].
The patient also underwent PEG tube placement on [**3-4**] and PICC line placement on [**3-7**].
An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed on [**3-11**] with dual pacer (the delay in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement was secondary to multiple infections throughout the hospitalization including yeast graft harvest site, wound infection, Enterobacter bacteremia, C. difficile colitis, and yeast cystitis).
A repeat echocardiogram demonstrated a thrombus on the aortic valve anterior leaflet.
The patient was started on TPA for a total of 24 hours with significant improvement in her aortic valve gradient.
The patient was eventually discharged to rehabilitation on [**2104-3-26**].
Since discharge the patient has remained hemodynamically stable without further episodes of ventricular fibrillation and the patient has been undergoing a progressive weaning trial from the ventilator with signs of success.
The patient received one dose of vancomycin the morning of admission while at rehabilitation.
Of note, the patient has been off diuretics since [**4-7**] for prerenal azotemia.
Status post right bilateral carotid endarterectomy (left, [**2102-7-26**]; right [**2101-9-20**]).
Coronary artery disease with three-vessel disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2092**] and redo coronary artery bypass grafting on [**2104-2-5**].
Repeat catheterization on [**2104-2-9**] with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting to the LIMA-LAD-SVG-diagonal.
Echocardiogram in [**2104-2-16**] had an ejection fraction of less than 20%, severely depressed left ventricular systolic function, severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and bileaflet aortic valve without aortic regurgitation and normal gradient.
History of ventricular fibrillation arrest between [**2-18**] and [**3-13**] status post ICD placement with dual pacer [**3-11**].

Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, warm and well perfused, with 1+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally, left lower extremity thigh wound at the graft incision packed with occlusive dressing and no purulent drainage.
Chem-7 with a sodium of 131, potassium 3.8, chloride 93, bicarbonate 28, BUN 70, creatinine 1.2, and glucose 455 (status post two amps of D50 for a glucose of 33).
Per electrophysiology and CT surgery recommendations, the patient was taken to the operating room for ICD box removal.
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit given her ventilator dependence.
The patient continued on vancomycin dosed by level less than 15 per infectious disease recommendations, and is currently on day four of vancomycin.
The patient will continue on vancomycin for a total of a 14-day course.
A PICC line was placed on [**4-15**] for delivery of intravenous antibiotics.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was monitored on telemetry post ICD removal with frequent premature ventricular contractions and no evidence of recurrent ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
The patient was restarted on low-dose aspirin, statin (with lipids:  total cholesterol 221, LDL 147, HDL 45, and triglycerides 113), and low-dose enalapril for known coronary artery disease (A low-dose beta blocker was not started during the hospitalization secondary to congestive heart failure exacerbation.
However, it is the team's recommendation to start a low-dose beta blocker for known coronary artery disease with better control of the patient's volume status).
The patient remained anticoagulated for aortic valve replacement.
The patient's Coumadin was held during the hospitalization with the initiation of heparin at an INR of less than 2.5.
On hospital day number three, with an INR of 2.2 and four units of fresh frozen plasma, the patient's ICD leads were removed by electrophysiology without complications.
Echocardiogram during the procedure and repeat echocardiogram several hours later was without evidence of pericardial effusion.
The electrophysiology service plans to replace the patient's ICD in the near future after completion of antibiotics for infection.
Pulmonary:  The patient continued on the ventilator at her prior vent settings of pressure support 15, PEEP 5, and FIO2 of 40% with adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
Endocrine:  On admission, the patient developed refractory hypoglycemia presumably secondary to recent dose of glipizide in the setting of decreased PEG tube intake with nausea and vomiting.
The patient received D10 per IV and D25 per PEG tube with maintenance of normoglycemia.
The patient's blood glucose normalized after approximately 24 hours off dextrose supplements.
The patient's glipizide was restarted on discharge.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was intolerant of tube feeds early in the hospital course secondary to persistent nausea and vomiting, despite Reglan and Zofran.
On hospital day number three the patient's tube feeds were restarted at 10 cc an hour and advanced slowly without further nausea and vomiting.
The patient was started on ProMod with fiber with a goal of 40 cc per hour.
The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells on hospital day one with an appropriate bump in her hematocrit.
The etiology of the drop was unclear with the exception of possible blood loss during the ICD lead removal on [**4-14**].
The patient is to require one unit transfusion of packed red blood cells.
The patient underwent PICC line placement on [**4-15**] prior to discharge.
