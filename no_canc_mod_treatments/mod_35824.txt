Admission Date:  [**2167-12-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-12-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-8-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: # Left hip fracture s/p fall # Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: # Arterial line placement # Right internal jugular central venous line placement # Endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: 78F h/o COPD, presumed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis on home O2, CAD s/p MI, CHF and Afib, presented with L hip fracture s/p fall [**1-9**] lightheadedness after transitioning from sitting to standing while doing laundry on the day of admission.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was hypoxic to the mid 80s with venti mask 50%, 12 L; she was placed on 100% NRB with O2 sats rising to 100% (at baseline, pt is 90% on 5L O2 NC).
Pt reported a sensation of midsternum "heartburn" which quickly resolved, and stated that her pain during her past MI felt more like pressure and was different than this sensation.
Pt received 2L NS, fentanyl & morphine for pain, as well as aspirin.
Ortho was consulted about her L hip fracture as seen on x-ray and recommended ORIF as soon as medically stable.
Pt was therefore admitted for further work-up of hypoxic respiratory distress, EKG changes, and consideration for surgical repair of her L hip fracture.
Past Medical History: # Cardiovascular --Diastolic heart failure: EF 60% --Atrial fibrillation --MR [**Name13 (STitle) 109519**] --CAD: h/o LCx stenosis on prior cardiac cath --PFO --HTN --Hyperlipidemia --Mesenteric ischemia --Renal artery stenosis s/p R renal artery stent --PVD --Pulmonary hypertension --CVA .
# Pulmonary --Home oxygen 5L --COPD --Presumed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis stable RML lung nodule and anterior mediastinal soft tissue density .
Pt was intubated and received 20min CPR, after which she was placed on epinephrine and norepinephrine gtt; per verbal report to this author, pt had also received NS fluid resuscitation.
Pt was returned to the MICU, during which time she was ultimately placed on four pressors (norepinephrine, phenylephrine, dobutamine, and vasopressin), as well as NS boluses for hemodynamic support, and increased FiO2 for respiratory support.
Given her poor prognosis, family members decided to withdraw care; pt expired within minutes of withdrawing pressor and ventilatory support.
Given h/o pulmonary disease and cardiac disease, MICU team discussed with the patient about risks associated with surgical repair, specifically perioperative MI and difficult post-op extubation.
Pt stated her understanding of this risk, but that her quality of life would be very diminished if she did not undergo surgical repair.
During a family meeting on [**12-22**] AM, all family members present concurred that surgical repair was desired, and stated their understanding of pt's high perioperative risk.
# CAD s/p MI: Lateral [**Known lastname **] depressions on admission EKG resolved on repeat EKGs with troponin T elevated to 0.10, possibly indicating some cardiac demand.
Pt improved rapidly overnight, indicating possible reversible cardiac etiology as also evidenced on EKG changes.
After coding during induction for surgery, pt was intubated and received CPR.
Pt's status was changed back to DNR, and she was later made CMO after her family decided to withdraw care based on her poor prognosis.
Pt expired minutes after pressors and ventilatory support were withdrawn.
