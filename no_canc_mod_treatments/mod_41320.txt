?Take your pain medication as instructed; you may find it best if taken in the morning when you wake-up for morning stiffness, and before bed for sleeping discomfort.
?Do not take any anti-inflammatory medications such as Motrin, Advil, Aspirin, and Ibuprofen etc.
?Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation.
We recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
?Please return to the office in [**7-10**] days (from date of surgery) for removal of your sutures.
