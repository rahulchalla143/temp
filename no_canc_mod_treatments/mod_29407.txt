[**2-7**] Flexible bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an unfortunate 24 y/o male with severe mental retardation and history of tracheobronchomalacia whose tracheostomy tube fell out at home.
He was seen in the [**Hospital3 2783**] emergency department, where the tube was unable to be reinserted secondary to stenosis of the tracheostomy, so he was intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for repalcement of trach tube.
Per father, at baseline,   patient has spastic movements of his arms and legs.
He has   about 3 seizures per day, which consist of his "arms and mouth    stiffening," and twitching movements of his mouth.

Left mainstem bronchial stent and vagal nerve stimulator are unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Repositioning of endotracheal tube which is now below thoracic inlet 4-5 cm above the carina  *****[**2199-2-6**] OPERATIVE REPORT: PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory failure.
PROCEDURES:  Flexible bronchoscopy and revision of tracheostomy site and replacement of a 7.0 [**Last Name (un) 295**] adjustable tracheostomy tube.
INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 23-year-old gentleman who has tracheal stenosis and tracheomalacia and has been dependent on a tracheostomy tube.
He had been intubated endotracheally from the mouth and in the interim his tracheostomy site closed.
Therefore, he returns to the operating room for revision of the site.
I did flexible bronchoscopy through the endotracheal tube and I could see that there was a fair amount of granulation tissue at the left mainstem bronchus.
We then dilated with a hemostat the previous tracheostomy site.
We placed these under direct bronchoscopic vision so as not to injure the posterior tracheal wall.
I then bronchoscoped through the trache tube and saw that it was approximately 4 cm above the carina.
INDICATION:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] tracheostomy revision and was found to have left main stem bronchial obstruction.
Following this, the procedure was terminated and the bronchoscope was withdrawn.
The patient tolerated the procedure without any complications.
***** [**2199-2-13**] PICC LINE PLACEMENT: PICC line placement CLINICAL INDICATION: Bacteremia and pneumonia.
TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance.
A peel-away sheath was then placed over the guidewire and a 4 french single-lumen PICC line measuring 7 cm in length was placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the axillary vein under fluoroscopic guidance.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
IMPRESSION: Complete occlusion of the distal right subclavian vein with ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided right brachial PICC line with final internal length of 7 cm and the tip positioned in the axillary vein.
If more permanent venous access is desired, central access after vein mapping can be considered.
Thus on [**2-6**] he was taken to the OR, serial dilations of the stoma were performed, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 295**] tracheostomy tube was inserted.
A discussion was conducted with his family, and the decision was made not to intervene on the stenosis.
On [**2199-2-8**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 28316**] a fever to 104 degrees, so was pain cultured and started on empiric antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime.
His respiratory and blood cultures grew out pseudomonas that was sensitive to ciprofloaxin and cefepime, so the Vancomycin was discontinued.
A PICC line was attempted on his R side but could not be advanced past the axillary vein secondary to occlusion of the R subclavian.
