7) Recurrent PNA (B/L MRSA PNA in [**2162**]) 8) H/O Dental Abscess, 9) Recent Oral/Esophageal HSV-1 and Candidiasis 10) S/P Appendectomy 1) S/P Tonsillectomy.
CXR [**2-20**]:  1) No interval change in position of Swan-Ganz catheter tip.
A thick-walled gallbladder containing debris and stones, thought to be manifestation of hypoproteinemia and adjacent ascites rather than cholecystitis.
Although possibly due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema, superimposed process such as aspiration or infectious pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
IDENTIFICATION PERFORMED ON CULTURE # [**Numeric Identifier 43914**] FROM [**2165-2-26**].

On arrival to the CCU, the patient had an NG tube, IJ central line with swan-ganz catheter, and arterial line placed for closer hemodynamic monitoring.
Briefly, however, the patient was diuresed and maintained on inotropic support.
General surgery was consulted and recommended NG tube, NPO, and treatment of her CHF - the mesenteric ischemia was presumed secondary to low forward flow.
She was maintained on levaquin and flagyl throughout the hospitalization for prophylaxis against bowel organism transudation across the bowel wall.
3) CHF:  On admission, milrinone was started for inotropic support, and she was started on lasix and natrecor for diuresis.
After a few days of milrinone she unfortunately developed an atrial tachycardia that was not controlled despite lopressor, which dropped her blood pressure.
Her cardiac index, however, continued to fall, and as a last resort she was also started on nitroprusside for afterload reduction.
A code discussion was held between the patient and husband, and the patient decided to be made comfort measures only.
Her swan and arterial line were pulled at this time and resited, and vancomycin was begun.
Blood cultures at this time grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] and she was started on caspofungin.
5) SLE/Sjogren's:  The patient was maintained on her outpatient dose of 5 mg prednisone daily.
6) Nutrition:  This was a problem for Mrs. [**Known lastname 43915**], as she could not take POs, and we were hesitant to start TPN given her poor urine output and goal of diuresis.
