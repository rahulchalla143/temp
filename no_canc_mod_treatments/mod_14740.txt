Findings are most consistent with an infectious process, and PCP and other opportunistic pathogens should be considered given the patient's immunosuppressed status.
CTA showed upper lobe infiltrates and pt was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including Bactrim for possible PCP.
Sputum was negative for PCP and Bactrim was discontinued.
Pt briefly required BIPAP to  support oxygenation while awake but was quickly weaned to NC oxygen and maintained sats in low 90s.
Pt was noted to desat when sleeping thought likely due to apneic episodes and she was offered BiPAP as tolerated when sleeping.
Pt was explained that she will need an outpt sleep study in order to qualify for bipap machine at home.
Ultimately, pt was switched to Levofloxacin 750mg daily to complete a 10 day course of treatment for community acquired pneumonia.
PT was consulted and her ambulatory sats improved and pt was encouraged to continue with home PT & albuterol/atrovent nebs as needed for wheezing and SOB.
Pt was offered BIPAP at night for significant desaturations that occured when she was sleeping but was non-compliant.
HIV viral load is <50 and pt was continued on outpt HAART regimen while in house.
Pt was also noted to have an outbreak of HSV2 genital lesions, this was treated empirically with Acyclovir for a 7 day course and symptoms/lesions resolved.
The methadone dose was decreased and pt was continued at Methadone 45mg TID with oxycontin increased to 30mg [**Hospital1 **] and Oxycodone 5-15mg prn severe breakthrough pain.
The goal is for the patient to be weaned slowly from methadone given that this pain regimen has not been very effective for her and she had signs of prolonged QT on admission likely due to her methadone regimen on admission.
This was thought possibly due to narcotic regimen and Methadone dose was decreased on admission.
# BRBPR: Pt reported having BRBPR & scant red blood was seen around anus, guaic positive stool apprec on rectal exam.
Pt has history of hematochezia thought due to internal hemorrhoids vs diverticulosis.
