Service:                            Date:  [**2161-7-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2089-2-6**]         Sex:  F  Surgeon:  [**Last Name (LF) 3662**], [**First Name3 (LF) 3661**]  12-269  CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Headache, nausea, vomiting, chest pain  HISTORY  OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, resulting in  syncope,  status post pacemaker placement on [**6-15**], who complains  of  headache,  nausea, vomiting, and jaw and chest pain.
In the Emergency  Department,  patient  had an episode of nausea and vomiting,   denied   fever,  abdominal  pain,  dysuria,  neck stiffness,  chest pain at the time of admission, or cough and was  transferred  to  the  medical  Intensive  Care  Unit for further management.
PAST  MEDICAL  HISTORY:  Significant for atrial fibrillation, recent  pacemaker placement in [**Hospital6 1129**] on     [**6-15**],    gastroesophageal    reflux    disease, hypercholesterolemia.
MEDICATIONS:   Sotalol 160 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Toprol, Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
q.d., Nexium one tab p.o.
FAMILY  HISTORY:    Significant  for her father with coronary artery   disease,   sister   and   brother  with  history  of unspecified thyroid disorder.
IMPRESSION:   Patient is a 72-year-old female with persistent hypertension   admitted   with   evidence  of  a  pericardial effusion, possibly secondary to pacer placement.
HOSPITAL  COURSE:    1)  Cardiovascular:   Patient was volume resuscitated  over the course of two days with 8 liters of IV fluids  and  was also on a dopamine drip, which was gradually weaned  over  the  course  of  three  days.
By [**6-28**], her dopamine drip had been stopped.
No IV fluids were needed and her  pressures  were now in the systolic blood pressure range of  the  130s.
On  [**6-30**], [**2160**], her pacer leads were repositioned within the  right  ventricle.
There was no evidence of tamponade or increasing pericardial effusion after the procedure was done.
At the time of discharge, patient's pressure was normotensive and her O2 saturation was 94 to 95% on room air, including on ambulation.
Patient  will  be  sent home on sotalol 160 mg b.i.d., is still in atrial fibrillation; however, will likely need  to  be  switched from sotalol to a different medication such  as amiodarone in the near future, potentially after her LFTs   have  normalized  after  the  hepatic  congestion  has cleared.
Will  also  start  Lopressor for rate control and anticoagulation with Lovenox and Coumadin.
2)  Infectious Diseases:  Patient was noted to have a urinary tract   infection,   was  treated  with  Levofloxacin  for  a seven-day  course,  was  also given Vancomycin peri-procedure for repositioning of her leads and was sent home on Keflex.
Patient  was  once  again normotensive  and  will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in about one month  and  with the Electrophysiology service at [**Hospital3 **] in about one week and will follow up with the [**Hospital 197**] clinic in three days for adjustment of her Coumadin dosing.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Sotalol 160 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Lopressor 25  mg p.o.
b.i.d., Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
q.d., Enoxaparin 80 mg subcutaneously  b.i.d.,  Levofloxacin  500 mg p.o.
times                two  days,  Keflex  500 mg p.o.
times two days, Zantac 150 mg p.o.
