A position for paracentesis was marked in the right lower quadrant.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo M with alcoholic cirrhosis, grade II varices, non-occlusive portal vein thrombosis with recannulization admitted to the MICU with hypotension and atrial flutter/fibrillation with resolution s/p fluids and rate control subsequently called out to the floor for continued management.
# Hypotension: Etiology thought to be secondary to cirrhosis vs Afib/flutter with RVR, resolved with IVF and HR control.
While on the general medicine floor, the patient was continued on Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for possible PNA and or presumed SBP.
At this time he received a small bolus with good effect.
Diuresis thereafter for obvious fluid overload was difficult given the tenuous blood pressure.
For this reason, the electrophysiology cardiology team was consulted and Digoxin was loaded for rhythm control.
# Arrhythmia: New-onset Afib/Aflutter on presentation was thought to be related to discontinuation of Nadolol as an outpatient.
He was loaded with Digoxin in the MICU, which was not continued on the floor because of rate control with Nadolol (for varices).
For this reason, additional mechanisms for control of the arrythmia were considered, to include cardioversion and anti-arrhythmics.
Cardioversion was not an option given the patient's relative contraindication to anticoagulation given known grade 2 esophageal varices.
For this reason, the patient was loaded with Digoxin again and continued on Nadolol for both rhythm and rate control.
The CHF service was consulted in house and recommended diuresis with Lasix and Aldactone.
This was initiated reaching a maximum of Aldactone 50 mg and Lasix 40 mg IV BID, before the patient's blood pressure proved to be problem[**Name (NI) 115**].
For this reason, the CHF service was reconsulted and the patient was taken for a right and left heart cardiac catheterization, after which he was transferred to the acute cardiac floor for continuous diuresis with a Lasix drip.
Prophylactic treatment of presumed SBP was continued with Ceftriaxone and he was maintained on a PPI.
Patient was diuresed as tolerated with Lasix and Aldactone as detailed above until complicated by hypotension.
This resolved with diuresis but then in the setting of further diuresis, hypotension and worsening decompensated liver failure complicated by CHF his Cr started to rise most likely mised ATN amd pre-renal azotemia.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient's platelet count continued to drop from admission reaching 70,000.
While this was thought to be most likely from his liver disease, his prophylactic, subcutaneous Heparin was discontinued and HIT antibodies were sent off.
He was given TEDS instead for DVT prophylaxis as well as for LE edema.
