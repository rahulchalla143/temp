Repair of anastamotic leak   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 65 year old male who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2107-4-1**] (please see discharge summary for details) with a known colovesical fistula, with the idea to continue bowel rest and antibiotics and return to [**Hospital1 18**] at a later date for planned surgery.
He was started on Caspofungin and he was afebrile overnight.
He was kept NPO on IV fluids.
On HD 2, a right subclavian line was placed and his Mid-line from the OSH was removed.
On HD 3, he underwent a repair of his colovesical fistula and a sigmoid colectomy (please see operative note for details).
He spent the night after his operation in the PACU intubated and sedated.
He was also acidotic with a pH of 7.25 despite a PCO2 of 42, so he recieved several fluid boluses for post operative hypovolemia (and oliguria).
He was started on Kefzol and Flagyl in addition to his Caspofungin.
His propofol was weaned and he was left intubated.
He was kept NPO with an NG tube.
His NG tube was removed.
He was on a PCA for pain control.
He was given Lasix and Lopressor.
He was sedated on propofol and intubated.
He required Neosynepherine for BP control.
He required Fentanyl for pain.
He was followed closely with serial ABGs and CXRs on POD 8,3.
He was treated with aggressive chest PT.
His IV fluids were decreased.
On POD 9,4 a post-pyloric feeding tube was placed, however the patient persistently removed it.
He had to be restrained and sedated with Haldol in order to tolerate the tube.
His Lopressor was increased to 10mg IV Q 4 hours.
We continued with aggressive chest PT and serial ABGs.
We attempted to diurese him [**12-6**] liters negative with Lasix (he was negative 1.8 liters on the day).
He tolerated his feeding tube better and did not pull it.
He was less agitated (still on standing Haldol 2mg TID).
On POD 12,7 he was maintained on just Linezolid and Gentamycin for coverage of his Acinetobacter (peritoneal fluid, cath tip) and Enterococcus (peritoneal, blood).
That night, his central line was removed due to erythema and the tip was sent for culture (which subsequently grew Acinetobacter), so he was maintained on only perhiperal IVs.
TPN was stopped all together and he tolerated goal tube feeds.
His abdominal wound was granulating well and required TID wet:dry dressing changes.
His medications were switched to PO (including Lopressor 100 [**Hospital1 **]).
He continued to do well with a PO diet.
He got OOB with PT and his IV fluids were stopped.
