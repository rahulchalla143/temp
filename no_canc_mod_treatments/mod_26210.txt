Mother was admitted on [**10-17**] for monitoring, and was given betamethasone [**Date range (1) 26989**].
At delivery, infant required PPV and subsequently intubation for poor respiratory effort.

Enteral feedings were introduced on day of life 4, and advanced slowly to full volume feeds by day of life 15.
Earlier in hospitalization, mild hyponatremia was noted as enteral feedings were advanced, treated with NaCL supplements.
Hyponatremia resolved, and the NaCl supplements were discontinued on [**12-7**], with Na level remaining stable at 135-136 since then; last level was 136 on [**12-20**].

Due to initial leukopenia, infant was treated with antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) for 7 days for presumed sepsis; lumbar puncture was performed on day of life 4 with overall reassuring cell counts.
Of note, antibiotics were changed from day 5 to 7 to oxacillin and gentamicin for mild umbilical erythyema, which subsequently resolved.
