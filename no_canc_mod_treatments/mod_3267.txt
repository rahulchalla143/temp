Per the patient's family, the patient had shortness of breath with acute onset two hours prior to her presentation, with associated decreased responsiveness.
The patient had recently been admitted in [**2104-11-26**] with mental status changes and rule out myocardial infarction and was found to have right occipital bilateral thalamic infarctions with atrial fibrillation and was started on Coumadin.
The patient was prepared for rapid tube intubation when her vital signs showed respiratory failure.
She was given Lidocaine, Vecuronium, Etomidate and Succinyl choline with decrease in blood pressure after these medications.
She was started on Dopamine for about 30 minutes and was given intravenous fluids with a quick response and was able to have the Dopamine discontinued.
She was noticed to have increased agitation, where she was biting on her tube and was treated with 0.5 mg of Ativan.
The patient was given a vial of ceftriaxone in the Emergency Department.
Metoprolol 150 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Dulcolax 10 mg p.o.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
Tramadol 50 mg p.o.
Sertraline 50 mg p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature 94.0 F.; heart rate 81; blood pressure 115/56; respirations 13; O2 100% on FINV and pressure support.
The patient remained intubated since [**2105-1-31**].
At the time of this dictation, the patient had a tracheostomy placed on [**2105-2-13**], given a prolonged period of intubation with unclear timing of possible extubation.
She was initially treated with ceftriaxone and Azithromycin.
She was treated with ceftriaxone from [**1-31**] until [**2-3**] and Azithromycin from [**1-31**] through [**2-5**] for a community acquired pneumonia.
However, the patient was bronchoscoped multiple times to help clear her secretions and to help her left lower lobe collapse open up with removal of obstructive plugs and secretions and it was thought, given the nature of her secretions being very thick and pus-like, in addition to her airways which were consistent with bronchiectasis, that she should be placed on coverage that included Pseudomonas.
She was placed on Ceftazidine which was started on [**2-4**] and which was continued until the time of this dictation, and she was started on Levofloxacin for double coverage on [**2-6**].
The length of her course on antibiotics was undetermined at the time of this dictation.
It was thought that once the patient's secretions become less significant, perhaps we will determine the exact timing of her antibiotic course.
The patient was also briefly treated with Vancomycin starting on [**2-13**], where she had an episode of hypotension and it was appearing as though she may have become septic, however, the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage which was negative for any evidence of a gram positive infection necessitating Vancomycin coverage and this was promptly discontinued.
The patient's mental status improved significantly with treatment of her pneumonia and the patient did not require any sedation while she was intubated.
The patient received occasional Ativan and Fentanyl p.r.n.
The patient had one episode where she was noted to be biting on her OG tube and had a shift in her mental status which prompted a head CT scan that was negative for any new infarction and only showed her previous right occipital and bilateral thalamic infarctions.
twice a day of Metoprolol at home.
The patient was continued on a heparin drip because she was still in the Intensive Care Unit and it was unclear if she would need continued procedures.
We wanted to keep her on heparin so we could stop it instead of starting her on Coumadin which would be more difficult to reverse.
The patient will transition to Coumadin when there are no more procedures that are scheduled.
Of note, at the time of this Discharge Summary, the patient was waiting to have a PEG placed which will be done by Interventional Radiology.
The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, her Discharge Diagnoses and her Discharge Medications will be dictated by the house officer who is taking over the care of her starting [**2-16**].
