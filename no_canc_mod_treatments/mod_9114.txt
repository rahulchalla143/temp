A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
Correlation with prior interventional procedures in the region of the groin is recommended.
There is prominent gastric distention, of uncertain etiology.
Contrast freely passes, and small bowel loops as well as colon are opacified.
The lack of intravenous administration limits the evaluation of solid organs.
The left kidney measures approximately 10 cm in length.
Vertebral body heights and disc spaces are maintained.
Nafcillin was changed to Cefazolin.
Therefore his discharge regimen will be: Cefazolin 2g at HD on M, W and Cefazolin 3g on Friday with HD.
He was continue to get Gentamicin with HD - only two doses remaining at the time of discharge.
He is also taking oral Rifampin for a 6 week course.
He will be followed by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7443**] of ID and has a prescription for surveillance CBC and LFTs while on antibiotics.
He was transferred briefly to the ICU, and his BP stabilized with fluids and antibiotics.
His ACE inhibitor and Beta-Blocker were initially discontinued, but then the ACE was resumed once his BP remained stable.
Labetolol was also restarted after the patient was noted to have several measurements in the systolic 140-160s.
At the time of discharge he was on Labetolol 200mg TID and will follow up with his primary care doctor next week for repeat BP check.
He was initially given IV narcotics and then transitioned to a Fentanyl patch with standing Tylenol to control his pain.
Heparin products were stopped and a HIT antibody was sent, which was negative.
# Cardiac 1. vessels- He had a cath in [**2161**] w/diffuse atherosclerosis, no flow limiting disease.
He was continued on an aspirin, statin, but hi beta-blocker was held in the setting of hypotension/ sepsis.
2. pump- echo in [**7-26**] with global hypokinesis, EF 45% and cath in [**2161**] with evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
His ACE and beta-blocker were initially held in the setting of sepsis, but both were resumed once his blood pressure stabilized.
Although his repeat TEE was unchanged, it was thought that endocarditis was the most likely cause of his bacteremia and he will be treated with a 6 week course of antibiotics.
He was placed on a bowel regimen with cortisone cream to try and prevent exacerbation of hemorrhoids.
He also had evidence of a RIJ clot on US and was on a heparin drip.
After extensive discussions with the patient regarding the risk/benefits of anticoagulation in the setting of IJ clot, he decided against outpatient anticoagulation.
They felt that this would be too high risk of a procedure given the chronicity of the clot, MSSA infection and need for multiple interventions to fully remove the clot.
He will also follow up with GI regarding his bloody bowel movements while on heparin gtt.
The patient was discharged home to complete a prolonged course of antibiotics both orally and to be given at HD.
He will follow-up with the [**Hospital **] clinic, his cardiologist, and his primary care physician as planned.
