ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 32-year-old female with a long history of seizures co-mixed with possible motor conversion disorder, admitted after placement of grid and strips intracranially to try and characterize whether her altered consciousness and frequent right face twitching represent seizures or conversion disorder.
The patient was therefore started on iron sulfate.
Because of concerns for possible pneumonia, she was started on ceftriaxone on [**2-3**].
She was already on vancomycin postoperatively, because she has an allergy to penicillin and would not tolerate Keflex prophylaxis.
Also, because her hematocrit was 23.7, she was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**2-4**].
Also, we found that her vitamin B12 was low, and she was started on oral vitamin B12 replacement.
Because of the need to prevent seizures during the brain mapping, the patient did receive an IV load of Dilantin, as well as a po load, to keep her level between 15 and 20.
However, because of the likelihood that she will need long-term vancomycin therapy, a PICC line was placed on [**2-15**], and placement confirmed by chest x-ray.
She will need to be discharged on a likely several week course of vancomycin as per ID recommendations.
