He called the EMTs who told him to take an aspirin and brought him to [**Hospital3 **].
He was given 40mg IV lasix and was admitted for ROMI and CHF exacerbation.
Patient was started on heparin.
He was not treated with plavix because of concern for three vessel disease and potential cardiac surgery.
It was decided to transfer patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath and potential intervention on the OM2 lesion.
There he underwent cardiac cath with attempted intervention on OM2 lesion at end of previously placed stent, however, they were unable to pass the wire and no intervention was done.
The patient's procedure was complicated by a groin hematoma.
Past Medical History: Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes(+), Dyslipidemia(+), Hypertension(+)  Cardiac History: CABG, in [**2175-2-2**] anatomy as follows: LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1, SVG-OM2, SVG-rPDA  Percutaneous coronary intervention ([**2180**]): 1.

Selective venous conduit angiography revealed a patent saphenous vein grafts to OM1, OM2 and PDA.
Failed attempt to close the right femoral arteriotomy site with a Perclose closure device - manual compression applied.
Unsuccessful closure attempt of the right femoral arteriotomy site with a Perclose closure device.
[**3-9**] Groin hematoma:IMPRESSION: Large 5.1 x 3.5 x 4.2 cm hematoma in the right groin with a small 1.7 x 0.8 x 2.4 cm pseudoaneurysm demonstrating to- and- fro to the common femoral aneurysm.
Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker ends in expected position.
Sternotomy wires are intact.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 M with CAD s/p CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1, SVG-OM2, SVG-PDA) and DES to OM2 in [**2180**] admitted for NSTEMI and had subsequent unsucessful PCI on the native OM2.
CAD: Cath showed stenosis at end of stent in OM2 that was unable to be intervened upon.
Patient was initially loaded with plavix in the cath lab.
Plavix was then continued on the floor.
Patient was continued on asa, statin and imdur.
This would resolve with BP control and the EKG changes would come down to baseline, his last episode of chest pain was on [**2186-3-11**].
His ACE inhibitor was changed to long-acting and his beta blocker was increased for better HR control to maximize his anti-anginal regimen.
Patient was also started on Ranolazine 500mg [**Hospital1 **], continued on Plavix from OSH.
However, with increase of beta blocker, the patient had onset of bradycardia with some pauses as long as 6 seconds so the beta blocker had to be discontinued.
He was transferred to the CCU for better monitoring given the long pauses and chest pain associated with HTN.
In the CCU patient was monitored prior to receiving pacemaker on [**3-13**].
Carvedilol was added to his regimen on [**2186-3-14**].
His HR was in 60-70s at time of discharge and his Carvedilol was increased to 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **] .
A dual chamber pacemaker, [**Company **], placed on [**2186-3-13**].
Patient was started on Carvedilol as above.
LVEF 55% reportedly on TTE at OSH but did have symptoms of CHF requiring diuresis.
After [**3-9**] he remained euvolemic on exam and did not require further diuresis or oxygen.
His ACE inhibitor was changed to long-acting, his beta blocker was changed as above, and he was continued on his imdur at increased dose, statin, and a high-dose aspirin.
CRI: Patient with baseline creatinine 1.8-2.0, Stage II.
Initially his HCTZ was held given dye load at cath and concern for contrast-induced nephropathy, however, creatinine remained stable at 1.7.
As patient was euvolemic and other BP medications were titrated up it was decided not to re-start the HCTZ.
Was fluctuating throughout hostpital stay with elevations thought to lead to chest pain/demand ischemia.
Patient was uptightrated on antihypertensives and was discharged on Carvedilol 6.25 [**Hospital1 **], Lisinopril 40mg QHS, Nifedipine 90mg CR QD.
He will reqiure further follow up and uptightration of medication for goal BP of < 130/80.
managed with percocet and neurontin as he had been getting at home and OSH while he was here.
Pain was well controlled with Acetaminophen 650 mg QID standing.
DM2: PO medications were discontinued while inpatient.
He required uptightration of Lantus to 17 U QHS with resultant AM BG of 169.
He will require further uptightration of this scale return to his oral regimen.
Patient was continued on Neurontin at home doses.
He will require rehabilitation management.
He was continued on Aricept.
Patient was continued on Lexapro.
He will require optimization of antihypertensive regimen, blood glucose control and follow up of his pain control.
