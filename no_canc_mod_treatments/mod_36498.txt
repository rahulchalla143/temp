PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to the MICU, the patient had a blood pressure of 95/40 on 15 micrograms of dopamine, a pulse in the 90s, saturating 100% on 50% face mask, temperature 99.5.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 136, potassium 2.9, chloride 98, bicarbonate 24, BUN 27, creatinine 0.8.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated on arrival and weaned from the dopamine drip overnight.
The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including Zosyn and vancomycin.
The patient was evaluated by Surgery who declined intervention at this time and preferred medical management.
The patient had difficulty with potassium homeostasis on the floor and a rising white blood cell count; however, minimal abdominal pain and only low-grade temperatures.
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was covered with Zosyn, gentamicin, and vancomycin.
The question of removing the patient's Porta-Cath was discussed with Surgery and it was felt that the patient had not had any positive blood cultures since the initiation of vancomycin; therefore, Staphylococcus epidermidis was unlikely to account for this patient's hypotensive state.
The patient was started on stress-dose steroids and remained initially stable.
The patient's hematocrit dropped as low as 20 and she was given multiple units of packed red blood cells.
The patient was managed with antibiotics and packed red blood cells as possible.
The patient was at that time started on a morphine drip, titrated to comfort.
