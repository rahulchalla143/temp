At the time of arrival in the ED, the patient's exam was consistent with an NIH stroke scale score of about 19 (2 for inability to answer loc questions, 2 for inability to follow loc commands, 1 for partial gaze palsy/left gaze preference, 1 for partial hemianopia, 2 for right facial palsy, 4 for left upper extremity plegia, 3 for no effort versus gravity in left lower extremity, 2 for severe aphasia, 2 for profound inattention to right side of space).
After discussions with the family, she was given IV t-pa.  A subsequent CTP did demonstrate a subtle mismatch between MTT and CBV; however, as the yield of intervention was thought to be low, clot retrieval was not pursued.
Accordingly, she was given benadryl and cimetidine prior to intubation.

Initial NIHSS at [**Hospital1 18**] was 19 and patient was administered IV tPA within the 3 hour window.
On HD 2, follow-up CTs revealed increasing edema in the left hemisphere and she was initiated on hypertonic saline (w/ goal Na 150-155).
