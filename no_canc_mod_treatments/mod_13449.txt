Rhabdomyolysis: The patient was at first treated with aggressive iv fluids, NS and D5W with bicarb to alkalanize the urine.
Secondary to her renal failure, she stopped making urine.
She was treated with one dose of iv lasix prior to transfer to the floor, but did not put out urine to this.
She was not given any subsequent iv fluids, and CK's continue to decline.
Her needs were calculated, and she given standing MS Contin as she has a risk of heroin abuse.
Pain was also somewhat relieved after dialysis was started and fluid taken off.
She was discharged on Percocet for pain control.
On [**2142-3-27**] she had a tunnelled right subclavian line placed by IR and was started on hemodialysis.
She will continue on hemodialysis as an outpatient until her renal function returns.
Since her LDH was trending down and her haptoglobin was obtained after transfusion and her Coombs was negative, this was thought not to be hemolysis.
She was continued on her Zoloft at half dose given the acute renal failure.
Topomax was discontinued in the setting of acute renal failure.
She was on benadryl for the rash which helped her symptomatically, but this was changed to [**Doctor First Name 130**] as she developed urinary retention.
She was discharged with a foley catheter and can have a repeat voiding trial on [**4-10**].
