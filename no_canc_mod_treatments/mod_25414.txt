There has been prior midline sternotomy with intact sternal wires in the expected location.
[**2135-5-7**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the right-sided jugular vein catheter has been inserted.
Left PICC tip projects over the mid SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 80 yo man with h/o CAD, CHF, afib, h/o DVT on coumadin treated 1 week ago for UTI presents from OHS with recurrent dysuria and hematuria, found to have nephrolithiasis and UTI with sepsis.
# UTI with sepsis: Patient presented with pyelonephritis in the setting of nephrolithiasis complicated by sepsis given fever/bandemia, hypotension requiring pressors despite attempted volume resuscitation (total 4L NS).
He was initially treated with ceftriaxone and gentamicin in the ER, but then transitioned to zosyn in the MICU.
He underwent a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement in IR on [**2135-5-7**].
After the percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement he was able to be weaned off his levophed.
On [**5-9**] outside hospital cultures and sensitivities returned, with proteus mirabolis that was sensitive to ceftriaxone so his antibiotic regimen was changed from zosyn to ceftriaxone.
Patient is discharged with nephrostomy tube in place.
Strongly recommend discontinuing foley catheter at earliest possible convenience.
Patient's coumadin will likely need to be discontinued prior to his procedure with a lovenox bridge.
# Hypoxia: Patient with h/o COPD on 1L NC at home since a pneumonia a few months ago.
After volume resuscitation patient's oxygen requirement increased to 4 L NC.
His hypoxia returned to baseline prior to discharge with daily lasix 80 mg po and scheduled nebulizer treatments.
Patient's creatinine improved with volume resuscitation and was 1.1 at time of discharge.
He was continued on beta blocker, lasix, and statin.
Would recommend adding and ace inhibitor as tolerated.
Respiratory symptoms improved largely with diuresis and schedule nebs.
Continued scheduled nebs and supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations > 94%.
# H/o DVTs: Pt reports h/o multiple DVTs but none since coumadin initiation "a while ago."
Coumadin was restarted at a decreased dose with goal INR [**2-16**].
Recommend monitoring INR on [**2135-5-20**] for adequate coumadin dosing.
# Chronic Afib: Pt with borderline RVR in setting of urosepsis.
Metoprolol was titrated up with resolution of urosepsis.
Coumadin was restarted at a lower dose after nephrostomy tube placement.
Recommend monitoring INR on [**2135-5-20**] and adjusting coumadin dosing accordingly to maintain goal INR [**2-16**].
Patient will likely need to hold coumadin prior to lithotripsy and be strarted on a lovenox bridge.
The timing of holding coumadin and starting lovenox will be determined at patient's Urology follow up appointment on [**2135-5-25**].
Continue aspirin, beta blocker, and statin after discharge.
Blood pressure well controlled on day of discharge with lasix and metoprolol.

A drain was placed to relieve the obstruction and you were treated with IV antibiotics.
Because the kidney stone is still present you will likely require a procedure call lithotripsy to break up the stone after you have completed a two week course of antibiotics.
The following changes were made to your home medications: 1) START Ceftriaxone 1 g IV daily for three days (last dose [**2135-5-20**]) to treat your urinary tract infection.
2) DECREASE Coumadin to 1.5 mg daily.
3) INCREASE Metoprolol tartrate to 50 mg by mouth three times a day.
4) START Ipratropium and Xopenex nebulizer treatments to help your shortness of breath.
5) START Docusate, Senna, and Miralax for treatment and prevention of constipation.
Your coumadin dose will be adjusted accordingly for goal INR [**2-16**].
