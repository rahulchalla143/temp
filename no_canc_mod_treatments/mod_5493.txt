Admission Date:  [**2132-11-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-12-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-9-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Lipitor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2132-12-2**] LV Apico-Aortic Valved Conduit via Left Thoracotomy(16mm LV Apical Connector with a 18mm Porcine Valved Conduit)   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 40134**] is an 81 year-old gentleman with an extensive history of coronary artery disease, s/p AMI at age 37, CABG in [**2115**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM1) with redo in [**2121**] (occuded LIMA-LAD and SVG-PDA, RIMA-LAD,SVG-PDA, SVG-OM2).
History also significant for CHF with an an EF of 25% s/p cardiac resynchronization and biventricular pacemaker placement, hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
His symptoms improved with intravenous Lasix and he was eventually transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac surgical evaluation.
Past Medical History: Systolic Congestive Heart Failure Coronary Artery Disease - Prior CABG [**2115**], [**2121**] Anterior MI at age 37 Biventricular Pacemaker and Cardiac Resynchronization Hypertension Hyperlipidemia History of Abscess Excision Cholecystectomy History of Remote MVA   Social History: Retired sales officer.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferolateral, lateral, anteroseptal and apical segments.
There is hypokinesis of the remaining segments, with relative preservation of only the basal and mid-inferior segments and basal anterior segment (LVEF = 25%).
He was noted to be in atrial fibrillation and started on intravenous Heparin.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and extensive preoperative evaluation was performed.
Cardiac catheterization was performed which showed patent RIMA to LAD and patent vein graft to obtuse marginal.
(See result section for additional cath results.)
Given the location of the RIMA and extensive aortic calcifications, it was decided to proceed with LV apico-aortic valved conduit approach via thoracotmy rather than median sternotomy.
On [**12-2**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed an LV Apico-Aortic Valved Conduit operation via left thoractomy.
He was initially maintained on Amiodarone for ventricular ectopy while Warfarin anticoagulation was initiated for atrial fibrillation.
Once his hemodynamics stablized, he eventually transferred to the SDU for further care and recovery.
Amiodarone was eventually discontinued while beta blockade was advanced as tolerated.
Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 2.5.
Over several days, he continued to make clinical improvements with diuresis and made steady progress with physical therapy.
If there is improvement in blood pressure, an ACE inhibitor should be resumed given his congestive heart failure.
