She was found to have a R ureteral stone w/ resultant hydronephrosis and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ureteral stent placement.
In the MICU, urology was consulted and the patient received a R nephrostomy tube.
However, tube placement was complicated by renal artery puncture, afib, and increased dyspnea.
She was intubated for this hypoxia and treated with lasix, metoprolol, and diltiazem.
She was weaned off her pressors on [**1-1**] and maintained her pressure w/out additional fluid boluses.
Her sedation was weaned down and she was successfully extubated shortly thereafter.
UCx grew proteus and her abx were changed to levaquin alone and she remained afebrile for >24hr on this regimen.
She continued to have trouble with afib and required a dilt gtt on the day prior to call-out to control this rhythm but she was transitioned to PO diltiazem and has been in NSR since this time.
She was restarted on heparin prior to d/c as a bridge to therapeutic coumadin anticoagulation.

In the MICU, urology was consulted and the patient received a R nephrostomy tube.
However, tube placement was complicated by renal artery puncture, afib, and increased dyspnea.
She was intubated for this hypoxia and treated with lasix, metoprolol, and diltiazem.
She was weaned off her pressors on [**1-1**] and maintained her pressure w/out additional fluid boluses.
Her sedation was weaned down and she was successfully extubated shortly thereafter.
UCx grew proteus and her abx were changed to levaquin alone and she remained afebrile for >24hr on this regimen.
She continued to have trouble with afib and required a dilt gtt on the day prior to call-out to control this rhythm but she was transitioned to PO diltiazem on the day of call-out.
She was treated with levaquin on the floor and will complete a 14d course at rehab.
Ureteral stone - The patient had a nephrostomy tube placed by IR to relieve her hydronephrosis.
She was followed by urology during her stay and will see them again 2wk after d/c for definitive treatment of her nephrolithiasis.
At this time, urology will coordinate removal of her nephrostomy tube with IR.
Her nephrostomy tube was draining clear yellow urine at the time of d/c.
3. a.fib - The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation controlled with beta blockers at home.
Because of this, the patient's diltiazem was stopped and she was started on tid metoprolol.
She was maintained on a heparin gtt for bridge to coumadin while on the floor after this was cleared by IR and urology.
She will continue her coumadin at rehab to achieve an INR between [**1-30**].
