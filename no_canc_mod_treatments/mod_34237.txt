Admission Date:  [**2139-6-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-6-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2094-6-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Zantac / Morphine / Tylenol / Naprosyn / ketorolac / Potassium  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: chest pain, hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None this hospitalization   History of Present Illness: This is a 45 year-old female with ESRD (on HD), chronic abdominal pain on narcotics, type 2 DM, HTN, HLD, CAD (h/o inferior MI, normal MIBI [**11/2138**]), h/o DVT, with extensive psychiatric history admitted on [**2139-6-16**] for chest pain and hypotension.
EMS arrived and administered ASA 325 mg. Of note, she reportedly has chronic dyspnea and often hyperventilates.
She was persistently hypotensive with SBP 73, which resulted in LIJ placement and initiation of Levophed gtt.
She was given Ativan 2 mg IV, Dilaudid 2 mg IV, Vancomycin 1 g IV, Zosyn IV, Benadryl 50 mg IV and 1L NS x 1.
She had a CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrating an occlusion of the left subcalvian vein and collaterals to the LUE from the right with a thrombus in the right innominate vein graft with trace flow.
While in the MICU, she was continued on Levophed gtt with SBP of 100s, and upon cessation her pressures returned to 70 systolic.
She received a dose of Kayexalate for a K+ 5.3 and her antibiotics were not continued.
She received HD on Wednesday.
Midodrine 2.5 mg PO TID was initiated given her tenuous SBPs.
ESRD on HD M/W/F (RUE AV-fistula) 3. type 2 diabetes mellitus 4. coronary artery disease (inferior MI, cardiac cath [**2129**], EF 65%, inferior hypokinesis; MIBI [**11/2138**] no perfusion defects, no ischemic ST changes) 5. h/o LLE DVT (no longer on coumadin), popliteal DVT ([**7-/2136**]) s/p IVC filter placement 6. hypertension 7.
Thrombus in the right innominate vein graft; however, there is a trace flow in a portion of the thrombus.
Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 45F with PMH significant for ESRD (on HD), chronic abdominal pain on narcotics, type 2 DM, HTN, HLD, CAD (h/o inferior MI, normal MINI [**11/2138**]), h/o DVT, with extensive psychiatric history admitted on [**2139-6-16**] to the MICU for chest pain and hypotension requiring pressors.
The patient was admitted to the MICU on admission because she transiently required Levophed gtt in the ED, and this was quickly weaned in the ICU.
The patient was also started on Midodrine 2.5 mg PO TID in the ICU to support her pressure, but this was subsequently discontinued prior to discharge.
She continued with HD sessions while hospitalized.
# EKG CHANGES - The patient has baseline tri-fascicular block (RBBB and LAFB) and also LVH and therefore T wave changes were difficult to interpret and non-specific (furthermore, discordance between ST and T wave is normal with BBB's) - T wave prominance could have been exacerbated by K+ (received single dose of Kayexalate).
She had serial EKGs which were reassuring and she was monitored on telemetry.
# HYPERKALEMIA - admitted with K+ 9.2(hemolyzed) in the setting of ESRD on HD and possible mineralocorticoid deficiency; received 30 gm Kayexalate x 1 with good response for repeat elevated potassium in the range of 5; EKG changes may have been augmented given hyperkalemia, but less likely.
Again serial EKGs were reassuring and her potassium improved with dialysis sessions.
# LEFT SUBCLAVIAN VEIN OCCLUSION - left subclavian vein occlusion noted with collaterals from right, see on admission imaging; unlikely need for anticoagulation and patient compliance is a concern and the fact that collateral flow suggests chronic thrombus and no evidence of acute neurologic findings were noted.
Improved with HD regimen.
Was receiving subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis.
We continued her statin and aspirin dosing.
We avoided beta-blockade and ACEI in the setting of hypotension concerns.
# ESRD ON HEMODIALYSIS - continued on HD regimen per Renal recommendations - M/W/F - continued nephrocaps, sevelamer and monitoring electrolytes.
She was dialyzed the day of discharge; her medications were all renally dosed and we avoided nephrotoxins.
# TYPE 2 DIABETES - Her last HbA1c 6.0% in [**2135**], has been on Levemir and sliding scale insulin at home; evidence of ESRD, peripheral neuropathy - we opted to maintain her on glargine 18 units QHS with plans to return to Levemir when she is discharged.
