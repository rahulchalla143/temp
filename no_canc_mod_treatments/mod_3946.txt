Has R hip stage I decub ulcer, but no erythema or warmth surrounding lesion, so not suspicious for cellulitis - Bcx x 2 - UA and urine cx - paracentesis today p 2 units FFP for emergent INR reversal - increase abx coverage to vanc, ceftazidime, flagyl (in discussion with ID) for broad spectrum coverage.
Patient with anion gap metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.
- supplement with O2 .
The read initially stated that there may be intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and a MRCP was ordered given his rising direct hyperbilirubinemia.
This is of uncertain significance and will require outpatient follow-up.

Patient with new fever [**4-10**] and s/p EGD/colonoscopy with high risk of SBP - Diagnostic/therapeutic tap today.
2 units FFP prior to tap - continue aldactone 50 QD for ascites.

*Prophylaxis: PPI IV bid, pneumoboots, lactulose *FEN: diabetic/low Na/low protein diet when patient awake and with supervision *Access: PICC line *Code Status: Full *Dispo: to ICU *Comm: HCP: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 21451**] (h) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21452**]; (c)[**Telephone/Fax (1) 21453**] - family made aware of transfer to ICU Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21454**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21455**] (beeper), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13553**] (office) - methadone program medical director MICU course:  A/P: 49 y/o male with PMHx of HepC cirrhosis, who intially presented with hepatic encephalopathy and was transferred to MICU for worsening mental status and possible aspiration PNA.
likely w/ sepsis requring large amounts of fluid and pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
aggressive fluid management to maintain pressure - will need central access to monitor CVP for adequate resuscitation .
to monitor gas and adjust vent settings as necessary.
## HepC/Alcohol Cirrhosis - Based on patient U/S and reversal of flow it appears that patient with progressively worsening liver failure.
Recent paracentesis w/o SBP - Consider repeat paracentesis give septic picture - Will continue to follow with liver - Will continue lactulose and refaximin - Will continue nadolol, protonix, aldactone .
However, this is now exacerbated by septic picture - Will treat for infection - Will continue lactulose and refaximin as above .
Patient with EGD and c-scope this admission which showed no active bleeding.
## History of drug use - Patient was getting methadone 60mg daily on floor to prevent withdrawal, however given new altered mental status will hold methadone for now.
