She was subsequently started on NaCl tablets (1 po bid) on [**2178-8-21**].
She was started empirically on vancomycin, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone.
A right IJ CVL was placed and levophed was started.
At baseline she is alert and oriented, nonambulatory and dependent for most ADLS.
If clinically feasible, recommend repeat with PA and lateral chest radiographs for better evaluation.
Tracheostomy approximately 2.7 cm above the carina.
She had altered mental status and required non-invasive ventillation.
However, overnight from [**Date range (1) 3923**]/10, she developed unresponsiveness and apnea with hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation for a PCO2 of 78.
It was felt that her hypercarbic respiratory failure was not fully reversible and she underwent trach/PEG placement on [**9-9**] without complications.
Prior to discharge she was weaned to pressure support [**7-23**] with FiO2 of 35%.
Health Care Associated Pneumonia: She received a seven-day course of vancomycin and cefepime for healthcare-associated pneumonia beginning on admission.
Given her multiple episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure and concern for repeated need for intubation, the family decided to proceed with tracheostomy which was done without complication.
Given need for long term intubation family wished for gastric feeding tube placement.
She had a PEG placed on [**9-9**] without complication and tube feeds were running at goal.
She was started on levophed after BP did not improve significantly with 3L IVF.
She was started empirically on vancomycin, meropenem and azithromycin in the MICU for possible sepsis.
She was continued on vancomycin and cefepime for possible [**Company 191**] pneumonia and was weaned from levophed by [**2178-8-24**].
She was treated for severe c/ diff with iv flagyl and po vancomycin (day 1 = [**9-5**]) for a total of 2 weeks.
RUE DVT: Ultrasound of the right upper extremity was ordered to evaluate swelling, and She was started on lovenox 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] to treat the DVT.
Her family remarked she has had bleeding complications while on coumadin in the past and has a history of hemorrhagic CVA.
She was started on mirtazipine 15 mg QHS on [**2178-8-25**] for its effects on mood as well as appetite and sleep, as she had also been having sleeping difficulties.
This medication was discontinued on [**2178-8-26**] given concern that it had contributed to respiratory depression.
They recommended starting no new meds for now given concern for polypharmacy on patient's mentation.
She was maintained on Metoprolol 12.5mg po bid.
Her blood pressure tends to drop with this dose, so she often required a 500cc fluid bolus after AM metoprolol.
Would hold metoprolol if systolic BP<100.
