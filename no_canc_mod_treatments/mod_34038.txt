The patient is a 60 year-old right handed man with a PMH of tobacco use who was transferred from an OSH 6 hours after the onset of R face, arm, and leg weakness.
Given the TEE findings, the patient initially was started on heparin gtt and Coumadin 5 mg daily; however, he then decided he does not want to be on Coumadin.
Therefore he was continued on ASA 325 daily.
He was started on Atorvastatin 20 daily.
His bp was not able to be controlled with IV lopressor and IV hydralazine on the floor, so he was briefly transferred to NeuroICU for Labetalol gtt.
He was discharged on Amlodipine 10 mg daily and Lisinopril 10 mg daily.
This was thought to likely be obstructive, and he was started on Flomax 0.4 mg PO qhs.
