Admission Date:  [**2101-9-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-10-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2039-8-28**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Location (un) **] Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62 year old female with a past medical history significant for diabetes Type 2, panhypopituitarism, status post resection, multiple prior episodes of hypoglycemia, hypothyroidism, end stage renal disease, hemodialysis dependent, congestive heart failure with ejection fraction less than 20% and coronary artery disease who presented after being found unresponsive at home with a fingerstick of 22.
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis times seven to eight years; 5.
Hypothyroidism controlled on Levothyroxine secondary to pituitary adenoma resection; 6.
Status post ovarian mass resection in [**2087**]; 12.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Prednisone 10, Synthroid 75, Protonix 40 q.d., Vitamin D 400 mg p.o.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission potassium 3.2.
This patient was admitted to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit given her hypoglycemia, inability to maintain normal glucose.
Given the setting of hypoglycemia she was maintained on a D10 drip originally at 35 cc/hr.
The differential diagnosis includes insulinoma and secondary phase of insulin response per Endocrine.
The patient was also started on steroids, initially Hydrocortisone and then changed to Dexamethasone so that she could under [**Last Name (un) **] Stim testing.
Hypoglycemia - After the patient was transferred to the floor she was eating well and was quickly weaned off of her D10 requiring no insulin coverage and no supplementary glucose with normal meals according to the hospital schedule.
The patient was maintained on a renal diet for the remainder of the admission, again no episodes of hypoglycemia.
In addition she was offered peanut butter sandwiches intermittently for nighttime snacks as high carbohydrate snacks without protein or fat, more likely to cause delayed insulin peak resulting in hypoglycemia during the night.
The patient was also maintained on fingersticks q.i.d.
To further elucidate the etiology of her hypoglycemia, the patient is to be scheduled for a calcium stimulation venous sampling by our procedure to be performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient was originally loathe to participate as she did not want to endure any more pain and was unwilling to undergo surgery, but given that she knows she will be anesthetized for this procedure and there is medical management available for insulinoma, she will undergo this procedure.
proton pump inhibitor, given that her hematocrit climbed rather than fell, Gastroenterology consult was not called given that this was likely due to chronic gastritis/esophagitis.
Diarrhea was intermittent and per the patient's chronic question as to whether this was due to diabetic enteropathy the treatment for this would be Atropine, i.e.
Loperamide or Lomotil to help with decreasing stool volume and increasing anal sphincter tone.
Panhypopituitarism - Secondary to surgery for pituitary adenoma the patient is maintained on Levothyroxine as well as Prednisone as an outpatient.
She was restarted on Hydrocortisone and transitioned to Decadron.
The patient still requires Prednisone therapy 5 mg q.
AM, 2.5 mg q.h.s.
The [**Location (un) 86**] [**Hospital6 3429**] was actually not willing to take the patient back on her service without a team conference to discuss the financial medications and food issues regarding the two sisters living together.
During this meeting, the patient stated that there was food in the house, but they frequently did not have juice or soda available to bring her [**Hospital6 **] sugar up in an emergent situation.
In the interim, the patient is willing to go to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation until she can find a new caretaker or if this is unavailable to her, she will resign herself to being a longterm care facility as she recommended she is unable to take care of herself, requires more consistent meals and certainly her medications to be filled on time.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital3 **] for a [**Hospital 5735**] rehabilitation and hemodialysis and physical therapy.
Levothyroxine sodium 75 mcg p.o.
Multivitamin 3.
