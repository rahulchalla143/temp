MICU/CCU Course according to problem: # Hypotension: Mr [**Known lastname **] was hypotensive in the CCU, even after his hyperkalemia and bradycardia were corrected.
In the MICU: * hypotension resolved [**12-2**]-> pt hypertensive * restarted [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 3782**] [**Last Name (un) **] and hydralazine, imdur * persistent hypertension, was started on nitro gtt [**12-4**].

The bradycardia was in the setting of severe hyperkalemia, and although he first had a PEA cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation, his arrythmias resolved after correction of potassium in the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU.
HD line was placed in CCU and dialysis was conducted.
# CKD: Secondary to DM/HTN and being transitioned to HD with ESRD.
* tunneled line placed [**12-4**], last RRT 12/24 .
* [**12-4**] HCT drop in setting of self discontinuation of fem line (patient pulled out) - CT abd/pelvis negative for intra or retroperitoneal bleed, received 2 units of PRBCs.
# Respiratory Distress: Patient with agonal breathing on presentation, poor oxygenation with large A-a gradient.
Intubated in setting of PEA arrest.
