HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 26-year-old male with no significant past medical history with the exception of a pneumonia three months prior to arrival found to be a pneumococcal pneumonia, who presented with fever, cough, sore throat to [**Hospital3 3834**] on [**2111-9-27**].
On Tuesday, patient went on a business trip to [**Location (un) 2725**], then Wednesday to [**Country 6607**] in the [**Location (un) 14336**] area, and then Thursday came back to [**State 350**].
Patient was treated at that time with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin, and then discharged home.
Acyclovir, 1,000 mg IV q.8h.
Rocephin 1 gram q.d.
Diflucan 100 p.o.
Doxycycline 100 b.i.d.
Motrin 800 p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Vitals:  Temperature  99.0, heart rate 120, blood pressure 143/68, respirations 23, sating at 91% on room air and then 100% on a nonrebreather.
Skin:  There is a vesicular rash with an erythematous base, which is nonpruritic and blanchable noted on the anterior chest, arms, as well as back crusted over and appeared dry.
The lesions on the anterior chest and arms appear to be of the same age.
CHEST X-RAY:  Bilateral hazy infiltrates with left retrocardiac consolidation.
Pneumonia:  When patient initially presented to the hospital, patient had studies sent off for varicella zoster, herpes simplex types I and II, [**Month/Day (1) 50508**] and Gram stain for fungi as well as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 50508**] of the nasal swab for viruses, testing for Mycoplasma pneumonia by antibodies as well as by PCR, and antibody testing for [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus.
Patient was initially treated with Vancomycin, acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and later changed to Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and then later changed to azithromycin for a total of 21 days of antibiotics.
Patient's chest x-ray by time of completion of antibiotic regimen revealed that he had small bilateral pleural effusions and a left middle lobe infiltrate with resolution of the left lower lobe infiltrate.
Again, patient was maintained on antibiotics for a total of 21 days.
Otherwise, patient was intubated on [**2111-9-28**], and remained intubated until [**2111-10-19**] at which time, a trache was placed in the OR.
The anesthesiologist that performed that intubation noted that patient's posterior pharynx was desquamated, ulcerated, and "raw appearing".
His intubation was complicated by pneumomediastinum as well as a small pneumothorax on the left side.
It was felt that given patient's traumatic intubation, that patient should be extubated with trache placement on [**10-19**] in the OR given that patient could have possible subglottic stenosis.
Ventilation:  Patient was initially maintained on assist-control ventilation.
As his pulmonary examination improved, he was maintained on pressure support ventilation and tolerated pressure support and PEEP of 5 without any complications.
His main limiting factors to extubation included very thick secretions as well as the patient becoming extremely agitated, diaphoretic, and tachypneic at extubation.
For sedation, the patient was maintained initially on Fentanyl and Versed, and then on propofol by time of discharge.
General Surgery was consulted in effort to determine whether placement of a percutaneous drain would be indicated.
Patient predominantly had elevations in AST and ALT, which by the time of discharge, were trending down and felt most likely secondary to his Tylenol usage for his fevers as well as his sedatives.
This is treated with Heparinization during the patient's hospitalization.
Line infections:  Patient had central lines placed in the subclavian, which was resighted on two occasions given the patient had persistent fevers.
Ophthalmology:  During his hospitalization, patient was noted to have very thickened conjunctivae with subconjunctival inflammation.
ophthalmologic care with bacitracin ointment was indicated.
He was maintained initially on an insulin drip and then transitioned into an insulin-sliding scale with good glycemic control.
Renal function:  When patient initially presented to the hospital, he was given aggressive fluid resuscitation, and then later was diuresed with Lasix with a bump in his creatinine from baseline of 0.8 to 1.3.
Patient received a total of 1 unit of packed red blood cells with good response.
Prophylaxis:  Patient was maintained on carafate, then changed to Protonix, Heparin gtt., pneumoboots, Colace, Senna, cooling blanket initially, then lactulose, and Reglan.
The rest of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course as well as medications at discharge and follow-up plans will be dictated by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 50509**].
