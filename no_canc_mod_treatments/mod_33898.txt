Initial impression at OSH was that patient potentially had a UTI, and given her poor IV access, was admitted for IVF resusciation via CVL and treated for a UTI with Levaquin 500mg IV.
The pt was given IV Lopressor and a Diltazem gtt.
OSH evaluation by Pulmonology on [**2108-12-23**] for hypoxia and question signs of pneumonitis, however at the time the pulmonary team felt the pt to be in decompensated systolic CHF (given CXR finding of pulmomary edema), and recommended diuresis.
The pt was subsequently diureses with Bumex 3mg IV x1.
OSH team felt believed some of her symptoms may have been secondary to narcotic and/or benzo withdrwal (as evidence by flushing and diaphoresis) and thus, she was also receiving Morphine IV and Valium q6H.
Given a concern of sepsis in a patient with MS changes and tachycardia the pt was given Vancomycin 1gm IVx1 and Zosyn 3.375mg IVx1 on [**2108-12-23**] (nursing report listed Cefepime 2gm IV however no record seen in med rec).

However, due to the significantly higher heart rate on the prior study, the degree of regurgitation was UNDERestimated.
The other findings are similar  CXR: A bedside radiograph of the chest re-demonstrates moderate cardiomegaly.
A left pacer/defibrillator device has a single lead terminating in atypical ventricular location.
A nasogastric tube is present with a side port just below the gastroesophageal junction, this tube could be advanced by 4-5 cm.
A right internal jugular central venous line ends in the lower portion of the SVC.
An endotracheal tube terminates 6.9 cm above the carina.
Pt received 20 IV solumedrol q8h per rheum recs.
Benzo withdrawal was considered likely, since patient had not been able to take PO meds for several days prior to admission, and this could explain delirium.
Differential includes airway (Asthma, COPD, although no history of either per prior records), Alveolar (PNA, CHF, pt with clear CXR on [**12-21**] followed by evidence of pulmonary edema following fluid resuscitation at OSH), Vascular (PE).
She responded well to lasix and was extubated on [**2108-12-26**].
Family decided against further intervention during 2nd PEA arrest.
Patient improved with sedation and pain control.
# Pain Control: The patient was on Methadone 40mg TID and Oxycodone 30mg TID as outpatient.
Was maintained on equivalent doses of home meds.
# SLE: Patient on stable long term management with CellCept, Prednisone, which were continued.
