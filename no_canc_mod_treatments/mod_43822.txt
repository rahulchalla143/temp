You were found to have another lumbar compression fracture and eventually developed an exacerbation of your COPD and kidney failure.
Your back pain is improving with Dilaudid and Tylenol.
It is important that you not mix Dilaudid with alcohol and not take more Tylenol than prescribed.
For your COPD, please continue on the steroids as prescribed.
It is extremely important that you wear your oxygen at all times, using 2L at rest and 3L with ambulation, and that you NOT smoke while wearing oxygen as this could be fatal.
You should continue taking Lasix and Metolazone every day until you meet with your PCP.
