INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for minutes were obtained.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 86 yo F with a hx of recent R colectomy for Tumor T3N0 in [**9-10**] who presented with 1 episode of BRBPR on [**11-29**].
Pt was initially maintained on ASA 81 qd and plavix but later those were held.
GI did not think an EGD or colonoscopy would be of benefit given that the RBC scan was + at jejenum.
After discussion w GI and her cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], it was decided to restart pt on aspirin alone (at 325mg dose).
#HTN - her bp meds initially held, at discharge bp stable (sBP in 120-140 range)and home dose metoprolol restarted.
Pt should have bp checked at rehab and if stable to high, after a few days, pt's home dose norvasc of 5mg QD can be restarted.

Pt did not develop any delirium issues during hospitalization  #hx of CVA/Carotid stenosis/PFO - per Cards, not on coumadin given hx of bleeding before.

This can be readdressed by PcP and or Cardiology as to when/if plavix should be restarted.
