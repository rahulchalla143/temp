She was discharged home with a woundvac, a PICC line and plan for 6 weeks of cefepime for osteomyelitis.
She was not given TPA and instead started on plavix.
Extremities: Severe wound on RLE - including necrotic deep wound.
Also a possibility for right basal ganglia/internal capsule hypodensity.
NCHCT - Subacute infarct involving the right globus pallidus and internal capsule.
An indium labeled WBC scan may be obtained for further differentiation as clinically [**Name (NI) 9304**].
CT head ([**2144-1-17**]) revealed subacute infarct involving the right globus pallidus and internal capsule.
The patient was placed on clopidogrel and statin therapy.
Aspirin therapy was deferred due to a history of an aspirin allegy.
The patient requires physical rehabilitation and will follow-up in the outpatient stroke clinic for further care.
She was started on po Lopressor.
# Respiratory: The patient has a brief stay in the ICU including intubation for likely volume overload.
CXR [**1-19**] showed fluid overload, and she was given Lasix 20mg IV and 0.5 in nitropaste for hypertension.
She subsequently had continued improvement in respiratory function especially with establishment of scheduled hemodialysis to control volume overload.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 8972**] 11.16.07-12.03.07 with complaints of right foot erythema, warmth and drainage from foot ulcer.
The patient underwent podiatric debridement at the OSH at that time and cultures from that procedure grew group B strep and pseudomonas.
She was started on a 6 week course of vanc and cefepime with plans for outpatient podiatry follow-up.
The patient was re-admitted and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] prior to completion of this antibiotic course.
On [**2144-1-24**] the patient was changed to vanc and ceftriaxone out of concern for cefepime induced AIN contributing to renal failure.
He will complete a total of 6 week course as planned (to be completed on [**2144-2-4**]) with outpatient podiatry follow-up.
The paitent was evaluated by the inpatient podiatry and vascular surgery consult services both of whom recommended no immediate intervention, instead favoring completion of 6 week antibiotic course and outpatient follow-up.
The patient's urine also grew enterococcus and vancomycin therapy as above was continued to treat this infection.
She completed a course of antibiotics on [**2144-2-4**] with antiobitics being dosed with hemodialysis.
Her Cr continued to rise and in the setting of volume overload the patient was initiated on hemodialysis after right subclavian tunnelled HD catheter placement on [**2144-1-22**].
She underwent vein mapping for possible future fistula placement in the event of prolonged HD needs.
Culture eventually grew enterococcus which was treated with vancomycin as described above.
At that time the patient's antibiotic regimen was changed fom vanc and cefepime to vanc and ceftazidime out of concen fo cefepime-induced AIN.
Of note, on [**2144-2-1**] the patient had an episode of hypotension, diaphoresis and nausea while on HD after removal of 1L of fluid.
HD was discontinued, she was given IVF bolus and blood cultures were sent.
It was decided to keep the patient in house for a cardiac stress test prior to discharge as hypotension with HD may indicate underlying coronary artery disease.
# Shoulder pain: Tendonitis, tendon tears and labral tears were seen on MR. She was evaluated by the orthopedic team who felt that no acute intervention was warranted and she should continue antiinflammatory medications and physical therapy.
# Elevated INR: The patient received Vitamin K 5mg daily for 3 days.
# Anemia: Procrit was started with hemodialysis.
# DM: She was maintained on an insulin sliding scale as well as standing dosages of humalog adjusted to 6 units TID with meals.
We recommend increasing this standing dosage of humalog to 8 units TID with meals.
She was admitted on a novolog sliding scale which will likely need to be adjusted at rehabilitation and as an outpatient.
# Diet: The patient was seen by speech and swallow and recommended thin liquids and soft solids.
Medications on Admission: Eucerin Cream Novolog sliding scale  (46/32  of 70/30) Levemir - being held.
