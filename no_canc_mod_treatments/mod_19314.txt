Pt went to his school health clinic for sore throat, where a culture was taken and he was given medication to swish and swallow (likely nystatin but pt unsure of name).
He has had some blurry vision, but says he thinks this is because he needed a new prescription for eye glasses, which he recently filled.
His father has diabetes and uses insulin for it.
He was admitted to the unit, where he was aggressively hydrated and started on an insulin drip.
He has been told that he has "borderline high" blood pressure.

Diabetes Mellitus w/ DKA: Pt presented initially with glucose 1200, anion gap 30 and ketones.
(However, pt was drinking soda and juice as well as eating ice cream before presentation so may have driven glucose up higher than typical presentation.)
Anti-islet antibodies and GAD antibodies are pending at this time and will help to clarify the picture.
The pt was treated with aggressive fluid hydration and insulin drip in the ICU with improvement of his glucose levels and closure of his anion gap.
After his third hospital day, with stabilization and transfer to the floor, the pt felt more in control of his diagnosis, wroked along with the team on his diet and insulin doses and asked many pertinent and appropriate questions.
He repeatedly required >80 units of insulin per day and was discharged on Lantus 50units qAM with a pre-meal humalog slide scale to begin administering insulin at FS 151 (14 units) and increase by 2 units for each 50 increase.
At bedtime he only administers insulin for FS >250 and starts with 2 units to increase by one for every increase of 50 in  FS.
Thrush: The pt had complaints of sore throat for 3w prior to admission, and was , given Nystatin swish and swallow as an outpt for oral thrush.
He was treated with continued swish and swallow as well as Fluconazole.
Control of his sugars as well as treatment with antifungals should provide adequate treatment.
The pt was treated with fluconazole for 5 days, and thrush cleared by hospital day 3. .
Given his new diagnosis of diabetes, we started the pt on lisinopril 5mg PO qday.
