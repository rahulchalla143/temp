He was treated for a question of an acute coronary syndrome at the outside hospital with a heparin drip, Plavix and intravenous Lopressor.
The patient apparently refused an intrafat balloon pump and placement of a central venous line at the outside hospital.
The patient was started on inotropic support with Dobutamine and pressor support with Dopamine.
The patient was given Kayexalate bicarbonate, insulin and calcium gluconate for hyperkalemia.
Heparin drip was discontinued given the patient's persistently elevated INR.
The patient was given one dose of intravenous vitamin K.  We decided not to pursue a internal jugular line and Swan-Ganz placement given his coagulopathy.
The following morning the patient did receive one unit of fresh frozen platelets and was taken urgently to the catheterization laboratory where a PA catheter was placed revealing elevated biventricular pressures, clean coronary arteries and a depressed cardiac index consistent with severe cardiogenic shock.
The patient remained hypotensive to the 60s with maps in the 40s despite the addition of a fourth pressor at max dose.
The patient subsequently experienced asystolic arrest on the floor from which he was revived with medications and transcutaneous pacing.
