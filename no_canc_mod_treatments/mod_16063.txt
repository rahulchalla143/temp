He was sent to the Operating Room on [**2125-10-17**] where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times four for the diagnosis of left main disease with unstable angina.
He received a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to the diagonal as well as the obtuse marginal as well as to posterior descending artery.
He had a right radial artery line and right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, two ventricular and two atrial pacing wires.
He had two mediastinal chest tubes and one left pleural tube.
His cardiopulmonary bypass time was 95 minutes with a crossclamp time of 72 minutes.
He was atrially paced, was on Propofol drip at 10 mcg/kg/min.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] was satisfied with his targets and the patient did well.
By postoperative day #1 he had already been extubated on the night of surgery and on the morning of postoperative day #1 he was noted to have an 11 beat run of ventricular tachycardia.
His11 beat run of ventricular tachycardia was treated with electrolyte repletion as well as starting low dose Beta blocker.
His chest tubes were removed on postoperative day #2.
At that time they thought that the patient should not undergo mammogram, he could follow up as an outpatient once he has recovered from his cardiac surgery at which time his breast mass can be evaluated.
He had not had ectopy for greater than 72 hours.
Given these findings and his recovery from surgery he ultimately was discharged to home without services.
