[**4-8**] MRI L spine without contrast: Insufficiency fracture involving the right ala of sacrum.

Focal calcifications of internal elastic band.
The infectious disease service was consulted, and the patient was treated empirically with vancomycin for suspected facet infection/myositis.
The MRIs were reviewed with the radiologists, ID team, and primary team who decided that the probability of facet infection/infectious myositis was unlikely; antibiotics were therefore discontinued (received 7 days of vancomycin).
The patient underwent an arthrocentesis of her right knee on [**4-15**] with 5250 wbc and only a few intra/extracellular monosodium urate crystals, not felt be significant.
She has a torso CT which showed left apical lung calcific focus, shotty, non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal/hilar LAD, fatty liver, right ischial bursitis, and bilateral hip effusions, but no evidence of malignancy.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease (due to celiac sprue vs above inflammatory process), vitamin B12 was elevated, folate wnl, and UPEP/SPEP without monoclonal bands (has had abnormal tests in the past).
Fibrinogen was elevated, not consistent with DIC, and haptoglobin was elevated, not consistent with hemolysis.
The gastroenterology service was consulted, and recommended outpatient follow-up with Dr. [**Known lastname 1356**].
The nephrology team was consulted, who felt this was secondary to SIADH (possibly related to pain, chest CT/head CT without abnormalities) and recommended fluid restriction (2L/day) and salt tabs.
8) Osteoporosis/spinal Compression fx: The patient was continued on calcium, vitamin D, and Fosamax  9) Right arm cephalic vein thrombosis: Following a right PICC line placement, the placement developed right arm swelling.
The catheter was removed and the patient's arm swelling resolved.
