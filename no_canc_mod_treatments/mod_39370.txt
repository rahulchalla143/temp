Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo M with COPD, CAD and b/l knee replacements, transferred from OSH on [**2198-1-22**] with a septic right knee, underwent debridement with hardware repair by ortho surgery.
Hospital course complicated by aflutter with RVR and hypotension, fluid overload with pulmonary edema, knee hematoma s/p repeat washout, postop ileus, retroperitoneal bleed, UGIB from esophagitis, delerium and [**Last Name (un) **].
Outside hospital cultures showed MSSA and he was started on nafcillin.
Post-debridement he required transfer to the SICU for pressors and continued intubation.
He was then transferred to medicine where nafcillin was continued.
ID was consulted and recommended treatment with IV nafcillin for 6 weeks, then 6 months of oral suppressive thearpy afterwards with oral rifampin indefinitely.
He required SICU admission post-op for pressors and rate control.
He underwent TEE/cardioversion successfully, but then returned to aflutter.
He went on an amiodarone drip which converted to sinus.
Post-ablation he had atrial fib/aberrancy requiring diltiazem for rate control eventually requiring maximum dose diltiazem as well as increasing doses of metoprolol.
He was initially started on heparin, then transtioned to lovenox, with plan to bridge to coumadin for 3 months of anticoagulation post-ablation.
However, anticoagulation was held due to multiple bleeding risks, including active UGIB, a large RP bleed and hematoma s/p washout of the right knee.
He has a CHADS2 score of 2 and so would indicate anticoagulation with coumadin if safe after his repeat EGD in mid-[**Month (only) 958**].
His lovenox and aspirin were held.
The patient was started on a PPI IV and transfused 2 units PRBCs.
The patient underwent an EGD that showed esophagitis, gastritis, and duodenitis, but no active bleeding and no intervention was undertaken.
# Hypoxia/hypercapnia/delirium - His ventilation and oxygenation status varied throughout his hospitalization.
A CTA ruled out PE.
He will be continued on lasix 40mg PO and will require twice weekly Chem 7 testing to assess for renal function, to hold lasix if his renal function increases by more than 50%.
TRANSITIONAL -- needs 6 weeks of IV nafcillin (start date [**2-8**], last day [**3-22**]) as well as indefinite PO rifampin (300mg TID).
After his nafcillin course is complete, he will require PO antibiotics for 6 months which will be determined by infectious disease.
-- consider resuming coumadin after his repeat EGD in mid-[**Month (only) 958**] -- PFTs should be repeated, with possible sleep study to evaluate for OSA -- Lung nodule seen on imaging that needs to be followed up with repeat CT scan in [**6-26**] months.
