His temperature maximum was 99.2, was in sinus rhythm at 62, blood pressure 109/49, saturating 95 percent on 4.5 liters nasal cannula.
He was on an insulin drip at four units per hour and Neo- Synephrine drip at 0.1 mcg/kg/minute.
Nursing staff worked to calm him down, gave him a little bit of Morphine and Percocet to help eliminate his pain.

Amiodarone was started for his atrial fibrillation.
Pacing wires were discontinued.
The patient was given intravenous Lasix for more aggressive diuresis.
His chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued.
The patient was encouraged strongly to cough and deep breathe and to continue to ambulate.
Intravenous Lasix was switched back to p.o.
On postoperative day number five, his final chest tube was removed.
He had [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings replaced with a plan that if the patient went out of sinus rhythm back into atrial fibrillation then Heparin would be started as well as Coumadin, but this was not the case that morning.
On postoperative day number six, he started Heparin drip for atrial fibrillation.
He was given 5 mg of Coumadin a night earlier for atrial fibrillation.
His partial thromboplastin time was 31.6 and his Heparin was increased to 1200 units per hour and he received 3 mg of Coumadin that evening.
His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, and his sternum was stable.
His Heparin was increased to 1500 units per hour.
He received an order for 5 mg of Coumadin that evening.
The patient continued Lasix and potassium.
On postoperative day number eight, the patient remained in sinus rhythm on Amiodarone and Coumadin, hemodynamically stable following all commands.
Amiodarone and Coumadin are continued for atrial fibrillation with a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5.
The patient was also instructed to take 4 mg of Coumadin this evening.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Potassium Chloride 20 mEq p.o.
Rosuvastatin Calcium 10 mg p.o.
Ibuprofen 600 mg p.o.
Dilaudid 2 to 4 mg q4-6hours p.r.n.
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg p.o.

The patient was    instructed to monitor his INR and have his first INR check    on [**2198-9-6**], and to contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 57930**], telephone    number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 57931**], for Coumadin and INR level    management.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post mitral valve replacement.
