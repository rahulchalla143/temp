Repeat cta following administration of IV tpa showed no recannulization of the MCA, but also no bleed.
At just under the 6 hour mark, she underwent angiography with mechanical intervention with balloon to open the MCA; revascularization was obtained with balloon alone, and IA TPA was not given both because of the time restraints (at this point >6hrs) and risk associated.
She was awake at presentation and had denied smoking or ocps, as well as other medical conditions, medications or allergies.

The superior vertebral, basilar and posterior cerebral arteries opacify normally with contrast within the head.
CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAPHY WITH BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY [**4-12**]: CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM:  CLINICAL INFORMATION: Acute onset of left hemiparesis.
Risks explained included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent, with possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.
The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and placed on the biplane table in supine position.
Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a continuous drip.
Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 units of heparin in 1000 cc of saline).
The following vessels were selectively catheterized and arteriograms were performed from these locations:  1) Right internal carotid artery.
A balloon angioplasty was performed at the occluded proximal segment of the right middle cerebral artery with an hyperglide balloon catheter.
Post- procedural right internal carotid injection demonstrate patency and good flow within the right middle cerebral artery.
CONCLUSION: Successful balloon angioplasty and re-vascularization of the occluded right middle cerebral artery.
DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  ***** MRI EXAM OF THE CERVICAL SPINE [**4-12**] (performed to help clear c-spine) MRI exam of the cervical spine was obtained according to standard departmental protocol.
Correlation with endoscopy might be helpful along with followup.
CXR [**4-13**] (prior CXR's done to confirm line and tube placement): PORTABLE AP CHEST: The tip of the left subclavian catheter is in the SVC.
ET and NG tube are unchanged.
An endotracheal tube remains in place.
IMPRESSION: NG tube tip in the stomach.
TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHO [**4-10**] with BUBBLE STUDY: Findings: Sedation was achieved with propofol continuous IV infusion throughout the course of the procedure.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dynamic interatrial septum.
There is expected gyriform enhancement in the distribution of the infarct including enhancement of the right basal ganglia and caudate nucleus.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 19 yo woman with migraines, no other known stroke risk factors or PMH, no ocps or smoking, who presented with acute right MCA stroke, superior division, s/p IV TPA with no recannulization, then s/p angiography with revascularization of MCA achieved by balloon, no IA TPA.
Both a central line and arterial line were placed; she remained intubated until [**4-14**].
She was maintained on mannitol to decrease swelling.
She underwent daily CT scans for days due to the presence of edema and midline shift; neurosurgery was consulted for the possibility of hemicraniectomy to relieve swelling, but she did not need this procedure.
Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants were held for the first 48 hours following the TPA administration, then aspirin therapy was initiated.
The patient had a traumatic intubation and pharyngeal swelling/likely hematoma.
She was treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn to cover both the MRSA and hospital acquired organisms.
She required an NG tube for feeds after failing an initial swallow evaluation.
A PICC line was placed for ease of antibiotics after her central line was discontinued.
Eventually NG tube discontinued and taking po dysphagia diet with nectar thick liquids by time of discharge.
She was maintained on aspirin and lipitor.
