You were treated with an insulin drip and your DKA initially resolved.
However, you were not compliant with your diabetic diet and after eating fried chicken you redeveloped signs of DKA requiring a second insulin drip.
You developed further episodes of DKA during your hospitalization and each required insulin drip in the intensive care unit.
