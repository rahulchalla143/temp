Therefore, a PEG tube was placed by Interventional Radiology on [**2141-3-10**].
He tolerated this procedure very well and had no subsequent problems.
Neurosurgery subsequently recommended a lumbar drain to help facilitate closure of a presumed hole in the dural matter.
This drain was placed by the Neurosurgery team and left in place for five days.
He was subsequently transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit for intensive management.
He had a Foley catheter placed, an arterial line placed and a central venous line placed for better intravenous access.
He was also placed on an insulin drip and pan cultures were sent for a possible infectious disease workup.
Notable laboratories upon transfer were continued problems with glycemic control with blood sugars in the 400s as well as elevated transaminases.
They recommended a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor as his blood pressure tolerated.
Mr. [**Known lastname 46630**] was subsequently started on anticoagulation with heparin.
Once the lumbar drain was discontinued Mr. [**Known lastname 46630**] was switched to Lovenox therapy as a bridge towards Coumadin therapy with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.
He tolerated this procedure without any complication.
Mr. [**Known lastname 46630**] was also reevaluated by the Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy teams.
Mr. [**Known lastname 46631**] family has been kept abreast of all issues that have developed during his hospital stay and agree with placement at said institution.
Blood draws for INR/PT levels every two to three days until a goal INR is achieved.
Once this INR is achieved Lovenox therapy can be discontinued.
