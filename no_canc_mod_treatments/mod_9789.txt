Briefly 70 year old patient with alcoholic liver cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension s/p TIPS shunt placement in 04, with refractory ascites, grade I varices and atrial fibrillation not on tranplant list admitted s/p redo TIPS procedure.
Pt had episodes of encephalopathy and ascites requiring repeat paracentesis despite diuretics and was found to have occluded TIPS on ultrasound on [**12-18**] which was performed to evaluate heterogeneity seen on previous ultrasounds.
Patient was transiently on heparin which was discontinued as his repeat US showed improvement.
An attempt was made to place an NGT but his oxygen saturation dropped to 80s and was placed on 5L NC.
He was placed on NRB with oxygen sats to 98-100%.

Brief Hospital Course: 71 YO gentleman with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, refractory ascites s/p TIPS in [**2119**] found to have occluded TIPS by U/S in [**12-18**] now s/p redo TIPS on [**1-28**] with portal vein thrombosis s/p redo TIPS on [**1-30**].
Pt intubated on [**2124-2-1**] for airway protection secondary to agitation and encephalopathy.
He was also hypoxic, requiring nonrebreather on the floor likely seocndary to aspiration.
He subsequently required pressors which we were unable to wean.
He was empirically treated with Vanc/Zosyn for possible HAP given infiltrates on CXR and hypoxia but abx were discontinued [**2-3**] since pt developed a rash and did not have any clear source of infection with no positive culture data and no fever or elevated WBC.
MICU and GI team were unable to place an NGT for lactulose and rifaximin despite multiple attempts, most likely secondary to known esophageal stricture.
On [**2-2**], he was made DNR/DNI and on [**2-4**], he was made CMO and terminally extubated and pressors discontinued.
He was started on morphine drip on [**2-5**] and transferred to floor.
