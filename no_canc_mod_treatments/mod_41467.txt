The patient was continued on vancomycin and Zosyn for coverage of Staph epi bacteremia and pneumonia with MRSA in the sputum.
She continued on Zosyn for several more days and then was transferred to levo and Flagyl for further treatment of her pneumonia.
The patient required no further pressor support during her stay on the floor.
The team recommends that the patient have surveillance blood cultures drawn q week while the patient is on her vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl.
She will be treated for a 14 day course of antibiotics on the presumed diagnosis of repeat aspiration pneumonia.
The patient was continued on a low fat cardiac and honey-thickened liquid diet.
The patient should be continued on aspiration precautions with the head of her bed upright during mealtimes.
She was restarted on her Lasix dose at 20 mg p.o.
The patient did well on this regimen.
Her ins and outs should be monitored and if she appears dehydrated, her Lasix should be reduced.
Atrial fibrillation:  On the medical floor, the patient was continued on digoxin and her metoprolol was increased to 25 p.o.
The patient had just been started on levofloxacin and placed on Zosyn, which she is on previously.
Her Coumadin level was decreased from 2 to 1 q.h.s.
She should continue on the lower dose of Coumadin while the patient is on levofloxacin.
Once she discontinues her antibiotics, her Coumadin dose will likely need to be adjusted.
In addition, it should be monitored upon discontinuation of the levofloxacin for further adjustments of the Coumadin dose once the antibiotics are discontinued, as antibiotics can elevate her INR.
Access:  In the Intensive Care Unit, a right internal jugular central venous catheter had been placed.
The patient had a PICC placed under Interventional Radiology guidance on [**2105-4-6**] for the further two week course of vancomycin.
Her PICC catheter should be discontinued upon completion of her IV antibiotics.

In addition, she should have followup q2 days while she continues on the antibiotics to ensure her INR is in the therapeutic range.
In addition, she should have surveillance blood cultures drawn one week after discharge to ensure her treatment regimen is adequate.
She should also have repeat surveillance blood cultures drawn on discontinuation of antibiotics at two weeks.
