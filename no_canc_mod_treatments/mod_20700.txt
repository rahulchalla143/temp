She was loaded with Dilantin and intubated and transferred to [**Hospital 4415**] where a left ventricular drain was placed.
The patient was on Propofol and intubated with a vent draining when she was examined on admission.
The patient was treated with minimal splinting and currently did not require any surgical intervention for this fracture.
Neurological exam remained difficult to assess at times because of agitation from the ET tube with resultant increased ICP and decreased pCO2.
On [**2154-9-4**], the patient off sedation was very lethargic and slow to follow commands requiring heavy stimulation such as sternal rub to open eyes and squeeze with her right hand.
ICP's remained a max of 14, ventricular drain remained in place.
The patient was thus taken emergently to the Operating Room and underwent a right frontal craniectomy and duroplasty for intractable edema.
