2)EKG changes: New ST changes in V4-V6 with decreased amplitude after beta blocker in HR 70's.
Patient should not be on diltiazem for rate control since it causes hypotension.
Patient needs to be diuresised with lasix since he has large amount of pleural effusion to diuresis.
Levaquin and flagyl initially given at the ED but was held since pneumonia was thought unlikely.
Pt was diuresised with lasix while maintiaing good BP.
Pt should be diuresised further with Lasix 20-40 mg po qd, but this medication was not added to the discharge meds since it will be up to the PCP to monitor his fluid status.
We strongly encourace him to have his PCP start him on Lasix to remove further fluid.
