[**Known lastname 83147**] is a very nice 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on coumadin, s/p PPM, with myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2 weeks ago who comes with SOB, pericardial effusion and tamponade.
Pericardial Effusion - Patient with myocardial bridge and stent 2 weeks ago complicated with bleeding requiring baloon tamponade.
Then, she was started on coumadin 10 mg daily for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Patient was transfered to our Medical Center for pericardiosentesis given that OSH did not have cardiac surgery in case it was needed for bleeding from myocardial bridge and stent.
Her pressures were PCW 35/36/32, HR 109, PA 43/33/38, RV 47/25/30, dP/dt 624, RA 31/31/29, AO 131/88/104; 970 cc of bloody pericardial fluid were drained (HCT of 12).
Patient went to the cardiac care unit for observation overnight with pericardial drained placed.
Her coumadin was stopped.
Thoracic surgery was consulted regarding her clot and effusion and suggested conservative management.
She was able to tell us and manifest her full understanding of the risk of shortness of breath, recurring bleed, constrictive pericarditis requiring surgery in the near-future.
Rhythm - Patient with PAFib rate controlled with diltiazem 120 mg daily and was anticoagulated at home with 10 mg of coumadin.
Patient is in aspirin and plavix, which are not as good a warfarin, but less risk of bleeding as she did this time.
She was rate-controlled with her home-dose Digoxin 0.25 mg PO DAILY and her Diltiazem Extended-Release was increased to 240 mg PO DAILY given she was having RVR in the setting of atrial irritation after pericardial bleeding.
CAD - Patient with not known CAD, myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding as above.
Given the superiority of aspirin for coronary artery disease and stents, she underwent aspirin de-sensitation in the ICU.
She tolerated Aspirin 81 mg Daily and Plavix 75 mg Daily without complications.
She is also on Rosuvastatin Calcium 10 mg PO DAILY.
Dyslipidemia - Continuing pt pravastatin as above.

You were advised to stay in [**Location (un) 86**] for treatment but have decided to go home to FLA for this.
STOP taking Warfarin .
