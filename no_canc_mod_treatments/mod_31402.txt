Tracheostomy tube and PICC line remain in place.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Mr [**Known lastname 95403**] was intubated for airway protection and hypoxemia on arrival.
He was started on levofloxacin, ceftazidime and vancomycin to treat a healthcare-associated pneumonia (given recent nursing home residence) and possible UTI.
He was titrated down to FiO2 of 0.40, pressure support of 10 and PEEP of 5 by the 14th, and has been on these settings since then.
Accordingly, after discussion with his family, he had a bedside tracheostomy on [**12-24**] and was on a trach tube thereafter; still, his vent settings remained the same and he remained unable to tolerate spontaneous breathing trials.
Hopefully with further diuresis he can wean from the vent as there is no clear other reason he should not be able to.
This returned positive, and flagyl was started.
[**12-26**] is day 1 of 14 for treatment of this.
We considered several possible etiologies including toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, uremia, hypernatremia, PNA, UTI, and meningitis.
He had some clearly lucid periods in which he was able to shake his head or nod in response to questions and even occasionally to attempt to mouth words, though on the day of discharge he was arousable and tracked and registered his examiners but did not clearly answer questions.
(He had received a one-time dose of ativan in the night prior.)
His urine from his inital presentation grew out coag-negative staph, resistant to oxacillin and levofloxacin but sensitive to the vancomycin we had started by that time.
He will likely need further increasingly aggressive diuresis if he does not begin to autodiurese more vigorously, and will likely need furosemide plus another [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
# Hypernatremia: He was hypernatremic on arrival; this corrected with consistent hydration and free water boluses in his tube feeds.
# s/p CVA: Per neuro d/c summary, "at the time of discharge he could withdraw his right leg slightly, with plegia in the right arm and a right facial droop, as well as dysarthria.
- continue clopidogrel, atorvastatin .
We kept him on an insulin sliding scale, and also added glargine for baseline level.
He received a unit of packed red blood cells on [**12-14**] for a hematocrit of 21.4 which was dropping in the setting of aggressive hydration (a source of bleeding was not identified then or in retrospect).
He also received a unit of packed red blood cells on [**12-25**] for a hematocrit of 21.9, with the expectation that this would continue to drop, he would be leaving the ICU soon, and evaluation of his post-transfusion stability would be helpful before transfer.
His albumin did decline during this admission although the contribution of nutrition vs acute illness was difficult to know, and should be followed after discharge.

* Weaning from vent as tolerated * Treatment of C. diff infection; day 1 of 14 day course of metronidazole is [**12-26**] * Ongoing evaluation of mental status; not clear what new baseline will be at this point.
