FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH [**2192-1-13**]:  An endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned.
IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube appropriately positioned.
Brief Hospital Course: Given the severity of the hemorrhage and the need for intubation for airway protection, the patient was admitted to the neurologic ICU for further evaluation and management.
The patient was given FFP and Vitamin K to reverse his supratherapeutic INR in the setting of hemorrhage; INR dropped from 4.4 on presentation to 1.7 in the am.
He had a right hemiplegia and bilateral upgoing toes.
Neurosurgery, who had seen the patient on admission, and did not believe him to be a candidate for neurosurgical intervention, was therefore called again to re-evaluate the patient.
Once again, his hemorrhage was not considered amenable to surgical intervention.
