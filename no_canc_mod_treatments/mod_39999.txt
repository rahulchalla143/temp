He was referred to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**8-7**] for refusal to eat or drink and take medications at his previous nursing home, Sun Bridge [**Location (un) **].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Zyprexa 2.5 mg p.o.
q.d., Haldol 0.5 mg intramuscularly, zinc sulfate 220 mg p.o.
q.d., vitamin C 500 mg p.o.
q.d., Klonopin 0.25 mg q.8.h., multivitamin, Colace.
Of note, the patient is refusing to take all of these medications.
Albumin 3.3.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   In summary, this is a 65-year-old male with psychotic depression and schizoaffective disorder, who presented with decreased oral intake and aspiration pneumonia.
ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA:  The patient was treated with 14 days of intravenous levofloxacin and Flagyl.
These desaturations were thought to be due to aspirations because they resolved with aggressive suctioning.
The patient is currently on 3 liters of nasal cannula, but most likely will be weaned down to room air.
Since he was refusing all medications it was thought that the patient could be a candidate for electroconvulsive therapy treatment.
The patient was evaluated by anesthesia who felt that the patient could not undergo electroconvulsive therapy without being intubated.
It was thought, however, that if the patient was intubated he may not be able to be weaned off of the ventilator.
Also, since electroconvulsive therapy treatment requires multiple treatments over several days, it was felt that intubating the patient for this period of time would be unsafe.
The patient had refused MRI, and although the guardian had given approval for a MRI, the MRI was not able to be performed because the patient's son had interfered.
They also suggested a voiding antipsychotic such as Haldol which may causes exacerbation of the patient's contracted state.
