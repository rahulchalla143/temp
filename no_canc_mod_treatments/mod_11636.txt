Prenatal screens, B positive, antibody negative, GBS positive, Hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive.
The infant was born via a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery through meconium stained amniotic fluid with Apgar's of 4 and 8 at one and five minutes respectively.
There was normal facies, a soft anterior fontanel, sutures were opposed.
Supplemental Polycose was discontinued on day of life two and the infant has not needed maintained normal sugars since then.
He was started on double phototherapy for that.
After attempting a discontinuation of phototherapy three days after initiation, a rebound bilirubin was obtained which showed a level of 12.6, which was up from the prior day, hence, the infant was kept on phototherapy for an additional few days.
He has been off of phototherapy for over 24 hours and it seems as if he is having a resolution of his jaundice without the need for additional phototherapy.
We initially ascribed this to the presence of a large number of red cells with the significant by-products of red cell breakdown and subsequent conjugation of bilirubinemia and direct hyperbilirubinemia.
Antibiotics were not started.
Feeding:  At discharge, the infant is receiving mother's milk supplemented to 24 calories per ounce, using Enfamil Powder.
Immunizations received are none.
Would anticipate giving Hepatitis B once the infant reaches 2 kilograms of weight.
Polycythemia, resolved s/p partial exchange transfusion.
