HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 70 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis (aortic valve area 0.99, with a gradient of 68), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and left lobe lung cancer status post left pneumonectomy.
The patient had been diagnosed with pneumonia on [**2139-10-9**], and started a steroid and Levaquin.
The patient was treated as congestive heart failure with Nitroglycerin, lasix and Bi-PAP with chest PT.
The patient was started on Timentin and Vancomycin which was subsequently changed to Kefzol and Zithromax.
A Swan-Ganz was placed at the outside hospital on [**2139-10-28**] and showed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22.
Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2129**].
Solu-Medrol 30 mg intravenous q. six.
Nitroglycerin drip.
Allopurinol 100 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Zithromax 500 mg p.o.
Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o.
Cozaar 50 mg p.o.
Synthroid 0.075 mg p.o.
Lasix 40 mg intravenously q. day.
Epogen 40,000 units q. week.
Lovenox 40 mg q. day.
Hydralazine 25 mg intravenously q. six hours.
Swan-Ganz catheter showed a central venous pressure of 4.0.
Because Diltiazem caused the patient to become excessively bradycardic (in the 30s), it was felt that the patient should be rate controlled, but that a pacemaker should be placed to prevent excessive bradycardia.
During each of these episodes, intravenous Diltiazem was pushed and was successful in controlling the patient's rate.
Diltiazem dose was eventually increased to 240 mg q. day of sustained release and Dofetilide was started after pacemaker placement.
The patient was kept for three days in-house to be monitored while Dofetilide therapy was initiated.
He tolerated Dofetilide well.
This was felt not to be due to Dofetilide so much as to the patient's structural heart disease, but the dose of Dofetilide was decreased.
AORTIC STENOSIS:  After load reduction was achieved initially with Losartan 50 mg p.o.
q. day with intravenous Hydralazine being used for acute blood pressure elevations.
Eventually, the patient was put on Losartan 100 mg p.o.
q. day and Hydralazine was no longer necessary for blood pressure control.
So it was decided to best mobilize the patient's fluid by placing compression stockings on his legs and giving him Lasix 40 mg intravenously q. day.
He was continued on a Prednisone taper and treated with Atrovent and Albuterol nebulizers with chest PT.
As the patient continued to diurese, the lasix was decreased to 30 mg p.o.
After the pacemaker placement the patient was restarted on Coumadin.
The patient also received Vancomycin for two days when he received his pacemaker and three days of Keflex after that.
It should also be noted that the patient cannot tolerate beta blockers or ACE inhibitors.
Beta blockers cause bronchospasm and ACE inhibitors cause angioedema.
PHYSICAL THERAPY:  The patient was seen by Physical Therapy and treatment was initiated.
Since he has only received three days of Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
q day of Prednisone for three days, then 20 mg p.o.
q. day of Prednisone for three days, then 10 mg p.o.
q. day of Prednisone for three days.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.
Dofetilide 125 micrograms p.o.
Keflex 500 mg p.o.
Diltiazem Extended Release 240 mg p.o.
Losartan 100 mg p.o.
Atrovent and Albuterol nebulizers, one to two nebulizers q. four to six hours p.r.n.
Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
Prednisone 30 mg p.o.
Zolpidem tartrate 5 mg p.o.
Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o.
Levothyroxine 75 micrograms p.o.
Allopurinol 100 mg p.o.
Fexaphenadine 60 mg p.o.
Erythropoietin alpha 40,000 units subcutaneously one time per week on Thursdays.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post pacemaker placement, on Dofetilide and Diltiazem.
