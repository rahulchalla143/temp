The patient lives in [**Location 9012**] but came to the [**Hospital1 18**] to have stent removal performed via rigid bronchoscopy.
This procedure was successfully performed on hospital day #1, but post procedure, the patient experienced severe coughing secondary to mucous secretions and as such, he had to be admitted for further evaluation.
He was switching from outpatient linezolid to vancomycin without consequence.
He underwent a tracheobronchoplasty on [**2153-11-12**] without complication.
Upon discharge, he had planned follow-up with thoracic surgery in [**1-5**] weeks.
2) h/o CHF: The patient's outpatient regimen of lasix was continue.
After extensive renal work-up, it was felt that this increase was due to acute interstitial nephritis secondary medications, with the likely etiology piperacillin which the patient had been started on for Serratia found on one of his bronchoscopy  wash cultures.
This medication was discontinued and switched to Levoquin.
