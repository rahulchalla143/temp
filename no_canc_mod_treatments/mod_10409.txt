Levofloxacin and Flagyl were administered for possible pneumonia.
The patient also received nebulizer treatment of supplemental O2 with an increase in his O2 sats to the 98 to 100% range and decrease in respiratory rate to the 30s.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2126**], moderate to severe inferior wall defect partially reversible, ejection fraction 60%, status post two myocardial infarctions in the past.
Cardiac arrest status post coronary artery bypass graft on Amiodarone.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin, Plavix, Levoxyl, Prozac, Lipitor, Coumadin, Lasix, Spironolactone, Protonix, Metoprolol, Amiodarone.
For several days he continued to be tachypneic and was maintained either on nonrebreather or biPAP machine.
He ultimately needed to be intubated given a decompensating respiratory status.
He was maintained on an antibiotic course of Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone for pneumonia.
He ultimately needed pressors in order to maintain a mean arteriole pressure above a goal of 60 on [**2128-11-29**].
He was on a total of three pressors, Levo at 10.6, neo at 140 and Vasopressin at .02.
The family agreed to discontinue the pressors as well as ventilatory support and the patient passed away soon afterwards.
