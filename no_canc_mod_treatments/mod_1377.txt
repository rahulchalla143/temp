OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - AFlutter s/p ablation, then tachy-brady s/p PPM - Aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2) - Chronic AF: previously on coumadin, stopped [**1-28**] epistaxis, hematomas, frequent falls (now s/p IVC filter) - dCHF(Moderate-severe R dCHF, moderate L dCHF) - HCM - COPD on home O2 - OSA - Hypothyroid - Chronic Renal insufficiency - MRSA old wound and sputum - s/p IVC filter - s/p fracture of lower sacrum/upper coccyx [**2-5**] - Spinal Stenosis, s/p multiple interventions - Prostate Cancer - BPH - Chronic Fatigue - right rotator cuff injury - arthritis shoulders and knees (cortisone injections) - s/p multiple back surgeries - SBO s/p resection c/b post-op GI bleed in setting of elevated INR  Social History: Retired; former occupation was research and development of jet engines x45 years.
An aortic [**Month/Day/Year **] prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
A well-seated aortic [**Month/Day/Year **] prosthesis is present.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and post-procedure echo showed resolution of aortic stenosis with a well-seated valve, with an EF of 55%.
During his last admission, he was diuresed with Lasix 40mg IV bolus once, and achieved euvolemia.
Home torsemide and metoprolol were continued.
# CAD: Pt is s/p stent to LAD and D1 ([**4-/2106**]) and s/p diagonal stent ([**2106**]).
- continue home metoprolol tartrate 25mg PO bid, pravastatin 20mg daily and ASA 81mg.
# Atrial Flutter: Pt has history of AFlutter s/p ablation, then tachy-brady s/p PPM.
We continued home digoxin 0.125 and home metoprolol tartrate 25 [**Hospital1 **].
He did have a bit of oozing from his left groin site, this was fixed with local lido/epi and pressure bandages.
Given his several hospitalizations for epistaxis we discussed the risk benefit of anticoagulation with his hematologist/oncologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**], who agreed with us that given his CHADS2 score of 4 with an annual stroke rate of 8% and no major bleeds, anticoaggulation would still be indicated, and the patient agreed with this plan.
His symptoms were thought to be due to a viral gastrointestinal syndrome and resolved with supportive measures prior to his procedure.
Patient has a recent GI bleed admission in [**2109**] with stable HCTs and colonscopy being a poor study but EGD showing erosive gastritis.
He received 1 unit of PRBCs for a HCT of 25.5, and discharge HCT was 28.
The patient's PCP will be notified of his anemia and that a screening colonoscpy (given the poor study) would be indicated in the future.
