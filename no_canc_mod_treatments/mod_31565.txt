Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2129-3-14**] and underwent Left superficial femoral artery to posterior tibial artery bypass graft using 6 mm ringed Propaten.

3 drug eluding stents were placed in the RCA and the pt tolerated the procedure well.
He was started on plavix for the DES, and continued on iv heparin, and started on coumadin for PAD.
