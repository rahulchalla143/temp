His exam was limited by sedation for much of his early stay, but he consistently had little to no movement on his left side, but would follow commands on the right.
A CT scan here showed progression from the outside scan, and despite normal coags, he was given Factor 7 as it was not known whether his bleeding continued.
His ICP remained in the 7-10 range with the drain and when clamped, it stabilized out at ~14.
The drain was removed.
The patient was kept sedated as he became very agitated when off sedation and his BP would rise above goal ranges.
This was narrowed to levofloxacin when the sensitivities returned.
However, as the fevers continued, he was expanded back to vancomycin and ceftazidime.
This was done and showed meningitis; fevers resolved on antibiotics and the external ventricular drain was removed.
He requires further antibiotic treatment until [**7-20**].
He was started on metoprolol and lisinopril, with prn hydralazine being used.
Hydralazine will be titrated down, since lisinopril was switched to captopril.
When sufficient bp control is achieved, hydralazine should be d/c'd, with further increase in captopril if necessary.
5.He was put on tube feeds and tolerated these well throughout.
