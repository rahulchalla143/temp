MRI of  C-SPINE:[**2192-2-11**] Subluxation of C6 over C7 with appearances suggestive of a flexion injury and disruption of the posterior longitudinal, interspinous and anterior longitudinal ligaments and anterior subluxation of C6 over C7.
MR CERVICAL SPINE; MR THORACIC SPINE;LUMBAR SPINE [**2192-2-18**] [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 84 year old man with s/p cervical fusion, decreased lower extremity movement  TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial images of the cervical and thoracic spine were acquired.
FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the patient has undergone spinal fixation for correction of previously seen fracture subluxation at C6-7 level.
Laminectomy is seen from C3-4 to C6-7 level with pedicle screws from C5 to T1 level.
IMPRESSION: Since the previous MRI study, the patient has undergone fusion for previously noted subluxation at C6-7 level.
A CT of his head demonstrated a hazy area of increased attenuation along the medial right frontal lobe, which was unclear whether it was secondary to previously administered IV contrast or a small amount of subarachnoid blood.
An left radial arterial line and a left subclavian central line were placed and he was transferred from the ED to the ICU.
He was given Solumederol and Dilantin and kept NPO for surgery.
Since he had been on coumadin for a previous DVT (INR 1.6), he had to be corrected with 2 units of FFP and vitamin K.  On HD 2, a repeat head CT showed a small focus of hyperdensity along the medial border of the right frontal lobe concerning for an intraparenchymal hemorrhage, as well as a small (4mm width) subdural fluid collection concerning for a small subdural effusion.
An MRI of his spine showed a subluxation of C6 over C7 with appearances suggestive of a flexion injury and disruption of the posterior longitudinal, interspinous and anterior longitudinal ligaments and anterior subluxation of C6 over C7.
He was taken to the OR where he had a posterior cervical laminectomy with fusion of C4-C7 and evacuation of an epidural hematoma by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14354**] [**Name (STitle) **].
The operation went well with no complications (please see operative note for details), however he did require an emergent tracheostomy for a difficult intubation by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6633**].
He did lose about 1 liter of blood during the operatuion and required 2500 ml of crystalloid, 4 units of FFP, 5 units of RBCs, 1 unit of platelets and 2 units of cryoprecipitate.
He was maintained on lung protective ventillation (high PEEP, high frequency, low tital volume).
He recieved perioperative empiric gentamycin vancomycin.
He was also on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
He required a levophed drip for blood pressure control (goal SBP 130-140).
On POD 1, he was started on mannitol 25 g Q 6 hours for 48 hours.
Cardiology was consulted due to his elevated troponins and they recommended aspirin (when stable), B-blockers to keep the HR at 60, and an echocardiogram.
Tube feeds were started via an NG tube (impact with fiber, goal 85 cc/h).
He had good biceps and shoulder shrug, but no triceps or grip strength.
An IVC filter was placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (due to his past DVT and current contraindications to anticoagulation).
His WBC climbed from 12.4 to 15.9 and he had a temperature of 100, so he was started on Vancomycin and Levaquin for pneumonia.
He was able to tolerate a trach mask and was weaned off of the ventillator.
A PEG tube was placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (please see operative note for details).
Tube feeds were restarted but held overnight due to increased residuals.
They recommended diuresis with lasix to a goal of 500 to 1000 ml negative for the [**Known lastname **] and we were able to accomplish this.
Free water was added to his tube feeds due to hypernatremia.
On POD 9, vancomycin was discontinued.
On POD 11, nystatin swisha dn swallow was started for oral thrush.
On POD 12, levaquin was discontinued as he completed his course for pneumonia.
His sputum grew MRSA, but medicine recommended witholding treatment unless there were signs of infection.
Lasix was held since he was euvolemic.
Trache cuff MUST BE DEFLATED while using passimuir valve.
His tube feeds restarted slowly (@10ml/hr to goal of 85 ml/hr)on [**2-28**], no more emesis noted since the event, and LFT's has been slowly trending down.
Physical therapy and occupational therapy felt that he would need acute rehab placement, see attached note for the recommendation for rehab.
