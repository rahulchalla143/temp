Placement of right chest tube.
[**2193-7-10**]- neck exploration and closure  [**2193-7-13**] - EGD [**2193-7-15**] - EGD [**2193-7-19**] - EGD  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 50M found in the car with multiple stab wounds.
In the ER, b/l chest tubes were placed and agressive resuscitation was initiated for acedemia nd hypovolemia.
He received 6L fluids and 27u pRBC between the ED and the OR.
The patient was transferred to the Trauma Surgery ICU for further resuscitation.
Past Medical History: Remote dysthymia (tx with fluoxetine then paroxetine [**2183**]-[**2185**]), lupus (x7 years in remission, baseline Cr = 1.3), hypertension (goal BP < 125/75), GERD, asthma  Social History: Lives with wife and 2 children, no tobacco, EtOH, or illicits   Family History: None  Physical Exam: Exam on Admission:  General: Intubated, sedated HEENT: Right sided neck laceration 8 cm, central laceration with arterial bleed, 10 cm left neck laceration through the muscle without active bleed C. collar on Chest: Decreased breath sounds, bilateral chest lacerations Cardiovascular: Regular Rate and Rhythm, Normal S1, S2 Abdominal: Soft, Nontender Extr/Back: Bilateral AC lacerations with active bleeding, R radial laceration, B groin lacerations that are bleeding slowly, B posterior Knee lacerations - not bleeding   Pertinent Results: EEG [**2107-7-13**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Two chest tubes on the right and one on the left.
He initially required massive resuscitation including 29u pRBC, 12 plasma, 5 platelets, 4 cryo and factor VII.
He was taken urgently to the operating room on HD 1 for neck exploration and control of bleeding.
Once stabilized, he was taken back to the ICU for further management.
He had seizure activity overnight on HD 2; an EEG on HD 3 showed no seizure activity but did show clonic jerks.
He continued to require neosynephrine during persistent episodes of upper GI bleeding, and this requirement increased significantly [**7-20**] prior to withdrawal of care.
Pulm: He remained intubated postoperatively.
For his rib fractures and pneumothorax two chest tubes were placed.
The tube feeds were held.
GI was consulted and performed UGI at bedside on HD 5; this demonstrated diffuse ulcers with clot but no active bleed.
He was continued on a protonix drip and started on sucralfate.
His Hct dropped from 25 to 17 on HD 6; GI and IR were reconsulted to consider possible intervention.
He underwent two additional EGDs on [**7-15**] and [**7-19**] without a localization of a specific bleeding source.
He required daily blood product transfusion to maintain his hematocrit.
Discussion regarding possible interventional radiology embolization or surgical treatment including gastrectomy were discussed at length with the patient's wife, and the decision not to pursue further invasive treatment was made on [**7-19**].
He continued to have bloody output from the NG tube and continued on a PPI gtt until withdrawal of care.
His creatinine continued to rise despite fluid resuscitation and blood pressure support.
