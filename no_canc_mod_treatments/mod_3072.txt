Admission Date:  [**2120-7-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2120-7-30**]                                                 (Anticipated) Date of Birth:   [**2069-2-24**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICINE HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of hypertension, anxiety disorder and substance abuse who was admitted to the [**Hospital3 17309**] intensive care unit on [**2120-6-27**], two days after undergoing an uncomplicated right knee arthroscopy as an but had become progressively more lethargic over the course of the second day following surgery.
She was hypotensive, requiring Levophed at 20 mg pressure in the 80s to 90s.
She was also hypoxemic, requiring 100% oxygen with a nonrebreather mask.
She was aggressively fluid resuscitated and started on empiric antibiotics.
The patient was weaned off pressors there initially and her renal function returned to baseline with resolution of her acidosis.
Her chest x-ray looked markedly worsened and she began to spike high fevers,and was hypotensive again requiring pressors to keep her blood pressure in the 80s to 90s.
Celebrex 100 mg p.o.
Inderal 10 mg p.o.
Neurontin 600 mg p.o.
Clonidine 0.2 mg p.o.
Lisinopril 20 mg p.o.
Norvasc 20 mg p.o.
Synthroid 75 mcg p.o.
ADDITIONAL MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: Levophed drip at 10 mcg per minute.
Ativan drip at 10 mg per minute.
Morphine drip at 4 mg per minute.
Ceftazidime 1 gm intravenous every eight hours started on [**2120-7-3**].
Vancomycin 1 gm intravenous every 24 hours started on [**2120-7-3**].
Reglan 10 mg intravenous every six hours.
Her vent settings were assist control with tidal volume of 400, respiratory rate of 20, PEEP of 20, FiO2 of 90%, PIP of 35-40 and plateau of 24-25.
A right internal jugular catheter was in place.
A Foley catheter was in place, draining yellow clear urine.
The tip of the endotracheal tube was in the right main bronchus with complete collapse of the left lung.
PULMONARY:  The patient was transferred here intubated on high pressure ventilatory support.
Her ventilator settings were a PEEP of 20, an FiO2 of 1.0, a PIP of 40 and a plateau of 35.
She was treated for aspiration pneumonia with a full course of Levaquin and Flagyl.
As there was some evidence for the use of steroids in the setting of adult respiratory distress syndrome, the patient was started on Solu-Medrol.
She was started on Solu-Medrol on [**2120-7-20**].
The patient continued to be dependent on a ventilator for oxygenation/ventilation but was able to tolerate the switch to pressure support and was currently on pressure support.
She will require a long-term, gradual wean from the ventilator.
The patient underwent a tracheotomy procedure, given her long-term ventilator dependence.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was transferred here requiring pressor support for hypotension secondary to sepsis versus hypovolemia.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed on hospital day #5 to evaluate her pulmonary artery pressures, which were found to be elevated at 66/40.
She was aggressively diuresed with improved ventilation and oxygenation.
After that time, her blood pressure was stable and she did not require further pressors.
There was a likely pulmonary component to her decompensation, including an aspiration pneumonia for which Flagyl and Levaquin were started and a full 14 day course was completed.
Vancomycin was started on [**2120-7-9**] for a positive blood culture from a central line.
The central line was pulled and she was treated for a total of ten days for her line infection.
She was currently on vancomycin for that and will have a total ten day course of treatment for that.
Her hematocrit was closely monitored while she was here and she did not require further transfusions.
She continued on heparin for a positive left femoral deep vein thrombosis, probably secondary to the left femoral central line that was placed at [**Hospital3 17309**].
She was treated with bicarbonate and acetate acid and her renal function had improved.
The patient was initially placed on total parenteral nutrition; however, she was transferred to tube feeds on hospital day #8.
She continued to have good bowel function at goal tube feeds and a PEG tube was placed by the surgical team on [**2120-7-26**].
DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS:  The patient was found to have a left femoral deep vein thrombosis for which intravenous heparin was started.
She was switched to Coumadin when her PEG tube was placed.
She will need at least six months of anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis.
