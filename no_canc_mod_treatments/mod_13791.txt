Was treated with ceftriaxone 2gm IV daily with multiple repeat paracenteses.
Patient was continued on nadolol (as bp tolerated) and lactulose) ## Renal failure: Creatinine elevation appears to be related to both elevated abdominal pressures from ascites as well as to attempts at diuresis.
Patient became increasingly hypotensive with a rising cr, eventually becoming pressor dependent.
