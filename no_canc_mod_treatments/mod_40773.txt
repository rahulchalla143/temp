She had a coronary artery bypass graft in [**2188-5-20**], which was complicated by graft failures requiring coronary artery bypass graft.
She also had repeat catheterization and coronary artery stenting complicated by ventricular fibrillation.
She had a prolonged Intensive Care Unit stay and had placement of a tracheostomy and a percutaneous gastrostomy tube.
Her hospitalization required ventilatory support and the patient had been treated for pneumonia.
She had a tracheostomy and was slowly weaned for ventilation failure and was treated for line infections.
The patient was eventually transferred to rehabilitation for further care.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2188-5-20**], complicated by thrombosis of her bypass grafts and ventricular fibrillation .
The patient had a prolonged ventilatory wean and was tracheostomy dependent and had a gastrostomy tube placed.
The patient had a living related renal transplant in [**2185**], with graft failure in [**2188-10-20**], again during the ventricular arrest.
The patient is status post cerebrovascular accident and has a depressed ejection fraction.
The patient has a history of tracheostomy and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
The patient has a history of being Heparin antibody positive and a history of zoster.
There was some purulent discharge from her percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy site.
LABORATORY DATA:  Her laboratory examination was significant for a white blood cell count of 9.4, creatinine of 1.8, albumin 2.9.
The plan was to keep her NPO and continue decompression and obtain an abdominal CT scan.
She was discharged to rehabilitation on 60 mg of steroids, who presented with abdominal pain and tenderness on examination.
The patient had nasogastric tube placed.
At this point, it was found that the gastrostomy tube had eroded through her stomach and was freely floating in her abdominal cavity.
During the operation the gallbladder was necrotic and we performed open cholecystectomy, performed a biopsy of the liver and repaired the stomach where the old gastrostomy tube site was in place in a two layer closure.
The skin incision over the gastrostomy tube was left open.
The patient remained intubated and was taken to the Intensive Care Unit for postoperative care.
The patient's postoperative course was a stormy course over the next two weeks.
The patient developed progressive multisystem organ failure despite the institution of CVPHD to manage her dialysis needs as well as her fluid status.
She developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and she was placed on Amiodarone.
She developed large pleural effusions which were tapped and she had a chest tube placed to drain large pleural effusions.
She developed progressive hypotension requiring multiple pressors and she required progressive and increasing amounts of ventilatory support including high dose FIO2.
However, despite our maximum care including multiple pressors, CVPHD, multiple broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics and despite pulmonary consultations and infectious disease consultation, the patient did not make any progress and progressed with multisystem organ dysfunction and multisystem organ failure despite being on Vancomycin, Imipenem, Acyclovir, having multiple line tips cultured and being pancultured.
On [**2189-1-9**], she was made comfort measures only.
Her pressors were discontinued and she subsequently expired thirty minutes later.
