Of note, he says he stopped taking his lasix 1 month ago because he was told by his PCP to do so, however, PCP's letter does not support this.
He also reports some sodium indiscretions including occasional bacon and corned hash.
Per EMS report, he was saturating in the 60s on room air and was given supplemental O2 and lasix 40mg IV ONCE.
He was still hypoxic and tachypneic in the ED, and was therefore given another 40mg of lasix IV in the ED and was initiated on bipap.
A nitro gtt was ordered but never given secondary to hypotension.
His saturations and tachypnea improved however but he still remained on 4LNC as he was found to be 89% on RA.
He refused a foley therefore it was difficult to discern how much urine output response he had.
He was given labetolol for RVR rate control but became hypotensive and given dopamine.
He was diuresed with lasix and called out to the regular floor with continued improvement.
He was not anticoaggulated [**1-15**] frequent falls, but started on ASA 325 daily and discharged to rehab.

CHF: echo [**2-15**] with trivial MR, LVEF 40-45%, apical/ant/inf hypokinesis 5. h/o basal cell CA 6. h/o squamous cell CA of skin 7.
New onset a fib [**11-22**] not on coumadin [**1-15**] falls.
The overall left ventricular systolic function is similar although additional new wall motion abnormalities cannot be excluded given suboptimal image quality.
Brief Hospital Course: 88 yo male with history of CAD, DM with significant neuropathy, HTN, CHF with EF 40-45% in [**2176**] who presented to the ED on [**2183-1-23**] with acute dyspnea in the setting of recent discontinuation of lasix and dietary indiscretions.
He was restarted on lasix 40mg as he was prescribed with good effect in the past.
His BP meds were initially held but isosorbide and metoprolol were restarted prior to discharge.
His lisinopril was held and he was asked to discuss this with his PCP and cardiologist as an outpatient.
He was given both metoprolol and diltiazem while in the MICU.
His SVT was likely related to missing several doses of metoprolol as well as volume shifts with diuresis in the setting of an abnormal LA.
Of note, he did receive a new diagnosis of AFib from [**Hospital3 **] but is not on coumadin due to many recent falls.
He was continued on aspirin with cards evaluation planned as an outpatient as above.
