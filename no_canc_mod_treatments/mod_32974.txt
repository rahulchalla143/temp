Plavix was allowed to washout of his system.
On [**2129-6-7**], Mr. [**Known lastname 953**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels with ligation of his left atrial appendage.
He remained on pressors and intubated overnight.
He remained intubated for a prolonged postoperative period due to hemodynamic instability as well as thick secretions impairing his ventilation/oxygenation status.
By POD#7 Mr.[**Known lastname 953**] was weaned off all pressors and inotropes.
He was treated with antibiotics for positive staph sputum culture and he was aggressively diuresed to optimize his potential for extubation.
POD#13 Ventilator weaning continued until an episode of flash pulmonary edema which required increased ventilatory support.
All lines and drains were removed in a timely fashion.
Over the next several days Mr.[**Known lastname 953**] remained in the CVICU due to his state of confusion, refusing medications and nutrition, requiring Haldol and need for pulmonary management.
Sleep consult was called and CPAP was initiated for obstructive sleep apnea.
Full anticoagulation was attained with Coumadin for his rate controlled, chronic atrial fibrillation.
Beta-blocker, Digoxin, aspirin and statin were initiated once blood pressure and heart rate would tolerate.
Speech and swallow evaluated oral and pharyngeal dysphagia with recommendations for nectar thickened/ground solid advancement of po intake and tube feeds over night.
Wound care was also consulted for skin impairments and heel ulcerations.
Given his delirium, it was recommended to continue Haldol twice daily and prn, optimize non-psychopharm measures(frequent reorientation, emphasize sleep wake cycle, dimming lights at night) and minimize benozodiazepines, opiates and anti-cholinergics.
A u/a was also check which was positive and the patient was started on Bactrim.
By POD# 35 he continued to progress and he was cleared for discharge to rehab for further increase in strength, endurance and conditioning.
