After convalescence, the patients prolonged intubation and open tracheostomy precipitated tracheal stenosis necessitating multipple attempts at tracheal stenting.
This was not a satisfactory long-term solution so she presented for definitive surgical revision.

She went to operation on [**2-8**] for a cervical tracheal resection, primary tracheoplasty/reconstruction with a local tissue flap and an aspiration bronchoscopy of her tracheobronchial tree.
By POD#1, she was able to get out of bed with assistance, tolerate a regular diet, take pain medications by mouth and be heplocked.
By POD#6, she had completed a 5 day course of peri-operative clindamycin and was given a therapeutic bronchoscopy by the Interventional Pulmonary service.
The repair appeared adequate and her tracheo-bronchial secretions were therapeutically aspirated.
