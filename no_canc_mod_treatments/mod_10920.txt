The patient was sent to [**Hospital3 3583**] where he received Lopressor, sublingual Nitroglycerin, a Nitro drip and Morphine.
He received thrombolytic therapy there and was placed on a Heparin drip at 1700 units per hour.
At 4 p.m. that afternoon his pulse was 74, blood pressure 126/81, however, the patient continued to have chest pain despite the thrombolytic therapy and was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**].
At the time of cath we did Angioject and stenting of the LAD, however, even after stenting we had slow flow so intercoronary Diltiazem was given and results were 0% residual lesion with timi III flow.
At that time it was felt that the right coronary artery was high risk and they were going to place intraaortic balloon pump at the time of cath, however, due to loss of the femoral sheath, it was not done at that time and the patient was sent to the CCU.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient's vitals were pulse 76, blood pressure 129/78, breaths 24 and satting 98% on four liters.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on no medications except for an herbal supplement for the last 4-5 weeks that contains Ephedrine.
Vitals were pulse 76, respirations 24, blood pressure 128/78, O2 saturation 98% on four liters.
On the second catheterization they noted the RCA had diffusely diseased mid vessel, 100% post AM branch with bridging collaterals and right to left collaterals, however, they were not able to pass a wire through the lesion and it was deemed to be too risky to intervene at that time.
The patient returned to the floor, his lipid levels were checked and it was noted he has a total cholesterol of 219, triglycerides 559, HDL 29 and LDL could not be calculated due to the high triglycerides.
The patient had an uneventful hospital course, was sent out to the floor, had no further chest pain, was set up with cardiac rehab and was sent out on Lipitor, Wellbutrin, Nicotine patch, sublingual Nitroglycerin, Aspirin, Plavix and Lopressor, Captopril.
