Her hypotension was thought to be secondary to decreased CO prior to her interventional cath.
An echo done in the ED revealed no evidence of tamponade with global hypokinesis of her LV.
Her cath revealed: LAD: 30% prox, 90% distal, 60% 1st sm diag, LCx: 90% OM1 at origin, 90% OM1 mid, RCA: 50% prox, 50% mid, 80% distal, 99% PDA, SVG: OM w/ 90% long restenosis in Cypher Stents, vein to postlat, RCA: patent w/ patent stent prox.
Angioplasty of her OM graft was performed with a 4.0 balloon.
Initial hemodymanics in the MICU: PA 35/16, PCWP 16, CO 4.5, CI 2.6, SVR 852, SvO2 66%.
The patient was started on Integrelin for 18 hours, ASA, plavix, lipitor, and Metoprolol titrated to 50 [**Hospital1 **] post procedure.
The following day she was noted to have a new femoral bruit over her right groin at the cath site.
The patient was scheduled to have brachytherapy prior to discharge however the procedure was postponed to a later date if indicated at that time.
Pt was successfully extubated after aggressive diuresis with lasix.
The pt improved clinically with diuresis (net neg 1.3 L) and angioplasty.
She was initially started on captopril 25 tid, then changed to lisinopril 40 prior to discharge.
She was not restarted on Isosobide Dinitrate secondary to her relatively low [**Name (NI) **].
Her hct remained stable over the rest of her hospital stay and therefore, we did not feel it was indicated to check a CT of her Right groin for a retroperitoneal bleed.
Pt reports a h/o chronic amenia of unkown origin requiring iron supplemenation, which was continued during her hospital stay.
