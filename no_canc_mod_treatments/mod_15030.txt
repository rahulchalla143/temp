The patient reports occasional episodes of vomiting and diarrhea initially, however, after two days, the frequency and severity progressively worsened to approximately 10-30 episodes per day of bilious nonbloody vomiting, and 10-30 episodes per day of brown-watery diarrhea with little to no oral intake for approximately three days.
The patient denies fever, chills, rash, arthralgias, headache, cough, recent travel, sick contacts, toxic ingestions, as well as exposures.
In the outside hospital Emergency Department, patient was found afebrile and hemodynamically stable with positive serum and urine ketones (ABG 7.21/23/86/95% on room air), anion gap 34, normal serum glucose, and negative serum toxin screen except for salicylates.
The patient was treated with 2 liters of normal saline without significant change in his blood pH, which was subsequently changed to normal saline with 5 amps of sodium bicarb.
Of note, the patient recalls two prior episodes when he developed similar prodrome of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and weakness.
A family friend, who is a physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4351**] treated the patient with antiemetics and his symptoms resolved without need for official medical attention.
Patient was [**Name10 (NameIs) 4351**] treated with IV hydration that corrected his anion gap acidosis and discharged to home from the Emergency Department.
A subsequent Gastroenterology workup for his elevated liver function tests included a right upper quadrant ultrasound, as well as blood work evaluating possible infectious, toxic, or immunologic causes.
Gait deferred, cerebellar intact, finger-to-nose and rapid-alternating movements.
Chem-7 with a sodium of 137, potassium 4.9, chloride 92, bicarb 11, BUN 23, creatinine 1.2, and glucose of 72.
Initial blood work at [**Hospital1 69**]: Chem-7 with a sodium of 134, potassium 6.9, chloride 96, bicarb 10, BUN 19, creatinine 1.2, and glucose of 105 (notable for a gross hemolysis).
The patient received aggressive hydration, initially with D5 half normal saline (x3 liters), eventually changed to lactated ringers with the addition of bicarbonate drip (2 liters with 3 amps of sodium bicarb) for persistent metabolic acidosis.
Patient's strength also progressively improved with downtrending heart rate as well as respiratory rate.
Serial laboratories were notable for a persistent anion gap acidosis, mild transaminitis, AST greater than ALT, uptrending creatinine kinase to greater than 4,000, macrocytosis, and persistent large blood acetone.
After aggressive IV hydration in the Medical [**Last Name (Titles) 15593**] Care Unit, the patient began to auto-diurese with approximately 13 liters urine output over duration of four days.
The trend in liver function tests paralleled the patient's CKs with a peak ALT of 417, AST 1,230, LDH 2,670, with normal total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.
Based on their evaluation, Neurology suggested a primary myopathy as the source of the patient's metabolic derangements and proximal muscle weakness.
The Neurology service recommended obtaining EMG to differentiate between inflammatory or noninflammatory myopathy as well as a metabolic workup including serum pyruvate, ammonia, and carnitine.
