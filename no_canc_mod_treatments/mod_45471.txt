Gastrointestinal bleed:  After transfer out of the medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient's hematocrit remained stable and did not require any further transfusions.
All of his anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents were held and will continue to be held.
It was decided with the family in the medical Intensive Care Unit that no further gastrointestinal procedures were to be done, but that if the patient required transfusions, transfusions will be given.
Hypotension: The patient had no further issues with hypotension and maintains normal heart rates and blood pressures on just beta-blocker and digoxin for rate control for his atrial fibrillation.
He was continued on Zosyn and Levaquin was also initiated for double coverage of pseudomonas.
Methicillin resistant staph aureus: The patient had a history of MRSA in the sacral decubitus ulcers and was continued on vancomycin renally dosed and will be continued on this for at least four weeks.
His rate is controlled well on Lopressor and digoxin.
He will receive one dose of Medronate 60 mg IV before discharge to prevent calcium deposition in his wound.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient's aspirin will continue to be held in the face of gastrointestinal bleeding.
His beta-blocker was restarted at a lower dose and this may be slowly titrated back up as his blood pressure tolerates.
He was maintained on his NPH insulin and sliding scale.
He is to continue Epogen injection as well as phosphate binders.
The family decided to continue with antibiotics, transfusions as necessary and hemodialysis at this time.
