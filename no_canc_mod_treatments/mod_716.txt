HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of polycystic kidney disease, status post cadaveric renal transplant in [**2190**], on Rapamune, prednisone and Gengraf.
The patient has a history of polycystic liver disease with recent cyst infections treated with IV antibiotics recently, presents with 2 week history of fevers up to 101, chills, malaise and shortness of breath with increasing abdominal distention and right upper quadrant pain.
The patient has a history of polycystic kidney disease with also polycystic liver disease with multiple large liver cysts, one of which became infected secondarily with a pansensitive pseudomonas following episode of ERCP induced cholangitis and bacteremia in [**2195-8-20**].
He was drained in [**2195-10-20**], and treated with 6 weeks of Cipro plus 2 weeks of Augmentin for an unidentified gram positive cocci through late [**Month (only) 404**].
He was started on oral Cipro as an outpatient.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Polycystic kidney disease, hypertension, GERD, endstage renal disease, status post cadaveric renal transplant in [**2190**], CHF, biliary stones, diverticulosis, chronic pancreatitis, cholestasis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Cadaveric renal transplant in [**2190**], biliary stenting and an AV fistula.
MEDICATIONS:  At home, prednisone 5 mg, Lopressor 75 mg p.o.
b.i.d., cyclosporin 25 mg b.i.d., doxazosin, Rapamune 1 mg p.o.
daily, Protonix, allopurinol 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o.
daily, and Bactrim single strength daily.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was started on IV Zosyn and vancomycin renally dosed with IV hydration and cardiology was consulted.
After a right subclavian catheter was inserted, chest x-ray confirmed placement.
He was started on IV vancomycin and Zosyn on admission.
He remained in the surgical intensive care unit for a prolonged period of time during which time he received CVVHD for fluid overload.
He also experienced atrial fibrillation and required an amiodarone drip.
He had an abdominal J-P and was draining large amounts of serosanguineous fluids as high as 1.5 liter per day.
This was sent off for culture and was negative.
His chest tubes were removed on [**3-14**], and [**3-15**].
He was gradually weaned from CVVHD and intermittent hemodialysis was initiated although he experienced some drops in his blood pressure.
During this time, he was maintained on his regularly scheduled prednisone dose.
Gengraf was held as well as Rapamune in the immediate postoperative period to prevent over immunosuppression.
and Rapamune was eventually resumed at 1 mg per day.
He was eventually weaned from the ventilator and was stable on nasal cannula O2.
He was eventually transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit where he was then sent down to the medical surgical unit where he had a prolonged stay for postoperative pancreatitis.
During this time, the patient was NPO and was maintained on IV TPN.
He was switched to postpyloric feeding tube and enteral feedings were started.
Multiple stools were sent off for culture and C. Diff.
His liver enzymes continued to remain elevated with an AST of 268, ALT of 112, alkaline phosphatase of 788, total bilirubin of 0.7, albumin of 2.2, his amylase and lipase trended down.
Vancomycin had been stopped previously given finalization of cultures which revealed pseudomonas pansensitive.
Vancomycin was also stopped at the time the patient was found to be VRE positive by rectal swab.
Abdominal CT on [**2196-3-22**], demonstrated no evidence of pancreatitis, multiple low attenuation lesions of the liver, many of which represented cysts, but could not exclude abscesses without IV contrast.
New air pockets were noted with surrounding soft tissue density anterior to the bladder.
Also during this hospital course, he had a renal transplant duplex that demonstrated patent renal vasculature with no hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection.
Hemodialysis was stopped.
He was treated with IV torsemide with mild response.
His left arm appeared edematous and it was noted that he had a left IJ central line in place.
He remained in hospital pending a rehabilitation bed for enteral nutrition.
Physical therapy followed the patient and felt the patient would benefit from continuation of physical therapy to increase endurance and strength.
Abdomen was soft, positive bowel sounds, abdominal incision had a small open area with a 2 x 2 normal saline dressing that was changed daily and that wound was healing.
Old J-P site was clean and dry as well as the old chest tube sites were well healed.
The plan is to send the patient to rehabilitation for continuation of postpyloric feeding tube feedings using Peptamen full strength with banana flakes being cycled from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. with a goal rate of 100 cc per hour.
The patient was maintained on IV heparin until Coumadin reached a therapeutic goal range of between 2 and 3.
Heparin was stopped.
