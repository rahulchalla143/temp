WE think that these episodes are because of your atrial fibrillation and have continued the amiodarone to help with heart rate and rhythm control.
We considered a cardioversion but have not because your INR is low.
You also have been treated with antibiotics for a bowel infection that has caused a lot of diarrhea.
Stop taking the Milk of Magnesia and dulcolax suppositories 2.
Start taking a multivitamin 3.
Start Nystatin powder or cream to treat the rash in your groin area 4.
Start amiodarone to control your heart rhythm and rate 6.
Increase lasix to 40 mg daily Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.
