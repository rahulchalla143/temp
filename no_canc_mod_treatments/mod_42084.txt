Admission Date:  [**2148-6-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-6-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2079-9-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Egg White / gluten / Amitriptyline / Corn Oil / lactose / fluconazole / Garlic Oil / Levofloxacin / latex / guava flavor / Sulfa(Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Poison Sumac Extract / soy  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**] Chief Complaint: transferred for bright red blood per rectum  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none.
History of Present Illness: 68 y/o F with history of colonic polyps s/p multiple colonoscopies (last in [**2147-9-26**] showing diverticula and internal hemorrhoids) was admitted to [**Hospital **] on [**2148-5-30**], Thursday, after she experienced lower abdominal cramping and an episode of BRBPR mixed with stool.
Hct on admission to OSH was 39 and dropped to 27 with hydration and also continued BRBPR.
Recent history of bleed led to brief ICU stay for monitoring while heparin started for DVT (see below).
Hct was stable despite initiation of heparin drip.
Discussion was had with patient about whether or not to start anticoagulation given the fact that the DVT was all distal to the knee and she had the recent history of bleeding.
Given the need for anticoagulation in the setting of recent GI bleed, it was decided that the patient be transferred to the MICU for treatment of DVT with heparin drip for close observation in the event of possible repeat bleeding, however, the GI team (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3315**] felt that the chance of repeat bleeding was very low.
Was stable overnight on heparin drip and transferred to the floor the next day with plan to start warfarin.
While on the [**Hospital1 **], the patient was continued on warfarin and heparin drip.
The heparin drip was later stopped and the patient was discharged on lovenox bridge until coumadin is therapeutic with INR ranging from [**2-23**].
She was discharged on warfarin and lovenox.
# HTN:  The patient's home metoprolol was initially held given concern for masking physiologic tachycardia in the seting of acute bleeding.
# Chronic LBP: The patient's home exalgo was converted to its morphine equivalent and she was continued on 30 mg MS contin daily while in house.
# menopausal symptoms:  The patient was taking hormone replacement therapy (Prempro) for symptomatic hot flashes.
Transitional Issues: - The patient will have to continue Coumadin for at least three months for RLE DVT.
She will need repeat ultrasound in the three months to assess for resolution of clot, at which time if resolution if proven, consideration can be given to cessation of anticoagulation, this decision will need to be made by her primary care physician.
- The patient was discharged on lovenox which will have to be continued until INR is therapeutic, ranging from [**2-23**].
