Admission Date:  [**2185-4-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-5-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-1-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents / Augmentin / Lisinopril / Metoprolol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9002**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension, hypoxia.
She denies any confusion, LOC, vision changes, CP, palpitations, cough, recent URI symptoms, orthopnea, N/V, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, blood in the stool, melena.
She is on 3L NC at home.
Yesterday she had a new HD catheter placed in the LIJ; the RIJ was pulled.
Pt received kayexlate, insulin, and bicarb for hyperkalemia.
Pt was placed on levophed at 31.5.
Past Medical History: -Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) -Hypertension (HTN) -End-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis -sarcoidosis -epilepsy -chronic pancreatitis -secondary hyperparathyroidism -hyperlipidemia (HL) -anemia -angioectasias of the stomach and colon.
Hemodialysis catheter is seen terminating within the right atrium.
Stable prominence of the cardiac silhouette with dual-lumen catheter in place.
Long tubular filling defect noted extending from distal right subclavian vein, through right brachiocephalic vein, into the superior vena cava is compatible with thrombus, probably related to prior hemodialysis catheter placed on right side.
Hypotension: The patient initially required Levophed to maintain SBP 95-105, however did not become symptomatic aside from some lightheadedness prior to admission.
The pt had mild tenderness at both line sites (right HD line had been removed on [**2185-4-27**] and re-sited to left) but denied any significant drainage.
The patient spiked a fever to 102.9 and received blood cultures from peripheral vein and CVC.
She was weaned from pressors and restarted on home Sildenafil.
She was started on antibiotics to cover health-care associated infections with Vanc and Zosyn.
The pt completed a 10 day course of vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for presumed line infection (from the dialysis catheter that had been removed on [**2185-4-27**]).
The pt had a CT-A which did not show PE, but did reveal a long tubular filling defect noted extending from distal right subclavian vein, through right brachiocephalic vein, into the superior vena cava which was compatible with thrombus, probably related to prior hemodialysis catheter placed on right side.
The pt was then started on argatroban (given history of HIT) and coumadin.
The pt was discharged on coumadin with plans to have her INR followed through the [**Company 191**] coumadin clinic.
Hyperkalemia: The patient received insulin, bicarb, and kayexylate.
Her ECG did not show any significant changes, and her potassium corrected with dialysis the following day.
When the pt was noted to have persistent hypoxia, a pulmonary consult was requested and the pt's outpatient pulmonologist recommended that Sildenafil be stopped as it did not seem to be helping the pt.
