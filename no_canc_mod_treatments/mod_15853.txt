Due to non reassuring fetal heart rate pattern, the decision was made to deliver infant by repeat cesarean section.
Mother received one dose of Betamethasone during assessment in triage.
Blow-by oxygen was given, which progressed to C-Pap and elective intubation due to progressive respiratory distress.
Infant was shown to mother and then transported to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further management.
He received a total of two doses of Surfactant for respiratory surfactant deficiency.
He remained intubated for 24 hours, at which time he was extubated to nasal prong C-pap.
He required C-pap for a total of 48 hours and was transitioned to nasal cannula and went to room air by day of life nine.
He remained in room air for approximately two weeks, at which time he was demonstrated to have nasal cannula oxygen requirements.
He remained on nasal cannula oxygen until [**2105-1-29**].
[**Known lastname 7568**] was started on diuretics on [**2105-1-19**] for management of persistent oxygen requirement and chronic lung disease.
[**Known lastname 7568**] was treated with caffeine citrate for management of apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.
The caffeine was discontinued on [**2104-1-3**].
He initially required a D-10 bolus for management of hypoglycemia which resolved quickly.
He started enteral feedings on day of life two.
He achieved full enteral feedings by day of life 16.
Maximum enteral intake was 150 cc per kg per day of breast milk 30 calorie with Promod added.
He is currently ad lib feeding breast milk or Enfamil 20 calorie, taking an adequate amount.
[**Known lastname 7568**] is currently receiving potassium supplement of 3 meq of potassium chloride every 12 hours (In conjunction with his diuril).
He received phototherapy for a total of seven days.
He has not required any blood transfusions during this hospital course.
He is currently receiving Ferinsol supplementation of 3 mg/kg per day.
On day of life six, the infant was started on Vancomycin and Gentamycin for increasing concerns of sepsis secondary to a shifted CBC.
Antibiotics were discontinued at that time.
He has not required any further antibiotics during his hospital course and has been stable.
CARE RECOMMENDATIONS: Feeds:  Continue ad lib feeding, breast milk 20 or Enfamil 20 calorie.
Consider 24 calorie/ounce supplementation if weight gain insufficient.
Continue Ferinsol supplementation, at 0.2 cc po qday = ~2 mg/kg per day.
This in combination with Enfamil will provide ~4 mg/kg/day of elemental Fe.
Diuril 40 mg/kg per day which equals 50 mg PO BID.
Periodically electrolytes should be monitored while on Diuril and KCL.
IMMUNIZATIONS RECEIVED:  He received hepatitis B vaccine on [**2105-1-13**].
DTAP, HIB, IPV, Pneumococcal and Synagis on [**2105-1-31**].
IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED:  Synagis-RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet any of the following three criteria: 1.)
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the Fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
