The patient was taken to the Emergency Department where he was noted to be diaphoretic, tachypneic and tachycardic with a heart rate of 105, a respiratory rate of 28 and a temperature of 101.5 degrees.
The patient received 10 mg of Valium and was given a nonrebreather mask which he did not tolerate.
The patient received a total of 14 mg of Ativan and 40 mg of Valium plus 5 mg of droperidol and 20 mg of labetalol in the Emergency Room.
The patient also received four liters of normal saline with a urine output of 100 cc.
The patient was brought to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he continued to be tachypneic and tachycardic and received 80 mg IV of Valium which had no effect.
He was therefore put on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation at a pressure support of 20 and a PEEP of 8.
The patient continued to require Valium 10 mg every 20 minutes in order to maintain adequate anxiolytic effect.
The patient was sedated with dexmedetomidine per Anesthesia recommendation and intubated in the Intensive Care Unit.
Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.
Xanax 0.25 mg p.r.n.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes hives.
In general, the patient was obese, now sedated on Ativan and Valium, with an erythematous face, very diaphoretic.
The patient received 260 mg of Valium in his first six hours in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and was, therefore, intubated and sedated with an Ativan infusion dexmedetomidine.
Initially the patient did well, however, he became very agitated on the 9th requiring 280 mg of Valium in six hours and 420 mg of Valium in 12 hours plus 55 mg of Ativan.
At this time Pharmacy was consulted and it was decided to discontinue the dexmedetomidine and start propofol for proper sedation.
In addition, the Ativan drip was changed to a Versed drip to avoid renal toxicity that is associated with Ativan.
Toxicology consult was obtained which recommended using phenobarbital as a long acting [**Doctor Last Name 360**] with Valium as needed and propofol as needed while the patient was still febrile.
The patient was still requiring Valium 60 mg IV q.
In addition, a labetalol drip was started on [**7-13**] as it was determined that the patient's labile blood pressure was due partly to withdrawal symptoms and partly to underlying hypertension.
On [**7-15**] the propofol was able to be weaned and the patient remained on phenobarbital and Valium.
The patient was started on ciprofloxacin and gentamicin on the 9th but, the patient continues to remain febrile on this drug regimen, therefore an abdominal ultrasound was obtained to rule out biliary obstruction.
A CT of the abdomen showed a fluid collection in the right lower quadrant measuring 3 cm x 2.8 cm inferior to the cecum in addition to a possible second fluid collection of 1 cm adjacent to the terminal ileum, an 8 mm tubular structure that could represent an inflamed appendix was noted on reconstructed images.
Surgery was consulted and recommended antibiotic treatment with Flagyl, gentamicin, levofloxacin and one dose of vancomycin which the patient received on [**7-12**].
At this time the blood cultures came back positive for Clostridium non perfringens, non septicum in one bottle and bacterial species in the other bottle.
The patient was intubated for progressive hypoxia for airway protection given his high benzodiazepine requirement.
The patient was initially given Lasix for some findings of EHF on chest x-ray.
The patient was switched to pressure control ventilation on [**7-14**] as he was noted to have some asynchronous breathing with the vent.
Thereafter, the patient maintained good ventilation and oxygenation on the ventilator.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  The patient was started on tube feeds on [**7-12**] with thiamine, folate, insulin, heparin and ranitidine in the tube feeds.
The patient was kept NPO due to his appendicitis.
The patient was initially treated with Valium as it was thought that the hypertension was secondary to withdrawal but then the patient was switched over to a labetalol drip for blood pressure control as it was thought that his hypertension was more long-standing in origin.
On [**7-15**], the patient was switched to a clonidine patch and labetalol was weaned.
The patient's acid based abnormalities on admission resolved quite quickly when he was started on ventilatory support.
