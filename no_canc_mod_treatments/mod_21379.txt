He then came to [**Location (un) 86**] on [**8-13**] to visit family and finished 2 weeks of levaquin on [**8-20**] with partial resolution of symptoms.
A chest tube was placed on [**9-5**] due to spontaneous penumothorax.
He continued to deteriorate and spike fever while on broad antibiotic coverage.
They started ambisome 250 qd since [**8-31**] for coccidioides coverage.
He had been on voriconazole from [**9-6**] to [**9-11**] for double coverage of coccidioides given clinical deterioration.
He continued to spike while on broad antibiotic coverage.
Mr. [**Known lastname 57508**] was on itraconazole from [**9-11**] to [**9-16**] but it was discontinued given persistent cholestasis and new drug rashes since [**9-15**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 57508**] was transferred here for possible surgical resection of his necrotic lung.
Past Medical History: -Inflammatory Myositis s/p biopsy [**6-3**] started on methotrexate and prednisone, unclear as to etiology (not inclusion body myositis)  Diagnosed at [**Hospital3 2568**]... -coccidomycosis pneumonia -right sided pneumothorax s/p CT -rectal bleeing [**1-31**] hemorrhoids -ARf -hyponatremia -thrombocytopenia -anasarca -cholestatic hepatitis  Social History: retired mechanic married no tobacco occassional etoh born in [**Location (un) 57512**] [**Country **], emigrated here in [**2119**]  Family History: not obtained  Physical Exam: 98.4, 94/50, 92, 24, 94%5L Gen illapearing jaundiced anasarcic male in nad HEENT icteric, EOMI, PERRLA, dry MM with small ulcer on R tongue Neck supple, no lad, jvp not elevated PULM: R lung with coarse rales and wet throughout, L lung with good air movement CVS rrr nl s1 and s2, no rubs, murmers, gallops Abd soft mildly distended, hypoactive BS, HSM not appreciated Ext 4+ pitting edema, 2+ pulses all extremeties Neuro CN intact, AAOx2, cerebellum intact Skin: Bilateral petechial rashes on LEs  Pertinent Results: MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The study is limited by patient motion.
Allowing for this, there is grossly normal signal demonstrated in both anterior cerebral, both middle cerebral, both intracranial internal carotid, anterior communicating artery, both posterior cerebral arteries, basilar artery, and both intracranial vertebral arteries.
ID: At outside hospital culture data revealed Coccidomycoses in both blood and sputum, enterobacter on [**8-30**] bronchoscopy and GPCs on [**9-16**] bronchoscopy.
Here on admission, the patient was placed on zosyn and vancomycin for anaerobic and GPC coverage, ambisome 400 q24 and caspofungin for coccidioides coverage, all cultures re-sent including washes from bronchoscopy.
A lumbar puncture was performed to determine the need for intrathecal ambisome, however no organisms were seen on microscopy or cultured.
Linezolid was started for VRE, and subsequent survellience cultures were negative.
He was started on zosyn and vancomycin for bacterial superinfection.
The chest tube was replaced for apical suction, the ambisome was increased to 5 mg/kg and caspofungin was added for double coverage.
He was not considered a surgical candidate for lobectomy given his poor clinical condition and widely disseminated coccidiomycosis.
On [**9-22**] chest tube was placed to water seal, no reexpansion of ptx on positive pressure, and he was thought unlikely to have continued broncho-pleural fistula  3.
His LFTs improved during his course, but the patient remained anasarcic and jaundiced.
Triamcinolone ointment and emolllients provided relief.
He was bolused frequently and given PRBCs to keep intravascular oncotic pressure up and to reach goal MAP > 65.
His free water was limited and nutrition was consulted for TPN recommendations.
His primary care physician from [**Name9 (PRE) 4565**] sent records of a biopsy which indicated that myositis was not inclusion body.
He had been on Methotrexate and Prednisone 10 prior to admission.
Cardiac output was boosted with IVF boluses for BP and stress dose steriods, started [**9-19**].
