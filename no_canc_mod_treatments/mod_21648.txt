Pt was noted to be in urinary retention, foley was inserted with 1.5L drainage, foley left in.
[**Name (NI) **] with friends while in NY.
____________________________ MRI Lumbar Spine [**9-27**]: Vertebral body height, alignment, and signal intensity are normal.
A Foley tube and rectal tube are noted.
Patient was continued on Ceftriaxone for bacterial meningitis.
Infectious Disease was consulted who recommended repeating the LP to obtain further specimen for TB PCR and other exams; they also recommended starting patient on Acyclovir pending HSV results and antibiotic coverage for suspected TB meningitis in conjunction with steroids.
The patient was started on INH, pyrazinamide, pyridoxine, Rifampin, Ethambutol and Dexamethasone.
Given the patient's worsening mental status including increasing lethargy and new-onset photophobia without focal CNIII deficits, patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for further management.
He was kept on respiratory precautions and with negative pressure isolation.
Initially, the patient was maintained on bacterial coverage with Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin which was added to cover resistant pneumococcus.
He was continued on treatment for TB meningitis with steroids.
Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin were discontinued once CSF cultures from the OSH came back negative.
Acyclovir was later discontinued as CSF HSV 1 and 2 came back negative.
Repeat LP was performed as per ID recommendations which again showed a lymphocytic predominance with decreasing levels of protein and increasing glucose.
Pt continued to have periods of severe headache, back pain and leg pain throughout his admission, treated with acetaminophen, oxycodone and IV morphine as needed.
DDx for the fevers included atelectasis and incentive spirometer was placed at patient's bedside.
There was at no time any saddle anesthesia or incontinence although the patient did have one episode of severe diarrhea as a result of aggressive bowel regimen for constipation.
Neurology was consulted who suggested continued treatment of the underlying infection and continued steroids.
On [**9-28**] the patient again began to complain of abdominal pain, diffuse in nature, constant and sharp in nature, rated [**9-8**].
The patient was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen including PR lactulose which caused the patient to have a large quantity of loose stool.
Repeat CT abdomen/pelvis however showed a normal filling appendix, appendicitis was ruled out and surgery team signed off.
Urinary retention- At OSH, pt was found to have urinary retention, requiring a foley.
Voiding trial was attempted once more, but the patient began to experience severe abdominal pain several hours after the foley was removed.
The patient responded appropriately to several fluid boluses of NS which caused his HR to come down to the 60s.
Baseline fluids were maintained with intermitted NS boluses as needed.
The patient continued to match his urine input and output and was able to tolerate aggressive fluids without any problems.
In addition, he was treated with Ativan for anxiety, Percocet and Morphine for pain which also seemed to slow his heart rate.
The patient was treated with NS at 150 cc/hr with one day of salt tablets with normalization of his sodium.
As mentioned above, serum sodium levels decreased to a low of 129 but increased to normal limits with normal saline and salt tabs.
