However, it was also thought that there could have been an effect of his high keppra dose and anticholinergic drugs.
His Keppra was decreased to an appropriate renal dose and all of his medications with anticholinergic side effects were stopped.
He was initially given Haldol at night to control his evening agitation but it was later weaned off.
He was not requiring a 1:1 sitter at the time of discharge and was believed to be back close to his baseline level of dementia.
# PLEURAL EFFUSION - His first thoracentesis removed 1.5 L but the pleural fluid removed was not sent for diagnostic testing.
At the time of discharge, the denied shortness of breath, had no other evidence on exam to suggest CHF besides pleural effusions, and had good O2 saturations on minimal O2 requirements.
# PERINEPHRIC HEMATOMA - He had embolization of one of the branches of his right renal artery by Interventional Radiology.
His anticoagulation with warfarin was held.
# hypertension- patient was hypertensive to the 190s on the floor on beta blocker and long acting nitrate.
Given his renal insufficiency and likelihood of requiring large doses of ACE inhibitor to obtain appropriate blood pressure control, he was started on po hydralazine with excellent improvement in pressures.
However, given QID dosing, patient may benefit from switch to calcium channel blocker as an outpatient.
# CVA - he was on warfarin and aspirin prior to his perinephric hematoma for stroke.
Given his risk of falls and hematoma, only his aspirin was continued and his warfarin was held.
# BPH - He was continued on his finesteride and flomax.
# ELEVATED TROPONIN - His troponin peaked at 0.22 with no elevations in CK or CK/MB, and he had no chest pain.
His CAD was treated conservatively with medical management including asa, metoprolol and isosorbide.
# DM - His oral hypoglycemics were held during admission and he was managed with an insulin sliding scale.
He was not restarted on his glipizide given his renal failure but was started on low dose avandia at the time of discharge.
His PO meds needed to be crushed in puree.
Liquid forms were requried if medications were not crushable.
He was put on aspiration precautions, and all his meals needed to be supervised.
