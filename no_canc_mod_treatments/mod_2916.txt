He was on dialysis for approximately 7 months with a right IJ PermCath.
His hypertension and diabetes has been complicated by nephropathy, and coronary artery disease, for which he underwent cardiac bypass in [**2123-6-11**].
He underwent percutaneous intervention in the spring of [**2124**] and was recently diagnosed with atrial flutter prior to his scheduled transplant in [**2125-4-10**].
The kidney transplant was subsequently postponed after he underwent ablation of the arrhythmia site and required anticoagulation postoperatively.
Following these pre-operative tests, a decision was made to proceed with surgery and he was admitted on [**2125-7-17**] to undergo kidney transplant.

Family History: Father died at 79 of an MI, had bypass at age 70 Mother died at age 82 of CHF and DM Brother had stents placed at age 58  Physical Exam: Blood pressure was 171/100 mm Hg while seated.
Pulse was 67 (paced) beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was (vent SIMV 600 x 12 or 15/5).
He was transferred to the ICU; however, concern arose when, 2 hours after propofol was turned off, he still was not responsive to sternal rub.
Due to these findings, he underwent right heart catheterization performed by entry into a preexistent left internal jugular vein cordis, using a thermodilution Swan-Ganz catheter, and advanced to the PCW position.
TEE post resuscitation revealed worse LV function than preop (Preop LVEF 40; TEE today reportedly LVEF 20), and starting heparin gtt and aspirin.
Neurology recommendations included: CTA of head and neck (MRI possible due to AICD), IV thiamine 100 mg daily, avoiding sedating medications, maintaining normothermia, continuing normoglycemia with insulin drip, allowing BP to autoregulate until thrombosis and infarct excluded, and continuing IV heparin until thrombosis excluded.
The patient initially was placed on nitroprusside drip and hydralazine to control elevated blood pressures.
