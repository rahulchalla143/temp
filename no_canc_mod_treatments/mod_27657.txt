The patient was transferred to the ICU so that pressors could be hung as we were concerned that her low blood pressure might put her at further risk for ischemic injury in the setting of her recent stroke.
The patient was placed on Neo-Synephrine to maintain systolic blood pressure over 120.
She was also started on a diltiazem drip to facilitate rate control, but this was felt not to be ideal as the blood pressure effects of the diltiazem was counteracting the effects of the Neo-Synephrine.
Therefore the patient was started on an amiodarone gtt for rate control and the diltiazem was stopped.
The patient still required the neo gtt to maintain adequate pressures.
She was eventually transition to PO amiodarone.
On the morning of [**2154-11-8**] the patient began to withdraw, showing the first signs of delirium tremens - she was agitated, disoriented, and combative.
The patient was initially started on a CIWA scale but was requiring large doses.
She was started on a lorazepam gtt.
The patient was felt to be at risk of not protecting her airway and shortly after being started on the Ativan gtt she was intubated.
She was briefly on a propofol gtt and receiving regular ativan as the SICU team felt that she was at high risk for withdrawal related MI or seizures and as she was also very combative.
Simvastatin 40mg daily was started.
Given the likelihood that the patient's stroke was cause by her atrial fibrillation the patient was started on a heparin gtt and Coumadin was given as well.
The patient was started on Ciprofloxacin on [**2154-11-10**] and completed a 3 day course.
The patient was maintained on an insulin sliding scale.
The patient was given famotidine and tube feeds were initiated while she was intubated.
After a prolonged intubation, she was gradually weaned off sedation.
A J-G tube was therefore placed surgically as IR was unsuccessful.
During this time she was off Coumadin, reversed with FFP and on a heparin drip.
