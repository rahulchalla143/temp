A swan was placed which demonstrated lower than expected cardiac output and cardiac index.
She was diuresed aggressively with improvement in her CXR findings and exam but she remained intubated for several days.
She was empirically anticoagulated with heparin although a CTA was not obtained given her high travel risk.
Ultimately, since her respiratory status improved with diuresis and antibiotics, PE was considered lower on the differential.
Pt was weaned off the ventilator and extubated on [**6-7**], after which she continued to do well.
During her admission Plavix was held due to coffee ground in NG fluid during time of heparin gtt, but this was restarted on day of discharge.
Placement was delayed given infectious concerns.
We then decided to change her sotolol to metoprolol and continue a strategy of rate control and anticoagulation.
#ID: Pt was initially started on broad abx to cover for aspiration pneumonia given the respiratory failure, low grade fever on presentation and suggestion of mixed septic physiology by Swan numbers.
She completed a 10 day course of aztreonam, azithromycin, and vancomycin on [**6-10**].
We treated with broad antibiotiocs and diuresis, initially on dobutamine alternating with dopamine.
Additionally also on empiric stress dose steroids which were stopped after several days.
When her pacermaker generator was replaced, she was better able to maintain her blood pressure and her pressors were weaned on [**2166-6-7**].
She was initially started on lovenox injections 150mg [**Hospital1 **].
Serial exams were performed and the patient appeared to gradually recover some function of her speech (pt can hold simple conversations) and her right extremities.
Speech and swallow evaluation cleared the patient for po puree.
Pt was started on coumadin on [**6-10**] at 5mg once she was able to tolerate PO.
Plan to continue lovenox injections to bridge to therapeutic INR [**1-18**].
# DM: glargine and ISS were used to maintain BS 100-200.
