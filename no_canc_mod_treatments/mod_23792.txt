He was empirically treated with Vancomycin, Zosyn for 2 days (one dose of aztreonam in the ED) for presumed HCAP, despite lack of fevers, cough.
At time of discharge, his tramadol and sertraline were restarted, but his trazodone and amitryptiline were not restarted.
Because the patient did not have fevers, cough, and his leukocytosis was transient, also because he remained very hemodynamically stable and well-appearing, he was not continued on IV antibiotics as it was felt to be unlikely that the patient had MRSA or pseudomonas pneumonia given his clinical appearance, and he was thus discharged on PO levofloxacin and flagyl, the latter to cover anaerobes, especially as there may have been an aspiration component to his presentation.
