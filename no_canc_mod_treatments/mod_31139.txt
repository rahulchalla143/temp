5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
CT LE IMPRESSION: 1) Status post debridement in the medial malleolar region, with a VAC dressing in place, contacting the distal tibia.
Brief Hospital Course: Ankle and Lumbar Spine Osteomyelitis The patient initially presented with what was thought to be a left ankle cellulitis and was started on unasyn with vancomycin given risk for MRSA.
When the sensitivities grew out MSSA, antibiotics were changed to oxacillin.
He had hardware in place from a prior injury of his left ankle.
Orthopaedic service consulted and proceeded with a left ankle I&D with removal of hardware on [**12-4**]; wound cultures grew out MSSA.
The wound was kept open with temporary VAC dressing and plastics followed the patient during hospitalization; he will follow up after discharge for VAC removal and flap coverage.
The patient was also thought to have osteomyelitis of L1 based on MRI and underwent debridement and spinal fusion of T12 to L2 on [**1-9**]; vertebral tissue sent from the OR was consistent with infection.
He was treated with oxacillin and rifampin added per ID recommendations for osteomyelitis in his ankle as well as his spine.
These antibiotics should continue until his appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11382**] in [**Month (only) 958**].
CV Pt with h/o hypertension and had been on univasc at last visit.
Initially the patient remained on moexipril and labetolol with good control.
During his hospitalization, he was transitioned to metoprolol and continued on this until discharge.
Given this, he was started on imodium prn for symptoms.
His foley was removed and he was started on ciprofloxacin for a 5 day course (ID felt this could be colonization); on discharge further speciation and sensitivities were pending.
Because of his history of transfusion reactions, he was not transfused but rather was started on tid iron supplementation.
Further along during his hospitalization, he was also placed on nystatin and miconazole treatments.
Psychiatry The patient had a h/o depression treated with home regimen of Paxil 30mg po qd.
After his third surgery he was restarted on paxil at10mg daily and this can be titrated up.
NIDDM On admission, he stated that he was taking glyburide 7.5mg po qAM and 5mg po qPM.
He was initially continued on this regimen with an additional RISS, but during his course was NPO and was then kept only on the sliding scale with a goal of tight glycemic control.
FEN After his first spinal surgery, the patient was kept NPO except meds with water as he was unable to sit upright.
He was briefly given TPN via his PICC line until his second spinal surgery.
Proph The patient was maintained on a PPI; DVT prophylaxis; bowel regimen; and the pain service followed him to ensure appropriate pain control.
His pain meds were tapered off after his final surgery.
On discharge he was on prn tylenol and prn [**Hospital1 **] (but was not requiring it).
Access The patient had a CVL and arterial line while in the ICU; he then had a PICC inserted for long term IV antibiotics and was discharge to rehab with this in place.
