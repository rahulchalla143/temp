The patient was started on both beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.
The patient was treated with one unit of packed red blood cells, two units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit of cryo precipitate.
Following treatment with fresh frozen plasma and cryo precipitate, the patient's INR had decreased to 1.6.
The patient's hematocrit had dropped as low as 27.9 but after receiving an additional one unit of packed red blood cells, returned to the normal range and stayed within normal limits during the course of his hospitalization.
