He is currently medically stable on chronic hemodialysis.
He was intubated in setting of airway protection and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and empirically started on n-acetylcysteine (NAC)as well as vancomycin/ceftriaxone due to fever and leukocytosis to 35 with bandemia.
Per the initial toxicology recs, patient most likely experienced serotonin syndrome as a result of his ingestion (Coricidin contains dextromethorphan, chlorpheniramine, +/- acetaminophen).
The patient's urine tox screen was also positive for cocaine and opiates, but his serum tox screen was negative for acetaminophen.
Patient's LFTs continued to worsen in the setting of patient's significant rhabdomyolysis despite aggressive fluid hydration.
His rhabdomyolysis resolved with CK and LFTs trending downward.
He received aggressive LR fluid hydration in the setting of hyperchloremia and hypernatremia.
He was repleted with bicarb and 1 liter NS.
#TRANSAMINITIS: The patient had a transaminitis on admission initially concerning for ischemia or tylenol use and was started on NAC treatment, though these were rapidly elminated from the differential.
Renal recommended a trial of Lasix 150 mg to help diuresis him, given his volume overload and anuria but he was not responsive.
A temporary dialysis catheter was placed by IR on [**5-13**] and the patient was started on dialysis with rapid correction in his acidosis and overall clinical status.
As he tolerated dialysis well without recover of his urine output, ranging from 100 - 400 cc daily, he was transitioned to a tunneled HD catheter for chronic administration of hemodialysis.
He did well on a MWF dialysis schedule and discharged with a plan to continue on this schedule for longterm.
SEDATION: The patient was initially sedated with propofol following admission to the MICU to avoid to avoid worsening his rhabdomyolysis.
However, the patient was weaned off his propofol and self-extubated the day following admission.
#PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM: The patient was evaluated by both Thoracic Surgery and ENT for his pneumomediastinum.
Thoracic surgery performed bronchoscopy and endoscopy and noted no tear from the carina all the way up to the cricoid.
The patient was started on an empirical 7 day course of Unasyn and followed with serial physical exams.
Patient was treated with Unasyn for 7 day course as prophylaxis for mediastinitis.
He was started on hydroxazine 25 mg Q6H PRN for anxiety.
Renal has been performing ultra filtration in an effort to decrease intravascular volume and started on labetalol 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for further control.
His nausea and headache resolved with further dialysis treatments.
At this juncture, he will continue on labetalol for renovascular hypertension.
The patient resumed dialysis on [**2193-5-20**] per his usual schedule with improvement in his symptoms.
It was also thought around [**2193-5-18**] that the patient could have developed pancreatitis given elevated lipase in setting of Carbamazepine re-initiation.
His home Carbamazepine was subsequently held.
This medication should be avoided in the future.
His abdominal symptoms and nausea resolved with conservative measurements.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - He will need to establish with a primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 111891**]n with repeat LFTs and CK on outpatient basis to trend to normalization as psychiatric discharge -MWF dilaysis -monitor urine output -full code - Contact: Father Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 111892**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 111893**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 111894**].
Medications on Admission: Zyprexa 5mg daily Tegretol 200mg [**Hospital1 **] (pt states both meds are from prescriptions he received after his hospitaliztion)   Discharge Medications: 1.
Calcium Carbonate 500 mg PO QID:PRN heartburn/indigestion 2.
Docusate Sodium (Liquid) 100 mg PO BID 3.
HydrOXYzine 25 mg PO Q6H:PRN anxiety hold for sedation, RR<10 4.
OLANZapine 5 mg PO HS 5.
Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q24H 6.
Labetalol 300 mg PO BID   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - acute oliguric renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis - mood disorder NOS with suicide attempt - rhabdomyolysis - pancreatitis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We also think that you developed briefly pancreatitis from your home medication (tegretol), which you should not take any more.
You will need to remain on dialysis as your kidneys are still failing.
