Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 19444**] is a 91-year old woman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation off coumadin secondary to remote GI bleeds who presents with acute onset of left sided weakness and slurred speech with some evidence of left hand shaking but only after onset of deficits.
A 1 mg ativan dose was given as trial to stop seizure without effect.
After extensive discussion with regarding the potential risks and benefits of TPA in this case with particular consideration to history of GI bleeds, old age, possibility, and possibility of a seizure contributing to weakness/somnolence, and her desire not to live if she were to have any additional deficits, the decision was made to proceed with TPA.
She was given a prednisone taper for acute gout flare.
