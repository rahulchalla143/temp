HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82-year-old male with a past medical history significant for benign prostatic hypertrophy (status post transurethral resection of the prostate in [**2092**]), gout, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency ?, hypothyroidism and thrombocytopenia, status post cerebrovascular accident, and anemia requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells.
In addition, during that hospitalization, the was noted to have a systolic blood pressure in the 85-110 range and all of his antihypertension medications were discontinued.
The patient was then placed on Aggrenox.
He did complain of dizziness when he changed positions from supine to standing or supine to sitting, but he denied any loss of consciousness and denied any confusion.
He was given aggressive intravenous fluids, and his orthostatic hypotension responded to three liters of intravenous fluids.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy status post transurethral resection of the prostate in [**2092**].
Levothyroxine 25 mcg p.o.
Tylenol p.r.n.
Aggrenox one tablet p.o.
Allopurinol 100 mg p.o.
Vitamin C 500 mg p.o.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood cells was 12.6, hematocrit 27.4, platelet count 211, MCV 95, sodium 141, potassium 5.7 (slightly hemolyzed), chloride 109, bicarbonate 25, BUN 49, creatinine 1.1, glucose 106, PT 14.2, PTT 31.5, INR 1.3.
8 hours while in the medical intensive care unit, and his hematocrit was stable after transfusion of another unit of packed red cells (for a total of six units) in the medical intensive care unit.
The question of an emergent/urgent endoscopy was approached again with GI and since the patient was hemodynamically stable, and his nasogastric lavage was negative, in the setting of a new large pneumothorax, and without obvious life-threatening active hemorrhage, GI deferred on endoscopy until the patient was more medically stable.
Throughout the patient's admission he had a rectal tube in place, and large amounts of melena were produced every day.
On [**2116-3-11**], one day after the chest tube was pulled, GI did an esophagogastroduodenoscopy to evaluate for the cause of upper GI bleed.
During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, he had two large-bore peripheral IVs at all times.
He was on IV Protonix (PPI) 40 mg IV q.
As an outpatient, the patient should continue the Protonix, but will be changed to a p.o.
Pulmonary:  The [**Hospital 228**] medical intensive care unit course was complicated by an iatrogenic pneumothorax, which was caused status post numerous left subclavian central line placement attempts.
The patient's pneumothorax was moderate to large sized and cardiothoracic surgery was called to place a chest tube.
A chest tube was placed on [**2116-3-6**] without event.
The patient was comfortable on room air and did not require any supplemental oxygen at that point in time.
The patient had a type and screen sent every three days, and always had three units of packed red cells ready/reserved for this patient.
The patient was transfused a total of......units of packed red cells in the medical intensive care unit, and did not require any more transfusions while on the floor.
This was likely secondary to an expansion acidosis, given his aggressive IV fluid hydration with normal saline.
When the patient was transferred to the floor, the patient's intravenous fluids were changed from normal saline to lactated Ringer solution (which has bicarbonate in it), and his intravenous fluids were continued at 125 cc an hour.
Bilateral leg ulcers/chronic venous stasis:  The patient's home regimen was continued with Bactroban ointment, and normal saline wet-to-dry dressing changes on his ulcers q. day.
Prophylaxis:  The patient was given subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was given fluid resuscitation with normal saline at 150 cc/hour in the medical intensive care unit, which was changed to lactated Ringer solution at 125 cc/hour on the floor.
The patient did not show any signs of pulmonary edema or elevated jugular venous distension throughout his aggressive intravenous fluids hydration.
Urine output was good and there were no problems with the discontinuation of his Foley catheter.
The patient had a transurethral resection of the prostate in [**2092**].
The patient continued to have melena, have his hematocrit was stable and it is likely that his melena will continue for a while.
Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on levothyroxine 24 mg p.o.
Pneumothorax, status post chest tube placement and removal.
Intravenous fluid expansion acidosis.
Numerous antibodies and his blood, difficult crossmatch.
The patient should continue to use a proton pump inhibitor.
Patient is absolutely not to use any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, or Aggrenox.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Levothyroxine 25 mcg p.o.
Heparin 5,000 units subcutaneous q.
Vitamin C 500 mg p.o.
Allopurinol 100 mg p.o.
Bactroban ointment (mupirocin cream 2%), one application b.i.d.
to skin ulcers.
Tylenol 325-650 mg p.o.
Miconazole powder 2% one application b.i.d.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Absolutely no non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, or Aggrenox.
