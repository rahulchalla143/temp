Patient had been admitted for pneumonia and subsequently developed sepsis, respiratory failure and was briefly intubated and started on sepsis protocol.
Patient underwent thoracentesis with fluid showing transudative effusion in the ICU.
Initially started on amiodarone status post cortisone stim test status post hydrocortisone, coagulopathy secondary to malnutrition.
Heparin 5000 subQ t.i.d.
Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
Plavix 75 q.d.
Aspirin 325 q.d.
Vitamin K q.d.
Metoprolol 12.5 b.i.d.
Midodrine 5 q Monday, Wednesday, Friday pre-hemodialysis.
Levofloxacin 250 q.48h.
Florinef 0.1 t.i.d.
HEENT showed JVD to half way up the angle of the jaw and his right IJ [**Location (un) 18296**] catheter in place.
While on the floor, he was maintained on aspirin, Plavix, and a low dose beta blocker.
His volume overload was believed to be manifested in recurrent pleural effusions.
Patient underwent dialysis several days per week, and patient underwent several thoracenteses to remove recurrent effusions.
CHF team was consulted during his hospital course for further evaluation and they recommended low dose beta blocker to Toprol, low dose ACE inhibitor, and starting on digoxin.
He was maintained on midodrine pre-hemodialysis and also on Florinef for severe orthostatic hypotension.
As eluded to above, it was difficult titrating up his ACE inhibitor and beta blockade secondary to labile and orthostatic hypotension.
He was maintained on low dose beta blockade and ACE inhibitor.
Most recently on [**12-13**], the patient was started on low dose diltiazem for improved rate control.
He was maintained on aspirin at this point.
The issue of chemical cardioversion was not addressed at this point.
Bilateral pleural effusions:  Patient underwent re-thoracentesis of recurrent pleural effusions on both left and right side.
They were followed periodically with chest films, and appeared to be stable at the time of this dictation.
C. COPD:  Patient came in with COPD and being intubated initially for his pneumonia and respiratory failure.
He is currently in the process of awaiting a G-J tube that should hopefully improve his nutritional status.
Infectious disease:  Patient is status post two week course of Levaquin for pneumonia/sepsis.
However, it was challenging taking fluid off of him in the setting of his orthostasis.
Endocrinology:  Patient was maintained on NPH and sliding scale insulin for his diabetes.
He was also continued on midodrine for hypertension associated with hemodialysis and was continued on Florinef also for presumed orthostasis.
He will likely need rehabilitation given his severe cardiopulmonary disease, his diabetes, and autonomic dysfunction as well as his knee for dialysis.
Addendum will be added to this discharge summary as well medications at that time at patient's discharge.
