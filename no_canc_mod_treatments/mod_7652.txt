Choledocholithiasis and stable dilated CBD to 12 mm.
Femoral Line Placement and PTC [**2139-12-4**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Exchange of the left femoral temporary hemodialysis catheter with a new 14 French, 24 cm temporary hemodialysis catheter.
Placement of an 8 French internal-external biliary drainage catheter via a right posterior biliary duct with its retention pigtail loop in the duodenum.
A stent was seen extruding from the ampullary orifice - This corresponds to patient's known internal-external PTC drain.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Balloon sphincteroplasty was then performed with a wire-guided CRE balloon and the ampulla/distal CBD was successfully dilated to 15 mm.
Several balloon sweeps were then performed with successful extraction of two 8 mm stones.
Thus, a 5cm by 10FR dougle pigtail biliary stent was placed successfully.
Recommendations: NPO overnight with aggressive IV hydration with LR at 200 cc/hr.
If any abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding please call ERCP fellow on call ([**Pager number 8437**]) Further management of PTC drain as per IR.
Repeat ERCP in 1 month for stent removal and complete duct clearance.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo woman presenting from nursing facility with recent well-healing groin abcess, admitted with cholangitis, Klebsiella bacteremia, septic shock, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
#Cholangitis/Klebsiella bacteremia/Septic Shock/Choledocholithiasis: Patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit in septic shock requiring vasopressor support and found to have Klebsiella bacteremia.
Bedside ERCP was unsuccessful but a percutaneous biliary drain was placed and the patient improved with drainage and antibiotics and was able to be taken off vasopressors.
Once the patient was hemodynamically stable a repeat ERCP was performed which was notable for choledocholithiasis and a sphincterotomy with stone extraction was performed and a biliary stent was placed.
Patient completed a 2 week course of Meropenem prior to discharge.
Patient will return for stent removal in one month from discharge.
Following treatment of her infection she was maintained on [**1-18**] L oxygen by nasal canula.
Since Coumadin was held for the patient's ERCP, the patient required a heparin gtt bridge to Coumadin until INR was therapeutic at goal [**2-19**].
The cultures will be followed by outpatient Nephrology and antibiotics started as indicated.
Her pruritis improved with discontinuation of bleached sheets, sarna lotion, and a short course of topical clobetasol.
She also was placed on miconazole power for fungal groin rash.
#Hx of atrial tach: Amiodarone was continued.
#Diabetes mellitus type 2: continued home NPH and ISS  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient is having intermittent vaginal bleeding, she should be evaluated by GYN as an outpatient for possible endometrial biopsy - Patient's left tunneled line was noted to have mild possibly purulent discharge at dialysis on [**2139-12-29**].
