Most recent echo showed severe aortic stenosis and was already scheduled for elective valve replacement on [**7-7**].
In ED there was new onset atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, rate controlled on beta blockers.
Heparin initiated prior to surgery.
He was appropriately medically managed and underwent pre-op work-up and on [**7-7**] he was taken to the operating room where he underwent a redo-sternotomy, aortic valve replacement.
He required multiple inotropes and pressors post-operatively and remained intubated until post-op day three.
In addition, patient was in complete heart block (initially asystolic), continued to be V-paced post-op and was assessed for permanent pacemaker by EP.
Eventually all inotropes and pressors were weaned and he was suitable for transfer to telemetry floor on post-op day seven.
Coumadin and Heparin was started for his atrial fibrillation.
All tubes lines and drains were removed per cardiac surgery protocol.
Once on the stepdown floor the patient worked with physical therapy and the nursing staff to increase his strength and endurance.
