PULMONARY:  In regards to the patient's aspiration pneumonia, she continued to aspirate while having tube feedings through the OG tube.
After this CT scan chest finding, the OG tube feedings were discontinued and the patient was switched over to total parenteral nutrition for nutrition.
Aggressive chest Physical Therapy was done on the patient.
Since she continued to spike fevers and have elevated white counts, she was considered for a mini-tracheostomy that was supposed to be done on [**2142-6-4**].
However, she did defervesce with lowered white count to 13.3 48 hours prior the scheduled mini-tracheostomy placement on [**6-4**], so the mini-tracheostomy was cancelled.
The patient also received 20 days of Levofloxacin and Flagyl, and Zosyn was also added which she is currently at day nine.
The patient refused any intervention with cardiac catheterization.
Therefore, the following medical management was suggested by the Cardiology Team which consisted of Plavix, ACE inhibitor and Lopressor.

q. day and Metoprolol 37.5 mg p.o.
