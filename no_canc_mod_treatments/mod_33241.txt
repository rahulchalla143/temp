She did not take any medications for this because she was concerned it would interact with her other medications.
She complained of being more short of breath than usual, so her daughter called urgent care and took her to the ED.
She also received Percocet 2 tabs PO x1.
She received Zofran 4 mg IV x1, and since her repeat INR was 2.2 she was scheduled to receive another 2 U FFP.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 66 year old right handed woman with a history of mechanical MVR on Coumadin, atrial fibrillation s/p PPM, DM on insulin pump, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CHF, and COPD who presents with left upper and middle back pain and SOB s/p fall Saturday morning with head CT showing hemorrhage in the left medulla and possible small focus of SAH.
Her INR on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] was 2.2 hence received 2 more units of FFP and repeat head CT showed no change.
Since she does have significant risk factor for stroke without anticoagulation with her mechanical valve, she had repeat head CT on HD#2 ([**2-21**]) as well as on [**2-23**], both of which showed stability of her bleed.
She had been off of her coumadin and her INR drifted down to 1.6.
At this point she was started on a heparin gtt and re-started on coumadin.
The heparin gtt was later DC'd and she was started on full dose lovenox in anticipation of her discharge.
Her course was also complicated by a one-time fever to 102 F. Her urine was mildly dirty and she was started on Bactrim for 10 days given her prior indwelling foley.
Her lasix was held for one day and she received a half-dose (20 mg) the following day.
Her Cre subsequently improved and her usual dose of lasix was resumed (40 mg).
