Admission Date:  [**2158-8-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-8-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-3-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Motrin / Chlorhexidine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**] Chief Complaint: hepatic hydrothorax with bloody thoracentesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2158-8-4**]:  Right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery evacuation of hemothorax, removal of clotted hemothorax, talc pleurodesis.
History of Present Illness: 53 yoM with HCV and ETOH related cirrhosis (Childs Class C) on [**Month/Day/Year **] list complicated by chronic hydrothorax (always on right) requiring thoracentesis throughout past year, ascites, PVT, hepatic encephalopathy, grade 1 varices, and h/o SBP.
There is no history of infection related to the thoracentesis and per patient he has never had talc/pleurodesis.
Over past week his taps have been showing signs of blood and so he was admitted for evaluation by thoracic surgery for possible chest tube placement with talc/pleurodesis.
He has required frequent banding for esophageal varices and has failed TIPs procedure in past.
He was started on Cipro PPX after admission for SBP in 3/[**2157**].
He has recent PNA now s/p azithromycin course with residual cough but SOB, CP, fevers/chills.
In brief, this is a 53yo M PMHx HCV cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, varices, SBP, portal vein thrombus, ascites w recurrent hepatic hydrothorax, hypervolemic hyponatremia (on tolvaptan), initially presenting after patient had bloody thoracenteses, with patient remaining hemodynamically stable w unchanged Hct; hospital course notable for R chest tube placement and pleurodesis by Thoracic Surgery on hospital day 3; prior to undergoing chest tube placement, patient developed whole body [**Year (4 digits) **], blanching, maculopapular, thought to be allergic reaction to chlorhexadine wash.  Over 12 hours after chest tube placement and pleurodesis, patient had 400cc serosanguinous output; UOP fell overnight to <10cc/hour; HR increased from 70s to 150s, SBPs 130s to 90s, and patient developed new O2 requirement (initially on room air, slowly escalating to 4L then nonrebreather).
CXR did not demonstrate signs of PTX or new infection; given worsening symptoms, patient transferred to MICU for further management.

There is a right-sided chest tube with distal lead tip in the right apex and the second chest tube at the right base.
[**8-6**] CXR: FINDINGS: There is a right-sided chest tube with tip in the apex.
The right IJ central venous catheter has the distal lead tip in the proximal right atrium.
Given the trace ascites and the patient's elevated INR, this was deemed unsafe for a diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis.
No pneumothorax after chest tube removal.

Brief Hospital Course: 53yo M PMHx HCV cirrhosis c/b varices, ascites w recurrent hepatic hydrothorax, presented with recent history of blood thoracenteses in liver clinic.
Course was complicated by [**Month/Day/Year **] and hypoxia s/p CT placement requiring short stay in MICU.
# Hepatic Hydrothorax: Pt was previously receiving biweekly thoracentesis for management of hepatic hydrothorax but past several taps have come back bloody with hct of pleural fluid ranging from 4 to 13.
Pt was evaluated by thoracic surgery and CT with talc pleurodesis was performed twice.
Post procedure, course was complicated by pain and hypoxia requiring transfer to MICU (see below).
Pleurodesis ultimately was successful and chest tube pulled when drainage stopped.
#[**Name (NI) 10540**] - pt transferred to MICU with hypoxia in setting of recent chest tube placement.
Pt was splinting and taking small breaths from pain [**1-18**] procedure which could have exacerbated his ability to oxygenate well.
In setting of AMS, aspiration pneumonia was diagnosed and pt was started on vancomycin, levaquin and zosyn for broad spectrum coverage.
His oxygen saturation remained stable on 2L NC in ICU and he was transferred back to the floor.
He was treated with vancomycin and levaquin for a total of seven days.
His ascites worsened in setting of chest tube draining hydrathorax and 8L NS boluses.
# [**Name (NI) **] - Pt developed diffuse pruritic morbilliform eruption over extremities and trunk one day after washing with chlorhexadine soap for OR.
Pt was treated with zyrtec, sarna, clobetasol cream and antihistamines.
Ascites improved with diuresis and pt was not given paracentesis.
His lactulose was held transiently and narcotics were tapered.
Ultimately he started moving his bowels again and lactulose was restarted.
# Eosinophilia: h/o peripheral and pleural fluid eosinophilia, uncertain etiology.
Chronic thoracenteses have been documented to cause peripheral eosinophilia with pleural eosinophilia.
Stool was negative for O&P and pt was not on any medication that would be responsible for eosinophilia.
DM: Pt was continued on home glargine and ISS.
Transitionals: - final pleural bx read - avoid chlorhexadine in future.
Avoid azithromycin - needs outpatient paracentesis - f/u with thoracics and in hepatology clinic  Medications on Admission: - folic acid 1mg daily - furosemide 80mg in AM and 20 at PM - lactulose 30mL [**Hospital1 **] - prochlorperazine maleate 10mg q6h prn - rifaximin 550mg [**Hospital1 **] - spironolactone 100mg daily - ursodiol 250mg TID - ferrous sulfate 300mg daily - simethicone 80mg QID prn - thiamine HCl 100mg daily - Calcium QID prn - nadolol 20mg daily - ciprofloxacin 250mg q24hr - tolvaptan 60mg daily - omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 **] - VitD 50,000 units qweekly - glargine 20 units qAM, 34 units qHS - Humalog sliding scale   Discharge Medications: 1. ciprofloxacin 250 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: SBP ppx.

You also had a procedure done by cardio-thoracic surgery called a talc pleurodesis.
The purpose of this procedure is the scar the lining of your lung against your chest wall to prevent fluid from re-accumulating in that space.
A chest tube was placed to help the scarring process.
The surgeons removed the chest tube and you did not re-accumulate fluid in your lungs.
As such, we are scheduling you for another thoracentesis on Friday [**8-18**], which you can cancel if you do not feel that you will need it at that time.
You were transferred to the ICU for a day and treated with with IV fluids, pressors and IV antibiotics.
We held your lactulose for several days and your ileus improved.
You also developed a skin [**Month (only) **] due to a medication you took.
Please avoid both of these medications in the future.
