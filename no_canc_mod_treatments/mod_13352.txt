Intubation and mechanical ventilation.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known firstname 17937**] [**Known lastname 6633**] is a 53 yo female with PmHx of asthma, colon cancer s/p resection, HTN, osteoarthritis who was admitted for elective R knee arthroscopy [**2161-5-6**].
Ms. [**Known lastname 6633**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] R knee arthroscopy, with  repeat partial posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] medial meniscectomy, partial lateral meniscectomy.
Although she appeared to tolerate her surgery well, her immediate post-op course was complicated by diffuse wheeze and hypercarbic respiratory failure of unclear etiology (?bronchospastic adverse durg reaction) shortly after the LMA was removed, necessitating intubation.
She had received 1L of crystalloid, Decadron 10 mg and albuterol MDI x2 in the OR.
Medications administerd in the PACU included ketoralac, albuterol nebulizers, racemic epi neb, terbutaline 0.5 SC, lidocaine IV, ketamine, propofol peri-intubation.
She was maintained on empiric steroids, initially prednisone -> methylprednisolone, and then transitioned back to prednisone [**5-11**], as well as frequent nebs and inhaled steroids.
Her propofol was dicontinued, and switched to fentanyl/versed for sedation, and albuterol was also held.
She was given ASA, started on captopril, and was briefly on a nitroglycerin drip, later transitioned to isosorbide dinitrate.
4) ?GIB - after placement of an NG tube shortly after admission, she was noted to have ?coffee grounds.
GI was consulted, who felt that her coffee grounds may have been secondary to stress gastritis in the setting of high-dose steroids, and she was begun on frequent PPI.
It is not clear what her pre-admission BP regimen was, though outpatient notes indicate lisinopril alone (?dose).
She was begun on captopril -> lisinopril 20mg, HCTZ 25, and metoprolol, with improved control.

Received solumedrol taper and was converted to prednisone.
-rapid prednisone taper -MDIs -outpatient pulmonary workup, including PFTs.
-BP control as below -consider d/c of empiric nitrates -recommend outpatient ETT if has not been previously performed by outpatient cardiologist.
-Continued lisinopril 20 mg daily -continued metoprolol, titrate dose (though given asthma flare, preferred to increase ACE rather than b-blocker) -Continued HCTZ .
s/p arthroscopy: Wound was healing well and eventually tolerated weight bearing with physical therapy.
Hyperglycemia: Steroid induced, continue RISS .
She had no further comnplaints and was able to bear weight on her knee s/p arthroscopy.
She was discharged home in stable condition on a rapid prednisone rapid taper with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], and GI follow-up.
