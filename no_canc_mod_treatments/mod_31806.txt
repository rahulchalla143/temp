Received benadryl 25 IV x 2, IV famotidine 20 x2, methylprednisolone 125 x1.
ET tube approximately 3 cm from the carina.
Continued to have increase in swelling following steroids, histamine blockers, thus prompting ICU admission.
Received IV steroids, H2 blockers, diphenhydramine in ED with continued worsening of symptoms.
At this time she was intubated for airway protection; advanced intubation techniques were available but not required, as patient was intubated easily.
H2 blockers, diphenhydramine, steroids were continued.
ACE inhibitors were added to her allergy list.
She was kept on trach mask, then transitioned to nasal canula followed by room air and was satting well.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from the [**Hospital 9039**] clinic was consulted regarding the patient's steroid taper and the feasability of restarting aspirin for cardiac prevention.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] stated that medications for which the patient was taking for a period of at least one year were safe to resume, including HCTZ and aspirin, as these drugs caused angioedema through a mechanism that was unrelated to ACEI-related angioedema, the patient's likely diagnosis.
ACE inhibitor not continued as above.
Pt also reports being on hydrochlorothiazide at home (after extubation).
HTN mostly in the setting of discomfort from intubation and responded to sedating medications.

Please do NOT use Lisinopril anymore.
We restarted your metformin after the tube was removed from your throat and we confirmed it was safe for you to eat and swallow medications.
We also held your other medications (aspirin/ hydrochlorothiazide/gemfibrozil) during your hospital stay, as all of these medications have been known to cause either angioedema or urticaria (hives).
However, because you have taken aspirin for over a year, it is safe to continue using this drug.
We were unable to confirm your dose, however, and you should therefore not take this again until you see your primary doctor and have your blood pressure checked, as we started you on a new blood pressure medication (amlodipine).
Please follow the directions for your steroid taper, as listed in your discharge medications.
Many of the medications you were on put you at risk for repeated episodes of angioedema.
This was likely due to having a foley catheter in place to drain your urine.
