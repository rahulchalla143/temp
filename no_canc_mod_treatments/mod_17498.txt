HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 51-year-old woman, status post aortic valve replacement with a number 21 St. Jude valve on [**11-6**].
A transthoracic echo done at that time showed a circumferential pericardial effusion with right diastolic collapse, consistent with tamponade.
The patient then was brought to the cardiac catheterization lab for drainage of the pericardial perfusion.

LDH 815, amylase 20 and albumin 3.7.
Incision with small amount of murky drainage from the superior pole of the incision.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit for further observation following pericardial drainage.
She had a repeat echocardiogram which showed continued resolution of the pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade, following which she was transferred from the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to 524 for continuing post drain care and observation.
The pericardial drain was removed and an echocardiogram done on hospital day three also showed good cardiac function with no reaccumulation of the pericardial effusion.
She was, therefore, started on heparin and her Coumadin was resumed.
Her heparin doses were adjusted as were her Coumadin doses and the patient remained in the hospital awaiting her INR to reach therapeutic range once again.
