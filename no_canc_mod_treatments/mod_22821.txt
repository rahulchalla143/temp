Right hip fracture: s/p ORIF on [**2167-4-3**] as above, had adequate pain control with infrequent Tylenol as needed.
Incision was noted to have continuous serous oozing without evidence of infection.
A 5-day course of Ancef was given.
Patient is to continue prophylactic lovenox for 4 weeks from [**2167-4-3**]; it was held for one day due to significant ecchymosis and vitamin K was given to reverse INR.
Ecchymosis remained stable, showed evidence of slow resolution, and lovenox was restarted.
Please continue to monitor ecchymosis, INR, and incision drainage (staples removed [**2167-4-15**]).
Pt has had mental decline last 6 mos and family does report a long history of phlegm production and difficulty clearing his secretions w/o frank episodes of aspiration or hospitalizations for PNA.
Speech and swallow eval, video swallow noted aspiration and penetration with thin liquids and residue after all consistencies of barium and slow swallowing mechanism.
He was given PPN and advanced to a diet of ground solids and nectar pre-thickened liquids as well as Magic Cup dietary supplementation.
After reevaluation by the swallow team his liquids were advanced to thin liquids and PPN was discontinued.
PNA: Completed 7 day course of levaquin for PNA on CXR, clinically remained afebrile with unchanged baseline cough and no oxygen requirement.
Hernia: Inguinal hernia into scrotum that per pt and family is 25 years old without hernia repair given asymptomatic.
[**4-8**] ultrasound showed herniated loops of bowel with an area that may either represent hypoactive bowel with intraluminal air or potentially perf with free air.

Hyponatremia: to low 120s postop, labs indicated hypovolemic hyponatremia, which improved with normal saline hydration.
He subsequently redeveloped hyponatremia; cortisol was normal and a renal consultation found this consistent with SIADH, likely due to pain as he did not have any concerning medications or history to suggest another etiology.
His sodium has improved with fluid restriction of 1500mL daily and sodium supplementations.
He will need sodium checked every other day and may stop sodium supplementation when it is greater than 130.
He is not on home coumadin or aspirin given history of low platelets, per family.
Non-insulin dependent diabetes: His home glipizide was held and he remained on an insulin sliding scale.
Eventually his fingersticks and sliding scale insulin were stopped as he did not require insulin for over a week.
He is to STOP glipizide and continue diet modifications on discharge.
Edema: With fluid restriction and sodium supplementation he developed diffuse edema.
A test dose of Lasix was given and his serum sodium remained stable.
The edema improved markedly with Lasix and he is to continue Lasix until sodium supplmentation is stopped.
Incidental finding of carotid calcification on chest x-ray: Will require outpatient follow-up with primary care provider.
