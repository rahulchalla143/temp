He was put on a non-rebreather with sats responding to the 90s.
Because there was a question of him taking 80mg [**Hospital1 **] oxycontin plus PRN oxycodone (home dose only 40mg [**Hospital1 **] plus PRN), he received a dose of narcan with some response, so pt was placed on a narcan drip.
He was also started on BiPAP.
Pt was not given any abx, steroids or nebulizers in the ED.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were T99.4, P96, BP159/85, satting 95% on Assist Control (Tv500 R20 Peep10 60%FiO2).
