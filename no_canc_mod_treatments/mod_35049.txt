Admission Date:  [**2138-4-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-4-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2086-11-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: unintentional calcium channel blocker overdose   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CVL placement   History of Present Illness: 51 year-old man with Hep C/ETOH cirrhosis, IVDA with history of epidural abscess, chronic back pain, and HTN, who presents after overdosing inadvertantly on calcium channel blocker.
One round of chest compressions was completed and his HR improved and his pulse returned without further intervention.
En route he was started on levophed for SBP 70/20 MAP 30s.
His levophed was continued, insulin drip started at 40 units/hr, started on calcium chloride drip 2g/hour, D10 75/hr, and was given 1 bolus of intralipid (120cc).
He was started on vanc/Zosyn for possibility of infection.
In the MICU he was bolused with 6L IVF for suspected prerenal [**Last Name (un) **] and was seen by Renal who recommended bicarb gtt for acidosis.
He was started on a CIWA protocol for withdrawal.
Of note, his hct and platelets dropped following aggressive fluid resuscitation, but his hct has remained stable at 29.
Past Medical History: Cirrhosis secondary to EtOH and hepatitis C polysubstance abuse including IV heroin Epidural abscess and osteomyelitis, s/p back surgery at [**Hospital1 2177**] [**2133**] Chronic back pain HTN nephrolithiasis   Social History: Lives with mother.
ETOH 1-2 times per month, history of heavy ETOH prior to [**2125**], IVDA last used heroin 6 months ago, prior to that used cocaine, crystal meth and "everything in the book".
As previously pointed out, it would be odd for amlodipine to cause bradycardia since it is more selective for L-type calcium channels in the vasculature (as opposed to the nondihydropyridines, verapamil and diltiazem, which can cause bradycardia by acting on cardiac Ca channels).
Bradycardia might be expected with amlodipine in high doses, however.
Other possible ingestions were ruled out with negative serum tox screen, non-detectable digoxin level.
In the MICU the patient was treated with levophed for hypotension, and IVF to keep CVP 8-10.
He was started on an insulin gtt given with dextrose, which was stopped when the patient developed hypoglycemia.
He received an intralipid bolus in the ED and gtt in the MICU, which was subsequently stopped.
He was weaned off levophed and transferred to the floor.
He was monitored on telemetry and did not show any signs of PR prolongation or ST changes.
Patient's creatinine improved with IVF and was 2.2 when called out of ICU.
He was instructed to follow up with his hepatologist (reportedly at [**Hospital3 **]) after discharge since he reported a desire to seek treatment for his HCV.
He was placed on a CIWA protocol, but did not score higher than 3 after being started back on his home clonazepam [**Hospital1 **], raising the possibility that he was withdrawing from benzodiazepines.
He was started on a multivitamin, thiamine, and folate to be continued on discharge.
HTN: Given the patient was admitted with hypotension, his home HCTZ and lisinopril were held during admission and on discharge.
He was continued on his home methadone 30mg TID.
As social work pointed out, continuing this medication may make it difficult for the patient to be accepted into drug recovery/detox programs in the future if he so desires.
