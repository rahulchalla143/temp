He also had an increase in sputum production and he was coughing copious-green sections at that time.
The patient was started on Levaquin and Flagyl, but failed to improve.
The patient was placed on 100% oxygen by face mask.
He was given two liters of normal saline and he received a dose of Clindamycin.
Oxygen saturations were 100% on a nonrebreather face mask.
He defervesced following the administration of Clindamycin and Tylenol.
Blood pressure was 134/82, respiratory rate 22, and oxygen saturation 99% on a nonrebreather face mask.
The suprapubic catheter site was located in the intertriginous fold, beneath his pannus and it was moist without purulent exudate or erythema.
The patient was diaphoretic and he had stage III to IV decubitus ulcer in his right buttock, which was 3 cm x 3 cm x 4 cm deep, but with good granulation tissue and on exudate or drainage and a left hip sacral decubitus ulcer also without drainage or erythema.
Chest x-ray, compared to an AP of [**2184-6-21**], showed no cardiomegaly or effusions, lungs fields grossly clear, no cephalization, and a feeding tube in her abdomen.
PULMONARY:  The patient was placed on supplemental oxygen and received Gentamicin, Vancomycin and Flagyl.
The oxygen requirement decreased and by discharge the patient was requiring only two liters by nasal cavity and saturating well.
In the patient's recurrent history of aspiration pneumonia, it was recommended that the patient received tracheostomy to allow suction of secretions and to prevent repeated admissions for aspiration pneumonia.
Prior to discharge, the patient was discontinued on the Gentamicin, Vancomycin, and Flagyl and the patient was treated with Levofloxacin on which he was to be discontinued.
The patient does have a history of MRSA and multiple aspiration pneumonias, however, it was deemed at the time of discharge that Levofloxacin would be adequate coverage for these potential infections.
He was initially treated with Gentamicin, Flagyl and Vancomycin.
These antibiotics were given for empiric coverage of his previous resistant organisms.
The patient was discharged only on Levofloxacin and the primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was to follow up on the speciation results and restart Vancomycin as necessary, if the organism was deemed to be real infection and not contamination of those blood cultures.
Plastic Surgery determined that these wounds both looked good and they were not infected at this time.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Upon admission, the patient was noted to be severely hypovolemic and hyponatremic with a free-water deficit of greater than four liters and an overall volume deficit likely approaching six liters.
The hypovolemia and hyponatremia was deemed likely to osmotic diuresis relating to his poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus and glucosuria.
Upon discharge, the patient's sodium had corrected from greater than 156 to 142 with free-water boluses and he was clinically normovolemic.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was admitted with a PEJ tube and on admission, he was restarted on his tube feeds, which he tolerated well without residuals and he was quickly brought to full goals of tube feeds, tolerating these well.
He was initially started on an Insulin drip and he was quickly changed to a sliding scale with good controls of the blood sugars.
This edema was worrisome for deep venous thrombosis and ultrasound of the right upper extremity was ordered.
Numerous conversations were held with the patient's daughters who insisted on the patient being full code.
Insulin NPH 10 units subcutaneously q.a.m.
Levaquin 500 mg PO q.d.
Pepcid 20 mg q.h.s.
Aspirin 81 mg PO q.d.
Vitamin C. 7.
Multivitamin one tablet PO q.d.
The patient was to restart Baclofen 10 mg PO q.d.
