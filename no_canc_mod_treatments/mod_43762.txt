Prior to the admission, the patient was reportedly driving with onset of chest pain, SOB, and abdominal pain.
He suffered multiple injuries including C3-C5 spinal cord contusion, teardrop fx at C3, injury to ALL, multiple L periprosthesis femur fx, R [**4-3**] anterolateral rib fractures, and grade II liver lac.
He was aggressively fluid resuscitated and maintained on neo initially, before switching to midodrine PO.
He was evaluated by neurosurgery and found to be a non-operative candidate and the decision was made to keep him in a [**Location (un) 2848**] J c-spine collar at least 6 weeks at which point an MRI will be repeated.
Although a CT angiogram of the chest was negative for PE at the time of admission (pt was 2 weeks postop from a Lt distal femur fracture repair and suspicion of pulmonary embolism as mechanism of presenting chest pain, SOB was highly suspected at time of presentation to [**Hospital1 18**]), a CXR on [**11-4**] showed evidence of PE/infarction of the Lt lower lobe.
An IVC filter was placed on [**11-5**] to prevent further PE in a quadriplegic patient with traumatic contraindications for anticoagulation.
He also underwent ORIF of Lt femur fracture on [**2138-11-5**].
He was unable to be extubated due to easy fatigue and so received trach/PEG on [**11-6**].
The patient was intermittently febrile throughout his hospital course, as high as 103 on multiple occasions.
No sources of infection were found: sputum, BAL, urine, blood, indwelling catheters, pressure ulcers, sinus infections, wound infections, etc.
He was twice started on empiric antibiotics after spiking temperatures but these were discontinued after negative microbiology results.
Regarding the DVT, in addition to IVC filter placement, he was also started on lovenox and coumadin.
Despite high dose coumadin (20mg daily) he remained subtherapeutic and was discharged on lovenox and coumadin pending therapeutic INR.
In the emergency department, his initial vitals were T 98.4, BP 101/53, HR 72, RR 20, O2 sat 99% (unclear what initial vent settings were on presentation).
Also received ativan 0.5mg IV x 1.
SKIN: L thigh incision extending from hip to below knee with staples in place and minimal surrounding erythema, no fluctuance or drainage NEURO: A&Ox3.
Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left.
Stable variable multilevel multifactorial neural foraminal narrowing as described above.
Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.

He was kept on broad antibiotic coverage (vanc/levo/cefepime) awaiting culture results.
His Picc line was removed out of concern for a possible line infection, and the tip sent for culture (also no growth to date).
He was treated for HAP with Vancomycin, Cefepime and Levofloxacin for a total 7 day course from [**Date range (1) 81836**], at which point all cultures and micro studies were negative.
We are most suspicious of drug fever at this point, and all unecessary meds have been held.
Patient was treated for HAP as above.
He was most comfortable on pressure support [**9-1**].
# s/p C3-5 contusion.
He was continued on lovenox.
He can resume treatment as an outpatient.
