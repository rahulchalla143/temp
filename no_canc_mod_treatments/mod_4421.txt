HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year old man with a past medical history as described below, who initially presented to an outside hospital on [**2142-4-30**], with confusion, fatigue, fevers and palpitations.
Upon transfer, the patient was started empirically on Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone as treatment for meningitis given his change in mental status.
The patient had been anti-coagulated with Lovenox at the outside hospital because of his atrial fibrillation, however CT angiogram was performed again to rule out pulmonary embolism.
Prior to the CT angiogram being done, the patient experienced a significant episode of hematemesis for which the heparin drip was stopped.
Bilateral lower extremity non-invasive studies were done which were negative for deep vein thrombosis and the patient was restarted on the heparin drip.
His temperature at that time was noted to be 102.0 F.  Subsequently, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s which responded to aggressive volume resuscitation.
As the patient's blood pressure improved on intravenous fluids, lysis of his pulmonary embolism and likely recurrent massive pulmonary embolus was deferred.
He remained hemodynamically stable and anti-coagulated on heparin which was again complicated by a gastrointestinal bleed in which the patient had significant amounts of melena.
The patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit improved to 31.2 from a nadir of 28.0.
GI was consulted at the time and esophagogastroduodenoscopy was deferred.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2140**] at [**Hospital6 **] Hospital.
Post-polio syndrome.
Protonix 40 mg intravenously twice a day.
Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
Heparin drip with a goal PTT of 60 to 65 because of the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding.
Tylenol p.r.n.
Zocor 40 mg q. day.
Captopril 6.25 mg three times a day.
Lasix 20 mg intravenously q. day.
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers p.r.n.
Allopurinol 100 mg p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   At the time of admission, the patient was afebrile at 98.8 F., heart rate was 76; blood pressure 136/66; respiratory rate 20 and he was saturating 100% on a face tent at 15 liters per minute.
PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  The patient was continued on his heparin drip with a goal PTT as listed above.
Coumadin initiation was delayed for a couple of days while the Gastrointestinal and Cardiology Services consulted considering procedures to correct his atrial flutter and gastrointestinal bleeds respectively.
Ultimately, Coumadin was begun at 5 mg q. day and the patient's INR slowly increased.
For his wheezing, he received Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers on a p.r.n.
As the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding was stable, he was anti-coagulated and will be continued on anti-coagulation therapy for a minimum of six months.
No antibiotics were given after the day of admission after the lumbar puncture was done and was found to be negative.
Aspirin was held, however, because of his gastrointestinal bleeding.
The patient was started on Captopril which was titrated to 25 three times a day at the time of discharge and converted to Lisinopril 10 mg for decreased pill burden at the time of discharge.
In addition, he was started on Lopressor which was titrated to 50 mg twice a day and converted to atenolol once daily, again, for decreased pill burden.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient did not have either esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy this admission because of the ongoing need for anti-coagulation as well as his high O2 requirements earlier on in the hospital course.
The patient was continued on a proton pump inhibitor twice daily and the patient will follow-up with Gastroenterology within a short time after he discontinues anti-coagulation for both esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy.
Regardless, the patient was rate controlled with beta blocker and anti-coagulated already for his pulmonary embolism.
The patient will follow-up with Electrophysiology in approximately one month for follow-up EKG and possible intervention at that time.
It is possible that with treatment and resolution of his pulmonary embolism, the patient may convert back to sinus rhythm on his own, which is why no acute intervention was done.
HEMATOLOGIC:  Again, the patient was managed on a heparin drip with a low goal PTT range of 60 to 65, with initiation of Coumadin titrated up to 7.5 mg q. day.
Because of his falling hematocrit in the setting of his gastrointestinal bleed, the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells on [**2142-5-4**].
In addition, because of a slow decrease in his hematocrit over the subsequent three days, the patient was transfused one further unit of packed red blood cells on [**2142-5-7**].
VOLUME OVERLOAD:  Following the patient's hypotensive episode and aggressive volume resuscitation, he was ultimately approximately 13 liters positive for length of stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Once stabilized, he was begun on 20 mg of intravenous Lasix daily, which produced dramatic results of anywhere from 1.5 to 4 liters of diuresis daily.
Allopurinol 100 mg p.o.
Simvastatin 40 mg p.o.
Atenolol 50 mg p.o.
Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o.
Lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
In addition, he is to follow-up with his cardiologist in approximately one month for further management of his atrial flutter.
The patient will arrange follow-up with Gastroenterology after his course of Coumadin is complete for esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy.
