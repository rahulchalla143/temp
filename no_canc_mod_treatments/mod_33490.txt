On [**2137-8-14**], the patient underwent pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple) and open cholecystectomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter and a JP drain in place, and a Bupivacaine/Dilaudid epidural for pain control.
The NG tube was accidentally self-discontinued by the patient on POD#2 instead of removal on POD#3; the NGT was not re-inserted as the patient exhibited bowel sounds and the NGT put out only 150mL overnight.
The patient did not experience any subsequent abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.
On the morning of POD#3 ([**2137-8-17**]), the patient was noted to have incisional dehiscence, which, over the course of [**12-28**] hours, became overt evisceration with omentum showing in the field.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was on hand to evaluate the finding immediately, and followed the patient closely until he was able to bring the patient to the Operating Room early that afternoon for emergent exploratory laparotomy and repair of the abdominal incision dehiscence, which went well without complication (see Operative Note for further details).
Upon return to the floor post-operatively, the patient was NPO on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, and continued Bupivacaine/Dilaudid epidural for pain control with ongoing good effect.
He was started on sips of clears on [**2137-8-18**], and on [**2137-8-19**] the epidural was discontinued and changed to Dialudid PO PRN for pain control with good effect.
His diet was further advanced to clear liquids with good tolerability, and the foley was discontinued six hours after the epidural was removed.
The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay.
