Maternal history is significant for depression treated with Zoloft 150 mg daily.
He was suctioned and given bag mask ventilation by Anesthesia.
The infant was deleted both nares for cloudy, white fluid, and brought to the NICU with blow-by oxygen for monitoring.
O2 saturations were 80 in room air and 100% with blow-by oxygen.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Respiratory: Initially placed in nasal cannula O2 for decreased O2 saturations.
He weaned out of his cannula within 10 hours of age and remained in room air subsequent to that.
These resolved by day of life 2 and at the time of transfer to the newborn nursery, he had been free from desaturations for greater than 36 hours, saturating 99%-100% in room air without evidence of stridor or desaturations.
Due to concern for stridor upon admission, ORL from [**Hospital3 1810**] was consulted and the baby was seen in the NICU and underwent a flexible bronchoscopy at the bedside.
There was no further treatment indicated at that time.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition: Initially, the baby was maintained NPO and then was offered p.o.
feedings with Enfamil 20 or breast milk.
