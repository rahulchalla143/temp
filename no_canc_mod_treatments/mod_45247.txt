She required treatment for her severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for which she is on two liters of home oxygen.
She also was maintained on Levaquin throughout her hospital course until her date of discharge, [**2137-11-25**].
Over her hospital course, she was slowly weaned down to her baseline of two liters nasal cannula oxygen on [**2137-11-21**], however, that evening she became anxious and agitated and desaturated on the two liters down to 60% and required increasing oxygen to four to five liters.
During the hospital course, the patient also required nebulized treatments with Albuterol and Atrovent.
The patient was also maintained on Levaquin until her date of discharge.
The patient was also on Prednisone which was slowly weaned early on and then maintained at 30 mg because the patient showed no improvement in her decreased use of oxygen or decreased use of nebulized treatments and Prednisone was left at 30 mg p.o.
At the time of discharge, it is unclear if this represents a new baseline pulmonary status for this 76 year old woman with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and extensive smoking history or whether with time she will slowly return to baseline of two liters nasal cannula oxygen at home with nebulized treatments and MDIs every six hours.
Also during this time, she was maintained on MDIs of Serevent and Flovent.
The patient was maintained on an ace inhibitor for blood pressure control and remodeling benefits.
The patient was not maintained on a beta blocker because of her severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The patient has remained approximately stable for the previous ten days requiring four to five liters oxygen nasal cannula per minute and nebulized treatments every 3.5 to 4.5 hours consisting of Albuterol and Atrovent.
Also, the patient was maintained on Serevent and Flovent MDIs during this time.
