Admission Date:  [**2192-8-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2192-8-15**]   Service:  ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old female with a history of osteoporosis and compression fracture, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic anemia who was transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital for further management of Clostridium difficile colitis with toxic megacolon, sepsis, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
The patient had recently been on antibiotics for a urinary tract infection.
She received several transfusions.
She required intubation and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.
She was ventilated on assist control on pressor support with phenylephrine.
Bullous pemphigoid, for which she was treated with dapsone and prednisone for many years.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Medications on transfer included Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o.
q.d., Neo-Synephrine drip, hydrocortisone 20 mg intravenously q.6h., ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin.
Temperature was 97.6, heart rate was 100, blood pressure was 84/70 on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 27 mcg per minute.
She was on assist control ventilation at 12 respirations per minute with total volumes of 600 with an actual respiratory rate of 22, and FIO2 of 0.4, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 0.
Calcium was 5.5, a free calcium of 3.82, albumin was 1.1, phosphate was 8.4, magnesium was 2.4, AST was 418, ALT was 104, alkaline phosphatase was 96, total bilirubin was 1.5, direct bilirubin was 1.2, amylase was 60, lipase was 48.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at around 100 beats per minute with a first-degree AV conduction delay, left axis deviation, with left anterior vesicular block, T wave flattening in I and aVL.
In addition, she had developed acute renal failure with anuria and profound metabolic derangement with lactic acidosis and shock requiring treatment with pressors.
Her prognosis, given her age, comorbidities, and presentation was extremely grim.
The patient received massive volume resuscitation and was weaned off of Neo-Synephrine with upward titration norepinephrine.
She was continued on intravenous metronidazole and levofloxacin.
It was determined that she would need a total abdominal colectomy and ileostomy for toxic Clostridium difficile colitis; however, given her current level of systemic decompensation, it was determined that she would not survive the procedure and that it would be futile.
Shortly thereafter, the patient was extubated and support with pressors was withdrawn.
