She in fact correlates her weakness with a recent increase in her hydralazine dose from 10mg po TID to 25mg po TID three weeks ago.
Of note, asymptomatic ST depressions were noted on precordial leads V2-V4.

She was given Vitamin K 10mg po and two units of FFP and transfused with a total of 4 units of blood within the first 18 hours of her presentation.
Her antihypertensives and betablockers were held initially, then restarted.
# Acute on Chronic biventricular diastolic heart failure: Torsemide was restarted once patient was stable.
Also restarted BB,  imdur 20 mg three times daily, hydralazine 25 mg three times daily once hct stabilized.
Her hydralazine and imdur were held in the setting of uptitrating her lopressor and SBP only in the 100s-110.
Pts cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**], was consulted while pt was here given her tenuous volume status at home and the need for many medications changes (ie increasing her lopressor, holding her imdur/hydralazine), and noted her weight was up 10 lbs from her dry weight.
Her torsemide was continued at 40 mg three times a day, and she received metolazone 2.5 mg intermittently.
Her hydralazine was restarted at 10 mg TID, her imdur was re-titrated in at 10 mg tid, and it was felt by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] that if her BP runs in 90s-100s systolic, this is ok.
Given her intake and output were essentially even on her home diuretic regimen, she was started on lasix 80 mg IV with metolazone 5 mg prior to each dose.
Her home dose of torsemide 40 mg tid and metolazone 2.5 mg as needed was restarted at discharge as this seems to keep her just euvolemic.
Daughter requested we start prophylactic antibiotics, however it was felt that bactrim would interfere with pts coumadin, and macrobid could be neurotoxic in the setting of chronic kidney failure.
On NPH [**Hospital1 **] plus RISS.
# Hypertension:  Initially many BP meds were held due to hemodynamic instability.
As per below, pt developed a fib with RVR, requiring her hydralazine and imdur to be held while increasing her lopressor.
Hydral was titrated back in at 10 mg tid and imdur was titrated back in at 10 mg tid.
#A.Fib with RVR: Given massive recent bleed, the source of which has not been treated (or identified), coumadin was stopped.
Upon discussion with pts daughter and pts cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**], it was felt her GI bleed was in the setting of supratherapeutic INR and she has a high risk for stroke off of coumadin.
We agreed on restarting coumadin, and if pt is on antibiotics at any given time for her frequent urinary tract infections she will need her INR monitored twice weekly (daughter aware).
This was in the setting of her lopressor having been held.
Lopressor was resumed at her home dose of Toprol 100 mg daily.
Rate was stlll noted to be in the low 100s, so lopressor was increased to 75 mg tid (225 mg daily) for rate control.
Many attempts needed to be made to explain why certain medication changes were being made.
The pts daughter often felt medication changes were not appropriate and questioned care, when the changes indeed ended up being beneficial (ie daughter was initially upset about metoprolol being titrated up, but pts HR was in the 120s.
#Dementia: Pt is oriented to place "hospital", but not year.
# Chronic Kidney Failure, stage 3: Cr remained at baseline of approx 2.2-2.6. .
