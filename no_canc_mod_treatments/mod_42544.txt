MRA CHEST  CLINICAL INDICATION: A 45-year-old man with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, DM1, hypertension, and heart failure with severe hypertension, chest pain.
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted MR images were acquired on a 1.5 Tesla magnet without the administration of intravenous gadolinium.
FINDINGS:  Central vein catheter in place with tip in SVC.
Fioricet was started to treat his headache.
He eventually underwent an LP under fluoroscopic guidance at interventional radiology with CSF only notable for a mildy elevated opening pressure of 27 cm H2O.
His headaches persisted despite these interventions.
Pain was consulted and felt that dilaudid may be helpful.
His HTN medication was aggressively uptitrated with the thought this this would help his headaches.
On the day of his IR guided LP, he received 1 mg of IV Ativan, which decreased his RR to 8 and he appeared very sleepy.
He also received 4 mg IV morphine to help control his HA, but he also developed decreased RR to 8 and the same sleepiness.
He was not given these medications any more.
He was started on low dose MS-contin [**Hospital1 **] and 25 mg topomax [**Hospital1 **].
Approximately 36 hours after these medications were started the patient was completely somnolent and responsive to sternal rub only.
He was given Narcan 0.4 mg approximately three times over the course of his somnolence and woke up briefly.
It was felt the patient was on too much sedating medication causing this deleterious effect.
All opiates, topomax, and gabapentin were all d/c'd.
He was given an extra day of HD in hopes that this would clear some of the medication that has built up in his system.
These medications should be re-started only if absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
He was not given any more sedating medication and only given standing tylenol, 1000 mg q 8H.
Surprisingly, tylenol by itself appeared to control his headaches in the days leading up to discharge.
He began to take all of his anti-hypertensives everyday of the week, including on HD days.
His BP medications were increased to maximal doses.
A clonidine patch was added at 0.1 mg q weekly.
His MICU course was uneventful as his blood pressure decreased with IV hydralazine x 1 and po labetalol, along with taking his BP medications.
He did not need an IV drip for blood pressure.
He was then started on Minoxidil 10 mg po BID.
Minoxidil was decreased to 5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
After consultation with renal on the day of discharge, his current regimen is as follows: --Lisinopril 80 mg po daily (To be held the mornings prior to HD) --Valsartan 320 mg qhs --Carvedilol 25 mg po BID --Minoxidil 5 mg po BID (To be held the mornings prior to HD) ---Close follow up with his bp is highly recommended.
He was discharged on metoclopramide 5 mg PO TID.
Further evaluation of this standing medication should be evaluated by his PCP at his next visit.
# Neuropathy: gabapentin was increased to TID initially, but when patient became somnolent for several days, this medication was discontinued.
Of note, he was on a very high dose for HD patients (300 mg TID).
Caution should be made in the future if this medication were to be re-started.
He was continued on a lidocaine patch for chronic left flank pain.
He was continued on citalopram.
[**Name (NI) **] is to be followed with psychiatry in rehab.
He was not given antibiotics and his fevers resolved.
