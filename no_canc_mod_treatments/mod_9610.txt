HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He is a 69-year-old man with COPD dependent on oxygen at home and steroids, question type 2 diabetes, question insulin dependent.
He was intubated and treated for right middle lobe, right lower lobe pneumonia.
First CPK at the time and troponin were negative and no work-up was done at the time for his left bundle branch block.
We had difficulty weaning the patient off of the intubation and so he was given a tracheostomy and a PEG tube on hospital day 11 there and treated as well for a COPD with Solu-Medrol converted to Prednisone.
He was found to have MRSA in his sputum and was treated with Vancomycin and Unasyn and then was discharged to a rehab unit, [**Hospital1 **], on [**6-27**].
He was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
CPK and troponin were checked and the first set was found to be negative, second set to be positive.
He was started on Heparin drip.
Central line which was a month old on the right subclavian side, was changed over a wire at the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.
No antibiotics were started.
He was made comfortable with Morphine Sulfate.
Blood pressure did not respond to intravenous therapy.
He was started on Dopamine drip and transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for a possible cardiac catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for COPD on home O2 and chronic Prednisone, type 2 diabetes mellitus, question of insulin dependent,  his reason for starting on insulin was unclear.
MEDICATIONS:  On transfer from the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital were Heparin drip, Dopamine drip at 5 mg/kg per minute, Prednisone 20 mg po q day, Regular insulin sliding scale with Fentanyl patch at 20 mcg per 72 hours transdermally, Zolpidem 5 mg po q h.s., Pericolace 30 mg po bid, Reglan 10 mg po qid, Lansoprazole 30 mg po bid and Albuterol and Atrovent nebs.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient's examination was consistent with a 99.1 temperature, 125/81 blood pressure, on the Dopamine drip, pulse 84, respiratory rate of 28, saturation of 100%.
Chest x-ray showed no CHF, question of cardiomegaly, right upper lobe and right lower lobe infiltrates  HOSPITAL COURSE:  He had a central venous line placed, a right four lumen catheter was put in and in addition: 1.
He was maintained on Aspirin and Heparin.
The patient did not have a PA catheter placed and the patient was maintained on that regimen.
He was started on Warfarin eventually and patient's Heparin was weaned off after several days.
On [**7-25**] with the atrial fibrillation, DC cardioversion was done with 200 joules and the patient tolerated the procedure.
Again he was kept on the Heparin and the Warfarin and then the Heparin was discontinued when the INR reached between 2 and 3.
The patient was loaded with Amiodarone IV and then [**Hospital1 **] and then was slowly tapered down so that by the time of discharge he was on 200 mg po bid and that will be needed through [**8-5**] and he will be on 200 mg po q day thereafter.
The patient received, during the course of his stay, three units of packed red blood cells because we wanted to keep his hematocrit above the level of 30 based on his coronary artery disease.
He had arrived again on a Dopamine drip and that was weaned off from his admission on [**7-14**] to [**7-16**].
The patient was eventually, after his blood pressure became more normal, kept on Metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid and Captopril 6.25 mg po tid for the cardio protection of his heart subsequent to his anterior myocardial infarction and he was also, for a brief period of time, treated with, instead of Captopril, Hydralazine 10 mg po IV qid with Isosorbide Dinitrate 10 mg tid while the patient was in renal failure.
The Metoprolol and Captopril should be given in a staggered way such that the patient's blood pressure does not bottom out when the medications are given together.
Pulmonary:  The patient remained on the tracheostomy.
He was maintained between pressor support levels of 10 and 20 during that week and then after secretions were reduced, he was returned to trach mask and pressure support trials, however, he was not able to be weaned entirely.
He has a history of chronic steroid needs and so he arrived with 20 mg of Prednisone q d, was weaned down to 50 mg po q day and it can eventually be weaned down further but he was left at 50 mg upon discharge.
An arterial line was placed and then had to be removed after admission because of positive blood cultures.
The patient did better upon restoring him to pressure support and the A line was assisting in that measurement.
The patient was given Mucomyst in anticipation of a PICC line to be placed which did not have to be placed and so the patient received Mucomyst which is N-Acetylcysteine but did not actually have the PICC line placed.
The patient ceased to have guaiac positive stools within the three days of admission and resolved afterwards and the patient did not have a problem even after he was gotten on a therapeutic level of Warfarin.
The patient was given tube feeds, Respalor at 45 cc per hour and he tolerated it well.
He was not maintained on the Mitocropomide during his admission.
ID:  On [**7-14**] the patient had urine with Serratia which was treated with Levofloxacin for three days.
A triple lumen catheter tip was positive for MRSA, that is the one that had been in for a month.
The patient was treated with Vancomycin 1 gm IV q 12 hours for a 14 day course.
In between that, he went into acute renal failure so his Vancomycin was changed from q 12 hours to dosing by Vanco levels below 15.
The patient also had sputum on [**7-14**] with pseudomonas, first thought to be colonized, then a week later after being treated for his MRSA bacteremia was still found to have an elevated white cell count.
Pseudomonas was found again and was treated with Ceftazidime 1 gm IV q 8 hours for 10 days, ending on [**7-28**].
The patient was treated with Metronidazole 500 mg po tid and that will continue through [**8-7**] for a 14 day course.
The patient was found on the 19th to have yeast in his urine and so his Foley catheter was changed.
The CT was done to find additional signs of infection and that was eventually found to be due to C. diff and the patient's white count went up to the 20's and then started to trend down again once being treated with the PO Metronidazole for his C. diff.
Endocrine:  The patient was maintained on his tube feeds, held for different procedures.
He had elevated blood glucose levels which led to an insulin drip for a period of time until he was titrated down to normal levels and then started on NPH insulin twice a day, 18 units subcu and then completed with a regular insulin sliding scale and when his NPH level should be titrated up or down depending on his fingersticks which are measured q 6 hours until he is stable.
Therefore he was maintained on Paroxetine 20 mg po q day and Lorazepam originally 1 mg po tid and then .5 mg po tid with rescues.
He was also given Zolpidem 5-10 mg po q h.s.
Access:  The patient had a triple lumen catheter which was in for weeks, removed and found to be contaminated.
PICC line was placed on [**7-17**].
The patient was prophylactically maintained on Pantoprazole and then Lansoprazole 30 mg po q day and then Warfarin.
