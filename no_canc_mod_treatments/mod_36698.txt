US is suggested for further evaluation.
While patient does have significant ILD, presumed to be due to RA, it was not felt with rheumatologic and pulmonary consults that she was having acute decompensations of her lung disease, but that rather, it was serving as a poor baseline for transient hypoxic insults.
Patient was maintained on prednisone 10 mg which was not increased as it was felt to not be likely to help and instead worsen her mental status.
Her ABGs largely reflected a metabolic alkalosis with PO2s in the 60s on high levels of oxygen (generally upwards of 6L NC, occasionally requiring shovel or NRB).
Thus, no further intervention was made and patient was maintained on oxygen, tolerating an oxygen saturation as low as 88-93%.
Geriatrics was consulted and recommended various medications to help calm her mood, of which Haldol was eventually decided upon.
# RA: As mentioned above, ILD was felt to be due to RA and rheumatology was consulted with recommendations to continue current therapy.
She was thus maintained on prednisone and plaquenil.
Afterload reduction was also started with Captopril.
#Hypothyroidism: Patient was maintained on Levothyroxine.

Discharge Instructions: You were seen and evaluated for a low oxygen level, which was ultimately felt to be due to lung disease associated with your rheumatoid arthritis as well as extra fluid in your lungs from congestive heart failure.
That being said, it has also been decided on your behalf by your son and health care proxy that you are not to be hospitalized any further.
