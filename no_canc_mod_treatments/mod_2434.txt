Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed a sternal debridement with bilateral pectoralis muscle closure of open sternal wound on the left with a thoracoacromial based flap on the right.
Several JP drains were placed at that time.
Medical therapy including intravenous Vancomycin was resumed.
The wound and JP drainage was monitor closely.
She remained reasonably comfortable but required Percocet for adequate pain control.
Due to a non-functional PICC line, a new PICC line was placed on [**3-10**].
Mrs. [**Known lastname 4698**] had a small amount of wound separation that was sutured with a total of five 4-O nylon sutures with good approximation.
Here remaining JP drains continued to decrease in output of serosanguinous drainage.
Her sternotomy incision was clean, dry, and intact without evidence of infection.
