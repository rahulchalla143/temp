The patient was on a dopamine infusion as well as Natrecor which was transitioned to hydralazine.
The rash was sufficiently resolved, and the patient was to the operating room with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 255**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for a redo mitral valve replacement with #27 mosaic valve via a right thoracotomy.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in critical condition on a dobutamine, milrinone, Levophed, and propofol infusions.
On arrival to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was started inhaled nitric oxide for his consistently evaluated pulmonary artery pressures.
A Cardiology and Electrophysiology consultation was obtained to reprogram the patient's permanent pacemaker and chest for function.
The patient was started on amiodarone, and the pacemaker was found to be in good working condition.
By postoperative day three, the patient had weaned to 2.5 mg of dobutamine, milrinone at 0.5, inhaled nitric oxide at 30 parts per million, and intra-aortic balloon pump at 1:1.
The patient was started on a Lasix infusion for diuresis.
The milrinone was weaned down.
The patient remained intubated on mechanical ventilation.
The patient was started on tube feeds.
It was noted after removal that there was a loss of pulse in the right lower extremity.
Recommended a low-dose heparin drip.
The patient continued to be dependent on nitric oxide and milrinone.
It was recommended that the patient be started on nitroprusside for afterload reduction as well as reduction in the pulmonary vascular resistance to facilitate weaning of the nitric oxide.
The milrinone infusion was increased.
They recommended aggressive diuresis, aggressive afterload reduction, and gentle weaning of the anatropic support.
The patient was continued on a heparin infusion as well as a Lasix drip for diuresis.
The patient's ventilator was weaned to continuous positive airway pressure with pressure support which he tolerated well with adequate oxygenation.
The milrinone was weaned down to 1.25, and the patient was weaned and extubated on postoperative day 11.
The patient's milrinone drip was increased.
The patient was started on Natrecor, and the Lasix drip was increased to increase his diuresis.
However, three hours of extubation the patient required reintubation for respiratory distress and hypoxia.
The patient's milrinone infusion continued at 0.37.
By postoperative day 13, it was thought that the patient was euvolemic and the Lasix and Natrecor infusions were stopped.
The patient had been started on vancomycin for increasing white blood cell counts.
