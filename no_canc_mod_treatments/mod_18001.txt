Brief Hospital Course: This is the hospital course for a 81 year old man with systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 45%), hypertension, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin with vascular dementia, and recent pneumonia here with what was thought to be a CHF exacerbation, but was an aspiration pneumonia.
This was treated with IV furosemide and the patient was placed on BiPAP.
He was started on a furosemide drip and continued to improve.
He was able to be weaned from his oxygen requirement, discontinued from his drip diuresis, and then transferred to the cardiology floor.
The C. Difficile colitis was treated with a vancomycin 14 day course.
Per urology, the patient is to have Foley catheter for 3 weeks due to a large hydrocele.
Video swallow study performed on [**2133-6-5**], confirmed worsening of patient's ability to tolerate nectar-thickened diet, progressed to honey-thickened with aspiration precautions.
We were unable to assess his mental status upon arrival to the floor due to his somnolence and baseline dementia.
He should remain on PO Vancomycin until [**2133-6-20**] to complete his 14 day course for C.Diff colitis.
Also he should make a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for evaluation of his hydrocele and continued Foley catheter.

These aspirations can increase your risk for pneumonia, however, since you were recently treated for a pneumonia and your exam and bloodwork were not consistent with pneumonia, we thought this diagnosis was unlikely.
