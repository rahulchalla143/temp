She was covered for HCAP with Vancomycin and Zosyn, extended past the typical 8-day coverage due to the severity of her pneumonia and extremely high O2 requirement of 6L NC and high-flow O2 through the mask.
Her severe conjunctivitis was treated with erythromycin ointment on admission and improved markedly over her hospital course.
BiPAP was initiated without benefit, though orotracheal suctioning seemed to stimulate her cough and wake her up.
Given the irreversibility of her condition, the family decided to transition the patient to comfort measures only and morphine boluses were given for comfort.
