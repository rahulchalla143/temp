On day of life 3, she developed a spontaneous left sided     pneumothorax which was treated with a thoracentesis and     then chest tube drainage.
The infant was reintubated     orally and placed back on conventional mechanical     ventilation with settings of 18/5 and a rate of 30 and     30% oxygen.
The air leak persisted and multiple     replacements and manipulations of the left thoracostomy     tube were necessary to maintain drainage of the air leak.
In spite of these maneuvers, the air leak persisted and     on day of life 9, a second chest tube was placed,     positioned subpulmonic to relieve reaccumulation of the     air leak on the left side.

She was started     on vancomycin and gentamicin on day of life 8 for the     initial decompensation and concerning CBC as explained     above.
She was also given oxacillin for her multiple     manipulations of the thoracostomy tubes and was started     on cefotaxime for broader coverage on day of life 10.
