Patient admit to OSH around [**10-10**] with resp distress at home requiring intubation in the field after a feeling of anxiety and urge for Ativan.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] given tenuous condition and history of care by ENT at [**Hospital1 18**]   Past Medical History: -Coronary artery disease s/p CABG in [**2118**] and "recent" PCI -CHF, last TTE [**2138-9-12**] EF 60% with mild LVH and some focal hypokinesis at base.
-OSA -Dyslipidemia -HTN -Left total hip replacement-[**1-27**], elective.
Complicated postoperative course with post-operative atrial fibrillation wtih RVR requiring cardioversion, sepsis, Pseudomonas VAP, VRE UT, and prolonged intubation leading to trach/PEG.
-Supraglottic edema from GERD -Bipolar disorder -Depression -chronic atrial fibrillation, developed postop from THR, not anticoagulated -Chronic constipation -HIT during Fragmin therapy   Social History: Married.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT of the chest was performed before and after administration of intravenous contrast.
Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in place.
There is thinning of myocardium associated with calcification at the apex of the heart, and could be result of prior myocardium infarction.
STRESS MIBI:  RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA: 9.2 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Tetrofosmin Rest ([**2138-10-20**]); 30.2 mCi Tc-99m Tetrofosmin Stress ([**2138-10-20**]); HISTORY: 67 year old woman with CAD and CHF, admitted for recurrent episodes of pulmonary edema, evaluate for perfusion defects.
Following resting images and two minutes following intravenous dipyridamole, approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-99m tetrofosmin was administered intravenously.
Gated images reveal hypokinesis of the basal inferior, apex, and inferolateral wall.
STRESS EKG: RESTING DATA EKG:  SINUS, T WAVE FLATTENING INFERIORLATERALLY HEART RATE:  74 BLOOD PRESSURE:  112/56  PROTOCOL  / STAGE TIME SPEED ELEVATION [**Doctor Last Name 10502**] HEART BLOOD RPP   (MIN) (MPH) (%)   RATE PRESSURE 1 0-4 0.142MG/ KG/MIN   80 96/46 7680  TOTAL EXERCISE TIME:  4 % MAX HRT RATE ACHIEVED:  52    INTERPRETATION: Ms. [**Known lastname 16471**] is a 67 year old woman with coronary artery disease s/p CABG in [**2125**] and PCI, COPD who presented with worsening dyspnea.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo F with PMH significant for recent trach with tracheocutaneous fistula closure trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH, intubated after suspected flash pulmonary edema brought on by severe anxiety.
Initially admitted to SICU, subsequently extubated and transferred to floor after aggressive diuresis.
On floor patient was managed with anti-anxiety medications, further diuresis and oxygen therapy (patient uses CPAP at baseline at night).
ENT evaluated for revision of fistula but surgical intervention was deemed unnecessary at this time.
Initial concern for new cardiac cause of flash pulmonary edema, particularly given hx of CHF, however stress MIBI showed no change from study done earlier this month at [**Hospital1 3278**] with several fixed areas of hypoperfusion (see earlier section for complete result).
Patient was managed with further diuresis, nebs and eventually weaned to room air with night time CPAP which is her baseline.
Managed on home medications.
COPD: Managed with home medications .
DIABETES: Managed on home insulin regimen, ASA, statin and ACE-I .
DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Likely contributing to flashes, managed aggressively with ativan, and home medications of lamictal, seroquel, and sertraline.
Patient discharged with additional Ativan and recommended to follow up with her out-patient psychiatrist.
