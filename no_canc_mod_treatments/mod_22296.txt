Typically, her migraines headaches are throbbing, unilateral, and relieved with ibuprofen and sleep.
Ativan IV was given with questionable respone.
Acyclovir was then started for diagnosis of viral meningoencephalitis after MRI, with OSH prelim reports stating "right parietal infarct vs. inflammatory disease, inc. diffusion signal on L side, ?
Neuro (meningoencephalitis, seizures, venous sinus thrombosis): Given the concern for viral meningoencephalitis, pt was treated empirically with acyclovir pending HSV PCR results from CSF.
Once results were negative, acyclovir was discontinued.
At the OSH, she initially had focal motor seizures (and one secondarily generalized) involving her left hand and dilantin was started there.
While at [**Hospital1 18**], she developed paroxysmal paresthesias of her right face and hand, once accompanied by speech arrest as well.
However, given her desire for furture pregnancies, it was decided to start lamictal so that dilantin could be discontinued in several months.
Etiology was likely due to a combination of factors, including being 3 months post-partum, on birth control pills prior to admission and the viral meningoencephalitis.
She was started on coumadin, and was maintained first on heparin and then on lovenox until INR was therapeutic.
Acyclovir was restarted until repeat HSV was negative.
VZV and Bartonella were also negative.
Concern was for a drug rash, and unasyn and acyclovir were discontinued.
Therefore, she was started on trileptal for her seizures and dilantin was slowly tapered.
A few days later she continued to have fevers to 104 and rash, and both lamictal and dilantin were stopped.
Transaminitis: Liver enzymes were checked as part of workup for fever, and both AST and ALT were mildly elevated.
Hepatitis serologies were negative, except for Hep B surface antibody positive, consistent with hep B vaccination.
Tylenol dosing was decreased, and dilantin was discontinued with improvement in LFTs.
Etiology was unclear, but most likely represented a medication side effect.
