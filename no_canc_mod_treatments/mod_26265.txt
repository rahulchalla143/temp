Broad spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Gentamicin were initiated.
She continued to clinically deteriorate and required increased pressors.
The patient returned to the CCU briefly, where she decompensated further and required four pressors.
At that time, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room where Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed redo sternotomy and aortic valve replacement with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical size 19 mm valve.
She experienced a postoperative coagulopathy, receiving large amounts of blood products.
Echocardiogram was consistent with tamponade and she eventually required re-exploration with significant improvement in hemodynamics.
Due to prolonged ventilation period, tube feedings were initiated.
She remained stable on medical therapy and maintained on intravenous Heparin for her mechanical aortic valve.
Warfarin was eventually resumed and dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 3.0.
Due to hyponatremia, she was placed on fluid restriction.
She tolerated hemodialysis and was noted to have gradual improvement in renal function.
Due to improving renal function, hemodialysis was eventually discontinued.
