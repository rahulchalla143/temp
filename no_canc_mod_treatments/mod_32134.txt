MRSA screen pending  Brief Hospital Course: 49y F hx of autoimmune hepatitis, RA on steroids/6MP presenting with cough, malaise, fever, back pain, and admitted to MICU for hypotension.
Her immunosuppressive medications increases our suspicion of and underlying infection cause and may explain the observed normal white count.
Given clinical stability overnight and high suspicion for adrenal insufficiency, her broad spectrum abx were discontinued.
She was continued on stress dose steroids overnight and transitioned to home prednisone dose on HD1.
She did not require pressors or additional fluid boluses once she reached the MICU.
Given immunosuppression with steroids and 6-MP, may not manifest leukocytosis.
Increased risk of infection given concomitant prednisone and 6-MP.
Fine macular rash on torso could be related to infectious etiology and more likely viral exanthem.
Repeat chest xray did not show progression or new findings after receiving IVF in the ED.
Broad spectrum antibiotics quickly narrowed to levofloxacin with clinical improvement.
GIven immunosuppression and septic presentation she will complete an empiric 10 day course of levofloxacin.
# [**Doctor First Name 48**]: Baseline creat 0.7 - noted to be 1.2 prior PCP visit now down to baseline after fluids overnight - most likely prerenal azotemia related to poor po intake prior to hospitalization.
# autoimmune hepatitis: On prednisone and mercaptopurine.

You take prednisone and mercaptopurine for your rheumatoid arthritis which puts you at risk for infections.
You also had missed several days of your prednisone.
Initially you were put on strong IV antibiotics, but as your urine and blood cultures have been negative, we switched you to an oral antibiotic called Levofloxacin which you should take for 10 days total (last day [**2181-9-10**]).
You should discuss with your outpatient doctor if you should start taking Bactrim, an antibiotic for prophylaxis against possible lung infections for people who take immunosuppressing drugs.
You were briefly on this medication in the hospital but are not being discharged on this medication.
Changes to medication: START Levofloxacin (last day [**2181-9-10**]) START Pantoprazole (for prophylaxis against ulcers, which can happen especially for people on prednisone) START Calcium (please get your thyroid levels checked as calcium can interact with levothyroxine) START vitamin D  Followup Instructions: Please call your primary care physician [**Name9 (PRE) 76022**],[**Name9 (PRE) 8694**] [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
