The patient was begun on antibiotics including 1 gm of Ceftriaxone IV q 12 day beginning on [**9-30**] as well as 1 gm of Vancomycin given on [**9-30**].
On [**10-1**] the patient was begun on 1.25 gm of Vancomycin q 12 hours, all for presumed pneumonia.
The patient was also begun on Levofloxacin 500 mg po q day on [**9-30**].
The Indomethacin was changed in the face of hematocrit drop and gastrointestinal bleeding to Vioxx in the dosage of 50 mg po q day on [**10-4**], although it was initially suspected that the patient might have pneumonia, she did not present with a fever nor did she present with an elevated white blood cell count.
The patient was initially anticoagulated with Heparin, however, in the face of dropping hematocrit and OB+ stool, Heparin was discontinued on [**10-3**] and the patient was transfused times two units for hematocrit drop from approximately 27.2 to 23.8.
Because of concern about the potential underlying coagulopathy, Heparin was restarted on [**10-5**].
Because of her extensive psychiatric history including leaving the [**Hospital6 17430**] against medical advice, the patient was seen on [**9-30**] by psychiatry which suggested minimizing non essential sedating medications until the patient was more alert.
The patient was seen by hematology and it was suggested that laboratories be sent for hypercoagulability work-up which have been negative to date, however, in light of the patient's compromised lung status, decision was made to restart anticoagulation as the patient was clinically not greatly improved.
On [**10-5**] intern was called to see the patient for shortness of breath, status post bronchoscopy with oxygen saturation approximately 68% on three liters, increasing only to 88% on five liters as well as tachypnea.
The patient, at that time was diuresed for presumed pulmonary edema and was also given nebulizers and improved and stayed on the floor.
In the MICU the patient was treated with Ceftaz and Clindamycin for a presumed nosocomial pneumonia and/or aspiration pneumonia and aggressively was diuresed for pulmonary edema.
A  hemorrhage or diffuse alveolar damage although it was considered odd that it was less than unilateral, oxygen requirements in the MICU decreased with diuresis in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient on [**10-14**] required only 50% Venti Mask and oxygen saturation of 96 and was transferred back to the floor.
The patient was continued on Heparin as well as Coumadin for presumed coagulopathy although again it should be noted that today these, including anti-thrombin III, protein C and factor 5 leiden were negative.
Interventional pulmonology was reconsulted who suggested holding on empiric steroids but pursuing the possibility of open lung biopsy to confirm or rule out the possibility of post pericardial injuries.
Pulmonary re-consult suggested the possibility of "trapped lung" regarding her left lower lobe collapse and felt thoracic surgery should reconsult re: possible surgical decortication.
