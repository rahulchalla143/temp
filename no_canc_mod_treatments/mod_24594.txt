Hypotension: she was hypotensive to the 80s/40s on admission and was resuscitated with fluids and was briefly on vasopressors in the intensive care unit but quickly weaned off.
Her hypertension medications were held.
Her blood pressure improved with crystalloids, she remained afebrile, her white count remained normal, and her hypotension was attributed to volume loss from diarrhea and possibly the toxic effects from clostridium difficile.
She clinically improved overall on antibiotics for c.diff, was otherwise without symptoms or signs of sepsis physiology afterwards, and remained hemodynamically stable for the remainder of her admission.
Clostridium difficile and diarrhea: She was first initiated on intravenous flagyl and vancomycin and then transitioned to oral vancomycin alone on hospital day 2 when she was noted to have another c.diff infection.
Her diarrhea clinically improved, and the decision was made to continue a 14-day course of oral vancomycin.
As her blood pressure improved, her home dose of labetalol was added on hospital day 3.
On recommendation from Renal, amlodipine and clonidine were not restarted, and she was instructed to follow up with her primary physician and dialysis team to restart these medications in the next few days to goal blood pressure <130/80.
She remained on prophylactic subcutaneous heparin and an H2 blocker.
