Her SBP then decreased to the low 90s, and she was started on aspirin, heparin gtt, dopamine and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, SBP in the low 90s with HR 130s on dopamine 10 mcg/kg/min.
She was diuresed and discharged with furosemide 60 mg [**Hospital1 **] from 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Her isosorbide mononitrate was increased from 30 mg to 60 mg qday.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: none -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: unsuccessful attempts, severe tripple vessel disease in LM, LAD, RCA, LCx; not a candidate for CABG -PACING/ICD: none 3.

At 2300 on [**2133-2-12**], pt had sudden asystole, responded to <1minute of chest compressions.
Several minutes later returned to asystole, was given atropine 1 mg x 1, morphine 2mg, and returned to [**Location **] rhythm.
Given 0.5mg atropine twice, then 1 mg, also given 1mg ativan x 2 for agitation between episodes.
Then was given epi x 1 mg three times.
Pt was started on transcutaneous pacing at 100J at rate of 80.
Attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified at start of event and communicated with throughout the time course.
# CORONARIES: On admission, troponin 1.5, CK 368, MBI 11%, ECG with worsening of STE in inferior leads and new TWI laterally.
Dehydration, as suggested on exam, might have lead to hypoperfusion of coronary arteries, worsening CAD and causing ischemia.
Given her extensive diffuse disease and multiple medical comorbidities, no intervention was undertaken and medical management was optimized, including heparin, aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, and eptifibatide drip.
# Hypotension:  The patient was initially hypotensive requiring dopamine and then phenylephrine.
Pressors were weaned quickly over the first day.
# Urinary tract infection:  The patient had a positive urinalysis and was treated with a dose of gentamicin followed by Bactrim.
# DM2:  NPH was continued along with insulin sliding scale.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Statin was continued.
