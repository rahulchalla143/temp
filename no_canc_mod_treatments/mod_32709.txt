[**2156-9-24**] CHEST (PA & LAT) FINDINGS: Interpretation hindered by technical limitations.
IMPRESSION: Stable right upper lobe opacity representing asymmetric edema versus pneumonia; recommend clinical and radiographic surveillance with repeat of conventional radiographs in 24 hours if still clinically warranted.
Recent BP medication changes in beginning of [**8-24**] included higher dose of metoprolol and initiation of Imdur.
Imdur was discontinued, and her BP meds were held in the setting of hypotension.
Metoprolol and Lisinopril were restarted at low doses when she was called out to the medicine floor.
Her BP remained stable on her new regimen, which was continued at discharge.
Urine culture grew >100,000 gram positive bacteria that likely represents normal flora, however it was decided to treat the patient with a three day course of Bactrim given the high colony count.
She completed the course of antibiotics during her hospital stay and remained asymptomatic.
She was agitated and not at baseline mental status on exam per family and there was concern that recent medication changes may have contributed.
Psychiatry was consulted and she was started back on home Lithium 450mg [**Hospital1 **], Risperdal, and Ambien QHS:PRN.
Psychiatry recommended inpatient psychiatric admission and a section 12 order was placed in her chart.
Clonazepam was initially held due to her hypotension and questionable history of allergy to Diazepam but restarted the evening she was transferred to the floor.
The following morning she continued to be agitated and PRN Risperdal and Clonazepam were added to her regimen per recommendations from psychiatry.
Eventually thorazine was also added as a prn to help control agitation and anxiety.
She will require further psychiatric follow-up following discharge but does not need inpatient psychiatric treatment per the psychiatry team.
Her serum sodium gradually increased to normal during her hospital stay when she was put on her prior lithium dose.
Diabetes: Per faxed insulin regimen from [**Doctor First Name **] group home, she was on ISS and NPH Insulin 46 units Q12H.
She was continued on her home Insulin regimen.
Hyperlipidemia: Continued home regimen of Tricor (Fenofibrate) 48 mg daily and Zocor (Simvastatin) 40 mg daily.
COPD: Continued on Advair diskus 250/50 inhaler, Spiriva, and Symbicort per home regimen.
Lower Extremity Edema: She was on Lsaix 20 mg PO daily for lower extremity edema on admission.
Her Lasix was held initially due to her volume depletion and hypotension on admission.
She was restarted on Lasix 20 mg PO every other day prior to discharge.
Her Neurontin was held early in her admission and she did not complain of right arm pain during her stay.
Pain Control: She was previously prescribed Tramadol 50mg Q6H PRN pain.
