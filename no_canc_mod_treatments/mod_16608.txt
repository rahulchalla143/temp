She suffered a traumatic crush injury of the bilateral lower extremities with an open fracture of her right tibial plateau and right fibula associated with popliteal artery occlusion and severe ischemia of the right lower extremity, as well as an open fracture of her left femoral condyle.
On [**2172-6-15**], the patient presented as a pedestrian struck by an oncoming vehicle with open bilateral tibia/fibula fractures and wounds.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Medications on admission were birth control pills.
Her [**Location (un) 2611**] Coma Scale was 15.
The patient received thoracic spine and lumbar spine films to assess for a spinal injury.
The patient also received a computed tomography scan of her cervical spine without contrast on [**2172-6-15**] to rule out a cervical injury.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of probable ischemic right lower extremity due to a right tibia/fibula fracture as well as a left open fracture of the tibia.
Angiograms were immediately and emergently performed on both lower extremities and a Vascular Surgery consultation was obtained as well as an Orthopaedic Surgery consultation.
The patient was heparinized at this time with an intravenous heparin drip and kept anticoagulated from this time on during her entire hospital stay with the exception of her multiple debridements and washout procedures.
The patient was taken emergently to the operating room on [**6-16**] where the following procedure was performed; an exploration of the distal right popliteal space with a thromboembolectomy of the right popliteal artery as well as reversed saphenous vein interposition graft from the popliteal artery at the knee region to the tibial peroneal trunk of the right leg.
Upon completion of this procedure and placement of the vein graft, distal flow to the right lower extremity was appreciated, and it returned to pink in color over the next immediate period of time was noted.
As previously mentioned, the patient's major orthopaedic injuries included a right tibial plateau fracture and midshaft fibular fracture on the right side, as well as x-rays which showed a fracture of the left femoral condyle.
The following is a list of the procedures performed during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay.
As previously mentioned, on [**6-16**], the exploration of the distal right popliteal space with thromboembolectomy of the right popliteal artery and reversed saphenous vein interposition graft from the popliteal artery at the knee to the tibial peroneal trunk of the right leg.
The patient underwent multiple debridements of the bilateral lower extremity wounds including dressing changes and wound Hemovac sponge changes of the right tibia and left knee.
Orthopaedic Surgery also performed open reduction/external fixation on the right lower extremity placing an external fixator on the right lower extremity.
Subsequently to this procedure, the patient underwent several more washout and debridement procedures of the bilateral lower extremities as well as a split-thickness skin graft on the left and right lower extremity from Plastic Surgery.
On [**2172-6-18**] procedure performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 9694**] which included a debridement of the skin, muscle, and bone of the right leg wound as well as operative treatment with the application of an external fixator to the right leg and application of a vacuum-assisted closure dressing.
Infectious Disease was consulted and recommended 4-week to 6-week treatment with a combination of gentamicin and cefepime antibiotics.
The patient also received a Psychiatry consultation which diagnosed the patient with acute stress disorder and possible episodic delirium secondary to narcotics.
Eventually, she was advanced to a regular diet, and her medications were switched to oral medications.
The patient's heparin drip was kept, and her coagulation studies were checked every day.
During the last several days of her hospital stay she was started on oral Coumadin therapy, and her INR was followed until it became therapeutic for interposition vein graft on the right lower extremity.
During her hospital course, the patient also was seen in consultation by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy who began her on a rehabilitation program as well as an exercise regimen to allow her to start regaining her previous function.
Her medications while in house included the following: Colace, Ativan, Dilaudid through patient-controlled analgesia (for pain control), Vioxx, nortriptyline (for sleep), guaifenesin, gentamicin, cefepime, heparin, and Coumadin.
It should also be noted that before the patient was to be discharged, there remains one final wound vac in the patient's right lower extremity which will be followed up on by Plastic Surgery and needs to removed at a later date to be determined by them (Plastic Surgery).
The patient may also be scheduled for a future left knee repair once the external fixator has been removed, or once the Orthopaedic team decided it is time to proceed with that surgery.
The patient had a peripherally inserted central catheter line placed to allow her to receive her intravenous medications as necessary while staying at the inpatient rehabilitation facility.
The patient was to contact the below listed specialists (including Plastic Surgery, Orthopaedic Surgery, and Vascular Surgery) at the telephone numbers listed below to insure proper followup on her previous surgeries and her future care.
