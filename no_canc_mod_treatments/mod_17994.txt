Admission Date:  [**2145-12-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-12-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-10-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ciprofloxacin / Zometa / Keflex / Tetracycline / erythromycin / Iodine Containing Agents Classifier  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**] Chief Complaint: ventricular tachycardia, ICD generator change  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ICD generator change  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 68 y/o F with PMHx significant for NIICMP (EF5-10%) s/p AICD/BiV pacer, PAF s/p ablation, who presented to OSH on [**2145-12-2**] with worsening DOE, cough, runny nose, diarrhea, fatigue.
Symptoms were initially attributed to CHF exacerbation, and she was treated with lasix.
Given leukocytosis, there was also concern for underlying respiratory infection, for which she was started on doxycycline.
ICD was interrogated at OSH and reported to episodes of device-classified VT (vs. Afib with RVR).
She has been experiencing significant nausea and diarrhea; her doxycycline has been stopped out of concern that it could be contributing to her GI symptoms.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.
ON DISCHARGE: Unchanged except of note: cervical collar no longer in place.
OSH CXR - Cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion (per d/c summary) .
Fracture line through the anterior osteophyte of the inferior endplate of the C4, age-indeterminate.
[**2145-12-4**] CXR - Left dual-lead pacemaker has its leads terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle respectively.
An external pacing wire also is unchanged.

The patient is not on any new QT-prolonging medications (although Sertraline and Zofran have been known to prolong the QT), and only new medication was Doxycycline.
She was treated with IV Lasix.
Of note, the patient also has history of asthma and was recently on a steroid taper; however, her exam did not reveal any wheezing or evidence of asthma exacerbation.
While she was started on Vancomycin and Cefepime empirically at the outside hospital, there did not appear to be any evidence of infection (afbrile and she was without leukocytosis).
We continued her home dosing of Lasix 80 mg PO twice daily.
She was also maintained on her home Advair medication.
We did not feel she warranted antibiotic treatment.
A C.diff was negative at the outside hospital; while her other stool cultures were pending.
She was given IV anti-emetics and her loose stools and nausea steadily improved.
# C-SPINE FRACTURE ON C-SPINE IMAGING - The patient presented with a syncope episode that resulted in a presumed head injury and CT head with C-spine imaging showed evidence of a C4-fracture of unknown chronicity.
They recommended a soft collar while active for 3-months for comfort only.
# PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rate control with beta-blocker; we maintained her on Metoprolol and monitored her via telemtry with electrolyte optimization.
# RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME - We continued Ropinirole at her home dosing.
# DEPRESSION/ANXIETY - We continued Zoloft at her home dosing.
# CHRONIC BACK PAIN - We continued Oxycodone 2.5 mg by mouth in the evenings as needed, which was her home dosing.
