Admission Date:  [**2198-1-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-2-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2150-5-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: anemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IVC filter placement and removal PICC placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 39190**] is a 47 year old female with history of CVA with left residual weakness s/p abdominal hysterectomy due to uterine fibroids on [**2197-12-14**] who presented to [**Hospital6 5016**] with HCT 17 and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2198-1-24**] with a diagnosis of hemolytic anemia.
She underwent abdominal hysterectomy on [**2197-12-14**] without complication and per patient with minimal blood loss.
She was given Decadron, Benadryl, Tylenol, and started on Solu-Medrol prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 69**].
Unclear if any hypercoag work-up, echo ever done; now she has significant weakness on left arm and leg # s/p L3 diskectomy # HTN?
On discharge: White Blood Cells 14.7 Red Blood Cells 1.90 Hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL, Hematocrit 25.7* % Platelet Count 422 K/uL Reticulocyte Count, Manual 24.8* % INR 2.0 Glucose 146* mg/dL, Urea Nitrogen 13 mg/dL Creatinine 0.5 mg/dL, Sodium 134 mEq/L Potassium 3.8 mEq/L, Chloride 98 mEq/L Bicarbonate 26 mEq/L.
Anion Gap 14 mEq/L, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) 34 IU/L, Asparate Aminotransferase (AST) 17 IU/L, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LD) 481* IU/L Alkaline Phosphatase 74 IU/L Bilirubin, Total 0.8 mg/dL Albumin 3.6 g/dL Calcium, Total 8.8 mg/dL Phosphate 3.3 mg/dL Magnesium 2.0 mg/dL .
4) Approximately 4cm left adnexal cyst, which could be evaluated by pelvic ultrasound on a non-emergent basis.
Given the concern of potential warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, the patient was maintained on steroids and received blood transfusions as needed.
The transfusion medicine team evaluated her Coombs test on the 27th and on the 29th, both direct antiglobulin tests were positive originally for anti-IgG in addition to anti-C3 which was later only positive for anti-C3 on 2 subsequent tests.
With regard to the potential causes of this, we feel that it may be secondary to loss of the Rh blood antigen in the setting of a brisk reticulocytosis and recent transfused red cells.
The patient continued to have evidence of hemolysis and therefore in addition to steroids she was treated with rituximab 375 mg/m2, which was given on [**2-7**] and on [**2-12**].
The patient was also started on danazol 200 mg daily, which was started prior to discharge.
She has been maintained on oral prednisone at 60 mg daily in addition to folic acid and danazol.
# ID:  As there was concern for mycoplasma infection due to IgM positivity at outside hospital in addition to an infected family member, she was started on azithromycin.
However, on review of the pathology here it was felt that the marrow was more consistent with increased production of erythroid precursors consistent with hemolytic anemia and NOT consistent with multiple myeloma.
# Pulmonary embolism: On [**1-26**] the patient began to complain of chest pain, worse with inspiration.
She was started on heparin that evening, however due to the finding of possible splenic bleed on abdominal CT, the heparin was stopped temporarily.
Heparin was restarted.
Of note, she was positive for anticardiolipin IgM (16, repeat 14.5 then 12), negative for IgG.
The amount of Protein S antigen was normal, however the amount of functional Protein S was decreased.
Successful IVC removal on AM of [**2-6**].
Heparin was restarted upon her return.
Coumadin was initiated on [**2-7**].
She became therapeutic on coumadin (INR 2.2).
She will continue on coumadin upon discharge.
Based on these results she was restarted on anticoagulation as above.
A beta blocker was started and titrated up to 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
She was given beta blocker early with good response.
She had just completed a unit of PRBC and was given benadryl prior which may have contribued to the tachycardia.
# Hypertension: She was maintained on amlodipine for BP control.
