His medical morbidities included insulin dependent diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus with difficult to control hemoglobin A1c consistently above 8, hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea.
He was thus evaluated and deemed to be a suitable candidate for gastric bypass.
So, plans were made to perform this procedure on [**2140-3-16**].
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post removal of kidney stones in [**2137**], status post varicocele excision in [**2117**], status post appendectomy, status post tonsillectomy.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Glucophage [**2135**] mg q.
AM, Lantus 180 units q.h.s., Humalog sliding scale, Gemfibrozil 600 mg b.i.d., Neurontin 600 mg q.d., Baby Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] was admitted to the hospital on [**2140-3-16**], where he underwent a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass under general endotracheal anesthesia.
He tolerated the procedure well.
He was then extubated in the Operating Room and transferred to the Recovery Room in stable condition in sinus rhythm, however, he had bursts of rapid atrial fibrillation in the Recovery Room requiring multiple doses of intravenous beta blocker.
He was administered Methylene Blue by mouth in the Recovery Room the evening of the operation and this was noted immediately to extravasate into his [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was immediately notified and he was then taken back to the Operating Room for laparoscopic re-exploration.
At the time of the second operation the leak was well contained and an additional drain was then placed in that region.
He also had a gastrostomy tube placed and was again transferred to the Recovery Room/Intensive Care Unit intubated and sedated.
Neurologic - He initially received Fentanyl and Propofol for sedation while he was sedated and these were eventually switched over to oral Roxicet.
Cardiovascular - As stated prior soon after induction of anesthesia for the first procedure, the patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation and over the next 24 hours was in and out of atrial fibrillation.
This was controlled with intravenous beta blockers, however, on postoperative day #1, because of the recurrent nature of the fibrillation he was started on an intravenous Amiodarone drip with bolus.
He was then placed on a Diltiazem drip on postoperative day #2 for better rate control to which he responded quite well.
Per Cardiology recommendations he was started on a heparin drip on postoperative day #4 due to the fact that he was again in and out of atrial fibrillation.
This was continued at a therapeutic dose until it was stopped but not before Coumadin had been started for anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.
He had initially been hypertensive and was placed on Lopressor 150 b.i.d., however, his blood pressure was trending down and his Lopressor thus was decreased to 100 b.i.d.
Of note, he was able to be weaned off of his Diltiazem drip and was then maintained on the Lopressor, however, he again on postoperative day #15, he again had a brief episode of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response which responded to one dose of intravenous Lopressor.
Respiratory - Due to the large volume resuscitation and the patient's history of sleep apnea, he remained intubated on the first postoperative day, however, the decision was made to extubate him.
He was initially stable, however, over the course of the day developed worsening respiratory distress and was weaned and intubated by blind nasotracheal intubation.
After his hemodynamics stabilized, he underwent diuresis and was extubated on postoperative day #8.
He remained stable and did not require reintubation at that time.
He was having fever spikes and a chest x-ray done showed a retrocardiac infiltrate consistent with a ventilator-associated pneumonia for which he was started on Levaquin.
After transfer to the floor, he was encouraged to ambulate with incentive spirometry and chest physical therapy for pulmonary toilet.
He was made NPO, his gastrostomy tube was placed to gravity and he was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics to help control the leak with the hope that it would seal over.
He was also started on gastric feeds by his gastrostomy tube which he tolerated well and these were advanced to a goal of 100 cc/hr.
After his sepsis resolved his tube feeds were weaned down and he was started on a Stage 1 diet which he tolerated well.
He was subsequently advanced to a Stage 3 diet without difficulty.
He currently is tolerating a Stage 3 diet and was A-clamped of the gastrostomy tube, and he is tolerating this well.
He initially had some diarrheal stools, however, his tube feeds were decreased and his ileostomy output decreased as well with that.
Genitourinary - Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] did and continues to make adequate amounts of urine during the hospital course.
He failed a voiding trial while in the Intensive Care Unit, so his Foley catheter was replaced and left in place.
Nephrology was consulted and they suspected contrast-induced nephropathy as the inciting event and recommended discontinuing all nephrotoxic drugs and checking a renal ultrasound.
Of note, due to the large amount of volume given perioperatively, diuresis with intravenous Lasix was initiated, however, that was subsequently discontinued when the rising creatinine was noted.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] was initially NPO, however, he was started on tube feeds on postoperative day #12 at a low dose.
His tube feeds were stopped on [**2140-4-1**] and he is currently tolerating a Stage 3 diet.
Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] initially was placed on the standard subcutaneous heparin, however, his multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation over the hospital course he was heparinized and Coumadin was started for goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5.
He did received some blood transfusions for blood loss anemia of critical illness and otherwise remained stable from a hematologic standpoint.
Infectious disease - He received periopreative antibiotics and after his second exploration with identification of his leak he was started on intravenous Zosyn.
Abdominal computerized tomography scan was done as mentioned before and showed no abscess, however, his chest x-ray did show a retrocardiac density for which he was started on Levofloxacin to which he has completed a 14 day course.
Endocrine - In the immediate postoperative period his blood glucoses were difficult to control requiring an insulin drip and large amounts of daily insulin.
After his tube feeds were weaned down he was able to be discontinued off of his insulin drip and that was maintained on Lantus and a Humalog sliding scale.
SUMMARY:  This is a 52 year old gentleman with morbid obesity, status post laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with a prolonged and complicated hospital course significant for atrial fibrillation, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with insulin-resistance and acute renal failure.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to a rehabilitation facility as continued assessment by physical therapy has deemed this to be the best course for expeditious recovery.
