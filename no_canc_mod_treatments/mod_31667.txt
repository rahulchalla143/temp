Pt should have nitroglycerin at home to take for chest pain.

Also initially started on prednisone.
Given recent hospitalization, fever, and elevated white count coverage for HAP was also initiated with vanc/cefepime and azithromycin for atypical coverage.
Pulmonary service was consulted and recommended further diuresis and to stop the steroids as they felt SOB was more likely due to combination of UTI, lung inflammation/aspiration pneumonia, and/or low EF and MR [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1902**]/ACS.
Pt completed antibiotics on [**7-10**].
She was not discharged on diuretics because of her [**Last Name (un) **], but this may be considered in the future if she has evidence of fluid retention.
Lisinopril was held because of [**Last Name (un) **] but should be restarted once creat < 1.5.
Initially thought pt was over-diuresed and was given fluids without response.
Metoprolol sucinate was uptitrated to 150 mg [**Hospital1 **]  #Afib: Pt had episode of Afib on [**7-4**] treated with ibutilide 1 mg x 1 and converted to sinus.
Afib with RVR likely occured in the setting of acute infarction/respiratory distress.

CHRONIC ISSUES:  #Insomnia - continued trazodone 50 mg po qhs  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:  #Pt will need follow up with primary care and cardiology after discharge.
#Will need blood pressure modifications and possible adjustments given that now only on metoprolol and discontinued home clonidine, nifedipime and lisinopril.
Would recommend lisinopril if additional blood pressure control needed and renal function allows, creat < 1.5.
Is currently on ASA and plavix.
However, did not start Coumadin at this time given that patient had drop in HCT and guaic positive stools.
Should the patient continue to have Afib in the future, can readdress need for coumadin and/or amiodarone.
