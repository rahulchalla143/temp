He was observed for a short while to see how he would do with revascularization; however, the appearance of the right leg did not improve, so he was taken back to the operating room and an above-knee amputation of the right lower extremity was performed to remove all infarcted tissue.
Postoperatively Mr. [**Known lastname 28331**] was kept intubated and transferred to the ICU.
He was started on Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl.
He had several repeated episodes of vtach accompanied by hypotension requiring electrical cardioversion and lidocaine drip.
The lidocaine drip was gradually weaned off, and he was transitioned to PO amiodarone.
Tube feeds were started on POD 4.
On [**2143-11-5**] Mr. [**Known lastname 28331**] was taken back to the OR for closure of his above knee amputation.
Antibiotics were D/C'd and physical therapy was initiated.
His left lower extremity faciotomy wounds required several interrupted horizontal mattress sutures to reclose them, but otherwise his wounds continued to heal well.
