Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2195-7-17**]: Cardiac catherization with placement of bare metal stents to RCA.
[**2195-7-19**]: Cardiac catherization with placement of temporary pacing wire.
[**2195-7-21**]: Removal of pacing wire.
He reports feeling generally fatigued and reports intermittent chest tightness x2 days.
On this admission, his digoxin was discontinued and his atenolol was changed to lopressor.
The patient was administered ASA 325 mg daily, plavix 600 mg daily, glucagon, Zofran, and atropine 0.5 mg for a HR in 40s.
The patient was also ?initially bolused with heparin (5000 units IV) and integrilin (20 mg) in the ED; however, these medications were subsequently discontinued prior to cath as INR was elevated.
Of note, the patient was restrained during procedure because kept touching his groin.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: - Cardiomyopathy, possibly related to EtOH, with EF prior to MI of 51%-->35% post-MI - Diet controlled DM, last hemoglobin A1c 5.7% on [**6-22**] - Atrial fibrillation with tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia on statin - Insomnia - Alcoholism   Social History: Social history is significant for the [**2-11**] PPD tobacco use, down from previously.
ST elevations were present in II, II, and avF with reciprocol depressions in V4-V6 and Q in II, II.
Successful ptca and stenting of the mid and mid-distal RCA with overlapping 2.5x15, 2.5x15 and 2.5x18mm mini vision stents.
A 7-French balloon-tipped temporary pacer was placed successfully in the RV apex.
# Coronary artery disease/Ischemia: Mr. [**Known lastname 20951**] presented with bradycardia and inferior myocardial infarction, and was found to have a mid-occlusion in his right coronary artery.
Two days after his initial catherization, there was concern for new ischemia or re-stenosis based on EKG changes and  he underwent a second cardiac catherization, with placement of a temporary pacing wire.
He was treated with Aspirin, Plavix, simvastatinlace, lisinopril and a beta blocker.
(initially aceburolol but this was changed once pacemkaker pd) .
The patient initially appeared volume overloaded on exam and CXR, and was diuresed with Lasix to good effect.
Pt was discharged on PO lasix 20mg daily .
# Rhythm: Patient had temporary pacing wire placed during catherization on [**7-19**].
The pacing was discontinued on [**7-21**], and his rate without pacing was 70s-80s and in atrial fibrillation.
He therefore had a permanent pacemaker placed on [**2195-7-27**],  Coumadin was reinitiated for target INR of [**3-15**].
Initially he had been on aceburolol for rate control but this was transitioned to Toprol XL once the pacemaker was in place.
In addition, pt was discharged to complete 3 days of keflex for prophylaxis given the pacemaker.
Respiratory status greatly improved with antibiotics and diuresis.
He was continued on an ACE inhibitor for afterload reduction.
# Renal failure: Patient's creatinine at 2.3 on admission, possibly related to contrast during cath.
# Hyperkalemia: Patient had potassium values as high as 5.5, despite being on Lasix.
In addition, his K+ remained elevated off of heparin, hemolysis labs were negative, he was noted to have a normal anion gap, and urine lytes showed appropriate excretion of potassium.
It was felt that he did not require further work-up as an inpatient.
Pts Hct stable and no further intervention done.
CIWA protocol was initiated but the patient did not require Ativan within the withdrawal window.
He was given folic acid and a multivitamin.
# Hypertension: Patient was treated with a beta blocker (metoprol-->acebutolol and subsequently back to toprol as above) and an ACE inhibitor (captopril-->lisinopril).
His home HCTZ and amlodipine were discontinued.
Medications on Admission: - Amlodipine 10mg daily - Metoprolol 75mg [**Hospital1 **] - Folic Acid 1mg daily - HCTZ 25mg daily - Lisinopril 40mg daily - Ranitidine 150mg daily - Simvastatin 10mg daily - Trazodone 400mg QHS - Coumadin 2mg daily - ASA 81mg daily - Vitamin C 500mg daily - Multivitamin daily   Discharge Medications: 1.

Based on findings on your EKG, you were taken for cardiac catherization, and had a stent placed in a blocked artery.
You were monitored in the cardiac intensive care unit, and underwent another cardiac catherization due to persistent symptoms.
A temporary pacing wire helped keep your heart rate up, and then a permanent pacemaker was surgically placed to continue keeping your heart rate up.
