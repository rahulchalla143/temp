She was sent to the ED at [**Location (un) 1110**] and was found to be in a wide complex tachycardia with LBBB morphology, originally thought to be SVT- vagal maneuvers were performed which she responded to.
25 minutes later the WCT recurred and was given metoprolol and amiodarone 150 mg IV.
She then received lidocaine bolus 100 mg with infusion at 2 mg/min without further arrhythmia recurrence.
The amiodarone was discontinued and lidocaine continued after discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6254**].
She was then referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of this presumed ventricular tachycaria and surgical intervention on her aortic valve.
Lidocaine gtt was d/ced upon transfer and metolprolol was given.
A referral to cardiac surgery was made.
DR.[**Doctor Last Name **] recommended tap due to involution of RV (tamponade physiology).
280 cc of bloody fluid was removed and a drain was placed .
The drain was pulled back by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as it was thought to be excessively irritating her pericardium.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema   Past Medical History: --mitral valve prolapse --hyperlipidemia --obesity --aortic stenosis as above --s/p bladder fistula repair --s/p uterine curettage for vaginal bleeding 4 years ago --s/p partial colectomy for fistula   Social History: She has 3 children.
Family History: Per the chart, she has a brother who underwent CABG surgery at age 51.
Physical Exam: GENERAL: Obese, in mild distress due to chest pain from pericardial drain HEENT: NCAT.
Carotid Duplex [**2187-8-9**]:Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
Pt transferred to CCU for close monitoring in setting of RV perforation and pericardial effusion.
The drain was also moved back 5 cm as it was thought to be excessively irritating the pericardium.
There was only 70 cc of fluid drainage overnight and repeat echo did not show re accumulation of fluid.
Cardiac Surgery Course The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2187-8-9**] where the patient underwent Aortic Valve Replacement([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] 25 mm Porcine).
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
Vancomycin was used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.
She required epinephrine drip for a low cardiac output and Lidocaine drip for history of VT which were titrated off POD1 with no further ectopy.
Beta blocker was initiated.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD #4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
