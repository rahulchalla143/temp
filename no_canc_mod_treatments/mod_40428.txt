During that admission, she was placed on CPAP, had blood pressure control with a nitroglycerin gtt initally and had extra HD/UF sessions.
She was started on a nitroglycerin gtt.
She received lasix 100 mg x1 to which she urinated ~80cc.
She received 1 dose of ceftriaxone and was prescribed 1 dose of levofloxacin.
Past Medical History: - Diastolic CHF with LVOT obstruction at rest - Chronic 2L NC at night - Hypertension - Diabetes - Peripheral vascular disease status post bilateral knee amputations in [**2146**] (L) and [**2157**] (R) - GERD - Hypercholesterolemia - ESRD on hemodialysis M,W,F.
Receives dialysis at [**Location (un) **] hemodialysis center in [**Location (un) **].
Her family history is significant for coronary artery disease, cancer, and diabetes.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):   Brief Hospital Course: 73 year old woman with hx of diastolic CHF, DM2, ESRD on HD presenting with acute hypoxia and hypertensive urgency .
As she was hypertensive to the 200s systolic and reported palpitations prior to admission, both htn and perhaps a.fib with RVR caused worsening of her pulmonary edema on presentation.
She does have hyperinflated lungs on CXR and was mildly bronchospastic on admission, so she was started on azithromycin, spireva, and albuterol nebs.
Additionally, as she is on 2L O2 via nasal cannula at night (prescribed by outside MD), she should have outpatient sleep study.
# Leukocytosis:  All cell lines were up on presentation however this was pre HD/UF so unlikely due entirely to hemoconcentration.
As she was initially mildly bronchospastic on exam, she was started on azithromycin x 5 day course.
She was started on spireva and albuterol nebs as well as azithromycin and her exam improved markedly.
She has not been receiving epogen at HD session per renal as her hgb has been > goal.
Renal U/S was negative for mass suggestive of erythropoietin producing mass.
# End-stage renal disease: She was continued on her home phos binder and nephrocaps and was continued on HD qMWF as per her normal schedule.
Thus, she was advised not to take her dose of coumadin on [**6-1**].
She was continued on metoprolol and coumadin.
# HTN:  She was briefly on nitro gtt upon arrival to the ICU given SBPs in the 200s.
She was, however, quickly titrated off and post HD, SBPs were stable in the 120-140s range on metoprolol alone.
# Diabetes mellitus type 2 with complication of nephropathy: She was continued on her home dose NPH with sliding scale coverage.
# Hypercholesterolemia:  She was continued on her outpatient dose simvastatin.
# GERD:  She was continued on outpatient ranitidine.
