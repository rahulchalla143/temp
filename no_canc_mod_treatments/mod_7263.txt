HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old woman with congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of 20% to 25%), chronic atrial fibrillation, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, severe peripheral vascular disease (with several right lower extremity bypass surgeries) who was recently admitted to the Vascular Service at the [**Hospital1 69**] for worsening right lower extremity ischemia that was treated conservatively with antibiotics (Zosyn), dressing changes, and pain management.
Cardiology Service followed the patient and adjusted medications for volume overload and blood pressure management.
The patient was discharged to rehabilitation on [**11-2**] with an amputation scheduled for [**11-20**] at [**Hospital1 69**].
The patient received Lasix 40 mg intravenously times one and was started on intravenous levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
with plans to initiate Flagyl as well.
At approximately 1:30 in the morning, the patient was started on Levophed 2 mcg/min with an increase in blood pressure to 99/65.
The patient's heart rate was noted to become elevated into the 150s in the Emergency Department; and, therefore, intravenous Cardizem 5 mg was given times two with a decrease in heart rate to the 120s to 130s.
She denied any chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dysuria.
Right femoral-popliteal bypass times five.
Right common femoral artery to anterior tibialis with vein angioplasty and jump graft in [**2138-7-18**].
Balloon angioplasty and proximal anastomosis in [**2139-7-18**].
Lasix 40 mg p.o.
Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Pravastatin 20 mg p.o.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Coumadin 1 mg p.o.
At home, the patient was on Coumadin 3 mg on odd days alternating with 2 mg on even days.
Darvocet N-100 one tablet p.o.
Bacitracin ointment to ulcer area.
Metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
Ativan 0.5 mg p.o.
Lower extremity edema of 1+ up to the knees bilaterally and dry gangrene over the right foot and lower extremity.
The patient was started on Levophed initially and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was also started on broad spectrum antibiotics given the possible diagnosis of sepsis secondary to pneumonia and a right gangrenous leg.
Initially, the patient was given normal saline fluid boluses to help increase her urine output; which, by hospital day five, had decreased less than 15 cc per hour.
However, there was minimal responsiveness to these normal saline intravenous fluid boluses.
The decision was made to determine intracardiac filling pressures by placing a Swan-Ganz catheter on [**2140-11-23**].
Unfortunately, the catheter was unable to wedge; and, therefore, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were unable to be obtained.
The catheter readings did show a cardiac index of 0.8 to 1.1, and a central venous pressure of 12 to 16, and elevated pulmonary artery pressures of 50/20, and a systemic vascular resistance of 2424 to 3677.
A trial of diuresis was given with Lasix with a good response in urine output.
However, on [**11-27**], diuresis had to be held since the patient's systolic blood pressure became borderline hypotensive at 96.
The patient initially was loaded with digoxin; however, upon further discussion with the patient's cardiologist (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]), it was noted that the patient often times become bradycardic on digoxin and diltiazem.
As a result, the patient was started on Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl.
The patient was then changed from cefepime to ceftriaxone once the patient was transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit.
Therefore, a thoracentesis was not done for diagnostic purposes in the patient.
However, since thoracentesis could not be pursued in this patient, there was no reason to pursue a further workup of malignancy.
ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:  The patient was continued on a regular insulin sliding-scale, and her fingersticks were checked on a q.i.d.
A right upper extremity ultrasound was performed in order to rule out a diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis; the results of which were pending at the time of this dictation.
It appeared that the patient and the patient's family did not wish to proceed with any invasive measures; and for now the Medicine Service will offer supportive care and all measures for comfort.
