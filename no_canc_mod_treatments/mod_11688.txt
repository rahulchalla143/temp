Admission Date:  [**2126-11-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2126-11-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2056-8-27**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old male transferred from [**Hospital3 23439**] Hospital, where he was admitted on [**2126-11-7**] with chest pain.
The patient was started on heparin and nitroglycerin at the outside hospital and was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for cardiac catheterization for a non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy status post transurethral resection of prostate.
Status post bilateral total hip replacements.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  NPH 30 units q.a.m.
and 15 units q.p.m., bupropion, Detrol, Lopressor 50 mg, Tiazac 120 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, simvastatin 10 mg, Zantac 150 mg p.o.b.i.d., trazodone 100 mg, vitamin E, B12, and Celexa 40 mg.
Troponin peaked at 149 at the outside hospital, unclear what this correlates to on our scale.
The patient was placed on aspirin and intravenous heparin.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted from the catheterization laboratory.
The patient was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery and was taken for coronary artery bypass grafting initially intended to be on [**2126-11-12**].
Unfortunately, during the preoperative preparations, the patient was unable to have a Foley inserted.
On [**2126-11-14**], the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times four with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the diagonal one.
The patient did well with this procedure and was transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, ultimately going to the floor under the cardiothoracic surgery service.
He had had a brief episode of atrial fibrillation one day prior, which was treated successfully with Lopressor and amiodarone.
Given this and his slightly low blood pressure compared to baseline, the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit service and had a cardioversion in the Coronary Care Unit with 200 joules times one.
The repeat catheterization showed diffusely diseased left main, a diffusely diseased, 70%, left anterior descending artery after the large competitive flow in distal left anterior descending artery and diagonal, left circumflex with 70% ostial stenosis with severe diffuse disease and competitive flow in obtuse marginal, totally occluded right coronary artery in the mid-portion, saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery 90% aorto-ostial stenosis with a TIMI-II flow, saphenous vein graft to diagonal patent with mild kinking in mid-portion, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 30% ostial, left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery mild kinking in mid-graft and near anastomosis.
The patient ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement at the saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery with TIMI-III flow.
He was placed on aspirin and Plavix and sent back to the Coronary Care Unit.
The patient continued to do well following this intervention.
He did not have any recurrent atrial fibrillation and his rate was controlled on amiodarone in addition to low dose Lopressor 12.5 mg twice a day.
The patient had his sheaths pulled and was ultimately discovered to have a right groin bruit.
The patient was placed on an amiodarone drip intermittently, which was ultimately switched over to oral amiodarone, especially in the setting of a low left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%.
The patient has a known left ventricular ejection fraction of 15% and was subsequently placed on afterload reduction with Captopril which he had been on previously.
The patient was diuresed with Lasix as needed and responded well.
He is currently on two liters of oxygen, saturating 98%.
The patient was successfully treated with intravenous Lopressor and an increased dose of oral Lopressor in an effort to rate control him.
It was decided at this time to proceed with medical management as it was unclear whether this was an ischemic mediated event.
He was subsequently placed on Lopressor 12.5 mg orally twice a day, increasing to 25 mg twice a day on [**2126-11-22**].
The patient underwent a stress thallium with pharmacologic stress in the setting of Persantine.
The patient was ultimately treated with medical therapy.
At this time, the patient is on aspirin 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Lopressor 25 mg twice a day, Captopril 12.5 mg three times a day and simvastatin 10 mg at bedtime.
Endocrine:  The patient has diabetes mellitus, controlled with NPH insulin.
The patient was briefly on an insulin drip postoperatively in an effort to decrease the incidence of mediastinitis.
The patient's blood sugars were well controlled on the insulin drip.
Urology:  The patient had a urethrotomy on the operating table in the setting of difficulty placing a Foley.
The patient was on Levaquin prophylaxis while the Foley was in place.
On [**2126-11-22**], the patient is having his Foley discontinued and having a voiding trial.
If the patient does not void or has a postvoid residual greater than 300 cc, he will have a Foley in place and will be discharged to rehabilitation or home with a Foley in anticipation of a voiding trial in the future.
Cardiac catheterization with balloon angioplasty and stenting of a saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery lesion.
