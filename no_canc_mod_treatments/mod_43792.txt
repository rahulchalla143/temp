NG lavage was performed and clear.
He was treated with a Protonix drip, transitioned to IV bid.
The GI team was consulted, and there was some concern that he might need to be intubated for the procedure given his history of interstitial lung disease (complicated by recent ARDS at OSH and high O2 requirement).
Plavix and aspirin were held given bleeding, and GI felt that he would be at high risk for rebleed with Plavix given no definitive intervention was done.
His need for Plavix was discussed with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] he was determined to no longer need this medication.
He was restarted on 81mg of aspirin daily prior to discharge and transitioned to twice daily oral PPI.

As mentioned above, his plavix was completely stopped but he was restarted on 81mg of aspirin daily prior to discharge.
Diabetes type II: He is on metformin and januvia as an outpatient, but these had been held in the setting of variable po intake.
