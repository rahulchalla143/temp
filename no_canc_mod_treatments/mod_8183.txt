She had a routine MRI of abdomen performed yesterday to evaluate for progression of liver disease which showed a cirrhotic, heterogeneous liver with multiple hypoenhancing nodules, similar in appearance to past scans.
She had been admitted earlier this month for work up of lethargy, fatigue, elevated lactate (5.4 down to 1.9), and ARF, thought to be due to acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of hypovolemia from decreased PO intake and recent addition of diuretics to her medication regimen.
On that admission, received 1 unit of pRBC for hct of 21.4. .
Patient was bolused with IV fluids and tranfused 2 units of pRBCs.
Per hepatology service IV pantoprazole and octreotide drips were initiated.
Hepatitis C status post failed treatments with interferon and ribavarin.
She underwent an MRI after that on [**2103-11-9**] that showed good response to treatment of three lesions in segment II, VII, and VIII and no enhancement seen in those lesions, there are no new arterially enhancing lesions and the spleen was enlarged, pancreas and adrenals are unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course: 61yoF with h/o HCV c/b ESLD and HCC s/p multiple TACE admitted for hematemesis [**2-7**] UGIB.
Patient was started on pantopraole and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleed and started on prophylatic ceftriaxone for SBP in setting of GI bleed.
Patient underwent intubation and EGD per hepatology where bleeding varices were found and banded.
Her initial hct was 21.6, and it came up to 23.3 after 2 units of RBCs, so pt received additional RBCs.
She completed 5 days of IV Ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis.
She was discharged home on nadolol and pantoprazole, carafate.
# Cirrhosis c/b ascites, encephalopathy, HCC: patient was restarted on lactulose after she was extubated.
Her aldactone and lasix were initially held in the ICU in setting of acute GI bleed and then restarted on discharge.
# Elevate Lactate: Pt had elevated lactate on admission, likely representing poor perfusion of tissues in setting of poor clearance by liver in addition to hypovolemia [**2-7**] GIB.
Pt was resuscitated with pRBCs and her lactate trended down and was wnl on discharge.
# ARF: Creatinine 1.5 on admission (up from baseline 1.0-1.2), likely pre-renal [**2-7**] hypovolemia in setting of GIB as above.
Creatinine normalized after volume resuscitation with RBCs.
# Hyperkalemia: Pt with K of 6.3 in ED, no EKG changes, likely [**2-7**] [**Last Name (un) **] as well as K-sparing diuretic.
Resolved with kayexalate, potassium remained stable for remainder of hospitalization.
# HTN: Pt's home metoprolol was discontinued due to starting nadolol for variceal bleed.
