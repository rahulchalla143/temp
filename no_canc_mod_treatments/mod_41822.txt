- HOLTER (45 HOURS, [**2177-5-13**]): IMPRESSIONS: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. [**Known lastname 111653**] is a 80 F with a history of atrial fibrillation with tachy-brady syndrome documented by Lifewatch monitor who was admitted for pacemake placement; procedure was complicated by pneumothorax following subclavian access.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # PNEUMOTHORAX: Pt admitted for pacemaker placement that was complicated by pneumothorax, initially noted on fluoroscopy following air in syringe with attempted subclavian vein access.
Pt was attempted on 100% oxygen to assist in resorption of the pneumothorax, however given interval increase in volume, thoracic surgery placed pigtail catheter with interval resolution of pneumothorax within 24 hours.
# TACHY-BRADY SYNDROME S/P PACEMAKER: Pacemaker placement was complicated by pneumothorax.
Therefore, the decision was made to change pacer settings to DDI.
She was maintained on her home medications metoprolol succ 100 daily and verapamil ER 240mg daily.
She will need to take cephalexin 500mg x 5 days for prophylaxis post-procedure.
During hospitalization, pt remained in a fib and was managed on her home medications of verapamil ER 240 mg PO daily, metoprolol succinate 100 mg PO daily, and warfarin 2.5/3.75 mg PO daily.
She will be continued on warfarin for one month and then plan on chemical conversion with amiodarone.
# HYPERTENSION: Pt remained normotensive during hospitalization and was maintained on home medications: metoprolol succinate 100 mg PO daily, verapamil ER 240 mg PO daily .
# FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN: Patient has had recurrent fevers for several months, though work-up to date has been unrevealing (negative CT torso, negative TEE, cultures negative, s/p empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics).
She has a 5 day course of antibiotics to complete.

You were admitted after your pacemaker placement because of a pneumothorax (small leakage of air) in your left lung.
Thorax surgery was consulted and placed a pigtail catheter to remove the air.
Your pacemaker was adjusted appropriately and you recovered well from the procedure.
You will be discharged with a 5 day course of antibiotics and scheduled to follow up with cardiology and device clinic.
The following changes were made to your medication regimen: 1. please start taking cephelexin for 5 days 2. please take oxycodone and/or tylenol as needed for pain 3. please take docusate and/or senna as needed for constipation, which may be a side effect of the oxycodone.
