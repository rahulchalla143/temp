[**11-20**]: proBNP-[**Numeric Identifier 15280**]  CXR [**11-20**]: Upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.
Calcification is noted of the carotid siphons and vertebral arteries bilaterally.
MRV shows medial portion of the right transverse sinus to be narrowed without corresponding signal abnormality on FLAIR and T2-weighted images.
If there is continued clinical concern, CT venography of the head could help for further assessment.
[**11-24**] MRI/MRA The examination was ordered as gadolinium-enhanced images but after consultation with the MRI technologist, it was decided that gadolinium would not be administered given patient's low EGFR.
However, gadolinium injection was performed inadvertently.
The patient was arranged to have dialysis within 24 hours.
There is normal flow enhancement identified in this region on post-gadolinium images and there is no evidence of thrombosis seen.
Impression: Right ICA with stenosis <40%.
Left ICA with stenosis <40%.
# Altered Mental Status: The patient was seen by psych and neuro and altered mental was untimately attributed to a toxic metabolic state given her hyperglycemia and uremia.
LP was not concerning for infection however she was treated with acyclovir until viral cultures were resulted.
She had an insulin drip that was titrated to a insulin sliding scale.
We administered IV lopressor and hydralazine until her mental status improved and she was able to take her home regimen.
Her valsartan was ultimately uptitrated given poor BP control while on the floor.
She also had an elevated BNP and showed fluid overload on exam therefore underwent routine HD.
She also required extra hemodialysis sesions for inadvertent exposure to gad during MRI.
It was repeated after dialysis and showed resolution of symptoms .
