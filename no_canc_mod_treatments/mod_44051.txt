As detailed in the admission H+P, the patient was treated with Tamiflu, Vancomycin, and Levofloxacin.
The patient responded well to treatment and did not require pressors or intubation.
Antibiotics were tailored to levofloxacin and Tamiflu only and the patient was transferred to the floor for ongoing management.
On transfer to the floor the patient had a 4L NC oxygen requirement, likely secondary to her underlying pneumonia as well as mild fluid overload from aggressive fluid support.
Her O2 requirement resolved over the course of two days with ongoing supportive therapy as well as auto-diuresis.
The patient walked with physical therapy and was cleared for discharge without additional PT needed.
The patient was discharged with 1 additional day of Tamiflu therapy and prescription to complete a 7 day course of levofloxacin.
Anemia: The patient was admitted to Hct of 35.1 with drop to 27.0 after aggressive volume resuscitation.
The patient's Hct stabilized with termination of volume resuscitation and auto-diuresis with Hct on discharge 32.6. .
HTN: Given hypotension on admission the patient's outpatient antihypertensive regimen of lisinopril and HCTZ were initially held.
With resolution of her hypotension the patient's outpatient regimen was reintroduced and she was discharged with the same.
