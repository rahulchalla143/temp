HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old white male with coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarctions, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting x 4, with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, who had a left femoral-tibial bypass graft in [**2128-12-12**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], of podiatry, did a left Charcot foot reconstruction following bypass graft.
The patient sustained a third-degree burn to the posterior right leg after using a heating pad approximately seven to 10 days prior to admission.
Coronary artery disease:  Myocardial infarction in [**2122**], [**2123**]; status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty; status post coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 in [**2128-9-12**].
Diabetes mellitus since age 25:  With triopathy; status post laser treatment OU; and Charcot joint deformities.
CABG x 4 with right leg vein [**2128-9-29**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**].
Left common femoral to posterior tibial artery in situ saphenous vein graft on [**2128-12-15**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
[**Name (NI) **] uses a walker to ambulate at home.

Intervention conduction defect.
Normal saline wet-to-dry dressings of his right foot were started.
His posterior eschar secondary to burn was treated with Adaptic and saline-moistened dressing b.i.d.
He was started on a renal dose of levofloxacin - 250 mg p.o.
and 500 mg of Flagyl p.o.
Coumadin was held prior to angiogram.
IV heparin was to be started if the INR was less than 2.
No further cardiac studies were necessary and the patient was cleared for bypass graft surgery.
Vancomycin was added to levofloxacin and Flagyl.
The podiatry service also followed the patient and recommended saline dressing b.i.d.
The gastroenterology service felt that the elevated liver function tests could be due to levofloxacin or the patient's amiodarone.
Levofloxacin and Flagyl were stopped.
Vancomycin was continued.
He was treated with IV Lasix initially with improvement.
He was started on a nitroglycerin drip to manage his blood pressure.
The patient had received preangiography IV hydration as well as fresh frozen plasma and his congestive heart failure was felt to be secondary to volume overload per the cardiology service.
Medications were adjusted to manage his blood pressure.
The patient initially was scheduled for surgery on [**2129-5-6**] but his renal function deteriorated.
After evaluation the renal service determined that the patient's deteriorating renal function was due to contrast dye nephropathy.
He was diuresed with IV Lasix and Zaroxolyn.
Possible need for hemodialysis was discussed.
Cardiology agreed with stopping amiodarone secondary to elevated liver function tests.
Preliminary plan was to send the patient for a [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation stay and then return to have right leg bypass graft surgery.
The renal service cleared the patient for surgery when his creatinine went below 3, i.e.
Iron supplementation was started.
The patient had previously scheduled ultrasound graft surveillance of his left bypass graft on [**2129-5-16**], which showed a patent graft with no evidence of narrowing.
On [**2129-5-19**] the patient underwent a right popliteal to dorsalis pedis bypass graft with composite right arm vein.
The patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma.
On [**2129-5-24**] the patient underwent debridement of the eschar on his right posterior leg under monitored anesthesia care.
The renal service made adjustments in the patient's blood pressure medications with good results.
The podiatry service recommended packing the right lateral foot ulcer with saline gauze t.i.d.
dressing followed by a split-thickness skin graft at a later date would be necessary.
However, the wound was granulating well following bypass graft surgery and debridement.
They recommended saline dressings wet-to-dry t.i.d.
On [**2129-5-27**] the patient had a PICC line placed in his left arm for IV antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and Zosyn for at least two more weeks while the right leg wound was granulating.
The renal service adjusted his medications with a systolic blood pressure goal of 150 to 160.
