MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 81 q.d., Aldactone 25 q.d., beta paced 80 b.i.d., Lanoxin .125 q.d., Lasix 40 q.d., Lipitor 40 q.d., Lopressor 25 b.i.d., Zestril 5 q.d., Indocin prn.
Xanax .5 q.h.s.
prn, Xydone 325 prn, Doryx 100, Medrol 4 prn.
Sating 98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Pacer wire in position.
Ischemia:  The patient with a history of coronary artery disease status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2173**] given new onset of complete heart block, although the patient had no electrocardiogram changes consistent with ischemia.
He will need an outpatient stress test at some point to determine if there is any new inducible ischemia after his previous coronary artery bypass graft.
He was on Dopamine at the outside hospital, however, did not require pressor support during this stay.
The patient was then restarted on his Lopressor and eventually was restarted on his Cozaar and Betapace as well.
Digoxin was discontinued.
The patient's potassium and creatinine corrected.
Temporary pacing wire was pulled after 48 hours and the patient was restarted on his Betapace.
Baseline creatinine unknown, but per wife was abnormal.
Renal toxic medications such as Indocin, Aldactone, Zestril and Digoxin were held.
Given the patient's anxiety and claustrophia he denied an MRI.
Phena was less then .3 indicating a prerenal picture again with cessation of renal toxin medications and gentle fluids, the patient's creatinine improved to baseline at 1.0.
FEN:  Patient was admitted with a potassium of 8.0 likely secondary to recently starting Aldactone, using Indocin for gout and worsening renal function.
Also the patient was supplementing with po potassium in the presence of an ace inhibitor.
The patient's potassium, Zestril, Aldactone and Indocin were held as the creatinine improved.
