Blood cultures showed Streptococcus aglacticae, CSF cultures were negative, though protein and glucose levels were c/w meningitis.
He was initially started ABx w/ vanc/CTX/Amp/Acyclovir was eventually changed to Ampicillin with a tentative goal of 2 weeks of therapy.
while sitting in bed, for which he was quickly defibrillated back to SR, received amiodarone 300mg bolus followed by amiodarone drip.
A triple lumen catheter placed in the right femoral artery and he was transferred to the ICU for further management.
His blood pressure stabilized with IV fluids.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for futhter management of his VF arrest.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, moist mucus membranes NECK: Supple with no JVD CARDIAC: RRR S1 S2, no S3 or S4, no murmur LUNGS: Unlabored work of breathing, no accessory muscle use, no cough, lungs CTAB, no wheezes, rhonchi, or crackles ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND, +BS x 4 quadrants, no HSM, no CVA tenderness EXTREMITIES: Warm, no edema, radial, DP, and PT pulses 2+ bilaterally SKIN: ICD dressing to left anterior chest C/D/I.
Right brachial PICC and left hand PIV without erythema or inflammation.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %) with inferior, septal, anterior and apical hypokinesis.
Heterogeneous bone marrow could be related to marrow hyperplasia from anemia, but clinical correlation is also recommended to exclude marrow infiltrative process.
Severely increased left ventricular mass index with maximal basal anteroseptal wall thickness of 21 mm.
Correlate with prior abdominal imaging if available.
[**4-1**] CXR: PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained on [**2200-3-31**].

# Ventricular fibrillation: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] following an OSH Vfib arrest while being treated for GBS meningitis.
He was initially loaded on amiodarone, and this medication was subsequently discontinued.
It was felt that the most likely etiology of his arrythmia was LBB re-entrant tachycardia, though no arrythmia was induced while in the electrophysiology lab on [**2200-3-27**].
The patient underwent a cardiac MRI and ICD placement on [**2200-3-31**].
# Bacteremia: Blood culture from OSH was positive for Streptococcus aglacticae which was sensitive to Ampicillin and ceftriaxone.
He did require some gentle diuresis but was otherwise euvolemic.
He was continued on his ACE-I and beta-blocker.
# HTN:   Continued on carvedilol and lisinopril.
# HLD:  The patient's simvastatin was initially held given transaminitis.
Simvastatin was initially held, and LFTs continued to normalize after this medication was restarted.
# Lower-back pain:  Ongoing since pre-hospitalization, possibly exacerbated by discitis, well-controlled with prn Oxycodone and Acetaminophen .
# Buttock ulcerations:  At home, the patient was treated with hot packs, and developed several ulcerations on his buttock.
Wound care was consulted, and recommended routine wound care.
================================== Transitional issues- -Consider Spironolactone initiation given depressed LVEF.
-Pull PICC line after completion of antibiotic course on [**2200-5-1**] -Continue work-up / follow-up of stable anemia, consider age-appropriate malignancy screening.
-Renal cyst noted on cardiac MRI, further work-up may be indicated -Monitor buttock ulcerations for improvement, consider work-up if more lesions develop  Medications on Admission: Home medications: - Lisinopril 5mg QD PO - Carvedilol 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **] PO - Simvastatin 20mg QD PO  Discharge Medications: 1. lisinopril 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
2. simvastatin 10 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
3. carvedilol 12.5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
4. ceftriaxone in dextrose,iso-os 2 gram/50 mL Piggyback Sig: One (1) 2 grams Intravenous once a day for 5 weeks: last day is [**2200-5-1**].
Heparin Flush (10 units/ml) 2 mL IV PRN line flush PICC, heparin dependent: Flush with 10mL Normal Saline followed by Heparin as above daily and PRN per lumen.
6. ceftriaxone in dextrose,iso-os 2 gram/50 mL Piggyback Sig: One (1) bag Intravenous Q24H (every 24 hours) for 5 weeks: Last Day [**2200-5-1**].
7. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain.
You were stablized and then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2200-3-25**] for further management of this irregular heart rhythm.
Several different studies were done on your heart here at the hospital, and it was decided that a pacemaker with a defibrilator should be placed to help keep your heart beating at a normal rate and rhythm.
Your heart is a bit weaker than before your admission, but the medications will help.
Some of your home medications were changed to better help your heart and control your blood pressure.
Finally, you will need to continue your IV antibiotic, Ceftriaxone, so that you receive a total of six weeks of treatment for the meningitis.
