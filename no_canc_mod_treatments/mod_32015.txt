Admission Date:  [**2173-2-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-3-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-2-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5119**] Chief Complaint: Seizures, aphasia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation/Mechanical Ventilation   History of Present Illness: 66 yo M with a remote hx of EEE resulting in a seizure disorder and EtOH use, transferred to medicine from neurology for management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
On arrival to [**Hospital3 **], he was noted to be in status epilepticus with subtherapeutic dilantin level, so he was intubated, loaded with dilantin, given IV valium, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] neurology ICU service.
Cardiology was consulted and thought NSTEMI due to demand ischemia likely related to peri-intubation hypotension (transiently required neo gtt in ICU).
Patient on heparin from [**Date range (1) 80701**] and continued on cardioprotective medication.
Also noted to have a PNA (fevers, leukocytosis, and RLL consolidation), started on Vancomycin and Zosyn on [**2-19**] at OSH, which have been continued to date.
Received 1 dose of solumedrol for wheezing on [**2-23**].
Med/[**Female First Name (un) 1634**] consult called for management of respiratory issues on [**2-24**], noted to be volume overloaded/with crackles on exam after getting maitenence fluids o/n.
When evaluated by the primary team on the floor this afternoon, patient's breathing continued to be quite tachypneic/using accessory muscle to breathe despite being on 5 L O2 and 2 doses of lasix 40 mg IV, ipratroprium nebs, with -1 L diuresis in one hour.
Patient also appeared slightly more confused, pulling off oxygen mask frequently during nebulizer treatment and insisting a 'cap' was on the floor, although nothing was noted on the floor.
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: VS: 97.6 110/80 76 28 95-97% on 5 L NC BS 105 GA: middle aged M lying in bed, labored breathing, AOx2 (knows name and date) HEENT: PERRLA.
Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.
~ [**2173-2-20**]: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube has been removed.
Left subclavian line tip projects over the junction of brachiocephalic veins.
Intubated and admitted to the Neuro ICU service.
Hospital course complicated by an NSTEMI resulting in depressed LV ejection fraction, ventilator associated pneumonia treated with 8 day course of Vancomycin and Zosyn, and hypoxic respiratory distress due to volume overload from depressed LV ejection fraction.
He received on dose of IV haldol 2mg and improved.
His mental status exam eventually improved, and his seizure medications were changed to keppra 1500 mg PO BID, dilantin 300 mg PO QHS (with therapeutic dilantin levels), and klonopin 1.5 mg PO QHS on discharge.
# Hypoxia: Patient became acute hypoxic on the floor after being called out from the ICU, presumably in the setting of continous IVFs and decreased LV ejection fraction of 30%.
He was transferred to the MICU after remaining on the floor for 6 hours due to concern for hypoxic respiratory distress and aggressively diuresed with IV lasix and treated with standing nebulizers.
Continued beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor.
Continued albuterol and ipratroprum nebs as needed.
# Ventilator associated pneumonia: Patient noted to have leukocytosis and left lower lobe infiltrate on CXR, likely VAP versus aspiration PNA during seizures 9Could not distinguish between the two).
Unable to obtain speciation on sputum culture, so treated with 8 day course of Vancomycin and Zosyn.
Kept on aspiration precautions and diet per speech and swallow recommendations.
# NSTEMI: Patient suffered an NSTEMI likely due to demand ischemia (hypotensive and tachycardic in the neuro ICU after intubation requiring transient neosynephrine gtt) versus Takatsubo/stress cardiomyopathy.
Patient was diuresed and treated with beta blocker and afterload reduced with ACE-inhibitor.

In the course of your hospital stay, you suffered a heart attack that damaged the pumping function of your heart, a pneumonia that was treated with antibiotics, and volume overload and difficulty breathing.
Due a possible TB exposure, you were also ruled out for TB with 3 sets of sputums that were negative for TB on special stains.
You were satting well on room air off of oxygen on discharge.
Please take your medications as directed.
You were started on oral lasix 40 mg by mouth daily.
