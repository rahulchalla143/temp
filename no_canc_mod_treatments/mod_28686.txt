HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female hospitalized in [**Month (only) 216**] of this year for right foot ischemia, who underwent a diagnostic arteriogram with Perclose groin closure and right leg runoff for HIT induced thrombocytopenia with right foot embolus.
The study demonstrated right SFA popliteal disease with single-vessel runoff via the peroneal artery.
She is now admitted for IV antibiotics and consideration for revascularization of the right lower extremity.
MEDICATIONS:  Include levothyroxine 75 mcg daily, Lopressor XL 75 mg daily, __________ 10 mg daily, calcium 1000 mg t.i.d., multivitamin capsule daily, Coumadin 2 mg Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and 1 mg Tuesday, Tuesday, Saturday, Sunday, aspirin 81 mg daily, Protonix 40 mg daily, senna tablets 8.6 mg twice a day, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., oxycodone 2.5 mg q.8h.
ILLNESSES:  Include endstage renal disease, stage V, on dialysis Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays; status post right IJ PermCath in [**2141-8-9**]; history of coronary artery disease with a non-ST elevated MI; history of peripheral vascular disease; history of hypertension; history of anemia of renal disease; history of osteodystrophy; history of hypothyroidism; history of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Wound cultures were obtained and she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy of vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl.
Renal was consulted for hemodialysis and the patient was continued on her preadmission schedule for Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
A long discussion was held with the family, amputation versus bypass, given the patient had poor outflow and questionable graft patency, was presented to the family.
Her medications were adjusted to improve her blood pressure and heart rate for a goal of systolic pressure of 120-140 and a pulse rate of 60 or less.
The cellulitis improved and edema improved with antibiotics and bedrest.
The patient underwent on [**2141-9-26**], a right fem-DP bypass graft in situ saphenous vein angioscopy.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated and transferred to the PACU in stable condition.
The patient returned to the OR and underwent a thrombectomy of the right femoral DP bypass x2.
The graft pulse was marginal after the second surgery and decision was made if the graft failed that no further surgical intervention would be attempted.
The patient remained intubated overnight and in the PACU.
The patient was weaned off Neo-Synephrine for systolic blood pressure control.
She underwent hemodialysis and then was attempted at extubation.
She was continued on triple antibiotics with vanco, Cipro, and Flagyl.
We will continue to follow the patient for her hemodialysis needs.
She was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 26.
She was given aspirin and nitroglycerin with relief of her symptoms.
The patient remained on argatroban for her history of heparin allergy.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Include levothyroxine 75 mg daily, __________ 10 mg daily, calcium carbonate 1000 mg t.i.d., Niferex capsule 1 daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 solution [**5-18**] mL q.4h.
for pain, Protonix 40 mg daily, senna tablets 8.6 mg b.i.d., metoprolol 75 mg t.i.d., warfarin 2 mg Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and 1 mg Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, lisinopril was started for her systolic hypertension at 5 mg daily.
She should continue her Coumadin for history of thrombus and heparin allergy and take as directed.
She should follow up with her primary care physician for monitoring of her INR and adjustment of her Coumadin dosing as required.
Please continue to take the stool softener, Colace, as directed while you are taking pain medication since pain meds can cause constipation.
History of endstage renal disease, stage V, on dialysis     Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.
10.History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia,     postoperative blood loss anemia, transfused.
MAJOR SURGICAL PROCEDURES:  Right femoral-dorsalis pedis bypass in situ saphenous vein with thrombectomy of the right femoral-dorsalis pedis graft x2 on [**9-26**].
