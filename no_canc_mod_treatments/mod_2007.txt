On arrival to the ED, a RIJ was placed and the patient was started on vasopressors because he was hypotensive.
He was empirically treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and later, Flagyl was started for aspiration PNA coverage (see below).
The patient was initially admitted to the MICU where he was maintained on vasopressors.
On the floor, the patient was seen by the infectious disease team who recommended completing a course of antibiotics for pneumonia (as discussed below) in the hospital and then switching to oral [**Date Range 11958**] on discharge to complete 4 week total [**Last Name (un) 10128**] of antibiotics for his bacteremia.
Due to the patient's very poor dentition, he did meet criteria for treatment with antibiotics, and was thus treated with Flagyl.
He was treated with an 8-day course of vanc/cefepime/flagyl.
He was started initially on PO repletion in house, and was later transitioned to IM B12 injections -> regimen will be daily injections for one week, weekly injections for one month, then monthly injections indefinitely after that, as outlined in his Page 1.
# PO Intake: There was concern that patient's pneumonia could be related to aspiration events.
Speech and swallow evaluated the patient and recommendation for thin liquids and soft solid diet were made.
- B12 deficiency: Started on Vitamin B12 injections for anemia and low B12 levels.
Then take monthly on an ongoing basis, stop only if instrcuted by your PCP or other healthcare provider.
- Our speech and swallow specialists felt that there was some increased risk of aspiration and recommended thin liquids, and moist, ground solids.
