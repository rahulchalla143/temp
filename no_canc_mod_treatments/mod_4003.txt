The patient was seen in the ED by hepatology who recommended an EGD with possible intubation (given the patient's mental status).
The patient's daughter opted for conservative management, because she was fearful that the patient may not be able to be extubated.
Past Medical History: HTN CVA DM (on oral hypoglcemics) COPD urinary retention (recent indwelling foley) GI bleeding requiring transfusion  Social History: Lives with daughter.
GIB: Likely upper GI bleed given melena and probably from esophageal varices.
She was maintained on a PPI and Ciprofloxacin and once her blood pressure became stable, she was restarted on Nadolol.
She never required a transfusion.
She was restarted on Amlodipine which she had been taking as an outpatient.
Additionally, Nadolol for the esophageal varices and Lasix for ascites were added on.
Careful attention was paid to not only the blood pressure but the patient's heart rate while on these medications as she was noted to have asymptomatic bradycardia while sleeping.
The patient was able to tolerate them all well and was discharged on her outpatient regimen of all the aforementioned medications.
UTI: The patient was noted to have a UTI on urinalysis which was treated with Levofloxacin.
DM2: The patient's diabetes was monitored and treated with QID fingersticks and an Insulin sliding scale.

An option of having endoscopy (placing a camera down into your stomach to look for a source of bleeding) was offered, but given your initial unstable state and a risk of having to be intubated (having a breathing tube placed into your throat and lungs) per the request of your daughter, the decision was made to hold off on endoscopy.
