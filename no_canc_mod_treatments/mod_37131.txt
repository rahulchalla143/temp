Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Mechanical Ventilation   History of Present Illness: 52 y.o.
Initial ABG was 6.98/98/156 and he was intubated at which time BP reportedly dropped to 50s systolic and he was transiently on pressors, until BP quickly returned to that of presentation.
A femoral line was placed.
He received 3L warm NS and additionally received 1g IV vancomycin and 4.5g IV zosyn.
Additionally at that time his blood pressures again dipped to 50s-60s systolic and he was started on levophed; dopamine was added.
He is now being transferred to the MICU for further management of his hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypothermia and hypotension.

Electrophoresis, Urine  +/- MULTIPLE PROTEIN BANDS SEEN, WITH ALBUMIN PREDOMINATING BASED ON IFE (SEE SEPARATE REPORT), NO MONOCLONAL IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEEN.
STUDIES: ======== EKG [**2139-11-11**] Sinus rhythm with prolonged P-R interval at approximately 280 milliseconds.
TRACING #2  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2139-11-11**] FINDINGS: Single bedside AP examination labeled" "upright at 12:10 hours" is compared with study dated [**2139-6-22**].
There is prominence of the right paratracheal soft tissues, more evident than on the earlier study (perhaps related to degree of patient rotation), likely representing ectatic brachiocephalic vessels.
M with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, HTN, CKD thought [**12-26**] to HTN who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] after having been found down by Baycove Social Work at home and then found to be hypothermic, hypercarbic, and hypotensive in the ED and subsequently admitted to the MICU for further care.
Although serum and urine tox were negative for illicits, there is the possibility of overdose on psychiatric medication.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: (Stage IV CKD) Creatinine elevated from previous baseline of high 2-low 3.
Hyperkalemia was intermittently a concern; received Kayexalate as needed.
He was started on phosphate binders and Vitamin D.  # Altered mental status:  As above, the differential was broad, but likely is a reflection of hypercarbia.
Given the degree of hypercarbia and having been found down, likely altered mental status even prior to this possibly secondary to ingestion of higher dose of his own meds vs. psychosis and subsequent fall, although no clear evidence of trauma.
At the time of admission to the MICU, his psychiatric medications were held.
This was felt due to CO2 narcosis (with a contribution from medications as well).
This prompted the sleep medicine consult as noted above, and BiPAP was begun.
Met SIRS criteria w/hypothermia and RR >20 and concerning for sepsis although truly no clear source of infection (CXR with clear pulmonary edema, but w/o clear infiltrate however at risk for aspiration given AMS/found down), UA negative.
His home meds were restarted.
These meds were titrated for better blood pressure control on the floor.
The patient's BP was stable on clonidine patch, metoprolol, and amlodipine.
Troponin was also up and was likely multifactorial given hypotension and likely demand, also with worsened renal function.
Normotensive while on Clonidine patch, lisinopril, amlodipine, and metoprolol.
Renally dosed allopurinol was begun.
# Pancytopenia: Hemolysis was considered as an etiology, but peripheral smear appears WNL.
He was treated with valtrex for 5 days with resolution of his symptoms and improvement in the rash.
We repeatedly recommended a PICC line, which he repeatedly refused.
