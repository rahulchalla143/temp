Questionable V fib arrest - It was unclear whether patient had VF when she became unresponsive at the CT scan, our leading explaination was that she had a respiratory arrest after one dose of IV contrast for chest CT, in setting of vomiting and low bicarb, also some QT prolongation.
She was started on amiordorone gtt for ?
Her urine tox screen was positive for benzo and opioids, but she received versed and fentanyl during cath.
Given she presented with chest pain and she coded at the CT scan, she was taken to the cath lab which showed one vessel disease (70% stenosis of RCA) and stent was placed, and she was started on ASA and plavix post cath.
Given her initial CK and tropinin was negative, it was unlikely that ischemia is the course of her chest pain on presentation.
We don't think there is any need for defibrillator given normal EF.
Ischemia - patient presented with chest pain, N/V, SOB and diaphoresis, although her initial CK and tropinin was negative, and ECG showed no evidence of acute change suggesting ischemia.
However, she coded while at the CT scan, given her initial presentation of chest pain, she was intubated and taken directly to the cath lab which showed one vessel disease 70% stenosis of RCA s/p Cypher stenting.
