Evaluation of portions of the pancreatic head and tail are limited.
#Hyperglycemia: Given hyperglycemia in the setting of a ketonemia/ketonuria, gap acidosis and elevated serum osm this most likely represented DKA and thus newly diagnosed diabetes.
Patient received aggressive fluid resuscitation and was started on insulin gtt.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and patient switched to sq insulin regimen.
On transfer to the medical floor the patient BS remained elevated, up to 300s, requiring increasing insulin doses.
Her lantus dose was 46 units on discharge and ISS for coverage.
# Gap Acidosis: Likely related to a combination of lactic acid and ketonemia.
Improved with insulin gtt and fluid resucitation.
WBC was elevated, possibly due to reactive leukocytosis and it resolved after lactic acidosis resolved.
The patient was initially treated with narcotics with little effect.
Patient then was empirically started on gabapentin with improvement of her pain.
As the pain improved with gabapentin the pain was thought to be neuropathic in origin.
She was discharged with instructions to increase her dose of gabapentin to 300 TID for better pain control.
She was given anti-emetics and maalox PRN and was tolerating a diet upon transfer out of the MICU.
