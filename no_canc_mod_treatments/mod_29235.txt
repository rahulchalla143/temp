Date: [**2198-7-17**] Signed by [**Name6 (MD) 7495**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 59896**], MD on [**2198-7-17**] Affiliation: HMFP   Title: NEUROLOGY STAFF NEUROLOGY STAFF ATTENDING  I saw and examined Ms. [**Known lastname 67614**] this afternoon, confirming pertinent parts of her history and examination as detailed in Dr.[**Last Name (un) 67615**] note on OMR.
The trauma team is already consulting the infectious disease consultants to confirm appropriateness of her current antimicrobial regimen.
We have nothing further to offer her at this time, particularly as our neurosurgical colleagues are already seeing her and have rendered an opinion re: the likelihood of being able to remove or drain this lesion if it continues to expand.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 67614**] was admitted to the trauma surgical ICU at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2198-6-28**] as a transfer from an outside hospital with a C1 fracture, C2-C4 spinal cord hemorrhage/edema, facial bone fractures, and right femur fracture following a car vs. tree motor vehical crash.
Steroid protocol was initiated with intravenous solumedrol and the right femur was externally fixed.
On hospital day #2, she underwent posterior occipito-cervical fusion laminectomy for cervical spine stabilization.
She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the ICU.
She returned to the operating room on hospital day #5 and underwent uncomplicated open tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement.
Tube feeds were started and she steadily improved tolerating her diet.
Ms. [**Known lastname 67614**] was taken back to the operating room on hospital day #7 ([**2198-7-4**]) where the external fixator was removed from the right upper leg and an intermedullary rod was placed to definitively repair the right femur.
She returned to the operating room on [**2198-7-9**] for placement of an inferior vena cava filter for DVT prophylaxis.
