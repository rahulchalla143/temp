She was given lasix 20mg po and levaquin 500mg x 1.
She was given 500mg levofloxacin and 20mg po lasix at rehab.
She was placed on BiPAP as she continued to be tachypneic in the 40s with oxygen saturation in low 90s on 4L.
.In the ICU: -PICC placed after 1U FFP for INR of 8 -cards was consulted for afib and critical AS: recommends increasing beta blocker to 25 TID (home dose) to keep HR <100.
Recommends follow up in [**Hospital 2974**] clinic 1-2 weeks after discharge for core valve evaluation -went into afib with RVR wh/ corrected after switching albuterol to levalbuterol -pt was gently diuresed; weaned off BiPAP; was not intubated -TTE obtained (see below) .
Past Medical History: - AFib on Coumadin - COPD, chronic SOB and wheezing - Moderate (noted as severe by NF) AS, valve area 1-1.2 cm on [**2127**] echo) - CAD - Hypertension - Traumatic brain injury [**2-23**] concentration camp torture, per son, pt is very "frontal" at baseline - Hypercholesterolemia - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - Hearing Loss - Sigmoid Polyps - Holocaust survivor - Urinary Incontinence - Dementia, with delusions - pulmonary nodules - +PPD, family refused treatment - h/o colonic polyps - OA - anemia - h/o cataract surgery   Social History: Resident of [**Hospital 100**] rehab, uses wheelchair.

[**2130-2-28**] RUE US: FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were acquired of the right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, basilic, brachial, and cephalic veins.
A PICC is seen extending through the right basilic vein, axillary vein, and subclavian vein.
Brief Hospital Course: 89-year-old female with COPD, diastolic CHF, afib on coumadin, CAD, critical aortic stenosis (valve area 0.7 cm2), dementia, hardness of hearing, presenting from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with shortness of breath; likely multifactorial, including PNA, heart failure volume overload in setting of worsening AS, and underlying COPD.
She developed Afib with RVR, likely due to infection and higher albuterol doses; after switching her to levalbuterol and in consultation with cardiology, her HR was maintained on 25mg Metoprolol q8hrs.
# Hypoxia: Pt had initial oxygen desaturation to 78% on 3L, now improved to 90s on NC after being on BiPAP for short duration in ICU.
Was treated in ICU for HCAP with IV vancomycin and levofloxacin for a total 1 week course of each (pt has cephalosporin allergy).
She was treated with standing nebulizers and steroids.
She received 20mg po lasix prior to admission and 20mg iv lasix at ED and put out 200cc urine.
The MICU continued diuresis with 40mg iv lasix with close monitoring of BPs given aortic stenosis.
Plan for after discharge: -continue treatment for HCAP with IV vancomycin and levofloxacin for total 7 day course (d1=2/4pm, thus last dose on 2/10pm) -PICC line placed [**2130-2-27**], R arm -pt is being discharged on albuterol/ipratropium nebs q4h, may wean as tolerated -currently diuresing with home 20mg PO lasix; can consider 10mg IV lasix if appears more fluid overloaded or feels more SOB.
After c/s with cards, the pt was restarted on metoprolol in MICU, and switched to levalbuterol from albuterol, after which her RVR resolved.
The pt is on coumadin at home; daily INR was followed and coumadin dose adjusted accordingly, particularly as pt has hx of supratherapeutic INR on levofloxacin (increased to peak of 8 in ICU).
After callout from the ICU, we continued PO metoprolol for rate control: she is currently on 25mg TID currently, controlled with HR in 90-100s.
Warfarin was restarted 2.5mg on 2/7pm; 3.5mg given on 2/8pm for INR of 1.8.
-pt has f/u visit with cardiology on [**3-10**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for eval of core-valve procedure candidacy .
# R arm pain: pt is s/p PICC on R arm.
RUE duplex showed no e/o DVT; pt's RUE pain disappeared on its own (was likely musculoskeletal in nature), and she was maintained on APAP for pain prn.
Please check daily INR and adjust warfarin dose for goal 2.0-3.0 (pt is on levofloxacin which may increase INR).
Please check vancomycin trough on 2/8pm prior to giving vancomycin dose and adjust vancomycin dose accordingly.
Please continue treatment for HCAP with IV vancomycin and levofloxacin for total 7 day course (d1=2/4pm, thus last dose on 2/10pm).
Pt has f/u visit with cardiology on [**3-10**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for eval of core-valve procedure candidacy.
