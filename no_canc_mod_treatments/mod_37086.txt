Briefly, 63-year-old female with end stage renal disease, status post cadaveric kidney transplant who was recently discharged from arrived at rehabilitation facility and was found unresponsive.
Pt put on bipap for OSA and obesity hypoventilation syndrome c/b hypercarbia.
Had a cadaveric transplant in [**2115**] 2) Sleep apnea.
3) Obesity, hypoventilation syndrome.
DM 6) recurrent respiratory failure requiring intubation X3 over past month presumed due to OSA/Obesity hypoventilation.
7) SVC syndrome due to clots from repeated IV access lines and possible uinderlying hypercoaguable state.
8) recent hematoma in right groin due to femoral line requiring transfusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Upon transfer from the MICU included RenaGel 1,600 po tid, insulin sliding scale, Prednisone 10 mg po q d, Epogen 4,000 units subcu three times a week, Calcitriol 0.25 mcg po q d, Colace 100 mg po bid, Dulcolax 10 mg po prn, Tylenol prn, Protonix 40 mg q d, Lopressor 25 mg po bid and Imuran 100 mg po q d.  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
She also had calcium of 9.7, phosphorus 3.8 and magnesium 2.3.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon transfer to our service, it was deemed that patient would require dialysis fairly soon.
It was therefore felt that patient was a very poor candidate for hemodialysis given lack of access.
Her prognosis was extremely poor given a lack of IV access for dialysis and ongoing hypoventilation and refusal to use BIPAP.
The family felt that the best option was to make the patient comfort measures only as there was no apparent way to improve her renal or respiratory compromise (short of tracheostomy with cpap/mechanical ventiation as needed).
The patient was made comfort measures only on [**6-12**].
She was started on sublingual Morphine which she did not tolerate very well.
She was therefore switched to IV Morphine 2 mg q 4-6 hours prn.
