Nasogastric tube can be traced as far as the lower esophagus but the tip is not distinct.
Indeterminant 3-cm cystic appearing lesion exophytic off the upper pole of the left kidney in addition to multiple bilateral simple renal cysts.
A renal ultrasound or MRI may be obtained for further characterization the the 3cm indeterminate lesion as the patient's clinical condition warrants.
KUB ([**2142-4-23**]): FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
The most likely etiology is ileus, though a partial small- bowel obstruction cannot be excluded.
Confluent opacification at the lung bases could be explained by combination of atelectasis and confluent edema though radiographically one cannot exclude aspiration or even pneumonia.
Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.
Tip of the left subclavian line projects over the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.
Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
KUB- nasointestinal tube placement [**2142-5-14**]- Post-pyloric feeding tube placement complete without complications.
Incidental note of intestinal distension  CXR ([**2142-5-14**])- No acute cardiopulmonary process.
NECROTIZING PANCREATITIS: Etiology of the patient's pancreatitis was not clear.
CT imaging revealed a partially-necrosed pancreas with a fluid collection.
He received aggressive fluid resuscitation and was started on IV meropenem.
Given his very significant resuscitation requirements, the patient was intubated to maintain oxygenation and ventilation in the setting of worsening anasarca and third-spacing of fluid.
The patient initially began to show interval improvement after the first 48 hours as measured by lab abnormalities and fluid resuscitaton requirements, but then again decompensated with fevers > 103, a precipitous rise in WBC, a diffuse rash, and hypotension requiring more aggressive fluid resuscitation and eventual initiation of vasopressors.
He was maintained on TPN until he was able to tolerate enteric feeding.
His ileus was followed with serial KUB's and eventually improved.
Due to significant difficulty placing a post-pyloric feeding tube, he had an NG tube placed and was started on tube feeds, which he tolerated.
He had a post-pyloric feeding tube placed on [**5-14**] and tube feeds were continued.
At the time of discharge, he was tolerating tube feeds well and did not require TPN.
Requiring PEEP initially as high as 18 likely secondary to increased intrabdominal pressure.
He was transitioned to trach mask ventilation and had a Passy-Muir Valve placed.
Of note, on the afternoon after having the sutures removed from his tracheostomy site, the patient's trach tube was noted to be out of proper position.
Anesthesia and CT surgery urgently evaluated the patient.
Diuresis with IV lasix should be continued with a goal of [**12-30**] L negative a day.
BACTEREMIA/ FEVERS:  As above, he was initially started on meropenem on admission for severe pancreatitis.
Eventually, he grew coag neg staph sensitive to linezolid in consecutive blood cultures from [**Date range (1) 71614**] and then coag neg staph that was resistant to linezolid in a blood culture on [**5-3**].
Additionally, he grew pan-sensitive enterococcus faecalis in consecutive blood cultures from [**Date range (1) 40693**].
His central venous lines were the suspected source.
Given his various positive cultures, he was followed by the infectious disease service, who recommended various adjustments to his antibiotic regimen.
He was unable to be started on vancomycin because of a questionable history allergy reported from another facility.
Allergy was consulted and felt that he is unlikely to be allergic to vancomycin; however, to be safe he should undergo a desensitization if vancomycin was necessary.
He was tried on tigecycline but developed a questionable allergic reaction.
At the time of discharge, the infectious disease team recommended a total 14 day course of amikacin to end on [**5-21**].
SKIN RASH: As above, the patient was initially started on meropenem on admission.
However, if tigecycline would be needed in the future, the patient could undergo desensitization.
There was some initial concern for c.diff, and he was kept on flagyl for an extended period of time, given the impossibility of collecting stool samples.
After several unsuccessful attempts at placement of a post-pyloric feeding tube, he was started on gastric tube feedings.
He subsequently developed marked abdominal distention and tube feeds were held.
His ileus improved after weaning narcotics and a few doses of methylnaltrexone.
After the patient's ileus improved, he was restarted on tube feeds and tolerated them well.
AGITATION/ DELERIUM: Given his intubation, the patient was initially on large amounts of IV sedation.
After tracheostomy placement, the patient's sedation was weaned.
In the setting of weaning his sedation, he began to experience some agitation and delirium, for which he was started on standing methadone and haldol.
As these medications were tapered, he was started on standing seroquel.
The etiology was likely multifactoiral, including his pancreatitis, his bacteremia, and his sedation while he was intubated.
As his clinical status improved and his sedation was weaned, his hypotension improved and his pressors were weaned and stopped.
ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: The patient presented with acute renal failure, which initially improved with IV hydration.
NG tube contents and stool were both guaiac negative, and felt to be secondary to repeated phelbotomy.
TYPE II DIABETES, c/b neuropathy: The patient was continued on sliding scale insulin and was given insulin in his TPN.
Following transfer from TPN  to tube feeds he required lantus and an insulin sliding scale with meals.
Due to high blood sugars, lantus 10u daily was added to his regimen, and he will continue on hospital humalog sliding scale, which may need to be adjusted as appropriate.
