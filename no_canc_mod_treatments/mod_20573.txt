Successful placement of a pericardial catheter via the subxyphoid approach with aspiration of 400 cc of bloody fluid.
After drainage of 400 cc of fluid, right atrial pressures decreased to 13 mmHg with return of normal Y-descent.
Pericardial drain was left in place and continued to yield ~25cc the first day, then ~65cc of serosanguinous fluid the next day upon removal of the drain.
Of note, pulsus had been reduced to 6mmHg following drainage in the cath lab on hospital day one and continued to remain stable at 6mmHg throughout remainder of hospitalization.
In pursuit of etiology of effusion, a PPD was placed (flat @ 48 hours), AFB stain of fluid was negative, and no organisms were seen.
However, the fluid did reveal 38,000 white cells with neutrophil predominance.
Nonetheless, patient was in excellent clinical condition following drainage and was afebrile throughout course, suggesting that the effusion was less likely purulent.
With the pericardial drain in place, patient continued to have significant pleuritic pain, which was treated to good effect with indomethacin 50mg TID.
Patient required 75mcg of Fentanyl and 1mg of Versed at the time of removal of the drain.
However, following removal of drain, patient was virtually pain free.
Patient was discharged with instructions to return for echocardiogram within one week of discharge, to see PCP in followup for chemistries and CBC (while on indomethacin) within one week, and to return to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in cardiology within two weeks to review echocardiogram results.
