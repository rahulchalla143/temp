She underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed clean coronaries and a balloon pump was placed secondary to poor right heart function.
She was then transferred for surgical evaluation.
Infectious disease was consulted on arrival given her fever history and she was placed on antibiotics until her valve tissue cultures returned negative.
On [**2193-1-16**] she underwent a mitral valve repair and corematrix closure of pericardium.
She tolerated this procedure well and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the surgical intensive care unit.
She was extubated and her balloon pump removed.
She had atrial fibrillation and responded with bradycardia to amiodarone on conversion to sinus rhythm.
