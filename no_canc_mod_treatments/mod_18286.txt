Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Suboccipital craniotomy tracheostomy PEG tube placement Placement and removal of central line   History of Present Illness: 83F h/o DM, CAD p/w n/v & lethargy, found to have large R PICA stroke at [**Hospital 6138**] Hospital.
She became increasingly lethargic and was intubated for airway protection.
83 yo f with PMH positive for CAD, strokes, NIDDM, Asthma presented to OSH with lethargy and cc of weakness, n/v on [**2153-8-21**].
At [**Hospital1 **] ED she was intubated for airway protection due to increased lethargy and put on neosynephrine drip due to hypotension.
Review of Head CT showed large right PICA cerebellar infarct with midline shift and pressure on the 4th ventricle.
She was given Mannitol 50grams iv once.
Neurosurgery performed suboccipital craniotomy to relieve intracranial pressure.
Cranial Nerves: Has positive gag, corneal, and oculocephalic reflexes.
She was given a 6-pack of platelets (as she had been on aspirin and Plavix) and was taken emergently from the ED to the OR by neurosurgery where she underwent a suboccipital craniotomy for decompression.
She tolerated the procedure well and was admitted to the NeuroICU following the procedure.
Mentation greatly improved during the patient's stay, correlating with treatment of her pneumonia and tracheostomy placement.
The patient continued to be interactive when examined with a translator.
She was re-started on coumadin for anticoagulation for her thromboembolic stroke.
Her INR will need to be monitored and coumidin increased with a INR goal of [**12-22**].5. .
# Respiratory Distress: Patient received tracheostomy on [**2152-11-30**], and her chest x-ray has demonstrated much improvement, only notable for persistent lll collapse.
Patient was treated for ventilator associated pneumonia twice with courses vancomycin and zosyn.
Ultrasound was used to evaluate for potential effusion for thoracentesis, but there was not enough fluid to tap.
Patient underwent several bronchoscopies with removal of mucoid material.
Daily pressure support trials were initiated after trachestomy, and she did well.
Normal saline nebs were used to hydrate the airway, and she was given inhaled corticosteroids for her history of asthma/COPD.
Gentle diuresis was attempted but limited by hypotension.
Given her repeated collapse noted on chest x-ray and on repeat bronchoscopies, patient may be candidate for stent placement from interventional pulmonology in the future.
On the floor, the patient was saturating well on her trach mask.
As a result, fluoxetine was discontinued, and fentanyl IV was weaned and transitionned to a patch.
It was suspected that her was possibly due to suspected serotonin syndrome.
At time of discharge from the MICU, she was normotensive, and her home blood pressure medications were held.
Her lisinopril was restarted at a low dose of 2.5mg and her blood pressures were stable at the time of discharge.
He blood pressure should be monitored and medications titrated as needed to maintain good blood pressure control.
ASA, Plavix and BB were held, ACEI was restarted at low dose.
Statin was continued.
She was not restarted on ASA and plavix at the time of discharge because of bleeding risk.
Her primary care physician will need to follow up these medications in the future and reevaluate risks and benifits of these medications.
# DM  blood sugars at goal at this time on NPH 13 units in AM and PM.
Will be continued on sliding scale.
Her blood sugars should be followed at rehab and insulin titrated as needed.
# Depression: d/c 'd fluoxetine, as noted above given suspected serotonin syndrome.
Patient would likely benefit from an [**Doctor Last Name 360**] to replace her fluoxetine, and further psychiatric evaluation during her rehabilitation stay.
# Asthma: Continued on nebs PRN and inhailed steroids.
# PPX: Continue heparin SQ while she is being started on heparin.
Can stop heparin once therapeutic on coumidin.
