FINDINGS: Status post sternotomy with surgical clips post-CABG.
Right-sided PICC line is again seen with the tip in the SVC.
On [**12-30**] she was brought to the operating room where she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 4.
The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 914**].
In summary she had CABG x4 with LIMA-LAD, SVG-Diag, SVG-Ramus, SVG-OM.
She tolerated the operation well and following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.
She remained intubated for three days after surgery secondary to a difficult airway and fluid overload.
She was weaned from her pressors and her chest tubes were removed.
She was fed via a dobhoff tube after surgery secondary to somnolence.
Her beta blockade was titrated up as tolerated.
She had intermitant episodes of atrial fibrillation with hypotension and was returned to the surgical intensive care unit, where she converted to sinus rhythm after adjustment of Bblockers and initiation of amiodarone.
Her mediastinal incision was noted to have some purulent drainage and she was started on Vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.
Sternal drainage subsided and her sternum remained stable.
As discussed with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**], Cipro was discontinued and upon discharge, Vancomycin will be continued for 7 days.
On post-operative day 15 she was discharged to rehabilitation at [**Hospital6 **].
