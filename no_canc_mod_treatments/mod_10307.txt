HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and tobacco use who presented to the Emergency Department with a 7-day history of worsening dyspnea on exertion, a cough productive of yellow sputum, fevers, chills, as well as left-sided pleuritic chest pain.
The patient had presented to his primary care physician with similar symptoms in [**Month (only) **] and [**2139-9-18**] and was treated with a course of azithromycin for presumed bronchitis; reportedly without symptomatic improvement.
The patient denied recent travel, sick contacts, headaches, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, as well as urinary symptoms.
Based on this conversation, the patient assumed his diabetic medication was unnecessary and discontinued the medication approximately six week prior to admission.
The computed tomography angiogram demonstrated a left lingular infiltrate, and the patient was started on levofloxacin and nebulizer treatments.
While in the Emergency Department, the patient received a total of 8 liters of normal saline without significant blood pressure response, and the patient was subsequently started on blood pressure support.
Atenolol 50 mg p.o.
Metformin 500 mg p.o.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories and studies on admission revealed complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 18.8, hematocrit was 43.6, and platelets were 195.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was initially treated with levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin a multilobar pneumonia with a septic physiology.
The vancomycin was discontinued after one day, and following the results of a sputum culture from admission with evidence of moderate pneumococci, the Levaquin was discontinued after completion of five days.
The patient was continued on ceftriaxone for the duration of the hospitalization.
All blood cultures were without growth including multiple catheter tip cultures.
The persistent fever was concerning for a line infection, and vancomycin was restarted on [**12-3**].
The patient required frequent suctioning for copious secretions as well as frequent albuterol nebulizer treatments for bronchospasms.
As the patient was being weaned from sedation and ventilation, the patient self-extubated on [**12-1**].
The patient maintained adequate oxygenation and ventilation for the remainder of the hospitalization.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient initially required blood pressure support for hypotension in the setting of sepsis.
After hospital day one, the patient continued off of blood pressure support with systolic blood pressures ranging from 130 to 160.
The patient required an insulin drip while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for poorly controlled blood glucoses.
On hospital day nine, metformin was restarted at outpatient doses.
While intubated, the patient had received significant sedation for suctioning.
The patient underwent a diagnostic head computed tomography without evidence of pathology.
Metformin 500 mg p.o.
Levaquin 500 mg p.o.
Atenolol 50 mg p.o.
