He was taken to the operating room where he underwent a liver transplantation that was unremarkable.
His liver function tests came back to normal and on postoperative day 4 after his second procedure while in the intensive care unit, he arose from a chair and while moving to the bed, became significantly hypoxic and hypotensive.
Received ACLS protocol and was able to be resuscitated and normal blood pressure returned.
He was started on antiseizure medications and eventually the seizures were able to be controlled.
We did not believe that additional surgical intervention or interventional radiologic intervention was warranted.
