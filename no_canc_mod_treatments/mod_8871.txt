Past Medical History: * ESLD secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis, s/p living unrelated donor transplant in [**3-/2161**] which failed leading to cerebral edema necessitating second transplant in [**3-/2161**] * IBD - UC diagnosed [**2156**] after p/w bloody stools * h/o cerebral edema s/p VP shunt * h/o prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy * h/o G tube placement (now removed) * h/o seizures * Ulcerative colitis * Anoxic brain injury [**1-26**] respiratory arrest * Hypothyroidism * h/o dysphagia  Social History: Living at rehab facility chronically following anoxic brain injury in [**2161**].
Brief Hospital Course: Brief Summary: 36 y/o W with PSC s/p liver transplantation X 2, anoxic brain injury who is transferred with diarrhea, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was sent to the MICU for treatment hypernatremia (Na 160) & renal failure.
The patient was started on prednisone for presumed UC flare.
She was also found to have complete Left lower extremity DVT, and was started on lovenox [**Hospital1 **]--she was tried on coumadin, but this was discontinued after two doses as her INR rose to >17 after only two doses.
It improved with continuous IVF.
As diarrhea slowed & pt's PO intake improved, IVF was discontinued and Mrs. [**Known lastname 32457**] was able to maintain adequate PO intake with Na in the low 140s.
# Diarrhea: Patient had regular, non-bloody diarrhea.
She started on Prednisone for presumed UC flare (40 mg po qd for 2 weeks than taper 5 mg a week).
She was continued on Mesalamine DR 1600 mg PO TID for UC.
Ursodiol was held since it could worsen her diarrhea, but it will need to be re-started once her diarrhea slows.
(She was started on vitamin D & calcium since she will be on steroids for prolonged period.)
# L lower extremity swelling: She was found to have a large DVT in her left lower extremity, despite being on DVT prophylaxis with SC heparin.
This DVT is her first known thrombotic event, and it was felt to be due to her dehydration plus her immobility during her acute illness.
She was initiated on a heparin drip, and then given coumadin.
Following 2 doses of coumadin at a dose of 2 mg, her INR increased to 17.6.
She was also given Vitamin K 5 mg X 3 days.
She should not be given coumadin given the unpredictability of her response to the anti-coagulant.
She should receive Lovenox therapy at minimun for 6 months for her DVT.
She was continued on tacrolimus (Prograf) for immunosuppression, and the dose was adjusted based on trough levels.
She was given Cefazolin 1g q8hr, which she should receive for a total of 14 days, until [**2165-12-24**].
Her drop in hematocrit may have been a reflection of her baseline anemia (hct has reportedly w/ been in the upper-20s at her nursing home) plus a dilutional component in the setting of IVF.
She was transfused 2units of packed red blood cells on [**2165-12-17**].
