The patient has a complicated recent medical history including an admission to [**Hospital 46148**] Hospital in [**2176-11-8**] following an overdose with multiple substances, subsequently developing bilateral question aspiration pneumonias requiring an Intensive Care Unit stay (it is not clear if the patient was intubated at this time).
The patient developed persistent hypoxemia after her [**Month (only) **] admission and was placed on 3 liters of nasal cannula oxygen upon [**Month (only) **] in [**Month (only) 1096**].
In the interim she had restarted using alcohol, intravenous heroin, intranasal cocaine and abusing other pills including PCAs.
She had increased her use of intravenous heroin and intranasal cocaine within the preceding week.
She was begun on Ceftazidime and Clindamycin for possible aspiration pneumonia and also given steroids and nebulizers for compliance of reactive disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The patient had increasing oxygen requirement and was eventually placed on nonrebreather on the medical floor.
Antibiotics were changed to Levaquin on [**2-3**] and then to Azithromycin on [**2-6**].
The patient's respiratory status continued to decline and she was intubated on [**2177-2-8**] at [**Hospital 46148**] Hospital.
The patient continued to require increasing positive end expiratory pressure and ventilatory supports by aggressive antibiotic therapy and Intensive Care Unit management.
The patient underwent right open wound biopsy on [**2177-2-13**] after which a right tube was placed.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Propofol drip; Versed drip; Lovenox subcutaneous; morphine drip; Ciprofloxacin 400 intravenously b.i.d.
; Lopressor; Lansoprazole; Solu-Medrol 60 b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive tobacco use, patient lives with sister and has had a long history of polysubstance abuse including intravenous heroin, intranasal cocaine, alcohol and psychiatric medications.
Chem-7 sodium 139, potassium 4, chloride 97, bicarbonate 28, BUN 16, creatinine 0.3, glucose 117, normal coagulation studies.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Fennard Intensive Care Unit on [**2-17**] for further evaluation and management of her diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrate and persistent hypoxemia.
Given that the patient had received greater than 14 days of broad-spectrum antibiotics at the outside hospital the decision was made to withhold any antibiotic treatment until sputum cultures were revealing of an infectious etiology.
Given that her open lung biopsy had revealed diffuse alveolar damage, consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary edema, the patient was placed on midury protocol for treatment of late stage adult respiratory distress syndrome with tapering dose of Solu-Medrol.
Her chest tube was removed on [**2177-2-19**] without complications.
A PICC line was placed on [**2177-3-3**] for improved intravenous access, given poor peripheral veins due to drug use.
Her right internal jugular with triple lumen catheter was discontinued at this time.
The possibility of acute interstitial pneumonitis, ([**Location (un) 2716**] [**Doctor First Name **] syndrome) was suggested.
The patient had tracheostomy placed on [**2177-3-3**] as it became clear that she would require continuous ventilatory support in the rehabilitation setting.
Placement of tracheostomy was without complications.
The patient continued to do well after tracheostomy placement and eventually had a percutaneous enterogastric jejunostomy tube placed on [**2177-2-2**] for nutritional support.
The procedure was without complications and tube feeds were started through her gastrostomy tube without complications.
At the time of [**Year (4 digits) **], the patient has ventilatory settings of pressure support 15 with positive end-expiratory pressure of 12.5, FIO2 40 to 50%.
She has required persistently increasing amount of Klonopin and Risperdal for agitation.
She will be discharged to [**Hospital6 13846**] for ventilatory support and pulmonary rehabilitation as well as physical therapy.
