No baseline creatinine was available.
In the early morning on the day following admission, the patient required intubation to control multiple aspects of his medical situation including extreme hypertension, respiratory distress, and the need for sedation secondary to ongoing violent shaking of his extremities.
An ulcer in the duodenum was treated with epinephrine injection and thermal therapy.
Biopsy obtained during the EGD returned on [**2-26**] positive for H. pylori, and the patient was started on treatment.
Therefore, the patient began empiric treatment with vancomycin.
There was also a concern for sinusitis, and the patient was treated with Augmentin.
LABS ON ADMISSION (ORIGINAL LABS FROM [**2120-2-21**]):  White blood cells at 8.3, hemoglobin 3.4, hematocrit 11.3, neutrophils 76.1, bands 0, lymphocytes 20.6, monocytes 2.9, eosinophils 0.2, basophils 0.1, platelets 232, PT 14.3, PTT 21.6, INR 1.4, sodium 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 105, bicarb 22, BUN 81, creatinine 4.3, glucose 145, ALT 16, AST 26, CK 194, alkaline phosphatase 45, amylase 99, total bilirubin 0.2, albumin 3.2, calcium 8.1, phosphorus 3.5, magnesium 2.0.
For the probable sinus infection, the patient was treated with a 14-day course of Augmentin.
In addition, the patient was found to be growing gram-positive cocci in his sputum and was started on vancomycin empirically in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
At this time, the patient is on a clonidine patch, metoprolol 150 tid, nifedipine 60 q 6 h, hydralazine 75 q 6 h, and lisinopril 5 mg po qd.
This regimen will be continued at discharge.
In addition, the patient's biopsy was positive for H. pylori, and he received a 2-week course of treatment, including clarithromycin and a PPI.
4) PULMONARY:  The patient did well with a tracheostomy on the floor.
He consistently had saturations in the high-90s to 100% range on 30-40% humidified trach mask.
As an ACE inhibitor was added to control his blood pressure, his creatinine was followed closely, but did not have a significant long-term increase.
Therefore, he was slowly tapered off of Dilantin and has been doing well since that time.
He was covered with regular insulin sliding scale.
9) FEN:  Initially, the patient was on tube feeds through a Dobbhoff tube.
However, he underwent a speech and swallow study and was cleared to take thickened liquids and purees without risk of aspiration.
On [**2120-3-22**], he underwent another speech and swallow evaluation to see if his diet could be advanced; these results are currently pending.
10) REHAB:  PT, OT and speech therapy worked with the patient throughout his time at [**Hospital1 18**].
