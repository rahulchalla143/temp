Right thoracotomy with partial lung decortication 3.
She developed a large right effusion over a year ago and was treated with a PleurX catheter with continuous drainage.
She was referred for further management at that time.
She underwent a thoracoscopy with partial lung decortication and a mechanical as well as talc pleurodesis.
Pleurx catheter placement and management of recurrent pleural effusion.
IMAGING: [**5-15**] CXR: CLINICAL HISTORY: Status post decortication on the right chest.
IMPRESSION: Chest tubes in satisfactory position.
Right pleural tube is unchanged in position.
[**5-17**] CXR: Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates no interval change in the three right-sided chest tubes seen on [**2172-5-16**].
[**5-18**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-15**] through [**5-17**]:  Low lung volumes suggest this film was taken at suboptimal inspiration accounting for worsening atelectasis in the region of surgery at the base of the right lung.
The appearance of the right chest is stable with three chest tubes in place.
[**5-21**] CXR: HISTORY: Right thoracotomy and decortication.
3 chest tubes are present in the hemithorax as previously demonstrated with subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall.
One of the two right chest tubes has been removed, the lower one.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 58457**] was admitted on [**2172-5-15**] after a decortication and mechanical pleurodesis.
For details of the procedure please see the operative report.
Of note, the procedure was unable to be completed thoracoscopically necessitating a right thoracotomy.
She tolerated the procedure well and was admitted to the SICU postoperatively intubated.
2 chest tubes and a tunneled pleurex catheter were left in place postoperatively.
Both chest tubes were placed to suction with an air leak noticed immediately.
She continued to be tachycardic after adequate volume resusciation, but she continued to have significant difficulties with pain control.
Once her pain was stablized on her home regimen of oxycontin and lamotrigine the tachycardia resolved.
She was restarted on her lasix but her aldactone was held.
She was also started on salt tabs and a fluid restriction once adequate resuscitated for hyponatremia (sodium as low as 128).
This remained stable throughout her hospital stay and she was restarted on aldactone on POD 6.
Both chest tubes remained on suction postoperatively for several days in order to ensure full expansion and adhesion formation of the right lung.
After removal of the second chest tube, the pleurex catheter was attached to pleurovac on suction.
