He had no fevers or consolidations to suggest pneumonia; his leukocytosis was likely due to the steroids started at the OSH.
We also considered cardiac ischemia given his history of CAD, but he had no chest pain or ischemic EKG changes and cardiac enzymes were negative.
The patient was started on standing ipratropium and xopenex nebs q6h with prn xopenex, though he initially refused most of these treatments.
The patient was  also started on solumedrol 60mg IV Q8, started on [**4-14**] and continued for 7 days, with a plan to then taper.
When his symptoms did not improve, he was increased to Solumedrol 80mg IV Q8hrs briefly.
He will complete a 10-day taper as an outpatient before stopping prednisone [**2124-5-8**].
Given his prolonged course of high-dose steroids, he was started on Bactrim, pantoprazole, calcium and vitamin D.  He will stop the Bactrim and pantoprazole after stopping prednisone, but continue Ca + Vit D.  The patient is often irritable and unstable while on steroids, and at one point threw a commode towards a health care worker.
His stability improved with lowering steroid doses.
Levofloxacin started in the emergency department was continued(day 1 = [**4-13**]) for an empiric course of 5 days.
The patient was very opposed to using home Oxygen, so after 10 days of oxygen at 5L by nasal cannula, he was slowly weaned starting [**4-23**].
He was stable off of Oxygen at the time of discharge and was able to ambulate with physical therapy.
Likely multifactorial with components from dehydration, anxiety, and albuterol nebs.
Pt tachyardic and tachypneic but afebrile; his clinical picture was not consistent with SIRS/sepsis as also explainable by COPD.
Substance withdrawal a possibility; he denied EtOH use but concern for oxycodone overuse at OSH given #90 oxycontin prescribed [**4-9**] and #10 left on admission on [**4-10**].
He remained low-level tachycardic even after restarting diltiazem.
His dose of QHS Lantus was slowly increased up to 20 units, but he remained very hyperglycemic, requiring large doses of Humalog with each meal.
He was discharged with a decreasing dose of Lantus given his non-compliance and the concerns for hypoglycemia.
We recommended that he have a visiting nurse to help with his insulin but he refused.
He was started on an Aspirin given his risk factors.
He was non-compliant with a diabetic diet and did not listen to instructions.
