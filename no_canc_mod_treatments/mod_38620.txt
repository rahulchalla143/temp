Admission Date:  [**2123-4-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-5-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-5-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Haldol / Fluphenazine / Chlorpromazine / Clozapine / Risperidone / Zyprexa / Reglan / Promethazine / Flagyl / Trileptal / Clindamycin / Cefazolin / Erythromycin Base / Amoxicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation/Sedation to allow medical care early in hospital course  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 90100**] is a 24 year-old woman with recent diagnosis of SLE vs possible Crohn's on steroid taper and pervasive development disorder (resides in a group home) who presents with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Her Prednisone was increased to 10mg.
Pt received zofran, reglan (with benadryl), and hydrocortisone 100mg prior to transfer.
Diffuse colitis, infectious, inflammatory, or vasculitis etiologies should be considered.
SIGMOIDOSCOPY [**2123-4-8**]: - Moderately severe colitis with likely pseudomembrane in the sigmoid and descending colon (biopsy, biopsy) - Loss of vascularity in the rectum - Internal hemorrhoids - Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to splenic flexure  RECS: Await pathology report.
Send stool studies for C.diff toxin/PCR, and would initiate empiric therapy for C.diff colitis with PO/PR Vancomycin.
Would recommend against increasing steroid therapy for now given the concern and high likelihood for C.diff colitis, unless histologic evaluation appears otherwise.
Management is complicated by behavioral issues (pulling out all lines), requiring sedation and intubation to enable medical management.
Decompression with [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube was performed.
C.diff toxin and C.diff PCR were negative.
Patient was started on a course 1000 mg Methylprednisolone x3d followed by a taper.
Nonetheless, it was the opinion of the rheumatology consult service that this likely represent vasculitis-associated colitis and her symptoms improved with ongoing prednisone and restarted azathioprine use.
The patient will continue on 30mg daily of prednisone and 75mg daily of azathioprine with calcium, vitamin d, atovaquone prophylaxis with weekly blood draws for azathioprine toxicity monitoring.
She was treated with Meropenem for 8 days ([**Date range (1) **]).
Treatment with Vancomycin was planned for 14 days ([**Date range (1) 90101**]), but the patient pulled out her IV access and was converted to PO Linezolid.
The patient will reufse PO meds sometimes, so because of clinical stability and difficulty with administering IV or PO meds, treatment for Coag-neg staph was stopped at 12 days (stopped [**4-21**]).
Foley catheter was placed which found the bladder to be retaining 900cc urine.
Subsequently the patient pulled her foley catheter and repeat post-void residual measurement revealed <100cc residual on multiple repeat measurements.
Attempts were made at treating this with antifungal powder however the patient intermittently refused this therapy and she did not show clinical response.
She was therefore started on a 2 week course of oral fluconazole.
