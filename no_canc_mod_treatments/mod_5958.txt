For this, she will rest for several minutes or take a sublingual nitroglycerin which relieves her symptoms.
She is on imdur which helps and has also been on ranolazine previously which did not seem to help.
She went for elective cardiac catherization today due to suspicion that one of her vein grafts was down which was causing her symptoms.
However, on obtaining arterial circulation access in the right femoral artery, a dissection occured, which required intervention on the left with passing of a balloon from that side to tamponade the bleeding, which was successful.
