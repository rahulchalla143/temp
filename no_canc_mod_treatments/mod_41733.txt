She was started on cipro and when her sx did not improved was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**5-29**] where cipro was changed to cefpodoxime because of concern that her UTI was not adequately treated with Cipro and she was discharged back home.
She received morphine for pain as well as Zofran for nausea.
Overnight her blood pressures continued to trend down to the 70s and were minimally responsive to 3L of NS with systolics maintained in the 80s.
Her antibiotics were changed from cefpodoxime to ceftriaxone q24 hrs.
A second IV was placed in addition to a foley catheter.
The patient was ultimately transferred to the MICU for persistent hypotension despite fluid rescussitation and marked nursing concern.

-EBV ([**2134-5-31**]):                        **FINAL REPORT [**2134-6-3**]**     [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] VIRUS VCA-IgG AB (Final [**2134-6-3**]):    POSITIVE BY EIA.
In most populations, 90% of adults have been infected at sometime       with EBV and will have measurable VCA IgG and EBNA antibodies.
Antibodies to EBNA develop 6-8 weeks after primary infection and       remain present for life.
Supporting this was 8% atypical cells on her admission CBC/diff and splenomegaly to 15cm on imaging.
She was treated conservatively with IV fluids and tylenol/NSAIDs for pain control and fevers.
At discharge, she was off IV fluids and taking adequate PO.
She was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring where she received IV fluids and did not require pressors.
At discharge, she was taking good PO and not requiring IV fluids with systolic BP in the 90-120s.
Likely cause was atelectasis and she was given an incentive spirometer on the floor.
Prior to admission, she was on Cipro which was subsequently changed to cefpodox and was continued on CTX for 3 days this admission.
She was not on medications for her diabetes at admission and blood sugar remained well controlled.
