The patient was given a second dose of narcan on presentation to MICU after propofol was stopped, and became modestly more alert.
He also underwent brain MRI which showed a small area of ischemia in the temporal lobe, though this did not seem to completely explain his initial presentation so medication effect still thought to be the primary explanation for patient's altered mental status.
Started on aspirin for secondary prevention.
He briefly required four-point restraints, but eventually calmed down after 2.5mg Zyprexa.
Cause of pt's agitation thought to be delirium due to recent administration of ativan in addition to the effect of seroquel withdrawal.
Patient given levofloxacin and Vancomycin in the ED for potential aspiration.
In the MICU, antibiotics were held and patient was monitored for further signs of pneumonia.
If Creatine trends up, contrast induced nephropathy would be on differential as patient received dye load for CTA head/neck this admission.
Pt received 1.8mg colchicine and his allopurinol was held.
Prednisone and NSAIDs avoided in setting of pt's underlying psychiatric disorder and his recent gastritis, respectively.
Statin was decreased with hopes these values would continue to trend down.
