EMS gave her sl nitroglycerin for CP ([**10-15**]) enroute to OSH ([**Hospital3 **]), not relieved.
later relieved with morphine IV x 2. .
At the ED, she was given 5mg IV lopressor, BP dropped to 60's, started with fluid resuscitation 5L [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Intially, chest pain free, T 94.6, BP 98/54, cool mottled skin,likely cardiogenic shock, and started dopamin 5->7.5mg/kg.
Patient underwent a fluoro guided pericardiocentesis with peridcardial pressure of 20mmHg, localized effusion with 150cc of bloody drainage with Hct of 34) worrisome for pericarditis vs localized sealed myocardial rupture.
Cardiac surgery was consulted at the time, for likely retamponade in the future.
She was back onto the CCU floor, type and crossed 6 units of blood and off pressors, put on ASA, plavix 75mg x 12 months, echo in 1 hour showed minimal effusion localized to RV (total output ~100cc), keep SBP<110 given likely rupture, hemodynamic monitoring with A-line and PA.   Past Medical History: HTN Hyperlipidima ?TIAs Asthma bronchitis (recent excerbation two weeks ago, was on levaquin x 7 days, and steroids x 2weeks, last dose three days prior) Glaucoma osteoprosis h/o TB in [**2120**]'s treated Reflux s/p slasky's ring dilation   Social History: Lives with one of her daughters, former nurse, still works at store (cashier), widowed (2 daughters), no smoking (but a lot of second hand smoking from husband), no ETOH or drugs   Family History: + CAD, +DM   Physical Exam: Admission:  Vitals: T 94.6, BP 94/51, HR 88, RR 21, 98% on 4L, Ht 5'1'', 130lbs Gnl: NAD, Alert and oriented x 3 HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, MM slightly dry, OP clear, JVP difficult to assess.
The patient was weaned off Dopamin and cardiac index improved.
4. the RCA lesion was predilated with a 2.0 balloon and stented with two overlapping 3.0 Cypher stents with lesion reduction from 90 to 0%.
The LCX lesion was predilated with a 2.0 balloon and stented with a 2.5 stent with lesion reduction to 0%.
The moderate pericardial effusion was drained with improvement of her hemodynamic status.
The drain was left in situ for overnight drainage.
Prominent anterior fat pad (vs. hemorrhagic effusion without hemodynamic compromise).

PA cathether and A line were placed to assess CI and pressures.
Patient was placed on ASA 325', Plavix 75', lipitor 80' decreased to 10' due to intoleration, captopril 6.25''' initially.
Pericardail drain placed and followed--collected 100 cc yesterday afternoon but no further drainage past 1600 yesterday.
Per instructions from placing attending, no saline or heparin flush started, as hoping not to dislodge clot and that effusion no longer collecting.
Echo on [**8-12**] to measure for effusion will help to evaluate whether the pressure equalizing is due to volume overload or reaccumulation of fluid, which showed 1 cm pericardial effusion: appears stable, more likely due to fluid overload.
pericardial drain pulled on [**8-12**] and repeat echo showed stable pericardial effusion.
Patient was treated with lasix prn for fluid overload, and started with metoprolol after her BP stabilized.
We continued monitoring her CVP and PAP which remained stable and her PA catheter was pulled on [**2176-8-14**], we increased her metoprol dose to 12.5mg tid and her captopril to 25mg tid.
On [**2176-8-15**], her A-line was pulled, and her bblock was converted to atenolol 25' and her ACEI was converted to lisinopril 5mg', she was called out to the step down unit, and continued to do well without symptoms of SOB, chest pain, or dizziness.
She had another episode of SVT (likely A tach) in th 120s in the afternoon of [**8-13**], which she was treated with lopressor 5mg IV x 1, and increased her metoprolol PO 12.5 bid to tid, which did not slow down her HR; she was given Ditilzam 10mg IV x 1 and continued her with ditilzam IV infusion, which brought her HR to 70's and back to NSR.
She was given lasix IV prn for fluid overload and kept her on lopressor PO 12.5 tid which was converted to atenolol 25mg PO qday for rate control.
Her tachycardia resolved after diuresis and increased bblock dosage and her HR has been mainly in the 70-80's since [**8-14**].
We continued advair and atrovent nebs PRN and diuresed her prn to prevent fluid overload.
GERD - on protonix 40mg PO qday.

It is essential that you take all your medications as prescribed, in pariticular your cardiac medications (ASA, plavix, atenolol, lisinopril, and atorvostatin).
You have been started in plavix and aspirin.
You MUST take these two medications without fail.
If you stop taking these medications even for one day, you are at high risk for having your stent close off and causing a heart attack.
