The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2136-4-20**] where the patient underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting times two and mitral valve repair.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
His pressure was labile and a few hours out of the operating room he had increased chest tube output and dropped his hematocrit.
He returned to the operating room for reexploration of surgical bleeding.
His pressors were weaned off over 24-48hrs.
Both a KUB and CT scan of the abdomen indicated possible early small bowel obstruction, therefore he was made NPO, an nasal gastric tube was placed and he was seen by general surgery.

His chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
