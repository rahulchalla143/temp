He presented to the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Room at 4:00 and noted to have ST elevations in V1 through V4 and reciprocal inferior depressions, given IV Nitroglycerin, morphine, Plavix, aspirin without resolution of the pain, and transferred emergently to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.
The patient required dopamine and Neo drips, as well as intra-arterial balloon pump.
The patient had runs of VT and was started on lidocaine drip.
The patient was started on bivalirudin and low dose heparin for anticoagulation.
On admission to the CCU, the patient was pain-free and comfortable, and no shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, lightheadedness, on lido, dopa, neo, heparin, bivalirudin drips.
GI bleed, status post colonoscopy in [**2101-1-30**] with diverticulosis.
TIA, ?CVA with residual left-sided findings without any palsy.
MEDS AT HOME: 1.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  He is afebrile with an arterial blood pressure of 95/57, PA pressure 39/20, heart rate 110, respiratory rate 18, sats 94% on 2 liters.
In general, he was pleasant, alert, in no acute distress, with flattened bed with intra-arterial balloon pump in place.
Intra-arterial balloon pump in the right groin.
1) CAD:  He was stable after cath on bivalirudin and heparin.
His enzymes were followed, and he was continued on aspirin, anticoagulation and Plavix for his recent stent.
He was also continued on his statin which was titrated to a maximal dose which he tolerated fine.
He subsequently underwent stenting of the LCX and RCA.
2) CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  The patient initially came in under cardiogenic shock and was initially on Neo-Synephrine and dopamine drips, in addition to the interatrial balloon pump, which he tolerated well.
Eventually, the patient had an echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of [**10-14**]%, and the patient was started on vasodilators and beta blockers for his cardiac regimen, as he was off pressors, and his blood pressure was stable.
He was initially started on low dose ACE and low dose Toprol XL, and was started on Coumadin for prophylaxis for LV thrombus, in light of his large MI and decreased wall motion abnormality.
The patient will actually go home on Lovenox, as he will return for an ICD placement per the electrophysiology team secondary to his low EF and episodes of NSVT.
The patient did have an episode of atrial tachycardia during the course of his stay which did respond to low dose beta blockers, and again the patient will return for ICD placement.
The patient was also started and loaded on digoxin which he will continue.
VT post MI - he was initially on lido drip secondary to this and this was weaned, and the patient's VT remained stable.
Eventually was restarted on his home regimen which was titrated up, and this can be continued to be monitored closely upon DC.
For patient' atrial fibrillation, he was converted with amiodarone and milrinone which was eventually discontinued.
Amiodarone was eventually weaned off as well, and the patient remained in sinus with occasional episodes of atrial tachycardia as described above.
The patient was seen by physical therapy and recommended continued rehabilitation for deconditioning after his MI.
Thrombocytopenia: resolved after unfractionated heparin was discontinued.
Deconditioned requiring cardiac rehabilitation.
