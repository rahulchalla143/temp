On the day of admission to the OSH, the patient developed abdominal pain and vomiting and was admitted for further work-up.
A femoral line was placed as PIV access, and a RIJ were unable to be obtained.
She had progressive respiratory distress and was then intubated for airway protection.
She was transferred to the OSH ICU for presumed aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, ARF and respiratory failure.
At the OSH, the patient was started levofloxacin/timentin/vancomycin, OG tube was placed, was given IVF, and was placed on steroids.
Per her mother, she has no seizure history, but is maintained on valproate, and was restarted on this at the OSH.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management of her renal failure and possible sepsis.
When the patient arrived she was on a propofol gtt, and was having tongue and eyelid fasciculations.
Past Medical History: - Diabetes Mellitus type 1 (dx at age 3), hx of hypoglycemic episodes - CVA (hemorrhagic) at 27 with residual aphasia and r-hemiparesis, tracheostomy post CVA now decannulated.
- blindness in one eye - history of aspiration pneumonia - although patient is on valproate, no reported history of stroke - depression  Social History: remote smoking history at age 18, lived in CA and has lived at the Greenery since coming to MA.
Imaging: EEG Study Date of [**2166-6-11**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured six pushbutton activations, but they showed the same background as on routine sampling.
ET tube appears in good position well above the trachea.
Guide wire was advanced through the existing torn GJ tube under constant fluoroscopic guidance, and a new 18 French x 45 cm MIC GJ tube was exchanged over the wire.
The balloon was inflated with approximately 10 cc of saline and contrast, and the tube was secured to the skin with Flexi-Trak.
Patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.
7/20:07: CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is a right subclavian central line with its tip in the right atrium.
There is a tracheostomy tube in place.
Small amount of air is present in the urinary bladder likely due to a Foley catheter in place.
Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications involving coronary arteries, aorta, and multiple other intraabdominal vessels.
The tracheostomy tube and right subclavian catheter remain in place.
Pt was initially on levofloxacin for 5 days and then changed over to Zosym 4.5 g q6h (currently day [**1-18**]) for broader coverage.
She was also being diuresed, initially with Lasix gtt then boluses) as tolerated by her renal function.
She is also on albuterol and atrovent nebs.
Tracheostomy was placed on [**6-21**] and attempts were made to decrease ventilator settings.
However, as the patient's pneumonia was treated and she was diuresed, transition to pressure support was possible.
She has been stable on pressure support ventilation.
Diuresis should be maintained as the patient has persistent lower extremity edema and improved respiratory status with diuresis.
She had had decreased output to the lasix on last day of admission, and bumex could be considered with thiazide to improve diuresis.
However, despite antibiotics that were tailored to culture sensitivities her fevers were unchanged.
Her central line was changed over a wire, and a number of medications were stopped.
Eosinophilia developed over several days as well as urine eosinophils.
Therefore all medications that were potentially pyrogenic medications were discontinued, with last discontinued medications meropenem and vancomycin.
As well her central line was removed.
After these interventions, her temperature was less than <101 for greater than 48 hours.
DMI:  Initially despite insulin gtt, pt tends to have labile blood sugars.
However, once the patient was on a stable tube feeding regimen, the glucose levels were somewhat better controlled.
[**Last Name (un) **] consult directed the care of the patient amd recommended glargine 24 Units at bedtime.
Hypothyroidism (TSH 0.02, fT4 3.9):  Pt started on methimazol 5 mg po bid on [**6-18**].
This dose should be continued for now, but levels should be checked daily until she is therapeutic and then after as determined by overseeing physician.
Chronic anemia:  She had persistent anemia and occasionally required transfusions to keep her hct above 21.
ARF, now resolved at baseline Cr of 1.0:  Pt's Cr had increased during hospital stay with aggressive diuresing.
Furosemide was held for past 3 days with return of Cr to baseline.
Pt is on metoprolol (increased to 175 [**Hospital1 **] [**6-18**]) and diltiazem.
Pt was also restarted on home dosing of lisinopril 10 qd on [**6-18**] that was increased to 20 mg.
However, if continues to be elevated, would recommended increasing BP meds.
Depression:  Stable on fluoxetine initially, as above this was stopped in an attempt to determine the cause of her fevers.
Prophylaxis:  Patient was maintained on heparin subcutaneous, pneumoboots, proton pump inhibitor and bowel meds .
