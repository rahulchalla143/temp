Admission Date:  [**2132-8-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2132-8-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2132-6-25**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Neonatology  HISTORY:  This is a discharge  summary for [**Known lastname 122**] [**Known lastname **], triplet #2, who was admitted from home on [**2132-8-7**], day of life #42 for apnea.
On admission, the infant was noted to have nasal congestion, a cough, frequent apnea with desaturation requiring initially blow-by oxygen and then nasopharyngeal continuous positive airway pressure.
The pregnancy was complicated by mild pregnancy-induced hypertension and antepartum hemorrhage leading to cesarean section.
His neonatal course was notable for surfactant deficiency requiring only continuous positive airway pressure, apnea of prematurity, cardiac murmur followed clinically, initial sepsis rule out, mild hyperbilirubinemia with peak bilirubin of 8.6, choroid plexus cyst on cranial ultrasound (otherwise normal), normal ophthalmological exam.
Initially, hypotonic, but improving tone.
NICU COURSE BY SYSTEM: Respiratory status:  He was placed on nasopharyngeal continuous positive airway pressure at the time of admission.
That was discontinued at 24 hours after admission and he was weaned to nasal cannula oxygen, where he remains at the time of transfer of care requiring 13-25 cc flow.
He has some scattered coarseness and nasal congestion.
He had a nasopharyngeal swab sent for viral cultures, which were negative , and he had nasal washings sent for respiratory syncytial virus that also was negative.
Infant remained in nasal cannula from day of admission untl [**8-12**] and then occasionally required oxygen for feedings, but remained in RA even for feedings for 1 week prior to discharge.
Cardiovascular: He initially required an 8occ bolus of normal saline for a  mean blood pressure of 36 a the time of admission and has remained normotensive since that time.
He has  had  an intermittent grade 1-2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard over precordium and may be consistant with PPS or flow, and this has been followed clinically and  softer following packed RBC transfusion.
At the time of admission, he was started on IV fluid.
He has since weaned to formal feeding of Enfamil AR on an adlib schedule taking approximately 200 cc/kg/day.
He was having frequent desaturations with and after feeds, consistent with GI reflux.
He had a transfusion of packed red blood cells.
Infectious disease status:  At the time of readmission, [**Known lastname 122**] was started on ampicillin, gentamicin, and Vancomycin.
He had a spinal tap prior to the initiation of antibiotics, which had one white blood cell and one red blood cell, and the cultures remained negative.
His antibiotics were discontinued after 72 hours when the infant was clinically improved and his blood cultures remained negative.
