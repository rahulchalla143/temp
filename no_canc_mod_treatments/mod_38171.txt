The left ventricular functon is moderately depressed (LVEF ~30-35%) with global hypokinesis, inferior akinesis and inferobasal akinesis/dyskinesis.
A swan-ganz catheter was placed and numbers were consistent with hypovolemia with a small element of heart failure.
Pt underwent fluid resuscitation and was placed on dopamine with good response and improvement in renal function, and Levaquin was started for possible sepsis/pulm infection.
Small bump in CK and Troponin postulated secondary to demand ischemia.
On hopital day 4, it was felt that he may be volume overloaded after fluid resuscitation in setting of CHF with elevated CVP, PAPD, and also was demonstrating low SVR likely due to sepsis.
Decreased UOP this day was thought to be due to low perfusion in setting of elevated preload and so he was placed back on renal dose dopamine and given lasix for diuresis until his numbers were consistent with euvolemia.
He was soon after weaned off all pressors and extubated.
Pulmonary was consulted for episodes of hypercarbia during sleep, bipap was suggested but refused by patient.
He had an episode of atrial fibrillation with short reponse to 100J cardioversion, was started on amiodorone and then converted spontaneously.
He was later placed on Metoprolol as well.
