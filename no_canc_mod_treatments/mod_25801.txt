Impression: This is a 68 year old man visiting MA from [**Country 11150**], history of chordoma of the clivus s/p resection x 2 and XRT with  diplopia at baseline who presents with meningitis both clinically and by LP results, preceeded by clear leakage from the nose (CSF?)
- will treat broadly with vanco, ceftriaxone, ampicillin and flagyl at meningitic doses, renally dosed - follow CSF cx data from [**Hospital1 **] - pan culture if spikes - consult ID tonight re: managment, antibiotic choices - ENT called from [**Location **] to consult re: need for evaluation of CSF leak.
- check CXR for infiltrates, TB nodules - swab throat for strep, culture - tylenol for fever, pain - airborne precautions - q 2 hr neuro checks, watch for complications of meningitis including stroke,venous thrombosis, abscess/empyema, change in neurologic exam, seizures, further decline in mental status.
- IVF for now with q 12 hr na checks  4.
Asthma - prn albuterol  5.
PPx: protonix, SC heparin, pneumoboots, inspiration spirometer FEN: house diet, IVF FULL CODE Dispo: pending workup   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Image-guided endoscopic sinus surgery with endoscopic repair of left cribriform plate cerebrospinal fluid leak with left superior turbinate graft and repair of sella turcica cerebrospinal fluid CSF leak with left middle turbinate.
This has happened in the past, and although this fluid has never been confirmed to be CSF (per wife) he was treated with antibiotics.
Workup was done at [**Hospital1 **] that included temp 104 degrees F, WBC  21K, LP consistent with bacterial meningitis (was given 2 grams CTX, 1 gram vanco, and here given 1 gram ampicillin and 500mg flagyl) and CT head that suggests a communication of the brain with the sphenoid sinus.
No recent instrumentation of his sinuses, last surgery on chordoma was in [**2157**].
Past Medical History: 1. s/p transsphenoidal chordoma resection x 2 in [**Country 11150**], [**2144**] and  [**2157**].

There has been destruction or resection of a portion of the posterior nasal septum.
FINDINGS: The patient is status post clival surgery, with bone destruction at clivus, and the posterior wall of the sphenoid sinuses, as described previously.
Bilateral mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: Status post clival surgery, with bony destruction of clivus and posterior wall of the sphenoid, as described previously, with air-fluid level within the residual sphenoid sinus.
was treated for presumed bacterial meningitis (CSF AFB was still pending at that time) and had +LP.
ENT, Neurosurg consulted because of patient history of chordoma s/p resection x2 and recent history of clear nasal drainage.
Both services recommended imaging and no surgery until patient's clinical condition stabilized and improved.
Patient continued to have CSF nasal drainge and temperature spike through POD#7.
Antibiotcs were cut down to Ceftazidime and Vancomycin to treat most likely agents HD#4.
Antibiotics were continued for 21 days.
Surgical repair was indicated to stop leak and prevent superinfection.
Lumbar drain was placed pre-operatively by neurosurgery.
Image-guided endoscopic sinus surgery with endoscopic repair of left cribriform plate cerebrospinal fluid leak with left superior turbinate graft and repair of sella turcica cerebrospinal fluid CSF leak with left middle turbinate.
Lumbar drain was clamped at day 5, pulled on day 7. post-op day 5, patient was allowed to ambulate, and later in the day complained of salty taste dripping down his posterior pharynx, concerning for a csf leak.
