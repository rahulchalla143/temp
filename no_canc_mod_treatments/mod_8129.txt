ACTIVE ISSUES: #Acute on chronic CHF and bilateral pleural effusions: Pt was admitted in [**6-/2167**] and ECHO at that time showed LVEF Of 30-35%.
She was intitially treated with a lasix drip with improvement in her oxygen requirement.
Nitrates and morphine were held in the setting of hypotension.
Interventional pulmonology was consulted and bilateral pigtail catheters were insterted and drained a total of 1.5L of pleural fluid which was culture negative (AFB culture only pending at the time of discharge).
She will be discharged on torsemide 10 mg PO daily for volume control, and has been educated in low-sodium diet by nutrition consult team.
She is not on [**Last Name (un) **] given borderline-low blood pressures, but current plan is for addition of [**Last Name (un) **] once stable on outpatient follow up.
She may also benefit from spironolactone or low-dose digoxin if chronically symptomatic.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt hypotensive to 77 and started on dopamine drip.
Given tachycardia and episodes of Afib dopamine was changed to vasopressin.
On day 3, pt successfully weaned off pressors and SBPs remained stable throughout the remainder of admission.
She was placed on subQ heparin during this stay, and aspirin dose was increased to 325 mg. Current plan is for anticoagulation with aspirin and Plavix alone to reduce risk of clot.
During this admission, the patient was initially in sinus rhythm on telemetry but subsequently developed multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rate to 100s-110s.
Her metoprolol was uptitrated as pressures would allow, and she was discharged on 200 mg metoprolol sucinate daily.
Amiodarone was suggested to improve rhythm/rate control; however her daughter is concerned that this medication was responsible for a skin reaction during a prior admission and did not want her mother to receive this medication.
In the future, amiodarone may be considered if there is poor rate control with current dose of metoprolol succinate as blood pressures may not tolerate further uptitration.
Her PM beta blocker was held, and U/A and culture were rechecked.
She was started on 10 day course of cefpodoxime on [**2167-8-23**].
# Anticoagulation/hematoma: INR elevated on admission at 4.7 and her coumadin was held.
Patient was treated with vitamin K for pigtail catheter placement.
Pt developed hematoma in R. arm after attempted PICC line placement.
Pressure dressings were applied.
Heparin was stopped.
Cardiac enzymes peaked at CKMB 8 and troponin 0.28.
Pt was changed from ASA 81 to 325 and continued on plavix, atorvastatin and metoprolol.
# Diabetes Mellitus: -She remained on insulin SS for the majority of her hosptial course, but home metformin and glipizide were restarted prior to discharge.
She will be sent to rehab for a brief period, with plans to return home where she is overseen by her daughter, who is very involved.
- Pleural fluid (left and right side) AFB cultures were pending at the time of discharge (AFB smear negative) - Urine culture from [**2167-8-25**] pending at the time of discharge (U/A from [**2167-8-25**] showed 154 WBC, +LE, -nitrites, -bacteria, +yeast) - For her systolic heart failure, she should be started on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient as blood pressures allow.
- For her atrial fibrillation, her warfarin has been held given the risk of bleeding with concurrent aspirin and clopidogrel.
Her metoprolol succinate has been uptitrated to 200 mg PO daily but may require further titration depending on blood pressure and rates while in atrial fibrillation.
Amiodarone was briefly initiated but stopped based upon family's concern that this medication caused rash and malaise during a prior admission.
It may be appropriate to re-consider use of this medication in the future if rate control proves difficult.

You had an acute exacerbation of your congestive heart failure and required bipap ventilation and furosemide intravenously to get rid of the extra fluid.
We have increased the metoprolol to prevent a fast heart rate and your warfarin has been discontinued because you are already on 2 other strong blood thinners.
Increase metoprolol to slow your heart rate 2.
Decrease atorvastatin to lower your cholesterol 3.
Discontinue warfarin, you will get some protection from blood clots from the aspirin and plavix 4.
Start senna and metamucil to prevent constipation 5.
