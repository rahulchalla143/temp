The patient was transported to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on neo-synephrine and Propofol infusions.
The patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation on his first postoperative night requiring low dose neo-synephrine.
On the evening of postoperative day number one the patient was noted to have a moderate amount of chest tube drainage and a drop in hematocrit.
A chest tube was inserted into the right pleural space with immediate drainage of about 500 cc of bloody fluid with fair resolution by chest x-ray.
The patient continued to have a drop in hematocrit and a thoracic surgery consult was obtained.
Thoracic surgery felt that the postoperative bleeding was self limiting.
The patient was again transfused packed red blood cells and given Lasix and the patient's hematocrit over the next several days began to climb.
The patient was started on Lopressor.
Postoperative day number four one of the patient's chest tubes were removed and the other was placed to water seal.
On postoperative day number five the patient's last remaining right pleural chest tube was removed and post removal chest x-ray showed unchanged from previous chest x-rays, which was small bilateral effusions right greater then left, elevated right hemidiaphragm, right middle and right lower lobe atelectasis and a small right apical pneumothorax.
The patient ambulated with physical therapy and was able to climb one flight of stairs and walk 500 feet while remaining hemodynamically stable and without requiring oxygen and the patient was cleared for discharge to home.
The chest tube site is covered with a dry sterile dressing, which is to be removed on [**4-19**].
