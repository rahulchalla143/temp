The patient presented to the ED with a 100 % O2 saturation on NRB and no room air saturation was recorded.
She was initially placed on a ntg gtt with minimal response in BP.
She was also started on labetalol.
Given her fever and bandemia she was treated for pneumonia with ceftriaxone and clindamycin (suspected aspiration).
She was briefly started on bipap and then switched to NRB but continued to be tachypneic in the ED to 40's although satting well and MICU evaluation was called.

Tx for PNA w/ceftriaxone and clindamycin.
Pt also developed new atrial fibrillation in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], controlled w/dilt drip which was transitioned to metop PO.
Pt also failed speech/swallow study in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] so IR placed NGT which was kept in place for 2 days with tube feeding.

Pt was continued on metoptolol with good BP control and this was changed to daily atenolol at discharge.
Post-pyloric NGT placed by IR [**11-22**] for temporary feeding.
After extensive discussion about aspiration risk of allowing pt to eat vs role of food for pt's comfort and quality of remaining life, family (including healthcare proxy) decided to allow pt to eat pureed and thickened foods (with full aspiration precautions such as having pt upright when taking POs).
Pt was on RISS for hyperglycemia during hospitalization but this was discontinued at discharge due to stable FS glucose.
