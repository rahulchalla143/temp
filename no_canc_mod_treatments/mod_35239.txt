A G-tube projects over the left upper quadrant.
Bilateral perinephric fat stranding in the anterior pararenal space, nonspecific, is unchanged.
The indwelling PEG tube is malpositioned, with the balloon partially intralumenal and partially in the subcutaneous track.
A small amount of stool is noted in the rectal vault, with unchanged appearance of perirectal fat stranding and minimally prominent rectal wall.
Right jugular line ends in the SVC.
The patient did not require pressor support or intubation.
He was found to have an E.Coli/Staph Aureus UTI which was initially covered with Vanc/Zosyn/Cefepime and transitioned to Bactrim prior to transfer back to the general medical floor.
After initial volume repletion, the patient was transitioned to an insulin gtt and D5W to correct hyperglycemia and hypernatremia.
Over a 72 hour period his Na was reduced from 160 to 146 and his insulin was transitioned to lantus with sliding scale.
His donepezil was discontinued and his heart rate normalized to the 60s.
# Hypotension/Fever: His hypotention initially resolved with IVF in the ICU.
Once BP began to normalize, baclofen and flomax were resumed.
Pt was treated with Vanc/Zosyn/Cefepime initially in the ICU,and then tailored to bactrim to treat his staph aureus/E Coli UTI.
His antibiotic coverage was extended to Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl for broad abdominal/pulmonary/urologic coverage, and he was bolused 4 L NS.
His baclofen and flomax were again stopped.
Discussion of pacemaker was not pursued at this time in the setting of infection, but if pt has persistent pauses or symptoms, then pacemaker discussion may need to occur in the future.
He was admitted with a foley in place (had chronic foley since [**3-4**]), which may be the culprit.
Initially was treated with Vanc/Cefepime/Zosyn, but tailored down to bactrim based on urine sensitivities.
This second culture on antibiotics came back negative.
He was also managed on sliding scale insulin.
# Pulmonary edema: Pt had noted edema on CXR on [**2115-5-26**] after 4 L NS fluid resuscitation.
No Lasix was given due to low BP initially.
On day of discharge [**5-29**], pt had increased wheezing and crackles in his lungs on exam (still satting 98% RA), so given Lasix 10 mg IV x1.
As BP tolerates, pt may need some gentle diuresis after the aggressive fluid resuscitation he received here.
Lisinopril was held and pt was given IVF.
He will need frequent ulcer monitoring, turning in bed, etc.
# PEG tube replacement: Pts PEG tube fell out on [**2115-5-26**] after returning from CT scan.
His tubefeeds were held and his PEG tube was replaced by IR on [**2115-5-27**].
Nutrition recommended adding benefiber to his tube feeds.
He is on ASA 81 mg daily.
Can consider anticoagulation as outpatient given that his greatest risk of fall is with the [**Doctor Last Name 2598**] lift, which is a modifiable risk factor.
Diarrhea also was slowing by time of discharge so his rectal tube was removed.
