Admission Date:  [**2129-1-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-2-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-11-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Macrobid / Betadine  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**] Chief Complaint: OSH transfer for bilateral pulmonary embolism.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central Venous Catheter placement Arterial Line placement IVC filter placement  History of Present Illness: This is a 51-year-old female status-post recent bilateral breast reduction surgery complicated by infection status-post recent discharge from OSH for chest pain presented to OSH in PEA arrest with PE on CT scan status-post thrombolytics.
Patient underwent bilateral breast reduction surgery several weeks ago prior to this admission.
Patient was recently admitted and discharged day prior to admission from [**Location (un) 745**]-Wellesly for left sided chest pain, which was attributed to neuropathic post surgical pain.
In the field EMS performed CPR for 20 minutes, she received 3 rounds of Epi and Atropine and responded with a rhythm of sinus tachycardia.
She again responded with sinus tachycardia.
She then coded again and received CPR for another 2 minutes with a round of epi.
Patient was given tPA at 725 and finished at 925am.
She was also started on Levophed given hypotension to 70s.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was started on Heparin gtt at 930am.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unable to obtain [**3-1**] intubation status.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY s/p bilateral breast reduction [**2128-12-16**] s/p excicion dermatofibroma [**2116**]   Social History: Unable to obtain [**3-1**] intubation status  Family History: Unable to obtain [**3-1**] intubation status  Physical Exam: Admission: BP= 114/101, HR=119, RR=19, O2= 100% GENERAL: Obese Caucasian Female intubated in NARD.
Low-lying endotracheal tube, only 1.2 cm above the carina.
Abnormal catheter or wire like fragment projecting over the right heart border, extending into the liver.
If there is no wire or catheter fragment external to the patient which could project in this position, this finding is worrisome for a retained catheter or wire fragment, possibly located within the SVC, extending into a hepatic vein.
Lateral chest radiograph is recommended for correlation.
Distention may be due to stool retention.
[**2129-1-30**] Bleeding scan Final Report RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA: 14.4 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m RBC ([**2129-1-30**]); HISTORY:51 yo F with ongoing bloody bowel movements and falling Hct.
INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-99m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were obtained.
A PICC line is present in the left cephalic vein.
PT: 22.5  PTT: 89.7  INR: 2.1   Brief Hospital Course: Middle Aged Female status-post recent bilateral breast reduction c/b infection s/p recent discharge for MSK chest pain p/w PEA arrest s/p multiple cycles of Atropine/Epi likely [**3-1**] PE s/p thrombolytics on pressors, intubated, heparin gtt.
Patient was supported initially with pressors including levophed and neosynephrine.
She was felt to be preload dependent and was aggressively treated with IV fluids.
Clot was busted with TPA, then patient was supported on heparin ggt.
LARGE PE STATUS-POST THROMBOLYTICS: Patient noted to have a large PE on CT scan likely [**3-1**] immobile status s/p surgery with poor wound healing followed by cervical disc herniation where she was immobile.
Due to her PEA arrest she underwent thrombolytic therapy which ended at 9:25 Am on the day of admission.
Thereafter, she was started on heparin gtt, but had bleeding complications which subsided off heparin in the ICU during which time an IVC filter was placed.
She was eventually moved to warfarin therapy.
Low molecular weight heparin therapy was not given because of the uncertain absorption and therapeutic benefit in obese patients, which she is, as well as need for observation on anticoagulation considering patient's bleeding complications (GI bleed and breast surgical sites).
She is referred to hematologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3060**] to determine the optimal length of therapy on warfarin, given her cardiac arrest, and 13 PRBC bleed experienced.
She was also discharged with lovenox to take if her INR is <2.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Pt noted to be unresponsive initially on examination with no sedation on board.
However during her central line placement she was localizing pain.
She was transferred back to the ICU where she recieved another total 7 units PRBCs tranfusion.
Heparin was held while an IVC filter was placed, her blood count stabilized, and heparin was re-initiated given high risk complications from PE.
Continued observation on heparin alone demonstrated stable HCT without further bleeding.
Warfarin was initiated slowly so as not to overshoot the INR.
This was thought due to hypoperfusion with cardiac arrest.
She was treated with a course of levaquin given that outside cultures grew: strep faecalis, proteus and pseudomonas.
A supportive bra was used for patient comfort.
Levofloxacin was later tapered to Keflex for prophylaxis per Plastics request, which she tolerated well (completed 10 day course).
She was discharged on WTD dressings daily, and should follow up with plastic surgery as soon as possible.
Cervical radiculopathy:  She was started on neurontin and tramadol to help control arm pain related to her cervical radiculopathy with improvement.

[**Name Initial (NameIs) **]:*14 syringes* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility:  [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Cardiac Arrest Bilateral Pulmonary Embolism Lower GI Bleed, acute blood loss anemia Hypertension, benign   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to hospital (ICU) after cardiac arrest due to bilateral pulmonary embolism for which you were treated with clot busting medications at an outside hospital.
You were continued on anticoagulants, but experienced episodes of bleeding from your surgical breast wounds and from your GI tract, which required you to be in ICU on several occasions.
All in all, you received 13 units of red blood cells (6 the first ICU admission, and 7 the second ICU admission), and 2 units of cryoprecipitate (the first ICU admission).
You were moved back out to the medical floor, where warfarin therapy was begun.
Because of the complexities of your case, you have been referred to a hematolgy thrombus specialist to help determine the length of your therapy and whether your IVC filter should come out at all.
START: --Coumadin 8mg daily.
