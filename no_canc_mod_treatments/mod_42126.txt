Admission Date:  [**2138-6-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-6-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-4-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Allergies/ADRs on File  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: transfer from [**Hospital3 635**] hospital  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intra-aortic balloon pump removal endotracheal tube extubation   History of Present Illness: 68-year-old male with history of HTN who presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**6-3**] with substernal chest pain and shortness of breath.
He was taken to CCath which showed 100% proximal LAD stenosis, 95% diffuse ostial ramus stenosis, 90% proximal circumflex stenosis, 100% ostial marginal 1 and 2 stenosis and 100% thrombus of RCA.
Cardiac surgery was called, however, he decompensated and underwent PCI.
A thrombectomy was attempted and failed.
He underwent BMS placement to RCA and circumflex.
He was intubated for respiratory failure and given IV lasix.
His hypotension was managed with high-dose dopamine.
Intra-aortic balloon pump placement.
He was given amiodarone bolus and drip.
His pressors were changed from dopamine to levophed and neosynephrine.
He was treated with integrillin and heparin.
No beta blocker secondary to hemodynamic status.
In the CCU, he was given another bolus of 80mg IV lasix.
He was noted to have some oral bleeding and blood in his NG tube so protonix drip was started.
Upon arrival to CCU, the patient was stable with balloon pump in the L groin, PA catheter in R femoral central line, on moderate doses of levophed and neosynephrine and amiodarone.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unable to assess due to intubation   Past Medical History: - hypertension - narcolepsy - s/p splenectomy   Social History: Married.
endotracheal tube in place.
IMPRESSION: Borderline enlarged LV size and wall thickness, with severe regional LV systlolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
?s balloon pump removed [**6-6**], did well without any LV support.
Was weaned off pressors successfully.
HRs elevated in the 100s, increased metoprolol 25mg PO bid.
Anticoagulated with heparin and bridged to coumadin (INR goal [**2-21**]) for LV thrombus prevention.
Cardiac medication regimen adjusted to include prasugrel 10mg [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325, warfarin 4mg qd, atorvastatin 80mg qd, metoprolol succinate 25mg daily, lisinopril 10mg daily, eplerenone 25mg daily, lasix 40 mg qd PO.
Of note, the patient's warfarin dose was increased from 2 to 4mg per day, because the patient's INR decreased to 1.9 on [**2138-6-14**].
Please track INR (next check on [**5-17**]), and adjust coumadin dose for a goal INR of [**2-21**], for prevention of LV thrombus.
Pressors were weaned off and aortic balloon pump was discontinued.
TTE on [**6-11**] showed mild to moderate MR due to leaflet tethering, thus lisinopril was increased from 5mg to 10mg daily to reduce afterload.
See cardiac medications above.
Patient did well with assist control with PEEP 15.
Given high risk, treated for VAP for 8 day course of vancomycin/cefepime.
Repeat CXR s/p diuresis still did not show VAP.
Repeat CXR showed focal RLL consolidation but this was felt to likely be post-extubation aspiration pneumonitis as his fever curve and WBC trended down.
Patient should have every other day INR checked at rehab, with coumadin adjusted accordingly, for a goal INR of [**2-21**] for prevention of LV thrombus.
