Cardiac catheterization was done on [**7-21**], which showed left ejection fraction of 50%, right main occluded, left anterior descending coronary artery occluded, left circumflex occluded, right circumflex occluded, saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending coronary artery 95% stenosis.
At that point the patient was urgently referred to CT surgery for further evaluation.

The electric physiology service decided since the patient seemed to be pretty well controlled on oral medication and had not required pacing for over 24 hours.
She does not need a permanent pacemaker at this time.
Her Lopressor dose will be slowly turned down to a goal of 50 mg b.i.d.
