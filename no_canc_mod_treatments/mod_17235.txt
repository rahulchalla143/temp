The patient received the majority of his care at [**Hospital6 14430**] and has been managed well there since [**2090**].
At that time, the patient had a work-up for a liver transplant initiated and in [**2102-3-19**] he was noted to be Child's Class C with a score of 10 and found to have a large mediastinal lymphadenopathy that was concerning for lymphoma.
He was given morphine and Ativan and found to have an elevated white blood cell count with 14% bands.
The patient subsequently developed hypotension with a blood pressure in the 70s over 20, at which time he was started on the sepsis protocol in the Emergency Department.
He received three liters of intravenous fluids and transiently given phenylephrine.
The patient was given antibiotic treatment for a presumed pneumonia that could not be visualized and white blood cell count improved but lower extremity pain persisted.
Lasix 80 mg a day.
Glipizide XL 5 mg q. day.
Tamsulosin 0.4 mg a day.
Neurontin 300 mg three times a day.
Protonix 40 mg q. day.
Nadolol 10 mg q. day.
Aldactone 50 mg three times a day.
Fentanyl patch 25 micrograms applied on the day of admission.
IMPRESSION:  The impression at admission was for hypotension concerning for sepsis and encephalopathy and possible fentanyl overdose.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and blood pressure stabilized and after ruling out infection, white count normalized with fluids and it was felt that the patient had dehydration encephalopathy and hypotension induced by Fentanyl patch placement.
This was increased to 50 micrograms which did not help his pain, which was then increased to 75 micrograms which did not change his pain management at all.
Concomitantly, the patient received Oxycodone of 10 to 20 mg q. four hours p.r.n.
The patient was given gentle diuresis for edema of the ankles, but room air saturations remained normal and the patient had no evidence for ascites.
The patient was maintained on fluid restriction at 1500 cc and Lasix 40 mg a day was given by mouth.
This was presumed to be due to prerenal state given a physical examination consistent with dehydration.
The patient received normal saline with subsequent correction of creatinine.
There was concern that he was having a current exacerbation of his vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia at this time causing lower extremity pain.
Physical Therapy was given and on subsequent days the patient reported that his pain seemed to be symptomatically better despite decreasing fentanyl patch dosages down to 50 micrograms q. day and decreasing breakthrough pain medications of Oxycodone down to 10 mg up to three doses per day.
Due to the consideration that the pain was due to meralgia paresthetica complicated by diabetic neuropathy complicated by exacerbation of L5-S1 radiculopathy, the patient was instructed to continue Physical Therapy and have home Physical Therapy and continue pain management.
If pain was not noted to improve with Physical Therapy and ambulation, the patient should follow-up to have nerve biopsies to rule out vasculitis or some other nerve pathology.
HEPATITIS C, CIRRHOSIS, HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY:  The patient was maintained on spironolactone and Lasix diuresis.
The patient periodically became encephalopathic and lactulose was increased at these times with the goal of three to five bowel movements per day which resulted in normalization of mental status.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  For infectious disease issues, the patient did receive Levofloxacin, Flagyl and Vancomycin for three days while in the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient appeared clinically non-toxic and did not receive empiric antibiotic therapy.
This was rechecked and there was no evidence for red blood cells or protein which ruled out concern for cryoglobulinemia or vasculitis involving kidneys.
Heparin was given subcutaneously initially and was held.
DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2:  For diabetes mellitus type 2, the patient was maintained on glyburide 2.5 mg q. day.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.  protonix 40 mg q. day.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.
Glipizide 2.5 mg q. day.
Spironolactone 50 mg p.o.
Lidocaine patches to bilateral thighs for 12 hours q. day.
Tamsulosin 0.4 mg q.
Gabapentin 1000 mg p.o.
Nadolol 10 mg q. day.
Fentanyl patch 50 micrograms per hour q.
