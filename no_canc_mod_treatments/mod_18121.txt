HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for a pancreatic abscess status post gallstone pancreatitis, made NPO, placed on IV fluids, and Zosyn was started.
The patient's laboratories on admission included a hematocrit of 24.4, for which the patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
On hospital day three, the patient received a PICC line and began receiving TPN with the expectation that she would go to the OR once her nutritional status was improved.
The patient continued to be afebrile with Zosyn and TPN until she was taken to the OR on hospital day 11 ([**2169-6-20**]).
On [**2169-6-20**], the patient underwent an open cholecystectomy along with open drainage of the pancreatic pseudocyst.
Patient tolerated the procedure well.
They later came back with vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus.
The patient was presumptively treated with Zosyn and fluconazole postoperatively.
In the course of the operation, the patient required a total of 10 liters of fluid and due to low urine output postoperatively, the patient continued to require ongoing fluids to maintain her urine output.
Because of the large quantity of fluids required, patient was kept intubated and sedated for several days.
On postoperative day two with a hematocrit of 27, the patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
On postoperative day three, the patient's TPN was restarted and the patient was begun on vancomycin along with Zosyn and fluconazole.
On postoperative day three, diuresis was begun and the patient was a net negative 2 liters for the day.
This level of diuresis continued to through postoperative day nine as the patient remained in the ICU, that is to say she lost approximately 1.5 to 2 liters per day during that period.
On [**6-26**], a routine rectal swab showed vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus in the patient's rectum, however, it was not thought that the patient required any change in her antibiotics, so she was kept on Zosyn and vancomycin, the fluconazole haven been stopped a few days prior.
On postoperative day 13, the patient's wound was noted to have a bit of cellulitis on the right and was therefore opened and packed with wet-to-dry dressing.
Patient was continued on her TPN and tube feeds were begun.
However, those tube feeds were relatively short-lived and the patient was started on a clear diet on postoperative day 14 and sent to a floor.
Also all of her oral medications were restarted.
