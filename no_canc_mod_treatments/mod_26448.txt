Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo with a ESRD on HD, with recent prolonged hospitalization for incarcerated hernia, complicated by ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia recently on Vancomycin and Meropenem, who presents with dyspnea while at HD.
He was ruled out for flu after initial treatment with Tamiflu.
His antibiotics were discontinued and he remained without dyspnea.
He also underwent a video swallow and his diet was changed to ground solids and nectar thick liquids.
Vancomycin and Meropenem were due to be completed on [**1-28**].
His antibiotics were ultimately stopped and he showed no symptoms of recurrence.
His PICC line was removed during this hospitalization.
# ESRD on HD: He was continued on hemodialysis.
His ACE-I was increased during this admission for hypertension.
He may benefit from being switched to longer-acting medications after discharge as he is currently on captopril and other shorter-acting antihypertensives that may reduce medication compliance.
# H/o multiple prior CVAs: His Coumadin was held upon admission due to concern for possible alveolar hemorrhage but was restarted during his hospitalization.
His dose was increased due to subtherapeutic INRs and he will need to have his INR monitored closely after discharge.
