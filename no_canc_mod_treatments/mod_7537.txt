He had taken aspirin and nitroglycerin and had no relief.
At [**Hospital3 **] he did rule in for an myocardial infarction with a troponin of 2.3 and he was started on a heparin protocol with Integrilin and given sublingual nitroglycerin.
On admission to the hospital he did have a slight dorp in his blood pressure to a systolic of 60 and was given fluid boluses.
It was then determined that he should be transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] for urgent cardiac catheterization.
He was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit and stabilized and aloud to recover slightly from his myocardial infarction before being brought to the Operating Room for coronary artery bypass grafting.
Following his catheterization Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] was consulted for coronary artery bypass graft procedure.
On [**2176-8-15**] the patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft times four with the left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft harvested endoscopically to the posterior descending coronary artery, another to the obtuse marginal two and the third to the diagonal.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in stable condition.
The patient had received a hematology consult prior to surgery secondary to an elevated INR and this was thought to be per hematology to be secondary to his heparin drip.
Once the heparin drip had been discontinued his PTT and INR did decrease to within normal limits with doses of vitamin K.  The patient continued to progress until postoperative day number three when in the early morning hours he was noted to have a temperature spike to 102.9.
The patient was transferred back to the CSRU and neo-synephrine drip was started and the patient had a PA catheter introduced and an A line.
The patient's hematocrit at the time was also noted to be 23% and he was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.
He was also started on Zosyn empirically.
He did obtain an abdominal CT scan, which showed appendicitis and later that day was taken to the Operating Room for an open appendectomy.
This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The findings during this procedure were a gangrenous appendix with perforation and abscess containing pus, stool and phegmons.
Cultures were obtained and the patient s transferred back to the CSRU with an open wound and he was stable and intubated and sedated .
On the following day he was extubated in the afternoon and he also was begun on total parenteral nutrition.
It was noted again on [**8-20**] that his coagulation studies were elevated despite not receiving any type of anticoagulation treatment and it was felt again that this was secondary to diminished vitamin K level and poor nutrition.
Therefore he was given vitamin K supplements and eventually his coagulation studies returned to [**Location 213**].
There was also some concern that the Zosyn may be contributing to this and his antibiotics were changed from Zosyn to Ampicillin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
He did require multiple doses of Haldol and was restrained.
After a couple of days he had improving neurological status and his recovery from surgery was continuing.
He did continue on total parenteral nutrition and on [**2176-8-26**] was started on a full liquid diet, which he tolerated well.
His pacing wires were also discontinued on this day without incident.
He was encouraged continuously to increase his po intake and continue on total parenteral nutrition.
By [**2176-8-30**] his abdominal wound had minimal drainage and his JP was discontinued.
There was some concern, because his white blood cell count had increased again and he did receive a follow up abdominal CT scan, which showed no signs of abscess and normal post surgical changes.
He did finish his antibiotics course on [**2176-9-2**] and also his total parenteral nutrition was discontinued on this date and he was encouraged to increase his po intake.
Because of poor calorie count and poor po intake he did have a Dobbhoff tube placed and was started on tube feeds of ProMod with fiber.
With the increase in his nutrition status his blood sugars were noted to be elevated and therefore his Glyburide was increased to 10 mg po a day.

Regular insulin sliding scale when the finger stick blood sugars are between 150 to 200 the patient should receive 4 units of subq insulin, finger stick blood sugars 201 to 250 6 units of subq insulin, finger stick blood sugars 251 to 300 8 units of subq insulin, finger stick blood sugars 301 to 350 10 units of subq insulin, finger stick blood sugars 351 to 400 16 units of subq insulin and greater then 401 20 units of subq insulin and call the house officer.
This should be done by injecting the sponge with a mixture of 1 cc of 1% Xylocaine and 10 cc of normal saline and injecting that into the sponge prior to reapplying the vacuum.
