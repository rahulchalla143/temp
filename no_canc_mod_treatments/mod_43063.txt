Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old female with h/o hypercholesterolemia, hyperparathyrodism and HTN who presented with cough, n/v and was found to have a sodium of 110 on admission.
# Hyponatremia, symptomatic Renal was consulted, and given the patient's history of poor po intake, GI losses from emesis, and dehydration, it was felt that the patient's hyponatremia was due to hypovolemia in the setting of continued HCTZ use (started in late [**9-9**]), combined with decreased solid food intake, while continuing to drink signif water.
Her HCTZ was discontinued, she was hydrated with 3+L of NS and was admitted to the medical floor.
She does not require renal follow-up at this time, but if has persistent/recurrent hyponatremia, this referral may be made as an outpatient  #HYPERTENSION: - discontinued her home HCTZ - started on Lisinopril 10 mg po q day She is tolerating this well., bp in 120s/70s at the time of discharge.
We will continue her home Calcium and vitamin D and request endocrinology follow-up for this issue and her hyperparathyroidism (had been scheduled for [**4-8**], but was still inpatient at that time)  #HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA - continued statin.
#BRONCHITIS: - CXR PA/L negative for PNA, afebrile without leukocytosis - Antibiotics were discontinued on admission given her nausea/vomiting and intolerance to bactrim and augmentin.
- tessalon perles and nebulizer treatments prn Her cough was much improved at the time of discharge.
Pt's HA improved with tylenol and resolved with improvement of her hyponatremia.
