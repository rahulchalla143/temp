He had been off coumadin for 6 months secondary to chronic anemia from hemorrhoidal bleeding.
Surgery was consulted (he has a history of hemorroidectomy 15 years ago) but any surgical intervention was delayed in light of his other medical issues.
His current regimen included labetalol, doxazosin, lisinopril/HCTZ, Cartia.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was found to be in a polymorphic wide complex tachycardia to the 200s.

His rate slowed with the amiodarone and his rhythm returned to a narrow complex irregular tachycardia.
In the MICU the patient received an additional 6 units of blood.
He was also noted to have a wide-complex tachycardia and was started on dofetilide, amiodarone and esmolol gtt per the EP team which were then stopped and then transitioned to diltiazem, labetolol, which he was taking as an outpatient.
Neurology was consulted and recommended holding anticoagulation given lower GI bleed and to maintain SBP 140s-160s.

Colonoscopy on [**1-2**] revealed several possible etiologies of bleed: internal hemorrhoids vs. rectal varices vs. diverticuli.
Anticoagulation was held due to GI bleed, but patient was eventually resumed on Aspirin 325.
Patient takes defetilide at home, but this was stopped as patient was unable to remain in NSR.
He was rate controlled on labetolol and diltiazem, however, his HR remained in 90s.
Patient could not be anticoagulated on coumadin due to GI bleed.
Patients blood pressure medications were converted from long acting to short acting for better control of blood pressure goal.
Doxazosin was discontinued.
He was maintained on diltiazem, labetolol, and captopril.
He will ultimately need to have diltiazem switched to long acting form and labetolol will need to be switched to [**Hospital1 **] dosing if BP remains stable.
He was treated in the ICU with a nitroglycerin drip and diuresis with good response.
Home metformin and Actos were initially held and patient was maintained on a Regular insulin sliding scale.
