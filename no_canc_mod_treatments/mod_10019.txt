Due to concern for airway protection, the patient was reintubated and placed on a mexazolam drip as well as vecuronium.
In addition, he has used gamma hydroxybutyrate and ephedrine; although, he denies use of benzodiazepines or cocaine.
His respiratory rate revealed the patient was on the ventilator on synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation and pressure support with an FIO2 of 100%, respiratory rate set at 12, tidal volume of 700; on this, the patient had a spontaneous respiratory rate as high as 10 and had achieved an oxygen saturation of 100%.
His oropharynx revealed dried blood in the right nares where an nasogastric tube had been placed.
An arterial blood gas taken post intubation here revealed a pH of 7.32, PCO2 of 47, and a PO2 of 400.
Because the patient was actually tolerating wean from the ventilator, the decision was made to extubate, and post extubation the patient's agitation and fasciculations went away.
He actually was reversed after shutting off the vecuronium and being extubated with glycopyrrolate and neostigmine.
The patient did remain overnight without event, and on the morning of the second day of admission, Psychiatry came to evaluate him and felt that his overdose was not consistent with a suicide attempt and felt that he was safe to be discharged home.
