Brief Hospital Course: 89yo female with PMH of HTN, HL, prior upper GI bleed, and diverticulosis presents now s/p unwitnessed fall at home brought in by ambulance after a call by a family member concern about her safety and found to have hypothermia, bandemia, [**Last Name (un) **], elevated CK, and hypoglycemia.
The patient was hypothermic and exhibited a left shift (2% band and 92% polys) in the ED.
The patient was volume resuscitated with 6L of NS in the ED.
An additional 1L bolus was given, a R triple lumen CVL was placed, norepinephrine gtt was started to maintain MAP>60.
Empiric antibiotics were started - vancomycin and zosyn with renal dosing.
The patient had multiple sources of infection including a UTI vs. translocation of skin flora from 2 large unstagable ulcers located on her sacrum and on her L scapula, however, we had no positive cultures.
The vancomycin and zosyn were doscontinued when the patient was transfered to the floor.
An a-line was placed for continued BP monitoring.
The patient remained on norepiphrine gtt from [**10-4**] through [**10-8**].
Despite initial CK elevation to the 1200's, no evidence of rhabdomyolysis based on sedmient which would have contributed to renal dysfunction.
All medication were renally dosed.
There was also a concern for AAA given a abdominal palpable mass, HCT drop and hypotension.
This was treated with elevation and compresses.
The patient will continue dressing changes at rehab.
The patient will continue Micaconazole powder to area three times a day.
We attributed this to a possible medication effect and think that this should improve after discharge.
