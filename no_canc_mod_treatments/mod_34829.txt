Of note, he was recently admitted from [**Date range (3) 82787**] for acute dyspnea that improved with lasix and dialysis.
Given his respiratory distress, a trial of Bipap was initiated.
The patient was subsequently intubated given his failure to improve and altered mental status.
He got Vancomycin and Zosyn for presumed HAP.
Also has son who lives nearby and involved in his care (occasionally goes to hemodialysis with him).
Other son lives out of state and is also involved in his care (visits him 1-2 times a week, sets his medications out for him and pre-draws his insulin, fixed dose).
Per OMR, noncontributory  Physical Exam: Vitals: T:97.1 BP: 167/99 P:68 R: 15 O2: 98% General: Intubated and sedated HEENT: Pupils non reactive.
ET tube in standard placement.
Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
CXR ([**1-20**]): Endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic inlet.
Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 year old male with a history of dCHF, COPD, ESRD on HD and multiple recent admissions (4 at [**Hospital1 18**] since mid-[**11-26**] at [**Hospital6 **]) for pneumonia and pulmonary edema, who presents from homw with hypoxia.
Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Differential includes COPD exacerbation (wheezy on exam initially), volume overload (noncompliance with HD and medications), acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation (non-compliance with low-sodium diet and has BNP 21,224 with L pleural effusion), pneumonia +/- aspiration (elevated WBC and suggestion of consolidation of LLL on early CXR).
Given multiple recent hospitalizations, patient was felt at high risk of health care acquired pneumonia and initially treated with Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levofloxacin.
Of note, patient had received high dose IV steroids in the MICU/ED given concern for COPD exacerbation initially.
Patient's Prednisone was discontinued without issues.
Ultimately, patient's nebulizers were ordered standing and PRN and patient did not require much.
He was also kept on Lasix 120mg daily on nonhemodialysis days, with some urine diuresis.
He was saturating ~93% on room air by time of discharge - Continue nebulizers as needed for symptomatic relief.
Also continue home Flovent.
- Supplement oxygen as needed - Ensure aggressive hemodialysis (patient's respiratory status very sensitive to volume overload) - Continue Lasix 120mg on NON-HEMODIALYSIS DAYS (Mon, Wed, [**First Name3 (LF) **], Sun) - Patient requires a very strict low sodium (<2 grams), renal, diabetic diet .
Please continue nicotine patch and consider nicotine inhaler if would be helpful for habitual aspect of smoking - Responds well to Trazodone 25mg before bed - Also responds well to Haldol IM/IV 0.5mg.
This, however, responded well to hemodialysis and although is a poor prognostic indicator, did not require further intervention.
- Patient needs aggressive hemodialysis - Continue nephrocaps, sevelamer (1600mg three times daily now) .
DM2:  Patient was continued on his home dose of NPH 8 units with breakfast, with moderate blood sugar control.
