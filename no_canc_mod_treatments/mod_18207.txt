The infant was delivered by elective cesarean section without labor, for breech presentation.
PLAN:  The infant will be transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] for definitive surgical management.

A peripheral intravenous dextrose solution will be started at a total fluid intake of 60 mL per kg per day, with the usual attention to fluid and metabolic issues.
A CBC and blood culture have been drawn; however, we will defer empirical antibiotic therapy in light of this clinically excellent appearance and absence of peripartum risk factors.
