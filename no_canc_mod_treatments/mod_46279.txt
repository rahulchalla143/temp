In addition to that due to his extended periods on bedrest, despite the adequate placement of preventative boots, he developed an equinus deformity of his right lower extremity which will also need to be extensively worked with physical therapy as the patient becomes more ambulatory.
The patient throughout all of this procedure and throughout the multiple skin grafts had 100% graft take of his right lower extremity and his right upper extremity and will have no limitation to aggressive physical therapy ambulation and attempts to restore him to his previous state of health.
Prior to his discharge to rehabilitation the patient was taken off of his Hydromorphone PCA and was given sustained release Oxycodone as well as p.o.
Hydromorphone Dilaudid to control his pain issues.
However, throughout his rehabilitation course, we expect the patient can be weaned from his narcotics and we expect in addition to his improvement along physical therapy lines, his PICC line be decannulated and as well his Foley catheter be removed.
