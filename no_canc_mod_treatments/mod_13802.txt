With administration of IVF, albumin, and furosemide with increased output, and urine output increased during remainder of hospital course - until [**1-20**] days preceding transfer.
Evaluated by renal service; HD line not placed secondary to thrombocytopenia, and recommended CVVH to minimize fluid shifts.
Protonix gtt started; octreotide not started.
She received 2+ unit pRBC transfusions.
Albumin 2.8, INR 1.9. s/p paracentesis 2.6 liters with improvement in dyspnea.
- Thrombocytopenia - Nadir 25, required platelet transfusions.
s/p bone marrow biopsy on [**2170-6-15**].

CT abdomen performed showed pelvic ascites but there was not enough ascites on bedside ultrasounds for paracentesis.
Also with hyperkalemia (improved from OSH; EKG difficult to interpret given v-paced), fluid overload (maintained oxygen saturation on 2L nasal canula).
Other etiologies includes microangiopathy related to known autoimmune hepatitis, nephrotic syndrome, ATN, medication side effect, malignancy.
