The patient was undergoing a preoperative evaluation for a right total knee replacement and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation in [**2182-5-12**] with severe CHF and moderate mitral regurgitation by echocardiogram.
The patient was originally scheduled for mitral valve replacement and CABG with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in [**2182-7-12**]; however, the patient was found to have moderate to large size rectal masses on physical examination.
The patient underwent several subsequent colonoscopies each time with polypectomies and all the polyps were found to be benign.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2182-9-10**] for a CABG times one; SVG to OM, and a mitral valve replacement with a 29 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on milrinone and Neo-Synephrine infusion.
The patient was given volume and low-dose beta blocker.
The patient's milrinone was weaned down with an adequate cardiac index.
The patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation on the first postoperative night.
The patient had been started on his perioperative vancomycin and levofloxacin was ordered empirically for coverage of the valve.
The Infectious Disease Team was consulted and they recommended discontinuing the levofloxacin and adding gentamicin until the final cultures of the valve were available.
The patient began ambulating with Physical Therapy and was initially able to walk about 300 feet.
On postoperative day number three, the patient had a PICC catheter placed at the bedside by IV Therapy for long-term antibiotics.
On postoperative day number four, the patient's pacing wires were removed.
The patient continued to remain afebrile.
On the evening of postoperative day number four, the Infectious Disease Team recommended starting Clindamycin to increase the anaerobic coverage for the gram-positive rods.
It was recommended that the patient be continued on an increased dose of his beta blocker and no other antiarrhythmic therapy or implantable cardiac defibrillator would be recommended.
However, it was recommended that the patient be started on Coumadin for his history of atrial fibrillation and this was started on postoperative day number seven.
Also, on postoperative day number seven, the Infectious Disease Team recommended discontinuing the gentamicin and recommended continuing the patient on long-term vancomycin treatment.
It was decided by the Cardiac Surgery Team to continue the Clindamycin for continued anaerobic coverage as well.
