Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Coil embolization of left gastric artery Esophagogastroduodenoscopy x2 Central venous line placement to right internal jugular vein Temporary dialysis catheter placement to left femoral vein Radial arterial line placement  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 48 yo man h/o recent admission for pneumonia, septic shock, and bacteremia, also with history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and s/p bowel resection and anastamosis due to "kinking" 1.5 years ago, who presents from OSH with gastrointestinal bleed, intubated and on two pressors.
Patient was fluid resuscitated and transfused with two unit PRBCs.
Patient was intubated and transfused an additional 5u PRBCs, for a total of 7u at time of transfer.
CVL was placed and patient was started on norepinephrine and vasopressin.
Meds at time of transfer are IV Flagyl and PO vanco (for presumptive C dif), IV [**Name (NI) **] (unclear why), and IV vancomycin (for bacteremia from previous admission).
Of note, patient was recently admitted for hypoxic respiratory failure, ARDS and septic shock.
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for sepsis from a presumed pulmonary source (vancomycin/levofloxacin/Zosyn); in the end he completed a 7-day course of [**Name (NI) **]/Zosyn and was discharged to complete a 14-day course of vancomycin for GPC bacteremia (peptostreptococcus on blood culture from [**4-24**] with negative surveillance cultures).
Other issues during that admission included acute renal failure (felt to be secondary to shock ATN versus prerenal) that resolved at discharge, transaminitis (felt to be secondary to shock liver), thromboctyopenia (uptrending at time of discharge).
Past Medical History: - COPD - HTN - Depression - History of bowel resection and anastamosis due to "kinking" 1.5 years ago - History of chronic back pain s/p surgery x3   Social History: - Tobacco:  Quit smoking 1 week ago.
- Illicits:  Wife denies, including all inhalants.

Brief Hospital Course: A 48 y/o man with history of COPD and hypertension and recent admission for pneumonia and bacteremia presents with severe GIB and possible SBO, currently on pressors and intubated.
He was transfused aggressively with blood products to maintain hct greater than 25, platelets greater than 50, INR greater than 2, and fibrinogen greater than 200.
The bleeding was stopped with coil embolization.
After this procedure, his hematocrit stabilized somewhat, although he was still requiring (less frequent) blood transfusions.
Throughout all of this, he was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for GI flora, proton-pump inhibitor drip, stress-dose steroids, and norepinephrine titrated to maintain MAP >65.
His lactic acidosis improved initially, particularly after the IR-guided coil embolization.
Patient was started on CVVHD when serial ABGs revealed worsening acidemia.
It was felt that the combination of findings may have been due to propofol infusion syndrome, especially in light of the worsening hypertriglyceridemia.
Patient was intubated for airway protection in the setting of code blue for worsening hypotension.
Ventilation settings were increased in an effort to compensate for the worsening metabolic acidosis, but ultimately he required CVVHD.
His renal function continued to worsen, possibly due to ATN and/or increasing intra-abdominal pressure (from blood product infusion and capillary leak).
He was treated with bronchodilator inhalers standing and prn and stress-dose steroids.
Given that patient was not improving, and that he was requiring increasing doses of pressors and blood products with worsening liver, renal and cardiac function, his family decided to change goals of care to comfort measures only.
