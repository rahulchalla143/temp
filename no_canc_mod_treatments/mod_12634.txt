He had undergone arterial reconstruction with a right femoral to popliteal bypass approximately two years prior for claudication.
The profundas were noted to be widely patent and the superficial femoral artery on the left and the vein graft on the right were patent.
It was explained to the patient prior to the surgery of the increased risk with this type of operation especially when done for claudication alone.
He was subsequently cleared for vascular surgery and admitted to [**Hospital1 **].

Details of this procedure are dictated in a separate operative note.
The patient was then noted to tolerate the procedure well and was extubated in the post anesthesia care unit.
Electrocardiogram was also performed which revealed ST depression in leads V2 through V4 and T-wave inversions in 2, 3 and AVF with slight elevation.
It was based on this that the patient had officially ruled in for an acute myocardial infarction and he was then started on intravenous nitroglycerin, Lopressor.
He remained intubated and sedated for several days.
He was extubated on postoperative day #3 late in the day and was given aggressive chest physical therapy.
He was then transferred back up to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day #5 where he was maintained on a face mask of 50% due to his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and he was given aggressive diuresis.
