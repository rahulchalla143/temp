At OSH patient was being treated for CAP and started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone.
There was also adenopathy that was compressing the trachea, given this concern for airway obstruction patient was intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

CT chest [**6-6**]: FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube is in place, with tip terminating just above the level of the aortic arch.
Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian line in standard placements.
A tracheostomy tube appears in the mid trachea.
A PICC line terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
Brief Hospital Course: 38 y/o M with DM type 1, history of jail time who presented to OSH with what was thought to be CAP, found to have ground glass opacification and diffuse adenopathy on chest CT s/p intubation for airway obstruction, development of ARDS.
He could not be consented in house given intubation and current sedation.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, which initially included vancomycin and ceftazidime.
Because of this, he was restarted on paralytics, placed on ARDS protocol again with proning.
Pt went for tracheostomy w/ surgery.
## PNA: Pt had been treated with CTX & azithro at OSH.
His coverage was broadened to ceftazidime & vanco following admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
ID recommended extensive workup for other causes, including legionella, erhlichia, tuleremia, chlamydia, mycoplasma, and babesia, all of which were negative.
Pt received 16 days of ceftazidime and 14 days of linezolid and doxycycline, the latter of which was added for empiric tularemia tx.
Off antibiotics for pneumonia at the time of discharge to rehab.
With slight worsening appearance of opacities on chest x-ray, still concern for tularemia or other pathology not covered/ -Follow up on Tularemia abx, blood cx -Follow up appointment with ID .
## Pulm Edema: likely ARDS plus component of fluid overload following aggressive fluid resuscitation.
Pt was aggressively diuresed w/ lasix lasix gtt--this was stopped on [**6-25**].
Pt was given lasix bolus PRN.
Lasix was given PRN, and as [**7-10**] CXR demonstrated possible fluid overload 40 IV lasix given.
Lasix to be given as needed if signs of overload, clinical and imaging studies demonstrate need.
## Sedation: Pt required enormous doses of sedatives to keep him calm and prevent him from removing lines/self-extubating.
He required paralytics on top of sedatives for this and to tolerate the proning.
Methadone was started to help wean off IV fentanyl and other sedatives.
Then, fentanyl patch initiated, in attempt attempt to wean methadone and prevent opiate withdrawal.
Fentanyl patch decreased, use methadone PRN and then DC'd; used haldol PRN agitation.
Final regimen at time of discharge included Fentanyl patch at 150 mcg to be decreased as tolerated: Clonipine 3 mg TID, to be weaned as tolerated slowly, Morphine 1-2 mg q 2 for agitation pain, ativan as needed, and standing Haldol to be decreased to PRN as needed.
## PEA arrest: On the night of admission the patient had pea arrest, with cpr for 2-5 minutes.
The patient required fluids and pressors and eventually was weaned off pressors.
## Hypotension: Thought to be primarily from sepsis, although high PEEP and large doses of propofol likely also contributed.
As his infection was treated and propofol weaned, he was able to be weaned off Levophed.
Once of sedatives, and ventilator, BP increased and pt was hypertensive during weaning off narcotics and sedation.
Required occasional transfusions.
However, renal function again worsened in setting of aggressive diuresis.
Not worsened with diuresis and close to baseline at the time of discharge.
## DM type 1 - The patient's sugars were closely followed and was treated intermittently with insulin drip and when off the drip glargine and SSI according to his finger sticks.
Stable on glargine and sliding scale at the time of discharge.
