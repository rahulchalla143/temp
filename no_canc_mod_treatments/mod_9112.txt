HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 8529**] is a 73-year-old female with adenocarcinoma of the lung several times status post multiple wedge resections and a right upper lobectomy on [**2173-4-29**].
She then [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] excision of two nodules in the left lung in [**2166**] followed by chemotherapy for another adenocarcinoma of the lung, and finally she had a recurrence/new incidence of adenocarcinoma in the lung in the right upper lobe which was T2, N0, M0 treated with right upper lobectomy on [**2173-4-29**] at [**Hospital6 2910**].
Patient's postoperative course was notable for heavy secretions which she had difficulty expectorating, requiring frequent suctioning and bronchoscopy several times with intubation 4x during these bronchoscopies.
She was brought to the Emergency Department, where the patient had progressive hypercapnic respiratory failure culminating in a intubation followed by hypotension which required wide open IV fluids and double pressors.
Peripheral neuropathy secondary to chemotherapy for the [**2166**] adenocarcinoma.
Protonix 40 mg po q day.
Digoxin 0.125 mg po q day.
Lopressor 25 mg po q day.
Humibid 1200 mg po bid.
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid.
Verapamil SR 120 mg po q day.
Xanax 4 mg po bid.
She ambulates with a walker since her discharge from [**Hospital6 2911**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation, the patient had the following physical exam:  Her temperature is 97.0, heart rate is 95 and regular, blood pressure was 143/78 on dopamine and Neo-Synephrine.
Extremities: 1+ pitting edema all four extremities, multiple ecchymoses on all four extremities with faint macular rash on thighs.
She was on pressure support of 10 and 5, tidal volume 400, respiratory rate of 20, and FIO2 is 40%.
Her culture data here at [**Hospital3 **] was all negative including multiple blood cultures and urine cultures.
The patient was kept on the ventilator, and although she had a RSBI and tolerated pressure support well when she was extubated, she required continuous mask ventilation, and after a day and a half, the patient asked to be reintubated.
She was subsequently reintubated, and then [**Hospital6 1834**] elective tracheostomy two days prior to discharge after she tolerated the pressure support well.
The patient was maintained on albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q6h prn, and albuterol and Atrovent metered-dose inhalers q4h around the clock.
She was treated for the right lower lobe infiltrate with levofloxacin which is day #9 on the day of discharge with a total of 14 day course for presumed pneumonia.
The patient had also been on high dosed steroids presumably for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at the outside hospital.
She was continued on hydrocortisone taper and on the day of discharge from [**Hospital3 **], her hydrocortisone was discontinued, and she was started on 10 mg of prednisone po q day.
She during the course of her hospital stay after initial intubation dropped her pressures and required two pressors to support her blood pressure.
At one time, the patient went into atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate, was treated with diltiazem, and subsequently cardioverted.
After the cardioversion, the patient became asystolic, was treated with Epinephrine and atropine, and reverted to normal sinus rhythm.
All nodal blocking agents should be avoided in this patient, and although she was a candidate for a permanent pacemaker given her sinus node dysfunction and long pauses, the patient deferred this procedure now, and should be re-evaluated as an outpatient.
She was initially treated with IV hydralazine and on the day of discharge was switched to lisinopril 5 mg po q day.
Infectious disease:  The patient had all negative culture data during her hospital stay and she was treated only for the right lower lobe infiltrate with levofloxacin.
Two days prior to discharge, she had a percutaneous enterogastrostomy tube placed and tolerated tube feeds well.
She had a laceration on the left forearm which was seen by Plastic Surgery and they recommended wet-to-dry dressings, but no suturing.
She was treated with regular insulin-sliding scale [**Hospital1 **].
Psychiatric:  The day prior to discharge, the patient related feeling depressed and was started on Zoloft for her depression.
The patient is a candidate for a pacemaker.
Colace 100 mg PEG tube [**Hospital1 **].
Pantoprazole 40 mg PEG tube q24.
Levofloxacin 500 mg PEG tube q24 day #9 of 14, the last day should be [**2173-6-15**].
Combivent MDI q4h two puffs.
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q6h prn.
Lisinopril 5 mg po q day.
Prednisone 10 mg po q day.
Heparin subQ 5,000 units q8h.
Furosemide 40 mg po bid.
Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
Morphine sulfate 1 to 5 mg IV q4 prn pain at PEG site.
The patient is to call the Electrophysiology Clinic at [**Hospital3 **] for consideration of a permanent pacemaker upon discharge from [**Hospital1 **].
