He was weaned from the ventilator there, although he required high FIO2.
The right-sided effusion was tapped, and grew vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.
Blood pressure has also been decreased over the last several days, requiring intravenous fluid resuscitation.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft x 3 in [**2110**] 2.
Adult respiratory distress syndrome secondary to amiodarone toxicity, requiring hospitalization at [**Hospital1 346**] in [**2111-1-6**] 13.
History of cryptococcemia and cryptococcus in the pleural fluid in [**2111-1-6**], treated with AmBisome and now on fluconazole  MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: 1.
Prednisone 10 mg by mouth per feeding tube once daily 2.
Fluconazole 400 mg by mouth per feeding tube once daily 3.
Lasix 40 mg intravenous push once daily 4.
Glutamine one scoop per feeding tube twice a day 5.
Protonix 40 mg once daily 7.
Subcutaneous heparin 5000 units every 12 hours 8.
Levoxyl 0.125 mg per gastrostomy tube once daily 9.
Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once daily 10.
Metoprolol 75 mg by mouth once daily 11.
Colace 100 mg per gastrostomy tube twice a day as needed 12.
Regular insulin sliding scale 13.
Lorazepam 1 mg intravenous push every six hours as needed  ALLERGIES:   Dramamine  SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient has been at [**Hospital3 105**] and [**Hospital1 34648**] for ventilatory rehabilitation.
On presentation to this hospital, the patient underwent chest tube placement for tapping of bilateral pleural effusions.
Left-sided pleural effusion notable for 384,000 red blood cells, 378 white blood cells, 55% polys, protein of 2.9, glucose of 63, LDH of 630, amylase of 11, pH of 7.50, Gram stain revealed 2+ polys.
Blood was positive for cryptococcal antigen, and the patient was continued on his fluconazole.
The patient was covered broadly with two anti-pseudomonal drugs, namely amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
Cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal antigen was not sent, but had been negative in [**2111-1-6**].
The patient did grow vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in the pleural fluid in the setting of treatment with linezolid.
This was treated as a colonizer, and was not specifically treated during this hospitalization.
The patient did show evidence of oral thrush, and was treated with Nystatin and continued on his fluconazole.
Pulmonary:  As noted above, the patient was treated with amikacin and Zosyn for pseudomonal respiratory tract infection.
Per Infectious Disease service recommendations, the patient should receive a three week course of antibiotic treatment with these anti-pseudomonal agents.
The patient remained ventilator dependent during this hospitalization secondary to multifactorial pulmonary processes, namely pneumonia, possible amiodarone toxicity, and bilateral pleural effusions of mixed etiology, possibly with components of both transudate and exudate.
The patient continued on his antibiotics.
It was noted that he continued to grow moderate pseudomonas from his oropharynx despite treatment with amikacin and Zosyn.
The patient did very well on trials of pressure support of 5, with PEEP of 5, during the last two days of his hospitalization.
On [**2111-3-16**], the patient went for approximately seven hours on pressure support of 5, with little difficulty.
Ideally the patient will be weaned from the ventilator and then fitted for a fenestrated trach so that he may talk using the trach.
Congestive heart failure:  Patient with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft.
He was continued on his aspirin.
The patient's beta blocker was held for much of this hospitalization, given low blood pressures.
The patient received several one-time doses of 40 mg of intravenous lasix for suspicion for total volume overload.
For the most part, he remained on Diltiazem with good rate control.
He remained off of chronic anticoagulation, which had been previously discontinued in the setting of upper gastrointestinal bleed.
The patient was not started on iron therapy, given his iron to total iron binding capacity ratio.
He did receive a transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit bumped appropriately and remained relatively stable.
He remained on tube feeds per his percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, and these were at goal.
Access:  Patient with a right PICC line, which he has had in place for his antibiotic treatments since [**Month (only) 404**].
The PICC line was changed prior to discharge so that he could continue intravenous antibiotics for recommended periods of time.
The patient was screened by rehabilitation facilities for ventilator rehabilitation, as he will require gradual weaning from his ventilator.
Exudative pleural effusions status post chest tube placement and discontinuation 2.
Zosyn 4.5 mg intravenously every eight hours until [**2111-3-28**] 2.
Amikacin 300 mg intravenously every 18 hours until [**2111-3-28**] 3.

Lorazepam 1 to 2 mg intravenously every four hours as needed for agitation 14.
Albuterol six puffs every four hours as needed  DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:   The patient should receive weaning from his ventilator while at ventilator rehabilitation.
He has tolerated six to seven hour trials of pressure support of 5 with PEEP of 5 and done well.
We have typically switched him back to pressure support of 12 at night in order to rest him.
The patient should receive aggressive suctioning.
He should be continued on his antibiotics.
His PICC line should be monitored for signs of infection.
