airway issues with tracheostomy here for bronchoscopy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**11-9**]: flexible bronchoscopy [**11-10**]: re cannulation of tracheostomy and capping  [**2141-11-16**]:  Excessive mucus plugs and secretions in the T-tube with subglottic proximal mucosalswelling and edema.
Exchange tracheostomy   History of Present Illness: 81-year-old woman with history of Parkinson's disease S/P a mechanical fall few months ago with C2-C4 fracture S/P spinal fusion/hardware placement.
She underwent a tracheostomy tube secondary to concern for unstable cervical spine.
Patient underwent flex bronch today in the OR under deep sedation (No rigid bronch was performed due to concern about spinal instablility) showed  small/ moderate granulation tissue/ridge in proximal trachea ant wall with severe cervical malacia proximal to the trach tube with complete dynamic collapse.
Patient is being admitted for pre-op eval by neurosurgical service for spinal stability for neck hyperextension during rigid bronchoscopy.
Past Medical History: Laryngeal swelling, respiratory failure Parkinson's Disease Mechanical Fall: C2-C4 Fracture s/p fusion Cervical Spine [**5-7**] Tracheostomy prophylaxis [**5-7**] History of Pneumonia  Social History: Permanent resident at [**Hospital **] rehab  Family History: Noncontributory.
Tracheostomy remains in the midline.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent a flexible bronchoscopy which showed small/ moderate granulation tissue/ridge in proximal trachea anterior wall with severe cervical malacia proximal to the trach tube with complete dynamic collapse.
She underwent exchange trach cannulation and was capped with no significant result in the immediate period.
MICU course: This is an 81 y/o woman with PMH notable for Parkinson's disease and C2-4 fracture s/p fusion with tracheostomy due to recurrent pneumonia admitted to MICU after PEA arrest on the floor.
CXR with LLL opacity consistant with resolving mucous plugging - npo for now, consider soft diet after stable on trach mask - weaned off ventilation, now on TM at 40% - continue to monitor closely and suction prn - IP team to see today to decide dispo ??????
d/w IP team pt to go to floor - continue albuterol/atrovent nebs with mucomyst nebs - further trach interventions (i.e., rigid bronch) per IP team -CXR tomorrow to eval change in LLL opacity ??????
Artifact could represent chest compressions and no other telemetry strips printed from time of event.
# Osteoporosis: Continue calcium and vitamin D. .
# Parkinson's disease: Continue sinemet, mirtazapine, modafinil and entacapone (the last two ordered non-formulary) .
# FEN: npo for now while on positive pressure ventilation, soft diet with thick nectar liquids when back on trach collar/cap, replete lytes prn .
______________________________________________________________  After her MICU course, the patient was stable and received a T-Tube on [**11-13**] which she tolerated well.
She then subsequently was admitted to the SICU on [**11-14**] for increased secretions and was discharged to the floor on [**11-15**] after aggressive suctioning.
She tolerated the procedure well and was brought to the floor, again uncapped, because of upper airway edema.
Therefore, we are sending her out on steriods for a few more days.
