The patient spiked a temperature to 103 degrees and received IV ceftriaxone 2 gm in the E.D.
After no improvement, he presented again and received IV Ancef and developed a diffuse, macular, nonpustular, nonbullous, nonpruritic, whole body rash except above his collar, but he does note that the rash was on his palms, but did not affect the soles of his feet, that had been attributed to a drug rash from Ancef.
The patient then presented to [**Hospital1 18**], spiked a fever and dropped systolic to 70, but responded to IV fluids and dopamine.
The patient continued to state groin pain and rash, macular, blanching, nonpruritic, painful, but without drainage in the left groin area and medial thigh that the patient states responded somewhat to the previous antibiotics at the outside hospital.
The patient presented without any history of sick contacts, travel outside of [**Location (un) **], ingestion of raw or undercooked food, no history of pharyngitis or any people in his family with pharyngitis, but did state recent exposure to numerous wildlife including dead chipmunks, aerosolizer on feces and because of recent work in the forest, had positive exposure to all the classic vectors known in [**Location (un) 511**] including ticks, spiders and mosquitos.
MEDICATIONS:  Meds at home none.
Meds at outside hospital were vanc, clinda and Levaquin times one day and Zofran.
The patient's systolic blood pressure dropped to 70, but he responded to IV fluids and dopamine.
Once he was hemodynamically stable, the patient was started on vanc and clinda for questionable staph strep cellulitis and doxycycline was later added on for rickettsial coverage.
Motrin was started for pericarditis.
Vanc IV was discontinued and the patient was put on p.o.
The patient also had throughout his body questionable remnants of a red, macular, reticular or streaking rash which he described as the same appearance of what was throughout his whole body which is still remnant on his arms and legs toward the anterior sides.
Of note, this is not the same and his current inguinal rash and pertinent negatives included negative sore throat, facial palsy, central clearing rash, confusion or lethargy, ulceration or eschar around the rash or any uncontrolled upper extremity movements.
Urine was dark amber in color with large blood, but only 2 RBC, positive for urobilinogen and trace protein.
Throughout the hospital course the patient was receiving doxycycline and clindamycin and he did improve clinically.
The patient's ASO was negative times one, he had no signs of chorea and did have significant exposure to wild animals and vectors as well as apparent resolution with antibiotics and no aspirin or steroids, it was assumed that the etiology was more infectious than rheumatologic.
He complained of occasional, left, pinpoint shoulder pain, but did not have reduced range of motion.
Streptomycin was not started for tularemia as this was lower on the differential diagnosis, although tularemia does not necessarily have to be glandular with ulcerations in the central eschar which, of note, was not present in this patient.
A throat culture was done for beta strep and the primary consulted with the infectious disease team who believe that aspirin for the initial diagnosis of rheumatic fever was not necessary as this was more likely an infectious etiology.
Motrin was able to control his left shoulder arthralgias.
doxycycline and to follow up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 14 days.
On day of discharge another Lyme titer, ESR and CRP were drawn and it was encouraged that the patient's PCP look at the results of these labs, especially at the titers to make a clinical decision on whether to complete a full 30 day course of doxycycline in the case of Lyme serology being positive.
Doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d.
Clindamycin 450 mg four times a day.
FOLLOWUP:  The patient was given an appointment with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] is Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], in his [**Location 27224**] for [**8-12**] at 10:50 a.m. to discuss appropriateness of continuing doxycycline for a one month regimen based on Lyme titers, ESR and CRP which were drawn at [**Hospital1 18**] on the day of discharge.
The patient was also asked to be compliant with antibiotic regimen until seeing his PCP physician and to see his PCP physician before two weeks or in an E.D.
Upon discharge the patient was understanding of his diagnosis, discharge condition, discharge medications and plans for followup and states compliance with these plans.
