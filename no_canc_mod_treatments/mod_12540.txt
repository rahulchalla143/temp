There was no history of maternal hypertension and the patient's mother did receive one dose of betamethasone prior to delivery.
RESPIRATORY:  The patient was initially intubated in the Delivery Room and over the course of the first day to 24 hours, received Surfactant times three and progressed rapidly from conventional ventilator to high-frequency ventilation.
The patient remained on the high-frequency ventilator from [**11-10**] until [**12-15**], at which time he was taken off to conventional ventilation.
The ventilator settings have ranged from positive inspiratory pressures of 22 to 30 over peak end-expiratory pressures of 5 to 7 with rates from 23 to 28.
The patient developed bilateral pleural effusions that seemed to be related to leakage of parenteral nutrition.
The PICC line came from below and had no access to the chest cavity itself and the IVC was below the diaphragm, however, the fluid that was tapped from the right and drained from the left with a chest tube on [**11-23**], was consistent with parenteral nutrition.
The left chest tube was placed on [**11-23**]; the right chest tube was placed on [**11-25**], and continued to drain until the chest tubes were placed to Water-Seal on [**11-28**], with subsequent removal.
The patient was initially loaded on caffeine for the first time on [**12-14**] for apnea of prematurity.
Caffeine was discontinued on [**2103-1-2**].
The patient was tried on Combivent [**12-4**].
The Combivent was discontinued [**1-16**] after Inhaled steroids were begun.
The patient, for chronic lung disease management, was started on a trial of Lasix on [**12-7**], and was changed over to Diuril on [**12-9**] and to this day remains on Diuril 40 mg per kilo per day in an effort to help improve the chronic lung disease.
The patient was fluid restricted further from initially total fluids of 140 in [**Month (only) 404**] down to today's 130 cc per kilo per day and in addition to the Diuril, Lasix was given on an every-other-day basis on [**12-28**] for a total of six days with slight improvement in ventilation, at which time the Lasix was discontinued and Aldactone was started in an effort to get the potassium sparing effect.
In an effort to improve the need for extremely high ventilator settings and chronic lung disease management, inhaled Beclomethasone was started on [**2103-1-11**], with eight puffs q. four hours.
Over the course of the next four days, the O2 requirements did improve from near 80% down to about 40 to 50% but there was no movement on the ventilator settings and the patient still had pCO2s into the 60s on cap gases.
It was then determined in conjunction with suggestions from the Pulmonary consultants, to begin systemic dexamethasone therapy.
The starting dose for the dexamethasone was 0.25 mg per kilo per day divided and twice a day.
The wean for the dexamethasone currently is being determined based on effect, but will likely be weaned over the course of ten to 14 days.
Currently, [**Known lastname 5621**] [**Known lastname 37227**] is on ventilator settings of 28/7 with a rate of 28, remains on Diuril, Aldactone, and dexamethasone for his chronic lung disease management as well as fluid restrictions.
The patient, at that point, was already NPO and did get a course of Indomethacin at which point the follow-up echocardiogram on [**11-12**] showed that the PDA had closed.
Line access initially did include a UAC, UVC and has had a peripheral arterial line as well as PICC as mentioned above.
The patient was hypotensive at least initially and was started on Dopamine shortly after birth with a peak Dopamine requirement of 20 micrograms per kilo per minute which was weaned fairly rapidly after the PDA was closed and the Dopamine was discontinued on [**2102-11-17**].
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient was initially NPO, was started on D10 and then advanced to parenteral nutrition due to concerns of sepsis in addition to PDA and courses of Indomethacin.
Feeds were restarted on [**12-5**], at 10 cc per kilo per day, and reached full feeds on a slow advancement by [**2102-12-16**].
In addition, the patient was started on sodium and potassium supplements on [**12-16**]; this was about the same time that the Diuril was started.
The patient was started on potassium and phosphorus on [**12-27**], due to a low phosphate of 3.4.
Current medications for Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition: Include sodium and potassium supplementations; the potassium supplementations are in the form of chloride as well as phosphate.
The patient was started on phenobarbital for elevated bilirubin on [**1-4**], and seemed to have a good response.
Testing for alpha 1 antitrypsin and P typing, which will be sent with the next blood draw, this Friday, [**1-19**].
They also asked for urine for CMV which was sent today, [**1-16**], and depending upon the results of the HIDA Scan they would consider starting Ursodiol.
In addition, due to concerns about the potential for silent reflux, Zantac and Reglan were started empirically on [**1-12**].
Currently the patient is receiving his feeds over a two hour period of time.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Initially, when the baby was [**Name2 (NI) **] on [**2102-11-9**], Ampicillin and Gentamicin were started for a rule out sepsis.
Due to dilated loops and a distended abdomen and concerns about NEC, Clindamycin was added and the patient remained on Ampicillin, Gentamicin and Clindamycin for the first 14 days of life.
The antibiotics were changed on [**11-23**], to Vancomycin, Gentamicin and Clindamycin and finished a total of 21 days of total antibiotic course.
The change to Vancomycin was done about the time the bilateral pleural effusions arose with the substance that appeared to be PN.
A subsequent rule out sepsis was performed in the end of [**Month (only) 404**], on [**12-19**] to [**12-22**]; the patient was on Vancomycin and Gentamicin and the rule out sepsis turned out to be negative.
On [**2102-12-28**], after several days of increasing amounts of trachea aspirate and a color change from white to tan, a trachea aspirate culture was sent which showed moderate beta Strep as well as [**Known lastname 37228**] and antibiotics at that time were started.
A 14 day course of Cefotaxime and Gentamicin was begun.
It was determined at that time to finish a 14 day course and then begin treatment for the chronic lung disease with the inhaled steroids.
