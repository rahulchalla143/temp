The patient had noted an episode of chest pain one day prior to admission which was relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin.
In the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department the patient was found to have a blood pressure of 65/47, heart rate 79, temperature 96.8 F.  He was emergently intubated for hypoxemia and airway protection.
Despite intravenous fluids the patient's blood pressure did not increase and he was initiated on Neo-Synephrine.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis secondary to    diabetes mellitus.
Diabetes mellitus insulin dependent for 35 years.
Coronary artery disease status post four-vessel CABG.
Status post stroke with residual left-sided weakness.
Renagel 2400 mg p.o.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
Digoxin 0.125 mg q. Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
Calcitrol 0.25 mg p.o.
Isordil 20 mg p.o.
Zoloft 25 mg p.o.
Actos 30 mg p.o.
Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
Sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n.
Humulin 70/30, 20 units p.o.
Percocet p.r.n.
Coumadin 3 mg p.o.
The patient's fingers and toes are cyanotic with cool fingers and toes.
The patient has a right femoral hemodialysis catheter without erythema or edema.
Ciprofloxacin was continued and Gentamicin initiated on [**2173-3-25**].
Patient finished a seven- day course of Linezolid for the MRSA.
Mr. [**Known lastname 34227**] continued to do well status post extubation until [**2173-4-7**] when he developed significant upper chest/neck and upper extremity edema secondary to a worsening SVC syndrome.
The patient was placed on masked ventilation for six hours and has continued to do well off of ventilatory support.
Distributive shock:  [**Known lastname 34227**] presented to [**Hospital **] hypotensive despite aggressive fluid    resuscitation.
He was initiated on vasopressors at that    time.
His [**Last Name (un) **]    stim test did demonstrate that he was relatively adrenal    insufficient, and hydrocortisone and Fludrocortisone were    initiated.
The patient's sepsis was treated with broad-    spectrum antibiotics initially, including Linezolid and    Ciprofloxacin.
His antibiotics were changed to Linezolid, Gentamicin on [**2173-3-25**] to complete a seven-day course of Linezolid for the MRSA in the sputum.
Patient's blood cultures from [**2173-3-28**] returned positive for E. coli and he had intermittent meropenem added to Gentamicin at that time.
He completed a five-day course of Gentamicin and continues on meropenem for a 14-day course; last dose to be administered [**2173-4-11**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 34227**] continued to require vasopressors intermittently with Levophedrine and Vasopressin until [**2173-4-3**] and has remained hemodynamically stable throughout to the time of this dictation.
Given his protracted hospital course requiring vasopressors, alternate sources for inferior were evaluated despite the lack of evidence of a significant leukocytosis or fever.
An abdominal CT scan on [**2173-3-31**] without contrast demonstrated a potential ________ tumors, although infection could not be ruled out.
Acute blood loss anemia secondary to gastrointestinal    bleeding:  Mr. Angiostatin had been maintained on ulcer    prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor.
The NG tube was aspirated    and Gastroccult was negative.
Since the patient was on Heparin at the    time, this was discontinued for several hours and    restarted at a lower goal PTT.
Patient's Protonix was    changed to b.i.d.
Peripheral vascular disease with multiple-vessel    thromboses:  Mr. [**Known lastname 34227**] was anticoagulated during    hospitalization with intravenous Heparin with a goal PTT    of 6100.
Given his gastrointestinal bleeding the    Heparin was changed for a lower goal PTT.
Heparin    was increased with a higher goal PTT and the patient was    dialyzed with aggressive fluid removal goals given his    worsening respiratory status secondary to the SVC    syndrome.
An Electrophysiology    consult on [**2173-4-20**] recommended holding Digoxin, beta    blockers, and drawing Digoxin levels.
Some low-dose    Dopamine was recommended for chronotrophy, although the    patient became tachycardiac with this intervention and it    was discontinued.
Throughout the hospitalization patient's rate was elevated to 120s to 130s at time requiring initiation of Amiodarone.
The patient responded well with heart rates being in the 70s and 80s after being maintained on this medication.
End-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes mellitus on    hemodialysis:  Mr. [**Known lastname 34227**] was followed by the Renal    service throughout his admission and was initiated on CVBH    [**2173-3-25**] secondary to continuing total-body fluid    accumulation with decreasing lung compliance while on    mechanical ventilation.
Initially patient's left hemodialysis graft was accessed    with no complications for hemodialysis.
However, upon    initiation of CVBH a right femoral hemodialysis catheter    was utilized.
Given the concern for continued infection    the right femoral hemodialysis catheter was changed over    wire on [**2173-3-29**].
He was continued on Fluocortolone    and hydrocortisone for seven days and discontinued.
Upon taper to    hydrocortisone 25 mg p.o.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus:  Mr. [**Known lastname 34227**] was    maintained on insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] protocol for the    majority of his ICU stay as his nutrition was not    consistent given difficult intravenous and enteral access.
A PEG tube was placed on [**2173-4-8**] and tube feeds were    initiated.
He was changed to Lantus with sliding scale on    [**2173-4-10**].
