Brief Hospital Course: 80-year-old male with history of CAD s/p CABG x2, chronic systolic heart failure with EF of 25%, s/p BiV pacemaker with very recent admission with cellulitis complicated by renal failure and HD inititiation, PEA arrest, with resultant short term memory loss and delirium who presented from rehab with delirium with concern of sepsis with urinary tract infection.
He continued to decline during his hospitalization with worsening of his delirium.
We obtained blood and urine cultures and started him initially on vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
Delirium continued to worsen in the context of hypotension associated with hemodialysis and then worsening metabolic state after HD was discontinued.
Hemodialysis was discontinued when decision was made for comfort measures only, and his pressures improved.
Patient had a history of requiring substantial preload and gentle IVF was provided prn to maintain volume status.
# Ventricular tachyarrhythmia: Patient was continued on quinidine and mexilitine until CMO.
BiV ICD was stopped at that time but pacer was kept on until patient [**Year (4 digits) **].
Admitted on aspirin and as per neurology, we initially increased his dose to 325.
Crackles were observed intermittently on pulmonary exam, but JVD was not observed until HD was stopped and patient received fluid bolus.
These were treated with a scopolamine patch and glycopyrrolate with limited effect.
# h/o CVA: Per neuro consult note recommend warfarin for INR >2.
However due to concern for risk of falls or bleeding, we increased aspirin to 325mg and started him on a statin to minimize future strokes.
HD was discontinued as care was transitioned to an emphasis on comfort.
