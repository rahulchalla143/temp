She rapidly responded to IV fluid hydration in both her blood pressure as well as her renal function.
intake as well as diuretic therapy possibly also relating to her borderline adrenal insufficiency upon presentation in the setting of acute URI.
She was given IV fluids on a prn basis and her hypotension resolved quickly.
Acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency:  The patient was presenting with a BUN and creatinine well above her baseline.
This quickly resolved with IV fluid hydration.

Ultrasound did show mild right-sided hydronephrosis, however, this was not aggressively followed per the Renal team given the patient's overall improvement in renal function with IV fluid hydration.
She was treated with sodium bicarbonate in the ICU.
Adrenal insufficiency:  The patient was maintained on stress-dose steroids for approximately three days.
Fingersticks were monitored while the patient was on extra steroid doses.
