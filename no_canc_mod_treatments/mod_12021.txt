Given this the patient was changed from vancomycin/ciprofloxacin to bactrim.
Also with CO2 retention on previous ABGs.
- continue albuterol, combivent, flovent as per rehab dose.
Given this it is unclear why the patient is not on a statin, aspirin, ace-inhibitor and possibly a beta-blocker.
Will start toprol XL, statin for now.
Will need to readdress the need for aspirin with rehab doctors.
On interrogation by EP, there was no signs of pacer malfunction.
Ok to start beta-blocker for risk reduction given that the patient has a pacemaker for a back-up rate.
-Labs should be followed every 2-3 days to ensure that renal function is improving and that electrolytes remain normal.
However BP improved and outpatient meds were started.
However, hydralazine was restarted at a lower dose given initial low bp as well as desire to start metoprolol XL for risk reduction given known CAD.
