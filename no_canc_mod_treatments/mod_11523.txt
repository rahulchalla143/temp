He had been started on stress dose steroids on floor given chronic steroid use and probable baseline adrenal insufficiency.
He then received IV lasix for diuresis given volume load during resucitation.
His Hct remained stable, and he did not require any further transfusions - the source of his GI bleed remained unclear.
However, he had 5L UOP for the day, looked dry on exam, and so he was given IVF first with immediate improvement of BP to 110s/70s, HR slowed initially to 110s-130s, then converted to sinus rhythm after an addition 500cc bolus.
Ventilatory support - Pt was intubated given hypotension and respiratory distress.
He received fluid resuscitation as described above and once stable, was extubated after SBT and rsbi of 30.
Unclear cause of hypoxia although hypervolemia due to fluid resuscitation was on the differential.
He was given empiric treatment with vanco and zosyn for 7 days, with subsequent decrease in sputum production and resolution of leukocytosis.
Will need repeat ERCP at some point as outpatient for removal of stent.
COPD - On inhalers while intubated and changed over to nebs after extubation.
Held albuterol given tachycardia.
He was also given steroids for MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] adrenal insufficiency.
thrombocytopenia - DIC labs wnl, concern for HIT so avoided all heparin products.
He was given a steroid taper and arranged for outpatient services.
PPx - He was given PPI, bowel regimen, and pneumoboots for prophylaxis.
