Admission Date:  [**2133-1-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2133-2-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2076-1-2**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with end-stage renal disease (status post renal transplant in 200), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, gout, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and 2+ mitral regurgitation who presented to an outside hospital on [**1-28**] after he developed rapid atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter, and congestive heart failure.
The patient did not respond well to diuresis with an elevated creatinine.
End-stage renal disease; status post renal transplant in [**2128**].
Digoxin 0.125 mg once per day.
Lopressor 50 mg twice per day.
Actos 15 mg once per day.
Prevacid 30 mg once per day.
Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
Vitamin C 500 mg once per day.
Vitamin E 800 mg once per day.
Vitamin B 100 mg once per day.
Potassium 140 mEq twice per day.
Prednisone 5 mg once per day.
Prograf 6 mg twice per day.
Magnesium oxide 200 mg once per day.
Lasix 160 mg twice per day.
Zaroxolyn 1.25 mg once per day.
In addition, during that time he was being aggressively diuresed and had received colchicine for his gout flare.
However, in light of the patient's hematuria and immunosuppressed status with a transplanted kidney, there was concern over possible BK infection.
The patient underwent a renal biopsy on [**2-6**] and had his immunosuppression decreased slightly with a reduction in his CellCept from 1000 mg twice per day to 500 mg twice per day.
Over the course of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, his renal function improved daily once his tachycardia and congestive heart failure were under control.
On the day of discharge, the patient's creatinine was back at his baseline.
However, his ACE inhibitor will continued to be held and will eventually be restarted as an outpatient.
RENAL TRANSPLANT ISSUES:  The patient had a renal transplant in [**2128**] for renal failure secondary to hypertension and diabetes.
The patient will be maintained on tacrolimus 5 mg by mouth twice per day, prednisone 5 mg by mouth once per day, and CellCept [**Pager number **] mg by mouth twice per day for his immunosuppression.
He was initially controlled with Lopressor and digoxin; however, once he converted to a sinus rhythm and his rates slowed, the patient was changed over to amiodarone (per Cardiology recommendations).
The patient was to be loaded with one week of 400 mg of amiodarone by mouth twice per day followed by one week of 400 mg of amiodarone by mouth once per day, followed by initiation of his maintenance dose of 200 mg by mouth every day.
The patient was to follow up with his cardiologist within three to four weeks of discharge to address the issue of his severe mitral regurgitation and the potential need for mitral valve replacement.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and required a short 2-day intubation for airway protection.
He has a history of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and has not been on Coumadin for anticoagulation.
The patient was instructed to follow up with his primary care physician within one week to discuss anticoagulation as it is clearly indicated in this case to decrease his risk of stroke.
Therefore, a colonoscopy and possible endoscopy were recommended if there is concern over possible gastrointestinal bleeding with the initiation of anticoagulation therapy.
HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  The patient was admitted on a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor.
However, his ACE inhibitor was held secondary to his acute renal failure.
The patient was to take these in conjunction with his other antihypertensive medications (Lopressor and amlodipine).
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] his ACE inhibitor can be restarted, he may no longer need the hydralazine and the nitrate.
The patient was to be discharged to his rehabilitation facility with a regular insulin sliding-scale; however, he will likely require long-acting insulin for optimal blood sugar control as an outpatient.
The patient was given two doses of colchicine which temporarily relieved his symptoms.
If the patient's gout flare returns, a short steroid burst of three to five days of increased prednisone should be considered.
The patient was instructed to discuss the issue of starting Coumadin for anticoagulation to decrease his risk of stroke with his atrial fibrillation.
Acute renal failure; status post renal transplant.
Lansoprazole 30 mg by mouth once per day.
Tacrolimus 5 mg by mouth twice per day.
Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
Bactrim single strength one tablet by mouth three times per week (on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).
Prednisone 5 mg by mouth once per day.
Albuterol inhaler as needed.
K-Dur 20 mEq by mouth once per day (please have electrolytes checked every two to three days during his stay at the rehabilitation facility.
Amlodipine 5 mg by mouth once per day.
Amiodarone 400 mg by mouth twice per day for four days; and then 400 mg by mouth once per day for one week; and then begin maintenance dose of 200 mg by mouth once per day.
Metoprolol 100 mg by mouth three times per day.
Imdur 90 mg by mouth once per day.
Hydralazine 50 mg by mouth q.6h.
Lasix 80 mg by mouth twice per day.
