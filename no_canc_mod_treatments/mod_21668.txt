3-cm fluid collection with peripheral enhancement containing air and fluid in the left perirectal area, likely representing perirectal abscess in this patient with purulent drainage from rectum.
Status post axillary-bifem bypass surgery.
Decrease in size of bilateral inguinal fluid collections, larger on the right, probably representing seroma versus hematoma as described previously.
Small collection of air in the bladder, which may be related to recent catheter placement if there is an appropriate history; however, please correlate with the result of urinalysis.
The patient had previously been treated with 3-week course of levo/Flagyl and Vanco which may have contributed to high INR.
The patient underwent drainage on [**2174-1-6**] and was extubated without event.
The patient was being treated with Gent/Levo/Flagyl (Day 4 treatment, day 1 post-op) when she developed SBP of 67, but was asymptomatic.
ID was consulted and given quinolone resistance, the patient was placed on aztreonam/metronidazole/vancomycin with improvement in vital signs and negative surveillence cultures.
ID made note to give attention towards the patient's graft as a source for seeding, although after 3 months her graft should be well endothelialiazed.
Patient was also volume resuscitated with IVF and 2u PRBC.
A PICC line was placed for antibiotic administration.
Currently, the patient is receiving Aztreonam, Linezolid, and metronidazole, Day 3 for these antibiotics.
As the patient has a PICC, she will be discharged to a facility with plans for continuing these antibiotics for a 3 week course given she her peri-rectal abscess, her graft, and potential for seeding.
The patient has not required fluid boluses or pressors but may receive fluid as needed if she develops any hypotension.
PVD: Patient is s/p axillary [**Hospital1 **]-fem bypass and has remaining multiple LLE ulcers.
After the perirectal abscess drainage was complete, the patient was restarted on ASA and once it was certain that HCT was stable.
However, the patient has continued to have a supratherapeutic INR, therefore coumadin was not initially restarted.
Therefore, the patient will be restarted on coumadin on discharge.
The patient previously was taking coumadin 1mg po qd, but developed an INR to 6.0, although in the setting of abx therapy.
The patient was continued on  atorvastatin and wound care nursing followed the patient.
However, this should continue to receive careful observation with consideration for any compromise of the patient's graft.
In the setting of infection and alteration of coumadin dosing.
Held home dose of lasix for duration of hospitalization, however did re-start lisinopril at half the patients normal home dose.
She was maintained on amiodarone 400mg po qd and ASA 325mg po qd.
As outlined above, patient will restart coumadin therapy on discharge, but will require close monitoring in the setting of previously elevated INR and ongoing abx dosing.
Foley was changed and patient started on fluconazole [**1-9**].
Peri-rectal abcess: Surgery packed wound and followed throughout hospital course.
At time of discharge, they felt wound was healing well, and patient didn't need to follow with them unless something changes requiring repeat evaluation.
