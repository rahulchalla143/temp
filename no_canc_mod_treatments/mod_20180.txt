You were initially admitted to the ICU, but your breathing was better after starting antibiotics and steroids, so you were transferred to the floor.
On the floor, your cough was better controlled with anti-cough medications, and your oxygen requirement decreased over a few days.
At the time of discharge, your cough was much improved, you had good levels of oxygen in your blood, and your chest pain was slightly better.
**Changes to your cough/breathing medications: -STOP Robitussin -START Guaifenesin with codein every 4-6 hours as needed, but DO NOT DRIVE OR OPERATE MACHINERY AFTER TAKING THIS MEDICATION (it can make you drowsy) -START Benzonatate three times a day to help suppress your cough -START Guaifenesin tablets twice a day to help suppress your cough -START Prednisone 50mg daily until you see the pulmonologist -START Montelukast daily until you see your pulmonologist -START Bactrim daily to help prevent a specific type of pneumonia from developing; this medication only needs to be continued while you are on steroids (prednisone)  **Changes to you pain medications -START Tylenol every 4-6 hours as needed for pain -START Ibuprofen as needed for pain -START oxycodone as needed for pain  **Changes to other medications -START docusate for constipation; a side effect of opioid medications is constipation, and this medication can help treat this side effect -START senna for constipation -START omeprazole for prevention of acid reflux  We spoke with multiple physicians, and we think that right now, you don't need additional Levaquin.
You will need to get refills of your medications through your primary physician or your pulmonologist.
You will only be prescribed a small number of each type of medication to help you before your first follow-up appointment.
