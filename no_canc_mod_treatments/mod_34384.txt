Found to have pericardial effusion, underwent pericardiocentesis with removal 300 cc clear slightly blood-tinged pericardial fluid, with decrease in pericardial pressure from 26 to 10 mmHg.
Patient also underwent pericardial drain placement.
The effusion was attributed to RA, but methotrexate was discontinued (and prednisone increased from 20 to 30 mg daily) in case the former was contributing.
Routine follow-up TTE today at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] showed a small to moderate mainly anterior pericardial effusion with diastolic right ventricular collapse suggestive of tamponade.
