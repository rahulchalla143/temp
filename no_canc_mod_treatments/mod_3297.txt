HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology Service on [**2120-6-18**], following her cardiac catheterization.
The following day she was taken to the operating room, where she had an aortic valve replacement with a tissue prosthetic valve.
The procedure was remarkable for a transfusion requirement of 5 units of packed red blood cells, 4 units of fresh-frozen plasma and two units of platelets.
Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 92 minutes.
Postoperatively, the patient was taken intubated to the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit.
In the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit she was extubated overnight, but required a Neo-Synephrine drip to maintain her blood pressure.
She was slowly weaned off this drip throughout the course of the first postoperative day.
She required significant doses of intravenously Lopressor in order to control her rate.
She ultimately required 25 units of Lopressor IV and she was also transfused with one more unit of packed red blood cells.
She was given intravenous Lasix and treated with IV Diltiazem.
She converted after 15 mg bolus and she was started on a drip at 10 mg an hour.
All of beta blockers were discontinued.
The following day, she started to be loaded with oral Diltiazem.
By the 5th postoperative day, the oral Diltiazem dosage increased and her drip was decreased.
She was started on subcutaneous heparin and screening for rehabilitation was initiated.
She did require some intravenous doses of Diltiazem for heart rates between 100 and 110 as her drip was being weaned and her oral doses were taking effect.
We are anticipating that she is transferred to rehabilitation on [**6-25**], off her Diltiazem drip, taking 90 mg PO q.i.d.
Diltiazem anticipated to be 90 mg PO q.i.d.
