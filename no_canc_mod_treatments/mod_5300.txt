PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+   Pertinent Results: CXR line placement [**7-30**]:  In comparison with study of [**7-26**], there is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina.
Right subclavian catheter extends to the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.
Nasogastric tube extends at least to the upper body of the stomach.The cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal in size.
CXR [**7-31**]: In comparison with the study of [**7-30**], the endotracheal tube tip again is well above the carina, about 5.8 cm.
Nasogastric tube and right jugular catheter remain in place.

Pt was also being evaluated by EP for possible pacemaker placement due to vasovagal syncope and bradycardia.
Pt received Epi, Dextrose & Insulin, next rhythm showed sinus bradycardia in 30s.
Pt received Atropine, and HR came up to 50-60s with palpable pulses.
Both femoral groins were attempted for access and ultimately, a right subclavian line was placed.
Pt received propofol & IM ativan with more appropriate sedation prior to transfer.
However, pt was oxygenating well on the vent and his ABG improved overnight with IVF.
Hyperkalemia was treated with IV calcium and potassium trended down on repeat labs with insulin, dextrose & kayexalate.
Pt did not require pressors overnight and maintained BP well despite being in a junctional rhythm in the 40s.
Pt was again treated with dextrose, insulin & kayexalate.
However, sBP dropped to the 80-90s and HR began to trend down to 30s, pt was started on Dopamine gtt & EP called urgently to place transvenous pacemaker.
CPR was delivered continuously and transvenous pacer was placed at the bedside.
