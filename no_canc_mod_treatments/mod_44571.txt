Patient found to have 1 bottle from [**2159-4-2**] growing strep viridans that was empirically treated with cefazolin for 2 wk course.
He was started on aggressive treatment of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaximin.
Patient's mental status improved on treatment for hepatic encephaloapthy.
It was discovered that patient had been unable to afford rifaximin due to insurance reasons and family members had mentioned that he may have been non-compliant with lactulose.
He was started empirically on vancomycin and switched to cefazolin for 2 wk course.
Perhaps could have been from intubation as patient did not have any oral procedures recently.
