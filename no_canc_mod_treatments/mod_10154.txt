He has labs drawn at that time and the patient returned for followup on [**4-2**].
In the emergency room, the labs showed elevated LFTs as well as amylase and lipase.
He was given five liters normal saline and one dose of Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
The patient was evaluated by the department of surgery in the emergency room and they recommended medical management.
The patient was started on Bactrim prophylactically at that time.
The focus of his clinical care was initially on his pancreatitis, given his elevated amylase and lipase, elevated transaminases, tender abdomen, and peripancreatic-fluid collection seen on CT examination.
However, upon transfer from the intensive care unit, further history taking revealed that the patient gave a history very suspicious for tuberculosis given his 30 pound weight loss over the past three months, night sweats, fevers, and chronic cough.
The patient was then placed on precautions and subsequently found to have disseminated tuberculosis.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was started on Ciprofloxacin for Shigella in his stool.
He completed a one-week course of Ciprofloxacin for this and his diarrhea resolved.
The patient was placed on respiratory precautions on [**4-12**], when he was transferred to the [**Company 191**] service from the intensive care unit.
Because the patient had a sputum, which was positive for AFB the patient was continued on his respiratory precautions until he had been on his RIPE therapy for two weeks.
A full course of therapy will be determined by the infectious disease service.
The patient was treated with a 14-day course of Ceftriaxone.
He also had E coli sensitive to Ceftriaxone in his urine.
The patient had initially been taken off his Bactrim prophylaxis due to his elevated transaminases, however, this was restarted once the transaminases gradually came down.
It was thought that this was most likely due to bone marrow involvement by the disseminated tuberculosis.
He received a total of two units of packed red blood cells for hematocrit of 21, prior to the lymph node biopsy.
PULMONARY:  The patient briefly had an oxygen requirement of four liters oxygen saturation via nasal cannula at the time of his diagnosis of tuberculosis.
The patient was continued on maintenance IV fluids due to continued dehydration due to high fevers and poor p.o.
The patient was started on heparin drip for his right common iliac clot.
He will need to continue on anticoagulation therapy for six months for his clot.
He should be started on Coumadin once his procedures have all been completed.
