Past obstetric history was notable for delivery in [**2133**] of a term female with antenatally diagnosed fetal pyloric stenosis, which required repair at six weeks of age.
Prenatal screens 0 positive, direct Coomb's negative, RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune, hepatitis surface antigen negative, Group B Streptotoccus unknown.
This has been followed by daily ultrasounds with the most recent recorded on [**2136-5-11**], showing bilateral duplicated collecting systems with severe right-sided hydronephrosis and cortical thinning, ureterocele and left-sided mild hydronephrosis and caliectasis.
Because of evolving ultrasound findings labor was induced on the evening prior to delivery and progressed to spontaneous vaginal delivery under epidural anesthesia.
Assisted rupture of membranes, three hours prior to delivery yielding clear amniotic fluid, intrapartum antibiotic therapy administered 4.5 hours prior to delivery.
Fluids - Initial birth weight was 3.525 kg and infant was on ad lib feedings.
Genitourinary/gastrointestinal - Renal ultrasound performed on day of birth, confirmed prenatal findings including bilateral duplex collecting system, severe right hydronephrosis with caliectasis of lower pole leading to dilated ureter and upper pole eventually leading to the ureterocele.
Infectious disease - The infant was started on 20 mg/kg/day of Amoxicillin for prophylaxis.
Feedings - Continue ad lib feedings.
Medications - Continue Amoxicillin 20 mg/kg/day 3.
Immunizations - The infant has not yet received immunizations.
