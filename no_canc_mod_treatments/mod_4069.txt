Admission Date:  [**2175-2-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-3-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-2-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Keflex / Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**] Chief Complaint: B/L LE edema and non healing ulcers, now awaiting ICD placement by EP  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Patient has several ulcers of the anterior tibias, calves and dorsum of the feet.
Patient states that he recently had an open aortic valve replacement at [**Hospital6 **] in [**2174-7-29**] (porcine).
He has a history of PVD, and underwent LLE angiogram with Left AT angioplasty in [**2172**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Received 1 dose epi, and 2 grams magnesium for prolonged QT and possible torsades.
Patient was intubated for airway protection and to allow for vascular access to be obtained as he was agitated.
EP was consulted and felt that his arrest was most likely secondary to underlying familial prolonged QT syndrome in setting of fluoroquinolone use, so ciprofloxacin was stopped.
His antibiotic regimen was changed to vancomycin and meropenem.
There were no deep tissue cultures to tailor therapy but tissue swabs grew diptheroids, citrobacter, staph, bacteroides.
A urine culture from a foley also grew citrobacter.
Was initially bradycardic after resuscitation, although this normalized with discontinuation of propofol sedation and extubation.
His lower extremities did not improve substantially on antibiotics and he underwent right second toe amputation and left fourth toe amputation on [**3-2**].
He was eventually called out of the ICU and had an ICD placed on [**3-6**].
Past Medical History: # AVR [**7-/2174**], porcine # CRI 1.3 baseline # Afib on coumadin # PVD s/p left AT PTA [**2-4**] # CAD s/p RCA stent [**8-/2172**], cath on [**8-/2174**] "normal" # DM II # Left acoustic neuroma s/p resection # BCC s/p resection # melenoma s/p resection # s/p 2-toe amputation # s/p pulseless code blue [**2-/2175**] # ?
Pertinent Results: CXR [**3-7**]: Since [**2175-3-2**], a left-sided single chamber pacemaker defibrillator was installed ending in the right ventricle.
Sternotomy for AVR was performed.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2175-2-27**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.

Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**6-/2472**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
A positive result in a recently treated patient is of uncertain          significance unless the patient is currently symptomatic          (relapse).
He had a single lead ICD placed without complication.
He will continue on metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
He will need electrolytes checked daily while receiving aggressive diuresis and should have his K repleted to >4 and his Mg repleted to >2.
# toe gangrene/LE ulcers: patient did not improve on antibiotics and therefore underwent debridement and toe amputation.
No deep tissue cultures sent so covering broadly with meropenem and vancomycin for a 2 week course for soft tissue infection.
He will complete his meropenem and vancomycin on [**3-11**].
According to vascular surgery attending, patient did have bone involvement at the time of surgery but he felt that all of the involved bone was debrided so at this time he does not require treatment for osteomyelitis.
He will need to follow up with his vascular surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks to assess for appropriate granulation and need for further intervention.
He will continue wet->dry dressing changes on his R foot and vac dressing on his left foot per vascular and wound care recommendations.
He will also receive adaptic/ACE on venous ulcers bilaterally.
Of note, patient had been receiving hyperbaric oxygen treatments as an outpatient and if possible, could continue as an outpatient.
Diarrhea has improved on po flagyl.
He will require 2 weeks of flagyl after completion of his broad spectrum antibiotics.
As above, he will complete 2 weeks of meropenem which will treat his UTI.
Unfortunately, his foley could not be removed due to penile and scrotal edema but as he continues to diurese (below) and his swelling improves, his foley should be removed.
Potential contribution of recently decreased lasix prior to admission as well as acute renal failure on admission.
He was initially diuresed with IV lasix, starting at 80 mg IV BID and then increased to 100 mg IV BID.
Prior to discharge he was transitioned to torsemide 80 mg po BID with good response.
He should continue this medication and should have his electrolytes monitored daily to ensure he does not go into renal failure or have significant electrolyte abnormalities.
This improved with diuresis as above.
On coumadin as an outpatient.
His coumadin was held prior to his vascular surgery and his ICD and was restarted [**3-6**] at his home dose of 2.5.
His INR remained subtherapeutic so his coumadin dose was increased to 5 mg on [**3-8**].
He was treated with 8 units of lantus and insulin sliding scale.
