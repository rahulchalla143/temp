She was intubated with etomidate and propofol.
Neurosurgery was consulted there and an EVD was placed in routine fashion.

The distal cervical internal carotid arteries measure 4.0 mm in diameter on the left and 4.5 mm in diameter on the right.
Aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery measuring 4.5 mm in diameter and aneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery at the bifurcation measuring 5.5 mm in diameter.
[**2132-6-28**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Redemonstration of unchanged intracranial hemorrhage and interval placement of endovascular emoblization coils.
There is evidence of further ventricular dilatation over the 11-hour interval, most evident in the lateral ventricular frontal and temporal horns, with ventriculostomy catheter abuting the floor of the III ventricle.
There is now a small amount of subarachnoid blood at the left parietovertex  [**2132-6-28**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: 1.
Ventriculostomy catheter terminating in the third ventricle with slightly decreased size of the lateral ventricles compared to [**2132-6-28**].
New foci of hyperdensity in the sulci at the vertex could be related to redistribution of existing blood products; however, new hemorrhage cannot be excluded and attention on followup is recommended.
A right EVD was placed at St. Vincents prior to transfer.
Upon admission she was intubated and taken to INR for a cerebral angiogram with coiling of the L MCA/ACOMM aneurysm.
On [**6-28**], her EVD was not draining, after multiple attempts to trouble shoot, a Head CT was done to verify placement and TPA was given with good effect.
She was also given a bedside feeding trial.
In the afternoon, a clamping trial of drain was done.
On [**7-3**], her exam remained stable and her ICPs remain wnl.
Her urine culture was negative but we opted to continue treating as her UA was positive.
