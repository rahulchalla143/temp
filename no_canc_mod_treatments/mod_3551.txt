He has had intermittent BRBPR over the past week, mostly very light, but since earlier today with three episodes of large bright red blood.
He had a sigmoidoscopy performed on Friday without cause for bleeding seen, and is scheduled for colonoscopy tomorrow.
He did have nausea today associated with drinking the Mg Citrate very quickly but that has since resolved.
Underwent cardioversion two weeks ago.

Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to cecum ------------------- Colonoscopy [**2168**] Diverticulosis of the sigmoid [**Year (4 digits) 499**] Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: High fiber diet Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as needed Colonoscopy in [**5-6**] years Additional notes: The efficiency of colonoscopy in detecting lesions was discussed with the patient and it was pointed out that a small percentage of polyps and other lesions can be missed with the test.
Degree of difficulty = 2 (5 most difficult) ------- Colonoscopy [**2163**]: Polyp at distal sigmoid -------  Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: ==================================== Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 y/o M with a hx of CAD (s/p DES to LAD in [**2166**]), atrial fibrillation, diverticulosis, and massive GIB in the [**2131**], who was admitted with lower GI bleed 2 months after starting Pradaxa for AFib; likely Diverticular Bleeding  ACTIVE ISSUES: ======================= # Lower GI bleed:  Most likely diverticular bleed in setting of new dabigatran use.
He had no further events but Hct trended down from baseline 44 to 26.4 at lowest and he required transfusion of 5 units of packed red cells.
Aspirin was held on admission and was resumed at 325mg daily 2 days prior to discharge without any evidence of re-bleed.
If there is no evidence of further bleeding then patient may be started on anticoagulation at follow-up with his cardiologist.
He likely should be on coumadin instead of dabigatran so that his anticoagulation can be reversed rapidly if he has further GI bleeding.
He had been on sotalol for maintenance of sinus rhythm.
He wasn't able to be converted back into sinus rhythm despite increased doses of sotalol and therefore he was switched to dofetilide.
- The patient may be restarted on anticoagulation at follow-up with cardiology as discussed above pending a careful risk/benefit discussion.
- Patient discharged on Dofetilide 500mg [**Hospital1 **] - Patient was counseled extensively on risks of QT prolongation and to avoid any medications or herbal supplements that could increase risk of torsade.
The patient completed a 7 day course of Aztreonam/Flagyl - Patient will follow-up with GI as above - High fiber diet  # Gout: patient had podagra during admission that improved with 1.8mg of colchicine (1.2mg followed by 0.6mg 1 hour later).
- He will continue colchicine 0.6mg daily after dicharge  CHRONIC ISSUES: ======================= # CAD (s/p DES to LAD in [**2166**]): no signs of ischemia during this admission.
Aspirin was held initially because of bleed.
Due to aspirin allergy patient had to be de-sensitized again - discharged on ASA 325mg daily.
If he goes back on anticoagulation then can switch back to ASA 81mg daily - continued Atorvastatin 40mg  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ============================= # Patient will follow-up with his gastroenterologist ~1week after discharge for a possible repeat colonoscopy.
If there is no evidence of further bleeding then patient may be re-started on anticoagulation if benefits are deemed to exceed the risks.
He likely should be on coumadin instead of dabigatran so that his anticoagulation can be reversed rapidly if he has further GI bleeding.
# If patient goes back on anticoagulation then can switch back to ASA 81mg daily # Code Status: Confirmed Full Code   Medications on Admission: Confirmed with pt on admission atorvastatin 80 mg Tablet 0.5 (One half) Tablet(s) by mouth once a day (Dose  colchicine 0.6 mg Tablet 1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth once a day  [**2172-1-23**] lisinopril 5 mg Tablet 1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth once a day [**2173-2-23**] soltatlol 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] aspirin 325 mg Tablet 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day - he was on 81 mg daily when he was started on pradaxa but with d/c of that 6 days prior to admission he started taking 325 mg ASA daily pradaxa - [**Hospital1 **] but self d/c'ed 6 days ago  Discharge Medications: 1.

You lost a large amount of blood and required 5 blood transfusions.
Eventually your bleeding stopped on its own and your blood counts started to recover.
You were put on a new medication called Dofetilide to help keep in you in normal (sinus) rhythm.
There is risk of life-threatening arrythmias if dofetilide is combined with certain other medications.
If there is no evidence of further bleeding then you may discuss with your cardiologist about going back on a different blood thinner to help prevent stroke.
