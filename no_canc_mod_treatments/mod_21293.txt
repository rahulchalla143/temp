Trichrome and reticulin stains show no significant fibrosis.
Patient was transferred to SICU for further management, cardiology heart failure was involved in patient care, recommended gentle diuresis.
Was placed on dopamine drip, to increase the cardiac out put.
Swan catheter was placed on arrival to the intensive care unit for further management of the CHF, and to obtain more info about the cardiac function.
Patient was managed with milrinone and IV lasix.
Later, a Natrecor drip was started.
Patient finally was weaned off the Natrecor drip and the dopamine, and was left on Lasix drip.
At that point the bp of the patient did not tolerate Lasix bolus.
Patient remain in the SICU until the Lasix drip was successfully wean off, and was placed on Lasix IV bolus.
Post pyloric tube feedings were started during her SICU stay.
Once on the floor the diuretics were started per mouth, aggressive physical therapy was installed, and more nutrition po, cycling the Tube feedings at night and increasing po intake.
Feeding tube was removed prior to discharge, patient remains with good po intake.
*** Large pericardial effusion**** On [**2115-4-25**], the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization for right ventricular biopsy to assess the cause of her biventricular heart failure.
Repeat serial echos showed, with the drain in place, resolved pericardial effusion.
The drain was then removed  on [**2115-4-27**] without further accumulation of the pericardial effusion.
The last echocardiogram was performed on [**2115-4-28**] and should be repeated on [**2115-5-1**] with monitoring daily of a pulsus and signs of tamponade.
A swan was placed and showed an index of 1.83 before inotropy was initiated.
She was placed on milrinone 0.375 with an index of 2.42 which was titrated up to 0.4 with an index of 2.69, SVR of 880.
She was given 60 mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **]  with minimal diuresis.
The patient was then diuresed with diuril 250 mg and 500 mg IV BID in addition to bumex 4 mg IV BID which provided much diuresis -1.5 to 2.6 liters a day.
In addition, she was maintained on spironolactone 25 mg daily, carvedilol 3.125 mg [**Hospital1 **] and digoxin 0.125 mg.
The swan was discontinued and the patient was diuresed with diuril and bumex.
As a result, our plan is to slow down her diuresis and give her diamox for her alkalosis.
Of note, we performed a trial of a low-dose ACE which the patient did not tolerate.
The patient had been on vancomycin per transplant surgery empirically.
She was also on Bactrim DS [**Hospital1 **] for PCP prophylaxis as she's in an immunocompromised state.
We started her on Zosyn 4.5 gm IV Q8 on [**2115-4-26**] for a total of 5 days.
Her E. coli proved to be sensitive to Bactrim which we continued.
Transplant surgery indicated that they no longer feel that she needs empiric vancomycin.
She had a transplant as described above.
She was maintained on rapamycin, MMF, and prednisone per the transplant surgery service who followed her daily in the CCU and discussed her care with the CCU team daily.
However, after she developed tamponade post RV ***** IV access**** A double-lumen PICC was placed on [**2115-4-29**] for IV access.
She was followed while an inpatient by our diabetic specialists at the [**Hospital **] Clinic who recommended maintaining her on lantus QHS and a sliding scale of insulin.
