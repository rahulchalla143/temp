# Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma exacerbation, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
Initially, he required paralysis in order to maintain ventilator synchrony.
He was placed on respiratory precautions while a viral illness was ruled out; a rapid viral screen was negative for influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and RSV infection.
At time of admission, he was started on Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin as empiric coverage for a community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.
He was treated with high-dose solumedrol and continuous bronchodilatory MDI's in effort to reduce his airway resistance.
A pan-sensitive pseudomonas organism was subsequently cultured from a sputum sample obtained at the time of his presentation.
On [**2-7**], his antibiotic coverage was changed to Levofloxacin and Zosyn for double-coverage of Pseudomonas.
His ventilator settings were managed to allow permissive hypercapnea, and remained stable but without improvement.
The differential for the trigger for his asthma exacerbation was broadened, and a mini-BAL was performed on [**2-10**] with sample sent for fungal culture and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 23426**].
The pt was eventually extubated and transferred to the floor where he completed his 2 week course of Levofloxacin and Zosyn.
Prior to discharge pt was saturating adequately on 2l nasal canula with Fluticasone, Albuterol, Montelukast, Albuterol inhalers.
Pulmonary team were also consulted prior to transfer and recommended a slow Prednisone taper of 1.
40mg Prednisone once a day x 5 days (starting [**2132-2-22**]) 2.
30mg Prednisone once a day x 5 days (starting [**2132-2-27**]) 3.
20mg Prednisone once a day, he should be continued on this dose until he is seen by his outpatient Pulmonary physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
# Steroid Prophylaxis: After discussion with Pulmonary prior to discharge pt was started on PCP prophylaxis with Bactrim as well as Calcium and Vitamin D.  # Demand ischemia:  During admission pt was noted to have an elevated Troponin level of 0.16 (which trended down) with negative CK and CK MBs.
He was briefly anticoagulated on a heparin gtt due to initial concern for cardiac ischemia; however, this was later attributed to demand and heparin gtt was discontinued.
He was started on ASA 81 mg for primary cardiac prevention and was continued on his home statin.
he had been maintained on a PPI during his entire course.
GI was consulted but given that the Hct stabilized no emergent intervention was needed.
GI saw pt prior to discharge and recommended an outpatient Endoscopy once pt has completed rehab.
# Hypertension: Pt has a history of hypertension for which prior to discharge he was maintained on Cardizem 30mg four times a day.
# Oral Candidasis: Pt was noted to have oral candidiasis was started on Nystatin swish and swallow.

Whilst you were in the hospital your breathing was maintained on the ventilator in the ICU until you were able to breathe for yourself.
You were then extubated and your breathing improved to the point that you only needed nasal cannula oxygen.
During your hospitalization we noted that you were weak after being very sick, you were seen by physical and occupational therapy who recommended you go to a rehab facility to help gain your strength.
Please take your medications as prescribed.
