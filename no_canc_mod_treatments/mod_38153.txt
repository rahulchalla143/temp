Pt s/p 5 days of levaquin, febrile on presentation, afebrile since then.
Pt was also treated with afrin nasal spray x 3d.
her acute increase in lethargy was felt most likely [**3-4**] infection versus CHF, although hypercarbia was possible (though beleive pt was not far off of baseline CO2 which is likely 53-55 based on previous serum HCO3 levels).
Pt received treatment for underlying infection, diuresis for CHF (-2.2L removed [**12-14**]) and antipsychotic medications were held.
A second trial of full face cpap was attempted overnight [**12-14**], but pt became apneic (presumably because CO2 was removed reducing her respiratory drive).
As such, pt was treated with lasix 10mg iv prn to facilitate diuresis.
Pt also underwent a trial of nasal CPAP given her h/o of OSA, however she did not tolerate CPAP well as she sleeps with her mouth open, and became apneic with whole face CPAP as described above.
Pt was also continued on INH for presumed Tb.
pt continued on asa, lisinopril was held on [**12-15**] given concern of enlarge tongue (?angioedema), however upon further discussion with PCP pt has been on this medication for >8months, and it could be restarted.
she will be d/c'd home off of any antihypertensives, to her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] which time she could be restarted on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] if needed for BP control.
discussed timeline of decline with PCP ([**Doctor Last Name **]), who feels this can be continued to workup as outpatient, where we can monitor her reticulocyte response to iron (retics here prior to iron therap 1.2%).
low dose metoprolol was attempted given our beleif that she has fixed stable CAD, and that an ischemic event ~1week PTA may have been responsible for her pulmonary edema this admission.
# DM: pt on avandia as outpatient, which was held as an inpatient in favor of ISS, but will be started upon discharge.
# PPx - SubC heparin for DVT prophylaxis - bowel regimen .
her lisinopril, aricept, and risperdal were discontinued, though aricept and risperdal may be restarted per PCP.
