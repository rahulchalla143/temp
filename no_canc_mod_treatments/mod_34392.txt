Brief Hospital Course: 82 year-old female with history of pulmonary embolism and atrial fibrillation on coumadin admitted [**2161-5-23**] following fall.
Hospital course was complicated by respiratory distress requiring intubation, ventilator associated pneumonia, and UTI.
She had been on aspirin, plavix and coumadin and her anticoagulation was reversed and her labs were followed closely.
Her management continued to be primarily medical.
Extubation was again considered [**5-26**] but CXR showed fluid and she remained intubated.
She continued to complain of a dull, persistent headache.
Neurosurgery evaluated the patient and decided that surgery was indicated.
During a meeting with the neurosurgeons, cardiologist, and primary medicine team, the risks and benefits of surgery were explained to the family and the family decided to pursue a craniotomy.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was monitored for 24 hours in the PACU before being transferred to the neurosurgical floor.
Patient will need to have sutures removed from craniotomy site on [**2161-6-15**].
Neurological deficits on discharge: Minor parathesia in left hand, non-dermatomal distribution.
Re: SDH evacuation, patient underwent cranitomy with bone flap.
She was started on a 10 day course of Vancomycin and Ceftazidime to cover ventilator and hospital acquired pneumonia.
In the ICU, she had a central line which was later discontinued on the floor after placement of a PICC line.
The 10 day course of antibiotics was finished in the hospital.
Anticoagulation:  Due to the SDH, the patient was stopped on her Coumadin therapy.
In addition, her Plavix for her bare metal stent placed on [**2161-2-4**] was discontinued - Plavix is no longer indicated.
After her craniotomy, neurosurgery recommended that the patient should continue her daily aspirin.
We are currently hold statin as well; may be started once transaminitis resolves.
The UTI resolved after antibiotic treatment.
Hypertension:  Given that the patient has severe aortic stenosis and therefore preload dependent, the patient was discontinued on Isordil.
With this exception, the patient was continued on lisinopril (increased) and metoprolol with adequate BP control.
Continuing Lasix per home regimen.
Hypokalemia:  Continuing potassium supplement.
Seizure prophylaxis was not indicated initially, but has now been started after the seizure on [**2161-6-11**].

This is because the subdural was evacuated with a bone flap craniotomy.
You required a breathing tube while in the ER and were sent to the ICU.
You finished your antibiotics while in the hospital.
You underwent a craniotomy on [**2161-6-5**] for the bleeding around your brain and currently are doing well.
This was treated with amiodarone with which you reacted with some liver inflammation.
You have been started on an anti-seizure medication (Keppra).
