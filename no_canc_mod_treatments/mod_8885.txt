Chronic renal insufficiency/RAS s/p angioplasty and stent [**2152**] 18.
Imaging of aortic arch and left carotid deferred in order to  preserved dye.
The right common carotid artery was imaged with a Berenstein  catheter selectively showing patent Right common with a right internal with a 80% tubular lesion at prior CEA site.
The right carotid filled the right MCA and a fetal origin PCA but not the right ACA.
We elected to proceed to right internal carotid stenting.
We placed the Berenstein in the right external and exchanged over a SupraCore wire for a 6F Shuttle sheath after giving Heparin (ACT 265).
We predilated with a Quantum Maverick 2.5x20 at 8atm and stented with a Protege 8-6x40mm tapered self-expanding stent.
We posted the stent with a Quantum Maverick 4.5x20 at 18 atm.
The patient  tolerated the procedure well with minimal hypotension as status post CEA.
He remained neurologically intact during the procedure and  immediately after.
Groin closure with Mynx.

Patient was continued on asa, plavix and statin.
Patient given Rx for aspirin and plavix.
Improved with hydralazine prn on the medicine floor.
Patient aware of high likelihood of needing dialysis post-cath.
Patient recieved pre-catherization hydration.

You tolerated the procedure well without complication.
It is very important that you follow up with your nephrologist this week and have your electrolytes checked as the dye that was used for the procedure may worsen your renal function.
Medication changes: 1) You were started on a full strength aspirin for which you are being given a prescription.
You should continue to take your plavix as well.
These two medications are extremely important given your new carotid stent.
You should not stop taking these medications prior to talking to a cardiologist.
If you cannot see your nephrologist within the week then you should see your primary care doctor instead and have your electrolytes.
